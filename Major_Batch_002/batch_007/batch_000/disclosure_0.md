## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Spatial Audio & Haptic Feedback

**System Overview:** A multi-modal system for reconstructing acoustic scenes, providing both spatial audio and localized haptic feedback to the user. This extends beyond simple noise cancellation or wind reduction, aiming to *recreate* the sonic environment with added tactile elements.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Microphone Array:** High-density microphone array (64+ microphones) for precise sound source localization. Integrated with the device (e.g., smartphone, AR headset).
*   **Spatial Audio Renderer:** Dedicated DSP or software module capable of rendering binaural or ambisonic audio. Supports head tracking for a stable soundstage.
*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** A matrix of ultrasonic haptic actuators (or alternative, localized vibration technology) embedded in a wearable device (wristband, glove, vest). High resolution and fast response time are critical.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance SoC (System on a Chip) with dedicated AI acceleration for real-time signal processing and scene reconstruction.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  Combined with head tracking for a comprehensive understanding of the user’s orientation and movement within the reconstructed scene.

**Software Modules:**

*   **Beamforming & Source Localization:** Advanced beamforming algorithms coupled with machine learning models for accurately identifying and localizing sound sources in 3D space. The system should differentiate between stationary and moving sources.
*   **Acoustic Scene Classification:**  Deep learning models trained to classify the acoustic scene (e.g., street noise, indoor conversation, forest ambience). This classification guides the reconstruction process and influences the haptic feedback.
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:**  A key innovation. This algorithm maps sound source characteristics (frequency, amplitude, direction) to localized haptic sensations. Lower frequencies could be represented as broader vibrations, while higher frequencies could be represented as sharper, more focused sensations.  Sound source direction directly corresponds to the location of the haptic stimulation.
*   **Dynamic Reverberation & Environmental Effects:**  Simulates the acoustic characteristics of the reconstructed environment (reverberation, echoes, reflections). Adapts dynamically based on scene classification.
*   **User Interface & Customization:** Allows users to adjust the intensity and characteristics of the haptic feedback, as well as customize the acoustic scene reconstruction.



**Pseudocode – Haptic Mapping Algorithm**

```
// Input: Sound source data (frequency, amplitude, direction)
// Output: Haptic stimulation parameters (location, intensity, waveform)

function mapSoundToHaptics(frequency, amplitude, direction) {

  // 1. Normalize Amplitude
  normalizedAmplitude = clamp(amplitude / maxAmplitude, 0, 1);

  // 2. Calculate Haptic Intensity
  hapticIntensity = normalizedAmplitude * maxHapticIntensity;

  // 3. Determine Haptic Location (based on sound source direction)
  hapticX = map(directionX, -1, 1, minX, maxX); // Map direction X to actuator X
  hapticY = map(directionY, -1, 1, minY, maxY); // Map direction Y to actuator Y

  // 4. Select Haptic Waveform (based on frequency)
  if (frequency < 200 Hz) {
    waveform = "broad_pulse";
  } else if (frequency < 1000 Hz) {
    waveform = "narrow_pulse";
  } else {
    waveform = "sharp_peak";
  }

  // 5. Generate Haptic Stimulation Parameters
  stimulationParameters = {
    x: hapticX,
    y: hapticY,
    intensity: hapticIntensity,
    waveform: waveform
  };

  return stimulationParameters;
}

//Helper functions - map, clamp would need to be defined
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Multimodal Integration:** Combining spatial audio with localized haptic feedback creates a more immersive and realistic sensory experience.
*   **Dynamic Haptic Mapping:** Adapting the haptic feedback based on the frequency and characteristics of the sound source.
*   **Scene-Aware Reconstruction:** Leveraging acoustic scene classification to create more accurate and believable environments.
*   **Haptic Resolution:** Leveraging a high density actuator array, with a novel signal processing algorithm.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Gaming:** Enhancing the gaming experience with realistic spatial audio and tactile feedback.
*   **Virtual & Augmented Reality:** Creating more immersive and believable VR/AR environments.
*   **Assistive Technology:** Providing directional cues and environmental awareness for visually impaired individuals.
*   **Training & Simulation:** Creating realistic training scenarios for emergency responders and military personnel.
