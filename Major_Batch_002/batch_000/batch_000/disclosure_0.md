## Dynamic Content Prefetching Based on Predicted User Attention

**Concept:** Expand upon the prefetching technology by predicting *where* within a web page a user is likely to focus their attention, and proactively prefetching content relevant to those areas. This moves beyond simply prefetching the entire page and optimizes bandwidth by prefetching only the *most likely* viewed components.

**Specs:**

*   **Attention Prediction Model:**  A neural network trained on user eye-tracking data (collected anonymously and with consent) combined with page layout analysis (heatmaps of common viewing patterns). Input features include:
    *   Page element type (image, text block, video, etc.)
    *   Element size and position on the page
    *   Text content (processed with NLP for topic identification)
    *   User demographics (age range, general interests - derived from social media platform data with user consent)
    *   Time of day / day of week
*   **Content Segmentation:** Web pages are dynamically segmented into visually distinct areas (using computer vision algorithms). Each segment is assigned a ‘probability of view’ score based on the Attention Prediction Model.
*   **Prefetch Prioritization:** Content for segments with a probability of view exceeding a defined threshold (adjustable per user/network conditions) are prioritized for prefetching. 
*   **Adaptive Prefetching:**  The system continuously monitors user scrolling and eye movements (where available & consented to).  Prefetching behavior adjusts in real-time based on actual user attention.  If a predicted segment isn't viewed, prefetching for similar segments is temporarily reduced.
*   **Resource Prioritization:**  Prefetching prioritizes resources needed for likely-viewed segments *before* the entire segment's assets.  For example, high-resolution images within a likely-viewed segment are prefetched before lower-priority resources.
*   **Client-Side Implementation:**  A lightweight Javascript library integrates with web pages to intercept resource requests and leverage pre-fetched content.  This minimizes server load and enhances responsiveness.
*   **Data Pipeline:**  Anonymous user interaction data (scrolling, eye movements, resource requests) is collected and used to continuously retrain the Attention Prediction Model, improving its accuracy over time. Differential privacy techniques are applied to protect user privacy.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```javascript
// On page load:
function initializePrefetcher() {
    // Fetch initial page segmentation and attention scores from server
    fetch('/api/page_segmentation')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            segments = data.segments;
            attentionScores = data.attentionScores;

            // Prioritize prefetching based on attention scores
            prefetchHighPrioritySegments(segments, attentionScores);
        });

    // Monitor user scrolling and eye movements (if available)
    window.addEventListener('scroll', updatePrefetching);
}

function updatePrefetching() {
    // Recalculate segment visibility and attention scores based on current scroll position
    // Adjust prefetching behavior accordingly
}

function prefetchHighPrioritySegments(segments, attentionScores) {
    for (let i = 0; i < segments.length; i++) {
        if (attentionScores[i] > threshold) {
            // Prefetch resources for segment i
            prefetchSegmentResources(segments[i]);
        }
    }
}

function prefetchSegmentResources(segment) {
    // Identify resources needed for segment (images, scripts, etc.)
    // Check if resources are already cached
    // If not cached, initiate resource requests with high priority
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Cross-Device Prefetching:** Leverage user login data to synchronize prefetching across multiple devices (e.g., prefetching content on a mobile device when the user is browsing on a desktop).
*   **Personalized Prefetching:** Tailor prefetching behavior based on user interests and browsing history.
*   **Integration with Meta's AI Infrastructure:** Utilize Meta's AI models to improve the accuracy of the Attention Prediction Model and personalize prefetching recommendations.
