## Dynamic Content Stitching with Receiver-Side Polymorphism

**Concept:** Extend the secure content delivery framework to support dynamic content stitching *on the receiver device* based on receiver capabilities and preferences. This allows for a single base content package to be adapted into multiple experiences *after* secure delivery, without requiring transcoding of every possible variation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Content Packaging:** The initial content uploaded isn't a fully formed media file, but a 'content graph'. This graph describes a series of media 'fragments' (video clips, audio snippets, image overlays, interactive elements) and rules for combining them. Fragments are individually encrypted.  Metadata associated with each fragment includes:
    *   Fragment Type (Video, Audio, Image, Interactive)
    *   Resolution/Quality Levels
    *   Dependencies (other fragments required before playback)
    *   Receiver Capability Flags (e.g., supports AR, supports spatial audio, maximum resolution supported)
    *   Accessibility Metadata (subtitles, audio descriptions)

2.  **Delivery & Decryption:** The encrypted content graph and its fragments are delivered to the receiver. The receiver uses the access token to decrypt the content graph.  The content graph *does not* contain fully assembled media, but instructions.

3.  **Receiver-Side Stitching Engine:** The receiver device hosts a ‘Stitching Engine’. This engine:
    *   Reads the content graph.
    *   Queries the receiver’s capabilities (resolution, audio support, AR/VR support, accessibility settings).
    *   Based on capabilities *and user preferences* (set via app settings or real-time input), selects the appropriate fragments from the available options.
    *   Dynamically assembles the content by stitching together the selected fragments.
    *   Handles fragment dependencies, ensuring proper playback order.

4.  **Dynamic Asset Loading:**  Fragments are streamed or downloaded on-demand as needed during the stitching process. This minimizes initial download size and allows for adaptive streaming based on network conditions.

5.  **Interactive Stitching:** The content graph can define interactive elements that trigger changes to the stitching process. For example, a user choice could alter the sequence of video clips or add additional overlays.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Engine):**

```
function stitchContent(contentGraph, receiverCapabilities, userPreferences):
  fragmentMap = {} // Store loaded fragments
  assemblyQueue = [] // Queue of fragments to assemble

  // Parse content graph to identify initial fragments
  initialFragments = parseInitialFragments(contentGraph)

  for fragment in initialFragments:
    if fragment not in fragmentMap:
      downloadFragment(fragment)
      fragmentMap[fragment] = decryptedFragment

    assemblyQueue.append(fragment)

  while assemblyQueue is not empty:
    currentFragment = assemblyQueue.pop()
    playFragment(currentFragment)

    // Check for dependencies & trigger loading of next fragments
    dependentFragments = getDependentFragments(currentFragment, contentGraph)
    for fragment in dependentFragments:
      if fragment not in fragmentMap:
        downloadFragment(fragment)
        fragmentMap[fragment] = decryptedFragment
        assemblyQueue.append(fragment)

  return
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Personalized Video Experiences:**  Tailor content to individual user preferences, creating unique viewing experiences.
*   **Adaptive Accessibility:** Dynamically adjust content based on accessibility settings (e.g., subtitles, audio descriptions).
*   **Interactive Storytelling:** Allow users to influence the narrative through interactive choices.
*   **AR/VR Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate augmented or virtual reality elements into the content stream.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Deliver different language tracks or subtitles on-demand.
