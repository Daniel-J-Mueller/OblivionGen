## Dynamic Product ‘Wishlist’ Integration & Predictive Bundling

**Concept:** Extend the product demand gathering system to proactively create personalized ‘wishlists’ *before* a user even searches for a product, and leverage this data for predictive bundling offers.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Wishlist Generation Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User browsing history (across all integrated e-commerce sites - not just ours) via optional, opt-in browser extension/account linking.
    *   Social media activity (with explicit user permission). Keyword analysis of posts, likes, shares.
    *   Demographic data (age, location, stated interests).
    *   Trending product searches (aggregated, anonymized).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Weighted keyword analysis. Higher weight to explicit “want”/“need” statements.
    *   Collaborative filtering (users with similar profiles/browsing habits).
    *   Content-based filtering (product attribute matching – e.g., user frequently views “hiking boots” – recommend similar boots).
    *   Machine learning model trained to predict potential future purchases.
*   **Output:** A dynamically updated ‘predicted wishlist’ stored per user account.

**2. Proactive Wishlist Presentation:**

*   **Interface Element:** A “Your Predicted Needs” module on the user’s dashboard (web/app).
*   **Presentation:** Visual grid of predicted products with images, basic pricing.
*   **Interaction:** Users can:
    *   Add items to a permanent ‘true’ wishlist.
    *   Remove items from the predicted list.
    *   Indicate “not interested” with a reason (improves algorithm).
    *   Directly initiate a product demand request if the item is unavailable.

**3. Predictive Bundling Engine:**

*   **Trigger:** When a user views a product *or* when a product demand request is submitted.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze user’s predicted wishlist.
    *   Identify complementary products frequently purchased *together* with the viewed/requested item.
    *   Check current inventory/availability.
*   **Output:**
    *   “Frequently Bought Together” module with bundled price (discount applied).
    *   Proactive notification: “Customers who requested [item] also frequently purchase [complementary item] – save 10% when you buy both!”

**Pseudocode (Predictive Bundling Engine):**

```
FUNCTION generateBundle(userID, productID):
  predictedWishlist = GET_WISHLIST(userID)
  complementaryProducts = FIND_COMPLEMENTARY_PRODUCTS(productID) // Database lookup
  availableProducts = FILTER_AVAILABLE(complementaryProducts) // Check inventory
  bundle = CREATE_BUNDLE(productID, availableProducts)
  discountedPrice = CALCULATE_DISCOUNT(bundle)
  RETURN bundle, discountedPrice
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Privacy: Transparent data usage policies, user control over data sharing.
*   Scalability: Handle large user base and product catalog.
*   A/B Testing: Optimize algorithm and bundling offers.
*   Integration with Seller System: Allow sellers to propose bundled offers.
*   ‘Demand Bundles’: If multiple users request similar unavailable items, proactively create a ‘demand bundle’ and solicit offers from sellers.
