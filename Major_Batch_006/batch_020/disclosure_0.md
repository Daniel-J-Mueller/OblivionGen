## Dynamic Beacon Mesh Networking with Predictive Relaying

**Concept:** Expand the beacon functionality beyond simple position reporting to create a self-healing, predictive mesh network for enhanced accuracy and coverage, particularly in environments with signal obstruction or limited direct communication.

**Specifications:**

**1. Beacon Hardware Augmentation:**

*   **Multi-Directional Antenna Array:** Each beacon will incorporate a small phased array antenna capable of electronically steering its signal in multiple directions. This is for improved signal acquisition and targeted communication.
*   **Directional RF Signal Strength Measurement:** Include a directional RF signal strength measurement module.  This will allow each beacon to assess the signal strength *from* other beacons in different directions, not just receive/transmit status.
*   **Micro-Doppler Radar:** Integrate a short-range micro-Doppler radar to detect the *movement* of other beacons or vehicles. This will contribute to predictive relaying.
*   **Increased Processing Power:** Upgrade the processor to handle mesh networking algorithms, predictive modeling, and signal analysis.
*   **Energy Harvesting:** Incorporate a small solar cell and/or vibration energy harvester to supplement battery life, extending operational duration.

**2. Software/Firmware â€“ Mesh Networking Protocol:**

*   **Distributed Mesh Algorithm:** Implement a distributed mesh networking algorithm (e.g., OLSR, BATMAN-adv adapted for this application). This protocol will allow beacons to automatically discover and connect with each other, forming a dynamic network.
*   **Neighbor Discovery & Ranking:** Each beacon will periodically scan for nearby beacons and rank them based on:
    *   RF signal strength.
    *   Micro-Doppler velocity (static beacons prioritized).
    *   Battery level/energy status (preferentially route through beacons with ample power).
    *   Network latency (calculated round-trip time).
*   **Dynamic Routing Table:**  Beacons maintain a routing table indicating the best path to reach other beacons or vehicles within the network. This routing table is continuously updated based on changing network conditions.
*   **Predictive Relaying:**
    *   **Movement Prediction:** Utilize the Micro-Doppler radar data to predict the future position of mobile beacons (vehicles).
    *   **Proactive Routing:**  Pre-establish routes to the *predicted* future location of the mobile beacon, rather than waiting for signal degradation before finding an alternative path.  This anticipates obstructions.
    *   **Path Diversity:** Maintain multiple potential routes to each destination, allowing for seamless switching if a primary path becomes unavailable.
*   **Confidence Level Propagation:**  Each beacon will calculate a confidence level for its own position and propagate this confidence level along with position data to other beacons. The overall position accuracy for a vehicle will be a weighted average of the confidence levels of the beacons used to determine its position.
*   **Authentication Protocol:** A rolling cryptographic key system, changing frequently based on timestamp and a shared secret to prevent spoofing.

**3. Vehicle Integration:**

*   **Beacon Request Protocol:** Vehicles will transmit a request signal specifying their desired accuracy level.
*   **Network Negotiation:** The vehicle will negotiate with the mesh network to determine the optimal set of beacons to use for positioning.
*   **Data Fusion:** Vehicle software will fuse position data received from multiple beacons, weighting each data point based on its confidence level and signal strength.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Relaying):**

```
// Beacon A receives signal from Vehicle X
// Vehicle X is moving (detected by Doppler radar)
predicted_location = calculate_predicted_location(vehicle_x, current_time + prediction_horizon)
best_relay_beacon = find_best_relay(predicted_location) // Considers signal strength, battery, etc.
pre_establish_route(vehicle_x, best_relay_beacon) // Allocate bandwidth and resources
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Autonomous Vehicle Navigation:** Enhanced accuracy and reliability in complex urban environments.
*   **Drone Delivery:** Precise positioning in areas with limited GPS coverage.
*   **Asset Tracking:** Real-time tracking of assets in large warehouses or industrial facilities.
*   **Emergency Response:** Accurate positioning of first responders in disaster areas.
