## Dynamic Container Provenance with Attestation Chains

**Concept:** Extend threat scanning beyond static analysis of block storage to a dynamic, runtime-verified provenance system for containers. This system builds an attestation chain for each container layer, validating its origin and integrity *throughout* its lifecycle, not just at scan time.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on scanning block storage *after* containers are running. This is reactive.  A proactive system that validates layer origins and detects tampering *during* operation provides stronger security and allows for automated responses before threats materialize.

**Specifications:**

**1. Provenance Agent (PA):**

*   **Deployment:**  Sidecar container deployed alongside each target container.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Layer Tracking:** Monitors container layer creation (pulling images, building layers).
    *   **Attestation Request:**  Upon layer creation, requests an attestation from a trusted Attestation Service (AS). This request includes layer metadata (digest, build history, signing key used).
    *   **Local Attestation Cache:**  Caches successful attestations for fast verification of repeated layer accesses.
    *   **Runtime Integrity Monitoring:** Periodically verifies the integrity of active container layers using cryptographic hashes and compares them against the attested values.  Triggers alerts if mismatches are detected.
    *   **Report Generation:**  Creates a detailed provenance report for each container, including the attestation chain, integrity verification history, and any detected anomalies.

**2. Attestation Service (AS):**

*   **Deployment:** Centralized service accessible to all PAs.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Policy Enforcement:**  Defines and enforces policies regarding acceptable image sources, signing keys, and build processes.
    *   **Source Verification:**  Verifies the origin and authenticity of container images based on trusted registries, signing keys, and build metadata.
    *   **Attestation Generation:**  Creates a cryptographically signed attestation document confirming the image's authenticity and compliance with defined policies.
    *   **Attestation Revocation:**  Provides a mechanism for revoking attestations if vulnerabilities are discovered or policies change.
    *   **Policy Management:** Allows administrators to define and update policies centrally.

**3. Data Flow/Pseudocode:**

```
// Container Startup
PA.init()
PA.register_with_AS()

// Layer Creation (e.g., pulling image, building layer)
layer_metadata = get_layer_metadata()
attestation_request = create_attestation_request(layer_metadata)
attestation_response = AS.request_attestation(attestation_request)

if attestation_response.status == "success":
  PA.cache_attestation(attestation_response)
  layer_verified = True
else:
  layer_verified = False
  // Alert/Block container

// Runtime Integrity Check (periodic)
current_layer_hash = calculate_hash(layer_data)
cached_attestation = PA.get_cached_attestation(layer_id)

if cached_attestation.hash != current_layer_hash:
    // Integrity violation detected!
    PA.report_violation(layer_id, current_layer_hash)
    // Trigger automated response (e.g., isolate container, alert administrator)

//Container Termination
PA.finalize()
```

**4.  Integration with Existing Systems:**

*   **Container Orchestration:** Integrate with Kubernetes or other orchestration platforms to automatically deploy and manage PAs alongside containers.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Send provenance reports and security alerts to a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Combine provenance data with vulnerability scan results to prioritize remediation efforts and identify potentially compromised containers.

**5.  Novelty:**

This system goes beyond static scanning by providing a dynamic, runtime-verified provenance chain for container layers.  It enables proactive threat detection and automated response, improving overall container security. The integration of attestation services and runtime integrity monitoring creates a more robust and trustworthy container execution environment.
