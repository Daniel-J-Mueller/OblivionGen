## Adaptive Bio-Mimicry Propeller System

**Concept:** Develop propellers inspired by marine animal locomotion, specifically the tubercles on humpback whale flippers. These tubercles reduce drag and increase lift, enhancing maneuverability and efficiency. This system will go beyond static tubercle implementation and feature *dynamic* tubercle morphology adjustment.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Propeller Construction:**
    *   Material: Shape-memory polymer composite reinforced with carbon nanotubes for strength and responsiveness.
    *   Blade Design: Propeller blades will incorporate multiple small, independently actuatable “tubercles” along their leading edges. These tubercles are not fixed but are integrated deformable structures.
    *   Actuation Mechanism: Each tubercle will be controlled by a miniature piezoelectric actuator embedded within the blade structure.
    *   Sensor Suite: Each propeller will include integrated micro-pressure sensors along the blade surface to detect stall conditions and airflow changes.

2.  **Control System:**
    *   Central Processing Unit: High-speed embedded processor on the drone’s main board.
    *   Control Algorithm: Model Predictive Control (MPC) incorporating real-time sensor data (pressure, IMU, GPS). The algorithm will dynamically adjust the shape of each tubercle to optimize performance for current flight conditions.
    *   Communication Protocol: High-bandwidth wireless communication between the central processor and each propeller.
    *   Power Supply: Dedicated power line from the drone’s battery to each propeller, ensuring sufficient power for the actuators.

3.  **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Efficiency Mode:** Tubercle shapes optimized for maximum lift and minimum drag during cruise flight.
    *   **Maneuverability Mode:** Tubercle shapes dynamically adjusted to enhance roll, pitch, and yaw responsiveness.
    *   **Noise Reduction Mode:** Tubercle shapes altered to disrupt vortex shedding and reduce aerodynamic noise.
    *   **Stall Recovery Mode:**  Actuators respond to sensor data indicating stall, altering tubercle shapes to restore lift and prevent loss of control.

4.  **Pseudocode (Simplified Stall Recovery):**

```
// Function: RecoverFromStall(pressureData, currentShape)

IF pressureData.leadingEdgePressure < thresholdStallPressure THEN
    // Identify stalled section of blade
    stalledSection = FindStalledSection(pressureData)

    // Calculate optimal tubercle shape for stalled section
    optimalShape = CalculateOptimalShape(stalledSection, airflowData)

    // Actuate tubercles to achieve optimal shape
    ActuateTubercles(stalledSection, optimalShape)

    // Monitor pressure data to verify recovery
    WHILE pressureData.leadingEdgePressure < thresholdRecoveryPressure DO
        // Fine-tune tubercle shapes based on real-time feedback
        FineTuneTubercles(stalledSection, pressureData)
    END WHILE

    // Return to normal operation
    ReturnToNormalOperation()
END IF
```
