**Dynamic Spectral Shaping for Display Burn-In & Calibration**

**Concept:** Instead of static filtering or broad-spectrum exposure, employ a dynamically adjustable spectral shaping system during burn-in and ongoing calibration to optimize photobleaching and color uniformity. This moves beyond simply blocking wavelengths *below* a threshold, and instead *sculpts* the light output to precisely target specific materials within the display stack.

**Specs:**

1.  **Light Source:** Array of narrow-band LEDs (e.g., 10nm FWHM) spanning 300nm â€“ 700nm.  Individual LED control via PWM.
2.  **Spectral Sensor:** High-resolution spectrometer integrated into the burn-in/calibration rig.  Monitors reflected light from the display surface.
3.  **Control System:** Microcontroller/FPGA.
    *   Input: Spectral sensor data, user-defined target color profile, display material composition data.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   **Material Response Mapping:** Pre-characterized spectral absorption/emission profiles of all display materials (electronic ink, light guide adhesives, polarizers, etc.).  Stored in lookup table.
        *   **Inverse Modeling:** Algorithm calculates the optimal LED intensity levels to achieve a desired spectral power distribution (SPD) at the display surface, compensating for material absorption/reflection. This is done iteratively, using the spectral sensor as feedback.
        *   **Gradient Detection:**  Analysis of spectral data reveals localized color deviations (gradients). Algorithm adjusts LED intensities to preferentially bleach or stimulate color change in affected areas.
        *   **Burn-in Profiles:**  Pre-defined burn-in profiles tailored to different display types and materials. User adjustable parameters for duration, intensity, and spectral shape.
4.  **Burn-in/Calibration Rig:**
    *   Automated X-Y-Z stage for precise positioning of the display.
    *   Enclosed chamber to minimize ambient light interference.
    *   Temperature control system to maintain consistent operating conditions.
5.  **Software Interface:**
    *   Visualization of SPD and material response curves.
    *   Real-time monitoring of burn-in/calibration progress.
    *   Data logging and analysis tools.

**Pseudocode (simplified control loop):**

```
Initialize:
    Load material response data
    Set initial LED intensities to baseline profile

Loop:
    Read spectral data from sensor
    Calculate error (difference between current SPD and target SPD)
    Adjust LED intensities based on error and material response data
    Apply PWM signals to LEDs
    Wait for short interval (e.g., 100ms)
    If error is below threshold, exit loop
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Explore using machine learning to optimize the inverse modeling algorithm.
*   Incorporate dynamic spectral shaping during normal display operation to compensate for aging and environmental factors.
*   Investigate the use of acousto-optic modulators for even finer control of spectral shaping.
*   Material response profiles can be loaded automatically from a database based on display model number.
*   Implement safety interlocks to prevent exposure to harmful UV radiation.
