## Dynamic Resolution Frame Stitching for Persistent Worlds

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of storing multiple frame formats to create a dynamic resolution system that allows for seamless stitching of frames from varying resolutions and viewpoints to create a persistent, explorable 3D world *from recorded data*.  Essentially, building a navigable environment out of the 'fragments' of streamed gameplay.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Encoding:**

*   **Multi-Resolution Capture:**  The core rendering service will capture *three* simultaneously rendered frames:
    *   **Client Frame:**  Standard resolution, delivered to the client.
    *   **Medium Detail Frame:** (e.g., 1920x1080) -  Used for basic reconstruction and initial playback.
    *   **High Detail Frame:** (e.g., 4K or higher) - Stores full detail for high-fidelity reconstruction.  This frame will leverage a lossy compression scheme optimized for detail preservation (e.g. a more advanced version of AV1).
*   **Viewpoint Data:**  Alongside each frame, record the *camera pose* (position, orientation) and field of view. This includes intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters.
*   **Semantic Segmentation:**  Run a semantic segmentation algorithm on each High Detail Frame to identify objects and surfaces. Store the segmentation map alongside the frame data.
*   **Event Triggers:** Monitor in-game events (player movement, interactions, environmental changes). Store event timestamps and associated metadata with the frames.

**II. Data Storage & Indexing:**

*   **Spatial Partitioning:** Organize the frames using a spatial partitioning scheme (e.g., Octree or KD-Tree).  Each frame is associated with a specific location in the game world.
*   **Frame Graph:** Create a “Frame Graph” where nodes represent frames and edges represent the spatial and temporal relationships between them.  Edge weights can reflect the distance between frames and the time difference.
*   **Metadata Index:** Maintain a separate index for all metadata (camera pose, semantic segmentation, event timestamps).  This index must be searchable based on location, time, object type, and event.
*   **Dynamic LOD:** Store frame data at multiple levels of detail (LOD).  Use the semantic segmentation data to prioritize detail in visually important areas.

**III.  Reconstruction & Navigation:**

*   **Viewpoint Interpolation:** Given a desired viewpoint, the system will search the Frame Graph for nearby frames.  Use the camera pose data to interpolate between the frames and generate a smooth transition.
*   **Mesh Generation:** Use the interpolated frames to generate a temporary mesh representing the visible environment. The semantic segmentation data helps to create more realistic and coherent meshes.
*   **Hole Filling:**  Identify areas where there is insufficient frame coverage and fill the holes using procedural generation or by extrapolating from nearby frames.
*   **Streaming & Caching:**  Stream the necessary frames and meshes to the client on demand. Implement a caching mechanism to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
*   **User Interaction:** Allow users to explore the reconstructed world from any viewpoint. Implement features such as zooming, panning, and rotating.

**Pseudocode (Viewpoint Interpolation):**

```
function interpolateViewpoint(desiredViewpoint, searchRadius):
  nearbyFrames = findFramesWithinRadius(desiredViewpoint, searchRadius)
  if nearbyFrames is empty:
    return defaultViewpoint // Or trigger procedural generation
  
  // Sort frames by distance to desiredViewpoint
  sortedFrames = sortByDistance(nearbyFrames, desiredViewpoint)
  
  // Weight frames based on distance and timestamp
  weightedFrames = calculateWeights(sortedFrames, desiredViewpoint)
  
  // Calculate interpolated camera pose
  interpolatedPose = calculateWeightedAverage(weightedFrames.cameraPose)
  
  return interpolatedPose
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Persistent World Exploration:** Create explorable 3D environments from recorded gameplay data.
*   **Virtual Tourism:** Allow users to experience real-world locations from recorded footage.
*   **Training & Simulation:**  Create realistic training scenarios from recorded data.
*   **Interactive Storytelling:** Allow users to explore and interact with a pre-recorded narrative.
