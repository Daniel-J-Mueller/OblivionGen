## Modular Camera Mount with Integrated Environmental Shielding

**Concept:** A camera mount system designed for extreme environments, utilizing a modular construction with integrated, dynamically adjustable shielding. The base mount remains consistent, while modules are swapped to suit the shooting location.

**Specs:**

*   **Base Mount:** Constructed from carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Universal mounting interface (e.g., Arca-Swiss compatible) with integrated power/data pass-through. Dimensions: 150mm x 100mm x 50mm. Weight: 300g. Includes vibration dampening feet and magnetic attachment points for modular shields.
*   **Modular Shield Types:**
    *   **Rain/Dust Shield:** Rigid, transparent polycarbonate shield. Attaches magnetically to the base mount. Internal hydrophobic coating. Integrated miniature wiper (powered via base mount).
    *   **Thermal Shield:** Multi-layered shield (vacuum-insulated panels + aerogel). Active heating/cooling element (Peltier device) powered via base mount. Temperature control via Bluetooth app.
    *   **Solar Shield:**  Polarizing filter array integrated into a retractable shield. Adjustable polarization via app.  Internal fan for heat dissipation.
    *   **Impact Shield:**  High-density polymer shell with internal energy-absorbing foam. Designed for use in high-impact scenarios (e.g., motorsports).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment System:**
    *   Miniature actuators embedded in the base mount control the angle and position of each shield module.
    *   Actuators controlled by a microcontroller on the base mount.
    *   User interface: Bluetooth app (iOS/Android) for manual control and preset configurations.
    *   Sensors: Integrated temperature, humidity, and light sensors to automatically adjust shield configurations.
*   **Power System:**
    *   Base mount powered by rechargeable lithium-ion battery (USB-C charging).
    *   Battery capacity: 5000mAh (provides up to 8 hours of operation).
    *   Power distribution: Internal power regulator distributes power to actuators, heating/cooling elements, and wiper.
*   **Data Connectivity:**
    *   USB-C port for data transfer and firmware updates.
    *   Bluetooth 5.0 for app control and sensor data logging.
*   **Mounting Interface:**
    *   Universal 1/4"-20 thread.
    *   Arca-Swiss quick release compatible.
    *   Magnetic attachment points for modular shields.

**Pseudocode (shield adjustment):**

```
function adjustShield(shieldType, angle, position):
  //shieldType: string ("rain", "thermal", "solar", "impact")
  //angle: float (degrees)
  //position: float (millimeters)

  if shieldType == "rain":
    activateWiper()
    setAngle(angle)
  else if shieldType == "thermal":
    setTemperature(targetTemperature)
    setAngle(angle)
  else if shieldType == "solar":
    setPolarization(polarizationLevel)
    setAngle(angle)
  else if shieldType == "impact":
    setAngle(angle)

  //Actuator control loop:
  while (currentAngle != targetAngle):
    moveActuator(stepSize)
    currentAngle = readAngleSensor()
```
