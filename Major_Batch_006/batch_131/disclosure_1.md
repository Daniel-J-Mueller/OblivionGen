## Dynamic Data Masking with Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the granular access control to include *dynamic* data masking based on user behavior and query patterns, going beyond simply granting/denying access to tables/views. The system learns typical query behavior for each user/group and proactively masks sensitive data *within* results sets if a query deviates from that behavior, even if the user *has* permissions to access the underlying data.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiler Module:**
    *   **Input:** Database query logs (SQL, parameters, execution time, user ID).
    *   **Process:**
        *   Create a baseline behavioral profile for each user/group based on historical query patterns. This profile should capture:
            *   Frequently accessed tables/columns.
            *   Typical WHERE clause predicates.
            *   Common JOIN conditions.
            *   Aggregate function usage.
        *   Employ anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., clustering, time series analysis, statistical outlier detection) to identify queries that deviate significantly from the established baseline.  Adjust sensitivity thresholds for anomaly detection.
        *   Maintain a rolling window of query history for each user/group.
    *   **Output:**  Anomaly score for each query, a list of potentially sensitive columns accessed by the query.

2.  **Dynamic Masking Engine:**
    *   **Input:**  Original SQL query, anomaly score, list of sensitive columns, database schema.
    *   **Process:**
        *   If the anomaly score exceeds a predefined threshold:
            *   Analyze the SQL query to identify sensitive columns being accessed.
            *   Apply masking transformations to the query result set *before* it's returned to the user. Masking transformations include:
                *   **Redaction:** Replacing sensitive values with a placeholder (e.g., "XXX").
                *   **Substitution:** Replacing sensitive values with a randomized but statistically similar value.
                *   **Aggregation/Generalization:** Replacing specific values with broader categories (e.g., replacing exact age with age range).
                *   **Tokenization:** Replacing sensitive data with a unique token.
            *   Log masking events (user ID, query, masked columns, masking transformation applied).
        *   If the anomaly score is below the threshold, return the original query result.
    *   **Output:**  Modified (masked) query result set or original query result set.

3.  **Policy Management Interface:**
    *   Allow data owners to:
        *   Define sensitive columns for each table.
        *   Configure masking transformations for each sensitive column (e.g., choose between redaction, substitution, aggregation).
        *   Set anomaly detection sensitivity thresholds for different user groups.
        *   Whitelist specific queries or users from anomaly detection.
        *   Review masking event logs.

4.  **Integration with Existing Permissions System:**
    *   The dynamic masking engine should *complement* the existing permissions system, not replace it.  Permissions control *access* to data, while dynamic masking controls *what* data is revealed.  If a user lacks permissions to access a table, dynamic masking is not applied.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Masking Engine):**

```
function mask_query(query, user_id, sensitive_columns, anomaly_score) {

  if (anomaly_score > threshold) {

    masked_result = execute_query(query);

    for each column in masked_result {
      if (column in sensitive_columns) {
        for each row in masked_result {
          if (row[column] is not null) {
            masked_value = apply_masking_transformation(row[column], column);
            row[column] = masked_value;
          }
        }
      }
    }

    return masked_result;

  } else {

    return execute_query(query);

  }
}

function apply_masking_transformation(value, column) {
  // Implement different masking transformations based on column metadata
  // (e.g., redaction, substitution, aggregation)
  // Example:
  if (column == "credit_card_number") {
    return "XXXXXXXXXXXX"; // Redaction
  } else if (column == "age") {
    return round_down_to_nearest_10(value); // Aggregation
  } else {
    return value;
  }
}
```

This system allows for a more proactive and fine-grained approach to data security, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access even when users have legitimate permissions. It moves beyond static access control to a dynamic, behavior-aware security model.
