## Dynamic Revocation Propagation with Federated Learning

**Concept:** Extend the static, scheduled CRL synchronization to a dynamic, peer-to-peer revocation propagation system leveraging federated learning. This builds on the idea of a revocation table but shifts from centralized updates to a distributed, collaborative model.

**Specs:**

**1.  Revocation Signal Generation:**

*   Each service endpoint (acting as a “node”) monitoring client connections generates a local "revocation signal" when a revoked certificate is encountered. This signal includes:
    *   CA Identifier
    *   Certificate Identifier
    *   Timestamp of Revocation Detection
    *   Confidence Level (based on verification attempts - e.g., multiple failed connections)
*   These signals are *not* immediately broadcast. They are stored locally and used to initiate a federated learning round.

**2. Federated Learning Protocol:**

*   **Round Trigger:**  A node initiates a federated learning round when it accumulates a threshold number of unique revocation signals *or* a time interval elapses.
*   **Model:** Each node maintains a local model representing the revocation status of certificates (essentially a distributed revocation table). This model could be a simple key-value store or a more complex probabilistic model.
*   **Aggregation:**  Nodes participating in a round exchange model updates (gradients, parameter deltas – not raw revocation data) with a central aggregator (could be a dedicated service or a distributed consensus mechanism).  Differential privacy techniques should be employed to protect individual client data.
*   **Model Update:** The aggregator combines the updates to create a new, global model. This model is then distributed back to the participating nodes.

**3.  Local Revocation Table Management:**

*   Each node maintains its own local revocation table, initialized from a baseline CRL.
*   The local table is updated *both* through the federated learning process *and* through scheduled CRL downloads.  The federated learning updates are treated as "hints" that may preempt or accelerate CRL updates.
*   A confidence score is associated with each entry in the local table, reflecting the strength of the evidence supporting the revocation status. This score is influenced by both the federated learning updates and the scheduled CRL downloads.

**4.  Connection Handling:**

*   When a connection request is received, the service endpoint checks the local revocation table.
*   If a certificate is found, the revocation status is determined based on the confidence score.
*   If a certificate is *not* found, the service endpoint queries the federated learning system for recent updates (a fast, cache-based lookup).
*   If no definitive revocation status is available, the service endpoint can defer the decision (e.g., log the event for later analysis) or apply a conservative policy (e.g., reject the connection).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Connection Handling):**

```
function handleConnection(clientCertificate):
  localRevocationEntry = lookupLocalRevocationTable(clientCertificate)

  if localRevocationEntry:
    if localRevocationEntry.confidence > threshold:
      return "Certificate Revoked"
    else:
      // Low confidence, consult federated learning
      federatedLearningUpdate = queryFederatedLearning(clientCertificate)
      if federatedLearningUpdate.revoked:
        updateLocalRevocationTable(clientCertificate, revoked=True, confidence=federatedLearningUpdate.confidence)
        return "Certificate Revoked"
      else:
        return "Certificate Valid"
  else:
    // Certificate not found in local table
    federatedLearningUpdate = queryFederatedLearning(clientCertificate)

    if federatedLearningUpdate.revoked:
      updateLocalRevocationTable(clientCertificate, revoked=True, confidence=federatedLearningUpdate.confidence)
      return "Certificate Revoked"
    else:
      // Certificate not found, defer or reject
      return "Certificate Pending" // Or "Connection Rejected"
```

**Key Advantages:**

*   **Real-time Revocation:**  Faster propagation of revocation information compared to scheduled CRL updates.
*   **Scalability:**  Distributed architecture reduces the load on central servers.
*   **Privacy:** Federated learning minimizes the sharing of sensitive client data.
*   **Resilience:**  System remains operational even if some nodes are unavailable.
