## Temporal Data Sculpting with Probabilistic Retention

**Concept:** Expand the logical deletion concept to a system where ‘deleted’ data isn't immediately marked, but instead enters a probabilistic retention phase, dynamically adjusting its retention probability based on access patterns and predicted future utility. This moves beyond simple versioning to create a ‘data sculpture’ that evolves over time.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structure Augmentation:**

*   Each object version will now include:
    *   `version_id`: Unique identifier for the version.
    *   `user_key`: Key associated with the object.
    *   `object_data`: The actual data (may be empty for delete markers or probabilistic versions).
    *   `retention_probability`: A floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0. Initialized at 1.0 for new versions, adjusted over time.
    *   `last_accessed`: Timestamp of the last read/write operation on this version.
    *   `creation_timestamp`: Timestamp of version creation.

**2. Background Process: ‘Data Sculptor’**

*   Runs periodically (configurable interval).
*   Iterates through all object versions.
*   For each version:
    *   Calculate ‘decay factor’ based on `creation_timestamp`, `last_accessed`, and a configurable ‘retention curve’. The retention curve defines how rapidly retention probability decreases over time, with steeper curves indicating faster decay.
    *   Adjust `retention_probability`: `retention_probability` = `retention_probability` * (1 - `decay_factor`).
    *   If `retention_probability` falls below a threshold (configurable), mark the version for potential garbage collection. However, *do not immediately delete it*. Instead, move it to a ‘cold storage’ tier.
    *   Cold storage is monitored for read requests. If a cold version is requested, promote it back to the primary storage tier *and* reset its `retention_probability` to 1.0.

**3. Delete Operation Enhancement**

*   When a delete operation is received (without version ID):
    *   Generate a new version ID.
    *   Create a delete marker object with the new version ID and user key, but *without* object data.
    *   Set the delete marker’s `retention_probability` to a low value (e.g., 0.01) – indicating a high likelihood of eventual removal.
    *   Instead of immediately marking the latest version for deletion, reduce *its* `retention_probability` significantly (e.g., to 0.1). This allows for a grace period in case of accidental deletion or a need to recover the data.

**4. Retrieval Operation Modification**

*   When a retrieval request is received (without version ID):
    *   Identify the latest version with a non-zero `retention_probability`.
    *   If a version is found, return the data.
    *   If no version is found, return an error.
    *   A new function to allow retrieval of any version, given version id.

**5. System API additions:**

*   `get_object_history(user_key)`: Returns a list of version ids.
*   `retrieve_version(user_key, version_id)`: Returns data from a specific version.
*   `set_retention_curve(curve_name)`: Modifies the decay factor curve.

**Pseudocode (Data Sculptor Process):**

```
FOR EACH object_version IN data_store:
  time_since_creation = current_time - object_version.creation_timestamp
  time_since_access = current_time - object_version.last_accessed
  decay_factor = calculate_decay_factor(time_since_creation, time_since_access, retention_curve)
  object_version.retention_probability = object_version.retention_probability * (1 - decay_factor)
  IF object_version.retention_probability < retention_threshold:
    move_to_cold_storage(object_version)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Granular Data Retention:** Enables fine-grained control over data lifespan.
*   **Accidental Deletion Recovery:** Reduces the risk of permanent data loss due to accidental deletions.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Dynamically adjusts storage tier based on access patterns, reducing storage costs.
*   **Data Archaeology:** Allows for the retrieval of older versions for analysis or compliance purposes.
