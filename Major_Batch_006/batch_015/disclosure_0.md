## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Profiling & Prediction

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on distributing speech processing. This builds on that by preemptively adapting acoustic models *before* speech input, based on predicted environmental context. Instead of reacting to unrecognized speech, we anticipate it.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing device microphone array.
    *   Low-power environmental sensor suite: Ambient light, accelerometer (motion detection), barometer (indoor/outdoor), potentially basic air quality sensors.
    *   Dedicated, low-latency co-processor for scene classification (Neural Processing Unit or similar).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Scene Classification Engine:** Trained neural network. Inputs: Sensor data. Outputs: Predicted acoustic scene probability distribution (e.g., "home-quiet-70%", "car-driving-20%", "restaurant-noisy-10%").  Model updated via federated learning.
    *   **Acoustic Model Blending Engine:**  Maintains a library of pre-trained acoustic models optimized for various scenes (home, car, office, outdoors, etc.).  Blends models based on the Scene Classification Engine's output.  Weighted average or more sophisticated mixture density network.
    *   **Predictive Loading Module:** Pre-loads acoustic models based on predicted scene probabilities.  Prioritizes models with high probability.
    *   **Confidence Monitoring:** Tracks the confidence of the Scene Classification Engine.  If confidence is low, reverts to a default acoustic model or initiates a re-classification cycle.

**Pseudocode (Acoustic Model Blending):**

```
// Input: Scene Probability Distribution (e.g., { "home": 0.7, "car": 0.2, "office": 0.1 })
// Input: Library of Pre-trained Acoustic Models (Model_Home, Model_Car, Model_Office)

function blendAcousticModels(sceneProbabilities, modelLibrary):
  blendedModel = new AcousticModel()

  // Weighted average of model parameters
  blendedModel.weights = sceneProbabilities.home * modelLibrary.home.weights +
                         sceneProbabilities.car * modelLibrary.car.weights +
                         sceneProbabilities.office * modelLibrary.office.weights

  blendedModel.means = sceneProbabilities.home * modelLibrary.home.means +
                      sceneProbabilities.car * modelLibrary.car.means +
                      sceneProbabilities.office * modelLibrary.office.means

  // ... other model parameters ...

  return blendedModel
```

**Operation:**

1.  Environmental sensors collect data.
2.  Scene Classification Engine predicts acoustic scene probability.
3.  Predictive Loading Module pre-loads prioritized acoustic models.
4.  Acoustic Model Blending Engine creates a blended model based on predicted probabilities.
5.  Speech processing uses the blended model.
6.  Confidence Monitoring assesses accuracy, and re-classification is initiated if needed.
