## Dynamic Scene Graph Integration for Personalized Overlay Experiences

**Concept:** Extend the existing overlay positioning system by integrating a dynamic scene graph generated *from* the content stream itself, combined with personalized user preference modeling, to create contextually relevant and adaptive overlays.  This goes beyond simply identifying UI elements; it aims to *understand* the content’s structure and meaning.

**Specs:**

**1. Scene Graph Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time content stream (video, game, application).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ computer vision & machine learning to dynamically construct a scene graph representing objects, characters, environments, and significant events within the content.  This is *not* limited to UI elements – it includes everything visible in the primary content.
    *   Nodes in the graph represent objects/entities.  Edges represent relationships (e.g., “character is near object”, “object is part of environment”, “character is interacting with object”).
    *   Utilize object detection, semantic segmentation, and action recognition algorithms.
    *   Graph nodes store metadata: bounding box coordinates, semantic labels (e.g., “tree”, “enemy”, “health bar”), confidence scores, and temporal information (when the object appeared/disappeared).
*   **Output:**  A continuously updated scene graph data structure.

**2. User Preference Model:**

*   **Data Sources:** User profile, viewing history, explicit preferences (e.g., “show stats for this character”, “hide this type of notification”), interaction data (clicks, selections, hovers).
*   **Model:**  A multi-layered model representing:
    *   **Entity Preferences:**  User’s interest in specific entities within the content (e.g., “likes fast-paced characters”, “dislikes lengthy dialogues”).
    *   **Information Needs:**  What information the user typically wants overlaid (e.g., “always show health”, “display resources”).
    *   **Overlay Style:**  Preferred visual style of overlays (e.g., minimalistic, detailed, color schemes).

**3. Overlay Positioning & Adaptation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Scene Graph, User Preference Model.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Relevance Scoring:**  Calculate a relevance score for each entity in the scene graph based on the user’s preferences. Entities matching the user’s interests receive higher scores.
    *   **Overlay Container Generation:** Dynamically generate overlay containers *linked to specific nodes in the scene graph*.  The size, shape, and position of the container are determined by the size and position of the linked entity.
    *   **Prominence Value Adjustment:** Adjust the prominence value of each container based on both the relevance score and the container’s visibility.  Containers representing highly relevant entities that are currently visible receive higher prominence.
    *   **Content Population:** Populate containers with information relevant to the linked entity and the user’s preferences.  This could include stats, descriptions, interactive elements, or notifications.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the scene graph for changes (e.g., objects moving, appearing/disappearing) and dynamically adjust the position, size, and content of the overlay containers in real-time.
*   **Output:** Instructions for updating the user interface with dynamically positioned and adapted overlays.

**Pseudocode (Overlay Positioning & Adaptation Engine):**

```
function UpdateOverlays(sceneGraph, userPreferences):
  overlayContainers = []
  for entity in sceneGraph.nodes:
    relevanceScore = CalculateRelevanceScore(entity, userPreferences)
    if relevanceScore > threshold:
      container = CreateOverlayContainer(entity.boundingbox)
      container.prominence = relevanceScore * entity.visibility
      container.content = GenerateContent(entity, userPreferences)
      overlayContainers.append(container)
  return overlayContainers
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Overlays:**  Use machine learning to predict user actions and proactively display relevant information *before* the user requests it.
*   **Collaborative Overlays:**  Allow multiple users to share and customize overlays, creating a shared viewing experience.
*   **AR/VR Integration:**  Extend the system to support augmented and virtual reality environments, seamlessly integrating overlays into the user’s real-world view.
