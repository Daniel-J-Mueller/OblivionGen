## Predictive Resource Allocation via User Behavior Clustering

**Concept:** Expand on the ‘pre-trigger’ idea, but instead of predicting *specific* subsequent code execution, predict resource needs based on *user behavior clusters*. This moves beyond simple code correlation to a more holistic understanding of user patterns and their resource demands.

**Specification:**

**1. User Behavior Data Collection & Clustering:**

*   **Data Sources:** Collect data on:
    *   Code execution requests (as in the original patent).
    *   User interface interactions (clicks, scrolls, form submissions).
    *   Data input patterns (size, type, format of data being processed).
    *   Session duration.
    *   Frequency of requests.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features from the collected data. Examples:
    *   Code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, lines of code).
    *   UI interaction sequences.
    *   Data volume per request.
    *   Request rate.
*   **Clustering Algorithm:** Employ a machine learning algorithm (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) to group users into distinct behavior clusters. The algorithm should be dynamically retrained periodically (e.g., weekly) to adapt to changing user patterns.
    *   Output: Assign each user to a specific cluster ID.

**2. Cluster-Specific Resource Profiles:**

*   **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk I/O) for each cluster during code execution.
*   **Profile Generation:**  Create resource profiles for each cluster. Each profile will contain:
    *   Average resource usage.
    *   Peak resource usage.
    *   Resource usage variance.
    *   Predicted resource usage based on a time-series model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).

**3. Predictive Resource Allocation:**

*   **Real-time Cluster Identification:**  Identify the cluster a new user belongs to based on their initial behavior.
*   **Proactive Resource Provisioning:**  Based on the cluster's resource profile, proactively provision resources (VM instances, containers, etc.) *before* the user’s code begins execution.  
    *   Allocate sufficient resources to meet the predicted peak demand, with a buffer for unexpected spikes.
    *   Utilize a resource manager (e.g., Kubernetes) to dynamically scale resources based on real-time demand.
*   **Adaptive Resource Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor resource usage during code execution and dynamically adjust resource allocation as needed.
    *   Scale down resources when usage falls below a certain threshold.
    *   Scale up resources when usage exceeds a predefined limit.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Collection Module:** Gathers data from various sources (application logs, UI event streams, system metrics).
*   **Feature Engineering Module:** Extracts meaningful features from the collected data.
*   **Clustering Module:**  Performs user behavior clustering.
*   **Resource Profiling Module:** Generates resource profiles for each cluster.
*   **Resource Manager:**  Manages the allocation and scaling of resources.
*   **Monitoring Module:** Tracks resource usage and system performance.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Logic):**

```
function allocateResources(userSession):
  clusterId = identifyUserCluster(userSession.behaviorData)
  resourceProfile = getResourceProfile(clusterId)
  allocatedResources = provisionResources(resourceProfile.averageUsage + resourceProfile.peakUsageBuffer)

  while userSession is active:
    currentUsage = monitorResourceUsage(userSession)
    if currentUsage > allocatedResources:
      scaleUpResources(userSession, resourceProfile.scaleUpFactor)
    elif currentUsage < allocatedResources * 0.5:
      scaleDownResources(userSession, resourceProfile.scaleDownFactor)
  return allocatedResources
```

**Novelty:** This approach differs from the original patent by shifting the focus from predicting the execution of *specific* code to predicting resource needs based on *user behavior patterns*. It allows for a more generalized and adaptive resource allocation strategy, potentially leading to improved performance and efficiency.  The clustering aspect offers a scalable solution compared to tracking individual code execution sequences.
