## Temporal Graph Reconstruction & Querying

**Concept:** Extend the multi-model graph database to natively support temporal reconstruction and querying *without* requiring explicit time-series data storage or complex application-level temporal logic. Leverage the existing internal data model to represent data as "snapshots" in time, inferred from insertion/update events.

**Specification:**

**1. Temporal Metadata Augmentation:**

*   Modify the internal data model to include implicit temporal metadata for each data element (subject identifier). This isn't a dedicated column; instead, it's derived from insertion/update timestamps.
*   Each insertion/update event associated with a subject identifier is logged with a precise timestamp.
*   The system maintains a “current” state for each subject identifier.  This is simply the last insertion/update timestamp associated with that identifier.

**2. Temporal Query Language Extensions:**

*   Introduce keywords/clauses to the query language (both RDF & Property Graph dialects) to specify temporal constraints. Examples:
    *   `AS_OF timestamp`: Retrieve data as it existed at a specific timestamp.
    *   `BETWEEN timestamp1 AND timestamp2`: Retrieve data that existed within a time range.
    *   `SINCE timestamp`: Retrieve data that existed from a specific timestamp onwards.
    *   `CHANGED_SINCE timestamp`: Retrieve data elements where the value *changed* since a specific timestamp.

**3.  Query Execution & Reconstruction:**

*   When a temporal query is received:
    *   The query planner identifies the temporal constraints.
    *   The system accesses the log of insertion/update events for the relevant subject identifiers.
    *   A "reconstruction engine" filters these events based on the temporal constraints.  
    *   The reconstruction engine produces a "virtual graph" representing the state of the data at the requested time.
    *   The query is executed against this virtual graph.  This reconstruction is transparent to the underlying graph storage.

**4.  Indexing for Temporal Queries:**

*   Create secondary indexes on the insertion/update timestamps associated with subject identifiers.  These indexes will accelerate the reconstruction process. These are *not* indexes on data values themselves, but on event metadata.

**5.  Change Data Capture (CDC) Integration:**

*   Integrate with CDC streams from external data sources. These streams will provide the insertion/update events necessary to maintain the temporal metadata.

**Pseudocode Example (Temporal Query):**

```
// Assuming a property graph query language

MATCH (n:Person {name: "Alice"})
WHERE n.age AS_OF "2023-10-26 10:00:00" > 30
RETURN n;

// Equivalent RDF Query (conceptual)

SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person rdf:type :Person .
  ?person :name "Alice" .
  ?person :age ?age .
  FILTER (?age AS_OF "2023-10-26 10:00:00" > 30)
}
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **Log Management:**  A robust and scalable logging system is crucial for storing insertion/update events.
*   **Reconstruction Performance:** Optimization of the reconstruction engine is critical for handling large datasets and complex temporal queries.
*   **Data Consistency:**  Ensure that the temporal metadata is consistent with the underlying graph data.
*   **Storage Overhead:**  Consider the storage overhead associated with maintaining the insertion/update logs.
