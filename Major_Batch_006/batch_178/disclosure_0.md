## Adaptive Expiration Based on Predictive User Behavior

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust resource expiration times not solely based on request frequency *within* the caching hierarchy, but by *predicting* future user requests using a localized, per-cache-server machine learning model.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of reacting to request patterns, *anticipate* them.  Each cache server maintains a small, rapidly updating ML model trained on its immediate downstream request data. This model predicts the probability of a request for a given resource within a short time window. Expiration times are then set proportionally to this predicted probability. Resources with a high predicted probability of being requested soon have shorter expiration times; those with a low probability have longer times.

**Components:**

*   **Request History Buffer:** Each cache server maintains a rolling buffer of recent requests, including timestamps and resource identifiers.
*   **Localized ML Model:**  A simple model (e.g., a lightweight neural network or a Bayesian classifier) is trained on the request history buffer. The model predicts the probability of a request for a resource within a configurable time window (e.g., 5 minutes).
*   **Expiration Time Calculator:** This module takes the predicted probability from the ML model and maps it to an expiration time.  A configurable function determines this mapping.  Example: `expiration_time = base_time / predicted_probability`. This allows for fine-grained control over how aggressively the system caches resources.
*   **Hierarchy Integration:** While each server makes its own prediction and sets its own expiration time, a simplified summary of the prediction (e.g., a confidence score) can be propagated *up* the hierarchy. This allows higher-level caches to factor in localized demand when making their own caching decisions.

**Pseudocode (Expiration Time Calculator):**

```
FUNCTION calculate_expiration_time(resource_id, predicted_probability, base_time, sensitivity_factor):
  # predicted_probability: Probability of request within time window (0-1)
  # base_time: Default expiration time (e.g., 60 seconds)
  # sensitivity_factor:  Adjusts how aggressively expiration times change
  #   Higher = more sensitive to probability changes

  adjusted_probability = max(0.01, predicted_probability) #Prevent division by zero

  expiration_time = base_time / (1 + sensitivity_factor * (1 - adjusted_probability))

  #Clamp expiration time to a reasonable range.
  expiration_time = clamp(expiration_time, min_expiration, max_expiration)

  RETURN expiration_time
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  A request arrives at a cache server.
2.  The server retrieves the localized ML model.
3.  The model predicts the probability of a future request for the resource.
4.  The expiration time is calculated based on the predicted probability.
5.  The resource is cached (or refreshed) with the calculated expiration time.
6.  The request history buffer is updated.
7.  (Optional) Summary of prediction propagates upwards in the hierarchy.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Cache Hit Rate:** Proactive caching based on predicted demand.
*   **Reduced Latency:**  Resources are more likely to be available when needed.
*   **Adaptive to Changing User Behavior:**  The ML models continuously adapt to new request patterns.
*   **Localized Optimization:** Each cache server optimizes for its immediate downstream demand, leading to more efficient caching.
