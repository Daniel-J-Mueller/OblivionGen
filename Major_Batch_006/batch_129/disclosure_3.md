## Adaptive Multi-Spectral Drone Payload for Material Identification & Grading

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple camera calibration to create a dynamically adjusting multi-spectral imaging payload for drones, focused on real-time material identification and quality grading within materials handling facilities and beyond.

**Specifications:**

*   **Payload Core:** A modular payload containing:
    *   Visible Light Camera (high resolution, calibrated as per the provided patent, serving as a baseline).
    *   Near-Infrared (NIR) Camera (940nm – 1700nm).
    *   Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) Camera (1000nm – 2500nm).
    *   Hyperspectral imager (optional, for advanced applications)
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) & GPS for precise geo-referencing.
*   **Dynamic Spectral Adjustment:**  The core innovation. A system to dynamically adjust the spectral bands captured by the NIR & SWIR cameras based on *real-time analysis* of the visible light image.
    *   **AI-Powered Material Detection:** Integrated AI model trained on a comprehensive dataset of materials commonly found in handling facilities (cardboard, plastics, metals, wood, etc.).
    *   **Spectral Signature Mapping:**  The AI maps visual features to *expected* spectral signatures. For example, if the visible light image identifies a corrugated cardboard box, the system *predicts* the NIR/SWIR reflectance pattern typical of cardboard.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:** The system then *adjusts* the exposure, gain, and filters on the NIR/SWIR cameras to *emphasize* the predicted spectral bands, maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio for that specific material.
    *   **Feedback Loop:**  The captured NIR/SWIR data is then analyzed, and the AI *refines* its spectral prediction based on the actual captured data, creating a continuous learning feedback loop.
*   **Data Processing & Output:**
    *   **Fused Multi-Spectral Image:** Generate a single, fused image incorporating visible light, NIR, and SWIR data.
    *   **Material Classification Map:**  Create a map highlighting different materials within the scene.
    *   **Quality Grading:** For specific materials (e.g., produce), implement algorithms to assess quality based on spectral characteristics (e.g., ripeness, bruising).
    *   **Real-time Data Stream:**  Transmit processed data to a central control system for inventory management, quality control, and automated sorting.
*   **Calibration Protocol:**
    *   Initial calibration leverages the method described in the patent (marker-based for visible light).
    *   Ongoing calibration utilizes onboard reference materials (spectral targets) for NIR/SWIR cameras.
    *   Automated dark/flat field correction procedures.
*   **Pseudocode (Spectral Adjustment Loop):**

```
loop:
    // Capture visible light image
    visibleImage = captureVisibleImage()

    // Run AI model to identify materials
    materialPredictions = aiModel.predict(visibleImage)

    // Determine optimal NIR/SWIR filter settings for each material
    filterSettings = determineFilterSettings(materialPredictions)

    // Apply filter settings to NIR/SWIR cameras
    setNIRFilterSettings(filterSettings["NIR"])
    setSWIRFilterSettings(filterSettings["SWIR"])

    // Capture NIR and SWIR images
    nirImage = captureNIRImage()
    swirImage = captureSWIRImage()

    // Process fused image and generate output
    fusedImage = processFusedImage(visibleImage, nirImage, swirImage)
    output = generateOutput(fusedImage)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated inventory management in warehouses.
*   Quality control of agricultural products.
*   Detection of damaged goods.
*   Waste sorting and recycling.
*   Inspection of construction materials.
