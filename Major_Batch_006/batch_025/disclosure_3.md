## Dynamic Data Granularity & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand upon the adaptive polling by dynamically adjusting *what* data is polled based on user interaction *and* proactively prefetching data based on predicted interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Decomposition:**  Divide the overall data source into granular ‘tiles’ or ‘segments’. These segments are not necessarily visually aligned; they can be based on data relationships or access patterns.
*   **Interaction Mapping:** Implement a system that maps user interactions (clicks, hovers, scrolls, selections) to specific data segments.  This creates an “interaction signature” for each user or user type.
*   **Predictive Model:** Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to predict which data segments a user is likely to interact with *next*, based on their interaction signature and historical data.
*   **Polling Prioritization:**  Prioritize polling frequency not only based on page visibility but also on the predictive model’s confidence level for each data segment. High-confidence segments receive the highest polling priority.
*   **Prefetching Queue:** Maintain a prefetching queue that proactively requests data for segments with a moderate prediction score.  This reduces perceived latency.
*   **Caching Layer:** Employ a multi-tiered caching system. Frequently accessed segments are cached locally on the client, while less frequent segments are cached on the server.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Utilize WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for a persistent, bidirectional communication channel between the client and server.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
interactionSignature = {};
dataCache = {};

// Event Listener (e.g., click event)
function onInteraction(segmentId) {
  interactionSignature[segmentId] = (interactionSignature[segmentId] || 0) + 1;
  sendInteractionToServer(segmentId);
}

function sendInteractionToServer(segmentId) {
    // package interaction signature
    // transmit to server via Websocket
}

// Receive Predicted Segments from Server
function onPredictedSegmentsReceived(predictedSegments) {
  // Update prefetch queue based on predicted segments
  // Request data for segments not already in cache
}

// Receive Data Update from Server
function onDataUpdate(segmentId, data) {
  dataCache[segmentId] = data;
  // Update UI with new data
}
```

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
// Data Source: Granular data segments
dataSegments = {};

// Interaction History: User interaction patterns
userInteractionHistory = {};

// Predictive Model: Trained ML model (LSTM, Transformer)
predictiveModel = loadModel();

// WebSocket Handler
onWebSocketConnection(client) {
    // record client ID
}

// Receive Interaction
onInteractionReceived(client, segmentId) {
    // Update userInteractionHistory[client] with segmentId
    // Predict next segments
    predictedSegments = predictNextSegments(client);
    // Send predicted segments to client
    sendDataToClient(client, predictedSegments);

    // Trigger data update for requested segment
    updateData(segmentId);
}

// Update Data
updateData(segmentId) {
    // Retrieve data from data source
    data = retrieveData(segmentId);
    // Broadcast data update to clients requesting segment
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personalization:** Tailor the predictive model and data granularity to individual users.
*   **Real-time Collaboration:**  Adapt polling frequency based on the number of users viewing/editing the same data.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual access patterns and proactively alert administrators.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Incorporate external factors (time of day, location, device type) into the predictive model.
