## Dynamic Masking via Physiological Response

**Concept:** Expand image masking to be driven by real-time physiological data from the user, creating a dynamically altered visual input tailored to their cognitive load or emotional state. This moves beyond task-specific masking to *user*-specific masking.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate biometric sensors (EEG, GSR, heart rate variability, eye-tracking) into a wearable device (headset, glasses, wristband).
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    *   Real-time acquisition of physiological signals.
    *   Signal processing to extract relevant features:
        *   **Cognitive Load:**  Calculate metrics like EEG spectral power (theta/beta ratio), pupil dilation, and heart rate variability.
        *   **Emotional State:**  Analyze EEG patterns, facial muscle movements (via EMG – potentially integrated into glasses), and GSR to infer emotional states (e.g., stress, focus, boredom).
*   **Masking Engine:**
    *   Develop a machine learning model (trained on individual user data) that maps physiological states to specific masking parameters. This model outputs a ‘masking profile’ based on real-time data.
    *   Masking parameters should include:
        *   **Mask Density:** The proportion of the image obscured.
        *   **Mask Region:**  Areas of the image to be masked (dynamic selection based on gaze tracking and task context).
        *   **Mask Style:**  The visual appearance of the mask (blur, pixelation, color shift, abstract patterns).
*   **Image Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  Capture image data (camera feed).
    2.  Acquire physiological data from sensors.
    3.  Process physiological data to generate a masking profile.
    4.  Apply masking to the image based on the profile.
    5.  Display the masked image.
*   **Calibration:**  Initial calibration phase where the system learns the user’s baseline physiological responses and maps them to desired masking effects.
*   **User Control:** Provide a user interface to adjust the sensitivity of the system and customize masking preferences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    image = captureImage();
    physiologicalData = readSensors();
    maskingProfile = generateMaskingProfile(physiologicalData);

    // Generate mask based on profile
    maskDensity = maskingProfile.density;
    maskRegion = maskingProfile.region;
    maskStyle = maskingProfile.style;

    maskedImage = applyMask(image, maskDensity, maskRegion, maskStyle);
    displayImage(maskedImage);
}

// Function to generate masking profile
function generateMaskingProfile(physiologicalData) {
    cognitiveLoad = calculateCognitiveLoad(physiologicalData);
    emotionalState = detectEmotionalState(physiologicalData);

    // Use ML model to map physiological data to masking parameters
    maskingProfile = ML_Model.predict(cognitiveLoad, emotionalState);

    return maskingProfile;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Focus:** Masking distracting elements during demanding tasks.
*   **Stress Reduction:** Simplifying visuals to calm the user.
*   **Accessibility:**  Customizing visuals for individuals with sensory sensitivities.
*   **Gaming:** Dynamic masking to enhance immersion and challenge.
*   **VR/AR:** Adaptive masking to reduce motion sickness and cognitive overload.
