## Adaptive Network 'Shadowing' & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the multi-path routing concept to proactively 'shadow' data flows *before* congestion or failure occurs, utilizing predictive analytics based on historical performance and real-time environmental data.  Instead of *reacting* to performance degradation, the system anticipates it and pre-establishes alternate paths with reserved resources. This goes beyond simple failover; it's about proactive path optimization.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component:** 'Shadow Path Manager' (SPM) – A distributed system residing within the intermediate computing devices.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical Performance Data (as described in the provided patent).
    *   Real-time Environmental Data: Weather patterns (affecting satellite links), geopolitical events (affecting terrestrial routes), major public events (increasing bandwidth demand), social media trends (predicting spikes in specific content demand – video streaming, etc.). Feeds ingested via APIs.
    *   Network Topology Data: Real-time maps of network infrastructure, including bandwidth capacity, latency, and cost.
    *   Application-Level Data:  If permissible, application-specific data (e.g., video codec, resolution, priority level) can further refine path selection.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Predictive Modeling:** The SPM uses machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression analysis) to predict potential congestion or failures on existing data flows.  Models trained on historical performance data and enriched with real-time environmental factors.
    2.  **Shadow Path Identification:** Based on predictive modeling, the SPM identifies potential alternate paths ('shadow paths'). Multiple shadow paths per primary path, ranked by predicted performance and cost.
    3.  **Resource Reservation:**  The SPM attempts to reserve a small portion of the bandwidth on the shadow paths (e.g., 5-10%).  Reservation implemented via signaling protocols (e.g., RSVP-TE, PCE-MPLS). Reservation is *conditional* – only activated if the primary path degrades.
    4.  **Path Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of both primary and shadow paths.  Metrics include latency, packet loss, jitter, and bandwidth utilization.
    5.  **Adaptive Switching:** If the primary path degrades beyond a defined threshold, the SPM automatically switches traffic to the pre-reserved shadow path. Switching is seamless and transparent to the end-user.
    6.  **Dynamic Resource Adjustment:** The amount of reserved bandwidth on shadow paths is dynamically adjusted based on predictive modeling and real-time conditions.  If congestion is unlikely, bandwidth reservation is reduced.  If congestion is highly probable, bandwidth reservation is increased.
*   **Pseudocode (SPM core loop):**

```
loop:
  # Gather data
  historical_data = get_historical_performance_data()
  environmental_data = get_environmental_data()
  topology_data = get_topology_data()

  # Predict congestion
  congestion_prediction = predict_congestion(historical_data, environmental_data, topology_data)

  # Identify shadow paths
  shadow_paths = identify_shadow_paths(congestion_prediction, topology_data)

  # Reserve resources (if necessary)
  for path in shadow_paths:
    if path.predicted_congestion_risk > threshold:
      reserve_bandwidth(path, reservation_amount)

  # Monitor paths
  primary_path_metrics = monitor_primary_path()
  shadow_path_metrics = monitor_shadow_paths()

  # Adaptive switching
  if primary_path_metrics.degraded:
    switch_to_shadow_path(best_shadow_path)

  # Adjust reservation amounts
  adjust_bandwidth_reservations(shadow_path_metrics)

  sleep(monitoring_interval)
```

    *   `/shadow_paths`: Retrieve available shadow paths for a given data flow.
    *   `/reserve_bandwidth`: Request bandwidth reservation on a shadow path.
    *   `/release_bandwidth`: Release previously reserved bandwidth.
    *   `/path_metrics`: Retrieve real-time performance metrics for a given path.
