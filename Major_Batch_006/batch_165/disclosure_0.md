## Dynamic Recommendation Algorithm ‘Swarming’

**Concept:** Instead of static weighting or A/B testing of recommendation algorithms, create a system where algorithms ‘compete’ in real-time, dynamically adjusting their influence based on immediate user feedback and contextual data. This mimics swarm intelligence, where collective behavior emerges from simple individual actions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Algorithm Pool:** Maintain a diverse pool of recommendation algorithms, as currently described in the patent.  Each algorithm is treated as an ‘agent’.
2.  **Real-Time Feedback Channel:** Implement a high-bandwidth feedback channel from content sites capturing *micro-interactions*. Beyond clicks/purchases, track dwell time on recommended items, scrolling behavior *around* recommendations, mouse movements, and even micro-expressions (via webcam if permission granted).
3.  **‘Pheromone’ System:**  Introduce a ‘pheromone’ concept.  Positive micro-interactions generate ‘positive pheromones’ associated with the algorithm that generated the recommendation. Negative interactions generate ‘negative pheromones’. Pheromone strength decays over time.  Different micro-interactions have different pheromone weights (e.g., purchase = high positive, brief glance = low positive).
4.  **Algorithm Activation Probability:** Each algorithm has an ‘activation probability’.  Initially, this is uniform.  The activation probability is dynamically adjusted based on the algorithm's ‘pheromone score’. Algorithms with high pheromone scores have a higher probability of being selected to generate recommendations for a given user.
5.  **Contextual Modulation:**  Introduce ‘contextual factors’ (time of day, device type, user location, trending topics). These contextual factors *modulate* the pheromone scores. For example, an algorithm specializing in news might have its pheromone score boosted during morning hours.
6.  **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Implement an ‘exploration rate’.  With a certain probability, a random algorithm is selected, regardless of its pheromone score. This encourages the discovery of new, potentially high-performing algorithms.
7.  **Algorithm ‘Migration’:**  Periodically, algorithms are ‘migrated’ to different content sites. This prevents over-specialization and exposes algorithms to a wider range of user behavior.
8.  **‘Algorithm Genome’:**  Each algorithm has a ‘genome’ representing its parameters and configuration. Algorithms can ‘reproduce’ (with mutation) based on their performance, creating new variations.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// For each user request:

1.  Calculate pheromone scores for all algorithms based on recent performance + contextual factors.
2.  Calculate activation probabilities based on pheromone scores.
3.  With probability (exploration_rate):
    Select a random algorithm.
4.  Else:
    Select an algorithm based on weighted random selection using activation probabilities.
5.  Generate recommendations using the selected algorithm.
6.  Capture user micro-interactions.
7.  Update pheromone scores based on micro-interactions.
8.  Periodically:
    Migrate algorithms to new content sites.
    Reproduce algorithms based on performance (with mutation).
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Hyper-personalization:**  Dynamic adaptation to individual user behavior.
*   **Robustness:**  System is less vulnerable to performance degradation of a single algorithm.
*   **Continuous Improvement:**  Algorithms evolve and adapt over time.
*   **Discovery of Novel Algorithms:**  Encourages exploration and experimentation.
