## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping for Audio-Text Synchronization

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple timing synchronization to incorporate emotional resonance between audio and text. The goal is to dynamically adjust the timing *and* presentation of text (visual style, emphasis) to amplify the emotional impact of the audio.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio stream.
*   **Process:** Utilizes a multi-layered machine learning model (combination of pre-trained acoustic models and custom-trained models) to identify and quantify emotional states within the audio.  States include (but aren't limited to): happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutrality.  Output is a time-series of emotional intensity values for each detected state.  Consider using Vocal Feature Extraction (prosody, pitch, timbre) alongside contextual audio analysis (e.g., music genre) for increased accuracy.
*   **Output:**  Time-stamped emotional profile of the audio (e.g., `[{time: 0.5, emotion: 'happiness', intensity: 0.8}, {time: 1.2, emotion: 'sadness', intensity: 0.5}]`).

**2. Textual Sentiment Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Segmented text associated with the audio.
*   **Process:**  Utilizes a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to analyze the sentiment of each text segment.  Output is a sentiment score for each segment (ranging from -1 to 1, representing negative to positive sentiment) and identified keywords contributing to the sentiment.  Account for sarcasm and nuanced language.
*   **Output:**  Time-stamped sentiment profile of the text (e.g., `[{segment: "It was a beautiful day.", sentiment: 0.7}, {segment: "But then the storm came.", sentiment: -0.5}]`).

**3. Resonance Mapping & Synchronization Module:**

*   **Input:** Emotional profile of audio, sentiment profile of text, segmented text.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Resonance Calculation:**  For each text segment, calculate a "resonance score" based on the similarity between its sentiment and the corresponding emotional state in the audio.  Consider a weighted scoring system to prioritize certain emotions or sentiment pairings.  (e.g. high positive sentiment + high happiness emotion = high resonance)
    *   **Dynamic Timing Adjustment:** Adjust the display time of each text segment based on the resonance score. Higher resonance = longer display time (to amplify the emotional impact). Lower resonance = shorter display time (or potentially skipping the segment altogether).
    *   **Visual Styling Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjust the visual styling of the text segment based on the resonance score and the dominant emotion in the audio.  This includes:
        *   **Color:**  Map emotions to specific colors (e.g., happiness = yellow, sadness = blue, anger = red).
        *   **Font Size:** Increase/decrease font size to emphasize emotional intensity.
        *   **Font Weight:**  Bold/italicize text to highlight key emotional words.
        *   **Animation:**  Add subtle animations (e.g., fading, scaling) to enhance emotional impact.  (e.g. fast flickering for anger, slow fading for sadness)
*   **Output:**  Time-stamped instructions for displaying each text segment, including: display time, font color, font size, font weight, animation.

**4.  User Feedback Loop:**

*   Incorporate a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the synchronization and visual styling.  This feedback can be used to refine the machine learning models and personalization algorithms.  (e.g. users can rate the emotional resonance of each segment, or adjust the visual styling manually).

**Pseudocode:**

```
for each text_segment in segmented_text:
    audio_time_range = get_audio_time_range_for_segment(text_segment)
    audio_emotions = get_dominant_emotions(audio_time_range)
    text_sentiment = get_sentiment(text_segment)

    resonance_score = calculate_resonance(audio_emotions, text_sentiment)

    display_time = base_display_time * (1 + resonance_score) # Adjust based on resonance
    font_color = get_color_for_emotion(audio_emotions)
    font_size = base_font_size + (resonance_score * font_size_multiplier)

    display_instructions = {
        "text": text_segment,
        "time": current_time,
        "color": font_color,
        "size": font_size
    }

    current_time += display_time

    output display_instructions
```
