## Dynamic Graph Sharding with Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the graph database permissions model by incorporating dynamic graph sharding based on data sensitivity *and* temporal access rules. Instead of a monolithic graph, data is partitioned into shards. Access isn’t just ‘allowed’ or ‘denied,’ but ‘allowed for *this duration*’ and ‘on *this shard*’. This dramatically increases security and scalability, particularly in environments with fluctuating access needs.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shard Creation Policy:** Implement a policy engine that automatically creates shards based on data sensitivity levels (defined by metadata tags associated with nodes/edges). Sensitivity levels trigger shard assignment. Examples: "Public", "Internal", "Confidential", "Highly Restricted".

2.  **Temporal Access Profiles:** Define access profiles with start/end times for each shard. These profiles map user groups (as defined in the base patent) to shard access windows. Example: “Marketing Group - Access ‘Campaign Data’ shard from 9 AM - 5 PM weekdays”.

3.  **Dynamic Shard Routing:** Modify the path determination algorithm (described in the patent) to include shard awareness. The algorithm must first determine *which shard* the requested data resides on *before* attempting to build a permission path.

4.  **Shard-Aware Path Construction:** The path construction algorithm should prioritize paths that traverse only accessible shards. If a path requires crossing a shard the user doesn't have access to during the current time window, it should be rejected.

5.  **Time Synchronization Layer:** A distributed time synchronization layer (NTP or similar) is required to ensure consistent time across all nodes in the graph database cluster, critical for accurate temporal access control.

6.  **Auditing and Logging:** Implement comprehensive auditing and logging of all shard access attempts, including user, shard, timestamp, and access result.

**Pseudocode (Shard-Aware Path Determination):**

```
function determinePath(userAccount, requestedData):
    shardId = getShardId(requestedData) //Determine which shard the requested data resides on

    if not userHasAccessToShard(userAccount, shardId, currentTime): //Check temporal access
        log("Access Denied: User lacks access to shard", userAccount, shardId, currentTime)
        return null //Access denied

    //Existing path determination algorithm from patent, modified to operate within the 'shardId' scope
    path = determinePathWithinShard(userAccount, requestedData, shardId)

    if path != null:
        log("Access Granted: Path found within shard", userAccount, shardId, currentTime)
        return path
    else:
        log("Access Denied: No path found within shard", userAccount, shardId, currentTime)
        return null
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Scalable distributed graph database cluster.
*   High-precision time synchronization infrastructure.
*   Sufficient storage capacity for graph data and audit logs.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Automated shard merging/splitting based on access patterns and data lifecycle.
*   Integration with external identity providers for enhanced authentication.
*   Real-time shard access monitoring and alerting.
