## Adaptive Honeypot Payload Generation

**Concept:** Extend the honeypotâ€™s ability to mimic services beyond simply *appearing* to be a functioning system. Dynamically generate plausible, albeit non-functional, *payloads* in response to requests, increasing engagement and data collection from attackers. This moves beyond simple banner grabbing and port scanning detection.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Payload Template Library:** A repository of modular payload templates, categorized by service type (HTTP, FTP, SSH, DNS, etc.). Templates define the structure of a response, with placeholders for dynamic content. Examples:
    *   HTTP: Basic HTML page with placeholders for headers, body content, forms, links.
    *   SSH: Initial exchange sequence with placeholders for key exchange algorithms, server banners.
    *   FTP: Directory listing with placeholder filenames, sizes, and dates.
*   **Component 2: Contextual Data Generator:**  An AI-driven module responsible for populating the payload template placeholders with contextual data. This data should be *plausible* but not functional. Data sources include:
    *   Random data generators (for usernames, passwords, file contents).
    *   Markov chains trained on publicly available datasets (to generate realistic-looking text, code, or data).
    *   External APIs (to retrieve plausible-looking data, like IP addresses, domain names, or geographical locations).
*   **Component 3:  Request Analyzer:** This component inspects incoming requests to determine the expected response type and parameters. It then selects the appropriate payload template and passes it to the Contextual Data Generator.  Focus on analysis of HTTP headers, URI paths, and any included data.
*   **Component 4:  Engagement Monitor:** Tracks attacker interaction with generated payloads (e.g., form submissions, file downloads, command execution attempts).  This data informs the Contextual Data Generator to refine its payload generation, making it more realistic and engaging.  Tracks time spent interacting, data submitted, and any attempted exploits.
*   **Component 5: Adaptive Difficulty Scaling:** Based on the Engagement Monitor's data, the system automatically adjusts the complexity and realism of the generated payloads.  Begin with simple, easily-detectable responses, then gradually increase complexity and realism as the attacker demonstrates persistent engagement.

**Pseudocode (Request Handling):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  requestType = analyzeRequest(request)
  template = selectTemplate(requestType)
  if template == null:
    return defaultErrorResponse()

  payloadData = generatePayloadData(template)
  response = constructResponse(payloadData)
  logInteraction(request, response)
  return response

function generatePayloadData(template):
  // Populate template placeholders with contextual data
  data = {}
  if template.type == "HTTP":
    data["html_content"] = generateRealisticHTML()
    data["headers"] = generateCommonHTTPHeaders()
  else if template.type == "SSH":
    data["banner"] = generateSSHBanner()
    data["key_exchange_algorithms"] = selectKeyExchangeAlgorithms()
  // ... other template types

  return data
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Standard server hardware.
*   Operating system: Linux (preferred).
*   Programming languages: Python, C++.
*   AI/ML libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
*   Database:  PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
