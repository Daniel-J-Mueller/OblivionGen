## Dynamic Contextual Reflow for Scanned Documents

**Core Concept:** Extend the broken word correction system to proactively *reflow* scanned text based on contextual understanding, not just positional correction. This goes beyond fixing broken words to intelligently re-formatting entire paragraphs or sections for improved readability on different screen sizes or for accessibility purposes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Input:**

*   OCR output (text and bounding box data) from scanned document.
*   Original document image (for visual context).
*   Target display dimensions/device type (e.g., phone, tablet, large screen).
*   User-defined reading preferences (font size, line spacing, column width, justification).

**2. Processing Pipeline:**

*   **Semantic Segmentation:** Employ a deep learning model (e.g., Mask R-CNN) to segment the document image into logical blocks: paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, images, captions. This uses visual cues *in addition* to OCR output to improve accuracy.
*   **Contextual Analysis:**  Process the OCR text using a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM identifies sentence boundaries, paragraph structure, and semantic relationships between blocks. This also detects ambiguities or potentially broken phrases which need review.
*   **Reflow Algorithm:** This is the core. It's a constraint-satisfaction problem with the following:
    *   **Constraints:** Maintain logical reading order, preserve heading/paragraph hierarchy, avoid breaking sentences across lines, minimize whitespace, adhere to user preferences.
    *   **Objective Function:** Maximize readability based on metrics like line length variation, whitespace distribution, and visual flow. The system needs to consider the average sentence length of the entire text.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** If the initial reflow fails to meet readability thresholds, the algorithm should relax constraints or dynamically adjust the target output format (e.g., switch from a multi-column layout to a single-column layout).
*   **Visual Validation:**  Re-render the reflowed text overlaid on the original document image. This allows the user to visually verify the accuracy of the reflow and manually correct any errors.
*   **Bounding Box Adjustment:** Update the bounding box coordinates for each word or phrase to reflect the new layout. This ensures that the text remains synchronized with the original document image.

**3. Output:**

*   Reflowed text with updated bounding box coordinates.
*   A visual representation of the reflowed text overlaid on the original document image.
*   A file format that preserves the original document's structure and formatting (e.g., PDF with embedded text layers).

**Pseudocode (Reflow Algorithm):**

```
function reflow_document(ocr_text, original_image, target_dimensions, user_preferences):
  semantic_blocks = segment_image(original_image)
  blocks_with_text = enrich_blocks_with_text(semantic_blocks, ocr_text)
  optimized_layout = generate_initial_layout(blocks_with_text, target_dimensions, user_preferences)

  while not is_layout_optimized(optimized_layout):
    adjust_layout(optimized_layout, constraint_violation)  //Relax constraints or try alternative formatting
    if max_iterations_reached():
        break

  final_layout = apply_final_formatting(optimized_layout)
  return final_layout
```

**Novelty:** This differs from the provided patent by moving *beyond* simple positional correction to a proactive, intelligent reflow of the entire document. The use of semantic segmentation and LLMs brings a level of contextual understanding that enables truly adaptive and readable document rendering. The focus is less on fixing errors, and more on *enhancing* the reading experience by intelligently restructuring the content for the target device and user preferences.
