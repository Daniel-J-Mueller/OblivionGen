**Adaptive Resonance Antenna System**

**Concept:** Leverage the capacitive loading concept, but instead of a static metal element, create a dynamically adjustable capacitive surface controlled by a micro-controller. This allows for real-time tuning of the antenna based on user proximity *and* environmental RF interference.

**Specifications:**

*   **Antenna Structure:** Loop antenna, similar to claim 10, embedded within the housing of the ear-worn device. PCB ground and RF feed established.
*   **Capacitive Surface:** A grid of individually addressable capacitive elements (small metal pads) placed on the outer housing surface, directly overlying the loop antenna’s distal point (as described in claim 10). Each element connected to a dedicated pin of a micro-controller (e.g., ESP32, STM32).  Material: Conductive Ink on flexible substrate.
*   **Proximity Sensing:** Capacitive touch sensor IC (e.g., QTouch) integrated with each capacitive element. This creates a high-resolution proximity map of the user’s ear and surrounding environment.
*   **Micro-controller Firmware:**
    *   **Initialization:** Scan the capacitive grid to establish a baseline reading of the user's ear position during initial setup.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the capacitive readings.  If a change is detected (user movement, obstruction), the micro-controller adjusts the capacitance of individual elements by enabling/disabling them (using a digital I/O pin to effectively switch a small shunt resistor).  The goal is to maintain optimal impedance matching (target of -6dB as stated in claims 6, 7, 15, 16) despite changing conditions.
    *   **RF Interference Mitigation:** Implement an algorithm to analyze RF signal strength across different frequencies. If interference is detected, the micro-controller can *intentionally* shift the antenna’s resonant frequency by subtly adjusting the capacitive load – essentially creating a dynamic notch filter.  Algorithm should prioritize maintaining connection quality for primary communication band (e.g. 2.4 GHz).
    *   **Calibration Routine:** User-initiated calibration sequence to optimize performance for specific ear shapes and environmental conditions.
*   **Power Management:** Low-power sleep mode for capacitive sensing circuit when not actively adjusting.  Wake-on-change interrupt triggered by proximity sensor IC.
* **Communication Protocol:** I2C or SPI communication between Proximity Sensor IC, Micro-controller, and audio processing unit.
* **Housing Materials:** Dielectric material to minimize parasitic capacitance.



**Pseudocode (Micro-controller Firmware – Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
baselineCapacitanceMap = readCapacitanceMap();

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  currentCapacitanceMap = readCapacitanceMap();
  deltaMap = currentCapacitanceMap - baselineCapacitanceMap;

  // Adjust Capacitance based on deltaMap
  for (each element in deltaMap) {
    if (abs(element) > threshold) {
      if (element > 0) {
        // Increase capacitance - enable shunt resistor
        setShuntPin(element, HIGH);
      } else {
        // Decrease capacitance - disable shunt resistor
        setShuntPin(element, LOW);
      }
    }
  }

  // RF Interference Detection and Mitigation
  if (detectRFInterference()) {
    adjustResonantFrequency();
  }

  delay(10ms);
}
