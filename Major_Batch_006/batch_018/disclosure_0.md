**Dynamic Topology Simulation with Predictive Branching**

**Concept:** Extend the concentric ring visualization to incorporate real-time network traffic simulation *and* predictive branching for potential network reconfiguration. The current patent visualizes static hierarchical data. This builds on that by layering live data and forecasting.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with network monitoring tools (SNMP, NetFlow, sFlow) to collect real-time bandwidth usage, latency, and packet loss data for each network node. Supplement with historical data for trend analysis.
*   **Visualization Layering:**
    *   **Base Layer:** Maintain the concentric ring structure as defined in the patent. Rings represent hierarchy (Network, Subnet, Node).
    *   **Dynamic Overlay:** Add a shimmering, color-coded overlay representing real-time traffic. Intensity/color represents bandwidth utilization (Green=low, Yellow=moderate, Red=high). The shimmer should be subtle but noticeable, adding a layer of 'aliveness'.
    *   **Predictive Branching:** When a node (innermost ring element) approaches capacity, the system dynamically generates ‘branching’ visualizations. These appear as translucent, animated lines extending from the overloaded node to potential alternate routes or available resources (other nodes or network segments). Branching lines should be weighted based on predicted latency/cost to traverse. The branching should feel like an expanding 'tree' of possibilities.
*   **User Interaction:**
    *   **Branch Selection:** Allow users to *select* a predictive branch. Selecting a branch initiates a simulated ‘test’ – a small amount of traffic is routed along the branch, and the impact on latency/bandwidth is displayed in real-time on the visualization.
    *   **Automated Reconfiguration:** Include a toggle to enable automated reconfiguration. When enabled, the system will automatically select and implement the ‘optimal’ branch when a threshold is exceeded (based on predefined criteria).
    *   **Historical Analysis:** Integrate a time slider allowing users to rewind and replay network activity. The visualization should dynamically update to reflect the network state at any point in time.
*   **Pseudocode (Branch Prediction Algorithm):**

```
function predictBranches(node, currentLoad, historicalData):
  availableResources = getAvailableResources(node)
  potentialRoutes = calculateRoutes(node, availableResources)
  for route in potentialRoutes:
    predictedLatency = calculatePredictedLatency(route, historicalData)
    predictedCost = calculatePredictedCost(route)
    route.weight = predictedLatency * predictedCost  // Lower weight = better route
  sort routes by weight
  return top N routes
```

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Node`: Contains node ID, current load, capacity, connected nodes.
    *   `Route`: Contains a list of nodes, predicted latency, predicted cost, weight.
*   **Hardware Considerations:** High-performance CPU/GPU for real-time data processing and visualization. Large RAM to store historical data.
*   **Scalability:** System should be designed to handle large-scale networks with thousands of nodes. Utilize distributed processing techniques to improve performance.
