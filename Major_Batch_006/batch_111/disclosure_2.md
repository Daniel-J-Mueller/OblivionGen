## Dynamic Network Topology Obfuscation via Encrypted Beaconing

**Concept:** Expand on the private network address obfuscation by layering a dynamic topology obfuscation scheme. Instead of *just* hiding endpoint addresses, actively *change* the perceived network topology from the outside, making reconnaissance significantly more difficult. This is achieved via encrypted beaconing and coordinated address shuffling.

**Specs:**

*   **Beaconing Agents:** Deploy lightweight agents on each endpoint within the private network. These agents are responsible for periodic “beacon” transmissions.
*   **Beacon Payload:** Each beacon contains:
    *   Encrypted "Topology Signature":  A cryptographic hash of the current internal network topology (endpoint addresses, relationships, etc.).  The encryption key is rotated periodically.
    *   "Ephemeral Address":  A randomly generated, short-lived IPv6 address.
    *   "Shuffle Flag": A boolean indicating whether this endpoint's apparent connectivity should be re-routed (based on a master schedule – see below).
*   **Border Device Coordination:** The border device (as defined in the patent) manages:
    *   **Master Schedule:** A pre-defined schedule outlining which endpoints should ‘shuffle’ their apparent connectivity at what intervals.  Complexity is a feature – the schedule should be non-deterministic, and potentially adaptive to observed reconnaissance attempts.
    *   **Address Pool:**  A pool of IPv6 addresses reserved for ephemeral use.
    *   **Topology Map:**  An internal map of the *actual* network topology.
*   **Shuffle Mechanism:** When an endpoint’s Shuffle Flag is set:
    1.  The border device assigns a new ephemeral IPv6 address to the endpoint from the pool.
    2.  Routing tables are dynamically updated to route traffic destined for the endpoint’s *old* address to a designated ‘sinkhole’ or to a different, valid endpoint.
    3.  Traffic destined for the *new* ephemeral address is routed correctly.
*   **Key Rotation:** Encryption keys for the Topology Signature are rotated frequently (e.g., every few minutes) using a secure key exchange protocol.
*   **Sinkhole Functionality:** The sinkhole is a null route, but also logs all attempts to connect, providing an early warning of reconnaissance.

**Pseudocode (Border Device):**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Address Pool
Initialize Master Schedule
Initialize Topology Map

// Main Loop
For each incoming packet:
    If destination address is in Address Pool:
        Route to correct internal endpoint based on Topology Map
    Else If destination address belongs to a shuffled endpoint:
        Redirect to Sinkhole & Log attempt
    Else:
        Route normally

For each beacon received:
    Decrypt Topology Signature
    Verify signature against expected value (based on Master Schedule)
    Update internal view of network topology
    Assign new ephemeral address if Shuffle Flag is set
    Update routing tables

// Master Schedule Update (Periodic)
Generate new Master Schedule (non-deterministic)
Distribute updated Schedule to endpoints (securely)
```

**Innovation:**  This isn’t *just* hiding addresses, it's actively manipulating the *perception* of the network.  An attacker attempting to map the network will see a constantly shifting landscape, making accurate reconnaissance extremely difficult.  The sinkhole provides an additional layer of defense and intelligence gathering. The ephemeral addresses and the changing routing dynamically obfuscate the actual network topology. The border device, as described in the source patent, coordinates these changes, dynamically re-routing connections as necessary.
