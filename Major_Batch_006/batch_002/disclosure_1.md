## Dynamic Data Sheet ‘Views’ with Temporal Awareness

**Specification:** A system extending the dynamically materialized views concept to incorporate a time-dimension, allowing users to explore ‘versions’ of the data sheet at specific points in time, and to visualize changes over time.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of simply re-executing queries against the current state of the data, this system stores ‘snapshots’ of the materialized view results *along with* a timestamp indicating when that snapshot was taken.  These snapshots are indexed by timestamp.

**Components:**

*   **Snapshot Engine:**  Responsible for capturing the results of materialized view queries at regular intervals, or on-demand (triggered by user action or data updates). It stores the results alongside metadata including the timestamp, user who triggered the snapshot (if applicable), and a hash of the underlying data (to detect inconsistencies).
*   **Temporal Query Interface:**  An extension to the existing query language.  This allows users to specify a `TIMESTAMP` or `TIME RANGE` as part of their queries.  The system will then retrieve the materialized view result corresponding to that time.  Example: `QUERY X TIMESTAMP '2024-10-27 10:00:00'`.
*   **Visualization Layer:**  A module to display changes over time.  This could include:
    *   **Time-Slider:** A slider control allowing the user to scrub through time, dynamically updating the data sheet view.
    *   **Difference Highlighting:**  Option to highlight the differences between the current view and a previous view at a selected timestamp.
    *   **Animation:**  Ability to animate the changes between two or more timestamps.
*   **Delta Storage:** Instead of storing full snapshots, utilize delta storage. Only store the *changes* between snapshots, reducing storage requirements.  This requires a robust diffing algorithm capable of handling the data sheet structure.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Query Processing):**

```
FUNCTION processTemporalQuery(query, timestamp)
  // Check if timestamp is provided.
  IF timestamp IS NULL
    // Use current snapshot.
    snapshot = getLatestSnapshot()
    result = executeQuery(query, snapshot.data)
    RETURN result
  ELSE
    // Retrieve snapshot at the specified timestamp.
    snapshot = getSnapshot(timestamp)
    IF snapshot IS NULL
      // No snapshot available at that time.  Handle gracefully (e.g., return error, or interpolate from nearby snapshots).
      RETURN "No data available for this timestamp"
    ELSE
      // Execute query against the snapshot data.
      result = executeQuery(query, snapshot.data)
      RETURN result
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION executeQuery(query, data)
  // Execute the query against the materialized view data.
  // This is the existing query execution logic.
  // RETURN result
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Financial Modeling:** Track changes in financial data over time, and visualize the impact of different scenarios.
*   **Project Management:**  Monitor project progress, and see how tasks have evolved over time.
*   **Data Auditing:**  Reconstruct the state of the data sheet at any point in time for auditing purposes.
*   **Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to work on different ‘versions’ of the data sheet, and easily compare their changes.
