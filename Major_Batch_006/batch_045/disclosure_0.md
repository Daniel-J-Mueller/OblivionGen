## Data Report Orchestration with Predictive Pre-Fetching & Dynamic Schema Stitching

**Specification:** A system extending the core data retrieval capabilities to proactively anticipate report needs and dynamically construct unified schemas from heterogeneous data sources *before* the report request is fully defined. This moves beyond reactive query plan generation to a predictive, schema-aware retrieval model.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of waiting for a complete report request (syntax tree) to arrive, the system maintains ‘report profiles’ – statistical models of likely report requests based on user behavior, historical data, and time-series analysis. These profiles predict the data attributes, conditions, and ordering likely to be used in future reports.

**Components:**

1.  **Report Profiler:** A module that analyzes historical report requests and user behavior to create statistical report profiles.  These profiles capture probabilities of attribute selection, condition ranges, ordering preferences, and frequently co-requested attributes. It employs a Bayesian approach, updating probabilities as new requests arrive.

2.  **Predictive Data Prefetcher:** Based on active report profiles, this component proactively fetches data from various datastores *before* a request is received.  It prioritizes data based on prediction confidence and estimated retrieval latency. Data is stored in a tiered cache (in-memory, SSD, etc.) to optimize access speed.  Prefetched data is versioned and time-stamped for consistency.

3.  **Dynamic Schema Stitcher:** A critical component that dynamically constructs a unified schema from the heterogeneous data sources.  Instead of generating schemas on-demand for each request, the system maintains a library of potential schemas based on common attribute combinations. This library is expanded and refined based on prefetching activity. It leverages techniques like schema mapping, data type conversion, and attribute renaming to create a consistent view of the data.

4.  **Hybrid Query Engine:** This engine combines reactive and proactive query execution. When a report request arrives, it checks if the requested data is already available in the cache. If so, the engine retrieves the data directly. If not, it generates a query plan as in the original patent, but it *also* updates the report profiles and prefetcher for future requests.

**Pseudocode (Hybrid Query Engine):**

```
FUNCTION processReportRequest(reportRequest):
    cacheHit = checkCache(reportRequest)

    IF cacheHit:
        reportData = retrieveFromCache(reportRequest)
        RETURN reportData
    ELSE:
        //Original patent logic for query plan generation
        storageMetadata = getStorageMetadata()
        queryPlan = generateQueryPlan(reportRequest, storageMetadata)
        reportData = executeQueryPlan(queryPlan)

        // Update predictive components
        updateReportProfile(reportRequest, reportData)
        prefetchData(reportRequest, reportData)

        RETURN reportData
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION prefetchData(reportRequest, reportData):
    predictedAttributes = predictNextAttributes(reportRequest)
    IF predictedAttributes != NULL:
        prefetchDataForAttributes(predictedAttributes) //Async operation
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION predictNextAttributes(reportRequest):
    //Utilize report profiler to determine likely next attributes
    //Based on historical co-occurrence and user behavior
    RETURN predictedAttributes
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Report Profile:** `{reportId: INT, attributeProbabilities: MAP(STRING, FLOAT), conditionRanges: MAP(STRING, RANGE), orderingPreferences: LIST(STRING), coRequestedAttributes: LIST(STRING)}`
*   **Schema Library:** `{schemaName: STRING, attributes: LIST(ATTRIBUTE), sourceDatastores: LIST(DATASTORE)}`

**Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Latency:** Prefetching data significantly reduces report generation time.
*   **Improved Scalability:** Proactive data retrieval distributes the load across datastores.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** Faster report generation improves user satisfaction.
*   **Dynamic Adaptability:** The system learns from user behavior and adapts to changing data patterns.
