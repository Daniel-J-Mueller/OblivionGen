## Dynamic Expression Dependency Graph & Predictive Re-evaluation

**Concept:** Expand beyond cell-level dependency tracking to a full expression dependency graph, and proactively re-evaluate expressions *before* a user interaction requires it, based on predicted data changes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Graph Generation:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A directed acyclic graph (DAG). Nodes represent expressions. Edges represent data dependencies (i.e., expression A uses the output of expression B).
*   **Automatic Discovery:** System monitors expression definitions and data sheet interactions to *automatically* construct and maintain the dependency graph.  No manual definition required.
*   **Granularity:**  Dependencies tracked at the individual cell *and* expression level.  Expressions referencing other expressions create edges within the graph.
*   **Metadata:** Each edge stores the type of dependency (direct cell reference, formula component, etc.) and a 'staleness' timestamp (last time the dependent data was updated).
*   **Graph Storage:** Persist the graph in a dedicated repository (separate from data and expressions) optimized for graph traversals.

**2. Predictive Re-evaluation Engine:**

*   **Change Propagation:** When a cell is modified, the system traverses the dependency graph *forward* from the modified cell.
*   **Staleness Threshold:** Each edge has a configurable 'staleness threshold' (e.g., 500ms). If the dependent expression hasn't been re-evaluated since the data changed exceeds the threshold, it's flagged for re-evaluation.
*   **Prioritization:** Expressions are prioritized for re-evaluation based on:
    *   **Depth in Graph:** Expressions closer to the original data change are re-evaluated first.
    *   **User Visibility:** Expressions powering data displayed in the currently active part of the application are given highest priority.
    *   **Computational Cost:**  Estimate the time to re-evaluate each expression and prioritize lower-cost expressions.
*   **Asynchronous Evaluation:** Re-evaluation happens in the background on dedicated worker threads/processes.
*   **Cache Invalidation:**  Invalidate cached results of re-evaluated expressions.
*   **Proactive Updates:** If a change cascades through the graph and affects an expression powering a display element, *immediately* update the display element with the new value (without waiting for user interaction).

**3. System Components:**

*   **Dependency Graph Builder:** Monitors data sheet changes and builds/updates the dependency graph.
*   **Re-evaluation Scheduler:**  Manages the queue of expressions to be re-evaluated and distributes tasks to worker threads.
*   **Expression Evaluator:**  Executes expressions and returns results.
*   **Cache Manager:** Stores and invalidates cached expression results.
*   **Display Update Handler:** Receives updated values from the Expression Evaluator and updates the corresponding display elements.

**4. Pseudocode (Re-evaluation Scheduler):**

```
function schedule_re_evaluation(cell_id, data_change_timestamp):
  graph = get_dependency_graph()
  nodes = graph.get_nodes_dependent_on(cell_id)

  for node in nodes:
    staleness = current_time - node.last_evaluated
    if staleness > node.staleness_threshold:
      task = create_evaluation_task(node)
      add_task_to_queue(task)

function create_evaluation_task(node):
  task = {
    'expression': node,
    'priority': calculate_priority(node)
  }
  return task

function calculate_priority(node):
  priority = 0
  if node.is_visible:
    priority += 100
  priority += 1 / node.complexity  // Lower complexity = higher priority
  return priority
```

**Innovation:**  This moves beyond reactive dependency tracking to *proactive* dependency management, potentially eliminating perceived latency and improving user experience. The automatic graph construction and prioritization mechanisms minimize overhead and optimize resource allocation.  This differs significantly from simply caching results. It is a system which predicts and reacts, rather than simply reacting.
