## Dynamic Transactional Zones & Reputation Weighting

**Concept:** Expand the location-based authorization beyond simple proximity. Implement dynamic, user-defined transactional zones overlaid onto geographical locations, combined with a reputation weighting system for both transacting entities. This shifts authorization from *just* location to a combination of trust, pre-defined zones, and real-time contextual data.

**Specifications:**

**I. Dynamic Zone Creation & Management (Client-Side & Server-Side)**

*   **Zone Types:**
    *   *Personal Zones:* User-defined areas (circles, polygons) with associated trust levels (e.g., "High Trust - Family/Close Friends," "Medium Trust - Known Contacts," "Low Trust - Potential Risk").  Stored on user's device and optionally synchronized to the server.
    *   *Event Zones:* Temporary zones created around events (concerts, meetings, deliveries).  Triggered by event data (calendar invites, location beacons) and automatically expire.
    *   *Business Zones:* Geofences defined by businesses for accepting transactions (retail stores, restaurants, service areas).
*   **Zone Overlay:** Mobile app displays a map with overlaid zones representing different trust levels. User visually defines/adjusts zones.
*   **Server Synchronization:** User zones are securely stored and synchronized across devices.
*   **API:**  Public API for 3rd party integration (event organizers defining event zones, businesses defining business zones).

**II. Reputation Weighting System**

*   **Reputation Score:** Each user/entity (merchant, other user) has a dynamic reputation score.
*   **Score Calculation:** Based on:
    *   Transaction History: Successful transactions increase the score, failed/disputed transactions decrease it.
    *   User Feedback: Ratings and reviews from other users.
    *   Social Graph Integration: Trust relationships from linked social networks (LinkedIn, Facebook).
    *   Verified Identity: Completion of KYC/AML checks.
*   **Weighting Factors:** Configurable weighting for each factor (e.g., verified identity has higher weight than social graph).
*   **Decay Mechanism:** Reputation scores decay over time to prevent outdated information from skewing results.

**III. Transaction Authorization Logic**

*   **Initial Check:** Determine if the transacting entities are associated with a shared zone.
*   **Reputation Thresholds:** Configurable thresholds for minimum acceptable reputation scores for each zone type.
*   **Combined Score:** Calculate a combined authorization score based on:
    *   Zone Compatibility (how well the transaction fits within the defined zone).
    *   Reputation Scores of both entities.
    *   Transaction Amount (higher amounts require stricter authorization).
*   **Dynamic Adjustments:** Adjust authorization thresholds based on real-time contextual data (e.g., time of day, location density, reported crime rates).
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function authorizeTransaction(transaction, user1, user2) {
  zoneCompatibility = calculateZoneCompatibility(transaction, user1, user2)
  reputationScore1 = getUserReputation(user1)
  reputationScore2 = getUserReputation(user2)
  transactionAmount = transaction.amount
  contextualData = getContextualData()

  authorizationScore = (zoneCompatibility * weightZone) +
                      (reputationScore1 * weightRep1) +
                      (reputationScore2 * weightRep2) +
                      (contextualData * weightContext)

  if (authorizationScore >= authorizationThreshold) {
    approveTransaction(transaction)
    return true
  } else {
    declineTransaction(transaction)
    return false
  }
}
```

**IV. User Interface (Mobile App)**

*   **Map View:** Displays user’s location, defined zones, and nearby transacting entities.
*   **Zone Editor:** Tool for creating and adjusting zones.
*   **Reputation Dashboard:** Shows user’s reputation score and factors influencing it.
*   **Transaction History:** Detailed record of past transactions, including authorization scores.
*   **Trust Settings:** Allows users to customize trust levels for different zone types and entity categories.
