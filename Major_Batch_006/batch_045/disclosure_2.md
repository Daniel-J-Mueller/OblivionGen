## Adaptive Pre-Session Environment Control

**Concept:** Extend the pre-session initialization beyond camera systems to encompass environmental controls (lighting, spatial audio, display settings) on both sender and receiver devices, adapting these controls *predictively* based on historical session data and real-time analysis of the initiating command.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Profiling Module:**

*   **Historical Session Data:** Each device stores a profile capturing environmental settings (lighting intensity/color temp, audio profile/spatialization, display calibration) for past communication sessions with specific contacts. This data is timestamped and tagged with communication context (e.g., "work meeting," "casual chat," "video presentation").
*   **Command Analysis:** When a communication command is received, the system analyzes the command’s metadata (e.g., detected keywords – "presentation", "brainstorm", "quick check-in",  “urgent”) and sender/receiver relationship (frequency of communication, typical session length).
*   **Contextual Inference:** Based on historical data and command analysis, the system infers the *likely* environmental requirements of the upcoming session. This inference is probabilistic - assigning confidence scores to different environmental profiles.
*   **Presence & Sensor Data Integration:** Integration with device sensors (ambient light sensors, microphones for noise detection, cameras for detecting user activity/location within a room) to refine the environmental profile in real-time.

**2. Predictive Environmental Control Engine:**

*   **Profile Selection:** Based on the contextual inference, the system selects the most appropriate environmental profile for both sender and receiver.
*   **Adaptive Adjustment:**  Initiates automated adjustments to device settings:
    *   **Lighting:** Adjusts brightness, color temperature, and direction of device-integrated or connected smart lighting.
    *   **Audio:**  Selects appropriate audio profiles (e.g., noise cancellation, spatial audio for immersive experience), adjusts volume levels, and optimizes microphone sensitivity.
    *   **Display:** Calibrates display settings (brightness, contrast, color balance) for optimal viewing experience. Potentially activates/adjusts connected displays.
    *   **Spatial Audio Mapping**: Detects positions of users within a room via device cameras and adjusts the spatial audio rendering accordingly.
*   **Dynamic Calibration**: Continues to monitor environmental conditions and session activity during the session and dynamically adjusts settings in response to changes. (e.g., if a window is opened, increasing display brightness).

**3. User Override & Learning:**

*   **Manual Control**: Users retain full manual control over all environmental settings.
*   **Learning Algorithm**: The system learns from user overrides. If a user consistently adjusts settings away from the predicted profile, the system updates the historical data and refines the prediction algorithm for future sessions with that contact.  Reinforcement learning model to optimize predictions.
*   **Profile Sharing**: Option to share environmental profiles with contacts, allowing them to benefit from preferred settings.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function preSessionSetup(senderDevice, receiverDevice, communicationCommand) {
  // 1. Data Acquisition
  historicalData = loadHistoricalData(receiverDevice, communicationCommand.sender);
  commandContext = analyzeCommandContext(communicationCommand);
  sensorData = gatherSensorData(receiverDevice);

  // 2. Contextual Inference
  predictedProfile = inferEnvironmentalProfile(historicalData, commandContext, sensorData);

  // 3. Adaptive Adjustment
  adjustLighting(receiverDevice, predictedProfile.lighting);
  adjustAudio(receiverDevice, predictedProfile.audio);
  adjustDisplay(receiverDevice, predictedProfile.display);

  // 4. User Feedback and Learning
  monitorUserOverrides();
  updateHistoricalData(userOverrides);
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with smart home ecosystems to control broader environmental factors (temperature, air quality).
*   Personalized environmental profiles based on user biometrics (e.g., adjusting lighting to reduce eye strain).
*   Automated detection of optimal room layout based on the number of participants and the session type.
*   AI-powered prediction of potential environmental distractions (e.g., detecting traffic noise and activating noise cancellation).
