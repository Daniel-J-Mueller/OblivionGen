## Adaptive Predictive Input & Contextual Task Launch

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple unified search to *predict* user intent based on initial keystrokes *before* a full query is formed, and proactively launch relevant tasks or applications. This goes beyond search results to *doing* things.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Module: Predictive Input Engine (PIE)**

*   **Input Stream:** Accepts keystroke data from any input device (keyboard, voice, gesture).
*   **Keystroke Buffer:** Maintains a rolling buffer of recent keystrokes (e.g., last 10-20 characters).
*   **Intent Classifier:** A machine learning model (trained on user behavior, application usage, and external knowledge bases) analyzes the keystroke buffer to predict likely user intent.  Intent categories: 
    *   Application Launch (e.g., “ch” -> Chrome, “ex” -> Excel)
    *   Web Search (general search terms)
    *   Specific Task (e.g., “rem” -> set a reminder, “cal” -> create a calendar event)
    *   Content Access (e.g., “doc” -> open a document, "mai" -> check email)
*   **Confidence Scoring:**  Assigns a confidence score to each predicted intent.  A threshold is set to determine when to proactively trigger actions.
*   **Contextual Data:** Leverages current application state, location data, time of day, and user profile to refine intent predictions.

**2. Proactive Task Launcher**

*   **Action Dispatcher:** Based on the predicted intent and confidence score, initiates appropriate actions.
    *   **High Confidence ( > 80%):**  Automatically launch the predicted application or task. Display a subtle notification indicating the action taken.
    *   **Medium Confidence (50-80%):** Display a contextual menu with the top 3-5 predicted actions.  User can select or dismiss.
    *   **Low Confidence (<50%):**  Initiate a standard unified search with the keystroke buffer as the query.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Monitors user responses to proactive actions (accept, dismiss, correct) to refine the Intent Classifier.
*   **Override Mechanism:**  Allows users to explicitly disable or customize proactive behavior on a per-application or system-wide basis.

**3. System Integration**

*   **Input Interception:**  Integrates with the operating system's input handling layer to intercept keystrokes *before* they are delivered to the current application.
*   **Background Service:** Runs as a background service to continuously monitor input streams and maintain the Intent Classifier.
*   **API Exposure:**  Provides an API for third-party applications to integrate with the Predictive Input Engine and contribute to the learning process.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
on_keystroke(key):
  append_to_buffer(key)
  intent_predictions = intent_classifier.predict(buffer)

  best_prediction = intent_predictions[0]
  confidence = best_prediction.confidence

  if confidence > 0.8:
    launch_application(best_prediction.application)
    display_notification("Launched " + best_prediction.application)
  elif confidence > 0.5:
    display_contextual_menu(intent_predictions)
  else:
    perform_unified_search(buffer)
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simply searching for relevant information. It aims to *anticipate* user needs and proactively launch tasks or applications *before* the user fully articulates their intent.  The adaptive learning component ensures that the system becomes increasingly personalized and accurate over time.
