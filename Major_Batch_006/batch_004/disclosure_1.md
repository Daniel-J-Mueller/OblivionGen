## Adaptive Connection Weighting & Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the 'weight' of persistent client connections based on predicted future workload, not just current load. This allows for proactive load balancing *before* congestion occurs, and optimized resource allocation. Current systems react to load; this anticipates it.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** 'Prediction Engine' - a distributed microservice running alongside Access Nodes (ANs).
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical Client Request Patterns: Time-series data of request types, sizes, and frequency *per client connection*.
    *   Real-Time Connection Metrics: Thread pool utilization, latency, throughput (as in provided patent).
    *   External Data Feeds:  Calendar events, scheduled jobs, known peak usage times (optional, but enhances prediction).
*   **Prediction Algorithm:**  Hybrid model - combines:
    *   Time-Series Forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) – predicts near-term load based on historical patterns.
    *   Machine Learning (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks) – learns complex relationships between client behavior and workload.
*   **Connection Weight Calculation:**
    *   Each persistent client connection is assigned a 'weight' (ranging from 0 to 1).
    *   Higher weight = Predicted higher future workload.
    *   Formula: `Weight = (α * Forecasted_Load) + (β * Current_Load) + (γ * Connection_Age)`.  (α, β, γ are tunable parameters). Connection age is a small positive influence to prevent starving newer connections.
*   **Load Balancer Integration:**
    *   Load balancer uses connection weights when assigning new requests.
    *   Higher-weight connections receive a proportionally *lower* probability of being assigned new requests.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Implement a system where thresholds for triggering load shedding (mentioned in the patent) are dynamically adjusted based on connection weights.  Higher weight connections have *higher* triggering thresholds, allowing them to absorb more load before being shed.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor actual load on connections after weight adjustments.  Use this data to refine the prediction algorithm and weight calculation.

**Pseudocode (Load Balancer):**

```
function assignRequest(request, connectionList) {
  totalWeight = 0
  for each connection in connectionList {
    totalWeight += connection.weight
  }

  randomValue = random() * totalWeight

  cumulativeWeight = 0
  for each connection in connectionList {
    cumulativeWeight += connection.weight
    if (cumulativeWeight >= randomValue) {
      // Assign request to this connection
      connection.processRequest(request)
      return
    }
  }

  // Fallback: Assign to a randomly selected connection if something goes wrong.
  randomConnection = selectRandomConnection(connectionList)
  randomConnection.processRequest(request)
}
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Client Prioritization:**  Allow administrators to assign priority levels to clients or client connections, influencing weight calculations.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify unusual connection behavior (e.g., sudden spikes in requests) and adjust weights accordingly.
*   **Scalability:**  Ensure the Prediction Engine can handle a large number of connections and requests. Distributed processing and caching are critical.
