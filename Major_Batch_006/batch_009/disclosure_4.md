## Dynamic Advertisement Category Sculpting

**Concept:** Leverage purchase commitment data *after* a release to dynamically reshape advertisement categories, shifting budget and keyword focus based on emergent buyer behavior, and proactively adjusting for category cannibalization.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:**

*   **Input:** Purchase transaction data (item ID, timestamp, user ID, category tags â€“ initially assigned). Clickstream data (user browsing history, search queries). Ad performance data (impressions, clicks, conversions, cost).
*   **Real-time Data Stream:** Ingest purchase and clickstream data in near real-time (e.g., using Kafka or similar message queue).
*   **Category Tagging:** Items are initially assigned to pre-defined categories.
*   **Embedding Generation:** Use a neural network model (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) to generate embeddings for items *and* user search queries based on text descriptions and associated categories.

**II. Behavioral Category Discovery:**

*   **Co-Purchase Graph:** Construct a graph where nodes represent items and edges represent co-purchase frequency (items frequently bought together). Edge weight = co-purchase count / total purchases.
*   **User Affinity Clusters:** Cluster users based on their purchase history and browsing behavior (using K-Means or DBSCAN on the item embedding vectors).
*   **Emergent Category Identification:**
    *   Analyze the co-purchase graph to identify tightly connected subgraphs representing emergent categories not explicitly defined in the initial category structure. 
    *   Examine the item embeddings within each user affinity cluster to identify items that consistently cluster together, even if they belong to different initial categories.
    *   Thresholding: Implement a threshold based on the size and density of these discovered clusters and subgraphs to determine which represent statistically significant emergent categories.

**III. Dynamic Ad Category Sculpting:**

*   **Budget Allocation:** Dynamically redistribute advertising budget across categories based on the relative size and growth rate of emergent categories. Formula: `Budget(new_category) = BaseBudget * (Size(new_category) / TotalSize) * GrowthRate(new_category)`.
*   **Keyword Generation:** Automatically generate relevant keywords for emergent categories based on:
    *   Analyzing the text descriptions of items within the category.
    *   Extracting frequent search queries from users within the associated affinity clusters.
    *   Employing a keyword suggestion API (e.g., Google Keyword Planner) to expand the keyword list.
*   **Cannibalization Mitigation:**
    *   Monitor keyword overlap between established and emergent categories.
    *   Implement negative keywords to prevent bidding on overlapping terms in established categories.
    *   Adjust ad copy to highlight the unique features of items within each category, further differentiating them.
*   **Ad Copy Adaptation:** Automatically generate ad copy variations using large language models (LLMs) tailored to the emergent category, leveraging the generated keywords and item descriptions.
*   **A/B Testing:** Continuously A/B test different ad copy variations and keyword strategies to optimize performance.

**IV. System Architecture**

*   **Data Pipeline:** Kafka, Spark Streaming, Data Lake (e.g., S3)
*   **Machine Learning Platform:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
*   **Database:** Cassandra (for real-time data), PostgreSQL (for historical data)
*   **API:** RESTful API for integration with ad platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads)
*   **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana

**Pseudocode (Budget Allocation):**

```
FUNCTION allocate_budget(established_categories, emergent_categories, total_budget):
  total_size = sum of sizes of all categories
  
  FOR each category IN established_categories + emergent_categories:
    category_size = size of category
    growth_rate = calculate_growth_rate(category)
    
    category_budget = (total_budget * (category_size / total_size) * growth_rate)
    
    assign category_budget to category
  END FOR
  
  RETURN assigned budgets
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculate_growth_rate(category):
  # Calculate the percentage change in purchases over a specified period
  past_purchases = get_purchases(category, period='last week')
  current_purchases = get_purchases(category, period='this week')
  
  growth_rate = ((current_purchases - past_purchases) / past_purchases)
  
  RETURN growth_rate
END FUNCTION
