## Dynamic Bus Topology Reconfiguration

**Concept:** Instead of solely detecting hangs, proactively *reconfigure* the internal bus topology in response to detected anomalies, creating redundant pathways and isolating failing segments.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Internal Bus: Must support dynamic routing â€“ potentially utilizing a crossbar switch or configurable network-on-chip (NoC) architecture.  The existing AXI bus (as mentioned in the patent) would require significant augmentation, potentially transition to a more flexible interconnect like CHI.
    *   Bus Monitors: Dedicated hardware modules placed at strategic points along the internal bus to monitor signal integrity, latency, and error rates. These must operate independently of the DMA controller and primary processing logic.
    *   Redundancy Modules: Physical duplication of critical bus segments and components. These duplicates are normally inactive but can be rapidly switched in.
    *   Configuration Registers: A set of registers accessible by a dedicated control unit (described below) to control the bus topology.

*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Bus Topology Control Unit: A lightweight firmware module responsible for analyzing data from the bus monitors and reconfiguring the bus topology.  Operates autonomously, but provides status updates to the main system.
    *   Anomaly Detection Algorithm: A statistical analysis algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, moving average) to detect deviations from normal bus behavior. Triggers reconfiguration when thresholds are exceeded.
    *   Topology Map: A software representation of the current bus topology, updated in real-time by the control unit.
    *   Self-Test Routines: Routines to verify the functionality of the redundancy modules and reconfiguration mechanisms.

**Pseudocode (Control Unit):**

```
// Initialization
initialize_bus_map()
enable_bus_monitors()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    monitor_data = read_bus_monitors()
    anomaly_detected = detect_anomaly(monitor_data)

    if (anomaly_detected) {
        // Identify failing segment
        failing_segment = identify_failing_segment(monitor_data)

        // Activate redundant path
        activate_redundant_path(failing_segment)

        // Update bus map
        update_bus_map()

        // Log event
        log_event("Bus reconfiguration due to anomaly")
    }
}

function detect_anomaly(monitor_data):
    // Implement statistical analysis algorithm
    // Return true if anomaly detected, false otherwise

function identify_failing_segment(monitor_data):
    // Analyze monitor data to pinpoint the failing segment
    // Return segment identifier

function activate_redundant_path(segment_identifier):
    // Switch in redundant path for the specified segment
    // Update configuration registers accordingly

function update_bus_map():
    // Update the software representation of the bus topology
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  The system boots and the Bus Topology Control Unit initializes the bus map and enables the bus monitors.
2.  The control unit continuously collects data from the bus monitors.
3.  The anomaly detection algorithm analyzes the data. If an anomaly is detected, the control unit identifies the failing segment.
4.  The control unit activates a redundant path for the failing segment.
5.  The bus map is updated to reflect the new topology.
6.  The system continues to operate with the reconfigured bus.  The control unit continues to monitor the bus for further anomalies.
