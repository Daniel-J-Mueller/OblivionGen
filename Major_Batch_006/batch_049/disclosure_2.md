## Dynamic Packet Prioritization via Predicted Congestion

**System Overview:**

This system extends the existing packet monitoring by layering a predictive congestion model *on top* of the observed queue behavior. Instead of simply throttling sources based on current queue depth, this system actively *prioritizes* packets based on predicted future congestion, allowing for smoother operation and potentially higher overall throughput.

**Components:**

1.  **Queue Observer:** (Existing - leverages the patent's hook into the free buffer API). Monitors queue depth, packet source, packet size, and basic packet metadata (e.g., DSCP values).

2.  **Congestion Prediction Engine:** This is the *new* core component. It utilizes a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM neural network, ARIMA) trained on historical queue depth data. Input to the model includes:
    *   Current queue depth
    *   Arrival rate of packets (per source)
    *   Packet size distribution (per source)
    *   Time-of-day/day-of-week (to account for predictable traffic patterns)
    *   Source-specific traffic profiles (learned over time)

    The output of the model is a predicted queue depth for a short time horizon (e.g., 10ms, 50ms). This prediction is made *per source*.

3.  **Packet Prioritization Module:**  This module sits in the network stack, *before* packets are placed in the queue.  It receives the congestion prediction from the Prediction Engine and adjusts the packet's priority based on the predicted congestion level for that source.

    *   **Priority Levels:** Define a range of priority levels (e.g., 0-3).
    *   **Congestion Thresholds:** Define thresholds for predicted queue depth, mapping to priority levels.  For example:
        *   Predicted Queue Depth < Threshold 1: Priority 0 (Lowest priority - best effort)
        *   Predicted Queue Depth > Threshold 1 AND < Threshold 2: Priority 1 (Normal priority)
        *   Predicted Queue Depth > Threshold 2: Priority 2 (High priority - for latency-sensitive applications)
        *   Predicted Queue Depth > Threshold 3: Priority 3 (Critical priority - reserved for emergency traffic/control plane)

    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** These thresholds can be dynamically adjusted based on overall system load and service level agreements (SLAs).

4.  **Traffic Shaper/Queue Manager:**  The queue manager uses the assigned priority levels to schedule packet transmission. Higher-priority packets are given preference in transmission.

**Pseudocode (Packet Prioritization Module):**

```
function prioritizePacket(packet, sourceInfo):
  predictedCongestion = CongestionPredictionEngine.predict(sourceInfo)
  if predictedCongestion < threshold1:
    priority = 0
  else if predictedCongestion < threshold2:
    priority = 1
  else if predictedCongestion < threshold3:
    priority = 2
  else:
    priority = 3

  packet.priority = priority
  return packet
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `SourceInfo`: Contains historical traffic data, current queue depth, and predicted congestion for each packet source.
*   `Thresholds`: A configurable array of queue depth thresholds for each priority level.

**Novelty:**

This system differs from the base patent by *proactively* managing congestion rather than *reactively* throttling sources. It introduces the concept of predictive prioritization, enabling smoother operation and potentially higher throughput. It also allows for more granular control over traffic scheduling based on predicted congestion levels. It is not simply observing and throttling, but observing, predicting, and *adjusting* based on predictions. This adds a layer of intelligence not present in the original patent.

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   The Congestion Prediction Engine will require significant training data and careful tuning to achieve accurate predictions.
*   The priority thresholds will need to be carefully calibrated to avoid starvation of lower-priority traffic.
*   Hardware acceleration may be necessary to handle the computational overhead of the prediction engine and prioritization module.
*   Integration with existing QoS mechanisms may be necessary.
