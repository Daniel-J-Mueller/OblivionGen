## Adaptive Query Decomposition & Parallel Execution

**Concept:** Extend the stateful API to not only manage connections but to *decompose* complex SQL queries into smaller, independent sub-queries that can be executed in parallel across multiple database instances (shards) or even different database *types* (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB). The API then reassembles the results into a single coherent response.

**Specification:**

**1. API Extension: `decompose_and_execute(sql_query, execution_profile)`**

   *   **Input:**
        *   `sql_query`: String - The full SQL query to be executed.
        *   `execution_profile`: JSON object – Defines the decomposition strategy and target database instances.  This profile dictates *how* the query is broken down and *where* each subquery executes.  Example:

            ```json
            {
              "decomposition_strategy": "by_table", // or "by_clause", "custom"
              "target_databases": [
                {"name": "users_shard_1", "type": "postgres", "connection_string": "...", "weight": 0.6},
                {"name": "products_shard_1", "type": "mysql", "connection_string": "...", "weight": 0.4}
              ],
              "max_parallel_requests": 8 //Limits concurrent subquery executions
            }
            ```

   *   **Output:** JSON object - The combined results of all subqueries, formatted as if executed against a single database.  Error handling integrated, indicating which subqueries failed.

**2.  State Management Enhancement:**

   *   Maintain a ‘capability map’ within the API state, detailing the schema and data types supported by each registered database instance. This allows intelligent decomposition and data type conversion.
   *   Track execution statistics (latency, throughput) for each database instance to dynamically adjust query routing and decomposition strategies.

**3.  Decomposition Engine:**

   *   **Parser:** Analyze the `sql_query` and `execution_profile`.
   *   **Query Splitter:** Based on the `decomposition_strategy`:
        *   `by_table`: Split the query into subqueries targeting individual tables.
        *   `by_clause`: Split by WHERE, JOIN, or other clauses.
        *   `custom`: Allow user-defined decomposition logic (via scripting language like Lua embedded within the API).
   *   **Query Rewriter:** Adapt each subquery to the schema of the target database.  This includes:
        *   Table name mapping.
        *   Data type conversion.
        *   Function/procedure name translation.
   *   **Parallel Execution Manager:** Distribute subqueries to target databases and manage concurrency using a thread pool or asynchronous I/O.

**4.  Result Assembler:**

   *   Collect results from each database.
   *   Reassemble results into a single coherent dataset.  This may require data merging, sorting, or aggregation.
   *   Handle potential data inconsistencies or conflicts.

**Pseudocode (Decompose & Execute):**

```
function decompose_and_execute(sql_query, execution_profile):
  subqueries = decompose_query(sql_query, execution_profile)
  results = []
  for subquery, target_db in subqueries:
    try:
      result = execute_on_database(subquery, target_db)
      results.append(result)
    except Exception as e:
      log_error(e)
      results.append(error_object)

  assembled_result = assemble_results(results)
  return assembled_result
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Scalability:** Distribute workload across multiple database instances.
*   **Heterogeneous Data Sources:** Integrate data from different database types.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Leverage the strengths of different database systems.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  If one database instance fails, others can continue processing.
