## Personalized Audio 'Mood Tags' & Dynamic Delivery

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple message delivery to incorporate emotional context and adaptive playback based on recipient and environmental factors.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Audio input as described in the base patent. Additionally, continuous ambient audio analysis via the device microphone (background noise, detected speech patterns – happiness, anger, sadness, etc.).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Mood Extraction:** AI model analyzes both spoken content *and* ambient audio to determine the sender's emotional state *at the time of recording*. This isn’t simply sentiment analysis of the spoken words; it's about capturing the *way* something is said, and the surrounding environment. Output: a ‘Mood Tag’ (e.g., "Energetic", "Calm", "Urgent", "Sympathetic").
    2.  **Recipient Profile:**  Maintain a profile for each contact, including:
        *   Preferred communication style (e.g., concise, detailed, empathetic).
        *   'Emotional Sensitivity' score (user-defined, or inferred from past interactions).
        *   Current context (inferred from device data – location, time of day, calendar events, connected devices, etc.).
    3.  **Dynamic Audio Modification:** Based on Mood Tag, Recipient Profile, and Context:
        *   **EQ/Audio Filtering:** Adjust EQ to emphasize frequencies associated with the sender’s Mood Tag (e.g., boost high frequencies for ‘Energetic’, lower frequencies for ‘Calm’).
        *   **Tempo Adjustment:** Subtly speed up or slow down the audio playback (very slight adjustments – 5-10%).
        *   **Background Ambiance:**  Add a subtle ambient soundscape to the playback – a gentle rain for 'Calm', upbeat music for 'Energetic', etc. (user configurable).
        *   **Voice Modulation:** Subtly alter the timbre of the voice to better resonate with the recipient’s profile (e.g., warmer tones for empathetic recipients).
    4.  **Adaptive Delivery:**
        *   **Priority Adjustment:** Urgent messages get higher priority playback.
        *   **Playback Mode:**  ‘Focused’ mode (minimal ambiance, clear voice) for busy recipients; ‘Relaxed’ mode (more ambiance, softer voice) for relaxed recipients.
*   **Output:** Modified audio message delivered to recipient’s device.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function processAudioMessage(audioData, senderId, recipientId) {
  moodTag = extractMood(audioData);
  recipientProfile = getRecipientProfile(recipientId);
  context = getRecipientContext(recipientId);

  modifiedAudio = adjustAudio(audioData, moodTag, recipientProfile, context);

  deliverMessage(modifiedAudio, recipientId);
}

function adjustAudio(audioData, moodTag, recipientProfile, context) {
  // Apply EQ, Tempo, Ambiance, Voice Modulation based on parameters
  // Logic for each adjustment is detailed within the function
  eqSettings = getEQSettings(moodTag, recipientProfile);
  tempoAdjustment = getTempoAdjustment(moodTag, recipientProfile);
  ambianceSettings = getAmbianceSettings(moodTag, context);
  voiceModulationSettings = getVoiceModulationSettings(recipientProfile);

  modifiedAudio = applyEQ(audioData, eqSettings);
  modifiedAudio = adjustTempo(modifiedAudio, tempoAdjustment);
  modifiedAudio = addAmbiance(modifiedAudio, ambianceSettings);
  modifiedAudio = applyVoiceModulation(modifiedAudio, voiceModulationSettings);

  return modifiedAudio;
}
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply *delivering* an audio message to actively *shaping* the message’s emotional impact based on both sender and recipient. It’s not just about *what* is said, but *how* it is received.
