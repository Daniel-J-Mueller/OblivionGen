## Modular Kinetic Energy Harvesting Charging System

**Concept:** A charging system integrating kinetic energy harvesting with wireless power transfer, creating a self-sustaining charging ecosystem for low-power devices. The system revolves around modular “kinetic tiles” that generate electricity from foot traffic, movement, or vibration. These tiles wirelessly transmit power to strategically placed “receiver nodes,” which then charge connected devices or feed energy back into a localized power grid.

**Specifications:**

*   **Kinetic Tile Module:**
    *   Dimensions: 30cm x 30cm x 5cm
    *   Mechanism: Piezoelectric/electromagnetic induction hybrid.  A central flexing plate coupled with embedded piezoelectric materials generates initial voltage from pressure. Linear generators amplify voltage from plate deflection.
    *   Power Output: 2-5W per step (optimized for average walking force).
    *   Wireless Transmission:  Near-field magnetic resonance (operating at 6.78 MHz).  Effective range: 30cm.
    *   Housing: Durable, weatherproof, recycled polymer composite.  Textured surface for slip resistance.
    *   Integrated Microcontroller:  Monitors tile performance, manages power output, and communicates status via low-energy Bluetooth.
*   **Receiver Node:**
    *   Dimensions: 15cm x 15cm x 3cm
    *   Wireless Reception:  Optimized coil array for receiving power from kinetic tiles. Multi-directional sensitivity to maximize capture.
    *   Energy Storage:  Solid-state lithium-polymer battery (5000 mAh, 3.7V).
    *   Output Ports:
        *   Wireless Charging Pad (Qi standard).
        *   USB-C Port (5V/2A).
        *   Low-voltage DC output (3.3V/500mA) for powering sensors/microcontrollers.
    *   Enclosure:  Sleek, minimalist design.  Mountable on walls, tables, or floors.
    *   Integrated MCU: Manages energy storage, power distribution, and communication.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Tiles are interconnected in a mesh network via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
    *   BLE communication allows for:
        *   Real-time monitoring of tile performance (voltage, current, step count).
        *   Dynamic power allocation. Tiles with excess energy can transmit to nodes farther away.
        *   Over-the-air firmware updates for both tiles and nodes.
    *   Nodes form a localized wireless power network.
    *   A central “hub” node (optional) can connect to the internet via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, allowing for remote monitoring and control.

**Pseudocode (Node - Power Management):**

```
// Initialization
batteryLevel = 0
powerReceived = 0
connectedDevices = []

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Receive power from kinetic tiles
    powerReceived = receiveWirelessPower()

    // Update battery level
    batteryLevel += powerReceived * chargingEfficiency

    // Check for connected devices
    scanForDevices()

    // Prioritize devices based on battery level
    prioritizedDevices = sortDevicesByBatteryLevel(connectedDevices)

    // Distribute power to devices
    for (device in prioritizedDevices) {
        if (batteryLevel > device.requiredPower) {
            transmitPower(device)
            batteryLevel -= device.requiredPower
        }
    }

    //If the battery is almost full, broadcast signal to kinetic tiles to reduce output.

    //Sleep for 100ms
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-traffic areas (shopping malls, airports, train stations)
*   Fitness centers and gyms
*   Schools and universities
*   Smart homes and offices
*   Remote sensor networks
*   Emergency power solutions
