## Adaptive Predictive Power Allocation & Micro-Grid Integration

**Core Concept:** Expand the doorbell’s power management to not only balance AC/Battery draw, but to actively participate in a localized micro-grid, predict power needs based on user behavior/external events, and potentially *sell* excess power back to the grid or to other smart home devices.

**Specs:**

*   **Micro-Grid Communication Module:** IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee/Thread) or similar low-power wireless communication. Enables communication with smart meters, smart appliances, and other devices within a localized power grid.
*   **Predictive Analytics Engine:** Embedded microcontroller with machine learning capabilities. Trained on:
    *   Historical doorbell usage patterns (button presses, video recording duration, motion detection events).
    *   Calendar data (integrated via cloud connection – optional user permission).  Predicts likely activity based on scheduled events.
    *   Weather data (cloud connection). Adjusts power consumption based on anticipated sunlight (solar panel integration) or storm events.
    *   External Event Integration: API access to local event feeds (parades, sporting events) to predict increased doorbell activity.
*   **Dynamic Power Allocation Algorithm:**
    1.  **Baseline Prediction:**  Predicts power demand for the next 24 hours based on historical data and calendar/weather information.
    2.  **Real-time Adjustment:** Monitors incoming events (button press, motion detection, live stream initiation).  Adjusts power allocation on-the-fly.
    3.  **AC/Battery Prioritization:**  Prioritizes AC power when available and cost-effective.  Switches to battery power during outages or peak demand times.
    4.  **Micro-Grid Participation:**
        *   If excess battery power is available *and* the micro-grid operator (smart meter/home hub) requests it, the doorbell actively *sells* power to other devices or back to the grid.
        *   If the doorbell’s battery is low *and* the micro-grid operator has excess power, the doorbell requests a charge.
*   **Solar Panel Integration (Optional):** Dedicated connector for a small solar panel. Solar power is used to supplement AC power and charge the battery, further reducing grid reliance.
*   **Power Export/Import Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of power flow (AC input, battery charge/discharge, power export/import). Data is logged and accessible via the homeowner’s smart home app.
*   **Security Considerations:** Secure communication protocols for micro-grid communication. Data encryption for user privacy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Power Allocation):**

```
// Global Variables
predicted_demand = 0
battery_level = 100
ac_power_available = true
microgrid_connected = false

function calculate_predicted_demand() {
  // Analyze historical data, calendar, weather
  predicted_demand = base_demand + calendar_factor + weather_factor
}

function adjust_power_allocation() {
  calculate_predicted_demand()

  if (ac_power_available) {
    draw_power_from_ac(min(predicted_demand, ac_max_output))

    if (battery_level < battery_threshold) {
      draw_power_from_ac(supplemental_power) // Charge battery
    }
  }

  if (!ac_power_available) {
    draw_power_from_battery(predicted_demand)
  }

  if (microgrid_connected) {
    if (battery_level > export_threshold) {
      export_power_to_microgrid(excess_power)
    }
    if (battery_level < import_threshold) {
      request_power_from_microgrid(needed_power)
    }
  }
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
  // Monitor events (button press, motion)
  event = get_next_event()
  if (event) {
    adjust_power_allocation()
  }
  sleep(1)
}
