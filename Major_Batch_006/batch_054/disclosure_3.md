## Adaptive Skill Prioritization via User Task Modeling

**Concept:** Extend device-specific skill processing by incorporating real-time user task modeling to dynamically prioritize skill selection *before* NLU processing even completes. Instead of solely relying on confidence scores *after* NLU, predict the user's overall task and preemptively bias skill selection.

**Specifications:**

**1. Task Modeling Component:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Raw audio stream (ASR input).
    *   Device context (type, current state, active applications).
    *   User history (past interactions, preferences).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a lightweight, streaming recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) – to model the evolving user task from the raw audio stream.  The RNN will be trained on a diverse dataset of user interactions mapped to high-level task categories (e.g., “play music,” “set timer,” “send message,” “control smart home device”).
    *   Integrate device context and user history as embedding vectors fed into the RNN at each time step.
    *   Output a probability distribution over the task categories.  This represents the system’s *prediction* of what the user is trying to accomplish.

**2. Skill Prioritization Module:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Task probability distribution (from Task Modeling Component).
    *   Device-specific skill list.
    *   Skill-to-Task mapping (a pre-defined table indicating which skills are relevant to each task category).
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate a ‘priority score’ for each skill based on the task probability distribution and the Skill-to-Task mapping.  For example:

        `SkillPriority(skill) = Σ [P(task) * Relevance(skill, task)]`

        Where:

        *   `P(task)` is the probability of task `task` (from the Task Modeling Component).
        *   `Relevance(skill, task)` is a pre-defined value (between 0 and 1) representing how relevant skill `skill` is to task `task`.  This could be manually configured or learned from data.
    *   Re-order the device-specific skill list based on the calculated priority scores.

**3. Modified NLU Pipeline:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Before initiating full NLU processing, prioritize the skills based on the re-ordered skill list.
    *   Dispatch the ASR output to *multiple* NLU engines, one for each prioritized skill.  This allows for parallel NLU processing.
    *   Implement a gating mechanism: the NLU engine for the highest-priority skill receives the *entire* ASR output.  Lower-priority NLU engines receive only a short “window” of the ASR output initially.  If a lower-priority engine detects a strong intent match, it can “request” the full ASR output.
    *   Combine NLU results using a weighted scoring system, favoring results from higher-priority skills.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processUserAudio(audioStream, deviceContext, userHistory):
  taskProbability = TaskModelingComponent(audioStream, deviceContext, userHistory)
  skillList = getDeviceSpecificSkills()
  prioritizedSkillList = SkillPrioritizationModule(taskProbability, skillList)

  // Parallel NLU Processing
  results = parallelMap(prioritizedSkillList, function(skill):
    nluResults = NLUEngine(audioStream, skill)
    return nluResults
  )

  // Weighted Scoring and Intent Determination
  finalIntent = determineIntent(results, prioritizedSkillList)

  return finalIntent
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency by focusing NLU processing on the most likely skills.
*   Improved accuracy by leveraging proactive task modeling.
*   Enhanced user experience through faster and more relevant responses.
*   Adaptability to new skills and tasks through machine learning.
