## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition with Generative Audio

**Core Concept:** Leverage generative audio models to dynamically compose acoustic scenes, layering synthesized sounds onto captured microphone array data to enhance or modify the perceived acoustic environment in real-time. This moves beyond simply *processing* audio to *augmenting* it.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on spatial audio processing using microphone arrays. This builds on that by adding a layer of *synthetic* audio controlled by AI, creating adaptable and personalized sonic environments. Think “sound design for reality”.

**System Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array Input:** Standard multi-channel microphone array data (as in the patent).
*   **Scene Descriptor:** A high-level description of the desired acoustic scene (e.g., "busy cafe", "calm forest", "futuristic spaceship bridge"). This could be text-based, a selection from a predefined list, or derived from user context (location, activity, biometrics).
*   **Generative Audio Model:** A trained diffusion model or Variational Autoencoder (VAE) capable of generating diverse audio samples matching the scene descriptor. Models like Google’s AudioLM or similar architectures.
*   **Spatial Audio Engine:**  A real-time spatial audio engine capable of positioning and rendering synthesized audio samples within the 3D space captured by the microphone array.  Utilize Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) for accurate spatialization.
*   **Acoustic Event Detection/Tracking:** AI system to identify and track sounds captured via the microphone array to avoid audio conflicts between the 'real' and 'synthetic' audio.
*   **Mixing & Blending Module:** System to seamlessly mix the captured audio with the generated audio, adapting levels and equalization to create a cohesive soundscape.
*   **Real-time Processing Pipeline:** Optimized for low-latency operation, capable of processing audio data in real-time (target < 20ms).

**Pseudocode (Scene Composition Algorithm):**

```
// Input: Microphone Array Data, Scene Descriptor
// Output: Processed Audio Stream

function composeScene(micData, sceneDescriptor) {

  generatedAudio = generateAudio(sceneDescriptor); // Generate audio using the AI model

  detectedEvents = detectAcousticEvents(micData); // Identify sounds captured via microphone array

  // Spatialization
  spatializedGeneratedAudio = spatializeAudio(generatedAudio, sceneDescriptor);
  spatializedMicData = spatializeMicData(micData, detectedEvents);

  // Mixing Logic (Dynamic Blending)
  mixedAudio = blendAudio(spatializedGeneratedAudio, spatializedMicData, detectedEvents);

  // Output Audio Stream
  return mixedAudio;
}
```

**Refinement:**

*   **Adaptive Sound Synthesis:** The AI model dynamically adjusts the generated audio based on the captured environment (e.g., lowering the volume of "rain" if actual rain is detected).
*   **User Personalization:**  Allow users to customize the generated soundscapes (e.g., selecting specific types of music, altering the intensity of ambient sounds).
*   **Biometric Integration:** Adjust the soundscape based on the user's emotional state (detected via wearable sensors).
*   **Haptic Feedback Synchronization:** Combine the augmented audio with haptic feedback (e.g., vibrations) to create a more immersive experience.
*   **Directional Audio Focus:** Implement a system to selectively enhance or suppress sounds in specific directions, creating a personalized "acoustic spotlight."
*   **AI driven occlusion:** Model the real-world physics of sound occlusion in the AI system to create realistic interactions between the real and synthetic audio.
