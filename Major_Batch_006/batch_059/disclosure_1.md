## Dynamic Contextual Overlay – Multi-Sensory Reference

**Concept:** Extend contextual reference beyond textual definitions to incorporate multi-sensory information triggered by in-content requests. Imagine reading a historical novel and, upon selecting a description of a battle, not just receiving a definition of a weapon, but *hearing* the sound of that weapon being used, or *seeing* a brief, stylized animation of its function.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** “Sensory Reference Engine” (SRE). This is a module integrating with existing e-reader/content display systems.
*   **Content Tagging:** Content providers (or an automated AI system) tag portions of text with “Sensory Reference Codes” (SRC). These codes indicate available multi-sensory assets (audio, visual, haptic) related to the tagged segment. SRC also carries metadata defining asset type, duration, resolution, and intended delivery method.
*   **User Profiles:** System stores user preferences regarding sensory asset delivery (e.g., volume limits, animation styles, haptic feedback intensity, sensory asset disabling options).
*   **Request Handling:** When a user selects text (or triggers a request via voice command), the system checks for associated SRC.
*   **Asset Retrieval:** If SRC is present, the SRE retrieves the corresponding sensory assets from a local cache or cloud storage.
*   **Multi-Sensory Output:**  Assets are output via the device's available sensory output mechanisms:
    *   **Audio:** Integrated speakers or headphones.
    *   **Visual:**  On-screen overlays (animations, images, short video clips) or augmented reality projections (if the device supports AR).
    *   **Haptic:**  Vibration motors or more advanced haptic feedback systems (if available) to simulate textures, impacts, or other physical sensations.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** SRE monitors user interaction (e.g., gaze tracking, button presses) and adjusts sensory output accordingly. (e.g., decreasing volume if user looks away from screen or pauses reading).
*   **Content Creation Tools:** Software allowing content creators to easily tag text and associate multi-sensory assets.

**Pseudocode (Request Handling):**

```
FUNCTION handleRequest(selectedText)
    IF hasSensoryTag(selectedText) THEN
        sensoryTag = getSensoryTag(selectedText)
        assetType = sensoryTag.assetType
        assetURL = sensoryTag.assetURL
        
        IF assetType == "audio" THEN
            playAudio(assetURL)
        ELSE IF assetType == "visual" THEN
            displayVisual(assetURL)
        ELSE IF assetType == "haptic" THEN
            triggerHaptic(assetURL)
        ENDIF
    ENDIF
    
    displayDefinition(selectedText) // Original functionality
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION displayDefinition(selectedText)
    // Existing definition display logic
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Educational Content:** Bring historical events, scientific concepts, or geographical locations to life.
*   **Fiction:** Enhance immersion and emotional impact.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide alternative sensory input for users with visual or auditory impairments.
*   **Language Learning:**  Associate sounds and visuals with new vocabulary.
