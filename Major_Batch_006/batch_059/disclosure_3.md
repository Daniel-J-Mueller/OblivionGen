## Adaptive Interference Cancellation via Distributed Acoustic Modeling

**Concept:** Leverage a network of low-cost microphones distributed around the user terminal (UT) to create an acoustic ‘map’ of the interference environment.  This map isn’t about *identifying* the source, but modelling the *propagation* of interference as an acoustic wavefield.  Combine this with beamforming to actively *cancel* interference before it reaches the receiver, beyond simply null steering.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Deploy 4-8 MEMS microphones arranged in a semi-spherical configuration around the UT. Placement prioritizes coverage of the likely azimuth and elevation angles of terrestrial interference sources (as pre-defined or learned).
*   **Acoustic Modeling Engine:**  A real-time signal processing module that performs the following:
    *   **Wavefield Decomposition:**  Uses techniques like spherical harmonic decomposition or beamforming to estimate the contribution of different spatial frequencies (i.e., wave components) to the received interference.
    *   **Propagation Modelling:**  Estimates how the wavefield changes over time due to reflections, diffraction, and absorption. This doesn't require precise environment mapping, just statistical modelling of typical urban/suburban acoustic behaviour.  Utilizes a Kalman filter to track wavefield dynamics.
    *   **Interference Prediction:**  Predicts the interference signal at the receiver *before* it arrives, based on the wavefield model.
*   **Adaptive Beamforming Integration:**  Combine predicted interference with the beamforming weights.
    *   **Subtraction:** Subtract the predicted interference from the desired signal *before* beamforming.  This reduces the effective noise floor and improves signal quality.
    *   **Weight Optimization:**  Dynamically adjust beamforming weights to further minimize interference, considering both the predicted interference and the measured signal. This utilizes a gradient descent algorithm.
*   **UT Processing Unit:** Dedicated processing core for acoustic modelling and beamforming.  Low latency is critical.  FPGA acceleration recommended.
*   **Data Storage:** Local storage for learned acoustic models. This allows the UT to adapt quickly to new environments.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
initializeMicrophoneArray()
initializeAcousticModel()
initializeBeamformer()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Capture microphone signals
  microphoneSignals = captureMicrophoneSignals()

  // 2. Acoustic Modelling
  wavefield = decomposeWavefield(microphoneSignals)
  predictedInterference = predictInterference(wavefield)

  // 3. Beamforming
  desiredSignal = captureDesiredSignal()
  interferenceCancelledSignal = desiredSignal - predictedInterference
  beamformedSignal = applyBeamforming(interferenceCancelledSignal)

  // 4. Update Acoustic Model (Kalman Filter)
  updateAcousticModel(beamformedSignal, microphoneSignals)
}
```

**Novelty:** Current interference mitigation focuses on either null-steering (reactive) or source identification (complex). This approach proactively *models* the interference wavefield, enabling *predictive* cancellation *before* the signal arrives.  It moves beyond spatial filtering to acoustic wavefield manipulation. The distributed microphone approach provides richer spatial information compared to relying on a single antenna array.
