## Neighborhood-Aware Predictive Security System

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Security Module (PSM) â€“ Software running on the Smart TV or connected streaming device.
*   **A/V Device Integration:** Compatible with existing A/V devices (cameras, doorbells) as outlined in the base patent, but adds two-way communication capability via the TV interface.
*   **Neighborhood Data:** System accesses anonymized neighborhood event data (motion detection, sound events) *shared* via the existing channel framework. Data is timestamped and geo-located (neighborhood level).
*   **AI Engine:** Locally hosted AI engine (edge computing). Trained on baseline neighborhood activity.
*   **User Interface:** Smart TV application providing real-time map of neighborhood activity, predictive risk assessment, and customizable alert settings.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** PSM learns "normal" neighborhood activity patterns (time of day, days of week) using data from subscribed A/V devices. This creates a behavioral model.
2.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Real-time monitoring for deviations from the baseline.  This isn't just "motion detected", it's "motion detected at 3 AM when no motion is usually detected".
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Incorporates historical data to predict potential security risks.  For example, if a string of package thefts occurred in the neighborhood last Tuesday, the system will heighten alert levels next Tuesday.
4.  **Risk Assessment Visualization:** A color-coded map overlaid on the TV screen displays risk levels. Green = Low Risk, Yellow = Moderate, Red = High. Risk levels are based on anomaly detection and predictive modeling.
5.  **Proactive Alerts:** Users receive alerts *before* an incident occurs. "Elevated risk of car break-ins predicted between 10 PM and 2 AM. Review security footage."
6.  **Community Reporting:** Allows users to anonymously report suspicious activity via the TV interface, enriching the data for the PSM.
7.  **Automated Response:** Integration with smart home devices (lights, alarms). In a high-risk scenario, the system can automatically turn on lights, activate alarms, and begin recording.
8.  **Privacy Considerations:** Data is anonymized and aggregated at the neighborhood level. Users have full control over data sharing settings.

**Pseudocode (Alert Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateAlert(neighborhoodData, deviceData, baselineModel)
    anomalyScore = CalculateAnomalyScore(deviceData, baselineModel)
    riskScore = CalculateRiskScore(anomalyScore, neighborhoodData.historicalEvents)

    IF riskScore > threshold THEN
        alertMessage = "Potential security risk detected. Risk level: " + riskScore
        DisplayAlertOnTV(alertMessage)
        TriggerAutomatedResponse(alerts)
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateAnomalyScore(deviceData, baselineModel)
    // compare real-time data to baseline model
    anomalyScore =  (CurrentData - BaselineData) / StandardDeviation
    RETURN anomalyScore
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateRiskScore(anomalyScore, historicalEvents)
    // Incorporate historical data for predictive modeling
    riskScore = anomalyScore + historicalEventWeight * countOfSimilarEvents
    RETURN riskScore
ENDFUNCTION

```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Smart TV with network connectivity
*   Compatible A/V devices
*   Local processing power for AI engine (recommend minimum 4GB RAM)

**Future Development:**

*   Integration with local law enforcement agencies.
*   Advanced AI algorithms for more accurate threat prediction.
*   Voice control integration.
*   Extended data sharing to a wider network.
