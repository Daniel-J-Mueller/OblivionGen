## Sensory Projection Mapping

**Concept:** Expanding beyond simple sensory outputs (light, sound, etc.) at the pickup location, integrate a projection mapping system onto the vehicle itself, triggered by the companion app. This transforms the vehicle into a dynamic display surface, directly tied to the item being collected and/or user preference.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Vehicle-mounted array of micro-projectors (high lumen density, wide-angle lenses). Array density customizable (e.g., basic, premium).
    *   Vehicle-integrated environmental sensor suite (ambient light, rain detection).
    *   Vehicle-integrated processor (edge computing) for rendering and projector control.  WiFi/Cellular connectivity.
    *   Optional: Smoke/bubble output integration (existing patent claim 3 inspiration).
*   **Software:**
    *   Companion App Integration: Expanded UI element for "Projection Customization."
    *   Projection Library: Pre-loaded animations, patterns, and visual effects categorized by item type (e.g., grocery, package, food order).
    *   User Customization: Ability to upload custom images, animations, or text for projection.  Color palette and speed control.  Dynamic content generation based on user profiles.
    *   Mapping Engine: Software that accounts for vehicle shape and dynamically warps the projected images to maintain correct perspective. Integration with vehicle sensor data for auto-calibration.
    *   API: Open API for third-party developers to create custom projection content/integrations.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Proximity Trigger: As the user’s device approaches within a defined radius (claims 4, 5, 6), the app queries the available projection options based on the pickup item.
    *   Projection Selection: The user selects a pre-defined projection, uploads custom content, or chooses a dynamic option (e.g., a “thank you” message, animated logo).
    *   Projection Activation: Companion app sends a signal to the vehicle’s processor. Processor activates the projector array and initiates the selected projection.
    *   Adaptive Projection:  Sensor data adjusts brightness and contrast based on ambient light.  Rain detection deactivates projection to protect components.
    *   Dynamic Content Generation:
        *   **Real-time Data Integration:** Display weather updates, news headlines, or stock quotes.
        *   **Gamification:** Integrate with loyalty programs or rewards systems to display celebratory animations.
        *   **AR Integration:** Overlay augmented reality elements onto the projection to create interactive experiences.



**Pseudocode (Companion App):**

```
FUNCTION onProximityDetected(vehicleID, itemType):
  GET availableProjections(vehicleID, itemType)
  DISPLAY projectionSelectionUI(availableProjections)

FUNCTION onProjectionSelected(projectionID):
  SEND projectionRequest(vehicleID, projectionID)

FUNCTION projectionRequest(vehicleID, projectionID):
  API_CALL: vehicleAPI.startProjection(vehicleID, projectionID)

```

**Innovation:** This expands the sensory notification system from simple alerts to a fully immersive visual experience. The projection mapping creates a more engaging and memorable pickup experience, enhancing brand identity and fostering customer loyalty. It transforms the vehicle into a dynamic communication platform.
