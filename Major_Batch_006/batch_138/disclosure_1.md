## Dynamic Network Persona Assignment

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network management to include dynamically assigned “network personas” to computing nodes. These personas are not just address spaces, but behavioral profiles that dictate communication permissions, bandwidth allocation, security protocols, and even simulated latency/packet loss for testing or application emulation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Persona Definition:** A persona is a JSON object containing the following fields:
    *   `name`: String – Human-readable name for the persona (e.g., “High-Bandwidth-Secure”, “Latency-Emulated-Mobile”).
    *   `address_range`: String – CIDR notation representing the virtual network address range for this persona.
    *   `communication_rules`: Array of objects. Each object defines a communication rule:
        *   `source_persona`: String – The persona of the source node.
        *   `destination_persona`: String – The persona of the destination node.
        *   `protocol`: String – Allowed protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).  “Any” is permissible, but flags for security review.
        *   `action`: Enum (Allow, Deny, RateLimit).
    *   `bandwidth_allocation`: Integer – Bandwidth in Mbps allocated to this persona. 0 for unlimited.
    *   `security_profile`: String – Identifier for a pre-defined security policy (e.g., “TLS1.3-Strict”, “OpenVPN-Standard”).
    *   `latency_emulation`: Object – Parameters for latency emulation:
        *   `average_latency_ms`: Integer – Average latency in milliseconds.
        *   `jitter_ms`: Integer – Jitter in milliseconds.
        *   `packet_loss_percentage`: Float – Packet loss percentage (0.0 - 1.0).

*   **Persona Manager Module:**
    *   Responsible for creating, updating, and deleting personas.
    *   Provides an API for assigning personas to computing nodes.
    *   Maintains a mapping between computing nodes and assigned personas.
    *   Dynamically enforces communication rules, bandwidth allocation, and security protocols based on assigned personas.
    *   Periodically audits persona assignments and enforces compliance.

*   **Node Persona Assignment API:**
    *   `assignPersona(nodeID, personaName)`: Assigns a persona to a given node.
    *   `removePersona(nodeID)`: Removes the assigned persona from a node.
    *   `getAssignedPersona(nodeID)`: Returns the name of the assigned persona for a given node.

*   **Communication Interception & Enforcement:**
    *   All network traffic passes through the Persona Manager Module.
    *   The module inspects the source and destination nodes.
    *   It retrieves the assigned personas for both nodes.
    *   It applies the communication rules defined in the personas.
    *   Traffic is allowed, denied, or rate-limited accordingly.
    *   Bandwidth allocation is enforced using traffic shaping techniques (e.g., QoS).
    *   Security protocols are applied using encryption and authentication mechanisms.
    *   Latency emulation and packet loss are simulated using network emulation techniques.

*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   The system monitors network conditions and application performance.
    *   It dynamically adjusts persona assignments and parameters based on real-time data.
    *   For example, if a node is experiencing high latency, its persona may be switched to a lower-latency profile.
    *   If a node is consuming excessive bandwidth, its bandwidth allocation may be reduced.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processPacket(packet) {
  sourceNode = packet.getSourceNode();
  destinationNode = packet.getDestinationNode();

  sourcePersona = PersonaManager.getAssignedPersona(sourceNode);
  destinationPersona = PersonaManager.getAssignedPersona(destinationNode);

  if (PersonaManager.isCommunicationAllowed(sourcePersona, destinationPersona, packet.getProtocol())) {
    // Apply QoS based on sourcePersona.bandwidth_allocation
    // Apply security profile based on sourcePersona.security_profile
    // Apply latency emulation/packet loss based on sourcePersona.latency_emulation
    forwardPacket(packet);
  } else {
    dropPacket(packet);
  }
}
```

This dynamic persona assignment system allows for granular control over network behavior, enabling advanced features such as network simulation, application isolation, and security enforcement.  It extends the existing virtual network capabilities to provide a more flexible and responsive network environment.
