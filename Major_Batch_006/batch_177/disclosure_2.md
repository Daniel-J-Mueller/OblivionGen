## Temporal Entity Resolution & Predictive Linking

**Concept:** Extend entity and relationship mapping to incorporate temporal reasoning and predictive linking, anticipating potential relationships before they are explicitly stated in the documents.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Data Structures:**

*   **Entity Timeline:** Each entity maintains a timeline represented as a series of time-stamped events or states. Events are derived from document mentions and any associated dates/times.
*   **Relationship Lifecycle:** Relationships are not static; they possess a lifecycle (initiation, development, termination) represented as a time series.
*   **Confidence Decay:** Confidence scores for both entity and relationship data decrease over time if not reinforced by new information. This prioritizes recent data.

**2. Temporal Inference Engine:**

*   **Time Series Analysis:** Utilize time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future entity states and relationship developments.
*   **Causal Relationship Detection:** Identify potential causal relationships based on temporal sequences. For example, if Event A consistently precedes Event B, a causal link is suggested.
*   **Hypothetical Relationship Generation:**  Based on predictive models, generate hypothetical relationships between entities, even if not explicitly stated.  These relationships are flagged as ‘predicted’ with associated confidence levels.

**3. Predictive Linking Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function predict_relationship(entity1, entity2, time_horizon):
  // 1. Gather historical relationship data for entity1 and entity2
  historical_data = get_historical_relationships(entity1, entity2)

  // 2. Apply time series forecasting to predict future interactions
  predicted_interactions = forecast_interactions(historical_data, time_horizon)

  // 3. Generate a hypothetical relationship based on predicted interactions
  hypothetical_relationship = create_relationship(predicted_interactions)

  // 4. Assign a confidence score based on prediction accuracy & data quality
  confidence_score = calculate_confidence(predicted_interactions)

  // 5. Return the hypothetical relationship with its confidence score
  return hypothetical_relationship, confidence_score
```

**4. User Interface Enhancements:**

*   **Temporal Visualization:** Display the entity and relationship map with a time slider, allowing users to explore the evolution of relationships over time.
*   **Prediction Highlighting:** Visually distinguish predicted relationships from confirmed relationships (e.g., using dashed lines, different colors, or transparency).
*   **Confidence Indicators:** Display confidence scores for predicted relationships (e.g., using a color scale or numeric values).
*   **Interactive Feedback:** Allow users to confirm or reject predicted relationships, providing feedback to improve the predictive models.

**5. System Architecture Integration:**

*   The Temporal Inference Engine operates as a module integrated into the existing system.
*   It leverages the existing entity and relationship data.
*   It interacts with the UI to display predictions and obtain user feedback.
*   It utilizes machine learning models trained on historical data to improve prediction accuracy.
