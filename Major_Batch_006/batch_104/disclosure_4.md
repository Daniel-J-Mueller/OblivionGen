## Adaptive Cache Granularity & Tiering

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on event-driven caching within containers. This design expands on that by introducing adaptive granularity *within* the cached data itself, combined with a tiered storage system dynamically adjusting to access patterns.

**Specification:**

**I. Granularity Control Module (GCM):**

*   **Function:** Operates within the registered cache function (container).  Responsible for subdividing cached data into variable-sized "granules".
*   **Input:** Original data to be cached, access pattern history (see II), configurable minimum/maximum granule size.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Data is initially divided into granules based on a heuristic (e.g., fixed size, content-defined chunking).
    2.  Access pattern monitoring (see II) identifies frequently co-accessed data segments.
    3.  GCM dynamically merges adjacent granules based on co-access frequency exceeding a threshold.  This creates larger, more efficient access units.  Conversely, rarely accessed granules are split to minimize transfer size.
    4.  Granule metadata tracks original data offsets, size, and access frequency.
*   **Output:** Data stored as variable-sized granules with associated metadata.

**II. Access Pattern Monitor (APM):**

*   **Function:**  Tracks data access patterns within the cache.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Interception of all GET requests to the cache.
    2.  Logging of data offsets and sizes accessed.
    3.  Creation of an access frequency map for each granule.
    4.  Identification of co-access patterns (granules frequently accessed together).
*   **Output:**  Access frequency map and co-access patterns, fed to the GCM.

**III. Tiered Storage Manager (TSM):**

*   **Function:** Manages multiple storage tiers with varying performance and cost characteristics (e.g., NVMe SSD, DRAM, object storage).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Tier Assignment:** Granules are assigned to tiers based on access frequency and age (time since last access).  Frequently accessed granules reside in faster tiers (DRAM, NVMe), while infrequently accessed granules migrate to cheaper, slower tiers (object storage).
    2.  **Prefetching:** Based on access patterns, TSM proactively prefetches granules likely to be accessed in the near future into faster tiers.
    3.  **Eviction:**  Least frequently accessed granules are evicted from faster tiers and migrated to slower tiers or discarded (based on configured retention policies).
*   **Input:** Access frequency map from APM, granule metadata, configured tier policies.
*   **Output:**  Dynamically managed tier assignments for each granule.

**IV.  Communication Protocol Modification**

*  The existing event system should be modified to communicate granular metadata and tier information along with the requested data. This will ensure the client is aware of data locality and can optimize requests.

**Pseudocode (TSM - Tier Assignment):**

```
function assignTier(granule, accessFrequency, age) {
  if (accessFrequency > HIGH_THRESHOLD && age < RECENT_THRESHOLD) {
    return TIER_DRAM // Highest Performance
  } else if (accessFrequency > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD && age < MEDIUM_THRESHOLD) {
    return TIER_NVME // Medium Performance
  } else if (accessFrequency > LOW_THRESHOLD) {
    return TIER_OBJECT_STORAGE // Lowest Cost
  } else {
    return TIER_DISCARD // Evict
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

The combination of adaptive granularity *within* cached data, coupled with a dynamically tiered storage system responding to access patterns, offers significant performance and cost optimization potential compared to traditional caching approaches. The granular metadata communicated through the existing event system provides fine-grained control over data locality and request optimization. This design extends beyond simply caching data, to *optimizing the data itself* for access patterns.
