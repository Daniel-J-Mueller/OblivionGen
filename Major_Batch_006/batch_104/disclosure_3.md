## Dynamic Environment Sonification & Haptic Layering

**Concept:** Expand environmental awareness beyond visual/auditory notifications to include spatially-mapped haptic feedback, dynamically adjusted based on detected environment state *and* user emotional/physiological data. This goes beyond simple alerts to create an immersive 'environmental skin' for the user.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite Integration:** Integrate data streams from existing devices (patent focuses on device type differentiation) *plus* biometric sensors (wearable EEG, GSR, heart rate variability). This combines environmental data *with* user state.
*   **Environment State Mapping:** Develop a dynamic mapping function that translates detected environmental states (e.g., 'user leaving', ‘event detected’) into complex haptic patterns and localized audio cues. This mapping is *not* pre-defined but learns user preferences over time.
*   **Haptic Device Network:** Utilize a network of localized haptic actuators (e.g., embedded in furniture, clothing, wearable bands).  These actuators are capable of varying intensity, frequency, and texture.  Actuator density is variable, prioritized based on likely event location (e.g., more around doorways, windows).
*   **Audio Spatialization:** Audio cues are spatially mapped to complement the haptic feedback.  Sound sources are dynamically adjusted to align with the perceived location of events.
*   **Emotional/Physiological Adjustment:**  User emotional/physiological state modulates the haptic/audio intensity and pattern.  For example, if the user is detected to be stressed, alerts are softened or delayed. If the user is calm, more detailed and nuanced information is conveyed.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm that adapts the mapping function based on user feedback (explicit or implicit). This allows the system to learn individual user preferences and optimize the user experience.
*   **Event Prioritization:** A heuristic engine filters environmental events, prioritizing those most relevant to the user's current context and emotional state.

**Pseudocode (Event Processing):**

```
function processEvent(eventData, userState) {
  // 1. Filter and prioritize event
  priority = calculateEventPriority(eventData, userState)
  if (priority < threshold) {
    return; // Ignore event
  }

  // 2. Determine haptic/audio pattern
  pattern = generatePattern(eventData, userState) // Uses learned mapping

  // 3. Spatial Mapping
  spatialLocation = determineSpatialLocation(eventData)

  // 4. Actuate haptic/audio devices
  actuateDevices(spatialLocation, pattern, userState) // Adjusts intensity based on stress, etc.

  // 5. Record user response (implicit feedback)
  recordResponse(eventData, userState)

  // 6. Update learned mapping
  updateMapping(eventData, userState, response)
}
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simple alerts. It aims to create a *felt sense* of the environment, providing information through a multi-sensory, dynamically-adjusted layer. The integration of biometric data and a learning algorithm creates a highly personalized and adaptive experience. The spatial layering of haptics provides richer environmental awareness.
