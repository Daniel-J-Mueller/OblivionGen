## Acoustic Scene Completion - Dynamic Environment Modeling

**Concept:** Expand the environment characterization beyond simple noise/echo profiling to create a *dynamic* acoustic model capable of "completing" the perceived acoustic scene. This builds on the idea of analyzing reflected pilot tones, but instead of just adapting speech recognition, it aims to reconstruct a more complete understanding of the space.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing apparatus (speaker, microphone array, control module) plus:
    *   Low-cost, wide-bandwidth inertial measurement unit (IMU) – 6DoF minimum – integrated into the device.
    *   Optional: Small, low-resolution thermal camera to identify heat sources (people, appliances).

*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Pilot Tone Generator:** (Existing) – configurable frequency, amplitude, and waveform.
    *   **Acoustic Reflection Mapper:** Processes reflected pilot tone data, estimating surface properties (distance, material, size – rudimentary at first).  Focus is on change detection – *what’s changed* since the last measurement.
    *   **IMU Data Processor:**  Processes IMU data to determine device movement and orientation.  Crucial for decoupling device movement from environmental changes.
    *   **Scene Completion Engine:**  Core module. Fuses data from:
        *   Acoustic Reflection Mapper
        *   IMU Data Processor
        *   Optional: Thermal Camera data
        *   Internal ‘prior’ map (initial acoustic fingerprint).
    *   Creates a probabilistic 3D acoustic model of the environment. This isn't a visual 3D model, but a representation of sound reflection characteristics.  Updated continuously.
    *   Can ‘predict’ how sound *should* propagate in the space, given the model.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies discrepancies between predicted sound propagation and actual received sound. This could indicate:
        *   New objects in the room
        *   Movement of existing objects
        *   Changes in surface properties (e.g., a door opening).

**Pseudocode – Scene Completion Engine (Simplified):**

```
function update_acoustic_model(pilot_tone_reflection_data, imu_data):
  // 1. Process Reflection Data
  estimated_surfaces = process_reflection_data(pilot_tone_reflection_data)

  // 2. Account for Device Movement
  transformed_surfaces = transform_surfaces_based_on_imu(estimated_surfaces, imu_data)

  // 3. Update Prior Map with new surface information
  updated_prior_map = merge_prior_map_with_transformed_surfaces(prior_map, transformed_surfaces)

  // 4. Return Updated Map
  return updated_prior_map

function predict_sound_propagation(source_location, frequency, prior_map):
  // Ray tracing algorithm utilizing prior_map to simulate sound propagation.
  // Returns predicted sound pressure level at receiver location.
  predicted_spl = ray_trace(source_location, frequency, prior_map)
  return predicted_spl

function detect_anomalies(predicted_spl, actual_spl, threshold):
  // Compare predicted SPL with actual SPL.
  // If difference exceeds threshold, flag anomaly.
  difference = abs(predicted_spl - actual_spl)
  if difference > threshold:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Detect unexpected object movement in a room when the device is in "watch" mode.
*   **Smart Home Control:** Trigger actions based on detected changes (e.g., turn on lights when someone enters a room).
*   **Improved Voice Assistant Accuracy:** Create a more accurate acoustic model for speech recognition, even in dynamic environments.
*   **Occupancy Detection:**  Determine if a room is occupied, even without direct visual confirmation.

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond simply *adapting* to the environment for speech recognition, and towards *understanding* the environment as a dynamic entity. The IMU integration is crucial for decoupling device movement from environmental changes, and the probabilistic acoustic model allows for more robust and accurate scene understanding.
