## Temporal Image Stacking for Dynamic Range Enhancement

**Concept:** Expand on the pre/post-capture buffering to create a dynamic range enhancement system, specifically tailored for rapidly changing lighting conditions or high-contrast scenes. Instead of just selecting a 'best' shot, leverage the buffer to *merge* information, creating a single image with expanded dynamic range.

**Specifications:**

*   **Capture Buffer:** Maintain a circular buffer of at least 10 frames captured at a configurable frame rate (30-60 fps).
*   **Exposure Variation:**  The camera should automatically vary the exposure *within* the buffer capture window.  For example, cycle between -1 EV, 0 EV, +1 EV.  This needs to be seamless to the user.
*   **Scene Analysis:** Perform a real-time scene analysis (using onboard processing) to detect high-contrast areas and identify optimal exposures for different regions of the image.  This isn’t global average exposure calculation; it's per-region.
*   **Image Merging Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm to intelligently merge the images in the buffer.
    *   For each pixel:
        *   Identify the image in the buffer with the *optimal* exposure for that pixel (based on scene analysis – avoid clipping highlights or crushing shadows).
        *   If multiple images have very similar exposure values for that pixel, average them to reduce noise.
        *   Blend seamlessly between images to avoid artifacts.  Gaussian blending will be important.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   A ‘Dynamic Range’ slider allowing the user to control the extent of blending/merging. Higher values mean more aggressive merging, potentially introducing more artifacts but increasing dynamic range.
    *   A ‘Preview’ mode allowing the user to see the merged image in real-time before capturing it.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:**  Offload the image merging and scene analysis to a dedicated image signal processor (ISP) or neural processing unit (NPU) to minimize processing time and power consumption.
*   **Metadata:**  Store metadata indicating the exposure values used for each image in the buffer, as well as the blending weights applied during the merging process.  This will allow for post-processing adjustments.
*   **Pseudocode (Merging Algorithm):**

```
function mergeImages(buffer, sceneAnalysisData):
  mergedImage = new Image()
  for each pixel in mergedImage:
    bestImageIndex = -1
    minClipping = infinity
    for i in range(buffer.length):
      clipping = calculateClipping(buffer[i], pixel, sceneAnalysisData)
      if clipping < minClipping:
        minClipping = clipping
        bestImageIndex = i
    mergedImage[pixel] = buffer[bestImageIndex][pixel]
  return mergedImage
```

*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Implement a ‘ghosting’ reduction algorithm to minimize artifacts caused by movement between frames.
    *   Add support for capturing multiple exposures *simultaneously* using a fast sensor and electronic shutter.
    *   Integrate with a machine learning model to predict the optimal exposure values for different scenes.
