## Temporal Graph Sharding & Query Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the internal data format to incorporate temporal dimensions and implement a sharding strategy based on time *and* column name. Reconstruct queries by merging results from multiple shards based on time-slice overlap.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Data Format:**

*   Augment the internal data format (subject identifiers, column names, values) with a `timestamp` field.  Each data element now includes: `(subject_id, column_name, value, timestamp)`.
*   `timestamp` is a high-precision value (nanoseconds).
*   Introduce a `valid_from` and `valid_to` timestamp pair for each value, representing the time range for which the value is considered current.  If `valid_to` is infinite, the value is current as of the latest timestamp.

**2. Sharding Strategy:**

*   **Primary Shard Key:** `column_name`.  Data is initially partitioned based on the column. This maintains locality for column-oriented operations.
*   **Secondary Shard Key:** `timestamp`. Within each column shard, further partition data based on time ranges. Use a sliding window approach:
    *   Define fixed-size time windows (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month).
    *   Each time window becomes a sub-shard within the column shard.
    *   Overlapping time windows can be created to reduce cross-shard query complexity.
*   A global shard map maintains the mapping between `(column_name, timestamp)` and the physical shard location.

**3. Query Reconstruction:**

*   **Query Analyzer:** When a query is received, analyze the query predicates (WHERE clause).
*   **Time Range Extraction:** Identify the relevant time range(s) for the query.  If the query doesn’t specify a time range, use a default range (e.g., current time).
*   **Shard Identification:** Based on the `column_name` and the extracted time range(s), identify the relevant shards.
*   **Parallel Query Execution:** Execute the query in parallel against the identified shards.
*   **Result Merging:** Merge the results from the shards.  This involves:
    *   De-duplication of results (due to overlapping time windows). Prioritize the most recent version of a value.
    *   Ordering of results based on the query’s ordering criteria.

**4.  Query Execution Plan Generation (Pseudocode):**

```
function generate_query_execution_plan(query):
  analyzer = QueryAnalyzer(query)
  time_ranges = analyzer.extract_time_ranges()
  column_names = analyzer.extract_column_names()

  shards = []
  for column_name in column_names:
    for time_range in time_ranges:
      shard_location = get_shard_location(column_name, time_range)
      shards.append((shard_location, query))  //Send query to each shard

  execution_plan = ParallelExecutionPlan(shards)
  return execution_plan
```

**5. Indexing Strategy:**

*   Create indices on `(column_name, timestamp, value)` within each shard.
*   Implement a bloom filter on each shard to quickly determine if a shard contains data relevant to a query.

**6. Data Versioning:**

*   Implement a versioning scheme to track changes to data over time.  Each data element can have a version number.
*   The query reconstruction process can use version numbers to ensure that the most recent version of a value is returned.



This architecture enables efficient querying of temporal graph data, even with large datasets. The sharding strategy reduces query latency, while the query reconstruction process ensures data consistency and accuracy.
