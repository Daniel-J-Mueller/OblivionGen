**Dynamic Vocal Attribute Morphing with Real-time Affect Recognition**

**System Specs:**

*   **Input:** Real-time audio stream (speech), accompanying text data (transcript), live video feed (optional – for visual affect cues).
*   **Modules:**
    *   **Affect Recognition Module:** Analyzes audio (prosody, tone) *and* video (facial expressions, body language) to detect emotional state (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral, etc.). Outputs a probability distribution across these states.
    *   **Vocal Attribute Mapping:** A pre-trained model mapping emotional states to vocal attribute parameters.  This isn't a simple "anger = harsh tone" but a multi-dimensional mapping.  The mapping is tunable and can incorporate user preferences.  Output: a vector of target vocal attribute parameters (e.g., brightness, resonance, spectral tilt, rate, volume – potentially beyond those covered in the source patent).
    *   **Morphing Engine:** Takes the current vocal attribute profile (from the existing sub-models) and the target vocal attribute profile from the mapping engine.  It performs a smooth, real-time morph of the vocal characteristics.  This *isn’t* just switching sub-models; it’s a continuous blend.  Key to this is a latent space representation of vocal attributes. The morphing engine navigates this latent space.
    *   **Speech Model Integration:** The Morphing Engine modulates the conditioning model's output *before* it reaches the sample model.  Instead of *selecting* a sub-model, the conditioning data itself is adjusted. This requires modifying the conditioning model to accept these dynamic adjustments.
*   **Latent Space:** A pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on a massive dataset of speech with labeled vocal attributes and emotional states.  The VAE learns a compressed, continuous representation of vocal space.
*   **Output:** Modified audio waveform with dynamically adjusted vocal attributes, reflecting the recognized emotional state.

**Pseudocode (Morphing Engine):**

```
function morph_vocal_attributes(current_conditioning_data, target_attribute_vector, morph_speed):
  # Encode current & target attributes into latent space
  current_latent = VAE.encode(current_conditioning_data)
  target_latent = VAE.encode(target_attribute_vector)

  # Calculate interpolation factor based on morph_speed
  interpolation_factor = min(1.0, morph_speed * delta_time)

  # Interpolate between latent vectors
  interpolated_latent = current_latent + (target_latent - current_latent) * interpolation_factor

  # Decode interpolated latent vector back to conditioning data
  modified_conditioning_data = VAE.decode(interpolated_latent)

  return modified_conditioning_data
```

**Novelty:**

*   **Continuous Morphing:** Unlike simply switching between pre-defined vocal attributes, this system allows for a smooth, nuanced transition.
*   **Real-time Affect Recognition Integration:**  Connects vocal expression directly to detected emotional state.
*   **Latent Space Navigation:** Uses a compressed representation of vocal space to enable more fluid and natural transitions.
*   **Conditioning Model Modulation:**  Doesn’t require switching sub-models, but instead adjusts the data flowing into the core speech synthesis pipeline.
