## Dynamic Feature Interaction Mapping

**Concept:** Leverage the cost/benefit analysis framework of the patent to not just *exclude* features, but to actively *map* optimal feature interactions for model training. Instead of a static evaluation of single feature processing transformations, we’ll explore combinations of transformations, modeling their interactions and predicting their combined effect on both prediction quality *and* runtime cost.

**Specification:**

**1. Interaction Graph Construction:**

*   **Nodes:** Individual feature processing transformations (quantile binning, n-grams, image processing, etc. - as listed in the patent).
*   **Edges:** Represent potential interactions between transformations. Initial edge weight = 0.
*   **Interaction Types:** Define categories of interactions:
    *   *Sequential:*  Transformation B applied to the output of Transformation A.
    *   *Parallel:*  Two transformations applied to the same input, and their outputs concatenated.
    *   *Conditional:* Transformation B applied *only if* Transformation A meets certain criteria (e.g., data distribution falls within a specific range).

**2. Cost/Benefit Prediction Model:**

*   **Input:** Interaction Graph (current configuration of edges and nodes), Data Characteristics (statistical properties of the training data), Model Configuration (model type, hyperparameters).
*   **Output:** 
    *   *Predicted Prediction Quality:* Estimated performance metric (AUC, accuracy, etc.).
    *   *Predicted Runtime Cost:*  Estimated execution time, memory usage, etc.
    *   *Interaction Weight Update:* A value representing the predicted benefit of the interaction.

*   **Model Type:**  A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is proposed. Nodes represent transformations, edges represent interactions, and node/edge features represent transformation parameters and data characteristics. The GNN outputs predicted quality and cost. Training data is generated through a combination of:
    *   Simulated data with known characteristics.
    *   Historical data from previous model training runs.

**3. Optimization Algorithm:**

*   **Algorithm:**  Reinforcement Learning (RL) – specifically, a Policy Gradient method.
*   **Agent:**  The RL agent controls the addition/removal/modification of edges in the Interaction Graph.
*   **State:**  The current Interaction Graph configuration.
*   **Action:**  Add/Remove/Modify an edge (interaction) between two feature processing transformations.  Modification includes adjusting transformation parameters.
*   **Reward:**  A weighted combination of Predicted Prediction Quality and Predicted Runtime Cost.  The weighting can be adjusted based on project priorities.  (e.g. `Reward = α * PredictionQuality - β * RuntimeCost`, where α and β are tunable parameters).

**4. Implementation Details:**

*   **Scalability:** The Interaction Graph should be modular, allowing for easy addition of new feature processing transformations.
*   **Parallelization:** The cost/benefit prediction model and the optimization algorithm should be designed for parallel execution on distributed computing resources.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system should continuously monitor model performance and runtime cost during training and adjust the Interaction Graph accordingly. This enables adaptation to changing data distributions and resource constraints.

**Pseudocode (Optimization Loop):**

```
Initialize Interaction Graph (empty)
Initialize Cost/Benefit Prediction Model (trained)
Initialize RL Agent (policy network)

For episode in range(num_episodes):
    current_state = Interaction Graph
    For step in range(max_steps):
        action = RL_Agent.select_action(current_state) // Select interaction to modify
        new_state = Modify_Interaction_Graph(current_state, action)
        predicted_quality, predicted_cost = Cost_Benefit_Prediction_Model.predict(new_state)
        reward = α * predicted_quality - β * predicted_cost
        RL_Agent.update_policy(reward, current_state, action)
        current_state = new_state

    Best_Interaction_Graph = RL_Agent.get_best_graph()
```

This system doesn't just avoid costly features – it actively *discovers* synergistic combinations of transformations to maximize model performance within resource constraints. It’s a more proactive and adaptive approach to feature engineering.
