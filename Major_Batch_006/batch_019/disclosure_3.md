## Adaptive Camouflage Range Extender

**Concept:** A range extender device incorporating dynamic, adaptive camouflage based on surrounding visual data. This extends beyond simply *appearing* aesthetically integrated into an environment; the device actively *becomes* visually indistinguishable, improving both aesthetics *and* signal propagation.

**Specs:**

*   **Core:** Standard range extender hardware (WiFi chipsets, antennas, power regulation).
*   **Exterior:** Composed of a flexible, high-resolution E-Ink or similar bistable display material stretched over a geodesic dome structure. The dome is ~15cm diameter.
*   **Camera System:** Four low-profile, wide-angle cameras integrated into the dome's surface, positioned to capture a 360-degree panoramic view. Resolution: 12MP each. Frame rate: 5fps.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded system-on-chip (SoC) with dedicated image processing capabilities. Minimum specs: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72, 4GB RAM.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Environmental Mapping:** Algorithm to stitch camera feeds into a seamless 360-degree panoramic image.
    *   **Texture Mapping:** Project the environmental map onto the flexible display, dynamically updating the device's appearance.
    *   **Predictive Camouflage:** AI-powered algorithm to *predict* changes in the environment (e.g., moving shadows, shifting light) and proactively adjust the display to maintain camouflage. This requires a small training dataset for typical environments (home, office, outdoor).
    *   **Signal Optimization Overlay:** Algorithm which *also* projects antenna radiation patterns *onto* the display *as visual texture*. The intensity of signal is mapped to brightness and color.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging or USB-C. Battery life: 8 hours (typical use).
*   **Mounting:** Magnetic base, allowing attachment to metallic surfaces.

**Pseudocode (Signal Optimization Overlay):**

```
function update_display(environment_map, signal_data):
  // signal_data is a 3D array representing antenna radiation pattern (azimuth, elevation, strength)

  for each pixel in display:
    azimuth = pixel.x
    elevation = pixel.y

    signal_strength = get_signal_strength(signal_data, azimuth, elevation)

    // Map signal strength to color and brightness
    if signal_strength > 80%:
      color = bright_green
      brightness = 100%
    else if signal_strength > 50%:
      color = yellow
      brightness = 75%
    else:
      color = dark_red
      brightness = 25%

    pixel.color = color
    pixel.brightness = brightness

    // Blend with environmental map to create textured camouflage
    pixel.final_color = blend(pixel.color, environment_map[x,y])

  display.update()
```

**Novelty:** This combines adaptive camouflage with a functional signal visualization element. The signal strength mapping *becomes* part of the camouflage, potentially masking the device’s presence even further by creating an illusion of environmental texture. It's not just *looking* like a rock, it’s *behaving* like a textured surface.
