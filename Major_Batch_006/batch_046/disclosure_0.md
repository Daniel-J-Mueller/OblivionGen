## Dynamic Complexity Scaling for ABR

**Concept:** Introduce a system that dynamically adjusts the computational complexity of the encoding process *per rendition* in the ABR ladder, rather than applying a uniform complexity across all resolutions. This is based on the idea that lower resolution renditions require significantly less processing power to achieve acceptable quality and can therefore be encoded with a reduced computational footprint. Conversely, higher resolution renditions, where perceptual quality is more critical, benefit from increased complexity.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Complexity Metrics:** Define a set of quantifiable complexity metrics for the video encoder. These include, but are not limited to:
    *   Motion Estimation Search Range (pixels)
    *   Motion Estimation Block Size (pixels)
    *   Transform/Quantization Depth (bits)
    *   Number of Prediction Modes Evaluated
    *   Loop Filter Strength 

2.  **Rendition Mapping:** Establish a mapping function that assigns complexity levels to each rendition in the ABR ladder. This function should consider the rendition's resolution, target bitrate, and predicted network conditions.  A potential mapping could be a logarithmic or exponential function, scaling complexity inversely with resolution. 

    ```pseudocode
    function determine_complexity(rendition_resolution, rendition_bitrate, network_conditions):
      base_complexity = 100 // Default complexity level
      resolution_factor = 1.0 - (rendition_resolution / max_resolution) // Scale based on resolution
      network_factor = 1.0 + (network_jitter / max_network_jitter) //Adjust for network conditions
      complexity = base_complexity * (1 + resolution_factor * 0.5 + network_factor * 0.2)
      return clamp(complexity, min_complexity, max_complexity)
    ```

3.  **Encoder Control Interface:** Develop an interface that allows the encoding system to dynamically adjust the encoder's complexity settings based on the assigned level for each rendition. This requires modifying the encoderâ€™s configuration parameters *during* the encoding process.

4.  **Real-time Monitoring & Adjustment:** Implement a real-time monitoring system that tracks the encoding time and quality metrics for each rendition.  This system should be able to automatically adjust the complexity levels based on performance. If a rendition consistently takes too long to encode, its complexity should be reduced. Conversely, if quality is consistently poor, complexity should be increased (within predefined limits).

5.  **Hardware Acceleration:** Leverage hardware acceleration capabilities (e.g., GPU encoding) to offload the computational burden of higher-complexity encodings, minimizing the impact on encoding time.

6.  **Quality Assessment Metrics**: Integrate perceptual quality assessment (PQA) metrics (e.g., VMAF, SSIM) into the real-time monitoring system to provide a more accurate measure of encoding quality. This will enable the system to optimize complexity levels for perceptual quality, not just technical metrics.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced overall encoding time and computational costs
*   Improved resource utilization
*   Enhanced scalability for large-scale ABR streaming services
*   Potential for better perceptual quality at lower bitrates by optimizing complexity per rendition.
