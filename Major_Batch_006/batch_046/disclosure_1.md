## Adaptive Chime Profiles & Predictive Signaling

**System Overview:** An extension to the existing A/V doorbell system which dynamically adjusts the chime profile (sound and duration) based on pre-defined user profiles *and* predictive analysis of visitor identity & urgency. 

**Core Components:**

*   **Visitor Database:** Cloud-hosted database storing visitor faces (identified via camera), associated profiles (family, frequent delivery, salesperson, unknown), and custom chime profiles.
*   **AI-Powered Visitor Identification:** Real-time facial recognition system. If a match is found, the corresponding profile is loaded. 
*   **Urgency Prediction Module:** Analyzes visitor behavior *before* button press (proximity to door, speed of approach, carrying items). Assigns an urgency score (low, medium, high).
*   **Chime Profile Generator:** Combines visitor profile *and* urgency score to select/generate a custom chime profile.  Profiles define chime type, volume, duration, and potentially even a short pre-recorded message (“It’s Grandma!”, “Package Delivery”).
*   **Local Chime Control:** The A/V doorbell unit manages local chime activation (connected to existing chime or internal speaker).

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// On Visitor Detection (Camera Trigger)
visitor = DetectVisitor()

IF visitor.face_recognized THEN
    profile = GetVisitorProfile(visitor.face_id)
    urgency = PredictUrgency(visitor.behavior)

    chime_profile = GenerateChimeProfile(profile, urgency)

ELSE
    // Default unknown visitor profile
    chime_profile = GetDefaultChimeProfile()

ENDIF

// On Button Press or Motion Detection (If configured)
ActivateChime(chime_profile)
SendNotificationToClientDevice()
```

**Chime Profile Parameters:**

*   **Chime Type:** Selection from a library (traditional chime, modern melody, custom sound).
*   **Volume:** Adjustable volume level.
*   **Duration:**  Short, medium, long.  Emergency profiles could have extended duration.
*   **Message Prefix:**  Optional short pre-recorded message announcing visitor identity (“It’s John!”).  Could also include urgency indicators (“Important Package!”).
*   **Vibration Pattern:** (If doorbell includes vibration functionality) Custom vibration patterns for different profiles.

**Hardware Extensions:**

*   **Enhanced Speaker:** Higher quality speaker capable of reproducing a wider range of frequencies and volumes.
*   **Microphone Array:** For improved voice recognition and clearer audio communication.
*   **Local Storage:**  For storing custom sound files and pre-recorded messages.

**Potential Future Enhancements:**

*   **Learning Mode:** The system could learn user preferences for chime profiles over time, automatically adjusting settings based on user feedback.
*   **Integration with Smart Home Systems:**  Control of smart lights or other devices based on visitor profile (e.g., turn on porch light for family members, activate security camera for unknown visitors).
*   **Multi-User Profiles:**  Allow multiple users to create and manage their own visitor profiles and chime preferences.
