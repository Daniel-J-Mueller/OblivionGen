**Wireless Service Plan Personalization via Predictive Network Usage**

**Specification:** A system and method for dynamically tailoring wireless service plans based on predicted network usage patterns, exceeding static plan offerings.

**Components:**

1.  **Usage Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical network data (bandwidth, time of day, application type, location) associated with individual subscribers. This engine forecasts future network usage with a granularity of hours, factoring in contextual data (calendar events, location history, app usage).

2.  **Dynamic Plan Composer:** An algorithm that constructs custom service plans based on the output of the Usage Prediction Engine. It optimizes for bandwidth allocation, data caps, and feature bundles (streaming services, hotspot data) to match predicted needs while minimizing cost for the user and maximizing revenue for the carrier.

3.  **Real-time Adjustment Module:** A system that monitors actual network usage and compares it to the predicted usage. It dynamically adjusts plan parameters (bandwidth throttling, feature access) in real-time to optimize performance and cost. This is done transparently to the user, with options for manual override.

4.  **Proactive Notification System:** A module that alerts users to potential overages or opportunities to optimize their plans based on predicted usage patterns. Offers recommendations for adjustments, such as temporarily upgrading bandwidth for a specific event or reducing data caps during periods of low usage.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Data Collection:** Collect historical network usage data from subscribers, including bandwidth consumption, time of day, application type, and location.

2.  **Model Training:** Train the Usage Prediction Engine using the collected data. Continuously retrain the model with new data to improve accuracy.

3.  **Prediction Generation:** For each subscriber, the Usage Prediction Engine generates a forecast of future network usage.

4.  **Plan Composition:** The Dynamic Plan Composer creates a custom service plan based on the predicted usage. This plan may include variable bandwidth allocation, dynamic data caps, and tailored feature bundles.

5.  **Plan Activation:** The custom service plan is activated for the subscriber.

6.  **Real-time Monitoring:** The Real-time Adjustment Module monitors actual network usage and compares it to the predicted usage.

7.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The module dynamically adjusts plan parameters as needed to optimize performance and cost.

8.  **Proactive Notification:** The Proactive Notification System alerts users to potential issues or opportunities.

**Pseudocode (Real-time Adjustment Module):**

```
FUNCTION adjustPlan(subscriberID, currentUsage, predictedUsage, currentTime)
  IF currentUsage > predictedUsage * 1.2 THEN
    // Usage significantly exceeds prediction
    throttleBandwidth(subscriberID, 0.8) // Reduce bandwidth by 20%
    sendNotification(subscriberID, "High usage detected. Bandwidth reduced temporarily.")
  ELSE IF currentUsage < predictedUsage * 0.8 THEN
    // Usage significantly below prediction
    increaseBandwidth(subscriberID, 1.1) // Increase bandwidth by 10% (if possible)
    sendNotification(subscriberID, "Low usage detected. Bandwidth increased slightly.")
  END IF

  // Adjust feature access based on predicted usage
  IF predictedUsage.streaming > threshold AND subscriber.streamingEnabled == FALSE THEN
    enableFeature(subscriberID, "streaming")
  END IF

  RETURN
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers for data processing and model training.
*   Scalable database for storing usage data and subscriber profiles.
*   Real-time monitoring and adjustment engine.
*   Machine learning libraries and frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   API integration with existing billing and provisioning systems.
