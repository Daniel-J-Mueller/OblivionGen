## Dynamic Load Prioritization & Predictive Branching - 'Phoenix System'

**Concept:** Expand the power cross-coupling to include *predictive* load shedding and dynamic branch creation based on real-time power availability *and* anticipated demand, moving beyond reactive overcurrent/mismatch responses. This involves a tiered prioritization system linked to AI-driven load forecasting.

**System Specs:**

*   **Tiered Load Prioritization Matrix:** Each load (or group of loads - rack level) is assigned a priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on operational impact. This data is input manually and constantly updated via an automated API with operational monitoring tools.
*   **AI-Driven Demand Forecasting:** A machine learning model analyzes historical power usage patterns, real-time operational data (server utilization, network traffic, etc.), and predicted workload increases (scheduled maintenance, anticipated spikes) to forecast power demand for each branch and the entire system. Model retraining occurs continuously with incoming telemetry.
*   **Dynamic Branch Creation Module:** The system will identify excess capacity on existing branches and algorithmically *create* virtual branches by temporarily re-routing power through cross-coupling infrastructure. These branches serve as temporary buffers for anticipated demand surges.
*   **Predictive Load Shedding Algorithm:** Before an overcurrent condition arises, the system proactively sheds low-priority loads on branches predicted to exceed capacity. Load shedding is phased - starting with lowest priority and escalating. The algorithm factors in the 'cost' of shedding a load (impact on operation) versus the risk of a system failure.
*   **Adaptive Power Bus Architecture:** Utilize a modular power bus system. The bus contains redundant pathways and intelligent power distribution units (PDUs). These PDUs are capable of dynamically re-routing power based on demand, cross-coupling configurations, and predictive algorithms.
*   **Real-Time Branch Capacity Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the current and predicted capacity of each branch. This data feeds the dynamic branching and load shedding algorithms.
*   **Centralized Control System (Phoenix Core):** A central control system manages all aspects of the dynamic branching, load shedding, and monitoring. It provides a user interface for visualizing the system, configuring priorities, and overriding automated decisions.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Use a secure, high-bandwidth communication protocol (e.g., TSN - Time Sensitive Networking) to ensure real-time data exchange between all components.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Load Shedding):**

```
// Input: BranchID, PredictedDemand, PriorityMatrix, CurrentLoad
FUNCTION PredictivelyShedLoad(BranchID, PredictedDemand, PriorityMatrix, CurrentLoad)

  IF PredictedDemand > CurrentLoad AND PredictedDemand > BranchCapacity THEN

    // Sort loads within BranchID by Priority (Ascending)
    Loads = SortByPriority(BranchID)

    FOR EACH Load IN Loads:
      IF Load.Priority == "Low":
        ShedLoad(Load.ID) // Turn off the load
        CurrentLoad = CurrentLoad - Load.PowerConsumption
        IF CurrentLoad < PredictedDemand THEN
            // Check the next load
        ELSE
            // Shedding complete; no further action needed
            BREAK
        END IF
      ELSE IF Load.Priority == "Medium":
        // Optionally prompt operator before shedding medium priority loads
        // Implement a timeout to automatically shed if no response
      END IF
    END FOR
  END IF

END FUNCTION
```
