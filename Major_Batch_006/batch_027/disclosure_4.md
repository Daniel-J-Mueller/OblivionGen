**Adaptive Content Mirroring & Predictive Prefetching**

**System Overview:**

A system designed to dynamically create simplified, mobile-optimized "mirrors" of complex web content *before* a user explicitly requests it, based on observed browsing behavior and predicted intent. This goes beyond simple caching; it's proactive content adaptation and pre-delivery.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Analysis Module:**  Tracks user interactions (scroll depth, time spent on elements, mouse movements, link hovers) to build a behavioral profile. This profile isn’t about *what* they’re looking at, but *how* they’re looking at it – suggesting intent.
2.  **Content Decomposition Engine:**  Analyzes the DOM of web pages, identifying key content blocks (images, text, videos) and their dependencies. This isn't about creating a summary; it's about identifying the building blocks.
3.  **Adaptive Mirror Generator:** Creates lightweight, mobile-optimized versions of content blocks.  This involves image compression, text simplification (removing unnecessary formatting), video transcoding, and removal of non-essential JavaScript.  Prioritizes accessibility and speed.
4.  **Predictive Prefetcher:** Based on the behavioral profile and the current page, predicts which content blocks the user is likely to interact with next.  Prefetches and generates adaptive mirrors of those blocks *before* the user requests them.
5.  **Client-Side Integration:** A lightweight JavaScript library injected into web pages. This library communicates with the server, receives pre-generated adaptive mirrors, and seamlessly replaces original content blocks with the optimized versions. This happens *before* the user's device has to download and render the full content.
6.  **Content Prioritization Algorithm:** Uses machine learning to determine which content blocks are most likely to be viewed by the user.  Factors in historical data, real-time user behavior, and content type.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
initializeTracking();
connectToMirrorService();

// On Page Load
pageLoaded:
  decomposeDOM();
  requestInitialMirrors();

// User Interaction (Scroll, Hover, Click)
interactionDetected:
  analyzeInteraction();
  predictNextContent();
  requestMirrorsForPredictedContent();

// Mirror Received
mirrorReceived:
  replaceOriginalContentWithMirror();
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **User Profile:**  { userID: string, behavioralData: array[interaction object], predictedContent: array[contentID] }
*   **Content Block:** { contentID: string, originalURL: string, adaptiveURL: string, dependencies: array[dependencyID], size: int }
*   **Interaction Object:** { timestamp: int, type: string (scroll, hover, click), elementID: string, scrollDepth: float }

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond existing content delivery networks (CDNs) and adaptive bitrate streaming. It's *proactive* content adaptation based on user *behavior* rather than explicit requests. The predictive prefetching aims to eliminate perceived latency, creating a fluid browsing experience. The decomposition and adaptation are geared toward mobile, prioritizing speed and accessibility.
