## Dynamic Affinity Graph with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Expand the item-to-item relationship mapping beyond static co-occurrence frequencies. Introduce a dynamic affinity graph where edge weights (representing relationship strength) decay over time, favoring recent co-occurrences while still retaining historical connections. This allows recommendations to adapt quickly to changing trends and user preferences while avoiding complete erasure of established affinities.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `AffinityGraph`:  A graph data structure where nodes represent items. Edges represent relationships between items, weighted by an affinity score.
    *   `HistoricalTransactionBuffer`: A time-series database or ring buffer to store transaction histories with timestamps.

2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Pre-populate the `AffinityGraph` using historical transaction data as described in the base patent (co-occurrence frequency).
    *   Assign initial edge weights based on co-occurrence counts.

3.  **Real-Time Update Process (triggered by each new transaction):**

    ```pseudocode
    function update_affinity_graph(transaction, timestamp):
      items_in_transaction = transaction.items
      for i in range(len(items_in_transaction)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(items_in_transaction)):
          item1 = items_in_transaction[i]
          item2 = items_in_transaction[j]

          # Get current edge weight (if exists)
          current_weight = get_edge_weight(item1, item2)

          # Calculate decay factor based on time since last co-occurrence
          time_since_last_cooccurrence = calculate_time_since_last_cooccurrence(item1, item2)
          decay_factor = calculate_decay_factor(time_since_last_cooccurrence)

          # Update edge weight (with a learning rate)
          new_weight = current_weight * decay_factor + 1.0  # Add 1.0 for the new transaction.
          set_edge_weight(item1, item2, new_weight)
    ```

4.  **Decay Factor Calculation:**

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_decay_factor(time_since_last_cooccurrence):
      # Exponential decay – adjust 'decay_rate' for sensitivity
      decay_rate = 0.01  # Tune this parameter.
      return exp(-decay_rate * time_since_last_cooccurrence)
    ```

5.  **Recommendation Generation:**

    *   Given a user’s viewed/purchased items (seed items), traverse the `AffinityGraph` to find related items.
    *   Calculate a recommendation score for each related item based on:
        *   Edge weight (affinity score).
        *   Distance from seed items (number of hops in the graph).
        *   Potentially incorporate user-specific weighting based on purchase history or ratings.
    *   Recommend items with the highest scores.

6. **Scalability Considerations:**

    *   Graph database technology (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph) for efficient graph storage and traversal.
    *   Distributed processing framework (e.g., Apache Spark) for parallel graph updates and recommendation generation.
    *   Caching frequently accessed graph data to reduce latency.

7. **Parameter Tuning:**
    *   `decay_rate`: Controls the rate at which edge weights decay. Higher values result in faster decay.
    *   `learning_rate`: Controls the influence of new transactions on edge weights.
    *   Graph traversal depth: Limits the distance from seed items during recommendation generation.
