## Dynamic Workflow "Skins" & Contextual Node Libraries

**Specification:** A system for applying visual and functional "skins" to workflow models, coupled with a dynamic node library that adapts based on skin selection and workflow context.

**Core Concept:**  Extend the existing workflow assembly tool to allow users to select from pre-defined or custom "skins" that dramatically alter the visual presentation *and* available node types within the workflow editor.  This isn’t merely cosmetic; skin selection fundamentally changes the workflow's intended purpose and node palette.

**Use Case:** Imagine a workflow designer selecting a "Financial Modeling" skin. This instantly transforms the interface to utilize financial chart elements,  adds nodes specific to financial calculations (e.g., IRR, NPV, Monte Carlo simulations), and potentially restricts access to irrelevant node types (e.g. image processing). Conversely, a "Marketing Automation" skin would reveal a different node set – email campaign builders, A/B testing modules, social media integration – and a corresponding visual theme.

**Technical Specifications:**

1.  **Skin Definition File:**  A JSON-based file defining a skin. This file would include:
    *   `skin_name`:  Human-readable name of the skin.
    *   `visual_theme`: References to CSS stylesheets, icon sets, color palettes.
    *   `node_library_filter`:  A list of allowed node types (IDs).  Any node not in this list is hidden from the user.
    *   `default_nodes`:  A list of node IDs to automatically include in a new workflow using this skin.
    *   `contextual_rules`: An array of rules. Each rule connects skin selection with context detection (e.g. data source type, existing node connections) and automatically adds/removes nodes or alters node configurations.

2.  **Context Detection Module:** This module analyzes the active workflow model.  It identifies:
    *   Data source types connected to input nodes.
    *   Node types already present in the workflow.
    *   Existing connections between nodes.

3.  **Dynamic Node Library Loader:**  This module responds to skin selection *and* context detection. It loads the appropriate node definitions from a central repository (local or remote) and populates the node palette.  The module utilizes a caching mechanism to improve performance.

4.  **Rule Engine:**  Implements the `contextual_rules` defined within the skin file.  The engine monitors workflow changes and dynamically adjusts the node palette and node configurations accordingly.  Pseudocode example:

```pseudocode
function apply_contextual_rules(skin_definition, workflow_model):
  for rule in skin_definition.contextual_rules:
    if rule.condition == "data_source_type == 'CSV'":
      if workflow_model.input_nodes[0].data_source_type == "CSV":
        add_node_to_palette(rule.node_id)
    if rule.condition == "node_exists('Data Cleansing')":
      if node_exists(workflow_model, 'Data Cleansing'):
        remove_node_from_palette(rule.node_id)
```

5.  **Workflow Persistence:** Workflow files will include a `skin_id` field to store the skin used to create the workflow. When a workflow is loaded, the system will apply the associated skin.

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability of the node repository.
*   Performance of the dynamic node library loading and rule engine.
*   Security considerations for accessing remote node repositories.
*   User interface for managing skins and customizing the node palette.
