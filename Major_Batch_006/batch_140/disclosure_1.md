## Dynamic Metadata Sharding & Re-Encryption for Enhanced Secure File Transfer

**Concept:** Expand upon the metadata encryption concept in the provided patent by implementing dynamic sharding of the metadata *before* encryption and applying re-encryption with a rotating key schedule. This significantly complicates potential metadata breaches even if an attacker compromises a single key.

**Specs:**

**1. Metadata Sharding Module:**

*   **Input:** Original file metadata (filename, location, first encryption key identifier, access control lists, timestamp, etc.).
*   **Process:** Divide metadata into 'n' equal-sized shards. 'n' is configurable system-wide and per-file (default = 3). Sharding algorithm must be deterministic (e.g., consistent hashing) to allow reconstruction.
*   **Output:** ‘n’ metadata shards.

**2. Key Rotation Scheduler:**

*   **Mechanism:** Implement a time-based or event-based key rotation schedule. New symmetric keys are generated periodically (e.g., every 24 hours, or after a specific number of file accesses).
*   **Key Derivation:** Utilize a Key Derivation Function (KDF) – Argon2, scrypt, or similar – seeded with a master key and a time/event counter.  This creates unique symmetric keys for each rotation period.
*   **Key Storage:** Store key rotation history (mapping time/event to derived symmetric key) securely within the secure collaboration app’s enclave/secure storage.

**3. Shard Encryption & Distribution:**

*   **Process:**
    *   For each shard:
        *   Encrypt the shard using a symmetric key derived from the *current* key rotation period.
        *   Encrypt the symmetric key itself using the recipient's public key (asymmetric encryption).
    *   Distribute the encrypted shards and associated encrypted symmetric keys to the intended recipients.

**4. Metadata Reconstruction Module (Receiver Side):**

*   **Input:** Encrypted shards and encrypted symmetric keys.
*   **Process:**
    *   Decrypt the symmetric keys using the recipient’s private key.
    *   Decrypt each shard using the corresponding symmetric key.
    *   Reassemble the shards into the original metadata using the deterministic sharding algorithm.
*   **Output:** Original file metadata.

**5. File Retrieval & Decryption:**

*   Standard process as outlined in the provided patent, utilizing the reconstructed metadata.

**Pseudocode (Metadata Reconstruction Module):**

```pseudocode
function reconstructMetadata(encryptedShards, encryptedSymmetricKeys):
    shards = []
    for i in range(length(encryptedShards)):
        // Decrypt Symmetric Key
        symmetricKey = decrypt(encryptedSymmetricKeys[i], recipientPrivateKey)
        // Decrypt Shard
        shard = decrypt(encryptedShards[i], symmetricKey)
        shards.append(shard)

    // Reassemble Metadata
    metadata = reassembleMetadata(shards)
    return metadata
```

**Novelty:** This system introduces a layer of complexity exceeding simple metadata encryption. By sharding the metadata and using rotating encryption keys, even a compromise of a single key or a successful metadata decryption does not reveal the complete information necessary to access the file. The dynamic nature of the keys and shards creates a moving target for attackers.
