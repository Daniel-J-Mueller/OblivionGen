## Collaborative Wishlist Integration & Dynamic Gifting

**Concept:** Extend the shared shopping cart functionality into a dynamic wishlist system integrated with a gifting mechanism.  Instead of *buying* items collaboratively, users collaboratively *wishlist* items, and the system facilitates gifting those items *from* the group *to* each other – or even to external recipients.

**Specifications:**

**1. Wishlist Creation & Contribution:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Extend the existing "aggregated shopping cart" data structure to include a "wishlist" flag for each item.  Each item also stores a list of "contributors" – users who have expressed interest or contributed towards its potential purchase.
*   **User Interface:**  Add a "Wishlist" toggle to each item in the shared cart view. When toggled, the item is added to the shared wishlist.  A "Contributor" button appears, allowing users to indicate interest or contribution.
*   **Contribution Levels:** Contributors can specify a contribution amount (monetary or symbolic – e.g., "I'll help wrap it!").  These contributions are stored against the item and the user.

**2. Gifting Workflow:**

*   **Gifting Initiator:** Any user can initiate a gift from the wishlist. They select the item and a recipient (another user in the group, or an external email address/physical address).
*   **Funding Request:** The system calculates the total cost of the item (including shipping, taxes). It then prompts contributors to fulfill their stated contributions.
*   **Partial Fulfillment:** If full funding isn’t immediately available, the system can allow partial fulfillment – the item is purchased when sufficient funds are contributed, or the initiator covers the remaining cost.
*   **Automated Messaging:** The gifting process triggers automated messages:
    *   To the recipient, notifying them of the gift.
    *   To contributors, confirming their contribution and thanking them.
    *   To the initiator, confirming purchase/fulfillment.

**3. Dynamic Wishlist & "Gift Hints":**

*   **Wishlist Weighting:**  The system tracks "interest weight" for each item.  This is based on the number of contributors, the amount contributed, and explicit user ratings (e.g., "Want this badly!").
*   **"Gift Hints":** The system suggests items for gifting based on interest weight, recipient preferences (derived from past activity), and upcoming events (birthdays, holidays).
*   **"Shared Savings"**: A 'shared savings' pool is built up over time by users contributing a small percentage of all their purchases towards a pool that can be used to cover shipping or taxes on gifted items.

**4. Integration with External Services:**

*   **Wishlist Import:** Ability to import wishlists from other platforms (Amazon, etc.).
*   **Gift Registry Integration:** Integration with gift registry services for weddings, baby showers, etc.
*    **Crowdfunding element**: Allow contributors to suggest a price for the item if the item does not have a set price. The contribution threshold is then based on the suggested price.

**Pseudocode - Gifting Workflow:**

```
function initiateGift(itemId, recipient, initiator):
    item = getItem(itemId)
    totalCost = calculateTotalCost(item)
    contributors = getItemContributors(item)

    for contributor in contributors:
        requestContribution(contributor, totalCost / len(contributors))

    if sufficientFundsReceived():
        processPurchase(item, recipient)
        sendConfirmationMessages(recipient, contributors, initiator)
    else:
        promptInitiatorToCoverRemainingCost()
```
