## Data Lineage Anomaly Prediction & Automated Remediation

**System Overview:**

This system extends the core data lineage graph to proactively identify *potential* data quality issues *before* they manifest downstream. It leverages machine learning models trained on historical performance data within the lineage graph, combined with real-time monitoring of data transformations. When anomalies are predicted, the system doesn’t just flag them – it automatically attempts remediation based on pre-defined rules or learned policies.

**Components:**

1.  **Performance Data Collector:** (Existing in the base patent) - Captures transformation performance metrics (latency, error rates, data volume changes, schema drift) and integrates them into the lineage graph nodes/edges.
2.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:** This is new.
    *   **Model Training:** Uses historical performance data from the lineage graph to train time-series forecasting models (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) for each transformation within the data flow. These models predict future performance based on past behavior.
    *   **Real-time Monitoring:**  Continuously monitors incoming performance data for each transformation.
    *   **Anomaly Scoring:**  Compares real-time performance to predicted performance. A weighted scoring system determines the severity of the anomaly. Weights are configurable based on the importance of the transformation/data.
3.  **Remediation Engine:** This is new.
    *   **Rule-Based Remediation:**  Pre-defined rules map anomaly types to specific remediation actions.  Examples:
        *   If a transformation consistently exceeds latency threshold, trigger scaling of resources.
        *   If data volume drops unexpectedly, retry the upstream transformation.
        *   If schema drift is detected, attempt data correction/conversion.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent:**  Trains an RL agent to learn optimal remediation strategies. The agent observes the data flow state, takes remediation actions, and receives rewards/penalties based on the outcome (e.g., reduced latency, improved data quality).
4.  **Lineage Graph Enhancement:**
    *   Add “Anomaly Score” attribute to nodes/edges, reflecting the likelihood of an issue.
    *   Record remediation actions taken in the lineage graph for auditability and learning.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection & Remediation Loop):**

```
FOR EACH incoming transformation performance data:
    1. Retrieve historical performance data for this transformation from lineage graph
    2. Predict future performance using trained time-series model
    3. Calculate anomaly score based on difference between predicted and actual performance
    4. IF anomaly score > threshold:
        5.  Determine appropriate remediation action:
            6.  IF rule exists for this anomaly:
                7.   Apply rule-based remediation
            8.  ELSE:
                9.   Invoke RL agent to select remediation action
        10. Execute remediation action
        11. Log remediation action & outcome in lineage graph
        12. Update anomaly score in lineage graph based on remediation success
END FOR
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Transformation Node:** (Existing) + `anomaly_score: float`
*   **Edge:** (Existing) + `anomaly_score: float`
*   **Remediation Log:** `timestamp: datetime`, `transformation_id: string`, `anomaly_type: string`, `action_taken: string`, `outcome: string`

**Scalability & Considerations:**

*   The RL agent will require significant training data. Initial training can be performed offline using historical data.
*   Model retraining will be necessary to adapt to changing data patterns and system configurations.
*   Resource management for the RL agent and model training will be critical.
*   Security measures must be implemented to prevent malicious remediation actions.
