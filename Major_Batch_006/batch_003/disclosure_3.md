## Dynamic Polymorphic Decoy Network

**Concept:** Extend the 'self-sabotage' principle of the patent to actively create and populate a decoy network designed to mislead attackers *before* the software module alters its behavior. Instead of waiting to be identified as a threat, the software proactively builds a believable, but false, digital environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** `DecoyNetManager` – responsible for network construction, population, and monitoring.
*   **Initialization:** Upon execution, `DecoyNetManager` identifies available network interfaces and generates a unique, isolated virtual network (using technologies like Docker networking or similar virtualization).
*   **Decoy Population:**
    *   `ServiceEmulator`: Creates lightweight emulations of common network services (HTTP, DNS, SMTP, SSH) with plausible, but fabricated, data. The level of emulation complexity is configurable.
    *   `DataFabricator`: Generates synthetic data mirroring common network traffic patterns (log files, database entries, web pages). This data is seeded with randomized elements and avoids direct copies of production data.
    *   `TrafficGenerator`: Creates realistic network traffic between the emulated services using the fabricated data. Traffic patterns are varied to avoid simple detection.
*   **Network Exposure:** The virtual network is exposed to the external network via a limited number of ports, masquerading as a legitimate service.
*   **Monitoring & Feedback:**
    *   `IntrusionDetector`: Monitors the virtual network for incoming connections and malicious activity.
    *   `BehavioralAnalyzer`: Analyzes the attacker’s interactions with the virtual network to gather intelligence and refine the decoy environment.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** The core software module, upon detecting unauthorized execution, signals `DecoyNetManager` to activate the decoy network and redirect incoming traffic.
*    **Dynamic Adaptation:** The decoy network dynamically adapts to attacker behavior, creating new services, modifying data, and adjusting traffic patterns to maintain believability.

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialization (upon software module execution)
DecoyNetManager.initialize(networkInterfaces)
virtualNetwork = DecoyNetManager.createVirtualNetwork(networkInterfaces)
serviceEmulator = ServiceEmulator(virtualNetwork)
dataFabricator = DataFabricator(virtualNetwork)
trafficGenerator = TrafficGenerator(virtualNetwork)

// Background Task
while (true) {
    trafficGenerator.generateTraffic(dataFabricator.createData())
}

// Upon Unauthorized Execution Detection
if (unauthorizedExecutionDetected()) {
    DecoyNetManager.activate(virtualNetwork)
    redirectTrafficToVirtualNetwork()
}

// Intrusion Detection/Behavioral Analysis
onIncomingConnection(connection) {
    IntrusionDetector.analyze(connection)
    BehavioralAnalyzer.track(connection)
    // Adjust decoy environment based on analysis
}
```

**Novelty:** This system isn’t about *reacting* to detection; it’s about proactively creating a deceptive environment that draws attackers away from legitimate systems *before* self-sabotage is triggered. It adds a pre-emptive layer of defense. The dynamic adaptation and intelligent traffic generation increase believability and effectiveness.
