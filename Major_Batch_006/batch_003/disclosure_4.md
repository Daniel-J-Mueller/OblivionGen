## Adaptive Encryption Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamic adjustment of encryption block size based on data sensitivity and access patterns.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Sensitivity Profiler:** A module analyzing data *within* the block storage volume. It employs machine learning to categorize data blocks based on content – e.g., PII, financial records, logs, generic data.  Outputs a sensitivity score (0-100) per block.
*   **Access Pattern Monitor:** Tracks read/write operations on each data block. Records frequency, user/application initiating access, and time of access.
*   **Encryption Manager:**  The central control unit.  Receives sensitivity scores & access patterns.  Dynamically adjusts encryption block size & key rotation schedule.
*   **Micro-Encryption Engine:** Hardware or software component enabling encryption/decryption of data blocks at a granular level (smaller than traditional block sizes). This could leverage advanced encryption standard (AES) variants with variable key lengths.
*   **Metadata Store:**  Stores metadata about each block: sensitivity score, current encryption key, encryption block size, last accessed timestamp.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Profiling:**  Upon volume creation, the Sensitivity Profiler scans the data and assigns a sensitivity score to each block. Default block size & key are assigned.
2.  **Real-time Monitoring:**  The Access Pattern Monitor continuously tracks data access.
3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The Encryption Manager periodically (or event-triggered) analyzes sensitivity scores & access patterns. Based on this:
    *   **Sensitivity-Driven Resizing:** Highly sensitive blocks are segmented into *smaller* encryption blocks. This limits the impact of a potential compromise – even if one small block is breached, the attacker gains less data. Lower sensitivity blocks can be grouped into *larger* blocks for performance.
    *   **Access-Driven Key Rotation:**  Frequently accessed blocks receive more frequent key rotation.  Infrequently accessed blocks can have longer rotation intervals.
    *   **Adaptive Block Sizes:** Blocks can be subdivided/combined on the fly to respond to changing access/sensitivity levels.
4.  **Encryption/Decryption:** The Micro-Encryption Engine handles the encryption/decryption of individual blocks according to their assigned parameters.  

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Block Structure
struct DataBlock {
  blockID: integer;
  sensitivityScore: integer (0-100);
  blockSize: integer (bytes);
  encryptionKeyID: integer;
  lastAccessed: timestamp;
  data: byte[];
}

// Encryption Manager – Main Loop
function manageEncryption() {
  while (true) {
    for each block in volume {
      // Update sensitivity score (periodic re-scan)
      block.sensitivityScore = sensitivityProfiler.analyze(block.data);

      // Adjust block size
      if (block.sensitivityScore > 80) {
        block.blockSize = 1024; // Small block
      } else if (block.sensitivityScore > 50) {
        block.blockSize = 4096; // Medium block
      } else {
        block.blockSize = 16384; // Large block
      }

      // Key rotation
      if (block.lastAccessed > keyRotationThreshold) {
        block.encryptionKeyID = keyManager.generateKey();
        block.lastAccessed = currentTime();
      }

      // Apply encryption/decryption
      microEncryptionEngine.encryptDecrypt(block);
    }
    sleep(interval);
  }
}
```

**IV.  Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated hardware acceleration for encryption/decryption would significantly improve performance. (e.g., dedicated AES engines).
*   Utilize non-volatile memory express (NVMe) storage for low latency access to encrypted blocks.
*   Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for secure key storage and management.
