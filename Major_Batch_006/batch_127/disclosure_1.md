## Decentralized Data Sovereignty with Dynamic Mesh Encryption

**Concept:** Extend geographic restriction beyond simple access control to a dynamic, mesh-encrypted network where data fragments are distributed *and* encrypted based on authorized geographic regions. This shifts from *preventing* access to *obscuring* data outside of authorized zones.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Fragmentation & Geographic Tagging:** Incoming customer data is algorithmically fragmented into multiple pieces. Each fragment is tagged with a geographic region authorization profile – a list of permissible geographic zones.

2.  **Mesh Network Construction:** A secure, overlay mesh network is established, leveraging geographically distributed storage nodes. These nodes are organized by their assigned geographic region(s).

3.  **Fragment Distribution & Encryption:** Each fragment is encrypted *not* with a single key, but with a key derived from a combination of the customer’s master key *and* the geographic region of the storage node receiving it. This means the same fragment will have different encryption keys depending on where it's stored. Fragments are distributed across nodes authorized for the associated geographic region(s).

4.  **Access Request Handling:** When a resource requests data, the system determines the requesting resource’s location. It then constructs a request for data fragments from authorized nodes *within* that region.  Fragments are assembled and decrypted *only* after enough fragments from authorized regions are collected.

5.  **Dynamic Region Adjustment:**  Regions can be dynamically adjusted based on customer needs or regulatory changes. This triggers a re-fragmentation and redistribution of data, ensuring continued compliance and security.

6.  **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** Implement a consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft, PBFT) to tolerate failures or malicious behavior of storage nodes.

**Pseudocode (Access Request):**

```
function accessData(customerID, dataID, requestingResourceLocation):
  authorizedRegions = getCustomerAuthorizedRegions(customerID, dataID)
  nearbyAuthorizedNodes = findNodesInRegion(authorizedRegions, requestingResourceLocation)

  if nearbyAuthorizedNodes is empty:
    return "Access Denied: No authorized nodes nearby"

  fragmentRequests = createFragmentRequests(dataID, nearbyAuthorizedNodes)
  fragmentResponses = sendFragmentRequests(fragmentRequests)

  if fragmentResponses.count < requiredFragments:
    return "Access Denied: Insufficient fragments received"

  decryptedData = decryptFragments(fragmentResponses)
  return decryptedData
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Geographically distributed storage nodes (cloud or on-premise).
*   Secure key management system.
*   Encryption libraries (AES, ChaCha20).
*   Secure communication protocols (TLS, WireGuard).
*   Distributed consensus algorithm implementation.
*   Location services API (for resource location detection).
