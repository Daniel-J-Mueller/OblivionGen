## Adaptive Predictive Framing

**Concept:** Enhance the pre/post-event capture by dynamically adjusting the field of view (FOV) and capture parameters *before* an event is even detected, based on learned environmental patterns and predictive algorithms. This goes beyond simple motion detection and attempts to *anticipate* relevant visual information.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Standard Camera (as in the reference patent).
    *   Depth Sensor (To create 3D maps of the environment, aiding FOV prediction).
    *   Microphone Array (For audio event detection, providing context to visual prediction).
*   **Predictive Engine:**
    *   **Learning Phase:** The system learns typical environmental states (e.g., time of day, weather conditions, user schedules) and associated visual patterns within the monitored area.  This is achieved through a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical data.
    *   **Prediction Algorithm:**  Based on the current environmental state, the RNN predicts the *most likely areas of interest* within the FOV. This is represented as a ‘heat map’ overlay on the camera's view.
    *   **Dynamic FOV Adjustment:**  The camera lens (or a digital pan/tilt/zoom mechanism) dynamically adjusts the FOV to prioritize the predicted areas of interest.  For example, if the system predicts a person approaching the door, it will widen the FOV and center on that predicted path.
*   **Capture Protocol:**
    1.  **Baseline Capture (Low Power):** As in the reference patent, capture low-resolution, low-framerate images (e.g., 5 fps) of the entire monitored area.
    2.  **Predictive Framing:**  Based on the RNN’s predictions, allocate a higher resolution and framerate (e.g., 30 fps) to the predicted areas of interest *within* the baseline capture.  This is done by strategically selecting and processing specific regions of the camera sensor.
    3.  **Event Trigger:**  Standard motion detection (or other event detection methods) triggers full-resolution, high-framerate capture.
    4.  **Pre/Post Event Capture:** Capture a pre-event window using the dynamically framed capture data, followed by a full-resolution capture window.
*   **Data Buffering:**
    *   Store the dynamically framed pre-event data in a dedicated buffer separate from the full-resolution capture buffer.
    *   Combine the dynamically framed pre-event data with the full-resolution capture data before transmission.
*   **Pseudocode (Predictive Framing):**

```
function PredictiveFrame(currentFrame, predictionHeatmap):
  // PredictionHeatmap is a 2D array representing the probability of interest for each pixel
  // Apply a weighted mask to the currentFrame based on the PredictionHeatmap
  // Higher weights = higher resolution/framerate for that region

  maskedFrame = applyMask(currentFrame, PredictionHeatmap)

  // Upscale regions with high weights
  highInterestRegions = extractHighInterestRegions(PredictionHeatmap, threshold)
  for region in highInterestRegions:
    upscaleRegion(maskedFrame, region, scaleFactor)

  return maskedFrame
```

**Rationale:** This system proactively prepares for events by prioritizing likely areas of interest.  It reduces wasted bandwidth and storage by only capturing detailed video of relevant areas *before* an event is even detected.  The dynamic FOV adjustment increases the likelihood of capturing critical details, even if the event occurs outside the initial FOV. This system is a more intelligent, proactive approach to security capture.
