## Proactive Dietary Adjustment System

**Core Concept:** Extend predictive ordering beyond *what* and *when* to *what nutritional profile* based on real-time biometric and environmental data, preemptively modifying orders to optimize health and performance.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Wearable Biometric Sensors: Continuous heart rate, blood glucose (CGM), sleep quality, activity levels, stress markers (cortisol via sweat sensors).
    *   Environmental Sensors: Air quality (particulate matter, ozone), UV index, pollen count.
    *   User Input: Dietary restrictions, allergies, preferences, stated goals (weight loss, muscle gain, improved energy).
    *   Order History: Previous meals, restaurant choices, modifications.
    *   Real-Time Location: GPS for localized environmental data & restaurant proximity.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge computing (wearable) + cloud-based AI model.
*   **AI Model:**
    *   Nutritional Need Prediction: Predicts optimal macronutrient & micronutrient intake based on biometric, environmental, and user data. Utilizes a personalized base model trained on a large dataset of dietary science and augmented with the user’s unique data stream.
    *   Order Modification Engine: Adjusts menu item selection or requests modifications (e.g., “hold the mayo”, “add extra vegetables”, “substitute grilled chicken for fried”) to align with predicted nutritional needs.
    *   Restaurant Compatibility Matrix: Maintains a database of menu items and potential modifications for participating restaurants.
    *   Predictive Health Impact Assessment: Estimates the short and long-term health impacts of each meal based on nutritional profile, activity level, and environmental factors. (e.g. "This meal will likely cause a post-meal energy dip.")
*   **Output & User Interface:**
    *   Automatic Order Modification: System automatically modifies orders before submission (with user override option).
    *   Nutritional Summary: Displays the predicted nutritional profile of the meal and its anticipated impact on health and performance.
    *   "Nudge" System: Provides personalized recommendations to optimize dietary choices (e.g., “Consider adding a side of fruit to increase vitamin C intake”).
    *   Health Trend Visualization: Tracks key health metrics over time and provides insights into the impact of dietary choices.

**Pseudocode - Order Processing Flow:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessOrder(order):
    biometricData = GetBiometricData()
    environmentalData = GetEnvironmentalData()
    predictedNeeds = CalculatePredictedNutritionalNeeds(biometricData, environmentalData, userProfile)
    modifiedOrder = AdjustOrderToMeetNeeds(order, predictedNeeds, restaurantMenu)
    impactAssessment = AssessHealthImpact(modifiedOrder)
    DISPLAY impactAssessment TO user
    IF user approves modifiedOrder:
        SUBMIT order
    ELSE:
        ALLOW user to manually modify order
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculatePredictedNutritionalNeeds(biometricData, environmentalData, userProfile):
    // Access user’s dietary goals, restrictions, and preferences
    // Analyze biometric data (heart rate, blood glucose, activity levels, sleep quality)
    // Consider environmental factors (air quality, UV index)
    // Use AI model to predict optimal macronutrient & micronutrient intake
    RETURN predictedNutritionalNeeds
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION AdjustOrderToMeetNeeds(order, predictedNutritionalNeeds, restaurantMenu):
    // Analyze menu items in the order
    // Identify nutritional gaps or excesses
    // Suggest modifications to align with predicted needs (e.g., ingredient swaps, portion adjustments)
    // Automatically apply modifications (with user override option)
    RETURN modifiedOrder
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION AssessHealthImpact(order):
    // Analyze nutritional profile of the order
    // Estimate short and long-term health impacts based on user's biometric data and activity level
    // Generate a personalized health impact summary
    RETURN healthImpactSummary
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** Extends predictive ordering from *convenience* to *proactive health optimization*, using real-time data and AI to personalize dietary choices and improve health outcomes. It's a shift from *fulfilling* cravings to *fueling* performance.
