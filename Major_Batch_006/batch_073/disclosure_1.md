## Adaptive Query Routing with Predictive Contextual Drift

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:** Implement a system that not only routes queries to an external component based on failure rate, but *predicts* shifts in topical focus (contextual drift) and proactively adjusts routing strategies. This goes beyond simple failure rate thresholds; it anticipates knowledge gaps *before* they manifest as failures.

**Components:**

*   **Query Embedding Module:** Utilizes a transformer-based model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to generate high-dimensional vector embeddings of incoming queries.
*   **Contextual Drift Detector:**
    *   **Training Data:** Historical query embeddings tagged with subject matter classifications.
    *   **Model:** Anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) trained on the historical embeddings.
    *   **Function:** Monitors incoming query embeddings for deviations from the established baseline, signaling contextual drift.  Output is a ‘drift score’.
*   **Dynamic Routing Manager:**
    *   **Input:** Drift score, current failure rate, query embedding.
    *   **Logic:**  A state machine with adjustable thresholds. States:
        *   *Normal:* Route to knowledge database.
        *   *Warning:*  Drift score exceeds threshold, failure rate is low. Begin logging queries, increase logging granularity.
        *   *Critical:*  Drift score exceeds higher threshold, failure rate is elevated.  Route to external component. Increase routing probability to external component gradually.
        *   *Adaptive:* If external component provides consistent, high-quality answers, transition to a state where a higher percentage of related queries are routed directly to the external component *without* initially going through the knowledge database.
*   **Feedback Loop:** External component responses are analyzed for relevance and quality. This data is used to refine the contextual drift detection model and the dynamic routing manager’s thresholds.
*   **Knowledge Database Enrichment Module:**  When the external component successfully answers a query, the system automatically proposes new entities/relationships to the knowledge database, based on information extracted from the external component’s response.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Routing Manager):**

```
function routeQuery(queryEmbedding, currentFailureRate, driftScore):
  if driftScore < DRIFT_THRESHOLD_LOW and currentFailureRate < FAILURE_THRESHOLD_LOW:
    routeToKnowledgeDatabase(queryEmbedding)
  elif driftScore > DRIFT_THRESHOLD_HIGH or currentFailureRate > FAILURE_THRESHOLD_HIGH:
    routeToExternalComponent(queryEmbedding)
  else:
    //Gradual adjustment based on history
    if (historyOfExternalComponentResponsesGood > 0.8):
      routeToExternalComponent(queryEmbedding)
    else:
      routeToKnowledgeDatabase(queryEmbedding)

  //Update Historical Data
  updateHistory(queryEmbedding, response)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Query History:** Stores query embeddings, response data, routing decisions, and outcome metrics (success/failure, relevance score).
*   **Drift Baseline:** Stores historical query embeddings used to establish a baseline for contextual drift detection.
*   **Routing Table:** Maps query embeddings to routing probabilities (probability of sending the query to the external component).

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond reactive routing based solely on failure rates. It proactively anticipates knowledge gaps using contextual drift detection and adapts routing strategies accordingly, resulting in a more resilient and efficient query answering system. The adaptive component creates a learning loop where the system increasingly leverages external expertise in emerging areas while retaining internal knowledge in established domains.
