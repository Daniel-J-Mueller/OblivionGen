## Dynamic Neural Network Partitioning via Resource Prediction

**Concept:** A system that dynamically partitions a neural network model across multiple heterogeneous neural network processors *during runtime* based on predicted resource utilization and communication costs. This differs from static partitioning by adapting to varying input data characteristics and system load.

**Specifications:**

*   **Profiling Module:** An initial profiling stage (executed offline or during initial system setup) to characterize the resource consumption (compute, memory, bandwidth) of individual layers or subgraphs of the neural network on different available processors. This profile data is stored as a lookup table.
*   **Input Data Analyzer:** A module that analyzes the incoming input data to estimate its complexity. This could include statistical features (e.g., entropy, variance), size, or specific patterns indicative of computational load.
*   **Resource Prediction Engine:** This core module predicts the resource utilization of each layer/subgraph on each available processor based on the input data analysis and the profiling data. Uses a predictive model (e.g., regression, neural network) trained on the profiling data.
*   **Cost Model:**  A function that estimates the communication cost between processors for transferring intermediate results. This considers network bandwidth, latency, and data size.  Includes a penalty for excessive data transfer.
*   **Partitioning Optimizer:** An optimization algorithm (e.g., genetic algorithm, simulated annealing) that searches for the optimal partitioning of the network across processors. The objective function minimizes total execution time (considering both computation and communication costs) and balances load across processors.
*   **Runtime Scheduler:** A scheduler that dynamically assigns tasks (layers/subgraphs) to processors based on the output of the partitioning optimizer and monitors resource utilization during execution. It dynamically re-partitions if resource availability changes significantly.
*   **Inter-Processor Communication Handler:** A low-latency, high-bandwidth communication protocol between processors. Utilizes Direct Memory Access (DMA) to minimize CPU overhead.

**Pseudocode for Runtime Re-Partitioning:**

```
function rePartition(inputData, currentPartition, resourceUsage):
  complexity = analyzeInputData(inputData)
  
  possiblePartitions = generatePossiblePartitions(networkGraph)
  
  bestPartition = null
  minCost = infinity
  
  for partition in possiblePartitions:
    cost = 0
    for layer in networkGraph:
      processor = partition[layer]
      resourcePrediction = predictResourceUsage(layer, inputData, processor)
      cost += resourcePrediction.computeCost + communicationCost(layer, processor)
    
    if cost < minCost:
      minCost = cost
      bestPartition = partition
  
  //Transition to best partition (handle data transfer)
  transferData(currentPartition, bestPartition)
  currentPartition = bestPartition
  
  return currentPartition
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Heterogeneous processors with varying computational strengths and memory capacities.
*   High-speed interconnect (e.g., NVLink, PCIe Gen5) between processors.
*   DMA controllers to facilitate efficient data transfer.
*   Hardware acceleration for communication protocols.
