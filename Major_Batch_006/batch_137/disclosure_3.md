## Adaptive Haptic Notification System

**Concept:** Extend the interruption model to incorporate localized haptic feedback delivered via wearable devices (smartwatches, bands, clothing) synchronized with visual and auditory notifications on a primary display. This goes beyond simple vibration alerts, aiming for nuanced haptic patterns conveying content *type* and *urgency* in a pre-attentive manner.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Vocabulary:** Define a library of distinct haptic patterns (waveforms, durations, intensities, localized pressure points) corresponding to various content categories:
    *   **Communication:** Rapid, pulsing pattern localized to the wrist. Intensity scales with sender priority (e.g., starred contacts).
    *   **Alerts/Reminders:** Short, sharp tap on the forearm. Urgency indicated by repetition rate.
    *   **Social Media:** Gentle, flowing wave across the back of the hand.
    *   **Navigation:** Directional taps corresponding to turn cues.
    *   **Music/Entertainment:** Rhythmic pulses synchronized with audio beat/events.
    *   **System/Critical:** Intense, sustained vibration across a larger area (e.g., upper arm).

*   **Wearable Integration:** API for communication between the primary device (running the core interruption model) and a range of wearable devices. This API must support:
    *   Precise control over haptic actuator arrays.
    *   Real-time synchronization of haptic feedback with visual/auditory content.
    *   User-configurable haptic profiles (customization of patterns per content type).
    *   Calibration routines to account for individual skin sensitivity and wearable placement.

*   **AI-Driven Pattern Generation:** Implement a machine learning model trained to generate novel haptic patterns based on:
    *   Content analysis (text, images, audio)
    *   User context (location, activity, time of day)
    *   Emotional state (estimated from bio-sensors or user input)

*   **Multi-Layered Interruption Model:** Enhance the existing model to incorporate haptic feedback as an additional interruption layer. This layer allows for:
    *   **Pre-Attentive Signaling:** Deliver crucial information *before* the user consciously shifts attention to the primary display.
    *   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Convey information non-visually/auditorily, minimizing distractions from ongoing tasks.
    *   **Personalized Interruption Handling:** Adapt interruption strategy based on user preferences, context, and content type.

**Pseudocode (Interruption Model Integration):**

```
function handleIncomingContent(content, metadata) {
  //Existing logic for visual/auditory interruption

  //Determine haptic interruption level based on metadata
  hapticLevel = determineHapticLevel(metadata)

  //Generate or select haptic pattern
  hapticPattern = generateHapticPattern(hapticLevel, metadata)

  //Send haptic command to wearable
  sendHapticCommand(wearableDevice, hapticPattern)

  //Adjust visual/auditory interruption based on haptic feedback
  adjustInterruption(hapticFeedbackReceived)
}

function generateHapticPattern(level, metadata) {
  //Check if custom pattern exists for content type
  if (customPatternExists(metadata.contentType)) {
    return loadCustomPattern(metadata.contentType)
  } else {
    //Generate pattern based on level and metadata
    pattern = generateDefaultPattern(level)
    //Modulate pattern based on content features (e.g., emotion, urgency)
    pattern = modulatePattern(pattern, metadata.contentFeatures)
    return pattern
  }
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with augmented reality displays to project haptic feedback onto the skin.
*   Development of advanced haptic materials with variable stiffness and texture.
*   Use of biofeedback sensors to dynamically adjust haptic patterns based on user stress levels.
