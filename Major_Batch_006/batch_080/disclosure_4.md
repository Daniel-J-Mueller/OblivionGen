## Autonomous Signal Source 'Gardening' with Swarm UAVs

**Concept:** Extend the UAV signal surveying beyond simple detection and trust assignment. Implement a system where UAVs actively *manage* signal environments – a kind of ‘signal gardening’ – by strategically deploying localized, temporary signal boosters/jammers based on real-time assessment of signal quality, interference, and identified rogue sources.

**Specs:**

*   **UAV Hardware:**
    *   Standard multi-rotor UAV platform capable of carrying a 500g payload.
    *   High-precision GPS/IMU for accurate positioning.
    *   Directional antenna array for signal triangulation and source identification.
    *   Modular payload bay for interchangeable signal modules.
    *   Onboard processing unit (GPU/FPGA) for real-time signal analysis.
*   **Signal Modules:**
    *   **Miniature Signal Booster:** Amplifies weak but legitimate signals (e.g., emergency beacons, IoT devices in range) – range: 100m, adjustable gain.
    *   **Directional Jammer:** Suppresses rogue or interfering signals – adjustable frequency and power output (limited to legal parameters).
    *   **Signal Decoy:** Emits a benign signal mimicking a legitimate source, luring rogue sources into revealing their location or disrupting their operation.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Dynamic Signal Map:**  A real-time, spatially-aware map of signal sources, strengths, types, and trust levels – generated from data collected by the UAV swarm.
    *   **Signal Anomaly Detection:** Algorithm identifies unusual signal patterns indicating potential threats (e.g., spoofing, jamming, unauthorized access).
    *   **Autonomous Deployment Logic:** 
        1.  UAV identifies a weak, legitimate signal. 
        2.  UAV calculates optimal deployment location for a signal booster, considering signal propagation and obstacles.
        3.  UAV deploys booster (temporary mounting via magnetic/adhesive mechanism).
        4.  UAV monitors booster performance and adjusts settings.
        5.  UAV periodically retrieves booster for recharge/recalibration.
    *   **Rogue Source Containment Logic:**
        1.  UAV identifies a rogue signal source (based on trust level and signal characteristics).
        2.  UAV deploys a directional jammer, focusing on the rogue source’s frequency.
        3.  UAV monitors the effectiveness of the jamming and adjusts parameters.
        4.  UAV relays location data to authorities for investigation.
    *   **Swarm Coordination:** A distributed algorithm enables UAVs to share data, coordinate deployments, and avoid collisions.
    *   **Ground Control Station (GCS):**  Provides a user interface for monitoring the swarm, viewing the signal map, and configuring deployment parameters.

**Pseudocode (Deployment Logic):**

```
// UAV receives signal data
signal_data = receive_signal_data()

// Check signal strength and trust level
if signal_data.strength < threshold and signal_data.trust_level == "unknown":
    // Attempt to verify signal legitimacy
    verification_result = verify_signal(signal_data)

    if verification_result == "legitimate":
        // Deploy signal booster
        deploy_booster(signal_data.location)
        monitor_booster_performance()
    else:
        // Mark signal as potentially rogue
        mark_as_rogue(signal_data)
        investigate_signal(signal_data)
else if signal_data.trust_level == "untrusted":
    // Deploy jammer
    deploy_jammer(signal_data.location, signal_data.frequency)
    monitor_jammer_performance()
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond *detecting* signal issues to actively *managing* the signal environment.  The combination of autonomous deployment of temporary signal boosters and jammers, coupled with swarm coordination, creates a dynamic and adaptable solution for improving signal quality, security, and resilience.  The 'signal gardening' analogy highlights the proactive, maintenance-oriented approach.
