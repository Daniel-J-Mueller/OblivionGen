## Dynamic Intent Graph Construction & Pruning

**Concept:** This builds upon the idea of finite state transducers (FSTs) but introduces a system where the *structure* of the intent graph itself is dynamically modified based on user interaction and confidence levels, not just the weights *within* a pre-defined graph. It's essentially a self-modifying NLU system.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A ‘Graph Evolution Engine’ (GEE).
*   **Input:** NLU processing data (intent, confidence, slots) *and* user feedback (explicit rating, implicit via session continuation/abandonment).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Base Intent Graph: A pre-built FST representing common intents.
    *   Dynamic Node Library: A repository of FST nodes representing new/modified intent segments. These are built from frequently misclassified utterances or novel user requests.
    *   Confidence Thresholds: Configurable levels for triggering graph modifications.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Initial Processing:** User input is processed using the Base Intent Graph.
    2.  **Confidence Evaluation:**  Confidence scores for the identified intent are assessed.
    3.  **Modification Trigger:** If confidence falls below a threshold *and* the utterance demonstrates a pattern not well-represented in the graph (detected via a novelty detection algorithm – e.g., low embedding similarity to existing nodes), the GEE is activated.
    4.  **Dynamic Node Creation:**
        *   A new FST node representing the problematic utterance's intent is created. This node is initially ‘isolated’.
        *   The node is populated with slot data extracted from the utterance.
        *   The GEE analyzes related utterances (using semantic similarity) and attempts to *connect* the new node to the existing graph. The connection is weighted based on the similarity score.
    5.  **Graph Pruning:** A separate process monitors node usage. Nodes with consistently low activation (indicating they represent rarely used or obsolete intents) are flagged for pruning. The system automatically prompts for confirmation before removing a node.
    6.  **Feedback Integration:** User feedback (explicit ratings, session outcomes) is used to refine node connections and weights. Positive feedback strengthens connections; negative feedback weakens them.
    7.  **Version Control:**  Each graph modification is versioned, allowing for rollback to previous states.
*   **Pseudocode (GEE – Simplified):**

```
function evolve_graph(user_utterance, confidence_score, feedback):
  if confidence_score < threshold and is_novel_utterance(user_utterance):
    new_node = create_fst_node(user_utterance)
    similar_nodes = find_similar_nodes(new_node)
    connect_nodes(new_node, similar_nodes)  // Weighted connection
    update_node_weights(feedback)
  else:
    update_existing_node_weights(feedback)

function prune_graph():
  for node in graph:
    if node.usage_count < pruning_threshold:
      prompt_for_confirmation()
      if confirmed:
        remove_node(node)
```

*   **Hardware/Software Requirements:**  High-performance computing infrastructure to handle the graph operations. GPU acceleration for FST processing and similarity calculations.  Scalable data storage for graph versions and user interaction logs. Python with libraries like OpenFST, scikit-learn, and a deep learning framework (TensorFlow/PyTorch).

*   **Potential Applications:**  Highly adaptive chatbots, voice assistants, and virtual agents. Personalized user experiences. Improved accuracy and robustness of NLU systems in dynamic environments.  Automated intent discovery.
