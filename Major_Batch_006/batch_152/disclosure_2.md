## Secure, Time-Limited Data ‘Bloom’

**Concept:** Leverage the key exchange/authorization framework of the patent to create dynamically expiring data ‘blooms’ accessible via generated URLs. These blooms aren't full data sets, but compact probabilistic representations (Bloom filters) allowing clients to *quickly* determine if a larger dataset *might* contain a specific element *without* needing the full dataset or direct access. The security relies on the time-limited key within the URL; after the key expires, the bloom becomes useless – even if intercepted.

**Specs:**

*   **Bloom Filter Generation Service:** A service responsible for creating Bloom filters from provided datasets. Input: Dataset, TTL (Time To Live - expressed in seconds), signing key ID. Output: Serialized Bloom Filter, URL (see below).
*   **URL Structure:** `https://data-bloom.example.com/{bloom-id}?key={encrypted-key}&ttl={ttl}`
    *   `bloom-id`: Unique identifier for the bloom filter.
    *   `encrypted-key`: AES-256 encrypted symmetric key used to decrypt the bloom filter data. Key encryption utilizes the service provider's public key.
    *   `ttl`: Time-to-live (in seconds) for the key. After this time, access is denied.
*   **Data Storage:** Bloom filters are stored in a secure, encrypted format (AES-256) keyed with a unique, randomly generated symmetric key. The symmetric key itself is encrypted using the service provider’s public key and embedded in the URL as `encrypted-key`.
*   **Request Handling:**
    1.  Client requests a bloom filter via the generated URL.
    2.  Service receives the request.
    3.  Service validates the `ttl` – if expired, return error.
    4.  Service decrypts the `encrypted-key` using its private key.
    5.  Service decrypts the Bloom filter using the decrypted symmetric key.
    6.  Client sends a query element.
    7.  Service checks if the element *might* be present in the Bloom filter.
    8.  Service returns a boolean (true/false).
*   **Signing Key Management:**  The service utilizes multiple signing keys for added security.  The signing key ID is part of the bloom filter generation request allowing key rotation and revocation.
*   **Bloom Filter Parameters:** Adjustable parameters to control false positive rate and memory usage. These parameters should be configurable on a per-bloom basis.  (e.g., Bit array size, number of hash functions).
*   **Pseudocode (Service):**

```
function handleBloomRequest(url):
  ttl = getTTLFromURL(url)
  if currentTime > ttl:
    return ERROR_EXPIRED

  encryptedKey = getEncryptedKeyFromURL(url)
  key = decryptKey(encryptedKey, privateKey) //Service provider's private key

  bloomFilter = getBloomFilter(url)
  decryptedBloomFilter = decryptBloomFilter(bloomFilter, key)

  queryElement = getQueryElement()
  isPresent = checkElementInBloomFilter(queryElement, decryptedBloomFilter)
  return isPresent
```

**Innovation:** This provides a secure, time-limited way to query a *possibility* of data existence without revealing the data itself. Applications: Spam filtering, malware detection, deduplication, caching, and secure data sharing where exact data transmission is undesirable.  Unlike traditional access control, it doesn't grant access to the underlying data, only a probabilistic assessment. It leverages the existing key-based authentication to provide a dynamic, expiring ‘hint’ about data presence. This goes beyond simple access control by adding a probabilistic dimension and a strong time limit.
