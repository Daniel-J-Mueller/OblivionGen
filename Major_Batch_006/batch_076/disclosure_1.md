## Dynamic Evasion Profile Generation & Proactive Blocking

**Concept:** Instead of solely reacting to evasive listings *after* they're posted, we proactively build evasion profiles based on observed patterns and predictively block listings likely to employ those techniques. This shifts the focus from detection to prevention.

**Specifications:**

**1. Evasion Pattern Database:**

*   **Data Source:** Log all tokenization, spell correction, and classification data from existing system (patent 11972424). Supplement this with data from successful/bypassed evasions (identified via user reporting & manual review).
*   **Pattern Types:**
    *   **Character Substitution:** Frequency of specific character replacements (e.g., 'o' for '0', 'l' for '1'). Track substitutions *in context* (e.g., is '0' frequently used instead of 'o' *within* product names?).
    *   **Non-ASCII Character Usage:**  Identify common non-ASCII characters used as replacements or obfuscation techniques. Track character origin (language) as a signal.
    *   **Whitespace Manipulation:** Track patterns of excessive or unusual whitespace, its placement within words/phrases, and correlation to keyword usage.
    *   **Keyword Splitting/Concatenation:**  Log instances of keywords broken into multiple tokens (e.g., “viagra” as “vi” + “agra”) or illegitimately concatenated.
    *   **Contextual Keyword Proximity:** Track instances where keywords appear near terms commonly used in evasive listings.
*   **Data Structure:**  A weighted graph where nodes represent patterns, and edges represent co-occurrence frequency. Weights reflect the strength of the evasion signal.

**2. Proactive Listing Analysis Engine:**

*   **Input:** New listing data (title, description, etc.).
*   **Preprocessing:**  Perform standard tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal.
*   **Feature Extraction:**  Calculate a feature vector representing the listing’s characteristics. This includes:
    *   Frequency of each character substitution.
    *   Proportion of non-ASCII characters.
    *   Whitespace statistics.
    *   Keyword splitting/concatenation likelihood (using a Markov model).
    *   Proximity scores to known evasion terms.
*   **Evasion Profile Matching:**
    *   Compare the feature vector to the evasion pattern database.
    *   Use a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity) to identify the closest matching evasion profiles.
    *   Calculate an "Evasion Score" based on the similarity and the weight of the matched profiles.

**3. Dynamic Blocking & Throttling:**

*   **Thresholds:** Define multiple thresholds for the Evasion Score.
    *   **Low:**  Flag for manual review.
    *   **Medium:**  Temporary throttling of listing visibility (e.g., reduced ranking in search results).
    *   **High:**  Automatic blocking of the listing.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:**  Dynamically adjust thresholds based on feedback from manual review and successful evasion attempts.  (Reinforcement Learning could be employed here).
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Manual review of flagged listings provides training data to refine the Evasion Profile Database and adjust thresholds.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyze_listing(listing_data):
  features = extract_features(listing_data)
  closest_profiles = find_closest_profiles(features, evasion_profile_database)
  evasion_score = calculate_evasion_score(closest_profiles)

  if evasion_score > high_threshold:
    block_listing(listing_data)
  elif evasion_score > medium_threshold:
    throttle_listing(listing_data)
  elif evasion_score > low_threshold:
    flag_for_review(listing_data)

function extract_features(listing_data):
  # Perform tokenization, lemmatization, etc.
  # Calculate character substitution frequencies
  # Calculate non-ASCII character proportions
  # ... (other features)
  return feature_vector

function find_closest_profiles(feature_vector, evasion_profile_database):
  # Use cosine similarity or another similarity metric
  # Return a list of the most similar profiles
  return similar_profiles

function calculate_evasion_score(similar_profiles):
  # Calculate a weighted score based on the similarity
  # and the weight of each profile
  return evasion_score
```

This system moves beyond *detecting* evasive tactics to *predicting* and *preventing* them, creating a more proactive and robust defense against malicious listings.
