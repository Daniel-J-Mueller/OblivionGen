## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Personalized Command Mapping

**Concept:** A system that dynamically creates and manages localized acoustic zones within a physical space, coupled with user-specific command mappings. This goes beyond simple voice isolation and aims to allow multiple users to interact with multiple devices *simultaneously* without interference, and with commands interpreted based on *who* is speaking and *where* they are.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of miniaturized, beamforming microphones (minimum 8, ideally 16+) distributed across the physical space (room, office, vehicle). Each mic reports position data.
    *   Spatial audio processing unit (dedicated hardware accelerator preferred) capable of real-time sound source localization and beamforming.
    *   Low-latency wireless communication (WiFi 6E, UWB) for mic-to-processor data transfer.
    *   Multiple smart devices with integrated speakers/displays (the targets of voice commands).
    *   Optional: Visual sensors (cameras) to aid in user identification and location.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Acoustic Zoning Module:**
        *   Real-time sound source localization algorithms (triangulation, time difference of arrival).
        *   Dynamic zone creation based on detected speech sources. Zones are not fixed; they move and adapt.
        *   Zone overlap handling (priority based on user profiles or context).
        *   Noise suppression and echo cancellation *per zone*.
    *   **User Profile Management:**
        *   Voiceprint recognition for user identification.
        *   Command mapping customization (e.g., "lights on" means different things for different users).
        *   Device preference mapping (e.g., User A prefers to control lights with Device X, User B with Device Y).
        *   Contextual awareness (time of day, location, activity) to refine command interpretation.
    *   **Command Routing & Interpretation Module:**
        *   Incoming audio is associated with a specific acoustic zone and user profile.
        *   Command mapping is applied based on user profile and context.
        *   Commands are routed to the appropriate device(s) for execution.
        *   Feedback mechanisms (visual and auditory) to confirm command execution.
    *   **API for Integration:**
        *   Open API for third-party device and application integration.

**Pseudocode (Command Processing):**

```
function processCommand(audioData, micArrayData):
    zoneInfo = locateSoundSource(audioData, micArrayData)
    userId = identifyUser(audioData, zoneInfo.location)

    if userId == null:
        //Handle unrecognized user
        return

    userProfile = getUserProfile(userId)
    mappedCommand = mapCommand(userProfile, audioData, zoneInfo.location)

    if mappedCommand == null:
        //Handle unmapped command
        return

    targetDevice = findTargetDevice(mappedCommand, userProfile)

    executeCommand(targetDevice, mappedCommand)

    provideFeedback(targetDevice, mappedCommand)
```

**Innovation Focus:** The key here isn’t just voice control; it's *personalized* and *localized* voice control. It’s about creating a truly responsive environment that anticipates and adapts to individual needs, even in multi-user situations. This moves beyond “smart homes” to “intuitive environments.” The dynamic acoustic zones provide a foundation for privacy, reducing unwanted activation, and directing commands accurately.
