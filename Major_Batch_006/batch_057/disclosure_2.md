**Adaptive Acoustic Focusing with Phased Array Microphones & Integrated Haptic Feedback**

**Concept:** Enhance voice command accuracy and user experience by combining directional audio capture with localized haptic feedback indicating audio source location.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Replace the two microphones with a circular array of at least 8, ideally 16, miniature beamforming microphones. These should be flush-mounted with the device's outer surface.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Integrate an array of small, high-precision linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or piezoelectric actuators beneath the deviceâ€™s outer shell, corresponding to the microphone array positions.
*   **Signal Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP module.
    *   Beamforming Algorithm: Implement a real-time adaptive beamforming algorithm. The algorithm must dynamically adjust beam direction based on detected speech input, focusing on the strongest audio source.
    *   Source Localization: Utilize Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) calculations to pinpoint the direction of the incoming speech.
    *   Haptic Mapping: Map the localized audio source direction to the corresponding haptic actuator(s). The intensity of the haptic feedback should correspond to the signal strength.
*   **Software Interface:**
    *   Calibration Routine: A built-in calibration routine to map microphone/actuator pairs and account for device positioning.
    *   User Control: Allow users to adjust haptic intensity and enable/disable the feature.
*   **Power Management:** Optimized power consumption for continuous operation.
*   **Physical Integration:** Maintain existing device dimensions. The microphone array & haptic actuators should fit within the existing chassis.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
initializeMicrophoneArray()
initializeHapticActuatorArray()
calibrateSystem()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    audioData = captureAudio()
    sourceDirection = calculateSourceDirection(audioData)
    hapticIntensity = calculateHapticIntensity(audioData)

    activateHapticActuator(sourceDirection, hapticIntensity)
}

function calculateSourceDirection(audioData) {
    // Implement TDoA or similar algorithm to determine direction
    // Return direction as an angle or coordinate
}

function calculateHapticIntensity(audioData) {
    // Calculate intensity based on signal strength (dB)
    // Normalize to a suitable range for actuator control
}

function activateHapticActuator(direction, intensity) {
    // Determine which actuator corresponds to the direction
    // Set the actuator intensity
}
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

Current voice-activated devices often struggle in noisy environments or with multiple speakers. This adaptive acoustic focusing system aims to overcome these challenges by physically indicating the direction of the detected speech, improving command accuracy and creating a more intuitive user experience. The haptic feedback serves as a confirmation signal, enhancing usability and trust in the device. The system could also be used for accessibility purposes, providing directional cues for users with hearing impairments.
