## Dynamic Regional Music "Moodscapes"

**Concept:** Expand geographically tailored music beyond simple habit-based playlists to dynamically create "moodscapes" reflecting real-time emotional data aggregated from the region.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition Modules:**
    *   **Social Media Sentiment Analysis:** API integration with major platforms (X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok). Continuous monitoring of public posts, analyzing text & emojis for sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, anger, joy, sadness, fear). Geo-fencing applied for regional accuracy.
    *   **News Event Integration:** API access to regional news sources. Natural Language Processing (NLP) to categorize events (e.g., sports victories, natural disasters, economic announcements) and assign an "emotional impact" score.
    *   **Environmental Sensor Integration:** Real-time data feeds from weather stations (temperature, humidity, precipitation), traffic flow sensors, and potentially air quality monitors. These data points contribute to an "ambient emotional context."
    *   **Anonymous Mobile Device Data:** (Opt-in only). Aggregate data on device movement speed (indicative of stress/urgency), and audio environment (using device microphone to detect crowd noise/silence). Privacy is paramount; data *must* be anonymized and aggregated.

*   **Emotional Data Aggregation & Analysis:**
    *   A central "Mood Engine" processes all incoming data streams.
    *   Weighted scoring system: Each data source contributes to an overall "Regional Mood Score" across several emotional dimensions (e.g., energy level, positivity, calmness, anxiety). Weights are adjustable via a configuration panel.
    *   Time-based averaging & smoothing: To prevent rapid fluctuations, Mood Scores are averaged over configurable time windows (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour).

*   **Dynamic Playlist Generation:**
    *   A music library tagged with emotional attributes (e.g., "upbeat," "melancholy," "aggressive," "calming"). These tags can be crowdsourced and/or determined via AI analysis of song lyrics and musical features.
    *   The Playlist Engine selects songs based on the current Regional Mood Score.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   If the Regional Mood Score indicates high energy & positivity, select upbeat, high-tempo songs.
        *   If the score indicates low energy & sadness, select slower, more melancholic songs.
        *   If the score indicates anxiety/stress, select calming, ambient music.
        *   The algorithm dynamically adjusts the playlist in real-time, blending songs seamlessly based on mood changes.
    *   Genre weighting. Ability to preserve regional genre preferences even while adapting mood.

*   **Delivery System:**
    *   Integration with existing terrestrial radio infrastructure (AM/FM).
    *   Streaming via mobile app and connected vehicle platforms.
    *   API access for integration with smart home devices.

*   **User Customization:**
    *   Users can specify preferred genres or artists.
    *   "Mood Override" feature: Allows users to manually adjust the playlist to their liking.
    *   Privacy controls: Users can opt-out of data collection entirely.

**Pseudocode (Playlist Engine):**

```
function generatePlaylist(regionalMoodScore) {
  moodProfile = determineMoodProfile(regionalMoodScore);

  selectedSongs = [];
  songPool = getSongPool(moodProfile);

  while (playlistLength < targetLength) {
    song = selectSong(songPool);
    if (song.matchesMood(moodProfile)) {
      selectedSongs.add(song);
    }
  }

  return selectedSongs;
}

function determineMoodProfile(regionalMoodScore) {
  // Analyze moodScore data and return a mood profile (e.g., {energy: high, positivity: medium, calmness: low})
  // This function would contain logic to translate raw mood data into actionable mood dimensions.
}

function getSongPool(moodProfile) {
  // Query music library for songs matching the mood profile
  // Filter songs by genre preferences (user or regional)
}

function selectSong(songPool) {
  // Randomly select a song from the song pool
}

function matchesMood(song, moodProfile) {
    //Compare song's emotional attributes to moodProfile.
}
