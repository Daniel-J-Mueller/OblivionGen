## Dynamic Resolution Scaling Based on Predictive Scene Complexity

**Concept:** Instead of uniformly reducing processing based on simple change detection, proactively adjust rendering resolution *before* a scene change, anticipating computational load based on predicted visual complexity.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Video stream (frames) + Audio stream.  Sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope - optional, for improved prediction)
*   **Processing Units:**
    *   *Complexity Prediction Module:*  A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to predict ‘scene complexity’ from a small number of incoming frames (e.g. the last 3-5). Complexity is defined as the estimated number of salient features (edges, textures, objects) likely to be present in the subsequent frames. Output:  A ‘Complexity Score’ (0-100, higher = more complex).
    *   *Audio Analysis Module:* Analyze the audio stream for sudden changes in amplitude or frequency range. Output:  An ‘Audio Change Score’ (0-100, higher = more change).
    *   *Sensor Fusion Module (Optional):* Integrate accelerometer and gyroscope data to anticipate rapid camera movement, implying potential scene changes. Output: ‘Motion Anticipation Score’ (0-100).
    *   *Resolution Scaling Module:* Dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on a weighted combination of the Complexity Score, Audio Change Score, and Motion Anticipation Score. Resolution levels: High, Medium, Low, Very Low.
    *   *Temporal Smoothing Filter:* Applies a moving average filter to the resolution level to prevent rapid fluctuations and ensure a smoother viewing experience.

*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
ComplexityModel = LoadPretrainedComplexityModel()
TargetFrameRate = 60 // Frames per second
CurrentResolution = "High"

// Main Loop (for each frame)
frame = GetNextFrame()
audioData = GetNextAudioData()
sensorData = GetSensorData()

ComplexityScore = ComplexityModel.Predict(frame)
AudioChangeScore = AnalyzeAudio(audioData)
MotionAnticipationScore = AnalyzeSensorData(sensorData)

CombinedScore = (ComplexityScore * 0.6) + (AudioChangeScore * 0.2) + (MotionAnticipationScore * 0.2)

IF CombinedScore > 80 THEN
    TargetResolution = "Low"
ELSE IF CombinedScore > 60 THEN
    TargetResolution = "Medium"
ELSE IF CombinedScore > 40 THEN
    TargetResolution = "High"
ELSE
    TargetResolution = "Very Low"
END IF

SmoothedResolution = ApplyTemporalSmoothing(TargetResolution, CurrentResolution)

RenderFrame(frame, SmoothedResolution)

CurrentResolution = SmoothedResolution
```

*   **Data Structures:**

    *   `ComplexityScore`: Float (0.0 – 100.0)
    *   `AudioChangeScore`: Float (0.0 – 100.0)
    *   `MotionAnticipationScore`: Float (0.0 – 100.0)
    *   `ResolutionLevel`: Enum (VeryLow, Low, Medium, High)

*   **Hardware Requirements:**  GPU with variable rate shading capabilities. Dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) for Complexity Prediction Module.

*   **Potential Applications:**  Mobile gaming, live streaming, augmented reality, autonomous vehicles (reducing computational load during critical maneuvers).
