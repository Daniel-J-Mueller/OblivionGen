## Dynamic Content Stitching for Personalized Event Viewing

**Concept:** Extend the real-time event detection to proactively stitch together relevant content *around* the detected event, creating a personalized viewing experience. Instead of just offering options to jump *into* the event, the system assembles a curated 'event package' incorporating pre-event build-up, related commentary, and post-event analysis â€“ all presented as a seamless, continuous stream.

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Source Integration:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** System accepts feeds from multiple sources: live video streams (as in the base patent), social media feeds (Twitter, Reddit, etc.), news articles, pre-recorded highlight reels, expert commentary clips, and archival footage.
*   **Metadata Tagging:** All ingested content is tagged with comprehensive metadata: event type, related entities (players, teams, locations), sentiment analysis scores, relevance scores, and time-based anchors.

**2. Event Contextualization Engine:**

*   **Event Timeline Generation:** Upon detecting an event (using methods outlined in the original patent), the engine constructs a dynamic timeline. This timeline extends *before* and *after* the detected event.
*   **Content Selection Algorithm:** This algorithm prioritizes content based on:
    *   **Temporal Proximity:** Content closest in time to the event is favored.
    *   **Relevance Score:** Content with higher relevance to the event (derived from metadata) is prioritized.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Algorithm considers the emotional tone of the content. (e.g., build excitement *before* the event, provide objective analysis *after*).
    *   **User Preference:** Leverages user history (viewing patterns, expressed interests) to personalize content selection.

**3. Dynamic Stitching Module:**

*   **Seamless Transitioning:** This module performs real-time video editing to create smooth transitions between different content segments. Techniques include:
    *   **Crossfades:** Gradual blending between segments.
    *   **Jump Cuts:** Abrupt transitions for fast-paced editing.
    *   **Wipes & Dissolves:** Creative visual effects.
    *   **Audio Leveling:** Ensures consistent audio volume across segments.
*   **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:** Adjusts video quality based on network conditions to prevent buffering.
*   **Real-time Rendering:** Handles complex video editing and rendering on the fly.

**4. User Interface & Control:**

*   **Unified Playback:** Presents the assembled content as a single, continuous stream within the existing player interface.
*   **Timeline Navigation:** Allows users to jump to specific points within the assembled timeline (e.g., pre-event build-up, event highlight, post-event analysis).
*   **Personalization Controls:** Enables users to customize the content mix (e.g., prioritize expert commentary, filter out certain types of content).
*   **Interactive Elements:** Integrates interactive features like polls, quizzes, and social media feeds within the assembled stream.

**Pseudocode (Content Selection Algorithm):**

```
function selectContent(event, timelineStart, timelineEnd, userPreferences):
  contentPool = getAllRelevantContent(event) // retrieves content from all sources
  filteredContent = filterContent(contentPool, timelineStart, timelineEnd) //remove content outside timeline

  scoredContent = []
  for each contentItem in filteredContent:
    score = 0
    score += contentItem.relevanceScore * 0.5
    score += calculateTemporalProximityScore(contentItem, event) * 0.3
    score += calculateSentimentAlignmentScore(contentItem, event) * 0.1
    score += calculateUserPreferenceScore(contentItem, userPreferences) * 0.1
    scoredContent.append((contentItem, score))

  sortedContent = sortByScore(scoredContent) // descending order

  selectedContent = takeTopN(sortedContent, 10) //select top 10 items

  return selectedContent
```

**Expansion Notes:**

*   Integration with existing content recommendation systems.
*   AI-powered content summarization for quicker context delivery.
*   Dynamic advertisement insertion based on event context and user preferences.
*   Support for multiple languages and regional content variations.
