## Haptic Sound Field Generator

**Core Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback with multi-directional audio output to create a perceived "sound field" where sound isn't just *heard*, but *felt* in specific locations around the user. This aims to enhance immersion, provide directional cues beyond standard stereo, and offer accessibility options for users with hearing impairments.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing:** Spherical or toroidal enclosure (approximately 30cm diameter). Constructed from a vibration-dampening material with a rigid outer shell.
*   **Speaker Array:** 9+ micro-speakers arranged in a hemispherical pattern within the housing. Each speaker connected to a dedicated amplifier channel. Frequency response 20Hz-20kHz.
*   **Haptic Array:** 36+ micro-actuators (piezoelectric or voice coil) arranged in a pattern mirroring the speaker array, embedded within the housing’s outer shell. Actuator frequency response 10Hz-1000Hz. Each actuator individually addressable.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded System-on-Chip (SoC) with dedicated audio and haptic signal processing capabilities. Minimum: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): 6-axis (accelerometer, gyroscope) for head/body tracking.
    *   Proximity Sensors: Detect user head position relative to the device.
    *   Optional: Microphone array for environmental noise cancellation and user voice commands.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 6, USB-C (power/data).
*   **Power:** Rechargeable Lithium-ion battery (minimum 8 hours playback).

**Functionality:**

1.  **Spatial Audio Rendering:** Utilize Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) and beamforming algorithms to render audio sources in 3D space. This will drive both the speaker array and haptic array.
2.  **Haptic Mapping:**  For each audio source, map specific frequencies or characteristics to corresponding haptic actuators.
    *   Low frequencies (bass) – Larger, more diffuse haptic response across multiple actuators.
    *   High frequencies (treble) – Localized, sharper haptic response from individual actuators.
    *   Directional Audio – Haptic actuators aligned with the perceived direction of the sound source activate.
3.  **Dynamic Haptic Adjustment:** Based on head tracking data (IMU), dynamically adjust the intensity and position of haptic feedback to maintain a consistent perceived sound field, even as the user moves their head.
4.  **Haptic Profiles:** Allow users to customize haptic intensity, frequency mapping, and overall experience.
5.  **Accessibility Mode:** For users with hearing impairments, convert audio signals entirely into haptic feedback, providing a tactile representation of the soundscape.
6.  **Procedural Generation:** Use algorithms to generate haptic effects for events like explosions, impacts, and environmental sounds.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Adjustment Loop):**

```
LOOP:

    // Get Head Tracking Data (IMU)
    head_orientation = get_head_orientation();

    // Get Audio Source Positions
    audio_sources = get_audio_source_positions();

    // For each audio source:
    FOR EACH audio_source IN audio_sources:

        // Calculate virtual position of audio source based on head orientation
        virtual_position = calculate_virtual_position(audio_source, head_orientation);

        // Calculate actuator activation based on virtual position
        actuator_activation = calculate_actuator_activation(virtual_position);

        // Set actuator intensity
        set_actuator_intensity(actuator_activation);

    END FOR

    // Delay (e.g., 10ms)
    delay(10);

END LOOP
```
