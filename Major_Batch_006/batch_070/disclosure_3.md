## Dynamic Auction Item "Bundling" & Predictive Bidding

**Concept:** Expand remote auction participation beyond individual lots by introducing dynamic item bundling, coupled with a predictive bidding system leveraging real-time auction data and bidder profiles. This moves beyond simply *accessing* the auction to *actively shaping* it.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Components (Additions to existing system):**

*   **Bundle Creation Module (BCM):**  Resides on the Auction Server. Allows the human proxy (or, potentially, an AI assistant) to create bundles of lots.  Bundling can be initiated manually, or triggered automatically based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., lots with no bids after X minutes, lots from the same consignor, lots of similar type).
*   **Bidder Profile Database (BPDB):** Stores historical bidding data, stated preferences (if provided), and inferred interests for each remote bidder.
*   **Predictive Bidding Engine (PBE):**  A machine learning model integrated with the Auction Server. Analyzes BPDB data, current auction state, and lot characteristics to predict optimal bid amounts for remote bidders, *especially* for bundled lots.
*   **Bundle Display Module (BDM):** A client-side module within the remote bidder's program. Displays available bundles, estimated total value (based on recent bids for component lots), and PBE-suggested bid amounts.
*   **Automated Bid Adjustment Module (ABAM):**  Client side. Allows users to set parameters for automated bid increases when competing for a bundle.

**II. Data Structures:**

*   **Bundle Object:**
    *   `bundleID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `lotIDs`: Array of lot identifiers included in the bundle.
    *   `creationTimestamp`: Time of bundle creation.
    *   `currentHighBid`: Current highest bid for the bundle.
    *   `bidders`: List of bidders who have placed bids on the bundle.
*   **Bidder Profile Object:**
    *   `bidderID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `preferredCategories`: Array of lot categories.
    *   `biddingHistory`: List of bids placed in past auctions.
    *   `maximumSpendLimit`: Optional user-defined limit.
    *   `riskTolerance`: Preference for winning quickly vs. getting the best price.

**III. Pseudocode (ABAM - Automated Bid Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION AutoBidForBundle(bundleID, maxBid, incrementAmount, aggressionLevel)

  // aggressionLevel: 1 (conservative) - 5 (aggressive)

  WHILE (currentHighestBid < maxBid) AND (Auction is still active)

    IF (currentHighestBid > 0)
      bidAmount = currentHighestBid + incrementAmount * aggressionLevel
    ELSE
      bidAmount = incrementAmount * aggressionLevel

    IF (bidAmount > maxBid)
      bidAmount = maxBid

    SUBMIT_BID(bundleID, bidAmount)

    WAIT(X seconds - adjustable based on auction pace)

    currentHighestBid = GET_HIGHEST_BID(bundleID)

  ENDWHILE
ENDFUNCTION
```

**IV. Workflow:**

1.  **Bundle Creation:** Human proxy identifies lots suitable for bundling.  BCM creates a Bundle Object and links it to the constituent lot objects.
2.  **Bundle Display:** BDM displays the bundle to remote bidders, highlighting its potential value.
3.  **Predictive Bidding:** PBE analyzes the bidder’s profile and the bundle’s characteristics to suggest an optimal opening bid.
4.  **Automated Bidding:** Remote bidder activates ABAM with defined parameters (max bid, increment, aggression).
5.  **Real-time Adjustment:** ABAM automatically adjusts bids based on the current auction state.
6.  **Dynamic Re-Bundling:**  If a lot within a bundle receives significant individual bids, the system can *dynamically* remove it from the bundle and offer it as a separate lot, creating new bundling opportunities.
