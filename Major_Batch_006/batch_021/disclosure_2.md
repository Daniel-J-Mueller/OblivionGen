## Adaptive Ambient Projection System

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond direct lighting control to project *adaptive ambient patterns* onto surfaces surrounding the user, correlated with lighting state and user activity. This isn't just about turning lights on and off, but about shaping the *feel* of a space using dynamic, projected visuals.

**Specs:**

*   **Projector Module:** Miniature, high-resolution pico-projector integrated into the remote control/hub. Capable of projecting onto surfaces within a 3-meter radius. Auto-keystone correction and focus.
*   **Surface Mapping:** Integrated depth sensor (ToF or similar) within the remote/hub to create a real-time map of the surrounding surfaces. This map is used to warp and blend projected visuals.
*   **Content Library:** Pre-loaded library of ambient patterns (flowing water, flickering fire, starry night, calming gradients, abstract forms). Ability to download/create custom patterns via app.
*   **Lighting Correlation Engine:** Algorithm that dynamically adjusts projected visuals based on the *current lighting state* (brightness, color, on/off). E.g., dimming lights activates a "cozy fireplace" projection; bright lights initiate a "clear sky" projection.
*   **Activity Detection Integration:** Integrate with smart home sensors (motion, audio, wearable data) to adapt projections based on *user activity*. E.g., motion detected in the kitchen activates a "cooking ambiance" projection (warm colors, subtle movement); audio analysis (music genre) triggers relevant visual patterns.
*   **Remote Control Integration:**  All control via the existing remote. Dedicated button/gesture for cycling through projection presets. Fine-grained control via app.
*   **Power:**  USB-C powered, or integrated rechargeable battery.
*   **Communication:** WiFi/Bluetooth for content updates, sensor integration, and remote control functionality.

**Pseudocode (Lighting Correlation Engine):**

```
function adjustProjection(lightingState, activityState):
  if lightingState.brightness < 20%:
    projectionPreset = "CozyFireplace"
  elif lightingState.colorTemperature == "WarmWhite":
    projectionPreset = "GentleSunset"
  elif lightingState.brightness > 80%:
    projectionPreset = "ClearSky"
  else:
    projectionPreset = "CalmingGradient"

  if activityState == "Cooking":
    projectionPreset = "WarmSpice" //custom preset

  if activityState == "MusicPlaying" and musicGenre == "Chill":
    projectionPreset = "WaterFlow"

  applyProjectionPreset(projectionPreset)
```

**Further Refinements:**

*   **AI-Driven Pattern Generation:**  Allow users to describe desired ambience ("a peaceful forest at dusk") and have the system generate a unique projection pattern.
*   **Multi-Projector Support:**  Enable synchronization of multiple projector modules for larger spaces and more immersive experiences.
*   **Personalized Profiles:**  Save user preferences for lighting and projection patterns.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Sync haptic feedback on the remote with the projected visuals for an added layer of immersion.
