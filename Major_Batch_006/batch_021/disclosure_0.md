## Personalized Predictive Abandonment & Re-Engagement

**Concept:** Extend the impact analysis beyond simple purchase/subscription completion. Predict user abandonment *before* it happens, then dynamically tailor re-engagement offers based on predicted reasons, creating hyper-personalized interventions.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Standard purchase history (as in the base patent).
    *   Real-time user behavior tracking (page views, time spent on pages, mouse movements, scroll depth – aggregated and anonymized).
    *   Session data (device type, browser, location).
    *   Third-party data (demographics, interests – optional, with user consent).
*   **Abandonment Prediction Model:**
    *   Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to analyze sequential user behavior data.
    *   Training data: Labeled sessions (completed purchase/subscription vs. abandoned) with associated behavior sequences.
    *   Output: Probability score indicating the likelihood of abandonment within a defined timeframe (e.g., next 5 minutes).
*   **Reason Inference Engine:**
    *   Utilize a separate classification model (e.g., Random Forest) trained on behavioral features to infer likely abandonment reasons.
    *   Example reasons: Price sensitivity, feature dissatisfaction, technical difficulties, distraction, comparison shopping.
    *   Feature importance analysis to identify key behavioral indicators for each reason.
*   **Dynamic Offer Generation:**
    *   A rule-based system combined with a generative model (e.g., a variational autoencoder (VAE)).
    *   Rules: Map abandonment reasons to predefined offer templates (e.g., discount code, free shipping, extended trial).
    *   VAE: Fine-tune offer wording and presentation based on user profile and context to maximize engagement.
*   **Re-Engagement Delivery:**
    *   Multi-channel delivery (email, in-app notification, SMS).
    *   Real-time trigger based on abandonment probability exceeding a threshold.
    *   A/B testing of different offer variations to optimize performance.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Track user response to re-engagement offers (click-through rate, conversion rate).
    *   Use this data to retrain the prediction and reason inference models, improving accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION PredictAbandonment(user_session):
  behavior_sequence = ExtractBehaviorSequence(user_session)
  abandonment_probability = RNN.predict(behavior_sequence)
  IF abandonment_probability > threshold:
    abandonment_reason = ReasonInferenceEngine.inferReason(behavior_sequence)
    offer = DynamicOfferGenerator.generateOffer(abandonment_reason, user_profile)
    DeliverOffer(offer, user_session)
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION DynamicOfferGenerator.generateOffer(reason, profile):
  IF reason == "price_sensitivity":
    offer_template = "discount_code"
    discount_amount = CalculateDiscount(profile.price_sensitivity_level)
  ELSE IF reason == "feature_dissatisfaction":
    offer_template = "feature_highlight"
    highlighted_feature = FindRelevantFeature(profile.interests)
  ELSE:
    offer_template = "generic_promotion"
  ENDIF

  offer = ApplyTemplate(offer_template, offer_details)
  RETURN offer
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive recommendations based on *past* actions to *proactive* interventions based on *predicted* behavior. The combination of abandonment prediction, reason inference, and dynamic offer generation creates a more personalized and effective re-engagement strategy, exceeding the scope of simply reacting to completed or abandoned transactions. It also incorporates elements of behavioral psychology by attempting to address the *underlying reasons* for abandonment.
