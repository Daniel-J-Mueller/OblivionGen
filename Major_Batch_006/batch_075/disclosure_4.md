## Dynamic Narrative Weaving via Procedural Ecology

**Concept:** Extend the node-based task system to model a procedural ecology within the game world. Instead of tasks simply being available/unavailable based on completion, their *existence* and parameters are dynamically generated and altered based on simulated ecological factors and player actions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Ecosystem Core:**
    *   A system simulating basic ecological needs (resource availability, predator/prey dynamics, environmental factors like weather). This is the foundation.
    *   Each 'task node' represents a 'species' or 'ecological event'.
    *   Node parameters (difficulty, reward, required skills) are derived from the species' ecological niche and current environmental conditions.

2.  **Procedural Task Generation:**
    *   Algorithmically generates new task nodes (species/events) based on ecosystem needs and player interaction.
    *   Generation considers:
        *   Resource gaps (e.g., a shortage of a specific food source generates hunting/gathering tasks).
        *   Population imbalances (e.g., an overpopulation of predators creates bounty hunts).
        *   Environmental changes (e.g., a drought generates water-finding quests).
    *   Generated nodes are initially 'latent' – they exist within the simulation but aren’t immediately presented to the player.

3.  **Latent Node Activation & Presentation:**
    *   Nodes become 'active' and visible to the player based on:
        *   Proximity to the player.
        *   Player skill set (a node requiring high stealth only appears to players with sufficient skill).
        *   Player actions (destroying a predator's den might generate a retaliatory quest).
    *   A 'reputation' system tracks player actions towards specific species/ecological elements.  Positive reputation leads to cooperative quests, negative to hostile ones.

4.  **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment:**
    *   Node parameters are *continuously* adjusted based on:
        *   Resource availability (a rare resource increases reward, making the task more challenging).
        *   Population levels (a dwindling species lowers difficulty, but also lowers reward).
        *   Player performance (consistent success reduces difficulty, failure increases it).
        *   Environmental conditions (a storm increases difficulty of outdoor tasks).

5.  **Node Relationships & Interdependence:**
    *   Nodes are interconnected, forming a complex web of dependencies.
    *   Completing one task can directly impact others. (e.g., eliminating a disease outbreak increases the population of a key resource species).
    *   Algorithmically generates 'ecological cascades' – completing a task triggers a series of related events.

**Pseudocode (Node Update Loop):**

```
FOR EACH node IN ecosystem:
  // Update resource needs
  node.resource_need = calculate_resource_need(node.species, ecosystem_state)

  // Update population based on resources & predation
  node.population = calculate_population(node.population, node.resource_need, predation_rate)

  // Adjust difficulty & reward
  node.difficulty = calculate_difficulty(node.population, node.resource_need)
  node.reward = calculate_reward(node.difficulty, node.rarity)

  // Check if node should become active
  IF node.is_latent AND player_nearby(node.location) AND player_skill_matches(node.required_skill):
    node.activate()

  // Check for cascading events
  IF node.completed AND has_dependencies(node):
    FOR EACH dependency IN node.dependencies:
      dependency.trigger_event()
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Utilize a graph-based data structure to represent node relationships.
*   Employ procedural generation techniques (e.g., L-systems, noise functions) to create dynamic environmental variations.
*   Focus on creating believable ecological interactions, even if they are simplified.
*   The system should be highly modular and configurable, allowing designers to easily adjust parameters and create new ecological scenarios.
