## Adaptive Contextual Filtering for ASR Hypothesis Selection

**Concept:** Extend the disambiguation process beyond comparing command *results* to comparing *contextual embeddings* of the hypotheses and the ongoing user interaction. This allows for a more nuanced and proactive filtering of hypotheses *before* full command execution, even for ambiguous requests.

**Specs:**

1.  **Contextual Embedding Generation:**
    *   Maintain a rolling buffer of recent user utterances and system responses (at least 5 turns).
    *   Encode this buffer into a contextual embedding vector using a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, Transformer).
    *   Encode each ASR hypothesis into a separate embedding vector using the same language model.

2.  **Hypothesis Scoring & Filtering:**
    *   Calculate the cosine similarity between each hypothesis embedding and the contextual embedding.
    *   Establish a dynamic similarity threshold. This threshold adjusts based on:
        *   The confidence score of each hypothesis (higher confidence -> higher threshold).
        *   The variance of similarity scores across all hypotheses (higher variance -> lower threshold).
    *   Filter out hypotheses with similarity scores below the dynamic threshold *before* sending them for command execution. This pre-emptive filtering reduces computational load and improves response time.

3.  **Refined Disambiguation:**
    *   For remaining hypotheses, execute commands and compare results as in the original patent.
    *   However, also include the contextual similarity score as a feature in the final disambiguation decision. This favors hypotheses that align better with the ongoing conversation.

4.  **Active Learning & Model Refinement:**
    *   Log user selections (or corrections) of disambiguated hypotheses.
    *   Use this data to fine-tune the language model used for embedding generation. This improves the accuracy of contextual similarity scores over time.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function process_asr_results(audio_data):
  hypotheses = perform_asr(audio_data)
  context_embedding = generate_context_embedding(user_history)

  filtered_hypotheses = []
  for hypothesis in hypotheses:
    hypothesis_embedding = generate_hypothesis_embedding(hypothesis)
    similarity = cosine_similarity(context_embedding, hypothesis_embedding)
    dynamic_threshold = calculate_dynamic_threshold(hypothesis.confidence)
    if similarity > dynamic_threshold:
      filtered_hypotheses.append(hypothesis)

  if len(filtered_hypotheses) == 0:
    // No hypotheses passed the filter. Re-evaluate with lower threshold
    filtered_hypotheses = hypotheses

  command_results = []
  for hypothesis in filtered_hypotheses:
    command_results.append(execute_command(hypothesis))

  disambiguated_hypothesis = select_best_hypothesis(command_results, filtered_hypotheses, contextual_similarity)

  return disambiguated_hypothesis
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires a GPU for efficient embedding generation.
*   Pre-trained language model needs to be loaded into memory.
*   Requires a mechanism for storing and accessing user history.
*   Integration with existing ASR and command execution pipelines.
