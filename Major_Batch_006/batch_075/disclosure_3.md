## Adaptive Network Persona System

**Concept:** Dynamically construct and apply 'network personas' to devices based on observed behavior and predicted needs, going beyond simple configuration and towards a self-modifying network infrastructure. This builds on the concept of pausing/testing changes, but expands it to constant, nuanced adaptation.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition:** A persona is a collection of configuration parameters, QoS settings, security policies, and even script execution profiles. Each parameter has an associated confidence level and a 'drift' factor.
*   **Behavioral Monitoring Agent (BMA):**  Each network device (or a representative sample) runs a BMA. The BMA passively monitors network traffic patterns (bandwidth usage, protocol distribution, destination addresses, application signatures) and device resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage I/O).  Data is timestamped and aggregated.
*   **Persona Database (PDB):** A centralized database storing a library of pre-defined personas (e.g., 'Streaming Media Client', 'Remote Worker', 'IoT Sensor', 'Critical Server'). Each persona has default values for all configurable parameters.
*   **Persona Inference Engine (PIE):**  The core component. The PIE receives behavioral data from the BMAs. It uses machine learning (clustering, anomaly detection, predictive modeling) to infer the 'current persona' of each device.  The PIE dynamically updates the confidence levels associated with each parameter in the inferred persona.
*   **Adaptive Configuration Manager (ACM):** The ACM receives the inferred persona from the PIE. It compares the current device configuration with the ideal configuration defined by the persona. It then automatically adjusts the device configuration.
*   **Drift Compensation:**  The 'drift' factor allows the system to gradually adapt to evolving behavior. If a device's observed behavior consistently deviates from its assigned persona, the drift factor increases, prompting the PIE to re-evaluate the deviceâ€™s persona.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**  Configuration changes are staged and logged. If a change causes a negative impact (detected by network monitoring or user reports), the ACM automatically rolls back to the previous configuration.
*   **A/B Testing of Personas:** The system can selectively assign different personas to similar devices to test the effectiveness of different configurations.

**Pseudocode (PIE - Persona Inference):**

```
function inferPersona(behavioralData):
  // 1. Feature Extraction:  Extract relevant features from behavioralData
  features = extractFeatures(behavioralData)

  // 2. Persona Matching: Compare features to known personas in PDB
  personaScores = calculatePersonaScores(features, personasInPDB)

  // 3. Confidence Calculation:  Adjust scores based on historical data and device consistency
  confidenceScores = calculateConfidenceScores(personaScores, historicalData)

  // 4. Persona Selection:  Select the persona with the highest confidence score
  selectedPersona = selectPersona(confidenceScores)

  // 5. Update Confidence Levels: Adjust parameter confidence levels within the selected persona 
  //    based on observed deviations
  updatedPersona = updateParameterConfidence(selectedPersona, observedDeviations)

  return updatedPersona
```

**Innovation/Novelty:**

The patent focuses on testing *specific* changes. This system is about *continuous* adaptation based on observed behavior, moving beyond configuration to something closer to a self-learning network. It's a paradigm shift from 'configure once' to 'adapt continuously'. The drift factor and persona confidence levels allow for a nuanced approach to adaptation, avoiding overly aggressive or disruptive changes.
