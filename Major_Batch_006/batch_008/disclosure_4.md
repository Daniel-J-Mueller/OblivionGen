**Adaptive Environmental Mapping with Dynamic Fiducial Placement**

**Concept:** Extend the fiducial-based calibration system to actively *manage* fiducial placement within the environment, rather than relying on pre-existing or passively observed targets. This allows for calibration in dynamic, unstructured environments and improves robustness against occlusion or target damage.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Fiducial Projection Unit:** A micro-projector (or array of projectors) mounted on the camera/device being calibrated. This unit is capable of projecting visible (or IR) fiducial markers onto surfaces within the cameraâ€™s field of view. Projection pattern should be controllable via software.
2.  **Environmental Scanning Module:**  Utilize a depth sensor (e.g., Time-of-Flight, Stereo Vision) integrated with the camera to create a real-time 3D map of the environment.
3.  **Fiducial Placement Algorithm:**  Software module responsible for:
    *   Analyzing the 3D environmental map.
    *   Identifying optimal surfaces for fiducial projection (based on surface normal, texture, distance, and predicted occlusion).
    *   Calculating projection parameters to place fiducial markers at strategically determined locations.
    *   Prioritizing marker placement to maximize coverage and minimize redundancy.
4.  **Calibration Module (Modified):**  The existing calibration module is updated to:
    *   Detect *projected* fiducial markers in addition to (or instead of) pre-existing targets.
    *   Account for the projection geometry when calculating calibration parameters.
    *   Implement a feedback loop:  If marker detection is unreliable (e.g., due to poor lighting or surface reflectivity), the Fiducial Placement Algorithm adjusts marker positions or projection intensity.
5.  **Dynamic Re-Calibration:** Continuous monitoring of calibration accuracy. When accuracy drops below a threshold, the system automatically initiates a re-calibration sequence by dynamically re-projecting and detecting fiducial markers.

**Pseudocode (Fiducial Placement Algorithm):**

```
function placeFiducials(environmentMap, numFiducials):
  fiducialLocations = []
  
  for i in range(numFiducials):
    bestLocation = null
    bestScore = -infinity
    
    for surface in environmentMap.surfaces:
      score = calculateSurfaceScore(surface) // Based on surface normal, texture, distance, occlusion potential
      
      if score > bestScore:
        bestScore = score
        bestLocation = surface
        
    if bestLocation != null:
      fiducialLocations.append(bestLocation)
      environmentMap.markSurfaceAsOccupied(bestLocation)  //Prevent overlapping markers
  
  return fiducialLocations

function calculateSurfaceScore(surface):
  score = 0
  score += surface.normal.dot(camera.direction) * weight_normal
  score += 1.0 / surface.distance * weight_distance // Prioritize closer surfaces
  score -= surface.occlusionPotential * weight_occlusion // Penalize surfaces likely to be obscured
  score += surface.textureComplexity * weight_texture // Favor surfaces with good contrast
  return score
```

**Expected Benefits:**

*   **Robustness:**  Calibration is less sensitive to the presence or absence of specific targets in the environment.
*   **Flexibility:**  Enables calibration in unstructured and dynamic environments.
*   **Accuracy:**  Optimized marker placement can improve calibration accuracy.
*   **Automation:**  Fully automated calibration process, requiring no manual target placement.
