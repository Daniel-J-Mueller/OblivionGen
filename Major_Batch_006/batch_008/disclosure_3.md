## Dynamic Proactive Support Routing & Anticipatory Data Prefetch

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Support Engine (PSE) - A real-time analytical module integrated with existing communication infrastructure (call centers, chat platforms, etc.).
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Communication Request Data: Source identifier (phone number, email, account ID), request type (support, sales, billing), initial request keywords (from IVR or chat input).
    *   Customer Data Platform (CDP): Comprehensive customer profiles including purchase history, product usage data (telemetry), known issues, support interaction history, and demographic data.
    *   Real-time System Health Monitoring: Data from internal systems (servers, applications) indicating potential outages or known bugs impacting users.
    *   Social Media Sentiment Analysis: Public social media data related to the product/service to detect emerging issues.
*   **Machine Learning Models:**
    *   *Issue Prediction Model:* Trained on historical support data to predict the *most likely* issue a user is experiencing *before* they explicitly state it. Model outputs a probability distribution over potential issues.
    *   *Agent Skill Matching Model:* Maps user issues to agent skillsets (product expertise, language proficiency, problem resolution style).
    *   *Data Prefetch Model:* Predicts what customer data will be *needed* by the agent to resolve the issue.
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  Communication request received. Source identifier is captured.
    2.  PSE analyzes source identifier and associated CDP data.
    3.  *Issue Prediction Model* predicts potential issues.
    4.  *Agent Skill Matching Model* identifies optimal agents.
    5.  *Data Prefetch Model* proactively retrieves relevant data (account details, purchase history, recent activity) and prepares it for agent display.
    6.  Communication request routed to the best available agent.
    7.  Agent receives pre-fetched data alongside the communication request, reducing resolution time and improving customer satisfaction.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function handle_communication_request(request):
  source_identifier = request.source_identifier
  cdp_data = get_cdp_data(source_identifier)

  issue_predictions = predict_issue(cdp_data) // ML model output: {issue_1: 0.7, issue_2: 0.2, ...}
  best_agent = find_best_agent(issue_predictions)

  prefetch_data = predict_data_needed(issue_predictions, cdp_data) //ML model output: list of data fields
  agent_data = get_data_for_fields(prefetch_data)

  route_request_to_agent(request, best_agent, agent_data)
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simply identifying a user; it *predicts* their needs *before* they articulate them, enabling proactive support and dramatically reducing resolution times. The dynamic data prefetching minimizes agent wait time and maximizes first-call resolution. It builds upon the identification component of the original patent to create a significantly more efficient and customer-centric support experience.
