**Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping & Personalization System**

**Concept:** A head-mounted wearable device incorporating an array of miniature, directional microphones coupled with a real-time acoustic environment mapping (AEM) system, and personalized audio processing. The goal is to create a highly localized and adaptive audio experience, far beyond simple noise cancellation or directional audio.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:**
    *   Minimum 12 miniature (3-5mm diameter) directional microphones.
    *   Placement: Distributed across the HMWD frame – front bridge (2), hinges (2), temples (4), and rear head strap (4). Precise spatial arrangement is critical.
    *   Each microphone is individually controllable for gain, directionality, and filtering.
    *   Each microphone has an associated MEMS accelerometer to track micro-vibrations and refine sound source localization.
*   **Acoustic Environment Mapping (AEM) Unit:**
    *   Dedicated low-power DSP or FPGA.
    *   Algorithm: Beamforming, sound source localization (Time Difference of Arrival - TDoA, and Amplitude Difference of Arrival - ADOA), and acoustic scene classification (e.g., “office,” “street,” “concert”).
    *   Output: A 3D volumetric map of the acoustic environment, updated in real-time (minimum 30Hz).  The map identifies sound sources, their intensity, direction, and frequency content.
*   **Personalized Audio Processing Unit:**
    *   AI/ML Core (Neural Engine or equivalent).
    *   User Profile: Stores individual hearing characteristics (audiogram), preferred audio profiles (EQ settings, noise cancellation levels), and contextual preferences (e.g., prioritize speech in meetings, minimize distractions while coding).
    *   Adaptive Filtering: Applies dynamic filtering to incoming audio based on AEM data and user profile. This includes:
        *   Selective Noise Cancellation: Targets specific noise sources while preserving desired sounds.
        *   Spatial Audio Enhancement: Creates a localized soundscape that enhances the perception of sound direction and distance.
        *   Speech Enhancement: Filters and amplifies speech signals for improved clarity.
    *   Contextual Awareness: Integrates data from other sensors (e.g., IMU, GPS, camera) to refine audio processing based on user activity and environment.
*   **Audio Output:**
    *   Bone conduction speakers (as per the patent) for clear audio transmission without obstructing ambient sound.
    *   Optional: Miniature in-ear transducers for enhanced immersion.
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Low-power design to maximize battery life.
    *   Adaptive power scaling based on processing load and sensor activity.

**Pseudocode (AEM Algorithm):**

```
// Initialize microphone array and calibration data
initializeMicrophones()
calibrateMicrophones()

// Main loop
while (true) {
    // Acquire audio data from all microphones
    audioData = acquireAudioData()

    // Perform beamforming to identify potential sound sources
    soundSources = performBeamforming(audioData)

    // Calculate Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Amplitude Difference of Arrival (ADOA) for each sound source
    tdoa = calculateTDoA(soundSources)
    adoa = calculateADOA(soundSources)

    // Estimate the 3D location of each sound source using TDoA and ADOA
    sourceLocations = estimateSourceLocations(tdoa, adoa)

    // Classify the acoustic environment based on detected sound sources
    environmentClass = classifyEnvironment(sourceLocations)

    // Update the 3D acoustic environment map
    updateAEM(sourceLocations, environmentClass)

    // Pass the AEM data to the personalized audio processing unit
    passAEMtoPAP(AEM)
}
```

**Innovation & Refinement:** The AEM data isn’t just used for noise cancellation. It’s about *reconstructing* the audio environment and actively shaping it to the user’s preferences.  Imagine being able to ‘dial down’ the sound of traffic while enhancing the voice of the person you’re talking to, or creating a ‘bubble’ of silence around you in a crowded space.  The system could also learn and adapt to the user’s environment over time, automatically optimizing audio processing based on their habits and preferences. The integration of contextual awareness (e.g. recognising a meeting via calendar and adjusting noise cancellation accordingly) is also key.
