## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Multi-Modal Temporal Fusion

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

The system aims to reconstruct a 3D acoustic scene from a distributed array of microphones, coupled with synchronized visual data (e.g., from onboard cameras or networked video feeds). This isn't just about source localization; it's about building a dynamic, layered representation of the environment's sonic characteristics.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of 8, optimally 16+ omnidirectional microphones with known spatial arrangement. High SNR, low self-noise is crucial.
*   **Visual Sensors:** Synchronized cameras (RGB or depth) with overlapping fields of view. Frame rate should match or exceed the sampling rate of the audio.
*   **Edge Processing Units:** Each microphone/camera pair has an embedded processor capable of pre-processing audio (beamforming, noise reduction) and visual data (feature extraction).
*   **Central Processing Unit:** High-performance server responsible for data fusion, scene reconstruction, and rendering.
*   **Optional IMU:** Inertial Measurement Units on each node to improve spatial calibration and compensate for movement.

**III. Software Modules:**

1.  **Pre-Processing:**
    *   **Audio:** Adaptive beamforming (MVDR, MUSIC) to enhance target signals. Noise reduction using spectral subtraction or deep learning models.
    *   **Visual:** Object detection (YOLO, SSD) to identify sound-emitting objects. Semantic segmentation to categorize environment surfaces (e.g., walls, floors, furniture). Optical flow estimation for dynamic scene elements.
2.  **Temporal Alignment & Synchronization:**
    *   Utilize timestamps and network protocols (PTP, NTP) to synchronize audio and visual data streams. Kalman filtering or particle filtering to refine temporal alignment.
3.  **Acoustic Mapping:**
    *   Implement a spherical harmonic (SH) based acoustic map to represent the sound field. SH coefficients are updated in real-time based on microphone signals.
    *   Utilize Ray Tracing to model sound propagation, reflections, and diffraction based on scene geometry derived from visual data.
4.  **Multi-Modal Fusion:**
    *   **Early Fusion:** Concatenate audio and visual features at the pre-processing stage. Train a deep neural network to learn correlations between modalities.
    *   **Late Fusion:**  Independently process audio and visual data, then combine the results using weighted averaging or decision-level fusion.
    *   **Dynamic Fusion:** Adaptively adjust the weighting of audio and visual data based on signal quality and context.  Use a Bayesian network to model uncertainty and dependencies.
5.  **Scene Reconstruction & Rendering:**
    *   Generate a 3D point cloud of sound sources based on acoustic mapping and object detection.
    *   Visualize the reconstructed scene using a 3D rendering engine.  Display sound source locations, intensity levels, and propagation paths.
    *   Implement Augmented Reality (AR) overlays to visualize the reconstructed scene on a real-world view.

**IV. Pseudocode - Dynamic Fusion Module**

```pseudocode
// Inputs:
//   audio_features: Feature vector extracted from audio data
//   visual_features: Feature vector extracted from visual data
//   audio_quality: Metric representing the quality of audio signal
//   visual_quality: Metric representing the quality of visual signal
//   context: Information about the environment (e.g., room type, activity)

function dynamic_fusion(audio_features, visual_features, audio_quality, visual_quality, context)

    // Calculate weights based on signal quality and context
    weight_audio =  audio_quality * context_weight_audio
    weight_visual = visual_quality * context_weight_visual

    // Normalize weights
    total_weight = weight_audio + weight_visual
    weight_audio = weight_audio / total_weight
    weight_visual = weight_visual / total_weight

    // Weighted fusion
    fused_features = weight_audio * audio_features + weight_visual * visual_features

    return fused_features
end function
```

**V. Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Teleconferencing:**  Spatial audio rendering for realistic remote meetings.
*   **Smart Security Systems:**  Accurate sound event detection and localization for intrusion detection.
*   **Robotics & Autonomous Navigation:**  Improved environmental perception for robots operating in complex environments.
*   **Virtual & Augmented Reality:**  Realistic soundscapes for immersive VR/AR experiences.
*   **Acoustic Scene Understanding:** Enabling machines to “understand” the sonic context of a given environment.
