## Adaptive Encoding Ladder for Personalized Holographic Streams

**Concept:** Extend the playback-conditions-adaptive encoding ladder to support *volumetric* video streams intended for holographic display. Instead of optimizing for 2D screen characteristics, the system dynamically adjusts encoding parameters to maximize perceived holographic quality based on viewer position, display characteristics (resolution, field of view), and computational resources available for holographic reconstruction.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Feature Extraction:**

1.  **Viewer Tracking:** Integrate real-time viewer position tracking (using cameras, depth sensors, or headset tracking) into the encoding pipeline. Capture x, y, z coordinates, gaze direction, and head/body pose.
2.  **Display Profiling:**  Define a display profile database. Profiles store display resolution (x, y, z dimensions for holographic volume), field of view (horizontal, vertical), refresh rate, and computational capacity (GPU/processing power).  Profiles are loaded automatically based on display identification.
3.  **Scene Analysis:**  Analyze input volumetric video scenes to identify key features: depth complexity (variance in depth values), texture complexity, motion vectors, and object density. 
4.  **Volumetric Region of Interest (ROI) Detection:** Implement algorithms to identify prominent ROIs within the volumetric scene, prioritizing encoding quality for these regions (e.g., faces, hands, main objects).

**II. Encoding Ladder Construction & Adaptation:**

1.  **Encoding Parameter Set Expansion:** Extend the existing encoding parameter set to include:
    *   *Volumetric Resolution Scaling:* Independent scaling of resolution along each axis (x, y, z).
    *   *View-Dependent Occlusion Culling:* Encoding parameters that prioritize encoding visible surfaces from a specific viewing frustum (derived from viewer position).
    *   *Point Cloud Simplification Level:* Controls the density of point clouds used for volumetric representation, balancing quality and bandwidth.
    *   *Light Field Sampling Density:* Parameters controlling the density of light rays sampled for light field encoding.
2.  **Cost Function Augmentation:** Modify the existing cost function to incorporate holographic quality metrics:
    *   *Perceived Depth Accuracy:* Quantifies the accuracy of depth reconstruction at the viewer's position.
    *   *Holographic Artifact Reduction:* Penalizes encoding parameters that cause noticeable artifacts in holographic reconstruction (e.g., ghosting, blurring).
    *   *Computational Cost of Reconstruction:* Considers the processing power required to reconstruct the holographic image.
3.  **Adaptive Ladder Generation:**
    *   The system uses viewer position, display profile, scene analysis, and the augmented cost function to generate a dynamic encoding ladder. 
    *   Each "rung" of the ladder represents a different set of encoding parameters.
    *   The ladder is optimized for the *specific* viewer, display, and scene.

**III. Streaming & Reconstruction:**

1.  **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:** The system selects the optimal rung of the encoding ladder based on available bandwidth and network conditions.
2.  **View-Dependent Encoding Delivery:** Encoding data is streamed with metadata indicating the viewer position it was optimized for.
3.  **Real-Time Holographic Reconstruction:** The holographic display uses the received encoding data and viewer position metadata to reconstruct the volumetric image in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Ladder Adaptation):**

```
function AdaptEncodingLadder(viewer_position, display_profile, scene_data, bandwidth):
  # Calculate Quality Target based on bandwidth and display characteristics
  quality_target = CalculateQualityTarget(bandwidth, display_profile)

  # Generate a set of encoding parameter profiles
  encoding_profiles = GenerateEncodingProfiles()

  # Evaluate each profile based on the augmented cost function
  for profile in encoding_profiles:
    cost = CalculateCost(profile, quality_target, viewer_position, scene_data)
    profile.cost = cost

  # Sort profiles by cost
  encoding_profiles.sort(key=lambda x: x.cost)

  # Select the best profile
  best_profile = encoding_profiles[0]

  return best_profile
```

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond optimizing for 2D displays and extends the concept of adaptive encoding to the realm of holographic streaming, taking into account viewer position, display characteristics, and volumetric scene complexity. This enables personalized holographic experiences with optimized quality and reduced bandwidth requirements. The integration of view-dependent encoding and volumetric scene analysis are key innovations.
