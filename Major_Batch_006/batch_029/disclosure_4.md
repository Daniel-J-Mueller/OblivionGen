## Adaptive Acoustic Beamforming with Personalized HRTF Compensation

**Concept:** Leverage the frequency offset detection from the provided patent to dynamically adjust acoustic beamforming weights *and* compensate for individual Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) in real-time. This creates a highly personalized and adaptive spatial audio experience, improving localization and immersion.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 4 microphones), high-speed processor, digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities, potentially integrated with a user profile database.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Frequency Offset Detector:**  Utilizes the core FFT-based frequency offset detection from the source patent. This provides a baseline for timing adjustments across channels.
    *   **HRTF Database:** Stores a library of HRTFs categorized by anthropometric data (head size, ear canal dimensions, etc.) or empirically measured responses. Includes a mechanism for user-specific HRTF learning.
    *   **Beamforming Engine:** Implements a delay-and-sum or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming algorithm. Critically, it incorporates the frequency offset *and* HRTF data into the weighting coefficients.
    *   **Real-Time Adjustment Loop:** Continuously monitors the frequency offset for each microphone channel. Adjusts both the beamforming weights *and* HRTF compensation filters based on detected deviations.
    *   **User Profiling & Learning:** Incorporates a system where the user can "teach" the system their preferred sound profile by adjusting a few key settings. The system can then learn and adapt to the user's preferences over time.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Weight Calculation):**

```
// Inputs:
//   micSignals[]: Array of signals from each microphone
//   referenceSignal:  The desired audio signal
//   frequencyOffset[]: Array of frequency offsets for each microphone channel
//   HRTF_filter[]:  HRTF compensation filter for each channel
//   numMics: Number of microphones

// Calculate time delay for each channel based on frequency offset and sample rate
for i in range(numMics):
    timeDelay[i] = frequencyOffset[i] / sampleRate

// Apply time delay to each microphone signal
delayedMicSignals[i] = delay(micSignals[i], timeDelay[i])

// Apply HRTF compensation filter
filteredMicSignals[i] = applyFilter(filteredMicSignals[i], HRTF_filter[i])

// Calculate beamforming weights (MVDR example)
covarianceMatrix = calculateCovarianceMatrix(filteredMicSignals)
steeringVector = calculateSteeringVector(desiredDirection)
beamformingWeights = solve(covarianceMatrix, steeringVector)

// Sum weighted microphone signals to form output
outputSignal = sum(beamformingWeights[i] * filteredMicSignals[i] for i in range(numMics))

return outputSignal
```

**Innovation Details:**

*   **Dynamic HRTF Adjustment:** Instead of static HRTF application, the system continuously adapts HRTF compensation based on real-time frequency offset analysis. This compensates for slight head movements or changes in the acoustic environment.
*   **Personalized Spatial Audio:** Users can "train" the system to learn their preferred soundstage and spatial characteristics.
*   **Robustness to Noise:** The beamforming engine filters out noise, enhancing the clarity and fidelity of the desired audio signal.
*   **Multi-User Support:** The system can potentially adapt to multiple users based on individual profiles.
*   **Application Scenarios:** VR/AR, gaming, teleconferencing, music listening, and accessibility for hearing impaired individuals.
