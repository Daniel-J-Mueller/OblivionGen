## Adaptive Request Sharding with Predictive Caching

**Concept:** Extend the caching determination process to actively *shard* incoming requests based on predicted cache hit ratios and dynamically route those shards to different caching tiers or even directly to origin servers. This goes beyond simple caching; it’s about proactively shaping traffic flow *before* hitting any cache.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Shard Profile Creation & Maintenance:**

*   **Data Source:**  Ingest historical request data (characteristics as defined in the patent: identifiers, user types, content type, time, location, etc.) alongside corresponding cache hit/miss data.  Supplement with real-time request stream data.
*   **Model Training:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees, Neural Network) to predict cache hit probability *per request characteristic combination*.  This creates a “Shard Profile” – a mapping of request characteristics to predicted cache hit ratios.  Retrain model continuously.
*   **Shard Definition:** Define “shards” as groups of requests with similar predicted cache hit ratios.  Shard granularity is configurable (e.g., coarse-grained based on user type/location, fine-grained based on specific content ID/user account).  Dynamic shard creation/merging based on evolving data.

**2. Request Interception & Sharding:**

*   **First Computing Device Functionality:** Upon receiving a request:
    *   Extract relevant request characteristics.
    *   Lookup predicted cache hit ratio from Shard Profile.
    *   Assign request to appropriate shard based on hit ratio.
    *   Append shard identifier to request header. (e.g., `X-Shard-ID: <shard_number>`).
    *   Route request to a 'Shard Router' component.

**3. Shard Router Component:**

*   **Configuration:** Define a hierarchy of caching tiers (e.g., CDN edge cache, regional cache, origin server).
*   **Routing Logic:**  Based on the `X-Shard-ID` and pre-defined policies:
    *   **High Hit Ratio Shards:** Route directly to CDN edge cache.
    *   **Medium Hit Ratio Shards:** Route to regional cache.
    *   **Low Hit Ratio Shards:** Bypass cache entirely, route directly to origin server.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Monitor cache hit/miss rates per shard in real-time.  Adjust routing policies dynamically to optimize cache utilization.

**4. Second Computing Device Modifications:**

*   The second computing device (origin server) remains largely unchanged.  It *may* optionally log shard ID alongside response data to allow for more granular analytics.

**Pseudocode (First Computing Device):**

```
function process_request(request):
  characteristics = extract_characteristics(request)
  hit_ratio = lookup_hit_ratio(characteristics)
  shard_id = determine_shard(hit_ratio)
  add_header(request, "X-Shard-ID", shard_id)
  route_to_shard_router(request)

function lookup_hit_ratio(characteristics):
  # Access ML model to predict hit ratio based on characteristics
  # Return predicted hit ratio (0.0 - 1.0)

function determine_shard(hit_ratio):
  if hit_ratio > 0.8:
    return 1  # High Hit Shard
  elif hit_ratio > 0.4:
    return 2  # Medium Hit Shard
  else:
    return 3  # Low Hit Shard
```

**Telemetry & Analytics:**

*   Track cache hit/miss rates per shard.
*   Monitor shard size/distribution.
*   Analyze the correlation between request characteristics and cache hit ratios.
*   Use this data to refine the ML model and routing policies.
