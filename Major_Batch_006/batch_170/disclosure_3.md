## Adaptive Predictive Search with Contextual Embeddings

**Concept:** Extend the pre-computed search result idea by incorporating real-time user context and semantic embeddings to *predict* likely search queries *before* the user finishes typing, and deliver increasingly refined results.  This moves beyond simple prefix matching to anticipate user intent.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw keystroke data, user location (optional, with consent), time of day, recent search history (with consent), application context (e.g., if searching from within a document editor, prioritize document-related results).
*   **Processing:**  Employ a rolling window (e.g., last 5-10 keystrokes) to capture the evolving query.  Normalize keystroke data to handle variations in typing speed/errors.
*   **Output:**  Context vector representing the user’s current search session.

**2. Embedding Generation Module:**

*   **Input:**  Current input string (even partial) *and* the context vector.
*   **Processing:**  Utilize a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, or a custom model trained on the search content database) to generate a semantic embedding of the input string, *conditioned* on the context vector. This yields a higher-dimensional representation capturing the *meaning* of the query, not just the literal characters.
*   **Output:**  Query embedding vector.

**3. Proactive Result Retrieval Module:**

*   **Input:**  Query embedding vector.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Maintain a database of pre-computed result sets, *indexed* by embedding vectors.  Instead of indexing by strings, index by the semantic representation of queries.  This requires a significant upfront computational cost, but allows for rapid retrieval.
    *   Perform a nearest neighbor search (e.g., using cosine similarity) in the embedding space to identify the *k* most similar pre-computed result sets.
    *   Rank the results based on embedding similarity *and* other factors (e.g., popularity, recency, user preferences).
*   **Output:**  Candidate result set.

**4. Adaptive Refinement Module:**

*   **Input:** Candidate result set, streaming keystroke data.
*   **Processing:**
    *   As the user continues typing, update the query embedding vector in real-time.
    *   Re-rank the candidate result set based on the updated embedding vector.  
    *   Implement a threshold for embedding similarity: if the similarity falls below the threshold, discard the result set and initiate a new search.
    *   Prioritize results that have remained consistently highly ranked across multiple keystrokes.
*   **Output:**  Dynamically refined result set.

**5.  Prediction & Display Module:**

*   **Input:**  Dynamically refined result set.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Display a list of predicted search queries (based on the user’s typing and search history) alongside the refined result set.
    *   Highlight the portions of the predicted queries that match the user’s current input.
    *   Allow the user to select a predicted query to instantly load the corresponding results.
*   **Output:**  Interactive search interface.



**Data Structures:**

*   **Embedding Index:**  A high-dimensional vector index (e.g., using FAISS, Annoy) that maps embedding vectors to pre-computed result sets.
*   **Result Set Cache:** A cache to store frequently accessed result sets to minimize retrieval latency.



**Pseudocode (Adaptive Refinement Module):**

```
function refineResults(candidateResults, newKeystroke):
  queryEmbedding = generateEmbedding(currentInput + newKeystroke, contextVector)
  updatedResults = []
  for result in candidateResults:
    similarity = cosineSimilarity(queryEmbedding, result.embedding)
    updatedResults.append((result, similarity))

  updatedResults.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  filteredResults = []
  for result, similarity in updatedResults:
    if similarity > similarityThreshold:
      filteredResults.append(result)
  return filteredResults
```
