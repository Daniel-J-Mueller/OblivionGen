## Dynamic Content 'Echoes' & Predictive Highlighting

**Concept:** Extend the personalized library concept by creating 'content echoes' – automatically generated, slightly altered versions of existing content – and pairing them with predictive highlighting based on user interaction patterns.

**Specs:**

**I. Echo Generation Module:**

*   **Trigger:** Activated upon user interaction with a content item (reading, highlighting, note-taking).
*   **Alteration Types:**
    *   **Summarization:** Generate shorter summaries (25%, 50%, 75% length) of the original content.
    *   **Expansion:** Utilize external data sources (knowledge graphs, APIs) to expand upon specific concepts within the content, adding related information.
    *   **Perspective Shift:** Re-write sections from a different perspective (e.g., from technical to layman's terms, or vice versa).
    *   **Format Change:**  Convert text-heavy sections into bullet points, tables, or diagrams.
*   **Echo Storage:** Store generated echoes linked to the original content item, tagged with the alteration type and triggering interaction.
*   **Echo Selection Algorithm:** Prioritize echo generation based on content type and user interaction history (e.g., technical articles might favor summarization, while news articles might favor perspective shifts).

**II. Predictive Highlighting Engine:**

*   **Interaction Tracking:** Continuously monitor user interactions within the personalized library:
    *   Reading speed
    *   Scrolling patterns
    *   Highlighting frequency and content
    *   Note-taking content
    *   Search queries within the library
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Employ machine learning models to identify patterns in user interactions.
*   **Highlight Prediction:** Based on identified patterns, predict which sections of a content item the user is most likely to highlight *before* they do so.
*   **Highlight Visualization:**
    *   Pre-highlight predicted sections with a subtle, semi-transparent color (adjustable by user preference).
    *   Increase highlight intensity as the user approaches the predicted section.
    *   Allow user override of predictive highlights.

**III. Dynamic Content Delivery System:**

*   **Content Variation:** Based on user interaction patterns, automatically serve content variations (original, echoes) to maximize engagement.
*   **Echo Rotation:** Rotate between original content and its echoes to provide fresh perspectives and prevent stagnation.
*   **Personalized Content Streams:** Create dynamically generated content streams tailored to individual user preferences and learning styles.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Integrate an A/B testing framework to continuously optimize echo generation and content delivery strategies.

**Pseudocode (Content Delivery):**

```
function deliverContent(userID, contentID):
  userProfile = getUserProfile(userID)
  contentVariations = getVariations(contentID) // Returns original + echoes
  
  if contentVariations is empty:
    return originalContent
  
  // Predict user preference for variation based on profile & history
  preferredVariation = predictVariationPreference(userProfile, contentVariations)
  
  // Serve preferred variation
  return preferredVariation
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   Integration with external knowledge sources (Wikipedia, Wolfram Alpha) to enhance echo generation.
*   Support for multi-modal content (images, videos, audio) – echoes can be generated for these formats as well (e.g., video summaries, image annotations).
*   Privacy considerations: ensure user data is anonymized and protected.
*   Scalability: the system should be able to handle a large number of users and content items.
