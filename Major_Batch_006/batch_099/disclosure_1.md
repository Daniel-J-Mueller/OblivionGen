## Temporal Key Shards & Distributed Entropy

**Concept:** Instead of a single encrypted key with a limited lifetime governed by a single expiring key, the durable cryptographic key is *sharded* into multiple parts, each encrypted with a different key possessing a staggered expiration. These keys and shards are distributed across a network – not necessarily a traditional centralized server, but potentially a peer-to-peer network or even leveraging blockchain-like principles for immutability and redundancy. This significantly increases resilience and makes complete key compromise far more difficult.

**Specs:**

**1. Key Sharding Module:**

*   **Input:** Original cryptographic key (`K`), desired durability duration (`D`), number of shards (`N`), entropy source.
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide `K` into `N` equal or near-equal shards (`K1`, `K2`, … `Kn`).
    *   For each shard `Ki`:
        *   Generate a random encryption key `Ei`.
        *   Encrypt `Ki` with `Ei`: `Ci = Encrypt(Ki, Ei)`.
        *   Generate an expiration timestamp `Ti` based on a staggered schedule (e.g., evenly distributed over `D`, or weighted based on shard importance).
        *   Encrypt `Ei` with a Key Management Service (KMS) key – this KMS key is *long-lived* but auditable.
        *   Store the encrypted shard (`Ci`), encrypted encryption key (`Encrypted(Ei)`), and expiration timestamp (`Ti`) as a “Key Fragment”.
*   **Output:** A list of Key Fragments.

**2. Fragment Distribution Network (FDN):**

*   **Architecture:** A distributed hash table (DHT) or blockchain-inspired network. Each node in the FDN stores a subset of the Key Fragments.
*   **Redundancy:** Each Key Fragment is replicated across multiple nodes (e.g., using erasure coding) to ensure availability even if nodes fail or become unavailable.
*   **Access Control:** Access to Key Fragments is governed by cryptographic access control mechanisms.  The original key owner (or authorized delegates) must provide a digital signature to retrieve the fragments.

**3. Key Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Input:** Access credentials, minimum required number of fragments (`R`), list of nodes in FDN.
*   **Process:**
    *   Request Key Fragments from nodes in FDN.
    *   Verify the authenticity and integrity of retrieved fragments.
    *   Check the expiration timestamps (`Ti`) of the fragments. Discard expired fragments.
    *   If enough valid fragments are available (at least `R`), decrypt the shard encryption keys (`Ei`) using the KMS key.
    *   Decrypt the shards (`Ki`) using the decrypted shard encryption keys.
    *   Reassemble the shards into the original key (`K`).
*   **Output:** The original cryptographic key (`K`) – or an error if sufficient valid fragments cannot be retrieved.

**4. KMS Integration:**

*   Long-lived KMS keys are used to encrypt the shard encryption keys, providing a secure way to manage and rotate encryption keys.
*   The KMS should provide audit logs of all key accesses and operations.
*   Access to the KMS should be strictly controlled and limited to authorized personnel.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction Module):**

```
function reconstructKey(accessCredentials, requiredFragments, networkNodes):
  fragments = []
  for node in networkNodes:
    fragment = node.requestFragment(accessCredentials)
    if fragment.isValid():
      if fragment.expirationTimestamp > currentTime:
        fragments.append(fragment)
      else:
        log("Fragment expired, discarding.")

  if length(fragments) >= requiredFragments:
    shardEncryptionKeys = []
    for fragment in fragments:
      encryptedKey = fragment.encryptedShardKey
      shardKey = decryptWithKMS(encryptedKey)
      shardEncryptionKeys.append(shardKey)

    shards = []
    for i in range(numShards):
      shard = decryptWithShardKey(shards[i], shardEncryptionKeys[i])
      shards.append(shard)

    key = assembleKey(shards)
    return key
  else:
    return error("Insufficient valid fragments")
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond the single-point-of-failure expiration of the original patent by introducing redundancy, distribution, and staggered expiration. It also incorporates aspects of modern decentralized technologies to enhance resilience and security.  The staggered expiration times make it significantly harder for an attacker to compromise the key, as they would need to compromise multiple fragments before the key is fully recoverable. The distribution also mitigates the risk of a single point of failure.
