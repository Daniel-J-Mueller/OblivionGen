## Automated Predictive Maintenance System with Haptic Feedback Integration

**System Overview:**

This system aims to extend the current skeletal tracking and event association with a proactive maintenance module for the materials handling equipment itself. The core concept is to identify subtle anomalies in worker motions *correlated* with equipment stress, predicting potential failures before they occur. It integrates haptic feedback into wearable devices to guide workers in preventative actions.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Existing System:** The multi-camera skeletal tracking system described in the patent.
*   **Load/Stress Sensors:** High-resolution strain gauges and accelerometers embedded within key components of the storage units and handling equipment (e.g., conveyor belts, robotic arms, shelving supports). Wireless communication to central processing.
*   **Wearable Haptic Devices:** Lightweight wristbands or gloves for workers, capable of delivering localized vibrations or pressure changes.
*   **Edge Computing Units:** Distributed processing units located near the cameras and sensors to reduce latency.
*   **Central Server:**  For data aggregation, model training, and system management.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Data Acquisition & Synchronization:**  The system captures skeletal tracking data from the cameras, load/stress sensor data, and worker location data in real-time. Data is time-synchronized across all sources.

2.  **Feature Extraction:**
    *   **Skeletal Features:** Calculate joint velocities, accelerations, postures, and trajectories for workers.  Focus on features indicative of strain or awkward movements â€“ sudden jerks, prolonged reaching, repetitive motions.
    *   **Load/Stress Features:** Monitor strain, vibration, and acceleration levels in equipment components.
    *   **Correlation Engine:** This module is the core of the innovation. It employs a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network or long short-term memory network) to learn the complex relationships between worker motions, equipment stress, and potential failures. 

3.  **Anomaly Detection & Prediction:**
    *   The trained model predicts expected equipment stress levels based on current worker motions.
    *   Significant deviations between predicted and actual stress levels trigger an anomaly alert.
    *   A time-series forecasting model predicts future equipment stress levels based on current trends and anomaly alerts.

4.  **Haptic Feedback Control:**
    *   Based on the predicted equipment stress and anomaly alerts, the system generates haptic feedback signals for the worker's wearable devices.
    *   Haptic signals provide guidance to the worker, such as:
        *   **Gentle vibration:** Indicating an area of potential stress on the equipment and suggesting a change in lifting technique or load distribution.
        *   **Directional vibration:** Guiding the worker to shift their weight or adjust their posture to relieve stress.
        *   **Varying intensity:** Reflecting the severity of the predicted stress.

5.  **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   The system continuously learns from new data and adjusts the machine learning models to improve accuracy and performance.
    *   Feedback from maintenance personnel is incorporated to refine the anomaly detection and prediction algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Logic):**

```
// Define stress thresholds for various equipment components
stressThresholdHigh = 100;
stressThresholdMedium = 75;

// Get current equipment stress levels (from sensors)
equipmentStress = getEquipmentStress();

// Get worker skeletal data (from cameras)
workerSkeleton = getWorkerSkeleton();

// Calculate predicted equipment stress based on worker movements
predictedStress = calculatePredictedStress(workerSkeleton);

// Check for anomalies
if (predictedStress > equipmentStress + stressThresholdMedium) {
  // Potential anomaly detected
  // Calculate optimal haptic feedback signal
  hapticSignal = calculateHapticSignal(workerSkeleton, equipmentStress);

  // Send haptic signal to worker's device
  sendHapticSignal(hapticSignal);
}

// Adaptive Learning:
// If maintenance confirms a failure, update the model with the new data.
// If a false positive occurs, adjust the thresholds.
```

**Novelty:**

This system differs from the base patent by moving beyond simple event association to *proactive* maintenance. It's not just identifying who interacted with what, but *anticipating* equipment failure based on subtle correlations between worker behavior and equipment stress. The integration of haptic feedback allows for real-time guidance, empowering workers to prevent failures before they occur. This shifts the focus from reactive repair to preventative maintenance, improving safety, reducing downtime, and extending the lifespan of the equipment.
