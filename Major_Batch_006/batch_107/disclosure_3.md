## Modular Display System with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** A product display system utilizing interlocking, geometrically variable modules capable of shifting configuration dynamically, coupled with localized haptic feedback to simulate texture and material properties.

**Specifications:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** Base unit: 10cm x 10cm x 2cm. Modules connect via magnetic interlocking edges, capable of 360-degree rotation and multi-axis articulation.
*   **Material:** Modules constructed from a lightweight, durable polymer with embedded micro-actuators. Exterior surface composed of a flexible, e-ink-like display capable of dynamic color and texture simulation.
*   **Actuation:** Each module contains an array of piezoelectric actuators. These actuators, controlled by a central processing unit, can create localized deformations on the moduleâ€™s surface, simulating the texture of the displayed product.
*   **Connectivity:** Modules communicate wirelessly with a central control unit via Bluetooth 5.0. The control unit receives product data (dimensions, material, texture) from a database or user input.
*   **Power:** Wireless power transfer via inductive charging. Each module contains a rechargeable solid-state battery.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Modules can be arranged in a virtually limitless number of configurations, ranging from flat surfaces to complex three-dimensional structures.
    *   Software control allows for pre-programmed configurations or real-time adjustments based on product requirements or user interaction.
    *   Automated re-configuration based on product input - imagine a shoe 'growing' from a flat array of modules.
*   **Haptic Feedback System:**
    *   Piezoelectric actuators generate localized vibrations and surface deformations to simulate texture, weight, and material properties.
    *   Haptic algorithms dynamically adjust vibration patterns based on the displayed product.
    *   User can "feel" the texture of a fabric, the smoothness of metal, or the roughness of wood.
*   **Software Interface:**
    *   User-friendly interface for designing and controlling module configurations.
    *   Product data import via API or manual input.
    *   Haptic feedback parameter customization.
    *   Remote control and monitoring capabilities.
*   **Pseudo-code (Module Control):**

```
FUNCTION updateModule(productData):
    texture = productData.texture
    color = productData.color
    shape = productData.shape
    
    SET displayColor(color)
    SET displayTexture(texture)
    
    IF shape == "complex":
        adjustModuleGeometry(shapeData) 
    ELSE:
        SET moduleShape(shape)
        
    SET hapticProfile(texture) //Apply haptic texture to the module
    
    END FUNCTION
```

*   **Possible Applications:** Retail displays, virtual showrooms, product prototyping, educational tools. 
* **Expansion:** Integrate scent diffusion with modules to allow for olfactory feedback.
