## Dynamic Knowledge Graph Augmentation for Cross-Lingual Document Retrieval

**Concept:** Expand the document summarization framework by creating a dynamic, cross-lingual knowledge graph that represents relationships *between* translated document segments, rather than simply assessing support *within* a single document.  This allows for a far more nuanced understanding of information flow and consensus across languages, providing a more robust summarization and retrieval system.

**Specs:**

**1. Knowledge Graph Construction:**

*   **Node Types:**
    *   `DocumentSegment`: Represents a translated segment of text (sentence, paragraph). Stores language, document ID, segment ID.
    *   `Concept`: Represents an extracted concept from a `DocumentSegment`. Uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Key Phrase Extraction.
    *   `Relationship`: Defines the relationship between `DocumentSegment` nodes or between `DocumentSegment` and `Concept` nodes.  Examples: "supports", "contradicts", "elaborates", "provides_evidence_for".  Relationship strength (confidence score) is stored.
*   **Graph Traversal & Relationship Inference:**
    *   Employ transformer-based models (e.g., Sentence-BERT) to calculate semantic similarity between translated `DocumentSegment`s.  High similarity suggests a potential relationship.
    *   Implement a rule-based system to infer relationships based on keywords, sentence structure, and context.
    *   Utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to learn complex relationships from the graph structure.  The GNN will be trained to predict relationship types and strengths.
*   **Cross-Lingual Alignment:**
    *   Translate all `DocumentSegment`s to a common pivot language (e.g., English) for similarity calculations.  Maintain original language metadata.
    *   Explore techniques for direct cross-lingual embedding alignment, avoiding the need for a pivot language.

**2.  Dynamic Graph Updates:**

*   **Real-time Ingestion:**  New documents are translated and integrated into the knowledge graph as they become available.
*   **Contextual Refinement:** The graph is continuously refined based on user interactions (e.g., document ratings, relevance feedback).
*   **Provenance Tracking:** Maintain a history of changes to the graph, allowing for auditing and reproducibility.

**3. Enhanced Summarization & Retrieval:**

*   **Query Expansion:** Expand user queries with related concepts from the knowledge graph.
*   **Multi-Document Summarization:** Generate summaries that synthesize information from multiple documents, leveraging the relationships in the graph to identify key themes and arguments.
*   **Evidence-Based Retrieval:** Retrieve documents that provide support for a specific claim, tracing the evidence through the relationships in the graph.
*   **Cross-Lingual Consistency Check:** Determine consistency between similar topics presented in different languages by checking the relationships between document segments.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function process_query(query, language):
  // 1. Expand query with related concepts from KG
  expanded_query = expand_query_with_kg(query, language)

  // 2. Retrieve relevant document segments
  relevant_segments = retrieve_segments(expanded_query)

  // 3. Rank segments based on relevance and KG support
  ranked_segments = rank_segments(relevant_segments)

  // 4. Generate summary using ranked segments and KG relationships
  summary = generate_summary(ranked_segments)

  return summary
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple document comparison or sentiment analysis. It actively builds a structured representation of *knowledge* across languages, allowing for more sophisticated reasoning and information synthesis. The dynamic nature of the graph allows it to adapt to new information and user feedback, creating a continuously improving knowledge base.
