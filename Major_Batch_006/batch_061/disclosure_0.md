## Adaptive Metamaterial Antenna Array

**Concept:** Utilizing the electrically adjustable path length concept from the provided patent, extend the design to incorporate a dynamically reconfigurable metamaterial layer *over* a traditional antenna element (e.g., a dipole or monopole). This metamaterial layer will consist of numerous individually controllable resonant elements. By adjusting the electrical path length within *each* metamaterial element, the overall radiation pattern, polarization, and bandwidth of the antenna can be shaped and steered in real-time *without* physical movement of the antenna itself.

**Specs:**

*   **Antenna Core:** Standard dipole or monopole antenna, optimized for a base operating frequency range (e.g., 700MHz - 2.5GHz).
*   **Metamaterial Layer:** A planar array of unit cells constructed from conductive traces and controllable switches (pin diodes, MOSFETs, or MEMS). Unit cell dimensions: 5mm x 5mm. Spacing between unit cells: 2.5mm. Array dimensions: 60mm x 60mm.
*   **Unit Cell Design:**  Each unit cell will be a split-ring resonator (SRR) or complementary SRR (CSRR) configuration. The 'gap' of the SRR/CSRR will contain a variable length electrical path created with a conductive trace and a switch.
*   **Switch Control:** Each switch will be directly connected to a microcontroller (or FPGA) capable of individually addressing each switch.
*   **Control Algorithm:**  A beamforming algorithm will reside on the microcontroller. This algorithm will:
    *   Receive input data regarding the desired beam direction, polarization, and bandwidth.
    *   Calculate the optimal configuration of switches for each unit cell to achieve the desired beam characteristics.
    *   Send control signals to the switches, adjusting the electrical path length within each unit cell.
*   **Material Selection:**  Substrate material: Rogers 4350B (loss tangent = 0.0037, dielectric constant = 3.66).  Conductive traces: Copper.
*   **Power Supply:** 3.3V DC.
*   **Communication Interface:** SPI or I2C for control signals from the main processing device.

**Pseudocode for Control Algorithm (Simplified):**

//   desired_azimuth:  Desired beam steering angle (degrees)
//   desired_elevation: Desired beam steering angle (degrees)
//   frequency: Operating frequency (Hz)

// Constants:
//   num_unit_cells_x: Number of unit cells in x-direction
//   num_unit_cells_y: Number of unit cells in y-direction
//   unit_cell_spacing: Distance between unit cells

// Variables:
//   switch_state[num_unit_cells_x][num_unit_cells_y]:  State of each switch (0 or 1)

function calculate_switch_states(desired_azimuth, desired_elevation, frequency):
    for i in range(num_unit_cells_x):
        for j in range(num_unit_cells_y):
            // Calculate phase shift required for unit cell (i, j) to steer beam
            phase_shift = calculate_phase_shift(i, j, desired_azimuth, desired_elevation, frequency)

            // Determine switch state based on required phase shift
            if phase_shift > threshold:
                switch_state[i][j] = 1 // Activate switch (shorter path)
            else:
                switch_state[i][j] = 0 // Deactivate switch (longer path)

    return switch_state

function apply_switch_states():
    for i in range(num_unit_cells_x):
        for j in range(num_unit_cells_y):
            set_switch_state(i, j, switch_state[i][j]) // Send signal to control switch
```
