**Dynamic Computational Aperture Array**

**Concept:** Instead of *two* apertures capturing different data sets, create an array of micro-apertures, each with individually controlled apertures, and dynamically adjust them *during* a single capture event. This surpasses simple dual-aperture systems, providing a high-dimensional data set for reconstruction.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** A micro-lens array (MLA) integrated with a high-resolution sensor. MLA consists of thousands of individually controllable micro-apertures. Each micro-aperture has a diameter ranging from 10-100 microns.
*   **Aperture Control:** Each micro-aperture utilizes MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) technology to precisely control aperture size and shape in real-time. Control range: 0-100% open, and adjustable circular/elliptical shapes. Response time: < 1 microsecond.
*   **Dynamic Capture Sequence:**
    1.  **Initialization:** All micro-apertures begin in a fully open state.
    2.  **Sequential Aperture Modulation:** The system cycles through each micro-aperture (or groups of them), rapidly modulating its aperture size and shape according to a pre-defined or AI-driven sequence.
    3.  **Capture Synchronization:** Each micro-aperture's illumination exposure is short, and synchronization is vital. Timing is achieved via a high-precision clock. Exposure duration range: 100 nanoseconds to 1 millisecond.
    4.  **Data Acquisition:** Sensor records data from each micro-aperture during its exposure.
*   **Computational Reconstruction Engine:** A dedicated processing unit that uses advanced algorithms to reconstruct a high-resolution, high-dynamic-range image from the combined data. This reconstruction engine should incorporate:
    *   **Point Spread Function (PSF) Modeling:** Accurate PSF modeling for each micro-aperture, accounting for diffraction, aberrations, and individual aperture characteristics.
    *   **Iterative Deconvolution:** Advanced iterative deconvolution algorithms to remove blur and artifacts.
    *   **AI-Powered Reconstruction:** Use machine learning models trained on simulated and real data to optimize reconstruction parameters and improve image quality.
*   **Metadata Recording:**  All aperture control parameters (size, shape, timing) are recorded as metadata alongside the captured data.
*   **System Integration:** The system is integrated into a camera module. Camera module has:
    *   Size: 50mm x 50mm x 30mm
    *   Power: < 5W
    *   Communication: USB-C, WiFi

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Engine):**

```
function reconstructImage(rawImageData, apertureMetadata):
  // 1. Calculate PSF for each micro-aperture based on apertureMetadata
  psfArray = calculatePSFArray(apertureMetadata)

  // 2. Perform iterative deconvolution
  blurredImage = rawImageData
  for i in range(numIterations):
    residual = blurredImage - image // initial estimate
    convolution = convolve(psfArray, residual)
    blurredImage = blurredImage + convolution * stepSize

  // 3. AI-powered refinement
  refinedImage = aiModel.predict(blurredImage)

  return refinedImage
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Unprecedented depth of field control.
*   Enhanced low-light performance.
*   Improved image sharpness.
*   Novel imaging modalities.
*   Computational light field capture.
