## Dynamic Segment Prediction & Prefetching

**Concept:** Enhance content delivery by proactively predicting which segments a mesh client will *likely* request next, based on viewing patterns, and prefetching those segments to the nearest node *before* the request arrives. This minimizes latency and buffering, particularly in congested networks.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Prefetch Agent (PPA). Implemented on each mesh node.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Real-time client request stream: Segment IDs, timestamps, client ID.
    *   Historical viewing data: Aggregated segment request history for all clients.
    *   Content metadata: Segment duration, overall media duration.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Hybrid approach.
    *   **Markov Model:** Based on the probability of a segment being requested immediately after another segment (short-term prediction). Trained on recent viewing data.
    *   **Collaborative Filtering:** Identifies clients with similar viewing patterns and predicts requests based on what those clients have watched (long-term prediction).
    *   **Content-Aware Prediction:**  Analyzes segment content (e.g., action scene vs. dialogue) to predict likely segment requests based on viewer engagement (requires basic segment analysis capability).
*   **Prefetching Strategy:**
    *   **Tiered Prefetching:**  Prefetch segments with high prediction probability to the requesting node's immediate neighbors (Tier 1). Lower probability segments prefetched to nodes further away (Tier 2).
    *   **Bandwidth Allocation:**  Dynamic bandwidth allocation for prefetching based on network congestion and prediction confidence. Prioritize segments with higher confidence and lower network load.
    *   **Cache Management:**  Prefetched segments have a lower eviction priority than currently requested segments.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Lightweight messaging protocol between nodes for segment prediction and prefetching requests.
*   **Pseudocode (PPA - Core Prediction Loop):**

```
// Variables
segment_request_history = {} // key: client ID, value: list of segment IDs
client_profiles = {} // key: client ID, value: viewing pattern vector
current_segment = null
predicted_next_segment = null
confidence_level = 0.0

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  current_segment = get_current_segment_request()

  if (current_segment != null) {
    update_request_history(current_segment)
    build_client_profiles()

    predicted_next_segment, confidence_level = predict_next_segment(current_segment)

    if (confidence_level > threshold) {
      prefetch_segment(predicted_next_segment)
    }
  }
}

function prefetch_segment(segment_id) {
  // Determine nearest node with available bandwidth
  nearest_node = find_nearest_node(segment_id)

  // Send prefetch request to nearest node
  send_prefetch_request(nearest_node, segment_id)
}
```

*   **Scalability Considerations:** Distributed prediction engine. Each node maintains a local prediction model and contributes to a global model through periodic data aggregation.

This system creates a proactive caching layer, drastically reducing latency and improving user experience, particularly for live streams and high-demand content.
