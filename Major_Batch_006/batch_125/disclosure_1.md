## Adaptive Acoustic Zones

**Concept:** Dynamically create and manage localized acoustic zones within a space, independent of traditional speaker placement, utilizing phased microphone and speaker arrays and beamforming. This builds on the device-directed speech detection by *creating* the ideal acoustic environment for that speech, rather than simply *detecting* it.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum 8x microphone array (MEMS preferable) distributed across device housing.
    *   Minimum 4x micro-speaker array, capable of independent volume/frequency control.
    *   Dedicated onboard DSP for real-time audio processing.
    *   Optional: Ultra-wideband (UWB) or similar precise location tracking for multiple users.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Zone Creation Module:**
        *   User Interface: Allows manual definition of acoustic zones (e.g., "focus on chair," "exclude area near window"). Zones are defined in 3D space.
        *   Automatic Zone Creation: Algorithm to identify likely speaker locations based on detected speech events, head tracking (if available), and room geometry.
    *   **Beamforming Engine:**
        *   Algorithm: Advanced beamforming techniques (e.g., delay-and-sum, minimum variance distortionless response) to focus audio input and output.
        *   Dynamic Adjustment: Real-time adaptation of beamforming parameters based on detected speech direction, noise levels, and zone configuration.
    *   **Zone Management Module:**
        *   Prioritization: Ability to assign priorities to different zones. Higher priority zones receive preferential beamforming focus.
        *   Overlap Handling: Algorithm to resolve conflicts when zones overlap. Strategies include:
            *   Weighted averaging of audio signals.
            *   Dynamic zone resizing.
            *   Priority-based exclusion.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:**
        *   Noise Cancellation: Advanced noise cancellation algorithms to minimize interference from external sources.
        *   Reverberation Control: Techniques to reduce reverberation within zones.
    *   **Integration with Device-Directed Speech Detection:**
        *   Triggered Zone Creation: Automatically create a zone focused on the speaker when device-directed speech is detected.
        *   Zone Refinement: Use device-directed speech detection data to refine zone parameters (e.g., direction, size).

*   **Pseudocode (Zone Creation & Speech Enhancement):**

```
//Initialization
define microphoneArray = [mic1, mic2, ... micN]
define speakerArray = [speaker1, speaker2, ... speakerM]
define currentZone = null

//Device Directed Speech Event
on DeviceDirectedSpeechDetected():
    if currentZone == null:
        currentZone = createZone(speakerLocation, zoneRadius) //Based on speech source
    else:
        refineZone(currentZone, speakerLocation)

//Create Zone Function
function createZone(location, radius):
    zone = new Zone(location, radius)
    calculateBeamformingWeights(zone)
    return zone

//Refine Zone Function
function refineZone(zone, location):
    zone.center = location
    zone.radius = updateRadius(location)
    recalculateBeamformingWeights(zone)

//Beamforming Weight Calculation
function calculateBeamformingWeights(zone):
    for each microphone in microphoneArray:
        calculateDelay(microphone, zone.center)
        applyPhaseShift(microphone, calculatedDelay)
    for each speaker in speakerArray:
        calculateDirection(speaker, zone.center)
        applyGain(speaker, calculatedDirection)
```

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Private conversations in open offices.
    *   Enhanced voice commands in noisy environments.
    *   Localized audio alerts for specific users.
    *   Immersive audio experiences for gaming or entertainment.

This allows the device to not just *hear* a directed speech, but to *create* the optimal listening environment for it, going beyond passive noise cancellation to active acoustic shaping.
