## Temporal Key Shards & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Instead of a single encrypted key with a limited lifetime, decompose the cryptographic key into multiple 'shards', each encrypted with a different key possessing *varying* lifetimes. Reconstruction requires a quorum of decrypted shards, and the availability of shards dynamically changes over time. This introduces a sliding window of accessibility and a more granular control over key availability.

**Specs:**

*   **Shard Count:**  System configurable, default = 5.
*   **Shard Encryption Keys:** Each shard is encrypted using a unique symmetric key.
*   **Key Lifetime Diversity:** Assign each shard encryption key a different, pre-defined lifetime. Example lifetimes: 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours.  These are *not* necessarily sequential; some may be very short, some very long.
*   **Quorum Requirement:** Define a minimum number of shards required to reconstruct the original key.  System configurable, default = 3.
*   **Key Reconstruction Process:**
    1.  Request for the original key arrives.
    2.  Identify available (not expired) shard encryption keys.
    3.  Decrypt available shards using their respective keys.
    4.  If the number of decrypted shards meets or exceeds the quorum requirement, reconstruct the original key.
    5.  If the quorum is not met, return an error indicating key unavailability.
*   **Shard Storage:** Shards are stored in a distributed data store with redundancy.
*   **Key Rotation:** Implement a mechanism to rotate shard encryption keys at the end of their lifetime.  New shards are generated and encrypted with fresh keys.
*   **Availability Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the availability of shards and trigger alerts if the number of available shards falls below the quorum requirement.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `CreateKey(durabilityParameters)`: Creates a new key, generating shards and assigning lifetimes.  `durabilityParameters` specifies preferred lifetime ranges or a desired availability profile.
    *   `GetKey(keyId)`:  Retrieves the key (reconstructing it if necessary).
    *   `GetKeyStatus(keyId)`: Returns the status of the key, including the number of available shards and the key's estimated remaining lifetime.

**Pseudocode for `GetKey`:**

```pseudocode
function GetKey(keyId):
    shardList = GetShardsForKey(keyId)  // Retrieve all shards associated with keyId
    availableShards = []

    for shard in shardList:
        if shard.encryptionKey.isStillValid():
            availableShards.append(shard)

    if len(availableShards) >= quorumRequirement:
        decryptedShards = []
        for shard in availableShards:
            decryptedShards.append(Decrypt(shard.encryptedData, shard.encryptionKey))

        originalKey = ReconstructKey(decryptedShards)
        return originalKey
    else:
        return Error("Key unavailable: Insufficient shards available.")
```

**Rationale:** This design offers enhanced security and availability compared to the original patent.  A single compromised or expired key does not immediately result in data loss.  The dynamic availability of shards introduces a layer of resilience.  The granularity of control allows for fine-tuning the trade-off between security and availability. The system will be able to generate a great deal of entropy for downstream consumption.
