## Adaptive Resource Proxying & Dynamic Capability Declaration

**Concept:** Extend the native shell functionality to not just *access* device resources based on content tags, but to proactively *proxy* resource requests to alternate devices or cloud services if the primary resource is unavailable or incapable.  Couple this with a dynamic capability declaration system, allowing apps to query for *effective* capabilities (what *can* be done, not just what *is* declared) and receive information about proxied resources.

**Specifications:**

**1. Capability Declaration & Query API:**

*   **`device.declareCapability(capabilityString, parameters)`:**  Native shell function. Allows the device/OS to declare a specific capability (e.g., "camera.highResolution", "gps.accuracy.5m").  Parameters provide specifics about the capability.
*   **`device.queryEffectiveCapability(capabilityString, requiredParameters)`:** App function.  Requests information about the *actual* capability available, given the device configuration, resource availability, and active proxies.  Returns a capability object with:
    *   `capabilityName`:  The name of the capability.
    *   `supported`: Boolean - True if the capability is available.
    *   `parameters`:  Dictionary of supported parameters.
    *   `proxyInfo`: Dictionary (if proxied). Contains:
        *   `proxyType`: (e.g., "bluetoothDevice", "cloudService", "nearbyDevice").
        *   `deviceId`: ID of the proxy device/service.
        *   `latencyEstimate`: Estimated latency in milliseconds.
        *   `dataCostEstimate`: Estimated data cost (if applicable).

**2. Resource Proxy Manager (RPM) – Native Shell Component:**

*   **Proxy Detection:** RPM constantly scans for available resources via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, and potentially cellular networks.  It also monitors cloud service availability.
*   **Resource Qualification:**  RPM evaluates discovered resources based on pre-defined criteria (latency, bandwidth, cost, security) and maintains a ranked list of potential proxies for each capability.
*   **Automatic Proxying:**  When an app requests a resource, and the native device resource is unavailable or insufficient, RPM automatically redirects the request to the highest-ranked qualified proxy.  This is transparent to the app.
*   **Dynamic Cost Negotiation:** RPM can negotiate resource usage costs with cloud services or other devices. It can prioritize proxies based on cost, performance, and user preferences.

**3. Content Tag Extensions:**

*   **`resource:priority:{high|medium|low}`:** Added to existing content tags.  Indicates the app’s priority for a particular resource.  RPM uses this to prioritize proxy selection.
*   **`resource:costLimit:{amount}`:** Limits the maximum cost the app is willing to pay for a proxied resource.
*   **`resource:latencyLimit:{milliseconds}`:** Limits the maximum acceptable latency for a proxied resource.

**Pseudocode (App Request Flow):**

```
app.requestResource("camera.highResolution")

// Native Shell intercepts request

if (device.isResourceAvailable("camera.highResolution")) {
    useLocalCamera()
} else {
    // RPM finds best proxy based on:
    // - device.queryEffectiveCapability("camera.highResolution")
    // - content tag parameters (priority, costLimit, latencyLimit)
    proxyDevice = RPM.findBestProxy("camera.highResolution")

    if (proxyDevice != null) {
        RPM.redirectRequest(proxyDevice, "camera.highResolution")
        useProxyCamera(proxyDevice)
    } else {
        // No proxy available - display error message
        displayErrorMessage("Camera not available")
    }
}
```

**Example Scenario:**

An app needs high-resolution GPS data, but the device’s internal GPS is weak. The RPM detects a nearby drone with a highly accurate GPS. It transparently proxies the GPS request to the drone, providing the app with accurate location data without the app needing to know the data source has changed.  The app also declares a cost limit, ensuring the drone doesn’t charge an exorbitant amount for its GPS service.
