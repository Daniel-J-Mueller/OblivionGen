**Adaptive Contextual Action Bundles**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend custom UI control generation beyond single actions to *bundles* of actions, dynamically assembled based on predicted user intent and environmental context.  Rather than a button for "reorder last item," create a “morning routine” bundle that encompasses ordering coffee, checking commute time, and playing a specific playlist – all initiated by a single UI element.

**II. Data Inputs:**

*   **User Action History:**  As in the base patent, track user actions, frequency, and timing.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Integrate data from device sensors (location, time of day, ambient noise, detected objects via camera, proximity to other devices). External data sources (weather, traffic, calendar events) are also leveraged.
*   **Contextual Awareness Engine:**  A machine learning model trained to infer user intent based on the combined data inputs.  This engine *predicts* not just *what* the user might do, but *sequences* of actions they are likely to perform.
*   **Action Library:** A database containing individual actions, their parameters, and dependencies.  This library is extensible and allows for community contributions of new actions.

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Contextual Analysis Module:**  Continuously monitors user activity, environmental data, and calendar/schedule information.
2.  **Intent Prediction Engine:**  Uses ML models to predict likely action sequences based on current context.  Output is a ranked list of potential action bundles.
3.  **Bundle Generation Module:**  Assembles action bundles from the Action Library, incorporating user preferences and available parameters.
4.  **UI Control Generator:**  Creates a custom UI element (e.g., a single button, a dynamic menu) representing the action bundle.
5.  **Execution Engine:**  Orchestrates the execution of actions within the bundle, handling dependencies and error conditions.

**IV. Pseudocode (Bundle Generation):**

```
function generateBundle(userID, contextData):
  // 1. Get predicted action sequences
  predictedSequences = IntentPredictionEngine.predict(userID, contextData)

  // 2. Filter and rank sequences based on confidence and user preferences
  filteredSequences = filterSequences(predictedSequences, userID.preferences)
  rankedSequences = rankSequences(filteredSequences)

  // 3. Select top-ranked sequence
  selectedSequence = rankedSequences[0]

  // 4. Construct bundle from selected sequence
  bundle = Bundle(actions: selectedSequence.actions, parameters: getUserParameters(userID))

  // 5. Generate UI control
  uiControl = UIControlGenerator.generate(bundle)

  return uiControl
```

**V. Example Scenarios:**

*   **"Leaving for Work" Bundle:**  Automatically locks smart home devices, sets thermostat to away mode, starts navigation app, and plays a news podcast.  Triggered by the user leaving their home location (geofencing).
*   **"Evening Wind-Down" Bundle:**  Dims smart lights, sets thermostat to a comfortable temperature, starts a relaxing playlist, and sends a "goodnight" message to a designated contact.  Triggered by the user’s calendar event ending and ambient light level dropping.
*   **"Grocery Restock" Bundle:**  Analyzes smart refrigerator contents, identifies low-stock items, adds them to an online shopping cart, and schedules a delivery. Triggered by refrigerator inventory data and user purchasing habits.

**VI. Novelty:**

The key difference from the referenced patent is the shift from single-action UI controls to *dynamic action bundles*. This requires a more sophisticated contextual awareness engine and a flexible system for composing and executing complex action sequences. The system anticipates user needs *before* they explicitly request an action, creating a more seamless and intuitive user experience. It moves from *reactive* automation to *proactive* assistance.
