## Adaptive Keyword Sensitivity Based on Acoustic Environment

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust keyword detection sensitivity based on real-time analysis of the surrounding acoustic environment, preemptively mitigating false positives *before* needing to temporarily disable detection. This moves beyond simply reacting to detected keywords and focuses on *predictive* adjustment.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Microphone Array:** A minimum of three microphones strategically positioned to capture spatial audio information.
*   **Dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor):**  High-performance DSP to handle real-time acoustic environment analysis and sensitivity adjustment.  Must be capable of FFT, spectral analysis, and noise profiling.
*   **Ambient Noise Sensor:** A dedicated sensor to measure overall sound pressure levels. Optional, but enhances accuracy.
*   **Existing Keyword Detection System:**  The system outlined in patent 10679625, treated as a module.

**II. Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Acoustic Environment Profiling:**
    *   Continuously analyze audio from the microphone array.
    *   Perform FFT to determine the dominant frequencies present in the environment.
    *   Categorize the environment based on pre-defined profiles (e.g., "Quiet Office", "Busy Street", "Concert", "Restaurant").  Machine learning (clustering algorithms) will be used to refine these profiles over time and create new ones.
    *   Calculate a "Noise Floor" - the average sound level excluding transient sounds (e.g., speech).

2.  **Keyword Sensitivity Mapping:**
    *   Create a mapping between acoustic environment categories and optimal keyword detection sensitivity levels.
    *   Example:
        *   "Quiet Office" -> High Sensitivity
        *   "Busy Street" -> Medium Sensitivity
        *   "Concert" -> Low Sensitivity
    *   This mapping should be configurable and adjustable via a user interface.

3.  **Real-Time Sensitivity Adjustment:**
    *   Continuously monitor the acoustic environment.
    *   Based on the current environment category, automatically adjust the sensitivity of the keyword detection system.

4.  **Transient Noise Suppression:**
    *   Implement a transient noise detection algorithm.  This algorithm identifies sudden, short-duration sounds (e.g., door slams, keyboard clicks).
    *   Temporarily *reduce* keyword sensitivity for a short duration after a transient noise event. This avoids triggering keywords due to the sound event itself.

5.  **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):**
    *   Implement robust VAD to differentiate between speech and non-speech sounds.
    *   Only apply the sensitivity adjustments during periods of voice activity.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
define acoustic_profiles = [("Quiet Office", high_sensitivity), ("Busy Street", medium_sensitivity), ...]
define transient_noise_duration = 0.5 seconds

// Main Loop
while (true):
    // 1. Analyze Acoustic Environment
    environment_category = analyze_acoustic_environment(microphone_array)

    // 2. Adjust Keyword Sensitivity
    keyword_sensitivity = get_sensitivity_for_category(environment_category)
    set_keyword_sensitivity(keyword_sensitivity)

    // 3. Transient Noise Detection
    if (detect_transient_noise(microphone_array)):
        reduce_keyword_sensitivity(very_low_sensitivity, transient_noise_duration)

    // 4. Voice Activity Detection
    if (detect_voice_activity(microphone_array)):
        // Apply sensitivity adjustments as defined above
    else:
        // Maintain default sensitivity
```

**IV. Refinements:**

*   **User Profiles:**  Allow users to create custom acoustic profiles based on their typical environments.
*   **Directional Audio Analysis:** Use the microphone array to determine the direction of sound sources and prioritize keyword detection from the direction of the user's voice.
*    **AI-Driven Profile Learning:** Implement a machine learning model to automatically learn and refine acoustic profiles based on user feedback and usage patterns.
