## Dynamic Execution Environment Federation

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand code execution system to operate across a *federation* of native hypervisors, dynamically routing execution based on resource availability, security policies, and proximity to data. This creates a distributed, resilient, and scalable execution platform.

**Specifications:**

**1. Federation Manager Component:**

*   **Function:** Central coordinating component responsible for managing the federation of native hypervisors.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `HypervisorNode`: Represents a single native hypervisor in the federation. Stores:
        *   `ID`: Unique identifier.
        *   `Address`: Network address.
        *   `ResourcePool`: Available CPU, Memory, Storage, Bandwidth (quantified).
        *   `SecurityProfile`: Access control lists, trust levels.
        *   `DataLocality`: Metadata on data hosted locally.
        *   `Status`: Online/Offline, Busy/Idle.
    *   `ExecutionRequest`: Represents a code execution request. Stores:
        *   `RequestID`: Unique identifier.
        *   `UserID`: User associated with the request.
        *   `Code`: Code to be executed.
        *   `Dependencies`: External libraries or data.
        *   `SecurityContext`: Required permissions.
        *   `Priority`: Execution priority.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   `NodeSelection(ExecutionRequest)`: Selects the optimal `HypervisorNode` based on resource availability, security context, data locality, and priority. Prioritizes nodes with local data access to minimize latency. Implements a weighted scoring system.
    *   `LoadBalancing()`: Monitors resource utilization across the federation and dynamically adjusts task assignments to prevent overload. Uses a proportional allocation algorithm.

**2. Agent Modifications:**

*   **Federation Awareness:** The agent process on each native hypervisor must be modified to communicate with the Federation Manager and report resource status.
*   **Task Reception:** The agent must be able to receive execution tasks from the Federation Manager, rather than solely from the initial service.
*   **Security Enforcement:** The agent is responsible for enforcing the security context associated with each execution task.

**3. Communication Protocol:**

*   **gRPC:** Use gRPC for efficient and reliable communication between the Federation Manager and the agents. Define a clear API for:
    *   `RegisterNode()`: Agents register with the Federation Manager.
    *   `ReportStatus()`: Agents report resource status.
    *   `RequestTask()`: Federation Manager requests an agent to execute a task.
    *   `SendResults()`: Agent sends execution results back to the Federation Manager.

**4. Dynamic Environment Provisioning:**

*   **Containerization:** Leverage containerization technologies (e.g., Docker) to create portable and isolated execution environments within the native hypervisors.
*   **Environment Templates:** Define reusable environment templates that specify the required dependencies and configurations.

**5. Pseudocode (Federation Manager - Node Selection):**

```pseudocode
function NodeSelection(ExecutionRequest request):
  nodes = GetAvailableNodes()
  bestNode = null
  bestScore = -1

  for node in nodes:
    score = CalculateScore(node, request)
    if score > bestScore:
      bestScore = score
      bestNode = node

  if bestNode != null:
    SendTask(bestNode, request)
    return bestNode
  else:
    //Handle case where no suitable node is available (e.g., queue request, retry)
    return null

function CalculateScore(node, request):
  score = 0
  //Resource availability
  score += node.ResourcePool.CPU * 0.3
  score += node.ResourcePool.Memory * 0.3
  //Security match
  if node.SecurityProfile.matches(request.SecurityContext):
    score += 0.2
  //Data Locality
  if node.DataLocality.contains(request.Dependencies):
    score += 0.2
  return score
```

**Innovation:** This approach moves beyond a single native hypervisor to create a dynamic, scalable, and resilient execution platform. By federating resources and leveraging data locality, it reduces latency, improves resource utilization, and enhances security. This lays the groundwork for a truly distributed on-demand code execution system.
