## Dynamic Focus Prediction & Pre-Highlighting

**Concept:** Enhance object traversal by *predicting* the user's intended next focus object and subtly pre-highlighting it *before* the traversal is fully committed. This minimizes perceived latency and creates a smoother, more intuitive experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Traversal Data Collection:** Track user traversal history (direction, speed, object types previously focused on). Store this data locally on the device.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Implement a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a simple Markov model or a small neural network) trained on the traversal data. This model predicts the most likely next object based on the current focus and traversal direction.
*   **Pre-Highlighting Mechanism:** When the user *initiates* a traversal (e.g., presses a directional key or swipes), *immediately* subtly highlight the predicted next object.  The highlighting should be visually distinct but non-intrusive â€“ a slight glow, a subtle color shift, or a momentary outline.
*   **Confirmation/Correction Phase:**
    *   If the user continues in the predicted direction (e.g., holds the directional key), the focus smoothly transitions to the pre-highlighted object.
    *   If the user changes direction *before* reaching the pre-highlighted object, the pre-highlighting is immediately cancelled, and a new prediction is calculated based on the new direction.
*   **Dynamic Prediction Weighting:**  Implement a system to dynamically adjust the weighting of the prediction engine. Factors influencing weighting:
    *   **Prediction Accuracy:**  Track the percentage of accurate predictions. Higher accuracy = higher weighting.
    *   **User Override Rate:** Track how often the user overrides the prediction by navigating to a different object than predicted. Higher override rate = lower weighting.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Factor in the application context (e.g., different weighting for image galleries vs. document editing).
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Optionally, provide subtle haptic feedback when the predicted object is pre-highlighted and when the focus transitions to it.
*   **Accessibility Considerations:**  Provide an option to disable pre-highlighting for users who find it distracting or visually overwhelming.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predictNextObject(currentObject, traversalDirection, traversalHistory):
  // 1. Calculate probabilities based on traversal history
  objectProbabilities = calculateObjectProbabilities(traversalHistory, traversalDirection)

  // 2. Filter out objects that are impossible to reach in the given direction
  reachableObjects = filterReachableObjects(currentObject, traversalDirection)

  // 3. Normalize probabilities for reachable objects
  normalizedProbabilities = normalizeProbabilities(objectProbabilities, reachableObjects)

  // 4. Select the object with the highest probability
  predictedObject = selectObjectWithHighestProbability(normalizedProbabilities)

  return predictedObject
```

**Example:**

Imagine a user navigating a list of files. The user consistently focuses on files with the ".txt" extension after moving down from a folder. The prediction engine would learn this pattern and pre-highlight the next ".txt" file when the user moves down from a folder, anticipating their likely intention.
