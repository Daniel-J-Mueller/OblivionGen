**Dynamic Key Hierarchy with Temporal and Geographic Fencing – "Chameleon Keys"**

**Concept:** Expand upon the hierarchical key derivation by introducing dynamic adjustments to key access and validity based on real-time temporal and geographic data.  Instead of static usage restrictions baked into the key derivation, implement a system where keys ‘morph’ – their effective permissions change – based on external conditions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Key Metadata:** Each subordinate key within the hierarchy will have associated metadata including:
    *   `base_permissions`: The core set of permissions the key possesses when no external factors apply.
    *   `temporal_rules`: A list of time-based rules (start time, end time, recurring schedules) and associated permission modifiers (add, remove, override).
    *   `geographic_rules`: A list of geographic regions (defined by coordinates, polygons, or geofences) and associated permission modifiers.
    *   `rule_priority`: Integer value for precedence if multiple rules apply.

2.  **Rule Engine:** A dedicated component that monitors real-time temporal and geographic data.  This engine will:
    *   Receive requests for decryption/encryption.
    *   Identify the subordinate key involved.
    *   Fetch the key’s metadata.
    *   Evaluate `temporal_rules` and `geographic_rules` against current time/location data.
    *   Apply permission modifiers to `base_permissions` based on rule evaluation and priority.
    *   Provide an *effective permissions* set for the request.

3.  **Location Services Integration:**  Support for multiple location service providers (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, IP geolocation).  Data fusion to improve accuracy and reliability.

4.  **Time Synchronization:**  NTP/SNTP integration to ensure accurate time across the system.

5.  **Key Update Mechanism:** Support for periodic or event-triggered key rotation. Incorporate mechanisms for securely distributing updated keys and metadata.

6.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /key/{key_id}/metadata`: Returns the key’s metadata (excluding the key itself for security).
    *   `POST /key/{key_id}/validate`:  Validates a request based on current time and location, returning an `effective permissions` set.
    *    `POST /key/{key_id}/rotate`: Initiates key rotation.

**Pseudocode (Validation Process):**

```
function validateRequest(key_id, request_data, current_time, current_location):
  key_metadata = getMetadata(key_id)
  effective_permissions = key_metadata.base_permissions

  for rule in key_metadata.temporal_rules:
    if rule.isWithinRange(current_time):
      effective_permissions = applyModifier(effective_permissions, rule.modifier)

  for rule in key_metadata.geographic_rules:
    if rule.isWithinRegion(current_location):
      effective_permissions = applyModifier(effective_permissions, rule.modifier)

  return effective_permissions
```

**Example Use Case:**

A document is encrypted with a key having a `base_permissions` allowing read access.  A `temporal_rule` restricts access to 9-5 business hours. A `geographic_rule` restricts access to a specific office location.  If a user attempts to access the document outside of business hours or from an unauthorized location, the validation process will deny access even if the key is technically valid.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Protect the rule engine from tampering.
*   Secure the location data source.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for rule management.
*   Regularly audit the rule configuration.
