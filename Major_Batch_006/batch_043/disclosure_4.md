## Automated Cable Mapping & Verification System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple cable transfer to incorporate automated cable mapping *during* the transfer process, and verification of connection integrity *before* and *after* switch/router replacement. This ensures accurate reconnection and minimizes downtime.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Smart Holding Fixture:** Modified holding fixture (as per the patent) incorporating:
    *   Individual port sensors (optical/electrical depending on cable type) within each receptacle.
    *   Microcontroller with communication capabilities (WiFi/Bluetooth).
    *   Small OLED display on the fixture frame for status updates.
    *   RFID/NFC reader/writer.
*   **Cable Tagging System:**  Small, durable RFID/NFC tags designed to be attached to individual cable ends. These tags store pre-configured port mapping data.
*   **Verification Probe:** Handheld probe with optical/electrical connectors matching the cable types. Connects to the smart holding fixture or directly to switch/router ports. Includes a pass/fail indicator.
*   **Base Station/Software:** A central computer running software to receive data from the smart holding fixture, manage cable maps, and display connection status.

**2. Software/Firmware Functionality:**

*   **Cable Mapping:**
    *   Before replacement, the system scans each cable with the RFID/NFC reader, capturing the source port information.
    *   The software builds a virtual cable map, storing the source and destination port assignments.
*   **Transfer Process Integration:**
    *   As each cable is placed into the smart holding fixture, the system confirms its presence via the port sensor.
    *   The virtual cable map updates to reflect the cableâ€™s current location (in the fixture).
*   **Connection Verification (Pre-Replacement):**
    *   Before removing the old switch/router, the software initiates a connection test via the verification probe.
    *   It confirms signal integrity from the source port to the cable end in the holding fixture.
*   **Connection Verification (Post-Replacement):**
    *   After installing the new switch/router, the software initiates another connection test.
    *   It verifies signal integrity from the cable end in the holding fixture to the corresponding destination port on the new switch/router.
*   **Error Handling & Reporting:**
    *   If a connection fails during verification, the software flags the cable, displays the error on the OLED screen, and provides troubleshooting steps.
    *   A comprehensive log of all connections, errors, and verification results is stored on the base station.

**3. Operational Flow (Pseudocode):**

```
// Pre-Replacement Phase
FOR EACH cable IN cableList:
    Scan RFID/NFC tag
    Read sourcePort FROM tag
    Add sourcePort, cableID to virtualCableMap
    
// Transfer Phase
FOR EACH cable IN cableList:
    Place cable into receptacle IN smartHoldingFixture
    Confirm receptacleSensorActive FOR receptacle
    Update virtualCableMap: cableLocation = receptacleID
    
// Replacement Phase (Old Switch Removed, New Switch Installed)
FOR EACH cable IN cableList:
    Connect verificationProbe TO receptacle
    Initiate signalTest FROM sourcePort TO receptacle
    IF signalTest Fails:
        Log error
        Display error on OLED
        Alert operator
    ELSE:
        Connect cable FROM receptacle TO destinationPort ON newSwitch
        Initiate signalTest FROM receptacle TO destinationPort
        IF signalTest Fails:
            Log error
            Display error on OLED
            Alert operator
        ELSE:
            Mark cable as verified
```

**4. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Automated Cable Tagging:** Integrate a robotic arm to automatically attach RFID/NFC tags to cables during installation.
*   **AI-Powered Error Prediction:** Use machine learning to analyze connection data and predict potential failures before they occur.
*   **Remote Monitoring & Control:** Enable remote access to the system for monitoring and troubleshooting from any location.
