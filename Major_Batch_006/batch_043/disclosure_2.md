## Adaptive Persona Synthesis from Multi-Modal Interaction Data

**Core Concept:** Extend the agent definition process beyond textual transcripts to incorporate audio/visual data, allowing for the creation of agents with more nuanced and realistic behavioral profiles. This goes beyond simply *understanding* intent to *emulating* personality.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:** System accepts input streams encompassing:
    *   Text transcripts (as per existing patent).
    *   Audio recordings of communications (speech, tone, prosody).
    *   Video recordings of communications (facial expressions, body language).
*   **Synchronization:** Establish precise temporal alignment between all input modalities (text, audio, video) using timestamps.
*   **Feature Extraction:**
    *   **Text:** Utilize transformer models for embedding (as per patent) *and* sentiment/emotion analysis.
    *   **Audio:** Extract acoustic features (pitch, energy, formant frequencies, speaking rate) and utilize audio-based emotion recognition models.
    *   **Video:** Utilize computer vision models for facial expression recognition, body language analysis, and gaze tracking.
*   **Data Fusion:** Combine extracted features from all modalities into a unified multi-modal representation. This could involve concatenation, weighted averaging, or more complex fusion techniques.

**II. Persona Profile Generation:**

*   **Behavioral Trait Identification:** Utilize machine learning models (clustering, dimensionality reduction) to identify dominant behavioral traits exhibited by the entities involved in the communication. Traits could include:
    *   Assertiveness
    *   Empathy
    *   Patience
    *   Humor
    *   Formality
*   **Trait Weighting:** Assign weights to each trait based on its frequency and intensity across the communication data.
*   **Persona Vector:**  Represent the identified persona as a vector where each element corresponds to the weight of a specific behavioral trait.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Implement a mechanism for updating the persona vector over time as new communication data becomes available. This allows the agent to adapt to changes in the behavior of the entities it interacts with.

**III. Agent Definition Refinement:**

*   **Augmented API Mapping:** Extend the existing API mapping to include parameters that control the agent's behavioral traits. For example, an API call might include a parameter for "assertiveness level" or "empathy response".
*   **Behavioral Response Generation:** Utilize the persona vector to influence the agent’s response generation process. For instance, a highly assertive agent might generate more direct and demanding responses, while a highly empathetic agent might generate more supportive and understanding responses.
*   **Utterance Styling:** Employ text-to-speech synthesis with parameters adjusted based on the persona vector (e.g., tone of voice, speaking rate, prosody) to create more realistic and engaging agent utterances.
*   **Avatar Animation:** (If applicable) Utilize the persona vector to drive the animation of an agent avatar, creating non-verbal cues that reflect the agent’s personality.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function generate_agent_definition(transcripts, audio, video):
  // Extract features from each modality
  text_embedding = extract_text_features(transcripts)
  audio_features = extract_audio_features(audio)
  video_features = extract_video_features(video)

  // Fuse features into a multi-modal representation
  multi_modal_representation = fuse_features(text_embedding, audio_features, video_features)

  // Identify behavioral traits
  persona_vector = identify_traits(multi_modal_representation)

  //Augment API Mapping
  augmented_api_mapping = update_api_mapping(persona_vector)

  //Generate Agent Definition
  agent_definition = create_agent_definition(augmented_api_mapping, persona_vector)

  return agent_definition
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   More realistic and engaging virtual assistants.
*   Personalized customer service agents.
*   Adaptive training simulations.
*   AI companions with distinct personalities.
