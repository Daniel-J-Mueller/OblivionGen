**Adaptive Query Decomposition & Parallel Execution Across Database Instances**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the proxyâ€™s functionality to decompose complex database queries into smaller, independent sub-queries. These sub-queries are then distributed and executed *concurrently* across multiple database instances (potentially a mix of the original and scaled instances).  The proxy reassembles the results before returning them to the client.

**II. Components:**

*   **Query Decomposition Engine (within Proxy):**  Analyzes incoming queries.  Identifies independent clauses (e.g., `WHERE` conditions applying to different data subsets, independent `JOIN` operations).  Uses a cost-based optimizer to determine the optimal decomposition strategy (minimize overall execution time).
*   **Task Dispatcher (within Proxy):**  Distributes decomposed sub-queries to available database instances. Maintains a status tracker for each sub-query.  Prioritizes sub-queries based on dependencies and estimated execution time.
*   **Result Aggregator (within Proxy):** Collects results from each database instance. Reassembles the results in the correct order based on the original query.  Handles potential errors from individual database instances.
*   **Database Instance Registry:** Maintains a list of available database instances, their capabilities (e.g., supported query types, data schema versions), and current load.  This allows the Task Dispatcher to select the most appropriate instances for each sub-query.
*   **Dynamic Schema Mapping:**  Handles potential schema differences between database instances.  The proxy dynamically maps column names and data types as needed.

**III. Pseudocode (Task Dispatcher):**

```
function dispatch_query(query, database_registry):
    decomposition_plan = query_decomposition_engine.decompose(query)
    tasks = decomposition_plan.generate_tasks()

    for task in tasks:
        best_instance = database_registry.select_instance(task.requirements)
        if best_instance is null:
            // Handle case where no suitable instance is available (e.g., retry, error)
            log_error("No suitable database instance found for task")
            continue

        task.assign_to_instance(best_instance)
        best_instance.execute_task(task)

    results = []
    for task in tasks:
        results.append(task.get_result())

    return results
```

**IV. Implementation Details:**

*   **Communication:** Use a lightweight communication protocol (e.g., gRPC, message queue) for communication between the proxy and database instances.
*   **Data Serialization:**  Use a efficient data serialization format (e.g., Protocol Buffers, Avro) to minimize data transfer overhead.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures in individual database instances.
*   **Transaction Management:** Support distributed transactions to ensure data consistency across multiple database instances. (Optional, depending on application requirements.)

**V. Novelty:**

This design goes beyond simply scaling *to* a new instance. It actively *utilizes* multiple instances *concurrently* for a single query, maximizing throughput and responsiveness.  It is also adaptable to heterogeneous database environments. This approach moves past simply switching connections on a failure or during scale events. It moves towards a proactive utilization of multiple databases for a single query. This isn't simply failover, but a performance enhancement.
