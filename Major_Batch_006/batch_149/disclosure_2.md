## Personalized Content 'Echo' System

**Core Concept:** Extend the intent modeling to proactively *predict* user intent shifts based on content consumption patterns, creating a personalized “echo” of anticipated information needs. This goes beyond reacting to a current query; it anticipates *future* queries based on observed behavioral ‘resonances.’

**Specifications:**

**1. Resonance Vector Generation:**

*   **Data Inputs:** User interaction data (clicks, dwell time, shares, purchases), content metadata (tags, categories, entities), query history, session data.
*   **Process:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, trained to predict the *next* content category or query a user will likely engage with. The LSTM outputs a "Resonance Vector" representing the probability distribution over potential future information needs.
*   **Output:** A dynamic Resonance Vector, updated in real-time with each user interaction. The vector's dimensionality should be high enough to capture a nuanced range of intents (e.g., 512-1024 dimensions).

**2.  Proactive Content Prefetching & Ranking:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Based on the Resonance Vector, prefetch a diverse set of content candidates likely to align with predicted future intents. This is done *before* the user explicitly issues a new query.
    *   Rank these prefetched candidates based on a combined score:
        *   **Resonance Score:** Dot product between the Resonance Vector and a content embedding vector representing the candidate's semantic meaning.
        *   **Normalized Performance Value (from original patent):** Maintain the existing performance ranking mechanism for relevance.
        *   **Diversity Penalty:**  Introduce a penalty to prevent the recommendation of overly similar content, encouraging exploration.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of proactively recommended content, displayed to the user alongside or separate from standard search results.

**3.  Intent Drift Detection & Correction:**

*   **Process:** Continuously monitor the user's actual interactions.  Calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted intent distribution (from the Resonance Vector) and the observed interaction distribution. 
*   **Thresholding:** If the KL divergence exceeds a pre-defined threshold, indicate a significant "Intent Drift."
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Resonance Vector Reset:** Partially or fully reset the Resonance Vector, giving more weight to recent interactions.
    *   **Exploration Boost:** Increase the diversity penalty to encourage exploration of different content categories.

**4.  System Architecture:**

*   **Components:**
    *   **Interaction Data Collector:**  Gathers user interaction data.
    *   **Resonance Vector Generator:** LSTM network trained to predict future intents.
    *   **Content Index:** Stores content metadata and embeddings.
    *   **Ranking Engine:** Combines Resonance Score, Normalized Performance Value, and Diversity Penalty.
    *   **Intent Drift Detector:** Monitors intent changes and adjusts the system accordingly.
*   **Deployment:**  Cloud-based microservices architecture for scalability and resilience.

**Pseudocode (Ranking Engine):**

```
function rank_content(content_list, resonance_vector, content_embeddings, normalized_performance_values, diversity_penalty_weight):
  ranked_list = []
  for content in content_list:
    resonance_score = dot_product(resonance_vector, content_embeddings[content])
    diversity_score = calculate_diversity_score(content, ranked_list) #Based on semantic similarity to already ranked items
    combined_score = resonance_score + normalized_performance_values[content] - diversity_penalty_weight * diversity_score
    ranked_list.append((content, combined_score))
  ranked_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  return ranked_list
```
