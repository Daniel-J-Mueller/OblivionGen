## Multi-Modal Pseudorandom Sequencing for Subsurface Mapping

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Concept:** Extend the pseudorandom signal ranging system to incorporate multiple signal modalities (acoustic, electromagnetic – specifically Ultra-Wideband (UWB), and potentially ground-penetrating radar (GPR)) operating simultaneously. This creates a multi-dimensional data set for improved object detection, material characterization, and subsurface mapping.

*   **Transmitter Array:**  A distributed array of transmitters mounted to a vehicle (aerial, ground-based, or underwater). Each transmitter is capable of generating pseudorandom sequences across *at least* two modalities – acoustic and UWB.  GPR capability is optional but highly desirable.  Transmitters should be phase-synchronized via a central clock to ensure temporal coherence.  Each transmitter will be individually addressable for sequence assignment and power control.

*   **Receiver Array:** A multi-modal receiver array capable of capturing acoustic, UWB, and potentially GPR signals simultaneously. The array will utilize beamforming techniques to focus on specific directions and improve signal-to-noise ratio. Receivers should have high dynamic range to capture both near-field and far-field reflections.

*   **Pseudorandom Sequence Generation & Assignment:**  Each transmitter is assigned a *unique* pseudorandom sequence for each modality. Sequences should be orthogonal or nearly orthogonal to minimize cross-correlation interference.  Sequence lengths should be adjustable based on desired range resolution and ambiguity limits. A central control system manages sequence assignment and synchronization.

*   **Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    1.  **Simultaneous Transmission:** All transmitters simultaneously broadcast their assigned pseudorandom sequences across their enabled modalities.
    2.  **Multi-Modal Capture:** The receiver array captures the reflected signals across all modalities.
    3.  **Cross-Correlation Analysis:**  The received signals are cross-correlated with the known pseudorandom sequences. This determines the time-of-flight for each modality.
    4.  **Data Fusion:**  Time-of-flight data from multiple modalities is fused to create a more accurate and robust range estimate. Algorithms should account for differences in signal propagation speed across modalities.
    5.  **Subsurface Reconstruction:**  Range data is used to reconstruct a 3D representation of the surrounding environment, including subsurface features. Algorithms should incorporate signal attenuation and reflection characteristics specific to each modality to improve reconstruction accuracy.

*   **Pseudocode (Data Fusion & Reconstruction):**

```pseudocode
// Inputs:
//   tof_acoustic[i]: Time of flight (acoustic) for signal i
//   tof_uwb[i]: Time of flight (UWB) for signal i
//   signal_strength_acoustic[i]: Signal strength (acoustic)
//   signal_strength_uwb[i]: Signal strength (UWB)

function fuse_data(tof_acoustic, tof_uwb, signal_strength_acoustic, signal_strength_uwb):

    //Weighting based on signal strength and modality characteristics
    weight_acoustic = signal_strength_acoustic / (signal_strength_acoustic + signal_strength_uwb)
    weight_uwb = signal_strength_uwb / (signal_strength_acoustic + signal_strength_uwb)

    //Combined ToF estimate
    combined_tof = (weight_acoustic * tof_acoustic) + (weight_uwb * tof_uwb)

    return combined_tof

function reconstruct_subsurface(combined_tof, transmitter_location, receiver_location):

    //Calculate range
    range = (combined_tof * speed_of_light) / 2

    //Calculate point cloud coordinates
    point_x = transmitter_location.x + (range * cos(transmitter_location.yaw))
    point_y = transmitter_location.y + (range * sin(transmitter_location.yaw))
    point_z = transmitter_location.z

    return (point_x, point_y, point_z)
```

*   **Potential Applications:** Archaeological surveying, underground infrastructure mapping, geological exploration, non-destructive testing, search and rescue operations in collapsed structures.
