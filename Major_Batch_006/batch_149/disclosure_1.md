## Dynamic Contextual Rating via Generative AI "Mood" Analysis

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond static content descriptors and rating schemas by analyzing the *emotional impact* of a scene using generative AI models. This will create a dynamic, nuanced rating system responding to subjective experience, moving beyond simple object/action/location identification.

**Specs:**

1.  **AI Model:** Train a Generative AI model (e.g., a diffusion model or transformer) on a massive dataset of video content *paired with human emotional responses* (gathered via surveys, biometric data – heart rate, facial expressions – while watching the content). The model learns to map visual/auditory features to perceived emotional states ("mood"). Mood states can include not just broad categories (happy, sad, scared) but more granular ones (melancholy, anxious, triumphant).
2.  **Scene Segmentation:** Implement a robust scene segmentation algorithm. This goes beyond simple shot detection. We want to delineate "emotional units" within a video – a sequence of frames that conveys a specific emotional arc. The segmentation should be adaptable, allowing for shorter or longer units based on the complexity of the scene.
3.  **Mood Vector Generation:** For each segmented scene, feed the video data into the trained Generative AI model. The model outputs a "mood vector" – a multi-dimensional representation of the scene’s emotional profile. This vector captures the intensity of various emotional states.
4.  **Dynamic Rating Schema:** Develop a rating schema that incorporates mood vectors. Instead of static age-appropriate labels, the system assigns a “mood profile” to each scene. This profile defines the dominant emotions and their intensity.
5.  **User Preference Mapping:** Allow users (parents/guardians) to define their sensitivity preferences. For example, a user might indicate a low tolerance for anxiety-inducing content, or a high tolerance for sadness.
6.  **Real-Time Adjustment:** During playback, the system compares the scene’s mood profile to the user’s preferences. If the scene’s mood deviates significantly from the user's profile, the system can:
    *   **Adjust playback:** Blur the scene, mute the audio, or skip it entirely.
    *   **Provide warnings:** Display a notification indicating that the upcoming scene may be emotionally intense.
    *   **Offer alternatives:** Suggest a different version of the scene or a different video altogether.

**Pseudocode (Playback Adjustment):**

```
function adjustPlayback(sceneMoodVector, userPreferenceVector) {
  similarityScore = calculateCosineSimilarity(sceneMoodVector, userPreferenceVector);

  if (similarityScore < threshold) { // threshold value determined empirically
    // Significant deviation from user preferences
    if (userSetting == "blur") {
        applyBlurEffect(videoFrame);
    } else if (userSetting == "mute") {
        muteAudio(videoFrame);
    } else if (userSetting == "skip") {
        skipToNextScene();
    } else {
        displayWarning("Upcoming scene may be emotionally intense.");
    }
  }
}

function calculateCosineSimilarity(vector1, vector2) {
    // Standard cosine similarity calculation
}

function applyBlurEffect(videoFrame) {
    // Apply Gaussian blur to the video frame
}

function muteAudio(videoFrame) {
    // Set audio volume to 0
}

function skipToNextScene() {
    // Advance to the next segmented scene
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU for AI model inference.
*   Large-scale storage for training data and AI model weights.
*   Real-time video processing pipeline.
*   User interface for preference management.
