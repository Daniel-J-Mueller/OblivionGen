## Acoustic Camouflage - Speaker Array & Environmental Mapping

**Concept:** A wireless speaker system that actively blends its sound output with the ambient audio environment, creating the illusion that sound originates *from* objects within the room, rather than the speaker itself. This moves beyond simple spatial audio; it *becomes* the environment sonically.

**Core Components:**

*   **Multi-Element Speaker Array:** The speaker isn’t a single unit, but a distributed array of miniature, full-range drivers (minimum 64, ideally 256+).  These are physically small – approximately 2cm diameter – and designed for minimal visual impact (e.g., fabric covered, near-invisible mounting options).
*   **Environmental Microphone Array:**  An array of high-sensitivity, directional microphones (minimum 8, ideally 16+) that constantly samples the ambient soundscape. These are spatially separated from the speaker array to minimize acoustic feedback.
*   **Real-time Acoustic Mapping:**  An embedded processor (high-performance ARM or similar) that utilizes the microphone array data to create a real-time 3D acoustic map of the room. This map identifies key sound-reflecting surfaces, obstacles, and existing sound sources.
*   **Wavefield Synthesis Engine:**  The core of the system.  An algorithm that calculates the precise amplitude and timing of each speaker element to synthesize a new wavefield that effectively “masks” the speaker’s direct sound.  Instead, the algorithm creates the illusion that sound originates *from* the mapped objects within the room.  This isn’t just about directionality; it’s about recreating the acoustic *signature* of those objects.
*   **Object-Based Audio Input:** The system accepts audio input as a series of "sound objects" – discrete audio sources with positional data.  This allows for highly flexible sound design and manipulation.
*   **Power & Communication:** Wireless power transfer (Qi or similar) and high-bandwidth, low-latency wireless communication (Wi-Fi 6E or similar) for seamless integration.
*   **Adaptive EQ & Room Correction:** Automatic room analysis and equalization to optimize the sound output for the specific acoustic environment.

**Pseudocode (Wavefield Synthesis Engine - Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Input:  Object-based audio data (position, amplitude, frequency)
//         Real-time 3D acoustic map of the room
// Output:  Signal to each speaker element in the array

function synthesizeWavefield(audioObject, acousticMap):
  for each speakerElement in speakerArray:
    distanceToObject = calculateDistance(speakerElement, audioObject.position)
    timeDelay = distanceToObject / speedOfSound
    amplitudeAttenuation = calculateAttenuation(distanceToObject, acousticMap)
    speakerSignal = audioObject.amplitude * amplitudeAttenuation * delay(audioObject.signal, timeDelay)
    outputSpeakerSignal(speakerElement, speakerSignal)
  end for
end function

function calculateAttenuation(distance, acousticMap):
  // Consider reflections from mapped surfaces
  // Account for absorption characteristics of materials
  // Apply frequency-dependent attenuation
  // Return attenuated amplitude
end function

function delay(signal, time):
  // Implement a digital delay line
  // Return delayed signal
end function
```

**Operational Modes:**

*   **Object Positioning:** The user can assign audio to specific objects within the room using a companion app.  For example, assigning a bird chirp to a houseplant.
*   **Environmental Emulation:** The system can recreate the soundscape of a different environment (e.g., a forest, a beach) by synthesizing sounds that appear to originate from surrounding surfaces.
*   **Immersive Soundstage:** Create a 3D soundstage that surrounds the listener, with sounds appearing to come from all directions.
*   **Stealth Audio:** Minimize the perceived location of the speaker, creating a sense of ambient sound without a clear source.
