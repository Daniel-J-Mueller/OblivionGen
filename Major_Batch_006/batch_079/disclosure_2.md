**Dynamic Content Stitching with Generative Fill**

**Concept:** Expand the annotation capabilities beyond simple overlays (images, stylized text) to actively *modify* the source content itself in a visually seamless way, driven by sentiment analysis and user preference.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** "Content Stitcher" – responsible for analyzing video/audio, identifying key phrases, determining sentiment, and triggering generative fill operations.
*   **Generative Engine Integration:**  Direct API connection to a robust generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3).  Model access must be granular - we need to specify *how* the content is altered.
*   **Sentiment-to-Style Mapping:** A configurable table defining how different sentiment scores translate into stylistic changes.  Examples:
    *   High Positive Sentiment ->  Sparkling particle effects around key objects/people. Increased color saturation.
    *   Negative Sentiment ->  Desaturation.  Introduction of subtle “glitch” effects.  Darker color grading.
    *   Excited Sentiment ->  Fast cuts interspersed with animated transitions. Zoom effects.
*   **Object/Scene Segmentation:** Real-time object and scene segmentation to isolate areas for modification. The segmentation model must be robust to varying lighting conditions and occlusion.
*   **Keyphrase-Driven Prompts:** The identified key phrases are incorporated into prompts sent to the generative AI. For example: “Add a golden halo around [object] because the phrase ‘amazing’ was detected.” Or, "Replace the background with a fantasy landscape because the phrase 'dream come true' was detected."
*   **User Control Layer:** A GUI allowing users to:
    *   Adjust sentiment thresholds.
    *   Customize the style mappings.
    *   Preview changes in real-time.
    *   Manually edit prompts before they are sent to the generative engine.
    *   Select specific regions for generative fill.
*   **Metadata Generation:**  The system generates metadata detailing all generative modifications, including the prompts used, the parameters applied, and a timestamp of when the changes were made.  This is critical for reproducibility and potential reversion.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processContent(contentData, audioData) {
  keyPhrases = extractKeyPhrases(audioData);
  sentiment = analyzeSentiment(keyPhrases);

  styleParameters = getStyleParameters(sentiment);

  segments = segmentContent(contentData);

  for (phrase in keyPhrases) {
    relevantSegments = findSegmentsAssociatedWithPhrase(phrase, segments);

    prompt = generatePrompt(phrase, styleParameters);
    modifiedSegments = generativeFill(relevantSegments, prompt);

    updateContent(contentData, modifiedSegments);
  }
  generateMetadata(contentData);
  return contentData;
}
```

**Novelty:**  Current systems focus on *adding* to content. This system actively *modifies* the content, blending annotation with source material in a way that is potentially more immersive and engaging.  The combination of sentiment analysis driving generative fill opens up a new dimension of dynamic content creation.
