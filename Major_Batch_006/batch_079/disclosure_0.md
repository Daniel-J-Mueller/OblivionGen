## Adaptive Application Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the multi-user session concept to include dynamic application “personas” that adapt the application’s functionality and interface *based on detected user roles or expertise*, not just user preferences. This goes beyond simple preference merging.

**Specifications:**

**1. Role/Expertise Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Data from multiple sources:
    *   User profile data (explicitly declared roles/expertise).
    *   Application usage patterns (implicit role inference – e.g., frequent use of advanced features suggests expertise).
    *   Real-time activity monitoring (e.g., detected actions within the app – drafting, editing, reviewing).
    *   External data sources (linked professional networking sites – LinkedIn, GitHub).
*   **Processing:**  Employ a probabilistic model (Bayesian network or similar) to infer user roles/expertise levels. Confidence scores assigned to each inferred role.
*   **Output:** A vector representing the detected user roles/expertise levels with associated confidence scores.

**2. Persona Definition Library:**

*   Stored data structure defining application “personas.”  Each persona includes:
    *   Feature set activation/deactivation.
    *   Interface layout adjustments (e.g., simplified interface for novice users, advanced panels for experts).
    *   Workflow presets.
    *   Help/tutorial content tailoring.
    *   Default parameter settings for tools.
*   Example Personas: “Novice,” “Intermediate,” “Expert,” “Reviewer,” “Administrator.”
*   Persona Editor: GUI tool for defining and modifying personas. Allows developers and power users to customize application behavior.

**3. Multi-User Persona Adaptation Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Detected user roles/expertise levels (from Role/Expertise Detection Module).
    *   Current active persona (defaults to a base persona).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Determine the “dominant” persona for the multi-user session.  Dominance calculation based on:
        *   Highest confidence score of any detected role.
        *   Number of users sharing the same role.
        *   Predefined role hierarchy (e.g., Administrator overrides all other roles).
    *   Dynamically adjust the application’s feature set, interface, and workflow based on the dominant persona.
    *   Provide mechanisms for users to override the automatic persona adaptation (e.g., “Expert Mode” toggle).
*   **Output:**  Modified application state reflecting the adapted persona.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function adaptPersona(userRoleData):
  dominantRole = determineDominantRole(userRoleData)
  persona = selectPersona(dominantRole)

  activateFeatures(persona.featureSet)
  setLayout(persona.layout)
  setWorkflow(persona.workflow)
  displayHelp(persona.helpContent)

  return applicationState
```

**4. API Extensions:**

*   Add API endpoints for:
    *   Retrieving user role data.
    *   Accessing persona definitions.
    *   Dynamically switching personas.
    *   Registering custom persona definitions.

**5. Multi-User Collaboration Enhancements:**

*   **Role-Based Permissions:**  Within the multi-user session, enforce role-based access control to features and data.
*   **Collaborative Persona Adjustment:**  Allow users with appropriate permissions to collaboratively adjust the active persona during the session.
*   **Persona History:**  Track persona changes during the session for audit and analysis.
