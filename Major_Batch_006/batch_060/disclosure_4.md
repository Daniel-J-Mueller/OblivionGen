**Delegation Profile Chaining & Temporal Scoping**

**Specification:** A system extending the core delegation profile concept to allow for chained delegations and time-bound access, introducing a ‘delegation lineage’ and ‘access expiry’ mechanism.

**Components:**

*   **Delegation Lineage:** Each delegation profile will have an associated lineage graph. This graph tracks the origin of the profile (initial administrator), any subsequent re-delegations, and the security principal at each stage. It uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.
*   **Temporal Scoping:** Each delegation profile (and any re-delegations) will incorporate a defined validity period (start and end date/time).  Beyond this period, access is automatically revoked.
*   **Re-delegation Policies:**  Administrators defining delegation profiles can specify whether re-delegation is permitted, and if so, under what conditions (e.g., only to specific security principals, with reduced permissions, within a shorter timeframe).
*   **Auditing & Provenance:**  A comprehensive audit log will record all delegation events (creation, re-delegation, access attempts, expiry). This log will be cryptographically signed to ensure integrity and non-repudiation.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Delegation:**  An administrator defines a delegation profile with a validity period and re-delegation policy.  The system creates the initial node in the delegation lineage graph.
2.  **Re-delegation Request:** A security principal holding a valid delegation profile requests to re-delegate access to another principal.
3.  **Policy Enforcement:** The system verifies the re-delegation policy associated with the current delegation profile. If re-delegation is allowed, a new node is added to the lineage graph, linked to the originating node. The new node has its own validity period (potentially shorter than the originator).
4.  **Access Control:**  When a security principal attempts to access a resource, the system traverses the delegation lineage graph, starting from the principal, to determine the effective permissions. It considers all the authorization policies associated with each node in the lineage, and the current time to check validity.
5.  **Expiry & Revocation:**  When a delegation profile expires, the system automatically revokes access for all principals downstream in the lineage.

**Pseudocode (Access Check):**

```
function checkAccess(principal, resource, action):
  lineage = getDelegationLineage(principal)
  effectivePermissions = []

  for node in lineage:
    if node.isValid():
      if action in node.authorizationPolicy:
        effectivePermissions.append(node.authorizationPolicy[action])

  if effectivePermissions.contains(action):
    return true
  else:
    return false
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **DelegationProfile:** {profileId, administrator, validityStart, validityEnd, authorizationPolicy, reDelegationPolicy, lineageGraph}
*   **LineageNode:** {profileId, delegatingPrincipal, delegatedPrincipal}

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security through granular access control and time-bound permissions.
*   Improved auditing and accountability through lineage tracking.
*   Increased flexibility in managing delegated access.
*   Facilitates complex authorization scenarios.
