**Adaptive Multi-Spectral Depth Mapping & Projection**

**Core Concept:** Leverage the multi-camera setup described in the provided patent not just for stereoscopic imaging, but for creating a dynamic, high-resolution depth map *and* projecting a light field onto the scene to augment reality.

**Specs:**

*   **Camera Array:**  Expand beyond three cameras. Employ a circular array of 6-8 cameras with varying spectral filters (visible, near-infrared, potentially UV).  Each camera maintains a minimum resolution of 12MP.
*   **Spectral Data Acquisition:**  Each camera captures not only RGB data, but also raw spectral data from its filter. This provides a richer dataset for material identification and improved depth estimation.
*   **Dynamic Depth Map Generation:**  A dedicated processing unit (FPGA or dedicated chip) fuses data from all cameras.  Algorithm utilizes a combination of:
    *   Stereo disparity mapping (as in the base patent).
    *   Spectral analysis – different materials reflect/absorb light differently at various wavelengths.  Algorithm identifies materials and uses this to refine depth estimates (e.g., distinguishing glass from solid objects).
    *   Photometric stereo – capturing images with varying lighting conditions and analyzing shadows to reconstruct surface normals and refine depth.
*   **Light Field Projection System:** Integrate a micro-LED array projector capable of projecting a highly detailed light field. Projector resolution: 8K+.  Projector is physically aligned with the camera array.
*   **Real-time Mapping & Projection:** The system continuously captures scene data, generates a high-resolution depth map, and projects a light field onto the scene. The light field can be used to:
    *   Augment reality – overlay virtual objects seamlessly onto the scene.
    *   Highlight specific objects – draw attention to important features.
    *   Create realistic shadows and reflections – enhance the sense of immersion.
    *   “Sculpt” light – dynamically change the lighting conditions in the scene.
*   **Software/API:**  Provide a comprehensive SDK allowing developers to:
    *   Access the depth map data.
    *   Control the light field projector.
    *   Create custom AR/VR experiences.
    *   Develop new applications for the technology.
*   **Processing Pipeline (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    //Capture images from all cameras concurrently
    FOR EACH camera IN cameraArray:
        captureImage(camera)

    //Generate initial depth map using stereo disparity
    initialDepthMap = generateStereoDepthMap(image1, image2, ...)

    //Refine depth map using spectral analysis
    refinedDepthMap = refineDepthMapWithSpectralData(initialDepthMap, spectralData1, spectralData2, ...)

    //Further refine with Photometric Stereo if available
    IF photometricStereoDataAvailable:
      refinedDepthMap = refineDepthMapWithPhotometricStereo(refinedDepthMap, photometricStereoData)

    //Generate light field based on refined depth map
    lightField = generateLightField(refinedDepthMap, desiredARContent)

    //Project light field onto scene
    projectLightField(lightField)

    //Repeat
    ```
