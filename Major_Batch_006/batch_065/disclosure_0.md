## Adaptive Radar-Acoustic Fusion for Environmental Mapping

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Components:** FMCW Radar Module (integrated with existing sensor â€“ see existing patent), MEMS Microphone Array (minimum 8 elements), Edge Processing Unit (dedicated low-power processor), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).
*   **Radar Parameters:** Operates within existing FMCW bandwidth as defined in patent. Chirp sequence and frequency sweep rate dynamically adjusted based on environmental conditions (determined by processor). Variable range/Doppler resolution.
*   **Acoustic Parameters:** Microphone array sampling rate: 44.1kHz minimum. Beamforming algorithms implemented on edge processor. Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation with < 2-degree accuracy.
*   **IMU Parameters:** 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope. Sample rate: 100Hz minimum. Used for sensor orientation and movement compensation.

**Operational Modes & Logic:**

1.  **Baseline Radar Operation:** System initiates in existing low-power radar modes as described in the parent patent. Performs initial environment scanning.
2.  **Acoustic Triggering:** Edge processor monitors for significant acoustic events (e.g., glass breaking, human speech, vehicle horn) exceeding pre-defined thresholds. Acoustic signature database stored in memory.
3.  **Radar-Acoustic Fusion:** Upon acoustic trigger:
    *   Radar processor adjusts chirp sequence & scan pattern towards estimated acoustic source direction (provided by beamforming algorithm).
    *   Doppler processing focused on acoustic source region.
    *   Radar data correlated with acoustic event characteristics (e.g., frequency, duration, amplitude).
4.  **Environmental Mapping:** System builds a dynamic environmental map using fused radar-acoustic data. Map includes:
    *   Object detection & classification (e.g., people, vehicles, furniture).
    *   Material identification (based on radar reflectivity & acoustic resonance).
    *   Sound source localization.
5.  **Adaptive Power Management:**
    *   Radar power consumption dynamically adjusted based on map density & activity.
    *   Acoustic array enters low-power listening mode when no significant events detected.
    *   System can switch between different radar operational modes (as defined in patent) based on map requirements.

**Pseudocode (Fusion Algorithm):**

```
// Acoustic Event Detection
IF (AcousticArray.detectEvent() > Threshold) {
    AcousticSourceDirection = AcousticArray.getDirectionOfArrival();
    AcousticEventType = AcousticArray.getType();

    //Radar Adjustment
    Radar.setScanDirection(AcousticSourceDirection);
    Radar.setEventType(AcousticEventType);

    //Data Acquisition & Fusion
    RadarData = Radar.getData();
    AcousticData = AcousticArray.getData();

    FusedData = fuseData(RadarData, AcousticData, AcousticEventType);

    //Environmental Map Update
    UpdateMap(FusedData);
}
```

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond simple motion detection to *interpret* the environment through combined radar and acoustic sensing. It isn't just identifying *something* is there, but *what* is there, and potentially *what is happening*. This enables a broader range of applications, including smart security systems (differentiating between a person and a pet), assistive technologies for the visually impaired (providing detailed environmental descriptions), and advanced robotics (enabling more robust navigation and object manipulation).
