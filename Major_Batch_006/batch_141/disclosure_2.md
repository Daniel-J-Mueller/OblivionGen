**Dynamic Commentary Heatmaps & Predictive Purchasing**

**Concept:** Leverage commentary page data (as identified in the patent) not just for listing popular items, but to create dynamically updating “heatmaps” of interest, combined with predictive purchasing suggestions. This moves beyond simple ranking to active, personalized recommendation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Collection Enhancement:** Extend the click-through tracking to capture *dwell time* on commentary pages *before* clicking through to the interactive catalog. This indicates depth of engagement beyond a simple link click. Also collect scroll depth on the commentary page.

2.  **Heatmap Generation:**
    *   Commentary pages are analyzed for frequently mentioned products or product categories.
    *   A visual “heatmap” is generated *over* the commentary page content (displayed as an overlay, potentially on a staging server, or as a data visualization). This heatmap visually highlights which areas/products are receiving the most attention. Use color intensity to represent the level of interest.
    *   The heatmap is dynamically updated based on real-time click-through and dwell time data.

3.  **Predictive Purchasing Engine:**
    *   Based on the heatmap data, and the user's browsing history within the interactive catalog, predict products the user is likely to purchase.
    *   Display these predictions as “Recommended for You” items, prominently featured near the dynamically generated heatmap.

4.  **Commentary Network Graph:**
    *   Construct a network graph linking commentary pages based on shared product mentions. Pages with many shared products are closely linked.
    *   Allow users to “explore” related commentary pages to discover further information and potentially hidden interests.

5.  **Personalized Heatmap Weighting:**
    *   Adjust the heatmap’s weighting based on user demographics, past purchases, and stated preferences.  A user who consistently purchases electronics will see a different heatmap emphasis than a user who primarily buys clothing.

**Pseudocode (Heatmap Generation and Recommendation):**

```
// Data Structures:
CommentaryPage {
  URL: string;
  Content: string;
  ProductsMentioned: list<Product>;
  ClickThroughCount: int;
  AverageDwellTime: float;
}

Product {
  ID: int;
  Name: string;
}

User {
  ID: int;
  PurchaseHistory: list<Product>;
  Demographics: object;
  Preferences: object;
}

// Function: GenerateDynamicHeatmap(CommentaryPage, User)
function GenerateDynamicHeatmap(CommentaryPage, User) {
  // 1. Analyze CommentaryPage content for product mentions.
  products = ExtractProducts(CommentaryPage.Content);

  // 2. Calculate product interest score based on:
  //    - Click-through count from this page.
  //    - Average dwell time on this page.
  //    - User's purchase history (higher weight for relevant products).
  //    - User's stated preferences.
  for each product in products {
    product.InterestScore = CalculateInterestScore(product, CommentaryPage, User);
  }

  // 3. Generate heatmap overlay with color intensity based on InterestScore.
  heatmap = CreateHeatmapOverlay(CommentaryPage.Content, products, InterestScore);
  return heatmap;
}

// Function: RecommendProducts(User, CommentaryPage)
function RecommendProducts(User, CommentaryPage) {
  heatmap = GenerateDynamicHeatmap(CommentaryPage, User);
  topProducts = ExtractTopProductsFromHeatmap(heatmap, N=5); // Recommend top 5 products
  return topProducts;
}

// Main loop:
For each commentary page visited by a user {
  recommendations = RecommendProducts(user, commentaryPage);
  display recommendations near the commentary page.
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Requires robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) to accurately extract product mentions from commentary content.
*   Scalability is critical; the system must handle a large volume of commentary pages and user data.
*   Privacy considerations are paramount; user data should be anonymized and handled securely.
