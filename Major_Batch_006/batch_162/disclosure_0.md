## Modular Propeller Array with Bio-Inspired Flapping Augmentation

**Concept:** Expand beyond coaxially aligned, independently rotating propellers to a modular array incorporating small, rapidly actuating "flapping" elements *integrated* with the propeller blades themselves. This allows for dynamic control of airflow, noise reduction, and increased maneuverability beyond simple RPM/engagement control.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Architecture:** Propeller unit consists of a central hub supporting multiple (6-12) radially extending "propeller modules". Each module comprises a standard propeller blade section *plus* an array of bio-inspired flapping elements.
*   **Flapping Element Design:** Each flapping element is a small, aerodynamically shaped "winglet" (approx. 5-10cm wingspan) constructed from lightweight, high-strength composite material.  Winglets are mounted along the trailing edge of the propeller blade section, spaced approximately 10-15cm apart.
*   **Actuation System:** Each winglet is actuated by a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric or micro-servo). Actuators are embedded *within* the propeller blade structure for protection and weight reduction.  Individual actuator control is critical.
*   **Control System:**  A dedicated microcontroller (integrated within the propeller hub) manages actuator timing and amplitude. Control inputs come from the primary flight controller.
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    1.  **Baseline Control:** Independent control of each propeller module (RPM, engagement).
    2.  **Flapping Pattern Generation:** The microcontroller generates complex flapping patterns for each winglet, based on flight conditions (speed, altitude, direction, turbulence).
    3.  **Airflow Optimization:**  Flapping patterns are dynamically adjusted to:
        *   Reduce tip vortices.
        *   Create localized areas of increased/decreased pressure for lift augmentation/steering.
        *   Modify airflow over the propeller surface for noise reduction.
    4.  **Advanced Maneuvering:**  Asymmetrical flapping patterns enable rapid yaw/pitch/roll control beyond traditional propeller adjustments.
*   **Power Delivery:**  Slip rings and lightweight wiring within the propeller hub provide power to the actuators and microcontroller.
*   **Materials:** Composite materials (carbon fiber, Kevlar) for blades and structural components. Lightweight alloys (titanium, aluminum) for actuators and hubs.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  CAN bus or similar for communication with the flight controller.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Flapping Control Loop):**

```
loop:
    // Read sensor data (airspeed, altitude, attitude) from flight controller
    airspeed = getAirspeed()
    altitude = getAltitude()
    attitude = getAttitude()

    // Calculate desired flapping parameters based on flight conditions
    flappingFrequency = calculateFlappingFrequency(airspeed, altitude)
    flappingAmplitude = calculateFlappingAmplitude(airspeed, altitude, attitude)

    // Apply flapping pattern to each winglet
    for each winglet:
        setActuatorPosition(winglet, calculateActuatorPosition(flappingFrequency, flappingAmplitude, time))

    // Update time
    time += deltaTime
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply controlling propeller *rotation* to actively shaping airflow *around* the propeller blades. The integration of flapping elements offers a new degree of freedom for lift/thrust control, maneuverability, and noise reduction. It isn't merely independent control of propellers, but rather *active airflow manipulation* *at the propeller itself*.
