## Dynamic Stream Partitioning via Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the existing load balancing to *proactively* adjust data stream partition assignments based on predicted consumption patterns, instead of reacting to current load. This moves beyond simply distributing subscriptions and aims to optimize the entire stream data delivery pipeline.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Consumption Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Historical consumption data for each stream partition (bytes/records consumed per time unit) for each subscriber/application.  This data is collected via existing metric collection at the platform level.
    *   Algorithm: Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or a lightweight LSTM).  Train separate models for each stream partition to account for differing patterns.  Consider seasonality, trends, and cyclical behavior.
    *   Output: Predicted consumption rate (bytes/records per time unit) for each stream partition for a defined future time window (e.g., next 5-15 minutes).

2.  **Partition Assignment Controller:**
    *   Input: Predicted consumption rates for all partitions, current partition assignments to platforms, current load on each platform (CPU, memory, network), platform capacity.
    *   Algorithm:  A cost function minimizing overall system latency and maximizing resource utilization. The cost function considers:
        *   Predicted load on each platform if partitions remain assigned as they are.
        *   Cost of migrating partitions (network bandwidth, processing time, potential disruption to subscribers).
        *   Platform capacity constraints.
        *   A ‘smoothness’ factor – penalizing frequent partition migrations.
    *   Output:  A proposed new partition assignment map.

3.  **Migration Orchestrator:**
    *   Input: Proposed partition assignment map, current assignment map.
    *   Process:
        *   Identify partitions that require migration.
        *   Initiate a phased migration process:
            *   New subscriptions to the migrating partition are directed to the new target platform.
            *   Existing subscribers are gracefully migrated via a short-lived dual-delivery period (new platform + old platform) to ensure zero data loss.
            *   Once all subscribers are migrated, the partition is removed from the old platform.
    *   Output: Confirmation of partition migration completion.

**Pseudocode (Partition Assignment Controller):**

```
FUNCTION calculate_cost(current_assignment, predicted_loads, platform_capacities)
  total_cost = 0
  FOR platform IN platforms
    predicted_load = sum(predicted_loads for partition IN partitions assigned to platform)
    IF predicted_load > platform_capacities[platform]
      total_cost += (predicted_load - platform_capacities[platform]) * penalty_factor
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  RETURN total_cost
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION optimize_partition_assignment(current_assignment, predicted_loads, platform_capacities)
  best_assignment = current_assignment
  min_cost = calculate_cost(current_assignment, predicted_loads, platform_capacities)

  FOR possible_assignment IN generate_all_possible_assignments(partitions, platforms)
    cost = calculate_cost(possible_assignment, predicted_loads, platform_capacities)
    IF cost < min_cost
      min_cost = cost
      best_assignment = possible_assignment
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  RETURN best_assignment
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Integration Points:**

*   Existing metric collection framework.
*   Load balancer API.
*   Persistent connection management.
*   Subscription management API.
