## Adaptive Notification Prioritization with Predictive Queueing

**Concept:** Enhance the delivery guarantee system by introducing adaptive prioritization and predictive queueing based on subscriber behavior and data source volatility. Instead of a uniform queueing system, dynamically adjust notification priority and pre-queue notifications based on predicted subscriber responsiveness and the likelihood of data source changes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Subscriber Behavior Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Track subscriber interaction with notifications (open rate, response time, acknowledgements). Collect data on device type, network connectivity, and historical responsiveness.
*   **Profile Creation:** Generate a subscriber profile score based on collected data. Higher scores indicate more responsive/reliable subscribers. Categorize subscribers into tiers (e.g., High, Medium, Low) based on their profile score.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update subscriber profiles based on recent behavior. Implement a decay function to reduce the impact of historical data.

**2. Data Source Volatility Monitoring Module:**

*   **Change Rate Calculation:** Monitor the rate of data changes for each monitored data source (e.g., mutations per second).
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Employ a time series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to predict future data change rates.
*   **Volatility Score:** Assign a volatility score to each data source based on predicted change rates. Higher scores indicate more volatile data sources.

**3. Adaptive Queueing System:**

*   **Priority Assignment:** When a notification request is received, calculate a priority score based on the subscriber’s profile score and the data source’s volatility score.
    *   `Priority = SubscriberProfileScore * DataSourceVolatilityScore * WeightingFactor` (WeightingFactor allows for tuning the relative importance of each factor).
*   **Multi-Tier Queueing:** Implement multiple queues with varying priority levels. Assign each notification request to the appropriate queue based on its priority score.
*   **Pre-Queueing:** For high-priority notifications, pre-queue the notification request in the appropriate queue *before* the data source change is fully processed. This reduces latency and improves responsiveness.
*   **Dynamic Queue Adjustment:** Continuously monitor queue lengths and dynamically adjust the number of threads/resources allocated to each queue based on real-time load.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor notification delivery success rates and adjust the priority assignment algorithm and queue allocation parameters to optimize performance.

**4. Pseudocode – Priority Assignment & Queueing:**

```pseudocode
// Receive notification request
request = ReceiveNotificationRequest()

// Get subscriber profile score
subscriberProfileScore = GetSubscriberProfileScore(request.subscriberID)

// Get data source volatility score
dataSourceVolatilityScore = GetDataSourceVolatilityScore(request.dataSourceID)

// Calculate priority score
priorityScore = subscriberProfileScore * dataSourceVolatilityScore * WeightingFactor

// Determine queue based on priority score
IF priorityScore > HighThreshold THEN
    queue = HighPriorityQueue
ELSIF priorityScore > MediumThreshold THEN
    queue = MediumPriorityQueue
ELSE
    queue = LowPriorityQueue
ENDIF

// Add request to queue
AddNotificationRequestToQueue(queue, request)

// Thread pool allocates resources to queues based on queue length.
```

**5. System Components & Interactions:**

*   **Subscriber Behavior Profiling Module:** Runs as a separate microservice, collecting and analyzing subscriber data.
*   **Data Source Volatility Monitoring Module:** Runs as a separate microservice, monitoring data source change rates and predicting future volatility.
*   **Adaptive Queueing System:** Integrated into the existing publishing service.
*   **Communication:** Microservices communicate via asynchronous messaging (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Latency:** Pre-queueing and prioritized delivery reduce latency for high-priority notifications.
*   **Improved Responsiveness:** Focus resources on responsive subscribers and volatile data sources.
*   **Increased Scalability:** Dynamic queue adjustment and resource allocation improve scalability.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** Faster and more reliable notifications improve the user experience.
