## Dynamic Core Mapping & Signal Reconfiguration System

**Concept:** Expand beyond static fan-out to a system allowing dynamic re-mapping of individual cores within multicore fibers to different output ribbons/single cores. This creates a configurable optical switch fabric within the transition portion.

**Specs:**

**1. Transition Portion - Core Mapping Module (CMM):**

*   **Architecture:** Micro-Optical Mechanical System (MOMS) based. An array of miniature, computer-controlled mirrors or prisms.
*   **Core Resolution:**  Capable of individual core addressing within the multicore fiber (resolution limited by core diameter, aiming for <1Âµm precision).
*   **Input:** Accepts multicore fiber ribbon (as per existing patent) or individual multicore fibers.
*   **Output:** Connects to an array of individual single-mode fibers, configurable via software.
*   **Control:** A dedicated microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M series) with a communication interface (SPI/I2C) for external control.
*   **Power:** Low-power operation (target < 5W) for minimal heat dissipation.
*   **Housing:** A rigid, environmentally sealed enclosure to protect the MOMS and electronics.

**2. Control Software & API:**

*   **Interface:** REST API for external control via network connection (Ethernet/WiFi).
*   **Mapping Table:**  Software defines a mapping table: *Input Core -> Output Fiber*. This table is dynamically updated.
*   **Monitoring:**  Real-time monitoring of optical power levels on input and output fibers to detect failures or signal degradation.
*   **Self-Calibration:**  Automated calibration routine to compensate for drift or misalignment of the MOMS.
*   **Pre-programmed Profiles:**  Ability to store and recall pre-defined mapping profiles for common applications.
*   **User Interface:** Web-based GUI for configuration, monitoring, and control.

**3. Ribbon/Fiber Interface:**

*   **Modular Design:**  Accepts a variety of ribbon/fiber connector types (LC, SC, MPO) via interchangeable adapter plates.
*   **High-Density Connectors:** Utilize MPO/MTP connectors for maximum fiber density.
*   **Polarization Management:**  Built-in polarization controllers to maintain signal integrity.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Mapping Update):**

```
function update_core_mapping(mapping_table) {
  for each (input_core, output_fiber) in mapping_table {
    activate_mirror(input_core); // Position mirror to direct light from input core
    connect_mirror_output_to(output_fiber); // Establish optical path
  }
}

function read_optical_power(fiber) {
  // Measure optical power on the given fiber
  return power_level;
}

function calibrate_system() {
  // Run automated calibration routine
  // Adjust mirror positions for optimal alignment
  // Update calibration data
}
```

**Operational Modes:**

*   **Static Mapping:**  Pre-defined core mapping for fixed applications.
*   **Dynamic Mapping:**  Real-time adjustment of core mapping based on external signals or application requirements.
*   **Failover Mode:**  Automatic re-routing of signals in case of fiber failure.
*   **Load Balancing:**  Distribution of traffic across multiple fibers to optimize bandwidth utilization.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Optical Switching:**  Create a flexible optical switch fabric for data centers and telecommunications networks.
*   **Coherent Optical Communication:**  Dynamically map cores to different polarization channels for improved spectral efficiency.
*   **Optical Sensing:**  Reconfigure core mapping for multi-point sensing applications.
*   **Advanced Microscopy:**  Dynamically switch between different imaging channels.
