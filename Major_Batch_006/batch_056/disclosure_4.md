**Dynamic Modulo Selection Network**

**Concept:** Extend the multiplexer-based modulo selection to a network capable of dynamically adjusting the selection criteria based on data dependencies *within* the checksum calculation itself. Instead of a fixed selection based solely on higher-order bits, the network would consider the carry-out values from preceding adders in the chain to refine the modulo choice. This enables a more adaptive and potentially more efficient modulo reduction.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Dependency Unit (DDU):** A small processing unit integrated after each adder in the chain.  The DDU receives the carry-out signal from the adder, along with a portion of the adder's output. It computes a 'dependency score' – a value representing how much the current adder’s carry impacts the optimal modulo selection for subsequent stages. This score could be as simple as a weighted sum of carry-out bits or a lookup table-based value.

2.  **Dynamic Selection Network (DSN):** Replaces the static multiplexer structure. The DSN consists of:
    *   A series of smaller multiplexers arranged in a tree-like structure.
    *   Weighting units associated with each multiplexer input.  Weights are determined by the DDU's dependency score.
    *   A summation unit to combine the weighted multiplexer outputs.

3.  **Modulo Bank:** A memory bank holding pre-calculated modulo values for various integer multiples of the target modulo (e.g. 65,521).  The DSN selects the most appropriate value from this bank.

4.  **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    For each adder in the checksum chain:
        // Calculate Dependency Score
        dependency_score = DDU(adder_carry, adder_output)

        // Determine Weights for Multiplexer Inputs
        weights = calculate_weights(dependency_score)

        // Select Modulo Value
        modulo_value = DSN(weights, modulo_bank)

        // Add Modulo Value to Adder Output
        intermediate_value = adder_output + modulo_value

        // Pass intermediate_value to next adder
    ```

5. **Hardware Components**

*   DDU: A small combinatorial logic block (or a simple lookup table)
*   DSN:  Multiple 2:1 or 4:1 multiplexers, and adders for weighting.
*   Modulo Bank:  SRAM or ROM. Size depends on the granularity of pre-calculated modulo values.

6.  **Optimization:** The granularity of the modulo bank (i.e., the range of integer multiples stored) can be adjusted to trade off storage space and calculation accuracy. A coarser granularity requires fewer storage resources but may introduce minor errors, which can be corrected by a final adjustment stage.
