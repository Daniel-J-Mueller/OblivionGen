## Haptic Directional Feedback Ring

**Concept:** A wearable ring incorporating micro-actuators to provide localized haptic feedback, dynamically shifting in intensity and position to indicate the approximate direction of a sound source – specifically, to augment the visual light cues described in the provided patent. This creates a multi-sensory system for identifying speech origin, useful for crowded environments or visually impaired users.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Ring, adjustable to fit various finger sizes. Constructed from lightweight, biocompatible material (e.g., titanium alloy, reinforced polymer).
*   **Actuators:** Array of miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or piezoelectric actuators embedded within the ring’s band. Minimum of 8 actuators, evenly spaced around the circumference.
*   **Microphone Array:** Integrated miniature microphone array (minimum of 3 microphones) positioned on the ring’s body to capture ambient sound.
*   **Processing Unit:** Low-power microcontroller (e.g., ARM Cortex-M4) integrated within the ring. Responsible for signal processing, actuator control, and wireless communication.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication with a host device (e.g., smartphone, voice assistant device).
*   **Power Source:** Rechargeable solid-state battery integrated within the ring. Estimated battery life: 8 hours continuous use. Wireless charging enabled.
*   **Sensors:** Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer and gyroscope – to determine ring orientation and movement.
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:**
    1.  Receive audio input from the integrated microphone array.
    2.  Perform Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) calculations to estimate the direction of the dominant sound source (speech).
    3.  Map the estimated direction to a specific actuator or set of actuators on the ring. The actuator closest to the estimated direction will have the highest intensity.
    4.  Adjust actuator intensity based on sound source distance (estimated from sound amplitude).
    5.  Continuously update the haptic feedback based on changes in sound source direction and amplitude.
    6.   Utilize IMU data to compensate for ring orientation and movement.
*   **Software Interface:** Mobile app for configuration and customization. Allows users to adjust haptic intensity, customize feedback patterns, and integrate with voice assistant devices.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Capture Audio
  audioData = captureAudio();

  // Estimate Direction
  direction = estimateSoundDirection(audioData);

  // Calculate Actuator Intensity
  intensity = calculateIntensity(audioData);

  // Map Direction to Actuators
  actuators = mapDirectionToActuators(direction);

  // Control Actuators
  for each actuator in actuators {
    setActuatorIntensity(actuator, intensity);
  }

  // Delay
  delay(10ms);
}
```

**Integration with Patent:**

The ring's haptic feedback is intended to *complement* the visual light cues from the voice-controlled device. The system could be programmed to:

*   Activate the ring’s haptic feedback *simultaneously* with the illumination of the corresponding light on the device.
*   Use the intensity of the haptic feedback to indicate the distance of the sound source.
*   Allow users to prioritize either visual or haptic feedback.

**Future Considerations:**

*   Integration with bone conduction headphones to provide directional audio cues.
*   Use of machine learning to personalize haptic feedback patterns based on user preferences and environmental conditions.
*   Development of a multi-user system where each user has their own unique haptic profile.
