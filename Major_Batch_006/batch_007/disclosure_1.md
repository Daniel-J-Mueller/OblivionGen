## Adaptive Data Resonance System

**Concept:** Extend the idea of obfuscating sensitive information *before* it hits a database to encompass a dynamic "resonance" system. Instead of simply encrypting/tokenizing, the system analyzes the dataâ€™s *context* within the application and generates a transformation based on real-time risk assessment. This goes beyond static policies.

**Specs:**

**1. Resonance Engine Core:**

*   **Input:** Raw data object (any type). Application context metadata (user role, access timestamp, originating service, data classification tags). Real-time threat intelligence feed (e.g., known data breach patterns, anomalous access attempts).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Contextual Analysis:**  Analyze the application context. Is this data being accessed during a sensitive operation (e.g., financial transaction, PII update)? What is the user's permission level?
    *   **Risk Scoring:** Calculate a risk score based on contextual analysis and threat intelligence.  The score represents the probability of a data breach or misuse.
    *   **Transformation Selection:**  Based on the risk score, select a transformation algorithm from a library.  Algorithms include:
        *   **Static Encryption:** Standard AES/RSA encryption.
        *   **Tokenization:**  Replace data with a non-sensitive token.
        *   **Differential Privacy:** Add noise to the data to protect individual privacy.
        *   **Homomorphic Encryption:**  Encrypt data in a way that allows computations to be performed on it without decrypting it.
        *   **Data Masking:** Partially redact or obscure sensitive data (e.g., credit card number).
        *   **Contextual Shuffling:** Reorder data elements in a way that preserves utility but obscures meaning.
    *   **Transformation Application:** Apply the selected transformation algorithm to the data.
*   **Output:** Transformed data object. Transformation metadata (algorithm used, parameters, timestamp).

**2.  Dynamic Policy Adaptation Module:**

*   **Policy Engine:** Stores and manages data transformation policies.  Policies define risk thresholds, transformation algorithms, and parameters.
*   **Real-time Learning:** Continuously monitor data access patterns and security events.  Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) to adjust policies in real-time.
*   **Automated Policy Creation:**  Automatically generate new policies based on emerging threats and application requirements.

**3.  Resonance Registry:**

*   **Metadata Storage:** Stores metadata about all transformed data objects, including the original data hash, transformation metadata, and access logs.
*   **Auditability:** Enables auditing of data access and transformation history.
*   **Data Lineage:** Tracks the lineage of data throughout the system.

**Pseudocode (Resonance Engine Core):**

```pseudocode
function transformData(data, context, threatIntel):
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(context, threatIntel)

  if riskScore > highThreshold:
    transformationAlgorithm = selectAlgorithm(riskScore, "homomorphicEncryption")
  else if riskScore > mediumThreshold:
    transformationAlgorithm = selectAlgorithm(riskScore, "differentialPrivacy")
  else:
    transformationAlgorithm = selectAlgorithm(riskScore, "tokenization")

  transformedData = applyTransformation(data, transformationAlgorithm)

  return transformedData
```

**Novelty:** 

This goes beyond simple obfuscation by introducing *adaptive* transformations based on real-time risk assessment and learning. The "resonance" aspect refers to the data "resonating" with its environment and adapting its protection level accordingly.  It's not just *what* is protected, but *how* it's protected, dynamically adjusted.
