## Dynamic Graph Partitioning for Neural Network Acceleration

**Concept:** Extend the fast context switching concept to support *multiple* simultaneously active neural networks, each represented as a directed weighted graph, by dynamically partitioning the memory and processing engine array to accommodate these graphs. This isn't about switching *between* networks, but about running segments of *several* networks concurrently.

**Specifications:**

**1. Memory Architecture:**

*   **Granularity:** Memory is divided into fine-grained “graph partitions.” Each partition can hold a subset of nodes and edges (weights) from *any* neural network.
*   **Dynamic Allocation:**  A memory management unit (MMU) monitors processing engine demands and dynamically allocates graph partitions based on node activation frequency. Hot nodes/edges reside in partitions closer to the processing engines.
*   **Partition Metadata:** Each partition stores metadata: network ID, node ID(s) contained, edge ID(s) contained, and a “valid” flag indicating if the data is actively used.
*   **Sparse Representation:** Employ a sparse matrix/graph representation to minimize memory footprint.
*   **Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) Awareness:** The MMU must consider NUMA effects when allocating partitions to minimize latency.

**2. Processing Engine Array:**

*   **Distributed Computation:** The processing engine array is logically divided into “compute clusters.” Each cluster is responsible for a specific set of nodes within *multiple* networks.
*   **Inter-Cluster Communication:** A high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect facilitates data exchange between compute clusters.
*   **Node Ownership:** Each compute cluster “owns” a set of nodes, regardless of which network they belong to. Node ownership can shift dynamically based on workload.
*   **Dataflow Scheduling:** Implement a dataflow scheduling algorithm that prioritizes node activation and minimizes data movement.

**3. Software/Firmware:**

*   **Graph Compiler:** A graph compiler analyzes the neural network graphs and generates a partitioning plan. This plan maps nodes and edges to graph partitions.
*   **Runtime System:** A runtime system manages the allocation of graph partitions, data transfer, and node execution.
*   **Node Activation Manager:**  A node activation manager monitors node activation frequencies and dynamically adjusts the partitioning plan.
*   **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** A HAL provides a standardized interface for accessing the memory and processing engine array.

**Pseudocode (Runtime System - Node Execution):**

```
function executeNode(nodeID):
  // Get the network ID associated with the node
  networkID = getNodeNetworkID(nodeID)

  // Determine the graph partition containing the node
  partitionID = findPartitionForNode(nodeID)

  // Load the node's weights and inputs from the partition
  weights = loadWeights(partitionID, nodeID)
  inputs = loadInputs(partitionID, nodeID)

  // Compute the node's output
  output = compute(inputs, weights)

  // Store the output in the appropriate partition
  storeOutput(partitionID, nodeID, output)

  // Signal dependent nodes
  signalDependentNodes(nodeID)
```

**Innovation/Novelty:**

This differs from the original patent by moving away from strict context switching. It creates a more fluid and granular system where segments of multiple neural networks can be actively computed concurrently, maximizing hardware utilization. It's a shift from *sequential* context switching to *parallel* graph execution. This requires a much more complex memory management and scheduling system, but it has the potential to significantly improve performance for complex, multi-network applications.
