## Dynamic Neighborhood Watch Network

**Concept:** Expand the sharing functionality to create a dynamic, localized neighborhood watch network with tiered access and reputation scoring.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Core:** Maintain the existing A/V device integration and sharing signal transmission.
*   **Neighborhood Zones:** Implement geographically defined "Neighborhood Zones." Users define their Zone upon initial application setup (based on address, GPS, or manual boundary definition).
*   **Tiered Access Control:** Within each Neighborhood Zone, introduce three access tiers:
    *   **Owner/Admin:** Full control – can invite, approve members, manage Zone settings, escalate alerts to authorities.
    *   **Verified Member:**  Confirmed resident of the Zone. Can view shared footage, comment on events, contribute to alerts. Verification can be achieved through address confirmation (utility bill scan), social media connection (to other verified members), or physical attestation by an Owner/Admin.
    *   **Observer:** Temporary access granted by Owner/Admin or Verified Members. Limited viewing permissions, no commenting or alert contribution. Primarily for visitors or temporary residents.
*   **Reputation Scoring:**  Implement a reputation system based on user contributions and validation:
    *   **Positive Actions:** Accurate event reporting, constructive commentary, confirming/validating other user's reports.
    *   **Negative Actions:** False reports, disruptive behavior, malicious commentary.
    *   Reputation impacts access privileges – lower reputation reduces visibility of posts, higher reputation unlocks advanced features (e.g., direct alert escalation to authorities).

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Mobile Application:**
    *   **Zone Management:**  Ability to define/join Neighborhood Zones, manage member access, configure alert settings.
    *   **Footage Feed:**  Displays shared footage from A/V devices within the user's Zone, sorted by time, location, or user reputation.
    *   **Event Reporting:** Users can tag footage with descriptions, categories (e.g., "suspicious person," "package theft," "traffic incident"), and severity levels.
    *   **Alert Escalation:**  Option to report events to local authorities directly through the application (integrated with existing 911 systems, if possible).
    *   **Reputation Profile:** Displays the user’s reputation score and contribution history.
*   **Server-Side Logic:**
    *   **Geofencing:** Implements geographical boundaries for Neighborhood Zones.
    *   **Access Control:** Manages user access privileges based on tier and reputation.
    *   **Reputation Calculation:**  Calculates and updates user reputation scores based on actions and feedback.
    *   **Alert Aggregation:** Aggregates and prioritizes alerts based on severity, frequency, and user validation.

**3.  Pseudocode for Alert Escalation:**

```
FUNCTION escalateAlert(footageID, description, severity)

  // Get user's reputation score
  userReputation = getUserReputation(userID)

  // Calculate alert priority based on severity and reputation
  alertPriority = severity * userReputation

  // If priority exceeds threshold:
  IF alertPriority > threshold THEN

    // Send alert to local authorities (integrated with 911 system)
    sendToAuthorities(footageID, description, location, userID)

    // Notify zone members
    notifyZoneMembers(footageID, description)

  ENDIF

ENDFUNCTION
```

**4.  Novelty:**

This diverges from the original patent by focusing on *community building* and *localized intelligence*. It goes beyond simple sharing to create a self-regulating, dynamic network where community members are incentivized to contribute to neighborhood safety. The reputation system and tiered access control add layers of trust and accountability that are missing from the original concept.
