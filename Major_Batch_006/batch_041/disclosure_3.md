## Dynamic Character Relationship Visualization & Narrative Branching

**Concept:** Extend character-based presentation beyond simple voice/visual distinction to a dynamic, interactive relationship map influencing narrative presentation.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** ‘Relational Engine’ - A module analyzing text for character interactions, sentiment, and frequency. This builds a ‘Relationship Web’ – a graph database representing character connections (positive, negative, neutral, complex).
*   **Visualization Layer:**
    *   'Web View': A visually accessible graph, presented alongside the text, dynamically updating as the user reads. Node size represents character prominence. Link thickness & color indicate relationship strength/type.
    *   Interactive Elements: Users can click nodes to access character profiles (as in the original patent), but also ‘zoom’ into specific relationships, highlighting relevant text passages.
*   **Narrative Branching:**
    *   Relationship Thresholds: Define thresholds for relationship strength. Reaching a threshold unlocks alternative narrative segments. (e.g., strong positive relationship unlocks a 'cooperation' scene; strong negative unlocks a 'conflict' scene.)
    *   Branching Logic: A rule-based system governing narrative segment selection based on the Relationship Web. Segments are stored as modular text/audio/visual components.
*   **User Customization:**
    *   ‘Influence’ Mode: Users can 'invest' in relationships (spend in-app currency or points) to *force* specific narrative branches, creating personalized story outcomes.
    *   Relationship Focus: Users can ‘pin’ specific relationships, causing the Web View to prioritize those connections and the narrative to focus on events involving those characters.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Character Profiles: Store attributes beyond those in the original patent – ‘motivations’, ‘secrets’, ‘moral alignment’.
    *   Relationship Data:  Track relationship strength, type, and historical events (significant interactions).
    *   Narrative Segment Database: Modular, tagged segments of text, audio, and visual content.

**Pseudocode (Branching Logic):**

```
FUNCTION select_narrative_segment(character_a, character_b):
  relationship_strength = get_relationship_strength(character_a, character_b)
  relationship_type = get_relationship_type(character_a, character_b)

  IF relationship_strength > threshold_high AND relationship_type == "positive":
    RETURN segment_cooperation_high
  ELSE IF relationship_strength > threshold_medium AND relationship_type == "positive":
    RETURN segment_cooperation_medium
  ELSE IF relationship_strength < threshold_low AND relationship_type == "negative":
    RETURN segment_conflict_high
  ELSE:
    RETURN segment_default
```

**Engineering Notes:**

*   Requires sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) for relationship extraction and sentiment analysis.
*   Modular narrative segment design is crucial for scalability and customization.
*   User interface must be intuitive and non-intrusive – the Relationship Web shouldn’t overshadow the story.
*   Consider integration with AI-generated content to dynamically create new narrative segments based on user choices and relationship dynamics.
