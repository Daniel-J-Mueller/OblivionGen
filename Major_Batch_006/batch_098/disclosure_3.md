## Adaptive Granularity Metric Streaming & Predictive Alerting

**Concept:** Extend the existing metric aggregation pipeline to support *dynamic* aggregation granularity, combined with predictive alerting based on historical trends and anomaly detection *within* each granularity level. The goal is to allow clients to request metrics at varying levels of detail (e.g., average CPU usage per hour, per minute, per second) and receive proactive alerts *before* issues escalate, customized to the specific granularity they're observing.

**Specifications:**

**1. Granularity Profiles:**

*   **Data Structure:** `GranularityProfile` = {`name`: string, `interval`: duration, `resolution`: enum(raw, aggregated), `historyRetention`: duration, `alertingRules`: list of `AlertingRule`}.
*   `resolution`:  Specifies if data at this level is raw (directly from logs) or aggregated from a lower level.
*   `historyRetention`: Defines how long data at this granularity is stored.
*   `alertingRules`: Defines rules for triggering alerts at this level.

**2. Dynamic Aggregation Layer:**

*   **Component:** `GranularityManager`.  Responsible for creating and managing aggregation pipelines based on requested `GranularityProfile`s.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   `createPipeline(GranularityProfile profile)`:  Instantiates an aggregation pipeline tailored to the profile.  This pipeline consists of multiple `AggregationStage`s.
    *   `AggregationStage`:  A modular component that performs aggregation within a specific time window.  Supports various aggregation functions (average, sum, count, min, max, percentile).
    *   Pipelines are dynamically reconfigurable. Clients can request changes to granularity profiles (e.g., increase resolution) without restarting the entire system.
*   **Data Flow:** Logs -> `IngestionLayer` -> `GranularityManager` -> Dynamic Aggregation Pipelines -> `StorageLayer`

**3. Predictive Alerting Engine:**

*   **Component:** `AlertingEngine`. Operates *within* each `AggregationStage` and utilizes time series forecasting models.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   `trainModel(timeSeriesData)`: Trains a forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM) on historical data.
    *   `predictNextValue(currentValue, historicalData)`:  Predicts the next value in the time series.
    *   `detectAnomaly(predictedValue, actualValue)`:  Compares the predicted value to the actual value.  If the difference exceeds a threshold, an anomaly is detected.
    *   `AlertingRule`:  Defines the conditions for triggering alerts.  Includes anomaly thresholds, severity levels, and notification channels.
*   **Data Flow:** Aggregated Metrics -> `AlertingEngine` -> Anomaly Detection -> Alert Trigger -> Notification Service

**4. Storage Layer:**

*   Multi-tiered storage:
    *   Low-latency memory (e.g., Redis) for recent aggregated metrics.
    *   Durable storage (e.g., Cassandra, S3) for historical data.
*   Data partitioning based on granularity level and time range.

**Pseudocode â€“ `AlertingEngine` anomaly detection:**

```
function detectAnomaly(actualValue, predictedValue, threshold):
  difference = abs(actualValue - predictedValue)
  if difference > threshold:
    severity = calculateSeverity(difference)
    triggerAlert(severity, actualValue, predictedValue)
    return true
  return false

function calculateSeverity(difference):
  // Logic to determine alert severity based on the magnitude of the difference.
  // Could use a linear scale, exponential scale, or a more complex model.
  severity = map(difference, 0, maxDifference, 1, 5) // Example: map difference to a severity level (1-5)
  return severity

function triggerAlert(severity, actualValue, predictedValue):
  // Send an alert notification to the appropriate channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).
  // Include relevant information (e.g., metric name, actual value, predicted value, severity).
  sendNotification(metricName, actualValue, predictedValue, severity)

```

**Innovation:** This system allows clients to proactively monitor metrics at various levels of granularity *and* receive alerts before issues escalate. The dynamic aggregation and predictive alerting capabilities provide a more comprehensive and responsive monitoring solution.  Clients can 'zoom in' on specific metrics without incurring performance penalties, and the system can anticipate and alert on potential problems *before* they impact users.
