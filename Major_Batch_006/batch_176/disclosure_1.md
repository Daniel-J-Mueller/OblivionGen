## Dynamic Query Expansion via User-Specific Knowledge Graphs

**Concept:** Leverage user-specific knowledge graphs to dynamically expand search queries *before* they are processed by the semantic search system described in the patent. This moves the query refinement step from a pre-trained model acting on general data to a personalized, context-aware expansion tailored to the individual user's interests and established knowledge.

**Specs:**

*   **User Knowledge Graph Construction:**
    *   Data Sources: Integrate data from various sources – user search history, browsing activity, social media interactions, explicitly stated preferences (e.g., liked items, saved articles), purchased items, and potentially even wearable sensor data (e.g., location, activity).
    *   Graph Structure: Represent user interests as nodes in a knowledge graph.  Nodes represent entities (e.g., “Jazz Music,” “Hiking,” “Italian Cuisine”) and concepts.  Edges represent relationships between entities (e.g., “Jazz Music” *is a type of* “Music,” “Hiking” *requires* “Hiking Boots”).  Edge weights reflect the strength of the relationship based on user activity frequency and recency.
    *   Continuous Update: The knowledge graph is continuously updated in real-time or near-real-time based on user interactions.

*   **Query Analysis & Expansion:**
    1.  **Initial Query Parsing:** The user's search query is parsed to identify key entities and concepts.
    2.  **Knowledge Graph Traversal:** A graph traversal algorithm (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Personalized PageRank) is initiated from the entities identified in the query. Traversal is constrained by a configurable depth and/or number of nodes.
    3.  **Expansion Term Selection:**  Nodes encountered during the traversal are evaluated as potential expansion terms. Selection criteria:
        *   **Relevance Score:** Calculated based on the path length from the query entity to the expansion term, edge weights, and node centrality.
        *   **Diversity Score:**  Penalize expansion terms that are semantically too similar to existing terms in the query or expansion set. This ensures a broader search.
        *   **User Preference Weighting:** Boost the relevance score of expansion terms that align with the user's most prominent interests within the knowledge graph.
    4.  **Query Rewriting:** The original query is rewritten by adding the selected expansion terms as synonyms or related keywords.

*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    1.  The rewritten query is then passed to the semantic search system described in the patent, which generates semantically-related search queries and indexes documents accordingly.
    2.  The system may optionally track the performance of different expansion terms (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate) and use this data to refine the expansion process over time.

**Pseudocode (Query Expansion Module):**

```
function expandQuery(user_id, query):
  user_knowledge_graph = loadKnowledgeGraph(user_id)
  query_entities = extractEntities(query)
  expansion_candidates = []
  for entity in query_entities:
    neighbors = user_knowledge_graph.getNeighbors(entity)
    for neighbor in neighbors:
      relevance_score = calculateRelevanceScore(entity, neighbor, user_knowledge_graph)
      diversity_score = calculateDiversityScore(neighbor, expansion_candidates)
      candidate = (neighbor, relevance_score * diversity_score)
      expansion_candidates.append(candidate)
  expansion_candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  selected_terms = [term for term, score in expansion_candidates[:5]] # Select top 5 terms
  rewritten_query = query + " OR (" + " OR ".join(selected_terms) + ")"
  return rewritten_query
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Search Relevance:** By incorporating user-specific knowledge, the system can generate more relevant search results.
*   **Personalized Search Experience:**  The system adapts to individual user interests and provides a more tailored search experience.
*   **Discovery of New Information:** The expansion process can expose users to information they might not have found otherwise.
*   **Increased User Engagement:** More relevant and personalized search results can lead to increased user engagement and satisfaction.
