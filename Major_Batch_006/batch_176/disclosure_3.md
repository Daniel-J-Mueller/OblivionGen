## Dynamic Policy Element Weighting & Adaptive Enforcement

**Concept:** Extend the existing normal form policy system with a dynamic weighting system for policy elements. This allows for nuanced enforcement based on context and evolving risk profiles, going beyond simple boolean evaluations.

**Specification:**

**1. Weighted Policy Elements:**

*   Each policy element (actor, action, subject, condition) receives a weight value (floating-point number).  Default weight is 1.0.
*   Weights are configurable by administrators (and potentially, through machine learning - see section 4).
*   Weights represent the importance of that element in the overall policy decision. Higher weight = more critical.

**2.  Policy Evaluation Score:**

*   Existing policy evaluation logic remains – checking if a request matches policy element criteria.
*   Introduce a "Policy Evaluation Score" calculation.
*   For each matching policy element, the element's weight is added to the score.
*   For non-matching elements, a penalty (configurable, default 0.5) is subtracted from the score.
*   Total Policy Evaluation Score = Σ (Weight_i for matching elements) - Σ (Penalty for non-matching elements).

**3. Adaptive Thresholds:**

*   Instead of simple "allow/deny" decisions, policies have configurable "thresholds".
*   A request is allowed only if its Policy Evaluation Score exceeds the threshold.
*   Different policies can have different thresholds, enabling fine-grained control.
*   Thresholds can be adjusted dynamically based on risk assessments or system load.

**4. Machine Learning Integration:**

*   Collect data on request attributes, Policy Evaluation Scores, and enforcement outcomes.
*   Train a machine learning model to predict optimal weights and thresholds.
*   The model learns from historical data to maximize security and minimize false positives/negatives.
*   The model can be retrained periodically or triggered by significant changes in system behavior.

**5. Policy Element Contextualization:**

*   Extend policy elements with "context keys".  These keys identify relevant contextual data (e.g., time of day, user location, device type).
*   Contextual data is used to dynamically adjust policy element weights.
*   Example: Actor weight increases during peak hours; Subject weight increases for sensitive data.

**Pseudocode (Policy Evaluation):**

```
function evaluateRequest(request, policy):
  score = 0
  for element in policy.elements:
    if request.matchesElement(element):
      score += element.weight * getContextMultiplier(element.contextKey)
    else:
      score -= penalty
  if score > policy.threshold:
    return ALLOW
  else:
    return DENY
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PolicyElement`: `name`, `value`, `weight`, `contextKey`
*   `Policy`: `id`, `elements`, `threshold`
*   `Request`: `actor`, `action`, `subject`, `conditions`

**Implementation Notes:**

*   This requires modifications to the existing policy management component to store and manage weights and thresholds.
*   A new component is needed to handle contextual data retrieval and dynamic weight adjustments.
*   The machine learning integration requires a dedicated training pipeline and model serving infrastructure.
