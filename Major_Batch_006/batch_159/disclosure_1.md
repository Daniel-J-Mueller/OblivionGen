## Dynamic Data Stitching for Distributed Inference

**Concept:** Expand the indirect addressing scheme to facilitate *dynamic* data stitching across a distributed network of processing units. Instead of simply offsetting addresses within a single memory space, the system should support assembling data fragments from multiple, heterogeneous sources *during* inference.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Architecture:** Each processing node (could be an IC like in the patent, a GPU, a CPU core, etc.) has:
    *   Local Memory: Standard RAM.
    *   Address Translation Unit (ATU): Enhanced to support remote address resolution.
    *   Communication Interface: High-bandwidth, low-latency network connection (e.g., NVLink, InfiniBand).
    *   DMA Engine: Modified to handle both local and remote data transfers.
*   **Data Fragmentation:** Large datasets (e.g., model weights, input tensors) are broken into fragments. These fragments are distributed across nodes. A *fragment map* is maintained, associating logical data IDs with physical node/offset locations.
*   **Logical Addressing:** Inference requests utilize *logical addresses* â€“ IDs representing data elements, independent of physical location.
*   **Dynamic Stitching Process:**
    1.  **Logical Address Resolution:** When a node needs data at a logical address:
        *   The ATU consults a distributed fragment map (potentially cached locally, with a coherency protocol).
        *   The fragment map returns the node ID and offset where the data fragment resides.
    2.  **Remote DMA Request:**  The node's DMA engine issues a request to the remote node. The request includes:
        *   Remote Node ID.
        *   Offset within the remote node's memory.
        *   Amount of data to transfer.
        *   Local memory address to write to.
    3.  **Remote DMA Transfer:** The remote node's DMA engine initiates a transfer of the requested data fragment to the requesting node.
    4.  **Data Assembly:** The requesting node assembles the received data fragment with other locally available data.
*   **DMA Queueing:** Multiple DMA requests are queued to enable pipelined data transfers. Separate queues for local and remote transfers.
*   **Error Handling:** Mechanisms to detect and recover from network errors, node failures, and data corruption. Redundancy and data replication.
*   **Compiler Extensions:** The compiler generates instructions that:
    *   Specify data dependencies in terms of logical addresses.
    *   Insert data stitching operations into the inference graph.
    *   Optimize data transfer patterns.
*   **Inference Engine Integration:** The inference engine schedules data stitching operations alongside standard computations.

**Pseudocode (Compiler Generated):**

```
// Assume 'logical_address' represents a data element's ID.
// 'destination_address' is where the data should be placed locally.

function fetch_data(logical_address, destination_address):
    node_id, offset = resolve_address(logical_address)  //From distributed fragment map

    if node_id == local_node_id:
        // Data is local. Direct memory access.
        copy_memory(local_memory + offset, destination_address, data_size)
    else:
        // Remote data fetch using DMA
        create_dma_request(remote_node_id, offset, destination_address, data_size)
        wait_for_dma_completion()

// Inference Step:
// For each data element required:
fetch_data(data_element_id, local_buffer)
// Perform computation using data in local_buffer
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Large language models (LLMs) distributed across multiple GPUs.
*   Federated learning with data residing on edge devices.
*   Real-time video analytics with data processing distributed across a network.
*   Scientific simulations requiring access to large datasets.
