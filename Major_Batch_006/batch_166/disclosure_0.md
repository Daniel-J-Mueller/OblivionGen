## Adaptive Metric Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Expand beyond static anomaly relevance scores by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to different metrics when predicting anomalies. This allows the system to prioritize metrics exhibiting more predictive power in real-time, improving anomaly detection accuracy and reducing false positives.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Inputs:**

*   **Metric Data Stream:** Continuous flow of time-series data for all monitored metrics.
*   **Anomaly Feedback Signal:** A signal indicating the accuracy of past anomaly detections. This could be explicit (human confirmation) or implicit (system-detected correlations, cascading failures). Represented as a reward/penalty value.
*   **Metric Metadata:**  Information about each metric (namespace, units, description) as used in the existing system.
*   **Contextual Data:** System load, time of day, deployment stage, and other contextual factors potentially influencing anomaly behavior.

**2. Reinforcement Learning Agent:**

*   **State Space:** Defined by a vector representing the current values of key metrics, contextual data, and the history of recent anomaly detections. Can utilize dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, autoencoders) to manage state space complexity.
*   **Action Space:**  Discrete or continuous values representing weight adjustments for each metric.  A limited range of adjustment is important. For example, weights could be adjusted between 0.8 and 1.2 of the baseline value.
*   **Reward Function:**  Designed to incentivize accurate anomaly detection. Positive reward for correct detection, negative reward for false positives/negatives. The magnitude of the reward should be tuned.
*   **RL Algorithm:**  Utilize a model-free RL algorithm such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). These algorithms are well-suited for continuous action spaces.

**3. System Architecture Integration:**

*   **Anomaly Relevance Score Calculation:** The existing anomaly relevance score calculation is modified to incorporate the metric weights learned by the RL agent.
    `New Relevance Score = Σ (Metric Weight * Original Relevance Score)`
*   **RL Agent Training Loop:**
    1.  Observe the current system state.
    2.  Select an action (metric weight adjustments) using the RL agent’s policy.
    3.  Apply the weight adjustments to the anomaly relevance score calculation.
    4.  Observe the resulting anomaly detections and receive the anomaly feedback signal (reward/penalty).
    5.  Update the RL agent’s policy based on the reward/penalty.
*   **Online Learning:** The RL agent is continuously trained in an online fashion, adapting to changing system behavior and improving anomaly detection accuracy over time.
*   **Exploration/Exploitation Balance:** Implement an exploration strategy (e.g., ε-greedy, Boltzmann exploration) to encourage the RL agent to explore different weight adjustments and discover optimal configurations.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```python
# Initialize RL Agent
agent = RL_Agent(state_space_dim, action_space_dim)

while True:
  # Observe System State
  state = get_system_state()

  # Select Action (Weight Adjustments)
  action = agent.select_action(state)

  # Apply Weight Adjustments
  adjusted_weights = apply_weight_adjustments(action)

  # Calculate Anomaly Relevance Scores
  relevance_scores = calculate_relevance_scores(adjusted_weights)

  # Detect Anomalies
  anomalies = detect_anomalies(relevance_scores)

  # Get Feedback (Reward/Penalty)
  reward = get_anomaly_feedback(anomalies)

  # Update RL Agent
  agent.update(state, reward)
```

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Hierarchical RL:**  Utilize a hierarchical RL approach to learn weights at different levels of granularity (e.g., namespace, individual metric).
*   **Multi-Agent RL:**  Deploy multiple RL agents, each responsible for a subset of metrics, to improve scalability and robustness.
*   **Transfer Learning:**  Pre-train the RL agent on a synthetic dataset or a simulated environment to accelerate learning and improve performance in the real world.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Incorporate XAI techniques to provide insights into why the RL agent is making certain weight adjustments.
