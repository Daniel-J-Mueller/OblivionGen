## Dynamic Expertise Routing & Predictive Questioning

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to not just *answer* visitor questions, but to *predict* potential questions *before* they are asked, and proactively route the visitor to the most appropriate expert based on a multi-faceted predictive model.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Question Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical question logs (from the existing system).
    *   Product/Offering details (features, specifications, category).
    *   Visitor behavior (browsing history, search terms, time on page).
    *   Real-time trending topics (integrates with external data sources like social media/news feeds relating to the offering).
*   **Model:**
    *   Hybrid approach: Combines a rule-based system (for common questions) with a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network/transformer) trained on historical data to predict the probability of different question types.
*   **Output:**  A ranked list of potential questions the visitor might ask, with associated confidence scores.

**2. Dynamic Expertise Profiles:**

*   **Beyond Ratings:**  Expert profiles now include:
    *   **Knowledge Graph:** Represents the expert's expertise as a graph, linking them to specific product features, concepts, and question types.
    *   **Response Style Vector:** Captures the expert's communication style (e.g., technical, conversational, concise) based on analysis of past responses.
    *   **Availability Schedule:** Real-time availability, taking into account other commitments.
    *   **Cognitive Load Indicator**: A real-time indicator of the expert's capacity, derived from current interactions, response latency, and other signals.
*   **Automatic Profile Updates:** Profiles are automatically updated based on:
    *   Visitor feedback.
    *   Analysis of responses (quality, clarity, completeness).
    *   Expert’s self-assessment and tagging of expertise areas.

**3.  Intelligent Routing Algorithm:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   Predicted question list (from Predictive Question Engine).
    *   Visitor profile (demographics, past interactions).
    *   Dynamic Expertise Profiles.
*   **Process:**
    1.  For each predicted question, identify experts with relevant knowledge graph nodes.
    2.  Score experts based on:
        *   Knowledge Relevance (strength of connection in the knowledge graph).
        *   Response Style Compatibility (matches visitor’s communication preference).
        *   Availability (lowest cognitive load, within schedule).
        *   Historical Performance (based on visitor feedback).
    3.  Select the highest-scoring expert.
    4.  If no expert is available or suitable, trigger escalation to a higher-level support queue.

**4. User Interface Adaptations**

*   **Proactive Help Panel:**  Display a panel with predicted questions, pre-answered where possible, and a “Connect with Expert” button.
*   **Expert Preview:**  Before connecting, show a brief profile of the selected expert (name, expertise areas, average response time).
*   **Personalized Question Suggestions:**  As the visitor types their question, offer suggestions based on predicted questions and the expert’s knowledge.

**Pseudocode (Routing Algorithm):**

```
function routeQuestion(visitor, question):
  predictedQuestions = predictQuestions(visitor, product)
  bestExpert = null
  highestScore = -1

  for each predictedQuestion in predictedQuestions:
    availableExperts = getAvailableExperts(predictedQuestion.keywords)
    for each expert in availableExperts:
      score = calculateExpertScore(expert, predictedQuestion, visitor)
      if score > highestScore:
        highestScore = score
        bestExpert = expert

  if bestExpert != null:
    return bestExpert
  else:
    escalateToSupportQueue()
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply answering questions; it *anticipates* needs and proactively connects visitors with the most effective expert, optimizing the support experience and potentially reducing overall support costs. The dynamic expertise profiles and intelligent routing algorithm create a more personalized and efficient system than the existing patent describes.
