**Self-Deploying, Modular Air Cushion System for Vehicle Impact Absorption**

**Concept:** Expand the air cushion principle beyond packaging to create a rapidly deployable, modular system integrated *into* vehicle exteriors for enhanced impact absorption. This system moves beyond a single inflation event to dynamically adjust cushion firmness and configuration during a collision.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Construction:** Hexagonal or pentagonal modular units, approximately 20cm across. Each module comprises a multi-layer flexible membrane.
    *   Layer 1: Durable, tear-resistant outer shell (e.g., reinforced TPU).
    *   Layer 2: Internal network of micro-air reservoirs (think miniature bellows) interconnected by narrow channels.
    *   Layer 3: Embedded piezoelectric sensors & micro-valves controlling airflow *between* reservoirs.
*   **Mounting:** Modules are semi-recessed into vehicle body panels (doors, quarter panels, bumpers) with a flexible adhesive/sealant allowing for slight movement. A low profile aesthetic is maintained.
*   **Activation:** Integrated with vehicle crash sensors. Upon impact detection:
    1.  **Initial Inflation:** Modules rapidly inflate via a compressed air system (small, dedicated tank & compressor) or a rapidly deployable chemical inflation system.
    2.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
        *   Piezoelectric sensors detect impact *location* and *force*.
        *   Micro-valves open/close, shifting air *within* the module network.
        *   This creates areas of higher/lower pressure – effectively ‘hardening’ the cushion where impact is greatest and allowing other areas to flex.
        *   Network can also ‘redirect’ impact forces away from vulnerable areas (e.g., passenger cell).
*   **Control System:**
    *   Dedicated microcontroller unit (MCU) manages sensors, valves, and air pressure.
    *   Algorithm prioritizes passenger safety by dynamically adjusting cushion configuration.
    *   System logs impact data for post-accident analysis.
*   **Redundancy:**
    *   Multiple compressed air tanks/inflation systems.
    *   Fail-safe valves to prevent over-inflation or deflation.
    *   Independent power supply.

**Pseudocode (simplified dynamic adjustment):**

```
ON ImpactDetected:
    Get ImpactLocation, ImpactForce
    FOR EACH Module IN ModuleNetwork:
        Distance = DistanceBetween(Module, ImpactLocation)
        IF Distance < Threshold:
            Pressure = Map(Distance, 0, Threshold, MaxPressure, MinPressure)
            AdjustValve(Module, Pressure)  // Control airflow to adjust internal pressure
        ELSE:
            AdjustValve(Module, RelaxedPressure)
    END FOR
END ON
```
