## Modular Acoustic Skins

**Concept:** Wireless speaker with interchangeable, magnetically-attached acoustic “skins” that radically alter sound dispersion and aesthetic.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Speaker Unit:** Cylindrical core unit (15cm height, 10cm diameter) housing all drivers, amplifier, and wireless connectivity. Material: Aluminum alloy. Finish: Matte black.
*   **Skin Interface:** 360-degree array of neodymium magnets embedded in the core speaker’s exterior. Polarity consistent across the circumference. Magnet strength: 800 Gauss.
*   **Skin Materials:** 
    *   **Acoustic Fabric Skins:** Woven fabrics (wool, silk, synthetic blends) stretched over rigid, perforated backing plates (ABS plastic). Backing plate thickness: 3-5mm. Varying weave densities and fabric textures to affect high-frequency dispersion. Color/pattern options are limitless.
    *   **Reflective/Diffusive Skins:** Panels constructed from molded acrylic or polycarbonate. Surfaces designed with complex geometric patterns (Voronoi, fractal) to scatter and redirect sound waves.  Finish: Glossy, matte, or metallic.
    *   **Directional Skins:**  Segmented panels that can be individually angled. Controlled via a companion app to ‘focus’ sound in specific directions.  Actuation: Small stepper motors embedded within the skin. Power: Drawn from the core speaker unit via conductive contacts.
    *   **Absorbent Skins:** Constructed from dense, open-cell foam (melamine foam) covered in breathable fabric.  Designed to minimize reflections and create a “dead” acoustic environment.  Useful in small spaces or for vocal recording.
*   **Attachment Mechanism:** Skins attach to the core unit via magnetic force.  Sufficient magnetic strength to prevent accidental detachment but allow for easy removal and replacement.  Alignment features (small pins or indentations) to ensure proper skin placement.
*   **App Integration:** Companion app allows users to:
    *   Select pre-defined skin profiles (e.g., "Bass Boost," "Studio Monitor," "Party Mode").
    *   Customize skin parameters (e.g., directional skin angles).
    *   Create and save custom skin profiles.
    *   Purchase new skins via an integrated store.
*   **Power/Data Transfer:**  Minimalistic conductive contacts embedded within the magnetic attachment points. Transfer power for active skins (directional) and potentially data for embedded displays/sensors.
*   **Manufacturing:** Skins designed for injection molding or thermoforming. Core unit manufactured using conventional CNC machining and assembly processes.



**Pseudocode for Directional Skin Control:**

```
//App receives user input for direction
function setDirection(angle_horizontal, angle_vertical) {
  //Convert angles to stepper motor steps
  steps_horizontal = calculateSteps(angle_horizontal);
  steps_vertical = calculateSteps(angle_vertical);

  //Send commands to stepper motor controllers
  sendCommand(motor_horizontal, steps_horizontal);
  sendCommand(motor_vertical, steps_vertical);
}

function calculateSteps(angle) {
  //Convert angle to steps based on motor resolution
  steps = angle * steps_per_degree;
  return steps;
}

function sendCommand(motor, steps) {
  //Serial communication to motor controller
  serial.write(motor, steps);
}
```
