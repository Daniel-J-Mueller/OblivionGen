## Adaptive Content Provenance & User Trust Scoring

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the idea of identifying malicious content sources, but instead of *just* blocking/restricting, it aims to create a dynamic, granular trust score for *all* content sources and communicate that to the user, empowering them with informed choices. It moves beyond simple source blocking to a system of contextual warnings and user-adjustable trust levels.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Content Provenance Tracking:**  Expand the existing feedback mechanism to meticulously log the entire journey of content – not just the immediate source, but *every* intermediary involved in delivering it. This includes CDNs, ad networks, and any content aggregation services. Each hop adds to a "provenance chain."

2.  **Trust Score Calculation:**  Assign a base trust score to every content source in the system. This score is dynamically adjusted based on:

    *   Malicious content reports (as in the original patent) – heavy negative weighting.
    *   Provenance chain length – shorter chains are favored (less opportunity for manipulation).
    *   Reputation of intermediaries in the provenance chain – established CDNs get positive weighting, unknown proxies negative weighting.
    *   Content integrity checks – cryptographic hashes to detect tampering.
    *   User feedback (explicit ratings, "report abuse" flags).

3.  **User Trust Profiles:**  Each user maintains a profile defining their trust preferences. This allows them to customize how the system behaves:

    *   **Sensitivity Level:**  Controls how aggressively the system warns about potentially risky content.  Low sensitivity = fewer warnings, higher risk. High sensitivity = more warnings, potentially frustrating experience.
    *   **Source Whitelisting/Blacklisting:**  Users can explicitly trust or distrust specific sources.
    *   **Content Type Preferences:**  Users can prioritize trust for certain content types (e.g., news articles vs. streaming videos).

4.  **Real-time Risk Assessment & Warning System:**  When content is delivered, the system calculates a risk score based on:

    *   The content source's trust score.
    *   The provenance chain's risk profile.
    *   The user’s trust profile.

    The system then presents a warning to the user appropriate to the risk level.  Examples:

    *   **Low Risk:**  "Content from a generally trustworthy source." (Minimal visual indication).
    *   **Medium Risk:**  "This content has passed through several intermediaries. Proceed with caution." (Yellow warning banner).
    *   **High Risk:**  "This content comes from a source with a history of serving malicious content.  Do you want to proceed?" (Red warning banner with prominent "Proceed" / "Cancel" buttons).

**Pseudocode (Risk Calculation):**

```
function calculateRiskScore(contentSource, provenanceChain, userTrustProfile):
  baseSourceTrust = contentSource.trustScore

  provenanceRisk = 0
  for each intermediary in provenanceChain:
    provenanceRisk += intermediary.riskScore

  userSensitivity = userTrustProfile.sensitivityLevel

  riskScore = (baseSourceTrust + provenanceRisk) * userSensitivity

  return riskScore
```

**Engineering Specifications:**

*   **Data Storage:**  Scalable database for storing content source information, provenance chains, user profiles, and risk scores.  Consider a graph database for efficient traversal of provenance chains.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `getContentRisk(contentURL)` – Returns the risk score for a given content URL.
    *   `getUserTrustProfile(userID)` – Returns the trust profile for a given user.
    *   `updateUserTrustProfile(userID, profileData)` – Updates the user's trust profile.
*   **Client-Side Integration:**  JavaScript library for displaying warnings and interacting with the API.
*   **Real-time Processing:**  Message queue (e.g., Kafka) for processing feedback and updating risk scores in real-time.

**Novelty & Potential:**

This system shifts the focus from simple content blocking to user empowerment and informed decision-making. The granular trust scoring and customizable user profiles provide a more nuanced and flexible approach to content security. It moves beyond a purely reactive system (blocking malicious content) to a proactive one that fosters user awareness and trust. The data generated by this system could also be used to improve the accuracy of content filtering algorithms and identify emerging threats.
