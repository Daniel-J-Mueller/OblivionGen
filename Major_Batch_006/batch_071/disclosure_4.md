## Dynamic CIDR Block Merging & Sharding with Predictive Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the existing CIDR block allocation system by introducing a dynamic merging and sharding mechanism *coupled* with predictive allocation based on observed entity usage patterns. The goal is to proactively optimize CIDR block size and assignment, minimizing fragmentation *and* anticipating future needs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical data on IP address allocation/deallocation per entity (timestamped).  Entity metadata (application type, expected growth rate, service level agreement). Real-time IP address usage metrics (per entity, per CIDR block).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Time-series analysis of IP address usage per entity.  Identify usage peaks, average usage, and growth trends.
    *   Classification of entities based on usage patterns (e.g., “steady state”, “linear growth”, “bursty”).
    *   Prediction of future IP address needs for each entity (using time-series forecasting models like ARIMA or Prophet). Include confidence intervals for predictions.
*   **Output:**  Entity-specific usage profiles, predicted IP address needs (with confidence intervals), and recommended CIDR block sizes.

**2. Dynamic CIDR Block Manager:**

*   **Core Function:** Manages the pool of available CIDR blocks, dynamically splitting and merging blocks based on entity needs and available resources.
*   **Splitting Logic:**
    *   If an entity's predicted IP address needs exceed the capacity of its currently assigned CIDR block, split the block into smaller blocks.
    *   Split blocks are sized based on the predicted needs plus a buffer (configurable).
    *   Prioritize splitting contiguous blocks to minimize fragmentation.
*   **Merging Logic:**
    *   If multiple entities are assigned adjacent CIDR blocks with low utilization, merge them into a single, larger block.
    *   Merging is only performed if it does not disrupt existing allocations.
    *   Implement a "coalescence threshold" to prevent excessive merging/splitting.
*   **Fragmentation Mitigation:**
    *   Maintain a fragmentation index for the CIDR block pool.
    *   Prioritize block operations that reduce fragmentation.
    *   Implement a defragmentation process to rearrange blocks and consolidate free space.

**3. Allocation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Request for IP address allocation (entity ID, number of addresses).  Data from Data Collection & Analysis Module. Current state of CIDR block pool.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Predictive Allocation:**  Based on the entity's profile, pre-allocate a CIDR block slightly larger than the immediate request, anticipating future growth.
    *   **Block Selection:**  Select the smallest available CIDR block that can satisfy the request *and* the predicted needs.
    *   **Dynamic Sharding:** If no suitable pre-defined block exists, dynamically split a larger block to create a block tailored to the request.
    *   **Contiguous Allocation:** Prioritize allocating contiguous blocks to reduce routing complexity.

**Pseudocode (Allocation Engine):**

```
function allocateIPs(entityID, numAddresses):
  entityProfile = getDataCollectionModule().getEntityProfile(entityID)
  predictedNeed = entityProfile.getPredictedNeed()
  totalAddresses = numAddresses + predictedNeed

  availableBlock = findSmallestAvailableBlock(totalAddresses)

  if availableBlock == null:
    largerBlock = findLargestAvailableBlock()
    if largerBlock != null:
      availableBlock = splitBlock(largerBlock, totalAddresses)
    else:
      return ERROR_NO_BLOCKS_AVAILABLE

  allocateBlockToEntity(entityID, availableBlock)
  return SUCCESS
```

**4. Deallocation Engine:**

*   **Logic:** Upon IP address deallocation, consolidate freed space within the assigned CIDR block. If a CIDR block becomes significantly underutilized, consider merging it with adjacent blocks or returning it to the available pool.
*   **Smallest Block Prioritization:** Prioritize deallocating from the smallest blocks assigned to an entity to improve overall block utilization.

**Data Structures:**

*   `CIDRBlock`:  Lowest IP address, bit-length prefix, allocated/unallocated status, entity ID (if assigned).
*   `EntityProfile`: Entity ID, historical IP address usage data, predicted IP address needs (with confidence intervals), classification (usage pattern).

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   Distribute the CIDR block pool across multiple servers.
*   Implement a consistent hashing scheme to ensure even distribution of blocks.
*   Use a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft or Paxos) to maintain consistency across servers.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to failures.
