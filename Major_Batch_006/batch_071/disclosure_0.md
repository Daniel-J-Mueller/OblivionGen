## Adaptive Communication Session Management via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the automatic session termination based on speech activity to incorporate real-time biofeedback from the initiating device's user to determine engagement, even *without* audible speech. The system leverages wearable sensor data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial muscle activity) to infer user attention and prevent premature session termination.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Integration:** Compatible with standard Bluetooth/USB peripherals – specifically, wearable sensors providing raw data streams for:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - measuring the time variation between heartbeats.
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) / Skin Conductance - measuring changes in sweat gland activity.
    *   Facial Electromyography (fEMG) - measuring electrical activity of facial muscles.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Biofeedback Data Acquisition:** A module to receive and preprocess data streams from connected sensors.  Includes filtering, noise reduction, and synchronization.
    *   **Engagement Inference Engine:** An AI/ML model (initially trained, then continuously updated via user data) to estimate user engagement level from the combined biofeedback signals.
        *   Input: Preprocessed HRV, EDA, and fEMG data.
        *   Output:  Engagement Score (0.0 – 1.0, 1.0 being highest engagement).
    *   **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**  Modifies the speech inactivity threshold based on the Engagement Score.
        *   If Engagement Score > 0.7: Speech inactivity threshold increases significantly (e.g., from 5 seconds to 30 seconds).
        *   If 0.3 < Engagement Score < 0.7: Speech inactivity threshold increases moderately (e.g., from 5 seconds to 15 seconds).
        *   If Engagement Score < 0.3:  Standard speech inactivity threshold applied (e.g., 5 seconds).
    *   **Contextual Awareness Module:** Integrates with device calendar/scheduling apps to determine session type (e.g., meeting, casual call). Different session types may have pre-defined Engagement Score weighting parameters.
*   **Pseudocode (Adaptive Threshold Logic):**

```
function adjust_inactivity_threshold(engagement_score, base_threshold):
    if engagement_score > 0.7:
        adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * 6  // Increase by 6x
    else if 0.3 <= engagement_score < 0.7:
        adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * 3 // Increase by 3x
    else:
        adjusted_threshold = base_threshold // Use base threshold

    return adjusted_threshold
```

*   **User Interface:**
    *   Visual indicator of current Engagement Score (optional).
    *   Settings to calibrate biofeedback sensors and adjust sensitivity.
    *   Option to disable/enable biofeedback integration.
*   **Data Storage:**  Anonymized and aggregated biofeedback data may be stored (with user consent) to improve the accuracy of the Engagement Inference Engine.
*   **Security:** All biofeedback data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond purely audio-based activity detection and incorporates physiological indicators of engagement, allowing for more natural and less disruptive communication sessions. The dynamic threshold adjustment ensures that sessions are not prematurely terminated simply because of momentary silence or passive listening. It accounts for situations where a user might be actively engaged *without* speaking.
