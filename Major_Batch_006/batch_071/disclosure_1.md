## Focused Sonic Disruption System – Personnel Access Control

**Concept:** Instead of relying solely on EMP to disable devices, utilize highly focused, short-burst sonic waves to induce temporary or permanent malfunctions in electronic devices *while* simultaneously implementing a bio-metric scan to allow authorized personnel safe passage. This adds a layer of security *and* allows for targeted disruption, minimizing collateral damage.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sonic Emitter Array:** A phased array of ultrasonic transducers mounted within a reinforced frame positioned within a passageway (similar to the existing patent’s frame concept). Minimum frequency range: 20kHz – 100kHz. Each transducer individually addressable.
*   **Bio-metric Scanner:** Integrated with the passageway frame. Facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, or retinal scan capable. Must authenticate before sonic emission is authorized.
*   **Targeting System:** Real-time device detection using mmWave radar or similar technology. Algorithms must identify device type (smartphone, laptop, storage device) and estimate its orientation and distance. 
*   **Waveform Generator:** Programmable waveform generator capable of producing complex ultrasonic waveforms optimized for disrupting different device types. Pre-programmed profiles for common devices.
*   **Shielding:** Multi-layered shielding to contain sonic emissions and prevent interference with adjacent systems. Materials: Acoustic foam, lead composite, vibration dampening gel.
*   **Power Supply:** High-capacity power supply with surge protection. Redundant power backups.
*   **Control System:** Microcontroller-based control system with a user interface for configuring system parameters, monitoring system status, and logging events.
*   **Safety Protocols:**
    *   Automated power shutdown in case of system malfunction.
    *   Emergency override switch for manual system control.
    *   Visual and audible warnings before sonic emission.
*   **Passageway Integration:** Frame designed to integrate seamlessly with existing door frames or passageway structures.
*   **Mounting:** Robust mounting system to withstand vibration and potential impacts.

**Pseudocode for Targeting and Emission:**

```
//Initialization
radar = RadarModule()
scanner = BioMetricScanner()
emitter = SonicEmitter()

//Main Loop
while (true) {
    device = radar.detectDevice()
    if (device != null) {
        auth = scanner.authenticate()
        if (auth == true) {
            //determine device type
            if (device.type == "smartphone") {
                emitter.emitWaveform(waveformProfile["smartphone"])
            } else if (device.type == "laptop") {
                emitter.emitWaveform(waveformProfile["laptop"])
            } else {
                emitter.emitWaveform(waveformProfile["generic"])
            }
        } else {
            //Unauthorized access – system remains inactive
        }
    }
}
```

**Waveform Profiles:**

*   **Smartphone:**  High-frequency burst (50-80 kHz) targeted at the microphone and speakers.  Designed to induce temporary audio distortion or microphone failure.
*   **Laptop:**  Broad-spectrum burst (30-60 kHz) targeting the hard drive or SSD, potentially causing data corruption or temporary shutdown.
*   **Generic:**  Mid-frequency burst (40-50 kHz) designed to induce general electronic interference.

**Further considerations:**

*   Investigate the use of directional sonic beams to further focus the disruption.
*   Develop algorithms to adapt the waveform based on device type and proximity.
*   Explore the use of multiple emitters to create a “sonic cage” around the target device.
*   Consider implementing a failsafe mechanism to prevent permanent damage to authorized devices.
