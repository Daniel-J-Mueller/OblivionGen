## Adaptive Precision Beam Search

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust the numerical precision of tensor elements during beam search operations based on their relative contribution to the final result.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on efficiently *finding* the largest values. This design aims to reduce computational cost and memory footprint *while maintaining accuracy* by intelligently managing data precision.  Not all tensor elements contribute equally to the final beam search result. Reducing precision for less influential elements accelerates processing without significant information loss.

**Components:**

*   **Influence Estimator:** A small neural network (or heuristic function) that assesses the potential impact of each tensor element on the final beam search outcome. Input: Tensor element value, current beam score, iteration number. Output: Influence score (0.0 to 1.0).
*   **Precision Controller:**  Based on the influence score, selects the appropriate numerical precision (e.g., FP32, FP16, INT8, or even custom bit-widths) for each element.
*   **Dynamic Quantization/De-Quantization Module:**  Converts elements to the selected precision and back when necessary. Utilizes a lookup table or a trained quantization model to minimize information loss.
*   **Modified Max-N, Find-Index-N, Match-Replace-N Instructions:** Existing instructions are adapted to operate on tensors with variable precision elements. This requires a flag to indicate the precision of each element.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function adaptive_beam_search(input_tensor, M, N):
  # M = target number of beams
  # N = number of elements to consider per iteration

  for iteration in range(number_of_iterations):
    # 1. Estimate influence of each element in input_tensor
    influence_scores = estimate_influence(input_tensor)

    # 2. Determine precision level for each element
    precision_levels = determine_precision(influence_scores) # e.g., based on thresholds

    # 3. Quantize/De-Quantize tensor based on precision levels
    quantized_tensor = quantize(input_tensor, precision_levels)

    # 4. Execute modified Max-N instruction
    largest_values, indices = max_n(quantized_tensor, N) # Modified instruction

    # 5. Execute modified Find-Index-N instruction
    # 6. Execute modified Match-Replace-N instruction (or equivalent)

    # 7. De-Quantize largest_values and indices (if necessary)

    input_tensor = updated_tensor

  return result
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires support for variable precision arithmetic within the processing circuit.
*   The Influence Estimator and Dynamic Quantization/De-Quantization modules could be implemented as separate hardware blocks.
*   The instruction set needs to be extended to include flags indicating element precision.
*   The ALUs need to be designed to handle variable precision calculations efficiently.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced memory footprint
*   Faster computation
*   Lower power consumption
*   Improved throughput

**Novelty:**  Current beam search implementations generally utilize a fixed numerical precision for all tensor elements. This design introduces a dynamic, data-dependent precision adjustment, optimizing resource utilization without sacrificing accuracy.
