## Spherical Rotor Array for 3D Object Sorting & Manipulation

**Concept:** Expand the spherical rotor concept into a 3D array for precise object sorting and manipulation within a conveying system. Instead of simply diverting objects left/right, this system uses controlled rotations of multiple rotors to *actively* orient and position objects in 3D space.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:** A grid of spherical rotors, with variable density possible (more rotors in areas requiring higher precision). Rotor spacing configurable based on expected object size. Minimum array size: 5x5 rotors. Maximum: scalable.
*   **Rotor Design:**
    *   Inner Sphere: Paramagnetic material (as in the patent), with embedded magnetizable slugs. Slugs are individually addressable via micro-coils within the sphere.
    *   Outer Layer: Low-friction, durable polymer coating. Segmented to allow for slight flexing and conform to object shape without causing damage.
    *   Diameter: Variable, 5cm - 20cm range.
*   **Drive System:**
    *   Each stator plate is individually controlled by a high-frequency PWM driver.
    *   Micro-coils within the spheres allow for *dynamic balancing* and fine-tuning of rotational forces, independent of stator plate control.
    *   Each rotor has embedded IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for real-time feedback on rotational velocity, orientation, and external forces.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Vision System: Overhead camera system provides 3D object recognition and pose estimation.
    *   Trajectory Planning: Algorithm generates optimized rotor rotations to achieve desired object orientation and position.
    *   Force Limiting: System monitors forces exerted on objects and adjusts rotor speeds to prevent damage.
    *   Real-time feedback loop integrating IMU data, vision system data, and force measurements.
*   **Conveyor Integration:**
    *   Modular conveyor sections to accommodate the rotor array.
    *   Variable conveyor speed to synchronize with rotor movements.
    *   Object detection sensors to trigger rotor activation.

**Pseudocode (Object Orientation Routine):**

```
FUNCTION OrientObject(objectID, targetOrientation, targetPosition)
    // Get current object pose from Vision System
    currentPose = GetObjectPose(objectID)

    // Calculate required rotation delta
    rotationDelta = CalculateRotationDelta(currentPose, targetOrientation)

    // Identify rotors influencing object
    influencingRotors = IdentifyInfluencingRotors(objectID)

    // Calculate rotor speed/direction needed for delta rotation
    rotorCommands = CalculateRotorCommands(influencingRotors, rotationDelta)

    // Apply rotor commands
    FOR EACH rotor IN influencingRotors:
        SetRotorSpeed(rotor, rotorCommands[rotor])

    // Monitor object position and adjust rotor commands in real-time
    WHILE object is not in target position:
        // Read object position from Vision System
        objectPosition = GetObjectPosition()

        // Calculate error and adjust rotor commands
        error = CalculatePositionError(objectPosition, targetPosition)
        rotorCommands = AdjustRotorCommands(rotorCommands, error)
        Apply rotor commands

    // Stop rotors
    FOR EACH rotor IN influencingRotors:
        SetRotorSpeed(rotor, 0)
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-speed assembly lines (precise part orientation).
*   Automated bin picking (complex object grasping).
*   Robotic sorting of irregularly shaped items.
*   Quality control (360-degree inspection).
