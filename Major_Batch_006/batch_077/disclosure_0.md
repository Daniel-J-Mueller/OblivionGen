## Adaptive Event Granularity & Predictive Error Masking

**Concept:** The existing patent details a system for tracking events and identifying errors based on age bits and event register states. This design introduces *dynamic* event granularity and incorporates a predictive error masking system to improve resilience and reduce false positives. Instead of fixed event registration, the system learns to coalesce or subdivide events based on runtime behavior, and proactively masks anticipated errors based on historical data and predictive modeling.

**Specifications:**

**1. Event Granularity Controller (EGC):**

*   **Function:** Manages the granularity of events. Determines whether to register events at a coarse-grained or fine-grained level.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Event Frequency Data: Measured frequency of each event.
    *   Processing Load: Current load on the processing engine.
    *   Error Rate: Historical error rate for specific event sequences.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Granularity Control Signals: Signals indicating the desired event granularity (coarse, medium, fine).
    *   Event Mapping Table: A table mapping logical events to physical event registers, adjusting based on granularity.
*   **Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function adjust_granularity(event_frequency, processing_load, error_rate):
  if processing_load > threshold_high:
    granularity = coarse
  else if error_rate > threshold_medium:
    granularity = medium
  else if event_frequency < threshold_low:
    granularity = coarse
  else:
    granularity = fine

  update_event_mapping_table(granularity)
  return granularity
```

**2. Predictive Error Masking (PEM) Engine:**

*   **Function:** Predicts potential errors based on historical data and proactively masks them, preventing false positives.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Event Sequence History: Log of past event sequences.
    *   Error History: Log of past errors and associated event sequences.
    *   Current Event Sequence: The current sequence of events.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Error Mask Signals: Signals indicating which errors to mask.
*   **Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function predict_error(event_sequence, error_history):
  # Train a predictive model (e.g., LSTM, Markov Model) using error_history
  predicted_error_probability = model.predict(event_sequence)

  if predicted_error_probability > threshold:
    return error_mask_signal
  else:
    return no_mask_signal
```

**3. Integrated Circuit Modifications:**

*   **Event Register Array:** Extend the event register array to support dynamic event mapping.
*   **Age Bit Register:** Maintain the existing age bit register functionality.
*   **EGC Hardware Unit:** Dedicated hardware unit for implementing the EGC algorithm.
*   **PEM Hardware Unit:** Dedicated hardware unit for implementing the PEM algorithm.
*   **Control & Status Registers (CSR):** Add CSRs for configuring EGC and PEM parameters (thresholds, learning rates, etc.).

**4. System Integration:**

1.  The EGC continuously monitors event frequency, processing load, and error rate.
2.  Based on these metrics, the EGC adjusts the event granularity and updates the event mapping table.
3.  The PEM engine analyzes the current event sequence and predicts potential errors.
4.  The PEM engine generates error mask signals to prevent false positives.
5.  The age bit register tracks the age of events.
6.  Errors are identified based on age bit values and masked as needed.



This design introduces adaptability and prediction to the existing error tracking system, potentially leading to improved performance and reliability.
