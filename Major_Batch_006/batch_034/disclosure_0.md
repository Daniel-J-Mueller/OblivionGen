## Dynamic Translation Granularity & Contextual Prioritization

**Concept:** Expand upon preemptive translation by introducing *dynamic granularity* of content segments *and* contextual prioritization, enabling significantly more efficient and accurate translation delivery – especially for complex documents or web pages.

**Specification:**

**I. Content Segmentation Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Instead of treating entire "content items" as single units for translation (as the patent appears to do), dynamically segment content based on both structural *and* semantic analysis.
*   **Granularity Levels:** Define at least four levels:
    *   **Paragraph:** Standard paragraph boundaries.
    *   **Sentence:** Individual sentences.
    *   **Phrase:**  Noun phrases, verb phrases, etc., identified via parsing.
    *   **Key Term/Entity:**  Proper nouns, technical terms, identified via Named Entity Recognition (NER).
*   **Segmentation Algorithm:** Employ a hybrid approach:
    *   **Structural:**  Initial segmentation based on HTML/document structure (paragraphs, lists, headings).
    *   **Semantic:**  Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (parsing, NER, dependency analysis) to refine segmentation, breaking down long sentences or identifying key terms within paragraphs.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts granularity based on content complexity.  Highly complex or technical content receives finer granularity (phrase/key term). Simpler content uses paragraph or sentence-level segmentation.

**II. Contextual Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Prioritize translation requests based on *user context* and *content importance*.
*   **Contextual Factors:**  Track:
    *   **User Scroll Position:**  Translate content currently visible or *imminently* visible in the user’s viewport *first*.
    *   **User Mouse Hover/Focus:**  Immediately translate content the user is interacting with.
    *   **Search Query Relevance:**  For search results, prioritize translation of sections matching the search terms most closely.
    *   **Content Type:**  Prioritize translation of headings, calls to action, or other key elements.
*   **Importance Scoring:** Assign each content segment an "importance score" based on contextual factors and content type.  Higher scores indicate higher priority for translation.

**III. Multi-Tiered Translation Pipeline:**

*   **Function:**  Utilize a tiered translation pipeline, similar to the patent’s multiple machine translation services, but optimized for dynamic granularity and prioritization.
*   **Tier 1 (Fast/Low Quality):** Lightweight MT service for *extremely* rapid translation of smaller segments (phrases, key terms).  Used for immediate feedback and preview.
*   **Tier 2 (Balanced):**  General-purpose MT service for sentence/paragraph-level translation, providing a good balance of speed and quality.
*   **Tier 3 (High Quality/Slow):**  Advanced MT service (e.g., neural machine translation with domain adaptation) for critical content or when user is explicitly requesting higher quality.
*   **Dynamic Tier Selection:**  The system dynamically selects the appropriate tier for each segment based on:
    *   **Importance Score:** Higher scores = Tier 3.
    *   **Segment Size:** Smaller segments (phrases) can use Tier 1.
    *   **User Preference:** Allow users to set a preferred translation quality level.

**IV.  Caching and Delivery:**

*   **Granular Caching:** Cache translations at the *segment level*, not the entire content item.
*   **Adaptive Delivery:**  Deliver translated segments as soon as they are available, prioritizing segments with higher importance scores and/or those currently visible to the user.
*   **Progressive Rendering:**  Render translated content progressively as segments become available, providing a seamless user experience.



**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// On Page Load/Search Result Display:
SegmentContent(pageContent) -> List of Segments
For each Segment in List:
    CalculateImportanceScore(Segment, userContext)
    SelectTranslationTier(Segment, ImportanceScore)
    RequestTranslation(Segment, SelectedTier)
    StoreTranslation(Segment, TranslatedText)

//On User Scroll/Interaction:
For each Visible Segment:
  If Translation not Available:
    RequestTranslation(Segment, SelectedTier)

DeliverTranslatedSegment(Segment, TranslatedText)
```
