## Dynamic Content Segmentation & Predictive Chunking

**Concept:** Extend the metadata-driven content organization to *predictively* segment content *before* a user request, anticipating potential consumption patterns. Instead of solely reacting to user commands for sections, proactively chunk content based on anticipated needs.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Segmentation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Raw content (text, audio, video, etc.), initial metadata (topic, source, etc.), historical user interaction data (command logs, consumption patterns).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Pattern Analysis:** Analyze historical data to identify common content consumption patterns (e.g., users frequently request the introduction and conclusion of articles, or specific segments within videos).
    *   **Content Feature Extraction:** Extract semantic features from the content itself (e.g., identify key topics, sentiment shifts, structural elements like headings and subheadings).
    *   **Segmentation Model:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or transformer) to predict optimal segmentation points. The model should consider both historical patterns *and* content features. Output: a list of suggested segment start and end points, along with associated confidence scores.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously refine the segmentation model based on real-time user feedback (e.g., if a user repeatedly skips a predicted segment, lower its confidence score and adjust future predictions).

**2.  Metadata Enrichment:**

*   **Predicted Segment Metadata:**  For each predicted segment, generate new metadata including:
    *   `segment_confidence`:  A score indicating the likelihood that the user will request this segment.
    *   `segment_topic`: A refined topic descriptor specific to the segment.
    *   `segment_summary`: A concise summary of the segment's content.
    *   `segment_keywords`: Relevant keywords extracted from the segment.
*   **Proactive Indexing:**  Index the predicted segments and their associated metadata in the NLU component data store.

**3.  NLU Component Enhancement:**

*   **Intent Expansion:** Augment the intent classification model to recognize intents related to predicted segments (e.g., "Tell me more about the key findings," which could map to a high-confidence predicted segment).
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Enable the NLU component to consider the user's current context (e.g., previous commands, current topic of conversation) when determining the relevance of predicted segments.

**4.  Chunk Prioritization & Caching:**

*   **Tiered Caching:** Implement a tiered caching system that prioritizes high-confidence predicted segments. Pre-load these segments into memory for faster access.
*   **Adaptive Chunk Size:** Dynamically adjust the size of predicted segments based on content type and user preferences.

**Pseudocode (NLU Component):**

```
function process_utterance(utterance):
  intent, entities = NLU_model.classify(utterance)

  if intent == "request_information":
    topic = entities["topic"]
    possible_segments = get_segments(topic)

    // Filter segments based on user context and intent
    relevant_segments = filter_segments(possible_segments, utterance, user_context)

    if relevant_segments:
      // Prioritize high-confidence segments
      best_segment = select_best_segment(relevant_segments)
      return best_segment.content
    else:
      // Handle cases where no relevant segment is found
      return "I'm sorry, I couldn't find relevant information."
```

**Novelty:** The innovation lies in the *proactive* segmentation of content based on predictive analytics, rather than solely reacting to user requests. This allows for a more fluid and responsive user experience, anticipating needs and delivering information before it is explicitly asked for.  It moves beyond simply *organizing* content to *pre-digesting* it.
