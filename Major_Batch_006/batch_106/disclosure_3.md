## Acoustic Resonance Servicing

**Concept:** Utilize acoustic resonance within the packaging to both deliver power *and* data to the sealed device, eliminating the need for physical contacts. This builds on the idea of external access but moves beyond conductive contacts to a truly wireless solution *within* the packaging.

**Specs:**

*   **Packaging Material:** A specifically engineered polymer composite, tuned for acoustic wave propagation. The base and sidewalls will have varying densities to guide and focus sound waves. Interior surface will be a highly reflective material.
*   **Transducer Array (Dock):** A phased array of ultrasonic transducers integrated into a servicing dock. The array will be capable of both transmitting and receiving acoustic signals. Frequency range: 20kHz â€“ 80kHz (optimized for air/polymer transmission).  Power output: Adjustable, up to 5W.
*   **Piezoelectric Receiver (Device):** A thin-film piezoelectric receiver embedded within the sealed device, specifically positioned to maximize acoustic energy capture.  Surface area: 2cm x 2cm. Sensitivity: > -90dB.  Rectification circuit integrated to convert AC signal to DC for power delivery.
*   **Modulation Scheme:** Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) for data transmission.  Different frequencies represent binary data.  Error correction coding (e.g., Hamming code) implemented to improve data reliability.
*   **Power Management:** Integrated power management circuit on the device to regulate voltage and current received from the piezoelectric receiver.  Battery charging/power delivery selection.
*   **Acoustic Focusing Geometry:**  Internal reflectors and diffusers within the packaging designed to concentrate acoustic energy onto the piezoelectric receiver.  The base of the package will feature a concave reflector.
*   **Software/Firmware:**  Dock software to control transducer array phasing and frequency.  Device firmware to decode acoustic signals and manage power delivery.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A simple acknowledgment protocol to ensure data transmission success.

**Pseudocode (Dock):**

```
FUNCTION transmitData(data, deviceID)
    // Calculate optimal phasing for transducer array based on deviceID
    phasing = calculatePhasing(deviceID)

    // Modulate data using FSK
    modulatedData = modulateFSK(data)

    // Transmit modulated data using phased array
    transmitPhasedArray(modulatedData, phasing)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION receiveAcknowledgement(deviceID)
    // Listen for acknowledgement signal from device
    acknowledgement = listenForSignal(deviceID)

    IF acknowledgement == TRUE THEN
        RETURN TRUE
    ELSE
        RETURN FALSE
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Pseudocode (Device):**

```
FUNCTION receiveData()
    // Listen for acoustic signal
    signal = listenForAcousticSignal()

    // Demodulate signal using FSK
    demodulatedData = demodulateFSK(signal)

    // Error correction
    correctedData = applyErrorCorrection(demodulatedData)

    // Process data
    processData(correctedData)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION sendAcknowledgement()
    // Generate acknowledgement signal
    acknowledgementSignal = generateAcknowledgementSignal()

    // Transmit acknowledgement signal
    transmitAcousticSignal(acknowledgementSignal)
END FUNCTION
```
