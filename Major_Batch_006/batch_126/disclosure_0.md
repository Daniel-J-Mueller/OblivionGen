## Dynamic Robotic Swarm Packaging

**Concept:** Expand the inspection and packaging capability beyond a single module. Implement a dynamic, collaborative swarm of small, autonomous robots operating *within* the processing module space.

**Specs:**

*   **Robot Dimensions:** 15cm x 15cm x 10cm, cylindrical base with articulating arm.
*   **Swarm Size:** Variable, 20-100 robots depending on throughput requirements.
*   **Communication:** Robot-to-Robot (R2R) mesh network via Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for precise localization and low-latency communication. Central server acts as a 'coordinator' not a 'controller'.
*   **Payload Capacity:** 500g per robot.
*   **End Effectors:** Modular, quick-release system. Standard options include:
    *   Vacuum Gripper (for smooth surfaces)
    *   Soft Robotics Gripper (for delicate/irregular items)
    *   Vision Sensor (high-resolution camera for item recognition and quality control)
*   **Power:** Wireless inductive charging stations integrated into the processing module floor. Robots return to charging stations autonomously when battery level is low.
*   **Processing Module Integration:**
    *   Overhead Camera System: Tracks all items and robots within the module. Provides a global view for swarm coordination.
    *   Floor Grid:  A low-friction, precisely mapped grid system enables robots to navigate efficiently.
    *   Item Transfer Stations: Designated areas where items are initially placed for robot pickup.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Distributed Task Allocation:** Each robot independently evaluates tasks and bids to fulfill them, maximizing efficiency.
    *   **Collision Avoidance:** Real-time path planning based on UWB localization data.
    *   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** The swarm adapts to changes in order profiles and item characteristics.
    *   **Machine Learning:**  Robots learn optimal packaging strategies based on historical data.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Items arrive at the item transfer stations.
    2.  The overhead camera system identifies the items and their characteristics.
    3.  The swarm robots bid on tasks (e.g., picking up an item, placing it on the pre-packaging substrate, inspecting dimensions).
    4.  Robots collaborate to pre-package and inspect items. Multiple robots may work on a single item simultaneously.
    5.  Robots automatically construct carton-based outer packaging around the pre-packaged unit using pre-folded carton blanks.
    6.  Packaged units are conveyed to the shipping module.
*   **Pseudocode (Task Allocation):**

```
FOR EACH robot IN swarm:
    available_tasks = GetAvailableTasks(robot.location, robot.capabilities)
    IF available_tasks is not empty:
        best_task = SelectBestTask(available_tasks, robot.efficiency_metric) //Metric can include distance, time, complexity
        IF best_task is not null:
            ClaimTask(best_task, robot.id)
            MoveToTaskLocation(best_task.location)
            ExecuteTask(best_task)
    ELSE:
        ReturnToChargingStation()
```

**Innovation:** This design moves beyond a single automated process to a collaborative swarm system. The dynamic, distributed nature of the swarm provides increased flexibility, scalability, and resilience. It enables the processing module to handle a wider variety of item shapes, sizes, and order profiles.
