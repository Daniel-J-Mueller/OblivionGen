## Dynamic Acoustic Mapping & Personalized Soundscapes

**Concept:** Leverage the beamforming microphone array and light elements to create a real-time acoustic map of the environment, then utilize this map to generate personalized and adaptive soundscapes tailored to the user's location and activity.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing Microphone Array (First & Second Microphones)
    *   Existing Light Element Array
    *   High-Resolution Depth Sensor (e.g., Time-of-Flight) - Integrated into device housing.
    *   Haptic Feedback System - Small vibratory motors distributed around device perimeter.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:**
        *   Utilizes beamforming data *combined* with depth sensor data to create a 3D point cloud representation of the room.
        *   Identifies reflective surfaces, their size, distance, and material properties (estimated via frequency response of reflections).
        *   Calculates reverberation time (RT60) for different zones within the room.
        *   Identifies sound sources *beyond* voice commands - e.g., ambient noise, music from other devices.
    *   **Soundscape Generator:**
        *   User Profile Integration: Access to user preferences (music genre, preferred ambiance, relaxation vs. focus modes).
        *   Activity Recognition:  Machine learning model analyzing microphone data (beyond speech) to infer user activity (e.g., reading, working, exercising).
        *   Adaptive Soundscape Creation:  Generates a multi-layered soundscape based on:
            *   User Preferences
            *   Detected Activity
            *   Acoustic Map: Modifies the soundscape to compensate for room acoustics (reducing echo, enhancing clarity) and mask unwanted noise.  Could incorporate binaural rendering to simulate sound sources in specific locations.
        *   Sound Source Placement:  The algorithm strategically “places” virtual sound sources within the acoustic map, creating an immersive and spatially accurate auditory experience.
    *   **Light & Haptic Synchronization:**
        *   Light Element Array: Utilized to visually reinforce the soundscape. For example:
            *   If a virtual sound source is placed near a virtual ‘fire’, the light element array emulates flickering flames.
            *   If a calming ambient soundscape is active, the lights pulse gently with the rhythm.
        *   Haptic Feedback:  Subtle vibrations synchronized with key elements of the soundscape, enhancing immersion. (e.g., Low rumble during a thunderstorm, gentle pulse with ambient music).
*   **Pseudocode (Soundscape Generation):**

    ```
    FUNCTION GenerateSoundscape(UserProfile, Activity, AcousticMap)
    // Inputs: User Profile (preferences), Activity (inferred), AcousticMap (3D environment)

    // 1. Base Layer: Select background ambience from UserProfile
    BaseAmbience = UserProfile.PreferredAmbience

    // 2. Activity Layer: Add sound effects based on Activity
    IF Activity == "Reading" THEN
        ActivitySound = "Gentle Rain"
    ELSE IF Activity == "Working" THEN
        ActivitySound = "Cafe Ambiance"
    ELSE IF Activity == "Exercising" THEN
        ActivitySound = "Energetic Music"
    ENDIF

    // 3. Acoustic Compensation: Adjust soundscape based on AcousticMap
    FOR each VirtualSoundSource in Soundscape
        AdjustVolume(VirtualSoundSource, AcousticMap.ReverberationTime, AcousticMap.ReflectiveSurfaces)
        AdjustPanning(VirtualSoundSource, AcousticMap.RoomDimensions)
    ENDFOR

    // 4. Combine Layers: Mix BaseAmbience, ActivitySound, and Adjusted VirtualSoundSources

    // 5. Output: Soundscape data for audio playback
    RETURN Soundscape
    ENDFUNCTION
    ```

**Novelty:**  While the patent focuses on rejecting reflections, this system *embraces* the acoustic environment, utilizing reflections to enhance and personalize the auditory experience.  The combination of real-time acoustic mapping, adaptive soundscape generation, and synchronized light/haptic feedback creates a truly immersive and spatially aware auditory experience. It goes beyond simple noise cancellation or voice assistance to create a dynamic and adaptive environment tailored to the user's needs and preferences.
