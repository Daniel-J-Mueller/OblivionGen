## Dynamic Workspace Zoning with Projected Augmented Reality & Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Augment the RFID-based proximity detection with a dynamic, projected augmented reality (AR) system that creates virtual work zones around warehouse workers, coupled with haptic feedback vests for both workers and robots. This moves beyond simple evasive maneuvers to proactive, collaborative workspace management.

**System Specs:**

*   **Worker Vest:** Lightweight vest incorporating a network of low-power haptic actuators (vibrators). Each actuator corresponds to a defined directional zone (front, back, left, right, above, below).
*   **Robot Integration:** Robots equipped with:
    *   Downward-facing, wide-angle AR projectors capable of displaying visible light patterns on the floor.
    *   An array of ultrasonic sensors for real-time 3D mapping of the immediate environment.
    *   Haptic actuator array on exterior, mirroring worker vest zones.
    *   Central Processing Unit (CPU) for sensor fusion, AR projection control, and communication.
*   **Central Control System:**
    *   Receives RFID proximity data, ultrasonic mapping data, and robot/worker positions.
    *   Dynamically calculates and defines virtual work zones (outer, intermediate, inner) around each worker.
    *   Transmits zone definitions to robots and worker vests.
*   **AR Projection System:** Projects colored light patterns onto the floor defining the outer, intermediate, and inner work zones around the worker. Colors change based on zone (e.g., yellow = outer, orange = intermediate, red = inner).

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Central Control System Loop
while (true) {
    // Receive RFID, Ultrasonic, and Position Data
    rfidData = receiveRFIDData();
    ultrasonicData = receiveUltrasonicData();
    workerPosition = receiveWorkerPosition();
    robotPosition = receiveRobotPosition();

    // Calculate Virtual Work Zones (Outer, Intermediate, Inner)
    outerZone = calculateOuterZone(workerPosition);
    intermediateZone = calculateIntermediateZone(workerPosition);
    innerZone = calculateInnerZone(workerPosition);

    // Send Zone Definitions to Robots & Worker Vest
    sendZoneDefinitions(robots, outerZone, intermediateZone, innerZone);
    sendZoneDefinitions(workerVest, outerZone, intermediateZone, innerZone);

    // Robot Processing Loop (Each Robot)
    while (true) {
        // Receive Zone Definitions from Central Control
        zoneData = receiveZoneData();

        // Check for Zone Violations
        if (robotPosition crosses outerZone) {
            // Activate haptic actuators on robot exterior corresponding to zone violation
            activateHaptic(outerZone);
            // Slow down robot speed
            slowDown(0.5);
        }
        if (robotPosition crosses intermediateZone) {
            // Activate haptic actuators on robot exterior
            activateHaptic(intermediateZone);
            // Reduce robot speed further
            slowDown(0.25);
        }
        if (robotPosition crosses innerZone) {
            // Activate haptic actuators on robot exterior
            activateHaptic(innerZone);
            // Stop robot
            stop();
        }
    }

    // Worker Vest Processing
    // Haptic feedback mirrored from robot actions based on zone crossing
}
```

**Innovation Details:**

*   **Proactive vs. Reactive:** Shifts from reacting to RFID proximity to *anticipating* potential collisions through dynamic zone definitions.
*   **Multi-Sensory Feedback:** Combines visual (AR projection) and haptic feedback for enhanced worker and robot awareness.
*   **Collaborative Workspace:** Encourages safe and efficient collaboration by clearly defining personal work zones.
*   **Scalability:** Can be expanded to include multiple workers and robots simultaneously.
*   **Adaptive Zones:** Zone sizes can be adjusted based on worker tasks, robot speed, and environmental factors.
