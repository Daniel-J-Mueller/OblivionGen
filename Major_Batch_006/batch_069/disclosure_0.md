## Dynamic Environment Mapping with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Expand upon trajectory prediction by incorporating a probabilistic map of *potential* occlusions within the environment. This allows the autonomous vehicle to not only predict *where* a dynamic object will be, but *when* and *for how long* it might obstruct sensor views, influencing path planning and safety protocols.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Suite:** Existing suite (LiDAR, cameras, radar) + Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors strategically positioned to capture depth data for non-visible areas.
2.  **Data Input:** Real-time feeds from all sensors. Historical data logs of environmental layouts (static obstacles) and previously observed dynamic object behaviors.
3.  **Occlusion Probability Map (OPM):**
    *   A 3D volumetric grid representing the environment.
    *   Each grid cell contains:
        *   Static Obstruction Status (Boolean – is this space permanently blocked?).
        *   Dynamic Occlusion Probability (0.0 – 1.0) – probability that a dynamic object will *occlude* this space at a given time.
        *   Occlusion Duration Estimate (seconds) – predicted length of the occlusion.
        *   Last Updated Timestamp
4.  **OPM Generation/Update Algorithm:**
    *   **Initialization:** Static obstructions are mapped based on historical data/current sensor readings. Dynamic occlusion probabilities are initialized low (e.g., 0.05).
    *   **Dynamic Update Loop (executed at high frequency – e.g., 10Hz):**
        *   **Trajectory Prediction Integration:** Utilize existing dynamic object trajectory prediction from the core patent.
        *   **Visibility Analysis:** For each dynamic object:
            *   Simulate the object’s movement along its predicted trajectory.
            *   Cast rays from the autonomous vehicle’s sensors, checking for intersections with the simulated object.
            *   If a ray is blocked, increment the Dynamic Occlusion Probability in the corresponding grid cells.
        *   **Occlusion Duration Estimation:** Based on the object’s speed and predicted trajectory, estimate how long the occlusion will last. Update Occlusion Duration Estimate.
        *   **Probability Decay:** Over time, if no occlusion is detected, decay the Dynamic Occlusion Probability to prevent false positives. (Exponential decay recommended).
        *   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate ToF data to confirm or refute potential occlusions predicted by the algorithm.
5.  **Path Planning Integration:**
    *   **Cost Function Modification:** Integrate OPM data into the path planning cost function. Higher Dynamic Occlusion Probability = higher cost. This encourages the vehicle to avoid areas with potentially obstructed views.
    *   **Predictive Safety Zone:** Expand the traditional safety zone around dynamic objects to account for predicted occlusion. If a predicted occlusion will block the view of a dynamic object shortly, increase the safety distance.
6.  **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    // Main Loop
    For each time step:
        // Update OPM
        For each dynamic object:
            predicted_trajectory = predictTrajectory(object)
            For each grid cell in OPM:
                if rayIntersects(sensor, grid_cell, predicted_trajectory):
                    OPM[grid_cell].dynamic_occlusion_probability += increment
                    OPM[grid_cell].occlusion_duration_estimate = estimateDuration(object)
                else:
                    OPM[grid_cell].dynamic_occlusion_probability -= decay_rate

        // Path Planning
        path = planPath(goal, OPM)
    ```

7.  **Hardware Requirements:** Increased processing power for real-time simulation and OPM updates. Dedicated GPU acceleration recommended. ToF sensors.
8.  **Potential Benefits:** Improved safety in dynamic environments. More robust path planning. Enhanced ability to anticipate and react to unforeseen obstacles. Allows for more ‘aggressive’ navigation while maintaining a high level of safety.
