## Dynamic Highlight Reel Generation via Emotional Resonance Mapping

**Concept:** Automatically generate highlight reels not just based on *what* happens in a video, but *how* the audience emotionally reacts to it. This goes beyond simple action detection to create truly engaging and personalized experiences.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Multimodal Input:**
    *   Video Content: Standard video feed.
    *   Biometric Data (Optional): Real-time data from viewers (heart rate, facial expressions, brainwave activity – via wearables/cameras). This data is *not* required, but significantly enhances performance. The system must function *without* this input, falling back to audio/visual cues.
    *   Audio Input: Analyze audio for crowd noise (intensity and type – cheering, gasps, etc.), commentary sentiment, and musical cues.
2.  **Emotional Resonance Model (ERM):**
    *   **Core:** A deep learning model (likely a recurrent neural network with attention mechanisms) trained on a massive dataset of videos labeled with emotional responses (e.g., joy, sadness, excitement, tension).  The dataset *must* include variations in cultural expression of emotion.
    *   **Input:** Processed video frames, audio features, and (if available) biometric data.
    *   **Output:** A temporal map of emotional intensity and type throughout the video. The map represents the ‘emotional arc’ of the content.  Each frame is assigned an emotional profile: `[joy: 0.2, excitement: 0.7, tension: 0.1]`.
3.  **Highlight Segment Selection Algorithm:**
    *   **Peak Detection:** Identify frames/segments where the emotional intensity exceeds a dynamic threshold. The threshold adapts based on the overall emotional ‘baseline’ of the video.
    *   **Diversity Penalty:** Encourage selection of diverse highlight segments.  Prevent repeated segments with similar emotional profiles from being included in quick succession.
    *   **Narrative Cohesion:**  Ensure that selected segments, when concatenated, form a coherent narrative. This can be achieved by analyzing the transitions between segments and favoring smooth transitions.
    *   **User Preference Integration:** If user viewing history or stated preferences are available, weight the selection algorithm towards segments that align with those preferences.
4.  **Dynamic Editing Engine:**
    *   **Automatic Cut Selection:** Based on the selected segments, automatically determine optimal cut points to create a fast-paced, engaging highlight reel.
    *   **Music Synchronization:**  Select and synchronize music tracks that complement the emotional arc of the highlight reel.
    *   **Visual Effects Integration:** Apply visual effects (e.g., slow motion, zoom, color grading) to enhance the impact of key moments.
5.  **Output:**  A dynamically generated highlight reel in a standard video format.  Output resolution and bitrate should be configurable.

**Pseudocode (Highlight Segment Selection Algorithm):**

```
function select_highlights(video, emotional_map, user_preferences, max_length):
  highlights = []
  current_time = 0
  while current_time < video.duration and len(highlights) < max_length:
    # Find segment with highest emotional score within a sliding window
    best_segment = find_best_segment(video, emotional_map, current_time, window_size)

    # Apply diversity penalty
    diversity_score = calculate_diversity_score(best_segment, highlights)
    adjusted_score = best_segment.score * diversity_score

    # Check if segment meets minimum score threshold
    if adjusted_score > min_score_threshold:
      highlights.append(best_segment)
      current_time = best_segment.end_time
    else:
      current_time += step_size  # Move to the next segment

  return highlights
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple event detection to focus on *emotional impact*. By mapping emotional resonance and using that data to drive highlight reel generation, it creates a more engaging and personalized experience for the viewer.  The integration of biometric data (optional) offers a level of personalization not currently available in existing systems.
