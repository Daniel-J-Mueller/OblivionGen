## Adaptive Group Behavior Prediction & Proactive Resource Allocation

**System Overview:** This system builds upon the group entry/association concept by proactively anticipating group needs *within* the facility based on observed behavior and pre-defined profiles. It moves beyond simply charging a single account to offering a dynamically adjusted experience.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Sensor Network:**  A mesh network of sensors (cameras with pose estimation, weight sensors in flooring, RFID/Bluetooth beacons) track group movement, dwell time in specific areas, interactions with displays/objects, and potentially even biometric data (heart rate, facial expression analysis - opt-in only).
2.  **Group Profile Database:** Stores pre-defined profiles (e.g., “Family with young children,” “Construction Crew,” “Museum Tour Group”) containing expected behaviors, resource needs (wheelchairs, safety equipment, maps, guided tours, restrooms), and spending patterns. Profiles can be created manually or generated algorithmically from historical data.  Initial profile selection is tied to the group entry indication, but refined dynamically.
3.  **Predictive Analytics Engine:**  An AI model that analyzes real-time sensor data, compares it to the group profile, and predicts future needs/activities. This goes beyond simple location tracking. For example, if a group spends an extended time looking at children’s exhibits, the system predicts a high probability of a visit to the gift shop or a need for a family restroom.
4.  **Dynamic Resource Allocation System:**  Controls facility resources (digital signage, lighting, HVAC, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), inventory availability) to proactively meet predicted needs.
5.  **Personalized Notification System:** Provides tailored information to group members via a mobile app or facility-provided devices.  Notifications might include directions to points of interest, safety warnings, special offers, or assistance requests.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Resource Allocation:**

```
// Initialize Group Profile (based on entry indication)
groupProfile = getGroupProfile(entryIndication)

// Main Loop - runs continuously while group is within facility
while (groupDetected()) {
    sensorData = collectSensorData() // Cameras, weight sensors, beacons etc.
    behaviorAnalysis = analyzeBehavior(sensorData, groupProfile)
    predictedNeeds = predictNeeds(behaviorAnalysis)

    // Resource allocation based on predicted needs
    if (predictedNeeds.requiresWheelchair) {
        allocateWheelchair(groupLocation)
        sendNotification(groupMembers, "Wheelchair assistance available.")
    }

    if (predictedNeeds.highProbabilityGiftShopVisit) {
        adjustGiftShopInventory(itemsOfInterest)
        displayPromotions(groupMembers, relevantItems)
    }

    if (predictedNeeds.potentialSafetyHazard) {
        displaySafetyWarning(groupLocation, hazardType)
    }

    // Update group profile based on observed behavior
    groupProfile = refineGroupProfile(sensorData, groupProfile)
}
```

**Example Scenario:**

A group enters the facility and indicates “Family with young children” on entry. The system allocates a stroller and displays directions to the family restroom on nearby digital signage. As they approach the dinosaur exhibit, the system detects extended dwell time and initiates a virtual reality experience highlighting dinosaur anatomy. A notification is sent to a parent's phone offering a discount on dinosaur-themed toys in the gift shop. As they leave, the system calculates the total cost of purchases and applies it to the designated account.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple group association and account management to create a dynamically adjusted facility experience.  The proactive resource allocation and personalized notifications, driven by real-time behavioral analysis, offer a level of customer service and operational efficiency not currently available. It essentially transforms the facility into a responsive, intelligent environment tailored to the specific needs of each group.
