## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction via Phase-Shifted Temporal Echo Mapping

**Concept:** Utilize the phase rotation detection from the source patent not for echo *cancellation*, but for reconstructing a dynamic, multi-layered acoustic scene map. Instead of treating phase shifts as a problem to be solved, embrace them as data points defining spatial relationships and temporal changes within an environment.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones, spatially distributed).
*   High-resolution ADC (minimum 24-bit, 96kHz sampling rate).
*   Dedicated DSP/FPGA for real-time processing.
*   Storage capacity for acoustic scene map data (minimum 1TB SSD).

**II. Software Components:**

1.  **Phase-Shifted Temporal Echo Mapper (PSTEM):** Core algorithm.
    *   **Input:** Multi-channel audio stream.
    *   **Process:**
        *   For each microphone pair, calculate inter-channel phase differences over short time windows (e.g., 10ms).
        *   Track the *rate of change* of these phase differences over time, similar to the phase rotation detection in the source patent.
        *   Establish “echo vectors” representing the direction and magnitude of these phase shifts. This is where the existing phase rotation tech inspires the new innovation.
        *   Map these echo vectors onto a 3D spatial grid (acoustic scene map). The map updates in real-time.
        *   Utilize a Kalman filter to smooth the map and predict future echo vector locations.
        *   Implement a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate sound propagation within the mapped environment.
2.  **Source Localization Module:** Identifies and tracks stationary or moving sound sources within the acoustic scene map.
    *   Utilize beamforming techniques to focus on specific areas within the map.
    *   Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks) to classify sound source types (speech, music, environmental sounds).
3.  **Acoustic Event Detection Module:** Identifies and classifies transient acoustic events (e.g., door slams, glass breaking, footsteps).
    *   Utilize spectral analysis and machine learning to recognize event signatures.
    *   Correlate event detections with source locations within the acoustic scene map.
4.  **Rendering Engine:**
    *   Visualizes the acoustic scene map as a 3D model.
    *   Displays source locations, event detections, and sound propagation paths.
    *   Allows for interactive exploration of the acoustic environment.

**III. Algorithm Pseudocode (PSTEM Core):**

```pseudocode
// Input: Multi-channel audio stream (audioChannels[])
// Output: 3D Acoustic Scene Map (acousticMap[][])

function createAcousticMap(audioChannels[]) {
  acousticMap = initialize3DGrid()

  for each timeFrame in audioStream {
    for each microphonePair in microphoneArray {
      phaseDifference = calculatePhaseDifference(microphonePair, timeFrame)
      phaseShiftRate = calculatePhaseShiftRate(phaseDifference, previousPhaseDifference)

      //Determine Echo Vector (direction, magnitude) from phase shift rate
      echoVector = calculateEchoVector(phaseShiftRate)

      //Update Acoustic Map based on Echo Vector
      updateMap(acousticMap, echoVector)

      //Kalman Filter Prediction
      predictedMap = kalmanFilter(acousticMap)
    }
    previousPhaseDifference = phaseDifference //store previous data
  }
  return predictedMap
}
```

**IV. Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Surveillance Systems:** Create detailed acoustic maps of environments for improved intrusion detection and event analysis.
*   **Virtual/Augmented Reality:** Generate realistic acoustic environments for immersive VR/AR experiences.
*   **Smart Home Automation:**  Enable context-aware automation based on acoustic events and source locations.
*   **Robotics:**  Provide robots with an "acoustic sense" of their surroundings for navigation and object manipulation.
*   **Acoustic Microscopy:** Reconstruct 3D acoustic models of objects based on reflected sound waves.
