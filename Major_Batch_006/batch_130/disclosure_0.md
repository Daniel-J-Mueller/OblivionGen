## Dynamic Contextual Stitching for Multi-Source Video

**Concept:** Expand upon the location/time-based stitching to incorporate *semantic* understanding of video content. Instead of merely aligning clips geographically and temporally, the system intelligently stitches based on *events* occurring within the video, regardless of precise location or time synchronization. This allows for the creation of coherent narratives from disparate sources – think bodycam footage intersecting with drone surveillance, or multiple citizen reports of the same incident.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Event Contextualizer.
*   **Input:** Multiple video streams (live or pre-recorded), associated metadata (timestamps, location if available).
*   **Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Scene Decomposition:** Each video stream is broken down into individual "scenes" – segments with consistent action, camera angle, and visual elements.
    2.  **Event Detection & Categorization:** AI models identify and categorize events within each scene (e.g., "person falls", "vehicle collision", "fire starts").  Confidence scores are assigned to each event.
    3.  **Semantic Graph Construction:** A knowledge graph is built, representing events as nodes and relationships between events as edges.  Edges can represent temporal sequence, spatial proximity (if location data is available), or causal relationships (inferred by the AI).
    4.  **Contextual Stitching Algorithm:** This algorithm traverses the semantic graph, identifying points of high connectivity – events that are semantically linked across multiple video streams.  It then attempts to stitch together corresponding scenes, prioritizing smooth transitions and coherent narrative flow.
    5.  **Output:**  A composite video stream, stitched together from multiple sources, presenting a unified view of the event.  Metadata indicating source video for each segment is included.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION StitchVideoStreams(videoStreams, semanticGraph):
    compositeVideo = []
    currentSegment = videoStreams[0].firstSegment  // Start with the first segment
    
    WHILE currentSegment IS NOT NULL:
        bestMatch = NULL
        highestConfidence = 0

        FOR EACH videoStream IN videoStreams:
            IF videoStream != currentSegment.source:
                potentialMatch = videoStream.findNextSegmentMatching(currentSegment, semanticGraph)  // Uses semantic graph to find best match
                
                IF potentialMatch.confidence > highestConfidence:
                    highestConfidence = potentialMatch.confidence
                    bestMatch = potentialMatch
        
        IF bestMatch IS NOT NULL AND highestConfidence > threshold:  // Threshold for acceptable match quality
            compositeVideo.append(currentSegment)
            compositeVideo.append(bestMatch)
            currentSegment = bestMatch.nextSegment
        ELSE:
            compositeVideo.append(currentSegment)
            currentSegment = currentSegment.nextSegment
    
    RETURN compositeVideo
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure (GPUs for AI processing).
*   Large-scale data storage for video and semantic graph data.
*   AI models for object detection, event recognition, and scene understanding (pre-trained models are preferred).
*   Real-time video processing pipeline.
*   Software libraries for video editing and compositing.
