## Dynamic API Composition via Graph Neural Networks

**Concept:** Extend the existing API proxy system to *compose* new APIs on-the-fly, based on user request context and real-time backend API availability/performance. This moves beyond simple mapping to true API orchestration and allows for adaptation to changing backend landscapes.

**Specifications:**

**1. API Dependency Graph:**

*   Maintain a directed graph representing all known backend APIs and their dependencies (data flow, prerequisite APIs). Nodes are APIs, edges define relationships.
*   Edge weights represent data transformation costs, latency, reliability scores.
*   The graph is constantly updated through monitoring and discovery processes.

**2. Request Context Encoding:**

*   Incoming user requests are analyzed to extract relevant context features (user role, data types requested, time of day, location, etc.).
*   These features are embedded into a vector representation using a learned embedding model.

**3. Graph Neural Network (GNN) for API Path Selection:**

*   A GNN is trained to predict optimal API execution paths through the dependency graph, given the request context vector and current graph state (performance, availability).
*   The GNN takes the request context vector and the graph structure as input.
*   Node and edge features within the GNN represent API metadata (input/output types, expected latency, cost).
*   The GNN outputs a probability distribution over possible API execution paths.

**4. Dynamic API Composition Engine:**

*   Based on the GNN's output, the engine dynamically composes a new API workflow.
*   This workflow consists of a sequence of API calls, data transformations, and conditional logic.
*   Data transformations are implemented using a configurable rule engine (e.g., based on JSONata or similar).

**5. Real-Time Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**

*   API execution is monitored in real-time.
*   Performance metrics (latency, errors) are fed back into the GNN to refine future path selection.
*   The GNN is retrained periodically or incrementally to adapt to changing backend conditions.

**Pseudocode (API Path Selection):**

```
function select_api_path(request, api_graph, gnn_model):
  request_embedding = embed_request(request)
  path_probabilities = gnn_model.predict(request_embedding, api_graph)
  best_path = argmax(path_probabilities) # Select path with highest probability
  return best_path

function embed_request(request):
  # Extract features from request (user role, data types, etc.)
  features = extract_features(request)
  # Use a trained embedding model to convert features to a vector
  embedding = embedding_model.predict(features)
  return embedding
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **API Node:** {API Name, Input Types, Output Types, Expected Latency, Cost, Dependencies}
*   **API Edge:** {Source API, Destination API, Data Transformation Function}
*   **Request Context Vector:**  A numerical vector representing the user request context.

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   GNN framework (e.g., PyTorch Geometric, DGL)
*   API Gateway integration
*   Monitoring and alerting system
*   Scalability and fault tolerance
*   Security considerations (authentication, authorization, data encryption)
