## Dynamic Shelf Zoning & Predictive Replenishment

**Concept:** Extend the planogram functionality to incorporate *dynamic* shelf zoning, driven by real-time shopper behavior and predictive analytics, to optimize not just *what* is on the shelf, but *where* on the shelf, and proactively trigger replenishment tasks.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Expand existing imaging to include weight sensors embedded in shelf surfaces (per section/zone) and low-power Bluetooth beacons for proximity detection of mobile devices (customer smartphones).
*   **Zoning Algorithm:** Divide each shelf into multiple zones (e.g., 3x3 grid). Algorithm dynamically adjusts zone assignments based on:
    *   **Historical Sales Data:** Which items sell best in which locations.
    *   **Real-time Weight Data:** Detects weight decreases indicating items taken (confirms image data) and can *estimate* quantity removed.
    *   **Proximity Data:** Identifies customer dwell time near specific zones.  Longer dwell times suggest interest or difficulty finding an item.
    *   **Demographic Data (Opt-In):** If customers opt-in to location services, demographics can be used to personalize zone assignments (e.g., displaying baby products higher on shelves when families with young children are nearby).
*   **Predictive Replenishment:**
    *   Algorithm analyzes real-time sales, weight, proximity, and historical data to predict when a zone will be empty.
    *   Automated task generation for replenishment:  Alerts staff or robotic systems to restock specific zones.
    *   Prioritization: Replenishment tasks prioritized based on predicted sales impact and customer dwell time.
*   **Planogram Adaptation:** The system *automatically* updates the planogram based on dynamic zoning adjustments. This isn't just about *seeing* what's on the shelf; itâ€™s about *influencing* shelf layout based on real-time data.
*   **User Interface:** A dashboard displaying:
    *   Real-time shelf zone activity (heatmaps of customer interaction).
    *   Predicted stock-out times.
    *   Active replenishment tasks.
    *   Automated planogram updates.
*   **Data Storage:** A time-series database optimized for high-frequency sensor data.
*   **API Integration:** An API for integration with existing inventory management systems and robotic replenishment platforms.

**Pseudocode (Replenishment Prediction):**

```
FUNCTION predict_replenishment(zone_id)
    // Fetch historical sales data for zone_id
    sales_history = GET_SALES_HISTORY(zone_id)

    // Fetch current weight data for zone_id
    current_weight = GET_WEIGHT(zone_id)

    // Fetch proximity data (dwell time) for zone_id
    dwell_time = GET_DWELL_TIME(zone_id)

    // Calculate predicted depletion rate based on historical data, current weight, and dwell time
    depletion_rate = CALCULATE_DEPLETION_RATE(sales_history, current_weight, dwell_time)

    // Predict time to empty
    time_to_empty = current_weight / depletion_rate

    // Trigger replenishment task if time_to_empty is below threshold
    IF time_to_empty < replenishment_threshold THEN
        CREATE_REPLENISHMENT_TASK(zone_id)
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on *detecting* stock-outs. This extends functionality to *predict* stock-outs and proactively adjust shelf layout *before* they occur, optimizing not just inventory, but customer engagement.  The combination of weight sensors, proximity detection, and dynamic zoning provides a more granular and responsive system.
