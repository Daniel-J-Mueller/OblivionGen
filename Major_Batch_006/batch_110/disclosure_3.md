## Dynamic Resolution Scaling with Per-Object Precision

**Concept:** Extend the integer-scaling approach to enable *dynamic* resolution scaling, not just for the overall image, but on a per-object basis *within* the image. This allows prioritizing detail where it matters most (e.g., faces) while reducing computational load on less critical areas.

**Specifications:**

**1. Object Segmentation Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw image data.
*   **Output:** Semantic segmentation map identifying distinct objects within the image (e.g., person, car, building, sky). Output should include confidence scores for each segmentation.
*   **Technology:** Utilize a lightweight, real-time semantic segmentation network (e.g., MobileNetV3-based architecture). Edge TPU acceleration highly desirable.

**2. Per-Object Scaling Factor Assignment:**

*   **Input:** Raw image, segmentation map, user-defined priority levels (optional).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each identified object, assign a scaling factor based on:
        *   **Object Type:**  Pre-defined scaling priority (e.g., Faces = High, Background = Low).
        *   **Object Size:** Smaller objects may receive higher scaling to enhance visibility.
        *   **Distance from Camera:** Objects further away may receive lower scaling.
        *   **User Input:** Allow manual adjustment of scaling factors via an interface.
*   **Output:** Per-object scaling factor map.

**3.  Multi-Scale Image Warping Engine:**

*   **Input:** Raw image, per-object scaling factor map.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each object:
        *   Extract the objectâ€™s bounding box coordinates.
        *   Apply a localized scaling operation to the region within the bounding box using the assigned scaling factor. This operation must utilize the integer-scaling methods (conversion factors) outlined in the provided patent.
        *   Warp the scaled object region seamlessly back into the original image. Edge blending is critical to avoid artifacts.
*   **Output:** Dynamically scaled image.

**4.  Integer Conversion Factor Optimization:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Implement a dynamic adjustment of the conversion factors (first & second) based on the assigned scaling factor for each object.
    *   If the scaling factor is very small, the conversion factor can be increased to maximize detail preservation.
    *   If the scaling factor is large, the conversion factor can be decreased to reduce computational cost.
*   **Output:** Optimized conversion factors for each object.

**5.  Hardware Acceleration:**

*   Utilize an ASIC (as outlined in the provided patent) with dedicated processing units for:
    *   Semantic segmentation.
    *   Integer-based scaling and warping.
    *   Edge blending.
*   Parallelize operations to achieve real-time performance.

**Pseudocode (Multi-Scale Image Warping Engine):**

```
function warpImage(image, segmentationMap, scalingFactors):
  for each object in segmentationMap:
    boundingBox = object.boundingBox
    scalingFactor = scalingFactors[object.id]

    // Extract object region
    objectRegion = image.extractRegion(boundingBox)

    // Scale object region using integer-based scaling (as in patent)
    scaledObjectRegion = scaleRegion(objectRegion, scalingFactor)

    // Warp scaled region back into image
    image.replaceRegion(boundingBox, scaledObjectRegion)

  return image
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Mobile photography/videography: Enhance face detail while reducing overall image resolution.
*   Autonomous vehicles: Prioritize detail on nearby objects (pedestrians, cars) while reducing detail on distant objects.
*   AR/VR: Optimize rendering performance by dynamically scaling objects based on viewing distance and importance.
