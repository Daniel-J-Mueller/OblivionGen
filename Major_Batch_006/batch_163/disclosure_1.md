**Dynamic Predictive Panorama Stitching with Generative Fill**

**Concept:** Extend panoramic video beyond the capture device’s immediate field of view by *predictively* generating content ‘around’ the captured panorama, creating a seamless, virtually limitless environment. This leverages generative AI to fill in areas *outside* the original capture, based on contextual understanding of the scene.

**Specs:**

1.  **Input:** Panoramic video stream (at least 180 degrees) + depth map (generated via stereo capture, or estimated via AI). Current system’s angle indicators (first and second indicators – direction & object) used as anchors.
2.  **Scene Understanding Module:**
    *   AI-powered object detection and scene segmentation.
    *   Semantic mapping: identifies ground plane, sky, buildings, vegetation, etc.
    *   Dynamic lighting analysis: understands light direction, intensity, and color.
3.  **Predictive Generation Engine:**
    *   Generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, specialized model trained on panoramic data).
    *   Contextual prompting:
        *   Uses semantic map to generate scene-consistent content.
        *   Incorporates depth map for realistic occlusion and perspective.
        *   Dynamically adjusts to user’s gaze direction (tracked via head/eye tracking) and the position of the second indicator. Prioritizes generation *around* the current view and object of interest.
        *   Utilizes the existing angle indicators to maintain visual consistency with the captured panorama.
    *   Content blending: Seamlessly integrates generated content with the captured panorama using advanced blending techniques.
4.  **Dynamic Stitching Algorithm:**
    *   Real-time rendering pipeline.
    *   Prioritizes generating content *just* outside the current field of view.  Content is discarded as it moves outside the user's perception.
    *   Adaptive resolution:  Lower resolution for distant generated content, higher resolution for content close to the user.
5.  **User Interface Integration:**
    *   A ‘Generation Radius’ slider to control how far the AI generates content.
    *   A ‘Coherence’ slider to balance realism and creative freedom.
    *   An option to prioritize object persistence. The tracked object (second indicator) will always be ‘filled in’ even if it goes outside the original capture.
    *   Option to seed the generated panorama with user-provided images or styles.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (videoStreamAvailable) {
    frame = getVideoFrame();
    depthMap = getDepthMap();
    userGazeDirection = getUserGazeDirection();
    trackedObjectPosition = getTrackedObjectPosition();

    // Scene Understanding
    sceneMap = analyzeScene(frame, depthMap);

    // Predictive Generation
    generatedContent = generateContent(sceneMap, userGazeDirection, trackedObjectPosition);

    // Stitching
    stitchedPanorama = stitch(frame, generatedContent);

    // Display
    displayPanorama(stitchedPanorama);
}
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond simply displaying a captured panorama to *actively expanding* the environment, providing an infinitely explorable space without the limitations of physical capture. The combination of predictive AI, dynamic stitching, and user-controlled parameters will create a truly immersive and engaging experience.
