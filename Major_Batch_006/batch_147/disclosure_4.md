## Adaptive Packet Shaping via Predictive Congestion Modeling

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple latency and packet loss metrics to *predict* congestion before it impacts user experience. This system actively shapes packets *before* transmission based on learned network behavior and predicted bottlenecks.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Congestion Engine (PCE)**:  A machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network preferred, trained on time-series data of network performance) that resides on the virtual private gateway (as described in the patent).
    *   **Inputs:** Historical and real-time metrics: latency, packet loss, bandwidth usage, queue depths (if available via sFlow/NetFlow), TCP window sizes, and potentially even application-layer data (if consent is given and data is anonymized).
    *   **Outputs:**  A "Congestion Prediction Score" (CPS) for each outgoing packet, ranging from 0 (no congestion predicted) to 1 (severe congestion predicted).  Also outputs a recommended “Shaping Profile” (see Component 3).
*   **Component 2:  Real-Time Network Observer (RNO)**:  Constantly monitors network conditions and feeds data to the PCE. This builds on existing monitoring capabilities.
    *   **Data Collection:**  sFlow/NetFlow, TCP statistics, ICMP probes, and potentially application-level telemetry.
    *   **Data Preprocessing:**  Noise reduction, outlier detection, and data normalization.
*   **Component 3:  Adaptive Packet Shaper (APS)**:  Located within the virtual private gateway. It acts on the recommendations from the PCE.
    *   **Shaping Profiles:** Predefined sets of packet modification rules. Examples:
        *   *Profile 1 (Low CPS):*  No modification.
        *   *Profile 2 (Medium CPS):*  TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) prioritization. Increase SACK frequency to more efficiently retransmit lost packets. Reduce TCP Window Size to alleviate congestion.
        *   *Profile 3 (High CPS):*  Delay non-critical packets (e.g., ACK packets or packets from low-priority applications).  Implement Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking.  Consider rate limiting.
    *   **Packet Modification Capabilities:**
        *   DSCP marking.
        *   TCP header manipulation (window size, SACK options).
        *   Packet delaying/queuing.
        *   (With proper authorization) Application-layer prioritization.
*   **Training Data**: Initially trained on synthetic network traffic patterns, then continuously retrained on live network data collected from multiple VPN connections. Federated Learning may be used to share knowledge between VPN gateways without sharing raw data.

**Pseudocode (APS):**

```
function processPacket(packet):
  cps = PCE.getCongestionPredictionScore(packet)
  shapingProfile = PCE.getShapingProfile(cps)

  if shapingProfile == "Profile 1":
    return packet // No modification

  if shapingProfile == "Profile 2":
    // Prioritize SACKs, reduce TCP window
    modifyPacket(packet, prioritizeSACK=True, reduceTCPWindow=True)
    return packet

  if shapingProfile == "Profile 3":
    // Delay non-critical packets
    if isCriticalPacket(packet) == False:
      delayPacket(packet, delayTime = calculateDelayTime(packet))
    return packet

  //Default profile
  return packet
```

**Novelty:**  Existing VPN solutions primarily react to congestion. This system proactively *predicts* and *shapes* traffic *before* congestion occurs, improving user experience and potentially reducing overall network load.  The use of machine learning to dynamically adjust shaping profiles based on learned network behavior is also innovative.
