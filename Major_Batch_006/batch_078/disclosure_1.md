## Modular Ring System - Biofeedback & Haptic Communication

**Concept:** A ring-based modular system allowing users to dynamically configure functionality via swappable “cores” and “shells”. The core handles processing and power, while the shell dictates form factor and primary input/output. Focus: Biofeedback data collection & nuanced haptic communication.

**Core Specifications:**

*   **Dimensions:** 12mm diameter, 4mm height.
*   **Processor:** ARM Cortex-M7 (or equivalent) - low power, sufficient processing for sensor data & haptic control.
*   **Memory:** 64MB RAM, 128MB Flash.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.2 LE.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable solid-state battery (20mAh capacity, Qi wireless charging capable). Estimated 24-hour runtime with moderate use.
*   **Sensors (Integrated):**
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) - Heart rate, heart rate variability, blood oxygen saturation.
    *   Skin Conductance (GSR) - Stress/arousal level.
    *   3-axis Accelerometer/Gyroscope - Motion tracking.
    *   Temperature Sensor - Skin temperature.
*   **Interface:** Magnetic connector for shell attachment.  Data transfer via Bluetooth.

**Shell Specifications (Examples - Modular/Swappable):**

1.  **“Sense” Shell:**
    *   Material: Medical-grade silicone.
    *   Features: Optimized sensor contact points.  Tactile feedback via miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) for subtle alerts (e.g., heartbeat synchronization, stress level indication).
    *   Haptic Profiles: Pre-programmed haptic patterns for different biofeedback states. User-customizable patterns via companion app.
2.  **“Comm” Shell:**
    *   Material: Titanium alloy.
    *   Features: Miniature bone conduction transducer for discreet audio alerts/communication.  Integrated microphone for voice commands/communication.
    *   Haptic Profiles: Patterned vibrations to indicate incoming calls/messages.
3.  **“Control” Shell:**
    *   Material: Polymer with textured grip.
    *   Features: Capacitive touch surface for gesture control. Customizable gestures mapped to app functions. Integrated vibration motor for confirmation/alerts.
4. **“Artisan” Shell:**
    * Material: User-definable - 3D printable materials, precious metals, etc.
    * Features: No integrated sensors/actuators. Purely aesthetic/customization. Allows users to create completely personalized ring appearances.

**Software/Companion App Features:**

*   Real-time biofeedback data visualization.
*   Customizable haptic profiles linked to biofeedback data (e.g., slow, rhythmic vibration during low stress, faster vibration during high stress).
*   Gesture customization for “Control” shell.
*   Firmware updates via Bluetooth.
*   API for third-party app integration.
*   Data logging and export capabilities.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Loop):**

```
// Main Loop

while (running) {
  // Read sensor data from Core
  heartRate = readHeartRate()
  stressLevel = readStressLevel()

  // Determine haptic pattern based on sensor data
  if (stressLevel > thresholdHigh) {
    hapticPattern = "RapidPulse"
  } else if (stressLevel > thresholdMedium) {
    hapticPattern = "GentleWave"
  } else {
    hapticPattern = "SlowRhythm"
  }

  // Activate haptic actuator on Shell with selected pattern
  playHaptic(hapticPattern)

  // Delay for a short period
  delay(50ms)
}
```

**Innovation Focus:** Moving beyond simple activity tracking, this system leverages biofeedback data to *actively influence* the user’s state through subtle haptic communication. The modular design allows for highly personalized and evolving functionality.
