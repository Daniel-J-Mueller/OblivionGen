## Dynamic Quorum Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the quorum system by incorporating behavioral biometrics as a dynamic factor influencing quorum requirements. Instead of a static number of signatures, the system adjusts the necessary quorum size based on real-time risk assessment derived from user behavior.

**Specifications:**

*   **Biometric Data Collection:** Integrate sensors (keyboard dynamics, mouse movements, gait analysis via device sensors, voice analysis, etc.) to establish baseline behavioral profiles for each potential signatory. Data is collected passively during normal operation and used solely for risk assessment – *not* for direct identification.
*   **Risk Scoring Engine:** Develop a real-time risk scoring engine that analyzes deviations from established behavioral profiles. Factors include typing speed/rhythm, mouse movement patterns, hesitation/pauses, voice stress, location anomalies (using geofencing), and time of day. The engine outputs a risk score ranging from 0 (low risk) to 100 (high risk).
*   **Dynamic Quorum Adjustment:** The access manager dynamically adjusts the required quorum size based on the calculated risk score.
    *   **Low Risk (0-30):** Quorum = 1 (standard authentication).
    *   **Medium Risk (31-60):** Quorum = 2-3 (increased scrutiny).
    *   **High Risk (61-100):** Quorum = 4+ (significant scrutiny, potentially involving multi-factor authentication & escalation).
*   **Quorum Rule Definition:**  Administrators define “quorum profiles” that map risk score ranges to specific quorum requirements. These profiles can be tailored to the sensitivity of the resource being accessed.
*   **Notification System Enhancement:** The notification system transmits the *current* quorum requirement to potential signatories, along with the reason for the increased scrutiny (e.g., "Unusual activity detected.  Additional authorization required.").
*   **Audit Logging:** Expand audit logs to include behavioral risk scores, the dynamic quorum size used, and details of any observed anomalous behavior.
*   **Integration with Existing Systems:**  Designed to operate as a layer *in front* of existing authentication and authorization mechanisms, requiring minimal disruption to existing infrastructure.

**Pseudocode (Access Manager Logic):**

```
function handleAccessRequest(request):
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(request.user)
  quorumSize = determineQuorumSize(riskScore)
  
  if quorumSize == 1:
    // Standard authentication flow
    grantAccess(request)
    return
  
  // Quorum-based authorization
  sendNotifications(request, quorumSize)
  waitForSignatures(request, quorumSize)
  
  if signaturesReceived >= quorumSize:
    grantAccess(request)
  else:
    denyAccess(request)
```

**Potential Downstream Applications:**

*   **Fraud Prevention:** Significantly enhance security for high-value transactions.
*   **Insider Threat Detection:** Identify compromised accounts or malicious activity.
*   **Adaptive Access Control:** Provide a more granular and responsive security posture.
*   **Zero Trust Architectures:** Contribute to a more robust and dynamic security model.
