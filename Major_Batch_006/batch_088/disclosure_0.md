## Dynamic Environmental Mapping with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Augment the vehicle’s state prediction by creating a dynamic, predictive map of the environment, focusing on *occlusion* – what the vehicle *cannot* see. Instead of solely relying on detected objects, the system anticipates where objects might be hidden (behind buildings, trees, hills, etc.) and assigns probabilistic “occlusion volumes.” These volumes influence state prediction, particularly in situations involving sensor limitations (GPS signal loss, lidar blockage).

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution LiDAR (minimum 128 beams)
    *   Stereo Vision System (baseline > 0.5m)
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – 200Hz update rate
    *   Radar (long-range, for detecting objects through certain occlusions)
*   **Data Processing Unit:**  Dedicated GPU cluster (minimum 4x NVIDIA RTX 3090) for real-time processing.
*   **Mapping Engine:**
    *   **Octree-Based Map:**  Dynamic octree representing the 3D environment, updated continuously.  Resolution adaptive based on sensor density and predicted uncertainty.
    *   **Occlusion Volume Generation:**
        *   Raycasting: Project rays from the sensor positions through the octree.  Rays terminating within solid geometry define occlusion boundaries.
        *   Predictive Raycasting:  Estimate vehicle trajectory (based on current state prediction).  Project rays *ahead* of the vehicle along the predicted trajectory to anticipate future occlusions.
        *   Probabilistic Assignment:  Assign a confidence score to each occlusion volume based on sensor data, raycasting results, and trajectory prediction.  Higher confidence means a greater likelihood of complete obstruction.
    *   **Dynamic Cost Map:**  Overlay the occlusion volumes onto a cost map.  High-cost areas represent regions with significant occlusion and potential for state prediction error.
*   **State Prediction Integration:**
    *   **Kalman Filtering Modification:**  Augment the Kalman filter state vector with the occlusion cost map. The filter considers the occlusion cost when estimating the vehicle’s state.  Regions with high occlusion cost introduce greater uncertainty in the state estimate.
    *   **Sensor Fusion Weighting:** Dynamically adjust sensor fusion weights based on occlusion. Sensors obscured by high-confidence occlusion volumes receive lower weighting in the state estimate.
    *   **Trajectory Planning Integration:**  Modify trajectory planning algorithms to avoid areas with high occlusion, particularly during critical maneuvers.

**Pseudocode (State Prediction Update):**

```
function updateStatePrediction(sensorData, current_state, occlusion_map):
  # Fuse sensor data with current state using Kalman Filter
  predicted_state = kalmanFilter(sensorData, current_state)

  # Calculate occlusion cost for the predicted state
  occlusion_cost = calculateOcclusionCost(predicted_state, occlusion_map)

  # Adjust Kalman Filter covariance matrix based on occlusion cost
  covariance_matrix = adjustCovariance(covariance_matrix, occlusion_cost)

  # Update state estimate with adjusted covariance
  new_state = kalmanFilterUpdate(predicted_state, sensorData, covariance_matrix)

  return new_state
```

**Novelty:** Existing error correction systems react to errors *after* they occur. This system proactively anticipates occlusion and incorporates it into the state prediction process, reducing the likelihood of error accumulation. The dynamic cost map and probabilistic occlusion volumes provide a more nuanced understanding of environmental uncertainty than simple object detection. This is not just about "seeing" what's there, it's about "knowing" what's *not* visible and accounting for that in real-time.
