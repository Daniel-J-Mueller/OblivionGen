## Automated Conflict Prediction & Resolution in Multi-Branch Development

**Concept:** Extend the version control graph analysis to *proactively* predict potential conflicts *before* merging branches, and suggest automated resolutions based on semantic code understanding, not just textual diffs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Conflict Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Version Control Graph (as defined in patent), current branch changes, target branch (where changes will be merged).
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify common changes along paths between branches (similar to patent claim 1).
    *   Analyze *semantic* changes (using a code analysis tool, see section 3) in the collected linear sequences.  Semantic changes refer to the *meaning* of the code modification, not just the lines added/deleted.
    *   Build a “Conflict Probability Score” based on:
        *   Number of overlapping semantic changes.
        *   Complexity of the changes (cyclomatic complexity, lines of code changed).
        *   History of conflicts involving the same code sections.
        *   Distance (number of commits) between common changes and current changes.
*   **Output:**  List of potentially conflicting code sections, ranked by Conflict Probability Score. Each entry includes:
    *   Conflicting Code Section Identifier (file, line numbers).
    *   Conflict Probability Score (0-100).
    *   Summary of changes in both branches.

**2. Automated Resolution Module:**

*   **Input:**  Conflicting Code Section, Summary of Changes (from Conflict Prediction), Version Control Graph.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Semantic Diff Analysis:**  Determine the *intent* of the changes in both branches. For example, is one branch refactoring code, while the other is fixing a bug?
    *   **Resolution Strategy Selection:**  Based on intent, choose a resolution strategy:
        *   **Automatic Merge:**  If changes are orthogonal (affecting different parts of the code), automatically merge.
        *   **Prioritize Bug Fixes:** If one branch contains bug fixes, prioritize those fixes.
        *   **Apply Changes Sequentially:**  Apply changes from one branch on top of the other.
        *   **Conflict Transformation:**  Modify changes to eliminate the conflict (e.g. renaming variables, restructuring code) without altering functionality.
        *   **Human Intervention Required:** If resolution is ambiguous, flag for manual review.
    *   **Resolution Validation:**  Run unit tests to ensure that the resolved code maintains functionality.
*   **Output:**  Resolved code, Unit Test Results.

**3. Code Analysis Tool Integration:**

*   Integrate with existing static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Coverity) to provide semantic understanding of the code.
*   Implement a code parsing module to extract Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) from the code.
*   Use ASTs to identify code dependencies, data flow, and potential side effects.

**4.  Version Control System Integration:**

*   Integrate with existing version control systems (e.g., Git, Mercurial).
*   Run the Conflict Prediction Engine automatically before merge requests.
*   Provide a visual interface for reviewing predicted conflicts and automated resolutions.
*   Allow users to override automated resolutions if necessary.

**Pseudocode (Conflict Prediction):**

```
function predictConflicts(branch1, branch2, versionControlGraph):
  commonChanges = findCommonChanges(branch1, branch2, versionControlGraph)
  changes1 = getChanges(branch1)
  changes2 = getChanges(branch2)

  conflicts = []
  for change1 in changes1:
    for change2 in changes2:
      if changesOverlap(change1, change2, commonChanges):
        intent1 = analyzeCodeIntent(change1)
        intent2 = analyzeCodeIntent(change2)

        conflictProbability = calculateConflictProbability(intent1, intent2)

        conflicts.append({
          "codeSection": getCodeSection(change1),
          "probability": conflictProbability
        })

  return conflicts
```
