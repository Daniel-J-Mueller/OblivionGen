## Dynamic Projection Mapping with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the gesture recognition system by incorporating localized haptic feedback projected *onto* the userâ€™s hand/selection tool, synchronized with the projected content. This creates a more immersive and intuitive interaction experience, supplementing visual feedback with tactile sensations.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing System: Depth camera, RGB camera, Projector, Processing Unit.
    *   Ultrasonic Transducer Array: A dense array of small ultrasonic transducers mounted near the projector lens. Resolution: minimum 100 transducers. Frequency Range: 20kHz - 40kHz.  Must be capable of rapidly modulating individual transducer output.
    *   Microcontroller: Dedicated microcontroller for managing transducer array and synchronization with main processing unit.
    *   Calibration Target: A known geometry for calibrating the transducer array to the projection space.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Depth Analysis Module:** (Existing) Identifies selection tool position and proximity to the projected surface.
    *   **Distortion Analysis Module:** (Existing)  Detects distortion in RGB image due to selection tool interaction.
    *   **Haptic Pattern Generation Module:** Generates ultrasonic waveforms corresponding to desired haptic sensations (e.g., texture, edges, button presses). Uses distortion data as input to determine the shape of the haptic feedback.
    *   **Transducer Control Module:** Maps haptic patterns to individual transducer activation, accounting for transducer array geometry and projection distance.
    *   **Synchronization Module:** Ensures precise timing between visual projection, depth/distortion analysis, and haptic feedback generation. Latency target: < 10ms.
*   **Operational Procedure:**
    1.  **Calibration:** System calibrates transducer array to the projection space using calibration target and depth camera data.
    2.  **Gesture Recognition:** Depth and distortion analysis modules identify selection tool position and interaction with projected content.
    3.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:** Based on interaction, the haptic pattern generation module creates a corresponding ultrasonic waveform. (Example: If user 'touches' a projected button, a localized, slightly raised 'bump' sensation is generated.)
    4.  **Transducer Activation:** The transducer control module activates specific transducers in the array to project the ultrasonic waveform onto the user's hand/selection tool, creating the desired haptic sensation.
    5.  **Feedback Loop:** The system continuously monitors the user's interaction and adjusts the haptic feedback accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(distortionData, interactionType):
  if interactionType == "buttonPress":
    hapticPattern = createCircularWave(distortionData.center, distortionData.radius * 0.5, intensity = 80%)
  elif interactionType == "sliderAdjust":
    hapticPattern = createLinearWave(distortionData.line, intensity = 60%)
  elif interactionType == "edgeTouch":
    hapticPattern = createEdgeWave(distortionData.edge, intensity = 40%)
  else:
    hapticPattern = createDefaultTexture() // Subtle vibration

  return hapticPattern
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Variable Intensity:**  Adjust haptic intensity based on user pressure (estimated from depth data) and interaction type.
*   **Texture Generation:** Create more complex haptic textures by modulating the ultrasonic waveform and activating multiple transducers.
*   **User Profiles:**  Personalize haptic feedback based on user preferences and sensory sensitivity.
*   **Multi-Point Haptic Feedback:** Support simultaneous haptic feedback for multiple fingers or selection tools.
*   **Integration with AR/VR:**  Combine haptic feedback with augmented or virtual reality displays for a more immersive experience.
