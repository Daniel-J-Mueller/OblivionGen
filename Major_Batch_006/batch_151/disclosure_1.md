## Dynamic Query Expansion with User-Specific Knowledge Graphs

**Concept:** Augment the query rewriting process with a dynamically constructed knowledge graph representing the user’s known preferences, history, and contextual information. This goes beyond simple historical query data and creates a personalized semantic understanding for more accurate rewriting.

**Specifications:**

1.  **User Knowledge Graph Construction:**
    *   Data Sources: Integrate data from various sources – previous search history, purchase history (if available and permission granted), calendar events, location data (with permission), explicitly provided preferences (e.g., “I prefer Italian restaurants”), connected app data (e.g., music streaming service preferences).
    *   Graph Structure: Use a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to represent entities (products, locations, artists, concepts) and relationships (e.g., "User likes Product A," "Location B is near User's home," "Artist C is similar to Artist D"). Relationships should be weighted based on frequency, recency, and explicit user ratings.
    *   Real-time Updates: Continuously update the graph with new user interactions in real-time. This ensures the graph reflects the user’s evolving preferences.

2.  **Query Semantic Analysis & Graph Integration:**
    *   Entity Recognition:  Upon receiving a voice query, use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key entities within the query (e.g., “Play some jazz music” – entity: “jazz music”).
    *   Graph Traversal:  Traverse the user’s knowledge graph starting from the identified entities.  The goal is to find related entities and concepts that might be relevant to the query. For example, if the user searches for "jazz music," the graph might reveal that they also frequently listen to blues and have attended concerts featuring specific jazz musicians.
    *   Semantic Enrichment:  Expand the original query with semantically related terms discovered through graph traversal. For example, the original query might become: “Play some jazz music, blues, or songs by Miles Davis.”

3.  **Rewriting & Ranking with Graph-Enhanced Data:**
    *   Alternative Generation:  Generate alternative queries using the expanded semantic space.
    *   Probability Scoring:  Use machine learning models (as described in the patent) to score the probability of each alternative query being a suitable replacement, but *incorporate graph data into the scoring function*.
        *   Graph-based Features:  Include features derived from the knowledge graph:
            *   Path Length:  Shorter paths between entities in the graph indicate stronger relationships and higher relevance.
            *   Relationship Weight:  Higher weights on relationships indicate stronger preferences.
            *   Community Detection: Identify clusters of related entities in the graph to suggest more diverse and relevant alternatives.
    *   Ranking & Selection: Rank the alternatives based on the combined scores (ML model + graph-based features) and select the highest-ranked alternative.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION rewrite_query(user_query, user_knowledge_graph):
  entities = NER(user_query)
  expanded_entities = traverse_knowledge_graph(entities, user_knowledge_graph)
  alternative_queries = generate_alternatives(user_query, expanded_entities)

  FOR each query in alternative_queries:
    ml_score = ML_model(query)
    graph_features = calculate_graph_features(query, user_knowledge_graph)
    combined_score = ml_score + graph_features // Weighted combination
    scored_queries.append((query, combined_score))

  sorted_queries = sort(scored_queries, descending=True)
  rewritten_query = sorted_queries[0].query
  RETURN rewritten_query
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Graph Database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)
*   NER Engine (spaCy, Stanford NER)
*   Machine Learning Framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
*   API for accessing user data (with appropriate privacy controls)
*   Scalable infrastructure to handle real-time graph updates and query processing.
