## Dynamic Zone of Interest with Predictive Occlusion Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the zone of interest (ZOI) functionality beyond static definition via fiducial markers. Implement a predictive occlusion mapping system that leverages depth data and object recognition to dynamically adjust the ZOI, anticipating potential obstructions and maintaining consistent tracking within the defined area.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing camera system with depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or Stereo Vision).
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time object recognition and depth map processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Fiducial Marker Detection:* Identifies and locates fiducial markers as described in the base patent. This establishes initial ZOI boundaries.
    *   *Depth Map Acquisition & Processing:* Captures depth data using the depth sensor. Processes the data to create a 3D point cloud of the scene.
    *   *Object Recognition & Segmentation:* Employs a trained AI model to identify and segment objects within the scene (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, static obstacles).
    *   *Occlusion Prediction Engine:* This module is the core innovation. It utilizes the depth map, object recognition data, and potentially historical tracking data to *predict* future occlusions within the ZOI.  This engine considers object trajectories, sizes, and speeds to determine which portions of the ZOI are likely to be obstructed in the near future.
    *   *Dynamic ZOI Adjustment:*  Based on occlusion predictions, this module dynamically adjusts the ZOI's boundaries.  It *shrinks* the ZOI to exclude areas predicted to be occluded, ensuring that tracking algorithms focus on visible regions. It *expands* the ZOI when obstructions move or disappear.
    *   *Tracking Algorithm Integration:* Seamlessly integrates with existing tracking algorithms, providing them with the dynamically adjusted ZOI as a constraint.
    *   *Historical Data Logging:* Logs historical ZOI adjustments, object movements, and occlusion events. This data is used to refine the occlusion prediction engine over time.

**Pseudocode (Occlusion Prediction Engine):**

```
FUNCTION predict_occlusion(depth_map, object_data, historical_data):

    // 1. Identify potential occluders (moving objects)
    potential_occluders = objects WHERE velocity > threshold

    // 2. Project trajectories of occluders forward in time
    predicted_positions = PROJECT(potential_occluders, time_horizon)

    // 3. Calculate occlusion masks for each predicted position
    occlusion_masks = CALCULATE_MASK(predicted_positions, depth_map)

    // 4. Combine occlusion masks to create a composite occlusion map
    composite_occlusion_map = MERGE(occlusion_masks)

    // 5. Smooth the composite occlusion map using historical data
    smoothed_occlusion_map = APPLY_FILTER(composite_occlusion_map, historical_data)

    RETURN smoothed_occlusion_map
```

**Operation:**

1.  The camera captures an image and depth map of the scene.
2.  Fiducial markers are detected to establish initial ZOI boundaries.
3.  Object recognition identifies and segments objects within the scene.
4.  The Occlusion Prediction Engine analyzes the depth map, object data, and historical data to predict future occlusions.
5.  The Dynamic ZOI Adjustment module adjusts the ZOI boundaries based on the occlusion predictions.
6.  Tracking algorithms operate within the dynamically adjusted ZOI.
7.  Historical data is logged to refine the Occlusion Prediction Engine over time.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Parking management systems with increased robustness in crowded environments.
*   Automated surveillance systems that can maintain tracking even when objects are temporarily obscured.
*   Robotics applications where reliable object tracking is critical.
*   AR/VR applications with improved occlusion handling.
