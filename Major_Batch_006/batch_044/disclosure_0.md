## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Based on Intended Viewing Distance

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This system extends the concept of dynamic UI generation based on input type and viewing distance to *also* incorporate dynamic haptic feedback on devices capable of such. The core idea is that the perceived “texture” and resistance of virtual UI elements should change based on the calculated intended viewing distance.  Closer distances should trigger finer, more detailed haptic responses, while greater distances should trigger coarser, simpler responses. This enhances the feeling of scale and immersion.

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Device with haptic feedback capabilities (e.g., advanced vibration motors, ultrasonic haptics, electrostatic haptics).
*   Device with input type detection (as defined in the referenced patent).
*   Device capable of calculating/estimating intended viewing distance (as defined in the referenced patent).

**III. Software Components:**

1.  **Haptic Profile Database:** A database containing pre-defined haptic profiles categorized by perceived distance ranges (e.g., <0.5m, 0.5-1m, 1-2m, >2m). Each profile defines the parameters for haptic feedback for common UI elements (buttons, sliders, icons, etc.). These parameters could include:
    *   Waveform shape (sine, square, triangle, custom)
    *   Frequency
    *   Amplitude
    *   Duration
    *   Pattern (single pulse, continuous vibration, Morse code-like sequence)
    *   Texture (simulated roughness or smoothness)
2.  **Distance-to-Haptic Mapping Module:**  This module receives the calculated intended viewing distance from the existing system and maps it to a corresponding haptic profile. This mapping can be linear, logarithmic, or based on a custom curve to optimize the user experience.
3.  **UI Element Haptic Controller:**  This module intercepts user interactions with UI elements and triggers the appropriate haptic feedback based on the selected profile and the specific element being interacted with. This module needs to be integrated into the UI rendering engine.
4.  **Haptic Profile Editor:**  A tool for creating and customizing haptic profiles. This tool allows designers to define the haptic feedback parameters for each UI element and to preview the feedback in a simulated environment.

**IV. System Operation:**

1.  The system calculates the intended viewing distance based on input type, as per the existing patent.
2.  The Distance-to-Haptic Mapping Module uses this distance to select the appropriate haptic profile from the Haptic Profile Database.
3.  When the user interacts with a UI element (e.g., taps a button), the UI Element Haptic Controller triggers the haptic feedback defined in the selected profile for that specific element.
4.  The haptic feedback is delivered through the device's haptic hardware, providing tactile confirmation of the interaction.

**V. Pseudocode (UI Element Haptic Controller):**

```
function onUIElementInteraction(element, interactionType) {
  intendedViewingDistance = getIntendedViewingDistance();
  hapticProfile = getHapticProfile(intendedViewingDistance);
  hapticParameters = hapticProfile.getElementHapticParameters(element);

  if (hapticParameters != null) {
    triggerHapticFeedback(hapticParameters.waveform,
                         hapticParameters.frequency,
                         hapticParameters.amplitude,
                         hapticParameters.duration,
                         hapticParameters.pattern);
  }
}

function getIntendedViewingDistance() {
  // Existing patent functionality for determining intended viewing distance
  return viewingDistance;
}

function getHapticProfile(viewingDistance) {
  // Logic for selecting the appropriate haptic profile based on viewing distance
  if (viewingDistance < 0.5) {
    return closeDistanceProfile;
  } else if (viewingDistance < 1.0) {
    return mediumDistanceProfile;
  } else {
    return farDistanceProfile;
  }
}
```

**VI. Potential Applications:**

*   **AR/VR interfaces:** Enhance the realism and immersion of virtual environments.
*   **Automotive interfaces:** Provide tactile feedback for in-car controls.
*   **Mobile gaming:** Improve the gaming experience with more realistic haptic effects.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide tactile cues for users with visual impairments.
*   **Teleoperation:** Enhance the sense of presence and control in remote operation scenarios.
