## Dynamic Dependency Graph Visualization & AI-Driven Prediction

**Core Concept:** Expand the dependency tracking beyond simple cell relationships to create a real-time, interactive visualization of the entire workbook's dependency network.  Augment this visualization with AI-powered prediction of potential cascading impacts from changes, highlighting areas of the workbook most likely to require review or recalculation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Source:** Utilize the existing forward & reverse dependency lists. Extend to include *implicit* dependencies - for example, formulas that use aggregate functions (SUM, AVERAGE) where the dependency isn't explicitly listed but exists due to the range of cells involved.
*   **Graph Database:** Employ a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to store the workbook dependency network. Nodes represent cells, and edges represent dependencies (forward/reverse, implicit).  Node data includes cell ID, formula, value, last calculated timestamp.
*   **Real-Time Updates:**  As cell values change, the graph database is updated *immediately*. The change triggers a re-evaluation of affected edges and nodes.
*   **Layering & Filtering:** Allow users to filter the graph visualization by:
    *   Cell type (input, calculated, aggregate).
    *   Dependency direction (forward, reverse).
    *   Recalculation status (marked for recalculation, recalculating, complete).
    *   User-defined tags/categories.

**2. AI-Powered Impact Prediction:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a graph neural network (GNN) on historical workbook change data. Input: the current state of the dependency graph. Output: A probability score indicating the likelihood of each cell requiring recalculation after a change.
*   **Change Propagation Simulation:**  Prior to applying a change, simulate its impact on the graph using the trained GNN. This identifies cells most likely to be affected.
*   **Risk Scoring:**  Assign a “risk score” to each cell based on the GNN’s prediction. Higher scores indicate a greater likelihood of requiring review.
*   **Automated Recalculation Prioritization:**  Use the risk score to prioritize the order of recalculations, optimizing performance and minimizing delays.

**3. User Interface & Interaction:**

*   **Interactive Visualization:**  Display the dependency graph in a user-friendly interface (e.g., using a library like D3.js or Vis.js).
*   **Node Highlighting & Zooming:** Allow users to highlight specific cells and zoom into relevant portions of the graph.
*   **Dependency Path Exploration:**  Enable users to trace the dependency path between any two cells.
*   **"What-If" Analysis:**  Allow users to simulate changes to cell values and visualize the predicted impact on the workbook.
*   **Alerting & Notifications:**  Generate alerts when changes are likely to have a significant impact on critical calculations.

**Pseudocode (Impact Prediction):**

```
// Given: Dependency Graph (DG), Change Cell (CC), Trained GNN (GNN)

function predictImpact(DG, CC) {
  // 1. Create a modified graph (DG') reflecting the change to CC
  DG' = updateGraph(DG, CC)

  // 2. Run the GNN on DG'
  impactScores = GNN.predict(DG')

  // 3. Filter impactScores to identify cells with high risk scores
  highRiskCells = filter(impactScores, score > threshold)

  // 4. Return the list of high-risk cells
  return highRiskCells
}
```

**Novelty:** This design extends beyond the existing dependency tracking to provide a proactive, AI-powered system for predicting and managing the impact of changes within a workbook. The dynamic visualization and risk scoring mechanisms enable users to focus on the most critical areas, improving efficiency and reducing errors. The AI component provides a predictive layer not present in current systems.
