## Dynamic Request Shaping via Predictive Client Modeling

**Specification:** Implement a system to predict individual client request patterns and proactively adjust request limits *before* service duress is detected. This moves beyond reactive throttling to anticipatory resource allocation.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Client Profile Database:** Stores historical request data per client (or profile), including:
    *   Request frequency (requests/second, requests/minute)
    *   Request size (data volume)
    *   Request type (API call, data query, etc.)
    *   Time-of-day/day-of-week patterns
    *   Derived metrics: request acceleration (rate of change in request volume)

2.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:** Employs time series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future request volume and characteristics for each client.  Model selection is dynamic – switching algorithms based on historical prediction accuracy per client.

3.  **Proactive Request Shaping Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors predicted request volume for each client.
    *   Compares predicted volume to pre-defined resource thresholds (based on service capacity).
    *   Adjusts request limits *before* service duress is detected. This adjustment is *smooth* - incremental increases/decreases to avoid jarring user experience.
    *   Priority adjustment – clients with critical SLAs or higher subscription tiers receive preferential treatment (higher request limits).

4.  **Feedback Loop & Model Retraining:**
    *   Tracks actual request volume vs. predicted volume.
    *   Uses the discrepancy to retrain the predictive models, improving accuracy over time.
    *   Adaptive thresholds: Service capacity fluctuates. Dynamically adjust resource thresholds based on real-time system load.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Request Shaping Module):**

```
FOR EACH client IN client_list:
    predicted_volume = Predictive_Modeling_Engine.predict(client)
    current_limit = Client_Profile_Database.get_limit(client)

    IF predicted_volume > current_limit * safety_factor:
        new_limit = min(predicted_volume, max_limit)
        Client_Profile_Database.set_limit(client, new_limit)
        LOG: "Increased limit for client: " + client + " to: " + new_limit

    ELSE IF predicted_volume < current_limit * recovery_factor:
        new_limit = max(predicted_volume, base_limit)
        Client_Profile_Database.set_limit(client, new_limit)
        LOG: "Decreased limit for client: " + client + " to: " + new_limit

    ENDIF

ENDLOOP
```

**Parameters:**

*   `safety_factor`:  A multiplier to prevent premature limit increases (e.g., 1.2).
*   `recovery_factor`: A multiplier to allow conservative limit decreases (e.g., 0.8).
*   `max_limit`: Absolute maximum request limit per client.
*   `base_limit`: Minimum request limit per client.

**Innovation:**  Shifting from reactive throttling to *predictive* request shaping.  This system anticipates service duress, allowing for smoother resource allocation and a better user experience. By modelling individual client behavior, the system can provide differentiated service levels and optimize resource utilization.
