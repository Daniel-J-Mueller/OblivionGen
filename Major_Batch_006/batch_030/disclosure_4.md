## Haptic Sound Sculpting

**Core Concept:** Leverage the audio diffuser and multi-speaker arrangement (top/bottom) not just for sound projection, but for localized haptic feedback. Transform sound waves into subtle, directed vibrations on the device's exterior.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Transducers:** Integrate an array of micro-haptic transducers *behind* the audio diffuser and adjacent to the top and bottom loudspeakers. These transducers operate on piezoelectric principles, converting electrical signals into precise vibrations.
*   **Diffuser Material:** The audio diffuser isn’t solely about sound – it’s a vibration transmission surface. Material choice is critical. Aim for a highly conductive, flexible polymer (e.g., silicone-based) with variable density zones. Higher density areas focus vibrations, lower density areas diffuse them.
*   **Speaker Configuration:** Beyond simple top/bottom separation, implement phased array processing.  Each loudspeaker isn’t just emitting sound; it’s emitting precisely timed signals that interfere constructively/destructively *in the air* and *within the diffuser*. This creates 'acoustic lenses' focused on specific points on the device's exterior.
*   **Software Control:**
    *   **Sound-to-Haptic Mapping:** Algorithm analyzes incoming audio signal (music, voice) and converts it into haptic patterns. Different frequencies, timbres, and volumes map to different vibration intensities and locations.
    *   **Spatial Audio Integration:**  Leverage spatial audio data (e.g., Dolby Atmos, DTS:X) to translate audio positioning into haptic positioning. If a sound is perceived as coming from the left, the haptic feedback is localized to the left side of the device.
    *   **Haptic Presets:** Offer user-selectable haptic profiles (e.g., 'gentle pulse,' 'textured waves,' 'rhythmic beat').
    *   **API Access:** Expose an API for developers to create custom haptic experiences for apps and games.
*   **Exterior Design:**
    *   **Variable Texture:**  The exterior surface of the device (especially around the audio diffuser) features micro-textures (ridges, bumps, grooves) that amplify and shape the haptic feedback.
    *   **Modular Panels:** Allow users to swap out exterior panels with different textures and materials to customize the haptic experience.
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Rendering):**

```
function renderHaptic(audioData, spatialData):
  // 1. Analyze audioData (frequency, amplitude, timbre)
  hapticPattern = analyzeAudio(audioData)

  // 2. Map spatialData to haptic location
  hapticLocation = mapSpatialData(spatialData)

  // 3. Adjust vibration intensity based on amplitude
  intensity = amplitude * scalingFactor

  // 4. Generate vibration signals for each transducer
  transducerSignals = generateSignals(hapticPattern, intensity, hapticLocation)

  // 5. Send signals to transducers
  sendSignalsToTransducers(transducerSignals)
```

**Application:**

Imagine holding the device during a movie scene. You *feel* the rumble of an approaching spaceship, the gentle caress of a breeze, or the impact of a punch. During a phone call, subtle vibrations mimic the speaker's voice intonation. For music, the bass pulsates against your palm, and high frequencies create a shimmering sensation. This isn’t just about adding a gimmick; it's about creating a more immersive and engaging sensory experience.
