## Dynamic Proximity Zones & Adaptive Content Projection

**Concept:** Expand the gesture-based sharing concept to create dynamically adjustable 'proximity zones' around devices, coupled with adaptive content projection onto nearby surfaces. This leverages the core idea of physical device adjacency but moves beyond simple data transfer to create interactive, augmented reality experiences.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Device A (Initiator):** Standard computing device with:
    *   Touchscreen display.
    *   High-resolution wide-angle camera (minimum 120° field of view).
    *   Ultrasonic or infrared proximity sensors (range: 0-50cm).
    *   Miniature pico-projector (brightness: minimum 50 lumens).
    *   WiFi 6 / Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity.
*   **Device B (Receiver):** Similar hardware profile to Device A, but projector is optional. Receivers could be simple 'dumb' display surfaces capable of receiving projected content.
*   **Optional: Environment Mapping Sensors:**  Low-cost depth sensors (e.g., Time-of-Flight) integrated into Device A to create a basic 3D map of the surrounding environment.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Proximity Zone Manager:**  Software module running on Device A.
    *   Continuously monitors proximity sensor data.
    *   Defines adjustable 'proximity zones' around Device A. Zones can be circular, rectangular, or custom-defined shapes.
    *   Determines which devices (Device B) are within the defined proximity zones.
*   **Gesture Recognition Engine:** Enhanced gesture recognition capable of identifying complex gestures, including:
    *   'Push' gesture:  Initiates content transfer to a specific device within the proximity zone. The direction of the push corresponds to the target device.
    *   'Expand/Contract' gesture: Adjusts the size and shape of the proximity zone dynamically.
    *   'Project' gesture: Initiates content projection onto a nearby surface.
*   **Adaptive Projection Engine:**
    *   Analyzes the surface onto which content is being projected (using camera data).
    *   Adjusts projection parameters (brightness, keystone correction, contrast) to optimize visibility and clarity.
    *   Supports interactive projections (e.g., allowing users to interact with projected content using touch or gestures).
*   **Content Adaptation Module:**
    *   Adapts content format and resolution based on the receiving device’s display characteristics.
    *   Supports different content types (images, videos, documents, 3D models).

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Device A - Main Loop

While (Device is ON) {
  Scan for nearby devices (using proximity sensors & network discovery)
  Update list of devices within proximity zones

  Get user input (touch, gestures)

  If (Gesture is 'Expand/Contract') {
    Adjust proximity zone size/shape
  }

  If (Gesture is 'Push' towards Device B) {
    Select content to share
    Publish content to Device B (using WiFi Direct / Bluetooth)
  }

  If (Gesture is 'Project') {
    Capture environment map (using camera/depth sensors)
    Analyze surface for projection
    Project selected content onto surface
    Enable interactive projection (if supported)
  }
}
```

**4. Novelty & Expansion:**

*   **Dynamic Zone Control:**  Moving beyond simple adjacency to create fluid, adjustable proximity zones.
*   **Surface-Aware Projection:**  Projecting content onto *any* nearby surface, dynamically adapting to the environment.
*   **Multi-Surface Interaction:**  Projecting content onto multiple surfaces simultaneously, creating immersive augmented reality experiences.
*   **Collaborative Workspaces:**  Using the system to create shared workspaces where users can interact with projected content in a collaborative manner. Imagine a virtual whiteboard that appears on any flat surface.
*   **Content ‘Throwing’:**  Advanced gesture recognition that allows users to ‘throw’ content between devices with realistic physics simulation (e.g., the content appears to arc through the air).
