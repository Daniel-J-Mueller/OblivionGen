## Dynamic Gaze-Contingent Environmental Control

**System Overview:** A system integrating gaze tracking with environmental control – smart home, vehicle, or augmented reality spaces. The user doesn't ‘unlock’ anything, but their gaze *becomes* the input method for a wide range of functions, creating a seamless, hands-free experience. The system actively learns gaze patterns and anticipates needs, blending input with prediction.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Spectral Camera Array:**  High-resolution RGB camera combined with near-infrared (NIR) and potentially far-red (FR) sensors.  The FR sensor enhances robustness to varying lighting conditions and skin tone.
*   **Ambient Light Sensor:** To dynamically adjust IR emitter power and image processing parameters.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Edge computing device (integrated into the device/environment) with dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) for real-time gaze estimation and predictive modeling.
*   **Environmental Control Interface:**  Wireless communication module (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee) to interface with smart home devices, vehicle systems, or AR/VR environments.
*   **Optional Haptic Feedback System:** localized haptic response for subtle gaze-based confirmations.

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Gaze Estimation Module:**
    *   Uses a deep learning model (e.g., a convolutional neural network) trained on a large dataset of eye and gaze data.
    *   Input: Multi-spectral image data from the camera array.
    *   Output: 3D gaze vector representing the direction the user is looking.  Precision target: < 1 degree of visual angle.
    *   Algorithm:  A cascaded CNN architecture, with separate branches for eye detection, pupil tracking, and gaze direction estimation.
2.  **Contextual Awareness Engine:**
    *   Maintains a dynamic model of the user’s environment and activities.
    *   Input: Gaze vector, environmental sensor data (e.g., room temperature, time of day, location), user activity data (e.g., calendar appointments, music playback).
    *   Algorithm:  Bayesian network or recurrent neural network (RNN) to model dependencies between gaze, environment, and activity.
3.  **Predictive Gaze Modeling:**
    *   Uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict the user's next gaze target based on their gaze history and contextual information.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over potential gaze targets.
4.  **Gaze-Based Interaction Mapping:**
    *   Maps gaze targets to specific actions or commands.
    *   Actions include:
        *   **Direct Manipulation:**  Looking at an object highlights it or allows for virtual interaction.
        *   **Menu Activation:**  Gazing at a virtual button activates it.
        *   **Environmental Control:**  Looking at a thermostat adjusts the temperature.
        *   **Predictive Actions:**  The system anticipates the user's needs and performs actions automatically (e.g., turning on lights when the user looks towards a room).
5.  **Calibration and Adaptation:**
    *   Initial calibration using a dynamic, gaze-contingent procedure (similar to the patent but less structured). The system presents a series of moving targets, and the user is instructed to follow them with their eyes.
    *   Continuous adaptation of the gaze model based on user feedback and interaction patterns.
    *   Algorithm: Kalman filter or particle filter to update the gaze model and track user behavior.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Action Implementation):**

```
function predict_action() {
  gaze_vector = get_gaze_vector();
  context = get_context();
  predicted_target = predict_next_target(gaze_vector, context);
  confidence = get_confidence(predicted_target);

  if (confidence > threshold) {
    execute_action(predicted_target);
  }
}

function execute_action(target) {
  // Example: If target is "living room light", turn on the light
  if (target == "living room light") {
    turn_on_light("living room");
  }
}

function get_confidence(target) {
    //Return confidence based on predictive model
    return predictive_model.confidence(target);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Homes:** Hands-free control of lighting, temperature, entertainment systems, and appliances.
*   **Automotive:**  Gaze-based infotainment control, driver monitoring, and augmented reality navigation.
*   **Accessibility:**  Providing an alternative input method for users with motor impairments.
*   **Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality:**  Intuitive and immersive interaction with virtual environments.
*   **Gaming:**  Gaze-controlled characters and interfaces.
