## Dynamic Watermarking with Per-Frame Temporal Encoding

**Concept:** Extend the version indicator concept to a dynamic watermarking system that isn’t merely *identifying* a version, but actively altering content based on user-specific, time-varying parameters. Imagine a ‘living watermark’ – subtly modifying visual elements per frame to encode data.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A frame processing module integrated into the encoding pipeline. This module operates *after* standard encoding but *before* final packaging (e.g., into DASH or HLS).
*   **Watermark Data:**  The system will encode several data streams:
    *   **User Identifier:** As in the base patent, a unique ID.
    *   **Temporal Data:** Current time (down to milliseconds) on the server.
    *   **Dynamic Parameters:**  These are the most interesting. Parameters might include:
        *   User-specific contrast/brightness adjustments.
        *   Slight color shifts (perceptually masked).
        *   Micro-adjustments to object outlines (blur/sharpen).
        *   Subtle texture variations.
*   **Encoding Algorithm:** A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) seeded with the combined User ID, Temporal Data, and Dynamic Parameters. The PRNG output determines the magnitude of the visual alterations *per frame*.  This ensures that even if a single frame is captured, it's difficult to reverse-engineer the parameters without knowing the seed.
*   **Content Modification:**  The PRNG output maps to specific visual parameters of selected content areas. The modification amount is kept *below* the just-noticeable difference (JND) threshold to avoid perceptible artifacts.
*   **Manifest Integration:** The master manifest data will *not* directly indicate playback options based on the watermarking data. Instead, it provides a baseline stream. The server dynamically generates the customized manifest (and the watermarked stream) *on-the-fly* based on the client request.
*   **Client-Side Verification:** A lightweight client-side module (integrated into the player) can sample keyframes and analyze the watermarking patterns to confirm the integrity of the stream and verify the user’s authorization.  This is a secondary check; the primary verification happens server-side during stream generation.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Stream Generation):**

```
function generate_watermarked_stream(user_id, request_time, content_stream):
  seed = hash(user_id + request_time)
  prng = PRNG(seed)

  watermarked_frames = []
  for frame in content_stream:
    # Generate random values for visual parameters
    brightness_shift = prng.random_float(-0.02, 0.02) // Small shift
    contrast_scale = prng.random_float(0.98, 1.02)
    blur_radius = prng.random_int(0, 1)

    # Apply modifications
    modified_frame = apply_visual_effects(frame, brightness_shift, contrast_scale, blur_radius)

    watermarked_frames.append(modified_frame)

  return watermarked_frames
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Advanced Anti-Piracy:**  Beyond identification, the dynamic watermark makes it far more difficult to create viable copies of the content.
*   **Personalized Content:** Adapting the visual experience to individual preferences in real time.
*   **A/B Testing at Scale:** Dynamically adjusting content variations to optimize engagement.
*   **Forensic Watermarking:** Precisely tracking the source of leaked content, even if it has been heavily modified.
