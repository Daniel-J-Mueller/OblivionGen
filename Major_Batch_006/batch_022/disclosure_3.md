## Dynamic Feature Weighting Based on Temporal Trends

**Concept:** Extend the feature phrase identification to incorporate temporal weighting, dynamically adjusting phrase scores based on evolving trends in item descriptions and user search behavior. This allows the system to highlight features that are *currently* gaining prominence, rather than relying solely on historical data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sources:**

*   **Item Description Updates:** Track changes to item descriptions over time. Timestamp each update.
*   **Search Query Logs:** Capture user search queries, associating them with timestamps.
*   **Sales Data:** Track item sales volumes over time.
*   **Social Media Feeds:** Monitor social media platforms for mentions of items and associated features. (Optional – adds complexity but potential value).

**2. Temporal Weighting Factors:**

*   **Recency:**  Assign higher weights to feature phrases that have recently appeared in item descriptions. This prioritizes new or emerging features.  Formula:  `RecencyWeight = e^(-λ * Δt)`, where `Δt` is the time since the feature phrase last appeared in an item description, and `λ` is a decay constant (tunable parameter).
*   **Trend:** Calculate the rate of change in feature phrase occurrences over a defined period (e.g., weekly, monthly). A positive trend indicates growing prominence. Formula:  `TrendWeight = (CurrentFrequency - PreviousFrequency) / PreviousFrequency`.
*   **Search Volume:**  Correlate feature phrases with search query volume. Higher search volume suggests increased user interest. Formula: `SearchWeight = log(1 + SearchFrequency)`.
*   **Sales Correlation:** Determine the correlation between the presence of a feature phrase in an item description and sales volume. A strong positive correlation indicates the feature is driving sales.  Use Pearson correlation coefficient.
*   **Social Sentiment:** (Optional) Analyze sentiment associated with mentions of the feature phrase on social media. Positive sentiment can boost the weight.

**3. Enhanced Phrase Scoring:**

*   Modify the original phrase scoring formula to incorporate temporal weighting:

    `FinalPhraseScore = BasePhraseScore * (RecencyWeight * α + TrendWeight * β + SearchWeight * γ + SalesCorrelation * δ)`,

    where:
    *   `BasePhraseScore` is the original phrase score calculated in the patent.
    *   `α`, `β`, `γ`, and `δ` are tunable weights that control the influence of each temporal factor.

**4. System Architecture Updates:**

*   **Temporal Data Store:** Create a dedicated data store for storing temporal data (item description updates, search query logs, sales data).
*   **Real-time Processing Pipeline:** Implement a real-time processing pipeline to ingest and process temporal data as it arrives.
*   **Weighting Module:** Develop a weighting module that calculates temporal weights and applies them to phrase scores.
*   **Adaptive Weight Tuning:**  Implement a mechanism for automatically tuning the weights (`α`, `β`, `γ`, `δ`) based on A/B testing or reinforcement learning to optimize the effectiveness of the system.

**5. Pseudocode – Weighting Module:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateWeightedPhraseScore(phrase, BasePhraseScore, TemporalData):
  RecencyWeight = EXP(-λ * TimeSinceLastOccurrence(phrase, TemporalData))
  TrendWeight = (CurrentFrequency(phrase, TemporalData) - PreviousFrequency(phrase, TemporalData)) / PreviousFrequency(phrase, TemporalData)
  SearchWeight = LOG(1 + SearchFrequency(phrase, TemporalData))
  SalesCorrelation = CalculatePearsonCorrelation(phrase, TemporalData)

  FinalPhraseScore = BasePhraseScore * (RecencyWeight * α + TrendWeight * β + SearchWeight * γ + SalesCorrelation * δ)

  RETURN FinalPhraseScore
```

**6. Application – Dynamic Item Detail Pages:**

*   Update item detail pages to highlight feature phrases with the highest current `FinalPhraseScore`.
*   Provide “Trending Now” sections that showcase features gaining popularity.
*   Personalize recommendations based on user search history and the current prominence of different features.
