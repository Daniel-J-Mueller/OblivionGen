## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predictive User Behavior

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Resource Allocator (PRA) – a software module integrated within the existing computing resource service.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical User Activity Logs: Capture resource requests, application usage patterns, and session durations for each customer.
    *   Real-time Monitoring Data: Track current resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, storage, network) for each customer’s allocated group of computing nodes.
    *   Application Profiles: Pre-defined or dynamically learned profiles outlining resource requirements for common applications used by customers (e.g., database server, web application, machine learning workload).
    *   External Event Streams: Integrate with external data sources (e.g., marketing campaign schedules, news feeds, social media trends) that may influence user demand.
*   **Machine Learning Model:**
    *   Time Series Forecasting: Employ algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future resource demand based on historical data and external event streams.
    *   User Segmentation: Cluster users based on their resource usage patterns and predict their individual resource needs.
    *   Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual resource usage patterns that may indicate unexpected demand spikes or potential security threats.
*   **Resource Allocation Strategy:**
    *   Proactive Scaling: PRA predicts future resource demand and proactively adjusts the allocated group of computing nodes before demand exceeds capacity.
    *   Tiered Resource Pools: Maintain multiple resource pools with varying levels of performance and cost. PRA dynamically assigns customers to the appropriate resource pool based on their predicted demand and service level agreements.
    *   Resource Shaping: Implement techniques to prioritize critical applications and limit the resource consumption of non-critical applications during periods of high demand.

**Innovation Description:**

This system shifts resource allocation from a reactive, threshold-based approach (as implied in the source patent) to a *predictive* model. Rather than simply scaling resources in response to current utilization exceeding a threshold, PRA anticipates future demand and proactively adjusts resource allocation.

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop - Runs periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes)
FOR EACH customer IN customerList:

    // 1. Data Collection
    historicalData = getHistoricalResourceUsage(customer)
    realtimeData = getRealtimeResourceUsage(customer)
    applicationProfiles = getApplicationProfiles(customer)
    externalEvents = getExternalEvents(customer)

    // 2. Demand Prediction
    predictedDemand = predictResourceDemand(historicalData, realtimeData, applicationProfiles, externalEvents)

    // 3. Resource Allocation Optimization
    optimalAllocation = optimizeResourceAllocation(predictedDemand, currentAllocation, costModel, performanceModel)

    // 4. Resource Adjustment
    IF optimalAllocation != currentAllocation THEN
        adjustResourceAllocation(optimalAllocation, currentAllocation)
        logResourceAdjustment(customer, optimalAllocation, currentAllocation)
    ENDIF

ENDLOOP
```

**Detailed Breakdown of Functions:**

*   `getHistoricalResourceUsage(customer)`: Retrieves historical resource utilization data for the customer.
*   `getRealtimeResourceUsage(customer)`: Retrieves current resource utilization data for the customer.
*   `getApplicationProfiles(customer)`: Retrieves application profiles for the customer.
*   `getExternalEvents(customer)`: Retrieves external event data that may influence demand.
*   `predictResourceDemand(historicalData, realtimeData, applicationProfiles, externalEvents)`: Uses machine learning models to predict future resource demand.
*   `optimizeResourceAllocation(predictedDemand, currentAllocation, costModel, performanceModel)`: Determines the optimal resource allocation based on predicted demand, cost, and performance considerations.
*   `adjustResourceAllocation(optimalAllocation, currentAllocation)`: Modifies the allocated group of computing nodes to match the optimal allocation.
*   `logResourceAdjustment(customer, optimalAllocation, currentAllocation)`: Records the resource adjustment for auditing and analysis.
