**Dynamic Reviewer Tiering & Gamified Reward System**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple review scoring to create a tiered reviewer system with dynamic challenges and rewards, shifting the focus from simply *getting* positive feedback to consistently providing *valuable* insights.

**Specs:**

*   **Tiered System:** Implement bronze, silver, gold, platinum, and diamond tiers. Progression is based on a rolling 30-day ‘Insight Score’.
*   **Insight Score Calculation:**  Insight Score is *not* just positive/negative feedback. It incorporates:
    *   **Helpfulness Votes (HV):**  Weighting as in the original patent.
    *   **Purchase Correlation (PC):** Percentage of viewers who, after viewing the review, purchase the item.  (Crucially, only counts purchases *within 72 hours* of review view).
    *   **Review Depth (RD):**  Automated analysis of review text for length, keyword richness (covering product features), and originality (compared to other reviews – plagiarism detection).  Score 0-10.
    *   **Image/Video Quality (IQ):** Automated analysis of any included media for resolution, lighting, and focus. Score 0-10.
    *   **Insight Score Formula:** `IS = (0.5 * HV) + (0.3 * PC) + (0.1 * RD) + (0.1 * IQ)`
*   **Dynamic Challenges:**  Each reviewer receives personalized challenges.  Examples:
    *   "Review 3 items in the 'Smart Home' category this week to earn a 10% Insight Score bonus."
    *   "Include a video demonstration in your next review to unlock a 'Visual Expert' badge."
    *   "Review a recently released product within 24 hours of its launch to earn a 'First Look' bonus."
*   **Tiered Rewards:**
    *   **Bronze:**  Access to exclusive discounts.
    *   **Silver:**  Early access to new products for review.
    *   **Gold:**  Increased visibility in search results, dedicated reviewer profile page.
    *   **Platinum:**  Sponsored review opportunities, invitation to product development feedback sessions.
    *   **Diamond:**  Revenue sharing on product sales generated directly from their reviews (tracked via unique affiliate links).
*   **Gamification Elements:**
    *   Badges: Earned for specific achievements (e.g., “Photo Master,” “Tech Guru”).
    *   Leaderboards: Display top reviewers by Insight Score (optional, privacy settings).
    *   Streaks: Reward reviewers for consistently providing reviews.
*   **Fraud Prevention:**
    *   IP address monitoring to prevent fake accounts.
    *   Anomaly detection to identify suspicious voting patterns.
    *   Manual review of flagged accounts.
*   **Pseudocode (Insight Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateInsightScore(reviewerID) {
  // Get data for the last 30 days
  helpfulVotes = getHelpfulVotes(reviewerID);
  purchaseCorrelation = getPurchaseCorrelation(reviewerID);
  reviewDepth = getReviewDepth(reviewerID);
  imageQuality = getImageQuality(reviewerID);

  // Calculate Insight Score
  insightScore = (0.5 * helpfulVotes) + (0.3 * purchaseCorrelation) + (0.1 * reviewDepth) + (0.1 * imageQuality);

  return insightScore;
