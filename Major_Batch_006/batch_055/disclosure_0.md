## Adaptive Task Decomposition & Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand execution paradigm to *decompose* complex tasks into smaller, independently executable sub-tasks, dynamically allocating them across available on-demand computing environments (local and remote) based on real-time resource availability *and* sub-task dependencies.  This goes beyond simply finding *enough* resources; it's about *optimizing* the execution graph.

**Specs:**

*   **Task Definition Language (TDL):**  A declarative language for defining complex tasks as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of sub-tasks.  TDL would specify:
    *   Sub-task dependencies (e.g., sub-task B requires the output of sub-task A).
    *   Resource requirements (CPU, memory, GPU, network bandwidth) for each sub-task.
    *   Priority/deadline for each sub-task.
    *   Data transfer requirements between sub-tasks.
*   **Decomposition Engine:** A component within the coordinator device responsible for:
    *   Parsing TDL task definitions.
    *   Identifying opportunities for parallel execution of independent sub-tasks.
    *   Generating an execution plan – a mapping of sub-tasks to available on-demand computing environments.  The plan will consider minimizing data transfer latency and maximizing resource utilization.
*   **Dynamic Resource Monitor:** Continuously monitors resource availability (CPU, memory, network) across all available on-demand computing environments (local and remote).  This information is fed into the Decomposition Engine.
*   **Execution Orchestrator:**  Responsible for:
    *   Launching sub-tasks on assigned on-demand computing environments.
    *   Managing data transfer between sub-tasks (using efficient serialization/deserialization techniques).
    *   Monitoring sub-task execution status.
    *   Handling failures (re-scheduling failed sub-tasks on different environments).
*   **Adaptive Re-Planning Module:** Continuously evaluates the execution plan and dynamically re-plans if:
    *   Resource availability changes significantly.
    *   A sub-task fails.
    *   A faster or more suitable on-demand computing environment becomes available.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Re-Planning Module):**

```
function rePlan(taskGraph, currentPlan, resourceMonitorData):
  # Evaluate current plan cost (total execution time, data transfer cost)
  currentCost = calculateCost(currentPlan, resourceMonitorData)

  # Generate alternative plans (e.g., different sub-task allocations)
  alternativePlans = generateAlternativePlans(taskGraph, resourceMonitorData)

  # Calculate cost of alternative plans
  alternativeCosts = [calculateCost(plan, resourceMonitorData) for plan in alternativePlans]

  # Find the plan with the lowest cost
  bestPlan = alternativePlans[min(range(len(alternativeCosts)), key=alternativeCosts.__getitem__)]

  # If the best plan is better than the current plan
  if calculateCost(bestPlan, resourceMonitorData) < currentCost:
    # Migrate sub-tasks to new environments as needed
    migrateTasks(currentPlan, bestPlan)
    # Update current plan
    currentPlan = bestPlan

  return currentPlan
```

**Key Innovation:**  The system isn’t simply executing tasks *on* available resources; it’s actively *restructuring* the task itself to best fit those resources *in real-time*.  This enables efficient execution of arbitrarily complex tasks even with limited or fluctuating resources.  This contrasts with simpler load balancing or static scheduling approaches.
