## Adaptive Event Prioritization & Dynamic Buffer Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the persistent buffer concept to dynamically adjust prioritization and allocation based on real-time system analysis, and predictive modeling of event severity.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** "Event Severity Prediction Engine" (ESPE) – a lightweight machine learning model integrated into the CPLD.
*   **Input:** Raw SEL data (message content, timestamp, source).
*   **ESPE Training Data:** Historical system logs, failure analysis reports, and environmental data (temperature, voltage).  Initial model deployed from factory, continuously refined via onboard learning.
*   **ESPE Output:**  Severity Score (0-100) – indicating the likelihood of the event leading to a system failure.
*   **Dynamic Prioritization:** SEL messages are tagged with the Severity Score. Higher scores receive priority in buffer allocation and BMC notification.  
*   **Buffer Allocation:**
    *   The persistent buffer is segmented into priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
    *   Allocation is dynamic – if a surge of High-priority events occurs, space is dynamically reallocated from lower-priority segments.
    *   Buffer segments utilize a circular buffer architecture with adjustable segment sizes.
*   **BMC Interaction:**
    *   The BMC can request events by priority level (e.g., "Send all High-priority events").
    *   The BMC receives a "Buffer Health" report – indicating the current allocation of buffer space to each priority level.
    *   The BMC can remotely trigger a buffer flush of a specific priority level.
*   **State Machine Integration:**  The CPLD state machine is augmented to include a "Buffer State" – tracking the allocation and health of the persistent buffer.
*   **External Component Access:** Prioritization extends to external component requests, granting access based on Severity Score and configured permissions.

**Pseudocode (CPLD Logic):**

```
// On SEL Message Received:
severity_score = ESPE.predict(sel_message)
priority = map_severity_to_priority(severity_score)

// Buffer Management:
segment = get_segment_for_priority(priority)
if segment.is_full():
    // Attempt to reallocate space from lower priority segments
    reallocate_space(segment)

store_sel_message(segment, sel_message)

// BMC Request Handling:
if request.priority > threshold:
    retrieve_messages(request.priority)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased CPLD logic complexity to accommodate the ESPE and dynamic buffer management.
*   Larger persistent buffer capacity (e.g., 64MB-256MB) to support a wider range of events and longer retention periods.
*   Dedicated hardware accelerator for ESPE inference to minimize latency.
*   Secure boot mechanism to protect the ESPE model from tampering.
