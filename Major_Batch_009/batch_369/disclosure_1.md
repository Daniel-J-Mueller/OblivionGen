## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Weight Estimation

**Concept:** Leverage the resonant frequency of the basket structure itself, combined with weight sensor data, to dramatically improve weight estimation accuracy and stability, especially in dynamic environments (e.g., cart moving, bumps).

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Piezoelectric actuators embedded within the basket frame (4-8 strategically placed). These are small, lightweight, and can induce controlled vibrations.
    *   High-sensitivity accelerometers co-located with actuators.
    *   Existing weight sensors (as per provided patent).
    *   Dedicated microcontroller for real-time signal processing.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Baseline Calibration:** At power-up (and periodically), induce a sweep of frequencies through the piezoelectric actuators. Measure the resonant frequency of the basket using the accelerometers. Store this baseline.
    2.  **Dynamic Resonant Frequency Tracking:** Continuously monitor the resonant frequency.  Weight changes *will* shift this frequency.
    3.  **Hybrid Weight Estimation:**
        *   Traditional weight estimation via mean/cumulative sums (as in the base patent).  This provides the initial weight reading.
        *   **Resonance-Based Weight Adjustment:**
            *   Calculate the *shift* in resonant frequency compared to the baseline.
            *   Utilize a pre-calculated calibration map (frequency shift -> weight change) to refine the initial weight estimate.  This map is generated during manufacturing/calibration.
            *   Apply a Kalman filter to fuse the traditional weight estimate and the resonance-based estimate. The Kalman filter dynamically weights the two inputs based on their estimated noise levels.
    4.  **Vibration Dampening (Optional):**  If excessive vibration is detected (e.g., from a bumpy surface), use the piezoelectric actuators to actively dampen the vibrations, improving the accuracy of both the weight and resonant frequency measurements.
    5.  **Stability Criteria:** Define stability not just by weight *change* but also by the *rate of change* of resonant frequency.  Sudden shifts in frequency might indicate a dropped item or external interference.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
baseline_frequency = MeasureBasketResonantFrequency()
calibration_map = LoadCalibrationMap() //Frequency Shift -> Weight Change

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  weight_estimate = CalculateWeightEstimate() // Existing algorithm

  current_frequency = MeasureBasketResonantFrequency()
  frequency_shift = current_frequency - baseline_frequency

  resonance_weight_adjustment = calibration_map[frequency_shift]

  // Kalman Filter
  kalman_filtered_weight = KalmanFilter(weight_estimate, resonance_weight_adjustment)

  //Stability Check
  frequency_rate_of_change = CalculateRateOfChange(current_frequency)
  if (frequency_rate_of_change > threshold || abs(kalman_filtered_weight - previous_weight) > weight_threshold) {
      indicate_instability()
  }

  previous_weight = kalman_filtered_weight
}

function MeasureBasketResonantFrequency():
    // Sweep frequencies via piezoelectric actuators
    // Measure response via accelerometers
    // Find peak response frequency = resonant frequency
    return resonant_frequency

function CalculateWeightEstimate():
    // Implement existing mean/cumulative sum algorithm
    return weight_estimate

function KalmanFilter(weight_estimate, resonance_weight_adjustment):
    // Standard Kalman filter implementation
    return kalman_filtered_weight
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Higher Accuracy:**  Resonant frequency is highly sensitive to weight changes, potentially providing finer granularity than traditional weight sensors.
*   **Improved Stability:**  Tracking resonant frequency can help filter out noise and compensate for vibrations.
*   **Robustness:**  Less susceptible to interference from external vibrations.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Sudden changes in resonant frequency could indicate dropped items or attempts to tamper with the cart's contents.
