## Adaptive Temporal Granularity with Predictive Splitting

**Concept:** Instead of reacting to throughput or storage capacity *after* itâ€™s exceeded, proactively adjust temporal granularity and split tiles based on *predicted* data volume within a time window. This creates a self-optimizing system that anticipates needs, rather than responding to bottlenecks.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Prediction Module:**  A time-series forecasting engine (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) integrated with each storage node. This module analyzes incoming data streams for each spatial region, predicting data volume for defined temporal slices (e.g., 5-minute, 1-hour, 1-day). This forecasting is done *concurrently* with data ingestion.
*   **Granularity Ladder:**  Define a hierarchical ladder of temporal granularities (e.g., 5-second, 30-second, 1-minute, 5-minute, 30-minute, 1-hour, 1-day).  The system dynamically chooses the optimal granularity level based on predicted data volume *and* storage costs (different granularities have different storage overhead).
*   **Split Thresholds (Dynamic):** Instead of a single threshold, define a *range* of split thresholds based on predicted data volume.  Lower predicted volumes use higher granularity (smaller tiles), while higher predicted volumes use lower granularity (larger tiles).  The threshold dynamically adjusts to optimize space/performance.
*   **Pre-Split Allocation:** Based on prediction, allocate resources (storage space, processing capacity) *before* the time window starts. This preemptive allocation avoids contention and ensures smooth data ingestion.
*   **Tile Merging (Cooldown):** Implement a mechanism for merging recently split tiles if predicted data volume drops below a threshold. This reduces fragmentation and storage overhead.
*   **Spatial-Temporal Correlations:**  Extend the prediction model to consider spatial-temporal correlations.  If neighboring spatial regions exhibit similar data patterns, share predictions to improve accuracy and reduce prediction overhead.

**Pseudocode (Storage Node):**

```
// Initialize: Configure granularity ladder, prediction model
granularityLadder = [5s, 30s, 1m, 5m, 30m, 1h, 1d]
predictionModel = loadTimeSeriesForecastingModel()

// Data Ingestion Loop:
for each dataPoint in incomingDataStream:
  spatialRegion = dataPoint.spatialRegion
  currentTime = dataPoint.timestamp

  // Predict Data Volume for Next Time Slice
  predictedVolume = predictionModel.predict(spatialRegion, currentTime, timeSliceDuration)

  // Determine Optimal Granularity
  optimalGranularity = selectGranularity(predictedVolume, granularityLadder)

  // Allocate Tile (or Reuse Existing)
  tile = getTile(spatialRegion, currentTime, optimalGranularity)

  // Write Data to Tile
  tile.writeData(dataPoint)

  //Background Process: Tile Management
  //1. Merge tiles if usage is low for a set period
  //2. Re-evaluate prediction model for accuracy and adjust weights
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Proactive Optimization:  Avoids performance bottlenecks and storage contention.
*   Reduced Storage Overhead:  Dynamically adjusts granularity to minimize storage costs.
*   Improved Scalability:  Preemptive resource allocation improves scalability.
*   Adaptive to Workloads:  Automatically adjusts to changing data patterns and workloads.
