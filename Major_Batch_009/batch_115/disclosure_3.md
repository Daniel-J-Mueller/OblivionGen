## Dynamic Content Assembly via Predictive Fragmenting & Multi-Scale Skeletoning

**Concept:** Expand upon the fragment/skeleton idea, but introduce a predictive element and move towards multi-scale skeletons. Instead of simply breaking down content *after* acquisition, dynamically generate fragments and skeletons *during* content creation/ingestion, anticipating likely viewing patterns. Also, create multiple skeleton 'resolutions' – coarse, medium, fine – to allow for adaptable rendering based on network conditions and device capabilities.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Fragmenter Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw content (text, images, video, etc.).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze content for semantic breaks (sentences, paragraphs, sections, scene changes). Utilize NLP models for more complex content.
    *   Employ a 'usage prediction engine’ – trained on user interaction data (clicks, scrolls, time spent viewing) – to estimate the probability of specific content segments being accessed.
    *   Dynamically fragment content based on both semantic breaks *and* predicted access probability. High-probability segments may be fragmented into smaller units. Low-probability segments might be combined into larger chunks.
    *   Assign ‘priority scores’ to each fragment based on predicted access probability.
*   **Output:** A set of fragments with associated priority scores.

**2. Multi-Scale Skeleton Generator:**

*   **Input:**  Content, Fragments, Semantic Analysis.
*   **Process:**
    *   Generate *three* skeleton versions:
        *   **Coarse Skeleton:** Minimal formatting, high-level structure (headings, chapter titles).  Used for initial content loading and browsing.
        *   **Medium Skeleton:** Detailed formatting (paragraph styles, font sizes, image placements). Used for standard rendering.
        *   **Fine Skeleton:**  Highly detailed formatting (precise pixel positioning, complex animations).  Used for high-fidelity rendering on powerful devices.
    *   Associate each skeleton version with the corresponding fragment set.
    *   Implement skeleton 'inheritance'.  The coarse skeleton serves as a base, with medium and fine skeletons adding layers of detail.
*   **Output:** Three skeleton versions (coarse, medium, fine) linked to their corresponding fragment sets.

**3. Adaptive Rendering Engine:**

*   **Input:** Client Device Capabilities (network speed, screen resolution, processing power), User Viewing Location (requested section, scroll position).
*   **Process:**
    *   Select the appropriate skeleton version based on device capabilities and network conditions.
    *   Request only the fragments corresponding to the user's current viewing location (and a buffer for smooth scrolling).
    *   Utilize a fragment prioritization algorithm – load high-priority fragments first.
    *   Implement a ‘progressive refinement’ strategy – start with lower-resolution fragments and gradually load higher-resolution versions as they become available.
*   **Output:** Rendered content displayed on the client device.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Rendering Engine):**

```
function renderContent(deviceCapabilities, viewingLocation) {
  skeletonResolution = determineSkeletonResolution(deviceCapabilities);
  skeleton = loadSkeleton(skeletonResolution);
  fragmentRange = calculateFragmentRange(viewingLocation);
  priorityQueue = createPriorityQueue(fragmentRange); // Order fragments by priority score

  while (priorityQueue not empty and bandwidth available) {
    fragment = priorityQueue.dequeue();
    requestFragment(fragment);
    renderFragment(fragment, skeleton);
  }
}

function determineSkeletonResolution(deviceCapabilities) {
  if (deviceCapabilities.bandwidth < MIN_BANDWIDTH) {
    return "coarse";
  } else if (deviceCapabilities.processingPower < MIN_POWER) {
    return "medium";
  } else {
    return "fine";
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Fragment:** { content, priorityScore, byteOffset, skeletonMapping }
*   **Skeleton:** { resolution, formattingData }

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency – only load necessary fragments and skeleton details.
*   Adaptive rendering – optimize content delivery based on device and network conditions.
*   Improved user experience – smooth scrolling and fast loading times.
*   Scalability – handle large amounts of content efficiently.
