## Adaptive Encryption Key Orchestration via Blockchain

**Concept:** A system utilizing a permissioned blockchain to dynamically orchestrate encryption key selection and distribution, leveraging hardware attestation and real-time threat intelligence. This moves beyond static ranked lists of algorithms and allows for a truly adaptive security posture.

**Specifications:**

**1. Blockchain Layer:**

*   **Type:** Permissioned Blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda).  Nodes will be operated by the intermediary (load balancer/virtual machine manager) and destination components (servers/virtual machines).
*   **Data Structure:**  Each block contains:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Destination Component ID
    *   Supported Encryption Algorithms (list) – updated periodically by the destination.
    *   Hardware Attestation Report (proof of secure hardware)
    *   Current Encryption Algorithm Selection (chosen by the intermediary)
    *   Threat Intelligence Score (real-time from external sources)
    *   Digital Signature (of the intermediary and destination component)
*   **Consensus Mechanism:** Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) – for high reliability and fast transaction confirmation.

**2. Intermediary (Load Balancer/VM Manager) Logic:**

*   **Algorithm Selection:**
    1.  Receive encryption algorithm list from source (client).
    2.  Query blockchain for destination component's supported algorithms, hardware attestation, and threat intelligence score.
    3.  Filter source-supported algorithms against destination-supported algorithms.
    4.  **Adaptive Scoring:** Assign a security score to each eligible algorithm based on:
        *   Algorithm strength (AES-256 > AES-128, ChaCha20 > RC4)
        *   Hardware Acceleration Availability (e.g., AES-NI support) – determined from hardware attestation.
        *   Threat Intelligence Score (algorithms recently compromised receive lower scores).
    5.  Select the algorithm with the highest score.
    6.  Record the selected algorithm on the blockchain with a digital signature.
    7.  Notify the source of the selected algorithm.
*   **Key Exchange:**  Utilize a Diffie-Hellman variant (e.g., ECDH) to establish a shared secret key for symmetric encryption. The key exchange process is initiated *after* the algorithm has been agreed upon and recorded on the blockchain.
*   **Dynamic Re-evaluation:** Periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) re-evaluate the encryption algorithm based on updated threat intelligence and hardware status. Trigger a key rotation and algorithm switch if necessary.

**3. Destination Component (Server/VM) Logic:**

*   **Algorithm Registration:**  Periodically (e.g., every hour) register its supported encryption algorithms and hardware information with the blockchain.
*   **Attestation Reporting:** Provide a digitally signed attestation report verifying the integrity and security of its hardware.
*   **Key Acceptance:**  Accept the shared secret key established by the intermediary and use it to decrypt incoming traffic.
*   **Blockchain Monitoring:** Monitor the blockchain for algorithm updates and proactively prepare for key rotations.

**Pseudocode (Intermediary - Algorithm Selection):**

```
function selectEncryptionAlgorithm(sourceAlgorithms, destinationInfo):
  destinationAlgorithms = getAlgorithmsFromBlockchain(destinationInfo)
  eligibleAlgorithms = filter(sourceAlgorithms, destinationAlgorithms)

  scoredAlgorithms = []
  for algorithm in eligibleAlgorithms:
    score = calculateSecurityScore(algorithm, destinationInfo)
    scoredAlgorithms.append((algorithm, score))

  sortedAlgorithms = sortByScore(scoredAlgorithms, descending=True)

  selectedAlgorithm = sortedAlgorithms[0].algorithm
  recordAlgorithmOnBlockchain(destinationInfo, selectedAlgorithm)
  notifySource(selectedAlgorithm)

  return selectedAlgorithm
```

**Innovation:** This system goes beyond static algorithm ranking by integrating real-time threat intelligence, hardware attestation, and blockchain immutability.  It allows for a highly adaptive and secure communication channel, responding to emerging threats and ensuring data confidentiality.  The blockchain provides an audit trail of algorithm selections, enhancing trust and accountability.
