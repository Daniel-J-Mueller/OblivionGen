## Dynamic Safety Zones & Predictive Relocation

**Concept:** Augment the existing system with dynamically adjustable safety zones around humans, informed by predictive movement analysis, and enable proactive, anticipatory relocation of mobile drive units *before* a potential collision. This isn't just reactive stopping; it's preemptive avoidance.

**Specs:**

*   **Human Movement Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time location data from the locator device (human). Historical movement data (velocity, acceleration, trajectory) stored locally or on a cloud server. Environmental map data (static obstacles, designated pathways).
    *   Processing:  Employ a Kalman filter or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the human’s likely path over the next 1-5 seconds.  Assign a confidence level to the prediction.
    *   Output: Predicted trajectory (x, y, z coordinates over time) with associated confidence level. Probability heatmap of likely future locations.
*   **Dynamic Safety Zone Generator:**
    *   Input: Predicted trajectory, confidence level, human velocity, environmental map data.
    *   Processing:  Create a dynamically adjusting safety zone around the predicted trajectory. The zone size is *not* fixed. It expands with increased velocity, lower confidence in the prediction, and proximity to obstacles.  Implement a layered zone system:
        *   *Immediate Stop Zone* (smallest radius – triggers immediate stop)
        *   *Slowdown/Redirection Zone* (intermediate radius – initiates speed reduction or path redirection)
        *   *Predictive Avoidance Zone* (largest radius – proactive relocation initiated).
    *   Output:  Safety zone parameters (center coordinates, radii for each layer).
*   **Proactive Relocation Algorithm:**
    *   Input:  Current drive unit location, safety zone parameters, environmental map, drive unit capabilities (max speed, turning radius).
    *   Processing:
        1.  Determine if the drive unit's predicted path will intersect with *any* layer of the safety zone.
        2.  If intersection is predicted, *before* entering the zone, calculate an optimal relocation path. This isn't simply moving directly away. It considers:
            *   Minimizing disruption to the drive unit’s task.
            *   Maintaining a safe distance *even if* the human deviates from the predicted trajectory.
            *   Avoiding collisions with static obstacles.
        3.  Send relocation commands to the drive unit.
    *   Output:  Relocation path (series of waypoints) and target speed.
*   **Sensor Fusion Enhancement:** Integrate data from additional sensors (LiDAR, cameras) on both the human (wearable device) and the drive unit to improve the accuracy of human tracking and obstacle detection.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  A low-latency, reliable communication channel between the locator device, the management device, and the drive units is essential for real-time safety calculations and command execution. Implement a prioritized messaging system to ensure that safety-critical messages are delivered with minimal delay.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Relocation Algorithm):**

```
function calculateRelocationPath(driveUnitLocation, safetyZoneParams, environmentalMap):
  predictedIntersection = checkPathIntersection(driveUnitLocation, safetyZoneParams)

  if predictedIntersection:
    // A* search algorithm with cost function favoring:
    // 1. Maintaining safe distance from safety zone
    // 2. Minimizing task disruption (shortest path to original goal)
    // 3. Avoiding obstacles
    relocationPath = AStarSearch(driveUnitLocation, safeZoneParams, environmentalMap)
    return relocationPath
  else:
    // No relocation needed – continue original task
    return currentTaskPath
```

**Novelty:** This system *proactively* avoids collisions by anticipating human movement and initiating relocation *before* a hazard arises, rather than simply reacting to proximity.  The dynamic safety zones and predictive relocation algorithm create a more robust and intelligent safety system.
