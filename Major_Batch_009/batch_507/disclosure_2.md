## Dynamic Resource Entitlement via Temporal Logic Profiles

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting resource access not based solely on organizational hierarchy, but on *temporal logic profiles* associated with user roles *and* resource characteristics.

**Core Concept:** Instead of simply granting or denying access, the system assigns a 'resource entitlement score' to a user for a given resource. This score fluctuates over time based on pre-defined temporal logic profiles. These profiles define conditions under which access is granted, limited, or revoked, factoring in time-based events, usage patterns, and contextual data.

**Components:**

*   **Temporal Logic Profile Editor:** A GUI allowing administrators to define profiles using a visual programming language (node-based preferred). Nodes represent conditions (time, date, user group, resource type, usage history, external events), logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR), and actions (entitlement score adjustment, notification, automated task).
*   **Entitlement Engine:** The core component responsible for evaluating temporal logic profiles and calculating real-time entitlement scores. This engine must support parallel processing for scalability.
*   **Resource Monitor:** Gathers data on resource usage, performance, and security events. This data is fed into the Entitlement Engine for dynamic score adjustments.
*   **Policy Repository:** Stores all temporal logic profiles, user role definitions, and resource metadata.
*   **API Gateway:** Provides a standardized interface for accessing entitlement scores and resource information.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Profile Creation:** Administrator defines a temporal logic profile for a specific resource or resource type. Example: “Grant full access to the database between 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays, limit access to read-only on weekends, and revoke access completely if suspicious activity is detected.”
2.  **User Role Assignment:** User is assigned a role, which is linked to one or more temporal logic profiles.
3.  **Real-time Evaluation:** The Entitlement Engine continuously evaluates the assigned profiles based on the current time, resource usage, and external events.
4.  **Score Calculation:** A numerical entitlement score is calculated for the user, ranging from 0 (no access) to 100 (full access).
5.  **Access Control:** Resource access is determined based on the calculated score. Access may be granted, limited (e.g., read-only), or denied.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Resource Monitor detects changes in resource usage or security events. Entitlement Engine dynamically adjusts the entitlement score based on these changes.

**Pseudocode (Entitlement Engine):**

```
function calculateEntitlementScore(userID, resourceID):
  score = 100 // Default full access

  // Retrieve profiles associated with user and resource
  profiles = getProfiles(userID, resourceID)

  for each profile in profiles:
    if profile.isActive(): // Check if profile is currently valid

      conditionsMet = true

      for each condition in profile.conditions:
        if condition.type == "TIME":
          if !condition.isTimeValid():
            conditionsMet = false
            break
        elif condition.type == "USAGE":
          if !condition.isUsageValid():
            conditionsMet = false
            break
        elif condition.type == "EVENT":
          if !condition.isEventValid():
            conditionsMet = false
            break

      if conditionsMet:
        score = applyProfileAction(score, profile.action) // Adjust score based on profile action

  return score
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Profile:** {profileID, name, description, conditions[], actions, isActive()}
*   **Condition:** {conditionID, type (TIME, USAGE, EVENT), parameters, isTimeValid(), isUsageValid(), isEventValid()}
*   **Action:** {actionID, type (GRANT, LIMIT, REVOKE), parameters}

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Distributed Entitlement Engine with caching.
*   Asynchronous event processing.
*   Horizontal scaling of the Policy Repository.
*   Load balancing for the API Gateway.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Dynamic access control for cloud resources.
*   Time-based access to sensitive data.
*   Automated provisioning and deprovisioning of resources.
*   Adaptive security policies.
