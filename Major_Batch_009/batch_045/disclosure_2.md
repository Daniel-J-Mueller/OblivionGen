## Adaptive Worker Node ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive Scaling

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a ‘shadowing’ system where potential worker nodes are continuously executing simplified versions of anticipated test cases *before* being requested by the client. This pre-execution provides real-time performance data and readiness status, enabling predictive scaling and significantly reducing test initiation latency.

**II. Components:**

*   **Shadow Test Suite:** A curated set of minimal, representative test cases designed to stress key system metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O) without requiring full test execution time.
*   **Shadow Node Pool:** A dynamically sized pool of worker nodes dedicated to running the Shadow Test Suite. Nodes are added/removed based on historical demand and predicted workload.
*   **Performance Monitoring Agent:** Integrated into each Shadow Node, this agent collects and reports performance metrics during Shadow Test Suite execution.
*   **Predictive Scaling Engine:** Analyzes performance data from the Monitoring Agent, historical test request patterns, and external factors (time of day, known events) to predict future demand. This engine dynamically adjusts the size of the Shadow Node Pool.
*   **‘Warm-Up’ Mechanism:** When a client requests a worker node, the system prioritizes a Shadow Node currently executing the closest matching test case. The Shadow Node is ‘warmed up’—its state preserved—and transitioned to full test execution, avoiding the overhead of node initialization.

**III. Data Flow:**

1.  Shadow Nodes continuously execute the Shadow Test Suite.
2.  Performance Monitoring Agents collect and report metrics (CPU load, memory usage, network latency) to the Predictive Scaling Engine.
3.  Predictive Scaling Engine analyzes data and dynamically scales the Shadow Node Pool.
4.  Client sends a test request with specific criteria.
5.  System identifies Shadow Nodes that have recently executed relevant test cases and are currently ‘warm.’
6.  ‘Warm’ Shadow Node is reassigned to the client and transitions to full test execution.
7.  If no suitable ‘warm’ Shadow Node is available, a new node is provisioned and initialized, but the process is informed by data from the Shadow Node Pool.

**IV. Pseudocode (Predictive Scaling Engine):**

```
FUNCTION predict_demand():
  historical_data = LOAD_HISTORICAL_TEST_REQUESTS()
  current_pool_size = GET_SHADOW_POOL_SIZE()
  shadow_node_performance = GET_SHADOW_NODE_PERFORMANCE_DATA()

  // Simple linear regression for predicting future requests
  predicted_requests = LINEAR_REGRESSION(historical_data, shadow_node_performance)

  // Adjust pool size based on prediction
  IF predicted_requests > current_pool_size * 0.8:
    ADD_SHADOW_NODES(predicted_requests - current_pool_size)
  ELSE IF predicted_requests < current_pool_size * 0.5:
    REMOVE_SHADOW_NODES(current_pool_size - predicted_requests)

  RETURN predicted_requests
```

**V. Considerations:**

*   **Shadow Test Suite Composition:** Crucial to represent a diverse range of tests accurately.
*   **Data Storage:** Efficiently storing and processing performance data is vital.
*   **Scalability:** The system must scale effectively with increasing workload.
*   **Cost:** Balancing predictive scaling with resource costs is important.
