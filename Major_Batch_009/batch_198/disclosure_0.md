## Adaptive Proximity-Based Authentication & 'Digital Leash' System

**Concept:** Expanding on the geolocation signature and variance detection, this system introduces a dynamic ‘digital leash’ tied to user routines. Instead of simply triggering a security event when deviation *exceeds* a threshold, it learns and *adapts* to short-term deviations, factoring in contextual data to determine legitimacy. This allows for nuanced security – acknowledging spontaneous changes while flagging genuinely anomalous behavior.  Furthermore, it introduces tiered access control based on proximity to known 'safe zones'.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Mobile Device with:
    *   High-Accuracy GPS (or equivalent location service)
    *   Accelerometer & Gyroscope
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon support
    *   Secure Enclave/TrustZone hardware
*   Optional: BLE Beacons strategically placed in ‘safe zones’ (home, office, frequently visited locations)

**Software Components:**

*   **Routine Learning Module:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on the user’s location, time, speed, and acceleration data.  The RNN predicts the *probability distribution* of the user's likely location at any given time.  Crucially, it doesn't just predict *where* they’ll be, but the *range of acceptable locations* given their historical behavior.
*   **Contextual Awareness Engine:**  Gathers additional data to refine the assessment:
    *   **Calendar Integration:**  Upcoming meetings or events.
    *   **Communication Data:**  Active phone calls or messaging indicating a reason for deviation.
    *   **Environmental Data:**  Traffic conditions, public transport schedules.
    *   **BLE Beacon Detection:**  Confirms presence within a designated ‘safe zone’.
*   **Dynamic Risk Assessment:**  Combines the Routine Learning Module's prediction with the Contextual Awareness Engine's data.  Calculates a ‘risk score’ reflecting the probability that the current location/behavior is legitimate.
*   **Tiered Access Control:**
    *   **Tier 1 (High Confidence - Within 'Safe Zone', No Anomalies):** Full device access, no authentication required.
    *   **Tier 2 (Moderate Confidence - Minor Deviation, Plausible Explanation):** Partial access – core apps available, sensitive apps require biometric confirmation.
    *   **Tier 3 (Low Confidence - Significant Deviation, No Explanation):** Device locked down, remote wipe initiated, alert sent to designated contacts.

**Pseudocode (Risk Score Calculation):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateRiskScore(currentLocation, currentTime, routinePrediction, contextData):

  // Calculate deviation from predicted location
  deviationScore = Distance(currentLocation, routinePrediction.predictedLocation)

  // Factor in context
  contextScore = 0
  IF contextData.hasMeeting THEN
    contextScore = 0.1 // Lower risk if attending a meeting
  ENDIF
  IF contextData.activeCall THEN
    contextScore = 0.2 // Lower risk if on a call
  ENDIF

  // Calculate final risk score (higher = more suspicious)
  riskScore = deviationScore * (1 - contextScore)

  RETURN riskScore
```

**Novelty:**

This isn’t simply about detecting deviations, it’s about *understanding* them. The dynamic risk assessment, layered with contextual awareness and tiered access, creates a far more intelligent and adaptable security system than simple threshold-based alerts. The use of RNNs for probabilistic prediction of routines allows for more granular, nuanced security.
