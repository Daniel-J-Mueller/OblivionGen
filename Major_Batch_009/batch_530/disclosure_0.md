## Dynamic Workflow Persona Creation & Injection

**Concept:** Extend the workflow routing system by dynamically constructing "workflow personas" based on real-time user behavior *prior* to and during the initial chatbot interaction. These personas aren't pre-defined, but *emerge* from the user's actions, influencing the workflow and agent selection.

**Specifications:**

*   **Behavioral Data Capture:** Implement a real-time data stream collecting user interaction data *before* the chatbot engagement. This includes:
    *   Website navigation (pages visited, time spent).
    *   App usage (features accessed, frequency).
    *   Past support tickets/interactions (summarized intent, resolution).
    *   Geographic location (coarse-grained - city/region).
    *   Device type & OS.
*   **Persona Engine:** Develop a machine learning model (likely a transformer-based architecture) that maps the behavioral data to a multi-dimensional "persona vector". This vector represents the user’s likely needs, technical proficiency, preferred communication style, and urgency. Key dimensions should be dynamically weighted based on recent actions.
*   **Workflow Modification:**  The persona vector is injected into the workflow selection process. Instead of simply matching user intent to a pre-defined workflow, the system *modifies* existing workflows or *constructs* entirely new workflows on-the-fly.  Modifications include:
    *   **Step Ordering:** Reordering workflow steps based on the user’s inferred technical skills. (e.g., advanced users skip basic troubleshooting).
    *   **Content Personalization:** Dynamically tailoring messages and instructions within workflow steps. (e.g., providing visual guides for less tech-savvy users).
    *   **Branching Logic:**  Creating conditional branches based on the persona. (e.g., high-priority users are automatically escalated to a senior agent).
*   **Agent Skill Mapping:** The system maintains a database of agent skills *tagged* with corresponding persona dimensions.  Agent selection now prioritizes agents whose skills *align* with the user’s persona. (e.g., a user exhibiting “frustration” gets routed to an agent with strong empathy skills).
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Track the success/failure rate of workflows and agent interactions for each persona.  Continuously refine the persona mapping and workflow construction algorithms based on this feedback.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Selection):**

```
function selectWorkflow(userInput, userPersonaVector):
  workflowCandidates = retrieveWorkflows(userInput)
  scoredWorkflows = []

  for workflow in workflowCandidates:
    score = calculateWorkflowScore(workflow, userPersonaVector)
    scoredWorkflows.append((workflow, score))

  scoredWorkflows.sort(key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)

  selectedWorkflow = scoredWorkflows[0][0]

  # Potentially modify the selected workflow based on userPersonaVector
  modifiedWorkflow = modifyWorkflow(selectedWorkflow, userPersonaVector)

  return modifiedWorkflow
```

```
function modifyWorkflow(workflow, userPersonaVector):
  # Example: Reorder steps if user is technically proficient
  if userPersonaVector["technicalSkill"] > threshold:
    workflow.steps = reorderStepsForExpert(workflow.steps)

  # Example: Add a step for a specific issue identified in the persona
  if userPersonaVector["issueType"] == "billing":
    workflow.steps.insert(2, "billingTroubleshootingStep")

  return workflow
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond intent-based routing to *proactive* personalization, adapting the support experience to the individual user *before* they even articulate their needs fully. It anticipates potential issues and tailors the interaction accordingly, potentially reducing resolution times and improving customer satisfaction. This is akin to a proactive AI concierge.
