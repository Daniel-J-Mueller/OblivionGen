## Dynamic Acoustic Mapping with Spatial Audio Projection

**Concept:** Expand the multi-device audio capture system to create a dynamic, localized spatial audio experience. Instead of simply switching audio streams based on quality, leverage the multi-earbud array to map the acoustic environment *and* project audio tailored to the user’s head position and surrounding space.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each earbud contains:
        *   Minimum 4-microphone array (existing).
        *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – 6DoF (accelerometer, gyroscope) for precise head tracking.
        *   Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio for precise relative positioning between earbuds (sub-centimeter accuracy).
        *   Bone conduction transducer (optional, for directional audio cues).
    *   Mobile Device: Increased processing power for real-time spatial audio rendering.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Acoustic Scene Mapping:**
        *   Earbuds continuously capture audio and IMU data.
        *   UWB data establishes precise inter-earbud distance and orientation.
        *   Algorithm uses captured data to create a dynamic 3D map of the acoustic environment: identifies sound source locations, reflections, and ambient noise.
        *   Mapping leverages beamforming and source localization techniques.
    2.  **Spatial Audio Rendering:**
        *   Mobile device receives acoustic map and head tracking data from earbuds.
        *   Algorithm renders spatial audio based on:
            *   User’s head position (from IMU).
            *   Acoustic map (sound source locations).
            *   Room geometry (user-defined or estimated via computer vision – optional).
        *   Audio is mixed and processed to create a realistic 3D soundscape.
        *   Bone conduction transducers (if present) can be used to provide directional cues, enhancing localization.
    3.  **Dynamic Audio Switching & Enhancement:**
        *   System retains existing audio quality comparison logic.
        *   If primary earbud audio is poor, it seamlessly switches to the higher-quality audio stream from the secondary earbud, *while maintaining spatial audio rendering.*
        *   Noise reduction algorithms are applied *after* spatial audio rendering to minimize artifacts.
    4.  **AI-Driven Acoustic Profiling:**
        *   System learns user's common acoustic environments (home, office, commute).
        *   AI predicts likely sound sources and optimizes spatial audio rendering for those environments.

**Pseudocode (Spatial Audio Rendering):**

```
// Input: acousticMap, headPosition, soundSources, roomGeometry

// 1. Calculate distances and angles between user's head and each sound source
FOR EACH soundSource IN soundSources:
    distance = calculateDistance(headPosition, soundSource.position)
    angle = calculateAngle(headPosition, soundSource.position)

// 2. Apply HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) to each sound source
FOR EACH soundSource IN soundSources:
    filteredAudio = applyHRTF(soundSource.audio, angle, headPosition)

// 3. Apply room impulse response (if room geometry is known)
IF roomGeometry IS known:
    FOR EACH filteredAudio IN filteredAudioList:
        reverberatedAudio = applyRoomImpulseResponse(filteredAudio, roomGeometry)

// 4. Mix all audio sources
mixedAudio = mixAudioSources(reverberatedAudioList)

// Output: mixedAudio (spatial audio)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive gaming & VR/AR experiences.
*   Enhanced video conferencing (directional audio, noise isolation).
*   Personalized soundscapes (adaptive audio for productivity or relaxation).
*   Assistance for visually impaired users (spatial audio cues for navigation).
