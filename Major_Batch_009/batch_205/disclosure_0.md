## Adaptive Granularity Network Advertisement

**Concept:** Expand the specificity levels beyond simply longer/shorter address prefixes. Introduce *dynamic* granularity based on network load, link quality, and real-time performance metrics. Instead of just advertising /24 and /30 prefixes, allow advertisement of prefixes with dynamically determined bit-lengths, potentially non-contiguous bit-lengths, and even advertisement of performance metrics *within* the routing advertisement itself.

**Specs:**

*   **Advertisement Packet Format:** Extend BGP or similar routing protocols to include a “Granularity Control Block” (GCB). The GCB contains:
    *   `Prefix Length`: Standard prefix length as currently used.
    *   `Granularity Mode`:  Enumerated type indicating the granularity control strategy. Options:
        *   `Fixed`: Standard prefix length advertisement.
        *   `Dynamic`: Prefix length adjusts based on internal metrics.
        *   `Metric-Aware`:  Prefix length *and* embedded performance metrics are advertised.
    *   `Performance Metrics`: (Conditional - only present if `Metric-Aware` is selected).  A variable-length field containing:
        *   `Latency`: Measured round-trip time to the network.
        *   `Packet Loss`: Percentage of packets lost on the link.
        *   `Bandwidth Available`: Current available bandwidth.
        *   `Congestion Level`:  An indicator of network congestion.
    *   `Bit-Length Map`: (Conditional - used with `Dynamic` mode). This describes a non-contiguous bit-length. For example, instead of a /24, the map might specify bits 1-8, 16-23, and 32-39, effectively advertising a segmented prefix.

*   **Point-of-Presence (PoP) Control Agent:**
    *   Continuously monitors network performance metrics (latency, packet loss, bandwidth).
    *   Calculates an "Adaptation Score" based on these metrics.
    *   Adjusts `Granularity Mode` and `Prefix Length`/`Bit-Length Map` based on the Adaptation Score.  Higher scores indicate a need for finer granularity or inclusion of performance metrics.
    *   Implements a hysteresis mechanism to prevent rapid flapping of advertisements.

*   **Edge Routing Layer Adaptation:**
    *   Parses the GCB in routing advertisements.
    *   Maintains a routing table augmented with performance metrics (latency, packet loss).
    *   Implements a path selection algorithm that considers both prefix match and performance metrics.  Prefers paths with lower latency and packet loss, even if the prefix match is slightly shorter.
    *   Supports “Quality-of-Service (QoS) aware routing” based on the advertised performance metrics.

**Pseudocode (PoP Control Agent - Adaptation Logic):**

```
function calculateAdaptationScore(latency, packetLoss, bandwidth):
  score = 0
  if latency > threshold_high:
    score += 10
  elif latency > threshold_medium:
    score += 5

  if packetLoss > threshold_high:
    score += 15
  elif packetLoss > threshold_medium:
    score += 8

  if bandwidth < threshold_low:
    score += 12

  return score

function determineGranularityMode(score):
  if score > threshold_high_adaptation:
    return "Metric-Aware"
  elif score > threshold_medium_adaptation:
    return "Dynamic"
  else:
    return "Fixed"

function adjustPrefixLength(mode, currentPrefixLength):
  if mode == "Dynamic":
    // Implement logic to shorten or lengthen prefix based on network load
    // Example: If congestion is high, shorten the prefix to aggregate traffic.
    if congestion > threshold_high:
      return currentPrefixLength - 2
    else:
      return currentPrefixLength + 1
  elif mode == "Metric-Aware":
    // Return a standard prefix length (e.g., /30) for metric advertisement.
    return 30
  else:
    return currentPrefixLength
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple prefix length adjustment and introduces a dynamic, metric-aware approach to network advertisement. The ability to embed real-time performance metrics *within* routing advertisements allows for more informed path selection and improved network performance. The Bit-Length Map adds another dimension of flexibility, allowing for non-contiguous prefixes that can better reflect the underlying network topology.
