## Dynamic Key Aging with Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical key system with a dynamic key aging process tied to a reputation scoring system, allowing for automated key revocation based on perceived risk, and minimizing the blast radius of compromised keys.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation System:**

*   **Data Source:** Monitor data access patterns. Specifically track:
    *   Frequency of key use.
    *   Time of day/week of access.
    *   Data accessed (categorized sensitivity level).
    *   Location of access (IP address/geo-location).
    *   Access success/failure rates.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** Employ a weighted scoring system. Example:
    *   Normal access: +1 point
    *   High-sensitivity data access: +3 points
    *   Access outside typical hours: -2 points
    *   Failed access attempts: -5 points
    *   Access from unusual location: -3 points
*   **Thresholds:** Define thresholds for reputation scores:
    *   *Good*: Score > 70 – Key remains valid.
    *   *Warning*: Score 40-70 – Key usage flagged for monitoring, access logs audited.
    *   *Critical*: Score < 40 – Key automatically revoked.

**2. Key Aging and Rotation:**

*   **Initial Lifetime:** Each key is assigned an initial lifetime (e.g., 30 days).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The key's remaining lifetime is adjusted based on the reputation score:
    *   *Good*: Lifetime extended (up to a maximum).
    *   *Warning*: Lifetime shortened by a percentage.
    *   *Critical*: Key immediately revoked.
*   **Automated Rotation:** When a key is nearing its adjusted expiration, a new key is generated and disseminated through the existing hierarchical system. This rotation is seamless and transparent to the user.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Metadata Extension:**  Extend the existing metadata to include:
    *   Reputation score.
    *   Adjusted expiration date.
    *   Rotation history.
*   **Key Derivation Function Modification:** Modify the key derivation function to incorporate the reputation score as a seed value, creating a unique derived key for each reputation score level.
*   **Data Store Enhancement:** Integrate a reputation data store to track and manage reputation scores for each key. This could be a distributed ledger for added security and auditability.
*    **Pseudocode for Key Derivation:**

```
function deriveKey(baseKey, reputationScore, parameters):
    combinedSeed = hash(baseKey + reputationScore + parameters)
    derivedKey = hash(combinedSeed) // Or other key derivation function
    return derivedKey
```

**4. Security Considerations:**

*   **Reputation System Tamper Resistance:** Protect the reputation system from malicious attacks (e.g., reputation boosting or suppression).
*   **False Positives:** Minimize the risk of false positives leading to unnecessary key revocations.
*   **Auditability:** Maintain a comprehensive audit trail of all reputation changes and key revocations.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond static key hierarchies by introducing a dynamic, risk-aware component.  The reputation system adds a layer of adaptability that traditional hierarchical key management lacks.  It’s a proactive security measure designed to mitigate risks in real-time, rather than relying on scheduled key rotations.  The key derivation function modification using reputation score provides greater dynamism.
