## Acoustic Scene Embedding for Contextual Wake Word Activation

**Concept:** Expand the keyword detection system to incorporate an "acoustic scene embedding" – a learned representation of the surrounding audio environment – to dynamically adjust wake word sensitivity and potentially activate/deactivate the listening system altogether. This leverages the fact that wake words are more likely to be uttered in certain environments (e.g., quiet home) than others (e.g., busy street).

**Specifications:**

1.  **Acoustic Scene Classification Module:**
    *   Input: Continuous audio stream from the microphone.
    *   Process: Employ a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) pre-trained on a large dataset of acoustic scenes (e.g., AudioSet, DCASE). The model outputs a probability distribution over a predefined set of acoustic scene categories (e.g., "home office," "car," "street," "restaurant").
    *   Output: A vector representing the acoustic scene embedding, summarizing the detected environmental characteristics. This vector is normalized.

2.  **Dynamic Sensitivity Adjustment:**
    *   Input: Acoustic scene embedding vector, raw audio data.
    *   Process: Implement a lookup table or trained regression model. This component maps acoustic scene embeddings to a sensitivity scaling factor for the wake word detector.
        *   Example: "Quiet home" -> Sensitivity Scale = 1.0 (normal sensitivity). "Busy street" -> Sensitivity Scale = 0.2 (reduced sensitivity). "Unknown environment" -> Sensitivity Scale = 0.5 (moderate sensitivity).
    *   Output: Scaled sensitivity value.

3.  **Wake Word Detector Integration:**
    *   Input: Raw audio data, Scaled sensitivity value.
    *   Process: Multiply the output score of the existing wake word detector by the scaled sensitivity value before thresholding. This effectively adjusts the threshold for wake word activation.

4.  **Contextual Deactivation:**
    *   Input: Acoustic scene embedding vector.
    *   Process: Define a set of "deactivation scenes" (e.g., "concert," "construction site"). If the acoustic scene embedding strongly indicates one of these scenes, the entire wake word detection system is temporarily deactivated (e.g., for 5 minutes).
    *   Output: Deactivation signal.

5.  **Learning & Personalization:**
    *   Implement a mechanism for the system to learn and adapt the acoustic scene embeddings and sensitivity scaling factors based on user feedback (e.g., false positives/negatives). This could involve online learning or periodic retraining with user-specific data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Continuous Audio Stream
audioData = getAudioStream()

// Acoustic Scene Classification
sceneEmbedding = classifyAcousticScene(audioData)

// Sensitivity Adjustment
sensitivityScale = lookupSensitivityScale(sceneEmbedding)

// Wake Word Detection
wakeWordScore = detectWakeWord(audioData)
adjustedScore = wakeWordScore * sensitivityScale

// Activation Check
if adjustedScore > threshold:
    activateSystem()
    processCommand()

// Deactivation Check
if sceneEmbedding in deactivationScenes:
    deactivateSystem()
    wait(300 seconds) // 5 minutes
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Existing microphone and audio processing hardware can be reused.
*   Increased computational requirements for acoustic scene classification may necessitate a more powerful processor or dedicated hardware accelerator (e.g., DSP, NPU).
*   Potential for increased memory usage for storing acoustic models and embeddings.
