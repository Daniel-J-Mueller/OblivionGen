## Dynamic Data 'Chameleon' Profiles

**Concept:** Extend location-based security to encompass *dynamic* data profiles that change based on a confluence of factors – location, time, user context (role, device type), and inferred risk level.  Instead of a static tag dictating broad security rules, create a system where data ‘chameleons’ adapt its accessibility and presentation based on real-time environmental analysis.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Profile Definition:**

*   **Profile Components:** Each data file (or file type) will have a base profile defined. This profile outlines core security requirements (encryption level, access control lists).  Crucially, it *also* defines a set of ‘sensitivity parameters’ – variables quantifying data sensitivity (e.g., PII score, financial impact score, confidentiality level).
*   **Dynamic Rule Sets:**  Associated with each base profile are multiple dynamic rule sets. These rule sets are defined using a rule engine (see section 3) and are triggered by evaluating incoming sensor/contextual data.
*   **Presentation Layers:**  Data isn't just secured; its *presentation* can change.  Rule sets can dictate a 'sanitized' view of data – masking PII, redacting sensitive information, or displaying only summary statistics – based on context.

**2. Contextual Sensor Integration:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate data from:
    *   **GPS/Location Services:** Precise location data.
    *   **Time/Date:** Current time and date.
    *   **Device Type:**  Mobile, desktop, server, etc.
    *   **Network Information:** Wi-Fi vs. cellular, network security level.
    *   **User Role/Authentication:**  User’s job title, access permissions.
    *   **Behavioral Analysis:**  User activity monitoring – unusual access patterns, file copy attempts. (Requires separate ML model).
    *   **Environmental Sensors:** (Optional) Microphone input (detecting sensitive conversations), camera input (detecting unauthorized photography of documents).
*   **Data Fusion:** A central ‘Context Engine’ collects, filters, and fuses this data into a standardized format.

**3. Rule Engine & Profile Activation:**

*   **Rule Language:**  Employ a declarative rule language (e.g., Drools, Jess). Rules will be structured as:  `IF [Contextual Condition] THEN [Profile Modification]`
    *   Example: `IF Location = "Coffee Shop" AND DeviceType = "Mobile" THEN SetPresentationMode = "SanitizedView"`
    *   Example: `IF BehavioralAnalysis.SuspiciousActivity = TRUE THEN RequireMultiFactorAuthentication`
*   **Profile Activation:** The Rule Engine constantly evaluates incoming contextual data against defined rules. When a rule is triggered, it activates the corresponding profile modification.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a priority system to resolve conflicting rules.  (e.g., security rules always override presentation rules).

**4.  Data Rendering/Access Control:**

*   **Interception Layer:**  Intercept all data requests (file open, render, share).
*   **Dynamic Policy Enforcement:**  Before granting access or rendering data, the system evaluates the active profile based on the current context.
*   **Access Control:** Enforce appropriate access controls (encryption, decryption, masking, redaction).
*   **Auditing:** Log all access attempts and policy changes for security monitoring.



**Pseudocode (Data Access):**

```
function accessData(userID, fileID) {
  context = getContext(userID); // Get location, time, device, etc.
  activeProfile = determineActiveProfile(fileID, context);

  if (activeProfile.accessAllowed(userID)) {
    // Apply any necessary transformations based on profile
    transformedData = applyTransformations(activeProfile, data);
    return transformedData;
  } else {
    logAccessDenied(userID, fileID);
    return Error("Access Denied");
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond static location-based security to a *dynamic*, context-aware system.  The ‘chameleon’ data adapts its accessibility and presentation based on a much wider range of factors, significantly enhancing security and usability. It's a shift from ‘where the data is accessed’ to ‘how the data is presented based on the context of access’.
