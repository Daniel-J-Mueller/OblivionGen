## Adaptive Replica Prioritization & Tiering

**Concept:** Extend replica health monitoring to incorporate performance metrics beyond simple availability. Introduce a tiered replica system where replicas are prioritized based on a dynamic ‘health score’ incorporating both availability *and* read/write latency, and automatically adjust workload distribution accordingly. This moves beyond simply restoring a failed replica to *actively managing* replica quality.

**Specs:**

**1. Health Score Calculation:**

*   **Components:**
    *   *Availability (A):*  Binary (0 or 1) – based on standard health checks.
    *   *Read Latency (RL):* Measured in milliseconds (ms), averaged over a rolling window (e.g., 5 minutes).
    *   *Write Latency (WL):* Measured in milliseconds (ms), averaged over a rolling window (e.g., 5 minutes).
    *   *Resource Utilization (RU):* CPU, memory, disk I/O usage (normalized to 0-1).
*   **Formula:** `HealthScore = (A * WeightA) + ((1 - (RL/MaxRL)) * WeightRL) + ((1 - (WL/MaxWL)) * WeightWL) + ((1-RU) * WeightRU)`
    *   `MaxRL` and `MaxWL` are configurable thresholds.  Values exceeding these thresholds significantly degrade the HealthScore.
    *   `WeightA`, `WeightRL`, `WeightWL`, `WeightRU` are configurable weights allowing prioritization of different factors.

**2. Replica Tiering:**

*   **Tiers:**
    *   *Tier 1 (Gold):* HealthScore > 0.8
    *   *Tier 2 (Silver):* 0.5 < HealthScore <= 0.8
    *   *Tier 3 (Bronze):* HealthScore <= 0.5
*   Replicas are automatically assigned to tiers based on their HealthScore.

**3. Workload Distribution:**

*   **Priority Routing:** Client requests are prioritized to Tier 1 replicas first. If Tier 1 replicas are unavailable or overloaded, requests are routed to Tier 2, then Tier 3.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** The system dynamically adjusts the weight given to each tier based on its capacity and current load.
*   **Read/Write Separation:**  Read requests can be routed to a different tier distribution than write requests.  Writes are always directed to the highest-tier available replica to ensure data consistency.

**4. Automated Rebalancing & Healing:**

*   **Proactive Healing:** If a replica’s HealthScore starts to degrade (approaching the threshold for a lower tier), the system triggers proactive checks (e.g., running diagnostics) and attempts to optimize performance.
*   **Rebalancing:**  If a replica’s HealthScore consistently remains low, the system automatically triggers a rebuild on a different node to create a higher-tier replica.
*   **Tier-Aware Repair:**  Replica repair/rebuild prioritizes restoring higher-tier replicas first.



**Pseudocode (Workload Routing):**

```
function routeRequest(request):
  tier1Replicas = getReplicas(tier=1)
  tier2Replicas = getReplicas(tier=2)
  tier3Replicas = getReplicas(tier=3)

  if (tier1Replicas.size() > 0 and isReplicaAvailable(tier1Replicas[0])):
    return tier1Replicas[0]
  elif (tier2Replicas.size() > 0 and isReplicaAvailable(tier2Replicas[0])):
    return tier2Replicas[0]
  elif (tier3Replicas.size() > 0 and isReplicaAvailable(tier3Replicas[0])):
    return tier3Replicas[0]
  else:
    // No available replicas – handle error/retry
    return error("No available replicas")
```
