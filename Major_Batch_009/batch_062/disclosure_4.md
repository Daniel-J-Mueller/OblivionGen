## Dynamic Policy Orchestration with Contextual Drift Detection

**Specification:** A system for managing user access policies that dynamically adapts based on real-time user behavior and environmental context, moving beyond static policy assignments.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *mapping* policies to users. This design shifts to *observing* user activity and *adjusting* policy enforcement on-the-fly, creating a more granular and responsive security posture. We're not just saying “this user can access this app,” but “this user *is currently behaving* in a way that suggests they should have elevated/reduced access to this service.”

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Sensor Suite:** Collects data on user actions across all connected services. This includes:
    *   Keystroke dynamics.
    *   Mouse movement patterns.
    *   Application usage frequency & duration.
    *   Data access patterns (files, databases, APIs).
    *   Network traffic analysis (origin, destination, volume).
    *   Geolocation (with user consent).
    *   Device fingerprinting.
2.  **Contextual Data Integration:** Combines behavioral data with external contextual information:
    *   Time of day.
    *   Day of week.
    *   User location (office, home, travel).
    *   Network security posture (e.g., connected to a trusted VPN).
    *   Device health (e.g., OS version, antivirus status).
3.  **Drift Detection Engine:** A machine learning model trained to identify deviations from a user’s baseline behavior. This is *not* anomaly detection, but a continuous assessment of how a user’s behavior *shifts* over time.
    *   Uses a rolling time window for baseline calculation (e.g., last 7 days).
    *   Employs statistical methods (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to quantify the degree of drift.
    *   Considers the *combination* of multiple behavioral signals.
4.  **Dynamic Policy Engine:**  Modifies access control policies in real-time based on the output of the Drift Detection Engine.
    *   Utilizes a policy rule engine that can apply different actions based on the degree of drift.
        *   **Example Rules:**
            *   *If* drift score > 0.8 *and* location = unknown *then* require multi-factor authentication.
            *   *If* drift score < 0.2 *and* accessing sensitive data *then* grant temporary elevated privileges.
            *   *If* drift score > 0.5 *and* network connection = untrusted *then* restrict access to critical systems.
    *   Supports "shadowing" - temporarily granting access to a resource while logging all activity for review.

**Pseudocode (Policy Evaluation):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(user, resource, context) {
  driftScore = calculateDriftScore(user);
  
  //Fetch policy rules for this resource
  rules = getPolicyRules(resource);

  for each rule in rules {
    if (rule.condition(user, context, driftScore)) {
      //Apply the rule's action (e.g., grant access, deny access, require MFA)
      applyAction(rule.action);
      return; //Stop evaluating after the first matching rule
    }
  }

  //Default action if no rules match (e.g., deny access)
  denyAccess();
}
```

**Integration with Existing System:**

*   The system leverages the existing directory service for user authentication and initial policy assignment.
*   The Drift Detection Engine sits *on top* of the directory service, providing a dynamic layer of access control.
*   Policy rules are defined in a separate configuration file and can be updated without modifying the core system.



This design moves beyond static permission assignments and focuses on actively understanding user behavior. It allows for a much more nuanced and adaptive security model.
