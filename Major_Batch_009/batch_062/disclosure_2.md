## Adaptive Data Schemas with Client-Specific Views

**Concept:** Extend the 'compute-less authorization' approach by dynamically shaping the data returned to clients based not just on authorization, but also on pre-defined client ‘views’ or ‘profiles’. This moves beyond simply granting/denying access *to* data, and towards shaping *what* data is visible.

**Specs:**

1.  **Client Profile Database:** A database table storing client-specific data schemas. Each entry defines which fields/attributes within a data model are visible to a specific client. This isn’t a filtering operation *after* data retrieval, but a structural definition *before* query generation.  Schema can be defined using a JSON-based structure.

    ```json
    {
      "client_id": "client_123",
      "data_model": "product",
      "visible_fields": ["product_id", "name", "price", "description"],
      "hidden_fields": ["cost", "inventory_level"],
      "transformed_fields": {
          "price": "round(price, 2)" // example transformation - round to 2 decimal places
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Mapping Template Enhancement:** Modify the existing mapping templates to consult the Client Profile Database *during* query generation. The template will dynamically construct the SQL `SELECT` statement to only retrieve fields listed in `visible_fields` for the requesting client. This avoids transferring unnecessary data and improves performance.

    *   **Pseudocode (within mapping template):**

        ```
        function generate_query(api_request):
          client_id = api_request.client_id
          data_model = api_request.data_model
          base_query = "SELECT * FROM " + data_model
          client_profile = get_client_profile(client_id, data_model)

          if client_profile:
            visible_fields = client_profile.visible_fields
            select_fields = ", ".join(visible_fields)
            select_clause = "SELECT " + select_fields + " FROM " + data_model
            base_query = select_clause

          # Apply any WHERE clauses from the API request.
          where_clause = build_where_clause(api_request)
          if where_clause:
            base_query += " WHERE " + where_clause

          return base_query
        ```

3.  **Dynamic Transformation Layer:** Implement a transformation layer within the endpoint that applies any defined transformations to the selected fields before returning the data to the client. This could include data formatting, unit conversions, or simple calculations.

    *   **Pseudocode:**

        ```
        function transform_data(data, client_profile):
          transformed_data = {}
          for field, value in data.items():
            if field in client_profile.transformed_fields:
              transformation = client_profile.transformed_fields[field]
              # Evaluate the transformation expression (using a safe expression evaluator)
              transformed_value = evaluate(transformation, value)
              transformed_data[field] = transformed_value
            else:
              transformed_data[field] = value
          return transformed_data
        ```

4.  **Cache Invalidation:** Implement a cache invalidation strategy for client profiles. If a client profile is updated, all associated cached data for that client should be invalidated.

5.  **API for Profile Management:** Expose an API endpoint for managing client profiles. This should allow administrators to create, update, and delete client profiles.

**Innovation:** This extends ‘compute-less authorization’ beyond simple access control. It enables a more granular and customizable data experience for each client, tailored to their specific needs and permissions. The ability to dynamically shape the data returned reduces network bandwidth, improves performance, and enhances security.  It moves away from a uniform view of data, to a highly individualized view.
