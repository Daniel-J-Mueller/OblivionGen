## Adaptive Packet Reconstruction & Temporal Analysis

**Concept:** Extend mirrored traffic analysis by reconstructing fragmented packets *and* correlating traffic flows across time, identifying anomalous behaviors based on deviations from learned baselines. This goes beyond simple packet capture; it builds a dynamic, temporal understanding of network communication.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Packet Reconstruction Engine (PRE):** Operates inline with the mirrored traffic flow.
    *   Input: Mirrored network traffic (packet stream).
    *   Process:
        1.  Detects fragmented packets (based on IP/TCP/UDP flags).
        2.  Maintains a buffer (RAM/SSD) for assembling fragments belonging to the same flow (identified by 5-tuple: source/destination IP, port, protocol).
        3.  Implements a timeout mechanism for discarding incomplete fragments after a defined period.
        4.  Reconstructs complete packets from fragments.
        5.  Outputs reconstructed packet stream.
*   **Component 2: Temporal Flow Analyzer (TFA):**
    *   Input: Reconstructed packet stream.
    *   Process:
        1.  Establishes flow sessions (based on 5-tuple).
        2.  Collects statistical data for each flow session:
            *   Inter-packet arrival times.
            *   Packet sizes.
            *   Flow duration.
            *   Bytes transferred.
            *   Flags set (SYN, FIN, RST, etc.).
        3.  Implements a baseline learning phase (using a moving average or machine learning model) to establish normal behavior patterns for each flow.
        4.  Real-time anomaly detection:
            *   Calculates deviation from baseline for each statistical parameter.
            *   Applies a weighted scoring system to prioritize anomalies.
            *   Triggers alerts based on anomaly scores exceeding a defined threshold.
*   **Component 3: Metadata Enrichment Module (MEM):**
    *   Input: Reconstructed packets, anomaly alerts.
    *   Process:
        1.  Adds contextual metadata to packets:
            *   Geolocation (IP lookup).
            *   Service identification (port/protocol).
            *   User/application identification (if available).
        2.  Associates anomaly alerts with enriched packet data.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) for storing flow statistics.
    *   Object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for storing enriched packet captures (PCAP).

**Pseudocode (TFA - Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detect_anomaly(flow_stats):
  baseline = get_baseline(flow_stats.source_ip, flow_stats.destination_ip, flow_stats.protocol)

  deviation_score = 0

  # Calculate deviation for each metric
  deviation_score += abs(flow_stats.inter_packet_arrival_time - baseline.inter_packet_arrival_time)
  deviation_score += abs(flow_stats.packet_size - baseline.packet_size)
  deviation_score += abs(flow_stats.flow_duration - baseline.flow_duration)

  # Apply weights (adjust as needed)
  deviation_score *= (0.3 + 0.4 + 0.3)

  # Threshold for anomaly detection
  if deviation_score > anomaly_threshold:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**Scalability:**

*   Distributed architecture: PRE and TFA can be deployed as microservices.
*   Horizontal scaling: Add more instances of each microservice to handle increased traffic.
*   Load balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple instances.
*   Data partitioning: Divide data across multiple storage nodes.
