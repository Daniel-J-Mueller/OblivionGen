## Modular Haptic Feedback Eyewear System

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback directly into the eyewear frame, synchronized with visual information or external stimuli. This moves beyond audio cues for augmented reality experiences, offering a more immersive and intuitive user interface.

**Specs:**

*   **Frame Material:** Conductive polymer composite – flexible, lightweight, and capable of transmitting electrical signals. Primarily injection molded, with localized overmolding for precision haptic element placement.
*   **Haptic Elements:** Micro-pneumatic actuators integrated within the frame's temples and brow bar. Each actuator consists of a miniature air chamber and a flexible membrane. The membrane’s displacement creates localized pressure on the skin. 
*   **Actuator Density:** 1 actuator per 2cm of temple length, 1 actuator per 5cm of brow bar length.
*   **Control System:** A miniature PCB housed within the frame near the hinge. Features a Bluetooth LE module for communication with a host device (smartphone, AR headset).
*   **Power Source:** Rechargeable solid-state battery integrated within the frame (near hinge). Wireless charging capable. Estimated runtime: 4 hours continuous use.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated within the frame to track head position and orientation. This data is used to dynamically adjust haptic feedback patterns.
*   **Software Interface:** SDK provided for developers to create custom haptic patterns and integrate them with AR applications. Support for real-time haptic streaming.
*   **Haptic Modes:**
    *   *Directional Cues*: Subtle pressure pulses indicate the direction of points of interest in AR environments.
    *   *Proximity Alerts*: Increasing pressure intensity warns the user of approaching obstacles.
    *   *Confirmation Feedback*: Distinct pressure patterns acknowledge user input or successful task completion.
    *   *Emotional Feedback*: Subtle pressure variations convey emotional cues from AR characters or virtual environments.
*   **Assembly:** Frame is constructed from multiple modular pieces. The frame will snap together. Conductive adhesive is used to bond the PCB and battery in place. The haptic actuators will then be embedded and sealed with a flexible, biocompatible sealant.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Control Loop):**

```
// Initialize sensors, Bluetooth connection, and haptic actuators

while (running) {

    // Read head position/orientation from IMU
    head_pose = read_imu()

    // Receive AR data from host device (points of interest, proximity alerts, etc.)
    ar_data = receive_ar_data()

    // Calculate haptic feedback pattern based on AR data and head pose
    haptic_pattern = calculate_haptic_pattern(ar_data, head_pose)

    // Send haptic commands to actuators
    send_haptic_commands(haptic_pattern)

    // Delay to control feedback rate
    delay(10ms)
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simple vibration-based haptics. By utilizing micro-pneumatic actuators and a dynamic control system, it delivers precise and nuanced pressure patterns that can enhance immersion and provide a more intuitive user experience. The modular design allows for customization and future upgrades.
