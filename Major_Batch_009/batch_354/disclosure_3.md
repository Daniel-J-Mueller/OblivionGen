## Adaptive Haptic Notification System - ‘SenseRing’

**Core Concept:** Expand the ring’s functionality beyond simple button presses and motion detection to incorporate localized, dynamic haptic feedback patterns conveying detailed information *without* relying on visual or audible cues. This builds on the existing notification infrastructure but replaces or augments it with nuanced tactile signals.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Array:** Integrate a miniature array of independently controllable linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or piezoelectric actuators embedded within the ring’s band. Minimum 16 actuators, optimally 32+ for greater resolution. These should be positioned to create focused pressure points on the user’s finger.
*   **Proximity Sensor:** An infrared or capacitive proximity sensor to detect finger position and ensure correct haptic feedback delivery.
*   **Microcontroller:** A low-power ARM Cortex-M series microcontroller with sufficient processing power to manage haptic patterns and wireless communication.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Bluetooth 5.0 or higher for low-latency communication with the user device.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable solid-state battery (miniature) with wireless charging capability.
*   **Materials:** Biocompatible, flexible materials (e.g., silicone, TPU) for comfortable wear.

**Software/Firmware Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Language:** Develop a “haptic language” where distinct pressure patterns, frequencies, and locations on the finger represent specific notifications or data points.
    *   Example: A slow, pulsing pattern on the top of the finger = incoming phone call.
    *   Example: Rapid, localized taps on the side of the finger = new email.
    *   Example: A swirling pattern = GPS navigation turn imminent.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Implement machine learning algorithms to personalize haptic patterns based on user preferences and context.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate with user device sensors (location, activity, calendar) to deliver relevant haptic notifications.
*   **Haptic API:** Provide an API for developers to create custom haptic notifications for their apps.
*   **Priority System:** Notifications should be prioritized. High priority events will override/augment existing patterns.
*   **“Haptic DND”:** A mode that limits or silences haptic notifications.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Event Loop

while (true) {

    // Receive notification data from user device

    notification = receiveNotification();

    // Determine notification priority

    priority = determinePriority(notification);

    // Determine appropriate haptic pattern

    pattern = selectHapticPattern(notification, priority);

    // Modify pattern based on user preferences (learned over time)

    pattern = personalizeHapticPattern(pattern, userProfile);

    // Deliver haptic pattern to actuators

    deliverHapticPattern(pattern);

    // Log user response (e.g., gesture, tap) for learning

    logUserResponse();
}
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simple vibration alerts. The focus is on creating *meaningful* tactile communication—a language of touch—that's customizable, context-aware, and unobtrusive. The potential for nuanced, personalized notifications, especially for users who are visually or audibly impaired, is significant.  The adaptive learning component ensures that the system becomes increasingly intuitive and effective over time.  It’s not just about *feeling* a notification; it’s about *understanding* it through touch.
