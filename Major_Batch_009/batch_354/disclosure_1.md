## Dynamic Content "Bubbles" with Predictive Context

**Concept:** Extend the preview window idea to create dynamically resizing and repositioning "content bubbles" overlaid on the primary content. These bubbles aren't fixed-size previews, but intelligently sized and positioned snippets of content *predicted* to be relevant based on user interaction and a knowledge graph.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** “Context Engine.” This analyzes user reading/interaction patterns (dwell time, highlighting, bookmarking, navigation history) and consults a knowledge graph constructed from the content item (e.g., book, document).
*   **Bubble Generation:** Based on Context Engine output, generate small, semi-transparent "content bubbles." These bubbles display relevant snippets—definitions of unfamiliar terms, related characters/locations, historical context, alternative perspectives, etc.
*   **Dynamic Sizing/Positioning:** Bubble size is proportional to predicted relevance. Positioning is context-aware:
    *   Near terminology being read.
    *   Near characters/locations mentioned.
    *   Along the reading flow (but avoiding obstruction).
    *   Avoid overlapping primary content as much as possible.
*   **Bubble Interaction:**
    *   **Hover:** Briefly highlight the related section in the main content.
    *   **Tap/Click:** Expand the bubble to a larger preview window or navigate directly to the relevant section.
    *   **Dismiss:** Swiping or long-pressing dismisses the bubble.
*   **User Customization:**
    *   Bubble Density: Control the number of bubbles displayed.
    *   Bubble Type: Choose between different bubble content types (definitions, related characters, historical context, etc.).
    *   Bubble Appearance: Adjust bubble color, transparency, and size.
*   **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Automated extraction of entities, relationships, and concepts from the content item. Machine learning models used to identify and prioritize relevant information.
*   **Context Engine Pseudocode:**

    ```
    function generateContextBubbles(content, userInteraction, knowledgeGraph):
        bubbles = []
        for entity in knowledgeGraph.getRelevantEntities(content, userInteraction):
            relevanceScore = calculateRelevance(entity, content, userInteraction)
            if relevanceScore > threshold:
                bubble = createBubble(entity.contentSnippet, relevanceScore)
                bubbles.append(bubble)
        return bubbles
    ```

*   **Rendering Engine Requirements:**
    *   Overlay rendering capable of displaying semi-transparent elements.
    *   Efficient collision detection to prevent bubble overlap.
    *   Smooth animation for bubble resizing and repositioning.
*   **Potential Expansion:**
    *   Integrate with external knowledge sources (Wikipedia, dictionaries).
    *   Allow users to contribute to the knowledge graph.
    *   Personalized recommendations based on user reading history.
