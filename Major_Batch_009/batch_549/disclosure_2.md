## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Mapping for Indoor Drone Navigation

**Core Concept:** Leverage the principles of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) alongside FTM to create a dynamic, self-organizing map of RF resonance frequencies within a dwelling. This map isn't about *location* directly, but about creating a “fingerprint” of the environment based on how RF signals propagate and reflect, then using that fingerprint for robust drone navigation – even with limited visibility or GPS signal.

**System Specs:**

*   **Drone Hardware:**
    *   Multiple Software Defined Radios (SDRs): Covering a broad spectrum (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 60 GHz).
    *   High-Precision IMU: Inertial Measurement Unit for short-term drift compensation.
    *   Downward-Facing Microphone Array: For ambient sound mapping (supplemental to RF data).
    *   Processing Unit: Edge computing capable for real-time signal processing and map building.
*   **Fixed Infrastructure:**
    *   Low-Power RF Beacon Network: Strategically placed, ultra-low power RF beacons transmitting unique, identifiable signals. These *don't* need precise location data initially.
    *   Central Server (Cloud/Local): For initial ART model training and long-term map storage/updates.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   RF Signal Analyzer: Processes raw SDR data, identifying beacon signals and ambient RF noise.
    *   ART Neural Network:
        *   Input Layer: Receives processed RF signature data (signal strength, frequency shifts, phase changes, and ambient RF noise levels)
        *   Resonance Layer: Dynamically adjusts weights and thresholds to categorize similar RF environments.
        *   Category Layer: Outputs a "resonance category" representing the current RF environment.
    *   SLAM Module (RF-SLAM): Integrates resonance categories with IMU data to build a dynamic map of the dwelling, focusing on *RF characteristics* rather than visual features.
    *   Navigation Planner: Uses the RF-SLAM map to plan optimal paths for the drone, avoiding obstacles and maintaining connectivity with the RF beacons.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Mapping Phase:** The drone systematically explores the dwelling, collecting RF signature data at various locations. The ART network is trained during this phase, learning to categorize different RF environments based on beacon signals, reflections, and ambient noise.
2.  **Dynamic Map Building:** As the drone moves, the ART network continuously updates the RF-SLAM map. The map represents the dwelling as a network of resonance categories, connected by estimated distances based on IMU data.
3.  **Real-Time Navigation:**  When the drone receives a navigation request, the Navigation Planner uses the RF-SLAM map to identify the optimal path to the destination. The Planner prioritizes paths with strong resonance signatures and minimal obstacles. The drone adjusts its path in real-time based on changes in the RF environment.

**Pseudocode (Navigation Planner):**

```
function planPath(startNode, endNode, RF_SLAM_Map):
  // Initialize open and closed sets
  openSet = [startNode]
  closedSet = []

  // Calculate heuristic (estimated distance to goal) - based on RF similarity
  function heuristic(node, goalNode):
    return RF_signature_distance(node.RF_signature, goalNode.RF_signature)

  while openSet is not empty:
    currentNode = node with lowest fScore in openSet (fScore = gScore + heuristic)
    if currentNode is endNode:
      return reconstructPath(currentNode)

    openSet.remove(currentNode)
    closedSet.add(currentNode)

    for neighbor in neighbors(currentNode):
      if neighbor in closedSet:
        continue

      tentative_gScore = gScore[currentNode] + distance(currentNode, neighbor)

      if neighbor not in openSet or tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]:
        gScore[neighbor] = tentative_gScore
        fScore[neighbor] = tentative_gScore + heuristic(neighbor, endNode)
        parent[neighbor] = currentNode
        if neighbor not in openSet:
          openSet.add(neighbor)
  return null // No path found

function reconstructPath(node):
  path = []
  while node is not null:
    path.insert(0, node)
    node = parent[node]
  return path
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Robustness:** Less susceptible to visual obstructions or poor lighting conditions.
*   **Accuracy:** Resonance mapping provides a detailed fingerprint of the environment.
*   **Scalability:** Can be adapted to larger or more complex environments.
*   **Reduced Dependency on GPS:** Minimizes reliance on external positioning systems.
