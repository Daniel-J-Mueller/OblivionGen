## Adaptive Data Sharding based on Query Entropy

**Concept:** Introduce a dynamic data sharding strategy that adjusts shard assignments based on the entropy of incoming queries. This aims to optimize query performance by proactively moving frequently accessed data closer to the processing nodes, and distributing load more evenly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:** Stream of incoming queries (SQL or equivalent).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze queries to identify accessed tables and columns.
    *   Calculate query entropy using Shannon Entropy or similar metric. Higher entropy indicates a wider distribution of data access, lower entropy indicates focused access.
    *   Weight entropy calculation based on query frequency. Frequent queries have a greater impact on the entropy score.
*   **Output:** Entropy score for each table, updated in real-time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_table_entropy(query_stream):
  table_access_counts = {}
  for query in query_stream:
    accessed_tables = extract_accessed_tables(query)
    for table in accessed_tables:
      if table in table_access_counts:
        table_access_counts[table] += 1
      else:
        table_access_counts[table] = 1

  total_accesses = sum(table_access_counts.values())
  entropy_scores = {}
  for table, count in table_access_counts.items():
    probability = count / total_accesses
    entropy = -probability * log2(probability) # Shannon entropy
    entropy_scores[table] = entropy

  return entropy_scores
```

**2. Shard Migration Manager:**

*   **Input:** Entropy scores from the Entropy Calculation Module, current shard assignments, system load metrics (CPU, memory, I/O).
*   **Process:**
    *   Define a threshold for entropy. Tables with entropy exceeding the threshold are considered candidates for shard migration.
    *   Identify potential migration targets – nodes with available resources and low load.
    *   Evaluate migration cost – network bandwidth, data transfer time, disruption to ongoing queries.
    *   Prioritize migrations based on cost/benefit analysis. Higher benefit (reduced latency, increased throughput) and lower cost migrations are prioritized.
    *   Initiate shard migrations – transparently move shards to target nodes without interrupting existing queries. Use a rolling migration strategy to minimize downtime.
    *   Monitor migration progress and adjust strategy as needed.
*   **Output:** Instructions for shard migration, updated shard assignments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function manage_shard_migration(entropy_scores, shard_assignments, system_load):
  migration_candidates = []
  for table, entropy in entropy_scores.items():
    if entropy > entropy_threshold:
      migration_candidates.append(table)

  for table in migration_candidates:
    best_target_node = find_best_target_node(table, system_load) # based on load, resources, network proximity
    migration_cost = calculate_migration_cost(table, best_target_node)
    benefit = calculate_migration_benefit(table, best_target_node)

    if benefit > migration_cost:
      initiate_shard_migration(table, best_target_node)
```

**3. Data Replication & Consistency:**

*   Employ a data replication strategy (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure data consistency during and after shard migrations.
*   Use a distributed transaction manager to guarantee atomicity and isolation of transactions that span multiple shards.

**4. System Architecture Integration:**

*   Integrate the Entropy Calculation Module and Shard Migration Manager into the existing database engine head node(s).
*   Utilize the distributed storage service as the underlying storage layer for shards.

**Novelty:** The system dynamically adjusts data sharding based on query entropy, unlike static or rule-based sharding strategies.  This enables proactive optimization of query performance and load balancing in response to changing data access patterns.  The combination of entropy calculation, cost/benefit analysis, and transparent shard migration provides a novel approach to adaptive data management.
