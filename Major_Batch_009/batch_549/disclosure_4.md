## Dynamic Bellows Guard with Integrated Item Redirect

**Concept:** Expand the function of the bellows guard beyond simple blockage. Implement a system where the guard *actively redirects* items that approach the bellows, guiding them toward a designated ‘safe zone’ on the carrier surface. This avoids complete stoppage and potential downstream jamming.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Guard Material:** Lightweight, high-strength polymer composite (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced nylon) with a slightly flexible outer surface. This allows for minimal impact force during redirection.

2.  **Actuation:** Each guard incorporates a small, linear actuator (piezoelectric preferred for speed and precision) at its base, capable of controlled tilting (0-30 degrees) towards the carrier surface.

3.  **Sensing:** A miniature Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor array integrated into the guard’s leading edge. This array continuously scans for approaching items, measuring distance and velocity.  Sensor resolution: 1cm accuracy at 1m distance. Frame rate: 60Hz.

4.  **Control Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION ItemApproachDetected(distance, velocity):
  IF distance < 20cm AND velocity > 5cm/s THEN
    calculateRedirectAngle = arctan(velocity / distance)
    actuateGuard(calculateRedirectAngle)
  ELSE
    actuateGuard(0) //Return to neutral position
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION actuateGuard(angle):
  // Send signal to linear actuator to tilt guard to specified angle
  // Implement safety limits: Max angle = 30 degrees
END FUNCTION
```

5.  **Guard Geometry:**  The vertical extension isn’t a simple flat plane. It incorporates a shallow concave curve facing the carrier surface. This assists in channeling items toward the redirect zone and reducing rebound.  Curvature radius: 20cm.

6.  **Mounting System:** The base is designed for rapid mounting/removal via a magnetic quick-release mechanism. This allows for easy adjustments and maintenance. Base dimensions: 10cm x 5cm.

7. **Power/Communication:** Wireless power transfer (inductive charging) and short-range wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy) for status monitoring and configuration.

8. **Integration with Existing System:** The system requires software integration with the flat sorter’s control system. The sorter’s sensors must feed item position and velocity data to the bellows guard control system. This creates a coordinated ‘handoff’ between item tracking and redirection.

9. **Safety Features:**
   *   Emergency stop mechanism: Immediately returns all guards to a neutral position.
   *   Force limiting: The actuators are programmed to limit the maximum force applied during redirection to prevent damage to items.
   *   Fail-safe mode: If communication is lost, guards default to a neutral position.
