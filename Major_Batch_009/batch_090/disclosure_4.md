## Dynamic Service Bundling & Predictive Pricing

**Concept:** Expand the idea of configurable pricing beyond simple fee allocation. Introduce a system that *dynamically bundles* invocable services based on predicted end-user needs, and presents a *single*, bundled price. This isn’t about splitting a bill; it's about creating a new service offering *composed* of existing services, with a price determined by predictive analytics.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Need Engine (PNE):**
    *   Input: End-user profile data (usage history, demographics, stated preferences, application context – e.g., what application is requesting services).
    *   Processing: Machine learning model trained to predict likely future invocable service usage.  Model outputs a probability distribution across available services, weighted by estimated usage intensity and duration.  This is *not* just about predicting what service will be used, but *how much*.
    *   Output:  A "Service Bundle Recommendation" – a prioritized list of invocable services with predicted usage levels.

*   **Component 2: Dynamic Bundle Assembler (DBA):**
    *   Input: Service Bundle Recommendation from PNE, current pricing for all invocable services, application-defined pricing overrides.
    *   Processing:
        1.  Constructs a "Virtual Service Bundle" based on the top N (configurable) recommendations from the PNE.
        2.  Calculates a "Base Bundle Price" – the sum of the predicted usage costs for each service in the bundle, using standard pricing.
        3.  Applies application-defined pricing overrides (as in the original patent) to adjust the price.
        4.  Optimizes bundle composition:  Iteratively removes lower-priority services from the bundle and re-calculates the price, seeking the maximum price point while maintaining a "utility score" (a weighted sum of predicted usage for the remaining services).  This seeks to balance price with perceived value.
        5.  Generates a single "Bundled Price" for the complete service offering.

*   **Component 3: Real-Time Usage Tracking & Adjustment:**
    *   Monitor actual usage of each service within the bundle.
    *   If actual usage deviates significantly from predictions (configurable threshold), dynamically adjust the bundled price.  This could involve:
        *   Offering discounted rates for unused capacity.
        *   Applying overage charges for excessive usage.
        *   Recommending alternative service bundles.

*   **API Integration:**
    *   Applications request services through a unified API endpoint, providing user context and requesting a "Dynamic Bundle."
    *   The system returns a bundled price and a unique bundle identifier.
    *   All service usage is tracked against the bundle identifier.

**Pseudocode (DBA):**

```
function assembleDynamicBundle(userContext, serviceBundleRecommendation):
  baseBundlePrice = 0
  virtualBundle = []

  for service in serviceBundleRecommendation:
    predictedUsage = service.predictedUsage
    servicePrice = getServicePrice(service, predictedUsage)
    baseBundlePrice += servicePrice
    virtualBundle.append(service)

  optimizedBundle = optimizeBundle(virtualBundle, baseBundlePrice) //Iterative removal algorithm

  bundledPrice = calculateBundledPrice(optimizedBundle) //Applies overrides

  return bundledPrice, optimizedBundle
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simply allocating costs to existing services. It creates *new* service offerings that are dynamically composed and priced, based on predictive analytics.  This could enable tiered service models, personalized pricing, and increased revenue opportunities.
