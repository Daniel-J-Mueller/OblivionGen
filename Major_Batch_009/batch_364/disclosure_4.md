## Dynamic Presence Sculpting with Generative Models

**Concept:** Expand beyond static availability indicators to create *dynamic presence sculptures* – AI-generated representations of a user’s state, tailored to each service provider and continuously refined based on interaction feedback. This goes beyond simply indicating “available” or “busy” – it actively *constructs* a presence representation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Extraction:**

*   **Input Streams:**
    *   Presence-event notifications (as defined in the patent).
    *   Sensor data (location, motion, ambient sound, light levels – optional, but highly valuable).
    *   Communication metadata (tone analysis of voice/text, communication frequency with specific contacts).
    *   Application usage data (which apps are running, for how long, intensity of usage).
    *   Explicit User Input (mood sliders, “focus mode” toggles, preferred communication styles).
*   **Feature Engineering:**  Extract meaningful features from each input stream. Examples:
    *   *Activity Level:* (derived from motion sensors and app usage) – Low, Medium, High.
    *   *Cognitive Load:* (derived from communication metadata and app usage) – Relaxed, Focused, Stressed.
    *   *Social Engagement:* (frequency and nature of communication) – Open, Reserved, Isolated.
    *   *Environmental Context:* (location, time of day, ambient conditions).

**2. Generative Presence Model:**

*   **Architecture:** Employ a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). VAEs provide a smoother latent space for interpolation, GANs potentially offer higher fidelity representations.
*   **Training Data:** Historical presence-event data *per service provider*. The model learns to associate specific event patterns with desired presence representations for each provider.
*   **Service Provider Specific Models:**  Critical. Each service provider has a unique model trained on their interaction history with the user. This allows for tailored presence representations.
*   **Latent Space:** The latent space represents a ‘presence vector’ – a multi-dimensional encoding of the user's state.

**3. Presence Sculpture Generation:**

*   **Real-time Inference:**  As new presence-event data arrives, encode it into the latent space using the appropriate service provider’s model.
*   **Decoding & Visualization:** Decode the latent vector to generate a "Presence Sculpture" – a dynamic representation of the user’s state.  This is *not* a literal 3D sculpture, but a data structure that encapsulates the user's state.  Examples of components within the Sculpture:
    *   *Availability Score:* (0-100) – derived from the latent vector.
    *   *Communication Preference:* (Text, Voice, Email, None) – inferred from the latent vector.
    *   *Interruption Tolerance:* (High, Medium, Low) – indicates how easily the user can be interrupted.
    *   *Contextual Notes:* (e.g., “In deep work session,” “Driving,” “Available for quick questions”).
*   **Output Formats:** Adaptable to various service provider interfaces. Examples:
    *   Simple availability flag (for basic services).
    *   Rich data structure (for more sophisticated services).
    *   Natural language description (e.g., “User is currently focused and prefers email communication”).

**4. Feedback Loop & Model Refinement:**

*   **Explicit Feedback:** Allow users to provide direct feedback on the generated presence sculptures (e.g., “This representation is accurate,” “This is not helpful”).
*   **Implicit Feedback:** Monitor service provider interactions. If a service provider repeatedly ignores or overrides the generated presence information, that signals a mismatch and triggers model retraining.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Retrain the models periodically with new data and feedback to improve accuracy and personalization.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// For each service provider:
Service_Provider_Model = Train_VAE(Historical_Data_For_Provider)

// Real-time processing:
New_Presence_Event = Receive_Event()
Features = Extract_Features(New_Presence_Event)
Latent_Vector = Encode(Features, Service_Provider_Model)
Presence_Sculpture = Decode(Latent_Vector)
Send_Presence_Sculpture_To_Service_Provider()

// Feedback loop:
User_Feedback = Receive_Feedback()  // or implicit feedback from service provider
Retrain_VAE(Historical_Data + Feedback)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Emotion Detection:** Integrate emotion detection from audio or video data to enrich the presence representation.
*   **Predictive Presence:**  Use time series analysis to predict future availability and proactively adjust presence representations.
*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Combine data from wearable sensors, smart home devices, and other sources to create a more comprehensive view of the user's state.
