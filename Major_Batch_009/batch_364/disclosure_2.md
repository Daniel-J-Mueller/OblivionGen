## Dynamic Destination Region Generation via Predictive Text & Geographic Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the destination region functionality by allowing users to *predictively generate* destination regions based on typed input *and* current geographic location. This moves beyond static, pre-defined shipping addresses.

**Specs:**

1.  **Destination Input Field:** Implement a unified input field on the network page labeled “Ship To…” or similar. This field accepts free-form text input.
2.  **Geographic Location Access:** The system must access the user’s current location (with user permission, obviously). This can be through IP address geolocation or, ideally, device GPS if available.
3.  **Predictive Address Completion:** As the user types into the “Ship To…” field, the system queries a geocoding API (Google Maps, Mapbox, etc.). The API provides address suggestions based on the typed input *and* prioritizes results that are geographically close to the user’s detected location.
4.  **Dynamic Destination Region Creation:**
    *   When the user selects a suggested address (or completes a valid address), a new destination region is *dynamically created* on the network page. This region is visually distinct from pre-existing shipping addresses.
    *   The newly created region includes the address details (name, street, city, state, zip) for confirmation.
    *   The stacked item icons can then be dragged and dropped to this new region as before.
5.  **"Nearby" Suggestion:** If the user types only partial information (e.g., “Mom’s”), the system displays a "Nearby" suggestion with a list of addresses within a defined radius of the user’s location matching the partial input.
6.  **"Recent" Destinations:** Display a list of the user's recent shipping destinations below the input field for quick selection.
7.  **Address Validation:** Implement address validation to ensure the entered address is deliverable.
8.  **“Add to Address Book” Option:** Allow users to save newly created addresses to a personal address book for future use.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION handleDestinationInput(inputText):
  userLocation = getCurrentUserLocation() // Get user's location (with permission)

  addressSuggestions = geocodingAPI.getAddressSuggestions(inputText, userLocation)

  display addressSuggestions to user

  IF user selects an address suggestion:
    create new destination region on network page
    populate region with address details
    enable drag-and-drop functionality for item icons
  ELSE IF user types partial information AND location available:
    display "Nearby" address suggestions based on partial input and location
  ELSE:
    // Handle invalid or incomplete input

FUNCTION getCurrentUserLocation():
  // Implement logic to access user location (with permission)
  // Return location coordinates or null if access is denied

```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **"Send to Nearest Store" Option:** Integrate a store locator and offer an option to ship items to the nearest physical store.
*   **“Quick Ship to Me” Button:** Automatically populate the destination region with the user’s default shipping address.
*   **Integration with Contact List:** Allow users to select shipping addresses from their device’s contact list.
