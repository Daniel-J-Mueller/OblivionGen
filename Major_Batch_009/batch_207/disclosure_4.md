## Device Representation Orchestration with Temporal Shifting

**Concept:** Extend device representation functionality by enabling "temporal shifting" – creating and managing multiple, time-stamped device representations to predict and proactively respond to device behavior, not just react to current state.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components**

*   **Temporal Representation Manager (TRM):** A service responsible for creating, storing, and retrieving time-stamped device representations. It builds on the existing device shadowing service.
*   **Prediction Engine (PE):**  Analyzes historical device representations (stored by TRM) and uses machine learning models to predict future device states.
*   **Proactive Command Executor (PCE):**  Executes commands based on predictions from the PE, influencing the device *before* an event actually occurs.
*   **Representation History Store:**  A time-series database optimized for storing and retrieving device representations with associated timestamps.

**II. Data Structure – Time-Stamped Device Representation**

```
{
  "device_id": "unique_device_identifier",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "state": {
    //Existing device state variables
  },
  "predicted_state": {
    //State variables predicted by the PE
  },
  "confidence_level": float (0.0 - 1.0) //Confidence in the predicted state
}
```

**III. Operational Flow**

1.  **State Capture:** The existing device shadowing service continues to capture and maintain the current device representation. Each update is also timestamped and stored in the Representation History Store by the TRM.
2.  **Historical Data Training:** The PE periodically trains on historical device representations to create predictive models for each device (or groups of similar devices).
3.  **Prediction Generation:** The PE continuously generates predicted device states, alongside a confidence level, based on recent history. These predictions are appended to the current device representation as "predicted_state".
4.  **Proactive Command Execution:**  The PCE monitors predicted states. If a predicted state violates predefined thresholds or indicates a potential issue, the PCE can execute commands to proactively mitigate the risk.
    *   Example: If the PE predicts a battery will fall below a critical level within the hour, the PCE could proactively initiate a power-saving mode.
5.  **Confirmation & Adjustment:**  The device reports its actual state after executing a PCE command. This feedback is used to refine the PE's models and improve prediction accuracy.

**IV. Pseudocode – PCE Command Logic**

```
function executeProactiveCommand(device_id, predicted_state, confidence_level) {
  if (confidence_level > threshold) {
    if (predicted_state.battery_level < critical_level) {
      command = "enter_power_saving_mode"
      executeDeviceCommand(device_id, command)
    }
    // Additional proactive command rules
  }
}
```

**V. API Extensions**

*   `GET /devices/{device_id}/representations?timestamp={timestamp}`:  Retrieve a specific device representation at a given timestamp.
*   `POST /devices/{device_id}/representations`:  Submit a custom device representation (for testing or simulation).
*   `GET /devices/{device_id}/predictions`:  Retrieve the current predicted device state.
