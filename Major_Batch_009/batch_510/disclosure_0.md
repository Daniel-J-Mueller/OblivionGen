## Adaptive Frequency Allocation for Dedicated Timing Networks

**Concept:** Extend the dedicated timing network concept by introducing dynamic frequency allocation based on host compute load and timing accuracy requirements. Current dedicated networks operate on fixed frequencies. This introduces latency and bandwidth limitations. Adaptive frequency allocation allows the network to prioritize timing data delivery to hosts demanding the highest precision, while reducing bandwidth consumption for less critical instances.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Dedicated Timing Network Switches: Equipped with frequency scaling capabilities and real-time load monitoring. Each port must support a range of frequencies (e.g., 1 MHz to 10 MHz).
    *   Host Timing Adapters: PCIe cards with FPGA logic capable of receiving and processing frequency-scaled timing signals. Must include a local oscillator capable of frequency adjustment and buffering.
    *   Host Compute Load Sensors: Software agents on each host measuring CPU usage, memory pressure, and I/O activity.
*   **Software:**
    *   Centralized Timing Manager (CTM): Software running on a dedicated server. Monitors host compute loads and dynamically adjusts frequency allocation across the dedicated timing network. Implements a priority queue based on user-defined service level agreements (SLAs).
    *   Host Agent: Software running on each host communicating with the CTM, reporting compute load, and receiving frequency adjustment commands.
    *   Frequency Allocation Algorithm: A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller within the CTM.
        *   **Proportional Term:**  Responds to the current difference between desired and actual timing accuracy.
        *   **Integral Term:**  Corrects for accumulated errors over time.
        *   **Derivative Term:**  Anticipates future errors based on the rate of change of timing accuracy.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   Frequency Adjustment Messages: UDP-based messages between the CTM and host agents.  Messages contain the desired frequency for the host's timing adapter.
    *   Timing Accuracy Reports:  UDP-based messages from host agents to the CTM, reporting the measured timing accuracy (e.g., jitter, offset).
*   **Pseudocode (Frequency Allocation Loop - CTM):**

```
initialize priority queue (Host, DesiredFrequency)

loop:
    for each Host in queue:
        currentLoad = getComputeLoad(Host)
        desiredAccuracy = getAccuracyRequirement(Host)
        
        if currentLoad > HighThreshold:
            reduceFrequency(Host)
        elif currentLoad < LowThreshold and desiredAccuracy == High:
            increaseFrequency(Host)
        else:
            maintainFrequency(Host)
            
        updatePriority(Host) // Adjust position in queue based on new criteria
    
    sleep(10ms)
```

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Static Allocation:**  Manual configuration of frequencies for each host.
    *   **Dynamic Allocation:** Automatic frequency adjustment based on real-time conditions.
    *   **Hybrid Mode:** Combines static and dynamic allocation, allowing administrators to define minimum and maximum frequencies for each host.
*   **Scalability:** The CTM should be designed to handle a large number of hosts (e.g., thousands) using a distributed architecture.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to detect and mitigate timing network failures.
