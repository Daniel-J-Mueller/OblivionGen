## Adaptive Spatial Echo Cancellation with Learned Room Impulse Responses

**Concept:** Extend cascade echo cancellation by incorporating learned spatial information about the acoustic environment. Instead of solely relying on signal strength comparisons for dominant/weak reference signals, leverage a neural network to estimate and apply room impulse responses (RIRs) to spatially de-correlate and cancel echoes. This allows for more robust cancellation even when reference signals are closely correlated or weak.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 4 microphones), dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) or access to a cloud-based NPU for real-time processing. Standard audio codecs/interfaces.
*   **Software:** Python-based training pipeline (TensorFlow/PyTorch), C++ runtime for embedded deployment.

**Modules:**

1.  **RIR Estimation Network:**
    *   **Input:** Raw audio from the microphone array.
    *   **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with recurrent layers (LSTM/GRU) to capture temporal dependencies.
    *   **Output:** Estimated RIR for each microphone position, representing the acoustic path from each loudspeaker to each microphone.
    *   **Training Data:**  Synthetically generated audio data with various room geometries, materials, and loudspeaker/microphone positions.  Real-world data collected with known impulse response measurement techniques (sweep signals, balloon bursts) used for fine-tuning.
2.  **Spatial De-correlation Module:**
    *   **Input:**  Reference audio signals, microphone audio signals, estimated RIRs.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Convolve the reference signals with their respective RIRs to model the echo arriving at each microphone.
        *   Apply spatial filtering (beamforming, delay-and-sum) to the reference signals *before* echo cancellation to emphasize desired signals and suppress noise/reverberation.
        *   Calculate the spatial correlation between reference signals and microphone signals.
    *   **Output:** Pre-processed reference signals and spatial correlation matrix.
3.  **Adaptive Echo Cancellation:**
    *   **Input:** Pre-processed reference signals, microphone signals, spatial correlation matrix.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Implement cascade echo cancellation (as in the source patent), but adapt filter coefficients based on *both* signal strength and spatial correlation.  Higher spatial correlation indicates a stronger echo path, justifying a more aggressive cancellation.
        *   Use the spatial correlation matrix to dynamically adjust the weighting of filter coefficients associated with each loudspeaker.
        *   Introduce a “spatial smoothing” factor to prevent rapid coefficient changes and maintain stability.
    *   **Output:** Residual audio signal with reduced echo.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Echo Cancellation Module):**

```python
def adaptive_echo_cancellation(mic_signal, ref_signals, filter_coeffs, spatial_correlation, smoothing_factor):
    # Calculate estimated echo signals for each loudspeaker
    estimated_echo = []
    for i in range(len(ref_signals)):
        estimated_echo.append(convolve(ref_signals[i], filter_coeffs[i]))

    # Sum estimated echo signals
    total_estimated_echo = sum(estimated_echo)

    # Calculate residual signal
    residual_signal = mic_signal - total_estimated_echo

    # Update filter coefficients based on LMS or similar algorithm
    # ... (standard LMS update) ...

    # Adapt filter coefficients based on spatial correlation
    for i in range(len(ref_signals)):
        weight = spatial_correlation[i]
        filter_coeffs[i] = filter_coeffs[i] + weight * (new_filter_coeffs[i] - filter_coeffs[i]) * smoothing_factor

    return residual_signal, filter_coeffs
```

**Innovation:**

This system departs from simple signal strength-based cascade echo cancellation by incorporating learned spatial information and dynamically adjusting filter coefficients based on spatial correlation. This offers improved performance in complex acoustic environments, particularly when dealing with multiple loudspeakers, weak reference signals, or highly reverberant spaces. The NPU enables real-time processing of the computationally intensive RIR estimation and spatial filtering tasks.
