## Adaptive Chunk Prediction & Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple caching by predicting *future* data needs based on access patterns, and proactively prefetching not just chunks, but intelligently assembled data ‘scenes’ or ‘sequences’. This is geared toward streaming applications, video editing, and large dataset analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Scene Definition:** Allow user/administrator definition of ‘scenes’ – logical groupings of data chunks beyond simple file boundaries.  A scene is defined by a metadata tag applied to chunks.
*   **Access Pattern Analysis Engine:**  A background process that monitors data access (reads, writes, seeks) and builds a multi-dimensional access pattern map.  Dimensions include:
    *   Time-based access frequency (hourly, daily, weekly).
    *   Chunk adjacency – chunks frequently accessed together.
    *   Scene membership – scenes frequently accessed together.
    *   User/Application context - Access patterns vary by user or application.
*   **Predictive Prefetching Algorithm:**  Uses the access pattern map to predict future data needs. Algorithm considers:
    *   Markov Chain modeling of chunk access sequences.
    *   Scene-based prediction: If a scene is frequently accessed, prefetch all chunks belonging to that scene.
    *   Context-aware prediction: Adjust prefetching based on the current user or application.
*   **Tiered Prefetching:** Prefetch data to multiple storage tiers based on prediction confidence and access latency.
    *   High Confidence: Prefetch to fastest storage (e.g., NVMe SSD).
    *   Medium Confidence: Prefetch to local SSD.
    *   Low Confidence: Prefetch to remote storage (cloud object store).
*   **Dynamic Scene Definition:** Enable the access pattern analysis engine to *automatically* identify frequently co-accessed chunks and propose new scenes to the administrator.
*   **Prefetch Prioritization:** Assign priorities to prefetches based on:
    *   Application criticality.
    *   User importance.
    *   Data urgency (e.g., live streaming).
*   **Prefetch Cancellation:**  Implement a mechanism to cancel ongoing prefetches if the predicted data is no longer needed.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Prefetch Decision Logic):**

```
function decide_prefetch(chunk_id):
  access_pattern = get_access_pattern()
  prediction_score = access_pattern.predict_next_chunk(chunk_id)

  if prediction_score > threshold:
    prefetch_tier = determine_prefetch_tier(prediction_score)
    prefetch_chunk(chunk_id, prefetch_tier)

  scene_id = get_scene_id_for_chunk(chunk_id)
  if scene_id:
    scene_access_frequency = access_pattern.get_scene_frequency(scene_id)
    if scene_access_frequency > scene_threshold:
      prefetch_scene(scene_id)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Fast interconnect between storage tiers.
*   Sufficient local storage capacity for caching and prefetching.
*   Dedicated hardware acceleration for access pattern analysis and prediction (optional).
