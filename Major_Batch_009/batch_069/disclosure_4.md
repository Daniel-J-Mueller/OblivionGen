## Adaptive Replication Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of replication based on data access patterns and conflict rates. Current systems often replicate at a fixed level (e.g., entire records). This introduces overhead for frequently accessed, rarely changing data, and potential conflicts for highly contested data. This system proposes a mechanism to replicate only *parts* of data items, or to shift between different replication strategies (e.g., full replication, delta replication, version vector replication) *during* runtime.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Item Segmentation:**  Each data item is logically segmented into independent units (e.g., fields within a record, blocks within a larger object).  Metadata tracks the segmentation for each item type.

*   **Access Pattern Monitor:** A system component continuously monitors access patterns â€“ reads, writes, and the specific segments accessed.  This is implemented as a shadow table mapping segment IDs to access counts and last modified timestamps.

*   **Conflict Detection & Analysis:**  The system actively tracks write conflicts.  Beyond simple timestamp checks, it analyzes the *segments* involved in the conflict.  Frequent conflicts on specific segments trigger a review of replication strategy.

*   **Replication Strategy Selection:**  A policy engine evaluates access patterns, conflict rates, and system load. Based on this, it selects the optimal replication strategy *per segment*. Options include:
    *   **Full Replication:** Traditional full replication of the segment.
    *   **Delta Replication:**  Only changes (deltas) to the segment are replicated.  Requires versioning.
    *   **Version Vector Replication:** Utilizing version vectors to manage concurrent updates and potential conflicts.
    *   **Lazy Replication:** Replicating segments only on read requests.
    *   **No Replication:**  Segments are not replicated, relying on on-demand retrieval.

*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  The system dynamically adjusts the replication strategy *per segment* without downtime. This involves:
    1.  Switching the replication strategy for a segment.
    2.  Replicating or de-replicating the segment according to the new strategy.
    3.  Updating metadata with the new strategy.

*   **Metadata Store:** Stores the following for each data item:
    *   Segmentation details
    *   Current replication strategy per segment
    *   Access pattern statistics
    *   Conflict statistics

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine - Strategy Selection):**

```
function select_replication_strategy(segment_id, access_stats, conflict_stats, system_load):
  if conflict_stats.count > HIGH_CONFLICT_THRESHOLD:
    return VERSION_VECTOR_REPLICATION
  elif access_stats.read_count > HIGH_READ_THRESHOLD and access_stats.write_count < LOW_WRITE_THRESHOLD:
    if system_load > HIGH_LOAD_THRESHOLD:
      return LAZY_REPLICATION
    else:
      return FULL_REPLICATION
  elif access_stats.write_count > HIGH_WRITE_THRESHOLD:
    return DELTA_REPLICATION
  else:
    return FULL_REPLICATION
```
