## Adaptive Data Resonance & Predictive Anomaly Detection

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of parsing and transforming record data but introduces a resonance-based approach to data analysis and predictive anomaly detection. Instead of simply processing data streams to generate event data, the system aims to establish a 'resonant frequency' for different data types and proactively identify deviations that may indicate anomalies *before* they escalate into problems.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Resonance Engine:**  The central component. It dynamically calculates resonant frequencies for parsed data streams based on historical data and real-time inputs.  Think of it like tuning a radio – the engine finds the 'sweet spot' where the data signal is strongest and clearest, representing normal behavior.

2.  **Data Type Profiles:**  Each data type (e.g., access logs, transaction data, error reports) has an associated profile defining its expected frequency range, harmonic patterns, and acceptable deviation thresholds. These profiles are learned and refined through machine learning algorithms.

3.  **Harmonic Analyzer:**  This module analyzes the harmonic content of the data streams, identifying patterns and subtle variations that might indicate underlying issues. Harmonics are like overtones in music – they can reveal information not apparent in the fundamental frequency.

4.  **Predictive Drift Module:** Monitors the resonant frequency and harmonic patterns for deviations. It utilizes time series forecasting to predict future frequency drift. If the predicted drift exceeds a threshold, it triggers an alert.

5.  **Adaptive Feedback Loop:**  Continuously adjusts the Data Type Profiles and thresholds based on real-time data and feedback from the Predictive Drift Module. This ensures that the system remains accurate and responsive.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Drift Module:**

```
FUNCTION predict_drift(current_frequency, historical_frequencies, time_series_model):
  //Input:
  // current_frequency: The current resonant frequency of the data stream
  // historical_frequencies: A time series of past resonant frequencies
  // time_series_model: A trained time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)

  //Output: Drift Score (0-1, higher indicates greater drift)

  predicted_frequency = time_series_model.predict(historical_frequencies)

  frequency_difference = ABS(current_frequency - predicted_frequency)

  // Normalize the frequency difference based on the historical data range
  historical_range = MAX(historical_frequencies) - MIN(historical_frequencies)
  normalized_difference = frequency_difference / historical_range

  // Apply a weighting factor to emphasize recent deviations
  weighting_factor = 0.7  // Adjust as needed
  drift_score = weighting_factor * normalized_difference + (1 - weighting_factor) * historical_average_deviation

  RETURN drift_score
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Record data is ingested and parsed as in the original patent.
2.  Parsed data is fed into the Resonance Engine, which calculates the resonant frequency for each data type.
3.  The Harmonic Analyzer extracts harmonic patterns from the data.
4.  The Predictive Drift Module compares the current resonant frequency and harmonic patterns to historical data and predicted values.
5.  If a significant deviation is detected, an alert is generated, potentially triggering automated remediation actions.
6.  The Adaptive Feedback Loop continuously refines the Data Type Profiles and thresholds based on real-time data.

**Novelty:**

*   Moves beyond simple event data generation to proactively identify anomalies based on resonant frequency and harmonic analysis.
*   Introduces an adaptive learning loop that continuously refines the system's accuracy and responsiveness.
*   Provides a more nuanced and predictive approach to anomaly detection, potentially reducing false positives and improving overall system reliability.
*   Harmonic analysis adds another layer of insight into data patterns that might be missed by traditional methods.
