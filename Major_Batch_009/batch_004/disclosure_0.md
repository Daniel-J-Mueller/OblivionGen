## Adaptive Spectral Filtering Camera System

**System Overview:** A camera module utilizing a stacked sensor architecture with tunable spectral filters integrated directly onto the image sensor die. This allows for dynamic, per-pixel spectral analysis and image reconstruction, enhancing low-light performance and enabling advanced material analysis.

**Core Components:**

*   **Image Sensor Die:** A CMOS or CCD sensor with a modified pixel structure. Each pixel incorporates microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based tunable filters.
*   **Tunable Filter Array:** An array of micro-resonators or interferometers fabricated on top of each pixel. These filters can be individually controlled to transmit specific wavelengths of light. Actuation is achieved via electrostatic or magnetic fields.
*   **Control Circuitry:** Integrated control circuitry within the sensor die to manage the filter array. A digital interface allows external control of filter settings.
*   **Stacked Architecture:** The sensor die is bonded to a carrier wafer with via connections, similar to the provided patent, but the carrier wafer includes integrated control lines for the MEMS filters.
*   **Optics:** Standard lens module to focus incoming light onto the sensor.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Resolution:** 12MP – 100MP (scalable)
*   **Pixel Size:** 2µm – 5µm (dependent on resolution)
*   **Spectral Range:** 400nm – 1000nm (customizable)
*   **Spectral Resolution:** 10nm – 50nm (tunable)
*   **Filter Switching Speed:** 1ms – 10ms per pixel
*   **Power Consumption:** < 1W
*   **Interface:** MIPI CSI-2, USB 3.0

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
initialize_sensor()
set_spectral_range(400nm, 1000nm)
set_default_filter_settings()

// Image Capture Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Define Spectral Capture Profile
    //    Example: Capture data at 5nm intervals across the entire spectral range
    capture_profile = create_spectral_profile(start_wavelength, end_wavelength, interval)

    // 2. Sequentially Activate Filters & Capture Images
    for each wavelength in capture_profile {
        set_filter_wavelength(wavelength)
        capture_image()
        store_spectral_image(image, wavelength)
    }

    // 3. Image Reconstruction & Processing
    reconstruct_full_color_image(spectral_images)
    apply_image_processing_algorithms()

    // Output final image
    display_image()
}
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Per-Pixel Spectral Control:** Enables hyperspectral imaging with unprecedented detail and flexibility.
*   **Dynamic Spectral Filtering:** Allows real-time adjustment of the spectral response for optimal performance in varying lighting conditions.
*   **Integrated MEMS Filters:** Miniaturization and integration of the filters directly onto the sensor die.
*   **Material Analysis:** Capability to identify and analyze materials based on their spectral signatures.
