## Adaptive Resource Masking with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of removing browsing history to create a dynamic, user-controlled ‘mask’ over network resources, coupled with predictive pre-fetching based on interaction patterns. This isn't simply about history removal, but actively shaping the user's perceived browsing experience *and* optimizing performance.

**Specs:**

**I. Core Masking Engine:**

*   **Data Structure:**  `ResourceMaskEntry { URL: string, MaskLevel: integer (0-3), ExpirationTime: timestamp, AssociatedTags: array<string> }`
*   **Mask Levels:**
    *   0: No Masking (default). Resource is accessed and displayed normally.
    *   1: Data Scrub. Remove identifiable user data (cookies, local storage) before display.
    *   2: Content Skeleton. Load only the core structural elements of the page (HTML skeleton, CSS framework), delaying full content rendering.
    *   3: Placeholder. Display a generic placeholder page with a brief description or a user-defined image.
*   **Masking Rules:**  User-definable rules based on:
    *   URL patterns (wildcards, regex).
    *   Domain/subdomain.
    *   Content type (e.g., images, videos, scripts).
    *   Time of day/day of week.
    *   User tags (see II).

**II. User Tagging & Profiling:**

*   **Tagging System:** Allow users to assign tags to visited resources (e.g., "work", "personal", "sensitive", "news").
*   **Behavioral Profiling:**  System learns user interaction patterns (time spent on page, scroll depth, clicks, form submissions).
*   **Dynamic Masking:** Combine user tags, behavioral profiling, and masking rules to automatically apply appropriate mask levels.

**III. Predictive Pre-Fetch:**

*   **Pattern Recognition:** Analyze browsing history and interaction patterns to predict likely next resources.
*   **Tiered Pre-Fetch:**
    *   **Tier 1 (Aggressive):**  Pre-fetch resource skeleton (basic HTML/CSS) in the background.
    *   **Tier 2 (Moderate):** Pre-fetch full resource content (images, scripts) if prediction confidence is high.
    *   **Tier 3 (Conservative):** Do not pre-fetch.
*   **Pre-Fetch Prioritization:**  Prioritize pre-fetch based on:
    *   Prediction confidence.
    *   Resource size.
    *   Network conditions.

**IV. Pseudocode - Masking Engine Workflow:**

```
function process_resource_request(url):
  mask_entry = find_mask_entry(url)

  if mask_entry == null:
    return url // No masking applied

  mask_level = mask_entry.mask_level

  switch mask_level:
    case 1:
      url = scrub_data(url) // Remove cookies, local storage
    case 2:
      url = load_skeleton(url) // Load HTML/CSS only
    case 3:
      return placeholder_url // Return a predefined placeholder

  return url
```

**V. Integration with Browser UI:**

*   **Masking Control Panel:** Allow users to define masking rules and manage tags.
*   **Real-time Masking Indicator:** Display an icon in the browser address bar to indicate the current masking level for a resource.
*   **Adaptive Suggestions:** System suggests masking rules based on visited resources and user tags.

**VI. Security Considerations:**

*   **Sandboxing:** Isolate masked resources to prevent malicious code from accessing sensitive data.
*   **Encryption:** Encrypt masked data to protect it from unauthorized access.
*   **User Authentication:** Require user authentication to access masking control panel and manage masking rules.
