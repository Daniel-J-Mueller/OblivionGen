## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand upon the scene analysis to not just *identify* emotional tone, but to dynamically adjust the secondary content based on *user emotional state*. This creates a personalized viewing experience where virtual placements become more or less prominent, or even change entirely, based on biometric feedback.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Input:** Integrate with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers, dedicated sensors) to capture real-time biometric data: heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance (GSR), facial muscle activity (EMG), and potentially even EEG data.

2.  **Emotional State Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm that translates biometric data into a probabilistic emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, anxious, neutral). This would require a training dataset correlating biometric patterns with self-reported emotional states.

3.  **Placement Modulation Matrix:** Create a matrix mapping emotional states to adjustment parameters for virtual placements. Example parameters:
    *   *Visibility*: Adjust opacity or size of virtual objects.
    *   *Placement Priority*: Increase/decrease probability of a given virtual object appearing at a specific candidate placement.
    *   *Content Substitution*: Swap one virtual object for another based on emotional state (e.g., replace a high-energy product ad with a calming nature scene if the user is stressed).
    *    *Auditory Cue Integration:* When a placement is made, trigger corresponding audio cues that complement the user’s emotional state (e.g., upbeat jingle for happiness, calming ambient music for anxiety).

4.  **Real-time Adjustment Pipeline:**
    ```pseudocode
    loop:
        captureBiometricData()
        emotionalState = analyzeBiometricData()
        candidatePlacements = identifyCandidatePlacements(videoFrame)
        for each placement in candidatePlacements:
            adjustmentParameters = lookupAdjustmentParameters(emotionalState, placement)
            applyAdjustmentParameters(placement, adjustmentParameters)
        renderFrame()
    end loop
    ```

5.  **Personalized Training Mode:** Allow users to “train” the system by providing feedback on the appropriateness of virtual placements during different emotional states. This feedback refines the emotional state algorithm and the adjustment matrix.

6.  **Privacy Controls:** Implement robust privacy controls allowing users to opt-in/out of biometric data collection and personalize the level of emotional personalization. Data should be anonymized and securely stored.

7. **Contextual Awareness:** Combine user emotional state with broader contextual factors (time of day, location, content genre) for more nuanced adjustments. For example, a calming placement might be *less* appropriate during a high-action sports game.



**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced advertising effectiveness by aligning product placements with user mood.
*   Personalized content experiences that adapt to user emotional needs.
*   Therapeutic applications (e.g., using calming virtual placements to reduce anxiety).
*   Immersive gaming experiences that react to player emotional state.
