## Dynamic Scope Resolution & Predictive Caching

**Concept:** Expand on the scope-based caching by introducing dynamic scope resolution coupled with predictive caching based on coding patterns.  Instead of strictly matching cached segments, the system *predicts* potential scopes based on user input *before* full scope determination, pre-fetching and caching likely completion data. This addresses the latency inherent in strict scope matching, especially within complex, nested code structures.

**Specs:**

*   **Scope Tree Construction:** A background process constructs a 'Scope Tree' representing the current code file's hierarchical structure (functions, classes, loops, etc.).  Nodes in the tree represent scope boundaries. This tree is updated in near real-time as the user types.
*   **Predictive Scope Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Character stream from the editor.
    *   **Process:** As the user types, the Predictive Scope Engine analyzes the input *before* a complete scope is identified. It uses a statistical model (trained on large codebases) to estimate the *probability* of different scope resolutions. For example, upon typing ‘{’, the engine might predict a high probability of entering a function or loop.
    *   **Output:**  A ranked list of *potential* scopes, along with associated confidence scores.
*   **Prefetching & Caching:** Based on the ranked potential scopes, the system proactively requests completion data from the web service for those scopes.  This data is stored in a tiered cache:
    *   **Tier 1 (Fast):** In-memory cache for highly probable scopes.
    *   **Tier 2 (Medium):**  SSD-based cache for moderately probable scopes.
    *   **Tier 3 (Slow):**  Disk-based cache for less probable scopes.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns from user behavior:
    *   **Explicit Feedback:** User selections of completions provide positive signals.
    *   **Implicit Feedback:**  Ignoring suggested completions provides negative signals.
    *   The statistical model driving the Predictive Scope Engine is retrained regularly based on this feedback.
*   **Completion Prioritization:**  When presenting completions, the system prioritizes:
    *   Completions from the highest-confidence predicted scope.
    *   Completions that match the user's current input.
    *   Completions that have been frequently selected in the past.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Scope Engine):**

```
function predictScopes(inputString, currentScopeTree):
    // Train statistical model on large codebase
    model = loadPretrainedModel()

    // Generate features from inputString and currentScopeTree
    features = extractFeatures(inputString, currentScopeTree)

    // Predict probabilities for different scope resolutions
    probabilities = model.predict(features)

    // Rank scopes based on probabilities
    rankedScopes = sortScopesByProbability(probabilities)

    return rankedScopes
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Scope Tree Node:** {scopeType (e.g., "function", "loop"), startLine, endLine, children[]}
*   **Cache Entry:** {scopeTreeNodes[], completionData[]}
*   **Statistical Model:**  (e.g., a Bayesian Network or a Recurrent Neural Network) trained on code datasets.
