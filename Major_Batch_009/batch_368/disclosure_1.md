## Adaptive Notification 'Halo' System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple visual, aural, or tactile notifications by creating a localized environmental ‘halo’ around the user, subtly influencing their immediate surroundings to convey notification information. This moves beyond directly addressing the user and instead modulates their *environment* in a way they subconsciously perceive.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**  Utilize the existing sensor suite (cameras, inertial sensors, thermal sensors, microphones, etc.) *plus* add low-power, directional micro-fans (x4, positioned around device edges) and miniature, controllable thermoelectric modules (Peltier elements – x4, corresponding to fans).  Add a very low-power, wide-spectrum LED array capable of subtle color washes (ambient lighting control).
*   **Contextual Mapping:** The system analyzes user gaze, proximity, activity (motion data), ambient noise level, and even thermal signature to build a 'comfort map' of the immediate surroundings.  This map isn’t about *precision* location, but *relative* comfort/discomfort.
*   **Notification Modulation:**
    *   **Visual:**  Instead of screen flashes, the LED array subtly shifts ambient lighting color/intensity. Example: A cool blue wash for a calendar reminder, a warmer orange for a social media update.  The change is deliberately *subtle* – not jarring.
    *   **Thermal:** Peltier elements create localized temperature variations. A gentle cool breeze on the back of the neck for a high-priority notification, a slightly warmer patch on the arm for lower-priority.  Temperature delta should be minimal (0.5-1.0°C).
    *   **Airflow:**  Micro-fans generate directional airflow.  A light breeze against the ear for a phone call, a gentle puff on the hand for an incoming message. Airflow direction is dynamically adjusted based on user head/hand orientation.
*   **Priority & Customization:** Users can customize which sensory channels (visual, thermal, airflow) are used for different notification types. Priority levels modulate the intensity of the sensory effects.
*   **AI-Driven Adaptation:** An AI learns user preferences and adjusts the intensity/type of sensory modulation over time. This includes learning to suppress notifications when the user is focused on a task or in a sensitive environment.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// On Notification Received
function handleNotification(notification) {
  context = getContext();  // Gaze direction, proximity, activity, ambient conditions
  priority = notification.priority;

  // Determine sensory channels based on priority and user preferences
  channels = getPreferredChannels(priority);

  if (channels.includes("visual")) {
    setAmbientLighting(notification.type);
  }
  if (channels.includes("thermal")) {
    activatePeltierElements(notification.type);
  }
  if (channels.includes("airflow")) {
    directAirflow(notification.type, context.headOrientation);
  }

  // AI Learning - adjust intensity/channel selection based on user response
  learnFromResponse(userResponse);
}

function directAirflow(notificationType, headOrientation) {
    // Calculate appropriate fan speed and direction based on notificationType and headOrientation
    // Adjust airflow to create subtle but noticeable sensation
}
```

*   **Future Considerations:** Integration with smart fabrics capable of localized heating/cooling, or even subtle pressure changes, to further enhance the environmental modulation.  The system could even create ‘phantom’ sensations, such as a gentle touch on the shoulder, through carefully controlled airflow and temperature gradients.
