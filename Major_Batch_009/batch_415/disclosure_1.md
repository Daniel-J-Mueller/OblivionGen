## Dynamic Floor Plan Reconfiguration via Swarm Robotics & Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Augment the static floor plan generation with a system capable of *real-time* reconfiguration driven by a swarm of small, autonomous robots and a predictive model of inventory flow. This moves beyond a pre-defined layout to a responsive, optimized environment.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Robot Swarm:** A fleet of 50-200 miniature robots (approx. 15cm x 15cm x 10cm). Each robot equipped with:
    *   Lifting/Moving Mechanism: Capable of relocating small, standardized “floor tiles” (see below). Payload capacity of 5kg per robot.
    *   Proximity/Collision Avoidance Sensors: Short-range LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors.
    *   Wireless Communication: Mesh network connectivity for inter-robot coordination and central server communication.
    *   Onboard Battery: Minimum 8-hour operational life.
    *   Magnetic Feet: For secure temporary attachment to floor tiles.
*   **Modular Floor Tiles:** Standardized floor tiles (approx. 60cm x 60cm x 5cm).
    *   Magnetic Top Surface: To accept and secure items placed upon them.
    *   Integrated RFID Tag: For unique identification and location tracking.
    *   Low-Profile Connectors:  For optional power/data connections (charging stations, sensor integration).
    *   Lightweight Material: Aluminum honeycomb core with durable polymer skin.
*   **Central Control System:**  Server infrastructure managing the swarm, predictive model, and overall system.
    *   **Predictive Model:** Machine learning algorithm trained on historical inventory data (demand, storage patterns, travel routes).  Predicts future inventory bottlenecks and optimal floor plan configurations.
    *   **Task Allocation:** Algorithm assigning relocation tasks to robots based on predicted needs and robot availability.
    *   **Collision Avoidance & Path Planning:**  Real-time path planning for robots, considering static obstacles (walls, equipment) and dynamic obstacles (other robots, personnel).
    *   **Visualisation Interface:**  Real-time 3D visualization of the warehouse floor plan, robot positions, and predicted inventory flow.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (executed continuously by Central Control System)

1.  Receive Inventory Data (demand, storage levels, order information)
2.  Run Predictive Model to Forecast Future Inventory Bottlenecks
3.  Generate Optimal Floor Plan Configuration (tile layout) based on forecast
4.  Compare Current Floor Plan with Optimal Floor Plan
5.  Identify Tiles Requiring Relocation
6.  Generate Relocation Tasks (tile ID, source location, destination location)
7.  Assign Tasks to Available Robots
8.  Monitor Robot Progress & Adjust Paths as Needed (collision avoidance)
9.  Update Floor Plan Visualization
10. Repeat from Step 1

// Robot Pseudocode (executed by each robot)

1.  Receive Task from Central Control System (tile ID, destination)
2.  Navigate to Source Location of Tile
3.  Securely Attach to Tile using Magnetic Feet
4.  Lift Tile (verify secure grasp)
5.  Navigate to Destination Location
6.  Lower Tile and Detach (verify stable placement)
7.  Report Task Completion to Central Control System
8.  Await New Task
```

**Innovation:**  This system moves beyond a static, pre-defined floor plan to an actively *learning* and *adapting* environment. The swarm robotics element enables rapid reconfiguration without human intervention, while the predictive model anticipates needs before they arise, minimizing bottlenecks and maximizing warehouse efficiency. It is a fully dynamic layout system.
