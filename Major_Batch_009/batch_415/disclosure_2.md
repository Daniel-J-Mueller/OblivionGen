## Adaptive Network ‘Ecosystem’ Mapping & Prediction

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *finding* and *testing* networks to proactively map a network ‘ecosystem’ around a device, predicting availability and performance *before* the user attempts connection. This moves from reactive connection to predictive, seamless handoff.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Passive Scanning:** Continuous, low-power scanning for all available wireless signals (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular, potentially even emerging standards). Record signal strength, channel, encryption type, and advertised SSID/network name.
*   **Active Probing (Controlled):** Periodic, short-duration active probes to elicit responses from networks, even those not actively broadcasting SSIDs.  Rate limit probing to minimize interference and battery drain.
*   **Crowdsourced Data Integration:** Anonymized network data (signal strength, latency, reliability) from other devices in the vicinity. Prioritize data from devices with similar usage patterns (e.g., e-readers, tablets). Data sourced via a secure, encrypted channel.
*   **Location Context:** Integrate location data (GPS, Wi-Fi positioning, cellular triangulation) to correlate network availability with physical location.

**2. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Historical Data Storage:** Store a historical record of network availability and performance data for each location. Data points include signal strength, latency, reliability, and user connection history.
*   **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Employ a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) to predict network availability and performance based on historical data, current signal conditions, and location context.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Adjust the weighting of different data sources (historical data, current signal conditions, crowdsourced data) based on their reliability and relevance.  For example, prioritize historical data in areas with consistent network coverage, and crowdsourced data in areas with unpredictable coverage.
*   **Network 'Personality' Profiles:** Develop ‘personality’ profiles for each network, capturing its typical behavior (e.g., consistent signal strength, predictable outages, captive portal requirements).

**3. Adaptive Handover Mechanism:**

*   **Pre-Connection Testing:** Before the user attempts to connect, proactively test the predicted best network based on pre-connection tests.
*   **Seamless Handoff:** If the predicted network is unavailable or performs poorly, seamlessly handoff to the next best predicted network *before* the user experiences a dropped connection.
*   **Connection Priority Queue:** Maintain a priority queue of potential networks, sorted by predicted performance and reliability.
*    **User Preference Overrides:** Allow users to prioritize specific networks or disable automatic handover.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Core Module:** Runs on the device, responsible for data acquisition, predictive modeling, and adaptive handover.
*   **Cloud Component (Optional):**  Facilitates crowdsourced data integration, model updates, and anomaly detection. Anonymized data is sent to the cloud for analysis and model refinement.
*   **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
*   **API:** Open API for integration with other applications and services.



**Pseudocode (Adaptive Handover):**

```
function attemptConnection(targetNetwork) {
    if (isNetworkAvailable(targetNetwork)) {
        connectToNetwork(targetNetwork)
        return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}

function selectBestNetwork(location, userPreferences) {
    predictedNetworks = predictNetworkAvailability(location)
    filteredNetworks = filterNetworks(predictedNetworks, userPreferences)
    bestNetwork = selectNetworkWithHighestScore(filteredNetworks)
    return bestNetwork
}

function predictNetworkAvailability(location) {
    historicalData = getHistoricalData(location)
    currentSignalData = getCurrentSignalData(location)
    crowdsourcedData = getCrowdsourcedData(location)
    // Apply ML model to predict network availability and performance
    predictedNetworks = applyMLModel(historicalData, currentSignalData, crowdsourcedData)
    return predictedNetworks
}
```
