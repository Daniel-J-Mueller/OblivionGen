## Modular, Self-Adjusting Contact System for Variable Thickness Components

**Concept:** A system leveraging the leaf spring connector principle, but expanded to accommodate components with significantly variable thicknesses, and with integrated force feedback for reliable contact. This moves beyond simply connecting a battery to a PCB.

**Specs:**

*   **Base Plate:** A rigid PCB or FR4 layer serving as the mounting surface. Multiple standardized ‘docking stations’ are etched into the base plate, each corresponding to a possible component mounting location. These docking stations are simple through-holes with widened sections for limited lateral movement.
*   **Leaf Spring Array:** Each docking station contains a small array (3-5) of individually spring-loaded leaf spring connectors. These are *not* monolithic; each spring is a separate piece of formed metal.
*   **Micro-Actuator Integration:** Each leaf spring connector is coupled to a miniature piezoelectric actuator (or similar micro-actuator). This actuator allows for fine adjustment of the spring’s compression and vertical positioning.
*   **Force Sensors:** Integrated force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) or capacitive force sensors are placed *under* each leaf spring connector, providing real-time feedback on the contact force.
*   **Control System:** A small microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 or similar) is integrated into the base plate. It processes the force sensor data and controls the micro-actuators, maintaining optimal contact force regardless of component thickness variation.
*   **Electrical Routing:** The base plate includes flexible conductive traces to route signals and power from the leaf spring connectors to the rest of the device. These traces can be manufactured as part of the base PCB.
*   **Modular Connector Heads:** The connectors themselves are modular. Different head shapes can be snapped onto the leaf spring mechanisms to accommodate various component types and contact points.
*   **Software/Firmware:** A simple API allows for configuration of contact force targets and sensor thresholds for each connector. It also includes a self-calibration routine to compensate for manufacturing tolerances.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  Component is placed into the docking station.
2.  Control system reads initial force sensor values.
3.  Micro-actuators adjust the compression of the leaf spring connectors until the desired contact force is achieved.
4.  Control system continuously monitors force sensor data and adjusts the actuators to maintain consistent contact force despite temperature fluctuations, component settling, or minor vibrations.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Robotics:** Reliable, adaptable connections to sensors and actuators on robotic limbs.
*   **Wearable Electronics:** Consistent contact with skin sensors despite movement and varying skin thickness.
*   **Flexible Electronics:** Adaptable connections to components mounted on flexible substrates.
*   **Battery connections in devices needing frequent battery swaps.**
*   **High-reliability connections in harsh environments.**

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Define parameters
float targetForce = 1.0;  // Newtons
float kp = 0.5; //Proportional Gain

// Main Loop
while (true) {

  // Read force sensor data for each connector
  float currentForce = readForceSensor(connectorID);

  // Calculate error
  float error = targetForce - currentForce;

  // Calculate actuator adjustment
  float adjustment = kp * error;

  // Adjust actuator position
  setActuatorPosition(connectorID, adjustment);

  // Delay
  delay(10ms);
}
```
