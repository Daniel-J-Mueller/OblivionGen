## Multi-Spectral Panoramic Array

**Concept:** Expand the wide-angle imaging concept by incorporating multiple spectral bands beyond visible light, creating a panoramic image with associated data layers for environmental analysis, material identification, or augmented reality applications.

**Specs:**

*   **Camera Array:**
    *   Minimum 9 cameras, arranged in a geodesic dome configuration (icosahedron preferred) to maximize coverage and minimize blind spots.
    *   Each camera *must* include a narrow-band spectral filter. Suggested filters: visible light (RGB), near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and potentially ultraviolet (UV).
    *   Each camera has a fixed focal length, optimized for a specific field of view contribution to the overall panorama.
    *   Rolling shutter *required* for each camera.
    *   Global shutter *prohibited*.
*   **Housing:**
    *   Robust, weatherproof enclosure constructed from a lightweight composite material.
    *   Internal thermal management system to regulate camera temperature and minimize spectral drift.
    *   Integrated IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for precise orientation and stabilization.
*   **Processing Unit:**
    *   High-performance embedded processor (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) capable of real-time image processing and data fusion.
    *   Dedicated hardware accelerator for spectral calibration and image stitching.
    *   Minimum 128GB of onboard storage for image data and processing results.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Calibration Module:** Automatically calibrates each cameraâ€™s spectral response and geometric distortion.  Uses a known spectral target for absolute calibration.
    *   **Stitching Algorithm:**
        1.  Capture frames from all cameras simultaneously (synchronized by hardware trigger).
        2.  Apply distortion correction to each image.
        3.  Feature detection and matching across overlapping camera views. Use SIFT or similar robust feature descriptor.
        4.  Perform homography estimation to align images.
        5.  Blend images using multi-band blending with consideration for spectral differences. This *must* occur in a high-dynamic-range format, and only *then* be normalized to 8-bit formats.
        6.  Generate a seamless panoramic image with associated spectral data layers.
        7.  Output to a layered TIFF or similar format for external processing.
    *   **Data Fusion Module:**  Integrates spectral data layers to create information products, such as vegetation indices, material maps, or augmented reality overlays.
*   **Power:**
    *   External power supply (12V DC) with sufficient current capacity to support all components.
    *   Optional battery pack for portable operation.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Algorithm):**

```
// Input:  Raw images from all cameras (imageArray[])
// Output: Seamless panoramic image (panoramicImage)

function stitchPanoramicImage(imageArray[]) {

  for each image in imageArray {
    correctDistortion(image) // Apply camera calibration parameters
  }

  keypoints = detectKeypoints(imageArray[0]) // Extract features from first image

  for each image in imageArray {
      matchedKeypoints = matchKeypoints(keypoints, image)
      homography = estimateHomography(matchedKeypoints)
      warpedImage = warpImage(image, homography)
      blendImage(panoramicImage, warpedImage)
  }
  
  output panoramicImage
}
