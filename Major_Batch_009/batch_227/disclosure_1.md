## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** Dynamically layering and blending multiple, synthesized audio scenes based on real-time analysis of the input audio and environmental context, creating a highly personalized and immersive auditory experience. This moves beyond simple volume/EQ adjustments *of* existing audio, to *generating* supplemental audio tailored to the user's immediate sonic environment.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multi-channel microphone array (minimum 4 capsules) for accurate spatial audio capture.
*   High-fidelity headphones or multi-speaker surround sound system.
*   Dedicated audio processing unit (DSP or equivalent) with sufficient processing power for real-time analysis and synthesis.
*   Optional: Environmental sensors (light, temperature, humidity) to further refine scene selection.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Real-time audio from microphone array.
    *   Processing:
        *   Sound event detection (SED): Identify and classify dominant sounds (speech, music, traffic, nature sounds, etc.).  Utilize a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of environmental sounds.
        *   Spatial audio source localization: Determine the direction and distance of sound sources.
        *   Reverberation and echo detection: Analyze the acoustic characteristics of the environment.
    *   Output:  Acoustic scene descriptor (ASD) â€“ a vector representing the dominant sounds, their spatial locations, and the acoustic characteristics of the environment.

*   **Scene Database:**
    *   A curated library of synthesized audio scenes. Each scene consists of multiple audio layers (ambience, sound effects, music) and associated metadata (ASD compatibility profile, emotional tone, intensity).
    *   Scenes are categorized based on perceived emotional impact and suitability for various activities (work, relaxation, exercise).
    *   Dynamic creation/modification of scenes via procedural audio synthesis.

*   **Scene Composer:**
    *   Input: ASD, user preferences (emotional tone, activity type, intensity).
    *   Processing:
        *   Scene Selection: Choose a base scene from the database based on ASD and user preferences.
        *   Layer Blending: Dynamically adjust the volume and pan of each audio layer within the chosen scene to create a seamless auditory experience.
        *   Spatialization: Position audio layers in 3D space to create a realistic and immersive soundscape.
        *   Adaptive Synthesis: Generate supplemental audio elements (e.g., subtle ambient sounds, musical motifs) to fill gaps in the existing soundscape or enhance specific emotions. Procedural synthesis will be used to avoid static loops.
        *   Conflict Resolution: Identify and mitigate auditory conflicts between the real-world soundscape and the synthesized audio. This might involve dynamically attenuating specific layers or introducing masking effects.
    *   Output: Final mixed audio stream.

*   **User Interface:**
    *   Allows users to:
        *   Select preferred emotional tones and activity types.
        *   Adjust the intensity of the synthesized audio.
        *   Provide feedback on the quality of the experience.
        *   Create custom scene templates.

**III. Pseudocode (Scene Composer - Core Logic):**

```
function composeScene(ASD, userPreferences):
  baseScene = selectBaseScene(ASD, userPreferences)
  layers = baseScene.layers

  for each layer in layers:
    layer.volume = calculateLayerVolume(layer, ASD)
    layer.pan = calculateLayerPan(layer, ASD)

  supplementalLayers = generateSupplementalLayers(ASD, userPreferences)
  layers.extend(supplementalLayers)

  attenuateConflictingSounds(ASD, layers) // Reduce overlap with real-world audio

  mixedAudio = mixLayers(layers)
  return mixedAudio

function generateSupplementalLayers(ASD, userPreferences):
  // Procedurally generate sounds based on ASD and preferences
  // Examples:  Rain if the ASD indicates a lack of ambience,
  // upbeat music if user is exercising.
  // Parameters:  Intensity, genre, emotional tone
  layers = []
  if (ASD.ambienceLevel < threshold):
      layers.append(generateRainSound(userPreferences.intensity))
  // ... other conditional layer generation
  return layers
```

**IV. Key Innovations:**

*   **Dynamic Scene Generation:**  Not merely mixing existing soundscapes, but procedurally constructing new ones in real-time.
*   **Acoustic Context Awareness:** Deeply integrating the analysis of the surrounding environment into the audio processing pipeline.
*   **Emotionally Intelligent Audio:**  Tailoring the synthesized audio to elicit specific emotions or enhance the user's current mood.
*   **Conflict Resolution Algorithms:**  Minimizing auditory clashes between the real world and the synthesized environment for a more seamless and immersive experience.
