## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping with Distributed Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Leverage the motion and beamforming data principles from the provided patent to create a real-time, adaptive acoustic map of a space, not just for inter-device communication, but for environmental awareness and localized audio projection. This expands beyond device-to-device bearing estimation into broader spatial understanding.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Each device (mobile phone, dedicated sensor node, etc.) will contain:
    *   IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) - for precise motion tracking.
    *   Microphone Array (minimum 4 elements) - for beamforming and acoustic event localization.
    *   Ultra-Wideband (UWB) or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) direction finding capable radio.
*   **Data Processing:**
    1.  **Motion Data Acquisition:** IMU data is streamed continuously, processed with a Kalman filter to estimate device pose (position and orientation) in a common coordinate frame.
    2.  **Beamforming Data Acquisition:** Microphone array captures ambient audio. Beamforming algorithms (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, MVDR) are applied to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of sound sources.
    3.  **Sensor Fusion:**  Motion data (pose) and beamforming data (DOA) are fused using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Particle Filter. The filter estimates the location of acoustic sources *and* refines the deviceâ€™s pose within the environment. This compensates for IMU drift and noisy beamforming estimates.
    4.  **Map Building:**  A 3D occupancy grid map is constructed. The probability of occupancy in each cell is determined by the number of times a device (or multiple devices) has detected an acoustic source within that cell.  Higher probability means higher likelihood of a static object.
    5.  **Dynamic Source Tracking**:  Utilize an algorithm that can separate dynamic sources and persistent reflections. Persistent sources can indicate static objects.

*   **Communication:** Devices communicate location and acoustic data to a central server (or mesh network) via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Communication frequency is adjusted based on motion and acoustic event density.
*   **Localized Audio Projection:** Leveraging the acoustic map, the system can project audio beams towards specific locations in the space, creating immersive and localized audio experiences. This could be used for directional notifications, augmented reality audio, or private conversations.
*   **Localization Model:** Use a Probabilistic Localization model. The model should leverage data from all available devices, and track location in three dimensions. This system should also handle edge cases where devices lose connectivity.

**Pseudocode - Map Update:**

```
function UpdateMap(device_id, pose, doa, acoustic_data):
  # pose: [x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw]
  # doa: Direction of Arrival (azimuth, elevation)
  # acoustic_data: audio sample, intensity

  # 1. Transform DOA from device coordinates to world coordinates
  world_doa = TransformCoordinates(doa, pose)

  # 2. Calculate the intersection point of the DOA ray with a virtual plane
  intersection_point = CalculateIntersection(world_doa, virtual_plane)

  # 3. Update the occupancy grid map at the intersection point
  occupancy_grid[intersection_point] += 1

  # 4. Apply smoothing filter to the occupancy grid (e.g., Gaussian blur)
  SmoothOccupancyGrid(occupancy_grid)

  return occupancy_grid
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart Homes/Offices: Adaptive acoustics, intelligent lighting control based on occupancy, privacy zones.
*   Augmented/Virtual Reality: Immersive audio experiences, spatially accurate soundscapes.
*   Robotics/Autonomous Navigation:  Enhanced environmental awareness, obstacle avoidance.
*   Security/Surveillance:  Acoustic event detection and localization.
