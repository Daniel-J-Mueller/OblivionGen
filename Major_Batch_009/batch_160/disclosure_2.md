## Acoustic Holography Mapping System

**Concept:** Expand the directional testing system into a real-time acoustic hologram generation and manipulation platform. Instead of *testing* directionality, the system will *create* and shape acoustic fields, effectively allowing for ‘acoustic beamforming’ beyond what the device being tested is capable of.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core System:** Retain the horizontal/vertical linear actuator base from the patent, plus rotary actuator.
*   **Array Expansion:** Replace the single sound source with a phased array of miniature ultrasonic transducers (e.g., 64x64 array). Each transducer is individually addressable via the controller.  Transducers should operate in the 20Hz-20kHz range.
*   **Microphone Array:** Surround the tested audio device with a dense array of MEMS microphones (e.g., 32x32 array).  Microphones are individually addressable and synchronized with the transducer control.
*   **Controller Integration:** The controller is upgraded to manage the large transducer and microphone arrays, including phase and amplitude control for each element.  Must include a high-speed data acquisition system.
*   **Real-time Processing:** Implement a real-time digital signal processing (DSP) engine within the controller. The DSP engine will perform:
    *   Wavefront reconstruction algorithms (Huygens-Fresnel principle, Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction theory) to generate desired acoustic fields.
    *   Beamforming algorithms (delay-and-sum, minimum variance distortionless response) for focusing and steering acoustic beams.
    *   Acoustic scene reconstruction from microphone array data (using techniques like Time-Difference-of-Arrival estimation and beam steering).
*   **Holographic Projection:** Implement a system to dynamically create an ‘acoustic hologram’ – a three-dimensional representation of the acoustic field. This involves calculating the required phase and amplitude of each transducer in the array to generate the desired sound pressure distribution in space.  The controller will implement iterative algorithms (e.g., Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm) to optimize the transducer array configuration for the target acoustic field.
*   **Manipulator Arm:** Integrate a small robotic arm to position physical objects within the generated acoustic field. This allows for testing how acoustic manipulation affects objects (e.g., levitation, particle sorting).
*   **Software Interface:** Develop a user-friendly GUI to:
    *   Define target acoustic fields (e.g., focused beam, plane wave, complex shapes).
    *   Control transducer array parameters (amplitude, phase, frequency).
    *   Visualize the generated acoustic field (using ray tracing or finite element analysis).
    *   Monitor microphone array data.
    *   Control the manipulator arm.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Acoustic Field Generation):**

```
// Define target acoustic field parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude, focal point)
frequency = 1000 Hz
amplitude = 1.0
focal_point = (x, y, z)

// Calculate phase and amplitude for each transducer element
for each transducer element (i, j) in array:
  distance = calculate_distance(transducer_element(i, j), focal_point)
  phase = 2 * PI * frequency * distance / speed_of_sound
  amplitude_element = calculate_amplitude(i, j, focal_point) // account for element position
  set_transducer_parameters(i, j, amplitude_element, phase)

// Activate transducers
activate_transducers()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Advanced audio device testing (directional response, beamforming capability)
*   Non-destructive testing (acoustic imaging, defect detection)
*   Acoustic manipulation (particle levitation, object sorting)
*   Haptic feedback systems (creation of localized tactile sensations)
*   Virtual reality and augmented reality (realistic sound rendering)
