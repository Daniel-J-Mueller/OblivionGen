## Dynamic Contextual Voice Actions

**Concept:** Extend voice control beyond simple application enabling/disabling by allowing users to define *contextual* voice actions that dynamically adjust behavior based on external data or device state. This moves beyond simply *if* an app responds, to *how* it responds, driven by real-time information.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Action Definition Module:**

*   **Input:** User-defined trigger phrase, target application/function, contextual data source (e.g., weather API, calendar, device location, connected home sensors, stock prices, social media feeds), conditional logic.
*   **Process:**  The module parses the user input, validating data sources and conditional logic syntax. It stores the defined action as a rule set associated with the user account.
*   **Output:**  A compiled rule set for the action, referencing the target application and the external data source.

**2. Real-Time Data Integration:**

*   **Process:**  A background service continually polls (or utilizes a push mechanism) the specified external data source. This data is cached locally for rapid access.
*   **Data Types:** Support for numerical, textual, boolean, and date/time data.
*   **API Abstraction:**  A standardized API allows easy integration of new data sources without modifying core components.

**3. Voice Processing & Rule Evaluation:**

*   **Process:** When a voice command is received, the standard speech processing component transcribes the audio.  *Before* invoking the target application, the system checks if any defined contextual actions match the command.
*   **Matching Logic:** The system compares the transcribed command against defined trigger phrases (fuzzy matching to account for variations).
*   **Rule Evaluation:** If a match is found, the system evaluates the associated conditional logic using the current real-time data.  

    *   Example: `IF weather = "rain" THEN application = "navigation" action = "display alternate route"`
    *   Example: `IF calendar event contains "meeting" THEN application = "do not disturb" action = "enable"`

**4. Dynamic Application Configuration:**

*   **Process:** Based on the rule evaluation, the system dynamically configures the target application *before* invocation. This could involve:
    *   Modifying application parameters (e.g., volume, display settings).
    *   Selecting different application modes or functionalities.
    *   Pre-populating application fields with data.
    *   Triggering specific application actions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processVoiceCommand(audioData):
  transcription = speechToText(audioData)

  for action in userDefinedActions:
    if fuzzyMatch(transcription, action.triggerPhrase):
      realtimeData = getRealtimeData(action.dataSource)
      conditionMet = evaluateCondition(action.condition, realtimeData)
      if conditionMet:
        configureApplication(action.targetApplication, action.configuration)
        invokeApplication(action.targetApplication)
        return // Command processed

  // No matching contextual action found, attempt default application invocation
  invokeApplication(transcription)
```

**Example User Flow:**

1.  User says: "Hey system, play music."
2.  System checks for contextual actions matching "play music."
3.  A rule exists: `IF timeOfDay = "morning" THEN application = "music" playlist = "upbeat"`
4.  System determines it is morning.
5.  System configures the music application to play the "upbeat" playlist.
6.  System invokes the music application.

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a consistent internet connection for real-time data access.
*   Local caching of data is crucial for performance and resilience.
*   Sufficient processing power to evaluate conditional logic in real-time.
