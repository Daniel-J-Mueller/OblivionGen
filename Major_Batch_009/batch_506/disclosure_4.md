## Dynamic Data Sharding with Predictive Access

**Concept:** Enhance the streaming restore and query servicing by dynamically sharding data *within* the key-value store based on predicted access patterns. This anticipates query needs *before* full restore completion and proactively places frequently accessed data closer to compute nodes, further minimizing latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Access Modeling Module:**

   *   **Input:** Query logs, data access patterns (from counters in the existing patent’s data structure – claim 14), schema information, data cardinality estimates.
   *   **Process:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future data access frequency for each data block.  Model should account for diurnal/weekly/seasonal variations in query workload. Regularly retrain the model with updated access logs.
   *   **Output:**  Access prediction scores for each data block, ranked by predicted frequency.

**2. Dynamic Sharding Engine:**

   *   **Input:**  Access prediction scores, data block unique identifiers, key-value storage system API.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Divide the key-value store into multiple ‘shards’ (logical partitions).
        *   Assign data blocks to shards based on predicted access frequency. Highest frequency blocks are placed in shards geographically/network-wise closest to the compute nodes.  Lowest frequency blocks are placed in shards with lower priority (e.g., slower storage tiers).
        *   Maintain a shard mapping table:  `{data_block_id: shard_id}`.  This table is updated dynamically based on changing access predictions.
        *   Implement a shard balancing algorithm: Periodically redistribute data blocks between shards to optimize access latency and storage utilization.
   *   **Output:** Updated shard mapping table, shard redistribution schedule.

**3. Query Interceptor & Redirection:**

   *   **Input:** Incoming query, shard mapping table.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Before accessing the key-value store, intercept the query.
        *   Determine the shards containing the relevant data blocks using the shard mapping table.
        *   Redirect the query to the appropriate shards.  This minimizes network hops and access latency.
   *   **Output:**  Query redirected to the relevant shard(s).

**4. Restore Optimization:**

   *   **Input:**  Shard mapping table, ongoing restore process.
   *   **Process:**  Prioritize the restore of data blocks assigned to shards closest to compute nodes. This allows the system to begin servicing queries with the lowest latency as quickly as possible, even before the entire dataset is restored.
   *   **Output:**  Modified restore schedule, prioritizing high-frequency data block restoration.

**Pseudocode (Query Interceptor):**

```
function interceptQuery(query):
  shardMapping = getShardMappingTable()
  dataBlocks = extractDataBlocksFromQuery(query)  // Identify data blocks needed by the query

  shardList = []
  for block in dataBlocks:
    shardId = shardMapping[block]
    shardList.append(shardId)

  uniqueShards = removeDuplicates(shardList)

  redirectQuery(query, uniqueShards) // Send query to the identified shards
  return
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ShardMappingTable`:  `{data_block_id: shard_id}` – Dictionary mapping data block IDs to shard IDs.
*   `ShardMetadata`: `{shard_id: location, capacity, utilization}` – Metadata about each shard (location, capacity, current utilization).
*   `AccessPrediction`: `{data_block_id: predicted_access_frequency}` – Predicted access frequency for each data block.



This dynamic sharding approach goes beyond simple streaming restore by proactively optimizing data placement based on predicted access patterns, leading to significantly improved query performance and reduced latency, particularly during and after a restore operation.
