## Adaptive Environmental Response System

**Core Concept:** Expand the USB dongle's functionality beyond doorbell notification to a localized environmental control hub, triggered by doorbell events or user input, leveraging the USB power source and wireless connectivity.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing USB Dongle base – retaining LED, speaker, microphone, processor, non-volatile memory, wireless communication.
    *   Integrated Environmental Sensors: Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality (CO2, VOCs).
    *   Relay Control Module: Capable of switching low-voltage devices (lights, small fans, scent diffusers).
    *   Small form-factor heatsink for relay module.
*   **Software:**
    *   Core Functionality: Retains all existing doorbell communication features.
    *   Environmental Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Data logged locally and optionally transmitted to a cloud service.
    *   Rule Engine:  User-definable rules based on doorbell events and/or sensor readings.  Example rules:
        *   “When doorbell rings, turn on porch light.”
        *   “If air quality drops below threshold, activate air purifier.”
        *   “If temperature exceeds threshold, activate small USB-powered fan.”
        *   “When doorbell rings, diffuse a pre-selected scent.”
    *   USB Power Management: Optimizes power draw from USB port to accommodate sensors and relays.  Ability to switch to battery backup (optional).
    *   API: Open API for integration with other smart home platforms (IFTTT, Home Assistant).
*   **Pseudocode (Rule Engine):**

```
// Define rule structure
struct Rule {
    TriggerType trigger; // Doorbell, Sensor reading, Time of Day
    TriggerCondition condition; // Equals, Greater Than, Less Than, etc.
    TriggerValue value; // Threshold or specific value
    ActionType action; // Turn on/off device, send notification, play sound
    ActionValue value; // Device ID, Notification message, Sound file
};

// Process Events
function processEvent(event) {
    for each rule in rulesList {
        if (rule.trigger == event.triggerType) {
            if (conditionMet(rule.condition, event.value, rule.value)) {
                executeAction(rule.action, rule.value);
            }
        }
    }
}

//Example Usage:
//Doorbell rings
event = {triggerType:"Doorbell", value: "Ring"};
processEvent(event);

//Temperature exceeds threshold
event = {triggerType:"Sensor", value: 28, sensorType:"Temperature"};
processEvent(event);
```

**Refinement:**

*   The system could integrate with a USB-powered scent diffuser to release a welcoming scent upon doorbell activation.
*   A visual display (small OLED) could show sensor readings and rule status.
*   A learning algorithm could predict optimal environmental settings based on user preferences and external factors (weather).
*   Multiple units could be deployed to create a distributed sensor network throughout the home.
*   Open source the platform to encourage community-driven development of new rules and integrations.
