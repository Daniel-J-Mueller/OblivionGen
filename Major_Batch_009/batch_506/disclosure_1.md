## Dynamic Task Composition via Probabilistic Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand execution framework to support dynamic composition of tasks *during* runtime, driven by probabilistic models predicting optimal task sequences based on observed system state and user behavior. This goes beyond pre-defined APIs – the *API itself evolves*.

**Specifications:**

1.  **State Capture Module:**
    *   Collects real-time system state: CPU load, memory usage, network latency, I/O rates, running processes, user interaction data (mouse movements, keystrokes, app usage).
    *   Data is formatted into a feature vector.
    *   Feature engineering will involve time-series analysis and anomaly detection.

2.  **Probabilistic Task Graph (PTG):**
    *   Represents all available tasks as nodes.
    *   Edges represent the probability of transitioning from one task to another *given the current system state*.
    *   Initial probabilities are seeded based on developer knowledge/training data.
    *   The PTG is continuously updated through reinforcement learning (see section 4).

3.  **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Current system state (feature vector).
    *   Process: Uses the PTG to predict the most likely sequence of tasks to execute *next*. This uses a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm adapted for probabilistic graphs.
    *   Output: Ranked list of task sequences with associated confidence scores.

4.  **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**
    *   Environment: The on-demand code execution environment.
    *   State: System state (feature vector) + current task sequence.
    *   Action: Selecting the next task to execute.
    *   Reward: Based on metrics like task completion time, resource utilization, user satisfaction (measured via implicit feedback – e.g., time spent on a particular result), and error rate.
    *   Algorithm: Utilize a Deep Q-Network (DQN) or similar reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for task selection.

5.  **Alias Manager Enhancement:**
    *   The existing alias system is extended to support *dynamic aliases*. These aliases point to the *current* predicted task sequence, not a static API.
    *   When a user requests an API call, the Alias Manager resolves the alias to the dynamically generated task sequence.

6.  **Resource Allocation Policy:**
    *   The resource allocation system prioritizes resources based on the predicted task sequence. Tasks predicted to be critical for the overall goal receive higher priority.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_next_tasks(current_state, probabilistic_task_graph):
  # Initialize distances and previous nodes
  distances = {node: infinity for node in probabilistic_task_graph.nodes()}
  previous_nodes = {node: null for node in probabilistic_task_graph.nodes()}
  distances[start_node] = 0

  # Priority queue for nodes to explore
  priority_queue = [(0, start_node)]

  while priority_queue:
    current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

    if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
      continue

    for neighbor, probability in probabilistic_task_graph.neighbors(current_node).items():
      distance = current_distance + (-log(probability))  # Use negative log probability as distance
      if distance < distances[neighbor]:
        distances[neighbor] = distance
        previous_nodes[neighbor] = current_node
        heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

  # Reconstruct path from destination to source
  path = []
  current_node = destination_node
  while current_node is not None:
    path.insert(0, current_node)
    current_node = previous_nodes[current_node]

  return path, distances[destination_node]
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Adaptive User Interfaces:** Dynamically generate UI elements and functionality based on user behavior and system state.
*   **Intelligent Automation:** Create automation workflows that adapt to changing conditions and user needs.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Proactively identify and address potential system issues before they impact users.
*   **Personalized Content Delivery:** Dynamically assemble content based on user preferences and context.
