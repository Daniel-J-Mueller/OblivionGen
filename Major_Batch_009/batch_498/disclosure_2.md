## Dynamic Contextual Summarization via Predictive Gaze

**Concept:** Extend video summarization beyond object tracking and priority metrics to *predict* where a viewer will likely look, then prioritize those areas for summarization and dynamic clip generation. This moves beyond reactive summarization to proactive, predictive highlighting.

**Specs:**

1.  **Gaze Prediction Model:**
    *   Train a deep learning model (Recurrent Neural Network with attention mechanisms preferred) on a large dataset of eye-tracking data correlated with video content. The model predicts a “saliency map” overlaid on each frame, indicating the probability of viewer gaze. This is a separate model, trained independently, and applied during summarization.
    *   Input to the model: Visual features extracted from the video frame (e.g., using a pre-trained CNN), audio features, and potentially context from previous/next frames.
    *   Output: A 2D heatmap representing gaze probability for each pixel in the frame.

2.  **Hybrid Priority Metric:**
    *   Combine the existing annotation-based priority metrics (object interest, movement, etc.) with the predicted gaze probability from the Gaze Prediction Model.
    *   Weighted sum: `Final Priority = (Weight_Annotation * AnnotationPriority) + (Weight_Gaze * GazeProbability)`.  Weights are tunable parameters.
    *   This creates a “contextual priority” that reflects both objective interest and predicted subjective interest.

3.  **Dynamic Clip Generation & “Focus Framing”:**
    *   Instead of simply selecting clips based on high priority, implement a “focus framing” system.
    *   For each moment:
        *   Identify areas of high contextual priority (combined annotation + gaze).
        *   Dynamically crop or zoom the video to emphasize these areas.  The cropping/zooming parameters are adjusted based on the strength of the priority signal and the size/position of the prioritized region.
        *   Apply smooth transitions (crossfades, pan/zoom) between focused regions.
        *   Optionally, add a subtle visual "glow" or highlight around the focused areas to further draw attention.
    *   The resulting "focused clips" are shorter and more impactful than traditional clips, as they directly address where the viewer is likely looking.

4.  **Pseudocode for Dynamic Clip Generation:**

    ```
    function generate_focused_clip(frame, annotation_data, gaze_map):
      // Calculate contextual priority
      contextual_priority = (annotation_priority * weight_annotation) + (gaze_map * weight_gaze)

      // Identify regions of high priority
      high_priority_regions = find_regions_above_threshold(contextual_priority, threshold)

      if high_priority_regions is empty:
        return frame // No prioritization needed

      // Determine best focus region (e.g., largest area, highest average priority)
      best_region = select_best_region(high_priority_regions)

      // Calculate zoom/crop parameters
      zoom_factor, crop_box = calculate_zoom_crop(best_region, frame_size)

      // Apply zoom/crop to frame
      focused_frame = zoom_crop_frame(frame, zoom_factor, crop_box)

      //Apply smooth transition if needed.
      return focused_frame
    ```

5. **Timeline Adjustment**
    *   The summary timeline is adjusted in response to the gaze prediction.
    *   If the gaze model predicts prolonged attention to a specific area, the system automatically extends the duration of the corresponding clip.
    *   If the gaze model predicts rapid shifts in attention, the system shortens clips and increases the frequency of transitions.

6. **Multi-Camera Integration**
    *   The gaze prediction system can be extended to analyze multi-camera video feeds.
    *   The system can automatically switch between cameras to maintain focus on prioritized areas.
    *   This creates a more dynamic and engaging summary experience.
