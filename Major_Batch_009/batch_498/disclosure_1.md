## Dynamic Visual Narrative Generation

**Concept:** Extend the dual-component visual response system to construct dynamically evolving visual narratives based on user interaction. Instead of presenting static or sequentially displayed images, the system generates a continuously updating visual scene.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A "Visual Director" module. This module receives outputs from both the existing "Response Component" and "Supplemental Content Component," but does *not* simply display them. It synthesizes these elements into a coherent, evolving visual scene.
*   **Scene Representation:** The visual scene is represented as a layered 2D or 3D environment (depending on hardware capabilities). Each layer can contain elements derived from the Response and Supplemental Content.
*   **Dynamic Element Linking:** Elements within the scene are not fixed. The Visual Director establishes dynamic links between elements based on semantic relationships derived from the user input and ongoing dialog context. For example, if the user asks "What color is the car?", the Response Component might provide "red," while the Supplemental Content Component offers images of various cars. The Visual Director would then dynamically highlight a red car within the supplemental images.
*   **Animation & Transition Logic:** The system incorporates a library of pre-defined animation and transition effects. The Visual Director selects and applies these effects to elements within the scene to create smooth, visually engaging transitions as the user interacts with the system. This can be simple fades, zooms, pans, or more complex animations.
*   **Procedural Generation:** Incorporate procedural generation algorithms to create variations within the scene. For example, background elements, lighting effects, or minor details could be procedurally generated to add visual richness and prevent static repetition.
*   **User Control & Customization:** Allow users to customize the visual style and level of detail within the scene. This could include options to select different visual themes, adjust the animation speed, or disable certain effects.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  The system should consider device context (screen size, resolution, processing power) when generating the visual scene. It should be able to dynamically adjust the level of detail and complexity to ensure a smooth and responsive experience.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateVisualScene(userInput, responseData, supplementalData, dialogContext, deviceContext):
  // 1. Semantic Analysis: Extract key entities and relationships from userInput & dialogContext
  semanticAnalysisResult = AnalyzeSemantic(userInput, dialogContext)

  // 2. Scene Initialization: Create base scene layer
  scene = CreateScene(deviceContext)

  // 3. Response Component Integration: Add response elements to scene
  responseElements = ProcessResponseData(responseData)
  AddElementsToScene(scene, responseElements, semanticAnalysisResult)

  // 4. Supplemental Content Integration: Add supplemental content elements to scene
  supplementalElements = ProcessSupplementalData(supplementalData)
  AddElementsToScene(scene, supplementalElements, semanticAnalysisResult)

  // 5. Dynamic Linking: Establish relationships between elements
  EstablishElementLinks(scene, semanticAnalysisResult)

  // 6. Animation & Transitions: Apply animation and transitions
  ApplyAnimations(scene, semanticAnalysisResult)

  // 7. Procedural Generation: Enhance the scene with procedural details
  GenerateProceduralDetails(scene)

  // 8. Render and Display: Render the scene and display it on the screen
  RenderScene(scene)
  DisplayScene()

  RETURN scene
```
