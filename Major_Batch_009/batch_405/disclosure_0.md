## Adaptive Fairness Profiles & Dynamic Constraint Weighting

**Concept:** Extend the hyperparameter optimization framework to incorporate *user-defined fairness profiles* and *dynamic constraint weighting* based on real-time model performance feedback. This moves beyond static fairness constraints to a system that learns and adapts to evolving fairness priorities and mitigates unforeseen biases.

**Specifications:**

**1. Fairness Profile Definition:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A JSON-based profile defining multiple fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds, predictive equality) with associated weights and thresholds.  The weights determine the relative importance of each metric in the overall fairness objective. Thresholds represent acceptable levels of disparity.  Example:
    ```json
    {
      "profile_name": "High_Accuracy_Moderate_Fairness",
      "metrics": [
        {"name": "demographic_parity", "weight": 0.4, "threshold": 0.05},
        {"name": "equalized_odds", "weight": 0.6, "threshold": 0.10}
      ]
    }
    ```
*   **API Endpoint:** An API endpoint to upload and manage fairness profiles.  Profiles are versioned.

**2. Dynamic Constraint Weighting Algorithm:**

*   **Monitoring Phase:**  A continuous monitoring system tracks model performance *across different subgroups* defined by sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender).
*   **Bias Drift Detection:** A statistical test (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) detects significant shifts in bias metrics (disparities) over time.
*   **Weight Adjustment:** If bias drift is detected, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the weights in the fairness profile.  Increased weight is assigned to the metric exhibiting the greatest drift. The adjustment is performed via a reinforcement learning (RL) agent.
    *   **RL State:** Current bias metric values, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), time since last weight adjustment.
    *   **RL Action:** Adjust weights of fairness metrics (within defined bounds).
    *   **RL Reward:**  A composite reward function prioritizing both fairness (reduction in disparities) and performance (maintenance of accuracy).
*   **Constraints:** Maximum/Minimum bounds on weight adjustments to prevent instability. A 'rollback' mechanism to revert to previous weights if adjustments lead to detrimental results.

**3. Integration with Hyperparameter Optimization:**

*   **Modified Acquisition Function:** The constrained expected improvement acquisition function is extended to incorporate the dynamically weighted fairness constraints.
*   **Multi-Objective Optimization:** The optimization problem becomes a multi-objective problem: maximize accuracy, minimize bias (as defined by the weighted fairness profile).
*   **Pareto Frontier Exploration:** The optimization algorithm explores the Pareto frontier of trade-offs between accuracy and fairness.

**4. User Interface:**

*   **Visualization:** A dashboard visualizing fairness metrics across different subgroups, bias drift over time, and the effect of weight adjustments.
*   **Profile Management:**  Tools to create, upload, and manage fairness profiles.
*   **Interactive Adjustment:** Allow users to manually adjust weights and observe the impact on model performance.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Weight Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
function adjust_weights(current_weights, bias_metrics, performance_metrics, time_since_last_adjustment):
  // 1. Calculate Bias Drift
  bias_drift = calculate_bias_drift(bias_metrics)

  // 2. RL Agent - Determine Action
  action = rl_agent.get_action(state = (bias_drift, performance_metrics, time_since_last_adjustment))

  // 3. Apply Weight Adjustment (within bounds)
  new_weights = apply_weight_adjustment(current_weights, action)

  // 4. Return New Weights
  return new_weights
```
