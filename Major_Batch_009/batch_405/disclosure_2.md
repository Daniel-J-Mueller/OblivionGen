## Dynamic Query Decomposition with Adaptive Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the selective offload concept to not just *which* table operations to offload, but *how* to decompose a single table operation into smaller, independently executable units, dynamically adjusted based on real-time system load and data characteristics.

**Specification:**

**1. Components:**

*   **Query Decomposition Engine (QDE):**  Resides within the Stateful Data Processing Service.  Responsible for analyzing incoming queries and breaking down table operations (e.g., scans, filters, aggregations) into a graph of smaller, independent tasks.
*   **Granularity Controller (GC):**  A component within the QDE that determines the optimal granularity of task decomposition.  Granularity refers to the size and complexity of each individual task.
*   **Resource Monitor (RM):** Continuously tracks system load (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) on both the Stateful and Stateless services.
*   **Data Profiler (DP):**  Analyzes data characteristics (e.g., cardinality, data skew, compression) of the tables being accessed.
*   **Task Scheduler (TS):**  Responsible for distributing tasks to either the Stateful or Stateless service based on the decision made by the GC and the availability of resources.

**2. Operation:**

1.  **Query Reception:**  The Stateful Data Processing Service receives a query.
2.  **Decomposition Analysis:** The QDE analyzes each table operation in the query.
3.  **Granularity Determination:**  The GC determines the optimal granularity for each table operation based on:
    *   **System Load:** RM data.  High load favors finer granularity (more tasks, easier to distribute load). Low load allows for coarser granularity (fewer tasks, reduced overhead).
    *   **Data Characteristics:** DP data.  Data skew may necessitate finer granularity to ensure even workload distribution. High cardinality might benefit from coarser granularity.
    *   **Historical Performance:** A learning module within the GC tracks the performance of different granularities for similar operations and adjusts accordingly.
4.  **Task Creation:**  The QDE creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks representing the decomposed table operation.  Each task is a self-contained unit of work.
5.  **Offload Decision:** For each task, the TS determines whether to execute it on the Stateful or Stateless service, using the same criteria as in the original patent (e.g., task size, estimated execution time).
6.  **Execution & Aggregation:** Tasks are executed in parallel on the appropriate services. Results are aggregated to produce the final result.

**3. Pseudocode (GC - Granularity Controller):**

```
function determine_granularity(table_operation, system_load, data_profile):
  base_granularity = MEDIUM // Default granularity

  // Adjust based on system load
  if system_load > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    granularity = FINE
  elif system_load < LOW_THRESHOLD:
    granularity = COARSE
  else:
    granularity = base_granularity

  // Adjust based on data profile
  if data_profile.skew > SKEW_THRESHOLD:
    granularity = FINE
  elif data_profile.cardinality > CARDINALITY_THRESHOLD:
    granularity = COARSE

  // Apply historical learning (simplified)
  historical_performance = get_historical_performance(table_operation, granularity)
  if historical_performance.execution_time < current_execution_time:
    granularity = historical_performance.granularity

  return granularity
```

**4. Data Structures:**

*   **Task:** {task_id, operation_type, input_data, output_data, execution_service}
*   **DataProfile:** {skew, cardinality, compression_ratio}
*   **HistoricalPerformance:** {granularity, execution_time}

**5.  Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Scalability:**  Dynamic granularity allows for finer-grained load balancing, maximizing resource utilization.
*   **Reduced Latency:** Adapting granularity to data characteristics and system load can minimize execution time.
*   **Increased Resilience:** Finer granularity allows for easier fault tolerance â€“ smaller tasks can be retried more quickly.
*   **Optimized Resource Usage:**  Adjusting granularity based on resource availability can reduce overall cost.
