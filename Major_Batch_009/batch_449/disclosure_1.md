## Dynamic Beacon Mesh for Localization & Data

**Concept:** Expand beyond point-to-point beacon signaling to create a dynamic mesh network utilizing the beacon signals for both device localization *and* low-bandwidth data transmission.  This moves beyond simply delivering credentials and enables a more robust, localized IoT environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Node Types:** Three node types:
    *   **Anchor Nodes:**  Fixed location, powered, known coordinates.  Act as mesh backbone.
    *   **Relay Nodes:** Battery powered, mobile or stationary. Extend mesh range.
    *   **Client Nodes:** Devices receiving/transmitting data *and* utilizing location services.
*   **Beacon Signal Structure:**  Beyond SSID-based segmentation, signals contain:
    *   Node ID: Unique identifier for each node in the mesh.
    *   Signal Strength (RSSI):  Used for trilateration/multilateration location estimation.
    *   Hop Count:  Indicates the number of hops the signal has traveled.
    *   Data Payload (variable length, max 32 bytes):  For small data packets (sensor readings, simple commands).
    *   Time Stamp: Synchronized across the mesh network for accurate timing and localization.
*   **Mesh Protocol:**  A lightweight, slotted ALOHA-based protocol.
    *   Nodes listen for beacon signals during specific time slots.
    *   If a node detects a signal, it records the signal strength, Node ID, and other relevant data.
    *   Nodes transmit their own beacon signals during designated time slots.
    *   Nodes retransmit beacons if acknowledgements aren't received.
*   **Localization Algorithm:**  A Kalman filter-based trilateration/multilateration algorithm, leveraging signal strength and node IDs to estimate the location of client devices. Incorporate known anchor node locations as priors.
*   **Data Transmission:**  Utilize the beacon signals as a broadcast medium for small data packets.  Implement a simple acknowledgement system where the receiving node sends a beacon signal back to the transmitting node.  Implement error detection and correction using CRC codes.
*   **Synchronization:** Implement a time synchronization protocol to ensure that all nodes in the mesh network have a consistent view of time. Use NTP or similar protocol. 
*   **Security:** Implement a lightweight encryption scheme to secure the data transmitted over the mesh network. Use AES or similar algorithm. 

**Pseudocode (Client Node – Localization):**

```
// Initialize: Known Anchor Node Locations, Filter Parameters
anchorNodes = [ {id: 1, x: 0, y: 0}, {id: 2, x: 10, y: 0}, ... ]
kalmanFilter = new KalmanFilter(initialState, processNoise, measurementNoise)

loop:
  // Scan for Beacon Signals
  beaconSignals = scanForBeacons()

  // Filter Signals – Only consider signals from known nodes
  filteredSignals = filterSignals(beaconSignals, knownNodeIDs)

  // Estimate Location using Kalman Filter
  measurements = [ {nodeID: 1, RSSI: -60}, {nodeID: 2, RSSI: -70}, ... ] //Example
  estimatedLocation = kalmanFilter.update(measurements)

  //Output Location Data
  print(estimatedLocation.x, estimatedLocation.y)
```

**Novelty:**  The patent focuses on segmented data *delivery*. This expands to a *network*. The combination of localization and data transmission over a beacon mesh is the core innovation. Utilizing the inherent broadcast nature of beacon signals to create a self-organizing, low-power network goes beyond the scope of credential exchange.
