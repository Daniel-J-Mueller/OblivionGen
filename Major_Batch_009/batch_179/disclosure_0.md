## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning for Smart Environments

**Concept:** Expanding upon the multi-microphone array concept, create a system that actively maps and zones acoustic sources within a room, dynamically adjusting microphone sensitivity and beamforming to prioritize specific audio streams. This isn’t just about voice control, but about creating intelligent acoustic environments.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of 12 omnidirectional microphones distributed across the faceplate of the switch *and* extending to a small, detachable ‘acoustic halo’ that magnetically attaches above the switch. Halo contains 4 additional microphones. This halo will be optional, but will radically improve performance.
*   **Acoustic Sensor Suite:** Integrate a small, low-power ultrasonic sensor array (4 emitters/receivers) alongside the microphone array. This will provide rudimentary spatial mapping, improving accuracy of acoustic zoning.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge-TPU or similar AI accelerator integrated into the switch. Minimum 8GB RAM.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, Thread/Matter support.
*   **Power:** Standard AC power input. Auxiliary DC power input for halo functionality.

**Software/Firmware Specifications:**

*   **Acoustic Mapping Algorithm:** Real-time acoustic mapping engine. Utilizes data from microphone array, ultrasonic sensors, and potentially learned room geometry (user input or initial scan). Algorithm creates a dynamic heat map of sound sources within a range of approximately 10 meters.
*   **Zoning Logic:** System divides the acoustic space into definable zones (e.g., “user location,” “TV area,” “kitchen”).  Zones are dynamically adjusted based on detected sound sources.
*   **Beamforming Optimization:**  Beamforming is applied *per zone*. Microphones are weighted and combined to maximize signal from the target zone while suppressing noise from others.
*   **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):** Enhanced VAD that identifies *multiple* simultaneous speakers within different zones.
*   **Semantic Understanding:** Integration with a cloud-based or on-device semantic understanding engine.  This allows the system to differentiate between commands, conversations, and background noise, even in overlapping zones.
*   **User Profiles:** Support for multiple user profiles, each with personalized acoustic preferences (e.g., preferred voice assistant, preferred volume levels).
*   **API/SDK:** Publicly available API and SDK for integration with other smart home devices and platforms.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Automated calibration routine to compensate for room acoustics and microphone placement.

**Pseudocode (Zone Prioritization):**

```
//Initialization
Create AcousticMap
Create Zones (User, TV, Kitchen, etc.)

//Main Loop
Receive Microphone Data
Update AcousticMap (based on sound intensity and source location)
For each Zone:
    Calculate Zone Score (based on sound intensity, user presence, and priority settings)
    Adjust Microphone Weights (favoring microphones pointing towards high-scoring zones)
    Apply Beamforming (focused on high-scoring zones)
    Perform VAD (within the focused zones)

    If Voice Detected:
        Send Audio Stream to Speech Recognition Engine
        If Command Identified:
            Execute Command
        Else If Conversation Detected:
            Flag for Transcription/Analysis (optional)
```

**Novelty/Potential:**

This goes beyond simple voice control. It creates a truly *intelligent* acoustic environment. Applications include:

*   **Enhanced Voice Assistants:** More reliable voice control in noisy environments.
*   **Automatic Meeting Transcription:** Seamless transcription of meetings in open office spaces.
*   **Personalized Audio Experiences:**  Directing audio to specific listeners within a room.
*   **Security/Surveillance:**  Detecting unusual sounds or conversations within a defined area.
*   **Accessibility:**  Providing clearer audio for people with hearing impairments.

This pushes the boundaries of what’s possible with smart switches and opens up a wealth of new applications for acoustic sensing technology.
