## Acoustic Scene Generation for Personalized Voice Assistants

**Concept:** Expand user verification beyond *who* is speaking to *where* they are speaking, dynamically adjusting assistant behavior based on inferred acoustic environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Feature Extraction:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Speech-controlled device incorporates a small-form-factor microphone array (minimum 4 microphones) for capturing spatial audio data.
*   **Acoustic Feature Set 1 (Speech):** Standard Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), pitch, and energy levels extracted from the primary speech signal for ASR and user verification (as in the base patent).
*   **Acoustic Feature Set 2 (Environment):**  Extract features *from the residual noise* captured by the microphone array *excluding* the primary speech signal.  These features will focus on environmental characteristics:
    *   **Reverberation Time (RT60):** Estimated using Schroeder’s reversed integration method.
    *   **Ambient Noise Classification:**  Utilize a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., CNN) to classify ambient noise into categories (e.g., office, home, street, vehicle). The model must be adaptable/finetunable with limited data.
    *   **Sound Event Detection (SED):** Employ a trained SED model (e.g., YAMNet) to detect specific sound events (e.g., keyboard typing, door closing, children playing, traffic noise).
    *   **Spatial Sound Source Localization:** Using time difference of arrival (TDOA) techniques applied to the microphone array data, determine the direction and distance of prominent sound sources.

**2. Acoustic Scene Modeling:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Database:**  Maintain a database of labeled acoustic scenes. Initial database will contain broad categories (home, office, car, public transport). User-specific data will expand this.
*   **Scene Embedding:** Utilize a neural network (e.g., Variational Autoencoder) to create a low-dimensional embedding vector representing each acoustic scene based on the extracted environmental features.
*   **Dynamic Scene Adaptation:**  The system continuously analyzes the incoming environmental features and updates the acoustic scene embedding in real-time, allowing for dynamic adaptation to changing environments.

**3. Personalized Assistant Behavior:**

*   **Contextual Profile:**  Associate each user with a "contextual profile" which maps specific acoustic scenes to preferred assistant behaviors. Examples:
    *   *Office Scene:*  Prioritize work-related tasks, disable entertainment features, use a professional voice persona.
    *   *Home Scene:*  Enable entertainment features, offer family-related information, use a casual voice persona.
    *   *Car Scene:*  Focus on navigation, hands-free communication, and vehicle controls.
*   **Behavioral Adjustment:**  Based on the current acoustic scene and the user's contextual profile, the system adjusts the assistant's behavior accordingly. This includes:
    *   **Voice Persona:** Switch between different voice personas (e.g., professional, casual, energetic).
    *   **Response Priority:**  Prioritize different types of responses based on the environment.
    *   **Feature Activation:** Enable or disable specific features.
    *   **Volume Level:** Adjust the volume level based on the ambient noise.
    *   **Interruption Sensitivity:** Modify the assistant's sensitivity to interruptions.
*   **Learning & Refinement:**  The system continuously learns from user interactions and feedback to refine the mapping between acoustic scenes and preferred behaviors.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **On-Device Processing:** Environmental feature extraction and acoustic scene classification performed locally on the speech-controlled device to minimize latency and preserve privacy.
*   **Cloud-Based Learning:**  Contextual profiles and learning algorithms stored and updated in the cloud.
*   **Data Synchronization:**  Secure synchronization of contextual profiles and learned data between the device and the cloud.



**Pseudocode – Acoustic Scene Classification:**

```
function classifyAcousticScene(audioData):
  environmentalFeatures = extractEnvironmentalFeatures(audioData)
  sceneEmbedding = generateSceneEmbedding(environmentalFeatures)
  closestScene = findClosestScene(sceneEmbedding, sceneDatabase)
  return closestScene
```

This system builds upon the existing user verification framework by adding a layer of environmental awareness, leading to a more personalized and intelligent voice assistant experience. The acoustic scene data isn't solely about *who* is speaking, but *where* they are, allowing the assistant to adapt its behavior to the user's surroundings.
