## Adaptive Deletion Hints & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the conditional deletion framework to proactively influence data placement *before* a deletion is even considered, improving performance and reducing operational costs. Instead of solely reacting to deletion candidates based on retention policies, introduce “deletion hints” and a predictive prefetching system.

**Specification:**

**1. Deletion Hints:**

*   **Generation:** When an object is created or modified, alongside the modification sequence number, generate a “deletion hint”. This hint is a probabilistic prediction (a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0) indicating the likelihood of the object being a deletion candidate *before* its natural retention period expires.
*   **Factors:** The deletion hint is calculated based on:
    *   Object type (some object types are inherently more ephemeral).
    *   User behavior (e.g., a user frequently deleting similar objects).
    *   Application context (e.g., temporary data generated during a specific workflow).
    *   Historical data (deletion rates for similar objects).
*   **Storage:** Store the deletion hint as metadata alongside the object’s modification sequence number.

**2. Predictive Prefetching System:**

*   **Monitoring:** A dedicated “prefetching service” continuously monitors metadata nodes for objects with deletion hints exceeding a configurable threshold (e.g., 0.7).
*   **Tiering:** When an object’s deletion hint exceeds the threshold, the prefetching service initiates a tiered data movement operation:
    *   **Tier 0 (Hot):** If the object is currently on high-performance storage, move it to a slightly lower-cost tier *within* the high-performance tier (e.g., from NVMe to SSD).
    *   **Tier 1 (Warm):** If the object is already on a lower-cost tier, move it to an even lower-cost tier (e.g., from SSD to high-density HDD).
    *   **Tier 2 (Cold):** If the object is already on a cold storage tier, proactively archive it to tape or long-term storage.
*   **Asynchronous Operation:** All tiering operations are performed asynchronously to avoid impacting application performance.
*   **Re-evaluation:**  The deletion hint is re-evaluated periodically (e.g., every hour) to account for changes in user behavior or application context.  Tiering adjustments are made accordingly.
*   **Cancellation:** If the object is accessed after being moved to a lower tier, the prefetching service immediately moves it back to its original tier.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Service):**

```
function monitorMetadataNodes() {
  while (true) {
    for each metadataNode in metadataNodes {
      for each object in metadataNode.objects {
        if (object.deletionHint > threshold) {
          tierObject(object);
        }
      }
    }
    sleep(monitoringInterval);
  }
}

function tierObject(object) {
  currentTier = getObjectTier(object);
  if (currentTier == "Hot") {
    moveObjectToTier(object, "Warm");
  } else if (currentTier == "Warm") {
    moveObjectToTier(object, "Cold");
  } else if (currentTier == "Cold") {
    archiveObject(object);
  }
}

function moveObjectToTier(object, targetTier) {
  // Asynchronously copy data to the target tier
  // Update object metadata to reflect the new tier
}

function archiveObject(object) {
  // Asynchronously archive data to long-term storage
  // Update object metadata to reflect the archived status
}
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Storage Costs:** Proactively moving data to lower-cost tiers before deletion reduces overall storage expenses.
*   **Improved Performance:**  Moving frequently accessed data to appropriate tiers optimizes performance.
*   **Faster Deletion:** When a deletion is finally triggered, the data is already on a lower-cost tier, reducing the time and resources required for deletion.
*   **Predictive Optimization:** The deletion hint system learns from user behavior and application context to improve storage efficiency.
