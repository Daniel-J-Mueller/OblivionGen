## Adaptive Haptic Route Guidance System

**Concept:** A system that translates route deviation data into localized haptic feedback delivered through a wearable device (e.g., wristband, glove) to guide a user back onto the prescribed route *without* relying on visual or auditory cues. This differs from traditional navigation by prioritizing subtle, intuitive physical guidance.

**Specs:**

*   **Device:** Wearable haptic actuator array (minimum 16 actuators) capable of varying intensity and pattern. Lightweight, low-power consumption. Integrated GPS and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). Bluetooth connectivity for data transfer.
*   **Data Input:**  GPS coordinates, route information (polyline or similar), permissible deviation threshold (configurable).  Real-time IMU data (acceleration, angular velocity) for accurate orientation.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Calculate the user’s deviation from the planned route.
    2.  Map deviation direction and magnitude to a specific haptic pattern.  (e.g., slight deviation = gentle vibration on wrist; significant deviation = more intense vibration + localized pattern; exceeding threshold = pulsing vibration). Deviation *magnitude* translates to vibration *intensity*. Deviation *direction* maps to the *location* of the vibration on the actuator array.
    3.  Implement a smoothing filter to prevent erratic haptic feedback due to minor GPS fluctuations or momentary deviations.
    4.  Adaptive learning: The system learns user responsiveness to haptic patterns and adjusts intensity/patterns accordingly for optimal guidance.
*   **Haptic Patterns:**
    *   **Minor Deviation:**  Gentle, localized vibration on the wrist corresponding to the direction of correction.
    *   **Moderate Deviation:**  Increased vibration intensity + a directional “push” sensation created by sequentially activating actuators.
    *   **Major Deviation/Threshold Exceeded:** Pulsing vibration across multiple actuators, indicating a need for immediate course correction.
    *   **Route Confirmation:** Subtle, rhythmic vibration pattern indicating the user is on the correct path.
*   **Software Interface:**
    *   Route import/creation tools.
    *   Configurable deviation thresholds and haptic pattern customization.
    *   User profile management (adaptive learning data).
    *   Data logging for analysis and performance optimization.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable battery with a minimum of 8 hours operational life. Wireless charging capability.



**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  currentLocation = getGPSCoordinates();
  route = getRouteData();
  deviation = calculateDeviation(currentLocation, route);
  direction = calculateDirectionOfCorrection(deviation);
  magnitude = getDeviationMagnitude(deviation);

  // Apply Smoothing Filter
  smoothedMagnitude = applySmoothingFilter(magnitude);

  // Map deviation to haptic pattern
  if (smoothedMagnitude < minorThreshold) {
    activateHapticPattern("minor", direction);
  } else if (smoothedMagnitude < moderateThreshold) {
    activateHapticPattern("moderate", direction);
  } else {
    activateHapticPattern("major", direction);
  }

  //Adaptive Learning (simplified)
  if(userResponseToHaptic){
    adjustHapticIntensity(userResponse);
  }
}
