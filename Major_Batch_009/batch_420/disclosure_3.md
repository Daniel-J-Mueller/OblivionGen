## Dynamic Product 'Mood' Grouping & Affective Merchandising

**Concept:** Expand beyond implicit groupings based on price/sales data to incorporate real-time sentiment analysis of product reviews, social media mentions, and even customer browsing *behavior* (dwell time, scrolling speed) to create dynamic product "mood" groupings. These groupings would then be used to drive affective merchandising – presenting products in ways that resonate with a customer’s current emotional state.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Product Data: Standard product information (price, description, keywords, images).
    *   Review Data: Real-time scraping of product reviews from various sources (retail website, third-party review sites).
    *   Social Media Data: Monitoring of brand mentions, product hashtags, and relevant keywords on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.
    *   Behavioral Data: Tracking customer browsing behavior on the retail website (pages visited, dwell time on product pages, scrolling speed, mouse movements, click patterns).
*   **Sentiment Analysis Engine:**
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) model trained to identify emotional tone (joy, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, neutrality) in text data (reviews, social media posts).
    *   Image Recognition model to detect emotional cues in product images (e.g., warm colors evoking happiness, cool colors evoking calmness).
    *   Behavioral analysis algorithm to infer emotional state from browsing patterns (e.g., fast scrolling and quick clicks indicating frustration, slow browsing and careful examination indicating interest).
*   **Mood Grouping Algorithm:**
    *   Assign emotional scores to each product based on sentiment analysis of associated data.
    *   Cluster products into “mood” groups based on dominant emotional scores (e.g., “Relaxing & Cozy”, “Energetic & Fun”, “Sophisticated & Elegant”, “Practical & Efficient”).
    *   Dynamic Adjustment: Continuously update mood groupings based on real-time data fluctuations. Implement a decay factor to lessen the impact of older data.
*   **Affective Merchandising Interface:**
    *   Personalized Presentation: Display products in mood groupings tailored to the individual customer’s inferred emotional state (determined from purchase history, browsing behavior, and real-time data).
    *   Dynamic Layout: Adjust product display layout (e.g., image size, color scheme, font) to match the dominant mood of the grouping.
    *   Emotional Triggering: Incorporate subtle emotional cues (e.g., background music, color palettes) to enhance the emotional resonance of the merchandising presentation.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:**
    *   Continuously A/B test different mood groupings, merchandising layouts, and emotional cues to optimize for key performance indicators (KPIs) such as click-through rate, conversion rate, and revenue.

**Pseudocode (Mood Grouping):**

```
// Product Data: [product_id, product_name, price, description, image_url, review_text]

function calculate_mood_score(product_data) {
  review_sentiment = analyze_sentiment(product_data.review_text); // Returns score (-1 to 1)
  image_sentiment = analyze_image_sentiment(product_data.image_url); // Returns score (-1 to 1)
  
  mood_score = (review_sentiment + image_sentiment) / 2;
  
  return mood_score;
}

function create_mood_groups(product_list) {
  mood_groups = {
    "Joyful": [],
    "Calm": [],
    "Energetic": [],
    "Sophisticated": []
  };

  for (product in product_list) {
    mood_score = calculate_mood_score(product);

    if (mood_score > 0.5) {
      mood_groups["Joyful"].push(product);
    } else if (mood_score > 0.1) {
      mood_groups["Calm"].push(product);
    } else if (mood_score < -0.1) {
      mood_groups["Energetic"].push(product);
    } else {
      mood_groups["Sophisticated"].push(product);
    }
  }

  return mood_groups;
}
```
