**Adaptive Logging Granularity via User-Defined Profiles**

**Specification:**

This system extends the core logging endpoint concept by introducing user-defined logging profiles that dictate *what* state information is included with log data, and *at what frequency*.  Currently, the patent describes enriching logs with “state information” without specifying how granular this enrichment can be or how it’s controlled. This adds a layer of user control and optimizes resource usage.

**Components:**

1.  **Profile Definition Service:**  A REST API endpoint allowing users (or automated systems) to define logging profiles.  Profiles consist of:
    *   `profile_id`: Unique identifier for the profile.
    *   `state_info_types`: List of specific state information types to include (e.g., CPU usage, memory allocation, network latency, container ID, execution time).  This is a controlled vocabulary, extensible via plugin architecture.
    *   `sampling_rate`:  Frequency at which state information is collected (e.g., every log event, every 10 log events, every 5 seconds, based on event severity).
    *   `default_state`: A set of baseline state information to *always* include, even if sampling rate dictates omission.  This might include things like the user ID or a session identifier.

2.  **Logging Endpoint Modification:** The logging endpoint is updated to accept a `profile_id` with each log data transmission. If no `profile_id` is provided, a default profile is used.

3.  **State Information Manager:** A new component responsible for collecting and managing state information. It maintains a cache of state data and uses the `sampling_rate` from the selected profile to determine when to refresh/transmit.  Supports plugin architecture for adding new state information types.

4.  **Metadata Store:**  A key-value store linking `profile_id` to its definition. Could be a simple database or configuration file.

**Workflow:**

1.  User defines a logging profile via the Profile Definition Service.
2.  The profile is stored in the Metadata Store.
3.  User-submitted code generates log data and includes a `profile_id`.
4.  The logging endpoint retrieves the profile from the Metadata Store.
5.  The State Information Manager, guided by the profile's `state_info_types` and `sampling_rate`, gathers the appropriate state information.
6.  The enriched log data (original log + state information) is transmitted to the output location.

**Pseudocode (Logging Endpoint Modification):**

```
function receive_log_data(log_data, profile_id):
  profile = get_profile(profile_id)  //Retrieve from metadata store
  if profile is null:
    profile = get_default_profile()

  state_info = get_state_information(profile) //Call to State Information Manager

  enriched_data = combine_log_data_and_state(log_data, state_info)

  transmit_to_output(enriched_data)
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   **Reduced Overhead:**  Users can tailor logging granularity to their specific needs, minimizing resource consumption.
*   **Improved Debugging:**  Granular control over state information can facilitate more effective debugging.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Users can selectively log sensitive information.
*   **Scalability:**  Optimized logging reduces the load on storage and analysis systems.

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Plugin Architecture:**  Extensibility is crucial for supporting a wide range of state information types.
*   **Security:**  Access control mechanisms should be implemented to prevent unauthorized profile creation and modification.
*   **Monitoring:**  Logging system performance should be monitored to ensure optimal resource utilization.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Integration with cloud cost management systems to determine logging costs for different profiles.
