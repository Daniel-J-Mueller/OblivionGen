## Adaptive Packet Prioritization via Predictive Congestion Mapping

**Specification:** A system for dynamically prioritizing packets based on predicted congestion levels *across multiple potential paths* to a destination. This extends the idea of transmit window limits by adding a proactive, path-aware prioritization layer.

**Core Concept:** Instead of just limiting transmission *to* a destination, this system probes and predicts congestion *along multiple possible routes* to that destination, and then prioritizes packets accordingly. This isn’t about simply speeding up transmission; it’s about intelligently choosing *which* packets get sent first to minimize overall latency and packet loss.

**Components:**

1.  **Path Prober Module:**
    *   Continuously sends low-bandwidth "probe" packets along multiple potential paths to each destination.
    *   Measures RTT, packet loss, and jitter for each path.
    *   Uses a Kalman filter or similar predictive algorithm to estimate future congestion levels on each path.
2.  **Packet Classifier Module:**
    *   Analyzes incoming packets and assigns them a priority level. Priority can be based on application type (e.g., video conferencing = high, background file transfer = low), QoS markings, or custom criteria.
3.  **Congestion Map:**
    *   A data structure (e.g., a graph) representing all known paths to each destination and their predicted congestion levels. Updated continuously by the Path Prober Module.
4.  **Packet Prioritization Engine:**
    *   Receives packets and consults the Congestion Map.
    *   Selects the “best” path for each packet based on its priority and the predicted congestion levels.
    *   Assigns a forwarding tag to the packet indicating the selected path.
5.  **Adaptive Window Adjustment:**
    *   Integrates with the existing transmit window limits. The prioritization engine dynamically adjusts these limits *per path* based on real-time congestion.  A congested path will have its window reduced more aggressively than a less congested one.

**Pseudocode (Packet Prioritization Engine):**

```
function prioritizePacket(packet, congestionMap):
  priority = getPacketPriority(packet)
  bestPath = null
  lowestCongestion = infinity

  for each path in congestionMap.getPaths(packet.destination):
    congestion = path.predictedCongestion()
    if congestion < lowestCongestion:
      lowestCongestion = congestion
      bestPath = path

  // Adjust transmit window limit for best path based on congestion
  bestPath.adjustTransmitWindow(congestion)

  packet.forwardingTag = bestPath.pathID

  return packet
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Path Object:**
    *   `pathID`: Unique identifier for the path.
    *   `RTT`: Round Trip Time.
    *   `packetLossRate`: Percentage of packets lost.
    *   `jitter`: Variation in latency.
    *   `predictedCongestion()`: Returns a congestion score (lower is better).
    *   `transmitWindowLimit`:  Current transmit window limit for this path.
    *   `adjustTransmitWindow(congestion)`: Adjusts transmitWindowLimit based on congestion.
*   **Congestion Map:**
    *   `getPaths(destination)`: Returns a list of Path objects for a given destination.

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simple transmit window limiting by:

*   **Proactive Congestion Prediction:**  Rather than reacting to congestion, it attempts to predict it.
*   **Multi-Path Awareness:**  It considers multiple potential paths to a destination and selects the best one for each packet.
*   **Dynamic Path-Specific Windowing:** Transmit window limits are adjusted *per path*, allowing for more granular control over traffic flow.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time video streaming
*   Online gaming
*   Mission-critical communications
*   Data center networking.
