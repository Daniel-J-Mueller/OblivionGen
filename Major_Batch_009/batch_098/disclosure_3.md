## Personalized Acoustic Environments

**Concept:** A system which dynamically alters a user's ambient soundscape based on detected sentiment *and* predicted emotional trajectory. This goes beyond simple mood-reactive music selection; it aims to proactively *shape* the user's emotional state.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Continuous audio stream (microphone), sentiment analysis model (as in the provided patent – utilized for real-time sentiment detection), physiological data (optional – heart rate variability, skin conductance via wearable sensor for enhanced emotional state estimation).
*   **Core Component: Emotional Trajectory Predictor:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on time-series data of sentiment, physiological signals, and user behavior (e.g., app usage, calendar events).  This model predicts the user's likely emotional state 5-10 minutes into the future, and outputs a probability distribution over possible emotional states.
*   **Acoustic Environment Generator:** A system capable of synthesizing and manipulating complex soundscapes. This utilizes a library of environmental sounds (rain, forest, city, etc.), musical elements, binaural beats, and spatial audio techniques.
*   **Mapping Function:** A configurable function which maps predicted emotional states to specific acoustic environment parameters. Examples:
    *   Low predicted happiness & high stress -> gentle rain sounds, slow tempo ambient music, binaural beats promoting relaxation.
    *   High predicted excitement & low stress -> upbeat music, subtle city ambience, increased spatial audio dynamism.
    *   Predicted frustration & increasing stress -> shifting soundscape, blending calming elements with white noise to avoid overstimulation.
*   **User Profile & Customization:** A system for users to create profiles, specifying preferred soundscapes, intensities, and personalization parameters. Allows for A/B testing of different acoustic interventions.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns from user feedback (explicit ratings, implicit behavior – e.g., volume adjustments, soundscape skipping) to refine the mapping function and personalization parameters.  Utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize for user well-being and desired emotional outcomes.
* **Hardware integration**: Noise cancelling headphones or a dedicated ambient audio system.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    audioData = getAudioData()
    sentiment = analyzeSentiment(audioData) // Utilize existing patent's model
    physiologicalData = getPhysiologicalData() // Optional
    predictedEmotion = predictEmotion(sentiment, physiologicalData) // RNN based prediction
    
    acousticParams = mapEmotionToAcousticParams(predictedEmotion, userProfile)
    
    generateSoundscape(acousticParams)
    
    // Feedback loop for learning and adaptation
    userFeedback = getUserFeedback()
    updateModel(userFeedback)
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply reacting to current sentiment. It aims to *proactively* guide the user's emotional state towards a desired outcome, using sophisticated predictive modeling and personalized acoustic interventions. The integration of physiological data provides a more holistic understanding of the user’s emotional state and allows for more effective intervention.
