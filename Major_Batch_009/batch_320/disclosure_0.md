## Adaptive Resource Delegation with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the multi-party access control to include a "decay" mechanism for permissions. Instead of static approvals, permissions granted by either the software application developer or the end-user gradually diminish over time unless actively refreshed. This addresses scenarios where initial consent might not reflect ongoing usage or evolving risk profiles.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Permission Decay Rate:** Each access policy (from software application and user) incorporates a decay rate parameter (e.g., expressed as percentage per day/week/month).  The rate is configurable per application, user, resource type, or even individual resources.

2.  **Permission Strength Metric:** Introduce a “Permission Strength” value associated with each resource access request. This value is initialized based on the combined approvals from the software application and the user. It decreases over time according to the configured decay rates.

3.  **Threshold-Based Authorization:** The resource access manager service authorizes access only if the “Permission Strength” exceeds a predefined threshold. This threshold can be dynamically adjusted based on factors like resource sensitivity or observed usage patterns.

4.  **Refresh Mechanisms:**

    *   **Explicit Refresh:**  Both the software application developer and the end-user can initiate a "refresh" of permissions, resetting the “Permission Strength” to its initial value.
    *   **Implicit Refresh:**  The system automatically refreshes permissions based on observed user activity. For example, if the user actively uses a feature requiring access to a resource, the system automatically refreshes the “Permission Strength”. This requires a "trust score" to minimize abuse.

5.  **Decay Profiles:** Define pre-set decay profiles (e.g., “short-term access,” “long-term access,” “sensitive data”) that automatically configure the decay rate and threshold based on resource type and usage context.

6.  **Alerting & Escalation:**  If the “Permission Strength” falls below a warning threshold, the system sends an alert to the user and/or the software application developer, prompting them to refresh their consent. If the strength falls below the authorization threshold, access is revoked, and an escalation process is initiated.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function authorizeAccess(request):
  appPolicy = getAppPolicy(request.appId, request.resourceId)
  userPolicy = getUserPolicy(request.userId, request.appId)

  initialStrength = calculateInitialStrength(appPolicy, userPolicy)
  currentTime = getCurrentTime()
  timeSinceLastApproval = currentTime - max(appPolicy.lastApprovedTime, userPolicy.lastApprovedTime)
  permissionStrength = initialStrength * (1 - (appPolicy.decayRate + userPolicy.decayRate) * timeSinceLastApproval)

  if permissionStrength > authorizationThreshold:
    updateLastApprovalTimes(appPolicy, userPolicy)
    return true
  else:
    //Log the failure. Trigger alerts / escalations.
    return false
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AppPolicy`: `{appId, resourceId, decayRate, lastApprovedTime, constraints}`
*   `UserPolicy`: `{userId, appId, decayRate, lastApprovedTime, constraints}`
*   `AuthorizationThreshold`: (Configurable, per resource type)

**Potential Applications:**

*   Temporary access to sensitive data (e.g., financial records).
*   Dynamic access control for IoT devices.
*   Revocable permissions for third-party applications.
