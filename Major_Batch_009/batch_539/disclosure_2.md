## Adaptive Multicast Prioritization via Predictive QoS

**Concept:** Extend the unbuffered multicast delivery concept with a dynamic prioritization scheme based on predicted Quality of Service (QoS) metrics for individual receiving devices. This allows the network access point to intelligently handle congestion and ensure critical multicast streams are delivered even when bandwidth is limited.

**Specs:**

**1. QoS Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** The access point monitors network conditions (RSSI, SNR, interference, link speed) *and* application-layer feedback (if available â€“ e.g., RTP reports) from each client. It also tracks historical data for each client, building a baseline for expected performance.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., a simple linear regression, or a more complex time series forecaster like LSTM) to predict the achievable throughput and latency for each client. Inputs: historical data, current network conditions, application feedback. Output: Predicted throughput, predicted latency.
*   **QoS Score:** Calculate a QoS score for each client based on predicted throughput and latency.  Higher throughput and lower latency = higher score. This score is updated periodically.

**2. Multicast Stream Classification:**

*   **Stream Tagging:** Implement a mechanism to tag multicast streams with a priority level (High, Medium, Low). This can be configured statically or dynamically based on application requirements.
*   **Priority Inheritance:** If a client is subscribed to multiple multicast streams with different priorities, the client's effective priority is the highest priority among all subscribed streams.

**3. Adaptive Multicast Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Bandwidth Estimation:** Continuously estimate available bandwidth on the wireless link.
*   **Resource Allocation:** When bandwidth is limited, allocate resources based on a combination of:
    *   Client QoS Score
    *   Multicast Stream Priority
    *   Number of clients subscribed to the stream.
*   **Prioritization Logic:** Implement the following prioritization rules:
    *   Highest priority streams destined for clients with the highest QoS scores are transmitted first.
    *   If multiple streams have the same priority, allocate bandwidth proportionally to the number of subscribers.
    *   Low-priority streams may be delayed or dropped during periods of high congestion.
*   **Unbuffered Delivery Adaptation:** Extend the unbuffered delivery mechanism to consider the priority of the multicast frame.  High-priority frames are prioritized for immediate transmission, even if it means delaying lower-priority frames.

**4. Signaling & Control:**

*   **Client Reporting:** Clients periodically report their current QoS conditions (e.g., buffer occupancy, packet loss) to the access point.
*   **Access Point Feedback:** The access point provides feedback to clients, indicating the priority of the streams they are receiving.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Allow network administrators to dynamically adjust the prioritization rules and threshold values based on network conditions and application requirements.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Inside the Access Point

function allocateBandwidth(multicastFrames[], clients[]) {
  for each frame in multicastFrames {
    bestClient = null
    highestPriorityScore = -1

    for each client in clients {
      priorityScore = client.qosScore * frame.priority

      if (priorityScore > highestPriorityScore) {
        highestPriorityScore = priorityScore
        bestClient = client
      }
    }

    if (bestClient != null) {
      transmitFrame(frame, bestClient)
    } else {
      // Drop or buffer frame
    }
  }
}

function transmitFrame(frame, client) {
  // Transmit frame to client using unbuffered delivery mechanism
}
```

**Novelty:** This combines proactive QoS prediction with dynamic prioritization of unbuffered multicast streams, offering a more intelligent and adaptive approach to multicast delivery. It allows the network to proactively adjust to changing conditions and ensure that critical multicast streams are delivered reliably, even in congested environments.
