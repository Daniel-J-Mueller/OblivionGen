## Adaptive Sensor Fusion with Bio-Inspired Predictive Filtering

**Concept:** Enhance the accuracy and robustness of relative motion estimation by incorporating a bio-inspired predictive filtering system that anticipates sensor drift and environmental disturbances *before* they significantly impact data quality. This leverages principles found in biological sensor systems (e.g., the vestibular system in mammals) to proactively mitigate errors rather than reactively correcting them.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing sensor modules and frame-relative sensor (as described in the reference patent).
    *   Dedicated low-latency processing unit (FPGA or similar) for implementing the predictive filter.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – 9-axis (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) – integrated *within* the frame-relative sensor module to capture high-frequency motion data.
    *   High-bandwidth, low-latency communication bus between the IMU, frame-relative sensor, and processing unit.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **IMU Data Preprocessing:** Raw IMU data is filtered (Kalman or complementary filter) to minimize noise and drift.
    2.  **Predictive Motion Model:** A short-term motion model is built using the preprocessed IMU data. This model predicts the *expected* relative motion of the frame-relative sensor *before* the next data point is received. This could be a simple constant velocity/acceleration model, or a more complex model utilizing techniques like particle filtering.
    3.  **Sensor Data Fusion:** The predicted motion is combined with the actual sensor data using a weighted average or Kalman filter. The weighting factor is dynamically adjusted based on a confidence metric.
    4.  **Confidence Metric:**  A confidence metric is calculated to assess the reliability of both the predicted motion and the actual sensor data. Factors influencing confidence:
        *   **IMU Noise:** Higher IMU noise reduces confidence in the predicted motion.
        *   **Sensor Variance:** Higher sensor variance reduces confidence in the sensor data.
        *   **Prediction Error:**  Discrepancy between the predicted motion and the actual sensor data reduces confidence in both.
        *   **Environmental Context:** (Optional) Environmental factors (e.g., turbulence, vibrations) can further adjust the confidence levels.
    5.  **Adaptive Weighting:** The weights assigned to the predicted motion and actual sensor data are dynamically adjusted based on the confidence metric. When the confidence in the predicted motion is high (low IMU noise, low prediction error), the weight is increased. When the confidence in the sensor data is high (low sensor variance), the weight is increased.
    6.  **Drift Compensation:** Continuously monitor prediction error. If a consistent drift is detected, apply a small correction to the predicted motion model.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Initialize
predicted_motion = initial_motion;
confidence_predicted = initial_confidence;
confidence_sensor = initial_confidence;

loop:
    // Read sensor data
    sensor_data = read_sensor();
    imu_data = read_imu();

    // Predict motion using IMU
    predicted_motion = predict_motion(imu_data, predicted_motion);

    // Calculate confidence
    confidence_predicted = calculate_confidence_predicted(imu_data);
    confidence_sensor = calculate_confidence_sensor(sensor_data);

    // Calculate weighted average
    weighted_motion = (confidence_predicted * predicted_motion + confidence_sensor * sensor_data) / (confidence_predicted + confidence_sensor);

    // Update predicted motion for next iteration
    predicted_motion = weighted_motion;

    // Output relative motion
    output_relative_motion(weighted_motion);
```

**Novelty:**

Traditional sensor fusion relies on *correcting* errors after they occur. This system proactively anticipates potential errors and mitigates them *before* they significantly impact data quality. The bio-inspired approach of incorporating an internal model (analogous to the vestibular system) and continuously adjusting predictions offers a more robust and accurate solution, especially in dynamic and noisy environments. The adaptive weighting based on a comprehensive confidence metric further enhances the system's resilience.
