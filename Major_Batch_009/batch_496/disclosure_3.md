## Dynamic Environmental Soundscapes

**Concept:** Augment the undesirable sound suppression with *proactive* environmental soundscape generation. Instead of simply removing distracting noises, the system replaces them with contextually relevant and soothing sounds, creating a more immersive and productive communication experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Environmental Soundscape Generator (ESG)
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Raw audio stream (pre-suppression)
    *   Suppression Mode Selection (from user)
    *   Real-time environmental analysis (using device sensors – accelerometer, light sensor, microphone) – identifies broad environment type (office, home, outdoors, vehicle)
    *   Communication session metadata (video call, voice call, screen share)
    *   User Profile (preferences for soundscapes – nature sounds, ambient music, white noise)
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Environmental Classification:**  AI module classifies the environment in real-time.
    2.  **Soundscape Selection:** Based on environment, suppression mode, session type, and user profile, ESG selects an appropriate soundscape.  Soundscapes are comprised of layered audio elements.
    3.  **Dynamic Mixing:**  ESG dynamically mixes the selected soundscape elements.  Intensity of specific elements (e.g., birdsong, rain, ambient music) adjusted based on:
        *   Detected noise levels (before suppression). Louder noise = louder soundscape elements.
        *   Communication activity.  During speech, soundscape volume *decreases* to prioritize clarity. During silence, volume *increases*.
        *   User’s emotional state (estimated from voice analysis – optional). Calming soundscapes for stressed users.
    4.  **Layered Integration:** ESG inserts the dynamically mixed soundscape *under* the suppressed audio stream. The resulting signal is sent to the communication partner.

*   **Pseudocode (Soundscape Mixing):**

```
function mixSoundscape(noiseLevel, speechActivity, userEmotion, environmentType) {
  // Define base soundscape elements for each environment
  soundscapeElements = {
    "office": ["ambient_hum", "distant_city"],
    "home": ["crackling_fire", "gentle_rain"],
    "outdoors": ["birdsong", "wind_chimes"]
  }

  // Retrieve base elements for the current environment
  baseElements = soundscapeElements[environmentType]

  // Initialize volume levels
  elementVolumes = {}
  for (element in baseElements) {
    elementVolumes[element] = 0.2 // Base volume
  }

  // Adjust volume based on noise level
  if (noiseLevel > threshold) {
    for (element in elementVolumes) {
      elementVolumes[element] += map(noiseLevel, threshold, maxNoise, 0, 0.3)
    }
  }

  // Reduce volume during speech activity
  if (speechActivity) {
    for (element in elementVolumes) {
      elementVolumes[element] *= 0.5
    }
  }

  //Adjust based on emotion (example)
  if (userEmotion == "stressed"){
    elementVolumes["gentle_rain"] += 0.2;
  }
  
  // Generate soundscape from elements and volumes
  soundscape = generateSoundscape(elementVolumes);

  return soundscape;
}
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:**  Standard microphone and speaker.  Optional:  High-quality noise-canceling headphones.
*   **Software Requirements:** AI/ML model for environmental classification and emotion detection.  Audio processing library for dynamic mixing and soundscape generation.
*   **User Interface:** Settings to customize soundscape preferences, adjust mixing levels, and enable/disable the feature.
*   **Potential Extensions:** Integration with smart home devices to trigger soundscapes based on real-world events (e.g., rain detected by a weather sensor).
