## Adaptive Sensory Augmentation – “EchoBloom”

**Concept:** Expand the virtual browsing experience beyond visual overlays into a localized, responsive haptic and auditory environment. Essentially, ‘bloom’ sensory feedback around detected virtual items, mirroring their ‘importance’ or proximity within the virtual space, creating a more immersive and intuitive navigation system.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Mobile Device:** Existing camera & processing capabilities (as per the base patent).
*   **Haptic Array:** A small, wearable array (wristband, glove section, or integrated into a phone case) containing an array of micro-actuators. These actuators create localized pressure variations, simulating texture or proximity.
*   **Bone Conduction Headphones:**  Delivering directional audio cues without obstructing ambient sound.
*   **Low-Power Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Transceivers:**  Integrated into the mobile device and haptic array for precise positional tracking *relative to virtual objects* – crucial for accurate sensory feedback.

**Software/Pseudocode:**

1.  **Object & Ranking Detection:** (Leverages existing patent functionality) Detects objects in the scene & assigns rankings to associated virtual items.

2.  **“Bloom Radius” Calculation:**
    *   `BloomRadius = BaseRadius + (RankingMultiplier * ItemRanking) + (DistanceModifier * DistanceToItem)`
        *   `BaseRadius`:  Minimum “bloom” radius (e.g., 2cm).
        *   `RankingMultiplier`: Scales the impact of item ranking (e.g., 0.5cm per ranking point).
        *   `ItemRanking`:  Ranking assigned to the virtual item.
        *   `DistanceModifier`:  Reduces bloom radius as the user moves closer (e.g., 0.1cm per cm closer).
        *   `DistanceToItem`: Calculated via UWB triangulation.

3.  **Haptic Feedback Generation:**
    *   For each detected virtual item:
        *   Calculate `BloomRadius`.
        *   Activate corresponding micro-actuators on the haptic array *within the calculated radius*.
        *   Actuation intensity scales with `ItemRanking` & inversely with `DistanceToItem`.
        *   Implement different “texture” profiles for various item categories (e.g., smooth for clothing, rough for tools).

4.  **Auditory Cue Generation:**
    *   Spatialized audio cues (“chimes”, “pulses”) emitted from the direction of detected virtual items.
    *   Audio intensity & frequency modulated by `ItemRanking` & `DistanceToItem`.
    *   Implement distinct auditory profiles for item categories.
    *   Utilize bone conduction to avoid obstructing ambient sound.

5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Continuously update haptic & auditory feedback based on device movement, object detection, and ranking changes.
    *   Implement a user-adjustable “sensitivity” setting to control the overall intensity of the sensory augmentation.

**Example Scenario:**

The user points their phone at a shelf of books.  The system detects a high-ranking book (based on user preferences or recommendations).  The user feels a gentle, localized pressure on their wrist (simulating the book’s presence), accompanied by a subtle chime emanating from the direction of the book on the display. As the user moves their hand closer to the book, the pressure and chime intensify.  If the user ignores the book, the sensory feedback gradually diminishes.
