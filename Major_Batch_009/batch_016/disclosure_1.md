## Dynamic Request Shaping with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Expand on the buffering mentioned in claim 14, but move beyond simple buffering to *predictive* buffering combined with dynamic request shaping informed by service-level agreement (SLA) prioritization. The goal is to smooth traffic *before* it reaches the receiving service, actively shaping requests based on anticipated load and the value of the request.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Buffer Agent (PBA)** – Resides on each sending service.
    *   **Input:** Outbound service requests (metadata + payload).
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **SLA Classification:** Analyze request metadata to determine SLA tier (e.g., Platinum, Gold, Silver, Basic).
        *   **Load Prediction:** Use a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) trained on historical request rates to predict the receiving service’s load over a short time horizon (e.g., 1-5 seconds).  Consider features like time of day, day of week, and observed recent traffic patterns.
        *   **Buffering/Shaping:** Based on SLA and predicted load:
            *   **High SLA / High Predicted Load:** Prioritize buffering and potential request *splitting* (see Component 3).
            *   **Low SLA / High Predicted Load:** Aggressively buffer or drop requests (with appropriate error handling/retries).
            *   **High SLA / Low Predicted Load:** Minimal buffering. Pass requests through immediately.
            *   **Low SLA / Low Predicted Load:** Minimal buffering.
        *   **Adaptive Buffering:** Dynamically adjust buffer size based on forecast accuracy and observed performance.
*   **Component 2: Receiving Service Load Balancer (RSLB)** – Sits in front of the receiving service.
    *   **Input:** Requests from PBAs.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Buffer Status Monitoring:** Track buffer occupancy at each PBA.
        *   **Feedback Loop:** Provide feedback to PBAs regarding actual load and performance. This informs the adaptive buffering in Component 1.
        *   **Rate Limiting Override:** Allows for a temporary override of rate limits based on critical requests (identified through SLA).
*   **Component 3: Request Splitting Module (RSM)** – Integrated into PBAs.
    *   **Input:** High-SLA requests identified by PBA.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Decomposition:** Break down complex requests into smaller, independent sub-requests.
        *   **Parallelization:** Send sub-requests to the receiving service concurrently.
        *   **Reassembly:** Aggregate responses from sub-requests and return the complete response to the client. (Requires state management at the PBA).

**Pseudocode (PBA - simplified):**

```
function sendRequest(request):
  slaTier = getSLATier(request)
  predictedLoad = getPredictedLoad()

  if slaTier == "Platinum" and predictedLoad > threshold:
    bufferRequest(request)
    splitRequest(request) //Optional
  elif predictedLoad > threshold:
    bufferRequest(request)
  else:
    sendRequestImmediately(request)

function bufferRequest(request):
  addRequestToBuffer(request)

function splitRequest(request):
  subRequests = decomposeRequest(request)
  for subRequest in subRequests:
      sendRequest(subRequest)

```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Request Buffer:**  Queue or priority queue (based on SLA).
*   **Load Forecast Model:** Time-series model (e.g., ARIMA coefficients, LSTM weights).
*   **SLA Mapping:**  Table mapping request metadata to SLA tiers.
