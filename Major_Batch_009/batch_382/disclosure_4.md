## Dynamic Scene Complexity Scoring & Adaptive Resolution Streaming

**Concept:** Leverage the static content detection framework to dynamically assess scene complexity and adjust streaming resolution *within* a single video, prioritizing bandwidth for visually rich segments and reducing it for simpler ones, even mid-stream. This isn't just about identifying *static* sections, but quantifying how *dynamic* the rest are.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Scene Complexity Metric:**
    *   Develop a ‘Scene Complexity Score’ (SCS) based on the feature data already extracted for static content detection (color data, object data, audio frequency data, text data).
    *   SCS = w1\*ColorVariance + w2\*ObjectCount + w3\*AudioEntropy + w4\*TextDensity.
        *   `ColorVariance`: Standard deviation of color histograms within a frame. Higher variance = more complex.
        *   `ObjectCount`: Number of detected objects (via object detection models) within a frame.
        *   `AudioEntropy`: Entropy of the audio frequency spectrum. Higher entropy = more complex soundscape.
        *   `TextDensity`: Number of characters/symbols detected in a frame.
    *   Weights (w1, w2, w3, w4) are tunable parameters, potentially learned through a reinforcement learning model optimizing for perceived visual quality and bandwidth usage.
    *   Calculate SCS for each analyzed frame.  A moving average of SCS over a short time window (e.g., 5-10 frames) provides a smoothed measure of scene complexity.

2.  **Adaptive Resolution Control:**
    *   Define resolution tiers (e.g., 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p).
    *   Establish threshold SCS values for each resolution tier.  For example:
        *   SCS < 20: 240p
        *   20 <= SCS < 40: 360p
        *   40 <= SCS < 60: 480p
        *   60 <= SCS < 80: 720p
        *   SCS >= 80: 1080p
    *   Continuously monitor the moving average SCS.
    *   Dynamically adjust the streaming resolution based on the current SCS, transitioning smoothly between tiers.  Implement a hysteresis mechanism to prevent rapid toggling between resolutions.

3.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   The static content detection pipeline from the provided patent forms the foundation.  Modify it to calculate SCS in addition to identifying static segments.
    *   Integrate with a video streaming server capable of dynamically encoding and delivering video at different resolutions.
    *   Client-side implementation: The client receives the dynamically adjusted resolution information from the server and decodes the video accordingly.
    *   Network Considerations:  The system must be robust to network fluctuations. Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure a smooth viewing experience even with limited bandwidth.



**Pseudocode (Server-side):**

```
function processVideo(videoStream):
  for each frame in videoStream:
    features = extractFeatures(frame) //Color, Objects, Audio, Text
    scs = calculateSceneComplexityScore(features)
    resolution = determineResolution(scs)
    encodeFrame(frame, resolution)
    sendEncodedFrame(encodedFrame)
end function

function calculateSceneComplexityScore(features):
  colorVariance = calculateColorVariance(features.color)
  objectCount = features.objects.length
  audioEntropy = calculateAudioEntropy(features.audio)
  textDensity = features.text.length

  scs = w1 * colorVariance + w2 * objectCount + w3 * audioEntropy + w4 * textDensity
  return scs

function determineResolution(scs):
  if scs < 20:
    return "240p"
  else if scs < 40:
    return "360p"
  else if scs < 60:
    return "480p"
  else if scs < 80:
    return "720p"
  else:
    return "1080p"
