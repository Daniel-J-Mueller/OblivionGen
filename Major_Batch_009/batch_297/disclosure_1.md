## Dynamic DNS Resolver Weighting based on Real-Time Content Cache Hit Ratios

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on determining demand *independent* of POP capacity. This builds on that by actively *steering* DNS resolution towards POPs exhibiting higher cache hit ratios for specific content *types*, thereby reducing load on POPs with lower hit rates and improving overall user experience. It's not simply load balancing based on capacity, but proactive content-aware steering.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** DNS Resolver Modification Module (DRMM) - a software module integrated within existing DNS resolvers.
*   **Data Source:** Real-time cache hit ratio data from each POP, categorized by content type (e.g., video, images, static HTML, dynamic content). This data is pushed from each POP to a central ‘Cache Status Server’ (CSS).
*   **CSS:** Collects, aggregates, and publishes cache hit ratios per POP and content type. The CSS must support fast updates (sub-second) and provide an API for the DRMM.
*   **DRMM Logic:**
    1.  **Request Interception:** Intercepts DNS resolution requests.
    2.  **Content Type Identification:**  Attempts to identify the content type requested, using URL analysis, request headers, or potentially application-layer inspection (though the latter is less desirable due to performance overhead).
    3.  **POP Weight Calculation:** Based on the identified content type, the DRMM queries the CSS for the current cache hit ratios of each POP. It calculates a 'weight' for each POP based on this ratio. Higher hit ratio = higher weight.  A formula could be:  `Weight = (HitRatio * α) + (HistoricalDemand * β)`.  α and β are tunable parameters to balance real-time performance vs. historical demand.
    4.  **Weighted Randomization:** Instead of returning a single IP address for the requested domain, the DRMM returns a *weighted random* selection of IP addresses from the available POPs. POPs with higher weights have a greater probability of being selected.
    5.  **Adaptive Learning:** The DRMM should incorporate an adaptive learning component. Monitor the success rate (low latency, no errors) of resolutions directed to each POP and adjust the α and β parameters accordingly to optimize performance.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:**  Extensive logging of DNS resolution patterns, POP weights, and resolution success rates for analysis and optimization.
*   **API:** A management API for configuring the DRMM, adjusting parameters, and monitoring performance.

**Pseudocode (DRMM):**

```
function resolveDNS(request):
  contentType = identifyContentType(request)
  popData = getPopCacheData(contentType) // From CSS

  // Calculate weights for each POP
  for each pop in popData:
    weight = (pop.hitRatio * α) + (pop.historicalDemand * β)
    pop.weight = weight

  // Normalize weights
  totalWeight = sum(pop.weight for pop in popData)
  for pop in popData:
    pop.normalizedWeight = pop.weight / totalWeight

  // Weighted Random Selection
  randomNumber = random(0, 1)
  cumulativeWeight = 0
  for pop in popData:
    cumulativeWeight += pop.normalizedWeight
    if randomNumber <= cumulativeWeight:
      return pop.ipAddress // Return the selected POP's IP

  // Fallback (should rarely happen)
  return defaultPop.ipAddress
```

**Novelty:**  This system doesn't simply measure demand; it *proactively influences* it by steering traffic based on real-time content cache hit rates. This creates a feedback loop where frequently accessed content is served from POPs with high cache hit ratios, reducing load on other POPs and improving overall performance. It moves beyond capacity-independent demand *assessment* to capacity-independent demand *steering*.
