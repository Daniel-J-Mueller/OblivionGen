## Variable Geometry Propeller Rim

**Concept:** Enhance the circumferential propulsion system by introducing a propeller rim capable of dynamically altering its effective diameter and shape during operation. This addresses potential efficiency losses at varying speeds and altitudes, and allows for directional control beyond simple rotation speed adjustment.

**Specs:**

*   **Propeller Rim Construction:** Segmented, multi-part rim constructed from a lightweight, high-strength composite material (carbon fiber reinforced polymer). Each segment is independently actuated.
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Miniature linear actuators (piezoelectric or shape memory alloy) embedded within the rim segments.  Each actuator controls the radial extension/retraction of its corresponding segment.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller integrated with the propulsion system controller. This controller receives input data (UAV speed, altitude, desired thrust, flight direction) and calculates optimal rim segment positions.
*   **Segment Arrangement:**  Rim divided into 6-12 individually controllable segments. Segments overlap slightly for smooth aerodynamic performance.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Strain gauges embedded in each segment to monitor stress and prevent overextension.
    *   Miniature IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) integrated with each segment to track segment position and movement.
*   **Power Supply:** Dedicated power line from the UAV's power distribution system. May utilize energy harvesting (vibration/airflow) to reduce load.

**Operational Modes & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Cruise Mode:**  Segments extend to maximize diameter for efficient thrust at lower speeds.
    ```
    function CruiseMode(speed, altitude):
      diameter = base_diameter + (speed * altitude_factor)
      for each segment:
        segment.extend_to(diameter / num_segments)
    ```

2.  **High-Speed Mode:** Segments retract to reduce drag and improve responsiveness at higher speeds.
    ```
    function HighSpeedMode(speed):
      diameter = base_diameter - (speed * drag_factor)
      if diameter < min_diameter:
        diameter = min_diameter
      for each segment:
        segment.retract_to(diameter / num_segments)
    ```

3.  **Maneuvering Mode:** Asymmetric segment extension/retraction to induce yaw or roll control *without* relying solely on differential propeller speed.
    ```
    function ManeuverMode(yaw_angle, roll_angle):
      // Calculate desired segment extensions based on angles
      for each segment:
        if segment is on left side:
          segment.extend_to(base_diameter + (yaw_angle * segment_sensitivity))
        if segment is on right side:
          segment.retract_to(base_diameter - (yaw_angle * segment_sensitivity))
        if segment is on top side:
          segment.retract_to(base_diameter - (roll_angle * segment_sensitivity))
        if segment is on bottom side:
          segment.extend_to(base_diameter + (roll_angle * segment_sensitivity))
    ```

4.  **Emergency/Braking Mode:**  Rapid and complete retraction of all segments, significantly increasing drag for rapid deceleration.

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Aerodynamic profiling of segment surfaces is critical to minimize turbulence and maximize efficiency.
*   Redundancy in actuators is vital for safety.
*   Segment overlap needs careful engineering to prevent aerodynamic stalls.
*   Potential for incorporating flexible airfoil sections within the segments for even greater control.
*   Integration of a self-healing material within the composite structure to improve durability.
