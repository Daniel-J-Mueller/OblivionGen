## Component Behavior Prediction via Simulated Component Exhaustion

**Core Concept:** Extend dependency mapping beyond static analysis to *predict* component behavior under stress by artificially simulating component exhaustion or degradation. This allows proactive identification of cascading failures *before* they occur, and facilitates targeted resilience improvements.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Exhaustion Profiles:** Define configurable "exhaustion profiles" for each component. These profiles model various degradation states (e.g., reduced bandwidth, increased latency, complete failure). These profiles are not necessarily binary 'on' or 'off' states, but allow granular control of resource availability.

2.  **Simulated Load Injection:**  A system capable of injecting simulated load *specifically targeting* the defined exhaustion profiles. This system operates *concurrently* with the existing application and dependency mapping system.  The injection is designed to mirror real-world traffic patterns where feasible, ensuring accurate simulation.

3.  **Dependency Propagation Analysis:**  Upon activating an exhaustion profile for a given component, the system must automatically propagate the simulated degradation *through* the dependency map. This requires a dynamic analysis engine capable of recalculating dependencies based on the altered component state.

4.  **Behavioral Monitoring:**  Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) of dependent components *during* the simulated exhaustion.  KPIs include latency, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization.  Establish baseline values for comparison.

5.  **Anomaly Detection & Root Cause Analysis:** Implement an anomaly detection engine that flags deviations from baseline KPI values during the simulation. Correlate anomalies with the exhausted component and its dependents to identify potential cascading failure points.

6.  **Predictive Resilience Scoring:**  Assign a "Resilience Score" to each component based on its performance during simulated exhaustion scenarios. This score quantifies the component's ability to withstand degradation without causing significant impact on the system.  Scores are calculated based on the magnitude and duration of KPI deviations.

7.  **Automated Remediation Recommendations:** Based on the Resilience Scores and identified failure points, the system should provide automated remediation recommendations.  Recommendations could include:

    *   Load balancing adjustments
    *   Resource allocation increases
    *   Caching improvements
    *   Code refactoring suggestions

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function SimulateExhaustion(component, exhaustionProfile, simulationDuration):
  component.applyExhaustionProfile(exhaustionProfile)
  
  for each dependentComponent in component.getDependents():
    monitorKPIs(dependentComponent) 
  
  wait(simulationDuration)
  
  component.removeExhaustionProfile()
  
  analyzeKPIs(dependentComponents)
  generateResilienceScore(component)
  generateRemediationRecommendations()
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ExhaustionProfile`:  {`componentId`, `resourceLimit`, `latencyIncrease`, `errorRateIncrease`}
*   `DependencyMap`: Adjacency list storing component dependencies and associated dependency scores.
*   `KPI_Data`: Time-series data for each monitored KPI.
*   `ResilienceScore`: Numerical value representing component resilience.
