## DNS Request ‘Shadowing’ & Behavioral Profiling – Multi-Tiered Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Extend the DNS analysis beyond simply identifying statistically random domains or periodic requests. Implement a system that ‘shadows’ DNS request patterns *across* the network, creating behavioral profiles not just of individual hosts, but of emergent ‘groups’ of compromised systems exhibiting subtle, coordinated activity.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Collection & Network Graph Construction:**

*   **Full Packet Capture (Selective):** Deploy network taps/mirrors to capture DNS request/response packets. Focus on capturing key metadata: source IP, destination DNS server, queried domain, response IP(s), timestamps, packet size. *Do not* necessarily capture full packet payloads initially to minimize bandwidth/storage overhead.
*   **Behavioral Feature Extraction:** For each DNS request, extract the following features:
    *   Request Frequency (requests/time unit)
    *   Domain Length
    *   Entropy of Domain Name (measure of randomness)
    *   TTL (Time To Live) value of DNS response
    *   Response Packet Size
    *   Geographic Location of Resolving DNS Server (using geoIP lookup)
    *   Character distribution of domain name.
*   **Network Graph Construction:** Build a dynamic network graph where:
    *   Nodes represent host computers (identified by IP address).
    *   Edges represent correlated DNS request patterns (defined by feature similarity – see below).
    *   Edge weight represents the strength of correlation (based on a similarity metric – cosine similarity, Jaccard index – applied to the feature vectors).

**II. Correlation Engine & Group Identification:**

*   **Sliding Window Analysis:** Analyze DNS traffic within sliding time windows (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour).
*   **Feature Vectorization:** Convert extracted features into numerical feature vectors for each host within the window.
*   **Correlation Calculation:** Calculate the correlation between feature vectors of different hosts using a chosen similarity metric.
*   **Community Detection:** Apply a community detection algorithm (e.g., Louvain modularity, Leiden algorithm) to the network graph to identify tightly connected groups of hosts exhibiting similar DNS request behavior. These groups are considered ‘communities’.

**III. Anomaly Detection – Multi-Tiered Approach:**

*   **Tier 1: Individual Host Anomaly Detection:** Use existing methods (as described in the patent) to detect anomalous behavior in *individual* hosts (e.g., statistically random domains, periodic requests).
*   **Tier 2: Community-Level Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Establish a baseline profile for each community based on historical DNS request behavior (average request frequency, typical domains, TTL distribution, etc.).
    *   Detect deviations from the baseline for each community. For example, a sudden increase in request frequency, a shift towards new/unusual domains, or a change in TTL distribution could indicate a coordinated attack.
*   **Tier 3: Emergent Behavior Detection:**
    *   Monitor for the *formation* of new communities. Rapidly forming communities with unusual DNS request patterns could indicate a newly emerging botnet or a coordinated reconnaissance phase.
    *   Analyze the relationships *between* communities. Are different communities communicating with each other through shared DNS servers or similar domain names? This could reveal the command-and-control infrastructure.

**IV. System Architecture**

*   **Distributed Architecture:** Deploy the system as a distributed architecture with multiple ‘collector’ nodes capturing DNS traffic and ‘analyzer’ nodes performing the correlation and anomaly detection.
*   **Data Storage:** Utilize a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) to store DNS traffic data and system metrics.
*   **Alerting:** Generate alerts when anomalous behavior is detected, providing details about the affected hosts, communities, and the type of anomaly.

**Pseudocode (Community Detection):**

```
// For each time window:
For each Host in Network:
    Extract DNS features
    Create feature vector

// Calculate similarity matrix
similarity_matrix = CalculateSimilarity(feature_vectors)

// Apply Community Detection Algorithm (Louvain)
communities = Louvain(similarity_matrix)

// Analyze Communities
For each community in communities:
    Calculate community statistics (avg request frequency, domain entropy)
    Compare statistics to baseline
    If deviation > threshold:
        Generate Alert
```

This approach moves beyond individual host analysis to identify coordinated malicious activity. By focusing on community-level behavior, it can detect subtle attacks that would otherwise go unnoticed. It's designed to detect campaigns, not just indicators.
