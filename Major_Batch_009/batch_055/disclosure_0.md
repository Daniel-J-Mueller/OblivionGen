## Dynamic Character Relationship Mapping & Prediction

**Core Concept:** Extend character identity recognition to dynamically map relationships *between* characters across multiple works, and *predict* likely interactions or relationships in *new* or incomplete works. This goes beyond simply identifying *who* the characters are, and focuses on *how* they connect.

**Specs:**

1.  **Relationship Feature Extraction:**  Expand the text string analysis to identify relationship-indicating keywords & phrases (e.g., “loves,” “hates,” “allied with,” “betrayed,” “sibling of”).  Assign weights to these phrases based on context and strength of relationship implied.

2.  **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Build a knowledge graph where nodes represent characters and edges represent relationships. Edge weights reflect the strength of the relationship (derived from feature extraction & text analysis). This graph is constructed *across* multiple works (different editions, sequels, prequels, adaptations).

3.  **Relationship Propagation:** Implement an algorithm to propagate relationship information.  If Character A is known to be allied with Character B in Work 1, and Character B interacts with Character C in Work 2, increase the likelihood of a positive relationship between A & C.  This propagation is weighted based on the strength of existing relationships and proximity within the knowledge graph.

4.  **Incomplete Work Analysis:** Given an incomplete work (e.g., a draft manuscript, a screenplay outline), identify characters and their initial relationships. Leverage the existing knowledge graph to *predict* likely relationships that haven’t been explicitly stated.  Output a probability score for each potential relationship.

5.  **Predictive Visualization:** Develop a visualization tool that displays the character network, highlighting predicted relationships with varying levels of opacity based on probability.  Allow users to explore the network and adjust weights based on their knowledge of the work.

6. **Temporal Relationship Tracking:** Integrate time-series analysis to model how relationships evolve *within* a single work. Identify turning points, betrayals, alliances, and shifts in power dynamics. This will require the ability to parse narrative structure and track events chronologically.

**Pseudocode (Predict Relationship):**

```
function predict_relationship(character1, character2, knowledge_graph):
    # Calculate direct relationship score (if any)
    direct_score = knowledge_graph.get_edge_weight(character1, character2)

    # Calculate indirect relationship score
    neighbors1 = knowledge_graph.get_neighbors(character1)
    neighbors2 = knowledge_graph.get_neighbors(character2)

    common_neighbors = neighbors1.intersection(neighbors2)

    indirect_score = 0
    for neighbor in common_neighbors:
        indirect_score += knowledge_graph.get_edge_weight(character1, neighbor) + knowledge_graph.get_edge_weight(character2, neighbor)

    # Combine scores (weighted)
    total_score = (0.7 * direct_score) + (0.3 * indirect_score)

    # Normalize score (0-1)
    probability = sigmoid(total_score)

    return probability
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large corpus of written works (books, scripts, etc.)
*   Relationship keyword/phrase dictionary with associated weights
*   NLP models for entity recognition, relationship extraction, and sentiment analysis.
