## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Echo Mapping

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond sound *source* localization to full acoustic scene reconstruction by modeling and visualizing sound reflections as a “temporal echo map.” This map isn’t just about *where* sounds bounce, but *when* they arrive relative to the direct sound, creating a dynamic, layered auditory landscape.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Microphone Array:** Utilize a dense, spherical microphone array (minimum 64 microphones) to capture a complete sound field.  Placement is critical – a sphere maximizes spatial coverage and minimizes shadowing effects.
2.  **Time-Frequency Analysis:** Implement a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on each microphone signal. This provides time-frequency representation for precise analysis of individual sound components.
3.  **Generalized Cross Correlation - Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT):**  Employ GCC-PHAT to estimate Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) between microphone pairs.  PHAT weighting minimizes the impact of noise and reverberation on TDOA estimates.  Refine with MUSIC algorithm to resolve multiple sources and reflections.
4.  **Temporal Echo Map Generation:** 
    *   **Ray Tracing Integration:** Integrate a simplified ray tracing engine.  The engine will use a pre-defined virtual environment map (user-defined or automatically generated from visual sensors) to simulate sound propagation paths.  Ray tracing provides *a priori* knowledge of potential reflection points.
    *   **Correlation-Ray Fusion:**  Correlate the GCC-PHAT-derived TDOA estimates with the ray tracing predictions. This fusion process refines the accuracy of reflection point identification, and mitigates errors from complex room geometry. 
    *   **Echo Layering:** Create a layered visualization.  Each layer represents a specific time delay from the direct sound arrival.  For example, layer 1 shows reflections arriving within 50ms, layer 2 within 100ms, and so on. The intensity of each reflection point in a layer corresponds to the strength of the reflected signal. This results in a dynamic map showcasing the temporal distribution of echoes.
5.  **Perceptual Audio Rendering:**
    *   **Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) Integration:** Apply HRTFs to the reconstructed sound field to create a 3D auditory experience. This spatialization accurately positions sound sources and reflections in the virtual environment.
    *   **Acoustic Material Modeling:**  Assign acoustic properties (absorption, reflection coefficients) to objects in the virtual environment. This allows for realistic simulation of sound behavior in different materials.
6.  **Real-time Processing Pipeline:** Optimize the processing pipeline for real-time performance using parallel processing and GPU acceleration. This enables interactive exploration of the reconstructed acoustic scenes.

**Pseudocode (Echo Map Generation):**

```
// Input: Microphone signals, Virtual Environment Map
// Output: Temporal Echo Map

For each time frame:
    1. Perform STFT on each microphone signal.
    2. Calculate GCC-PHAT between all microphone pairs.
    3. Estimate TDOA from GCC-PHAT results.
    4. Run Ray Tracing on the Virtual Environment Map for each identified sound source.
    5. For each ray:
        a. Calculate the expected TDOA based on ray path length.
        b. Correlate calculated TDOA with TDOA from GCC-PHAT.
        c. If correlation exceeds threshold:
            i. Mark the ray's intersection point as a reflection point.
            ii. Determine the time delay of the reflection.
            iii. Add the reflection point to the appropriate layer in the Temporal Echo Map, weighted by correlation strength.
    6. Output the Temporal Echo Map.
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Audio Conferencing:** Virtual acoustic environments can reduce echo and improve clarity.
*   **Immersive Gaming and VR:**  Realistic spatial audio creates a more engaging experience.
*   **Acoustic Scene Understanding:**  AI agents can 'see' the acoustic environment and react accordingly.
*   **Architectural Acoustics Design:**  Visualize sound propagation patterns in virtual building models.
