## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Object Recognition & Manipulation

**Concept:** Enhance the motion-based selection described in the patent with localized haptic feedback, creating a system where users 'feel' selectable elements without direct visual confirmation, and manipulate them with subtle movements. This moves beyond simple selection to intuitive object interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integrated haptic array layered beneath the display surface. Resolution: 50 haptic points per square inch. Each point capable of variable force (0-500mN) and texture simulation (using micro-vibrations).
    *   High-precision inertial measurement unit (IMU) within the device to track orientation and velocity with <1° accuracy.
    *   Depth sensor (ToF or structured light) for basic scene understanding. Range: 0.1-2 meters.
    *   Optional: Miniature air jets for directional airflow simulating object texture or providing 'pushback' during interaction.
*   **Software – Core Functionality:**
    1.  **Object & Element Mapping:** The system first scans the scene with the depth sensor and creates a basic representation.  Based on the system's active context (application, mode), it identifies potential selectable elements (buttons, icons, objects).
    2.  **Haptic Profile Generation:**  Each selectable element is assigned a unique haptic profile. This profile defines:
        *   *Shape:* The pattern of activated haptic points that corresponds to the element's visual shape.
        *   *Texture:* Simulated surface roughness (e.g., smooth, bumpy, ridged) using varying vibration frequencies and amplitudes.
        *   *Force:* The intensity of the haptic feedback.
        *   *Edge Definition:*  Sharp or diffuse edges of the haptic feedback.
    3.  **Motion-Haptic Linkage:** The core integration with the existing patent.
        *   As the device is tilted or moved, the system tracks the relative orientation between the device and the selectable elements.
        *   When the device's orientation aligns with a selectable element (within a defined tolerance), the corresponding haptic profile is activated on the display, giving the user a localized 'feel' for that element.
        *   The intensity of the haptic feedback scales with the degree of alignment. Perfect alignment = maximum feedback.
        *   Rate of change of orientation modulates haptic response. Faster movements = more pronounced feedback, aiding rapid selection.
    4.  **Haptic Manipulation:** Extend selection to manipulation.
        *   Once an element is 'felt' (aligned and activated), continued subtle movements (tilting, rotating) control its function.
        *   Example: ‘Feeling’ a volume slider. Tilting the device right increases volume, left decreases, haptic feedback increasing with volume level.
        *   Haptic constraints: Limit the range of motion for specific elements. (e.g. slider cannot go beyond endpoints.)
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    image_data = capture_image();
    orientation = get_orientation();
    elements = detect_selectable_elements(image_data);

    for (element in elements) {
        alignment_score = calculate_alignment_score(orientation, element);
        if (alignment_score > threshold) {
            haptic_profile = get_haptic_profile(element);
            activate_haptic_feedback(haptic_profile, alignment_score);
        } else {
            deactivate_haptic_feedback(element);
        }
    }

    if (user_action detected){
        perform_action(selected_element, action_type);
    }
}

function calculate_alignment_score(orientation, element) {
  //Calculate angle between device orientation and element direction
  angle_difference = abs(orientation.angle - element.angle);
  //Scale score based on angle difference and proximity
  score = 1 - (angle_difference / max_angle) + (proximity_score / max_proximity);
  return score;
}
```

*   **Modes:**
    *   **Discovery Mode:** Subtle haptic pulses indicate the presence of selectable elements as the device is moved.
    *   **Precision Mode:** Strong, localized haptic feedback for accurate selection.
    *   **Manipulation Mode:** Continuous haptic feedback providing real-time feedback on manipulation actions.
