## Contextual Media Tagging & Predictive Querying

**Concept:** Expand the system's awareness of user context beyond immediate media output, incorporating predictive modeling of likely queries *before* they are voiced. This shifts the system from reactive to proactive assistance.

**Specs:**

1.  **Persistent Context Profile:** 
    *   Maintain a user profile storing historical context data: time of day, location (coarse & fine), activity (inferred from sensors - movement, light levels), frequently accessed apps, recently played media, calendar events.
    *   Store “context tags” derived from these data points. Examples: “Morning Commute”, “Working From Home”, “Cooking Dinner”, “Watching Sports”.
    *   Context tags should have associated probabilities, reflecting the user's historical behavior.

2.  **Predictive Query Engine:**
    *   A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on user query history, paired with the persistent context profile.
    *   Input: Current context tags (and probabilities), recent query history.
    *   Output: Ranked list of likely user queries (e.g., "What's the traffic like?", "Play jazz music", "Set a timer for 20 minutes").
    *   The RNN should be updated continuously with new user interactions.

3.  **Ambient UI Integration:**
    *   A non-intrusive UI element (e.g., a subtle display on a smart speaker, a contextual suggestion within an app) presenting the top 3-5 predicted queries.
    *   Users can select a query via voice or touch.
    *   The system learns from user selections (and rejections) to refine its predictions.

4.  **Sensor Fusion & Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Integrate data from a wider range of sensors (e.g., smart home devices, wearable sensors) to enrich the context profile.
    *   Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual situations that might trigger specific queries. For instance:
        *   Smoke detector activation -> Suggest "Call emergency services?"
        *   Sudden change in heart rate (from wearable) -> Suggest "Are you feeling okay?"

5.  **Multi-Modal Input Integration:**
    *   Combine predicted queries with current audio input.
    *   If the user begins speaking, the system should prioritize parsing the spoken query, but *also* consider whether it matches one of the predicted queries. This allows for more accurate speech recognition and faster query resolution.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Query Engine):**

```python
def predict_queries(user_profile, current_context_tags):
  # Input: user_profile (historical data), current_context_tags (list of tags + probabilities)
  
  # 1. Feature Engineering: Combine user profile and context tags into a feature vector
  features = combine_features(user_profile, current_context_tags)
  
  # 2. RNN Forward Pass:  Predict query probabilities using the trained RNN
  query_probabilities = rnn.forward(features)
  
  # 3. Ranking: Sort queries by predicted probability
  ranked_queries = sort_queries_by_probability(query_probabilities)
  
  # 4. Return Top N Queries
  return ranked_queries[:5] # Return top 5 queries
```

This system shifts the focus from simply *responding* to queries to *anticipating* them, creating a more seamless and intuitive user experience. It leverages the power of machine learning to build a personalized understanding of user needs and proactively offer assistance.
