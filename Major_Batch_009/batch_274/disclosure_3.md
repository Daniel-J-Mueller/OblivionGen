## Dynamic Tag Chaining & Predictive Action Execution

**Concept:** Extend the "active tag" functionality to allow users to chain tags together, creating complex, automated workflows. Furthermore, introduce a predictive element where the system *suggests* potential tag chains based on user context and historical behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Tag Chain Definition:**

*   **Data Structure:** A “Chain Definition” object will be introduced. This object contains:
    *   `ChainID`: Unique identifier for the chain.
    *   `Tags`: Ordered list of `TagID`s. (The order is crucial).
    *   `ConditionalLogic`:  (Optional) Boolean expression evaluated *between* tag executions within the chain.  If `FALSE`, chain execution halts.
    *   `ChainOwner`: User who created the chain.
    *   `ChainPermissions`: Defines which users can view/modify the chain.
*   **UI Component:** "Chain Builder" – a visual interface allowing users to:
    *   Drag-and-drop existing tags into a chain.
    *   Define conditional logic (using a simplified expression editor).
    *   Name and save the chain.
    *   Set permissions.

**2. Predictive Chain Suggestion:**

*   **User Context Gathering:** System monitors:
    *   Current application/document/website being used.
    *   User's role/permissions.
    *   Time of day/day of week.
    *   Recent tag/chain executions.
*   **Chain Recommendation Engine:**
    *   Algorithm:  Utilize a collaborative filtering approach.  Identify users with similar profiles and behaviors. Recommend chains frequently used by those users in the current context.  Also incorporate content-based filtering—recommend chains whose tags relate to the current content.
    *   Recommendation Display:  A “Suggested Chains” panel will appear in the UI.  Chains will be ranked by predicted relevance.
    *   “Learn from User” Feedback:  Users can explicitly “Accept” or “Reject” recommendations. This data is used to refine the recommendation engine.

**3. Execution Flow:**

1.  User initiates a chain (either a saved chain or a recommended chain).
2.  System executes tags sequentially, according to the chain definition.
3.  Between each tag execution, the `ConditionalLogic` is evaluated. If `FALSE`, execution stops.
4.  Logging:  All tag executions within a chain are logged for auditing and debugging.
5.  Error Handling: If a tag fails, the chain execution stops. User is notified. Option to retry only the failed tag or abort the entire chain.

**Pseudocode (Chain Execution):**

```
function ExecuteChain(ChainID, UserContext):
  ChainDefinition = GetChainDefinition(ChainID)
  for each TagID in ChainDefinition.Tags:
    if EvaluateCondition(ChainDefinition.ConditionalLogic, UserContext) == FALSE:
      Log("Condition failed, chain halted")
      return
    TagResult = ExecuteTag(TagID, UserContext)
    if TagResult.Error:
      Log("Tag failed: " + TagResult.ErrorMessage)
      return TagResult //Return error to caller
    Log("Tag executed successfully")
  Log("Chain executed successfully")
  return Success
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Chain Versioning:** Allow users to create and manage different versions of chains.
*   **Chain Marketplace:** Enable users to share and sell chains to other users.
*   **AI-Powered Chain Creation:**  Allow users to describe a desired workflow in natural language. The system automatically generates a chain.
