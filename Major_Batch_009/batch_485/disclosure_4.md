**Localized Credential Federation with Dynamic Trust Scoring**

**Concept:** Expand the idea of geographically distributed credentials to incorporate a dynamic trust scoring system. Instead of simply verifying credentials against a directory, introduce a localized ‘trust score’ for each user based on behavioral biometrics, device health, network characteristics, and contextual data (time of access, location consistency). This trust score influences authentication strength and access privileges *within* that geographic region.

**Specs:**

1.  **Trust Score Engine:**
    *   Input: User behavioral data (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling patterns), Device health (OS integrity, installed software, jailbreak/root detection), Network characteristics (IP reputation, geolocation consistency), Contextual data (time of access, location consistency relative to user profile, access patterns).
    *   Processing: Machine learning model trained to identify anomalous behavior.  Assign a numerical trust score (0-100) based on weighted factors.
    *   Output: Dynamic trust score updated in real-time.

2.  **Geo-Fenced Trust Zones:**
    *   Define geographic regions (e.g., using geofencing APIs) corresponding to credential directories.
    *   Each zone maintains a localized instance of the Trust Score Engine.
    *   Trust scores are calculated and stored *within* the zone, improving privacy and reducing latency.

3.  **Adaptive Authentication:**
    *   Authentication flow adapts based on trust score and risk level.
    *   High Trust Score (e.g., 80-100):  Silent authentication/session resumption. Minimal user interaction.
    *   Medium Trust Score (e.g., 50-79):  Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with preferred methods (e.g., push notification).
    *   Low Trust Score (e.g., 0-49):  Strong MFA (e.g., biometric authentication, hardware security key), or access denial.

4.  **Federated Trust Propagation:**
    *   If a user accesses a resource in a *different* zone, the originating zone’s trust score is *propagated* (with appropriate security measures) to the destination zone.
    *   The destination zone *combines* the propagated score with its own localized assessment to determine the final authentication strength.  This mitigates risks of account takeover in unfamiliar locations.
    *   Trust scores should decay over time to prevent stale trust assessments.

5.  **API Integration:**
    *   `TrustScoreAPI`:  Provides endpoints for obtaining user trust scores, updating behavioral data, and querying trust policies.
    *   `GeoFenceAPI`:  Defines and manages geographic zones.
    *   `AuthenticationAPI`:  Integrates with existing authentication systems to incorporate adaptive authentication logic.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Authentication Flow):**

```
function authenticateUser(userId, location):
  zone = determineZone(location)
  trustScore = zone.getTrustScore(userId)

  if trustScore >= 80:
    // Silent authentication
    establishSession(userId)
    return success

  else if trustScore >= 50:
    // MFA with preferred method
    mfaResult = performMFA(userId, preferredMethod)
    if mfaResult == success:
      establishSession(userId)
      return success
    else:
      return failure

  else:
    // Strong MFA
    mfaResult = performStrongMFA(userId)
    if mfaResult == success:
      establishSession(userId)
      return success
    else:
      return failure
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserTrustScore`:  { userId: string, trustScore: int, lastUpdated: timestamp, behavioralData: array }
*   `GeoZone`: { zoneId: string, geoCoordinates: array, trustEngine: instance }
