## Adaptive Granularity Compression & Selective Encryption

**Concept:** Expand upon the selective encryption idea, but instead of a fixed fraction, dynamically adjust the granularity of compression *and* encryption based on content analysis *during* the compression process. This creates layers of compression – some heavily compressed/encrypted, some lightly, offering tunable trade-offs between size, security, and processing cost on the client side.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Analyzer Module:**  Integrated into the compression pipeline.  Analyzes strings *before* they are added to the compression dictionary or replaced with pointers.  Categorizes strings based on:
    *   **Entropy:** Measure of randomness. High entropy = likely important/sensitive data.
    *   **Frequency:** How often the string appears in the document. Low frequency = potentially unique/important.
    *   **Semantic Type:** (Requires NLP integration - optional) Identifies if the string is a name, address, date, financial term, etc.
*   **Granularity Levels:** Define compression/encryption ‘layers’.  Example:
    *   **Level 0 (Uncompressed/Unencrypted):** Common words, boilerplate text.
    *   **Level 1 (Light Compression/No Encryption):**  Frequent, non-sensitive phrases.
    *   **Level 2 (Medium Compression/Partial Encryption):**  Less frequent phrases, potentially identifiable information.
    *   **Level 3 (Heavy Compression/Full Encryption):**  Unique phrases, sensitive data (names, addresses, financial details).
*   **Dynamic Assignment:**  Based on the Content Analyzer’s output, each string is assigned to a granularity level.
*   **Dictionary Management:**  The compression dictionary is segmented based on granularity levels.  Higher granularity levels have smaller, more specialized dictionaries.
*   **Encryption Keying:**  Keys for encryption are derived from a master key and the string's hash. This ensures uniqueness while still allowing for decryption with the correct master key.
*   **Transmission Protocol:**  Transmitted data includes:
    *   Master Encryption Key (encrypted with a public key of the client)
    *   Granularity Map:  Indicates the assigned granularity level for each segment of the compressed data.
    *   Compressed Data Segments: Divided based on granularity levels.

**Pseudocode (Compression):**

```
function compress_digital_work(digital_work, master_key):
    granularity_map = []
    compressed_data = []

    for each string in digital_work:
        entropy = calculate_entropy(string)
        frequency = calculate_frequency(string, digital_work)
        semantic_type = identify_semantic_type(string)

        granularity_level = determine_granularity_level(entropy, frequency, semantic_type)

        if granularity_level == 0:
            # No compression/encryption
            compressed_string = string
        elif granularity_level == 1:
            # Light compression, no encryption
            compressed_string = compress_light(string)
        elif granularity_level == 2:
            # Medium Compression, partial encryption
            compressed_string = compress_medium(string)
            encrypted_string = encrypt_partial(compressed_string, generate_key(string))
        elif granularity_level == 3:
            # Heavy compression, full encryption
            compressed_string = compress_heavy(string)
            encrypted_string = encrypt_full(compressed_string, generate_key(string))

        granularity_map.append(granularity_level)
        compressed_data.append(compressed_string)

    return master_key, granularity_map, compressed_data
```

**Pseudocode (Decompression):**

```
function decompress_digital_work(master_key, granularity_map, compressed_data):
    decompressed_data = []
    for i in range(len(compressed_data)):
        granularity_level = granularity_map[i]
        if granularity_level == 0:
            decompressed_string = compressed_data[i]
        elif granularity_level == 1:
            decompressed_string = decompress_light(compressed_data[i])
        elif granularity_level == 2:
            encrypted_string = compressed_data[i]
            decompressed_string = decrypt_partial(encrypted_string, generate_key(string))
            decompressed_string = decompress_medium(decompressed_string)
        elif granularity_level == 3:
            encrypted_string = compressed_data[i]
            decompressed_string = decrypt_full(encrypted_string, generate_key(string))
            decompressed_string = decompress_heavy(decompressed_string)

        decompressed_data.append(decompressed_string)

    return decompressed_data
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Tunable Security:** Granularity can be adjusted based on the sensitivity of the content.
*   **Optimized Bandwidth:** Less sensitive content can be compressed more aggressively, reducing bandwidth usage.
*   **Client-Side Control:** Clients can request different levels of granularity to trade-off security and performance.
*   **Adaptive to Content:** Dynamic allocation of compression/encryption levels based on content characteristics.
