## Dynamic Resource Shadowing & Predictive Compliance

**Concept:** Extend the configuration monitoring to create “resource shadows” – lightweight, constantly updated replicas of resource configurations – and leverage these for predictive compliance checks *before* changes are applied.  This moves beyond reactive compliance to proactive prevention.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Creation & Maintenance:**

*   **Process:** Upon resource creation/modification, a shadow configuration is instantiated. This shadow is *not* a functional replica, but a data structure holding the current configuration state.
*   **Data Structure:**  JSON-based configuration object.  Includes:
    *   Resource ID
    *   Configuration Parameters (key-value pairs)
    *   Timestamp of Last Update
    *   Dependency List (resources this resource relies on)
*   **Synchronization:**  Configuration changes are mirrored to the shadow *before* being applied to the live resource.  Utilize a transactional queue to ensure consistency.  If applying the change to the live resource fails, the shadow is rolled back.
*   **Granularity:** Shadow updates are incremental, reflecting only the changed parameters.

**2. Predictive Compliance Engine:**

*   **Rule Application:**  Compliance rules are applied to the *shadow* configuration. This allows for assessment *before* the change impacts the live environment.
*   **"What-If" Analysis:**  Engine supports "what-if" scenarios.  Engine can simulate configuration changes and evaluate their impact on compliance *before* implementation.  Simulations can be scheduled and initiated from a user interface.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Before applying a change, the engine analyzes the dependency list of the affected resource.  It propagates the proposed changes to the shadows of dependent resources and re-evaluates compliance across the entire dependency chain.
*   **Compliance Scoring:**  Assign a numerical compliance score to each resource and dependency chain.  Thresholds can trigger alerts or prevent changes from being applied.

**3. Action Automation:**

*   **Preemptive Blocking:** If a change violates compliance rules during the shadow evaluation, the change is automatically blocked, and an alert is generated.
*   **Automated Remediation:** If a change causes a minor compliance violation, the engine can attempt automated remediation.  This could involve reverting the change or applying a compensating configuration.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If an automated remediation fails, the system automatically rolls back the change to the previous known-compliant configuration.
*   **Approval Workflow:** For changes that require manual approval, the system automatically creates a ticket with detailed information about the proposed change, the compliance impact, and recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Compliance Check):**

```
FUNCTION CheckCompliance(resourceID, proposedChanges):
  // 1. Create a shadow copy of the current configuration
  shadowConfig = CreateShadowCopy(resourceID)

  // 2. Apply proposed changes to the shadow configuration
  shadowConfig = ApplyChanges(shadowConfig, proposedChanges)

  // 3. Analyze dependencies
  dependencies = GetDependencies(resourceID)
  FOR each dependency IN dependencies:
    dependencyShadow = CreateShadowCopy(dependency)
    dependencyShadow = ApplyChanges(dependencyShadow, proposedChanges)

  // 4. Evaluate compliance rules against shadow configuration
  complianceScore = EvaluateComplianceRules(shadowConfig)
  dependencyComplianceScore = EvaluateComplianceRules(dependencyShadow)

  // 5. Check compliance score against threshold
  IF complianceScore < complianceThreshold:
    // Violation detected
    BlockChange()
    GenerateAlert(resourceID, "Compliance Violation")
    Return FALSE

  // 6. Change approved
  Return TRUE
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Distributed Data Store (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB) to store resource shadows.
*   Message Queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication.
*   Rules Engine (e.g., Drools, Jess) to evaluate compliance rules.
*   API Gateway for external access.
*   Monitoring and Alerting System (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
