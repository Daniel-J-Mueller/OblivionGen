## Dynamic Content Re-Composition via Multi-Spectral Input

**Concept:** Expand the content view control beyond simple zoom/tilt by allowing dynamic re-composition of displayed content based on multiple spectral inputs (e.g., visible light, infrared, ultraviolet) detected by integrated sensors. This enables “seeing” beyond the visible spectrum, or highlighting specific elements within content based on their spectral signature.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Multi-Spectral Sensor Array:** Integrate a sensor array capable of capturing data across at least three spectral bands: Visible Light (standard RGB), Near-Infrared (NIR), and Ultraviolet (UV). Sensor resolution should match or exceed display resolution.
*   **Real-time Processing Unit:** A dedicated processing unit (FPGA or similar) for real-time analysis of spectral data.  Must be capable of performing band analysis, feature extraction, and data fusion.
*   **Display with Spectral Filtering:** Display capable of dynamically adjusting spectral filtering.  This allows for presentation of data from different spectral bands, or for highlighting specific spectral signatures.  Consider micro-lens array technology for spectral control at pixel level.
*   **Calibration System:** An automated calibration system to ensure accurate spectral data acquisition and processing. This should include built-in self-calibration routines.
*   **Ambient Light Sensor:**  A high-dynamic-range ambient light sensor to compensate for external lighting conditions.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Spectral Data Acquisition Module:** Responsible for acquiring and pre-processing data from the multi-spectral sensor array. Includes noise reduction, calibration, and data normalization.
*   **Content Analysis Engine:**  Analyzes displayed content in each spectral band to identify features of interest. This could include edge detection, object recognition, material identification, and anomaly detection.  Utilize machine learning algorithms for feature extraction.
*   **Dynamic Re-Composition Algorithm:**  The core algorithm responsible for dynamically re-composing the displayed content based on spectral analysis. This algorithm should allow for the following:
    *   **Spectral Overlay:** Overlaying data from different spectral bands onto the visible image. For example, highlighting areas with high NIR reflectance.
    *   **Spectral Filtering:**  Displaying only specific spectral bands, or selectively filtering out certain wavelengths.
    *   **Pseudo-Colorization:**  Assigning different colors to different spectral signatures to make them more visible.
    *   **Content Augmentation:** Augmenting the displayed content with additional information based on spectral analysis (e.g., material properties, hidden features).
*   **User Interface (UI):** UI for controlling the spectral re-composition process. This should include options for:
    *   Selecting spectral bands
    *   Adjusting filtering parameters
    *   Choosing pseudo-colorization schemes
    *   Activating content augmentation features
    *   Saving and loading spectral profiles.
*   **Activation Method:** Similar to the double-tap activation described in the provided patent, but with an extended gesture (e.g. double tap and hold) to indicate spectral mode. This should seamlessly transition the display into spectral analysis/re-composition mode.
*    **Calibration Routine:** An automated calibration routine that the user can run to maintain sensor accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Re-Composition Algorithm):**

```
function recomposeContent(content, spectralData):
  // Analyze spectral data for features of interest
  features = analyzeSpectralData(spectralData)

  // Generate a recomposition mask based on features
  recompositionMask = generateMask(features)

  // Apply the mask to the original content
  recomposedContent = applyMask(content, recompositionMask)

  return recomposedContent
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Medical Imaging:** Enhancing medical images by highlighting specific tissues or anomalies based on their spectral signatures.
*   **Security and Surveillance:** Detecting hidden objects or materials based on their spectral properties.
*   **Art Authentication:** Authenticating artwork by analyzing the pigments and materials used.
*   **Industrial Inspection:** Detecting defects or flaws in materials based on their spectral signatures.
*   **Gaming/Entertainment:** Creating immersive gaming experiences by augmenting the visual content with spectral information.
