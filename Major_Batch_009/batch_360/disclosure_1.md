## Dynamic Meeting Room 'Mood' Adjustment System

**Concept:** Extend the meeting room reservation system to incorporate environmental control based on meeting *purpose* as indicated during reservation. This moves beyond simply booking a room with capacity – it proactively adjusts the room’s atmosphere to optimize for the *type* of meeting.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Inputs:**

*   **Meeting Purpose Categorization:** Reservation interface includes predefined categories (Brainstorming, Presentation, Focused Work, Interview, Training, Social/Team Building) *and* a free-text field for detailed description.  AI-driven semantic analysis of the free-text field assigns secondary categorization tags (e.g., "urgent", "creative", "formal").
*   **Room Sensor Data:** Real-time data streams from room sensors including:
    *   Ambient light levels.
    *   Temperature.
    *   Air quality (CO2, VOCs).
    *   Occupancy (precise headcount via camera/IR sensors).
    *   Noise levels.
*   **User Preference Profiles:** Individual user settings regarding ideal temperature, lighting, and noise preferences.  These are *overrides* to the default settings.
*   **Time of Day/External Conditions:**  Data feed for current time, date, and external weather conditions (sunlight intensity, cloud cover).

**2.  Environmental Control System:**

*   **Smart Lighting:**  Full spectrum, dimmable LED lighting system capable of dynamic color temperature and intensity adjustments. Preset lighting "moods" correspond to meeting purpose categories.
*   **HVAC Integration:** Control over temperature, airflow, and humidity.  Adjustments based on meeting purpose and occupancy.
*   **Sound Masking/Noise Cancellation:** Active noise cancellation and sound masking system to minimize distractions.  Adjustable levels based on meeting type (e.g., higher masking for brainstorming, lower for focused work).
*   **Aromatherapy Diffusion:**  Scent diffusion system with curated scent profiles for different meeting types (e.g., citrus for brainstorming, lavender for focused work). *Optional/Configurable*.
*   **Digital Canvas/Display Integration:**  Dynamic adjustment of display background colors/moods based on meeting purpose.  Subtle, ambient adjustments.

**3. Logic & Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION PrepareRoom(reservation_data) {
    //Extract meeting purpose and user preferences
    meeting_purpose = reservation_data.purpose;
    user_preferences = reservation_data.user_preferences;
    
    //Determine base settings based on meeting purpose
    IF meeting_purpose == "Brainstorming" {
        lighting_mode = "Bright, cool white";
        temperature = 22C;
        sound_masking = "Low";
        scent = "Citrus";
        display_background = "Vibrant blue";
    } ELSE IF meeting_purpose == "Presentation" {
        lighting_mode = "Dimmed, focused";
        temperature = 21C;
        sound_masking = "Medium";
        scent = "None";
        display_background = "Neutral grey";
    } ELSE IF meeting_purpose == "Focused Work" {
        lighting_mode = "Cool white, natural";
        temperature = 20C;
        sound_masking = "High";
        scent = "Lavender";
        display_background = "Calming green";
    } ELSE { //Default settings
        // ...
    }

    //Apply user overrides
    IF user_preferences.temperature != null {
        temperature = user_preferences.temperature;
    }

    //Adjust based on real-time data
    IF room.occupancy > 4 {
        temperature = temperature - 1; //Cooler for larger groups
    }

    //Send commands to room control system
    set_lighting(lighting_mode);
    set_temperature(temperature);
    set_sound_masking(sound_masking);
    set_scent(scent);
    set_display_background(display_background);
}

//Trigger function on reservation confirmation and 15 minutes prior to meeting start
ON reservation_confirmed(reservation_data) {
  PrepareRoom(reservation_data);
}
ON meeting_start_approaching(reservation_data) {
  PrepareRoom(reservation_data);
}
```

**4.  Learning & Adaptation:**

*   **Feedback Mechanism:**  Post-meeting survey asking participants to rate the room environment ("How conducive was the room environment to the meeting objectives?").
*   **Machine Learning Algorithm:**  Use feedback data to refine the default settings for each meeting purpose category.  The algorithm learns which environmental factors are most strongly correlated with positive feedback.
*   **Personalized Profiles:**  Over time, the system builds personalized environmental profiles for individual users, automatically adjusting the room environment based on their preferences and meeting context.
