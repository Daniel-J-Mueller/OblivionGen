## Mechanical Key Impression Resistance System

**Core Concept:** Integrate a dynamically shifting obstruction within the keyway, triggered by the act of key insertion and manipulation, to mechanically resist key impressioning attacks.

**System Components:**

*   **Keyway Core:** Standard pin tumbler keyway geometry.
*   **Shifting Element Array:** A series of small, hardened steel blocks or pins positioned within recessed channels along the length of the keyway (beyond the normal key insertion depth but accessible by an extended impressioning tool). These are *not* directly interacting with the pin tumblers.
*   **Key-Activated Cam:** A mechanically linked cam system activated by the initial insertion of a correctly cut key. The key’s bitting (cut pattern) engages with the cam, initiating a controlled shift in the position of the Shifting Element Array.
*   **Randomization Mechanism:** A spring-loaded ratchet or pawl system linked to the key's rotation. Each rotation cycles the ratchet, creating a slightly different configuration of the Shifting Element Array. This introduces a dynamic element, preventing a consistent impression pattern.
*   **Obstruction Profiles:** Each element in the Shifting Element Array has a unique profile – some flat, some angled, some with small ridges.

**Operation:**

1.  **Key Insertion:** A properly cut key initiates the Key-Activated Cam, beginning the shift of the Shifting Element Array.
2.  **Dynamic Obstruction:** As the key is turned, the Randomization Mechanism advances the ratchet, changing the position and orientation of the obstruction profiles within the keyway.
3.  **Impression Resistance:** An attempt to impression a key will encounter a constantly shifting series of obstructions. The attacker cannot establish a stable pattern to create a working impression because the obstruction layout changes with each key rotation.
4.  **Normal Operation:** A properly cut key can navigate the shifting obstructions due to its precise bitting, allowing normal lock operation.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation & Obstruction Shift):**

```
FUNCTION RotateKey(key, rotationAngle)
  IF key.isAuthorized() THEN
    RotateTumblers(key, rotationAngle) //Normal tumbler rotation
    IncrementRatchet()
    ShiftObstructions()
    RETURN SUCCESS
  ELSE
    RETURN FAILURE
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION IncrementRatchet()
  ratchetPosition = (ratchetPosition + 1) MOD numberOfRatchetPositions
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION ShiftObstructions()
  FOR each obstruction in obstructionArray
    obstruction.position = obstructionArray[ratchetPosition].position
  ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Materials:**

*   Hardened Tool Steel (Obstructions, Cam, Ratchet)
*   Stainless Steel (Keyway Core, Housing)

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Variable Obstruction Density:** Different sections of the keyway could have varying numbers of obstructions.
*   **Electromagnetic Variation:** Introduce small electromagnets to subtly alter the position of obstructions, adding another layer of complexity.
*   **Key-Specific Configuration:** A small chip embedded in the key could communicate with the lock to customize the obstruction pattern, increasing security.
