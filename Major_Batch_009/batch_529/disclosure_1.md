## Dynamic Contextual Item Graph Construction & Proactive Recommendation

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely relying on collaborative filtering *after* a search, proactively build a dynamic, multi-faceted item graph representing relationships beyond simple co-purchase or viewing history. This graph incorporates real-time contextual data and predicts potential user interests *before* a search is even initiated.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User activity (purchases, views, browse history) - existing.
    *   **Real-time Contextual Data:** Location (GPS, IP-based), Time of Day, Day of Week, Weather, Social Media Trends (hashtags, trending topics – anonymized), News Feeds (categorized – anonymized).
    *   **Item Metadata Enrichment:** Expand beyond basic attributes. Utilize external APIs for: Semantic similarity (using word embeddings/knowledge graphs), Visual similarity (image analysis), Style/Attribute Extraction (fashion, home goods), Functional Similarity (tools, electronics).
*   **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to store item and user nodes, with relationships representing various connections:
    *   `PURCHASED_BY` (user -> item)
    *   `VIEWED_BY` (user -> item)
    *   `CONTEXTUALLY_RELATED_TO` (item -> item – based on co-occurrence in specific contexts – e.g., “beach umbrella” & “sunscreen” during sunny weather at coastal locations)
    *   `SEMANTICALLY_SIMILAR_TO` (item -> item – based on word embeddings)
    *   `VISUALLY_SIMILAR_TO` (item -> item)
    *   `FUNCTIONALLY_SIMILAR_TO` (item -> item)

**2. Dynamic Relationship Weighting:**

*   Relationships aren’t static. Weights are assigned and dynamically adjusted based on:
    *   **Recency:** Recent interactions/contextual occurrences have higher weight.
    *   **Frequency:** More frequent occurrences increase weight.
    *   **Strength of Context:** Stronger contextual signals (e.g., precise location) increase weight.
    *   **User Personalization:** Weights are adjusted based on individual user preferences & historical behavior.
*   A decay function (exponential or similar) should be implemented to reduce the weight of older data.

**3. Predictive Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Proactive Interest Prediction:** Based on user’s current context (location, time, weather, etc.), the engine queries the item graph to identify items with strong connections to the current context.
*   **Multi-Hop Traversal:** Explore the graph beyond direct connections.  Identify items connected to items already linked to the user or current context.
*   **Personalized Ranking:** Rank potential recommendations based on:
    *   Combined weight of all relationships connecting the item to the user/context.
    *   User’s historical preferences.
    *   Item popularity.
*   **Recommendation Delivery:** Present recommendations through:
    *   Proactive notifications (opt-in).
    *   Personalized home screen carousels.
    *   Contextual search suggestions.

**4. Pseudocode (Recommendation Generation):**

```
function generateRecommendations(userID, location, time, weather) {

  // Get user's known preferences (purchases, views)
  userPreferences = getUserPreferences(userID)

  // Identify contextually relevant items
  contextuallyRelevantItems = findContextuallyRelevantItems(location, time, weather)

  // Build candidate item set
  candidateItems = new Set()
  candidateItems.addAll(userPreferences)
  candidateItems.addAll(contextuallyRelevantItems)

  // Expand candidate set (multi-hop traversal)
  for (item in candidateItems) {
    neighbors = getItemNeighbors(item) //get all items connected to 'item'
    candidateItems.addAll(neighbors)
  }

  // Calculate recommendation score for each candidate item
  scoredItems = []
  for (item in candidateItems) {
    score = calculateRecommendationScore(item, userID, scoredItems)
    scoredItems.add({item:item, score:score})
  }

  //Sort
  scoredItems.sort(descending by score)
  //Return Top N
  return scoredItems.slice(0, N)
}

function calculateRecommendationScore(item, userID, scoredItems) {
    score = 0
    //Add weight for user interaction
    if (user interacted with item) {
        score += interactionWeight
    }
    //Add weight for contextual relevance
    if (item is contextually relevant) {
        score += contextualWeight
    }

    //Add weight for item similarity
    for (connectedItem in getConnectedItems(item)) {
        score += similarityWeight * getSimilarityScore(item, connectedItem)
    }
    return score
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond reactive search refinement to proactive, context-aware recommendations. It creates a richer understanding of item relationships and user intent, leading to more personalized and serendipitous discovery.  The dynamic weighting system allows the model to adapt to changing contexts and user preferences in real-time.
