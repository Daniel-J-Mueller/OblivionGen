## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Multi-Modal Temporal Mapping

**Core Concept:** Extend the AEC/ANC system to not just *cancel* sound, but to *reconstruct* a localized acoustic scene for augmented reality or enhanced communication. The system will dynamically map temporal changes in the reconstructed scene, allowing for selective audio pass-through and manipulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of 4 microphones arranged in a tetrahedral configuration for 3D sound source localization. Add an optional fifth, omnidirectional microphone for ambient capture.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance DSP or dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) capable of real-time audio processing and matrix operations.
*   **Memory:** Minimum 8GB RAM for storing acoustic models, scene maps, and processing buffers.
*   **Acoustic Model Database:** Pre-trained models for common sound events (speech, music, vehicle noise, environmental sounds) and room impulse responses.
*   **Scene Mapping Module:**
    *   **Input:** Processed audio data from microphone array. Adaptive filter coefficients (from existing AEC/ANC) used as initial sound source estimations.
    *   **Process:** Implement a Bayesian filtering system that estimates the 3D location, size, and acoustic properties of sound sources in the environment. Utilize the adaptive filter coefficients to create a dynamic sound 'fingerprint', then map it in 3D space. Integrate data from the pre-trained acoustic model database.
    *   **Output:** A dynamic 3D map representing the reconstructed acoustic scene. The map must track changes in sound source location, size, and acoustic characteristics over time. Each sound event within the scene will be assigned a unique identifier.
*   **Temporal Mapping Module:**
    *   **Input:** Dynamic 3D acoustic scene map from the Scene Mapping Module.
    *   **Process:** Track the temporal evolution of each sound event in the 3D map. Identify patterns and predict future sound event locations. This is done by looking at the ‘velocity’ vector of each sound source. For example, a fast velocity vector will point towards someone walking.
    *   **Output:** A time-series representation of the acoustic scene. This could be visualized as a 'heat map' of sound activity over time and space.

*   **Audio Manipulation Module:**
    *   **Input:** Time-series representation of the acoustic scene and processed audio data.
    *   **Process:** Allow selective audio pass-through and manipulation based on the time-series map. For example:
        *   **Spatial Audio Enhancement:** Enhance the sound of specific sound sources by adjusting their volume and spatial location in the reconstructed scene.
        *   **Noise Reduction:** Suppress specific noise sources by reducing their volume or removing them from the reconstructed scene.
        *   **Acoustic Beamforming:** Create a virtual beam that focuses on a specific sound source.
        *   **Sound Event Triggering:** Trigger actions based on the detection of specific sound events (e.g., turn on a light when a voice command is detected).
    *   **Output:** Processed audio data with enhanced or manipulated sound.

**Pseudocode (Scene Mapping Module - Simplified):**

```
function create_acoustic_scene_map(audio_data, adaptive_filter_coeffs):
  sound_sources = []
  for each sound_event in audio_data:
    estimated_location = calculate_location(sound_event, adaptive_filter_coeffs) // Uses triangulation & AEC data
    acoustic_properties = analyze_acoustic_properties(sound_event) // Frequency, timbre, etc.
    sound_source = {
      location: estimated_location,
      properties: acoustic_properties,
      id: generate_unique_id()
    }
    sound_sources.append(sound_source)

  acoustic_scene_map = {
    timestamp: current_time(),
    sound_sources: sound_sources
  }

  return acoustic_scene_map
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Augmented Reality:** Overlaying virtual sounds onto the real world based on the reconstructed acoustic scene.
*   **Enhanced Communication:** Improving the clarity and intelligibility of speech in noisy environments.
*   **Smart Home Control:** Triggering actions based on the detection of specific sound events.
*   **Acoustic Monitoring:** Tracking the location and movement of sound sources in a specific environment.
