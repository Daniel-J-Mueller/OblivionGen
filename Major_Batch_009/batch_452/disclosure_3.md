## Dynamic Feature Isolation with Per-Application Sandboxing

**Specification:** A system allowing for the runtime isolation of features *within* an application, even if those features are sourced from different bundles or updates. This goes beyond the existing user/system partition and path variable modification.

**Core Concept:** Each application, upon launch, dynamically creates a set of sandboxed environments – “feature containers” – within the user partition. These containers are more granular than full application sandboxing. Each feature (or group of tightly coupled features) loaded by the application runs within its own container.

**Components:**

*   **Feature Manifest:** Each bundle/update includes a “feature manifest” detailing the features it provides, their dependencies, and the required resource access levels (file system, network, etc.).
*   **Container Orchestrator:** A system service responsible for creating, managing, and destroying feature containers. It uses virtualization or containerization technologies (e.g., lightweight VMs, Docker-like containers) to provide isolation.
*   **Inter-Container Communication (ICC) Proxy:** A secure proxy that mediates communication between feature containers. All communication must go through the proxy, which enforces access control policies defined in the feature manifest.
*   **Resource Virtualization Layer:**  Abstracts file system, network, and other resources, providing virtualized views to each container. This allows different containers to have different views of the same underlying resources.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Application Launch:**  The application loads and scans its bundled features, reading their feature manifests.
2.  **Container Request:** The application requests the Container Orchestrator to create containers for each required feature. The request includes the feature manifest and the required resource access levels.
3.  **Container Creation:** The Container Orchestrator creates the containers using the Resource Virtualization Layer and configures them according to the feature manifest.
4.  **Feature Loading:** The application loads the feature code into its assigned container.
5.  **Execution:** The feature executes within its container. All inter-feature and OS communication is routed through the ICC Proxy.
6.  **Container Destruction:** When a feature is no longer needed, the application requests the Container Orchestrator to destroy its container.

**Pseudocode (Container Orchestrator – simplified):**

```
function createContainer(featureManifest):
  containerID = generateUniqueID()
  virtualizedFileSystem = createVirtualizedFileSystem(featureManifest.requiredFileSystemAccess)
  virtualizedNetwork = createVirtualizedNetwork(featureManifest.requiredNetworkAccess)
  container = new Container(containerID, virtualizedFileSystem, virtualizedNetwork)
  container.loadFeature(featureManifest.featureCodePath)
  return containerID

function destroyContainer(containerID):
  container = getContainer(containerID)
  container.unloadFeature()
  container.destroy()
```

**Innovation:**

This system significantly enhances application security and stability.  If a feature crashes or becomes compromised, only its container is affected, preventing the entire application from failing. It also allows for dynamic updates and bug fixes to individual features without requiring a full application restart.  The granular isolation and ICC proxy provide a much stronger security boundary than traditional application sandboxing.  

This allows for A/B testing of features in production with minimal risk. If a new feature causes issues, it can be instantly isolated and rolled back without impacting other users. Further, this system enables the creation of “feature plugins” that can be dynamically loaded and unloaded without compromising the core application.
