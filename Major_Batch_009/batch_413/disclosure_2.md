## Dynamic Code Morphing via Predictive Branching and Register Remapping

**Concept:** Extend runtime code patching to proactively *morph* code based on predicted execution paths, optimizing for frequently taken branches *before* they are encountered. This goes beyond simple patching by anticipating needs and structurally altering code in memory, remapping registers to reduce stalls and simplify instructions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Program Counter (PC), instruction stream, branch history table (BHT), register usage analysis.
*   **Output:** Predicted branch target, optimal register allocation for the predicted path, morphing directives.
*   **Algorithm:** Combines branch prediction (BHT) with static and dynamic register usage analysis. The system profiles register usage along common execution paths and creates a ‘register affinity map’.  This map indicates which registers are most frequently used for certain data types or operations.

**2. Morphing Component:**

*   **Input:** Morphing directives, instruction stream, register affinity map.
*   **Output:** Modified instruction stream in memory.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Branch Optimization:** Replaces infrequent branches with unconditional jumps to optimized code blocks (generated during the morphing process).
    *   **Register Remapping:** Rewrites instructions to use registers identified in the register affinity map.  This may involve inserting move instructions to transfer data between registers.
    *   **Instruction Simplification:**  Identifies and replaces complex instruction sequences with simpler equivalents (e.g., replacing a division with a shift and subtract).
    *   **Code Duplication:** Duplicates code blocks (especially frequently executed loops) and applies optimizations to the copies.
    *   **Morphing Buffer:** A dedicated memory region to hold the morphed code.  The original code is preserved for fallback or unmorphing.

**3. Runtime System Integration:**

*   **Morphing Trigger:** Activated by a performance monitoring counter (PMC) exceeding a threshold, or by explicit signals from the application.
*   **PC Shadowing:**  The system maintains a shadow PC that points to the morphed code.
*   **Exception Handling:**  A mechanism to handle exceptions that occur in the morphed code.  The system must be able to revert to the original code if necessary.

**Pseudocode (Morphing Component):**

```
function morphCode(codeBlock, morphDirectives):
  morphedCodeBlock = copy(codeBlock)
  for each instruction in morphedCodeBlock:
    if instruction is a branch:
      if morphDirectives.optimizeBranch(instruction):
        replace instruction with optimized code
    for each operand in instruction:
      if operand is a register:
        targetRegister = morphDirectives.mapRegister(operand)
        if targetRegister != operand:
          insert move instruction to transfer data from operand to targetRegister
          replace operand with targetRegister
  return morphedCodeBlock

function installMorphedCode(morphedCodeBlock, originalCodeAddress):
  allocate memory for morphedCodeBlock
  copy morphedCodeBlock to allocated memory
  update PC shadow to point to allocated memory
  return allocated memory address
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Branch History Table (BHT):** Stores recent branch outcomes (taken/not taken).
*   **Register Affinity Map:**  Associates registers with data types and operations.
*   **Morphing Directives:**  A set of instructions that specify how the code should be morphed.

**Novelty:** This system differs from existing code patching techniques by being *proactive* rather than *reactive*. It doesn't just fix problems after they occur, it anticipates them and structurally alters code to prevent them. The combination of branch prediction, register remapping, and code duplication creates a dynamically optimized codebase that adapts to runtime conditions.  It is a 'self-altering' executable.
