## Dynamic Shard Affinity Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the key-based workload sharding to incorporate *user* or *application* profiles, dynamically adjusting shard affinity based on observed behavior, not just immediate load. This builds on the idea of reserving shards for keys, but applies it at a higher level of granularity.

**Specs:**

*   **Profile Creation:** A service collects telemetry data about user interactions (e.g., frequently accessed data, request patterns) or application behavior (e.g., data types, query complexity). This creates a “behavioral profile” for each user/application. Profiles are versioned and timestamped.
*   **Shard Affinity Mapping:**  Based on the profile, a mapping is created associating the user/application with a prioritized list of shards.  This isn’t a hard reservation, but a weighting towards those shards for initial request routing.  The weighting is a floating point value.
*   **Initial Routing with Weighted Randomization:** When a request arrives, the key-based sharding algorithm is *seeded* with the user/application profile’s shard prioritization.  Instead of a purely consistent hash, the algorithm incorporates a weighted random selection among the prioritized shards *before* applying the key hash.  Higher weight = higher probability of selection.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system monitors the performance of requests routed to different shards for a given user/application. If performance is consistently better on a particular shard (even *without* profile weighting), the profile’s prioritization is dynamically adjusted. This creates a positive feedback loop, refining affinity over time.
*   **Profile Expiration & Reset:** Profiles have a time-to-live (TTL).  Expired profiles can either be reset to a default distribution or rebuilt from recent telemetry. This ensures profiles don’t become stale.
*   **Shard “Temperature” Control:**  Introduce a “temperature” parameter to the weighted random selection.  Higher temperature = more randomness, exploring different shards. Lower temperature = more deterministic, sticking to highly-ranked shards.  This allows dynamic tuning between exploitation and exploration.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor deviation from expected behavior. Large shifts in request patterns or performance metrics can trigger profile rebuilds or temporary overrides.

**Pseudocode (Request Routing):**

```
function routeRequest(request):
  userProfile = getUserProfile(request.userId)
  if userProfile == null:
    shard = consistentHash(request.key)
    return shard

  prioritizedShards = userProfile.getPrioritizedShards()
  weights = prioritizedShards.getWeights()

  // Weighted Random Selection
  selectedShard = weightedRandomSelect(prioritizedShards, weights)

  //Fallback to consistent hash if weighted selection fails
  if selectedShard == null:
    selectedShard = consistentHash(request.key)

  return selectedShard
```

```
function weightedRandomSelect(shardList, weightList):
  totalWeight = sum(weightList)
  randomNumber = random() * totalWeight
  cumulativeWeight = 0
  for i in range(length(shardList)):
    cumulativeWeight += weightList[i]
    if randomNumber < cumulativeWeight:
      return shardList[i]
  return null //Should rarely happen due to floating point precision
```

**Infrastructure Implications:**

*   Telemetry Collection Service
*   Profile Database (key-value store)
*   Shard Weighting/Adjustment Service
*   Integration with existing key-based sharding algorithm.
