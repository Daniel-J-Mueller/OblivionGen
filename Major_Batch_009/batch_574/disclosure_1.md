## Automated Modular Data Center Power Grid with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Expand the bypass functionality into a fully automated, modular power grid within the data center, leveraging predictive analytics to proactively shift loads *before* failures occur, maximizing uptime and efficiency. The existing bypass tech is a reactive measure; this is preventative and dynamic.

**Core Components:**

*   **Smart Bypass Modules (SBMs):** Highly granular bypass units (smaller than currently implied in the patent) installed on *every* critical load circuit. These aren’t just for bypassing ATS, but for *dynamically rerouting* power within the load itself. Each SBM will have integrated current/voltage sensing and communication capabilities.
*   **Centralized Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE):** A software platform that collects real-time data from all SBMs, ATSs, environmental sensors (temperature, humidity), and historical data logs. Uses machine learning algorithms to predict potential power failures (ATS degradation, overloaded circuits, failing components) *before* they happen.
*   **Modular Power Distribution Units (MPDUs):**  Redundant, hot-swappable power distribution units with intelligent load balancing capabilities. These work in concert with the PAE and SBMs.
*   **Software-Defined Power Grid (SDPG):**  The overarching software architecture that manages the entire system, using APIs to control the SBMs, MPDUs, and ATSs.

**Operation:**

1.  **Data Collection:** The SDPG continuously monitors all data streams from the SBMs, MPDUs, ATSs, and environmental sensors.
2.  **Predictive Analysis:** The PAE analyzes this data, identifying potential failure points and overloaded circuits. For example, it might detect an ATS showing signs of degradation based on subtle voltage fluctuations and increased operating temperature.  It also predicts future load demands based on historical data and scheduled tasks.
3.  **Proactive Load Shifting:**  *Before* a failure occurs, the SDPG directs the SBMs to *gradually* shift load from the potentially failing ATS or overloaded circuit to a healthy ATS or underutilized circuit. This is done *before* any interruption of service.  The load shifting is dynamic and adjusts based on real-time conditions.  Think “micro-migration” of power.
4.  **Automated Maintenance:** The SDPG logs all events and generates alerts for maintenance personnel, indicating potential issues and recommending repairs.
5.  **Automated Failure Response:** In the event of an unexpected failure, the SBMs instantly isolate the failed component and reroute power to maintain service.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Load Shifting Logic):**

```
// Data Structures
struct LoadData {
    float current;
    float voltage;
    int atsId; // ID of the ATS supplying this load
    int circuitId; // ID of the circuit
};

// Function to shift load
function shiftLoad(LoadData load, int targetAtsId, float shiftAmount) {
    // Validate target ATS capacity
    if (targetAtsId.capacity > load.current + shiftAmount) {
        // Gradually reduce power to the original circuit
        reducePower(load.circuitId, shiftAmount);

        // Gradually increase power to the target circuit
        increasePower(load.circuitId, shiftAmount, targetAtsId);

        // Update load data
        load.atsId = targetAtsId;
    } else {
        // Log warning: target ATS is overloaded
    }
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
    // Get real-time load data
    loadData = getLoadData();

    // Predict potential failures
    potentialFailures = predictFailures(loadData);

    // For each potential failure
    for each (failure in potentialFailures) {
        // Shift load to a healthy ATS
        shiftLoad(failure.load, failure.targetAts, failure.shiftAmount);
    }
}
```

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **SBMs:** Compact, modular units with integrated current/voltage sensors, relays, and communication interfaces (e.g., Ethernet, Modbus).  High MTBF and MTTR.
*   **MPDUs:**  Redundant, hot-swappable units with intelligent load balancing algorithms and communication interfaces.
*   **PAE:**  High-performance server cluster with scalable storage and processing capabilities.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple bypass functionality by creating a *proactive*, *self-healing* power grid that anticipates and prevents failures *before* they happen.  The integration of predictive analytics and automated load shifting is a significant advancement over existing solutions. It addresses the challenge of maintaining uptime in increasingly complex and demanding data center environments.
