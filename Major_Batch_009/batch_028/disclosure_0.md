## Dynamic Hash Tree Sharding with Ephemeral Roots

**Concept:** Extend the core hash tree concept to enable dynamic sharding of signature authority and facilitate ephemeral, short-lived signature validity windows. This moves beyond a static hierarchical structure to a system where portions of the hash tree can be created, used, and discarded rapidly, improving scalability and security.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shard Creation Module:**

*   **Input:** A base public key (root node of an existing hash tree or a newly generated key pair). A 'Shard Lifetime' parameter (in seconds/minutes/hours).  A 'Shard Capacity' parameter (maximum number of subordinate public keys the shard can hold).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Generate a new, temporary public/private key pair for the shard.
    2.  Create a new hash tree with the shard's public key as the root.
    3.  Record the shard's public key, lifetime, capacity, and parent (if applicable) in a distributed ledger (blockchain-based preferred).
    4.  Return the shard's public key to the requesting entity.
*   **Output:** Shard Public Key.

**2. Shard Population Module:**

*   **Input:** Shard Public Key, Subordinate Public Key(s).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Locate the shard in the distributed ledger.
    2.  If the shard is within its lifetime and capacity:
        1.  Add the subordinate public key to the shard's hash tree as a leaf node.
        2.  Update the hash tree structure.
        3.  Record the association between the shard and the subordinate in the distributed ledger.
    3.  If the shard is expired or at capacity, reject the addition.
*   **Output:** Success/Failure indicator.

**3. Signature Validation Module:**

*   **Input:** Digital Signature, Message, Validator Public Key (Organizational Root Public Key).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Traverse the hash tree structure from the Validator Public Key (root).
    2.  Determine the path from the signing entity's public key to the root.
    3.  Verify the signature using the path and the corresponding hash values.
    4.  Check if the shard containing the signing entity's public key is still within its lifetime.
*   **Output:** Valid/Invalid indicator.

**4. Shard Expiration Module:**

*   **Process:** (Runs periodically as a background task)
    1.  Scan the distributed ledger for expired shards.
    2.  Remove expired shards from the ledger.
    3.  Invalidate any signatures relying on the expired shard.
    4.  Archive shard data for audit purposes.

**Pseudocode (Signature Validation):**

```
function validateSignature(signature, message, validatorPublicKey):
  path = getPathToRoot(signingEntityPublicKey, validatorPublicKey) // find the hashes from the leaf to the root
  if path == null:
    return Invalid //signing key not found
  if shardIsExpired(path):
    return Invalid //signature is based on an expired shard

  //verify signature using the path and validatorPublicKey
  if verifySignature(signature, message, signingEntityPublicKey, path, validatorPublicKey):
    return Valid
  else:
    return Invalid
```

**Novelty:**

This system introduces dynamic, time-limited shards within the hash tree structure. This allows for granular control over signature authority, enables rapid revocation of compromised keys (by expiring a shard), and scales better than a static, hierarchical structure. It effectively adds a temporal dimension to the security model, making it more resilient to long-term attacks.  The ephemeral nature of shards reduces the attack surface and minimizes the risk associated with key compromise.
