## Dynamic Characteristic Weighting for Multi-Pass Refinement

**Concept:** Extend the single-pass multi-characteristic recognition by introducing a dynamic weighting system applied *across multiple refinement passes*. The initial pass identifies potential characteristics as the patent describes. Subsequent passes refine these identifications, not by simply re-analyzing the same embeddings, but by dynamically adjusting the ‘importance’ of each characteristic during each pass.

**Specification:**

1.  **Initial Pass:** Standard operation as described in the patent.  Extract initial embeddings, determine interaction embeddings, and generate initial label predictions. Record a "confidence score" for each characteristic prediction.

2.  **Characteristic Weighting Matrix:** A matrix (CWM) is created, initialized with uniform weights for each characteristic.  The dimensions of this matrix are `[number of characteristics x number of characteristics]`.

3.  **Refinement Passes (N iterations):**
    *   **Weight Adjustment:** Before each refinement pass, the CWM is updated based on the confidence scores from the *previous* pass. A function (e.g., softmax, or a more complex algorithm like Thompson Sampling) converts confidence scores into weight adjustments. Higher confidence = larger weight adjustment. The weight adjustments are applied to the CWM, scaling the influence of each characteristic on others.  
        *   `CWM[i, j] = CWM[i, j] + (confidence_score[j] * learning_rate)`
    *   **Weighted Embedding Combination:** In each refinement pass, before generating interaction embeddings, a weighted sum of the second set of output embeddings (characteristic embeddings) is calculated.  This weighted sum becomes the new input for calculating interaction embeddings.
        *   `weighted_characteristic_embeddings = sum(CWM[i, :] * characteristic_embeddings[i])`  (sum across all characteristics `i`)
    *   **Interaction & Prediction:** Interaction embeddings and label predictions are generated using the `weighted_characteristic_embeddings` as input.
    *   **Confidence Update:** The confidence scores are updated based on the new label predictions.
4.  **Termination Criteria:**  Refinement passes continue until:
    *   A maximum number of passes (N) is reached.
    *   The change in confidence scores between passes falls below a threshold.
    *   A desired level of accuracy is achieved.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
CWM = initialize_CWM(number_of_characteristics)
confidence_scores = initialize_confidence_scores()

// Main Loop
for i in range(max_passes):
  // Weight Adjustment
  adjusted_CWM = adjust_CWM(CWM, confidence_scores, learning_rate)

  // Weighted Embedding Combination
  weighted_characteristic_embeddings = combine_embeddings(characteristic_embeddings, adjusted_CWM)

  // Interaction & Prediction
  interaction_embeddings = calculate_interaction_embeddings(output_embeddings, weighted_characteristic_embeddings)
  label_predictions = generate_label_predictions(interaction_embeddings)

  // Confidence Update
  new_confidence_scores = update_confidence_scores(label_predictions)

  // Termination Check
  if change_in_confidence_scores(new_confidence_scores, confidence_scores) < threshold or i == max_passes:
    break
  confidence_scores = new_confidence_scores
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Accuracy:** By dynamically adjusting the influence of each characteristic, the system can refine its predictions and reduce false positives/negatives.
*   **Handling Ambiguity:** The weighting system can help resolve ambiguous cases where multiple characteristics are relevant.
*   **Adaptability:** The system can adapt to different types of text and different characteristic sets.
*   **More Robust Training:** This approach can potentially lead to more robust training, particularly with noisy or incomplete data.
