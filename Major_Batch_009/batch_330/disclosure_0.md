## Dynamic Relationship Graph Construction & Predictive Feature Generation

**Concept:** Extend the record-pair analysis beyond simple similarity detection to construct a dynamic, evolving relationship graph representing interconnected entities. Leverage this graph to *predict* potentially relevant features for improved machine learning model training.

**Specification:**

**I. Graph Database Schema:**

*   **Nodes:** Represent entities (records). Each node stores:
    *   Entity ID (unique identifier)
    *   Attribute Vector (representation of entity features)
    *   Class Label (top-level class assignment)
    *   Timestamp (last updated)
*   **Edges:** Represent relationships between entities. Each edge stores:
    *   Source Node ID
    *   Target Node ID
    *   Relationship Type (e.g., similarity score, inclusion, participation, derived relation)
    *   Edge Weight (confidence score of the relationship)
    *   Timestamp (relationship established/updated)

**II. Relationship Inference Engine:**

1.  **Initial Graph Population:** Seed the graph using the existing record-pair analysis system.  Record pairs with high similarity scores (or other identified relationships) become edges connecting the corresponding entity nodes.
2.  **Transitive Inference:** Implement a rule-based engine to infer new relationships based on existing connections. Example:  If Entity A is similar to Entity B, and Entity B is related to Entity C, infer a weaker relationship between Entity A and Entity C.
3.  **Contextual Feature Extraction:** For each edge, calculate contextual features based on the connected nodes and their attributes. These features might include:
    *   Attribute Variance (difference in attribute values between connected nodes)
    *   Shared Class Frequency (how often nodes of the same class are connected)
    *   Path Length (shortest path between nodes in the graph)
    *   Neighborhood Density (number of connections surrounding a node)
4.  **Relationship Weighting:** Assign weights to edges based on the strength of the relationship, the contextual features, and a dynamically adjusted confidence threshold.

**III. Predictive Feature Generation Module:**

1.  **Graph Embedding:** Utilize graph embedding techniques (e.g., Node2Vec, GraphSAGE) to generate low-dimensional vector representations of each node based on its position and connections within the graph.
2.  **Feature Augmentation:**  Append the graph embedding vectors to the existing attribute vectors of the entities. This augmented feature set becomes the input for the machine learning models.
3.  **Dynamic Feature Selection:** Employ a feature selection algorithm (e.g., recursive feature elimination) to identify the most relevant features (including those derived from the graph embedding) for each top-level class.
4.  **Feedback Loop:** Continuously update the graph and the learned features as new data becomes available. This ensures that the system adapts to changes in the underlying data distribution.

**IV. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialize Graph
graph = new GraphDatabase()

// Process Record Pairs
for each (recordPair) in recordPairs:
    entityA = recordPair.entityA
    entityB = recordPair.entityB
    similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(entityA, entityB)
    if similarityScore > threshold:
        graph.addEdge(entityA.id, entityB.id, relationshipType="similarity", weight=similarityScore)

// Infer New Relationships (Simplified)
for each (node) in graph.nodes:
    for each (neighbor) in graph.neighbors(node):
        for each (neighborOfNeighbor) in graph.neighbors(neighbor):
            if not graph.hasEdge(node, neighborOfNeighbor):
                inferredWeight = calculateInferredWeight(node, neighbor, neighborOfNeighbor)
                graph.addEdge(node, neighborOfNeighbor, relationshipType="inferred", weight=inferredWeight)

// Generate Graph Embeddings
embeddings = generateGraphEmbeddings(graph)

// Augment Entity Attributes
for each (entity) in entities:
    entity.attributeVector.append(embeddings[entity.id])

// Train Machine Learning Models with Augmented Features
model = trainModel(entities)
```
