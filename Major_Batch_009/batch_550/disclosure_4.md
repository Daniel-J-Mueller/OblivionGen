## Dynamic Data Source Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Enhance query processing by dynamically weighting data sources based on real-time query performance and data source 'health'. The existing patent focuses on ranking *candidate linkages* within a fixed set of data. This expands upon that by assigning weights to the *data sources themselves* before linkage even begins, and adapting those weights over time. This is a meta-ranking system.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** `Data Source Weighting Agent` (DSWA). This operates as a pre-processor to the existing query language processing pipeline.
*   **Input:**
    *   List of available data sources (databases, APIs, files, etc.).
    *   Query text.
    *   Metadata snapshots of each data source (column names, data types, example values).
    *   Historical query performance data (latency, accuracy, cost) for each data source.
    *   Real-time data source health metrics (availability, error rates, resource utilization).
*   **Core:** A Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent.
    *   **State:** Combination of query text embedding (using a transformer model), metadata snapshot embeddings for each data source, historical performance metrics, and real-time health metrics.
    *   **Action:** Assign a weight to each data source (between 0 and 1).  Weights sum to 1.
    *   **Reward:** Calculated based on query execution time, query result accuracy (determined by comparing to a ‘ground truth’ if available, or through user feedback), and cost (e.g., API call costs).  A combined score reflecting these factors.
    *   **Algorithm:**  Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or similar policy gradient method.  The agent learns an optimal policy for assigning weights based on observed rewards.
*   **Integration:**  DSWA outputs a weighted list of data sources.  The query language processing pipeline prioritizes data sources with higher weights during candidate linkage and data retrieval.
*   **Components:**
    *   `Query Encoder`: Transformer model (BERT, RoBERTa) to embed the query text.
    *   `Metadata Encoder`: Transformer model to embed the metadata snapshots.
    *   `Performance Monitor`: Tracks query execution time, accuracy, and cost for each data source.
    *   `Health Monitor`: Monitors data source availability, error rates, and resource utilization.
    *   `RL Agent`: PPO agent that learns the optimal data source weighting policy.
    *   `Weighting Function`: Applies the weights to the data sources during query processing.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# Initialization
Initialize RL Agent
Initialize Performance Monitor
Initialize Health Monitor

# Query Processing Loop
While True:
    Receive Query
    Query Embedding = Query Encoder(Query)

    For Each Data Source:
        Metadata Embedding = Metadata Encoder(Data Source Metadata)
        Performance Data = Performance Monitor.get_data(Data Source)
        Health Data = Health Monitor.get_data(Data Source)
        State = Combine(Query Embedding, Metadata Embedding, Performance Data, Health Data)
        Action = RL Agent.choose_action(State) # Returns weights for all data sources
        Weighted Data Sources = Apply Weights to Data Sources
        
    Process Query using Weighted Data Sources
    Calculate Reward
    RL Agent.update_policy(State, Action, Reward)
```

**Innovation:**

This isn't simply about identifying the *best* linkages, but about identifying the *best data sources* to even *begin* the linkage process.  It adds a layer of dynamic optimization that adapts to changing data source conditions and query patterns. This enhances performance, reduces costs, and improves accuracy. The RL component enables the system to learn and improve over time without explicit programming.
