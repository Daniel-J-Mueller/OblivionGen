## Adaptive Causality Weighting via Temporal Resonance

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on identifying *known* causal relationships. This builds on that by dynamically weighting causality based on temporal resonance – how closely the timing of events and anomalies aligns with established causal chains.  It addresses situations where known relationships might be *weakened* or *strengthened* by external factors or evolving system behavior. Think of it as a 'fuzzy' causality engine.

**Specification:**

**1. Temporal Resonance Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:** Anomaly/Event stream, Causality Knowledgebase (as defined in the patent), configurable Temporal Window (e.g., 5 seconds, 30 seconds, 5 minutes).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each anomaly/event, identify potential causal sources from the Knowledgebase.
    *   For each potential source, calculate a Resonance Score. The Resonance Score is a function of the time difference between the source event and the target anomaly, weighted by the Temporal Window.
    *   Resonance Score = `e^(-(deltaTime / TemporalWindow)^2)`  (Gaussian decay – rewards closer timing).  DeltaTime is the time difference between the source event and the anomaly.
    *   Normalize Resonance Scores for each potential source, so the sum of scores for a single anomaly equals 1.
*   **Output:**  Anomaly/Event stream augmented with Resonance Scores for each potential causal source.

**2. Weighted Causality Engine:**

*   **Input:** Augmented Anomaly/Event stream (from Temporal Resonance Calculation Module), Causality Knowledgebase.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each anomaly, identify potential causal sources as before.
    *   Multiply the severity score (from the Causality Knowledgebase) of each potential source by its corresponding Resonance Score. This yields a *Weighted Severity Score*.
    *   Rank potential causal sources based on Weighted Severity Score.
    *   Causality is inferred based on the top-ranked sources that exceed a configurable Threshold.
*   **Output:**  Causality indication including:  Causality Source, Causality Target, Weighted Severity Score, Resonance Score, and Confidence Level (based on threshold).

**3. Adaptive Temporal Window Control:**

*   **Input:** Historical data on system performance, causality resolution rates, and system volatility (measured by anomaly frequency).
*   **Process:**  A feedback loop dynamically adjusts the Temporal Window.
    *   If causality resolution rates are low and system volatility is high, *decrease* the Temporal Window to prioritize recent events.
    *   If causality resolution rates are high and system volatility is low, *increase* the Temporal Window to capture longer-term dependencies.
    *   Employ a PID controller to stabilize the Temporal Window based on desired causality resolution rate.
*   **Output:**  Updated Temporal Window configuration for the Temporal Resonance Calculation Module.

**4.  Causality Graph Enhancement:**

*   Expand the existing causality graph (from patent claim 12) to include Resonance Scores as edge weights. This allows visualization of the strength of causal relationships, dynamically changing as system behavior evolves.
*   Color-code edges based on Resonance Score, highlighting strong and weak causal links.

**Pseudocode (Weighted Causality Engine):**

```
function inferCausality(anomaly, knowledgeBase, resonanceScores):
  potentialSources = knowledgeBase.getSources(anomaly)
  weightedSources = []
  for source in potentialSources:
    severity = source.severity
    resonance = resonanceScores.getScore(anomaly, source)
    weightedSeverity = severity * resonance
    weightedSources.append((source, weightedSeverity))
  weightedSources.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  for source, weightedSeverity in weightedSources:
    if weightedSeverity > threshold:
      return (source, anomaly, weightedSeverity, resonanceScores.getScore(anomaly, source))
  return None  # No causal link found
```
