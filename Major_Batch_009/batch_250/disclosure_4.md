## Adaptive Luminescence & Spatial Awareness Reading Light

**Core Concept:** A reading light that doesn't just illuminate, but *responds* to the reader's activity and environment, becoming almost an extension of their reading experience.  It moves beyond simple brightness adjustment and integrates positional tracking with dynamic light shaping.

**I. Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Light Source:**  Micro-LED array (high density, individually addressable).  Color temperature adjustable (2700K - 6500K).  Minimum 1000 lumens peak output.
*   **Positional Tracking:**
    *   Integrated miniature wide-angle camera (60° field of view).  Resolution: 720p minimum.
    *   Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor for depth mapping (range: 0.2m - 3m).
    *   Optional:  IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for enhanced stability and responsiveness, especially for mobile applications.
*   **Actuation:**
    *   Two-axis gimbal mount allowing for +/- 45° pan and tilt.  Stepper motors with encoder feedback for precise positioning.
    *   Focusing mechanism: Variable focal length lens system (motorized) to adjust beam width/intensity.
*   **Power:** USB-C Power Delivery (PD) for flexibility. Internal battery backup (3.7V Li-ion, 2000mAh minimum) for portable use.
*   **Housing:**  Lightweight, durable polymer (ABS or polycarbonate). Minimalist aesthetic.
*   **Mounting:**  Magnetic base with optional clip-on/suction-cup attachments for versatile placement.

**II. Software/Algorithmic Specifications:**

*   **Reader Position Tracking:**  Camera and ToF data fusion to track the reader's head/eye position in real-time.  Algorithms:  Kalman filtering, object recognition (to identify the reader's face/head).
*   **Content Awareness (Optional):**  If connected to an e-reader/tablet, access to document structure/layout data (via API).  Allows for highlighting text, automatically illuminating specific pages/sections.
*   **Dynamic Light Shaping:**
    *   **Beam Steering:**  Actuate the gimbal to precisely direct the light beam onto the reading material.
    *   **Brightness Control:**  Adaptive brightness based on ambient light levels *and* reader's proximity/angle to the light source.
    *   **Color Temperature Adjustment:**  Automatically adjust color temperature to reduce eye strain (warmer tones for low light, cooler tones for bright environments).
    *   **Peripheral Dimming:**  Reduce light spill to minimize distraction to others.  Dynamic masking of the LED array to shape the light beam.
*   **Predictive Illumination:**  Based on reading speed and turning of pages, predict the next section to be read and pre-illuminate it slightly.
*   **User Profiles:**  Store preferred lighting settings for different readers.
*   **API:** Open API for integration with other smart home devices/platforms.

**III. Operational Modes:**

*   **Standard Mode:**  Adaptive brightness and positioning based on reader's head position and ambient light.
*   **Focus Mode:**  Tight, focused beam for detailed reading.
*   **Ambient Mode:**  Low-intensity, diffused light for general illumination.
*   **Sleep Mode:** Automatically dim or turn off the light after a period of inactivity.
*   **Content Sync Mode (if applicable):** Light follows the text as the reader scrolls/turns pages.

**IV. Pseudocode (Dynamic Light Positioning):**

```pseudocode
// Loop:
GetReaderHeadPosition(camera, ToF)
GetAmbientLightLevel(sensor)

// Calculate desired light position based on head position and page location
desiredX = readerHeadX + pageOffsetX
desiredY = readerHeadY + pageOffsetY
desiredZ = readerHeadZ + pageOffsetZ

// Calculate brightness based on ambient light and reading distance
brightness = max(0, 255 - ambientLight * 0.5 - (distanceToPage * 0.1))

// Move gimbal to desired position
moveGimbal(desiredX, desiredY, desiredZ)

// Set brightness of LED array
setLEDArrayBrightness(brightness)
```
