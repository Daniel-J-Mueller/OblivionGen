## Automated Sentiment-Driven Priority Adjustment for Unified Threads

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple status updates to incorporate sentiment analysis of incoming messages within a thread and dynamically adjust priority/visibility within a consolidated view. This allows users to instantly identify threads requiring immediate attention not just based on *what* happened, but *how* it was communicated.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Component: Sentiment Analysis Module:**

   *   **Input:** Raw text from incoming messages (email, tickets, chat, etc.).
   *   **Process:** Employ a multi-layered sentiment analysis engine.
        *   **Layer 1: Core Sentiment:** Determine overall positivity, negativity, or neutrality. Utilize established NLP libraries (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) and a continually refined machine learning model trained on communication datasets.
        *   **Layer 2: Emotion Detection:** Identify specific emotions present in the message (anger, frustration, urgency, joy, etc.). This utilizes a more complex emotion detection model, potentially based on deep learning techniques.
        *   **Layer 3: Intensity Scaling:** Assign an intensity score to detected emotions.  For example, "mild frustration" has a lower score than "extreme anger."
   *   **Output:** Sentiment Score (ranging from -1 to +1), Emotion Tag(s), Intensity Value.

**2. Priority Calculation Engine:**

   *   **Input:** Sentiment Score, Emotion Tag(s), Intensity Value, Message Age, User-Defined Preferences (e.g., prioritize messages from specific senders/teams, ignore certain emotions).
   *   **Process:** Calculate a Priority Score using a weighted formula.  Example:
        `Priority = (Sentiment * Weight_Sentiment) + (EmotionIntensity * Weight_Emotion) + (1/MessageAge * Weight_Age) + (UserPriority * Weight_User)`
        *   `Weight_Sentiment`, `Weight_Emotion`, `Weight_Age`, `Weight_User` are configurable parameters.
        *   Negative Sentiment Score contributes negatively to the overall Priority Score.
        *   High Emotion Intensity increases the Priority Score.
        *   Older messages receive a lower Priority Score.
        *   User-defined priorities override default weights.
   *   **Output:** Priority Score (numeric value).

**3. Consolidated View Adaptation:**

   *   **Display Logic:** The consolidated status view (as described in the base patent) will incorporate the calculated Priority Score.
        *   **Visual Cueing:** Threads are sorted by Priority Score.  High-priority threads are displayed prominently.
        *   **Color Coding:**  Threads are color-coded based on the dominant emotion detected (e.g., red for anger/urgency, yellow for frustration, green for positive sentiment).  Intensity can affect the shade of the color.
        *   **Emotion Icons:**  Display small icons representing the dominant emotions within each thread.
        *   **Dynamic Highlighting:**  When a user hovers over a thread, a tooltip displays a more detailed breakdown of the sentiment and emotions present.
   *   **Filtering/Grouping:** Users can filter/group threads based on sentiment, emotion, or priority.

**4. System Architecture:**

   *   The Sentiment Analysis Module can be implemented as a microservice, allowing for scalability and independent updates.
   *   The Priority Calculation Engine integrates with the existing PIM server application.
   *   The consolidated view is rendered by the client device, receiving priority data from the server.

**Pseudocode (Priority Calculation):**

```
function calculatePriority(sentimentScore, emotionIntensity, messageAge, userPriority):
  weightSentiment = 0.4
  weightEmotion = 0.3
  weightAge = 0.1
  weightUser = 0.2

  priority = (sentimentScore * weightSentiment) + (emotionIntensity * weightEmotion) + (1 / messageAge * weightAge) + (userPriority * weightUser)

  return priority
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Proactive Suggestions:**  Based on detected sentiment, the system could suggest appropriate responses or actions (e.g., escalating a high-priority thread to a manager).
*   **Personalized Sentiment Profiles:**  Learn user communication patterns and adjust sentiment analysis weights accordingly.
*   **Team-Level Sentiment Monitoring:**  Aggregate sentiment data across all threads to identify potential team morale issues.
