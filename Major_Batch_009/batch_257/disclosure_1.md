## Dynamic Resource Masking via Temporal Access Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical access control to incorporate *temporal* dimensions and resource masking. Instead of simply granting or denying access, the system dynamically adjusts *what* a user sees within a resource based on their role, time of day, and recent activity. This builds on the “lazy evaluation” aspect – access isn’t just determined once, but continuously adapted.

**Specs:**

*   **Temporal Access Profiles (TAP):**  Users are assigned TAP, defining access levels for specific time windows (e.g., “Standard Hours”, “Off-Peak”, “Emergency Access”). Each TAP contains a rule set.
*   **Resource Masking Rules:**  Rules define *how* a resource is presented to a user, given their TAP. Masking types include:
    *   **Data Redaction:**  Specific data fields are hidden or replaced with placeholders.
    *   **Feature Suppression:**  Certain functionalities or UI elements are disabled.
    *   **Content Filtering:**  Results are filtered based on keywords or categories.
    *   **Virtualization:** Users see a curated version of the resource, only the sections or elements applicable to their role.
*   **Activity-Based Adjustment:** The system monitors user activity (e.g., frequency of access, types of operations performed). If activity deviates from a baseline (defined in the TAP), masking rules are dynamically adjusted (e.g., increased redaction, more restrictive filtering). This addresses potential insider threats or anomalous behavior.
*   **Hierarchical Rule Inheritance:** Masking rules are defined at the hierarchy level (like existing ACLs). Lower-level resources inherit rules, but can override them with specific configurations.
*   **Real-Time Masking Engine:** A dedicated engine intercepts resource requests and applies masking rules *before* data is returned to the user. This ensures consistent enforcement and minimizes performance overhead.
*   **TAP Management Interface:**  A UI for administrators to create, modify, and assign TAPs.  Should include tools for defining time windows, masking rules, and activity baselines.

**Pseudocode (Real-Time Masking Engine):**

```
function processResourceRequest(user, resource, operation):
    // 1. Determine User's TAP
    tap = getUserTAP(user)

    // 2. Collect Hierarchical Masking Rules
    rules = collectHierarchicalMaskingRules(resource)

    // 3. Apply Activity-Based Adjustment
    adjustedRules = applyActivityAdjustment(user, rules, tap)

    // 4. Apply Masking Rules
    maskedData = applyMaskingRules(adjustedRules, resource, operation)

    // 5. Return Masked Data
    return maskedData
```

**Example:**

A financial analyst (TAP: "Standard Hours") accesses a customer account. The system masks sensitive PII (Social Security number, account details) but displays transaction history and financial summaries. If the analyst attempts to access the account outside of standard hours, the system increases redaction, hiding even more data.  If the analyst repeatedly attempts to view restricted information, access is logged and potentially escalated.
