## Adaptive Data Source Weighting & Predictive Merging

**Concept:** Extend the existing lockstep paging approach by dynamically weighting data sources based on real-time data quality metrics and incorporating a predictive merging algorithm to minimize conflict resolution overhead.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Quality Monitoring Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw data streams from each data source (first, second, and any additional).
*   **Metrics:**
    *   *Completeness:* Percentage of expected records received within each paging interval.
    *   *Accuracy:* Validation against pre-defined data integrity rules (e.g., data type checks, range limitations).
    *   *Timeliness:* Latency of data delivery.
*   **Output:** A continuously updated weight value (0.0 to 1.0) for each data source. Sources with higher completeness, accuracy, and timeliness receive higher weights.

**2. Weighted Paging Controller:**

*   **Input:**  Paging requests, Data source weights (from Data Quality Monitoring Module).
*   **Logic:**  Instead of strict lockstep, prioritize requests to data sources with higher weights.  Allow a slight asynchronous offset in paging â€“ e.g., request 2x the paging interval from the highest weighted source, 1.5x from the next, etc. This mitigates the "slowest source dictates pace" problem.
*   **Output:**  Series of optimized paging requests.

**3. Predictive Merge Algorithm:**

*   **Input:**  Record streams from each data source, Historical merge conflict data (e.g. which fields commonly conflict, probabilities of conflict given field values).
*   **Logic:** Before merging records with the same identifier, calculate a "predicted conflict score" based on historical data and current field values.
    *   If the conflict score is below a threshold, automatically accept the record from the higher weighted data source *without* full comparison.
    *   If the conflict score exceeds the threshold, perform a full record comparison and apply the authoritative source rule.
*   **Output:** Merged dataset with minimized conflict resolution overhead.

**4.  Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**

*   **Trigger:**  Significant degradation in data quality metrics from any source (defined threshold).
*   **Action:** Automatically reduce the weight of the affected source and increase the weights of the remaining sources proportionally.
*   **Goal:** Adaptive system that continuously optimizes data source utilization and minimizes reliance on unreliable sources.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Merge):**

```
function merge_records(record1, record2, source1_weight, source2_weight):
  conflict_score = calculate_conflict_score(record1, record2)

  if conflict_score < conflict_threshold:
    // Low conflict probability
    if source1_weight > source2_weight:
      return record1
    else:
      return record2
  else:
    // High conflict probability - perform full comparison
    if record1.field1 != record2.field1 or record1.field2 != record2.field2:
      // Conflict exists
      if source1_weight > source2_weight:
        return record1
      else:
        return record2
    else:
      // No conflict
      return record1 // or record2 - doesn't matter
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DataQualityMetrics`:  {source_id: float (weight), completeness: float, accuracy: float, timeliness: float}
*   `HistoricalConflictData`:  {field_name: {value_combination: conflict_probability}}
*   `PagedRecordSet`: List of records received from a single data source during a single paging interval.
