## Adaptive Composite Stream Prioritization & Dynamic Resolution Scaling

**Core Concept:** Expand upon the idea of creating composite streams based on device capability, but introduce a system that *prioritizes* which video streams are included in the composite *and* dynamically adjusts the resolution of each stream within the composite based on real-time network conditions and device load *after* initial connection. This goes beyond simply failing to include a stream; it intelligently degrades and prioritizes to maintain a usable experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Stream Prioritization Matrix:**

*   A configurable matrix resides on the server-side. This matrix allows an administrator (or potentially uses AI-driven learning) to assign priority levels to participants based on pre-defined roles (presenter, moderator, attendee), or dynamically, based on observed interaction (speaking time, screen sharing).
*   Priority levels: High, Medium, Low, None.
*   The server actively maintains a list of participant priorities.

**2. Real-Time Device Load Monitoring:**

*   Each client device periodically (e.g., every 200ms) transmits telemetry data to the server, including:
    *   CPU Usage
    *   GPU Usage
    *   Available Memory
    *   Network Bandwidth (Upload & Download)
    *   Current Frame Rate (of received streams)
*   The server analyzes this telemetry data to determine the device's capacity.

**3. Dynamic Resolution Scaling Algorithm:**

*   Based on the device’s capacity (derived from telemetry) *and* the participant priority, the server dynamically adjusts the resolution of each video stream included in the composite.
*   Resolution tiers: 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, 240p.  (Configurable)
*   Algorithm logic:

```pseudocode
function determineResolution(deviceCapacity, participantPriority, baseResolution):
    if deviceCapacity < 25%:
        if participantPriority == "High":
            return 360p
        else if participantPriority == "Medium":
            return 240p
        else:
            return 0p // Drop stream entirely
    else if deviceCapacity < 50%:
        if participantPriority == "High":
            return 720p
        else if participantPriority == "Medium":
            return 480p
        else:
            return 360p
    else if deviceCapacity < 75%:
        if participantPriority == "High":
            return 1080p
        else if participantPriority == "Medium":
            return 720p
        else:
            return 480p
    else:
        return baseResolution
```

**4. Composite Stream Creation & Transmission:**

*   The server creates the composite stream based on:
    *   The prioritization matrix
    *   The dynamic resolution scaling for each stream
    *   A configurable layout (e.g., grid, spotlight)
*   The composite stream is transmitted to the client device.

**5. Network Condition Adaptation:**

*   The server continuously monitors network conditions (packet loss, latency) between itself and each client.
*   If network conditions degrade, the server can:
    *   Reduce the overall bitrate of the composite stream.
    *   Further reduce the resolution of lower-priority streams.
    *   Prioritize key streams (e.g., the speaker’s stream).

**6. Client-Side Rendering:**

*   The client device receives the composite stream and renders it using its preferred rendering engine.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Use a scalable video encoding format (e.g., VP9, AV1) to minimize bandwidth usage.
*   Implement a robust error handling mechanism to gracefully handle network disruptions and device failures.
*   Provide a configuration interface for administrators to customize the prioritization matrix and resolution tiers.
*   Investigate the use of machine learning to automatically learn optimal prioritization and resolution settings based on user behavior and network conditions.
