## Adaptive Data Reconstruction via Predictive Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the partition-level backup/restore described in the patent by incorporating *predictive* partitioning and reconstruction based on data access patterns. Instead of fixed partitions, dynamically adjust partition boundaries based on observed query workloads. This allows for targeted, granular restoration and dramatically reduces recovery time and data volume.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Access Pattern Monitoring:**

*   **Component:** ‘Access Pattern Analyzer’ (APA)
*   **Function:** Continuously monitors database access logs (queries, transactions) at a fine-grained level.
*   **Output:**  Generates ‘Heatmaps’ representing data access frequency across the database. Heatmaps are time-series data, capturing access patterns over defined intervals.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `AccessRecord`: `{timestamp, table_name, partition_key, accessed_columns}`
    *   `Heatmap`: `[[timestamp, partition_key, access_count], ...]`

**2. Dynamic Partitioning Engine (DPE):**

*   **Function:** Adjusts partition boundaries based on Heatmap data.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Analyze Heatmap to identify ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ data regions.
    2.  Employ a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means) to group related data based on access patterns.
    3.  Dynamically split or merge partitions to align with clusters.
    4.  Maintain a ‘Partition Map’ that tracks current partition boundaries and associated data.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `PartitionMap`: `{partition_key: [start_range, end_range], ...}`
    *   `PartitionSplitRequest`: `{partition_key, split_point, new_partition_key}`

**3. Predictive Backup & Restore System (PBRS):**

*   **Function:**  Backs up and restores data based on dynamically adjusted partitions.
*   **Backup Process:**
    1.  APA & DPE generate updated PartitionMap.
    2.  PBRS backs up individual partitions based on PartitionMap.
    3.  Store backups with PartitionMap metadata.
*   **Restore Process:**
    1.  Identify required data based on restore request (time range, specific records).
    2.  Retrieve relevant partition backups from storage, leveraging PartitionMap metadata.
    3.  Reconstruct data based on partition boundaries, applying any changes from the change log.
*   **Pseudocode (Restore):**

```
function restoreData(restoreRequest) {
    partitionMap = retrievePartitionMap(restoreRequest.timestamp); //Get partition map at restore time
    relevantPartitions = identifyPartitions(partitionMap, restoreRequest.dataRange); //Determine necessary partitions

    reconstructedData = [];
    for each partition in relevantPartitions {
        backup = retrieveBackup(partition, restoreRequest.timestamp);
        changes = retrieveChanges(partition, backup.timestamp, restoreRequest.timestamp); //Apply change log
        data = applyChanges(backup.data, changes); //Reconstruct data
        reconstructedData.append(data);
    }
    return reconstructedData;
}
```

**4. Change Log Enhancement:**

*   The change log needs to be partition-aware.  Each change record should include the partition key.
*   The change log should support efficient filtering based on partition key.

**5. Initial Partitioning Strategy:**

*   When initializing the system, employ a basic partitioning strategy (e.g., range partitioning) and allow the APA & DPE to dynamically adjust partitions over time.

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Fast storage (SSD) is critical for performance.
*   Sufficient memory to handle large Heatmaps and PartitionMaps.
*   High-bandwidth network connection.
