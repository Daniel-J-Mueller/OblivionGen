**Adaptive Message Prioritization & Selective Flooding**

**Concept:** Enhance the broadcast system by introducing dynamic message prioritization *and* a selective flooding mechanism. Instead of simply forwarding messages to all connected gateways, the system learns message importance based on device responses & network conditions, then selectively floods only the most relevant gateways. This dramatically reduces network congestion and improves responsiveness for critical broadcasts.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Priority Assessment Engine (PAE) – Implemented as a microservice within each device gateway.
*   **Input:** Publication message payload, originating device ID, broadcast topic, real-time network metrics (latency, bandwidth, packet loss) from connected devices.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Initial Priority:** Assign a base priority to each message based on the broadcast topic (configurable by administrator – e.g., ‘critical alerts’ > ‘routine updates’).
    2.  **Response Analysis:** Monitor acknowledgement (ACK) rates and response times from devices receiving the message. Higher ACK rates and faster responses increase priority. Conversely, frequent negative acknowledgements (NACKs) or timeouts decrease priority.
    3.  **Network Condition Weighting:** Incorporate real-time network metrics.  A gateway experiencing high congestion or packet loss *decreases* the effective priority of messages it forwards. This discourages propagation through degraded network paths.
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously recalculate message priority based on incoming feedback & network conditions.
*   **Component:** Selective Flooding Manager (SFM) – Also implemented as a microservice within each gateway.
*   **Input:** Message priority, list of connected gateways, network metrics for each gateway.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Priority Thresholding:** Define configurable priority thresholds.  Messages below the threshold are *not* flooded.
    2.  **Neighborhood Awareness:** Gateways periodically exchange “network health” information (latency, bandwidth, load) with their immediate neighbors.
    3.  **Path Selection:** When flooding a message, the SFM selects the *fewest* number of healthy gateways (based on neighborhood awareness) that will reach the largest number of target devices.  It avoids forwarding through congested or unreliable gateways.
    4.  **Adaptive Learning:**  The SFM learns which gateways are most effective at delivering messages to specific regions or device types. It biases future path selections accordingly.

**Pseudocode (SFM – Path Selection):**

```
function select_paths(message, destination_devices, neighboring_gateways):
  priority = message.priority
  eligible_gateways = []
  for gateway in neighboring_gateways:
    if gateway.health_score > min_health_threshold and gateway.load < max_load_threshold:
      eligible_gateways.append(gateway)

  if not eligible_gateways:
    return [] // No viable paths

  // Sort eligible gateways by a combination of:
  // 1. Coverage (number of destination devices reachable)
  // 2. Latency (estimated round-trip time to destination devices)
  // 3. Current Load

  sorted_gateways = sort(eligible_gateways, by: [coverage, latency, load])

  selected_paths = []
  devices_reached = set()

  for gateway in sorted_gateways:
    // Add gateway to selected paths
    selected_paths.append(gateway)

    // Update devices_reached with devices reachable through this gateway
    devices_reached.update(gateway.reachable_devices)

    // Stop if all destination devices have been reached
    if devices_reached == destination_devices:
      break

  return selected_paths
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Gateway Health Score`:  A numeric value representing the overall health of a gateway (based on latency, bandwidth, packet loss, CPU load).
*   `Reachable Devices`: A list of device IDs that a gateway can directly reach.
*   `Priority Queue`: Used by the PAE to store messages waiting to be flooded, sorted by priority.

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Employ a distributed hash table (DHT) to efficiently manage `Reachable Devices` across all gateways.
*   Use a message broker (e.g., Kafka) to handle high volumes of ACK/NACK messages.
*   Implement a caching layer to reduce the load on the DHT and message broker.
