## Adaptive Biometric Access with Predictive Locking

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple text-based authorization to incorporate real-time biometric data and predictive behavior analysis for a more robust and secure access system. This isn’t just *who* is accessing, but *how* they are accessing, and preemptively securing the structure based on learned behavior.

**System Specs:**

*   **Biometric Sensor Integration:** Integrate with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers) and potentially in-home environmental sensors (cameras with facial/gait recognition, pressure sensors on doormats).
*   **Behavioral Baseline Creation:**  System learns user (authorized second user) routines – typical arrival/departure times, gait speed, common paths within the structure, even subtle biometric fluctuations associated with stress or unusual activity. This requires a training period.
*   **Real-time Anomaly Detection:**  System constantly monitors incoming biometric data and compares it to the established baseline. Deviations trigger increasing levels of security checks.
*   **Dynamic Access Levels:** Access is tiered:
    *   **Level 1 (Normal):** Baseline data matches. Smart lock unlocks via text command (as in original patent) *and* biometric confirmation.
    *   **Level 2 (Caution):** Minor deviations (e.g., slightly faster gait, different time of arrival). Requires secondary authentication – voice print, facial scan from in-home camera.
    *   **Level 3 (Alert):** Significant deviations (e.g., rushed gait, unusual time, potential disguise detected). System automatically locks down the structure, alerts the first user *and* emergency services.
*   **Predictive Locking:**  Based on learned routines, the system *anticipates* when the second user will likely lock up after entry. If no activity is detected within a defined timeframe, the lock automatically engages.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate with external data sources (weather, traffic) to account for potential delays and adjust anomaly detection thresholds accordingly.
*   **First User Override:** First user retains full control via app – can remotely unlock/lock, view activity logs, adjust settings, and disable/enable features.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** All biometric data is encrypted and stored locally, with user control over data retention and sharing.  Option for anonymized data collection for system improvement.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic – Anomaly Detection):**

```
FUNCTION AnalyzeAccessRequest(textMessage, biometricData, currentTime):
  // 1. Verify Text Message (original patent logic)
  IF VerifyTextMessage(textMessage) == FALSE:
    RETURN ACCESS_DENIED

  // 2. Get User Profile
  userProfile = GetUserProfile(userAssociatedWithTextMessage)

  // 3. Compare Biometric Data to Baseline
  deviationScore = CalculateDeviationScore(biometricData, userProfile.baselineBiometrics)

  // 4. Adjust Deviation Score based on Context
  deviationScore = AdjustDeviationScore(deviationScore, currentTime, externalContext)

  // 5. Determine Access Level
  IF deviationScore <= THRESHOLD_1:
    accessLevel = LEVEL_1
  ELSE IF deviationScore <= THRESHOLD_2:
    accessLevel = LEVEL_2
  ELSE:
    accessLevel = LEVEL_3

  // 6. Enforce Access Level (secondary authentication, lockdown, alerts)
  ENFORCE accessLevel

  RETURN ACCESS_GRANTED / ACCESS_DENIED
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Smart Lock compatible with existing system.
*   Wearable device support (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity).
*   Optional: In-home camera with facial/gait recognition.
*   Dedicated processor/microcontroller for local data processing.
*   Secure storage for user profiles and biometric data.
