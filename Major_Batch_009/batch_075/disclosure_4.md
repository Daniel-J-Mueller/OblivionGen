## Adaptive Attestation Chains for Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the attestation process beyond a single device/server pair to a dynamic, multi-stage chain, incorporating real-time behavioral analysis to refine trust scores and enable granular access control. This isn’t about verifying *if* a device is trustworthy, but *how* trustworthy it is at a given moment.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Types:** Introduce tiered node types within the attestation chain:
    *   **Root Node:** (Similar to the existing "first computer system") – Initiates the attestation process, manages the chain, and enforces ultimate policy.
    *   **Behavioral Observation Node:** Analyzes real-time device/application behavior (e.g., network traffic patterns, resource usage, sensor data, user interaction). Assigns a behavioral score.
    *   **Reputation Node:**  Accesses and aggregates reputation data from various sources (threat intelligence feeds, community reports, vendor data). 
    *   **Policy Enforcement Node:** Evaluates the combined attestation data, behavioral score, and reputation score against defined policies.  

*   **Dynamic Chain Construction:** The Root Node dynamically constructs the attestation chain based on the resource being accessed and the user’s profile.  High-value resources trigger longer, more complex chains with more nodes.

*   **Behavioral Scoring Algorithm:**
    *   **Baseline Establishment:**  For each user/device, establish a baseline of "normal" behavior.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Continuously monitor behavior for deviations from the baseline.
    *   **Scoring:** Assign a numerical score based on the severity and frequency of anomalies.  Higher scores indicate higher risk.  
    *   **Example Pseudocode:**

    ```
    function calculateBehavioralScore(deviceID, currentBehaviorData, baselineData):
      anomalyCount = 0
      for feature in currentBehaviorData:
        deviation = abs(currentBehaviorData[feature] - baselineData[feature])
        if deviation > threshold:
          anomalyCount++
      score = anomalyCount * weightFactor
      return score
    ```

*   **Attestation Data Aggregation:** Each node in the chain adds its findings (attestation data, behavioral score, reputation score) to a secure data packet. This packet is passed along the chain.

*   **Weighted Trust Calculation:**  The Root Node uses a weighted algorithm to combine the data from all nodes in the chain to calculate a final trust score.

    ```
    function calculateTrustScore(attestationData, behavioralScore, reputationScore, weights):
      trustScore = (attestationData * weights.attestation) + (behavioralScore * weights.behavioral) + (reputationScore * weights.reputation)
      return trustScore
    ```

*   **Granular Access Control:**  Access is granted or denied based on the final trust score and pre-defined policy thresholds.  Instead of a binary "allow/deny", the system can grant varying levels of access (e.g., read-only, limited functionality, full access).

* **Blockchain Integration (Optional):** Record key attestation events and trust scores on a blockchain for enhanced transparency and auditability.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Adaptive MFA:** Dynamically adjust the strength of multi-factor authentication based on the user’s trust score.
*   **Real-time Threat Response:** Automatically isolate or block compromised devices based on behavioral anomalies.
*   **Data Loss Prevention:** Restrict access to sensitive data based on the user’s trust score and the data’s classification.
*   **Supply Chain Security:** Verify the integrity of devices and components throughout the supply chain.
