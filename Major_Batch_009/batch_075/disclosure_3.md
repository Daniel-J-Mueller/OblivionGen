## Dynamic Temporal Masking & Re-Composition

**Concept:** Expand beyond frame *selection* to dynamic temporal masking and re-composition. Instead of simply choosing frames, identify regions *within* frames that are consistently interesting (e.g., a speaker’s face, a moving object) and create a new, temporally consistent video by masking out less important regions and blending/morphing between keyframes focusing on the identified regions.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Sampled video data (variable frame rate, resolution) + optional audio data.
*   **Core Modules:**
    *   **Motion/Interest Detection:** Utilize optical flow, object detection (pre-trained models, customizable), and potentially audio cue analysis to identify areas of interest within each frame. Assign a dynamic “interest score” to each pixel or region.
    *   **Temporal Consistency Engine:** Track identified regions across frames. Implement a Kalman filter or similar tracking algorithm to smooth region boundaries and predict future positions.
    *   **Mask Generation:** Generate a dynamic mask for each frame based on the interest scores and tracking data. The mask indicates which regions should be preserved and which should be discarded or blended.
    *   **Frame Warping/Morphing:** Apply a frame warping or morphing algorithm to seamlessly blend between keyframes, focusing on the preserved regions. The algorithm should prioritize temporal consistency and minimize visual artifacts.
    *   **Region Blending & In-Painting:**  If significant portions of a frame are masked out, employ in-painting techniques to fill in the missing regions with plausible content, based on surrounding frames and the tracked objects.
*   **Output:** Re-composed video with a variable frame rate (optimized for content and bandwidth). Associated metadata indicating the regions of interest, transition points, and confidence levels.
*   **Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
FOR each frame IN sampled_video:
    interest_map = detect_interest(frame) // Using motion detection, object detection, etc.
    tracked_regions = track_regions(interest_map, previous_frame)
    mask = generate_mask(tracked_regions)
    warped_frame = warp_frame(frame, mask) // Smooth blending & morphing
    IF significant_masking:
        inpainted_frame = inpaint(warped_frame, mask)
        output_frame = inpainted_frame
    ELSE:
        output_frame = warped_frame
    append output_frame to re_composed_video
    update previous_frame with output_frame
END FOR

```

*   **Key Parameters:**
    *   `interest_threshold`: Minimum interest score for a region to be considered.
    *   `morph_smoothness`: Controls the smoothness of the frame warping/morphing.
    *   `inpaint_radius`: Radius of the in-painting algorithm.
    *   `dynamic_framerate_target`: Target framerate to maintain.
*   **Potential Applications:**  Dynamic video summaries, bandwidth-adaptive streaming, real-time video editing, assistive technology (highlighting important information in videos).
