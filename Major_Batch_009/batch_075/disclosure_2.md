## Adaptive Proactive Contact Orchestration

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Predictive Engagement Engine" – a machine learning model continuously analyzing user behavior within the network-based service (e.g., website, application).
*   **Data Inputs:** User interface interactions (clicks, scrolls, form submissions, time spent on pages), historical contact data (past support requests, preferred communication channels), real-time service agent availability (as in the base patent), and external data sources (e.g., weather, news events potentially impacting service needs).
*   **Output:** “Engagement Score” – a numerical value representing the probability of a user needing assistance. Thresholds define proactive engagement levels.

**Functional Description:**

1.  **Real-Time Monitoring:** The Predictive Engagement Engine constantly monitors user behavior.
2.  **Engagement Score Calculation:** Based on data inputs, the engine calculates a dynamic Engagement Score for each user.
3.  **Proactive Contact Initiation:**
    *   **Low Engagement Score:** No action.
    *   **Medium Engagement Score:** System displays subtle, contextual help prompts within the UI (e.g., tooltips, short video tutorials).
    *   **High Engagement Score:** System initiates a proactive contact offer. This is *not* a direct connection attempt. Instead, the system offers a “Help is Available” banner with several options:
        *   **Request Callback:** User provides a phone number and desired callback time.
        *   **Start Chat:** Initiates a chat session with an available agent.
        *   **View FAQs:** Directs user to relevant FAQs based on their current activity.
        *    **'Smart Pause'**: Suggests pausing the user's current activity briefly to review help resources, potentially guided by a short animation overlay.
4.  **Orchestrated Contact Routing:** When a user selects an option, the system intelligently routes the request:
    *   **Skill-Based Routing:** Matches the user's needs with an agent possessing the relevant expertise.
    *   **Channel Preference:** Prioritizes the user's preferred communication channel (based on historical data or explicit selection).
    *   **Context Transfer:** Transfers all relevant user context (current page, previous interactions, Engagement Score) to the agent.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Core Loop (runs continuously)
FOR EACH user IN activeUsers:
    user.engagementScore = calculateEngagementScore(user)
    IF user.engagementScore > highThreshold:
        displayProactiveContactOffer(user)
    ELSE IF user.engagementScore > mediumThreshold:
        displayContextualHelpPrompt(user)

// calculateEngagementScore(user)
score = 0
score += weight * user.timeOnPage
score += weight * user.numberOfClicks
score += weight * user.formSubmissionErrors
score += weight * user.pastSupportRequests
// ... other factors ...
RETURN score

// displayProactiveContactOffer(user)
display banner with options: "Request Callback", "Start Chat", "View FAQs", "Smart Pause"
ON user selection:
    IF "Request Callback":
        collect callback preferences
        queue request for agent assignment
    ELSE IF "Start Chat":
        route to available agent with relevant skills
        transfer user context
    ELSE IF "View FAQs":
        display relevant FAQs
    ELSE IF "Smart Pause":
        display animated guide/resources
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply responding to requests. It *predicts* need and proactively offers assistance, leveraging a wider range of data inputs and offering multiple engagement options. The “Smart Pause” is a unique feature designed to minimize disruption while guiding the user towards self-service resources. This system moves from reactive support to proactive engagement, improving customer experience and potentially reducing support costs.
