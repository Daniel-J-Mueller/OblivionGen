## Adaptive Bioluminescent Doorbell

**Concept:** A doorbell incorporating genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria encased within a transparent, weatherproof housing. The illumination pattern and intensity dynamically respond to user-defined preferences and external conditions.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing:** Spherical, 15cm diameter, constructed from UV-resistant, clear acrylic. Sealed with a silicone gasket to ensure weatherproofing. Integrated mounting bracket for standard doorframes.
*   **Bacterial Culture:** *Vibrio fischeri* genetically modified for enhanced bioluminescence and responsiveness to external stimuli (light, temperature, sound). Encapsulated within a nutrient-rich hydrogel matrix.
*   **Stimuli Input:**
    *   **Sound Sensor:** High-sensitivity microphone detecting doorbell press and ambient sound levels.
    *   **Light Sensor:** Ambient light detection for automatic brightness adjustment.
    *   **Temperature Sensor:** Monitors external temperature for optimized bacterial activity.
*   **Control System:** Microcontroller (ESP32) managing bacterial stimulation, light/temperature data, and user settings. Connectivity via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi.
*   **Stimulation Mechanism:** A network of micro-LEDs within the hydrogel matrix providing localized stimulation to the bacteria, enhancing bioluminescence intensity and pattern.
*   **Power Source:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery with wireless charging capability. Estimated battery life: 7 days.
*   **User Interface:** Mobile app for:
    *   Customization of bioluminescence patterns (pulse, wave, static, etc.).
    *   Adjusting brightness and color temperature.
    *   Setting sensitivity thresholds for stimuli.
    *   Monitoring battery life and bacterial health.
    *   Geofencing to trigger specific patterns upon user approach.
*   **Bacterial Health Monitoring:** Integrated sensors to monitor pH, oxygen levels, and nutrient availability within the hydrogel matrix. Alerts sent to the user if bacterial health is compromised.

**Pseudocode (Bioluminescence Control):**

```
// Initialize Sensors and Actuators
sensor.sound = getSoundLevel();
sensor.light = getLightLevel();
sensor.temp = getTemperature();
actuator.led = initializeLEDArray();

// Get User Settings
userSettings = getUserSettings();

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Check for Doorbell Press
    if (sensor.sound > userSettings.soundThreshold) {
        // Trigger Bioluminescence Pattern
        pattern = userSettings.doorbellPattern;
        duration = userSettings.patternDuration;
        playBioluminescencePattern(pattern, duration);
    }

    // Adjust Brightness based on Ambient Light
    brightness = map(sensor.light, 0, 1000, 0, 100);
    setLEDBrightness(brightness);

    // Monitor Bacterial Health
    healthStatus = getBacterialHealthStatus();
    if (healthStatus == "critical") {
        sendUserAlert("Bacterial health critical. Consider replacement.");
    }

    delay(100ms);
}

function playBioluminescencePattern(pattern, duration) {
    // Implement various patterns (pulse, wave, static) using the LED array.
    // Utilize different LED activation sequences and timing for each pattern.
}

function setLEDBrightness(brightness) {
    // Adjust the current flowing through the LEDs to control their brightness.
}
