## Dynamic Zone Prioritization & Predictive Re-Identification

**Concept:** Expand the re-identification system beyond simple positional matching to incorporate predictive behavior and dynamic zone prioritization based on facility workflow. This anticipates user movement *before* tracking is lost, improving re-identification accuracy and reducing reliance on solely past positions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Workflow Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time data feeds from facility management systems (FMS) – inventory movements, order fulfillment schedules, shipping manifests, scheduled maintenance, employee task lists.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Zone Definition:** Divide the facility into dynamically adjustable zones based on FMS data. High-activity zones (e.g., packing stations) receive higher priority. Low-activity zones (e.g., storage aisles during off-peak hours) receive lower priority.
    *   **Workflow Prediction:** Using FMS data, predict likely user paths and destinations. Assign probability scores to potential movements.
    *   **Priority Assignment:** Assign a ‘Re-Identification Priority’ score to each zone, reflecting its importance to current workflow.

**2. Predictive Re-Identification Algorithm:**

*   **Tracking Loss Detection:** Standard tracking loss detection as in the base patent.
*   **Priority Zone Scan:** Upon tracking loss, prioritize scanning *only* zones with the highest Re-Identification Priority scores. This reduces computational load and false positives.
*   **Behavioral Prediction:**
    *   **Historical Data:** Maintain a user's historical movement patterns *within* workflow contexts.  (e.g., “User X typically moves from receiving to staging after completing pallet verification”).
    *   **Contextual Analysis:**  Analyze the user's last known activity (e.g., verifying a shipment) and the current workflow state to predict the most likely next destination.
    *   **Probability Weighting:** Assign probability weights to potential destinations based on historical data, contextual analysis, and zone priority.
*   **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from *multiple* sensor types beyond just cameras:
    *   **RFID:** Utilize RFID tags on personnel and/or equipment to provide coarse location data, especially in areas with limited visibility.
    *   **UWB (Ultra-Wideband) Positioning:** Employ UWB beacons for precise indoor positioning, providing a supplemental data source.
    *   **Thermal Imaging:** Detect personnel even in low-light conditions or obscured areas.
*   **Re-Identification Confidence Score:** Calculate a combined confidence score based on:
    *   **Pattern Matching:** Similarity of user patterns (as in the base patent).
    *   **Descriptor Matching:** Comparison of user descriptors (as in the base patent).
    *   **Workflow Probability:** Probability of the user being in the current zone based on predicted workflow.
    *   **Sensor Fusion Data:** Confidence from RFID, UWB, and thermal data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ReIdentifyUser(UserID, LastKnownPosition, ImageData)

  // 1. Get Workflow Data
  WorkflowData = GetCurrentWorkflowData()

  // 2. Calculate Zone Priorities
  ZonePriorities = CalculateZonePriorities(WorkflowData)

  // 3. Predict Likely Destinations
  LikelyDestinations = PredictDestinations(UserID, LastKnownPosition, WorkflowData)

  // 4. Prioritized Zone Scan
  ScanZones = PrioritizeZones(LikelyDestinations, ZonePriorities)

  // 5. Image Analysis (as in base patent)
  UserPatterns = AnalyzeImages(ImageData)

  // 6. Multi-Sensor Fusion
  SensorData = GetSensorData(UserID)

  // 7. Calculate Re-Identification Confidence Score
  ConfidenceScore = CalculateConfidenceScore(UserPatterns, SensorData, WorkflowData)

  // 8. Re-Identify User if Confidence exceeds Threshold
  IF ConfidenceScore > Threshold THEN
    AssociateUser(UserID, NewPosition)
    UPDATE UserPosition(UserID, NewPosition)
  ENDIF

END FUNCTION
