## Adaptive Endpoint 'Shadowing' with Predictive Failure Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the token bucket/failure rate concept to not just *react* to endpoint failures, but proactively ‘shadow’ endpoint requests, predicting potential failures before they occur and routing traffic accordingly. This isn't just about delaying calls; it's about dynamically shifting load based on predicted instability.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** ‘Shadow Router’ – s/w module inserted between clients & endpoints.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `EndpointState` – Contains:
        *   `TokenBucket` – Existing from the patent.
        *   `RequestLatencyHistory` – Rolling average of request response times.  Stores timestamps and latency values. Size: configurable.
        *   `FailurePredictionScore` – A calculated value (see algorithm).
        *   `ShadowReplicationFactor` –  Integer (0-N).  Determines how many ‘shadow’ replicas of a request are sent to alternate endpoints.
    *   `EndpointGroup` –  A logical grouping of endpoints offering the same service.
*   **Algorithm: Failure Prediction Score Calculation:**
    1.  `RecentFailureRate` = Number of failures in the last X minutes / Total requests in the last X minutes.
    2.  `LatencyTrend` =  Linear regression slope of `RequestLatencyHistory` over the last Y minutes.  (Positive slope indicates increasing latency).
    3.  `FailurePredictionScore` = `RecentFailureRate` * Weight1 + `LatencyTrend` * Weight2.  (Weights are configurable parameters).
*   **Traffic Routing Logic:**
    1.  Upon receiving a request, the Shadow Router retrieves the `EndpointState` for the target endpoint.
    2.  The `FailurePredictionScore` is evaluated.
    3.  Based on the `FailurePredictionScore` (and configurable thresholds), the `ShadowReplicationFactor` is determined.
    4.  The original request is sent to the primary endpoint.
    5.  ‘N’ identical requests are sent to alternate endpoints within the same `EndpointGroup` (the alternate endpoints are selected using a load-balancing algorithm).
    6.  The Shadow Router monitors responses from all endpoints.
    7.  The first valid response is returned to the client.  Subsequent responses are discarded.
    8.  If all requests fail, an error is returned to the client.
    9.  The `TokenBucket` is decremented upon *any* failure.
*   **Token Bucket Integration:** The existing token bucket mechanism continues to operate as a ‘safety net’. If the `TokenBucket` is depleted *before* the predictive system identifies a problem, the system reverts to delaying calls.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  The thresholds used for determining the `ShadowReplicationFactor` are dynamically adjusted based on overall system load and historical failure rates.
*   **Self-Learning:**  The system learns from past failures and adjusts the weighting factors used in the `FailurePredictionScore` calculation.  (e.g., using a reinforcement learning algorithm).

**Pseudocode (Shadow Router Core):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  endpoint = request.getTargetEndpoint()
  endpointState = getEndpointState(endpoint)
  failurePredictionScore = calculateFailurePredictionScore(endpointState)

  shadowReplicationFactor = determineShadowReplicationFactor(failurePredictionScore)

  originalRequest = cloneRequest(request)
  originalRequest.sendTo(endpoint)

  for i in range(shadowReplicationFactor):
    shadowRequest = cloneRequest(request)
    alternateEndpoint = selectAlternateEndpoint(endpoint)
    shadowRequest.sendTo(alternateEndpoint)

  responses = waitForResponses(originalRequest, shadowRequests)

  validResponse = findFirstValidResponse(responses)

  if validResponse:
    return validResponse
  else:
    return errorResponse("All requests failed")
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Geographic Distribution:** Select alternate endpoints based on geographic proximity to the client.
*   **Endpoint Capacity:** Consider the current load on alternate endpoints when selecting them.
*   **Request Type:** Adjust the `ShadowReplicationFactor` based on the criticality of the request.
