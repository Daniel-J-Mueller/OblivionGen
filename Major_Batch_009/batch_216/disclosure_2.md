## Environmental Acoustic Mapping & Predictive Filtering

**Concept:** Leverage the visual data and echo cancellation system to create a dynamic, 3D acoustic map of the environment, and use this map to *predict* echo paths *before* they occur, enabling even faster and more accurate cancellation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing camera and microphone array.
    *   Depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or structured light) integrated with the camera – crucial for 3D mapping.
    *   Increased processing power – the mapping and prediction will be computationally intensive.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **3D Environment Reconstruction:**
        *   Input: Camera (RGB & Depth) data.
        *   Process: Create a point cloud representation of the environment, identifying surfaces, objects, and free space.  Utilize SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques for real-time updates.
        *   Output:  Dynamic 3D model of the environment.
    *   **Acoustic Material Identification:**
        *   Input:  RGB data from the camera, and optionally, a material database.
        *   Process:  Employ computer vision to identify materials within the environment (e.g., carpet, wood, glass).  If a material database is available, estimate the acoustic absorption coefficient of each surface.
        *   Output:  Acoustic property map overlaid onto the 3D model.
    *   **Ray Tracing & Echo Path Prediction:**
        *   Input: 3D model with acoustic properties, microphone and speaker positions, and speaker output signal.
        *   Process: Use ray tracing algorithms to simulate sound propagation, predicting potential echo paths based on the environment geometry and material properties. Account for diffraction and reflection.  Predict echo arrival times and strengths.
        *   Output:  A list of predicted echo paths with associated time delays and amplitudes.
    *   **Predictive Filter Adaptation:**
        *   Input: Predicted echo paths, speaker output, microphone input.
        *   Process:  Adapt the acoustic echo canceller filter coefficients *before* the echoes arrive, based on the predicted paths. This requires a fast adaptation algorithm.  Blend predicted filter coefficients with those derived from real-time analysis.  Implement a confidence weighting scheme, prioritizing predicted paths with high confidence.
        *   Output: Optimized acoustic echo canceller filter coefficients.
    *   **Dynamic Map Update:**
        *   Process: Continuously update the 3D map based on new sensor data. This is essential to account for moving objects or changes in the environment. Kalman filtering or particle filtering can be used to track moving objects.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Filter Adaptation):**

```
// Variables
predicted_filter_coeffs = array of filter coefficients based on ray tracing
realtime_filter_coeffs = filter coefficients from standard AEC algorithm
confidence_score = score indicating the reliability of the predicted paths
blend_factor = function(confidence_score) // Maps confidence score to a blend weight (0-1)

function update_aec_filter():
  predicted_coeffs = calculate_predicted_filter_coeffs()
  realtime_coeffs = calculate_realtime_filter_coeffs()
  confidence = assess_prediction_confidence()
  blend = blend_factor(confidence)
  final_coeffs = (1 - blend) * realtime_coeffs + blend * predicted_coeffs
  apply_filter_coefficients(final_coeffs)
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond *reacting* to echoes to *anticipating* them. Traditional AEC relies on real-time analysis, which has inherent latency. By predicting echo paths, the system can adapt the filter *before* the echoes arrive, resulting in superior performance, especially in dynamic environments. The combination of 3D environment reconstruction, acoustic material identification, and ray tracing creates a powerful predictive model.
