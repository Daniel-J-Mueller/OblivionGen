## Adaptive Shard Prioritization & Predictive Retransmission

**Concept:** Enhance data transmission reliability and efficiency by not just retransmitting lost shards *after* detection, but by *predictively* prioritizing shard transmission based on real-time network health and historical loss patterns, coupled with a dynamic shard importance weighting.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Predictive Transmission Manager (PTM) – implemented as a parallel process to the existing Transmission Manager.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Network Health Metrics: Real-time RTT, packet loss rate, bandwidth availability (from OS/network interface).
    *   Historical Loss Data: Per-shard loss rates collected over a rolling window (e.g., last 5 minutes).
    *   Shard Importance Weights: A dynamic weighting assigned to each shard, reflecting its contribution to decoding (e.g., shards containing critical header info have higher weights). These weights are initially uniform but evolve based on reconstruction feedback.
    *   Telemetry from Reconstruction Manager: Acknowledgements of successful reconstruction, requests for retransmission, and optional quality metrics (e.g., decoded signal strength).
*   **Algorithm:**

    1.  **Shard Prioritization:** Calculate a “transmission priority score” for each shard:

        `Priority Score = (1 / Historical Loss Rate) * Shard Importance Weight * (1 + Network Instability Factor)`

        *   Network Instability Factor = `σ(RTT)`, where σ is the standard deviation of Round Trip Time, representing network jitter.
    2.  **Dynamic Shard Allocation:**  Instead of transmitting shards sequentially or randomly, allocate bandwidth proportionally to the priority scores.  Higher scores get larger bandwidth slices.
    3.  **Predictive Retransmission:** If a shard’s historical loss rate *exceeds* a threshold, proactively retransmit it *before* receiving a negative acknowledgement.  Adjust the retransmission frequency based on network conditions.
    4.  **Feedback Loop:** The Reconstruction Manager provides feedback on successful reconstruction. This feedback updates the Shard Importance Weights. If reconstruction frequently fails despite retransmissions, increase the weight of problematic shards.
    5.  **Erasure Coding Scheme Selection:** Incorporate a selection algorithm for different erasure coding schemes (e.g., Reed-Solomon, Cauchy Reed-Solomon, XOR-based codes) based on the network condition and data characteristics.

*   **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    // Initialization
    historicalLossRates = {} // dictionary to store loss rate per shard
    shardImportanceWeights = {} // dictionary to store weight per shard (initially 1.0)
    erasureCodingScheme = defaultScheme()

    // Main Loop
    For each shard in encodedData:
        calculatePriorityScore(shard) // Based on historical loss, importance, and network stability
        bandwidthAllocation = calculateBandwidth(priorityScore)

        If networkCondition is poor:
            selectErasureCodingScheme(poorNetworkCondition) // switch to a more robust scheme

        transmitShard(shard, bandwidthAllocation)

        Upon receiving ACK from Reconstruction Manager:
            updateHistoricalLossRates(shard, ACK)
            updateShardImportanceWeights(shard, reconstructionQuality)

    If reconstruction fails:
        retransmitShards(requestShards, calculateRetransmissionFrequency())
    ```

*   **Hardware/Software Requirements:**
    *   Requires modification to the existing Transmission Manager and Reconstruction Manager.
    *   Additional processing power for the PTM.
    *   Increased memory for storing historical loss data.
*   **Potential Benefits:**
    *   Reduced retransmission overhead.
    *   Improved overall throughput.
    *   Enhanced reliability in challenging network environments.
    *   Adaptive erasure coding scheme selection based on network condition.
