## Adaptive Credential ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Revocation

**Concept:** Extend the revocation period concept to *predict* potential access issues *before* a credential is formally revoked, and introduce a ‘shadowing’ system where a temporary, limited-functionality credential is automatically generated for users exhibiting potentially problematic behavior.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on graceful degradation *during* revocation. This builds upon that by proactively anticipating issues and offering a stopgap, minimizing disruption. It shifts from reactive to preventative.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** System logs (access attempts, resource utilization, API calls), user activity data, threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Process:** Employ machine learning (anomaly detection, predictive modeling) to identify users exhibiting unusual patterns.
    *   Indicators: Increased failed access attempts, access to sensitive data outside normal patterns, rapid sequential access to multiple resources, unusual geographic locations, time-of-day anomalies.
    *   Scoring System: Assign a ‘risk score’ to each user based on weighted factors.
*   **Output:**  Risk score, flagged users, triggering thresholds.

**2. Predictive Revocation Engine:**

*   **Input:**  User risk score, pre-defined revocation policies (e.g., revoke after 3 failed MFA attempts, revoke after accessing restricted data).
*   **Process:** Based on risk score and policies, determine a ‘revocation probability’ and a ‘pre-revocation period’.
    *   Pre-revocation period: A time window *before* formal revocation begins.
    *   Revocation probability: Reflects the likelihood of eventual revocation.  Higher probability = more aggressive pre-revocation actions.
*   **Output:**  Pre-revocation status for each user, parameters for credential shadowing.

**3. Credential Shadowing System:**

*   **Process:** When a user enters the pre-revocation period (based on predictive revocation), a ‘shadow credential’ is automatically generated.
    *   **Functionality:** The shadow credential grants access to *essential* resources only.  (Defined by administrator policy – think core productivity apps, basic email).  All other access is blocked or requires explicit approval.
    *   **Notification:** The user is notified of the change in access (with a clear explanation of why) and a timeframe for restoring full access (pending investigation).  The notification can include a link to a self-service portal for requesting access or providing information.
    *   **Monitoring:** All activity using the shadow credential is logged and closely monitored.  Any suspicious activity triggers an immediate alert and potential escalation.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `shadow_credential_lifetime`:  Maximum duration of the shadow credential (e.g., 24 hours).
    *   `essential_resource_list`:  List of resources accessible with the shadow credential.
    *   `alert_threshold`:  Activity level that triggers an immediate alert.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function analyze_user_activity(user_id, logs):
  risk_score = calculate_risk_score(logs)
  return risk_score

function apply_predictive_revocation(user_id, risk_score):
  if risk_score > threshold:
    pre_revocation_status = True
    create_shadow_credential(user_id)
    return pre_revocation_status
  else:
    return False

function create_shadow_credential(user_id):
  shadow_cred = generate_temp_credential()
  grant_access(shadow_cred, essential_resource_list)
  notify_user(user_id, "Credential update - limited access")
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserRiskProfile`:  `{user_id, risk_score, pre_revocation_status, shadow_credential_id}`
*   `Policy`: `{revocation_threshold, essential_resource_list, shadow_credential_lifetime}`

This system offers a proactive approach to credential management, minimizing disruption and improving security posture by identifying and mitigating potential risks *before* a formal revocation is necessary. It’s a shift from responding to incidents to *anticipating* them.
