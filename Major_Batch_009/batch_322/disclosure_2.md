## Dynamic Haptic Layering for 3D Displays

**Concept:** Extend the visual 3D layering demonstrated in the patent to include a dynamically adjustable haptic feedback layer, creating a more immersive and intuitive user experience. Instead of solely relying on visual depth cues, users would *feel* the depth and texture of displayed content.

**Specifications:**

*   **Display Hardware:** Requires a display capable of rendering the visual 3D layering described in the patent *and* an integrated or closely coupled ultrasonic haptic array. This array will generate localized pressure waves, simulating textures and depth. Resolution of the haptic array must match or exceed the visual resolution to avoid dissonance.
*   **Software Architecture:** A middleware layer interfacing between applications and the display hardware. This layer will translate visual depth data into haptic feedback instructions.
*   **Data Structures:** A “Haptic Plane” structure mirroring the “Plane of Content” described in the patent, containing:
    *   `planeID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `visualData`: Pointer to visual content data.
    *   `hapticData`: Data representing the texture and depth profile of the content (e.g., a height map or a procedural texture definition).
    *   `depthValue`: Floating-point value representing the perceived depth of the plane.
    *   `hapticIntensity`: Floating-point value controlling the strength of the haptic feedback.
    *   `surfaceMaterial`: Enum defining the material properties (e.g., soft, hard, rough, smooth).
*   **Algorithm – Haptic Rendering Pipeline:**
    1.  **Depth Map Generation:** For each “Haptic Plane”, derive a depth map from the `hapticData` or procedurally generate one based on the `surfaceMaterial`.
    2.  **Raycasting & Collision Detection:** Simulate rays originating from the user's hand/finger position (tracked via camera as in the patent) and intersecting with the “Haptic Planes.”
    3.  **Haptic Feedback Calculation:** Based on the intersection point, distance, and `surfaceMaterial`, calculate the amplitude and frequency of the ultrasonic waves to generate at the corresponding location on the haptic array.
    4.  **Waveform Synthesis & Emission:** Synthesize the ultrasonic waveform and emit it through the haptic array.
    5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update the waveform based on the user's hand/finger movements and changes in the displayed content.

    ```pseudocode
    function renderHapticScene(sceneData, userPosition):
      for each plane in sceneData.planes:
        depthMap = generateDepthMap(plane.hapticData, plane.surfaceMaterial)
        intersectionPoint = raycast(userPosition, depthMap)
        if intersectionPoint != null:
          amplitude = calculateAmplitude(intersectionPoint.distance)
          frequency = calculateFrequency(plane.surfaceMaterial)
          emitHapticWave(intersectionPoint.x, intersectionPoint.y, amplitude, frequency)
    ```

*   **User Interface:** A calibration tool to adjust haptic intensity and material properties to individual user preferences. This allows for customization and prevents fatigue.
*   **Applications:**
    *   **Interactive 3D Modeling:** Users can *feel* the shape of virtual objects, enabling more precise and intuitive sculpting.
    *   **Medical Imaging:** Surgeons can explore 3D medical scans with haptic feedback, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
    *   **Gaming:** Immersive gaming experiences with realistic tactile sensations.
    *   **Accessibility:** Providing tactile feedback for visually impaired users.
