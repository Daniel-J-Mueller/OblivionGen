## Dynamic Degradation Profiles & Scent Integration

**Core Concept:** Expand the degradation aspect beyond simple visual fading. Introduce dynamically adjustable degradation *profiles* and integrate scent delivery synchronized with the visual degradation. This allows for a more immersive, multi-sensory preview experience and opens up possibilities for artistic expression beyond the visual.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Degradation Profile Editor (Software):**
    *   Allows artists/creators to define custom degradation curves for their artwork. Parameters:
        *   *Visual Degradation Rate:*  Adjustable curve defining how quickly the printed image fades/changes over time. Includes options for linear, exponential, stepped, or custom curve input.
        *   *Scent Release Profile:* Defines how and when specific scents are released in conjunction with visual degradation.  Includes timing (tied to visual degradation stages), intensity, and scent layering.
        *   *Material Degradation Options:* Selection of specialized printing materials capable of programmed degradation (see Material Specs).
        *   *AR Trigger Points:*  Define specific visual degradation stages that trigger unique augmented reality experiences within the viewing application.
2.  **Specialized Printing Materials:**
    *   *Micro-Encapsulated Scents:*  Printing inks containing micro-capsules filled with scents.  Capsules rupture as the ink degrades, releasing the scent. Different capsules for layered scent profiles.
    *   *Photochromic/Thermochromic Inks:* Incorporate inks that change color based on light or temperature, creating dynamic visual effects during degradation.  Controlled release via material composition.
    *   *Biodegradable Substrates:* Utilize biodegradable paper/canvas with programmed decomposition rates. Decomposition rate is tied to the visual/scent degradation profile.
3.  **Augmented Reality Application Enhancements:**
    *   *Scent-AR Integration:* Application detects the scents released from the degrading sample and alters the AR experience accordingly (visual filters, soundscapes).
    *   *Real-Time Degradation Tracking:*  Application uses computer vision to analyze the degradation state of the sample and dynamically adjusts the AR overlay and available interactions.
    *   *AR ‘Undo’ Function:*  AR application overlays a ‘ghost’ image of the original artwork based on degradation tracking, allowing the user to visualize the original piece alongside its current degraded state.
4.  **Hardware – ‘Scent Diffuser’ Attachment (Optional):**
    *   Small, clip-on diffuser attachment for the sample.  Contains reservoirs for additional scents and a micro-fan to enhance scent projection. Controlled by the AR application.
    *   Diffuser utilizes a database of scents that correspond to the AR application, such that scents released correspond to the current image in the AR space.

**Pseudocode (AR Application – Scent Detection & AR Alteration):**

```
function onSampleDetected() {
  startScentDetection();
  startDegradationTracking();
}

function startScentDetection() {
  // Use sensor data (if available) to detect released scents
  detectedScents = scentSensor.read();

  // Analyze detected scents to identify the scent profile
  currentScentProfile = analyzeScents(detectedScents);

  // Alter AR experience based on scent profile
  if (currentScentProfile == "ocean_breeze") {
    applyARFilter("ocean_waves");
    playSound("seagulls");
  } else if (currentScentProfile == "forest_pine") {
    applyARFilter("sun_dappled_forest");
    playSound("birds_chirping");
  }
}

function startDegradationTracking() {
  // Use computer vision to analyze the visual state of the sample
  degradationLevel = vision.analyze(sampleImage);

  // Adjust AR overlay based on degradation level
  if (degradationLevel > 0.75) {
    displayMessage("Artwork nearing end of life. Consider purchasing the original.");
  }
}
```

This system offers an expanded immersive experience, allowing for artistic expression beyond the visual realm. The dynamically adjustable degradation profiles and scent integration create a unique and memorable preview experience, potentially driving higher conversion rates for art purchases.
