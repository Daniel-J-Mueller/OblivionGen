## Secure Proximity-Based WPS with Dynamic Credential Rotation

**Concept:** Expand upon the secure WPS exchange by incorporating ultra-wideband (UWB) proximity detection *before* initiating the PIN exchange, and dynamically rotating the credential provided to the client device after successful connection. This tackles potential man-in-the-middle attacks and enhances long-term security.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Access Point (AP):** Standard 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax AP with integrated UWB transceiver.
*   **Client Device:** Device initiating WPS connection with integrated UWB transceiver.
*   **Secure Element (SE):** Both AP and Client Device possess a SE for secure key storage and cryptographic operations.

**2. Software/Firmware Components:**

*   **UWB Proximity Module:** Firmware on both AP and Client Device responsible for UWB ranging and proximity determination.
*   **WPS Module:** Existing WPS implementation with modifications to integrate UWB proximity check and dynamic credential rotation.
*   **Credential Management Module:** Responsible for generating, storing, and rotating credentials.
*   **Secure Communication Channel:** Utilizes TLS 1.3 for all communication between AP and client following UWB proximity verification.

**3. Operational Sequence:**

1.  **UWB Proximity Check:** Client Device initiates UWB ranging towards the AP. If the measured distance is within a defined threshold (e.g., 2 meters), proximity is confirmed.  This prevents remote WPS attacks.
2.  **Secure Channel Establishment:** Upon successful UWB proximity check, a secure TLS 1.3 connection is established between the Client Device and the AP.
3.  **PIN Exchange (Modified):** The server (cloud-based) generates a PIN as in the original patent.  This PIN is *encrypted with the APâ€™s public key* and transmitted *directly to the AP* over the secure TLS 1.3 channel. The AP then relays this encrypted PIN to the client device (still via the secure channel) as before.
4.  **PIN Verification:** Client device decrypts the PIN and continues the standard WPS-PIN message exchange with the AP.
5.  **Credential Generation & Delivery:**  Upon successful authentication, the AP generates a *unique, time-limited* credential (a WPA3-SAE passphrase and SSID) specific to the client device. This credential is *not* the standard network passphrase, but a separate, dynamically generated key.
6.  **Credential Rotation:** The AP implements a scheduled rotation of the dynamically generated credential (e.g., every 24 hours).  The client device receives the new credential automatically over the secure TLS 1.3 channel.  The previous credential is invalidated.
7.  **Fallback Mechanism:** If UWB ranging fails, WPS connection attempts are blocked.
8. **Threat Prevention**: If a rogue AP attempts the WPS exchange, it cannot establish proximity, therefore cannot initiate the exchange, even if the client attempts to initiate the connection.

**4. Pseudocode (Credential Rotation):**

```pseudocode
// AP side
function generateCredential(clientID):
  credential = generateRandomKey()
  storeCredential(clientID, credential, expirationTimestamp)
  return credential

function rotateCredentials():
  for each clientID in clientList:
    newCredential = generateCredential(clientID)
    sendNewCredentialToClient(clientID, newCredential)
    invalidateOldCredential(clientID)

// Client side
function receiveNewCredential(credential):
  storeCredential(credential)
  // Use new credential for subsequent communication

// Background task on AP:
every 24 hours:
  rotateCredentials()
```

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   UWB ranging is susceptible to replay attacks. Implement countermeasures such as timestamps and nonces.
*   Secure key storage on both AP and Client Device is crucial. Utilize hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure elements.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing are essential.
*   The dynamic credential rotation minimizes the window of opportunity for attackers to compromise the network.

**Novelty:**

This approach differs from the referenced patent by adding a physical proximity requirement (UWB) for initiation, moving the PIN encryption to the AP itself, and implementing a dynamic credential rotation mechanism. This significantly enhances security and reduces the attack surface compared to traditional WPS methods. The separation of the network passphrase and the dynamically generated credential also provides an additional layer of security.
