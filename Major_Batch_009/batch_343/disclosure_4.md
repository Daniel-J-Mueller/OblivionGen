## Dynamic Condition Escalation & Automated Negotiation

**Concept:** Expand upon the pre-order/marketplace matching system to incorporate a dynamic condition escalation and automated negotiation layer. Currently, the patent focuses on a simple match of minimum acceptable condition and price. This expands it to handle situations where a *close* match exists but requires negotiation, or where the condition is initially unacceptable but could be improved through a service offering.

**Specifications:**

**1. Condition Scoring System:**

*   **Data Input:** Integrate a standardized condition scoring system (1-10, 10 being pristine) based on visual AI analysis (user-submitted photos/videos) and user-reported details.  AI will analyze images for visible defects, wear, and tear.
*   **Condition Categories:** Define granular condition categories beyond “acceptable”/“unacceptable” (e.g., “Like New,” “Excellent,” “Good,” “Acceptable,” “Needs Repair”).
*   **Weighted Factors:** Implement a weighted scoring system. Weights will vary by product category (e.g., cosmetic condition is more important for clothing than for tools).
*   **AI-Assisted Scoring:** Use AI to automatically suggest a condition score based on uploaded media, which the seller can adjust.

**2. Automated Negotiation Engine:**

*   **Proximity Matching:** When a pre-order/marketplace listing *almost* matches, the engine activates. “Almost” is defined by a configurable threshold (e.g., condition score within 2 points, price within 5%).
*   **Negotiation Parameters:**  Buyers and Sellers define acceptable negotiation ranges *during* listing creation. (e.g. “I’m willing to increase my price by $10 for excellent condition”).
*   **Automated Offers:** The system automatically generates counter-offers based on the defined ranges.  The goal is a mutually acceptable price & condition.
*   **Conditional Negotiation:** Introduce “conditional” offers. E.g., “I will accept the item if it is professionally cleaned.”
*   **Negotiation History:** Maintain a complete negotiation history for each listing.

**3.  Condition Improvement Services Integration:**

*   **Service Directory:** Maintain a directory of vetted condition improvement services (e.g., cleaning, repair, refurbishment) with associated pricing.
*   **Service Offers:**  If condition is unacceptable, the system automatically offers quotes from relevant service providers. The cost of the service is factored into the final price.
*   **Automated Service Booking:**  If accepted, the system automatically books the service (with seller approval).
*   **Service Tracking:** Track the service progress.

**4.  Smart Pre-order Adjustment:**

*   **Dynamic Price Adjustment:** If pre-order demand exceeds supply, the system will automatically adjust pre-order pricing upwards (within predefined limits) to incentivize more sellers to list.
*   **Condition Tiering:** Introduce condition tiers for pre-orders.  Buyers can choose to pay a premium for a guaranteed higher condition item.

**Pseudocode (Negotiation Engine Core):**

```
FUNCTION negotiate(preorder, marketplaceListing):

    conditionDifference = ABS(preorder.minimumCondition - marketplaceListing.condition)
    priceDifference = ABS(preorder.maximumPrice - marketplaceListing.price)

    IF conditionDifference <= conditionThreshold AND priceDifference <= priceThreshold:
        RETURN "Match Found! Transact Sale."

    ELSE IF conditionDifference <= escalationThreshold AND priceDifference <= escalationThreshold:
        // Attempt Automated Negotiation
        newPrice = marketplaceListing.price + (preorder.maximumPrice - marketplaceListing.price) * negotiationFactor
        IF newPrice <= preorder.maximumPrice:
            RETURN "Counter Offer: Price = " + newPrice + ", Condition = " + marketplaceListing.condition
        ELSE:
            RETURN "No Agreement Possible"

    ELSE:
        RETURN "No Match Possible"
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Preorder`:  `preorderId`, `productId`, `userId`, `maximumPrice`, `minimumCondition`
*   `MarketplaceListing`: `listingId`, `productId`, `userId`, `price`, `condition`, `listingType` (fixed/auction)
*   `Service`: `serviceId`, `serviceName`, `serviceDescription`, `pricePerUnit`, `estimatedTurnaroundTime`
