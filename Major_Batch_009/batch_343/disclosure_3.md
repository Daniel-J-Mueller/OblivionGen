## Adaptive Task Decomposition & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the historical execution data analysis to *decompose* tasks into sub-tasks.  Instead of optimizing parameters for a monolithic task, predict how a task *could* be broken down and allocate resources to those sub-tasks *proactively* based on historical performance of similar sub-task patterns.

**Specs:**

**1. Sub-Task Pattern Library:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing common task decomposition patterns. Nodes represent sub-tasks, edges represent dependencies.
*   **Generation:**  Automatically generated by analyzing execution traces of completed tasks.  Algorithm identifies frequently occurring sub-task sequences.  Similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity on operation vectors) used to group and cluster sub-task patterns.
*   **Metadata:** Each pattern stores historical performance data: average execution time, resource usage (CPU, memory, network), cost. Also tracks *variance* in performance.
*   **Versioning:**  Pattern versions maintained to track performance improvements over time.

**2. Task Decomposition Engine:**

*   **Input:** New task specification.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Feature Extraction:** Analyze task specification to extract key features (e.g., data size, algorithm type, data complexity).
    2.  **Pattern Matching:**  Compare extracted features to patterns in the Sub-Task Pattern Library.  Use a weighted scoring system to rank potential decompositions.
    3.  **Decomposition Selection:** Choose the highest-ranked decomposition.  Optionally, allow the user to override the automatic selection.
    4.  **Dependency Graph Creation:** Construct a dependency graph based on the selected decomposition pattern.

**3. Predictive Resource Allocator:**

*   **Input:** Dependency graph, historical performance data for sub-tasks.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Sub-Task Resource Estimation:** For each sub-task, estimate resource requirements (CPU, memory, network) based on historical performance.  Use a statistical model (e.g., Gaussian process regression) to account for uncertainty.
    2.  **Parallelization Analysis:**  Identify sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel.
    3.  **Resource Allocation:**  Allocate resources to sub-tasks based on estimated requirements and parallelization opportunities.  Use a constraint optimization algorithm (e.g., linear programming) to minimize cost or completion time subject to resource constraints.
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Monitor execution progress and dynamically adjust resource allocation as needed.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation):**

```
function allocateResources(dependencyGraph, historicalData, resourcePool):
    subTaskResourceEstimates = estimateSubTaskResources(dependencyGraph, historicalData)
    
    #Identify parallelizable tasks.
    parallelizableTasks = findParallelizableTasks(dependencyGraph)

    # Create optimization problem
    problem = OptimizationProblem()

    # Define objective function (e.g., minimize cost)
    problem.setObjective(minimizeCost)

    # Add constraints (resource availability)
    for resource in resourcePool:
        problem.addConstraint(resourceUsage <= resourceAvailability)

    # Solve optimization problem
    solution = problem.solve()

    # Allocate resources to sub-tasks
    for subTask, allocation in solution.items():
        allocate(subTask, allocation)

    return solution
```

**4. Feedback Loop:**

*   Monitor the performance of executed sub-tasks.
*   Update the historical performance data in the Sub-Task Pattern Library.
*   Refine the statistical models used for resource estimation.
*   Continuously improve the accuracy of the predictive resource allocator.
