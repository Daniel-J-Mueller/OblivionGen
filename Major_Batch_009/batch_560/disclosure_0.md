## Dynamic Calibration Target Array - Projected Light Field

**Concept:** Instead of a single, static light source for calibration, implement a dense array of micro-projectors integrated *within* the stereo rig housing. These projectors dynamically create a 3D light field – a volume of light – visible to both cameras. This allows for calibration *at multiple depths simultaneously* and accounts for subtle shifts in camera alignment due to vibration or thermal expansion.

**Specs:**

*   **Projector Array:** 5x5 array of micro-projectors (e.g., MEMS-based or micro-LED) embedded within the stereo rig housing, positioned to project light forward, covering the expected operating range of the stereo system. Projectors are individually addressable.
*   **Light Pattern Generation:** Each projector is capable of projecting a variety of patterns:
    *   **Structured Light:** Traditional grid patterns for initial calibration and disparity map generation.
    *   **Random Dot Patterns:** For more robust feature detection, reducing ambiguity.
    *   **Volumetric Features:**  Projectors create 3D features (cubes, spheres, etc.) within the light field, providing unambiguous points for calibration at different depths. These are constructed by coordinating multiple projectors.
    *   **Dynamic Reticles:**  Projectors can project reticles with varying shapes and sizes, adjustable in real-time, onto the target surface.
*   **Calibration Software:**
    *   **Automated Sequence:** Software automatically cycles through different light patterns and depths.
    *   **Feature Extraction:**  Algorithms detect and track the projected features in both camera images.
    *   **Error Metric:**  A cost function minimizes the reprojection error between the projected 3D points and their detected positions in the camera images.
    *   **Adaptive Projection:**  The software adapts the projection pattern based on the detected scene geometry – projecting more features in areas with low texture.
*   **Housing Integration:**
    *   **Micro-Lens Array:** A micro-lens array placed over the projector array to further shape and focus the light field.
    *   **Diffuser:** A diffuser to reduce speckle and ensure uniform illumination.
*   **Synchronization:** Precise synchronization between the projector array, cameras, and processing unit is critical. This can be achieved using hardware triggers and time stamping.

**Pseudocode (Calibration Routine):**

```
//Initialization
Initialize Cameras
Initialize Projector Array
Sync Cameras and Projectors

//Calibration Loop
For depth = minDepth to maxDepth step depthIncrement:
    For patternType in [Grid, RandomDots, VolumetricFeature]:
        Project Pattern onto Target at Current Depth
        Capture Images from Both Cameras
        Extract Features from Images
        Calculate Reprojection Error
        Update Calibration Parameters (Minimize Error)
    End For
End For

//Refinement Phase (Optional):
Project Complex Volumetric Features
Refine Calibration Parameters
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Accuracy:** Calibration at multiple depths improves accuracy.
*   **Robustness to Vibration:** The dynamic nature of the calibration target reduces the impact of vibration.
*   **Real-Time Calibration:** Enables continuous calibration, adapting to changing environmental conditions.
*   **Improved Depth Map Quality:**  More accurate calibration results in higher quality depth maps.
*   **Self-Calibration:**  System can potentially self-calibrate without external targets.
