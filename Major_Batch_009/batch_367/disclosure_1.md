## Automated Endpoint Device 'Personality' Injection via Current Modulation

**Concept:** Expand the current modulation technique beyond simple identification to enable a form of temporary 'personality' injection into endpoint devices. This allows for dynamic reconfiguration of device behavior *without* requiring traditional software updates or network configuration changes. Think of it as transient firmware or behavior patching delivered via power line signaling.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   POE Injector Modification: The POE injector will need an enhanced modulation capability. It must be able to generate *complex* current modulation patterns â€“ not just simple on/off or repeating sequences. This demands a higher bandwidth and precision in the current shaping circuitry.
    *   Endpoint Device Receiver:  Each endpoint device needs a dedicated analog front-end (AFE) to accurately *decode* these complex modulation patterns. This AFE should include a high-resolution ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) and a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) for pattern recognition.  A low-power ARM Cortex-M series microcontroller is suitable for implementing the DSP logic.
    *   Memory: Each endpoint device requires a small amount of non-volatile memory (e.g., SPI flash) to store a limited set of 'behavior profiles'. These profiles are activated based on the decoded modulation patterns.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Profile Definition:  A system for defining 'behavior profiles'. These profiles consist of sets of parameter adjustments that modify device operation (e.g., reporting frequency, sensor sensitivity, alarm thresholds, LED brightness, processing algorithms).
    *   Modulation Encoding:  An algorithm for encoding behavior profile IDs into complex current modulation patterns. This must be robust to noise and interference on the power line.  Consider using Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) or a similar spread-spectrum technique.
    *   Endpoint Device Decoder: Firmware running on the endpoint device that decodes the incoming modulation pattern, retrieves the corresponding behavior profile from memory, and applies the profile's parameters.  The DSP handles the pattern recognition and profile selection.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Controller-to-Injector: The controller sends a command to the POE injector, specifying the target endpoint device (identified via standard methods like MAC address) and the ID of the behavior profile to inject.
    *   Injector Modulation: The POE injector generates the complex current modulation pattern encoding the behavior profile ID and transmits it over the power line.
    *   Endpoint Device Reception: The endpoint device receives and decodes the modulation pattern, retrieves the profile, and applies it.

**Pseudocode (Endpoint Device):**

```
function onCurrentChange(currentValue) {
  // Read current value from analog front-end
  decodedPattern = decodeCurrentPattern(currentValue);

  if (decodedPattern != null) {
    profileID = decodedPattern.profileID;

    if (profileExists(profileID)) {
      loadProfile(profileID);
      applyProfileParameters();
    } else {
      // Log error or revert to default profile
      logError("Invalid profile ID: " + profileID);
      loadDefaultProfile();
      applyProfileParameters();
    }
  }
}

function loadDefaultProfile() {
  // Load default profile from flash memory
}

function loadProfile(profileID) {
  // Load profile from flash memory based on profileID
}

function applyProfileParameters() {
  // Apply parameters from loaded profile to device settings
  // Example: sensorSensitivity = profile.sensorSensitivity
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Dynamic Sensor Calibration:** Adjust sensor sensitivity in real-time to compensate for environmental changes.
*   **Temporary Feature Activation:** Enable or disable features on demand without firmware updates.
*   **Emergency Mode:** Immediately switch devices into a low-power, critical-reporting mode during an emergency.
*   **A/B Testing:** Deploy different behavior profiles to a subset of devices for testing purposes.
*   **Adaptive Security:**  Dynamically adjust security settings based on detected threats.
