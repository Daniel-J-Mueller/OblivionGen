## Dynamic Inventory Holder ‘Swarming’ & Predictive Staging

**Concept:** Extend the system to support a ‘swarm’ of mobile drive units (MDUs) and inventory holders (IHs). Rather than direct assignment of IHs to specific storage locations, predict demand and *proactively stage* IHs near anticipated pick-up points. This moves beyond reactive retrieval to anticipatory positioning, minimizing travel time and maximizing throughput.

**Specs:**

*   **MDU Fleet:** Minimum 10 MDUs operating concurrently. MDUs must be equipped with:
    *   High-precision indoor localization (UWB, LiDAR-SLAM preferred).
    *   Real-time communication with central management module.
    *   Collision avoidance system.
    *   Secure IH locking mechanism.
*   **IH Identification:** Each IH must have a unique, machine-readable identifier (RFID, QR code).
*   **Demand Prediction Module:**  Machine learning model trained on historical inventory request data (item, quantity, time of day, day of week, seasonality, external factors). Outputs predicted request probability for each inventory item, at each inventory station, for a specified time horizon (e.g., next 30 minutes).
*   **‘Heat Map’ Generation:**  Convert predicted request probabilities into a ‘heat map’ overlaid onto the facility layout.  Indicates areas of high anticipated demand.
*   **Staging Zones:** Define a set of ‘staging zones’ within the facility – areas optimized for MDU maneuvering and temporary IH parking.
*   **Dynamic Assignment Algorithm:**  Algorithm responsible for assigning IHs to staging zones based on:
    *   Predicted demand for items stored on the IH.
    *   Current location of the IH.
    *   Available capacity within staging zones.
    *   MDU availability.
    *   A ‘cooldown’ period to prevent IHs from being immediately re-requested after a pick.
*   **MDU Routing:**  Algorithm for calculating optimal routes for MDUs to/from staging zones and inventory stations. Considers real-time traffic conditions and MDU fleet status.
*   **IH ‘Swarming’ Behavior:** Implement a ‘swarming’ algorithm where MDUs coordinate to efficiently distribute IHs to anticipated demand zones. MDUs ‘communicate’ (via central module) to avoid congestion and optimize coverage.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Assignment Algorithm):**

```
function assignIH(IH, current_location, predicted_demand, staging_zones, MDUs):
    // Calculate ‘demand score’ for each staging zone based on predicted demand
    for each staging_zone in staging_zones:
        demand_score = sum(predicted_demand[item] for item in IH.items if item in staging_zone.items)

    // Filter out staging zones that are at capacity
    available_zones = [zone for zone in staging_zones if zone.capacity > zone.occupancy]

    // If no zones are available, return. (IH stays where it is)
    if len(available_zones) == 0:
        return

    // Calculate ‘cost’ of moving IH to each available zone (distance, MDU availability)
    for each zone in available_zones:
        cost = distance(current_location, zone.location) + MDU_wait_time(zone)

    // Select zone with lowest total cost (demand_score - cost)
    best_zone = min(available_zones, key=lambda zone: (zone.demand_score - cost))

    // Assign MDU to pick up IH
    assign_MDU(IH, best_zone)
```

**Expansion Points:**

*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Analyze MDU and IH usage data to predict maintenance needs and schedule proactive repairs.
*   **Multi-Facility Coordination:** Extend the system to coordinate inventory across multiple facilities.
*   **Integration with Warehouse Control System (WCS):** Integrate with existing WCS for seamless operation.
*   **Autonomous Rebalancing:** Develop algorithms for autonomously rebalancing inventory across the facility based on demand patterns.
