## Adaptive Proximity-Based Skill/Hobby Matching & Micro-Mentorship

**Concept:** Expand the proximity detection & commonality identification to encompass skills, hobbies, and desired learning areas, facilitating spontaneous, short-form mentorship ("micro-mentorship") opportunities. Instead of *recommending* goods/services based on commonalities, actively connect users for immediate, practical knowledge exchange.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:**
    *   User Profile: Explicitly stated skills (proficiency level tagged - beginner, intermediate, expert), hobbies, areas of interest for learning (desired skills).  Also, a "mentorship availability" flag (on/off, time preferences).
    *   Location Data: Real-time location from devices.
    *   Activity Data (Optional): Integration with device sensors (e.g., accelerometer to detect someone is actively engaged in a hobby like running or painting) to infer current skills in use.

*   **Proximity Calculation:**
    *   Geographic Proximity:  Standard distance calculation.
    *   Skill/Hobby Proximity: A weighted scoring system based on matching skills/hobbies. Higher weight for rarer skills, or skills explicitly marked as "mentorship offered" in the user profile.  Also, weighting for *complementary* skills (e.g., someone skilled in electrical engineering + someone skilled in industrial design).
    *   Mentorship Availability:  Factor in user-defined availability windows.

*   **Matching Algorithm:**
    1.  Receive location data from a user (Device A).
    2.  Identify other devices (Devices B, C, D) within a configurable radius.
    3.  Retrieve user profiles for Devices B, C, D.
    4.  Calculate a "Match Score" for each device, combining:
        *   Geographic Proximity Score
        *   Skill/Hobby Match Score
        *   Availability Score
    5.  Present top matches to the user of Device A, ranked by Match Score. Display relevant skills/hobbies and an estimated duration of potential mentorship exchange (e.g., "5-minute quick tip", "30-minute focused session").

*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   In-app messaging system with pre-defined "quick exchange" requests (e.g., "Can you show me how to [task]?", "I'm stuck on [problem], can you help?").
    *   Optional video/audio call integration for real-time support.
    *   A rating/review system for mentorship exchanges to ensure quality and accountability.

*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function find_micro_mentors(user_location, user_profile) {
  nearby_devices = get_nearby_devices(user_location, radius);
  potential_mentors = [];

  for (device in nearby_devices) {
    mentor_profile = get_user_profile(device);

    if (mentor_profile.mentorship_availability == TRUE) {
      match_score = calculate_match_score(user_profile, mentor_profile);

      if (match_score > threshold) {
        potential_mentors.push({device: device, score: match_score});
      }
    }
  }

  potential_mentors.sort(by score descending);
  return potential_mentors;
}

function calculate_match_score(user_profile, mentor_profile) {
  geo_score = calculate_geo_score(user_profile.location, mentor_profile.location);
  skill_score = calculate_skill_score(user_profile.skills, mentor_profile.skills);
  availability_score = calculate_availability_score(user_profile.availability, mentor_profile.availability);

  return (geo_score * weight_geo) + (skill_score * weight_skill) + (availability_score * weight_availability);
}
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Existing GPS/location-aware mobile devices.

*   **Potential Applications:** On-demand learning, skill-sharing communities, emergency assistance (e.g., connecting someone with first aid knowledge), spontaneous collaboration.
