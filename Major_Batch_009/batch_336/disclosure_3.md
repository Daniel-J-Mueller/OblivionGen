## Dynamic Translation Confidence Mapping & Proactive Re-Translation

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on scoring translations *after* review. This expands on that by predicting translation quality *before* widespread deployment and proactively triggering re-translation requests based on user interaction and predicted confidence levels. It moves beyond static scoring to a dynamic, predictive system that adapts to user behavior and content complexity.

**Specs:**

**1. Content Chunking & Complexity Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw content (text, potentially other media with associated text).
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide content into granular "chunks" (sentences, short paragraphs – configurable).
    *   Analyze each chunk for linguistic complexity:
        *   Sentence length.
        *   Rare/uncommon words (using a constantly updated lexicon).
        *   Use of idioms/figurative language.
        *   Technical jargon (identified via keyword lists & potentially external knowledge graphs).
    *   Assign a "Complexity Score" (0-100) to each chunk. Higher = more complex.
*   **Output:** List of content chunks with associated Complexity Scores.

**2. Initial Translation Confidence Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Content chunks with Complexity Scores, Target Language.
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize a Machine Learning (ML) model (e.g., a regression model or a neural network) trained on a dataset of translated content with associated quality scores (from human review, as in the base patent).
    *   Model inputs: Chunk Complexity Score, Source Language, Target Language.
    *   Model output: "Initial Translation Confidence Score" (0-100).  Higher = more confident in predicted translation quality.
*   **Output:** List of content chunks with Initial Translation Confidence Scores.

**3.  Dynamic Confidence Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:**  Translated content displayed to users, User Interaction Data (clicks, time spent on page, bounce rate, explicit feedback – thumbs up/down), Initial Translation Confidence Scores.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor user interaction with translated content.
    *   Apply weighted adjustments to Initial Translation Confidence Scores based on:
        *   **Dwell Time:** Longer dwell time = higher confidence.
        *   **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Higher CTR on associated links = higher confidence.
        *   **Bounce Rate:** Lower bounce rate = higher confidence.
        *   **Explicit Feedback:** Direct user ratings.
        *   **Chunk-Specific Adjustments:** Apply adjustments to individual content chunks, not just the entire translation.
*   **Output:**  "Dynamic Translation Confidence Score" for each content chunk.

**4. Proactive Re-Translation Trigger:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic Translation Confidence Scores, Configurable Thresholds.
*   **Process:**
    *   If a Dynamic Translation Confidence Score for a content chunk falls *below* a pre-defined threshold:
        *   Automatically trigger a request for a new translation of *that specific chunk*.
        *   Prioritize re-translation requests based on the severity of the confidence drop.
        *   Route re-translation requests to different translators to gather multiple perspectives.
*   **Output:** Re-translation requests.

**5.  Translator & Reviewer Feedback Loop Integration:**

*   Integrate re-translation requests into the existing translator/reviewer system.
*   Track which translators/reviewers consistently produce high-quality translations for specific types of content (based on Dynamic Translation Confidence Scores and user feedback).
*   Use this data to optimize translator/reviewer assignments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FOR EACH content_chunk IN raw_content:
    complexity_score = analyze_complexity(content_chunk)
    initial_confidence = predict_confidence(complexity_score, target_language)

    translated_chunk = translate(content_chunk)
    display(translated_chunk)

    user_interaction = monitor_user_interaction(translated_chunk)
    dynamic_confidence = adjust_confidence(initial_confidence, user_interaction)

    IF dynamic_confidence < threshold:
        request_retranslation(content_chunk)
```

This system moves beyond *evaluating* existing translations to *predicting* translation quality and proactively improving it in real-time. The granular chunk-level analysis allows for targeted re-translation, minimizing disruption and maximizing quality.
