## Dynamic Mood-Based Music Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the social media integration to include real-time emotional analysis of a user and dynamically alter the *sonic characteristics* of currently playing music to reflect or *counteract* their emotional state, then subtly share those alterations with linked users.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Input:**

*   **Source:** Integrate with device’s native emotion recognition API (facial expression, voice analysis).  Optionally, allow user to manually input mood.
*   **Analysis:** Map emotional data to a multi-dimensional “Mood Vector” (e.g., Valence: -1 to +1, Arousal: -1 to +1, Dominance: -1 to +1).
*   **Thresholds:** Define adjustable sensitivity levels for emotional triggers.

**2. Sonic Morphing Engine:**

*   **Parameter Mapping:** Establish a mapping between Mood Vector dimensions and audio effect parameters.  Examples:
    *   High Arousal -> Increased tempo, distortion, aggressive equalization.
    *   Low Valence -> Reverb, chorus, subtle detuning, “lo-fi” effects.
    *   Low Dominance ->  Dynamic range compression, automated panning.
*   **Effect Chain:** Design a flexible audio effect chain with multiple modules (EQ, Compressor, Reverb, Delay, Distortion, Chorus, Pitch Shifter).
*   **Smoothing:** Implement a smoothing algorithm (e.g., exponential moving average) to prevent abrupt sonic shifts.  Adjustable smoothing time.
*   **Presets:** Provide a library of pre-defined morphing profiles for different moods and genres.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define their own mappings and create custom morphing profiles.

**3. Social Sharing & “Vibe Echo”:**

*   **Subtle Sharing:** When a user’s music is morphed, transmit *only* the changes to audio parameters (delta values) to linked users’ media players.  Do *not* transmit the original track.
*   **“Vibe Echo” Mode:** Linked users experience a subtle “echo” of the morphing - their music is also slightly altered, mirroring the original user’s mood-driven changes.  This creates a sense of shared emotional space.  Adjustable echo strength.
*   **Privacy Control:**  Allow users to disable Vibe Echo sharing entirely or control which linked users receive the updates.
*   **Mood Visualization:** Display a visual representation of the shared mood (e.g., a color-changing aura) within the social network module.

**4. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Client Device (Media Player)

loop:
    emotionalData = getEmotionalData() // From device API
    moodVector = mapEmotionalDataToMoodVector(emotionalData)
    audioParameterDeltas = calculateAudioParameterDeltas(moodVector)
    applyAudioParameterDeltasToCurrentTrack(audioParameterDeltas)

    if (userHasVibeEchoEnabled()):
        transmitAudioParameterDeltasToLinkedUsers()

    receiveAudioParameterDeltasFromLinkedUsers()
    applyReceivedAudioParameterDeltasToCurrentTrack()
end loop
```

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Driven Morphing:** Use machine learning to personalize morphing profiles based on user listening history and emotional responses.
*   **Collaborative Playlists:** Create playlists where mood morphing is dynamically adjusted based on the collective emotional state of all linked users.
*   **“Empathy Mode”:** Allow users to consciously share their emotional state with linked users through exaggerated morphing effects.
*   **Cross-Platform Integration:** Extend the functionality to other media types (video, podcasts) and platforms (smart speakers, VR/AR).
