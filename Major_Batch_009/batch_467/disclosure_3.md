## Personalized Auction ‘Echo’ System

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of identifying users with similar bidding histories to *proactively* create “echo” auctions – dynamically generated auctions mirroring items already attracting bids from a user's ‘affinity group’.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `User Profile`: Contains bidding history (item IDs, winning/losing status, bid amounts), explicitly stated preferences (categories, brands), and implicitly derived preferences (inferred from browsing/search data).
*   `Affinity Group`: A dynamically generated group of users with statistically significant overlap in bidding history and/or preferences.  The system constantly recalculates affinity group membership.  Size is variable, capped at a maximum (e.g., 500 users) to maintain relevance.
*   `Echo Auction Template`: A pre-defined auction structure (duration, starting bid range, increment) linked to an item category.

**2. Process Flow:**

1.  **Trigger:**  User *U* places a bid on Auction *A*.
2.  **Affinity Group Identification:** Determine *U’s* affinity group (*AG*).
3.  **Item Category Extraction:** Identify the category of Auction *A* (e.g., "Vintage Watches").
4.  **Candidate Item Search:**  Search for items within the same category as *A* that *no one* in *AG* has currently bid on. Prioritize items with high average ratings/reviews or recent listings.
5.  **Echo Auction Creation:**
    *   Create a new auction (*B*) for a candidate item.
    *   Set the starting bid of *B* based on the average winning bid in recent auctions for similar items. (Avoid underpricing/overpricing.)
    *   Set the duration of *B* to be shorter than typical auctions (e.g., 24 hours) to create a sense of urgency.
6.  **Promotion to Affinity Group:**
    *   Present Auction *B* prominently to all members of *AG* who have not already bid on it.  Use personalized messaging: “Users like you are bidding on similar items.”
    *   For users with high engagement scores (frequent bidders, high purchase frequency), send push notifications or email alerts.
7.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Monitor the performance of Echo Auctions.
    *   If an Echo Auction receives bids, it signals a successful match.
    *   If an Echo Auction fails to attract bids, adjust the item selection criteria or the starting bid price.
8. **Algorithmic weighting:**
    * When forming an affinity group, the algorithm should weight recent bidding activity far more heavily than older data. A decay function should be used to reduce the influence of bids older than, say, 30 days.
    * Algorithmically determine an 'influence score' for each user within the group. Users who consistently bid on items that others in the group also bid on should have a higher score. This can be used to filter candidates in step 4.

**3.  System Components:**

*   **Bidding History Database:** Stores detailed bidding data for all users.
*   **Item Catalog:** Stores item information (category, description, images).
*   **Affinity Group Engine:**  Calculates and maintains affinity groups.
*   **Auction Creation Module:**  Dynamically creates auctions based on defined templates.
*   **Personalized Promotion Engine:**  Delivers targeted promotions to users.
*   **Monitoring & Reporting Module:** Tracks the performance of Echo Auctions and provides insights for optimization.

**Pseudocode (Affinity Group Engine):**

```
function calculateAffinityGroup(userID):
  userBiddingHistory = getBiddingHistory(userID)
  potentialAffinityMembers = []
  for otherUserID in allUsers:
    if otherUserID != userID:
      otherUserBiddingHistory = getBiddingHistory(otherUserID)
      similarityScore = calculateJaccardSimilarity(userBiddingHistory, otherUserBiddingHistory) //Or other similarity metric
      if similarityScore > threshold:
        potentialAffinityMembers.append(otherUserID)

  //Apply Influence Score weighting here.
  //Filter to top N most influential members
  return potentialAffinityMembers
```
