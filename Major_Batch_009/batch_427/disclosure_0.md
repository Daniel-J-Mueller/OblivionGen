## Dynamic Revision Contextualization – ‘Temporal Layers’

**Concept:** Extend the visual identifier system to represent document revisions not just as side-by-side comparisons, but as layered ‘temporal slices’ viewable within a unified document canvas.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Structure:** Implement a ‘Revision Graph’ where each node represents a document version, and edges denote relationships (e.g., ‘edited from’, ‘branched from’).  Each node stores full document content *and* a ‘delta’ representing changes from its parent node.

2.  **UI Component – ‘Temporal Canvas’:**  A core visual element.  Displays a unified document view.  Users can select multiple revisions (nodes from the Revision Graph) to be ‘active’ on the canvas.

3.  **Layering Mechanism:**
    *   The base layer is the oldest selected revision.
    *   Subsequent revisions are rendered *on top* of the base layer.
    *   Differences (deltas) are highlighted *directly within* the unified document content – color coding, opacity adjustments, etc.  Think of it like transparent overlays showing what changed.
    *   A ‘temporal slider’ controls the visibility of revisions – sliding it back displays earlier versions, forward shows later ones.  This isn’t just a ‘before/after’ – it’s a dynamic blending of revisions.

4.  **Interaction Model:**
    *   **Revision Selection:** Users can select revisions via a timeline or graph view.
    *   **‘Focus’ Mode:** Select a single revision to view it in full, independent of others.
    *   **Delta Inspection:** Hovering over a highlighted delta reveals details (author, timestamp, change type).
    *   **‘Ghosting’ Effect:**  Optional feature to show a ‘ghost’ of previous versions *behind* the current one, even if not actively selected – helps understand the evolution of content.

5.  **Pseudocode – Rendering:**

```
function renderTemporalCanvas(selectedRevisions) {
  baseRevision = selectedRevisions[0] // Oldest
  renderDocument(baseRevision.content)

  for (revision in selectedRevisions) {
    if (revision != 0) {
      delta = calculateDelta(baseRevision.content, revision.content)
      applyDeltaToCanvas(delta, revision.opacity) // Opacity controls visibility
    }
  }
}

function calculateDelta(baseContent, revisionContent) {
  // Algorithm to identify differences (character-level, block-level, etc.)
  // Returns a list of changes (additions, deletions, modifications)
}

function applyDeltaToCanvas(delta, opacity) {
  for (change in delta) {
    if (change.type == "add") {
      renderText(change.content, change.location, opacity)
    } else if (change.type == "delete") {
      // Visually remove text (e.g., strikethrough, background color)
    } else if (change.type == "modify") {
      // Replace text with updated content
    }
  }
}
```

6.  **Enhancements:**
    *   **Branch Visualization:** Display branches in the Revision Graph directly on the canvas – users can ‘jump’ between branches.
    *   **Collaboration Highlighting:**  Show changes made by different users in different colors.
    *   **‘What If’ Scenarios:** Allow users to experiment with changes without affecting the actual document – create temporary branches.
    *   **AI-Powered Delta Summarization:**  Use AI to summarize changes in plain language.

This goes beyond simple comparison. It creates a truly dynamic and contextualized view of document evolution, fostering deeper understanding and collaboration.
