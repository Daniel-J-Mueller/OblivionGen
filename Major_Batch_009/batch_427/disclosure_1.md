## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Personalized Echo Cancellation

**Concept:** Extend the base/handheld device differentiation to create dynamically adjustable acoustic zones within a space, coupled with personalized echo cancellation profiles. This moves beyond simply *recognizing* different audio sources to actively shaping the acoustic environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Array Microphone System (Base Device):**  A spatially distributed microphone array integrated into the base device. Minimum 8 microphones, optimized for beamforming and sound source localization.
*   **Directional Speaker Array (Base Device):** An array of small directional speakers integrated into the base device.  Capable of emitting focused sound beams.
*   **Handheld Device Microphone:** High-quality, directional microphone on the handheld device.
*   **Acoustic Mapping Sensor (Optional):**  A low-resolution depth sensor (e.g., time-of-flight) integrated into the base device to create a rudimentary acoustic map of the room. This isn’t for visual rendering, just basic object detection for reflection modeling.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP/FPGA within the base device for real-time audio processing.

**2. Software/Algorithm Components:**

*   **Acoustic Zone Definition:**  Users define virtual “zones” within the room via a UI (app/voice). These zones can be assigned to specific users or purposes (e.g., “Living Room,” “Home Office,” “Kitchen”).
*   **Sound Source Localization:**  Algorithm to identify and locate sound sources within the room using the microphone array. Uses beamforming and triangulation.
*   **Dynamic Beamforming:**  Algorithm to dynamically adjust the direction and focus of the microphone array to prioritize audio from the target zone/user.
*   **Adaptive Echo Cancellation:** Personalized echo cancellation profiles are created for each user, learned from their speech patterns and the acoustics of their typical location. This profile is applied *before* ASR.
*   **Focused Sound Emission:** The speaker array emits focused sound beams to either:
    *   **Mask Interference:** Emit noise/pink noise in a specific direction to mask interfering sounds.
    *   **Enhance Clarity:**  Emit subtle pre-emphasis frequencies targeted at the localized user to improve speech intelligibility.
*   **Zone Switching:** Automatic zone switching based on user location (determined via handheld device proximity, voice detection, or other sensors).
*   **AI-Driven Acoustic Modeling:**  A machine learning model that learns the acoustic characteristics of each zone and optimizes the beamforming, echo cancellation, and sound emission parameters.

**3. Pseudocode - Zone Switching & Beamforming:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Detect Active User/Device
  activeUser = DetectActiveUser(baseMicArray, handheldMic);

  // 2. Determine Current Zone
  currentZone = GetCurrentZone(activeUser.location);

  // 3. Load Zone Profile
  zoneProfile = LoadZoneProfile(currentZone);

  // 4. Beamforming Configuration
  ConfigureBeamforming(baseMicArray, zoneProfile.beamformingParams);

  // 5. Echo Cancellation Configuration
  ConfigureEchoCancellation(activeUser.echoCancellationProfile);

  // 6.  Process Audio
  audio = ProcessAudio(baseMicArray, handheldMic);

  // 7.  ASR/NLU/TTS (as per original patent)
}

// Function: DetectActiveUser
function DetectActiveUser(baseMicArray, handheldMic) {
    if (handheldMic.active) {
        return { location: handheldMic.location, echoCancellationProfile: handheldMic.userProfile };
    } else {
        //Use beamforming to find dominant voice source
        dominantSource = FindDominantSource(baseMicArray);
        return { location: dominantSource.location, echoCancellationProfile: GetUserProfile(dominantSource.user) };
    }
}
```

**4.  User Interface (Conceptual):**

*   A mobile app to define zones, assign users, and customize acoustic profiles.
*   Voice commands to switch zones ("Switch to Home Office zone").
*   Real-time visualization of sound source localization in the app.



This system moves beyond merely understanding *what* is said to actively *shaping the environment* in which speech occurs, creating personalized and optimized acoustic experiences. It’s an evolution of the ‘smart home’ concept, focused on tailoring the acoustics rather than just the volume.
