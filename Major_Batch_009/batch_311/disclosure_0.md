## Adaptive Messaging Priority & Dynamic Proxy Selection

**Concept:** Extend the proxying and analysis framework to not just *hide* senders, but dynamically adjust message priority *and* select proxies based on recipient responsiveness and message content. This goes beyond simply anonymizing; it actively optimizes message delivery and attempts to circumvent potential throttling or filtering.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Core:** Existing proxy infrastructure (as described in the provided patent).
*   **Responsiveness Monitor:** A module continuously tracking recipient response times to various message types (e.g., transactional, informational, urgent). This is per-recipient.  Data is stored as a sliding window average, weighted towards more recent interactions.
*   **Content Analyzer:** A natural language processing (NLP) module analyzing message content to categorize it (e.g., 'payment request', 'shipping update', 'support ticket', 'marketing'). This leverages a pre-trained model fine-tuned for relevant categories.
*   **Priority Engine:**  A rules-based system combining:
    *   Recipient Responsiveness (from Responsiveness Monitor).
    *   Message Category (from Content Analyzer).
    *   Pre-defined Priority Weights (configurable per message type).
*   **Dynamic Proxy Selector:**  A module that maintains a pool of proxies (IP addresses, VPN endpoints, etc.).  This selector chooses a proxy for each message *based on* the calculated priority and a ‘proxy health’ score (latency, uptime).  The health score is continually updated.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Data on message delivery success/failure (and latency) is fed back to the Responsiveness Monitor and Dynamic Proxy Selector to refine their algorithms.

**2. Data Structures:**

*   `RecipientProfile`:
    *   `recipientID`: (Unique identifier)
    *   `responsivenessScore`: (Float - 0.0 to 1.0, higher = more responsive)
    *   `lastInteractionTime`: (Timestamp)
    *   `messageTypePreferences`: (List of preferred message types, weighted)
*   `ProxyInfo`:
    *   `proxyID`: (Unique identifier)
    *   `IPAddress`: (String)
    *   `latency`: (Float - milliseconds)
    *   `uptime`: (Float - percentage)
    *   `reliabilityScore`: (Float - 0.0 to 1.0)
*   `MessageMetadata`:
    *   `messageID`: (Unique identifier)
    *   `senderID`: (Original sender)
    *   `recipientID`: (Intended recipient)
    *   `messageCategory`: (String – e.g., 'payment request')
    *   `priorityScore`: (Float - calculated by Priority Engine)
    *   `selectedProxyID`: (Proxy used for delivery)

**3. Pseudocode (Priority Engine):**

```
FUNCTION CalculatePriority(message, recipientProfile):
  category = AnalyzeMessageContent(message)
  responsiveness = recipientProfile.responsivenessScore

  //Define base priority weights (configurable)
  weight_urgent = 0.9
  weight_transactional = 0.7
  weight_informational = 0.3

  //Assign base priority based on category
  IF category == "urgent":
    basePriority = weight_urgent
  ELSE IF category == "transactional":
    basePriority = weight_transactional
  ELSE:
    basePriority = weight_informational

  //Adjust priority based on recipient responsiveness
  priority = basePriority * (1 + responsiveness) // Higher responsiveness = higher priority

  RETURN priority
```

**4. Pseudocode (Dynamic Proxy Selector):**

```
FUNCTION SelectProxy(message, priority):
  //Filter out unhealthy proxies
  healthyProxies = Filter(proxyPool, proxy.reliabilityScore > threshold)

  //Sort proxies based on latency and priority
  sortedProxies = Sort(healthyProxies, key=lambda proxy: (proxy.latency, -priority)) //Lower latency, higher priority

  //Select the best proxy
  selectedProxy = sortedProxies[0]

  RETURN selectedProxy
```

**5.  Extended Functionality:**

*   **Adaptive Throttling:** If a recipient consistently ignores messages, the system reduces the frequency of messages sent to that recipient.
*   **Proxy Rotation:** Regularly rotate proxies to avoid detection and maintain anonymity.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Flag unusual message patterns (e.g., sudden spikes in volume) that might indicate malicious activity.
