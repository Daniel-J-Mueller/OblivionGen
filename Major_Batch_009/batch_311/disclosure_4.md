## Dynamic Content ‘Weaving’ & Contextual Bookmarks

**Concept:** Extend the bookmark/overview concept beyond simple page adjacency. Allow users to dynamically ‘weave’ together sections of content – not just pages, but paragraphs, images, even timecodes within videos – creating personalized, non-linear reading/viewing experiences. Contextual bookmarks aren’t just markers, they’re anchor points in these woven narratives.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Segmentation:** System must support arbitrary content segmentation. Not limited to pages. Granularity down to paragraph level for text, frame/timecode level for video/audio, region selection for images/documents.
*   **Weaving Interface:**
    *   A visual ‘weave’ editor. User can select content segments and drag-and-drop them into a sequence.
    *   Connection points: Each segment has visually indicated connection points (e.g., small circles at edges) for linking to others.
    *   Dynamic Reordering: Segments can be reordered at any time, automatically updating the woven narrative.
    *   Zoom/Overview: Ability to zoom out to see the entire weave as a visual map.
*   **Contextual Bookmark Generation:**
    *   When a segment is added to the weave, a contextual bookmark is created automatically. This bookmark stores:
        *   Segment ID
        *   Position within the weave (sequence number)
        *   Contextual data – keywords, user notes, automatically extracted themes.
    *   Bookmarks are not tied to the original content location, but to their position within the weave.
*   **Navigation & Playback:**
    *   Weave playback mode: Content segments play in the defined sequence.
    *   Bookmark-based navigation: Clicking a bookmark jumps to the corresponding segment in the weave.
    *   'Source' Jump: Option to jump back to the original location of a segment within the original content.
*   **Sharing & Collaboration:**
    *   Weaves can be shared with other users.
    *   Collaborative editing: Multiple users can contribute to a weave simultaneously.
*   **AI-Assisted Weaving:** (Future Enhancement)
    *   AI can suggest potential connections between content segments based on semantic similarity.
    *   Automatic weave generation based on user-defined criteria (e.g., “Create a weave summarizing the key arguments in this document”).

**Pseudocode (Weave Creation/Playback):**

```
// Data Structures
Segment {
  ID: string;
  Content: string; // or reference to content data
  Keywords: list of strings;
}

Weave {
  Name: string;
  Segments: list of Segment IDs (ordered sequence);
  Creator: User ID;
}

// Function: CreateWeave(weaveName, userID)
// Returns: Weave object

// Function: AddSegmentToWeave(weaveID, segmentID)
// Adds segmentID to the ordered segment list of weaveID.

// Function: PlayWeave(weaveID)
// 1. Retrieve Weave object by weaveID
// 2. For each segmentID in weave.Segments:
//   a. Retrieve Segment object by segmentID.
//   b. Display/Play Segment.Content
// 3. End Playback
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond linear bookmarking to a system where users actively construct their own personalized narratives. The context-aware bookmarks are not simply pointers to locations, but integral parts of the woven experience. It supports a much more dynamic and engaging form of content interaction.
