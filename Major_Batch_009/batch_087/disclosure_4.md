## Dynamic Narrative Branching via Gaze-Contingent Editing

**Concept:** Expand the gaze-tracking data beyond advertisement placement to directly influence the unfolding narrative of the video itself. Instead of *just* moving ads, dynamically edit the video content based on where the user is (and isn't) looking.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Gaze Mapping Module:** Real-time gaze tracking with high-resolution data capture (frequency >60Hz, precision <1 degree). Gaze data must be mapped onto the video frame (X,Y coordinates) and timestamped.

2.  **Narrative Segmentation:** Video content is pre-segmented into distinct "narrative units" (NUs) - short clips representing discrete story beats or informational segments. Each NU is tagged with metadata:
    *   `Importance`: A numerical score indicating the NU’s relevance to the core narrative.
    *   `Complexity`: A measure of visual and auditory information density.
    *   `Emotional Valence`: Positive, negative, or neutral emotional tone.
    *   `Alternative NUs`: A list of alternative NUs that could replace this one without breaking narrative coherence.

3.  **Interest Thresholds:** Define thresholds for gaze duration and gaze frequency. These thresholds will categorize gaze behavior as “high interest,” “neutral,” or “low interest.”

4.  **Dynamic Editing Engine:** This module governs the real-time editing of the video stream. It receives gaze data and, based on pre-defined rules and the NU metadata, selects and stitches together NUs.

5.  **Rule Set:** A customizable set of rules governs the editing process. Examples:
    *   **High Interest, High Complexity NU:** Extend the duration of this NU, potentially adding supplementary information or visual details.
    *   **Low Interest, High Importance NU:** Replace with a simplified or visually engaging alternative NU.
    *   **Prolonged Gaze at Specific Object:** Trigger a close-up or informational overlay.
    *   **Rapid Eye Movements (Saccades):** Indicate disengagement. Introduce a faster-paced scene or change of perspective.

6.  **Rendering Pipeline:** A fast, efficient rendering pipeline to seamlessly stitch together NUs and deliver a smooth, uninterrupted viewing experience.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Load video content & segment into Narrative Units (NUs)
Load NU metadata (Importance, Complexity, Emotional Valence, Alternatives)
Define Interest Thresholds
Initialize Rendering Pipeline

// Real-time Loop
while (video is playing) {
    Get Gaze Data (X, Y, Timestamp)
    Calculate Gaze Duration & Frequency within current NU
    Determine Interest Level (High, Neutral, Low)

    if (Interest Level == Low) {
        Select Alternative NU (based on Importance & metadata)
    }

    if (Interest Level == High & NU.Complexity > threshold) {
        Extend NU duration & add supplemental content
    }

    Render current NU (or modified version)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Personalized Education:** Adapt learning materials to a student’s focus and comprehension.
*   **Immersive Storytelling:** Create dynamically evolving narratives tailored to individual viewers.
*   **Adaptive Marketing:** Deliver targeted content based on real-time engagement.
*   **Accessibility:** Simplify complex information for viewers with cognitive impairments.
