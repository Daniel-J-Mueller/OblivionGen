## Dynamic Function Composition via Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** A system for composing functions on-the-fly, leveraging predictive prefetching of function components and state, anticipating user request patterns at the edge.

**Core Concept:** Instead of delivering complete functions for execution, this system decomposes functions into granular “function components” – small, independent units of code and data. These components are cached at the edge, and a "composition engine" dynamically assembles them based on incoming requests. Predictive prefetching anticipates which components will be needed and prefetches them into a fast, in-memory cache.

**System Components:**

*   **Function Decomposition Service:**  Responsible for breaking down customer-specified functions into a graph of interconnected function components.  It analyzes the function's code and data dependencies to identify these components. Output: Graph representation of the function.
*   **Component Cache (Edge):** A distributed in-memory cache at each point of presence. Stores pre-fetched and frequently used function components. Uses an LRU eviction policy with "importance weighting" (see below).
*   **Prefetch Engine (Edge):**  Monitors incoming requests and utilizes a predictive model (e.g., Markov chains, recurrent neural networks) to anticipate future requests. Based on this prediction, it prefetches relevant function components into the Component Cache.
*   **Composition Engine (Proxy/Execution Unit):** Receives a request, determines the required function, and dynamically assembles the function from available components in the Component Cache. If a component is missing, it retrieves it from a central repository (or triggers a request to the Decomposition Service to create it).
*   **State Management System:** Maintains function state as independent "state fragments" associated with specific components.  These fragments are versioned and replicated across multiple cache servers for redundancy.

**Data Structures:**

*   **Function Component:**  A self-contained unit of code and metadata (e.g., input/output types, dependencies, version number).
*   **Dependency Graph:**  A directed graph representing the dependencies between function components.
*   **State Fragment:**  A portion of the function's state associated with a specific component.

**Pseudocode (Composition Engine):**

```
function compose_function(request, function_id):
  dependency_graph = get_dependency_graph(function_id)
  required_components = find_required_components(dependency_graph)
  
  cached_components = find_cached_components(required_components)
  missing_components = required_components - cached_components
  
  // Fetch missing components (from central repo or decomposition service)
  fetched_components = fetch_components(missing_components)
  
  // Load state fragments for components
  loaded_state = load_state_fragments(fetched_components)
  
  // Execute components in dependency order
  result = execute_components(fetched_components, loaded_state, request)
  
  return result
```

**Importance Weighting:** The Component Cache uses "importance weighting" to prioritize component caching.  Components are assigned weights based on factors like:

*   **Frequency of Use:** How often is the component requested?
*   **Dependency Depth:**  How many other components depend on this one? (Higher dependency = higher weight)
*   **Computational Cost:** How expensive is it to execute this component? (Higher cost = higher weight)

Components with higher weights are less likely to be evicted from the cache.

**State Replication and Consistency:**  State fragments are replicated across multiple cache servers to improve availability and fault tolerance.  A consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) is used to ensure state consistency.

**Novelty:**

This design differs from the original patent by moving away from full function deployment to a granular, component-based approach. By predicting which components will be needed, the system can proactively prefetch them into the cache, reducing latency and improving performance. This is especially advantageous for complex functions with numerous dependencies. The focus on granular state management and replication further enhances availability and scalability.  It pushes beyond simple caching, to a proactive, predictive, and highly available system for dynamic function composition.
