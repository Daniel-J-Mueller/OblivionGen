## Dynamic Micro-Fluidic Lens Array Fabrication

**Concept:** Leveraging the voltage-controlled material deposition described in the patent to create a dynamically adjustable micro-fluidic lens array. Instead of simply exposing areas of a support plate, precisely control deposition to *build* miniature lenses, then adjust their focal length via applied voltage.

**Specifications:**

*   **Base Layer:** Silicon substrate with pre-patterned micro-chambers (height ~10-50um). Chambers act as lens ‘wells’.
*   **First Material:** Hydrophilic coating (e.g., TiO2) on the silicon substrate *within* the micro-chambers. This enhances fluid wetting.
*   **Second Material:** Electrically conductive, clear micro-fluidic liquid (e.g., aqueous solution with dissolved conductive salts & appropriate viscosity). This forms the lens itself.
*   **Electrode Configuration:** An array of micro-electrodes *beneath* the silicon substrate, corresponding to each micro-chamber. Individual control of each electrode is critical.
*   **Deposition Process:**
    1.  Apply a voltage to individual electrodes. This attracts the conductive fluid from a dispenser nozzle positioned above the substrate.
    2.  Precisely control voltage and nozzle movement to deposit a hemispherical ‘blob’ of fluid into each micro-chamber. The chamber walls define the lens shape.
    3.  Fluid should fully fill the chamber.
*   **Dynamic Control:** 
    1.  Applying a varying voltage to *each* electrode changes the electrostatic forces acting on the fluid within its corresponding chamber.
    2.  This alters the curvature of the fluid surface, and therefore the focal length of the lens. Higher voltage = more pronounced curvature = shorter focal length.
*   **Sealing Layer:** A thin, transparent dielectric layer deposited *over* the entire array to seal the fluid, prevent evaporation, and provide electrical isolation.
*   **Array Density:** Target initial array density of 1000 lenses/mm².
*   **Control System:** Software to map voltage to focal length for each lens, allowing real-time image manipulation.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
define array_size = 1000x1000
define lens_array[array_size][array_size] //2D array representing lenses

//Calibration Routine
for each lens in lens_array:
    set voltage to 0
    measure focal length (f0)
    increment voltage by delta_v
    measure focal length (f1)
    calculate voltage-focal length relationship (slope, intercept)
    store relationship for lens

//Dynamic Adjustment Routine
for each lens:
    desired_focal_length = input()
    voltage = calculate_voltage(desired_focal_length, slope, intercept)
    apply voltage to electrode corresponding to lens
```

**Potential Applications:** Adaptive optics, miniature cameras with variable zoom, dynamic displays, beam steering.
