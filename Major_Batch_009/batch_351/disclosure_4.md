## Dynamic Stowage Zone Allocation & Robotic Swarm Integration

**Concept:** Augment the existing proximity-based guidance with a dynamic zone allocation system driven by real-time demand forecasting and fulfilled by a swarm of small, collaborative robots.

**Specs:**

*   **Demand Forecasting Module:** Integrate historical order data with real-time sales signals (e.g., website traffic, current promotions) to predict item demand at a granular level (SKU, location, time). This module outputs a "heat map" of anticipated stowage needs across the facility.
*   **Dynamic Zone Definition:** The facility is divided into virtual "zones" which are not fixed. Zone boundaries and priority shift based on the demand forecast. High-demand items are assigned to zones closest to outbound shipping, minimizing travel distance.
*   **Robotic Swarm:** Deploy a fleet of small, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) – "StowBots" – each capable of carrying a single item. These robots operate within the defined zones.
*   **StowBot Tasking:** When an item is scanned for stowage, the system calculates the optimal StowBot within the target zone and assigns the task.  The system uses the StowBot’s current battery level, proximity, and task queue to determine suitability.
*   **Guided Stowage:** The associate scans the item. The system illuminates bins *and* directs a nearby StowBot to the correct bin. The associate places the item onto the StowBot. The StowBot autonomously navigates to the assigned bin and deposits the item.
*   **Capacity Management & Swarm Distribution:**  StowBots continuously report bin capacity. When a bin nears capacity, the system dynamically reallocates StowBots to underutilized zones, preventing bottlenecks.
*   **Associate Role Shift:** Associates transition from *placing* items in bins to *loading* items onto StowBots. This optimizes ergonomics and throughput.
*   **Zone Reconfiguration Protocol:** Automated protocol to physically reconfigure the facility layout (e.g., adjustable shelving, movable partitions) based on long-term demand trends. Controlled by the central system.

**Pseudocode (StowBot Task Assignment):**

```
FUNCTION AssignStowBot(item_id, target_bin_id)
  // 1. Find all active StowBots within the target zone
  stowbots = GetActiveStowBots(GetZoneFromBin(target_bin_id))

  // 2. Filter StowBots based on suitability criteria
  suitable_stowbots = FilterStowBots(stowbots,
    battery_level > 20%,
    not currently_carrying_item,
    distance_to(target_bin_id) < 5 meters)

  // 3. If no suitable StowBots are found, signal for reinforcement
  IF LENGTH(suitable_stowbots) == 0 THEN
    RequestReinforcement(target_zone_id)
    RETURN Error: "No available StowBots"
  ENDIF

  // 4. Calculate a score for each StowBot based on:
  //    - Distance to target bin
  //    - Current task queue length
  //    - Battery level
  FOR each stowbot IN suitable_stowbots DO
    score = (1 / distance_to(target_bin_id)) + (1 / task_queue_length) + battery_level
    stowbot.score = score
  ENDFOR

  // 5. Select the StowBot with the highest score
  best_stowbot = MAX(suitable_stowbots, key=score)

  // 6. Assign the task to the best StowBot
  best_stowbot.assign_task(item_id, target_bin_id)

  RETURN best_stowbot
