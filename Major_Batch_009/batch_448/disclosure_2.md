*   **Power:** PoE+ or dedicated power supply.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond reactive sensor failure mitigation (like the source patent) and implements *predictive* occlusion management coupled with dynamic sensor fusion.  The core idea is to model the facility environment and anticipate potential sensor obstructions *before* they occur, preemptively adjusting sensor reliance and fusion weights.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Environmental Modeling:**  The system builds a persistent 3D map of the facility using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques. This map is not static. It incorporates object detection (from RGB cameras) and dynamic object tracking. Crucially, it models *potential* occlusions. For example, knowing a forklift routinely traverses a specific path allows the system to predict times when a depth sensor's view of that area will be blocked.

2.  **Occlusion Prediction:**  The system employs a short-term prediction engine. This engine uses historical data (object trajectories, time of day, known schedules) and real-time sensor feeds to forecast future occlusions. Prediction confidence levels are assigned.

3.  **Dynamic Sensor Fusion Weights:**  Based on occlusion predictions and sensor confidence levels (derived from data quality metrics – noise, frame rate, consistency), the system dynamically adjusts weights applied to each sensor's data during object localization.

    *   If a sensor is predicted to be occluded, its weight is reduced.
    *   If a sensor reports low confidence data, its weight is reduced.
    *   Weights are normalized to ensure a stable output.

4.  **Sensor Redundancy Allocation:** The system identifies redundant sensor coverage areas. If a sensor is flagged for potential failure or occlusion, the system proactively allocates reliance on neighboring sensors providing overlapping coverage.

5.  **Adaptive Algorithm Selection:** The system incorporates multiple object localization algorithms (e.g., point cloud registration, feature matching, deep learning-based object detection). Based on the predicted occlusion, sensor confidence, and the observed scene characteristics, it selects the algorithm best suited to provide accurate results.

**Pseudocode (Core Fusion Logic):**

```
function fuse_sensor_data(depth_data, rgb_data, ultrasonic_data):
  // 1. Get Occlusion Predictions
  occlusion_map = get_occlusion_predictions()

  // 2. Get Sensor Confidence Levels
  depth_confidence = assess_depth_data_quality(depth_data)
  rgb_confidence = assess_rgb_data_quality(rgb_data)
  ultrasonic_confidence = assess_ultrasonic_data_quality(ultrasonic_data)

  // 3. Calculate Fusion Weights
  depth_weight = calculate_weight(depth_confidence, occlusion_map["depth_sensor"])
  rgb_weight = calculate_weight(rgb_confidence, occlusion_map["rgb_sensor"])
  ultrasonic_weight = calculate_weight(ultrasonic_confidence, occlusion_map["ultrasonic_sensor"])

  // Normalize weights to sum to 1
  total_weight = depth_weight + rgb_weight + ultrasonic_weight
  depth_weight /= total_weight
  rgb_weight /= total_weight
  ultrasonic_weight /= total_weight

  // 4. Fuse Data
  fused_data = (depth_data * depth_weight) + (rgb_data * rgb_weight) + (ultrasonic_data * ultrasonic_weight)

  return fused_data

function calculate_weight(confidence, occlusion_risk):
    base_weight = confidence * 0.8
    occlusion_penalty = occlusion_risk * 0.2
    return max(0.0, base_weight - occlusion_penalty)
```

**Expansion potential:**

*   Integration with facility management systems to access schedules and predict object movements.
*   Use of reinforcement learning to optimize fusion weights based on real-world performance.
*   Distributed processing architecture for large-scale deployments.
*   The system could also implement a 'virtual sensor' – a predicted sensor reading based on surrounding sensor data and environmental models, used when a physical sensor fails or is occluded.
