## Adaptive Credential Inheritance & Dynamic Access Profiles

**Concept:** Expand the universal access control system to not only relay a single credential but to dynamically assemble and inherit access profiles based on contextual data and pre-defined rules. This moves beyond simple access/no-access to nuanced permissions based on *who* the user is, *why* they need access, *when* they’re accessing, and *what* they’re accessing.

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A 'Policy Engine' integrated into the universal access control device. This engine stores and executes access control policies.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   **User Device:** Transmits not just the access token, but also contextual data: location (geofencing), role/group affiliation, task/project ID, device type, time of day.
    *   **Access Control System:** Reports granular access events (doors opened, resources accessed) to refine policy effectiveness.
    *   **External Data Sources:** (Optional) Integration with HR databases, project management systems, or other APIs to obtain more user/contextual data.
*   **Policy Structure:**  Policies are defined as a series of 'If-Then-Grant' rules.  Example: "IF User Role = 'Maintenance' AND Time = 'Night' AND Location = 'Data Center' THEN Grant Access to 'Server Room A'".
*   **Credential Assembly:** Upon receiving a valid access token, the Policy Engine evaluates all applicable policies. It assembles a dynamic credential set - a list of permissions based on the user’s context. This is *not* a single credential, but a package of permissions.
*   **Credential Inheritance:**  Access rights can be inherited from groups, roles, or even temporary assignments. This simplifies policy management.  Example: A user assigned to a "Project X" team automatically inherits all necessary access rights for that project.
*   **Temporary Access:**  The system supports time-limited or event-triggered access.  Example:  A contractor receives access to a specific area for the duration of a scheduled maintenance task.
*   **Auditing & Logging:**  All access events and policy evaluations are logged for auditing and security purposes.



**Pseudocode (Policy Evaluation):**

```
FUNCTION EvaluatePolicy(userContext, accessRequest):
    policyList = GetApplicablePolicies(userContext)
    dynamicCredentialSet = []

    FOR EACH policy IN policyList:
        IF policy.Condition(userContext, accessRequest) == TRUE:
            dynamicCredentialSet.Append(policy.Permission)

    RETURN dynamicCredentialSet
```

**Hardware Integration:**

*   Existing wireless receiver and processor remain.
*   Add a secure element (e.g., Trusted Platform Module) to store sensitive policy data.
*   Increased memory capacity to accommodate policy storage and dynamic credential sets.
*   Potential need for a more powerful processor to handle complex policy evaluations.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Policy data must be securely stored and protected from unauthorized access.
*   Communication between the universal access control device and external data sources must be encrypted.
*   Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments are essential.
