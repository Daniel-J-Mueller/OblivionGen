# 11474868

**Adaptive Shard Prioritization via Predictive Load Balancing**

**Concept:** The existing patent describes a sharded polling system focused on fairness. This adaptation shifts the focus towards *efficiency* by introducing a predictive load balancing system that dynamically prioritizes shards based on anticipated data volume and processing demands. This isnâ€™t simply about faster processing, it's about *anticipating* bottlenecks before they occur and shifting resources proactively.

**Specs:**

*   **Component: Predictive Load Balancer (PLB)**: A separate module operating alongside the existing sharded polling system. The PLB does *not* directly manage data flow; it influences shard prioritization.
*   **Data Inputs to PLB:**
    *   **Historical Data Volume per Shard:** Tracks data received from each shard over configurable time windows.
    *   **Data Complexity Metrics:** For each shard, track metrics like average message size, processing time estimations (based on message type), and resource consumption estimates.
    *   **External Event Feeds:** Integrate with external event streams (e.g., API call rates, user activity, sensor data) that *predict* future load on specific shards. (e.g., a marketing campaign launch predicts increased load on user profile shards)
    *   **Real-Time System Metrics:** Monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and network bandwidth of each polling thread.
*   **PLB Algorithm:**
    *   **Weighted Prediction Score:** Calculate a prediction score for each shard based on historical data, event feeds, and real-time metrics. Weights are configurable. (e.g., 60% historical, 20% event feed, 20% real-time)
    *   **Dynamic Priority Assignment:** Assign a priority level to each shard based on its prediction score. Higher scores = higher priority.
    *   **Priority Influence on Polling:** Modify the existing fairness algorithm (e.g., round robin) to *favor* higher-priority shards. This can be implemented using a weighted round robin or a priority queue.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Configuration:**  A configuration file defines weights, time windows, and priority thresholds.
    *   **Data Storage:** Use a time-series database to store historical data and system metrics.
    *   **API:** Provide an API to monitor the PLB and adjust configuration parameters dynamically.

**Pseudocode (PLB - Simplified):**

```
// Configuration Parameters
weight_historical = 0.6
weight_event = 0.2
weight_realtime = 0.2
priority_threshold = 0.75

// Data Structures
shard_data[shard_id] = {
    historical_load: float,
    event_load: float,
    realtime_load: float,
    priority: float
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    for each shard_id in shards {
        // Get Data
        shard_data[shard_id].historical_load = get_historical_load(shard_id)
        shard_data[shard_id].event_load = get_event_load(shard_id)
        shard_data[shard_id].realtime_load = get_realtime_load(shard_id)

        // Calculate Priority
        shard_data[shard_id].priority = (weight_historical * shard_data[shard_id].historical_load) + \
                                        (weight_event * shard_data[shard_id].event_load) + \
                                        (weight_realtime * shard_data[shard_id].realtime_load)

        // Adjust Polling Algorithm (Example: Weighted Round Robin)
        if (shard_data[shard_id].priority > priority_threshold) {
            increase_polling_weight(shard_id) // Give this shard more polling cycles
        } else {
            decrease_polling_weight(shard_id) // Give this shard fewer polling cycles
        }
    }

    sleep(configurable_interval) // Update interval
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing sharded polling systems prioritize fairness. This adaptation focuses on *anticipatory* resource allocation based on predictive load balancing. This allows the system to proactively optimize performance and minimize latency, particularly in dynamic environments. This isn't just about faster processing; it's about preventing bottlenecks before they happen. The predictive element distinguishes it from simple load balancing or reactive scaling.
