## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Wake Word Adaptation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple wake word detection to create a dynamic acoustic scene reconstruction and personalized wake word adaptation system. The core idea is to not just *detect* a wake word, but to understand the *acoustic context* surrounding it and adapt the wake word detection model *in real-time* based on that context *and* the user’s individual acoustic profile.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Microphone Array:**  Existing patent utilizes two or more. Increase to a minimum of *eight* spatially distributed microphones. Placement optimized for 3D sound source localization.  Include microphones facing downwards to capture tabletop reflections.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance processor with dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of running complex acoustic models and real-time signal processing.
*   **Non-Volatile Memory:**  Sufficient storage for storing acoustic profiles, learned models, and acoustic scene data. Minimum 64GB.
*   **Speaker Array:** Expand existing speaker(s) to a phased array with beamforming capabilities for localized audio playback and acoustic environment manipulation.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Raw audio stream from microphone array.
    *   Process:
        *   **Sound Event Detection (SED):** Identify and classify common sound events (e.g., speech, music, TV, doorbell, keyboard typing, running water).
        *   **Direction of Arrival (DOA) Estimation:** Determine the spatial location of each sound source.
        *   **Reverberation Time (RT) Estimation:** Calculate the RT to understand the acoustic characteristics of the environment.
        *   **Acoustic Material Classification:** Attempt to identify dominant surface materials (wood, carpet, glass) based on reflections.
    *   Output:  A dynamic “acoustic scene map” representing the spatial distribution of sound sources and acoustic characteristics.

*   **User Acoustic Profiler:**
    *   Input: Audio samples of the user's voice collected over time, along with contextual data (e.g., location, time of day, activity).
    *   Process:
        *   **Voiceprint Extraction:**  Create a unique voiceprint for each user.
        *   **Acoustic Adaptation:**  Fine-tune the wake word detection model based on the user's voiceprint and acoustic environment. (This isn’t just matching the voice, but adapting the *detection parameters*).
        *   **Environmental Noise Profiling:** Identify common background noise sources in the user’s typical environment.
    *   Output: A personalized acoustic model for each user.

*   **Adaptive Wake Word Engine:**
    *   Input: Audio stream, acoustic scene map, personalized acoustic model.
    *   Process:
        *   **Contextual Feature Extraction:** Extract features from the audio stream that are relevant to the current acoustic scene (e.g., noise levels, reverberation).
        *   **Dynamic Model Weighting:** Adjust the weights of different components of the wake word detection model based on the contextual features and the user’s acoustic profile. (More emphasis on voiceprint matching in quiet environments, more emphasis on acoustic feature robustness in noisy environments.)
        *   **Wake Word Detection:** Perform wake word detection using the dynamically weighted model.
    *   Output:  Wake word detection confidence score.

*   **Acoustic Manipulation Module (Optional):**
    *   Process: Utilizing the phased array speakers, the system can generate targeted sounds to *improve* wake word detection.  For example:
        *   Noise Cancellation: Generate anti-noise to reduce background noise interference.
        *   Acoustic Beamforming: Focus sound towards the user to improve signal quality.
        *   Echo Suppression: Generate localized sound to cancel out reflections.

**3. Pseudocode (Adaptive Wake Word Engine):**

```
function detectWakeWord(audioStream, acousticSceneMap, userProfile)
  // Extract features from audio
  audioFeatures = extractFeatures(audioStream)

  // Get environmental context from scene map
  noiseLevel = acousticSceneMap.noiseLevel
  reverberation = acousticSceneMap.reverberation

  // Load user profile
  voiceprint = userProfile.voiceprint

  // Dynamic model weighting
  weight_voiceprint = 1.0 - noiseLevel * 0.2
  weight_acoustic = 0.5 + reverberation * 0.1

  // Combine features and weights
  combinedFeatures = (weight_voiceprint * voiceprint) + (weight_acoustic * audioFeatures)

  // Run wake word detection model
  confidence = wakeWordModel.predict(combinedFeatures)

  return confidence
```

**4. Learning & Adaptation:**

*   **Continuous Learning:** The system should continuously learn and adapt to the user’s acoustic environment and voice.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to optimize the dynamic model weighting parameters based on user feedback and detection accuracy.
*   **Federated Learning (Optional):**  Enable federated learning to share acoustic models and learning insights across multiple devices while preserving user privacy.
