## Dynamic Fleet State Prediction & Pre-Provisioning

**Concept:** Extend the existing fleet management system to *predict* required fleet states based on anticipated user activity or external events, and proactively provision resources *before* demand arises. This moves beyond reactive configuration to a predictive, self-optimizing infrastructure.

**Specs:**

1.  **Event & Activity Monitoring Module:**
    *   Inputs: Real-time data streams from website analytics (user sessions, page views, transaction volume), external event feeds (marketing campaigns, news events, scheduled maintenance), and historical fleet performance data.
    *   Processing: Uses time series analysis and machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to forecast future resource needs.  Models are dynamically updated based on actual performance.
    *   Outputs: Predicted fleet state requirements (CPU, memory, bandwidth, storage) for various time horizons (short-term, medium-term, long-term). Predicted fleet state data is represented as a structured JSON object.

2.  **Fleet State Projection Engine:**
    *   Inputs:  Predicted fleet state requirements (from Event & Activity Monitoring Module), current fleet configuration (as defined by existing fleet state documents), defined service level agreements (SLAs).
    *   Processing: Calculates the *delta* between the predicted required state and the current state.  Prioritizes required changes based on SLA importance.  Generates a "provisional fleet state document" outlining the required modifications.  Considers cost optimization when making provisioning decisions (e.g., utilizing spot instances).
    *   Outputs: Provisional Fleet State Document (JSON format) containing the anticipated changes.

3.  **Pre-Provisioning Workflow:**
    *   Inputs: Provisional Fleet State Document, available cloud resources (from cloud provider APIs).
    *   Processing:
        *   `IF` (estimated cost of pre-provisioning < threshold) `THEN`
            *   Initiate resource provisioning requests to the cloud provider via API calls.
            *   Configure provisioned resources according to the Provisional Fleet State Document.
            *   Update the current fleet state document to reflect the pre-provisioned resources.
        *   `ELSE`
            *   Log a warning indicating that the cost exceeds the threshold.
            *   Generate a recommendation for alternative optimization strategies (e.g., scaling down less critical services).
    *   Outputs: Confirmation of resource provisioning, or a warning message with optimization recommendations.

4.  **Feedback Loop & Model Retraining:**
    *   Continuous monitoring of actual resource utilization compared to predicted values.
    *   Automatic retraining of the machine learning models using the historical data, improving prediction accuracy over time.
    *   Ability to manually override predictions and trigger provisioning based on expert judgment.

**Data Structures:**

*   **Predicted Fleet State (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-10-27T10:00:00Z",
      "resource_requirements": [
        {
          "resource_type": "CPU",
          "quantity": 100,
          "units": "cores"
        },
        {
          "resource_type": "Memory",
          "quantity": 200,
          "units": "GB"
        },
        {
          "resource_type": "Bandwidth",
          "quantity": 10,
          "units": "Gbps"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

*   **Provisional Fleet State Document (JSON):**  Extends the existing fleet state document format to include a “provisional_changes” section outlining the anticipated modifications.



This system aims to move beyond simply *reacting* to changes in demand, and instead *anticipate* those changes, resulting in a more efficient, resilient, and cost-effective infrastructure.
