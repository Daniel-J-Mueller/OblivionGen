## Dynamic Locker Reconfiguration via Robotic Internal Transport

**System Overview:**

The core concept is to move beyond static locker configurations and implement a dynamically reconfigurable internal transport system *within* a delivery locker array. This allows for optimizing space based on real-time delivery profiles – shifting from fixed-size slots to fluid, adaptable compartments.

**Hardware Components:**

1.  **Modular Locker Bays:** Each locker isn’t a single unit, but a series of smaller, internally mobile ‘cells’ approximately 6”x6”x6”.  These cells are constructed from lightweight, durable plastic or composite material.
2.  **Internal Robotic System:** A network of small, autonomous robots (similar in scale to robotic vacuum cleaners) operates *within* the locker array. These robots have the following capabilities:
    *   Vertical & Horizontal Movement: Navigating a 3D grid within the locker array.
    *   Cell Manipulation: Picking up, moving, and stacking the modular locker cells.
    *   Obstacle Avoidance: Utilizing sensors to avoid collisions with other robots, cells, and the locker structure itself.
    *   Wireless Communication: Communicating with a central control system to receive instructions and report status.
3.  **Central Control System:** A computer system running software to manage the robotic fleet and locker configuration. This system receives delivery requests, predicts locker demand (leveraging the existing ML models in the referenced patent), and issues instructions to the robots.
4.  **Entry/Exit Ports:** Standard entry/exit ports for package delivery and retrieval, adaptable to different package sizes via automated flaps/doors.

**Software & Logic:**

1.  **Demand Prediction Integration:** The system utilizes the existing machine learning models (from the referenced patent) to predict demand for different package sizes and delivery speeds. This is the primary input for locker reconfiguration.
2.  **Dynamic Slot Allocation:** Based on demand prediction, the central control system dynamically allocates ‘virtual slots’ of varying sizes.
3.  **Robotic Task Assignment:** The system generates a series of tasks for the robotic fleet – moving, stacking, and arranging the modular locker cells to create the required virtual slots.
4.  **Real-time Adjustment:**  The system continuously monitors locker occupancy and adjusts the configuration in real-time to optimize space utilization.
5.  **Priority Handling:**  Packages requiring faster delivery speeds (e.g., same-day) are assigned higher priority and are placed in easily accessible locations.
6.  **User Interface Integration:** A user interface allows customers to select preferred locker configurations (e.g., largest available slot) or to specify package delivery preferences.

**Pseudocode (Robotic Task Assignment):**

```
FUNCTION AssignTasks(DemandPrediction, CurrentConfiguration):
  // DemandPrediction: Estimated package sizes and quantities for the next period
  // CurrentConfiguration: Current arrangement of modular cells

  // Calculate Required Configuration:
  RequiredConfiguration = GenerateOptimalConfiguration(DemandPrediction)

  // Calculate Task List:
  TaskList = []
  FOR EACH Cell IN RequiredConfiguration:
    IF Cell.Location != CurrentConfiguration.CellAtLocation(Cell.Location):
      TaskList.Append(MoveCell(Cell, Cell.Location)) //Move cell to required location
  
  // Prioritize Tasks:
  PrioritizedTaskList = SortTaskList(TaskList, DemandPrediction) //Sort to prioritize high-demand packages

  // Assign Tasks to Robots:
  FOR EACH Robot IN RobotFleet:
    IF PrioritizedTaskList Not Empty:
      Robot.AssignTask(PrioritizedTaskList.First())
      PrioritizedTaskList.RemoveFirst()

  // Return Updated Configuration:
  Return PrioritizedTaskList
```

**Novelty & Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Capacity Utilization:** Dynamic reconfiguration allows for significantly higher capacity utilization compared to static locker systems.
*   **Adaptability:** The system can adapt to changing delivery patterns and seasonal demand fluctuations.
*   **Reduced Footprint:**  Optimized space utilization can reduce the overall footprint of the locker array.
*   **Improved Customer Experience:** Faster delivery times and more flexible delivery options.
*   **Scalability:** The modular design allows for easy expansion and customization.
