## Dynamic Resource Stitching for Augmented Reality Overlays

**Concept:** Extend the network resource access paradigm to seamlessly integrate and dynamically stitch together AR content fragments sourced from various network resources, creating rich, context-aware AR experiences.

**Specifications:**

**1. AR Resource Descriptor (ARD) Standard:**

*   **Format:** JSON-based schema.
*   **Fields:**
    *   `resource_id`: Unique identifier for the AR fragment.
    *   `resource_type`:  (e.g., `3d_model`, `texture`, `animation`, `soundscape`, `behavior_script`).
    *   `content_url`: URL pointing to the AR fragmentâ€™s content (e.g., `.glb`, `.jpg`, `.mp3`).
    *   `bounding_box`:  Defines the spatial extent of the AR fragment in meters (x, y, z, width, height, depth).
    *   `anchor_type`: Specifies how the AR fragment is anchored to the real world:
        *   `geo_location`: Anchored to GPS coordinates.
        *   `image_tracking`: Anchored to a specific image.
        *   `plane_tracking`: Anchored to a detected plane (horizontal/vertical).
        *   `object_tracking`: Anchored to a detected 3D object.
    *   `dependencies`:  List of `resource_id` values for other AR fragments required for rendering/functionality.
    *   `priority`: Integer value representing the importance of the resource (used for loading/caching optimization).
    *   `metadata`:  Key-value pairs for additional information (e.g., author, creation date, licensing information).

**2.  Native Shell AR Engine Integration:**

*   The native shell will incorporate an AR Engine capable of:
    *   Parsing ARD files.
    *   Downloading and caching AR fragments.
    *   Managing dependencies between AR fragments.
    *   Rendering AR fragments in the appropriate context.
    *   Handling user interactions with AR fragments.
*   The AR Engine will expose an API for mobile applications to:
    *   Request AR fragments based on location, image, plane, or object tracking.
    *   Register callbacks for AR fragment loading and rendering events.
    *   Inject custom behavior scripts into AR fragments.

**3. Dynamic Stitching Algorithm:**

*   **Trigger:**  User enters a defined geofence, detects an image/plane/object, or explicitly requests content.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Native shell queries a "Stitching Service" (cloud-based) with the current context (location, detected objects, user preferences).
    2.  Stitching Service returns a list of `resource_id` values, sorted by priority, representing AR fragments relevant to the current context.
    3.  Native shell AR Engine downloads and caches AR fragments, resolving dependencies recursively.
    4.  AR Engine dynamically stitches together the downloaded fragments, creating a cohesive AR experience.
    5.  The stitching process involves:
        *   Spatial alignment of fragments based on their bounding boxes and anchor types.
        *   Execution of behavior scripts to create interactive elements.
        *   Automatic adjustment of fragment scale and orientation to match the real-world environment.

**4.  Stitching Service API:**

*   **Endpoints:**
    *   `/stitch`: Accepts context information (location, detected objects, user preferences) and returns a list of `resource_id` values.
    *   `/resource/{resource_id}`: Returns the ARD file for a specific resource.
*   **Authentication:**  API key-based authentication.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  To prevent abuse.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Mobile App
location = getCurrentLocation()
detectedObject = detectObject()

// Native Shell
resourceList = NativeShell.requestResources(location, detectedObject)

// Native Shell (AR Engine)
for resourceId in resourceList:
    ard = downloadARD(resourceId)
    if ard:
        dependencies = ard.dependencies
        resolveDependencies(dependencies) //recursive function
        renderARFragment(ard)
```

This system allows developers to create location-aware and context-aware AR experiences without needing to embed all the AR content directly into their applications.  The Stitching Service acts as a central repository for AR fragments, enabling dynamic content delivery and personalized AR experiences.  The recursive dependency resolution ensures that all required assets are loaded and rendered correctly.
