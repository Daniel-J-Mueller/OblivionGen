**Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Predictive Beamforming**

**Concept:** Extend the multi-device audio capture concept to create dynamically adjustable "acoustic zones" within a vehicle. Instead of simply switching between microphones, predict occupant speech direction and focus beamforming based on historical data and real-time contextual awareness.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Vehicle must contain a microphone array (minimum 8 microphones distributed throughout cabin: sun visors, headliner, seatbacks, dashboard).
    *   Dedicated edge processing unit with a neural processing unit (NPU) for low-latency audio processing and model inference.
    *   Speaker array (integrated with existing vehicle audio system) for localized audio feedback and noise cancellation.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Occupant Localization Module:**
        *   Utilizes camera data (driver/passenger facing cameras) and potentially seat occupancy sensors to estimate occupant positions in 3D space.
        *   Output: X,Y,Z coordinates of each occupant's head/mouth region.
    *   **Speech Direction Estimation Module:**
        *   Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical speech data (voice prints, common phrases).
        *   Input: Microphone array input, occupant localization data.
        *   Output: Probability distribution of speech source direction (azimuth, elevation).
    *   **Dynamic Beamforming Module:**
        *   Implements adaptive beamforming algorithms (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response) optimized for vehicle cabin acoustics.
        *   Input: Speech direction estimation output, microphone array input.
        *   Output: Enhanced audio signal representing targeted speech.
    *   **Acoustic Zone Management Module:**
        *   Divides the vehicle cabin into virtual acoustic zones centered on each occupant.
        *   Dynamically adjusts beamforming parameters and noise cancellation profiles for each zone.
        *   Prioritizes speech from the zone containing the active driver or the occupant issuing a voice command.
*   **Pseudocode (Acoustic Zone Management):**

```
FUNCTION UpdateAcousticZones()
    FOREACH occupant IN OccupantList
        zone_center = GetOccupantPosition(occupant)
        zone_radius = DefineZoneRadius(occupant) //Based on seat size/position
        
        IF IsDriver(occupant) OR IsIssuingCommand(occupant)
            priority = HIGH
        ELSE
            priority = LOW
        
        SetBeamformingParameters(zone_center, zone_radius, priority)
        ApplyNoiseCancellation(zone_center, zone_radius, priority)
    END FOREACH
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION SetBeamformingParameters(center, radius, priority)
    //Adjust beamforming weights based on center, radius, and priority
    //Higher priority = tighter beam, more focused capture
    //Radius defines the zone of interest
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ApplyNoiseCancellation(center, radius, priority)
    //Apply targeted noise cancellation based on center, radius, and priority
    //Reduce noise outside the zone of interest
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Data Requirements:**
    *   Large dataset of vehicle cabin audio recordings with labeled speech sources.
    *   Occupant pose data (from cameras or other sensors).
    *   Vehicle acoustic characteristics (impulse response measurements).
*   **Potential Benefits:**
    *   Improved voice command accuracy in noisy vehicle environments.
    *   Enhanced audio quality for hands-free calling and entertainment.
    *   Personalized audio experiences for each occupant.
    *   Seamless integration with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
