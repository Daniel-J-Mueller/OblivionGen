## Adaptive Acoustic Zones

**Concept:** A system creating dynamically adjustable acoustic zones within a space, leveraging the core principles of the provided patent (always-on listening with tiered power consumption) but extending it towards spatial audio manipulation and targeted sound delivery/suppression.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8, optimally 16+), distributed throughout the target space (room, vehicle cabin, office cubicle, etc.). Each microphone connects to a localized low-power pre-processing node.
    *   Localized Edge Nodes: Each microphone feeds into an edge node (Raspberry Pi class device). Nodes perform:
        *   Analog-to-Digital Conversion.
        *   Voice Activity Detection (VAD) - refined to distinguish between speech and other sounds (music, environmental noise).
        *   Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation.
        *   Initial noise reduction.
        *   Data compression/transmission to central processing unit.
    *   Central Processing Unit (CPU): A dedicated processor (or cloud-based server) responsible for:
        *   Spatial mapping of sound sources.
        *   Zone definition (user-defined or automatically generated).
        *   Advanced beamforming and noise cancellation.
        *   Audio routing and mixing.
        *   Control of acoustic actuators (speakers, noise-canceling elements).
    *   Acoustic Actuators: Array of small, directional speakers and/or active noise-cancellation elements strategically placed within the space. These don’t necessarily need to be *visible* speakers – piezoelectric elements embedded in surfaces are an option.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Adaptive Zoning Algorithm:**
        1.  *Real-time Sound Source Localization:* Using the microphone array and DOA estimation, the system identifies all active sound sources within the space.
        2.  *Zone Creation/Adjustment:* The algorithm dynamically creates/adjusts zones based on:
            *   Sound Source Proximity: Zones are centered around identified sound sources.
            *   User Preferences: Users can manually define zones and set desired audio characteristics.
            *   Environmental Factors: Algorithm considers room acoustics (reverberation, reflections) to optimize zone boundaries.
        3.  *Audio Manipulation:*
            *   Beamforming: Focusing audio towards specific zones.
            *   Noise Cancellation: Suppressing sound in specific zones.
            *   Spatial Audio Rendering: Creating immersive soundscapes within zones.
    *   **Tiered Power Management:**  Utilizing the two-phase approach of the patent.
        *   Edge Nodes: Always-on, low-power operation for VAD and initial processing.
        *   CPU: Activated only when speech is detected, or specific zones require audio manipulation.
    *   **Machine Learning Integration:**
        *   Sound Event Classification: Identifying different types of sounds (e.g., music, speech, alarms) to optimize zoning and audio manipulation.
        *   User Behavior Prediction: Learning user preferences over time to proactively adjust zones and audio settings.

*   **Pseudocode (Zone Creation/Adjustment):**

```
function create_zones(sound_sources, user_preferences, room_acoustics):
    zones = []
    for source in sound_sources:
        zone = Zone(center=source.location, radius=calculate_radius(source.volume, room_acoustics))
        if user_preferences.include(zone):
            zone.adjust(user_preferences)
        zones.append(zone)
    return zones

function calculate_radius(volume, room_acoustics):
    # Based on room size, reverberation, and desired isolation
    radius =  volume * room_size_factor * reverberation_factor
    return radius

function adjust(user_preferences):
    # Apply user-defined settings (volume, equalization, etc.)
    # Implement noise cancellation or beamforming based on preference
    pass
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Open-plan offices: Creating private acoustic bubbles around individual workstations.
    *   Vehicles: Targeted audio for passengers, suppressing road noise.
    *   Home entertainment: Immersive spatial audio experiences.
    *   Accessibility: Enhancing speech clarity for individuals with hearing impairments.
