## Data Dependency Visualization with Predictive Stale Alerts

**Concept:** Expand the alerting system to *predict* data staleness based on historical refresh patterns and upstream data source latency, rather than solely reacting to missed refresh cadences. Introduce a dynamic, visual dependency map that highlights potential issues *before* they impact downstream consumers.

**Specifications:**

**1. Historical Refresh Pattern Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Time-series data of data entity refresh completion (success/failure, timestamp) over a configurable period (e.g., 30 days, 90 days).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Calculate the mean and standard deviation of refresh intervals for each data entity.
    *   Identify anomalies in refresh intervals (e.g., refreshes taking significantly longer than usual, skipped refreshes).
    *   Model refresh patterns using time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM).
*   **Output:**  Predicted refresh completion time for each data entity, probability of a missed refresh cadence, and confidence intervals.

**2. Upstream Latency Monitoring Module:**

*   **Input:**  Time-series data of data transfer completion (success/failure, timestamp) from upstream data sources to each data entity.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Calculate the mean and standard deviation of data transfer intervals.
    *   Identify anomalies in data transfer intervals.
    *   Model latency patterns using time-series forecasting algorithms.
*   **Output:** Predicted data arrival time from each upstream source, probability of delayed data arrival.

**3. Predictive Stale Alerting Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Outputs from Historical Refresh Pattern Analysis Module, Upstream Latency Monitoring Module, current refresh cadences, and user-defined thresholds.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Combine predictions from both modules to calculate a "Staleness Risk Score" for each data entity.  (e.g., Risk Score = (1 - Confidence in Refresh Prediction) + (Probability of Delayed Data Arrival) * WeightFactor).  WeightFactor allows prioritization of upstream or downstream risks.
    *   Trigger alerts based on Risk Score exceeding predefined thresholds.  Alerts should include predicted time of staleness and potential impact on downstream consumers.
    *   Alerts should be categorized by severity (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on Risk Score and potential impact.

**4. Dynamic Dependency Visualization Map:**

*   **Display:**  Interactive graph showing data entities as nodes and dependencies as edges.
*   **Features:**
    *   Color-code nodes based on Staleness Risk Score (e.g., Green = Low Risk, Yellow = Medium Risk, Red = High Risk).
    *   Display predicted time of staleness on nodes.
    *   Highlight critical path dependencies (e.g., dependencies that, if broken, would impact the largest number of downstream consumers).
    *   Allow users to drill down into individual data entities to view detailed refresh history, latency data, and alert information.
    *   Provide filtering and search capabilities to easily find specific data entities or dependencies.
    *   Users can set customizable thresholds for individual data entities to receive tailored alerts.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Stale Alerting Engine):**

```
function calculate_staleness_risk_score(refresh_confidence, latency_probability, weight_factor):
  risk_score = (1 - refresh_confidence) + (latency_probability * weight_factor)
  return risk_score

function trigger_alerts(data_entity, risk_score):
  if risk_score > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    severity = "High"
  elif risk_score > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    severity = "Medium"
  else:
    severity = "Low"

  alert_message = "Data entity " + data_entity.name + " has a " + severity + " risk of becoming stale. Predicted time of staleness: " + predicted_staleness_time
  send_alert(alert_message, data_entity.owner, data_entity.downstream_consumers)

for each data_entity in data_entities:
  refresh_confidence = get_refresh_confidence(data_entity)
  latency_probability = get_latency_probability(data_entity)
  risk_score = calculate_staleness_risk_score(refresh_confidence, latency_probability, WEIGHT_FACTOR)
  trigger_alerts(data_entity, risk_score)
```

This system moves beyond reactive alerts to proactively identify potential data staleness issues, providing valuable insights and allowing users to take preventative measures. The dynamic dependency visualization map enhances transparency and facilitates proactive monitoring of the data pipeline.
