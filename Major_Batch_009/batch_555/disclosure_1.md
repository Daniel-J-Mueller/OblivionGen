## Dynamic Trust Propagation & Recommendation Blending

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing social trust mechanism beyond individual member ratings to model *dynamic* trust propagation through network connections, and blend these trust-weighted recommendations with AI-generated ‘synthetic’ recommendations based on aggregated behavioral patterns.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   **Trust Network Graph:**  A directed graph where nodes represent users. Edge weights represent trust levels (0-1, float). Initial weights are user-defined (claims 6-12), but are *dynamically updated* (see Section II).
*   **Behavioral Profile:** Each user has a profile storing interaction data (purchases, views, reviews, etc.) categorized by product/service type.
*   **Synthetic Recommendation Profile:**  AI model output; represents recommendations for a user *without* relying on direct social connections.  This is a vector of product/service IDs with associated confidence scores.  Trained on global behavioral data.
*   **Recommendation Blend Weight:**  A float (0-1) representing the weight given to social recommendations vs. synthetic recommendations, per user and/or product category.

**II. Dynamic Trust Update Algorithm:**

1.  **Action-Based Updates:** When User A interacts with a product recommended by User B, the trust weight from A to B is updated:
    *   Positive Interaction (Purchase, Positive Review):  `Weight(A->B) = Weight(A->B) + Delta_Positive` (Delta_Positive is a small value, e.g., 0.01).
    *   Negative Interaction (Return, Negative Review): `Weight(A->B) = Weight(A->B) - Delta_Negative` (Delta_Negative is a small value, e.g., 0.02).
    *   No Interaction: `Weight(A->B)` decays slightly over time (e.g., -0.001 per day).

2.  **Propagation:** Trust propagates *indirectly* through the network. If A trusts B, and B trusts C, A's trust in C is calculated as: `Trust(A->C) = Trust(A->B) * Trust(B->C)`.  A maximum propagation depth is enforced (e.g., depth of 2 or 3) to prevent infinite propagation.
3.  **Trust Decay:**  All trust weights decay over time if no interaction occurs.

**III. Recommendation Generation:**

1.  **Social Recommendation Set:** For a given user, identify all connected users within the Trust Network Graph (up to a defined depth).  Gather all products interacted with by these connected users.  Score each product based on the *weighted sum* of trust levels from connecting users: `Score(Product) = Σ (Trust(User->Connector) * InteractionValue(Connector, Product))` where InteractionValue is a numerical representation of the interaction type (Purchase=5, View=1, Review=3, etc.).

2.  **Synthetic Recommendation Set:**  Run the AI model to generate a ranked list of recommendations for the user.

3.  **Blending:** Combine the Social Recommendation Set and Synthetic Recommendation Set. The final recommendation ranking is determined by:
    `FinalScore(Recommendation) = (BlendWeight * SocialScore(Recommendation)) + ((1 - BlendWeight) * SyntheticScore(Recommendation))`

4.  **Blend Weight Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the `BlendWeight` based on user behavior. If the user frequently overrides social recommendations with their own choices, decrease `BlendWeight`. If the user consistently accepts social recommendations, increase `BlendWeight`.

**IV. System Components:**

*   **Trust Network Manager:** Responsible for maintaining the Trust Network Graph and updating trust weights.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** Implements the recommendation generation and blending algorithms.
*   **AI Model Interface:** Provides an interface to the AI model for generating synthetic recommendations.
*   **User Interface:** Allows users to manage their social connections, adjust trust levels, and provide feedback on recommendations.
