## Adaptive Contextual Echo

**Concept:** Extend the existing progress data system to incorporate a "contextual echo" feature. This allows a voice assistant to proactively offer relevant continuations of interrupted processes *based on predicted user intent*, rather than solely relying on explicit resumption commands.

**Specs:**

**1. Intent Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Audio stream, user profile, current process data (from existing patent), historical interaction data, ambient sensor data (location, time of day, etc.).
*   **Process:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) or Transformer model trained on vast datasets of voice interactions. The model predicts the *most likely* next action a user would take, given the current context. This includes a confidence score for each prediction.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of predicted next actions with associated confidence scores.  Each action is represented as a structured data object containing process name, required parameters, and a short natural language prompt.

**2. Contextual Echo Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted next actions (from Intent Prediction Module), existing process data (from patent), user preferences (e.g., verbosity level).
*   **Process:** 
    1.  Filter predicted actions based on confidence score (threshold adjustable via user preferences).
    2.  If multiple actions exceed the threshold, prioritize based on relevance to user’s recent activity and historical data.
    3.  Generate a brief auditory "echo" prompt offering the predicted action. Example: “Resume composing email to John?” or “Continue playing the news briefing?”
    4.  Monitor user response (voice command, touch input, or lack of response).
    5.  If the user confirms (e.g., “yes”, affirmative voice command), resume the process immediately.
    6.  If the user declines (e.g., “no”, negative voice command) or remains silent after a predefined timeout, dismiss the echo prompt and revert to standard operation.

**3. Dynamic Echo Sensitivity:**

*   **Mechanism:**  An adaptive algorithm that automatically adjusts the frequency and verbosity of echo prompts based on user interaction patterns.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   *Acceptance Rate:* Percentage of echo prompts that are accepted by the user.
    *   *Rejection Rate:* Percentage of echo prompts that are explicitly rejected.
    *   *Silence Rate:* Percentage of echo prompts that are ignored.
*   **Logic:**
    *   High Acceptance Rate: Increase frequency and verbosity of prompts.
    *   High Rejection Rate: Decrease frequency and verbosity of prompts.
    *   High Silence Rate: Decrease frequency and verbosity of prompts, or introduce a longer timeout before dismissal.

**4.  Integration with Existing System:**

*   The Intent Prediction Module and Contextual Echo Engine operate as extensions to the existing progress data system described in the patent.
*   The system leverages existing user profiles and process data to personalize the echo prompts and ensure seamless integration with existing voice interactions.
*   Data logging for Intent Prediction and Echo Engine performance is critical to refine the models and optimize the user experience.
