## Adaptive Encoding Ladder Personalization via User Device Modeling

**Concept:** Extend event-adaptive encoding by incorporating individual user device characteristics into the selection of encoding ladders. Rather than optimizing for a broad "category of live content," tailor the encoding ladder *per user* based on their device capabilities and network conditions.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Modeling:**

1.  **Device Fingerprinting:** Implement a device fingerprinting system to collect data on:
    *   Processor Type & Speed
    *   GPU Capabilities
    *   Screen Resolution & Refresh Rate
    *   Supported Codecs
    *   Available Memory
    *   Operating System
2.  **Network Condition Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor the user’s network conditions (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) via:
    *   Periodic ping tests to CDN endpoints.
    *   Buffering event detection within the video player.
    *   Real-time throughput monitoring.
3.  **User Profile Creation:** Construct a ‘Device & Network Profile’ for each user. This profile aggregates the device fingerprint and network condition data.
4.  **Performance Modeling:** Develop a machine learning model that predicts the optimal encoding ladder (from a predefined set) *for a given Device & Network Profile*. This model should consider:
    *   Decoding complexity for the target device.
    *   Perceived video quality based on screen resolution/refresh rate.
    *   Buffering probability based on network conditions.
    *   Potential for frame dropping or stuttering.

**II. Encoding Ladder Selection & Adaptation:**

1.  **Pre-computed Ladder Database:** Maintain a database of pre-computed encoding ladders, each optimized for a specific range of device capabilities and network conditions. These ladders should cover a wide spectrum of scenarios.
2.  **Real-time Ladder Selection:** Upon a user initiating a live stream, query the Performance Model with the user’s Device & Network Profile. The model outputs the best-suited encoding ladder.
3.  **Dynamic Ladder Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the user’s network conditions during the live stream. If conditions deteriorate significantly, switch to a more conservative encoding ladder (lower bitrate, simpler encoding).  If conditions improve, switch to a more aggressive ladder.
4.  **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate user feedback (e.g., buffering events, reported quality issues) into the Performance Model to refine its predictions over time.

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Device Fingerprinting Module:** Integrated within the video player or CDN edge servers.
2.  **Network Monitoring Module:** Runs within the video player.
3.  **Performance Prediction Engine:** A cloud-based service that hosts the machine learning model. Accessible via API.
4.  **Encoding Ladder Database:**  A scalable storage system (e.g., object storage) that stores the pre-computed encoding ladders.
5.  **CDN Integration:** The CDN retrieves the selected encoding ladder from the database and delivers the encoded video streams to the user.

**Pseudocode (Encoding Ladder Selection):**

```
function selectEncodingLadder(userDeviceProfile, userNetworkProfile):
  // Query the Performance Prediction Engine
  predictedLadderID = PerformancePredictionEngine.predictLadder(userDeviceProfile, userNetworkProfile)

  // Retrieve the encoding ladder from the database
  encodingLadder = EncodingLadderDatabase.getLadder(predictedLadderID)

  return encodingLadder
```

**Novelty:**

Current adaptive encoding systems focus on *content* adaptation. This system introduces *user-centric* adaptation, tailoring the encoding ladder to the *individual user’s* device and network constraints, rather than a broad content category. This level of personalization should result in a significantly improved viewing experience.
