# 10836047

## Haptic Feedback Integration for Robotic Finger Assemblies

**Specification:** Integrate localized haptic feedback actuators directly *within* the robotic finger assemblies described in patent 10836047. This isn't about force sensing *of* the object, but simulating texture *to* the object.

**Components:**

*   **Micro-Vibration Actuators:** Miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or piezoelectric actuators embedded within the ‘first contact face’ and ‘second contact face’ of the finger body. Density: 1 actuator per 5mm<sup>2</sup> surface area.
*   **Texture Mapping Database:** A curated library of haptic ‘textures’ represented as amplitude/frequency patterns for the micro-vibration actuators.  Textures include coarse, smooth, ridged, and compliant.
*   **Control Module:** A dedicated microcontroller unit (MCU) integrated into the end effector assembly.  Receives texture commands from a central robot controller.
*   **Proximity Sensors:** Short-range capacitive or optical proximity sensors (1-2mm range) integrated into the contact faces to detect initial contact and adjust vibration intensity.
*   **Material Dampening Layer:** Thin layer of compliant polymer over actuators to diffuse vibration and create a more natural haptic effect.

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION ApplyHapticTexture(textureID, contactForce):
  // textureID: Identifier for desired texture from Texture Mapping Database
  // contactForce: Force exerted by the finger assembly onto the object (0-100%)

  textureData = GetTextureData(textureID) //Retrieve vibration pattern from database
  vibrationFrequency = textureData.frequency
  vibrationAmplitude = textureData.amplitude * contactForce //Scale amplitude with force

  FOR EACH actuator IN actuatorArray:
    actuator.activate(vibrationFrequency, vibrationAmplitude)
  END FOR
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION UpdateHapticFeedback(objectMaterial, contactForce):
  IF objectMaterial == "unknown":
    //Initial state, use default 'grip' texture
    textureID = "default_grip"
  ELSE:
    textureID = GetTextureIDForMaterial(objectMaterial)
  END IF

  ApplyHapticTexture(textureID, contactForce)
END FUNCTION

//Main loop:
WHILE (robot_is_active):
    contactForce = GetContactForce()
    objectMaterial = GetObjectMaterial()

    UpdateHapticFeedback(objectMaterial, contactForce)

    Delay(10ms)
END WHILE
```

**Refinement:**

*   The ‘object material’ could be determined by an integrated vision system (camera in the end effector) or an external sensor.
*   Implement variable texture application based on grip strength.  Higher grip = more intense vibration (simulating secure grasp).
*   Explore dynamic texture mapping – applying different textures to different areas of the contact face to simulate complex object shapes or features.
*   Add a “texture learning” mode where the system can record and store haptic feedback profiles for new materials.
