## Automated Component Health Prediction & Proactive Reconfiguration

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE). Software-defined, deployable on existing data center infrastructure.
*   **Data Acquisition:** 
    *   Real-time telemetry from switchable couplers (voltage, current, temperature, data throughput).
    *   Historical failure data for each component type.
    *   Environmental data (temperature, humidity) from data center monitoring systems.
    *   Log data from applications running on connected components.
*   **Prediction Model:** Hybrid approach - LSTM recurrent neural network for time-series data (telemetry), combined with a Bayesian network to incorporate contextual information (environmental factors, application load).  Trained continuously using federated learning across multiple data centers (privacy preserving).
*   **Failure Thresholds:** Dynamic, calculated based on component age, load, and predicted remaining useful life.
*   **Reconfiguration Engine:** Software module integrated with existing data center orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, OpenStack).  Capable of:
    *   Automated failover to redundant components.
    *   Proactive migration of workloads *before* predicted component failure.
    *   Dynamic adjustment of power allocation to optimize performance and extend component lifespan.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  PAE collects real-time telemetry and historical data.
2.  Prediction Model calculates probability of failure for each component within a defined timeframe (e.g., next 24 hours).
3.  If probability exceeds a predefined threshold, the Reconfiguration Engine is triggered.
4.  Reconfiguration Engine analyzes dependencies and potential impact of component failure.
5.  Reconfiguration Engine initiates proactive mitigation steps:
    *   **Workload Migration:**  Moves applications running on the predicted failing component to a healthy redundant component.
    *   **Power Adjustment:**  Decreases power allocation to the predicted failing component (if possible) to reduce stress and potentially prolong lifespan.
    *   **Alerting:**  Generates an alert for data center operators, providing details of the predicted failure and mitigation actions taken.

**Pseudocode (Reconfiguration Engine):**

```
FUNCTION Reconfigure(ComponentID, FailureProbability):
  IF FailureProbability > Threshold:
    Dependencies = GetDependencies(ComponentID)
    Workloads = GetWorkloadsRunningOn(ComponentID)
    TargetComponent = FindHealthyRedundantComponent(Dependencies)
    
    IF TargetComponent != NULL:
      MigrateWorkloads(Workloads, TargetComponent)
      AdjustPowerAllocation(ComponentID, ReducedPower)
      SendAlert(ComponentID, "Predicted failure. Workloads migrated to " + TargetComponent)
    ELSE:
      SendCriticalAlert(ComponentID, "Predicted failure. No redundant component available.")
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**  The combination of proactive workload migration *before* failure, dynamic power allocation, and federated learning for improved prediction accuracy. Existing systems typically focus on reactive failover *after* failure. This approach aims to *prevent* downtime and maximize component lifespan.
