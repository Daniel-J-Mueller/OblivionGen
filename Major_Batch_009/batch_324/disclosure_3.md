## Dynamic Credential Weighting & Temporal Drift Correction

**Concept:** Extend the ephemeral credential distribution by incorporating dynamic weighting based on real-time channel risk assessment *and* a mechanism to correct for temporal drift in channel assurance. Essentially, the system constantly re-evaluates the trustworthiness of each channel *during* the authentication process, adjusting credential portion size and validation priority accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Channel Health Monitoring Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time threat intelligence feeds (compromised email domains, known SMS phishing numbers, etc.).
    *   User behavioral analysis (historical successful/failed authentication attempts via specific channels).
    *   Network-level security data (IP reputation, geolocation anomalies).
    *   Channel-specific validation success/failure rates (e.g., SMS delivery rates, email bounce rates).
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assigns a dynamic risk score to each communication channel based on the aggregated data.  The score ranges from 0 (highly trustworthy) to 100 (highly compromised).
*   **Update Frequency:** Risk scores updated *every few seconds* during the authentication process, and continuously during periods of inactivity.

**2. Credential Partitioning & Weighting Algorithm:**

*   **Initial Partitioning:**  As in the reference patent, the ephemeral credential is initially divided into *n* portions.
*   **Dynamic Weight Assignment:**  Before sending each portion, the system calculates a weight for each channel based on its current risk score:
    *   `Weight(channel) = 1 - (RiskScore(channel) / 100)`
*   **Portion Sizing:** The size of each credential portion sent to a given channel is *proportional* to its weight.  Higher weight = larger portion.
*   **Portion Entropy Adjustment:** Beyond size, the *complexity* of the credential portion can be adjusted. Higher weight channels receive more complex (higher entropy) portions.

**3. Temporal Drift Correction:**

*   **Expected Latency Modeling:** The system maintains a baseline expectation for the delivery time of each channel.
*   **Latency Deviation Monitoring:** During the authentication process, the actual delivery time of each portion is monitored.
*   **Drift Detection:** Significant deviations from the expected latency trigger a "drift alert".
*   **Dynamic Re-weighting:** If drift is detected, the system *immediately* reduces the weight of the drifting channel and redistributes the corresponding credential portion to higher-assurance channels.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Drift thresholds are *dynamically adjusted* based on channel historical performance and current network conditions.

**4.  Validation Protocol:**

*   **Prioritized Validation:** Channels with higher weights (and thus larger/more complex portions) are validated *first*.
*   **Parallel Validation:** Validation attempts are made in parallel across all channels.
*   **Adaptive Timeout:** Timeout values for validation are dynamically adjusted based on channel latency and risk score.
*   **Partial Authentication:** If a sufficient number of high-assurance portions are successfully validated, authentication can proceed even if some lower-assurance channels fail.

**Pseudocode (Credential Partitioning & Weighting):**

```
// Inputs:
//   credential - The ephemeral security credential
//   channels - List of available communication channels
//   riskScores - Dictionary mapping channel to current risk score

function partitionCredential(credential, channels, riskScores):

  totalWeight = 0
  for channel in channels:
    weight = 1 - (riskScores[channel] / 100)
    totalWeight += weight

  portions = {}
  for channel in channels:
    weight = 1 - (riskScores[channel] / 100)
    portionSize = int((weight / totalWeight) * len(credential)) // Size of portion
    portion = credential[:portionSize]
    credential = credential[portionSize:]
    portions[channel] = portion

  return portions
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Dynamically adapts to changing threat landscape and channel reliability.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Minimizes disruption by prioritizing high-assurance channels and allowing for partial authentication.
*   **Reduced False Positives:**  Intelligent weighting reduces the impact of transient channel failures.
*   **Scalability:** Adaptable to a wide range of communication channels and authentication scenarios.
