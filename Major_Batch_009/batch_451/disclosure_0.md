## Dynamic Fingerprint Weighting based on Environmental Audio

**Concept:** Expand the fingerprinting system to dynamically adjust the weighting of different frequency bands within the fingerprint based on the ambient audio environment detected *at the output device*. This allows for more robust content recognition in noisy or reverberant environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Environmental Audio Capture:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrate a secondary microphone array (or utilize existing array if available) within the output device. This array should be distinct from the primary audio input used for content decoding.
*   **Sampling Rate:** 44.1 kHz, 16-bit depth.
*   **Analysis Window:** 20ms sliding window with 50% overlap.

**2. Environmental Audio Analysis:**

*   **Frequency Spectrum:** Perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on each analysis window to obtain the frequency spectrum of the ambient audio.
*   **Noise Floor Estimation:** Calculate a running average of the FFT magnitude across all frequency bands to establish a baseline noise floor.
*   **Dominant Frequency Identification:** Identify frequency bands with magnitudes significantly exceeding the noise floor (e.g., 6dB or more). These are considered 'dominant' frequencies related to the environment.
*   **Reverberation Detection:** Implement a metric (e.g., decay time of dominant frequencies) to estimate the level of reverberation in the environment.

**3. Dynamic Fingerprint Weighting:**

*   **Fingerprint Generation:** Standard fingerprint generation process as outlined in the original patent, generating a vector of features representing the decoded audio.
*   **Weight Adjustment:**
    *   For frequency bands corresponding to dominant frequencies in the ambient audio, *reduce* the weight assigned to those bands in the fingerprint vector.  The reduction factor should be proportional to the magnitude of the dominant frequency.
    *   For frequency bands *not* corresponding to dominant frequencies, *increase* the weight. This emphasizes features less likely to be masked by environmental noise.
    *   If a high level of reverberation is detected, increase the weighting of lower frequency bands (which are less affected by reverberation) and reduce the weighting of higher frequencies.
*   **Normalization:** Normalize the adjusted fingerprint vector to maintain a consistent overall magnitude.

**4.  Transmission & Matching:**

*   Transmit the dynamically weighted fingerprint along with environmental metadata (dominant frequencies, reverberation level) to the central matching system.
*   The matching system must be updated to incorporate the environmental metadata when comparing fingerprints.  The matching algorithm should prioritize frequency bands with higher weights and de-emphasize bands with lower weights.

**Pseudocode (Weight Adjustment):**

```
// fingerprint: Vector of fingerprint features
// env_dominant_freqs: List of dominant frequencies in the environment
// env_reverb_level:  Reverberation level (0-1)

for i in range(length(fingerprint)):
  weight = 1.0  // Default weight

  // Reduce weight if frequency corresponds to dominant environmental frequency
  if frequency(i) in env_dominant_freqs:
    weight = 1.0 - (magnitude(env_dominant_freqs[frequency(i)]) / max_magnitude)

  // Adjust for reverberation
  if env_reverb_level > 0.5:
    if frequency(i) > 2000:  //Example threshold
      weight *= (1.0 - env_reverb_level)

  fingerprint[i] *= weight

// Normalize fingerprint
fingerprint = normalize(fingerprint)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved content recognition accuracy in noisy or reverberant environments.
*   More robust performance across a wider range of acoustic conditions.
*   Reduced false positives caused by environmental sounds.
