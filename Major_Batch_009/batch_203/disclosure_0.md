## Adaptive Mood Lighting with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Expand the linear lighting element to function as a dynamic biofeedback display, reflecting the user’s emotional and physiological state through color, intensity, and pattern variations.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate a suite of non-invasive biosensors into the device housing. These include:
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor for heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) measurement.
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor for detecting changes in sweat gland activity (stress/excitement).
    *   Microphone array for voice tone analysis (emotional state detection).
    *   Optional: Temperature sensor for skin temperature monitoring.

*   **Data Processing Unit:** Embedded microcontroller or dedicated processor to handle sensor data acquisition, filtering, and analysis. Implement algorithms for:
    *   Real-time HRV analysis to determine stress levels and relaxation states.
    *   GSR peak detection and analysis to identify emotional arousal.
    *   Voice tone analysis to detect sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
    *   Sensor fusion – combine data from multiple sensors for a more accurate and holistic assessment of user state.

*   **Lighting System:** Utilize the existing linear light bar, enhanced with:
    *   Addressable RGB LEDs – Allow for precise color control and dynamic patterns.
    *   Diffuser Optimization – Design diffuser with varying density to create gradients and smooth transitions.
    *   Software-defined lighting profiles – Pre-programmed lighting sequences associated with specific emotional states (e.g., calm blue for relaxation, energetic yellow for focus, empathetic purple for sadness).
    *   Customization Options – User-adjustable brightness, color palettes, and pattern speeds via a companion app.

*   **Interaction Modes:**
    *   **Passive Mode:** Lighting subtly reflects the user's baseline emotional state.
    *   **Active Mode:** Lighting responds dynamically to changes in emotional state – brighter/faster during excitement, dimmer/slower during relaxation.
    *   **Guided Mode:**  Companion app provides guided meditation or relaxation exercises, with lighting synchronized to the exercises.
    *   **Biofeedback Training:**  Companion app provides real-time visual feedback via the lighting bar, helping the user learn to control their physiological responses (e.g., heart rate, GSR) to achieve a desired state.

*   **Companion App:**
    *   Data Visualization – Display real-time and historical sensor data.
    *   Profile Management –  Create and customize lighting profiles.
    *   Settings – Adjust sensor sensitivity, lighting brightness, and other parameters.
    *   Integration with other health and wellness apps.

**Pseudocode (Data Processing & Lighting Control):**

```
// Sensor Data Acquisition
heartRate = readHeartRate()
gsrLevel = readGSR()
voiceTone = analyzeVoiceTone()

// Emotional State Estimation
stressLevel = calculateStress(heartRate, gsrLevel, voiceTone)
mood = determineMood(stressLevel, voiceTone)

// Lighting Control
if (mood == "calm"):
    color = blue
    brightness = 0.3
    pattern = slow_fade
elif (mood == "focused"):
    color = yellow
    brightness = 0.7
    pattern = pulsing
elif (mood == "excited"):
    color = red
    brightness = 1.0
    pattern = fast_strobe
else:
    color = white
    brightness = 0.5
    pattern = static

setLinearLightBar(color, brightness, pattern)
```
