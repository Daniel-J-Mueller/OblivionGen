## Adaptive Block Prefetching & Tiering

**Concept:** Extend the block pool concept by introducing predictive prefetching and tiered storage based on access patterns *within* the file system itself. This moves beyond simply having a pool of readily available blocks to intelligently anticipating which blocks will be needed and staging them on faster storage tiers.

**Specification:**

**1. Block Metadata Augmentation:**

*   Each block in the block pool will have associated metadata including:
    *   `last_access_time`: Timestamp of the last read/write operation.
    *   `access_count`: Number of times the block has been accessed within a defined period.
    *   `predicted_access_time`:  A dynamically calculated time indicating when the block is *likely* to be accessed again. (See Prediction Algorithm below).
    *   `storage_tier`: Integer representing the current storage tier (e.g., 1=NVMe, 2=SSD, 3=HDD).

**2. Prediction Algorithm (executed as a background process on the file server):**

*   **Input:** Historical access data for all blocks in the pool.
*   **Method:** Implement a time series forecasting model (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, or a simple moving average) to predict future access times for each block.
    *   Consider seasonal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly) if applicable.
    *   Weight recent access patterns more heavily than older ones.
*   **Output:**  `predicted_access_time` for each block.

**3. Tiered Storage Management:**

*   **Storage Tiers:** Define multiple storage tiers with varying performance characteristics and costs (e.g., NVMe SSD, SATA SSD, HDD).
*   **Tiering Policy:**  Implement a policy that dynamically moves blocks between tiers based on their `predicted_access_time` and `access_count`.
    *   **Hot Tier (NVMe/SSD):** Blocks with high `access_count` and low `predicted_access_time` are promoted to the hot tier.
    *   **Warm Tier (SSD/HDD):** Blocks with moderate `access_count` and `predicted_access_time` remain in the warm tier.
    *   **Cold Tier (HDD):** Blocks with low `access_count` and high `predicted_access_time` are demoted to the cold tier.

**4. Prefetching Mechanism:**

*   Monitor file system I/O requests.
*   Identify sequential read patterns.
*   Asynchronously prefetch blocks that are likely to be read next based on the sequential pattern and the block's current storage tier.
*   Prefetch to a local read cache in memory if available, or to a higher storage tier.

**5.  Implementation Details:**

*   Background process to run the prediction algorithm and tiering policy (e.g., runs every 5 minutes).
*   Configurable parameters for the prediction algorithm (e.g., smoothing factor, time window).
*   Configurable thresholds for moving blocks between tiers.
*   Utilize a caching mechanism (e.g., LRU) to manage the local read cache.
*   Integration with the existing block pool management system.

**Pseudocode (Tiering Policy):**

```
FOR EACH block IN block_pool:
  IF block.access_count > HIGH_THRESHOLD AND block.predicted_access_time < SHORT_TIME:
    MOVE block TO Tier 1 (NVMe/SSD)
  ELSE IF block.access_count > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD AND block.predicted_access_time < MEDIUM_TIME:
    MOVE block TO Tier 2 (SSD)
  ELSE:
    MOVE block TO Tier 3 (HDD)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency for frequently accessed data.
*   Improved overall file system performance.
*   Optimized storage costs by tiering data based on access patterns.
*   Proactive data staging for improved responsiveness.
