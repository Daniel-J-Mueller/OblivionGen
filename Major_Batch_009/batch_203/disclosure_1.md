# 10956446

**Contextualized Predictive Conflict Resolution & ‘Shadow Editing’**

**Specification:** A system extension to the log-based synchronization described in patent 10956446, incorporating predictive conflict resolution based on user behavior modeling and a ‘shadow editing’ feature for near real-time collaborative awareness.

**I. Core Concept:**

The system will learn individual user editing patterns (e.g., common phrases, typical structural changes, frequently modified elements) and use this information to *predict* potential conflicts *before* they arise during synchronization.  Simultaneously, a ‘shadow editing’ feature will provide a low-latency, partial-state reflection of another user’s edits, facilitating faster awareness and preemptive adjustment.

**II. System Components & Interactions:**

1.  **User Behavior Model (UBM):** Each user will have a UBM, continuously updated via a machine learning model. This model tracks:
    *   **Lexical Patterns:** Frequency of words/phrases, common sentence structures.
    *   **Structural Changes:** Type & frequency of formatting changes, list/table manipulations.
    *   **Element Focus:**  Which elements (headings, paragraphs, images, etc.) a user frequently modifies.
    *   **Temporal Patterns:** Time of day/week user edits, duration of sessions.
2.  **Conflict Prediction Engine:** This engine operates on incoming change descriptors from other users. Before applying changes locally, it:
    *   Compares incoming changes to the *local* UBM.
    *   Scores potential conflict based on:
        *   Overlap in modified elements.
        *   Similarity in editing style (from UBM).
        *   Temporal proximity of edits.
    *   If the conflict score exceeds a threshold:
        *   Triggers a *preemptive* conflict notification to the user.
        *   Presents a ‘resolution preview’ – a visual rendering of the potential conflict.
        *   Allows the user to *preemptively* adjust their local edits.
3.  **‘Shadow Editing’ Feature:**
    *   As another user makes edits, a *minimal* set of change descriptors is immediately transmitted to the local device (before full synchronization).
    *   These changes are *applied to a temporary, local ‘shadow’ copy* of the document.
    *   The user sees a visual indication of these changes happening on the shadow copy.
    *   This creates a low-latency awareness of another user’s activity.
    *   The user can *choose* to incorporate these changes into their main working copy.

**III.  Data Structures & Pseudocode:**

*   `UserBehaviorModel`:
    *   `lexicalPatterns`:  `Dictionary<string, float>` (word/phrase -> frequency)
    *   `structuralChanges`: `Dictionary<string, float>` (change type -> frequency)
    *   `elementFocus`: `Dictionary<string, float>` (element type -> frequency)
    *   `temporalPatterns`: `List<TimeInterval>` (edit time ranges)
*   `ChangeDescriptor`: (as defined in the patent)
*   `ConflictScore`: (float representing probability of conflict)

```pseudocode
// On receiving change descriptors from another user:

calculateConflictScore(changeDescriptors, localUserBehaviorModel)

if conflictScore > threshold:
  displayPreemptiveConflictNotification(changeDescriptors, conflictScore)
  displayResolutionPreview(changeDescriptors)
  allowPreemptiveAdjustment()

// Shadow Editing:

onReceivingMinimalChangeDescriptors(changeDescriptors):
  applyChangeDescriptorsToShadowCopy(changeDescriptors)
  displayShadowCopyUpdates()
```

**IV.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer model would be suitable for capturing sequential editing patterns.
*   **Minimal Change Descriptors:**  Optimize the transmission of change descriptors for shadow editing. Only transmit the essential data to render the visual update.
*   **Conflict Resolution Preview:** A visual diffing tool to highlight conflicting regions.

**V. Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Assisted Resolution:** Suggest automatic resolutions based on user preferences and context.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** Dynamically adjust the conflict score threshold based on user behavior and document complexity.
*   **Collaborative ‘Shadow Editing’**: Allow multiple users to view and interact with the same shadow copy.
