## Dynamic Specification-Driven Component Composition

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic specification auditing system to actively *compose* distributed system components based on real-time specification conformance. Instead of simply verifying existing components, the system becomes a platform for building systems *from* compliant building blocks.

**Specifications as Contracts:** Treat the specification not just as a verification target, but as a formal contract for component interaction. Components *advertise* their conformance to specific specification subsets. 

**Component Registry:** A central registry maintains a catalog of available components, each tagged with the specification portions it satisfies. This registry is actively updated by components themselves (via heartbeat/status messages) and the dynamic specification manager.

**Dynamic Assembly Engine:** A core engine, integrated with the dynamic specification manager, analyzes requested system behavior (expressed as a high-level specification) and dynamically assembles components from the registry to fulfill that behavior. This assembly is not static; it can adapt to changing loads, failures, or specification updates.

**Specifications as Routing Keys:** Use specification conformance information as a routing mechanism. Requests are tagged with the required specification elements, and the system routes them to components capable of handling those elements.

**Specs:**

1.  **Component Advertisement Protocol:**
    *   Each component periodically broadcasts (or registers with) the dynamic specification manager, listing the specification sections it implements (e.g., “Specification v1.2, Section 3.1 – Data Validation, Section 4.2 – Authentication”).
    *   The message includes a version identifier for the specification it claims conformance to.
    *   A ‘health’ status indicator is included to allow for graceful degradation and failover.
    *   Message Format: `{componentID: "X", specificationSections: ["3.1", "4.2"], version: "1.2", health: "OK"}`

2.  **Request Specification Tagging:**
    *   Incoming requests are tagged with the relevant specification sections required for processing.
    *   Example: A request to process customer data might be tagged with `specificationTags: ["3.1", "4.3"]`.

3.  **Dynamic Assembly Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function assembleComponents(request, specificationTags):
  availableComponents = queryComponentRegistry(specificationTags)
  if availableComponents is empty:
    return error("No components found matching specification tags")

  componentChain = []
  currentComponent = selectBestComponent(availableComponents, request) // Criteria: latency, load, version

  while currentComponent is not null:
    componentChain.append(currentComponent)
    nextComponentSpecificationTags = determineNextComponentRequirements(currentComponent, request) // What does this component need *from* the next component?
    
    availableNextComponents = queryComponentRegistry(nextComponentSpecificationTags)

    if availableNextComponents is empty:
      break  // End of chain - no suitable component found

    currentComponent = selectBestComponent(availableNextComponents, request)

  return componentChain // A list of component IDs in execution order
```

4.  **Specification Versioning & Rollback:**
    *   The dynamic specification manager maintains a history of specification versions.
    *   Components can be associated with specific specification versions.
    *   If a new specification version introduces incompatibilities, the system can rollback to a previous version for specific components, enabling gradual updates.

5.  **Automated Component Creation (Sandboxing):**
    *   Provide a sandbox environment where new components can be developed and tested against the specification.
    *   Automated testing frameworks verify compliance before deployment.
    *   This allows for rapid innovation and adaptation to changing requirements.
