## Secure Data 'Dusting' - Portable Data Sanitization & Verification

**Concept:** Expanding on the physical media transfer concept, introduce a portable, automated system for securely sanitizing and verifying data on portable storage *before* it leaves the customer's possession, and *before* it’s shipped for storage. This addresses data breach concerns stemming from potential physical media compromise during transit.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Name:** Data Duster Pro
*   **Form Factor:** Ruggedized, briefcase-sized enclosure. Internal modular design.
*   **Core Modules:**
    *   **Universal Drive Bay:** Accepts a wide range of portable storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, USB drives, optical discs). Automated drive detection.
    *   **Secure Erase Engine:** Hardware-accelerated, multi-pass data sanitization. Supports DoD 5220.22-M, NIST 800-88, and custom erasure patterns.
    *   **Cryptographic Verification Engine:** Hardware-based SHA-256/SHA-512 hashing. Generates cryptographic signatures of the sanitized device's contents (empty space).
    *   **Tamper-Evident Sealing System:** Automated application of tamper-evident seals to the drive bay after sanitization and verification. Unique serial number on each seal.
    *   **Communication Module:** Wired Ethernet and Wireless (802.11ax) connectivity.
    *   **User Interface:** Touchscreen display for initiating processes, viewing status, and managing configurations.
    *   **Power Supply:** Internal rechargeable battery and external power adapter.

**Operation:**

1.  Customer inserts portable storage device into the Universal Drive Bay.
2.  Data Duster Pro detects the device type and available capacity.
3.  Customer selects desired sanitization level (DoD, NIST, Custom).
4.  Device undergoes secure erasure using the Secure Erase Engine.
5.  Cryptographic Verification Engine generates a hash of the erased device.
6.  The device’s empty state is verified against a known good state.
7.  Tamper-evident seals are applied with a unique serial number.
8.  A digital certificate containing the hash, serial number, sanitization level, and timestamp is generated and stored locally, and optionally transmitted to a secure cloud repository.
9.  The customer ships the sealed device.

**Software Components:**

*   **Embedded OS:** Lightweight Linux distribution.
*   **Secure Boot:** Ensures only authorized software runs on the device.
*   **Remote Management API:** Allows integration with existing data management systems.
*   **Cloud Integration:** API for transmitting verification data to a secure cloud repository for long-term auditability.

**Pseudocode for Verification Process:**

```
FUNCTION VerifyDevice(device)
  // Read all sectors from the device
  sectors = ReadAllSectors(device)

  // Calculate expected hash based on all zero sectors
  expected_hash = SHA256(zeros(sector_count))

  // Calculate actual hash of the device's contents
  actual_hash = SHA256(sectors)

  // Compare hashes
  IF actual_hash == expected_hash THEN
    RETURN True // Device is verified as empty
  ELSE
    RETURN False // Device failed verification
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simply encrypting data in transit. It provides *proof* of data sanitization *before* shipment, creating a verifiable chain of custody and reducing the risk of data breaches from compromised physical media. The digital certificate and tamper-evident seals provide an additional layer of security and auditability.
