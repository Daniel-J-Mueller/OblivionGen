## Dynamic Network Address “Sharding” & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend dynamic network address allocation beyond simply increasing/decreasing allocations based on VM counts. Implement a system that “shards” the network address space, proactively pre-allocating address ranges to subdivisions based on *predicted* future VM density *and* application profiles.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on reactive allocation. This approach anticipates need, reducing allocation latency and potential network congestion.  By predicting demand, we move from allocation-on-demand to allocation-in-anticipation. This is especially useful for applications with bursty traffic or known scaling patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Modeling Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical VM creation/destruction rates per subdivision, Application profiles (CPU, memory, network I/O characteristics), Time of day/week/year, External events (e.g., scheduled backups, marketing campaigns).
*   **Process:** Employ a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future VM density per subdivision. Incorporate application profile data to estimate network bandwidth requirements per VM.  Model predictive uncertainty—provide confidence intervals for VM count and bandwidth predictions.
*   **Output:**  Predicted VM count, predicted bandwidth demand, confidence intervals, and a “demand score” for each subdivision.

**2. Address Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted VM count, demand score, available network address space, current address allocations, sharding parameters (shard size, maximum shards per subdivision).
*   **Process:**  Dynamically divide the network address space into “shards.” Assign shards to subdivisions based on predicted demand.  Prioritize contiguous shard allocation to minimize routing complexity.  Implement a shard lifecycle management system (creation, assignment, release). 
*   **Output:** Shard assignments, shard metadata (size, assigned subdivision, status).

**3.  Prefetching Service:**

*   **Input:** Shard assignments, predicted VM density, application profiles.
*   **Process:** Proactively pre-allocate network addresses within assigned shards to subdivisions *before* VMs are created.  Implement a “just-in-time” allocation within pre-allocated shards to minimize memory usage.  Monitor allocation rates and adjust pre-allocation levels dynamically.
*   **Output:** Pre-allocated address ranges for each subdivision.

**4.  Router Configuration API:**

*   **Input:** Shard assignments, pre-allocated address ranges.
*   **Process:** Programmatically configure routers to advertise pre-allocated address ranges. Implement a routing policy that prioritizes traffic within pre-allocated shards.
*   **Output:** Router configuration files.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Predictive Modeling Module
function predictDemand(historicalData, applicationProfiles, externalEvents) {
  // Time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., LSTM)
  predictedVMCount = LSTM(historicalData, applicationProfiles, externalEvents);
  predictedBandwidth = calculateBandwidth(predictedVMCount, applicationProfiles);
  demandScore =  predictedVMCount * predictedBandwidth;
  return demandScore;
}

// Address Sharding Engine
function allocateShards(demandScore, availableAddressSpace, shardingParameters) {
  shardSize = shardingParameters.shardSize;
  maxShardsPerSubdivision = shardingParameters.maxShardsPerSubdivision;

  numShards =  min(maxShardsPerSubdivision, floor(demandScore / shardSize));
  assignedShards = selectContiguousShards(availableAddressSpace, numShards);

  return assignedShards;
}

// Prefetching Service
function preallocateAddresses(assignedShards, predictedVMCount) {
  preallocatedAddresses = [];
  for (shard in assignedShards) {
    // Allocate addresses within the shard (e.g., based on predicted VM count)
    numAddresses = floor(predictedVMCount / numShards);
    addresses = allocateAddresses(shard, numAddresses);
    preallocatedAddresses.push(addresses);
  }
  return preallocatedAddresses;
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:** Routers with programmable data planes capable of handling dynamic routing policies.  High-speed network interfaces to support prefetching.

**Potential Benefits:** Reduced network latency, improved application performance, increased network scalability, more efficient network resource utilization.
