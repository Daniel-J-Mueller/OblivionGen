## Adaptive Password Complexity Scoring

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust password complexity requirements based on real-time threat intelligence and user-specific risk profiles. Move beyond static “strong password” rules to a fluid system that prioritizes security where it’s needed most, and reduces friction for lower-risk users.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Threat Intelligence Feed Integration:**
    *   Consume data from multiple threat intelligence sources (e.g., breached password databases, known credential stuffing attack patterns, emerging malware campaigns).
    *   Data points include: 
        *   Frequency of password exposure in breaches.
        *   Patterns of attacks targeting specific industries or user demographics.
        *   Regional threat levels.
2.  **User Risk Profiling:**
    *   Develop a risk score for each user, considering:
        *   Account type (e.g., administrator, standard user).
        *   Account age.
        *   Login frequency and location.
        *   Recent account activity (e.g., changes to security settings, large transactions).
        *   Device information (e.g., operating system, browser, known vulnerabilities).
3.  **Dynamic Complexity Scoring:**
    *   Assign a baseline complexity score to all users.
    *   Adjust the complexity score *upward* based on:
        *   High-risk threat intelligence (e.g., a breach of passwords used on a service similar to ours).
        *   Increased user risk (e.g., a user logging in from a new location).
    *   Adjust the complexity score *downward* based on:
        *   Low-risk threat intelligence.
        *   Decreased user risk (e.g., a long-term, trusted user with consistent login patterns).
4.  **Complexity Factors:**
    *   Define a set of complexity factors, each with a weighted score:
        *   Password length
        *   Character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
        *   Password age
        *   Presence in known breached password lists
        *   Use of common patterns or dictionary words
    *   Calculate a total complexity score based on these factors.
5.  **Adaptive Requirements:**
    *   Set a minimum acceptable complexity score.
    *   Require users to meet or exceed this score when creating or changing passwords.
    *   Display a visual indicator of password strength, reflecting the total complexity score.
    *   Provide targeted guidance to users on how to improve their password strength, based on the specific factors that are lacking.
6.  **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    function calculate_password_complexity(password, user_profile, threat_intelligence) {
        length_score = calculate_length_score(password)
        diversity_score = calculate_diversity_score(password)
        breach_score = check_password_in_breach_database(password)
        pattern_score = check_password_for_common_patterns(password)

        total_complexity_score = (length_score * 0.3) + (diversity_score * 0.4) - (breach_score * 0.2) - (pattern_score * 0.1)

        # Adjust score based on user risk and threat intelligence
        user_risk_adjustment = get_user_risk_adjustment(user_profile)
        threat_intelligence_adjustment = get_threat_intelligence_adjustment(threat_intelligence)

        final_complexity_score = total_complexity_score + user_risk_adjustment + threat_intelligence_adjustment

        return final_complexity_score
    }

    function enforce_password_policy(user, new_password) {
        complexity_score = calculate_password_complexity(new_password, user, current_threat_intelligence)

        if (complexity_score >= minimum_acceptable_complexity) {
            update_password(user, new_password)
            return true
        } else {
            display_password_strength_indicator(complexity_score)
            display_password_improvement_tips(complexity_score)
            return false
        }
    }
    ```

7.  **Deployment Considerations:**
    *   A/B testing to validate the effectiveness of the dynamic policy.
    *   Monitoring of false positives and negative impacts on user experience.
    *   Regular updates to the threat intelligence feed.
