## Dynamic Evaporator Array with Localized TEC Control

**Concept:** Expand the thermal management beyond single or parallel evaporators to a dynamically reconfigurable array. Integrate microfluidic control within each evaporator to tailor working fluid flow based on localized heat load, coupled with individually controlled TECs.

**Specifications:**

*   **Evaporator Array:** Construct a modular array of micro-channel evaporators. Each evaporator is a self-contained unit, physically separated but thermally coupled to a common condenser/cold plate. Array size configurable, ranging from 4x4 to 8x8 units.
*   **Microfluidic Control:** Each evaporator incorporates micro-pumps and valves enabling independent control of working fluid flow rate. Flow rate adjustment based on sensor data (see below). Each microfluidic path is capable of complete blockage or full flow.
*   **Localized Temperature Sensing:** Each evaporator incorporates a dense array of micro-thermocouples (at least 16 per evaporator) to map the heat flux profile across the electronic component’s surface.
*   **Individual TECs:** Each evaporator is directly coupled with a small, high-efficiency TEC. The TEC functions to *precisely* control the inlet temperature of the working fluid, either assisting convection or actively suppressing it if the evaporator is sufficiently cooled.
*   **Control System:** A central controller (BMC or dedicated processor) collects temperature data from all evaporators and utilizes a predictive thermal model to optimize working fluid flow and TEC operation.
*   **Predictive Thermal Model:** An AI-driven thermal model predicts heat load distribution across the array based on workload and component usage.
*   **Working Fluid:** Utilize a low-boiling-point fluid with high thermal conductivity and low viscosity.
*   **Materials:** Evaporators constructed from copper or aluminum with micro-channel dimensions optimized for fluid flow and heat transfer.

**Pseudocode – Control Algorithm:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize evaporator array, temperature sensors, micro-pumps, TECs
Load initial thermal model

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {
    // Read Sensor Data
    Read temperature data from all evaporators
    
    // Predict Heat Load
    Predict heat load distribution using thermal model
    
    // Optimize Flow and TEC Operation
    For Each Evaporator {
        If (Predicted Heat Load > Threshold) {
            Increase micro-pump speed to increase fluid flow
            Activate TEC to pre-cool inlet fluid
        } Else {
            Decrease micro-pump speed or stop flow
            Deactivate or reduce TEC power
        }
    }
    
    // Adjust overall system operation based on array-level data
    If (Average Evaporator Outlet Temperature > Threshold){
        Increase condenser cooling capacity
    }
    
    //Update thermal model based on real-time sensor data
    Train Thermal Model
}
```

**Novelty:** This design moves beyond localized temperature control to *dynamic redistribution* of cooling capacity. By independently controlling flow and TECs for each evaporator, the system can actively shift cooling to hotspots, optimize overall thermal performance, and potentially reduce power consumption. This is a radical departure from traditional thermosiphon designs. The predictive thermal modeling allows for proactive cooling, anticipating heat loads before they become critical. The modularity and microfluidic control offer unprecedented flexibility and scalability.
