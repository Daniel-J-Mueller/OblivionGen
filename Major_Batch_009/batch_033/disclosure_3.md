## Secure Data 'Ghosting' & Temporal Key Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the secure deletion paradigm beyond key destruction to actively *re-encrypt* data with new, randomly generated keys at regular intervals, while also distributing key shards across geographically diverse, ephemeral compute instances. This creates a 'ghosting' effect – data remains encrypted but is perpetually inaccessible even *with* the original key, and the ability to decrypt is transient and requires re-assembly of the shards.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Segmentation:** Incoming sensitive data is segmented into fixed-size blocks (e.g., 64KB).
*   **Initial Encryption:** Each block is encrypted using a unique Data Encryption Key (DEK) generated by a Key Management Service (KMS).
*   **Temporal Re-Encryption Schedule:** A configurable schedule (e.g., hourly, daily) triggers re-encryption of *all* data blocks.
*   **Key Sharding:** Each DEK is sharded into `n` parts using a secret sharing algorithm (e.g., Shamir’s Secret Sharing).
*   **Ephemeral Compute Instances:** `n` short-lived (e.g., 15-minute TTL) compute instances are provisioned across geographically diverse availability zones. These instances have *no* persistent storage.
*   **Shard Distribution:** Each ephemeral instance receives *one* DEK shard. Shards are encrypted with a separate Transport Key.
*   **Access Control:** Access to data requires the following steps:
    1.  Identify the data blocks to be accessed.
    2.  Initiate a request to the shard manager.
    3.  The shard manager locates all `n` ephemeral instances holding the DEK shards.
    4.  The shard manager retrieves the encrypted shards from each ephemeral instance.
    5.  The shard manager decrypts the shards using the Transport Key.
    6.  The shard manager reconstructs the complete DEK.
    7.  The reconstructed DEK is used to decrypt the data blocks.
*   **Key Rotation:** The Transport Key itself is rotated frequently (e.g., weekly) using a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
*   **Audit Logging:** All key shard access, reconstruction attempts, and data decryption events are logged with digital signatures.
*   **TTL Enforcement:** Expired ephemeral instances are automatically terminated, ensuring that key shards are not permanently stored.

**Pseudocode (Shard Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstruct_dek(data_block_id):
  shard_list = shard_manager.get_shards(data_block_id) // Retrieves locations of shards
  shard_data = []
  for shard_location in shard_list:
    encrypted_shard = shard_manager.get_shard_data(shard_location)
    shard_data.append(encrypted_shard)

  dek_shard = decrypt_shards(shard_data, transport_key) // Using HSM

  dek = reconstruct_dek_from_shards(dek_shard) // Shamir's Secret Sharing

  return dek
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond simply deleting a key to creating a dynamic, transient encryption landscape.  Even if an attacker compromises the KMS, they still need to simultaneously compromise a distributed set of ephemeral compute instances *before* a key can be recovered. The constant re-encryption and key sharding add layers of complexity, making data breaches significantly more difficult.  The ephemeral nature of the key shard hosts reduces the long-term attack surface.
