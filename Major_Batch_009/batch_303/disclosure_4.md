## Adaptive Span Context Propagation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting span context propagation based on real-time network conditions and service latency.

**Core Concept:** Existing distributed tracing relies on static propagation of span context. This assumes a relatively stable network. However, in dynamic environments, unnecessary context propagation can increase overhead and negatively impact performance. This system introduces a mechanism to *selectively* propagate span context based on observed network health and service response times.

**Components:**

1.  **Network/Service Observer:** A lightweight agent deployed alongside each service. It monitors:
    *   Inter-service network latency (ping, TCP handshake times).
    *   Service response times (P50, P90, P99).
    *   Error rates.
2.  **Context Propagation Policy Engine:**  A centralized (or distributed consensus-based) component that defines policies for context propagation.  Policies are expressed as rules: 

    ```
    IF (network_latency_to_service_X > threshold_high) OR (service_X_response_time_P99 > threshold_high) THEN 
        DROP_SPAN_CONTEXT; 
    ELSEIF (network_latency_to_service_X > threshold_medium) THEN
        REDUCE_SPAN_CONTEXT_DETAIL; //Example: Remove tags, reduce sample rate.
    ELSE 
        PROPAGATE_FULL_SPAN_CONTEXT;
    ENDIF
    ```
    Policies can be dynamically updated without service restarts.
3.  **Span Context Interceptor:**  A component integrated into each serviceâ€™s ingress/egress points. It intercepts span context before propagation. It consults the Policy Engine, applies the appropriate rule, and modifies or drops the context accordingly.
4.  **Adaptive Sampling:** Integrate with existing sampling strategies. When span context is reduced or dropped, increase local sampling rates to capture more detail within the service without increasing overall tracing volume.

**Pseudocode (Span Context Interceptor):**

```
function intercept_outgoing_request(request, span_context):
    policy = get_propagation_policy(destination_service)
    
    if policy.condition(network_health, service_latency):
        if policy.action == "DROP":
            return null // Do not propagate span context
        elif policy.action == "REDUCE":
            span_context = reduce_span_context_detail(span_context)
            return span_context
        else: // Default: Propagate full context
            return span_context
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PropagationPolicy`: Contains a condition (function evaluating network/service metrics) and an action ("DROP", "REDUCE", "PROPAGATE").
*   `SpanContext`: Standard distributed tracing span context (e.g., trace ID, span ID, baggage).

**Novelty:**  While dynamic sampling exists, this goes further by dynamically adjusting *what* is propagated based on real-time network conditions, minimizing overhead when it matters most.  It addresses the limitations of static context propagation in volatile environments.
