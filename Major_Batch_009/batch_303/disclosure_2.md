## Dynamic Proximity-Based Augmented Reality 'Wishlist Trails'

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Mobile Application (iOS & Android) integrated with ARKit/ARCore.
*   **Data Source:** Utilizes the existing user profile and 'wishlist' data from the patent’s described system. Integrates with merchant databases (via API) for real-time inventory and pricing.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Smartphone with AR capabilities, GPS, and internet connectivity. Optional: AR glasses for hands-free experience.
*   **Networking:** Secure data transmission via HTTPS. Real-time updates via WebSockets.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Wishlist Activation:** User selects a ‘Trail’ mode within the app, activating their wishlist as an AR overlay.
2.  **Proximity Scanning:** The app continuously scans the environment using the phone's camera and GPS.
3.  **AR Trail Generation:** As the user moves, the app dynamically generates AR 'trails' leading to nearby merchants carrying items on their wishlist.
    *   **Trail Visualization:** Trails are visualized as glowing, color-coded lines or particles overlaid onto the real-world view. Color-coding indicates price range (Green = low, Yellow = medium, Red = high). Trail thickness represents distance.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Trails update in real-time based on user movement, merchant inventory changes, and pricing fluctuations. If an item is out of stock or the price increases significantly, the trail fades or disappears.
4.  **Merchant Information:**  Pointing the phone at a merchant along the trail displays augmented information:
    *   Merchant name, logo, rating.
    *   Specific items from the wishlist available at that location, along with pricing and real-time availability.
    *   Option to view a detailed product page or add the item to a shopping cart.
5.  **Gamification:**  Incorporate gamified elements to enhance engagement:
    *   'Wishlist Completion' badges for finding all items on the list.
    *   'Trailblazer' rankings based on the number of trails completed.
    *   Reward points for visiting merchants and making purchases.

**Pseudocode (Trail Generation):**

```
function generateTrail(userLocation, wishlistItems) {
  nearbyMerchants = getNearbyMerchants(userLocation)
  
  for each merchant in nearbyMerchants {
    for each item in wishlistItems {
      if (merchant.hasItem(item)) {
        distance = calculateDistance(userLocation, merchant.location)
        trail = createTrail(userLocation, merchant.location, distance)
        trail.color = getItemPriceColor(item)
        trail.addMerchantInfo(merchant, item)
      }
    }
  }

  return trailList
}

function getItemPriceColor(item) {
  price = item.price
  if (price < 20) {
    return GREEN
  } else if (price < 50) {
    return YELLOW
  } else {
    return RED
  }
}
```

**Innovation Focus:**

Transforms passive wishlists into interactive, location-based experiences.  Encourages physical exploration of retail spaces, bridging the gap between online browsing and in-store purchases. The dynamic nature of the trails and gamified elements provide a compelling user experience, driving engagement and potentially increasing sales for merchants.
