## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Variance Mapping

**Concept:** Extend microphone array compensation to create a dynamic, spatially-mapped acoustic scene representation, rather than purely enhancing beamforming or localization. This system will build a “sound map” of the environment, tracking the energy and movement of sound sources *over time*.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Microphone array (minimum 8 microphones, expandable). Dedicated DSP/FPGA for real-time processing. High-bandwidth memory (DDR5 or equivalent) for temporal data storage. Optional: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for array orientation tracking.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Energy Mapping Engine:** This is the core. It utilizes the existing per-microphone gain compensation (from the provided patent) *as a starting point*, but expands it.
        *   **Temporal Variance Calculation:** For each frequency band and microphone, calculate not just the current energy, but also the rate of change of that energy (variance over a short time window, e.g., 50-100ms). This creates a "dynamic energy signature."
        *   **Spatial Mapping:**  Map the dynamic energy signatures onto a 3D spatial grid centered on the microphone array.  The grid resolution should be adjustable. The grid can be a simple Cartesian grid, or a more advanced Octree structure for adaptive resolution.
        *   **Sound Source ‘Blooms’:** Represent sound sources as spatially-localized "blooms" of dynamic energy. Bloom size and intensity reflect energy level and rate of change.
    *   **Source Tracking Module:**
        *   **Kalman Filtering:** Implement a Kalman filter to track the movement of sound source blooms over time. Predict future bloom locations based on past trajectories.
        *   **Bloom Merging/Splitting:**  Implement logic to merge nearby blooms that likely originate from the same source.  Split blooms that diverge rapidly, indicating multiple sources.
    *   **Rendering/Visualization Module:**
        *   **3D Sound Map Display:**  Visualize the dynamic sound map in real-time, using color and intensity to represent energy levels and movement.
        *   **Augmented Reality Overlay:**  Optional: Project the sound map onto a live video feed (using AR glasses or a similar device) to provide a spatially-aware audio experience.
*   **Pseudocode (Energy Mapping Engine - Simplified):**

```
// Inputs:  microphoneSignals[numMics], referenceSignal, frequencyBands
// Outputs: soundMap[gridX][gridY][gridZ][frequencyBands]

for each frequencyBand in frequencyBands:
    for each mic in microphoneSignals:
        energy = calculateEnergy(mic, frequencyBand) //Uses existing gain compensation
        variance = calculateTemporalVariance(mic, frequencyBand, timeWindow)
        
        //Determine grid location for this microphone
        gridX, gridY, gridZ = mapMicrophoneToGrid(mic)
        
        soundMap[gridX][gridY][gridZ][frequencyBand] = energy + variance //Combine for dynamic signature
```

*   **Innovation:** This system goes beyond simply enhancing or localizing sound. It creates a *living* acoustic map of the environment, tracking the movement and behavior of sound sources over time. This has applications in surveillance, security, robotics, virtual/augmented reality, and environmental monitoring.

*   **Future work:** Integrating this system with machine learning to identify sound events, predict sound source behavior, and create more intelligent audio experiences. Exploring the use of beamforming to focus on specific sound source blooms.
