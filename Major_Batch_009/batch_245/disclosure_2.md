## Dynamic Icon Morphing & Predictive Filtering

**Specification:** Implement a system where objective icons aren't static representations, but morph dynamically based on user interaction *and* predictive data sourced from a knowledge graph.

**Core Concept:**  Extend the 'objective icon' concept beyond simple visual representation of characteristics. These icons become 'living' representations that adjust in appearance *and* function based on inferred user intent.

**Components:**

1.  **Knowledge Graph Integration:** A large-scale knowledge graph (populated with product data, user preferences, trending characteristics, etc.) feeds data to the icon system.  This graph allows for association between seemingly disparate characteristics.

2.  **Dynamic Icon Morphology:** Icons aren’t fixed images. They adapt visually.
    *   **Size:** Icon size changes proportional to feature importance *and* predicted user preference. (Larger = more relevant/desired).
    *   **Color Saturation/Hue:** Reflects the confidence level of the prediction. (High saturation = high confidence; hue indicates type of characteristic – e.g., performance, aesthetics, price).
    *   **Shape Distortion:** Subtle shape changes indicating relationships. (e.g., if 'waterproof' and 'durability' are strongly correlated in the knowledge graph, icons would subtly ‘flow’ toward each other during interaction).
    *   **Texture/Material Simulation**: Icons dynamically render with material and textures related to the feature. (e.g., a 'leather' icon shows a leather texture, a 'high-speed' icon shows motion blur).

3.  **Predictive Filtering Engine:**  Operates in parallel to the icon system.
    *   **Real-time Analysis:**  Monitors icon movements, dwell times, and selection frequencies.
    *   **Intent Inference:**  Predicts user intent *before* explicit selection. (e.g., if a user focuses on 'screen size' and then glances at 'battery life', the system infers a desire for portability).
    *   **Proactive Filtering:**  Automatically filters products that *don't* meet the inferred criteria. This filtering isn’t a binary 'include/exclude' but a *soft* filtering that adjusts product ranking.

4.  **Haptic/AR Feedback (Optional):**  If hardware allows, provide haptic feedback correlated to icon interaction (e.g., a ‘click’ sensation when an icon is selected) and AR overlay to highlight relevant product features in a real-world context.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Filtering Engine):**

```
// Data Structures
Feature: {name, type, weight}
Product: {features: [Feature], score: float}

// Function: updateProductScore(product, featureWeightChange)
function updateProductScore(product, featureWeightChange) {
    product.score += featureWeightChange * product.features.weight
}

// Function: predictIntent(userActions)
function predictIntent(userActions) {
    // Analyze user actions (icon movements, dwell times, selections)
    intent = analyze(userActions)

    // Lookup related features in Knowledge Graph
    relatedFeatures = knowledgeGraph.getFeatures(intent)

    // Calculate feature weights based on intent and user history
    featureWeights = calculateWeights(relatedFeatures, userHistory)

    return featureWeights
}

// Main Loop
while (userInteracting) {
    featureWeights = predictIntent(userActions)

    for each product in productList {
        for each feature in product.features {
            if (feature in featureWeights) {
                updateProductScore(product, featureWeights[feature])
            }
        }
    }

    // Sort productList by score
    productList.sort(by score)

    // Display updated productList
    display(productList)
}
```

**Novelty:**  Combines dynamic visual representation of features with proactive, predictive filtering driven by a knowledge graph.  This moves beyond simple icon selection to a system that *anticipates* user needs and adapts the displayed results accordingly.  The morphing icons provide a richer, more intuitive user experience, while the predictive filtering engine reduces cognitive load and improves search efficiency.
