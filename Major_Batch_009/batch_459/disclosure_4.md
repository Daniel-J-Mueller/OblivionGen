## Adaptive Communication Profiles & Contextual Prioritization

**Concept:** A system that dynamically adjusts communication profiles (voice quality, bandwidth allocation, notification style) *per contact* based on learned user behavior and real-time contextual data. It builds beyond simple permission granting to create nuanced communication experiences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Profile Building:**

*   **Behavioral Learning:** The system passively observes user interactions:
    *   **Communication Duration:** Length of calls/messages with each contact.
    *   **Response Time:** How quickly the user responds to each contact.
    *   **Communication Channel Preference:** Which communication method is chosen (voice, text, etc.).
    *   **Time of Day/Week:** When communication typically occurs.
    *   **Location Data (Optional/User Permission Required):** Where communication happens – home, work, transit, etc.
*   **Explicit User Feedback:**  A subtle "communication quality" slider appears after each interaction allowing users to rate the experience (e.g., "Was the audio clear?", "Was the notification helpful?").
*   **Contact Metadata:** Access to contact details (job title, relationship, etc. - with appropriate privacy controls) to infer context.
*   **Profile Storage:**  Each contact has an associated profile stored locally/in the cloud, containing learned preferences and inferred context.

**2. Contextual Awareness & Dynamic Adjustment:**

*   **Real-time Data Inputs:**
    *   **Device Status:** Battery level, network connectivity, current app usage.
    *   **Calendar Integration:**  Detects meetings, appointments, and available time slots.
    *   **Motion Detection:**  Detects if the user is walking, driving, or stationary.
    *   **Environmental Noise:**  Uses the microphone to assess ambient noise levels.
*   **Prioritization Engine:**  An algorithm that uses data from the profile and real-time inputs to determine communication priority and optimal settings.
    *   **High Priority:**  Emergency contacts, urgent work matters.  Settings: Highest audio quality, immediate notifications, bypass Do Not Disturb.
    *   **Medium Priority:**  Close friends/family, important work updates.  Settings: Balanced audio quality, delayed notifications if user is busy, respect Do Not Disturb.
    *   **Low Priority:**  Acquaintances, non-urgent updates.  Settings: Low audio quality, delayed notifications, grouped notifications.
*   **Adaptive Settings:**
    *   **Voice Codec Selection:** Dynamically choose the most appropriate codec (e.g., Opus, AAC) based on network conditions and contact priority.
    *   **Bandwidth Allocation:**  Allocate more bandwidth to high-priority contacts.
    *   **Notification Style:** Customize notification sounds, vibrations, and display behavior based on contact priority and user preferences.
    *   **Automatic Filtering:**  Filter out low-priority notifications when the user is in a meeting or driving.

**3.  Pseudocode Example – Prioritization Engine:**

```
function determinePriority(contact, userContext) {
  priorityScore = 0

  // Base score from learned behavior
  priorityScore += contact.profile.communicationFrequency * 0.5
  priorityScore += contact.profile.responseSensitivity * 0.3 // How sensitive is the user to this contact?
  priorityScore += contact.profile.preferredChannel * 0.2

  // Contextual adjustments
  if (userContext.isDriving) {
    priorityScore *= 0.2 // Reduce priority for safety
  }
  if (userContext.isMeeting) {
    priorityScore = 0 // Suppress all notifications
  }
  if (userContext.batteryLevel < 20) {
    priorityScore *= 0.5 // Reduce priority to conserve battery
  }

  // Assign priority level
  if (priorityScore > 0.7) {
    return "High"
  } else if (priorityScore > 0.3) {
    return "Medium"
  } else {
    return "Low"
  }
}
```

**4.  User Interface Considerations:**

*   **Privacy Controls:**  Users should have granular control over which data is collected and how it is used.
*   **Transparency:**  Provide users with insights into how the system is prioritizing communications.
*   **Customization:** Allow users to override the system's recommendations.
*   **Simple Configuration:**  Make it easy to manage communication profiles and preferences.
