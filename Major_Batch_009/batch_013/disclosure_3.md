## Dynamic Border Illumination & Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Integrate micro-LEDs within the extended electrode layer of the display stack, coupled with a localized haptic actuator array, to create a dynamic border capable of both visual and tactile signaling. This goes beyond simple ‘borderless’ aesthetics to provide contextual information and enhanced user interaction.

**Specifications:**

*   **Electrode Modification:** The extended electrode layer (as described in claim 1) will be constructed from a transparent conductive material capable of hosting micro-LEDs (e.g., ITO with embedded GaN micro-LEDs). Density: 500 LEDs/inch, configurable via software. Each LED individually addressable for color and intensity.
*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** A matrix of piezoelectric actuators will be co-located *underneath* the TFT backplane, aligned with the extended electrode perimeter. Actuator density: 200 actuators/inch. Each actuator independently controllable for pulse duration and amplitude.
*   **Layer Stack Integration:**
    1.  Cover Layer
    2.  Electrophoretic Layer
    3.  Extended Electrode Layer (with integrated micro-LEDs)
    4.  Insulating Layer (thin film, for electrical isolation and mechanical support)
    5.  TFT Backplane
    6.  Haptic Actuator Array
    7.  Driver Circuit/Flex Circuit (existing from the patent)
*   **Software Control:** A software driver will manage both the micro-LEDs and haptic actuators. Key functionalities:
    *   **Contextual Lighting:** The border illuminates in different colors/patterns to indicate notifications, charging status, active apps, or system alerts.
    *   **Haptic Notifications:** Pulsating haptic feedback patterns differentiate notification types (e.g., a slow pulse for email, a rapid burst for a phone call).
    *   **Edge Gestures:** User can interact with the illuminated edge – swiping or pressing to trigger actions (e.g., volume control, brightness adjustment, app switching).
    *   **Dynamic Framing:** Software dynamically alters the illuminated border to ‘frame’ content on screen, drawing attention to specific areas.
    *   **Procedural Generation:** Algorithmic creation of visual and tactile effects based on user input or system events.
*   **Power Management:** Dedicated power circuitry for the micro-LEDs and haptic actuators, optimized for low energy consumption.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) for electrode layer.
    *   GaN-based micro-LEDs for high efficiency and brightness.
    *   Piezoelectric ceramic or polymer for haptic actuators.
    *   Flexible and durable substrate for layer stack integration.

**Pseudocode (Edge Gesture Example):**

```
FUNCTION handleEdgeSwipe(swipeDirection, duration)
    IF swipeDirection == "left"
        IF duration > 0.5 seconds
            activateApp("Music Player")
        ELSE
            previousTrack()
        ENDIF
    ELSEIF swipeDirection == "right"
        nextTrack()
    ELSEIF swipeDirection == "up"
        increaseVolume()
    ELSEIF swipeDirection == "down"
        decreaseVolume()
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The haptic actuators can be tuned to provide varying degrees of feedback intensity and texture.
*   The software driver should allow for customization of the lighting and haptic patterns.
*   The system can be integrated with other sensors (e.g., proximity sensors) to provide more sophisticated interactions.
*   Explore the use of machine learning algorithms to predict user intent and adapt the lighting/haptic feedback accordingly.
