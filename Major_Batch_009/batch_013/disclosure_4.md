## Haptic Feedback Ring – ‘SenseRing’

**Core Concept:** Expand the ring’s functionality beyond audio/voice interaction to incorporate localized haptic feedback, creating a subtle notification and control system directly on the user's finger.

**Specifications:**

*   **Form Factor:** Maintain the general ring shape defined in the patent, but increase the overall width to accommodate haptic actuators and increased battery capacity. Target a width of 12-15mm.
*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** Implement an array of miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) embedded within the inner surface of the ring, specifically along the palmar (palm-side) and radial (thumb-side) aspects of the finger. Minimum 8 actuators, optimally 12-16.
*   **Actuator Control:** Each actuator is individually addressable via a microcontroller. This allows for complex haptic patterns and directional cues.
*   **Sensor Integration:**
    *   **Force Sensor:** Integrate a miniature force sensor on the palmar side of the ring to detect grip strength and gestures (e.g., a firm grip could trigger a specific action).
    *   **Proximity Sensor:** Add a short-range proximity sensor on the radial side to detect proximity to objects or other devices.
*   **Power Management:** Increase battery capacity by 30-50% compared to the original design. Implement wireless charging capability (Qi standard). Explore energy harvesting options (e.g., kinetic energy from finger movement).
*   **Materials:** Utilize biocompatible materials for all components in contact with the skin. Consider a flexible outer shell material (e.g., TPU) to enhance comfort.
*   **Software Interface:** Develop a software development kit (SDK) to allow third-party developers to create custom haptic experiences.

**Functional Scenarios:**

1.  **Directional Navigation:** Haptic feedback can subtly guide the user by activating actuators on the appropriate side of the finger.  For example, a navigation app could use left/right actuator pulses to indicate turns.
2.  **Contextual Notifications:** Different haptic patterns can represent different types of notifications (e.g., a long pulse for a phone call, a short burst for a text message).
3.  **Gesture Control:**  A firm grip could activate a voice assistant, while a pinch gesture could control media playback.
4.  **Biofeedback Integration:** Integrate with health and wellness apps to provide haptic feedback based on biometric data (e.g., a gentle pulse when stress levels are high).
5. **Security Authentication**: A unique haptic sequence only known to the user can be utilized for biometric/device authentication.
6. **Gaming Applications**: Haptic feedback can be mapped to in-game events to create more immersive experiences.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(notificationType) {
  if (notificationType == "phoneCall") {
    pattern = [actuator1:longPulse, actuator2:off, actuator3:off, actuator4:off];
  } else if (notificationType == "textMessage") {
    pattern = [actuator1:shortPulse, actuator2:off, actuator3:off, actuator4:off];
  } else if (notificationType == "navigationTurnLeft") {
    pattern = [actuator1:off, actuator2:shortPulse, actuator3:off, actuator4:off];
  } else {
    pattern = [actuator1:off, actuator2:off, actuator3:off, actuator4:off];
  }
  return pattern;
}

function activateHapticPattern(pattern) {
  for each actuator in pattern {
    if (actuator == "longPulse") {
      setActuatorState(actuatorID, HIGH, 500ms); // 500ms pulse
    } else if (actuator == "shortPulse") {
      setActuatorState(actuatorID, HIGH, 100ms); // 100ms pulse
    } else {
      setActuatorState(actuatorID, LOW);
    }
  }
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Miniaturization of haptic actuators and power management components.
*   Efficient heat dissipation to prevent discomfort.
*   Secure and reliable electrical connections.
*   Robustness to daily wear and tear.
*   Biocompatibility testing.
