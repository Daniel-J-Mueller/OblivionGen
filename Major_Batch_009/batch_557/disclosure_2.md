## Adaptive Chunking with Predictive Hashing

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts data chunk sizes *prior* to hashing, based on content analysis, aiming to minimize hash collisions and optimize deduplication efficiency. This is coupled with a predictive hashing model to proactively select hash functions *before* chunking even occurs.

**Components:**

1.  **Content Analyzer:** A module that scans incoming data streams and determines data characteristics. Key metrics include:
    *   Entropy (measure of randomness)
    *   Repetitive Pattern Detection (identifies repeating sequences)
    *   Data Type Identification (text, image, video, etc.)

2.  **Dynamic Chunk Sizer:** Based on the Content Analyzer's output, this module determines the optimal chunk size.
    *   High Entropy/Random Data: Smaller chunk size (e.g., 4KB) to increase granularity and reduce collision probability.
    *   Repetitive Patterns: Larger chunk size (e.g., 64KB or higher) to exploit redundancy and maximize deduplication.
    *   Data Type Specific Rules: Predefined chunk sizes for common data types (e.g., 128KB for video, 8KB for text).

3.  **Predictive Hash Function Selector:** A machine learning model trained on historical data chunk characteristics and hash collision rates. 
    *   Input: Data chunk characteristics (entropy, repetitive pattern score, data type).
    *   Output: A probability distribution over available hash functions. The hash function with the highest probability is selected.

4.  **Hashing & Lookup Table Generation:** Standard hashing process using the selected hash function. Generation of lookup tables as per the existing patent.

5.  **Adaptive Learning Module:** This module continuously monitors hash collision rates and adjusts the Predictive Hash Function Selector model accordingly. Reinforcement learning techniques can be employed to optimize hash function selection over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Ingestion
dataStream = receiveData()

// Content Analysis
chunkCharacteristics = analyzeContent(dataStream)  // Returns entropy, patternScore, dataType

// Predictive Hash Function Selection
selectedHashFunction = predictHashFunction(chunkCharacteristics)

// Dynamic Chunk Sizing
optimalChunkSize = determineChunkSize(chunkCharacteristics)

// Chunking and Hashing
chunks = splitDataIntoChunks(dataStream, optimalChunkSize)
for each chunk in chunks:
    hashValue = hash(chunk, selectedHashFunction)
    addToLookupTable(hashValue)

// Adaptive Learning
collisionRate = monitorHashCollisions()
updatePredictiveModel(collisionRate)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Chunk Characteristics:**  A data structure holding entropy, pattern score, data type, and other relevant metrics.
*   **Predictive Hash Function Model:**  A trained machine learning model (e.g., a neural network) that maps chunk characteristics to hash function probabilities.

**Considerations:**

*   Overhead of content analysis and model training.
*   Need for a diverse training dataset to ensure accurate prediction.
*   Potential for increased complexity in the system.
*   Requires a way to maintain a library of hash functions and update the Predictive Hash Function Model.
