**Community-Driven Dynamic Pricing & Reputation System**

**Concept:** Expand the idea of leveraging user communities to not just provide evaluation, but to *actively influence* pricing and establish a dynamic reputation score beyond simple feedback.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Sources:**
    *   User purchase history within the platform.
    *   User community affiliations (explicit & implicit - derived from communication patterns, shared interests, etc.).
    *   Real-time sentiment analysis of user communications (messages, forum posts) relating to merchants/products.
    *   External data feeds: social media sentiment, news articles related to merchants (optional, for a broader view).

2.  **Dynamic Reputation Score (DRS):**
    *   DRS is calculated *per user, per merchant*.  A user's overall rating isn’t applied universally.
    *   Components:
        *   Purchase Satisfaction (weight: 40%): Traditional rating/review data.
        *   Community Influence (weight: 30%):  Based on a user's activity within relevant communities.  Higher activity (helpful posts, answered questions) = higher influence.  Measured via a “helpfulness ratio” (upvotes/downvotes on posts, question answers).
        *   Sentiment Coherence (weight: 20%):  Analysis of a user’s *language* when discussing the merchant/product.  Positive language patterns, detailed descriptions, and constructive criticism contribute to a higher score. (NLP required).
        *   Purchase Frequency (weight: 10%): Repeated purchases from the same merchant contribute to the score.

3.  **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm:**
    *   Pricing is not fixed.  It fluctuates based on the collective DRS of users interacting with that merchant.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   `Base Price = Merchant’s Listed Price`
        *   `DRS Average = Average DRS of all users who have interacted with the merchant in the last 30 days`
        *   `Price Modifier = (DRS Average - 50) * 0.05`  (Assumes DRS is scaled 0-100.  A higher DRS Average results in a positive modifier).
        *   `Final Price = Base Price + Price Modifier`
        *   (Adjust multipliers as needed during testing).

4.  **Community Tiers & Benefits:**
    *   Users are assigned to community tiers based on their DRS contributions (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum).
    *   Tier benefits:
        *   Early access to sales.
        *   Exclusive discounts.
        *   Priority customer support.
        *   Influence over merchant offerings (via polls, feature requests).

5.  **Implementation – Pseudocode:**

    ```
    //Calculate User DRS
    function calculateDRS(userID, merchantID) {
        purchaseSatisfaction = getPurchaseSatisfaction(userID, merchantID);
        communityInfluence = getCommunityInfluence(userID, merchantID);
        sentimentCoherence = getSentimentCoherence(userID, merchantID);
        drscore = (0.4 * purchaseSatisfaction) + (0.3 * communityInfluence) + (0.2 * sentimentCoherence);
        return drscore;
    }

    //Calculate Merchant's Average DRS
    function calculateMerchantAverageDRS(merchantID) {
        userList = getUsersWhoInteractedWithMerchant(merchantID);
        totalDRS = 0;
        for (user in userList) {
            totalDRS += calculateDRS(user, merchantID);
        }
        averageDRS = totalDRS / userList.length;
        return averageDRS;
    }

    //Calculate Dynamic Price
    function calculateDynamicPrice(merchantID, basePrice) {
        averageDRS = calculateMerchantAverageDRS(merchantID);
        priceModifier = (averageDRS - 50) * 0.05;
        dynamicPrice = basePrice + priceModifier;
        return dynamicPrice;
    }
    ```

6.  **Data Storage:**
    *   Dedicated database tables for: User DRS, Merchant DRS, User-Merchant Interactions, Community Affiliations.

7.  **API Integrations:**
    *   Sentiment analysis API (e.g., Google Cloud Natural Language API).
    *   Social media APIs (optional).
