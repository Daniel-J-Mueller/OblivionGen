## Dynamic History Buffer Allocation & Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** A system integrating dynamic allocation of history buffer levels with a predictive prefetching mechanism. This aims to optimize decompression speed and reduce latency by anticipating required history data *before* it's requested.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of a fixed two or three-level history buffer, the system dynamically allocates and deallocates buffer levels based on observed decompression patterns.  The predictive prefetching engine learns these patterns to proactively load history data into available buffers.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Decompression Engine:** (Existing, modified to signal history requests and receive pre-fetched data)
*   **History Buffer Manager (HBM):**  Manages allocation/deallocation of history buffer levels.  Communicates with the Decompression Engine and Predictive Prefetching Engine.
*   **Predictive Prefetching Engine (PPE):** Analyzes decompression history to predict future history requests.
*   **Scalable History Buffer Pool:** A pool of memory available to be allocated as history buffer levels.  (SRAM, DRAM, or hybrid).
*   **History Request Queue:** Stores incoming requests for history data from the Decompression Engine.

**Software/Algorithm Components:**

1.  **Dynamic Buffer Level Allocation:**
    *   The HBM monitors the frequency of access to different history levels (current, recent, older).
    *   If a level is rarely accessed, the HBM deallocates it, returning memory to the Scalable History Buffer Pool.
    *   If a level is frequently accessed and nearing capacity, the HBM allocates a new level from the Scalable History Buffer Pool.
    *   Allocation/Deallocation is performed in real-time without interrupting decompression (using double-buffering or similar techniques).

2.  **Predictive Prefetching Algorithm:**
    *   The PPE monitors the history request queue and identifies patterns. For example: “After code word X, code word Y is likely to reference history location Z”.
    *   The PPE maintains a prediction table that maps code words to predicted history locations.
    *   Before the Decompression Engine requests history data, the PPE checks its prediction table.
    *   If a prediction exists, the PPE proactively loads the data into the appropriate buffer level *before* the request arrives.
    *   The PPE learns and refines its predictions based on feedback from the Decompression Engine (e.g., prediction hit/miss rate).  Reinforcement Learning methods could be employed.

**Pseudocode (PPE Prediction Update):**

```
// Initialization
prediction_table = {} // Key: code word, Value: predicted history location
hit_count = 0
miss_count = 0

// During decompression:

function update_prediction(current_code_word, actual_history_location) {
  if (prediction_table.contains(current_code_word)) {
    predicted_location = prediction_table[current_code_word]
    if (predicted_location == actual_history_location) {
      hit_count++
    } else {
      miss_count++
    }
    // Update prediction:  Simple averaging or more complex algorithm
    prediction_table[current_code_word] = (prediction_table[current_code_word] + actual_history_location) / 2
  } else {
    // First time seeing this code word
    prediction_table[current_code_word] = actual_history_location
    hit_count++
  }
}

// In decompression loop:

predicted_location = prediction_table.get(current_code_word) // Check prediction
// Prefetch data from predicted_location to buffer
actual_history_location = get_actual_history_location(current_code_word)
update_prediction(current_code_word, actual_history_location)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Prediction Table:** A hash map or similar data structure to store code word to predicted history location mappings.
*   **History Access Log:** A circular buffer to log history access patterns for analysis and prediction refinement.

**Performance Metrics:**

*   **Prefetch Hit Rate:** Percentage of history requests satisfied by pre-fetched data.
*   **Average History Access Latency:**  Time to retrieve history data.
*   **Buffer Utilization:**  Percentage of allocated history buffers that are being used.
*   **Compression Ratio:** Impact on compression/decompression efficiency.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Contextual Prediction:** Consider the context surrounding the code word when making predictions (e.g., the previous several code words).
*   **Adaptive Learning Rate:** Adjust the learning rate of the prediction algorithm based on the accuracy of predictions.
*   **Multi-Level Prediction:** Use a hierarchy of prediction models to improve accuracy.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Implement the prediction algorithm in hardware for faster performance.
