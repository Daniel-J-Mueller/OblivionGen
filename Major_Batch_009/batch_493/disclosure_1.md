## Dynamic Feature Weighting for Imputation

**Concept:** Extend the linear regression coefficient application beyond simply scaling the residual. Introduce a dynamic weighting system where the coefficient isn't fixed but *learns* based on the imputation's impact on downstream model performance. This goes beyond addressing heterogeneity – it actively optimizes imputation for the specific predictive task.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Baseline Imputation:** Implement the standard method from the patent (partitioning, training, residual calculation, coefficient-based imputation). This forms the initial imputation value.

2.  **Downstream Model Integration:** Define a 'shadow' downstream machine learning model (any model relevant to the data's intended use). This model will be used *solely* for evaluating imputation quality.

3.  **Imputation Perturbation:** Create a series of slightly perturbed imputation values around the baseline.  Perturbation can be additive (baseline + delta) or multiplicative (baseline * (1 + delta)).  Delta should be a small, configurable value.

4.  **Shadow Model Evaluation:** For each perturbed imputation value:
    *   Replace the missing value in the dataset with the perturbed value.
    *   Retrain (or update) the shadow model using the modified dataset.
    *   Evaluate the shadow model on a held-out validation set. Record a performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, depending on the task).

5.  **Weight Calculation:**  Calculate a weight for each perturbed imputation value based on its impact on the shadow model’s performance. The weight could be a direct proportional to the performance metric, or a more complex function that penalizes large deviations from the baseline.

6.  **Weighted Averaging:** Combine the baseline imputation value and the perturbed values using the calculated weights to arrive at the final imputed value.

7.  **Coefficient Update:** Adapt the linear regression coefficient used in the original imputation process. This could be done via:
    *   **Simple Averaging:** Average the weights associated with each imputation value. The resulting average is used to scale the residual.
    *   **Gradient Descent:**  Treat the coefficient as a parameter in an optimization problem. The goal is to minimize the error between the shadow model's predictions and the actual values, using the coefficient as a control variable.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: Dataset with missing values, Shadow Model, Validation Set, Configurable Parameters (Delta, Learning Rate)

For each Feature with Missing Values:

  Baseline_Imputation = Calculate_Imputation(Dataset) //From patent method

  Perturbation_Values = [Baseline_Imputation + Delta, Baseline_Imputation - Delta, Baseline_Imputation * (1 + Delta), Baseline_Imputation * (1 - Delta)]

  For each Perturbation_Value:

    Modified_Dataset = Replace_Missing_Value(Dataset, Perturbation_Value)
    Shadow_Model = Retrain(Shadow_Model, Modified_Dataset)
    Performance_Metric = Evaluate(Shadow_Model, Validation_Set)
    Weight[Perturbation_Value] = Performance_Metric //Or a more sophisticated weighting function

  Final_Imputed_Value = Weighted_Average(Baseline_Imputed_Value, Perturbation_Values, Weights)
  //Calculate and update regression coefficient

  Coefficient = Update_Coefficient(Coefficient, Final_Imputed_Value)

  Replace_Missing_Value(Dataset, Final_Imputed_Value)
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Computational cost: Retraining the shadow model for each perturbation can be expensive. Explore techniques like incremental learning or approximation to reduce cost.
*   Shadow model selection: Choosing an appropriate shadow model is crucial. It should be representative of the downstream task.
*   Parameter tuning: The perturbation size (Delta), learning rate, and weighting function will need to be tuned.
*   Scalability: The approach should be scalable to large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces.
