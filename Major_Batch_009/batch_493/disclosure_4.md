**Interactive Component Lifecycle Visualization**

**Concept:** Extend component-level ratings to incorporate a dynamic visualization of a component’s lifecycle – not just *how* it’s performing *now*, but its historical performance, predicted future performance, and potential failure modes.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User Ratings (as in the base patent)
    *   Sensor Data: Real-time data from the product itself (temperature, vibration, usage frequency, etc.). Requires product instrumentation.
    *   Manufacturing Data: Batch numbers, materials used, quality control reports.
    *   Environmental Data: Usage location temperature, humidity, altitude.
*   **Visualization Layer:** An augmented reality overlay (AR) on the product image, accessible via a mobile device or AR glasses.
*   **Component Highlighting:**  Similar to the region identifiers in the base patent, but with color-coding based on lifecycle stage and health:
    *   Green: Healthy, performing as expected.
    *   Yellow:  Degrading performance, potential maintenance needed.
    *   Red:  Critical failure imminent, requires immediate attention.
    *   Blue: Component under stress due to environmental conditions.
*   **Data Projection:** When a user selects a component:
    *   **Historical Performance Graph:** Display a graph showing the component’s performance over time (e.g., temperature fluctuations, power consumption).
    *   **Predictive Failure Modeling:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict the remaining useful life of the component, displayed as a percentage or time estimate. Indicate confidence intervals.
    *   **Failure Mode Visualization:**  If the model predicts a failure, visualize the likely failure mode (e.g., cracked casing, short circuit) as an AR overlay *on* the component itself.  Animated examples.
    *   **Maintenance Recommendations:**  Provide step-by-step instructions for repairing or replacing the component, with AR guidance.  Link to parts ordering.
*   **User Interaction:**
    *   **Time Slider:** Allow users to ‘rewind’ or ‘fast-forward’ through the component’s lifecycle to see its historical performance.
    *   **Scenario Simulation:** Allow users to simulate different usage scenarios (e.g., increased temperature, higher load) to see how the component would respond.
    *   **Data Input:** Allow users to contribute data (e.g., report a problem, log usage) to improve the accuracy of the model.
*   **Backend System:**
    *   Data Pipeline: Ingest and process data from various sources.
    *   Machine Learning Engine: Train and deploy predictive models.
    *   AR Content Management System: Manage and deliver AR content.

**Pseudocode (AR Overlay Update):**

```
function updateAROverlay(componentID, sensorData, historicalData, predictedData) {
  // Determine component health status based on data
  healthStatus = calculateHealthStatus(sensorData, historicalData, predictedData);

  // Set component color based on health status
  if (healthStatus == "Healthy") {
    color = "Green";
  } else if (healthStatus == "Degrading") {
    color = "Yellow";
  } else if (healthStatus == "Critical") {
    color = "Red";
  } else if (healthStatus == "Stressed") {
    color = "Blue";
  }

  // Update AR overlay with color and data visualization
  arOverlay.setColor(componentID, color);
  arOverlay.displayHistoricalData(componentID, historicalData);
  arOverlay.displayPredictedData(componentID, predictedData);

  //If failure mode is predicted, display animated visualization
  if (predictedData.failureMode != null){
      arOverlay.displayFailureModeVisualization(componentID, predictedData.failureMode);
  }
}
