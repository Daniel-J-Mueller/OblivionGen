## Adaptive Wavelength Allocation for Multi-Rack Datacenters

**Concept:** Extend the optical switching capability to dynamically allocate wavelengths to racks based on real-time traffic demands, rather than simply switching between pre-defined rack connections. This creates a more granular and efficient use of fiber infrastructure.

**Specs:**

*   **Transceiver Component:** Optical transceiver incorporating a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) capable optical switch. The switch must support at least 16 independently switchable wavelengths.
*   **Wavelength Pool:** Each transceiver has access to a pre-defined pool of wavelengths (e.g., 1550-1565nm with 100GHz spacing). This pool is shared across all connected racks.
*   **Control Plane:** A centralized software controller (SDN-like) monitors rack-level traffic demands. This controller utilizes telemetry data (bandwidth utilization, latency, error rates) from each rack.
*   **Allocation Algorithm:** The controller implements a dynamic wavelength allocation algorithm.
    *   **Demand Prediction:** Uses historical data and real-time metrics to predict future bandwidth demands for each rack.
    *   **Wavelength Assignment:** Assigns wavelengths to racks based on predicted demand, prioritizing racks with high bandwidth requirements.  A "least loaded wavelength" heuristic is used to balance the load across the wavelength pool.
    *   **Fragmentation Mitigation:** Implements a wavelength packing algorithm to minimize fragmentation within the wavelength pool. This may involve temporarily re-allocating wavelengths from racks with lower demand to consolidate available bandwidth.
*   **Transceiver Interface:** The optical transceiver supports a standardized control interface (e.g., Open ROADM compatible) allowing the centralized controller to configure wavelength assignments.
*   **Optical Line System (OLS) Integration:** The OLS infrastructure must be wavelength aware and capable of routing wavelengths to the correct destination racks.  Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers (OADMs) will be utilized for wavelength selective routing.
*   **Failover Mechanism:** In case of transceiver or wavelength failure, the controller automatically re-allocates wavelengths to alternate transceivers or racks.
*   **Pseudocode for Dynamic Allocation:**

```pseudocode
// RackTrafficData structure: {rackID, bandwidthUtilization, predictedDemand}
// WavelengthPool: Array of available wavelengths

function allocateWavelengths(RackTrafficData[] rackData, WavelengthPool wavelengths) {
  // Sort racks by predictedDemand (descending)
  sortedRacks = sort(rackData, predictedDemand)

  for each rack in sortedRacks {
    requiredBandwidth = rack.predictedDemand

    // Find the lowest-index wavelength capable of supporting the bandwidth
    availableWavelength = findAvailableWavelength(wavelengths, requiredBandwidth)

    if (availableWavelength != null) {
      // Assign the wavelength to the rack
      assignWavelength(rack, availableWavelength)

      // Remove the wavelength from the pool
      removeWavelength(wavelengths, availableWavelength)
    } else {
      // Handle the case where no wavelengths are available
      // (e.g., trigger a re-allocation or raise an alert)
      log("No available wavelengths for rack " + rack.rackID)
    }
  }
}

function reallocateWavelengths() {
  // Identify racks with underutilized wavelengths
  underutilizedRacks = findUnderutilizedRacks()

  // Identify racks with unmet bandwidth demands
  demandingRacks = findDemandingRacks()

  // Re-allocate wavelengths from underutilized racks to demanding racks
  for each rack in underutilizedRacks {
    for each rack in demandingRacks {
      // Transfer a wavelength if possible
      transferWavelength(rack, demandingRack)
      break // Move to next underutilized rack
    }
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:** Increased bandwidth utilization, reduced fiber infrastructure costs, improved network scalability, dynamic response to changing traffic patterns.
