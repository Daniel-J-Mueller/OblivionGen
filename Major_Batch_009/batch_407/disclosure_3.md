**Dynamic Data Provenance with Attestation Chains**

**Concept:** Extend the stable pseudonymous identifier (SPI) system to incorporate a verifiable audit trail of data transformations and access events, leveraging hardware attestation and zero-knowledge proofs. This goes beyond simply masking the original data; it establishes *confidence* in the integrity of the data lineage.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Attestation Module:** Integrate a hardware-backed attestation module (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) into the system. Each data transformation or access event triggers an attestation report signed by the hardware. This report includes metadata like timestamp, user ID (pseudonymized), operation performed, and a hash of the input data.

2.  **Merkle Tree of Attestations:** Construct a Merkle tree where each leaf node represents an attestation report. This creates a concise, verifiable summary of the entire data lineage. The root hash of the Merkle tree serves as a global, tamper-proof fingerprint of the data’s history.

3.  **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Implement ZKPs to allow selective disclosure of data lineage information *without* revealing the underlying data. For example, a user could prove that a specific transformation was applied to the data without revealing the input or output values.

4.  **SPI Integration:** The SPI remains the primary identifier. However, the Merkle root hash is linked to the SPI in the mapping table. This allows verifying the integrity of the data associated with the SPI.

5.  **Data Transformation Pipeline:** Modify the data transformation pipeline to automatically generate attestation reports and update the Merkle tree after each step.

**Pseudocode (Data Transformation Process):**

```
function transformData(data, key):
  attestationReport = generateAttestationReport(data, key)
  transformedData = applyTransformation(data, key)
  updateMerkleTree(attestationReport)
  return transformedData

function generateAttestationReport(data, key):
  // Generate report with timestamp, user ID, operation, hash(data)
  report = {
    timestamp: getCurrentTimestamp(),
    userId: getPseudonymizedUserId(),
    operation: "transformation",
    dataHash: hash(data)
  }
  // Sign the report with the hardware attestation module
  signedReport = sign(report)
  return signedReport

function updateMerkleTree(signedReport):
  // Add the signed report as a leaf node in the Merkle tree
  addLeaf(signedReport)
  // Recompute the Merkle root
  recomputeRoot()
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Attestation Report:** {timestamp, userId, operation, dataHash, signature}
*   **Merkle Tree:** A tree-like data structure where each leaf node represents an attestation report, and each internal node represents the hash of its children.
*   **Mapping Table:** {hashOutput: randomValue, merkleRoot: rootHash} – The mapping table now also stores the Merkle root hash associated with the SPI.

**Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Data Integrity:** Hardware attestation ensures the trustworthiness of data transformations.
*   **Verifiable Audit Trail:** The Merkle tree provides a tamper-proof record of all data lineage events.
*   **Selective Disclosure:** ZKPs enable privacy-preserving verification of data lineage.
*   **Improved Compliance:** Facilitates compliance with data privacy regulations.
