## Dynamic Service Bundle Composition & Predictive Feature Adjustment

**Concept:** Leverage real-time usage data and predictive analytics to dynamically adjust a wireless service plan's feature set *after* initial purchase, optimizing for both customer satisfaction and carrier profitability. This moves beyond simple plan upgrades/downgrades to granular, automated feature adjustments.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** Real-time collection of detailed usage data. This includes, but isnâ€™t limited to:
    *   Data volume (GB) used per hour/day.
    *   Application usage (categorized - streaming, social media, gaming, work apps).
    *   Location data (for usage pattern analysis - home, work, travel).
    *   Call/SMS frequency and duration.
    *   Device type and capabilities.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:** A machine learning model trained to predict future usage patterns based on historical data and current trends. The model will predict:
    *   Likelihood of exceeding data limits.
    *   Frequency of international calls/texts.
    *   Demand for specific streaming services.
    *   Potential need for hotspot data.
*   **Feature Adjustment Logic:** Rules-based system that triggers automatic feature adjustments based on predictive model output and pre-defined carrier/customer preferences.
    *   **Data Boost:** Automatically add a temporary data boost if the model predicts imminent data overage.
    *   **Hotspot Enablement:** Enable/disable hotspot access based on predicted travel patterns (e.g., enable when near airports or during peak travel times).
    *   **Streaming Optimization:** Dynamically adjust streaming quality/resolution based on network conditions and predicted usage.
    *   **International Rate Adjustment:** Automatically apply temporary international rate discounts based on predicted travel.
    *   **Feature Trial Activation:**  Introduce short-term trials of premium features (e.g., enhanced security, priority support) based on predicted interest.
*   **User Interface (UI) Integration:**  A dedicated section within the customer's account management portal to:
    *   Display predicted usage trends.
    *   Explain automatic feature adjustments.
    *   Allow customers to override automated adjustments (with warnings about potential costs/impacts).
    *   Provide personalized recommendations for optimizing service plans.
*   **API Integration:** An open API that allows third-party developers to integrate with the dynamic service adjustment system. This could enable:
    *   Location-based services that automatically adjust features based on user location (e.g., automatic hotspot enablement when arriving at a coffee shop).
    *   Application-specific optimization (e.g., automatic video quality adjustment within a streaming app).

**Pseudocode (Feature Adjustment Loop):**

```
loop:
    usageData = collectUsageData()
    prediction = predictFutureUsage(usageData)

    if prediction.dataExceedanceLikelihood > threshold:
        applyDataBoost(customer, amount)
        sendNotification(customer, "Data boost applied to avoid overage charges.")

    if prediction.internationalCallLikelihood > threshold:
        applyInternationalDiscount(customer, rate)
        sendNotification(customer, "International call discount applied.")

    if prediction.hotspotDemand > threshold and customer.hotspotEnabled == false:
        enableHotspot(customer)
        sendNotification(customer, "Hotspot enabled for travel.")

    // Repeat every hour or as needed
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Gamification:** Reward customers for actively optimizing their service plans based on usage data.
*   **Personalized Pricing:** Offer dynamic pricing based on predicted usage and customer value.
*   **Proactive Support:** Identify customers who are likely to experience service issues and offer proactive support.
