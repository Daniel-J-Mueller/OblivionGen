# D872728

## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Fob

**Concept:** A fob device incorporating localized haptic feedback that *adapts* to user grip and pressure, providing subtle, contextual cues beyond simple confirmation.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Similar overall size/shape to D872728, but with a slightly larger surface area on at least one face to accommodate haptic array.
*   **Haptic Array:** A dense array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar) embedded within the fob’s surface. Minimum 32x32 resolution.
*   **Grip Sensors:** Capacitive or resistive grip sensors integrated into the fob’s casing, detecting both presence and pressure distribution of the user's hand.
*   **Internal Processing:** A low-power microcontroller with sufficient processing capability to:
    *   Read grip sensor data.
    *   Calculate pressure map of user’s grip.
    *   Translate grip data into haptic patterns.
    *   Control individual actuators in the haptic array.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for connection to a host device (smartphone, smart lock, etc.).
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-polymer battery. Wireless charging capability preferred.
*   **Materials:** Durable plastic or metal casing. Soft-touch coating on haptic array surface.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Grip Detection:** Upon grasping the fob, grip sensors activate.
2.  **Pressure Mapping:**  Microcontroller analyzes pressure distribution across the grip area.
3.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:**
    *   **Contextual Feedback:**  BLE communication receives information from the host device (e.g., proximity to a locked door, incoming call, low battery).
    *   **Adaptive Patterns:**  Microcontroller selects or generates a unique haptic pattern based on both the context *and* the user’s grip.  
        *   For example: a "door unlock" signal could be a gentle pulsing on the palm-side of the fob if the user has a firm grip, but a localized vibration on the thumb-side for a lighter grip.
        *   A low battery warning might be a slow, rhythmic pulsation across the entire haptic array, increasing in intensity as the battery drains.
        *   An incoming call could be a wave-like pattern moving across the surface.
4.  **Haptic Actuation:** Microcontroller energizes individual actuators in the haptic array to produce the desired pattern.
5.  **Learning Mode (Optional):**  Fob could learn user preferences for haptic feedback over time, customizing patterns based on individual grip styles and responsiveness.

**Pseudocode (Pattern Generation):**

```
FUNCTION generateHapticPattern(context, gripData)
  // context: String (e.g., "door_unlock", "incoming_call", "low_battery")
  // gripData: Array of pressure values (representing grip distribution)

  SWITCH context
    CASE "door_unlock"
      IF gripData.averagePressure > thresholdHigh
        pattern = pulse(palmArea, frequency=slow, intensity=medium)
      ELSE
        pattern = vibrate(thumbArea, frequency=fast, intensity=low)

    CASE "incoming_call"
      pattern = wave(entireSurface, frequency=medium, intensity=medium)

    CASE "low_battery"
      intensity = map(batteryLevel, 100, 0, 10, 100) // Map battery level to intensity
      pattern = pulse(entireSurface, frequency=slow, intensity=intensity)

    DEFAULT
      pattern = noHaptics()

  RETURN pattern
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Gesture Recognition:** Integrate accelerometer and gyroscope to detect fob movements and translate them into commands.
*   **Biometric Authentication:**  Integrate fingerprint or vein pattern scanner into the fob for enhanced security.
*   **Material Feedback:** Incorporate materials with varying textures or temperature to provide additional sensory cues.
