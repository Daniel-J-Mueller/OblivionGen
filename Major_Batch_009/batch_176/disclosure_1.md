## Adaptive Routing Based on Real-Time Network ‘Health’ Metrics & Predictive Modeling

**System Overview:**

This system extends the described patent by introducing a dynamic, predictive routing layer that leverages real-time network health metrics *beyond* simple BGP data and incorporates machine learning to anticipate congestion and failures *before* they impact traffic. This goes beyond merely selecting best paths; it proactively *shapes* traffic flow to optimize overall network performance and resilience.

**Components:**

1.  **Network Health Sensor Network (NHSN):** Deployed throughout the network (border routers, core switches, even potentially strategically placed end-host agents) gathering granular data:
    *   Latency (per-packet, averages, jitter)
    *   Packet Loss Rate
    *   Queue Depth at network devices
    *   CPU/Memory utilization of network devices
    *   Interface error rates
    *   Link utilization (bandwidth consumption)
    *   Application-level metrics (e.g., RTT for specific services)

2.  **Centralized Analytics Engine (CAE):**  Collects data from the NHSN.  The CAE utilizes a tiered approach:
    *   **Real-time Monitoring:** Immediate detection of anomalies and performance degradation.
    *   **Historical Data Storage:** Database for long-term trend analysis.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series forecasting, neural networks) to predict future congestion, link failures, and potential bottlenecks.  These models are continuously refined based on incoming data.

3.  **Adaptive Routing Controller (ARC):** This component integrates with the existing routing service described in the patent.  The ARC receives predictions from the CAE and adjusts routing policies dynamically.

4.  **Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs):**  Implemented on border routers and core switches.  PEPs receive routing instructions from the ARC and enforce them.  This may involve manipulating BGP attributes, adjusting QoS settings, or even temporarily rerouting traffic around predicted problem areas.

**Pseudocode – ARC Logic:**

```pseudocode
// Input: Predicted Network Health data (from CAE)
//       Current Routing Table (from Routing Service)
//       Network Topology Map

function adjustRouting(predictedHealth, routingTable, topologyMap) {

  // 1. Identify Potential Problem Areas based on predictedHealth
  problemAreas = findProblemAreas(predictedHealth, topologyMap)

  // 2. Calculate Alternative Paths for traffic impacted by problemAreas
  alternativePaths = calculateAlternativePaths(problemAreas, routingTable, topologyMap)

  // 3. Evaluate Alternative Paths based on multiple criteria:
  //    - Predicted Latency
  //    - Predicted Congestion
  //    - Cost (e.g., transit provider fees)
  //    - Reliability (based on historical data)
  scoredPaths = scorePaths(alternativePaths)

  // 4. Select Best Paths based on scoring
  bestPaths = selectBestPaths(scoredPaths)

  // 5. Generate Routing Policy Updates (BGP attribute modifications, etc.)
  policyUpdates = generatePolicyUpdates(bestPaths)

  // 6. Distribute Policy Updates to PEPs
  distributePolicyUpdates(policyUpdates)

  return policyUpdates
}

function findProblemAreas(predictedHealth, topologyMap) {
  // Identify links/nodes predicted to experience congestion/failure
  // Based on thresholds and trend analysis
  // Return a list of affected areas
}

function calculateAlternativePaths(problemAreas, routingTable, topologyMap) {
    // Use a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's, A*) to calculate alternative paths
    // Avoiding the problem areas
    // Return a list of alternative paths for each impacted flow
}

function scorePaths(alternativePaths) {
    // Assign a score to each path based on latency, congestion, cost, reliability
    // Use a weighted scoring function to prioritize factors
}

function selectBestPaths(scoredPaths) {
    // Select the paths with the highest scores
}
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Routing:** Moves beyond reactive routing based on current conditions to *anticipate* and prevent network problems.
*   **Granular Health Monitoring:**  Provides a much more detailed and accurate picture of network health than traditional BGP data alone.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:**  Enables the system to learn from past events and predict future problems with increasing accuracy.
*   **Dynamic Policy Enforcement:** Allows for rapid adaptation to changing network conditions.
*   **Application-Aware Routing:** The system could be extended to prioritize traffic based on application requirements (e.g., low latency for real-time gaming, high bandwidth for video streaming).
