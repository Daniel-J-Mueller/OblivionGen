## Dynamic Emotional State-Driven Skill Adaptation

**Concept:** Extend the system's ability to adapt not just based on feedback *requests*, but proactively based on a continuously assessed user emotional state, and dynamically adjust skill component weighting/selection accordingly. This moves beyond prompting for feedback to a system that *anticipates* user needs and adapts its behavior *before* issues arise.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional State Assessment Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio data (user input), Text data (user input), System usage data (interaction history, time of day, etc.)
*   **Processing:**
    *   Employ a multi-modal emotion recognition model (trained on audio and text) to determine a continuous emotional state vector. This vector includes dimensions for valence (positive/negative), arousal (calm/excited), dominance (in control/submissive), and potentially more granular emotions (frustration, confusion, joy, etc.).
    *   Temporal smoothing: Apply a moving average filter to the emotional state vector to reduce noise and create a more stable representation of the user's emotional trajectory.
    *   Baseline Calibration:  Establish a user-specific baseline emotional state based on initial interactions.  Deviations from this baseline are more significant than absolute emotional values.
*   **Output:**  Emotional State Vector (continuous representation of user's emotional state).

**2. Skill Weighting/Selection Engine:**

*   **Input:** Emotional State Vector, System Usage Data, Skill Component Metadata (see below).
*   **Skill Component Metadata:** Each skill component is tagged with:
    *   *Emotional Sensitivity Profile:*  A vector representing the emotional states in which this skill component performs optimally (e.g., a "Help" skill might perform best when the user is frustrated).
    *   *Emotional Tolerance Range:*  A range of emotional states within which the skill component can function acceptably.
    *   *Skill Priority Weight:* A base weight indicating the component's importance.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Emotional Alignment Score:** Calculate an alignment score between the current Emotional State Vector and each skill component's Emotional Sensitivity Profile. This could be a cosine similarity or other appropriate metric.
    *   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Adjust the weight of each skill component based on its Emotional Alignment Score. Higher alignment = higher weight.  Apply a sigmoid function to constrain the weight adjustment.
    *   **Skill Activation Threshold:**  Each skill component has a minimum weight threshold to be activated. This prevents irrelevant skills from interfering.
    *   **Skill Cascade:** If multiple skills meet the activation threshold, prioritize based on a combination of their adjusted weight and a pre-defined hierarchy (e.g., critical functions > convenience features).
*   **Output:**  Weighted Skill Component List (ordered list of skills with adjusted weights).

**3.  Adaptive Dialogue Management:**

*   **Input:** Weighted Skill Component List, User Input.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Route the user input to the highest-weighted activated skill component.
    *   Modify the dialogue style and complexity of the selected skill component based on the user's emotional state. For example:
        *   High frustration: Simplify language, provide clear and concise instructions, offer proactive help.
        *   High excitement: Use more enthusiastic language, offer suggestions for exploration.
        *   Low arousal:  Use a calmer, more soothing tone.
*   **Output:** System Response.



**Pseudocode (Skill Weighting Engine):**

```
function adjust_skill_weights(emotional_state, skill_metadata):
  weighted_skills = []
  for skill in skill_metadata:
    alignment_score = cosine_similarity(emotional_state, skill.emotional_sensitivity_profile)
    weight = skill.priority_weight * (1 + alignment_score)  // Boost weight based on alignment
    if weight >= skill.activation_threshold:
      weighted_skills.append((skill, weight))

  // Sort skills by weight in descending order
  weighted_skills.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  return weighted_skills
```

**Novelty:**  This system doesn't *react* to feedback; it *anticipates* user needs by continuously monitoring emotional state and dynamically adjusting skill component weighting *before* the user explicitly expresses dissatisfaction. It's a shift from reactive to proactive adaptation.
