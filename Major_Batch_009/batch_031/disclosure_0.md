## Dynamic Sentiment-Driven Review Stitching

**Concept:** Extend the excerpting functionality to *stitch together* multiple short excerpts from different reviews, dynamically assembling a more comprehensive and nuanced overview of the item based on evolving sentiment analysis. Instead of a single excerpt, present a ‘review mosaic’.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sentiment Polarity Index (SPI):** Each review is processed to establish an SPI score for *each sentence*. This score indicates the sentence's sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and its intensity. Implement a multi-layered sentiment engine, combining lexicon-based analysis with transformer-based models for contextual understanding.
2.  **Category-Sentiment Matrix:** Maintain a matrix mapping each identified category (from the patent) to a distribution of sentiment scores. For example, “Battery Life” might have 70% positive, 20% neutral, 10% negative sentiment across all reviews.
3.  **User Preference Profile:** Establish a user preference profile indicating desired sentiment balance. A user might prefer a "balanced" view (equal positive/negative), a "positive focus" (70% positive), or a "critical analysis" (70% negative).
4.  **Dynamic Excerpt Selection:**  
    *   For a given item and user profile, select sentences from reviews based on:
        *   Category relevance (matching user-specified or automatically determined interests).
        *   Sentiment alignment with the user’s preference profile.
        *   Sentence diversity (avoiding redundancy).
    *   Implement a scoring function that prioritizes sentences with high relevance, aligned sentiment, and low similarity to previously selected sentences.
5.  **Mosaic Assembly:** Arrange selected sentences into a coherent “mosaic”.  
    *   Employ a simple chronological or topic-based ordering.
    *   Implement transitions between sentences to improve readability (e.g., “In contrast,” “Similarly,” “Additionally”).
6.  **Real-time Adjustment:** Allow users to adjust sentiment filters (e.g., “Show more critical reviews”) and observe the mosaic dynamically update. 
7. **Highlighting and Annotation:** Highlight keywords or phrases within the mosaic that contribute to the overall sentiment.  Allow users to annotate excerpts or provide feedback on sentiment accuracy.
8. **API Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /mosaic?item_id={item_id}&user_profile={user_profile}`: Returns a pre-assembled mosaic for a given item and user profile.
    *   `POST /mosaic/filter?item_id={item_id}&sentiment_filter={filter}`: Updates the sentiment filter and returns an updated mosaic.

**Pseudocode (Excerpt Selection):**

```
function select_excerpts(item_id, user_profile, num_sentences):
  reviews = get_reviews(item_id)
  sentences = extract_sentences(reviews)
  scored_sentences = []

  for sentence in sentences:
    category = identify_category(sentence)
    sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment(sentence)
    relevance_score = calculate_relevance(category, user_profile)
    sentiment_alignment = calculate_alignment(sentiment_score, user_profile)
    diversity_score = calculate_diversity(sentence, scored_sentences)
    total_score = relevance_score + sentiment_alignment + diversity_score
    scored_sentences.append((sentence, total_score))

  sorted_sentences = sort_sentences_by_score(scored_sentences)
  selected_sentences = take_top_n_sentences(sorted_sentences, num_sentences)
  return selected_sentences
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simply extracting a single excerpt. It creates a dynamic, personalized review experience that allows users to gain a more nuanced understanding of an item based on their preferences. It allows for a more critical engagement with the review landscape, rather than a reliance on potentially biased or misleading summaries.
