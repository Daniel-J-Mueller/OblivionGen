## Secure Execution Environment Orchestration via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Concept:** Expand the secure execution environment (SEE) paradigm by integrating it with a decentralized identity (DID) system. This enables dynamic, permissioned access and orchestration of SEEs across multiple hardware platforms and trust domains, moving beyond a static, provider-controlled model.

**Specs:**

**1. DID-Based SEE Provisioning:**

*   **Component:** `DIDProvisioner` - Responsible for binding a DID to a specific SEE instance.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Receives a DID request from a service provider or end-user.
    *   Authenticates the requesting entity (e.g., via verifiable credentials).
    *   Provisions a new SEE instance (or selects an existing one based on available resources and capabilities).
    *   Registers the DID-to-SEE mapping in a decentralized registry (e.g., a blockchain or distributed hash table).
    *   Generates a cryptographic key pair specific to the DID-SEE binding. The private key remains securely within the SEE.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `DID-SEE Mapping`: { DID: String, SEE_ID: String, Key: String, Capabilities: List<String> }

**2.  Policy Enforcement with Verifiable Credentials:**

*   **Component:** `PolicyEnforcer` – Runs *within* the SEE.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Receives a request to execute a task.
    *   Requires a verifiable credential (VC) presented by the requesting entity (e.g., a service client).
    *   Validates the VC against pre-defined policies (e.g., "only authorized users can access this data").
    *   The policies themselves are dynamically updated and stored *within* the SEE, secured by the SEE’s isolation.
    *   If validation succeeds, the task is executed. Otherwise, access is denied.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function executeTask(request, credential):
        policy = getPolicyForTask(request.taskId)
        isValid = verifyCredential(credential, policy)
        if isValid:
            executeTaskInternal(request)
            return success
        else:
            return accessDenied
    ```

**3. Cross-SEE Communication & Federation:**

*   **Component:** `SEEFederator` – Acts as a bridge between SEEs.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Enables secure, authenticated communication between different SEEs.
    *   Uses DID-based authentication to verify the identity of the originating SEE.
    *   Facilitates data exchange and task delegation between SEEs.
    *   Supports a trust model where SEEs can vouch for each other's reputation.
*   **Process Flow:**
    1.  SEE A wants to delegate a task to SEE B.
    2.  SEE A constructs a request message signed with its DID-bound key.
    3.  The request is sent to the `SEEFederator`.
    4.  The `SEEFederator` verifies the signature and authenticates SEE A.
    5.  The request is forwarded to SEE B.
    6.  SEE B verifies the signature and authenticates SEE A before executing the task.

**4. Hardware Agnostic Provisioning:**

*   **Component:** `HardwareProvisioner`
*   **Functionality:**
    *   When provisioning a new SEE, the `HardwareProvisioner` interrogates the underlying hardware capabilities (CPU features, memory size, available extensions, etc.).
    *   This information is used to select the optimal SEE configuration and runtime environment.
    *   The system can dynamically adapt to different hardware platforms without requiring code changes.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `HardwareProfile`: { CPU: String, Memory: Integer, Extensions: List<String> }

**Innovation:** This moves the SEE from a static, centrally managed resource to a dynamic, federated ecosystem. The integration of DIDs enables decentralized access control, improved security, and enhanced interoperability between different SEEs. It allows for a "trust-on-first-use" model, where trust is established through cryptographic verification rather than pre-configured permissions.
