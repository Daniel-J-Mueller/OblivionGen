## Dynamic Container Image Composition via Policy

**Specification:** A system for composing container images *during* deployment, driven by runtime policy rather than static image layers.

**Core Concept:** Instead of pre-building and storing monolithic images, the system dynamically assembles container images from a catalog of immutable component "primitives" (executable files, configuration snippets, libraries) at the point of deployment.  This allows for tailoring images to specific environments, security requirements, or application needs *without* rebuilding or re-tagging images.

**Components:**

*   **Primitive Catalog:** A repository of validated, immutable components. Each primitive has metadata: OS compatibility, dependencies, security scan results, resource usage, and a unique identifier.
*   **Policy Engine:** Receives deployment requests and evaluates policies defined by operators or automated systems. Policies specify which primitives should be included in the container image based on environment, user roles, security constraints, or other criteria.
*   **Composition Service:**  Assembles the container image from the primitives selected by the Policy Engine.  This involves creating a base filesystem, copying the selected primitives, and configuring the necessary entrypoint and runtime environment. Uses a layered filesystem (like Docker's) to optimize storage and deployment.
*   **Caching Layer:** Caches frequently used combinations of primitives to reduce composition time.

**Workflow:**

1.  Deployment request received with associated metadata (environment, user, application version, etc.).
2.  Policy Engine evaluates policies based on the metadata.
3.  Policy Engine selects a set of primitives from the Primitive Catalog based on the policy evaluation.
4.  Composition Service assembles the container image using the selected primitives.
5.  The composed image is deployed to the target environment.
6.  Composed image metadata is stored for audit and reproducibility.

**Pseudocode (Composition Service):**

```
function composeImage(primitiveList, baseImage):
  filesystem = createFilesystem(baseImage)
  for primitive in primitiveList:
    copyPrimitiveToFilesystem(primitive, filesystem)
    resolveDependencies(primitive, filesystem) // Handle library/runtime dependencies
  configureEntrypoint(filesystem)
  createImageLayer(filesystem)
  return layeredImage
```

**Innovation:**

This shifts the focus from *image creation* to *image definition*. Images become declarative specifications of desired functionality rather than static binaries.

**Possible Extensions:**

*   **Automated Policy Generation:** Use AI/ML to automatically generate policies based on application requirements and security best practices.
*   **Just-in-Time Security Updates:**  Dynamically apply security patches to primitives during image composition.
*   **A/B Testing & Canary Deployments:** Easily create variations of images with different configurations for testing and deployment.
*   **Federated Primitive Catalogs:** Allow organizations to share and reuse primitives across different environments.
