## Dynamic Reference Vector Generation via Adversarial Perturbation

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on comparing feature vectors against a static reference vector derived from “problematic” images. This system proposes a dynamic reference vector *generated* through controlled adversarial perturbation of a base reference vector, adapting to variations in input image quality and potential classifier weaknesses in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Base Reference Vector Store.** A database storing initial reference feature vectors for common false positive triggers (e.g., sunglasses, masks, specific textures). These are pre-computed.
*   **Module 2: Perturbation Engine.** This engine utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
    *   **Generator:** Takes a base reference vector and generates perturbed versions. Perturbations are designed to *maximize* the potential for misclassification by the primary object classifier. The GAN is trained on the primary classifier’s error gradients.
    *   **Discriminator:** Attempts to distinguish between perturbed reference vectors and "natural" feature vectors extracted from a continuously updated dataset of challenging images.
*   **Module 3: Quality Assessment Module (QAM).**  This module functions *before* and *during* the classification pipeline.
    *   **Input:** Incoming image feature vector.
    *   **Process:** Calculates similarity scores against *multiple* dynamically generated reference vectors from the Perturbation Engine.  The number of reference vectors compared against is configurable.
    *   **Output:**  A "perturbation score" representing the image’s similarity to the most problematic dynamically generated vectors.
*   **Module 4: Adaptive Filtering.**  The output of the QAM (perturbation score) is used to dynamically adjust filter criteria for the primary object classifier. 
    *   Higher perturbation scores indicate a higher likelihood of a false positive.  The filter criteria are tightened to require a stronger confidence score from the primary classifier.
    *   Lower perturbation scores allow for more lenient filter criteria.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Filtering):**

```
// Define base filter threshold
float baseThreshold = 0.8;

// Get perturbation score from QAM
float perturbationScore = QAM.getPerturbationScore();

// Calculate adjusted threshold
float adjustedThreshold = baseThreshold - (perturbationScore * sensitivityFactor);  // sensitivityFactor is a tunable parameter

// If adjustedThreshold falls below minimum, clamp to minimum value
if (adjustedThreshold < minThreshold) {
    adjustedThreshold = minThreshold;
}

// Apply adjusted threshold to classifier confidence score
if (classifierConfidenceScore >= adjustedThreshold) {
    // Accept classification
} else {
    // Reject classification (potential false positive)
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Image is received.
2.  Feature vector is extracted.
3.  Perturbation Engine generates multiple dynamic reference vectors.
4.  QAM calculates similarity scores between input feature vector and dynamic reference vectors.
5.  QAM generates a perturbation score.
6.  Adaptive Filtering adjusts classifier criteria based on the perturbation score.
7.  Image is classified using adjusted criteria.

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond a static reference vector by *actively* generating challenging scenarios to better assess image quality and refine classifier behavior. The adversarial aspect pushes the system to anticipate and mitigate potential false positives more effectively.
