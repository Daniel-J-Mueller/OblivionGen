## Dynamic Data Shadowing with Predictive Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Extend the data injection/pattern matching system to not only *detect* data flows, but proactively *shadow* them, creating a predictive model of ‘normal’ behavior and flagging deviations *before* they become critical. This shifts the focus from reactive monitoring to proactive prediction.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Data Capture Module:**
    *   Intercepts injected data values at the service entry/exit points (as per the base patent).
    *   Duplicates the data (shadow data) and stores it in a separate, dedicated time-series database. This database is optimized for rapid read/write of sequential data.
    *   Each data record is timestamped and includes metadata: service involved, data type, originating/destination service, and a unique transaction ID.
2.  **Behavioral Modeling Engine:**
    *   Utilizes the shadow data to build a statistical model of normal data flow patterns.
    *   Employs time-series analysis techniques (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to predict future data values based on historical trends.
    *   Models data distributions for each data type, identifying typical ranges, variances, and correlations between different data elements.
    *   Learns seasonality and cyclical patterns in data flows.
3.  **Anomaly Prediction Module:**
    *   Continuously compares real-time data flows with the predicted values generated by the Behavioral Modeling Engine.
    *   Calculates an anomaly score based on the deviation between observed and predicted data. Several methods can be employed:
        *   **Residual Analysis:**  Examine the difference between actual and predicted values.
        *   **Control Limits:**  Define acceptable ranges for deviation.
        *   **Machine Learning:** Train a model (e.g., autoencoder, one-class SVM) to identify anomalous data points.
    *   Triggers alerts when the anomaly score exceeds a predefined threshold. 
4.  **Adaptive Learning & Feedback Loop:**
    *   The system continuously learns from new data.
    *   The Behavioral Modeling Engine retrains its models periodically or in response to significant changes in data patterns.
    *   A feedback mechanism allows security analysts to validate or reject alerts, refining the accuracy of the prediction models.
5.  **Correlation Engine:**
    *   Integrates with the existing pattern matching system.
    *   Identifies correlations between predicted anomalies and known attack signatures or vulnerabilities.
    *   Provides context for alerts, helping security analysts prioritize investigations.
6.  **Visualization & Reporting:**
    *   Provides a dashboard for monitoring system health and anomaly trends.
    *   Visualizes data flows and anomalies on a network graph.
    *   Generates reports on anomaly detection rates, false positive rates, and security incident summaries.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Loop):**

```
// For each incoming data value:
dataValue = receiveData()
metadata = receiveMetadata()

// Fetch predicted value from Behavioral Modeling Engine
predictedValue = getPredictedValue(metadata.dataType, metadata.service)

// Calculate anomaly score
anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(dataValue, predictedValue)

// If anomaly score exceeds threshold:
if (anomalyScore > threshold) {
    // Generate alert
    generateAlert(metadata, anomalyScore)

    // Log data for feedback loop
    logData(dataValue, predictedValue, anomalyScore)
}
```

**Novelty:** 

This builds on the original patent by introducing *predictive* capabilities. The original focuses on *detecting* anomalies based on known patterns. This system anticipates anomalies before they occur, reducing response time and improving security posture. It’s a shift from reactive security to proactive security. The continual adaptation and feedback loop is also key.
