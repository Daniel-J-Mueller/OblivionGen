## Dynamic Pose-Aware Environmental Reconstruction

**Concept:** Augment pose estimation with real-time environmental reconstruction, creating a dynamic, interactive 3D space reflecting user activity and enabling advanced mixed reality experiences. This differs from static environmental mapping by focusing on *changes* within the environment *caused by* the user's pose and actions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Depth Sensor Array:** Multiple time-of-flight or structured light sensors strategically placed to capture a broad field of view and minimize occlusion. (Minimum 4 sensors, configurable arrangement)
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** High-precision IMU integrated with the primary computing device to track movement and orientation, supplementing depth sensor data.
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** Dedicated processing unit (GPU + NPU) for real-time data processing and environmental reconstruction.
*   **AR/VR Display:** Head-mounted display or projection system for visualizing the reconstructed environment and overlaid digital content.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Pose Estimation Engine:** Utilizes the existing pose extraction algorithms (from the provided patent) but now incorporates IMU data for improved accuracy and robustness. Outputs skeletal tracking data.
*   **Dynamic Mesh Generator:** This is the core innovation. It accepts skeletal tracking data and depth sensor input to construct a dynamic 3D mesh of the environment.
    *   **Key Functionality:**
        *   **Occupancy Mapping:** Creates a voxel grid representing the environment's occupancy.
        *   **Surface Reconstruction:** Reconstructs surfaces from the occupied voxels using algorithms like marching cubes.
        *   **Pose-Driven Deformation:** Deforms the mesh based on the user's pose.  For example, if the user reaches for an object, the mesh around their hand dynamically adjusts to accommodate the movement.
        *   **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions between the user's virtual limbs and the reconstructed environment.
        *   **Semantic Segmentation:** Classifies environment components (floor, walls, furniture, objects).
*   **Interaction Engine:** Enables users to interact with the reconstructed environment. This could include:
    *   **Virtual Object Placement:** Users can place virtual objects within the reconstructed environment.
    *   **Physical Object Augmentation:**  Augments physical objects with digital content. (e.g., displaying information on a physical object when the user looks at it).
    *   **Gesture Recognition:** Enables users to control digital content using gestures.
*   **Rendering Engine:** Renders the reconstructed environment and overlaid digital content in real-time.

**3. Data Flow & Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop

while (true) {

    // 1. Acquire Data
    depth_data = get_depth_data();
    skeleton_data = estimate_pose();
    imu_data = get_imu_data();

    // 2. Dynamic Mesh Generation
    environment_mesh = generate_dynamic_mesh(depth_data, skeleton_data, imu_data);

    // 3. Interaction Handling
    interactions = handle_user_interactions(environment_mesh, skeleton_data);

    // 4. Rendering
    render(environment_mesh, interactions);

}

// Function: generate_dynamic_mesh
function generate_dynamic_mesh(depth_data, skeleton_data, imu_data) {

    // 1. Create initial voxel grid from depth data
    voxel_grid = create_voxel_grid(depth_data);

    // 2.  Deform the voxel grid based on skeleton data:
    //     - For each joint in the skeleton:
    //       -  Expand the voxel grid around the joint to represent limb volume.
    //       -  Adjust the shape of the expansion based on limb pose (bending, stretching).
    //     - Apply IMU data to smooth the deformation and improve tracking.

    // 3. Perform surface reconstruction on the deformed voxel grid.

    // 4. Apply semantic segmentation to identify environment components.

    return reconstructed_mesh;

}
```

**4. Advanced Features:**

*   **Predictive Mesh Generation:** Use machine learning to predict future environment states based on user movement, reducing latency and improving realism.
*   **Multi-User Support:**  Extend the system to support multiple users, creating a shared, interactive environment.
*   **AI-Driven Content Generation:** Use AI to automatically generate digital content that adapts to the user's environment and actions.
