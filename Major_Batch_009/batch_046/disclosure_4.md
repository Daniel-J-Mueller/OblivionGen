## Dynamic Memory Map Shifting & Prediction

**Concept:** Instead of static bad memory cell identification and avoidance, proactively shift data storage locations *before* errors manifest, guided by predictive algorithms and leveraging the identified 'bad' cells as training data.

**Specs:**

*   **Memory Controller Enhancement:** Implement a module within the memory controller responsible for ongoing memory health analysis and dynamic map adjustments.
*   **Error History Database:** Maintain a detailed record of all detected errors, including physical address, time of occurrence, data pattern (if available), and surrounding cell activity. This isn’t just 'bad cell' storage, it's a full memory event log.
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, long short-term memory network) trained on the error history database to predict potential failures in neighboring cells. Features for the model: error rate, cell age, access frequency, temperature readings (from onboard sensors), voltage fluctuations.
*   **Granularity of Shifting:** Implement the ability to shift data at multiple levels:
    *   **Cell Level:** Remap individual cells experiencing predicted issues.
    *   **Nibble/Byte Level:** Shift small data blocks.
    *   **Cache Line Level:** Move entire cache lines.
*   **Data Migration Strategy:** Develop a strategy for migrating data *without* interrupting normal operations. Options:
    *   **Background Migration:** During idle cycles, migrate data based on prediction scores.
    *   **Write-Based Migration:** When data is written to a location with a high prediction score, migrate the entire block to a healthier location first.
    *   **Hybrid Approach:** Combine background and write-based migration.
*   **Health Scoring System:** Assign each memory cell a 'health score' based on the predictive algorithm’s output.  This score will influence migration priority.
*   **Temperature Mapping:** Include thermal sensors placed strategically across the memory module.  Use temperature readings to refine the health score and predictive model.  Higher temperatures = lower health score.
*   **Voltage Monitoring:**  Monitor voltage fluctuations.  Voltage instability contributes to cell degradation. Integrate voltage readings into the health scoring system.
*   **Write Endurance Tracking:**  Monitor write cycles to each cell.  Integrate write endurance data into the health scoring system. Cells approaching their endurance limit should be prioritized for migration.

**Pseudocode (Migration Logic – Simplified):**

```
function migrate_data(physical_address, data):
  health_score = get_health_score(physical_address)
  if health_score < threshold:
    new_address = find_healthy_address()
    copy_data(physical_address, new_address, data)
    update_memory_map(physical_address, new_address)
    return new_address
  else:
    return physical_address

function get_health_score(physical_address):
  // Combine data from predictive model, temperature, voltage, write endurance
  score = predictive_model(physical_address) * weight_model +
          temperature(physical_address) * weight_temp +
          voltage(physical_address) * weight_voltage +
          write_endurance(physical_address) * weight_endurance
  return score
```

**Novelty:**

This differs from the source patent by proactively avoiding failures before they manifest, instead of simply identifying and marking 'bad' cells. It moves beyond error correction to *preventative* memory management. It transforms memory from a static resource into a dynamic, self-healing system. The incorporation of thermal and voltage monitoring adds an extra layer of reliability. The predictive modelling creates a feedback loop – as more errors are observed, the model improves, and the system becomes more resilient.
