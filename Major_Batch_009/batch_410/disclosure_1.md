## Dynamic Trust Score & Adaptive MFA

**Concept:** Expand upon the sign-on tracking data to create a dynamic trust score for each user, and leverage this score to *adaptively* adjust the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements in real-time. This isn't just "high risk = more MFA," but a continuously refined assessment influencing *how* MFA is applied.

**Specs:**

1.  **Trust Score Components:**
    *   **Behavioral Biometrics:**  Analyze typing speed, mouse movements, scrolling patterns, time of day activity, and typical navigation paths *during* the sign-on process itself (not just post-login).
    *   **Geolocation Consistency:** Compare the current sign-in location to historical login locations, factoring in travel patterns and expected commutes.  Significant deviations trigger score adjustments.
    *   **Device Integrity:** Assess the device being used (OS version, browser fingerprint, installed security software) and compare it to known trusted devices.
    *   **Network Reputation:** Evaluate the IP address and network associated with the sign-in attempt against threat intelligence feeds.
    *   **Sign-On Tracking Data Integration:** Directly integrate the existing sign-on tracking data (login times, failed attempts) into the trust score calculation.

2.  **Trust Score Calculation:**
    *   A weighted scoring system should be employed. Weights should be adjustable by administrators based on organizational risk tolerance.
    *   Score range: 0-1000 (0 = extremely untrusted, 1000 = highly trusted).
    *   The score should be continuously updated in real-time *during* the sign-on process, not just after.
    *   A decay factor should be applied to historical data, giving more weight to recent activity.

3.  **Adaptive MFA Implementation:**
    *   **Tiered MFA:** Define multiple MFA tiers (e.g., SMS OTP, Authenticator App, Biometric Authentication, Hardware Security Key).
    *   **Dynamic Tier Assignment:**  Assign MFA tiers based on the real-time trust score.
        *   **High Trust (800-1000):**  No MFA, or "silent" MFA (e.g., device recognition).
        *   **Medium Trust (500-799):**  Low-friction MFA (e.g., Authenticator App push notification).
        *   **Low Trust (0-499):**  High-friction MFA (e.g., SMS OTP, Biometric Authentication, Hardware Security Key).
    *   **Step-Up Authentication:** If the trust score drops *during* a session (e.g., unusual activity detected), trigger a step-up authentication request.

4.  **Risk-Based Challenges:**
    *   Instead of simply requesting MFA, present the user with risk-based challenges.
    *   Example: “We’ve detected a new location.  Is this you?” with options for “Yes” or “No.”  If “No,” immediately initiate MFA.
    *   Challenges should be dynamic and personalized based on the user’s activity and risk profile.

5.  **Pseudocode – Adaptive MFA Decision:**

```
function determineMFA(user, trustScore) {
  if (trustScore >= 800) {
    return "No MFA";
  } else if (trustScore >= 500) {
    return "Authenticator App Push Notification";
  } else {
    // Check for step-up authentication triggers
    if (isStepUpTriggered(user)) {
      return "High-Friction MFA";
    } else {
      return "SMS OTP";
    }
  }
}

function isStepUpTriggered(user) {
    // Check for unusual activity (e.g., new location, device change, unusual access pattern)
    if (user.lastLoginLocation != getCurrentLocation()) {
       return true;
    }
    // Add other checks here
    return false;
}
```

6. **Data Analytics & Feedback Loop:** Continuously analyze the performance of the dynamic trust score and adaptive MFA system.  Use this data to refine the scoring weights, MFA tiers, and risk-based challenges.  A machine learning component could be added to automate this refinement process.
