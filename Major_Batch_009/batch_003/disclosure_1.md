## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Mapping & Predictive Beamforming

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple beam selection based on immediate feedback. Develop a system that *maps* the acoustic environment, predicts likely sound source locations, and proactively adjusts beamforming *before* sound events occur. This isn’t just reacting to detected speech; it's anticipating where sound *will* be.

**Specifications:**

**1. Acoustic Scene Mapping Module:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Utilize the existing microphone array *plus* integrate low-resolution, wide-field-of-view cameras (e.g., thermal or visible light) and potentially ultrasonic sensors.
*   **Data Fusion:** Employ sensor fusion algorithms (Kalman filtering, Bayesian networks) to create a dynamic 3D map of the environment. This map includes static objects (walls, furniture) *and* detected moving objects (people, pets, machines). Object classification is crucial – differentiate between a person likely to speak and a stationary object.
*   **Probabilistic Occupancy Grid:** Represent the environment as a probabilistic occupancy grid. Each cell in the grid indicates the probability of a sound source being present. Update this grid in real-time based on sensor data and predictive algorithms (see Predictive Algorithms).
*   **Output:**  A continuously updated 3D map with probabilistic sound source locations.

**2. Predictive Algorithms:**

*   **Activity Recognition:**  Use machine learning models (RNNs, LSTMs) trained on sensor data (camera feeds, microphone array data - even ambient noise patterns) to recognize human activities (talking, walking, operating machinery). This provides *context* for predicting sound events.
*   **Trajectory Prediction:**  If a moving object is detected, use trajectory prediction algorithms (Kalman filters, particle filters) to estimate its future location.  This enables proactive beamforming towards the predicted sound source.
*   **Sound Propagation Modeling:** Incorporate a simplified sound propagation model to account for reflections, absorption, and diffraction. This allows the system to anticipate how sound will travel through the environment.
*    **Historical Data Integration:** Integrate historical data regarding typical sound event locations and times (e.g., a TV is usually turned on in the living room at 8 PM).
*   **Output:** Probability distributions of likely sound source locations over time.

**3. Predictive Beamforming Engine:**

*   **Beam Prioritization:** Based on the Acoustic Scene Map and Predictive Algorithms, prioritize beams in the direction of likely sound sources.
*   **Dynamic Beam Shaping:** Implement advanced beamforming techniques (e.g., MVDR, MUSIC) to dynamically shape the beams. This allows the system to focus on specific areas while suppressing noise and interference.
*   **Beam Switching Rate Control:**  Dynamically adjust the beam switching rate based on the confidence level of the predicted sound source location. Faster switching for high-confidence predictions, slower switching for low-confidence predictions.
*    **Beamforming History:** Maintain a history of successful and unsuccessful beamforming attempts. Use this data to refine the predictive algorithms and improve beamforming performance.
*   **Output:** Dynamically adjusted beamforming weights for each microphone in the array.

**4. Feedback Integration & Refinement:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to optimize the predictive algorithms and beamforming engine. Reward the system for correctly predicting sound source locations and suppressing noise.
*   **Error Signal Generation:**  Generate an error signal based on the difference between the predicted sound source location and the actual sound source location (as determined by speech recognition or other audio processing techniques).
*   **Adaptive Learning Rate:**  Adjust the learning rate of the reinforcement learning algorithm based on the error signal. Faster learning for large errors, slower learning for small errors.
