## Dynamic Product Substitution & AI-Driven Replacements

**Concept:** Expand the recurring delivery system to proactively suggest and automatically substitute products based on real-time data (availability, price fluctuations, customer preferences gleaned from browsing/purchase history, and even external factors like weather) *before* the order is finalized.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Integration:**
    *   Real-time inventory feeds from suppliers.
    *   Price comparison APIs (multiple vendors).
    *   Customer profile data (purchase history, browsing behavior, explicitly stated preferences, dietary restrictions, allergies).
    *   External data sources (weather forecasts, local event schedules, trending news – relevant to product categories).
*   **AI Model:**
    *   A recommendation engine trained on historical data.
    *   Predictive modeling to forecast product availability & price changes.
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand customer feedback & preferences expressed in free-text form (reviews, support tickets).
*   **Substitution Logic:**
    *   Tiered substitution options:
        *   **Exact Match:** Identical product from a different supplier (priority: price, delivery time).
        *   **Close Match:** Similar product with comparable features & specifications.  (Algorithm: feature vector similarity.)
        *   **AI-Driven Replacement:** Suggests an entirely new product based on inferred needs and preferences (Requires a high confidence level from the AI model.)
    *   Substitution Rules:
        *   User-defined preferences: allow customers to specify acceptable substitutions or opt-out entirely.
        *   Category-specific rules: different rules for food, household goods, personal care items, etc.
        *   Minimum similarity score for AI-driven substitutions.
*   **User Interface (UI):**
    *   "Smart Substitution" toggle in account settings.
    *   Pre-order review screen: Displays proposed substitutions with rationale (price savings, availability, AI recommendation.)
    *   "Approve All Substitutions" option.
    *   "Reject Substitutions" option with ability to specify preferred options or cancel the order.
    *   Post-delivery feedback mechanism: “Was the substitution a good fit?” - Used to refine the AI model.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateOrder(recurringDeliveryList, deliverySlot):
  order = CreateOrder(deliverySlot)
  FOR EACH item IN recurringDeliveryList:
    product = GetProductDetails(item.productId)
    IF product.inStock:
      AddItemToOrder(order, product, item.quantity)
    ELSE:
      substitutions = GetRecommendedSubstitutions(product, customerProfile)
      IF substitutions.length > 0:
        bestSubstitution = SelectBestSubstitution(substitutions, customerPreferences)
        IF bestSubstitution.confidence > threshold:
          // Notify Customer of Substitution - optional depending on settings
          AddItemToOrder(order, bestSubstitution, item.quantity)
        ELSE:
          // Product Out of Stock - Remove from Order or Notify Customer
          RemoveItemFromOrder(order, item.productId)
      ELSE:
        RemoveItemFromOrder(order, item.productId)

  RETURN order
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Scalable cloud infrastructure to handle large volumes of data and real-time processing.
*   Edge computing for faster response times and reduced latency.

**Potential Expansion:**

*   Integrate with voice assistants for hands-free order review and approval.
*   Personalized recommendations based on health data (with user consent).
*   Proactive substitution of seasonal products.
