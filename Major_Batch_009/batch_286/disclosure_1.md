## Adaptive Explainer Granularity via User Cognitive Load

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the complexity of explanations generated for machine learning model predictions based on real-time assessment of user cognitive load.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on *generating* explanations. This specification focuses on *delivering* those explanations in a way optimized for individual user understanding. Different users require different levels of detail. Providing overly complex explanations to a user already struggling to understand the prediction can be counterproductive. Conversely, overly simplistic explanations may frustrate advanced users.

**System Components:**

1.  **Cognitive Load Sensor:** Utilizes a combination of modalities to estimate user cognitive load.  This could include:
    *   **Eye Tracking:** Measures pupil dilation, saccade frequency, and fixation duration. Increased cognitive load correlates with increased pupil dilation and more erratic eye movements.
    *   **EEG (Electroencephalography):** Non-invasive brainwave monitoring to detect changes in brain activity associated with cognitive effort.
    *   **Keyboard/Mouse Interaction:**  Analyzes typing speed, error rate, and mouse movement patterns for signs of hesitation or difficulty.
    *   **Self-Report (Optional):** Periodically prompts the user with a simple rating scale ("How easy is this to understand?").  This is secondary and used to calibrate other sensors.

2.  **Cognitive Load Analyzer:** Processes data from the Cognitive Load Sensor to generate a real-time cognitive load score. This score represents the userâ€™s current level of mental effort.

3.  **Explanation Granularity Manager:**  Controls the complexity of the explanation generated by the existing explainer system (from the provided patent). The manager operates in three modes:
    *   **High Granularity:** Provides detailed explanations, including multiple contributing features and complex relationships.
    *   **Medium Granularity:** Provides a balanced explanation, highlighting the most important features.
    *   **Low Granularity:** Provides a simplified explanation, focusing on a single key feature or a high-level summary.

4.  **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**  Determines the appropriate explanation granularity based on the cognitive load score. This could be implemented as a state machine or a rule-based system.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize:
cognitiveLoadThresholdHigh = 0.7  // Adjust based on calibration
cognitiveLoadThresholdLow  = 0.3  // Adjust based on calibration
currentGranularity = MEDIUM

// Main Loop:
while (user is interacting):
    cognitiveLoadScore = CognitiveLoadAnalyzer.getScore()

    if (cognitiveLoadScore > cognitiveLoadThresholdHigh):
        currentGranularity = LOW
    else if (cognitiveLoadScore < cognitiveLoadThresholdLow):
        currentGranularity = HIGH
    else:
        currentGranularity = MEDIUM

    explanation = ExplainerSystem.generateExplanation(prediction, currentGranularity)
    displayExplanation(explanation)

    // Optional: Periodically recalibrate thresholds based on self-report data
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `CognitiveLoadScore`: Float (0.0 - 1.0) representing cognitive load.
*   `GranularityLevel`: Enum (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   Integration with existing machine learning service infrastructure.
*   Privacy considerations regarding user data collection (eye tracking, EEG).
*   Calibration of cognitive load thresholds for individual users.
*   Adaptive learning algorithm to refine thresholds over time.
