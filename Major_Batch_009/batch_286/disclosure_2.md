## Adaptive Email "Shadowing" for Predictive Deliverability

**Concept:** Expand on the deliverability assessment by proactively “shadowing” email sends *before* committing to a primary send. This creates a real-time, dynamic deliverability profile for each potential email address, exceeding the simple connection assessment in the provided patent.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Send Module:** A system component responsible for initiating low-priority "shadow" email connections *concurrently* to all available email addresses for a user.  These connections are initiated *before* the primary email generation process begins.

2.  **Traffic Shaping:** Shadow sends utilize extremely low bandwidth and are structured to mimic legitimate, non-spam traffic. Implement techniques like delayed sending, randomized intervals, and minimal content (e.g., a single pixel image with a unique tracking ID).

3.  **Multi-Metric Assessment:**  Beyond response times and reply codes (as in the patent), gather the following metrics during shadow sends:
    *   **DNS Lookup Time:** Time to resolve the receiving mail server's DNS record.
    *   **TCP Connection Establishment Time:** Time to establish a TCP connection.
    *   **TLS Handshake Time:** Time for TLS negotiation.
    *   **"Greylisting" Detection:** Detect greylisting attempts by monitoring temporary failures.
    *   **Content Filtering Indicators:** Analyze any automated bounce messages for patterns indicating spam filtering.
    *   **Blacklist Checks:**  Perform real-time blacklist lookups on the receiving IP address.

4.  **Weighted Scoring System:** Assign weights to each metric based on its predictive power.  A machine learning model trains on historical data to optimize these weights. The final score represents the likelihood of successful delivery.

5.  **Dynamic Prioritization:**  Based on the weighted score, dynamically prioritize email addresses for primary sends.  Addresses with higher scores are attempted first.

6.  **Feedback Loop:** Monitor delivery confirmations and bounce rates for primary sends.  Use this data to refine the machine learning model and improve the accuracy of the weighted scoring system.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function assess_deliverability(user_email_list) {
  shadow_connections = []
  metrics = {}

  // Initiate shadow connections to all email addresses
  for each email in user_email_list {
    connection = initiate_shadow_connection(email)
    shadow_connections.append(connection)
    metrics[email] = {}
  }

  // Gather metrics from shadow connections
  for connection in shadow_connections {
    email = connection.email
    metrics[email]["dns_lookup_time"] = measure_dns_lookup_time(connection)
    metrics[email]["tcp_connect_time"] = measure_tcp_connect_time(connection)
    metrics[email]["tls_handshake_time"] = measure_tls_handshake_time(connection)
    metrics[email]["greylisting"] = detect_greylisting(connection)
    metrics[email]["blacklist"] = check_blacklist(connection.receiving_ip)
    // Add more metrics as needed
  }

  // Calculate deliverability score for each email address
  scores = {}
  for email in user_email_list {
    score = calculate_score(metrics[email]) // Uses trained ML model
    scores[email] = score
  }

  // Sort email addresses by deliverability score (highest to lowest)
  sorted_emails = sort_by_score(scores)

  return sorted_emails
}

function calculate_score(metrics) {
    //ML model based on historical deliverability patterns
    //Uses weighted sum of measured metrics (DNS, TCP, TLS, Greylisting, Blacklist, etc.)
    //Returns a score between 0 and 1, representing the probability of successful delivery
}

```

**Potential Improvements:**

*   Implement A/B testing of different shadow send strategies.
*   Integrate with threat intelligence feeds to identify potentially malicious email addresses.
*   Allow users to customize shadow send parameters (e.g., send frequency, content type).
*   Consider the sender's IP reputation and domain age as additional factors.
