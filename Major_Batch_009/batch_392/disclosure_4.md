## Dynamic Catalog "Health" Score & Proactive Remediation

**Concept:** Expand beyond anomaly *detection* to proactive catalog "health" assessment and automated remediation based on predicted user behavior and potential issues. The current patent focuses on spotting unusual activity. This moves towards *preventing* issues before they impact users or require alerts.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time order data (as in the base patent).
    *   Catalog metadata: Item descriptions, images, pricing, categories, associated tags, stock levels.
    *   User behavior data: Click-through rates, search queries (including misspellings & zero-result searches), time spent on product pages, add-to-cart rates, wishlists.
    *   External data: Social media trends, competitor pricing, seasonal factors, current events.
*   **"Health" Score Calculation:**
    *   A multi-dimensional scoring system (0-100) for each item and category. Dimensions include:
        *   **Demand Health:** (Based on order volume, trending demand, forecast accuracy).
        *   **Content Health:** (Based on keyword density, image quality, description completeness, user reviews).
        *   **Search Health:** (Based on click-through rates from search results, zero-result search terms related to the item).
        *   **Price Health:** (Based on competitor pricing, historical price fluctuations, user price sensitivity).
        *   **Stock Health:** (Based on inventory levels, lead times, sales velocity).
*   **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   Utilize machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, time series analysis) to predict future “Health” scores for each item/category.
    *   Models trained on historical data, incorporating seasonal factors, promotional events, and external data sources.
*   **Automated Remediation Engine:**
    *   Triggered when a predicted “Health” score falls below a predefined threshold.
    *   Remediation Actions:
        *   **Content Optimization:**  Suggest improved item descriptions, keywords, or images based on AI analysis of top-performing items. Automatically A/B test different content variations.
        *   **Price Adjustment:** Recommend optimal pricing based on competitor analysis and demand elasticity.
        *   **Inventory Replenishment:**  Automatically trigger purchase orders for low-stock items based on forecasted demand.
        *   **Search Optimization:**  Add relevant keywords to item tags and descriptions to improve search ranking.
        *   **Content Flagging**:  Automatically flag item content for manual review if AI detects potentially misleading or inaccurate information.
*   **Real-Time Dashboard:**
    *   Provides a visual overview of catalog “Health” scores.
    *   Allows catalog administrators to drill down into individual items or categories.
    *   Displays predicted “Health” scores and recommended remediation actions.

**Pseudocode (Remediation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION TriggerRemediation(item_id, predicted_health_score):

  IF predicted_health_score < threshold_low:

    IF dimension = "Content":
      SuggestContentImprovements(item_id)
      ABTestContentVariations(item_id)

    ELSE IF dimension = "Price":
      CalculateOptimalPrice(item_id)
      SuggestPriceAdjustment(item_id)

    ELSE IF dimension = "Inventory":
      CalculateReplenishmentQuantity(item_id)
      GeneratePurchaseOrder(item_id)

    ELSE IF dimension = "Search":
      IdentifyRelevantKeywords(item_id)
      UpdateItemTags(item_id)

    ELSE IF dimension = "Content Quality":
      FlagForManualReview(item_id)

  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive alerting to proactive catalog optimization and predictive problem solving. The dynamic "Health" score allows for early intervention before issues impact user experience or sales.
