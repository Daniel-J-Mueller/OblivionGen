**Adaptive Emotional Resonance System**

**Core Concept:** Extend the event identification beyond simply *what* is happening in the video, to *how* the characters (and ideally, the audience) are feeling *during* those events, and dynamically adjust supplemental content to mirror/enhance/counter those emotional states.

**Specs:**

1.  **Emotional State Modeling:**
    *   Develop a multi-faceted emotional model encompassing primary emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust) and secondary/complex emotions (e.g., nostalgia, anxiety, relief).
    *   Utilize a weighted scoring system for each emotional component, acknowledging that emotional states are rarely pure.
    *   Model "emotional valence" (positive/negative) and "emotional arousal" (intensity).

2.  **Multimodal Emotional Analysis:**
    *   *Audio Analysis:*  Beyond speech recognition & NLP, analyze acoustic features (pitch, tone, rhythm, pauses) in dialogue to infer emotional state. Implement a speaker-specific emotional baseline calibration.
    *   *Visual Analysis:* Analyze facial expressions, body language, and scene composition (color palettes, camera angles) to infer emotional states.  Employ AI to model micro-expressions and subtle cues.
    *   *Dialogue Analysis:*  NLP model trained to identify emotional keywords, sentiment, and emotional arcs within dialogue.  Contextual awareness is critical.

3.  **Dynamic Supplemental Content Generation/Selection:**
    *   *Audio Layer:*  Dynamically adjust background music or ambient soundscapes to match/enhance emotional states.
        *   Algorithm: `MusicSelection(CurrentEmotionalState, EventType) -> MusicTrack`.  Prioritize music tracks that exhibit similar emotional valence and arousal levels.  Implement crossfade transitions.
    *   *Visual Layer:*  Overlay subtle visual effects (color tints, lighting changes, motion blur) to reinforce emotional cues. This should be *extremely* subtle, avoiding distraction.
    *   *Informational Layer:*  Present supplemental information that resonates with the character's emotional state. Example: If a character is feeling nostalgic, display relevant historical images/facts. If a character is facing a difficult decision, provide data/insights relevant to that decision.  The system must assess relevance.
    *   *Haptic Layer (Optional):* Integrate with haptic devices to provide subtle tactile feedback synchronized with emotional events. (e.g., gentle vibration during a tense scene).

4.  **User Personalization:**
    *   Develop a user profile that tracks emotional preferences and sensitivities. (e.g., some users may prefer a more muted emotional experience, while others may prefer a more intense one).
    *   Allow users to customize the level of emotional augmentation.
    *   Implement a feedback mechanism that allows users to rate the effectiveness of the emotional augmentation.

5.  **Event Synchronization:**
    *   Precise time-stamping of all events (speech, visual cues, emotional analysis results) is critical.
    *   Synchronization framework to ensure that supplemental content is presented *exactly* at the right moment to maximize impact.

6.  **Pseudocode Example (Music Selection):**

    ```
    FUNCTION MusicSelection(CurrentEmotionalState, EventType)
    INPUT: CurrentEmotionalState (Emotion Object: Valence, Arousal, EmotionType), EventType (String)
    OUTPUT: MusicTrack (Music File Path)

    // 1. Retrieve potential music tracks based on EventType.
    PotentialTracks = DatabaseQuery("SELECT MusicTrack FROM MusicDatabase WHERE EventType = " + EventType)

    // 2. Filter tracks based on emotional similarity.
    FilteredTracks = []
    FOR track IN PotentialTracks
        TrackEmotion = AnalyzeMusicTrack(track) // Analyze music track for emotional content
        EmotionSimilarityScore = CalculateEmotionSimilarity(CurrentEmotionalState, TrackEmotion)
        IF EmotionSimilarityScore > Threshold
            FilteredTracks.append(track)
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // 3. Select the track with the highest similarity score.
    IF FilteredTracks is not empty
        BestTrack = max(FilteredTracks, key=lambda track: CalculateEmotionSimilarity(CurrentEmotionalState, AnalyzeMusicTrack(track)))
        RETURN BestTrack
    ELSE
        // No suitable tracks found. Return default ambient track.
        RETURN DefaultAmbientTrack
    ENDIF
    ```
