## Adaptive Message Attenuation via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the message security framework to dynamically adjust message delivery based on recipient physiological state, detected via wearable biofeedback sensors. This introduces a layer of context-aware security, going beyond simple access control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biofeedback Integration Module:**

*   **Sensor Input:** Accepts real-time physiological data streams (heart rate variability, skin conductance, brainwave activity – EEG, etc.) from compatible wearable devices via Bluetooth/WiFi. Standardized API for diverse sensor integration.
*   **State Classification:** Employs machine learning models (trained on individual baselines) to classify recipient cognitive/emotional states (e.g., focused, stressed, distracted, fatigued).  Model updates via federated learning to preserve privacy.
*   **Attenuation Profiles:** Defines a mapping between classified states and message attenuation levels. Levels range from full delivery, to summarized delivery (key information only), to delayed delivery, to complete suppression.  Configurable via administrative interface.
*   **Privacy Controls:**  Recipient control over data sharing and attenuation profile application.  Option to disable biofeedback integration entirely. All biofeedback data remains client-side, processed locally unless explicitly authorized for cloud-based analysis.

**2. Message Processing Service Modification:**

*   **Biofeedback Request:**  Upon message arrival, the service queries the Biofeedback Integration Module for the recipient’s current state (if biofeedback integration is enabled).
*   **Attenuation Application:**  Based on the received state and configured attenuation profile, the message is processed accordingly.  Summarization algorithms leverage NLP to extract key information.
*   **Delivery Scheduling:** Delayed delivery utilizes a queueing system, releasing messages when the recipient enters a more receptive state.
*   **Security Logging:**  Records attenuation events (state, applied level, timestamp) for audit trails.

**3. Administrative Interface Expansion:**

*   **Attenuation Profile Management:** Allows administrators to define and customize attenuation profiles for different user groups or message types.
*   **Biofeedback Integration Configuration:**  Controls global enablement of biofeedback integration and sets default configurations.
*   **User-Level Overrides:** Provides administrators with the ability to override user-level biofeedback settings for security reasons (with appropriate logging).
*   **Reporting & Analytics:**  Provides insights into attenuation event frequency and effectiveness.

**Pseudocode (Message Processing Service):**

```
function processMessage(message, recipient) {
  if (recipient.biofeedbackEnabled) {
    state = BiofeedbackIntegrationModule.getState(recipient)
    attenuationLevel = getAttenuationLevel(state, message.type)

    if (attenuationLevel == "summarized") {
      summary = NLP.summarize(message.content)
      message.content = summary
    } else if (attenuationLevel == "delayed") {
      addMessageToQueue(message, recipient, delayTime)
      return // Do not deliver immediately
    } else if (attenuationLevel == "suppressed") {
      logSuppressionEvent(message, recipient)
      return // Do not deliver
    }
  }

  deliverMessage(message, recipient)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Critical Alert Filtering:** Suppress non-critical alerts when a user is under stress or focused on a critical task.
*   **Personalized Information Delivery:** Tailor the level of detail in messages based on the user’s cognitive load.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Prevent sensitive information from being delivered to a compromised or distracted user.
*   **Improved Productivity:** Minimize interruptions and distractions during periods of focused work.
