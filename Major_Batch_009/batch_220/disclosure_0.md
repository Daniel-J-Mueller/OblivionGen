## Adaptive Radar-Visual Fusion for Predictive Alerting

**System Overview:** A networked sensor array integrating frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, low-resolution thermal imaging, and a high-resolution visible light camera. The system is designed to anticipate potential hazards *before* they enter the primary camera’s field of view, reducing reaction time and enabling proactive responses.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **FMCW Radar Array:** Multiple low-cost FMCW radar units strategically positioned to create overlapping coverage extending beyond the primary camera’s FOV. Each unit operates with configurable chirp sequences (see software configuration).
*   **Thermal Imager (Low Resolution):** A wide-angle, low-resolution thermal camera providing heat signature detection beyond visual range and in low-light conditions.
*   **High-Resolution Visible Light Camera:** Standard camera for identification and recording.
*   **Edge Compute Unit:** On-board processing for data fusion, object tracking, and alerting.
*   **Network Interface:** Wireless communication for data transmission and system updates.

**Software Configuration & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Radar Pre-Processing:**
    *   Each radar unit transmits and receives FMCW signals.
    *   Range, velocity, and angle of arrival (AoA) data are extracted.
    *   Data is filtered to remove noise and stationary objects.
    *   `RadarData = ProcessRadarSignal(RawRadarData)`

2.  **Thermal Image Processing:**
    *   Thermal data is segmented to identify potential heat sources.
    *   `ThermalBlobs = SegmentThermalImage(RawThermalData)`

3.  **Data Fusion & Predictive Tracking:**
    *   Radar detections and thermal blobs are associated based on proximity and velocity.
    *   A Kalman filter is used to predict the future trajectory of detected objects.
    *   `TrackedObject = KalmanFilter(RadarData, ThermalBlobs)`
    *   If a predicted trajectory intersects a "safe zone" boundary, an alert is triggered.
    *   `If(PredictedTrajectoryIntersectsSafeZone) { TriggerAlert() }`
    *   The system assesses the ‘threat level’ based on trajectory and velocity.

4.  **Camera Activation & Tracking Handover:**
    *   When an object is predicted to enter the primary camera's FOV, the camera is activated.
    *   The camera’s tracking system seamlessly takes over tracking from the radar and thermal data.
    *   `Camera.ActivateTracking(TrackedObject)`

5.  **Dynamic Chirp Sequencing:**
    *   Radar chirp parameters (frequency, bandwidth, duration) are dynamically adjusted based on environmental conditions and object density.
    *   Higher bandwidth for short-range, high-resolution detection in crowded environments.
    *   Lower bandwidth for long-range detection in open spaces.
    *   `ChirpParameters = OptimizeChirp(EnvironmentConditions, ObjectDensity)`

6.  **AI-Powered Signature Learning:**
    *   The system learns the radar and thermal signatures of common objects (people, animals, vehicles) to improve detection accuracy.
    *   This helps reduce false alarms and prioritize alerts.
    *   `ObjectSignature = LearnObjectSignature(RadarData, ThermalData)`

**System Parameters:**

*   **Radar Frequency:** 77 GHz
*   **Radar Bandwidth:** Configurable (1 GHz - 5 GHz)
*   **Radar Chirp Duration:** Configurable (50 μs - 500 μs)
*   **Thermal Imager Resolution:** 8x8 pixels
*   **Camera Resolution:** 1080p
*   **Communication Protocol:** Wi-Fi 6
*   **Processing Unit:** NVIDIA Jetson Nano

**Novelty:** The integration of low-resolution thermal imaging with FMCW radar *prior* to visual confirmation creates a proactive safety system, expanding the detection range and reducing reaction time compared to systems relying solely on visual or radar detection. Dynamic chirp sequencing allows the radar to adapt to changing conditions, improving accuracy and reducing power consumption.  The signature learning component further enhances detection accuracy and reduces false alarms.
