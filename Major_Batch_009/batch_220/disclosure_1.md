## Secure Key Derivation via Biometric Entropy

**Concept:** Augment the cryptographic key provisioning system with real-time biometric data as an entropy source for deriving (or supplementing) cryptographic keys. This provides an additional layer of security and key uniqueness tied to the physical presence of an authorized user, circumventing attacks targeting pre-provisioned keys.

**System Specs:**

*   **Biometric Input Module:** Integrated module (fingerprint, iris, voice, etc.) capturing raw biometric data.  High resolution/fidelity required.
*   **Entropy Extraction Engine:**  Hardware-accelerated random number generator (RNG) utilizing the raw biometric data as input.  This is *not* simply hashing the biometric data;  the RNG should exploit inherent randomness within the biometric signal itself.  Algorithms considered: chaotic mapping, jitter extraction, physiological noise amplification.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF) Integration:** The existing KDF (used to derive the second cryptographic key) is modified to *include* the output of the Entropy Extraction Engine as an additional input. This ensures that the derived key is influenced by the user’s biometric data at the time of derivation.
*   **Secure Element Integration:** All biometric processing and entropy extraction occur within a dedicated Secure Element (SE) to protect against tampering and data exfiltration.  The SE handles key storage and cryptographic operations.
*   **Challenge-Response Protocol:** A challenge-response protocol is implemented.  The provisioning system issues a random challenge to the device. The device then uses the biometric input, entropy extraction, and KDF to generate a response, which is sent back to the provisioning system for verification.
*   **Dynamic Key Refresh:**  The system periodically (or on-demand) re-derives the second cryptographic key using the biometric input, refreshing the key material and mitigating the risk of long-term compromise.  Frequency adjustable via secure configuration.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```
function derive_key(persistent_key, biometric_data, challenge):
    // 1. Extract entropy from biometric data
    entropy = extract_entropy(biometric_data)

    // 2. Concatenate inputs for KDF
    kdf_input = persistent_key + entropy + challenge

    // 3. Apply KDF
    derived_key = KDF(kdf_input)

    return derived_key
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `biometric_sampling_rate`:  Sampling rate of the biometric sensor (adjustable for quality/performance).
*   `entropy_extraction_algorithm`:  Selection of entropy extraction algorithm.
*   `key_refresh_interval`:  Time interval between key refreshes.
*   `challenge_size`: Size of the random challenge issued by the provisioning system.
*   `kdf_algorithm`: Specifies the KDF to be used (e.g. HKDF, scrypt).



**Novelty:** While biometric authentication is common, its use as a *direct input to key derivation*—rather than simply unlocking a pre-existing key—is novel.  This creates a constantly shifting, uniquely derived key tied to the physical presence of the user, significantly enhancing security. This contrasts with approaches where biometrics are solely used for authentication prior to accessing stored keys.
