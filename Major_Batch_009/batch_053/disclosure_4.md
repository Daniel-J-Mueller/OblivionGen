## Temporal-Spatial Attention for Video Summarization & Retrieval

**Concept:** Expand the temporal shifting concept to include *spatial* attention mechanisms, not just for retrieval accuracy, but for automated video summarization. The core idea is to identify and emphasize salient spatial regions within each time-shifted frame, creating condensed, representative 'key-frames' for both improved search and automatic highlight reel generation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Spatial Attention Module (SAM):**
    *   Input: Time-shifted frame.
    *   Process: Utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate attention maps highlighting regions of interest within the frame.  The CNN should be pre-trained on a large dataset of visually diverse content.
    *   Output: Attention map (normalized weights indicating spatial importance).

2.  **Temporal-Spatial Feature Fusion (TSFF):**
    *   Input: Embeddings from time-shifted frames *and* corresponding attention maps from SAM.
    *   Process:  Element-wise multiplication of the frame embeddings with the attention maps. This effectively 'weights' the features based on spatial relevance.  A subsequent fully connected layer processes the weighted features.
    *   Output:  Fused temporal-spatial embedding.

3.  **Key-Frame Selection (KFS):**
    *   Input:  Sequence of fused temporal-spatial embeddings.
    *   Process:  Employ a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means) on the embedding sequence.  Each cluster represents a thematic segment of the video. The embedding closest to the cluster centroid is selected as the 'key-frame' for that segment.  A diversity penalty can be added to the clustering process to ensure key-frames are visually distinct.
    *   Output:  Sequence of key-frames representing a condensed video summary.

4.  **Retrieval Enhancement:**
    *   During search, the input text is used to generate a text embedding.
    *   The text embedding is compared to the fused temporal-spatial embeddings of the time-shifted frames.
    *   Frames with high similarity scores are ranked higher in the search results.
    *   The selected key-frames are presented alongside the video as visual previews.

**Pseudocode (KFS Module):**

```python
def keyframe_selection(embeddings, num_keyframes):
  # embeddings: List of fused temporal-spatial embeddings
  # num_keyframes: Desired number of keyframes

  kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_keyframes)
  cluster_assignments = kmeans.fit_predict(embeddings)

  keyframe_indices = []
  for i in range(num_keyframes):
    # Find the embedding closest to the centroid of cluster i
    cluster_points = [embeddings[j] for j in range(len(embeddings)) if cluster_assignments[j] == i]
    centroid = numpy.mean(cluster_points, axis=0)
    distances = [numpy.linalg.norm(embedding - centroid) for embedding in cluster_points]
    closest_index = cluster_points.index(cluster_points[distances.index(min(distances))])
    keyframe_indices.append(closest_index)

  return keyframe_indices
```

**Novelty:** The combination of temporal shifting with spatial attention for both retrieval *and* automated summarization is a novel approach. While temporal analysis is present in the source patent, actively integrating spatial awareness through attention mechanisms is new, leading to richer feature representations and more effective summarization.
