## Adaptive Statmux Priority & Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the existing statmux capability (Claim 14) by introducing a dynamic priority system based on predicted viewer engagement *and* a predictive buffering scheme utilizing client-side data. This moves beyond simple priority levels (Claim 13) to actively shape the stream content based on real-time audience behavior, maximizing perceived quality for the most engaged viewers.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Engagement Prediction Engine (Server-Side)**
    *   Input: Real-time viewer data (watch time, interactions - polls, comments, etc.), historical data for similar content, content metadata (tags, genre, etc.), network conditions for each viewer (estimated bandwidth, latency).
    *   Process: Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained to predict individual viewer “engagement score” – a metric representing the probability of continued viewing. This score should also account for network condition degradation tolerance – a higher bandwidth viewer can tolerate lower quality for longer.
    *   Output:  Per-viewer engagement score, prioritized stream request list.

*   **Component 2: Adaptive Statmux Controller (Server-Side)**
    *   Input: Prioritized stream request list (from Engagement Prediction Engine), available source streams (from multiple cameras/sources), network bandwidth constraints.
    *   Process:
        1.  Allocate bandwidth proportionally to engagement scores.  Higher scores receive more bandwidth/quality.
        2.  Dynamically adjust the statmux composition. If a viewer's engagement score drops, gracefully reduce their allocated bandwidth and quality.  This bandwidth can be reallocated to higher-engagement viewers.
        3.  Implement a “quality ramp-up” and “quality ramp-down” mechanism to avoid jarring transitions.
    *   Output:  Statmuxed stream tailored to each viewer's engagement level.

*   **Component 3: Predictive Buffering Client (Client-Side)**
    *   Input:  Viewer interaction data (clicks, scrolls, etc.), network conditions, historical playback data for the current stream.
    *   Process:
        1.  Predict short-term viewing behavior (e.g., likely to switch cameras, replay a moment).
        2.  Pre-fetch relevant stream segments in advance.
        3.  Prioritize pre-fetched segments based on predicted need, buffering segments for anticipated camera switches or replays.
        4.  Dynamically adjust buffer size based on current engagement and predicted engagement.
    *   Output: Smooth, uninterrupted playback experience even with fluctuating network conditions.

*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Server to Client:  Stream metadata containing engagement level indicators (allowing the client to adjust buffering) and pre-fetch hints.
    *   Client to Server: Real-time interaction data and network condition reports.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Statmux Controller):**

```
function allocateBandwidth(viewerList, availableBandwidth):
    totalEngagement = sum(viewer.engagementScore for viewer in viewerList)
    for viewer in viewerList:
        viewer.allocatedBandwidth = (viewer.engagementScore / totalEngagement) * availableBandwidth

function composeStatmuxStream(viewerList):
    for viewer in viewerList:
        selectedStreams = chooseStreamsBasedOnQualityAndBandwidth(viewer.allocatedBandwidth, viewer.preferences)
        createStatmuxedStream(selectedStreams)

function chooseStreamsBasedOnQualityAndBandwidth(allocatedBandwidth, preferences):
    # logic to select the best streams based on available bandwidth and viewer preferences
    # (e.g., prioritize main camera, then secondary cameras, then replays)
    return selectedStreams

function createStatmuxedStream(selectedStreams):
    # logic to combine the selected streams into a single statmuxed stream
    return statmuxedStream
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond basic prioritization and adaptive bitrate streaming by actively *shaping* the stream content based on predicted viewer engagement.  The predictive buffering client enhances the experience by proactively preparing for anticipated viewer actions. The dynamic allocation of resources based on predicted behavior is a significant departure from existing statmux systems.
