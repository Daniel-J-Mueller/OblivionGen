## Dynamic Contextual Layering for Predictive Content

**Concept:** Expand the intent grouping beyond purely navigational paths to incorporate real-time sensor data and environmental context, creating a multi-layered predictive model. The core idea is to move beyond *what* a user has browsed to *where* and *how* they are browsing, anticipating needs based on a holistic situational awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration Module:**
    *   Input: Access to device sensors (GPS, accelerometer, microphone, camera – with user permission, of course).  External data sources (weather, traffic, time of day, local events APIs).
    *   Processing:  Real-time data stream processing. Noise filtering. Feature extraction (speed, location accuracy, ambient sound level, visual scene analysis).
    *   Output:  Contextual Feature Vector (CFV). This is a normalized, weighted representation of the current situation.

*   **CFV Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   Input:  Historical user data, intent grouping data (from existing system), real-time CFV.
    *   Processing:  Bayesian network or similar probabilistic model. Learn weights for each CFV element based on correlation with successful content predictions within specific intent groupings.  Adapt weights dynamically over time.
    *   Output:  Weighted CFV.

*   **Layered Intent Grouping Model:**
    *   Structure: Intent groupings are now represented as multi-dimensional "contextual profiles". Each profile comprises:
        *   Navigation Path History (as in existing system) - Weight: 30%
        *   Demographic Data (age, gender, location) – Weight: 10%
        *   Temporal Data (time of day, day of week, season) – Weight: 10%
        *   Weighted CFV – Weight: 50%
    *   Similarity Metric:  Modified cosine similarity.  Includes weighted components for each layer.

*   **Content Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input:  Current Navigation Path, User Profile, Weighted CFV, Layered Intent Groupings.
    *   Processing:
        1.  Identify top-N matching intent groupings based on layered similarity metric.
        2.  For each grouping, calculate a content score based on:
            *   Frequency of content within the grouping.
            *   Recency of content access within the grouping.
            *   Correlation between Weighted CFV and content attributes (e.g., content related to outdoor activities if high accelerometer activity is detected).
        3.  Rank and select top-K content items.

*   **API Integration:**  Standardized API for accessing contextual data and content prediction results. Supports integration with existing content delivery systems.

**Pseudocode (Content Prediction Engine):**

```
function predictContent(navigationPath, userProfile, weightedCFV):
  intentGroups = findMatchingIntentGroups(navigationPath, userProfile, weightedCFV)  //returns list of intent groupings
  contentScores = {}

  for group in intentGroups:
    for content in group.contentList:
      score = calculateContentScore(content, group, weightedCFV)
      contentScores[content] = score

  sortedContent = sortContentByScore(contentScores)  //sorts the content from highest to lowest score

  return sortedContent[0:K] //returns top K content items
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems focus primarily on navigational history. This expands the model to incorporate real-time contextual information, creating a more nuanced and accurate predictive model. It’s about *understanding* the user’s situation, not just remembering what they’ve done.
