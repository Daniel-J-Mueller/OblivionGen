## Secure Ephemeral Channel for Dynamic Permissioning

**Concept:** Leverage the ephemeral credential generation from the patent to build a system where a user's access isn't just *to* data, but *permissioned through* a continuously authenticated channel.  Instead of static roles (admin, user, etc.), permissions are granted and revoked dynamically based on a constantly re-validated connection. This goes beyond simple MFA – it’s a continuously assessed trust level.

**Specifications:**

**1. Channel Establishment & Validation:**

*   **Initialization:** Client device initiates connection. Server requests ephemeral credential delivery to a pre-registered communication channel (SMS, Email, dedicated app notification).
*   **Ephemeral Credential:** Server generates time-limited (e.g., 30-second validity) and/or use-limited ephemeral credential.
*   **Channel Validation:** Client submits credential received *through* the communication channel. Server validates credential against expected value and expiry. Successful validation establishes a ‘Dynamic Trust Channel’ (DTC).

**2. Permission Request & Granter:**

*   **Resource Access Request:** Client attempts to access a resource.
*   **Permission Check:** Server identifies required permissions for resource.
*   **DTC Assessment:** Server assesses the DTC's current state (validation success, time since last validation, channel health metrics – delivered/read status, etc.).  Assigns a "Trust Score" based on DTC assessment.
*   **Permission Grant/Denial:** Based on Trust Score, server grants or denies access. Access levels can be tiered – full access, read-only, limited functionality.
*   **Continuous Re-Validation:**  The server *repeatedly* requests new ephemeral credentials through the communication channel at pre-defined intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) *during* active sessions. Failure to respond or invalid credentials *immediately* revoke access.

**3. System Components:**

*   **Authentication Server:** Handles initial authentication, ephemeral credential generation, validation, and session management.
*   **Communication Channel Adapters:** Modules for integrating with various communication channels (SMS gateways, email servers, push notification services).
*   **Resource Servers:**  Servers hosting protected resources.  They rely on the Authentication Server for permission verification.
*   **Client SDK:**  Software development kit for integrating the system into client applications.

**4. Pseudocode (Authentication Server – Permission Check):**

```
function checkPermission(clientID, resourceID):
  user = getUserFromSession(clientID)
  requiredPermissions = getPermissionsForResource(resourceID)

  trustScore = getTrustScore(clientID)  //Assess DTC Health
  if trustScore < threshold:
    log("Permission Denied: Low Trust Score")
    return false

  if user.hasPermissions(requiredPermissions):
    log("Permission Granted")
    return true
  else:
    log("Permission Denied: Insufficient Permissions")
    return false

function getTrustScore(clientID):
  lastValidationTime = getLastValidationTime(clientID)
  currentTime = getCurrentTime()
  timeSinceLastValidation = currentTime - lastValidationTime

  //Assess channel health (delivered/read status)

  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(timeSinceLastValidation, channelHealth)
  return trustScore
```

**5.  Novelty/Differentiation:**

This system goes beyond traditional authentication and authorization.  It doesn't just verify *who* the user is; it continuously assesses the *integrity of the communication channel* used for authentication.  This adds a layer of security against man-in-the-middle attacks and compromised devices.  The dynamic, tiered permissioning allows for granular access control based on real-time risk assessment.  The communication channel is almost a 'living' key.
