## Dynamic Ad Creative Synthesis via Generative AI

**Concept:** Expand upon the landing page type awareness to dynamically generate ad *content* (not just links) using generative AI models, tailoring visuals and messaging to each referral type. This goes beyond simply directing traffic to an existing page – it *creates* ads specifically optimized for each source.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Referral data stream (as in the patent), including referral type (landing page, source, product ID, query text). Also requires access to a trained generative AI model (image & text) – potentially a diffusion model for images, and a large language model (LLM) for ad copy.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Referral Analyzer:** Identifies referral type (existing functionality).
    *   **Creative Brief Generator:** Translates referral type into a set of parameters for the generative AI model.
        *   Landing Page Type: 'Detail' -> Focus on product features & benefits. ‘Browse Node’ -> Highlight category benefits. ‘Search’ -> Address user intent from search query.
        *   Source Identifier: Identify brand aesthetic/style guide to match.
        *   Product ID: Use product details (description, images) as a conditioning input.
        *   Query Text:  Extract keywords/intent to shape ad copy.
    *   **AI Creative Engine:**  Generates image & text ad variants based on the creative brief. The engine needs API access to the generative AI model.
    *   **A/B Testing Module:**  Automatically launches A/B tests of generated ad variants to optimize performance.
    *   **Ad Platform Integration:**  Submits optimized ad variants to relevant ad platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.).
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateAd(referralData)
  referralType = AnalyzeReferral(referralData)
  creativeBrief = GenerateCreativeBrief(referralType)
  adVariants = AICreativeEngine(creativeBrief)
  bestVariant = ABTest(adVariants)
  SubmitAd(bestVariant, adPlatform)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION GenerateCreativeBrief(referralType)
  brief = {}
  brief.landingPageType = referralType.landingPageType
  brief.sourceStyle = GetSourceStyle(referralType.sourceIdentifier)
  brief.productDetails = GetProductDetails(referralType.productIdentifier)
  brief.keywords = ExtractKeywords(referralType.queryText)
  RETURN brief
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Data Requirements:**
    *   Training data for generative AI model (images, ad copy, product details).
    *   Source style guide database (brand guidelines for various referring sources).
    *   Product catalog database.
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Dynamic video generation.
    *   Personalized ad copy based on user profiles.
    *   Real-time adaptation of ad creative based on performance.
    *   Integration with a content moderation system.
