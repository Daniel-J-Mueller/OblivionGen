## Dynamic Interstitial Complexity via Generative Adversarial Networks

**Concept:** Instead of static interstitial challenges, employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to *dynamically* generate interstitial tasks tailored to the individual user's behavioral profile and automated agent detection score. The complexity of the generated task adapts in real-time based on the user's interaction.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collection:** Expand the current "prior activity" data to include:
    *   Mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, jitter).
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure – if available).
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, patterns).
    *   Touchscreen input data (if applicable).
    *   Time spent on different elements of the page before hitting the interstitial.
2.  **GAN Architecture:**
    *   **Generator:** A neural network (e.g., a convolutional or recurrent network) trained to generate interstitial challenges. These could be:
        *   Image recognition tasks with varying degrees of obfuscation/noise.
        *   Simple logic puzzles (e.g., "What comes next in this sequence?").
        *   Text-based challenges (e.g., identify the misspelled word).
        *   Slightly distorted CAPTCHAs – not easily solvable by current solvers, but not overly difficult for humans.
    *   **Discriminator:** A neural network trained to distinguish between human and automated agent interaction with the generated challenges. It analyzes input data (mouse movements, keystrokes, time taken to complete the challenge, success/failure rate) to make the determination.
3.  **Automated Agent Score Integration:** The existing automated agent score is used as initial input to the GAN. A higher score means the generator will produce more complex challenges.
4.  **Real-Time Adaptation:**
    *   As the user interacts with the challenge, the discriminator provides feedback to the generator.
    *   If the discriminator detects bot-like behavior, the generator *increases* the complexity of the challenge in real-time (e.g., adds more noise to an image, introduces a new rule to a puzzle).
    *   If the user demonstrates natural interaction, the generator *decreases* the complexity, potentially even removing the challenge altogether.
5.  **Challenge Library:** Maintain a library of base challenge components. The GAN will combine and modify these components to create unique and dynamic challenges.
6.  **Interstitial UI:** The interstitial UI should be designed to seamlessly integrate with the site's design and minimize disruption to the user experience.

**Pseudocode (Generator):**

```
function generate_challenge(user_profile, agent_score, current_challenge_state):
  base_challenge = select_random_challenge_component(user_profile)
  complexity_level = agent_score + current_challenge_state.difficulty 

  modified_challenge = apply_modifications(base_challenge, complexity_level) // e.g., add noise, increase puzzle complexity

  return modified_challenge
```

**Pseudocode (Discriminator):**

```
function is_bot(interaction_data):
  features = extract_features(interaction_data) // e.g., mouse speed, keystroke timing, success rate
  prediction = model.predict(features)
  return prediction > threshold // threshold determines sensitivity
```

**Rationale:** This approach moves beyond static challenges, making it significantly harder for automated agents to adapt. The real-time adaptation ensures that the challenge is always appropriately difficult, minimizing user frustration while maximizing bot detection. The GAN provides a framework for generating a nearly infinite variety of challenges, making it even more difficult for bots to learn and bypass the system.
