## Dynamic Model Partitioning with Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Extend the existing model distribution system by dynamically adjusting the partitioning of the ML model *during* execution, guided by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent observes performance metrics (latency, power consumption, resource utilization) from both the edge and non-edge devices and iteratively optimizes the partitioning to achieve a user-defined objective.

**Specs:**

1.  **RL Agent:**
    *   **State:** Vector of performance metrics (latency, CPU utilization, memory usage, power consumption) from both edge and non-edge devices for each layer (or block of layers) of the ML model. Also includes network latency between edge and non-edge devices.
    *   **Action:** Discrete action space representing the assignment of each layer (or block of layers) to either the edge device or the non-edge device.
    *   **Reward:** Reward function based on the user-defined objective (e.g., minimize latency, minimize power consumption, maximize throughput).  This function should allow for weighted objectives (e.g., 70% latency, 30% power).
    *   **Algorithm:**  Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Q-Network (DQN) preferred.

2.  **Model Partitioning Interface:**
    *   A system component responsible for receiving partitioning decisions from the RL agent and dynamically reconfiguring the model execution graph.
    *   Supports model serialization/deserialization and transfer between edge and non-edge devices.
    *   Handles data dependencies between partitioned layers.

3.  **Performance Monitoring System:**
    *   Collects real-time performance metrics from both edge and non-edge devices.
    *   Provides aggregated metrics to the RL agent as part of the state.
    *   Must have minimal overhead to avoid impacting performance.

4.  **Simulation Environment:**
    *   A realistic simulation environment to pre-train the RL agent.
    *   Should accurately model network latency, device characteristics, and workload variations.

**Pseudocode (RL Agent Update):**

```
Initialize RL Agent (Policy Network)
Initialize Simulation Environment

For episode in range(num_episodes):
    Observe initial state (performance metrics)
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = Agent.select_action(state)  // Assign layers to edge/non-edge
        PartitioningInterface.reconfigure(action)
        new_state, reward, done = Environment.step() // Run model with new partition
        Agent.update(state, action, reward, new_state) // Update policy network
        state = new_state

    Log episode performance
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Granularity of partitioning: Explore partitioning at the layer level, block of layers, or even operator level.
*   Dynamic adaptation to workload: Consider incorporating workload characteristics (e.g., image size, number of objects) into the state space.
*   Multi-objective optimization: Use a multi-objective reward function to balance multiple performance metrics.
*   Federated Learning Integration:  Combine dynamic partitioning with federated learning to improve model accuracy and personalization. The RL agent could adapt partitioning based on the data distribution on the edge device.
