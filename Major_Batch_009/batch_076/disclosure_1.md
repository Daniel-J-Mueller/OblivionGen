## Dynamic Affective Audio Sculpting

**Concept:** Extend the audio modification capabilities beyond text-driven adjustments and user interaction metrics. Introduce real-time emotional analysis of the *user* while consuming the content, then dynamically sculpt the audio to enhance or counter the user's emotional state, creating a feedback loop.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Webpage/Content data (visual and audio).
    *   User audio/video stream (optional – fallback to keyboard/mouse interaction if stream unavailable).
    *   Real-time emotion detection model (trained on facial expressions, vocal tone, and/or physiological data – heart rate, skin conductance via wearable integration).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Emotion Analysis:** Continuously analyze the user’s emotional state (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, neutrality) from the input stream. Categorize emotion with a confidence score.
    2.  **Audio Feature Extraction:** Analyze the audio content, identifying key features (e.g., tempo, pitch, timbre, dynamic range).
    3.  **Affective Mapping:**  Establish a mapping between user emotional states and desired audio adjustments.  This mapping is configurable and can be learned over time (personalized profiles). Examples:
        *   *User Sad:* Increase tempo, brighten timbre, add uplifting melodic elements, subtly increase volume.
        *   *User Angry:* Decrease tempo, dampen high frequencies, introduce calming ambient sounds, lower volume.
        *   *User Neutral:* Maintain original audio.
        *   *User Fearful:* Reduce dynamic range, soften transients, introduce calming rhythmic patterns.
    4.  **Dynamic Audio Sculpting:**  Apply the mapped audio adjustments in real-time. This could involve:
        *   EQ adjustments.
        *   Pitch shifting.
        *   Tempo manipulation.
        *   Adding or removing sound effects (e.g., reverb, chorus).
        *   Generating new melodic or harmonic elements to complement the existing audio.
        *   Crossfading between different audio layers.
    5.  **Feedback Loop:** Monitor user response (e.g., facial expressions, vocal tone, interaction patterns) *after* applying adjustments. Refine the affective mapping based on this feedback to optimize the user experience.
*   **Output:** Dynamically modified audio stream.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Microphone/Camera (for user emotion detection).
    *   Audio processing unit (DSP or equivalent) capable of real-time audio manipulation.
*   **Software Requirements:**
    *   Emotion detection model (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).
    *   Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) or audio processing library (e.g., Librosa, Sounddevice).
    *   Machine learning framework for affective mapping and feedback loop refinement.

**Pseudocode:**

```
loop:
  user_emotion = detect_emotion(user_audio_video)
  audio_features = extract_features(content_audio)

  adjustment_parameters = affective_mapping(user_emotion, audio_features)

  modified_audio = apply_adjustments(content_audio, adjustment_parameters)

  user_response = analyze_response(user_audio_video)
  update_mapping(user_response, adjustment_parameters)

  output(modified_audio)
end loop
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive audio adjustment based on content & user interaction, to *proactive* emotional regulation via real-time audio sculpting. Personalizes the experience to the user's current emotional state.
