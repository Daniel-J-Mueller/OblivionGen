## Dynamic Merchant Interface (DMI) – Specification

**Concept:** Extend the core ‘display object’ functionality to allow for actively customizable merchant interfaces *within* the service’s display object, going beyond simple display and order placement.

**Core Functionality:**  Instead of a static display object, the service acts as a mini-app container *within* the merchant's webpage. Merchants can offer ‘interface modules’ (UI components, data connections) that the user's display object instance can dynamically load and configure. This allows merchants to offer deeply integrated experiences, like personalized product configurators, AR previews, or loyalty program dashboards, all contained *within* the secure service environment.

**Technical Specifications:**

1.  **Interface Module Repository:**
    *   A central repository stores interface modules, versioned and digitally signed by the merchant.
    *   Modules are built using a standardized web component framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Svelte) and conform to defined API contracts.  The service provides a limited, sandboxed JavaScript environment for execution.
    *   Metadata includes:  Module name, description, API requirements, UI dimensions, security permissions.

2.  **Dynamic Configuration API:**
    *   An API allows the merchant to send configuration data to the display object instance at runtime.  This allows the merchant to customize the interface based on user data, product context, or A/B testing results.
    *   Configuration data is transmitted via secure HTTPS with mutual TLS authentication.  A schema validation step enforces data integrity.

3.  **User Preference System:**
    *   The service maintains a user profile that stores preferences for how merchant interfaces are displayed (e.g., size, position, theme).
    *   Users can ‘pin’ frequently used interfaces or block unwanted ones.

4.  **Secure Data Exchange:**
    *   All communication between the service, the merchant, and the user device is encrypted.
    *   Data exchange is governed by a strict permission system.  The user has full control over which data is shared with the merchant.

5.  **Rendering Engine:**
    *   The service incorporates a lightweight rendering engine that can render the interface modules within the display object container.
    *   The engine supports common web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and provides a consistent user experience across different browsers and devices.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Module Loading):**

```
function loadModule(moduleId, configData) {
  // Retrieve module metadata from repository
  moduleMetadata = getModuleMetadata(moduleId)

  // Validate module signature and permissions
  if (!validateModule(moduleMetadata)) {
    // Log error and return
    return
  }

  // Fetch module code from repository
  moduleCode = getModuleCode(moduleCode)

  // Create a sandboxed JavaScript environment
  sandbox = createSandbox(moduleCode)

  // Inject configuration data into the sandbox
  sandbox.setConfig(configData)

  // Render the module within the display object container
  renderModule(sandbox)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Interactive Product Customization:** Users can design products (e.g., shoes, furniture) within the display object, with real-time pricing and visualization.
*   **AR/VR Previews:**  Users can virtually ‘place’ products in their homes using augmented reality.
*   **Loyalty Program Integration:**  Users can view their rewards balance, redeem points, and access exclusive offers.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:**  Merchants can display tailored product recommendations based on user preferences and purchase history.
*   **Gamified Experiences:** Merchants can integrate games or challenges into the display object to increase engagement.
