**Adaptive Acoustic Mapping & Projection System**

**Concept:** Extend the light-based operational feedback beyond simple indicators to create a dynamic, projected acoustic map around the device, visualizing sound sources and their interactions.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **High-Density Microphone Array:** A circular array of at least 64 microphones surrounding the existing microphone setup, providing 360-degree acoustic coverage.  Microphones must have a sampling rate of at least 96kHz.
    *   **Miniature Projectors (4 minimum):**  Low-profile, high-lumen projectors integrated into the housing, positioned to project onto the immediate surrounding surfaces (table, walls). Resolution: 1920x1080 minimum.
    *   **Dedicated Processing Unit:** A co-processor within the device solely dedicated to real-time acoustic analysis and projection rendering. Minimum RAM: 8GB.
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Integrated IMU to track device orientation and compensate for projection distortions.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Beamforming & Source Localization:** Implement advanced beamforming algorithms to pinpoint the direction and distance of sound sources.  Accuracy target:  Within 5 degrees of direction and 10cm of distance.
    *   **Acoustic Mapping:** Generate a 3D acoustic map of the surrounding environment, representing sound sources as glowing nodes.  Node size and intensity should correlate with sound amplitude and frequency.
    *   **Projection Rendering:** Render the acoustic map onto surrounding surfaces using the projectors.  The projection should dynamically adjust to the device's orientation (using IMU data) and the surrounding environment.
    *   **Adaptive Visualization:** Implement visualization modes:
        *   **Source Focus:** Highlight the dominant sound source (e.g., the user speaking).
        *   **Ambient Awareness:** Display all detected sound sources.
        *   **Directional Indication:** Project a 'beam' towards the detected sound source, visually indicating its direction.
        *   **Echo/Reflection Mapping:** Visually represent sound reflections off surfaces.
    *   **User Interaction:**
        *   **Gesture Control:** Utilize the acoustic map to detect user gestures (e.g., hand swipes) for controlling the device.
        *   **Voice Directionality:**  Display a visual 'focus' on the userâ€™s voice, allowing for more precise voice command recognition.
*   **Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    1. Capture audio data from microphone array.
    2. Perform beamforming & source localization to identify sound sources (direction, distance, amplitude).
    3. Construct 3D acoustic map (sound source positions, amplitudes).
    4. Read IMU data (device orientation).
    5. Transform acoustic map to device coordinates, accounting for orientation.
    6. Render acoustic map onto surrounding surfaces using projectors.
    7. Process user input (voice commands, gestures).
    8. Repeat.
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Enhanced Voice Assistant Interaction:  Visual feedback on voice command recognition.
    *   Spatial Audio Visualization:  Visual representation of sound sources for immersive audio experiences.
    *   Security & Surveillance:  Visualization of sound events for security monitoring.
    *   Accessibility:  Aiding individuals with hearing impairments by visually representing sound sources.
