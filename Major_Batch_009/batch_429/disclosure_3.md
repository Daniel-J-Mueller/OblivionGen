## Dynamic Grouping – Predictive Device State & Pre-emptive Grouping

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic grouping functionality to *predict* device states and proactively create/adjust groups *before* a state change is even registered, optimizing for low-latency control and anticipatory automation.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive State Engine (PSE):**

*   **Input:** Historical state data for each device (time-series data), environmental data (temperature, humidity, etc.), user behavioral patterns, and external event feeds (weather, traffic, etc.).
*   **Processing:** Employ machine learning models (Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to predict the *probability* of each device entering a specific state within a defined timeframe (e.g., a light turning on in the next 5 minutes).  Model training occurs continuously in the background, adapting to new data.
*   **Output:** A probabilistic state forecast for each device, expressed as a vector of probabilities for each possible state.

**2.  Pre-emptive Grouping Manager (PGM):**

*   **Input:** Probabilistic state forecasts from the PSE, existing group definitions, and desired automation rules.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Based on the probabilistic forecasts, the PGM calculates a “group readiness score” for each potential group. This score reflects the likelihood that enough devices will enter the required state to trigger the group’s intended action.
    *   If the group readiness score exceeds a defined threshold, the PGM *proactively* creates or adjusts the group membership *before* the devices actually change state. This involves adding devices predicted to transition to the target state.
    *   A “shadow group” concept is implemented. This shadow group is created before the real group. The real group is created upon confirmation of state changes.
*   **Output:** Dynamically adjusted group memberships, pre-emptive group creation, and alerts for potentially invalid predictions (requiring model re-training).

**3.  Group State Buffering:**

*   Maintain a buffer for each dynamic group. This buffer stores the *predicted* state of the group, rather than solely relying on the *current* state.
*   Actions can be triggered based on the buffered (predicted) state, enabling faster response times.  Actual state confirmation acts as a validation step.
*   A confidence level is associated with the buffered state. High-confidence predictions allow for immediate action, while low-confidence predictions trigger a confirmation delay.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// PSE - Predict Device State
function predictState(deviceId, historicalData, environmentalData, userBehavior):
  // Train ML model with provided data
  // Predict probability of each state
  return stateProbabilities // Vector of probabilities

// PGM - Manage Pre-emptive Groups
function manageGroups(deviceStates, groupDefinitions):
  for each group in groupDefinitions:
    groupReadinessScore = 0
    for each device in group:
      stateProbabilities = predictState(device.id, device.history, environment, user)
      groupReadinessScore += stateProbabilities[targetState]

    if groupReadinessScore > threshold:
      createShadowGroup(group) // add devices with high probability of transitioning

    // Upon confirmation of state changes (from Device Shadowing Service):
    if stateChangeConfirmed(device, targetState):
      activateGroup(group)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure for model training and prediction.
*   Scalable data storage for historical device data.
*   Real-time event processing pipeline for state change notifications.
*   Integration with existing Device Shadowing Service.
*   Machine Learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
