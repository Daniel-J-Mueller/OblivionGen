## Personalized Search Result "Echoes"

**Concept:** Extend the diversity mechanism by creating temporary, personalized "echoes" of a user’s search history *within* the current search results. This leverages implicit feedback to rapidly refine results beyond simple relevance scoring.

**Specs:**

1.  **Echo Profile Creation:** 
    *   Each user has a rolling "Echo Profile" – a dynamic representation of their recent search behavior (last 5-10 queries).
    *   Echo Profile stores not just keywords, but associated *attributes* – price range, brand preference, specific features (identified via NLP on search queries and click data).
    *   Profile decay: Older search data has progressively lower weight.
2.  **Echo Group Identification:**
    *   During a new search, identify a subset of initial results that *loosely* match attributes in the Echo Profile. (e.g., if the user recently searched for "noise-cancelling headphones under $200", identify results that fall within that price range, or are headphones).
    *   Create an "Echo Group" from this subset. The Echo Group is *not* limited to exact keyword matches.
3.  **Echo Boosting/Suppression:**
    *   Iteratively adjust relevance scores *within* the Echo Group.
        *   Results that strongly align with the Echo Profile receive a *boost* (increase in relevance).  The boost is *proportional* to the strength of the alignment.
        *   Results that *conflict* with the Echo Profile (e.g., a high-end headphone when the user has been searching for budget options) receive a *suppression* (decrease in relevance).
    *   Dynamic Adjustment: The magnitude of the boost/suppression is determined by the strength of the user’s recent behavior. A strong, consistent preference yields a larger adjustment.
4.  **Multi-Echo Layering:**
    *   The system can maintain multiple Echo Profiles, representing different facets of user interest (e.g., one for “work” searches, one for “personal entertainment”).
    *   These profiles can be combined to create a more nuanced set of boosts/suppressions.
5.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Clicks on boosted/suppressed results are weighted more heavily in updating the Echo Profile.
    *   Explicit user feedback (e.g., “Not interested” button) is used to rapidly adjust the profile.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function adjust_results(query, initial_results, user_id):
  echo_profile = get_user_echo_profile(user_id)
  echo_group = identify_echo_group(initial_results, echo_profile)

  for each result in echo_group:
    alignment_score = calculate_alignment_score(result, echo_profile)
    if alignment_score > threshold:
      result.relevance += alignment_score * boost_factor
    else:
      result.relevance -= (1 - alignment_score) * suppression_factor

  return sorted(results, by=relevance)
```

**Novelty:** This differs from existing diversity techniques by moving beyond static attribute diversification to a *dynamic, personalized* re-ranking based on real-time user behavior. It’s a form of proactive personalization, anticipating user needs based on their immediate search history.  This creates a ‘search echo’ - a personalized refinement of results which can significantly improve user experience.
