## Adaptive Cipher Suite Negotiation & Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Enhance TLS handshake negotiation by incorporating real-time behavioral analysis of the client to dynamically adjust cipher suite offerings *during* the handshake, rather than relying solely on pre-configured lists. This aims to detect and mitigate advanced MITM attacks exploiting subtle client vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

**Specification:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Function:**  Collects and analyzes client behavioral data during the initial stages of a TLS handshake. This includes:
    *   TLS Version Negotiation Speed: Time taken to agree on a TLS version.
    *   Extension Request Patterns: Frequency and order of TLS extension requests (e.g., Server Name Indication, Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation).
    *   Certificate Request Time:  Time elapsed between certificate request and response.
    *   Key Exchange Parameter Generation Time: Time taken for the client to generate key exchange parameters.
*   **Implementation:** A dedicated module integrated into the TLS stack of the network security service.
*   **Data Storage:** Transient storage for handshake-specific behavioral data. No persistent client profiling.

**2. Behavioral Anomaly Detection Engine:**

*   **Function:** Analyzes the collected behavioral data against a baseline established from "healthy" client connections.  Uses statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, percentile analysis) to identify anomalies.
*   **Implementation:** Rule-based engine combined with machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders) for anomaly detection.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Assigns an anomaly score based on the severity and number of detected anomalies.

**3. Dynamic Cipher Suite Adjustment Module:**

*   **Function:**  Modifies the cipher suite list presented to the client *during* the TLS handshake based on the anomaly score.
*   **Implementation:** Integrates with the TLS stack's cipher suite negotiation process.
*   **Adjustment Logic:**
    *   **Low Anomaly Score (0-30):**  Present the default cipher suite list.
    *   **Medium Anomaly Score (31-60):**  Prioritize stronger, more modern cipher suites (e.g., those utilizing Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and AEAD algorithms) and de-prioritize older, potentially vulnerable suites.
    *   **High Anomaly Score (61-100):**  Present a limited cipher suite list containing *only* the most secure and well-vetted options.  If no common cipher suites are found, the handshake is terminated.

**4.  Real-time Trust Score Calculation:**

*   **Function:**  Assigns a "Trust Score" to the client connection based on the anomaly score and the final negotiated cipher suite.
*   **Implementation:** Weighted average of the anomaly score (inverted) and a score based on the strength of the negotiated cipher suite.
*   **Output:** The Trust Score is logged and used for subsequent security decisions (e.g., adaptive authentication, traffic shaping).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function HandleTLSHandshake(clientConnection):
  behavioralData = CollectBehavioralData(clientConnection)
  anomalyScore = DetectAnomalies(behavioralData)
  adjustedCipherSuites = AdjustCipherSuites(anomalyScore)

  NegotiateCipherSuite(clientConnection, adjustedCipherSuites)

  trustScore = CalculateTrustScore(anomalyScore, NegotiatedCipherSuite)
  LogTrustScore(trustScore, clientConnection)

  return
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   **Performance:** The behavioral analysis and cipher suite adjustment must be performed with minimal latency to avoid impacting the user experience.
*   **False Positives:**  Careful tuning of the anomaly detection algorithms is crucial to minimize false positives.
*   **Compatibility:**  The system must be compatible with a wide range of clients and TLS versions.
*   **Scalability:**  The system must be able to handle a large volume of concurrent TLS handshakes.
