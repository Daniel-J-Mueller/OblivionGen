## Automated Sorting System - Textile Focus

**System Overview:** A robotic sorting system employing phased RFID arrays for high-speed, granular textile identification and segregation based on material composition, weave, and color. This expands beyond simple item identification to nuanced material characterization.

**Core Components:**

*   **RFID Phased Array:** Multiple, densely packed RFID antennas arranged in a planar array. Each antenna is independently phase-shifted and driven, allowing for beamforming and directional signal focusing. Operates at UHF or higher frequencies for improved resolution.
*   **Textile Tagging:** Textiles are pre-tagged with specialized RFID tags containing both unique identifiers and embedded micro-sensors that react to material composition (e.g., capacitance changes for different fibers).  Tags are designed for durability through wash/wear cycles.
*   **Material Response Database:** A comprehensive database correlating RFID tag sensor readings with specific textile properties (cotton, polyester, silk, wool, blends, weave patterns, dye compositions). Machine learning algorithms continuously refine this database.
*   **Robotic Manipulation System:**  A multi-armed robotic system capable of high-speed picking and placement of textiles. Integrated with computer vision for visual confirmation and fine adjustments.
*   **Conveyor Network:**  A network of high-speed conveyors directs textiles through the system and to designated sorting bins.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  Textiles enter the system on the conveyor belt.
2.  The RFID phased array scans the textile stream. The array uses beamforming to focus the RFID signal onto each item.
3.  The RFID tag's sensor data (capacitance, impedance) is transmitted to the central processing unit.
4.  The material response database is queried using the received data. The system identifies the textile's composition and weave pattern. Computer vision confirms the color and provides additional data to the process.
5.  The robotic arms pick up the identified textile.
6.  The robotic arm places the textile into the designated sorting bin based on the material classification.
7.  The system tracks the quantity of each material type in each bin.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Material Identification):**

```
// MaterialIdentification Function
FUNCTION MaterialIdentification(RFIDData, VisionData)
    // RFID Data: Data received from RFID tag sensor
    // VisionData: Data received from computer vision system

    // Query Material Response Database
    MaterialProperties = QueryDatabase(RFIDData)

    // If database query returns multiple matches
    IF (MaterialProperties.Count > 1) THEN
        // Refine match using computer vision data
        RefinedProperties = RefineMatch(MaterialProperties, VisionData)
    ELSE
        RefinedProperties = MaterialProperties
    ENDIF

    // Return identified material properties
    RETURN RefinedProperties
ENDFUNCTION

//RefineMatch function
FUNCTION RefineMatch(MaterialProperties, VisionData)
    //Analyze visual data for color, texture, weave patterns
    VisualAnalysis = AnalyzeVisualData(VisionData)

    //Score each material property based on visual analysis
    ScoredProperties = ScoreProperties(MaterialProperties, VisualAnalysis)

    //Select the highest-scoring material property
    BestMatch = SelectBestMatch(ScoredProperties)

    RETURN BestMatch
ENDFUNCTION

```
