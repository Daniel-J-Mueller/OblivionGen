## Dynamic Product Relationship Mapping & Predictive Categorization

**System Overview:**

This system builds on the concept of dynamic catalog accuracy assessment but pivots from *evaluating* existing classifications to *proactively predicting* optimal product relationships and categorizations *before* a user (or classification agent) needs to intervene. It leverages a graph database to model complex product relationships beyond simple categorization, and utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict future category assignments.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Product Graph Database:**
    *   **Nodes:** Each product in the catalog is a node.
    *   **Edges:** Edges represent relationships between products. Relationship types include:
        *   **Co-Purchase:**  Products frequently purchased together. (Weight: Purchase frequency)
        *   **Co-View:** Products frequently viewed together. (Weight: View frequency)
        *   **Attribute Similarity:** Similarity score based on product descriptions, features, and images. (Weight:  Similarity score – cosine similarity, perceptual hash comparison).
        *   **Derived Relationships:**  Edges automatically created by a knowledge graph (see component 4).
    *   Database: Neo4j or similar graph database.

2.  **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Category Predictor:**
    *   Input:  A sequence of product interactions (views, purchases, add-to-carts) for a given user. Also, feature vectors representing the product itself.
    *   Architecture: LSTM or GRU network.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over possible product categories.
    *   Training Data: Historical user interaction data (views, purchases, etc.).
    *   Purpose: Predict the *most likely* category for a product based on user behavior *and* the product's inherent features.

3.  **Category Drift Detection Module:**
    *   Monitors the RNN’s confidence scores for category assignments.  
    *   Triggers alerts when the confidence for a product in a category falls below a threshold, suggesting category drift.
    *   Algorithm:  Calculate a rolling average of confidence scores over time.  Significant deviations trigger alerts.

4.  **Knowledge Graph Integration:**
    *   Integrate a public or private knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, Google Knowledge Graph) to enrich product data.
    *   Use knowledge graph entities and relationships to *infer* new product relationships and connections.
    *   Example: If a product is identified as a "mountain bike" in the knowledge graph, automatically create relationships to products tagged as "bike helmets", "bike repair tools", or “bike trails”.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Real-time Data Ingestion:** Product views, purchases, and other interactions are ingested in real-time.
2.  **Graph Database Updates:**  The product graph is continuously updated with new interactions. Edge weights are adjusted based on frequency and recency.
3.  **RNN Prediction:** When a user views or interacts with a product, the RNN predicts the most likely category (and a confidence score).
4.  **Category Assignment/Suggestion:**
    *   If the RNN’s confidence is high, automatically assign the product to the predicted category.
    *   If the confidence is low, *suggest* the category to a human reviewer or classification agent.
5.  **Drift Detection:** The Category Drift Detection Module monitors category assignments and alerts when drift is detected.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** Human reviewers provide feedback on category assignments, which is used to retrain the RNN and improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (RNN Training):**

```python
# Input: Historical interaction data (user_id, product_id, event_type, timestamp)
#       Product features (description, images, attributes)

# 1. Preprocess data:
#    - Create sequences of product interactions for each user
#    - Encode product IDs and categories as integers
#    - Normalize product features

# 2. Define RNN model (LSTM or GRU):
#    - Embedding layer for product IDs
#    - LSTM/GRU layer(s)
#    - Dense layer(s) with softmax activation (output = probability distribution over categories)

# 3. Compile model:
#    - Optimizer: Adam
#    - Loss function: Categorical cross-entropy
#    - Metrics: Accuracy

# 4. Train model:
#    - Split data into training and validation sets
#    - Train model on training data
#    - Evaluate model on validation data
#    - Adjust hyperparameters as needed

# 5. Save trained model
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability: The system must be able to handle a large and growing catalog of products.
*   Real-time Processing:  Data ingestion and prediction must be done in real-time.
*   Data Security:  User data must be protected.
*   Model Monitoring:  The RNN model must be monitored for drift and retrained as needed.
