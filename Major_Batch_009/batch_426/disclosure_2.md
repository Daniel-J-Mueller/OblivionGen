## Dynamic Trust Scoring Based on Network & Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the existing network metadata integration to create a dynamic trust score for computing resources, influencing access control decisions in real-time. This isn't just about *where* a request originates, but *how* it's behaving.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Collection Module:**

*   **Network Metadata:** Capture (as per the base patent) virtual private network (VPC) identifiers, IP addresses, and potentially geolocation data from both the temporary credentials *and* network headers.
*   **Behavioral Analytics:** Monitor request patterns:
    *   **Request Rate:** Requests per second, minute, hour.
    *   **Resource Access Patterns:**  Types of resources accessed (databases, storage, compute instances).  Deviation from baseline behavior.
    *   **Data Exfiltration Detection:**  Monitor outbound data transfer sizes and destinations.
    *   **API Call Sequences:** Track the order of API calls for anomalous sequences.
*   **Telemetry Integration:** Integrate with existing logging and monitoring systems.
*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database optimized for fast queries and anomaly detection.

**2. Trust Score Engine:**

*   **Weighted Scoring:** Assign weights to different factors:
    *   Network Metadata (VPC match, known good/bad VPCs): 30%
    *   Request Rate: 20%
    *   Resource Access Patterns: 25%
    *   Data Exfiltration Detection: 15%
    *   API Call Sequences: 10%
*   **Baseline Establishment:**  Automatically learn "normal" behavior for each resource/user.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Utilize statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, moving averages, machine learning models) to identify deviations from the baseline.
*   **Real-time Score Calculation:** Continuously update the trust score based on incoming data.
*   **Score Decay:** Implement a decay mechanism to reduce the impact of old data.

**3. Policy Enforcement Module:**

*   **Dynamic Policy Rules:**  Allow policies to be defined based on trust score ranges:
    *   `Trust Score > 90`: Allow full access.
    *   `70 < Trust Score < 90`: Require multi-factor authentication.
    *   `50 < Trust Score < 70`: Limit access to specific resources.
    *   `Trust Score < 50`: Deny access.
*   **Adaptive Policies:** Automatically adjust policy rules based on evolving threat landscape.
*   **Integration with IAM:** Seamlessly integrate with existing Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems.
*   **Policy Visualization:**  Provide a user-friendly interface to visualize and manage dynamic policy rules.

**Pseudocode (Policy Enforcement):**

```
function authorize_request(request, session_token, header_info):
  trust_score = calculate_trust_score(request, session_token, header_info)

  if trust_score > 90:
    return ALLOW
  else if trust_score > 70:
    if require_mfa(request):
      return ALLOW_WITH_MFA
    else:
      return DENY
  else if trust_score > 50:
    allowed_resources = get_allowed_resources_for_trust_score(trust_score)
    if request.resource in allowed_resources:
      return ALLOW
    else:
      return DENY
  else:
    return DENY
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply verifying network origin. It introduces behavioral analysis and dynamic trust scoring, enabling a more adaptive and robust security posture. The system learns and reacts to changes in behavior, providing a proactive defense against malicious activity.  It allows for fine-grained access control based on real-time risk assessment.
