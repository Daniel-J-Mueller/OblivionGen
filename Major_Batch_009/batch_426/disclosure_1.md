## Scanner-Integrated Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Augment the scanner with localized haptic feedback to provide real-time textural information about the scanned object *during* the scanning process, and as a post-scan exploratory tool.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Integrate an array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar) into the scanner’s surface – the area that makes contact with the scanned object. Density: 50 actuators per square centimeter minimum.  Actuator range: 0-5mm displacement.
*   **Scanning Synchronization:**  Software module to synchronize scanner data acquisition with haptic actuator control.
*   **Data Mapping:** Algorithm to map scanned surface geometry/texture data to actuator displacement.  Consider:
    *   Depth = Actuator Height
    *   Material Density (estimated from reflectance data) = Actuator Vibration Frequency/Intensity
    *   Edge Detection = Sharp, localized actuator 'clicks'
*   **Force Feedback Control:** Implement adjustable force feedback limits to prevent actuator damage or user discomfort. Max force: 5N per actuator.
*   **User Interface:** GUI to allow user control over:
    *   Haptic intensity (global and per-feature)
    *   Haptic mode (real-time scan, post-scan exploration, blend)
    *   Actuator array mapping customization
*   **Materials:** Scanner surface material must be biocompatible and easily sanitized. Consider silicone or a similar soft polymer.
*   **Power:** Dedicated power supply for actuators. Estimate: 5W peak, 1W average.
*   **Communication:**  USB-C interface for data transfer and power.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Control Loop):**

```
while (scanning) {
    scanData = scanner.getScanData();
    surfaceGeometry = scanData.geometry;
    materialData = scanData.material;

    for (each actuator in actuatorArray) {
        //Determine corresponding point on scanned surface
        surfacePoint = mapActuatorToSurface(actuator);

        //Calculate height based on surface geometry
        height = surfaceGeometry[surfacePoint.x, surfacePoint.y];

        //Estimate vibration frequency/intensity based on material
        vibration = materialData[surfacePoint.x, surfacePoint.y];

        //Send control signal to actuator
        actuator.setHeight(height);
        actuator.setVibration(vibration);
    }
}

// Post-scan exploration mode - similar loop, but uses saved scan data
```

**Innovation:** Existing scanners provide visual/digital representations of physical objects. This adds a tactile dimension, enabling users to ‘feel’ the scanned object in real-time or during post-processing. Potential applications: art restoration, medical imaging, quality control, accessibility for the visually impaired.
