## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** The patent details focus on disabling echo cancellation during wake word detection. This sparks the idea of *actively composing* the acoustic scene presented to the echo cancellation algorithm, not just temporarily disabling it. Instead of simply preventing echoes from being *cancelled*, we proactively shape the audio environment *before* it reaches the echo cancellation stage.

**Specification:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Minimum of 4 microphones. Placement to maximize spatial diversity.
*   **Beamforming DSP:** Dedicated Digital Signal Processing unit capable of real-time beamforming and spatial audio manipulation.
*   **Ambient Sound Sensor:**  A wide-band sensor to analyze overall ambient noise levels.
*   **Programmable Gain Amplifiers (PGAs):**  Individual PGAs for each microphone channel.
*   **High-Speed ADC/DAC:** Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters for signal processing.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Analyzer:** Real-time analysis of incoming audio to identify dominant sound sources (speech, music, background noise). Utilizes machine learning models trained on diverse acoustic datasets.
*   **Spatial Audio Composer:** Module responsible for manipulating the audio from individual microphones.
    *   **Beamforming Control:** Dynamically adjusts beamforming weights to emphasize or suppress specific sound sources.
    *   **Spatial Augmentation:** Applies subtle spatial effects (e.g., slight panning, reverb) to create a perceived acoustic environment.  The goal isnâ€™t to *create* sound, but to sculpt the existing sound to minimize echo artifacts.
    *   **Noise Shaping:** Utilizes advanced signal processing techniques to reduce the impact of ambient noise on the echo cancellation process.
*   **Echo Cancellation Interface:**  Standard interface for integration with existing echo cancellation algorithms. Provides the sculpted audio stream as input.
*   **Metadata Generator:** Generates metadata related to the acoustic scene, including dominant sound sources, ambient noise levels, and applied spatial effects. This metadata can be used for contextual awareness and improved algorithm performance.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (audio_available) {

  // 1. Capture Audio from Multi-Microphone Array
  audio_data = capture_audio();

  // 2. Analyze Acoustic Scene
  scene_analysis = analyze_scene(audio_data);

  // 3. Sculpt Acoustic Scene
  sculpted_audio = sculpt_scene(audio_data, scene_analysis);

  // 4. Send Sculpted Audio to Echo Cancellation
  echo_cancellation_input = sculpted_audio;

  // 5. Generate Metadata
  metadata = generate_metadata(scene_analysis);
}

// Function: sculpt_scene
function sculpt_scene(audio_data, scene_analysis) {

  // Identify dominant sound sources
  dominant_source = scene_analysis.dominant_source;

  // Adjust beamforming weights
  beamforming_weights = calculate_beamforming_weights(dominant_source);
  beamformed_audio = apply_beamforming(audio_data, beamforming_weights);

  // Apply spatial augmentation (subtle panning, reverb)
  augmented_audio = apply_spatial_augmentation(beamformed_audio);

  return augmented_audio;
}
```

**4. Innovation Summary:**

This system moves beyond simply *reacting* to echoes to proactively *shaping* the acoustic environment. By intelligently manipulating the audio stream *before* it reaches the echo cancellation stage, we can reduce the workload on the echo cancellation algorithm and improve its performance. Subtle spatial augmentation and beamforming can create a perceived acoustic environment that minimizes echo artifacts, resulting in a more natural and clear audio experience. The system allows for creation of a 'virtual acoustic space' which will influence how the echo cancellation system operates. The key is *subtlety*. We aren't attempting to reconstruct the audio, just nudge the system toward more favorable conditions.
