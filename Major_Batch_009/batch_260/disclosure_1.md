**Adaptive Network ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Resource Allocation**

**Concept:** Extend the multi-path routing concept to create dynamically mirrored ‘shadow’ networks. These shadows operate in parallel with primary paths, constantly learning and predicting potential congestion or failure points *before* they impact primary traffic. Resource allocation anticipates these issues, pre-provisioning capacity on shadowed paths.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadow Network Creation:**
    *   Upon establishment of a primary multi-path connection (as per the patent), automatically generate a ‘shadow’ network mirroring the topology. This shadow network utilizes different, but equivalent, physical paths where possible.
    *   Shadow network nodes are provisioned with minimal initial capacity (e.g., 10% of primary path capacity).

2.  **Proactive Monitoring & Prediction:**
    *   Implement lightweight ‘probe’ traffic across both primary and shadow networks. These probes are designed to measure latency, packet loss, and bandwidth availability.
    *   Employ a predictive algorithm (e.g., LSTM neural network) trained on historical network data and real-time probe results. The algorithm forecasts potential congestion points or path failures within a defined time horizon (e.g., 5-15 seconds).
    *   Feature set for prediction: Latency trends, packet loss rates, bandwidth utilization, time of day, day of week, event schedules (if available), historical failure patterns.

3.  **Dynamic Resource Allocation:**
    *   Based on the predictive algorithm’s output, dynamically allocate additional network resources to shadowed paths *before* congestion occurs on primary paths.
    *   Resource allocation is granular, scaling up bandwidth and compute capacity on shadow nodes as needed.
    *   Resource allocation strategy: prioritize shadowed paths predicted to alleviate immediate congestion; diversify allocation across multiple shadowed paths for redundancy.

4.  **Traffic Steering & Failover:**
    *   When congestion is detected on a primary path, or a failure is predicted with high confidence, seamlessly redirect a portion of the traffic to the pre-provisioned shadowed path.
    *   Traffic steering utilizes a weighted distribution, balancing load between primary and shadow paths.
    *   Implement a ‘rollback’ mechanism: if congestion on the shadowed path increases unexpectedly, revert traffic back to the primary path.

5.  **Feedback Loop & Learning:**
    *   Continuously monitor the performance of both primary and shadowed paths.
    *   Use this data to refine the predictive algorithm and optimize resource allocation strategies.
    *   Implement a ‘cost’ function that penalizes unnecessary resource allocation and rewards effective congestion avoidance.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation):**

```
function allocateResources(predictedCongestion, shadowPaths):
  for each path in shadowPaths:
    congestionScore = calculateCongestionScore(predictedCongestion, path)
    requiredBandwidth = calculateRequiredBandwidth(congestionScore)
    currentBandwidth = getBandwidth(path)
    additionalBandwidth = max(0, requiredBandwidth - currentBandwidth)
    allocateBandwidth(path, additionalBandwidth)
  end for
end function

function calculateCongestionScore(predictedCongestion, path):
  // Implement logic to calculate a congestion score based on
  // predicted congestion levels, path characteristics (e.g., latency,
  // bandwidth), and historical performance.
  return score
end function

function calculateRequiredBandwidth(congestionScore):
  // Implement logic to determine the required bandwidth based on the
  // congestion score.  Higher scores indicate greater bandwidth needs.
  return bandwidth
end function
```
