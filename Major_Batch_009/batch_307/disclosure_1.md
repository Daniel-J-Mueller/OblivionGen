**Autonomous Network Behavior Anomaly Detection & Remediation System**

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of validating IP address assignments but shifts the focus from simple verification to proactive anomaly detection and automated remediation. Instead of solely confirming *if* an IP address is used as intended, it learns normal network behavior for each assigned IP address and automatically mitigates deviations.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Baseline Engine:**
    *   Monitors network traffic associated with each IP address (source/destination, ports, protocols, data volume, frequency).
    *   Employs machine learning (specifically, time-series anomaly detection algorithms – e.g., LSTM autoencoders, Prophet) to establish a baseline of “normal” behavior for each IP. The baseline is dynamic and adapts to evolving usage patterns.
    *   Stores baselines as probabilistic models – representing the expected range of values for each monitored metric.

2.  **Anomaly Detection Module:**
    *   Continuously compares real-time network traffic data against the established baselines.
    *   Calculates anomaly scores based on deviations from expected behavior. Anomaly scores incorporate both the magnitude and duration of the deviation.
    *   Triggers alerts when anomaly scores exceed pre-defined thresholds. These thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on the criticality of the IP address and the type of anomaly detected.

3.  **Automated Remediation Engine:**
    *   Executes pre-defined remediation actions based on the type and severity of the detected anomaly. Remediation actions can include:
        *   **Rate limiting:** Reducing the traffic volume from the anomalous IP address.
        *   **Traffic redirection:** Redirecting traffic to a scrubbing center or a more resilient endpoint.
        *   **Connection termination:** Blocking malicious connections.
        *   **IP address isolation:** Temporarily isolating the IP address from the network.
        *   **Dynamic firewall rule updates:** Adjusting firewall rules to block suspicious traffic patterns.
    *   Remediation actions are executed automatically, minimizing downtime and reducing the impact of attacks.

4.  **Centralized Management Console:**
    *   Provides a graphical interface for monitoring network behavior, configuring anomaly detection rules, defining remediation actions, and viewing historical data.
    *   Allows administrators to investigate anomalies, tune the system, and manage the overall network security posture.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection & Remediation):**

```
// For each IP Address assigned:
    // Collect network traffic data (source/destination, ports, protocols, volume, frequency)
    // Apply machine learning model to determine expected range of values for each metric
    // Monitor real-time network traffic data
    // Calculate anomaly score:
        // Deviation from expected range for each metric
        // Combine deviations using weighted average
    // If anomaly score > threshold:
        // Determine type of anomaly (e.g., DDoS, port scan, data exfiltration)
        // Select appropriate remediation action
        // Execute remediation action automatically
        // Log event for auditing and analysis
    // Update baseline model periodically to adapt to evolving network behavior
```

**Data Stores:**

*   **IP Address Assignment Database:** Stores associations between IP addresses and their intended uses, similar to the original patent.
*   **Baseline Model Repository:** Stores the machine learning models that represent the normal network behavior for each IP address.
*   **Event Log:** Stores all detected anomalies, remediation actions, and system events.

**Novelty & Differentiation:**

This system moves beyond simple validation to provide proactive anomaly detection and automated remediation, enhancing network security and reducing the impact of attacks. The use of machine learning to establish dynamic baselines of normal behavior allows the system to adapt to evolving network patterns and detect even subtle anomalies. The automated remediation engine minimizes downtime and reduces the need for manual intervention.
