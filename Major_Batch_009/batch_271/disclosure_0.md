## Dynamic Spectral Shaping for Interference Mitigation

**Concept:** Expand upon the dynamic gain control concept to actively *shape* the frequency response of the receiver based on detected interference. Instead of just amplifying/compressing across the board, introduce a programmable filter bank controlled by the AGC circuitry. This allows for selective attenuation of interfering signals while enhancing the desired signal.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **AGC Core:** Existing AGC circuitry repurposed as the control logic.
    *   **Programmable Filter Bank:** A digitally-controlled filter bank (e.g., Finite Impulse Response (FIR) or Finite Impulse Response (IIR) filters) integrated after the LNA and before the RF detector. Minimum 16 channels, bandwidth configurable from 1 MHz to 20 MHz.  Each channel must have independent gain control (0-20 dB) and programmable center frequency.
    *   **Interference Detection Module:** A real-time spectrum analyzer (RTSA) integrated within the FEM, capable of monitoring RF spectrum up to 20 MHz bandwidth with 1 kHz resolution.
    *   **Microcontroller:** Dedicated microcontroller to handle interference detection, filter bank programming, and AGC coordination.
    *   **RF Switch Matrix:**  A switch matrix allowing the RF signal to be routed to the RTSA for analysis, and then to the filter bank for processing.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Interference Mapping:**  RTSA sweeps the RF spectrum and identifies dominant interference sources (frequency, amplitude).
    *   **Notch Filter Generation:** Algorithm dynamically creates notch filters (or band-stop filters) centered on identified interference frequencies.  Filter bandwidth is adaptive based on the interference signal's bandwidth.
    *   **Dynamic Filter Programming:** The microcontroller programs the filter bank with the generated notch filters and adjusts channel gains to maximize desired signal strength while minimizing interference.
    *   **AGC Integration:** The AGC circuitry monitors the output signal strength *after* the filter bank.  It adjusts the overall gain based on both the desired signal strength and the level of remaining interference. This creates a feedback loop.
    *   **Learning Algorithm (Optional):** Implement a machine learning algorithm to predict interference patterns based on time of day, location, and historical data. This would allow for proactive filtering and reduced latency.
    *   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Spectrum Analysis
    spectrum = analyzeSpectrum();

    // 2. Interference Detection
    interferenceFrequencies = detectInterference(spectrum);

    // 3. Filter Generation
    filters = generateFilters(interferenceFrequencies);

    // 4. Filter Bank Programming
    programFilterBank(filters);

    // 5. AGC Adjustment
    signalStrength = measureSignalStrength();
    agcGain = adjustGain(signalStrength);

    // 6. Sleep/Wait (reduce processing load)
    delay(1ms);
}

// Function: analyzeSpectrum()
// Returns: Spectrum data (frequency vs. amplitude)
Spectrum analyzeSpectrum() {
    // Utilize RTSA to scan frequency range
    // Process raw data for amplitude and frequency
    return spectrumData;
}

// Function: detectInterference(spectrum)
// Returns: List of interference frequencies
List<Frequency> detectInterference(Spectrum spectrum) {
    // Algorithm to identify peaks in spectrum exceeding a threshold
    // Filter out known signals (e.g., from the same device)
    return interferenceFrequencies;
}

// Function: generateFilters(interferenceFrequencies)
// Returns: Filter parameters (center frequency, bandwidth, gain)
Filter[] generateFilters(List<Frequency> interferenceFrequencies) {
    Filter[] filters = new Filter[interferenceFrequencies.size()];
    for (int i = 0; i < interferenceFrequencies.size(); i++) {
        filters[i] = new Filter(interferenceFrequencies[i].frequency, adaptiveBandwidth(interferenceFrequencies[i].amplitude), -20dB); // Example: create notch filter
    }
    return filters;
}
```

*   **Potential Benefits:**  Significantly improved receiver sensitivity in noisy environments.  Enhanced performance in crowded spectrums (e.g., 2.4 GHz WiFi).  Reduced need for manual channel selection.
*   **Considerations:**  Increased hardware complexity.  Algorithm development for accurate interference detection and filter generation.  Power consumption.  Latency.
