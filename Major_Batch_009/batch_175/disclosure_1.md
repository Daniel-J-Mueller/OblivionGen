## Dynamic Network Persona for API Access

**System Specification:** A system leveraging ephemeral, dynamically generated network personas tied to client devices for API authentication and authorization. 

**Core Concept:** Instead of relying solely on proximity (TTL, latency), the system establishes a temporary "network persona" for each client – a set of defined network characteristics (source IP range, routing preferences, allowed ports) – and enforces API access based on adherence to that persona. 

**Components:**

*   **Persona Generator:** A service that, upon initial client connection/authentication (e.g., standard username/password, MFA), generates a unique network persona. This persona definition includes:
    *   `AllowedSourceIPs`: A limited range of IPs the client is permitted to originate requests from. (e.g. 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.20)
    *   `RoutingPreference`: Defines a preferred network path/gateway for API requests. (e.g. via a specific VPN tunnel or network segment)
    *   `AllowedPorts`: A restricted set of ports for outbound API traffic.
    *   `TTLProfile`: A defined pattern of TTL values the client *should* exhibit for various API endpoints.
    *   `PersonaExpiration`:  A time limit for the persona’s validity.

*   **Persona Orchestrator:**  Responsible for configuring network infrastructure (firewalls, routers, VPN servers) to enforce the persona. This could involve dynamically updating firewall rules, VPN configurations, or routing tables.

*   **API Gateway/Authentication Service:**  Intercepts API requests and validates them against the established persona. This validation includes:
    *   Source IP address check against `AllowedSourceIPs`.
    *   Verification that the request is routed via the `RoutingPreference`.
    *   Port check against `AllowedPorts`.
    *   TTL value check against the `TTLProfile` – requests with unexpected TTL values are flagged.

**Workflow:**

1.  Client initiates connection and authenticates via standard means.
2.  Persona Generator creates a unique network persona.
3.  Persona Orchestrator configures network infrastructure to enforce the persona.
4.  Client sends API requests.
5.  API Gateway validates requests against the established persona. 
    *   If the request adheres to the persona, it is passed through.
    *   If the request deviates from the persona, it is flagged, logged, and potentially blocked.
6.  After the `PersonaExpiration` timer is reached, the persona is revoked, and the process restarts.

**Pseudocode (API Gateway Validation):**

```
function validateRequest(request):
    persona = getPersona(request.clientId)
    if persona is null:
        return false // No persona found

    if not ipAddressInList(request.sourceIP, persona.AllowedSourceIPs):
        log("Invalid Source IP")
        return false

    if request.routingPath != persona.RoutingPreference:
        log("Invalid Routing Path")
        return false

    if request.sourcePort not in persona.AllowedPorts:
        log("Invalid Source Port")
        return false
    
    if request.ttlValue not in persona.TTLProfile:
        log("Invalid TTL Value")
        return false

    return true // Request is valid
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple proximity checks to create a dynamic, multi-faceted network identity for each client.  It adds a layer of “network camouflage” making it harder for attackers to spoof or intercept legitimate API requests.  The system’s dynamic nature creates a moving target, reducing the effectiveness of static security rules. It is designed to augment, not replace, existing authentication mechanisms.
