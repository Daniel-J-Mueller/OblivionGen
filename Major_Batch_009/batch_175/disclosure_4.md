## Project: Bio-Acoustic Projector Calibration & User Profiling

**Core Concept:** Leverage subtle physiological audio cues (beyond simple voice/breathing detection) to dynamically calibrate projector display parameters *and* build a user profile for personalized viewing experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-sensitivity microphone array (minimum 8 elements) integrated into projector housing.  Emphasis on capturing subtle vibrations and high-frequency sounds.
    *   Near-field infrared (NIR) sensor array to capture subtle skin temperature variations and micro-muscle movements. (Optional, adds data for user profiling).
    *   Dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) for real-time audio and sensor data processing.  Must support advanced signal decomposition algorithms.
    *   High-bandwidth communication link to projectorâ€™s image processing unit.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Bio-Acoustic Signal Acquisition:** Continuously monitor microphone array for sounds *beyond* speech/breathing. Focus on heart rate variability (HRV), subtle muscle tremors, and even minor physiological resonances.
    *   **Signal Decomposition & Feature Extraction:** Employ Wavelet Transform, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and other advanced techniques to isolate relevant physiological signals from background noise.  Extract key features (frequency components, amplitude variations, temporal patterns).
    *   **Calibration Algorithm:**
        *   **Dynamic Brightness Adjustment:** Correlate HRV (indicative of arousal/focus) with projector brightness.  Lower brightness during low arousal (e.g., relaxation) and increase during high arousal (e.g., action scenes).
        *   **Color Temperature Compensation:** Correlate subtle muscle tremors (related to eye strain) with color temperature. Shift towards warmer tones to reduce strain.
        *   **Keystone Correction Refinement:** Analyze subtle head movements (detected via audio localization and/or optional NIR) to *dynamically* refine keystone correction for optimal image geometry, even during slight user shifts.
    *   **User Profile Creation:**
        *   Store physiological baseline data (average HRV, muscle tension, etc.) for each identified user.
        *   Develop a "comfort map" based on user preferences (e.g., brightness levels, color temperature settings).
        *   Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences based on physiological signals.
    *   **Audio-Visual Synchronization:**  Implement an algorithm to subtly adjust audio levels and equalization based on user's physiological responses.  (e.g. increase bass during high arousal).
*   **Pseudocode (Calibration Loop):**

```
WHILE (projector is ON) {

  // Acquire physiological data
  audio_data = get_audio_data();
  // Optional: ir_data = get_ir_data();

  // Process audio data
  hrv = calculate_hrv(audio_data);
  muscle_tension = calculate_muscle_tension(audio_data);
  // Optional: head_position = calculate_head_position(ir_data);

  // Adjust projector parameters
  brightness = map(hrv, min_hrv, max_hrv, min_brightness, max_brightness);
  color_temp = map(muscle_tension, min_tension, max_tension, warm_temp, cool_temp);
  // Optional: keystone = refine_keystone(head_position);

  set_brightness(brightness);
  set_color_temp(color_temp);
  // Optional: set_keystone(keystone);
}
```

**Innovation Notes:**  This goes beyond simple proximity detection and leverages physiological data to *actively* personalize the viewing experience. The system dynamically adapts to the user's state, minimizing strain, maximizing immersion, and creating a truly customized display.  The data can also be used for broader health and wellness applications (e.g., stress monitoring).
