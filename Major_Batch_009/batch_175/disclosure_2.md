## Dynamic Scene Graph Composition for Interactive Narrative Generation

**Core Concept:** Extend the scene similarity learning to enable *dynamic composition* of scenes from different videos to construct novel narrative sequences, driven by user input and AI-directed branching.  The existing patent focuses on *finding* similar scenes; this builds upon it to *create* new sequences.

**Specs:**

*   **Scene Graph Database:** Construct a database representing videos as interconnected scene graphs. Nodes represent individual scenes (or even shots). Edges represent relationships derived from the learned scene embeddings – similarity, causal connection (e.g., a character moving from Scene A to Scene B), emotional transition (e.g., a scene shifting from happy to sad).  Edge weights are dynamically adjusted based on user feedback/AI objectives.

*   **User Input Interface:**  A system allowing users to define high-level narrative goals (e.g., "create a suspenseful chase sequence," "show a character overcoming adversity"). This input is translated into constraints on the scene graph traversal.

*   **AI Director Module:**  An AI module responsible for guiding the scene graph traversal to fulfill the user’s narrative goal. This involves:
    *   **Goal Decomposition:** Breaking down the high-level goal into a sequence of micro-goals (e.g., "establish the pursuer," "show the character fleeing," "introduce an obstacle").
    *   **Scene Selection:**  Using the learned scene embeddings and graph structure to identify scenes that best satisfy each micro-goal.  Consider both semantic similarity *and* narrative function.
    *   **Transition Generation:**  Creating smooth transitions between selected scenes, even if they originate from different videos.  This could involve blending visual elements, generating connecting dialogue, or adding transitional scenes (e.g., brief establishing shots).

*   **Scene Blending Engine:** A module responsible for visually blending disparate scenes.  This includes:
    *   **Camera Matching:** Dynamically adjust camera angles and movement to create a consistent visual flow.
    *   **Color and Lighting Correction:** Adjust color palettes and lighting to match the blended scenes.
    *   **Object Insertion/Removal:** Add or remove objects to create a seamless visual experience.

*   **Narrative Feedback Loop:**  A system for collecting user feedback on the generated narrative.  This feedback is used to refine the scene graph, update the learned embeddings, and improve the AI Director’s decision-making process.

**Pseudocode (AI Director – Scene Selection):**

```pseudocode
function select_scene(current_goal, scene_graph, learned_embeddings):
  // Filter scenes based on current goal keywords/semantic similarity
  candidate_scenes = filter_scenes(scene_graph, current_goal, learned_embeddings)

  // Score scenes based on narrative function (e.g., does it advance the plot?)
  scored_scenes = score_scenes(candidate_scenes, current_goal)

  // Prioritize scenes based on user preferences (if available)
  prioritized_scenes = prioritize_scenes(scored_scenes, user_preferences)

  // Select the highest-scoring scene
  selected_scene = prioritized_scenes[0]

  return selected_scene
```

**Novelty:**

This concept moves beyond static scene similarity to *proactive narrative construction*. The existing patent enables understanding similarity; this enables *creation* via a dynamic, interactive system. It's not just about finding similar scenes, but about building entirely new stories from existing video content.
