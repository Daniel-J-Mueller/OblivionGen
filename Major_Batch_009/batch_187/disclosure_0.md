## Adaptive Session Key Rotation with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the existing session affinity mechanism by introducing dynamic session key rotation tied to predicted load balancer capacity and preemptive key exchange. This aims to enhance security, reduce reliance on consistent hashing for *all* traffic, and improve responsiveness under fluctuating load.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Rotation Engine (KRE):**

*   **Function:** Manages session key lifecycle – generation, distribution, rotation, revocation.  Operates on the client-side (within the application/browser) and server-side (load balancer/backend).
*   **Rotation Trigger:**  Time-based, load-based (predicted capacity approaching threshold), or security-based (compromise suspicion).
*   **Rotation Frequency:** Configurable, dynamically adjusted by a central policy manager.  Initial rotation frequency set at session creation.
*   **Key Exchange Protocol:**  Employ a Diffie-Hellman variant for establishing new session keys without transmitting the key itself. Keys are encrypted using a publicly known asymmetric key tied to the load balancer cluster.
*   **Key Material:** Utilize a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) for key generation.

**2. Predictive Load Balancing (PLB):**

*   **Data Sources:** Historical traffic patterns, real-time server load (CPU, memory, network I/O), application-level metrics (request latency, error rates), anticipated events (scheduled maintenance, marketing campaigns).
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Employ a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, recurrent neural network) to predict load balancer capacity requirements for the next *n* minutes.
*   **Proactive Key Distribution:** Based on the predicted load, PLB proactively distributes new session keys to the *anticipated* load balancer(s) *before* the actual traffic arrives. This minimizes latency during session handoff.

**3. Client-Side Integration:**

*   **KRE Module:**  Integrated into the client application/browser.
*   **Key Request:** During session initialization or rotation, the client requests a new session key from a key server (hosted within the load balancer cluster).
*   **Key Storage:** Session keys are stored securely on the client-side (e.g., using browser storage APIs, secure enclaves).
*   **Key Transmission:**  The client includes the current session key (encrypted if necessary) in each request.

**4. Load Balancer Integration:**

*   **Key Server:** Dedicated component within the load balancer cluster responsible for key generation, storage, and distribution.
*   **Key Validation:**  Load balancer validates the incoming session key before forwarding the request to the backend server.
*   **Handoff Logic:** If a session handoff is required (due to load balancing or server failure), the load balancer retrieves the session key from its cache and forwards the request to the new backend server.  The original backend server is notified of the handoff.
*   **Cache Invalidation:**  Upon server failure or session termination, the corresponding session key is invalidated from the load balancer cache.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side – Key Rotation):**

```
function requestNewSessionKey() {
  // Generate Diffie-Hellman parameters
  dhParams = generateDHParams();

  // Send DH public key to key server
  response = sendRequestToKeyServer(dhParams);

  // Extract symmetric session key from response
  newSessionKey = extractSessionKey(response);

  // Update current session key
  currentSessionKey = newSessionKey;

  // Encrypt currentSessionKey with public key of the Load Balancer
  encryptedSessionKey = encrypt(currentSessionKey, loadBalancerPublicKey);

  return encryptedSessionKey;
}

function sendRequest(data, sessionKey) {
  // Encrypt data with sessionKey
  encryptedData = encrypt(data, sessionKey);
  // Add header containing encrypted session key
  request.addHeader("SessionKey", encryptedSessionKey);
  // Send request
}
```

**Pseudocode (Load Balancer – Session Handoff):**

```
function handleRequest(request) {
  encryptedSessionKey = request.getHeader("SessionKey");
  sessionKey = decrypt(encryptedSessionKey, privateKey);
  // Validate session key (e.g., check timestamp, revocation list)

  // Select backend server using consistent hashing (initial selection)
  backendServer = selectBackendServer(request, consistentHashKey);

  // Forward request to backend server
  forwardRequest(backendServer, request);
}
```

**Novelty:**  This system departs from the static key usage of the original patent by dynamically rotating keys and proactively distributing them based on predictive load balancing. This enhances security, improves responsiveness under fluctuating load, and reduces reliance on consistent hashing for *all* traffic, allowing for greater flexibility in load balancing strategies.  It's a shift from reactive session affinity to *proactive* session management.
