## Dynamic Kernel Shadowing with Hardware-Assisted Integrity Verification

**Concept:** Extend the signature-based modification detection to create a continuously updated, hardware-verified “shadow” copy of critical kernel data structures. This shadow copy isn't a full backup, but a minimal representation sufficient for integrity checks and rollback.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Component:** Dedicated hardware unit (e.g., integrated within the Memory Management Unit or a security enclave) responsible for maintaining the shadow copy. This unit operates transparently to the kernel.
*   **Shadow Data Structures:**  Identification of *critical* kernel data structures (e.g., process control blocks, memory allocation tables, interrupt handling vectors).  These structures will be mirrored, but only at a defined granularity (e.g., individual fields instead of entire structures). The granularity is configurable and determined at system initialization.
*   **Signature Generation & Storage:** The existing signature generation mechanism (from the patent) is employed to compute a signature for each shadowed field *before* any modification.  This signature is stored in the dedicated hardware unit, alongside the original value.
*   **Write Interception & Shadow Update:**  All writes to shadowed fields are intercepted (potentially through memory protection mechanisms). Before the write completes:
    1.  The current value of the field is captured.
    2.  A new signature is generated for the *new* value.
    3.  The new value is written to the kernel.
    4.  The hardware unit updates its shadow copy with the new value and the new signature.
*   **Integrity Verification:**  At configurable intervals (or upon system call entry/exit, interrupt handling), the hardware unit compares the current value of a shadowed field in kernel memory to the corresponding value in its shadow copy. If a mismatch is detected:
    1.  The hardware unit signals an integrity violation.
    2.  The system can take pre-defined actions (e.g., logging, system halt, rollback to the last known good state).  Rollback would involve restoring the shadowed value to kernel memory.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** The hardware unit maintains a limited rollback history (e.g., the last 'N' versions of each shadowed field). This enables a more granular rollback than simply restoring the initial state.
*   **Dynamic Shadowing:**  The system administrator (or an automated policy engine) can dynamically add or remove data structures from the shadowed list at runtime. This allows for adapting the protection scheme to evolving threats.

**Pseudocode (Hardware Unit):**

```
// Initialization
shadow_table = {} // Dictionary mapping data structure address to {value, signature, history}
config = {shadowed_structures: [], verification_interval: 100ms}

// Write Interception Handler (triggered by memory write)
function handle_write(address, new_value):
  if address in shadow_table:
    old_value = shadow_table[address].value
    new_signature = generate_signature(new_value)
    shadow_table[address].value = new_value
    shadow_table[address].signature = new_signature
    shadow_table[address].history.append((old_value, generate_signature(old_value))) //Store the prior state
    
// Verification Loop (runs periodically)
function verify_integrity():
  for address in shadow_table:
    current_value = read_kernel_memory(address)
    expected_value = shadow_table[address].value
    expected_signature = shadow_table[address].signature
    
    if current_value != expected_value or generate_signature(current_value) != expected_signature:
      report_integrity_violation(address)
      rollback_to_last_good_state(address)
      
// Rollback Function
function rollback_to_last_good_state(address):
  if len(shadow_table[address].history) > 0:
    old_value, old_signature = shadow_table[address].history.pop()
    write_kernel_memory(address, old_value)
```

**Novelty:** This system isn't just detecting modifications; it's proactively maintaining a verifiable shadow copy allowing for *automatic rollback* and reducing the impact of kernel-level attacks. The dynamic shadowing aspect allows for fine-grained control over the protection scheme, adapting to changing security needs.  The hardware assistance minimizes performance overhead and improves the reliability of the integrity checks.
