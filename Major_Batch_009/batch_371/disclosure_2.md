## Dynamic Address Family Negotiation for Containerized Network Functions

**Specification:** A system for automatically negotiating and establishing multi-address family connectivity between containerized network functions (CNFs) deployed across diverse network infrastructures, prioritizing performance based on real-time network conditions.

**Core Concept:**  Extend the concept of assigning multiple address families to a virtual network interface (as presented in the source patent) by introducing a dynamic negotiation process *between* CNFs. This goes beyond simple assignment; it's about establishing *preferred* address families based on observed network performance.

**System Components:**

1.  **CNF Agent:**  Each CNF will include a lightweight agent responsible for:
    *   Advertising supported address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, potentially others).
    *   Monitoring network performance (latency, packet loss) *to* and *from* other CNFs using each supported address family.
    *   Negotiating a preferred address family with peer CNFs.
    *   Dynamically adjusting traffic routing based on the negotiated address family.

2.  **Negotiation Protocol:**  A lightweight protocol (potentially built on top of UDP) used for CNF-to-CNF communication.  Message format:
    ```
    {
        "source_CNF_ID": "unique_identifier",
        "destination_CNF_ID": "unique_identifier",
        "supported_families": ["IPv4", "IPv6"],
        "performance_metrics": {
            "IPv4": {"latency": 12ms, "packet_loss": 0.01},
            "IPv6": {"latency": 8ms, "packet_loss": 0.005}
        },
        "preferred_family": "IPv6" // Or null if initial negotiation
    }
    ```

3.  **Traffic Steering Mechanism:** A mechanism (e.g., eBPF programs, network policy engine) to redirect traffic between CNFs based on the negotiated address family.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Discovery:**  CNFs periodically broadcast their presence and supported address families.
2.  **Initial Negotiation:** When a new connection is required, CNFs exchange negotiation messages to share performance metrics for each supported address family.
3.  **Preference Selection:**  Based on the exchanged metrics, each CNF selects a preferred address family.  Selection criteria could be:
    *   Lowest latency
    *   Lowest packet loss
    *   A weighted combination of both
4.  **Traffic Steering:**  The traffic steering mechanism is configured to route traffic between the CNFs using the preferred address family.
5.  **Continuous Monitoring & Re-negotiation:** CNFs continuously monitor network performance. If performance degrades significantly on the current address family, they can initiate a re-negotiation and switch to a different address family.

**Pseudocode (CNF Agent - Simplified):**

```python
class CNFAgent:
    def __init__(self, supported_families):
        self.supported_families = supported_families
        self.current_preference = None
        self.performance_data = {}

    def discover_peers():
        # Broadcast presence, receive peer information

    def negotiate_preference(peer_id):
        # Send/Receive performance data
        # Calculate preference
        # Update routing
        
    def monitor_performance():
        # Continuous monitoring of network metrics (latency, packet loss)
        # Trigger re-negotiation if performance degrades
        
    def update_routing(peer_id, preferred_family):
        # Configure routing rules (eBPF, etc.) to steer traffic
        pass
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Network Performance:**  Dynamically adapts to network conditions, using the best available address family for each connection.
*   **Increased Resilience:**  Automatically switches to a different address family if one experiences problems.
*   **Optimized Resource Utilization:**  Can leverage the strengths of different address families based on the specific application.
*   **Seamless Transition:**  Transparent to applications, as the agent handles all negotiation and routing.
