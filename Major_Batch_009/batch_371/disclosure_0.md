## Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & Pre-Provisioning

**Concept:** Leverage machine learning to *predict* future network traffic patterns between virtualized private networks, and proactively pre-provision network paths and resources *before* demand surges. This differs from reactive path creation and aims to minimize latency spikes during critical operations.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection:**
    *   Network telemetry: Bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss, error rates for all inter-VPC connections.
    *   Application performance metrics: Response times, transaction rates, error counts, resource utilization per application/service.
    *   Business/Event Calendar: Integrate with business event schedules (e.g., end-of-month processing, marketing campaigns) to anticipate traffic spikes.
    *   Historical Data: Store at least 6 months of detailed telemetry & application metrics.
*   **ML Model:**
    *   Time-Series Forecasting: Employ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or Transformer models to predict future bandwidth & latency requirements.
    *   Feature Engineering: Create features from historical data, event calendars, and application performance. Include seasonality, trend, and correlations between different VPCs and applications.
    *   Model Training: Continuous training and retraining of the model based on incoming data. A/B testing of different model architectures.
*   **Pre-Provisioning Engine:**
    *   Thresholds: Define thresholds for predicted bandwidth and latency. When thresholds are exceeded, the engine triggers pre-provisioning.
    *   Path Calculation: Utilize a network path calculation algorithm (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s, Bellman-Ford) to determine the optimal paths for predicted traffic. Consider multiple paths for redundancy.
    *   Resource Allocation: Allocate bandwidth, compute resources (e.g., virtual machines, network interfaces), and network capacity along the pre-provisioned paths.
    *   Path Activation: Paths are initially 'warm' but not fully active. Traffic is automatically routed to the pre-provisioned path when actual demand reaches a certain level.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitor actual traffic and resource utilization on pre-provisioned paths.
    *   Feedback Loop: Use real-time data to refine the ML model and adjust resource allocation dynamically.
    *   Path Deactivation: Deactivate and release resources on pre-provisioned paths when they are no longer needed.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Collection Module
loop:
  collectNetworkTelemetry()
  collectApplicationMetrics()
  collectEventCalendarData()
  storeData()

// ML Model Training Module
loop:
  loadHistoricalData()
  trainMLModel()
  saveMLModel()

// Prediction & Pre-Provisioning Module
loop:
  loadMLModel()
  predictFutureTraffic()
  if predictedTraffic > threshold:
    calculateOptimalPaths()
    allocateResources()
    warmPaths()

// Real-time Adjustment Module
loop:
  monitorTraffic()
  if actualTraffic > predictedTraffic:
    adjustResources() // Increase
  if actualTraffic < predictedTraffic:
    adjustResources() // Decrease
```

**Novelty:** Current systems primarily *react* to network congestion. This design *proactively* anticipates and prepares for it. The combination of time-series forecasting with real-time adjustment is key. The integration with a business/event calendar adds another layer of predictive capability.
