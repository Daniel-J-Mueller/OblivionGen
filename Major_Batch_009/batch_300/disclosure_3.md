## Adaptive Power Amplifier Virtualization with Dynamic Harmonic Tuning

**Concept:** Extend the binning approach by creating virtual power amplifiers through dynamic harmonic tuning and controlled intermodulation distortion (IMD). Instead of *selecting* pre-binned amplifiers, *create* amplifiers with tailored characteristics on-the-fly. This allows for far greater flexibility and optimization than static binning.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A reconfigurable harmonic filter network (RHFN) placed *after* each power amplifier stage (PA). The RHFN consists of switched-capacitor/inductor networks controlled by a digital signal processor (DSP).
*   **DSP Control:** The DSP analyzes the instantaneous transmit waveform and dynamically adjusts the RHFN to:
    *   **Enhance desired harmonics:** Boost the amplitude of specific harmonics to increase effective power at the antenna.  This is *not* simply harmonic generation, but selective enhancement of naturally occurring harmonics.
    *   **Suppress unwanted IMD products:**  Attenuate intermodulation distortion products falling within the transmit band. The DSP will use pre-characterized IMD profiles for each PA stage to predict and mitigate distortion.
    *   **Shape harmonic spectrum:** Tailor the harmonic spectrum for optimal energy efficiency and signal quality.  Different modulation schemes (e.g., QAM, OFDM) will require different spectral shaping.
*   **PA Stage Diversity:** Utilize a mix of PA technologies (e.g., GaN, GaAs, SiGe) with varying linearity and efficiency characteristics. The DSP will intelligently select and combine the output of these PAs based on the transmit waveform requirements.
*   **Real-Time Calibration:** Implement a continuous calibration routine using a built-in spectrum analyzer and power meter to monitor the RHFN performance and dynamically adjust the control parameters.
*   **Virtual PA Profiles:** Store pre-defined "virtual PA" profiles representing different power levels, linearity requirements, and energy efficiency targets. The DSP will switch between these profiles based on the current operating conditions.

**Pseudocode (DSP control loop):**

```
// Initialization
initialize_RHFN_parameters()
load_default_virtual_PA_profile()

// Main Loop
while (transmit_active) {

  // Analyze transmit waveform
  waveform_data = get_transmit_waveform_data()
  peak_power = calculate_peak_power(waveform_data)
  linearity_requirement = determine_linearity_requirement(waveform_data)

  // Select virtual PA profile
  virtual_PA_profile = select_virtual_PA_profile(peak_power, linearity_requirement)

  // Adjust RHFN parameters
  RHFN_parameters = generate_RHFN_parameters(virtual_PA_profile)
  apply_RHFN_parameters(RHFN_parameters)

  // Monitor performance
  spectrum = read_spectrum_analyzer()
  power = read_power_meter()
  error = calculate_error(spectrum, power, target_spectrum, target_power)

  //Adaptive Calibration
  if (error > threshold){
       adjust_RHFN_parameters(error)
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Flexibility:** Allows for dynamic adjustment of amplifier characteristics to optimize performance for different waveforms and operating conditions.
*   **Improved Energy Efficiency:** Maximizes efficiency by tailoring amplifier characteristics to the instantaneous transmit power.
*   **Enhanced Linearity:** Mitigates distortion and improves signal quality.
*   **Reduced Hardware Complexity:** Potentially reduces the need for multiple pre-binned amplifiers.
*   **Scalability:** The system can be easily scaled to support a larger number of antenna elements.
