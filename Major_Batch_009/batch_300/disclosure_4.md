**Dynamic Spectral Shaping with Micro-LED Arrays & Computational Optics**

**Concept:**  Instead of blending pre-defined color temperatures via current control, actively sculpt the emitted spectrum *before* it enters the light guide. This allows for far more precise color control, tailored viewing experiences, and potential for displaying content with wider color gamuts than currently achievable.

**Specs:**

*   **Illuminating Element:** Replace the current LED arrangements with a high-density micro-LED array. Each micro-LED is individually addressable.  Target density: >5000 micro-LEDs per inch.
*   **Spectral Diversity:** Each micro-LED is coated with a different, narrow-bandpass phosphor (or other spectral shaping material).  The coating selection process is automated during manufacturing. Phosphor selection covers the visible spectrum from 400nm to 700nm in approximately 10nm bands.
*   **Light Guide Modification:**  The light guide panel material is modified to allow for greater light extraction efficiency across a broader spectrum.  Consider a nano-particle doped polymer.
*   **Computational Optics Engine:** A dedicated processor and software suite performs real-time spectral analysis and optimization. Inputs include:
    *   Display Content: Color data for the currently displayed image or video.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: Measures the color temperature and intensity of the surrounding environment.
    *   User Preference: Customizable settings for color temperature, brightness, and color gamut.
    *   Viewing Angle: Optional sensors detect user's viewing angle for per-pixel brightness compensation.
*   **Algorithm:** The core algorithm determines the optimal intensity level for each micro-LED in the array. The goal is to recreate the desired color temperature *and* match the color characteristics of the displayed content, factoring in ambient light and user preferences.
    *   Spectral Decomposition: Decompose the target color into its constituent wavelengths.
    *   Micro-LED Activation: Activate only the micro-LEDs that emit wavelengths within the target color range.
    *   Intensity Modulation:  Adjust the intensity of each activated micro-LED to achieve the desired color balance and brightness.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Automated calibration process to account for manufacturing variations, phosphor aging, and individual micro-LED performance differences.
*   **Control Interface:** Software API for developers to access the spectral control features and integrate them into their applications.
*   **Power Management:** Dynamic power allocation to optimize energy efficiency based on the current display content and user settings.

**Pseudocode (simplified algorithm):**

```
function generate_spectrum(target_color, ambient_light, user_pref):
  spectral_array = initialize_array(num_micro_leds)
  
  for i in range(num_micro_leds):
    led_wavelength = get_led_wavelength(i)
    
    # Calculate the required intensity for this wavelength
    required_intensity = calculate_intensity(target_color, led_wavelength, ambient_light, user_pref)
    
    spectral_array[i] = required_intensity
  
  return spectral_array
```

**Novelty:**  Current systems rely on *additive* mixing of pre-defined colors. This approach creates a *subtractive* spectral environment where desired wavelengths are *selected* rather than created, allowing for superior color accuracy, wider color gamuts, and optimized viewing experiences tailored to the content and environment.
