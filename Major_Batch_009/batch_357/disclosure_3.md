## Dynamic Content 'Fingerprinting' & Selective Obfuscation

**Concept:** Extend the existing obfuscation techniques not just to *hide* content, but to dynamically fingerprint it, allowing for selective access and rendering based on user authentication *after* initial delivery. This moves beyond preventing simple copying; it enables granular control over what a user *sees* within a single document or web page.

**Specs:**

1.  **Fingerprint Generation:** 
    *   The server-side process analyzes the original content item.
    *   It generates a unique cryptographic hash (the 'fingerprint') of specific content blocks (paragraphs, images, code sections) *before* obfuscation.
    *   This fingerprint is stored server-side, associated with the user's account and access rights.
    *   Instead of a monolithic obfuscation, different content blocks are obfuscated using *different* algorithms or levels of obfuscation, keyed to the fingerprint.

2.  **Client-Side Decryption/Rendering:**
    *   The browser receives the obfuscated content and the script.
    *   The script contacts the server (securely) to retrieve the user's decryption keys *associated with the content’s fingerprints*.
    *   The script decrypts/de-obfuscates *only* the content blocks for which the user has access, *dynamically* during rendering.  Blocks without a valid key remain obfuscated or hidden.
    *   A 'rendering mask' is created to control the visibility of content sections based on decryption success.

3.  **Adaptive Obfuscation & 'Decoy' Content:**
    *   The server can inject 'decoy' content blocks – plausible but false information – which are presented to users *without* the necessary decryption keys.
    *   The obfuscation algorithm is randomly selected or dynamically adjusted based on user profile/threat assessment.
    *   The content can be split into multiple layers, with each layer requiring a different key/access level.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Script):**

```
function renderContent(contentData) {
  // contentData contains obfuscated content blocks and metadata

  for (let blockIndex = 0; blockIndex < contentData.blocks.length; blockIndex++) {
    let block = contentData.blocks[blockIndex];
    let fingerprint = block.fingerprint;

    // Request decryption key from server
    getKey(fingerprint)
      .then(key => {
        if (key) {
          // De-obfuscate the block using the key
          let deobfuscatedBlock = deobfuscate(block.content, key);
          // Render the deobfuscated block
          renderBlock(deobfuscatedBlock);
        } else {
          // User lacks access – render a placeholder or decoy
          renderPlaceholder();
        }
      })
      .catch(error => {
        // Handle errors (e.g., network issues, invalid key)
        console.error("Error decrypting block:", error);
        renderPlaceholder();
      });
  }
}

function renderPlaceholder() {
  // Render a placeholder or decoy content
  // (e.g., a generic message, a blurred image, etc.)
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Premium Content:** Grant access to specific content sections based on subscription level.
*   **Confidential Documents:** Control access to sensitive information within a document.
*   **Dynamic Rights Management:**  Revoke access to content in real-time.
*   **Watermarking:**  Embed a user-specific watermark that is visible only to authorized users.
