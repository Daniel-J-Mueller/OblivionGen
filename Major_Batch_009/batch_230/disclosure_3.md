## Modular, Segmented Power/Data Rails with Active Cooling

**Concept:** Expand the rail/channel connector system into a fully modular, segmented system capable of delivering both power *and* data, with integrated active cooling for high-density applications.  This moves beyond simple power distribution to a comprehensive interconnect solution.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Rail Segmentation:** Rails and channels are no longer continuous lengths, but constructed from short, interlocking segments (e.g., 5cm long). These segments connect mechanically and electrically via high-conductivity, pressure-fit connectors.
2.  **Multi-Channel Segments:** Each segment can accommodate multiple conductive paths - positive, negative, neutral, ground, and multiple data lines (e.g., USB-C, Ethernet). Segment design dictates data/power allocation.
3.  **Active Cooling Integration:**  Each rail segment incorporates a micro-channel heat sink. Coolant (water-glycol mix or dielectric fluid) circulates through these channels. Coolant inlet/outlet ports are integrated into the segment connectors. Segments can be specified as "power only", "data only", or "power/data with cooling".
4.  **Segment ‘Smart’ Features:** Each segment contains a small microcontroller and current/voltage sensors. This enables:
    *   Real-time monitoring of power draw per segment.
    *   Overcurrent protection (segment can shut down if current exceeds a threshold).
    *   Data line signal integrity monitoring.
    *   Remote configuration of segment functionality (e.g. disable power, isolate a data line).
5.  **Connector Standardization:** Maintain the basic rail/channel alignment of the parent patent, but refine the connector design to accommodate:
    *   Increased pin density for data lines.
    *   Coolant flow pathways.
    *   Electrical connections for segment microcontroller.
6.  **Material Selection:**
    *   Rails/Channels: High-conductivity aluminum alloy with nickel plating.
    *   Segment Housing: Thermally conductive polymer (e.g., PEEK)
    *   Connectors: Copper alloy with gold plating.
7.  **Rack Integration:**
    *   Standard 19" rack mounting.
    *   Rack provides coolant supply/return plumbing.
    *   Rack can act as a central controller for segment monitoring/configuration.

**Pseudocode (Segment Control Logic):**

```
//Segment Initialization
function initializeSegment() {
    setPowerState(OFF);
    setDataLineState(ALL_DISABLED);
    readConfiguration();
}

//Power Control
function setPowerState(state) {
    if (state == ON) {
        enablePowerSwitch();
    } else {
        disablePowerSwitch();
    }
}

//Data Line Control
function setDataLineState(line, state) {
    if (state == ENABLED) {
        enableDataLine(line);
    } else {
        disableDataLine(line);
    }
}

//Monitoring
function readCurrent() {
    return readSensor(CURRENT_SENSOR);
}

function readVoltage() {
    return readSensor(VOLTAGE_SENSOR);
}

//Error Handling
function checkOvercurrent() {
    if (readCurrent() > MAX_CURRENT) {
        setPowerState(OFF);
        reportError("Overcurrent detected");
    }
}
```

**Applications:**

*   High-density server racks.
*   GPU clusters.
*   Customizable electronics workstations.
*   Robotics and automation.
*   Electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
