## Neighborhood Sensory Network & Augmented Reality Projection

**Concept:** Expand the neighborhood video/audio sharing system into a comprehensive sensory network coupled with localized AR projection for enhanced community awareness and interactive experiences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensory Node Expansion:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each A/V device (existing & new) upgraded with environmental sensors: temperature, humidity, air quality (CO2, particulate matter), ambient light, sound level (dB).
    *   Optional: Low-resolution radar/LiDAR for basic motion/object detection beyond camera range.
    *   Secure, low-power wireless communication module (e.g., Thread, Zigbee) for direct node-to-node mesh networking independent of Wi-Fi.
*   **Software:**
    *   Sensor data aggregation & timestamping.
    *   Data prioritization based on event detection (motion, sound spikes, air quality alerts).
    *   Secure data transmission to local 'Neighborhood Hub' (see section 2).
    *   API for third-party integration (weather services, emergency alerts).

**2. Neighborhood Hub:**

*   **Hardware:** Dedicated, low-power server (Raspberry Pi equivalent) located centrally within the neighborhood (community center, library, shared residence).
*   **Software:**
    *   Mesh network management.
    *   Data aggregation & analysis from all sensory nodes.
    *   Event detection algorithms (e.g., unusual temperature spikes, persistent high CO2 levels).
    *   Secure data storage & access control.
    *   API for smart TV integration & external services.
    *   AR Projection Control (see section 3).

**3. Localized AR Projection System:**

*   **Hardware:** Multiple low-cost, short-throw projectors strategically positioned throughout the neighborhood (building facades, parks, community spaces). Projectors networked to the Neighborhood Hub.
*   **Software:**
    *   AR Content Engine: Generates dynamic AR overlays based on real-time sensor data and user interactions.
    *   Projection Mapping Software: Calibrates and aligns AR projections onto physical surfaces.
    *   User Interface: Allows residents to customize AR experiences (e.g., visualize air quality levels, highlight points of interest, create interactive games).
    *   Example AR Scenarios:
        *   **Air Quality Visualization:** Overlay color-coded air quality data onto streets and buildings.
        *   **Interactive Neighborhood Map:** Display points of interest, local events, and community announcements as AR overlays.
        *   **Safety Alerts:** Project warning messages onto sidewalks during emergencies (e.g., flood warnings, traffic accidents).
        *   **Augmented Games:** Create interactive AR games that utilize the neighborhood as a play space.

**4. Smart TV Integration (Enhanced):**

*   **Data Visualization Dashboard:** Display real-time sensor data, AR projections, and community feeds on the smart TV.
*   **AR Control Interface:** Allows residents to control AR projections and customize their AR experiences using the smart TV remote.
*   **Emergency Notification System:** Displays critical alerts on the smart TV and initiates AR projections to guide residents to safety.

**Pseudocode (AR Projection Control):**

```
// Event Loop
while (true) {
    // Read Sensor Data from Neighborhood Hub
    sensorData = NeighborhoodHub.getSensorData();

    // Detect Events
    event = EventDetection.detectEvent(sensorData);

    // Generate AR Content
    arContent = ARContentGenerator.generateContent(event);

    // Project AR Content onto Surfaces
    ProjectionSystem.projectContent(arContent);

    // Handle User Input (Smart TV Remote)
    userInput = SmartTV.getUserInput();
    if (userInput == "Change Visualization") {
        // Update AR Visualization
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This expands the concept from simple video sharing to a full-scale sensory network with localized AR projection. It creates a dynamic, interactive environment that enhances community awareness, safety, and engagement. The combination of real-time sensor data, AR projection, and smart TV integration is unique and has potential applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, and community development.
