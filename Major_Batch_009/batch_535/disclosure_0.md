## Dynamic Sensor Mesh – Aerial Vehicle

**Concept:** Expand beyond fixed sensor positions to create a reconfigurable sensor ‘mesh’ around the aerial vehicle using miniature, wirelessly powered and communicating drones deployed from the main vehicle.

**Specs:**

*   **Miniature Drone Specs:**
    *   Dimensions: 5cm x 5cm x 2cm
    *   Weight: 30 grams
    *   Propulsion: Quadcopter – micro brushless motors
    *   Power: Wireless power transfer (inductive coupling) from the main UAV.  Backup – small solid-state battery (15 min operation)
    *   Communication: Dedicated short-range, low-latency RF link (proprietary protocol) to the main UAV.  Mesh networking capability between mini-drones.
    *   Sensor Payload: Single high-resolution, low-light camera with stabilized gimbal.  Optional:  LiDAR or thermal sensor.
    *   Flight Time (Wirelessly Powered): Unlimited (while within range of main UAV)
    *   Maximum Deployment Range: 20 meters from main UAV.

*   **Main UAV Integration:**
    *   Deployment System:  Internal carousel/magazine capable of holding 20+ miniature drones.  Pneumatic/electric launch mechanism.
    *   Power Transmission System:  Array of directed energy transmitters (focused RF energy) mounted on UAV frame.  Automatic beamforming to track and power mini-drones.  Safety protocols to prevent interference with other devices.
    *   Control System:  AI-powered flight planning and control algorithm.  Automatic deployment, positioning, and flight path adjustment of mini-drones based on mission objectives and environmental conditions.  Real-time collision avoidance.  Sensor data fusion from all deployed drones.
    *   Software:
        *   `deployDrone(x, y, z, sensorType)` – command to deploy a drone to specified coordinates with a particular sensor configuration.
        *   `setSensorMode(droneID, mode)` – sets the operating mode of a specific drone's sensor (e.g., “visible light,” “thermal,” “LiDAR”).
        *   `createMesh(resolution)` – dynamically creates a virtual 3D mesh based on drone positions and sensor data.
        *   `scanArea(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)` – instructs the mesh to prioritize scanning a defined area.
        *   `returnAll()` – command to recall all deployed drones to the main UAV.

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Perimeter Scan:** Deploy drones in a circular pattern around the UAV to create a 360-degree view.
    *   **Target Tracking:**  Deploy drones to follow a moving target, maintaining a specified distance and angle.
    *   **Structure Inspection:**  Fly drones around a structure (e.g., bridge, building) to capture detailed imagery and identify potential defects.
    *   **Dynamic Mapping:** Create a real-time 3D map of the surrounding environment.
    *   **Search and Rescue:** Deploy drones to search for missing persons in a designated area.



**Innovation Rationale:** Fixed sensor arrangements have limitations in terms of field of view and ability to adapt to dynamic environments. This system provides a flexible, scalable, and adaptable sensor platform that can overcome these limitations and provide a more comprehensive and accurate view of the surrounding environment. The wireless power transfer technology eliminates the need for batteries, reducing weight and maintenance requirements.  The AI-powered control system automates the deployment and operation of the drones, making the system easy to use and highly efficient.
