## Secure Peripheral Attestation & Dynamic Trust Zoning

**Concept:** Expand the security service processor's (SSP) role beyond firmware verification and update to encompass *runtime* attestation of peripheral devices, and dynamically adjust trust boundaries within the host computer based on this attestation.

**Motivation:** Current attestation focuses on boot-time firmware integrity. This system aims for continuous monitoring, reacting to runtime compromise of peripherals (e.g., via DMA attacks, rogue drivers). It also introduces the idea of “trust zones” dynamically allocated based on peripheral security posture, limiting access for compromised devices.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **SSP Enhancement:** Add a dedicated “Real-Time Attestation Engine” (RAE) to the SSP. This engine will perform continuous monitoring of peripheral behavior via direct memory access (DMA) monitoring and bus traffic analysis.
*   **Peripheral Hardware Assist:** Mandate a small “Attestation Co-Processor” (ACP) within critical peripherals (PCIe devices, storage controllers, network interfaces). This ACP receives commands from the SSP/RAE, performs secure measurements (e.g., code checksums, memory state), and reports back to the SSP.  ACPs *must* be tamper resistant.
*   **Hardware Trust Root:** A physically isolated and protected region within the SSP to store cryptographic keys and root-of-trust material.

**Software Components:**

*   **RAE Firmware:** The core of the attestation process. It orchestrates measurements, compares results against known-good baselines, and triggers security actions.
*   **Dynamic Trust Zone Manager (DTZM):** A software module running within the SSP that dynamically adjusts IOMMU (Input/Output Memory Management Unit) configurations and access control lists based on peripheral security status.
*   **Peripheral Device Drivers (PDDs):** Modified drivers to interact with the ACPs and communicate security status to the DTZM.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initialization:** At boot, the SSP/RAE establishes a secure channel with each peripheral ACP.
2.  **Runtime Monitoring:** The RAE periodically requests security measurements from each ACP (e.g., code integrity, memory contents, register states). These measurements are cryptographically signed by the ACP.
3.  **Attestation:** The RAE verifies the signature and compares the measurements against a baseline.
4.  **Trust Zone Adjustment:**
    *   **Healthy Device:** The DTZM grants the device full access to system memory and resources.
    *   **Compromised Device:** The DTZM isolates the device via IOMMU configuration, limiting its access to specific memory regions and resources. It also generates a security alert.  This could involve re-routing DMA requests, limiting PCIe lane access, or completely disabling the device.
5.  **Alerting & Remediation:** If a device is deemed compromised, the SSP generates an alert and initiates remediation procedures (e.g., driver restart, device reset, system shutdown).

**Pseudocode (RAE - Measurement & Attestation):**

```
function AttestPeripheral(peripheralID, measurementType) {
  // Request measurement from peripheral ACP
  measurementData = RequestMeasurement(peripheralID, measurementType);

  // Verify signature of measurement data
  if (!VerifySignature(measurementData, peripheralPublicKey)) {
    Log("Signature verification failed for " + peripheralID);
    return false;
  }

  // Calculate expected hash
  expectedHash = CalculateExpectedHash(peripheralID, measurementType, baselineData);

  // Compare calculated hash with expected hash
  if (Hash(measurementData) != expectedHash) {
    Log("Hash mismatch for " + peripheralID);
    return false;
  }

  Log("Attestation successful for " + peripheralID);
  return true;
}

function UpdateBaseline(peripheralID, measurementType, newBaselineData) {
  // Securely store new baseline data
  StoreBaselineData(peripheralID, measurementType, newBaselineData);
}
```

**Baseline Data:** Baseline data should include:

*   Firmware hash
*   Critical register values
*   Memory map
*   Expected DMA patterns

**Security Considerations:**

*   ACPs must be physically secure and tamper resistant.
*   Baseline data must be securely stored and protected from modification.
*   Communication channels between the SSP and ACPs must be encrypted and authenticated.
*   The entire system must be resistant to side-channel attacks.
