## Adaptive Dependency Injection via Predictive Snapshotting

**Concept:** Expand the pre-snapshotting concept to dynamically predict *future* dependency needs based on code analysis, and proactively provision those dependencies within the snapshot. This moves beyond simply capturing a known-good state, towards a self-optimizing execution environment.

**Specification:**

**1. Dependency Graph Analyzer:**

*   **Input:** User-submitted code (any language).
*   **Process:** Static and dynamic code analysis to build a dependency graph. This includes identifying:
    *   Directly imported libraries/modules.
    *   Potential runtime dependencies (e.g., system calls, network resources).
    *   Code paths that trigger specific dependencies.
    *   Likelihood of dependency usage (probabilistic weighting).
*   **Output:** A weighted dependency graph represented as a JSON object.  Example:

```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    {"name": "numpy", "weight": 0.95, "version": "1.23"},
    {"name": "requests", "weight": 0.7, "version": "2.28"},
    {"name": "PIL", "weight": 0.2, "version": "9.3"},
    {"name": "torch", "weight": 0.05, "version": "1.13"}
  ]
}
```

**2. Snapshot Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Dependency graph, historical execution data (if available).
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify the 'core' dependencies (high weight, consistently used).
    *   Predict 'likely' dependencies (moderate weight, probabilistic usage).
    *   Create a 'candidate snapshot' with core dependencies.
    *   Introduce probabilistic layers to the snapshot. For example:
        *   For each likely dependency: create a shadow VM instance (minimal resources).
        *   Monitor resource usage of the shadow instances.
        *   If usage exceeds a threshold, fully provision the dependency within the primary snapshot.
*   **Output:** An 'augmented snapshot' with core and likely dependencies pre-provisioned (or prepared for immediate provisioning).

**3. Snapshot Management & Provisioning:**

*   Maintain a pool of base snapshots (OS, runtime).
*   Apply the augmented snapshot layers to the base snapshot.
*   Implement lazy-loading of less-likely dependencies (on-demand provisioning).
*   Track dependency usage during execution.
*   Dynamically update the augmented snapshot for future executions (learning system).

**4.  Pseudocode â€“ Snapshot Generation:**

```
function generateAugmentedSnapshot(code):
  dependencyGraph = analyzeCode(code)
  baseSnapshot = loadBaseSnapshot()
  coreDependencies = filterDependencies(dependencyGraph, weight > 0.8)
  likelyDependencies = filterDependencies(dependencyGraph, 0.2 < weight < 0.8)

  for dependency in coreDependencies:
    provisionDependency(baseSnapshot, dependency)

  for dependency in likelyDependencies:
    shadowVM = createShadowVM(dependency)
    monitorResourceUsage(shadowVM)
    if resourceUsageExceedsThreshold(shadowVM):
      provisionDependency(baseSnapshot, dependency)
    else:
      destroyShadowVM(shadowVM)

  return baseSnapshot
```

**5.  Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-speed storage for snapshot management.
*   Sufficient RAM to support multiple shadow VMs.
*   Network bandwidth for on-demand dependency provisioning.
