## Dynamic Contact Constellations & Predictive Proximity

**Core Concept:** Extend the multi-path contact display beyond a purely visual arrangement. Integrate predictive behavioral modeling to dynamically adjust contact positioning and presentation based on user habits, calendar events, and contextual data. This creates a 'living' contact constellation that anticipates user needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Contact list (as per existing patent)
    *   Calendar data (access with user permission)
    *   Location data (optional, access with user permission)
    *   App usage data (access with user permission – e.g., frequent messaging apps)
    *   Communication history (email, SMS, call logs)
*   **Behavioral Modeling Engine:**
    *   Algorithm to analyze data inputs and predict contact likelihood.
    *   Weighted scoring system:
        *   **Recency:** How recently was communication?
        *   **Frequency:** How often is communication?
        *   **Context:** Calendar events related to the contact. Location proximity. App usage.
        *   **Relationship Strength:** Derived from communication volume/type.
    *   Dynamic adjustment of contact scores, learning from user interactions.
*   **Display Logic:**
    *   Multiple concentric or spiral paths (as in the base patent).
    *   Contact positioning on paths determined by behavioral score. Higher scores = closer to the 'center' of the display or more prominent visual representation.
    *   Dynamic path adjustment: Paths shift and warp in real-time based on score changes.
    *   ‘Halo’ effect: Contacts with exceptionally high scores are highlighted with a pulsating glow or unique visual identifier.
    *   Predictive Pathing: Contacts *predicted* to be contacted soon are animated along a short ‘lead’ path towards the intersection point. This is a visual cue of anticipated communication.
*   **Interaction Model:**
    *   Standard selection at intersection point.
    *   'Peek' Mode: Long-press on a contact along a path to reveal a mini-profile with recent communication history, next scheduled event, or relevant contextual information.
    *   'Sweep' Gesture: Swipe across the display to 'scan' through predicted contacts – the system dynamically highlights contacts likely to be contacted within a defined timeframe.
    *   'Focus' Mode: User can select a specific criteria (e.g., work contacts, family members) to prioritize and filter the displayed contacts.
*   **Pseudocode (Path Assignment):**

```
function assignPath(contact, behavioralScore, pathCount):
  // Normalize the score
  normalizedScore = (behavioralScore - minScore) / (maxScore - minScore)

  // Assign a path based on the normalized score
  pathIndex = floor(normalizedScore * pathCount)

  //Ensure pathIndex is within bounds
  pathIndex = min(pathIndex, pathCount - 1)
  pathIndex = max(pathIndex, 0)

  return pathIndex
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:**
    *   Optimized for displays with high refresh rates to smooth out dynamic pathing.
    *   Potential for haptic feedback to signal contact proximity or score changes.

*   **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Integration with AI assistants for voice-activated contact selection.
    *   AR overlay to project contact constellations onto real-world environments.
    *   Customizable pathing algorithms to cater to individual user preferences.
