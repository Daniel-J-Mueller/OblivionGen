## Adaptive Quantum Error Correction via Inter-Quantum-Computer Entanglement

**System Specifications:**

**1. Core Concept:** Establish persistent, dynamically adjusted entanglement links *between* quantum computers in the pool, not just within each individual machine. Utilize this entanglement to perform real-time, adaptive quantum error correction, distributing error information and correction operations across the networked quantum computers.

**2. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Quantum Interconnect:**  A dedicated, high-bandwidth quantum interconnect capable of maintaining entanglement between qubits across separate quantum computers.  This interconnect necessitates specialized transducers to interface differing qubit modalities (superconducting, trapped ion, photonic, etc.).  Minimum sustained entanglement fidelity: 95%.
*   **Quantum Memory:** Each quantum computer must possess sufficient quantum memory to store entangled states and intermediate correction data. Minimum 1000 logical qubits per machine.
*   **Classical Control Network:**  A high-speed, low-latency classical communication network to coordinate error detection, correction assignment, and entanglement management.  Maximum latency: 1 microsecond.
*   **Entanglement Distribution Modules (EDM):** Each quantum computer needs an EDM to generate, distribute, and verify entanglement.

**3. Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

*   **Entanglement Management Protocol (EMP):**  A distributed algorithm to dynamically establish and maintain entanglement links between quantum computers. The EMP prioritizes entanglement links based on qubit error rates, computational load, and network topology.  
*   **Distributed Error Detection (DED):**  Instead of solely relying on intra-computer error detection, DED distributes error syndromes across entangled qubits on different machines. This spreads the computational burden and improves detection accuracy.
*   **Adaptive Error Correction Assignment (AEC):**  AEC analyzes distributed error syndromes and assigns correction operations not only within a single computer but across the network. This allows leveraging the redundancy of multiple machines.
*   **Dynamic Entanglement Graph (DEG):**  A continuously updated graph representing the entanglement connections between quantum computers.  The DEG is used by the EMP, DED, and AEC algorithms.

**4. Pseudocode (Simplified AEC):**

```
// Data Structures:
//  ErrorSyndrome: Represents error information for a qubit.
//  CorrectionOperation: Specifies the quantum gate to apply.
//  EntanglementGraph: Adjacency list representing entangled qubits.

function assign_corrections(EntanglementGraph, ErrorSyndromes):
  // 1. Aggregate ErrorSyndromes from entangled qubits.
  aggregated_syndromes = aggregate_syndromes(ErrorSyndromes, EntanglementGraph)

  // 2. Determine optimal correction operations based on aggregated syndromes.
  corrections = determine_optimal_corrections(aggregated_syndromes)

  // 3. Distribute correction operations across the network.
  for each correction in corrections:
    target_computer = correction.target_computer
    operation = correction.operation
    apply_operation(target_computer, operation)

  return corrections
```

**5. Operational Procedure:**

1.  The quantum computing service receives a request for executing a quantum algorithm.
2.  The service identifies a suitable pool of quantum computers based on availability and performance characteristics.
3.  The EMP establishes entanglement links between the selected quantum computers.
4.  The algorithm is distributed to the quantum computers.
5.  During computation, DED distributes error syndromes across entangled qubits.
6.  AEC assigns correction operations across the network.
7.  The service aggregates the results from the quantum computers to generate an ensemble result.

**6. Calibration Data Integration:**

The calibration data of each quantum computer (gate fidelity, coherence times, readout error rates) is fed into the EMP, DED, and AEC algorithms to optimize entanglement links and correction assignments.  Machines with lower error rates are prioritized for critical computations, and correction operations are tailored to compensate for individual machine characteristics.
