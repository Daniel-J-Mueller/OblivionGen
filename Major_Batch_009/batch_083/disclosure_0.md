## Decentralized Attestation & Dynamic Quorum via Blockchain

**Concept:** Extend the access control paradigm beyond centralized systems by leveraging a permissioned blockchain for attestation of approvals and dynamic adjustment of quorum requirements based on real-time risk assessment. This moves beyond simple user-defined approving lists and static quorum ratios.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Blockchain Integration:** A permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) will serve as the immutable ledger for all approval requests and attestations. Each 'target user' account will have a corresponding smart contract on the blockchain.

2.  **Approval Request Initiation:** When a ‘candidate user’ requests access rights, a transaction is initiated on the blockchain, triggering the approval workflow. The transaction includes details of the requested rights and identifies the ‘target user’ account.

3.  **Dynamic Quorum Calculation:** The ‘target user’ account’s smart contract incorporates a ‘Risk Assessment Engine’. This engine analyzes various factors (e.g., candidate user’s access history, system load, time of day, detected anomalies) and calculates a *dynamic quorum requirement* - a percentage or absolute number of approvals needed.  This overrides any pre-defined static quorum.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculateDynamicQuorum(candidateUserID, requestedRights, currentTime, systemLoad, anomalyScore):
        riskScore = anomalyScore * 0.4 + systemLoad * 0.3 + currentTimeRiskFactor * 0.3
        if riskScore > 0.8:
            dynamicQuorum = 0.9 // 90% approval needed
        else if riskScore > 0.5:
            dynamicQuorum = 0.75 // 75% approval needed
        else:
            dynamicQuorum = 0.6 // 60% approval needed
        return dynamicQuorum
    ```

4.  **Approver Notification & Attestation:** Identified approvers receive notifications (e.g., via secure app, email with blockchain-signed link). Clicking the link presents a transaction proposal on the blockchain. Approvers digitally sign and submit the transaction – an ‘attestation’ of approval.

5.  **Blockchain-Based Quorum Verification:** The ‘target user’ smart contract monitors the blockchain for received attestations. Once the number/percentage of attestations meets the *dynamic quorum*, the contract automatically grants the requested access rights to the ‘candidate user’.

6.  **Access Right Revocation & Dispute Resolution:** Access rights are represented as blockchain-based credentials. Revocation is achieved by updating the smart contract, automatically removing the credential. A dispute resolution mechanism allows for challenges to access decisions, triggering a review by designated adjudicators, with results recorded on the blockchain.

7.  **Non-Custodial Attestation:** Incorporate a mechanism for approvers to ‘stake’ a small amount of cryptocurrency to incentivize honest attestation.  False approvals result in forfeiture of the staked amount.

8.  **Attestation History:**  All approvals, rejections, and stake forfeitures are immutably recorded on the blockchain, providing a complete audit trail.



This moves beyond the limitations of pre-defined, static approval lists, and introduces a layer of real-time risk assessment and decentralized trust to the access control process.
