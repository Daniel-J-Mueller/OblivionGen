## Dynamic Virtual Network "Scent Trails"

**Concept:** Extend the user-specified virtual network characteristics beyond simple QoS/routing preferences to incorporate a time-decaying "scent trail" representing network usage patterns. This allows the substrate network to proactively optimize routing not just for *stated* preferences, but for *predicted* needs based on observed behavior.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** *Virtual Network Profiler (VNP)* - Software module integrated into each virtual network instance.
*   **Data Collected:**
    *   Source/Destination pairs (Virtual Component IDs).
    *   Data volume per time window (e.g., 5-minute intervals).
    *   Application type (identified via deep packet inspection or user-defined tags).
    *   Success/failure rates for connections.
*   **Data Structure:** *Scent Trail Map* –  A time-decaying hash map per virtual network. Keys are Source/Destination pairs. Values are weighted vectors representing recent usage:
    *   *Volume Weight:*  Recent data volume.
    *   *Frequency Weight:* Number of connections.
    *   *Reliability Weight:*  Success rate.
    *   *Decay Factor:* Configurable per virtual network, controlling how quickly older data is forgotten.
*   **Component:** *Substrate Routing Adaptor (SRA)* - Module interfacing between virtual networks and the substrate network routing infrastructure.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  VNP continuously updates the Scent Trail Map based on network traffic.
    2.  SRA periodically queries the Scent Trail Map for each virtual network.
    3.  SRA translates the Scent Trail Map into “preference boosts” for specific substrate paths.  Higher scent trail weights increase the probability of selecting those paths.
    4.  SRA implements a routing algorithm that combines user-specified characteristics (from the original patent) with these dynamic preference boosts.
    5.  The algorithm could be a weighted sum, or a more sophisticated machine learning model trained to predict optimal paths.
*   **Pseudocode (SRA - Path Selection):**

```
function selectPath(sourceNode, destNode, userPrefs, scentTrailData):
    // Calculate base path costs using standard routing metrics + userPrefs
    baseCosts = calculateBaseCosts(sourceNode, destNode, userPrefs)

    // Calculate scent trail boosts for each potential path
    pathBoosts = {}
    for path in potentialPaths:
        boost = 0
        for (src, dest) in scentTrailData:
            if path contains src and dest:
                boost += scentTrailData[(src, dest)] * boostWeight  // boostWeight is a configurable parameter
        pathBoosts[path] = boost

    // Combine base costs and scent trail boosts
    finalCosts = {}
    for path in potentialPaths:
        finalCosts[path] = baseCosts[path] - pathBoosts[path] // Subtract boost to favor paths

    // Select the path with the lowest final cost
    bestPath = min(finalCosts, key=finalCosts.get)
    return bestPath
```

*   **Scalability:** Implement a distributed Scent Trail Map using a key-value store (e.g., Redis, Cassandra) to handle a large number of virtual networks.

*   **Security:** Isolate Scent Trail Maps per virtual network to prevent cross-contamination or malicious manipulation.
