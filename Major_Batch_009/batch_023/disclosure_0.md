## Adaptive Harmonic Filtering with Predictive Capacitance

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic decoupling capacitor concept to proactively filter harmonic distortion *before* it significantly impacts the power supply line, using predictive analysis of device workload and anticipated harmonic profiles.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:**  Tunable Decoupling Network (TDN) – replaces the single tunable capacitor with a network of digitally controlled switched capacitor banks and inductors. This allows for more complex impedance matching and harmonic filtering.
*   **Workload Prediction Module:**  Utilizes machine learning (specifically, a recurrent neural network – RNN) to predict future device workload based on historical usage patterns, current application state, and sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, microphone).  The RNN outputs a ‘harmonic profile prediction’ indicating anticipated harmonic frequencies and amplitudes.
*   **Harmonic Profile Database:** Stores pre-characterized harmonic profiles for common device states and applications (e.g., video streaming, gaming, voice calls, standby). The RNN’s prediction is mapped to the closest profile, refining the filter parameters.
*   **Filter Control Algorithm:**  
    1.  **Real-Time Analysis:** Continuously monitors the power supply line for harmonic distortion using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyzer.
    2.  **Prediction Integration:**  Combines the FFT data with the RNN’s harmonic profile prediction.  A weighted average (adjustable based on prediction confidence) determines the target impedance of the TDN.
    3.  **TDN Configuration:**  A digital control system adjusts the switched capacitor banks and inductors within the TDN to achieve the target impedance, minimizing harmonic distortion at predicted frequencies.
    4.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously compares the predicted harmonic profile with the actual measured harmonic distortion. The difference is used to refine the RNN's training data, improving prediction accuracy over time.

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   High-speed, low-resistance switches for capacitor banks.
    *   Low-ESR capacitors optimized for high-frequency switching.
    *   Miniature inductors with low DC resistance.
    *   High-resolution ADC/DAC for precise control of capacitor banks and inductor currents.
    *   Dedicated processing core for FFT analysis, RNN execution, and TDN control.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Collect Data
  current_usage_data = get_usage_data();
  power_line_data = get_power_line_data();

  // 2. Predict Harmonic Profile
  predicted_profile = RNN.predict(current_usage_data);

  // 3. Analyze Current Harmonic Distortion
  current_distortion = FFT.analyze(power_line_data);

  // 4. Calculate Target Impedance
  target_impedance = calculate_target_impedance(predicted_profile, current_distortion);

  // 5. Configure TDN
  TDN.configure(target_impedance);

  // 6. Update RNN (Adaptive Learning)
  error = compare(predicted_profile, current_distortion);
  RNN.train(error);
}
```

**Refinement:**

*   Implement multiple TDNs strategically placed on the power supply line to target specific harmonic frequencies.
*   Explore the use of active noise cancellation techniques in conjunction with the TDN for improved harmonic filtering.
*   Develop a cloud-based platform for sharing harmonic profiles and RNN models among devices, enabling collective learning and optimization.
