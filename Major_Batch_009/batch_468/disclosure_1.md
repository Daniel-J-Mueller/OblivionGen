## Dynamic Price Parity ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Enforcement

**Concept:** Extend price parity monitoring beyond simple comparison to incorporate ‘shadow’ pricing, predictive modeling, and proactive intervention to maintain parity *before* violations occur. The current patent focuses on *detecting* violations. This expands into *preventing* them.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadow Price Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time price data for products from both the retailer's channel and the third-party seller’s channels. Historical sales data (volume, time of day, day of week), competitor pricing, promotional calendars.
*   **Process:** Utilizing a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict the third-party seller’s *likely* pricing strategy over the next 24-72 hours.  This creates a "shadow price" – the price the seller is statistically expected to offer. The model incorporates external factors like demand, seasonality, and competitor actions.
*   **Output:** Predicted "shadow price" for each product, updated continuously. A ‘confidence interval’ associated with the prediction (e.g., 95% confidence).

**2. Proactive Parity Adjustment System:**

*   **Input:** Retailer’s current price, Third-party Seller’s current price, Shadow Price, Confidence Interval. A defined “Parity Tolerance” parameter (e.g., 0.05 – 5% difference allowed).
*   **Process:**
    *   If the current Third-party Seller price is *within* the Parity Tolerance, no action.
    *   If the current Third-party Seller price is *approaching* the Parity Tolerance boundary (determined by a configurable threshold within the confidence interval), *initiate a ‘soft nudge’*. This could involve:
        *   Automated communication to the third-party seller (e.g., "Price on [product] is nearing the agreed parity level. Consider adjusting.") – non-accusatory, preventative.
        *   A subtle price adjustment on the retailer’s side (within a pre-defined range) to subtly influence the third-party seller.
    *   If the Third-party Seller price *violates* the Parity Tolerance:
        *   Escalate to automated enforcement (price matching on retailer's side, temporary product de-listing, notification to seller with potential penalty details).

**3. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Input:**  Historical enforcement data (success/failure of soft nudges/enforcement actions), Third-party Seller’s responsiveness, Product Margin.
*   **Process:** A reinforcement learning agent dynamically adjusts the Parity Tolerance based on overall effectiveness. For example:
    *   If soft nudges consistently resolve price discrepancies, *increase* the Parity Tolerance slightly to allow for more flexibility.
    *   If enforcement actions are frequent, *decrease* the Parity Tolerance to tighten control.
    *   High-margin products can tolerate a tighter parity control than low-margin products.

**4.  AI-Driven ‘Seller Behavior Profiling’**

*   **Input:**  Historical pricing data, responsiveness to nudges, past violations, product categories.
*   **Process:** Machine learning model to identify ‘risk profiles’ for each third-party seller (e.g., “Consistent Violator”, “Occasional Slip-up”, “Highly Cooperative”).  The proactive parity adjustment system will tailor its interventions based on the seller’s risk profile.

**Pseudocode – Core Logic**

```
function check_parity(retailer_price, seller_price, shadow_price, confidence_interval, parity_tolerance, seller_risk_profile) {

  if (abs(seller_price - retailer_price) <= parity_tolerance) {
    return "Parity Maintained"
  }

  if (seller_price is approaching parity boundary AND seller_risk_profile == "Highly Cooperative") {
    send_soft_nudge(seller_id, product_id)
    return "Soft Nudge Sent"
  }

  if (seller_price violates parity boundary AND seller_risk_profile == "Consistent Violator") {
    enforce_price_match(product_id)
    return "Price Match Enforced"
  }

  //Default enforcement
  enforce_price_match(product_id)
  return "Price Match Enforced"
}
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Real-time pricing feeds from retailer and third-party channels.
*   Historical sales data.
*   Competitor pricing data.
*   Promotional calendars.
*   Third-party seller performance data (responsiveness, violation history).
