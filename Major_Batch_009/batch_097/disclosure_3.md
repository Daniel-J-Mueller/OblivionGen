## Dynamic Foveated Rendering with Predictive Fragment Streaming

**Concept:** Extend the selective decoding of non-viewed sections by predicting future foveated rendering needs and pre-streaming relevant fragments *before* the user's gaze shifts. This goes beyond merely decoding reference frames; it anticipates *which* full fragments (containing both reference and non-reference data) will become crucial, minimizing latency when the user looks directly at them.

**Specifications:**

**1. Gaze Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Head & Eye Tracking Data (position, velocity, acceleration), User Movement Data (from IMUs or external tracking), Scene Geometry (depth map, object boundaries), Historical Gaze Data (user's typical viewing patterns).
*   **Processing:** Kalman Filter/RNN-based prediction algorithm. Predicts the most likely gaze point within a defined timeframe (e.g., 100-200ms). Output: Predicted Gaze Point (3D coordinates) & Confidence Level.
*   **Parameters:** Prediction Horizon (adjustable), Confidence Threshold (determines when to initiate pre-streaming), Smoothing Factor (Kalman filter).

**2. Fragment Prioritization & Streaming Manager:**

*   **Input:** Predicted Gaze Point, Scene Geometry, Current Frame Data, Bandwidth Availability.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Fragment Identification:** Determine which spatial fragments (tiles/patches) of the scene intersect the predicted gaze point.  Fragments should be sized for efficient streaming and rendering (e.g., 256x256 or 512x512 pixels).
    *   **Priority Assignment:**  Assign priorities based on:
        *   **Proximity to Predicted Gaze:** Closer fragments = higher priority.
        *   **Rendering Importance:** Fragments containing critical detail (e.g., faces, text) = higher priority. This can be determined via semantic segmentation or depth analysis.
        *   **Current Streaming Status:** Fragments already in memory or partially streamed = lower priority.
    *   **Streaming Request Generation:** Generate requests for prioritized fragments, specifying:
        *   Fragment ID
        *   Desired Quality Level (LOD - Level of Detail)
        *   Compression Format
    *   **Bandwidth Management:** Dynamically adjust quality levels and fragment requests based on available bandwidth.  Prioritize higher-priority fragments if bandwidth is limited.

**3. Fragment Cache & Rendering Pipeline Integration:**

*   **Fragment Cache:** A multi-tiered cache (RAM + SSD/NVMe) to store pre-streamed fragments.  Cache eviction policy based on Least Recently Used (LRU) or a more sophisticated algorithm that considers rendering importance.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:**
    *   When a new frame is rendered, the rendering engine prioritizes the retrieval of fragments from the cache.
    *   If a required fragment is not in the cache, it is fetched from the streaming server in the background.
    *   The rendering engine blends pre-rendered fragments with newly rendered ones to minimize visual artifacts.

**Pseudocode (Fragment Prioritization):**

```
function prioritizeFragments(predictedGazePoint, sceneGeometry, currentFrameData, bandwidth):
  fragmentList = getFragmentsIntersectingPoint(predictedGazePoint, sceneGeometry)
  for fragment in fragmentList:
    priority = 0
    distance = distanceBetween(predictedGazePoint, fragment.center)
    priority += 100 / distance  // Proximity

    if fragment.containsCriticalDetail(currentFrameData):
      priority += 50  // Detail

    if fragment.isAlreadyCached():
      priority -= 20  // Cache Hit

    fragment.priority = priority
  sort(fragmentList, by=priority, descending=True)
  return fragmentList
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-bandwidth network connection (Wi-Fi 6E or 5G).
*   Low-latency eye tracking system.
*   Powerful GPU for rendering.
*   Fast storage (NVMe SSD).
*   Sufficient RAM for fragment caching.
