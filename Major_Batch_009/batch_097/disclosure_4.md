## Haptic-Augmented Object Recognition System

**System Overview:** A wearable system combining optical object recognition with localized haptic feedback to aid in identification and manipulation, particularly for users with visual impairments or in low-light/high-distraction environments. Extends the concepts of wearable scanning into active, tactile exploration.

**Core Components:**

*   **Wearable Scanning Unit:** A glove-based system, building on the ring/hand-mounted optical element from the source patent. Housing a miniaturized time-of-flight (ToF) sensor *in addition* to a standard camera. The ToF provides depth information, creating a 3D point cloud of the scanned object.
*   **Haptic Feedback Array:** A network of micro-actuators embedded within the glove, covering the palmar surface and fingertips. These actuators are capable of generating localized vibrations, pressure changes, and even subtle temperature variations.
*   **Processing Unit:** A low-power, wearable computer (wrist or upper arm-mounted) running object recognition algorithms and haptic feedback control software.
*   **Power Supply:** Rechargeable battery integrated into the wrist/arm unit.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Scanning Initiation:** User initiates a scan via a gesture or button press on the glove.
2.  **Data Acquisition:** The ToF sensor and camera capture depth and visual data of the object being touched.
3.  **Object Recognition:** The processing unit analyzes the captured data using machine learning models trained to identify objects and features.
4.  **Feature Mapping:** Key features of the object (shape, texture, edges) are mapped to specific locations on the user’s hand.
5.  **Haptic Rendering:** The haptic feedback array generates localized vibrations or pressure changes corresponding to the identified features. For instance:
    *   Edges and corners are represented by sharp, localized vibrations.
    *   Texture is simulated through varying vibration frequency and intensity.
    *   Object shape is conveyed via patterns of pressure across the palm.
6.  **User Exploration:** The user can "feel" the object’s shape, texture, and features without visually inspecting it.
7.  **Optional Audio Feedback:** Supplement haptic feedback with descriptive audio cues ("bottle," "key," "rough texture").

**Pseudocode (Haptic Rendering):**

```
FUNCTION RenderHapticFeedback(objectData)

    // objectData contains: shape, texture, edges, features

    FOR EACH edge IN objectData.edges
        activateHapticActuator(edge.location, "sharpVibration")

    FOR EACH feature IN objectData.features
        // map feature to hand location
        location = mapFeatureToHand(feature)
        activateHapticActuator(location, feature.texture)

    FOR EACH point IN objectData.shape
        // map 3D point to hand location
        location = mapPointToHand(point)
        applyPressure(location, point.depth)

    END FUNCTION

FUNCTION mapPointToHand(point3D)
    // Algorithm to translate 3D coordinates to corresponding points on the glove
    // Consider hand size, orientation, and calibration data
    RETURN handLocation
END FUNCTION
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Dynamic Object Learning:** The system could learn new objects based on user input and feedback.
*   **Gesture Recognition:** Integrate gesture recognition to allow for intuitive control of the system.
*   **Multi-Object Scanning:** Capability to scan and identify multiple objects simultaneously.
*   **Integration with AR/VR:** Combine haptic feedback with augmented or virtual reality displays to enhance the user experience.
*   **Material Identification:** Utilizing spectral analysis in conjunction with the optical scanner to identify the material composition of the object.
