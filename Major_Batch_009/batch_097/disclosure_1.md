## Dynamic Obstacle Resonance Mapping & Predictive Avoidance

**Concept:** Extend the occupancy map beyond static inflation to incorporate *resonant frequency* analysis of obstacles and predict their likely movement/instability. This allows for not just avoidance of current obstacles but proactive anticipation of potential collapses, shifting loads, or even intentionally moved objects.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Augmentation:**

*   **Micro-Doppler Radar Array:** Integrate a small array of micro-Doppler radar sensors alongside the camera. These sensors detect subtle movements and vibrations within obstacles, providing data beyond static shape.  Frequency range: 24-77 GHz. Array resolution: 8x8 elements.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** A high-precision IMU mounted on the AMD to accurately track its own movement and compensate for vibrations during radar/camera data acquisition.
*   **Edge TPU/GPU:** Dedicated processing unit for real-time resonant frequency analysis and predictive modeling.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Resonance Signature Database:** A database storing resonant frequency signatures for common materials (wood, metal, plastic, glass, etc.) and structural configurations (columns, beams, stacks).  This database will be populated through initial calibration and ongoing learning.
*   **Obstacle Vibration Analysis Module:** Processes data from the micro-Doppler radar, extracting dominant frequencies and amplitudes of vibration within detected obstacles.  Algorithm: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied to radar returns, followed by peak detection and frequency tracking.
*   **Instability Prediction Engine:**  Compares the extracted vibration frequencies to the Resonance Signature Database. If a significant match is found, the engine calculates a probability of instability or movement based on amplitude, duration, and historical data. Machine Learning Algorithm: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on simulated and real-world obstacle failure data.
*   **Dynamic Risk Mapping:** Overlay a ‘risk map’ onto the occupancy map.  Areas with high instability probability are highlighted, and path planning algorithms prioritize avoidance of these areas, even if they are currently stationary.  Risk levels represented as a continuous spectrum (0-1) overlaid on the occupancy grid.
*   **Predictive Path Planning:** The path planner doesn't just avoid current obstacles but proactively anticipates potential instability. It recalculates paths based on the dynamic risk map, creating buffer zones around high-risk areas and continuously monitoring for changes in obstacle behavior. Algorithm:  A* search with a cost function that incorporates both distance and risk level.

**3. Data Flow & Processing:**

1.  Camera & Radar acquire data simultaneously.
2.  Occupancy map created as in the base patent.
3.  Radar data processed to identify vibration frequencies.
4.  Instability Prediction Engine analyzes frequencies against the Resonance Signature Database.
5.  Dynamic Risk Map generated based on instability probability.
6.  Path Planner incorporates risk levels into path calculations.
7.  AMD moves along the dynamically adjusted path, continuously monitoring for changes in obstacle behavior.

**4. Pseudocode (Path Planning):**

```
function CalculatePath(start, goal, occupancyMap, riskMap):
    openSet = {start}
    closedSet = {}

    while openSet is not empty:
        current = node in openSet with lowest fScore (fScore = gScore + hScore)

        if current == goal:
            return reconstructPath(cameFrom, current)

        openSet.remove(current)
        closedSet.add(current)

        for neighbor in getNeighbors(current):
            if neighbor in closedSet:
                continue

            tentative_gScore = gScore[current] + distance(current, neighbor) + riskPenalty(neighbor)

            if neighbor not in openSet or tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]:
                cameFrom[neighbor] = current
                gScore[neighbor] = tentative_gScore
                fScore[neighbor] = tentative_gScore + heuristicCost(neighbor, goal)
                if neighbor not in openSet:
                    openSet.add(neighbor)

    return null // No path found

function riskPenalty(cell):
    return riskMap[cell] * weightFactor // weightFactor adjusts the importance of risk
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static obstacle avoidance to *predictive* avoidance based on the physical properties and potential instability of obstacles, greatly enhancing safety and navigation in dynamic environments. It doesn’t just see what *is*, but what *could be*.
