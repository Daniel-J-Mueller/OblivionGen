## Dynamic Data Provenance & Replay for Stream Processing

**Specification:** A system extending automated resource scaling with detailed data lineage tracking and the ability to replay data streams from specific points in time, enabling proactive anomaly detection and ‘what-if’ analysis.

**Core Concept:**  The existing system focuses on *reacting* to resource constraints. This builds on that by proactively analyzing data characteristics to *predict* scaling needs *before* they become problems, and by offering the capability to rewind and re-process data for debugging or model retraining without restarting the entire pipeline.

**Components:**

1.  **Data Provenance Module:** Integrated into each compute node, this module captures metadata about each data record. Metadata includes:
    *   Timestamp of record creation.
    *   Source of the data (specific sensor, API, etc.).
    *   Transformations applied to the data at each processing stage.
    *   Compute node ID where each transformation occurred.
    *   A cryptographic hash of the data record *before* and *after* each transformation – ensuring data integrity.

2.  **Historical Data Buffer:** A distributed, time-series database storing snapshots of data provenance metadata *and* the data itself (or a configurable sampling rate).  Data retention policies are configurable.  This isn’t a full data archive, but a buffer sufficient for replay and analysis within a defined window.

3.  **Predictive Scaling Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical data provenance and resource utilization metrics.  This engine predicts future resource needs based on anticipated data volume, data complexity (measured by the number of transformations performed), and data velocity.

4.  **Replay & Analysis Interface:** Allows users to define a time window, a data source, and a replay starting point. The system reconstructs the data stream, applies the processing function from that point forward, and presents the results.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Scaling Engine):**

```
function predict_resource_needs(historical_data, current_data_velocity, current_data_complexity) {
    // 1. Feature Extraction
    features = extract_features(historical_data, current_data_velocity, current_data_complexity);

    // 2. Model Prediction
    predicted_resource_utilization = model.predict(features);

    // 3. Resource Allocation
    required_resources = calculate_resources(predicted_resource_utilization, safety_margin);

    return required_resources;
}

function extract_features(historical_data, current_data_velocity, current_data_complexity) {
    // Extract features such as:
    // - Average data velocity over the past hour/day
    // - Average data complexity (number of transformations)
    // - Peak resource utilization
    // - Rate of change in data velocity
    // - Seasonal patterns in data velocity
    // Return a feature vector
}

function calculate_resources(predicted_resource_utilization, safety_margin) {
    // Calculate the number of compute nodes required
    // based on the predicted resource utilization and a safety margin
}
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  Data flows through the stream processing pipeline.
2.  The Data Provenance Module captures metadata at each stage.
3.  The Historical Data Buffer stores metadata and sampled data.
4.  The Predictive Scaling Engine periodically analyzes historical data and predicts future resource needs.
5.  The system automatically scales resources up or down based on the predictions.
6.  Users can use the Replay & Analysis Interface to rewind and re-process data streams for debugging or model retraining.
