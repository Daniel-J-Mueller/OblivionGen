**Secure Identity Bridging with Ephemeral Credentials & Contextual Attestation**

**Specification:** A system to dynamically generate and vouch for user identities *across* services, prioritizing minimal data sharing and leveraging device attestation for heightened security.  Instead of a temporary alternate identifier *replacing* the user service identifier, it acts as a “proof-of-association” token, valid only within a very narrow, time-bound context.

**Components:**

*   **Identity Broker (IB):**  Central authority responsible for initial user authentication (e.g., via password, biometrics, MFA) and issuing initial, short-lived "Base Credentials" (BC). The BC contains minimal Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - essentially a unique, randomly generated ID.
*   **Service Connector (SC):**  Software module embedded within or interfacing with both the originating service (where the user initially authenticates) and the destination resource.  The SC handles the exchange of credentials and requests.
*   **Device Attestation Module (DAM):**  Hardware or software component verifying the trustworthiness of the user’s device.  This could be based on TPM, Secure Enclave, or similar technologies.
*   **Contextual Attestation Token (CAT):** The core innovation. A cryptographically signed token, generated by the SC, containing:
    *   A hash of the BC.
    *   A timestamp (with limited validity window - e.g., 60 seconds).
    *   A ‘Purpose’ field, defining the *specific* action the token authorizes (e.g., “Access Game Level 3”, “Initiate Video Stream”, "Authorize Payment").
    *   A digitally signed attestation from the DAM, proving the device’s integrity.

**Workflow:**

1.  **User Authentication:** User authenticates with the originating service. Service issues BC.
2.  **CAT Request:**  When the user attempts to interact with the resource, the SC requests a CAT from the originating service, providing the requested action (Purpose).
3.  **Originating Service Validation & CAT Generation:** The originating service verifies the user’s BC is still valid.  If valid, the service requests an attestation from the DAM.  The service then generates the CAT, digitally signing it with its private key.
4.  **CAT Transmission:** The SC transmits the CAT to the resource.
5.  **Resource Validation:** The resource verifies the CAT's signature using the originating service’s public key. It then verifies the DAM attestation and checks the timestamp to ensure the token is within its validity window.  Finally, it validates that the requested action (Purpose) matches its expectations.
6.  **Access Granted/Denied:** Based on successful validation, the resource grants or denies access.

**Pseudocode (Resource-Side Validation):**

```
function validateCAT(CAT):
  try:
    signature = CAT.signature
    originatingServicePublicKey = getOriginatingServicePublicKey(CAT.issuer)
    isValidSignature = verifySignature(CAT, signature, originatingServicePublicKey)
    if not isValidSignature:
      return false

    deviceAttestation = CAT.deviceAttestation
    isDeviceTrusted = verifyDeviceAttestation(deviceAttestation)
    if not isDeviceTrusted:
      return false

    timestamp = CAT.timestamp
    currentTime = getCurrentTime()
    if (currentTime < timestamp) or (currentTime > (timestamp + tokenValidityWindow)):
      return false

    requestedAction = CAT.purpose
    allowedActions = getResourceAllowedActions()  // Actions this resource supports
    if not (requestedAction in allowedActions):
      return false

    return true

  catch Exception as e:
    // Log error
    return false
```

**Innovation Highlights:**

*   **Minimal Data Sharing:** No user service identifiers are directly shared with the resource.
*   **Contextual Authorization:**  The CAT restricts access to a specific action, preventing broader privilege escalation.
*   **Device Integrity:** DAM attestation adds a strong layer of security.
*   **Ephemeral Nature:** The short validity window of the CAT limits the impact of compromise.
*   **Decoupled Identity:** The system is designed to be independent of specific identity providers.
