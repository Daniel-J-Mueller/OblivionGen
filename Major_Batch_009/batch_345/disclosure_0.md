## Dynamic Collection Re-Allocation & Predictive Labor Adjustment

**Concept:** The existing system tracks unit collections and throughput. This expands on that by *proactively* re-allocating units between collections *before* bottlenecks occur, coupled with a predictive labor adjustment system. This moves beyond reacting to throughput issues to *preventing* them, optimizing for a target shipping rate.

**Specs:**

*   **Collection Fluidity Parameter (CFP):** A configurable parameter for each collection, defining its tolerance for units being temporarily shifted to adjacent collections. Lower CFP = higher stability, higher CFP = greater responsiveness.
*   **Predictive Throughput Engine (PTE):** This module analyzes historical data *and* current order profiles to forecast throughput needs for each downstream process *before* the order hits the system. It outputs predicted bottlenecks.
*   **Collection Balancing Algorithm (CBA):**  Based on PTE output and CFP values, the CBA dynamically re-allocates units between collections *within* the storage buffer.  Re-allocation prioritizes preventing predicted downstream bottlenecks. Units arenâ€™t *moved* physically until a necessary moment. Instead, newly inducted units are *directed* to alternate collections based on real-time data.
*   **Labor Prediction Module (LPM):**  Integrates with the CBA & PTE. Based on predicted throughput needs *and* the degree of collection re-allocation, the LPM recommends adjustments to labor staffing levels for upstream and downstream processes.
*   **Real-time Visualization:** A dashboard displaying:
    *   Current collection levels
    *   CFP values for each collection
    *   PTE predictions
    *   CBA re-allocation directives
    *   LPM labor recommendations

**Pseudocode (CBA Core):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateCollectionShift(CollectionA, CollectionB, PredictedBottleneck, CFP_A, CFP_B):
  // CollectionA: Collection experiencing potential overload
  // CollectionB: Adjacent collection with available capacity
  // PredictedBottleneck: Severity of the predicted bottleneck (0-100)
  // CFP_A, CFP_B: Collection Fluidity Parameters
  
  ShiftAmount = 0
  
  IF PredictedBottleneck > 50:
    ShiftAmount = Min(CollectionA.Capacity * 0.2, CollectionB.AvailableCapacity) // Shift up to 20% of A or B's capacity
    
  IF ShiftAmount > 0 AND (CollectionA.CFP > CFP_A OR CollectionB.CFP > CFP_B):
    // Fluidity parameters aren't allowing shift, notify supervisor
    DisplayAlert("Collection Shift Blocked: CFP Constraints")
    
  RETURN ShiftAmount

FUNCTION DirectNewUnits(Unit, PredictedCollection, AlternateCollection):
  // Direct newly inducted units.
  IF PredictedCollection == AlternateCollection:
    //Direct to predicted collection
    StoreUnit(Unit, PredictedCollection)
  ELSE:
    StoreUnit(Unit, AlternateCollection)
```

**System Integration:**

1.  PTE analyzes incoming orders and generates throughput predictions.
2.  CBA assesses predicted bottlenecks and calculates required collection shifts.
3.  CBA modifies induction directives to shift new units to optimal collections.
4.  LPM predicts labor needs based on shifted workloads and provides recommendations to floor supervisors.
5.  Real-time visualization provides a comprehensive overview of the system.
