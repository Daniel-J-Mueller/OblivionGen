## Secure Attestation of Virtual Machine Internal State

**Concept:** Extend the secure interface to not just authorize *operations* on VMs, but to cryptographically attest to the *internal state* of a VM at a specific point in time, without revealing the data itself. This enables verifiable trust in VM integrity, useful for security audits, compliance, and even decentralized finance applications running within VMs.

**Specs:**

1.  **VM State Hash Generation:** Within the hypervisor, implement a process to generate a cryptographic hash of a *defined subset* of VM memory. This subset is configurable (e.g., critical kernel structures, sensitive data regions).  The hash function MUST be configurable (SHA256, BLAKE3, etc.).

2.  **Secure Enclave Integration:** Utilize a secure enclave (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) to protect a key used for signing the VM state hash.  This key is *separate* from the key used for authorizing privileged operations.

3.  **Attestation Request Format:** Define a new request format that includes:
    *   VM Identifier (UUID or similar)
    *   Timestamp
    *   Hash Algorithm Identifier
    *   Configurable Subset Identifier (identifies the memory regions included in the hash)
    *   Signature (of the above data, signed by the enclave key)

4.  **Attestation Verification:** A remote verifier (e.g., a security auditor, a smart contract) receives the attestation request. It:
    *   Verifies the signature using the public key associated with the enclave.
    *   Checks the timestamp against a tolerance window.
    *   Validates the configured subset identifier to ensure it's within an approved set.

5.  **Zero-Knowledge Proof Integration (Optional):** To minimize information leakage, integrate a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) scheme. Instead of sending the hash directly, the VM generates a proof that *a certain property* holds true for the VM state *without revealing the state itself*.  Example:  "The VM's root filesystem is read-only".

6.  **API Extension:** Add a new API endpoint to handle attestation requests.  This endpoint:
    *   Initiates the hash generation process within the VM.
    *   Signs the request with the enclave key.
    *   Returns the signed attestation request to the client.

**Pseudocode (API Handler):**

```
function HandleAttestationRequest(request):
  // Verify request format and permissions

  vm_id = request.vm_id
  subset_id = request.subset_id
  timestamp = request.timestamp

  // Check timestamp validity

  // Trigger VM state hash generation within the hypervisor
  hash = GenerateVMStateHash(vm_id, subset_id)

  // Sign the hash and request data
  signature = SignData(hash + request.vm_id + request.timestamp, enclave_private_key)

  // Create attestation response
  response = {
    "vm_id": request.vm_id,
    "timestamp": request.timestamp,
    "hash": hash,
    "signature": signature
  }

  return response
```

**Hardware Dependencies:** Secure enclave (Intel SGX, AMD SEV).

**Security Considerations:**  Enclave key protection is paramount.  Regular key rotation is recommended.  Careful consideration must be given to the selection of memory regions to include in the hash to balance security and performance.
