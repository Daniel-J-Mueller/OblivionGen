## Adaptive Request Synthesis & Mutation

**Concept:** Extend the replay system to not only replay captured requests but to *synthesize* new, mutated requests based on existing data, creating a dynamic and evolving load test. This addresses scenarios not covered by historical data (new features, unexpected user behavior) and can proactively identify vulnerabilities.

**Specifications:**

**1. Synthesis Engine:**

*   **Input:** Production request data (as stored in the existing data store), metadata (tags, timing), test plan parameters (mutation rate, feature emphasis, edge case focus).
*   **Process:**
    *   Request Parsing: Deconstructs captured requests into constituent parts (headers, body parameters, URLs, etc.).
    *   Component Selection: Chooses components for mutation. The selection process is weighted by the test plan parameters (e.g., prioritize mutation of parameters related to recently deployed features).
    *   Mutation Operators: Applies a suite of mutation operators:
        *   Parameter Value Variation: Randomly alter numeric or string parameter values within defined ranges.
        *   Boundary Value Analysis: Generate requests with parameter values at the boundaries of valid ranges.
        *   Format Shifting: Convert parameter data types (e.g., string to integer).
        *   Missing Parameter Injection:  Attempt requests *without* specific parameters.
        *   Header Manipulation: Modify or add headers.
        *   URL Path Variation: Introduce slight changes to URL paths (e.g., adding or removing query parameters).
    *   Validity Check: Filters out generated requests that are obviously invalid (e.g., malformed URLs). A lightweight validation function is applied.
*   **Output:** A stream of synthesized requests.

**2.  Mutation Rate Control & Scheduling:**

*   **Test Plan Parameter:** ‘Mutation Factor’ – a percentage representing the proportion of requests that should be synthesized vs. replayed from the historical data.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  The Mutation Factor can be dynamically adjusted during test execution based on observed system behavior.  For example:
    *   If the system exhibits stable behavior, increase the Mutation Factor to explore a wider range of inputs.
    *   If errors are detected, decrease the Mutation Factor and focus on replaying known good requests.

**3.  Feedback Loop & Error Correlation:**

*   **Error Tracking:**  Record errors encountered during the replay of both historical and synthesized requests.
*   **Mutation Correlation:**  Attempt to correlate errors with specific mutation operators or parameter values used to generate the requests. This can help identify vulnerabilities or design flaws.
*   **Automated Regression:** After a production deployment, automatically replay identified “problematic” mutations to verify fixes.

**4.  Implementation Notes:**

*   The Synthesis Engine should be implemented as a separate microservice to allow for independent scaling and updates.
*   The mutation operators should be configurable via a JSON-based schema.
*   The system should support different data formats (JSON, XML, etc.).
*   Utilize a queuing system (like Kafka) to distribute synthesized requests to the workers.

**Pseudocode (Synthesis Engine - simplified):**

```
function synthesize_request(request_data, test_plan):
    parsed_request = parse_request(request_data)
    mutation_options = get_mutation_options(test_plan)

    for option in mutation_options:
        mutated_component = apply_mutation(parsed_request, option)
        if is_valid(mutated_component):
            parsed_request = mutated_component

    return build_request(parsed_request)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased test coverage.
*   Proactive vulnerability identification.
*   Better understanding of system behavior under unexpected conditions.
*   Improved software quality.
