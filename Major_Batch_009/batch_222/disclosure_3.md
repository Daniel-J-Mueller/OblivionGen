## Autonomous Swarm Coordination via Predictive Trajectory Broadcasting

**Concept:** Expand upon direct message exchange between UAVs to incorporate predictive trajectory broadcasting, enabling proactive collision avoidance and task optimization within a swarm. Instead of *reacting* to messages indicating changes, UAVs *anticipate* potential conflicts and opportunities.

**Specs:**

*   **Trajectory Prediction Module:** Each UAV possesses a local trajectory prediction module. This module estimates the future path of nearby UAVs based on received messages (current position, velocity, planned tasks) and historical movement data. Kalman filtering or similar techniques should be employed to minimize prediction error.
*   **Broadcast Interval:** UAVs broadcast their *predicted* trajectory (next 60-120 seconds) at a rate of 2-5 Hz. This isn't just current state, it’s *where they intend to be*.
*   **Conflict Probability Assessment:** Upon receiving predicted trajectories, each UAV calculates a "conflict probability" score for each overlapping trajectory segment.  Factors include:
    *   Minimum predicted distance.
    *   Relative velocity.
    *   Trajectory uncertainty (based on prediction error).
    *   Task priority (higher priority tasks maintain trajectory).
*   **Proactive Path Adjustment:** If the conflict probability exceeds a threshold, the UAV automatically initiates a path adjustment. The adjustment aims to:
    *   Maintain task completion.
    *   Minimize deviation from the original path.
    *   Maximize separation from other UAVs.
    *   Utilize a pre-defined set of ‘maneuver templates’ (e.g., slight altitude change, gentle lateral shift).
*   **Cooperative Re-Planning:**  If a path adjustment significantly impacts task completion, the UAV broadcasts a "re-planning request" to nearby UAVs.  This initiates a distributed optimization process where UAVs negotiate task assignments to minimize overall swarm disruption.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Conflict probability thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on swarm density, environmental conditions (e.g., wind gusts), and the criticality of ongoing tasks.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Utilize a low-latency, high-bandwidth communication protocol (e.g., dedicated 802.11ad channel, or custom mesh network) to support frequent trajectory broadcasts.
*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from onboard sensors (e.g., LiDAR, cameras) to validate predicted trajectories and identify unexpected obstacles.

**Pseudocode (Conflict Probability Calculation):**

```
function calculate_conflict_probability(predicted_trajectory_1, predicted_trajectory_2):
  min_distance = calculate_min_distance(predicted_trajectory_1, predicted_trajectory_2)
  relative_velocity = calculate_relative_velocity(predicted_trajectory_1, predicted_trajectory_2)
  trajectory_uncertainty = estimate_trajectory_uncertainty(predicted_trajectory_1, predicted_trajectory_2)

  # Weighting factors (tunable parameters)
  distance_weight = 0.5
  velocity_weight = 0.3
  uncertainty_weight = 0.2

  # Normalize values
  normalized_distance = 1 / (min_distance + 0.1)  # Invert distance (lower is better)
  normalized_velocity = 1 / (abs(relative_velocity) + 0.1) # Invert velocity (lower is better)
  normalized_uncertainty = 1 / (trajectory_uncertainty + 0.1) # Invert uncertainty (lower is better)

  conflict_probability = (distance_weight * normalized_distance) + (velocity_weight * normalized_velocity) + (uncertainty_weight * normalized_uncertainty)

  return conflict_probability
```
