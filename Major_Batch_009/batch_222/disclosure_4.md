## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Personalized Intent Filtering

**Concept:** Extend device-directed speech detection beyond a single device, creating localized acoustic zones with individualized intent filtering. Imagine a home or office where each person's speech triggers *only* relevant device responses within their immediate vicinity, while simultaneously *blocking* irrelevant commands directed at others' devices.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Each device (smart speaker, display, etc.) equipped with a high-density microphone array (minimum 8 elements) for accurate sound source localization and beamforming.
*   **Ultrasonic Beacons:** Small, low-power ultrasonic beacons worn by or placed near individuals. These beacons transmit unique identifiers.
*   **Edge Processing Unit:** Each device must contain a dedicated edge processing unit capable of running advanced signal processing and machine learning models.
*   **Zonal Speakers:** Speakers within each device capable of directional audio output.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Acoustic Zone Mapping:** Upon initial setup, the system performs acoustic mapping of the environment, creating virtual zones. User location is determined via ultrasonic beacon detection or, if unavailable, via device-based localization methods (e.g., camera, Bluetooth proximity).
*   **Speech Source Localization:** The microphone array performs real-time speech source localization, determining the direction and distance of the speaker.
*   **Speaker Identification:** The system identifies the speaker using a combination of ultrasonic beacon detection and voice recognition. The ultrasonic beacon serves as the primary identifier, with voice recognition acting as a secondary confirmation.
*   **Intent Filtering Module:** This module is the core innovation. It comprises two sub-modules:
    *   **Personalized Intent Profile:** Each user has a personalized intent profile stored locally or in the cloud. This profile defines the types of commands and actions the user is likely to request. (e.g., "play music", "set timer", "control lights").
    *   **Contextual Filtering:** This filters the user's voice command and compares it against the personalized intent profile. Irrelevant commands are rejected.
*   **Adaptive Beamforming:** The system employs adaptive beamforming to focus audio capture on the identified speaker and suppress noise and interference from other sources.
*   **Directional Audio Output:**  The zonal speakers are used to output responses *only* to the identified speaker, further enhancing privacy and reducing interference.

**3. Pseudocode (Intent Filtering):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessSpeech(audioData, speakerID):

  // 1. Speech-to-Text
  text = SpeechToText(audioData)

  // 2. Intent Extraction
  intent = IntentExtraction(text)

  // 3. Load Personalized Intent Profile
  profile = LoadIntentProfile(speakerID)

  // 4. Filter Intent based on Profile
  IF intent NOT IN profile:
    REJECT intent  // Block irrelevant commands
    RETURN "Command not recognized"
  ENDIF

  // 5. Process Valid Intent
  PerformAction(intent, speakerID)

  RETURN "Action completed"
```

**4.  Advanced Considerations:**

*   **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:** The system should dynamically adjust zone boundaries based on user movement and changes in the environment.
*   **Multi-User Scenarios:** The system should seamlessly handle scenarios with multiple users in the same zone, prioritizing commands based on proximity and intent.
*   **Privacy Enhancements:** All audio data should be processed locally whenever possible, with minimal data transmitted to the cloud.  Secure authentication and encryption should be used to protect user privacy.
*    **Ambient Awareness:** Integrating other sensor data (e.g., cameras, motion sensors) to refine intent filtering and provide more context-aware responses. For example, if a user is cooking, the system might prioritize commands related to timers and recipes.
