## Adaptive Resource Prefetching via Predictive Client State

**Concept:** Leverage client-side state prediction – not just network conditions – to proactively prefetch resources *before* they are explicitly requested, tailoring prefetching based on anticipated user behavior.  This goes beyond simple caching or predictive downloads; it anticipates *sequences* of interactions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Client-Side State Vector:**

*   **Data Points:**
    *   Current URL/Page ID
    *   Time spent on current page
    *   Scroll depth/percentage
    *   Mouse movement patterns (heatmaps – aggregated locally)
    *   Keystroke patterns (analyzed locally for intent – e.g., typing in a search box)
    *   Recent interaction history (last 5-10 actions – clicks, scrolls, form entries)
    *   Device type & screen size
    *   Network connectivity (current & historical)
*   **Vector Generation:**  A lightweight, local process that continuously updates the state vector every 50-100ms.  Vector is a normalized floating-point array.
*   **Privacy:**  All data remains local to the device. No transmission of raw data. Only the *derived* prediction is sent (see section 2).

**2. Prediction Engine (Client-Side):**

*   **Model:**  A small, embedded machine learning model (e.g., a simplified LSTM or a feedforward neural network).  Model is trained *off-line* and updated via infrequent over-the-air updates.
*   **Input:**  The Client-Side State Vector.
*   **Output:**  A probability distribution over a set of *potential next resources*. Resources are identified by a unique key (URL fragment, asset hash, etc.). Output is a floating-point array representing probabilities.
*   **Threshold:** A configurable probability threshold. Only resources with a probability above the threshold are considered for prefetching.

**3. Prefetching Mechanism (Client-Side):**

*   **Resource Selection:**  Select the top *N* resources from the prediction engine's output (configurable N).
*   **Prefetch Initiation:** Initiate HTTP/3 requests for the selected resources. Requests include a special header (e.g., `X-Prefetch: true`) to indicate prefetching.
*   **Cache Control:** Resources are stored in the browser cache with appropriate cache control headers.
*   **Request Prioritization:** Prefetch requests are given lower priority than user-initiated requests to avoid impacting responsiveness.

**4. Server-Side Handling:**

*   **Prefetch Header Recognition:**  The server recognizes the `X-Prefetch: true` header.
*   **Resource Delivery:** Deliver the requested resources with appropriate caching headers.
*   **Adaptive Response:**  The server can dynamically adjust resource delivery based on prefetch requests. For example, it could send a smaller, optimized version of the resource if the client is on a slow connection.

**5. Feedback Loop:**

*   **Client-Side Tracking:** The client tracks whether prefetched resources were actually used.
*   **Data Transmission:**  Aggregate, anonymized usage data is sent to the server (e.g., "resource X was prefetched and used within 2 seconds").
*   **Model Retraining:** The server uses the feedback data to retrain the prediction model and improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Every 50-100ms
UpdateClientStateVector()
PredictedResources = PredictNextResources(ClientStateVector)

// Select top N predicted resources
PrefetchCandidates = SelectTopN(PredictedResources, N)

// Initiate prefetch requests
For Each Resource in PrefetchCandidates:
    If Resource not already in cache:
        InitiateHttpRequest(Resource, Headers = {“X-Prefetch”: “true”})
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Beyond Network Prediction:** Focuses on anticipating *user behavior* in addition to network conditions.
*   **Client-Side Intelligence:** Moves prediction logic to the client for faster response and reduced server load.
*   **Adaptive Prefetching:** Dynamically adjusts prefetching based on user behavior and network conditions.
*   **Privacy-Preserving:** Keeps sensitive data local to the device.
