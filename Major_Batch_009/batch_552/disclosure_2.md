## Dynamic Content "Reputation" System

**Concept:** Extend the rule-based sandboxing to incorporate a dynamic reputation system for supplemental content sources, influencing not just *what* is blocked, but *how* aggressively.

**Specs:**

1.  **Reputation Database:** A globally maintained (but locally cached) database associating supplemental content sources (domains, specific scripts, etc.) with a reputation score. Scores range from -100 (malicious) to +100 (trusted). Initial scores are neutral (0).

2.  **Behavioral Analysis Engine:**  A server-side component monitoring supplemental content behavior across multiple client devices. This engine identifies patterns indicative of malicious activity (e.g., redirecting to phishing sites, excessive resource usage, attempts to inject code).

3.  **Reputation Adjustment:** The Behavioral Analysis Engine dynamically adjusts reputation scores based on observed behavior. Negative behavior lowers the score, positive behavior raises it.  Weighting can be applied based on the severity of the behavior. A 'decay' mechanism slowly reduces scores over time, requiring continued positive behavior to maintain trust.

4.  **Client-Side Rule Modification:** The client device retrieves the reputation score for supplemental content sources *before* loading content. The sandbox rules are *dynamically modified* based on this score.

    *   **High Reputation (75-100):** Minimal restrictions. Content loads normally.
    *   **Medium Reputation (25-74):** Standard sandbox rules apply (as in the original patent).
    *   **Low Reputation (0-24):** More aggressive restrictions. Content may be loaded in a heavily isolated environment (e.g., a dedicated web worker with limited access to the main page), subjected to increased monitoring, or displayed with warning messages.
    *   **Negative Reputation (-100 to -1):** Content is blocked entirely.

5.  **User Feedback Integration:** Allow users to report suspicious behavior from supplemental content.  This feedback influences reputation scores (with moderation to prevent abuse).

6.  **"Challenge" System:** For content sources with medium or low reputation, implement a "challenge" system. Before full execution, the content source must pass a lightweight test (e.g., solving a simple cryptographic puzzle, proving it's not a bot) to demonstrate it's legitimate.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Rule Application):**

```
function applySandboxRules(contentSource, reputationScore) {
  if (reputationScore >= 75) {
    // Minimal restrictions
    return defaultSandboxRules;
  } else if (reputationScore >= 25) {
    // Standard rules
    return standardSandboxRules;
  } else if (reputationScore >= 0) {
    // Aggressive rules
    let aggressiveRules = standardSandboxRules;
    aggressiveRules.isolationLevel = "high"; // Use a web worker
    aggressiveRules.monitoringFrequency = "increased";
    return aggressiveRules;
  } else {
    // Block completely
    return blockRules;
  }
}

// Example usage:
let contentSource = "example.com";
let reputationScore = getReputationScore(contentSource); // Retrieve from local cache or server
let sandboxRules = applySandboxRules(contentSource, reputationScore);
applyRulesToContent(contentSource, sandboxRules);
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   The server-side Behavioral Analysis Engine will require significant infrastructure to monitor content across a large user base.
*   Caching is critical for performance.  Reputation scores should be aggressively cached on the client and server.
*   The "challenge" system should be designed to be lightweight and non-intrusive to the user experience.
*   Consider using a decentralized reputation system (e.g., blockchain-based) to increase transparency and trust.
