## Adaptive Environmental Projection System

**Core Concept:** Extend gaze-tracking beyond device interaction to dynamically alter the surrounding physical environment – lighting, sound, even localized temperature – to enhance the user's focus and minimize external distractions. This builds on the patent’s gaze direction focus but moves *beyond* the device itself.

**System Components:**

*   **Gaze Tracking Module:** High-resolution, low-latency eye-tracking integrated into a wearable (glasses, headset, or potentially embedded in device screens). Must track both gaze *direction* and *pupil dilation/constriction* for cognitive load assessment.
*   **Environmental Control Unit (ECU):** A central hub controlling smart-home compatible devices – lights (RGB & intensity), speakers (directional audio), localized HVAC (small fans/heating elements), potentially even scent diffusers.
*   **Cognitive Load Analyzer:** Software module analyzing pupil dilation/constriction in conjunction with gaze tracking to estimate user’s cognitive load. High cognitive load = increased focus needed.
*   **Environmental Profile Database:**  Pre-defined and dynamically generated environmental profiles tailored to different task types (reading, coding, video conferencing, creative work, relaxation).  Profiles define optimal lighting, audio, temperature, and potentially scent settings.
*   **Adaptive Algorithm:**  The core logic that orchestrates the entire system.  It considers:
    *   Gaze direction (towards device vs. away)
    *   Cognitive load (from pupil analysis)
    *   Current task type (determined via device usage or user input)
    *   User preferences (stored in a profile)
    *   Ambient environmental conditions (light levels, noise)

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Load User Profile
Initialize Gaze Tracking Module
Connect to Environmental Control Unit
Set Baseline Ambient Conditions

// Main Loop
While (System Active) {
    GazeData = GetGazeData() // Returns: gazeDirection, pupilSize
    TaskType = GetCurrentTaskType() // Returns: Reading, Coding, Meeting, etc.
    CognitiveLoad = AnalyzeCognitiveLoad(GazeData.pupilSize) // Returns: Low, Medium, High

    If (GazeData.gazeDirection == "Towards Device") {
        // User is actively engaging with device
        Profile = GetEnvironmentalProfile(TaskType, CognitiveLoad)

        // Adjust Environment
        SetLighting(Profile.lighting)
        SetAudio(Profile.audio)
        SetTemperature(Profile.temperature)
        //Optional: SetScent(Profile.scent)
    } Else {
        // User's gaze is away, minimize disruption to others
        RestoreAmbientEnvironment() // Revert to baseline settings
    }
}
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Latency:**  End-to-end latency (gaze tracking to environmental adjustment) must be < 100ms to avoid perceptual disruption.
*   **Precision:** Gaze tracking accuracy: < 1 degree.
*   **Connectivity:**  Wireless communication (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) between all components.
*   **Power:**  Wearable device battery life: > 8 hours.
*   **Security:**  Secure communication channels to protect user data and prevent unauthorized control.
*   **Customization:**  Users should be able to create and customize environmental profiles based on their individual preferences.
*   **API:** Open API for integration with third-party applications and smart home ecosystems.
*   **Calibration:** Automatic calibration of gaze tracking and environmental sensors.



This isn’t merely a “low distraction interface”, it’s a dynamically adapting *environment* tailored to the user’s cognitive state and task, extending beyond the device itself and creating a truly immersive and focused workspace.  The system anticipates needs rather than simply reacting to gaze direction.
