## Acoustic Holography & Personalized Sound Fields

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Multi-element microphone array (64+ elements) integrated into a wearable headset or stationary device. Array geometry: spherical or near-spherical for 360° capture.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance embedded system (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Orin) with dedicated DSP/FPGA acceleration for real-time signal processing.
*   **Transducer Array:** Phased array of miniature speakers (256+ elements) embedded in the headset or surrounding environment.  Each speaker must have individual amplitude and phase control.
*   **Environmental Mapping:** Integrated depth sensor (LiDAR or structured light) and RGB camera for creating a 3D model of the environment. This model is used to identify surfaces and obstacles.
*   **User Profile Database:** Storage for user-specific acoustic profiles. Includes head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), preferred sound characteristics, and sensitivity to specific frequencies.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Scene Capture:** The microphone array captures the ambient sound field.
2.  **Acoustic Holography:** Apply acoustic holography techniques to reconstruct the sound field in 3D. This creates a ‘sound map’ of the environment.
3.  **Sound Source Identification & Classification:** AI algorithms identify and classify sound sources (speech, music, noise) within the 3D sound map. This includes source localization (direction and distance).
4.  **Personalized Sound Field Generation:** The system generates a personalized sound field tailored to the user’s preferences and the acoustic environment. This involves:
    *   **Noise Cancellation:** Attenuate or eliminate unwanted noise sources. (building upon the patent’s attenuation signal generation).
    *   **Sound Source Enhancement:** Amplify desired sound sources (e.g., a specific speaker’s voice).
    *   **Spatial Audio Augmentation:** Introduce new sound sources or modify existing ones to create immersive spatial audio experiences.
    *   **Directional Sound Beaming:** Focus sound towards the user, creating a 'bubble' of audio while minimizing sound leakage to surrounding areas.
5.  **Dynamic Adaptation:** Continuously monitor the acoustic environment and adjust the personalized sound field in real-time. This involves tracking sound source movements, adapting to changes in room acoustics, and learning user preferences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
CaptureEnvironmentMap()
LoadUserProfile(userID)
InitializeMicrophoneArray()
InitializeSpeakerArray()

// Main Loop
While (true) {
  CaptureAmbientSound()
  ReconstructSoundField() // Acoustic Holography
  IdentifySoundSources()
  ClassifySoundSources()
  DetermineDesiredSoundProfile(userID)
  GenerateAttenuationSignals()
  GenerateSpatialAudioSignals()
  ApplySignalsToSpeakerArray()
  UpdateEnvironmentMap()
  AdaptToChanges()
}
```

**Innovation Focus:**

The divergence from the provided patent lies in *complete* sound field reconstruction and manipulation, rather than just attenuation of undesired signals. The system doesn’t simply cancel noise; it actively shapes the entire sonic environment *around* the user, delivering a personalized and immersive audio experience. It moves beyond reactive noise cancellation to proactive sound design. The dynamic environmental mapping and AI-driven adaptation are core to this, allowing the system to create a truly responsive and intelligent soundscape.
