## Dynamic Resource Tag Inheritance & Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the existing resource tagging system to support *inherited* and *propagated* tags, enabling automated dependency mapping and policy enforcement across complex resource hierarchies.  This goes beyond simple parent-child relationships – it allows for tags to flow based on *dynamic* relationships discovered through runtime analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Tag Inheritance Module:**

*   **Function:**  Manages the inheritance of tags from parent resources to child resources.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Resource`: Existing data structure, augmented with a `parent_resource_id` field (nullable).
    *   `Tag`: Existing data structure.
    *   `InheritanceRule`:
        *   `tag_name`: String (name of the tag to inherit).
        *   `condition`: String (logical expression evaluating whether to inherit – e.g.,  "parent.region == 'us-east-1'"). Supports basic variable referencing (parent, child, resource) and comparison operators.
        *   `priority`: Integer (used to resolve conflicts when multiple rules apply to the same tag).
*   **API:**
    *   `add_inheritance_rule(resource_id, tag_name, condition, priority)`:  Adds an inheritance rule for a specific resource.
    *   `remove_inheritance_rule(resource_id, tag_name)`: Removes an inheritance rule.
    *   `get_inherited_tags(resource_id)`: Returns a list of tags inherited by a resource, applying all relevant rules.

**2. Tag Propagation Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Discovers and establishes dynamic relationships between resources, then propagates tags based on these relationships.
*   **Relationship Discovery:**  Utilizes real-time monitoring (e.g., network traffic analysis, API call patterns) to identify relationships.  Examples:
    *   Resource A consistently sends requests to Resource B.
    *   Resource A and Resource B share a common data store.
*   **Propagation Rules:** Define how tags are propagated based on discovered relationships.
    *   `relationship_type`: String (e.g., "consumer", "producer", "shared_data").
    *   `tag_name`: String (name of the tag to propagate).
    *   `direction`: Enum ("forward", "backward", "bidirectional").
    *   `condition`: String (logical expression – e.g., "source.status == 'active'").
*   **API:**
    *   `add_propagation_rule(relationship_type, tag_name, direction, condition)`: Adds a propagation rule.
    *   `remove_propagation_rule(relationship_type, tag_name)`: Removes a propagation rule.
    *   `update_relationships()`: Performs runtime analysis to discover/update relationships between resources.
    *   `propagate_tags()`: Applies propagation rules based on current relationships and tags.

**3. Policy Enforcement Integration:**

*   Modify the existing tag-based policy engine to:
    *   Consider inherited and propagated tags when evaluating compliance.
    *   Allow policies to be defined based on *relationship* tags (e.g., “Alert if any resource *consuming* data from a non-compliant resource”).

**Pseudocode (Propagate Tags Function):**

```
function propagate_tags():
  relationships = discover_relationships() //returns list of tuples (source_resource_id, target_resource_id, relationship_type)
  for source, target, relationship_type in relationships:
    for rule in get_propagation_rules_for_relationship(relationship_type):
      if rule.condition_is_met(source):
        tag = rule.tag_name
        if tag not in get_resource_tags(target):
          add_tag_to_resource(target, tag)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Tag Conflict Resolution:** Implement a more sophisticated mechanism for resolving conflicts when multiple rules assign the same tag with conflicting values.
*   **Tag Provenance:**  Track the origin of each tag (which rule/process created it) to aid in troubleshooting and auditing.
*   **Dynamic Rule Updates:** Allow propagation and inheritance rules to be updated and applied without system downtime.
