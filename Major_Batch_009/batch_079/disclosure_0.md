## Decentralized Key Orchestration with Attestation-Based Access

**Concept:** Extend the virtual key/referral system into a decentralized network where key material isn't held by a single "different computing device" but is distributed across a network of attestors. This builds on the idea of referrals, but eliminates the single point of failure and enhances trust through verifiable claims about key validity and usage policies.

**Specifications:**

**1. Attestor Network:**

*   **Nodes:** A network of independent nodes (“Attestors”) responsible for holding shares of encrypted key material and verifying usage policies. These can be hardware security modules (HSMs), trusted execution environments (TEEs), or even secure enclaves.
*   **Sharding:** Keys are split into multiple shares using a secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing). Each Attestor holds one or more shares.
*   **Consensus:** A lightweight consensus mechanism (e.g., a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm, or a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based approach) is used to ensure agreement on key validity and usage.

**2. Key Request Flow:**

1.  **Client Request:** Client requests a data key, specifying a key identifier, capabilities, and an encryption context.
2.  **Orchestrator Resolution:**  A central "Orchestrator" (can be the system described in the initial patent) receives the request and determines the key's sharding configuration (which Attestors hold shares).
3.  **Attestation Requests:** The Orchestrator sends requests to the required Attestors, requesting attestation of key validity for the specified context and capabilities.
4.  **Attestation Verification:** Each Attestor verifies the request against its stored policies and capabilities. If valid, it creates a digitally signed attestation.
5.  **Share Retrieval:** Once a sufficient number of valid attestations are collected (quorum), the Orchestrator retrieves the key shares from the Attestors.
6.  **Key Reconstruction:**  The Orchestrator reconstructs the complete key using the retrieved shares.
7.  **Key Delivery:** The Orchestrator delivers the reconstructed key (potentially re-encrypted with a key known only to the client) to the client.

**3. Policy Enforcement:**

*   **Contextual Policies:** Policies are defined based on the encryption context, client capabilities, and time constraints.
*   **Attestor-Managed Policies:**  Attestors can define their own policies regarding which requests they will attest to.
*   **Dynamic Policy Updates:** Policies can be updated dynamically without requiring key rotation.

**4. Pseudocode (Orchestrator):**

```
function handleKeyRequest(keyIdentifier, capabilities, encryptionContext) {
  shardingConfig = getShardingConfig(keyIdentifier);
  attestors = shardingConfig.attestors;
  quorumSize = shardingConfig.quorumSize;

  validAttestations = [];
  for (attestor in attestors) {
    attestation = requestAttestation(attestor, keyIdentifier, capabilities, encryptionContext);
    if (verifyAttestation(attestation)) {
      validAttestations.push(attestation);
    }
  }

  if (validAttestations.length >= quorumSize) {
    keyShares = retrieveKeyShares(validAttestations);
    reconstructedKey = reconstructKey(keyShares);
    encryptedKey = encryptKeyForClient(reconstructedKey, clientKey); // Optional re-encryption
    return encryptedKey;
  } else {
    return error("Insufficient attestations");
  }
}

function reconstructKey(keyShares) {
  // Implement secret sharing reconstruction algorithm (e.g., Lagrange interpolation)
  // This requires the shares and the original polynomial degree
  return reconstructedKey;
}
```

**5. Key Components:**

*   **Orchestrator:** Central component responsible for coordinating key requests and managing the Attestor network.
*   **Attestors:** Nodes responsible for holding key shares and verifying usage policies.
*   **Secure Communication Channels:**  Secure channels (e.g., TLS, encrypted tunnels) between the Orchestrator and Attestors.
*   **Policy Definition Language:**  Language for defining granular access control policies.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Eliminates single point of failure and distributes trust.
*   **Scalability:** Attestor network can be scaled to handle increasing key management demands.
*   **Flexibility:** Dynamic policy updates allow for fine-grained access control.
*   **Compliance:**  Supports regulatory requirements for key management and data protection.
