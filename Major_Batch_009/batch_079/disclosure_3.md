## Proactive Contextual "Life Stage" Routing

**Concept:** Expanding beyond simple destination-based travel recommendations, this system aims to predict and proactively route a user based on *life stage* events inferred from calendar data, communication patterns, and location history. Instead of just "get you to work," it anticipates needs arising from those life stages and offers pre-emptive routing and assistance.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Calendar Data (as in provided patent)
    *   Communication Logs (Email, SMS, Messaging Apps - with user permission) – analyzing frequency, keywords, sentiment, and contact groups.
    *   Location History (with user permission) – identifying frequently visited locations, travel patterns, and “anchor” locations (home, work, gym, etc.).
    *   Smart Home Data (optional, with explicit permission) – occupancy sensors, appliance usage, etc.
    *   Public Event Data - concerts, festivals, sporting events.
*   **Life Stage Inference Engine:** A probabilistic model that infers the user's current life stage (e.g., "New Parent," "Job Seeker," "Caregiver," "Empty Nester," "Student").  This isn't explicitly defined by the user but *inferred* from the data streams.
*   **Predictive Routing Algorithm:** This algorithm combines the inferred life stage, calendar events, and location history to predict likely needs and proactively suggest routes.
*   **Route Customization:** Routes aren't limited to transportation. They could include:
    *   Pre-ordering groceries for pickup along the route.
    *   Scheduling a doctor's appointment during a break in the schedule.
    *   Reminding the user to pick up medication.
    *   Suggesting a visit to a support group.
*   **Communication Integration:**  Automated messaging to contacts affected by the user’s proactive routing (e.g., "I’m leaving early to pick up supplies for the baby").
*   **User Interface:** A dashboard displaying the inferred life stage, upcoming predicted needs, suggested routes, and customization options.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Routing Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION predict_route(user_data):
    life_stage = infer_life_stage(user_data.calendar, user_data.communication, user_data.location_history)

    IF life_stage == "New Parent":
        IF user_data.calendar contains "Pediatrician Appointment":
            route = calculate_route(user_data.location, pediatrician_location, mode="driving")
            add_reminder("Pack diaper bag")
            add_reminder("Bring immunization records")

        ELSE IF user_data.calendar is empty AND user_data.location == "home" AND time is near feeding time:
            suggest_route("Grocery store for formula/food")

    ELSE IF life_stage == "Job Seeker":
        IF user_data.calendar contains "Job Interview":
            route = calculate_route(user_data.location, interview_location, mode="driving")
            add_reminder("Bring resume copies")
            add_reminder("Research company")

        ELSE IF user_data.communication contains "Networking Event":
            suggest_route("Networking Event Location")

    ELSE:
        route = standard_route_calculation(user_data.destination)

    RETURN route
```

**Potential Future Enhancements:**

*   Integration with social media to infer interests and anticipate needs.
*   Dynamic life stage adjustment based on ongoing data analysis.
*   Personalized recommendations for services and resources relevant to the user's life stage.
*   Proactive notification of potential disruptions to the user's routine.
