## Adaptive Product Bundling via Predictive Intent

**Concept:** Leverage email content analysis to *proactively* suggest and bundle products *before* the user explicitly requests them, moving beyond simple item identification to anticipating needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** “Intent Prediction Engine” – A background process analyzing incoming email communications (with user permission, of course!).
*   **Data Input:** Raw email text, sender information, historical purchase data associated with the user account, and a product knowledge graph.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Keyword Extraction:** Identify core concepts/objects mentioned in the email.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the emotional context surrounding those concepts (e.g., frustration with a broken item, excitement about an upcoming event).
    *   **Intent Classification:** Assign an intent category (e.g., "repair," "gift," "replenishment," "project").
    *   **Entity Linking:** Connect identified entities to the product knowledge graph.
*   **Product Knowledge Graph:** A structured database linking products to attributes, use cases, related items, and potential problems.  Crucially, this graph must include *problem-solution* relationships (e.g., "broken phone screen" -> "screen protector," "repair kit," "new phone").
*   **Bundle Generation:** Based on identified intent and the product knowledge graph, generate 2-3 potential product bundles.  Consider:
    *   **Preventative Bundles:** If the email suggests a potential problem, offer a preventative solution (e.g., email mentioning a leaky faucet -> bundle: plumber’s tape, wrench, replacement valve).
    *   **Complementary Bundles:** Offer items that naturally complement the identified items or intent (e.g., email mentioning a new camera -> bundle: extra battery, memory card, camera bag).
    *   **Project Bundles:** If the email indicates a project (e.g., “redecorating the living room”), suggest a bundle of relevant tools and materials.
*   **Automated Reply Enhancement:**  The automated reply (as described in the patent) is modified to include:
    *   A section highlighting the “Recommended Bundles”.
    *   A brief explanation of why each bundle is suggested ("Based on your email, we think you might also need…").
    *   A link to a dedicated page displaying the bundles with pricing and detailed information.
*   **User Feedback Loop:**  Track user interactions with the recommended bundles (clicks, purchases, ignored suggestions). Use this data to refine the intent prediction and bundle generation algorithms.
*   **Pseudocode - Bundle Generation:**

    ```
    function generate_bundle(email_text, user_history) {
      intent = analyze_intent(email_text, user_history)
      entities = extract_entities(email_text)
      relevant_products = query_product_knowledge_graph(intent, entities)
      bundle = select_best_bundle(relevant_products, user_history) // Based on price, relevance, popularity
      return bundle
    }
    ```

*   **Data Storage:**
    *   User Intent Profiles – Stored preferences and historical intent data.
    *   Bundle Performance Metrics – Tracking effectiveness of different bundle recommendations.

This moves beyond simply *reacting* to the email content and proactively *anticipates* the user's needs, increasing engagement and driving sales.  It requires a more complex backend but offers significantly more value than simply identifying items mentioned in the email.
