## Dynamic Transaction Instrument 'Splitting' for Micro-Payments

**Concept:** Extend the ownership object to facilitate splitting a single transaction instrument (like a credit card) across multiple, dynamically allocated 'sub-accounts' for highly granular micro-payments, especially within content ecosystems or subscription models. This aims to move beyond simple authorization/offer codes and towards a more fluid, real-time accounting system tied to the user's underlying payment method.

**Specifications:**

**1. Enhanced Ownership Database:**

*   Add a `SubAccountID` field to the existing Ownership Database. This ID links a specific payment 'split' to the core transaction instrument.
*   Include a `SubAccountBalance` field within the Ownership Database, representing the available funds within that split.  This is *not* a traditional balance, but a dynamically calculated limit.
*   Add a `SubAccountSpendingLimit` field to control individual sub-account expenditure.
*   Store a `SubAccountCreationTimestamp` for audit trails and time-based spending rules.

**2. Sub-Account Creation API:**

*   `CreateSubAccount(Token, UserID, ProviderID, SpendingLimit, Duration)`: This API call dynamically creates a sub-account linked to the core transaction instrument.
    *   `Token`: The primary transaction instrument token.
    *   `UserID`: User identifier.
    *   `ProviderID`: Provider identifier.
    *   `SpendingLimit`:  The maximum expenditure allowed for the sub-account (e.g., $5/day).
    *   `Duration`: Time period for which the sub-account is active (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days, indefinitely).
*   The system automatically calculates `SubAccountBalance` based on `SpendingLimit` and `Duration`.  A 'rolling' balance can be implemented.

**3. Transaction Routing Logic:**

*   Modify the existing transaction initiation process.
*   Before authorizing a transaction, the system checks for an active `SubAccountID` associated with the `Token`, `UserID`, and `ProviderID`.
*   If a `SubAccountID` is found:
    *   The transaction amount is deducted from `SubAccountBalance`.
    *   If `SubAccountBalance` falls below zero, the transaction is declined, or routed to the core `Token` based on configured rules.
*   If no `SubAccountID` is found, the transaction proceeds as normal using the core `Token`.

**4. Dynamic Sub-Account Rules Engine:**

*   Implement a rules engine that allows providers to define dynamic sub-account creation and spending rules.  Example rules:
    *   "Create a new sub-account for each new content series a user subscribes to."
    *   "Limit spending to $1 per article read."
    *   “If a user consistently exceeds a $5/day spending limit on ‘tips’ for creators, automatically increase the limit by 10%.”
*   These rules are associated with the `ProviderID`.

**5.  Real-Time Balance Reporting API:**

*   `GetSubAccountBalance(SubAccountID)`: Returns the current `SubAccountBalance` for a given `SubAccountID`.  This allows providers to display real-time spending information to users.

**Pseudocode - Transaction Authorization:**

```
function AuthorizeTransaction(Token, UserID, ProviderID, Amount) {

  SubAccountID = LookupSubAccount(Token, UserID, ProviderID);

  if (SubAccountID != null) {
    SubAccountBalance = GetSubAccountBalance(SubAccountID);

    if (SubAccountBalance >= Amount) {
      UpdateSubAccountBalance(SubAccountID, SubAccountBalance - Amount);
      //Transaction approved using SubAccount
      return true;
    } else {
      //SubAccount insufficient funds, route to core Token or decline
      //(Implementation detail based on configuration)
      return false;
    }

  } else {
    //No SubAccount found, authorize using core Token
    //(Existing authorization process)
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Micro-tipping:** Allow users to easily tip creators with small amounts.
*   **Pay-per-article/video:** Enable granular payment for individual content items.
*   **Dynamic subscription tiers:** Automatically adjust subscription costs based on usage.
*   **Gamified spending:**  Implement rewards or limitations based on spending habits.
