## Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Spoofing Detection & Collaborative Correction

**Concept:** Expand the single-UAV spoofing detection to a collaborative, swarm-level system. If one UAV detects potentially spoofed data, it broadcasts a "trust flag" to nearby UAVs. These nearby UAVs then cross-validate the data, and if a consensus of untrusted data is reached, a localized “safe mode” is activated, leveraging sensor fusion and potentially forming a temporary, localized mesh network for improved positioning.

**System Specifications:**

*   **UAV Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Enhanced communication module – capable of short-range, high-bandwidth communication (e.g., 802.11ad/WiGig) for inter-UAV communication.
    *   Increased processing power for real-time data analysis and consensus algorithms.
    *   Redundant inertial measurement unit (IMU) & visual odometry sensors.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Trust Flag Module:** Transmits a “trust flag” to neighboring UAVs when spoofing is suspected based on deviation from capability ranges (as per the source patent). Flag includes timestamp, deviation type, severity, and UAV ID.
    *   **Consensus Algorithm:** Each UAV receiving a trust flag:
        1.  Compares its own state estimate (flight parameter) with the reported deviation.
        2.  Applies a weighted voting system based on:
            *   Proximity to the originating UAV.
            *   Sensor confidence level.
            *   Historical reliability of the originating UAV.
        3.  If the weighted vote exceeds a threshold, the UAV marks the navigation data as potentially untrusted.
    *   **Localized Mesh Network (LMN) Formation:**  If multiple UAVs flag data as untrusted within a defined radius:
        1.  Establish a temporary ad-hoc mesh network using the enhanced communication module.
        2.  Share sensor data (IMU, visual odometry, cameras) for cross-validation.
    *   **Sensor Fusion & Position Correction:** Implement a Kalman filter or similar sensor fusion algorithm to combine data from multiple UAVs within the LMN. This provides a more accurate position estimate independent of potentially spoofed GPS data.
    *   **Safe Mode Activation:**
        1.  Switch to sensor-based navigation (visual odometry, IMU)
        2.  Restrict altitude and speed to safe levels.
        3.  Initiate a return-to-base or holding pattern.
        4.  Report the incident to a central command.

**Pseudocode (Consensus Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION EvaluateTrustFlag(trustFlag, myState)
  // trustFlag:  Incoming trust flag data
  // myState: My current flight state (position, velocity, etc.)

  weight = 0
  //Proximity weighting
  IF distance(myUAV, trustFlag.UAV_ID) < proximityThreshold THEN
    weight += proximityWeight
  ENDIF

  //Sensor confidence weighting
  IF mySensorConfidence > sensorConfidenceThreshold THEN
    weight += sensorConfidenceWeight
  ENDIF

  //Deviation comparison
  IF abs(myState.parameter - trustFlag.deviation) < deviationThreshold THEN
    weight += deviationWeight
  ENDIF

  return weight
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ProcessTrustFlags(trustFlagsList)
  totalWeight = 0
  FOR each trustFlag IN trustFlagsList
    weight = EvaluateTrustFlag(trustFlag, myState)
    totalWeight += weight
  END FOR

  IF totalWeight > consensusThreshold THEN
    markNavigationDataAsUntrusted()
    activateSafeMode()
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Jamming Resistance:** The LMN should utilize frequency hopping or other techniques to resist jamming attempts.
*   **Data Security:** Communication between UAVs should be encrypted to prevent malicious actors from injecting false data.
*   **Scalability:** The consensus algorithm should be designed to handle a large number of UAVs without significant performance degradation.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust consensus thresholds based on environmental conditions, payload weight, and other factors.
