## Autonomous Mobile Device - Dynamic Environmental Reconstruction & Prediction

**Concept:** Expand the AMD’s spatial awareness beyond simple map updating to proactively *predict* environmental changes and adjust navigation accordingly. This moves beyond reacting to dock displacement to anticipating wider changes in the physical space.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a low-resolution, wide-field-of-view (WFV) LiDAR alongside existing camera systems. Supplement with an environmental microphone array.
*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   **Baseline Capture:** Upon docking or initial environment setup, perform a full 3D scan with LiDAR and capture ambient soundscape data. This creates the initial “environmental fingerprint.”
    *   **Continuous Monitoring:** While operating, continuously capture LiDAR point clouds and audio samples. Processing occurs in parallel with existing SLAM operations.
*   **Predictive Algorithm – “Environmental Delta”:**
    *   **Delta Calculation:** Compare current LiDAR scans and audio data with the baseline. The algorithm focuses on *changes* rather than absolute positions – identifying newly added objects, removed objects, or significant audio deviations (e.g., moving furniture, opening/closing doors).
    *   **Object Classification:** Employ a lightweight object classification model (trained on common indoor objects) to categorize changes.  Assign confidence levels to classifications.
    *   **Trajectory Prediction:** Using historical “Delta” data, predict future environmental changes. This can be rule-based (e.g., “If a chair is being moved towards a doorway, predict a temporary obstruction”) or employ a short-term recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn patterns.
*   **Navigation Integration:**
    *   **Dynamic Path Planning:** Incorporate predicted environmental changes into the path planning algorithm. This allows the AMD to proactively avoid predicted obstacles or adjust its path based on anticipated modifications to the environment.
    *   **Confidence Weighting:** Path planning adjustments are weighted by the confidence levels of the predicted changes. Higher confidence predictions result in more significant adjustments.
*   **Data Storage:** Store historical “Delta” data for long-term learning and improved prediction accuracy.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Function: Update Environment Prediction
function UpdateEnvironmentPrediction(currentScan, currentAudio) {
  baselineScan = GetBaselineScan();
  baselineAudio = GetBaselineAudio();

  deltaScan = CalculateDelta(currentScan, baselineScan);
  deltaAudio = CalculateDelta(currentAudio, baselineAudio);

  changedObjects = ClassifyObjects(deltaScan);
  predictedChanges = PredictFutureChanges(changedObjects, deltaAudio);

  return predictedChanges;
}

// Function: Dynamic Path Planning
function DynamicPathPlanning(targetPose, predictedChanges) {
  basePath = CalculateBasePath(currentPose, targetPose);
  adjustedPath = AdjustPathForChanges(basePath, predictedChanges);
  return adjustedPath;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved navigation in dynamic environments (e.g., offices, hospitals, homes).
*   Proactive obstacle avoidance.
*   Anticipatory task planning (e.g., if a table is being moved, adjust the route for delivering an item).
*   Anomaly detection (e.g., identify unexpected changes in the environment that might indicate a security breach).
