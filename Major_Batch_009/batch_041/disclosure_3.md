## Adaptive Function Sharding & Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the compatibility testing framework by dynamically sharding function execution *across* environment versions, and incorporating predictive rollback based on real-time performance telemetry. Instead of simply routing incompatible functions to an older environment, actively split execution *within* a single invocation.

**Specs:**

*   **Shard Manager Module:** Responsible for analyzing function code (static analysis), historical execution data, and real-time telemetry to determine optimal sharding strategy.  Sharding granularity can range from individual lines of code to entire subroutines or code blocks.
*   **Environment Profiles:** Each compute node maintains a profile detailing its execution environment version, available resources (CPU, memory, network), and historical performance metrics for various function types.
*   **Invocation Interceptor:** Modifies incoming function invocations to inject sharding directives. The interceptor uses the shard manager's recommendations to split the function's execution graph.
*   **Execution Orchestrator:** Distributes sharded code blocks to compute nodes based on environment compatibility and resource availability. Utilizes a messaging queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for inter-node communication.
*   **Telemetry Collector:** Gathers real-time performance data (latency, error rates, resource utilization) from each compute node during sharded execution.
*   **Predictive Rollback Engine:**  Analyzes incoming telemetry data.  If the performance of a sharded code block in the *updated* environment falls below a predefined threshold (configurable per function/code block), the engine automatically rolls back execution of that specific block to the *previous* environment for subsequent invocations.  This rollback is transparent to the client.
*   **Adaptive Learning Loop:** The system continuously learns from execution data and telemetry to refine sharding strategies and rollback thresholds, optimizing performance and compatibility over time.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Shard Manager):**

```
function determineShardingStrategy(functionCode, executionHistory, currentEnvironmentProfile):
  // Static Analysis: Identify potential compatibility issues (e.g., deprecated APIs)
  compatibilityIssues = analyzeFunctionCode(functionCode)

  // Check Execution History:  Look for previous failures in updated environment
  historicalPerformance = getHistoricalPerformance(functionCode, currentEnvironmentProfile)

  if compatibilityIssues or historicalPerformance.errorRate > threshold:
    // Split function into multiple shards
    shards = splitFunction(functionCode, compatibilityIssues)  //Splits function based on where issues are detected.
    shardAssignments = assignShardsToEnvironments(shards, currentEnvironmentProfile) //Assigns shards to available compatible environments.

    return shardAssignments
  else:
    // Execute function in current environment
    return [functionCode, currentEnvironmentProfile] //Return the entire function to the environment.
```

**Innovation & Novelty:**

*   **Granular Compatibility:**  Moving beyond all-or-nothing compatibility checks to a per-code-block assessment.
*   **Proactive Rollback:**  Automatically reverting problematic code segments *before* they cause widespread failures, rather than simply routing entire functions.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:**  Continuously adjusting sharding and rollback strategies based on real-time performance data.
*   **Potential for Hybrid Execution:**  Functions can be executed *simultaneously* across different environments, combining the benefits of both.
