## Dynamic Knowledge Graph Subsumption for Proactive Dataset Generation

**Concept:** Instead of generating datasets *on request*, proactively identify emerging concepts within the knowledge graph and generate datasets centered around them *before* a request is made. This anticipates user needs and accelerates machine learning workflows. It leans heavily into the ‘custom ontology’ aspect of the provided patent, but in a predictive manner.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Knowledge Graph Monitor (KGM). Runs as a separate service, constantly analyzing the knowledge graph.
*   **Input:** Knowledge Graph, Custom Ontology.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Subsumption Detection:** KGM continuously scans for newly added or significantly modified nodes/relationships within the KG. It uses the custom ontology to identify potential ‘subsumption events’. A subsumption event occurs when a new node’s properties (based on the ontology) strongly align with an existing, broader concept *but isn’t explicitly linked*. This indicates an emerging specialization or a new instance of an existing concept.
    2.  **Confidence Scoring:**  Assign a confidence score to each potential subsumption event.  Factors:
        *   **Ontology Distance:** How ‘close’ the new node is to existing concepts within the ontology (using graph traversal and semantic similarity).
        *   **Relationship Density:** Number of connections the new node has to other nodes in the KG. Higher density suggests greater relevance.
        *   **Temporal Recency:**  How recently the node was added or modified.  Recent changes are weighted higher.
    3.  **Dataset Generation Trigger:** If the confidence score exceeds a predefined threshold, trigger dataset generation.
    4.  **Dataset Generation Process:**
        *   Identify the ‘parent’ concept (the most relevant existing concept according to the ontology).
        *   Generate mention-concept pairs:
            *   **Synonym Expansion:** As in the original patent, generate pairs for synonyms of both the new node and the parent concept.
            *   **Related Entity Extraction:** Identify other nodes closely related to the new node within the KG (using graph traversal). Generate pairs linking the new node to these related entities, using the parent concept as the intermediary.
        *   Store the generated dataset, tagged with metadata (timestamp, confidence score, triggering event).
*   **Output:** Dynamically generated datasets, proactively stored and available for machine learning workflows.

**Pseudocode (KGM core loop):**

```
LOOP:
    new_events = get_new_or_modified_nodes()
    FOR event IN new_events:
        parent_concept, confidence_score = find_best_parent_concept(event, ontology)
        IF confidence_score > threshold:
            dataset = generate_dataset(event, parent_concept)
            store_dataset(dataset, metadata)
    END FOR
    sleep(interval)
END LOOP
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Adaptive Threshold:** Dynamically adjust the confidence threshold based on overall KG growth and historical dataset generation rates.
*   **User Feedback Loop:** Incorporate user feedback on generated datasets to refine the confidence scoring and dataset generation process.
*   **Multi-Tenant Support:** Extend the system to support multiple tenants, each with their own custom ontology and dataset generation preferences.
*   **Dataset Versioning:** Implement dataset versioning to track changes and enable rollback to previous versions.
