**Dynamic Feature Weighting via Reinforcement Learning**

**Concept:** Instead of treating all features detected in an image equally during the probability distribution ranking process, introduce a dynamic weighting system learned through reinforcement learning. This allows the system to prioritize features that are more indicative of specific 3D objects, improving accuracy and reducing false positives.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Feature Extraction Module:** Standard SIFT (or similar) feature extraction as per the base patent. Outputs feature descriptors and locations.
2.  **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**
    *   **State:** The current feature descriptor, its location in the image, and the top *N* ranked probability distributions from the initial ranking (as in the base patent).
    *   **Action:** A scaling factor (between 0 and 2, incrementing by 0.1) to apply to the probability value associated with the current feature.
    *   **Reward:**  Based on subsequent object identification accuracy. If the object identified matches a ground truth label (during training/validation), the reward is positive (e.g., +1). If incorrect, the reward is negative (e.g., -1). A small penalty for each action taken (-0.01) to encourage efficiency.
    *   **Algorithm:**  Q-Learning or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The agent learns a Q-function (or policy) that maps states to optimal scaling factors.
3.  **Weighted Probability Calculation:** The probability value for each feature is calculated as:
    `Weighted Probability = Original Probability * (1 + Scaling Factor)`
    This scaled probability is then used in the ranking process.
4.  **Training Data:**  A large dataset of images with labeled 3D objects.
5.  **System Architecture:**

    ```
    [Image Input] --> [Feature Extraction (SIFT)] --> [RL Agent] --> [Weighted Probability Calculation] --> [Probability Ranking] --> [Object Identification]
                                                                   ^
                                                                   |
                                                      [Reward Signal (from Ground Truth)]
    ```
6.  **Pseudocode for RL Agent Action Selection:**

    ```
    function select_action(state, Q_table, epsilon):
        if random() < epsilon:
            // Explore: Choose a random action
            action = random_action()
        else:
            // Exploit: Choose the action with the highest Q-value
            action = argmax(Q_table[state])
        return action
    ```
7.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   The Q-table (or policy network) should be initialized with random values.
    *   Epsilon (exploration rate) should be decayed over time to encourage exploitation.
    *   The learning rate for the RL agent should be tuned to optimize performance.

8. **Potential Expansion:** A 'meta-RL' system that dynamically adjusts the RL agent's hyperparameters (learning rate, exploration rate, etc.) based on its performance.
