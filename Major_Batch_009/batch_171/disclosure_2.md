## Dynamic Contextual Action Suggestions – “Proactive Glance”

**Core Concept:** Extend the text recognition functionality to anticipate user needs *before* explicit action, leveraging ambient sensor data and predictive algorithms to suggest contextually relevant actions displayed as subtle, transient visual cues directly within the camera viewfinder ("Proactive Glance").

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, ambient light sensor, and microphone data with the image processing pipeline.
*   **Environmental Context Engine:**  A continuously running process analyzes sensor data to infer the user’s environment and activity. Examples: 
    *   Stationary + Desk-like orientation + Document Detection = “Save to Notes?”, “Email to…?”
    *   Moving + Street-like orientation + Address Detection = “Navigate With…?”, “Call Taxi?”
    *   Restaurant Environment (sound analysis + location) + Menu Detection = "Add to Order?", "View Reviews?"
*   **Predictive Action Stack:** A ranked list of potential actions generated based on text type, environmental context, and user history (from the existing activity data).  Priority is weighted by:
    *   Text type (URL, phone, address, etc.).
    *   Environmental Context Confidence Score (how certain the system is about the environment).
    *   User History (frequency of action for this text type in similar contexts).
*   **Visual Cue System (Proactive Glance):**  Actions are *not* presented as full-screen prompts. Instead, subtle visual cues are overlaid onto the camera viewfinder in the area surrounding the detected text.
    *   Small, translucent icons representing actions (e.g., a phone icon for dialing, a map pin for navigation).
    *   Icons are animated to draw the user’s eye (e.g., a gentle pulsing glow).
    *   The most likely action is visually emphasized (e.g., brighter glow, larger icon).
*   **Gaze Tracking Integration (Optional):**  If available, gaze tracking further refines action prioritization.  If the user’s gaze lingers on a particular action cue, that action is moved to the top of the stack.
*   **Confirmation Mechanism:**  A minimal confirmation gesture is required to initiate the action (e.g., a quick head nod, a subtle tilt of the device). This prevents accidental actions while still providing a fast and intuitive experience.

**Pseudocode (Environmental Context Engine):**

```
function analyze_environment(sensor_data):
    // Data inputs: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, ambient light, microphone
    activity = determine_activity(accelerometer, gyroscope)  //e.g., "stationary", "walking", "driving"
    orientation = determine_orientation(accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) //e.g., "desk", "street", "upright"
    ambient_context = analyze_ambient_sound(microphone) // e.g., "restaurant", "office", "outdoor"

    if activity == "stationary" and orientation == "desk":
        environment = "office_desk"
    elif activity == "walking" and orientation == "street":
        environment = "street"
    elif ambient_context == "restaurant":
        environment = "restaurant"
    else:
        environment = "general"

    return environment
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simply *reacting* to user input after text recognition. It proactively anticipates needs and provides subtle, contextually relevant suggestions directly within the user’s field of view, minimizing disruption and maximizing efficiency. It isn't about speed, but about seamless integration into the user’s natural flow.
