## Automated Resource Dependency Graph & Predictive Provisioning

**Concept:** Extend the infrastructure template system to proactively identify and pre-provision resources based on predicted application behavior *before* code is deployed, leveraging a dependency graph built from source code analysis and historical usage data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Graph Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Application source code (all languages), historical resource usage logs (CPU, memory, network I/O, storage), infrastructure template definitions.
*   **Process:**
    *   Static code analysis: Identify inter-component dependencies, function calls, data flow, and external service interactions.
    *   Dynamic analysis (via sandboxed execution or tracing of production deployments): Observe actual resource usage patterns during application runtime.
    *   Build a dependency graph: Represent components as nodes and dependencies as edges.  Edge weight represents the intensity/frequency of dependency.  Graph stores resource requirements for each node/component.
    *   Graph augmentation: Incorporate historical resource usage data to refine resource estimations for each component.  Store time-series data for resource demand prediction.
*   **Output:**  A weighted, directed dependency graph representing application components and their resource dependencies, along with historical resource usage and predicted future demand. Graph format:  JSON or Protocol Buffers.

**2. Predictive Provisioning Engine:**

*   **Input:** Dependency graph (from Module 1), current infrastructure state, deployment parameters (desired scale, region, etc.),  defined service level objectives (SLOs) for each component (latency, throughput, availability).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Critical Path Analysis:** Identify the longest path (in terms of resource dependency) within the dependency graph. This represents the minimum time required for the entire application to initialize.
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Pre-allocate resources along the critical path *before* code deployment.  Prioritize resources with high dependency weight and those impacting SLOs.
    *   **Dynamic Scaling Rules:**  Define scaling rules based on predicted demand from the dependency graph and historical data. Rules specify thresholds for scaling up/down based on resource utilization.  Utilize predictive algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to forecast future demand.
    *   **Resource Reservation:** Reserve resources (compute, storage, network) in advance to ensure availability during deployment.
*   **Output:** A list of pre-provisioned resources, configured according to infrastructure templates, and ready for code deployment. Scaling rules for dynamic resource adjustment.

**3. Integration with Existing System:**

*   The Dependency Graph Generation Module integrates with the existing pipeline template package detection.  It analyzes source code changes to update the dependency graph.
*   The Predictive Provisioning Engine integrates with the existing infrastructure template selection and resource provisioning process.  It overrides the default resource allocation based on its pre-provisioning recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Provisioning Engine):**

```
function predictAndProvision(dependencyGraph, infrastructureTemplates, deploymentParameters):

  criticalPath = findCriticalPath(dependencyGraph)

  preProvisionedResources = []

  for component in criticalPath:

    resourceTemplate = findResourceTemplate(component, infrastructureTemplates)

    requiredResources = calculateRequiredResources(resourceTemplate, deploymentParameters)

    reservedResources = reserveResources(requiredResources) #Reserve in infrastructure provider

    preProvisionedResources.append(reservedResources)

  scalingRules = generateScalingRules(dependencyGraph, deploymentParameters)

  return preProvisionedResources, scalingRules
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced deployment time: Pre-provisioning eliminates delays caused by resource allocation during deployment.
*   Improved application performance: By proactively allocating resources, the system can meet demand and maintain performance under load.
*   Increased application resilience:  Pre-provisioning ensures resources are available in case of failures.
*   Optimized resource utilization: Dynamic scaling rules can reduce costs by automatically adjusting resource allocation based on demand.
