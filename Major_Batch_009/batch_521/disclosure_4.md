## Dynamic Region Linking & Semantic Tagging

**Concept:** Extend the region identification and typing system to not only identify *what* a region is (heading, body text, etc.) but also *how* regions relate to each other semantically, and create a dynamic, linked document representation.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structure: Semantic Graph.**

*   Each identified region is a node in a directed graph.
*   Node Attributes: Region Type (as per the existing patent), Typographical Features (font, size, etc.), Content (text/image data).
*   Edge Attributes:  Relationship Type (e.g., "supports", "elaborates", "contrasts", "continues", "is_part_of").  Confidence Score (based on AI analysis â€“ see section 3).

**2. Relationship Inference Engine.**

*   **Input:** Document text, identified regions & types, user edits (as per existing patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze text surrounding regions to infer relationships.  Utilize NLP techniques (dependency parsing, co-reference resolution).
    *   Leverage pre-trained knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet) to understand semantic similarities between region content.
    *   Calculate a "Relationship Strength" score for each potential link based on textual similarity, NLP analysis, and knowledge graph integration.
*   **Output:** Populated Semantic Graph.

**3. AI-Assisted Relationship Validation & Refinement.**

*   Integrate a trainable AI model (e.g., a graph neural network) to validate and refine inferred relationships.
*   **Training Data:** Large corpus of annotated documents with explicitly defined semantic relationships between regions.
*   **Model Function:**
    *   Receive the initial Semantic Graph as input.
    *   Predict the probability that each edge represents a true semantic link.
    *   Output a refined graph with adjusted edge weights (Confidence Scores).
    *   Provide suggestions for new links or corrections to existing links.

**4. Dynamic Layout & Navigation.**

*   **Interactive Document View:** Present the document in a way that visually reflects the Semantic Graph.  Allow users to:
    *   Highlight connected regions.
    *   Trace relationships between regions.
    *   Collapse/expand regions based on their relationships.
*   **AI-Powered Navigation:**  Implement features that leverage the Semantic Graph to improve document navigation:
    *   "Related Regions" suggestions.
    *   AI-generated summaries of connected region content.
    *   Intelligent search that considers semantic context, not just keyword matching.

**5. Pseudocode - Relationship Inference Engine**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION InferRelationships(document_text, regions, region_types):
    semantic_graph = initialize_graph(regions)

    FOR each region1 in regions:
        FOR each region2 in regions:
            IF region1 != region2:
                contextual_similarity = calculate_text_similarity(region1.content, region2.content)
                dependency_score = analyze_dependency_relationship(region1, region2, document_text)
                knowledge_graph_score = query_knowledge_graph(region1.content, region2.content)

                relationship_strength = (contextual_similarity + dependency_score + knowledge_graph_score) / 3

                IF relationship_strength > threshold:
                    relationship_type = determine_relationship_type(region1, region2, document_text)
                    add_edge_to_graph(semantic_graph, region1, region2, relationship_type, relationship_strength)

    RETURN semantic_graph
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Advanced document understanding for information extraction.
*   AI-assisted content creation and editing.
*   Interactive learning materials with dynamic links between concepts.
*   Intelligent search and recommendation systems.
