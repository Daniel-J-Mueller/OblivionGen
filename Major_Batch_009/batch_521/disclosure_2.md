## Adaptive Neighborhood Expansion via Dynamic Graph Partitioning

**Concept:** The core of the provided patent seems to center on identifying relevant neighborhoods within a graph. This inspires a system that *dynamically* expands or contracts a node’s neighborhood based on query context *and* computational resource availability. Instead of a static or iteratively refined neighborhood, we create a system where the neighborhood "breathes" – growing for complex queries or limited resources, shrinking when possible to improve efficiency.

**Specs:**

**1. Graph Partitioning Module:**

*   **Input:** Corpus graph, target node, query vector (representing the query), resource availability metrics (CPU/GPU load, memory usage).
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide the corpus graph into *k* partitions using a graph partitioning algorithm (e.g., METIS, ParMETIS). These partitions define coarse-grained areas of the graph.
    *   Assign each partition a “relevance score” based on the similarity between the query vector and the aggregated embeddings of nodes within that partition. (Cosine similarity, dot product, etc.)
    *   Based on the relevance scores, select a subset of partitions to include in the expanded neighborhood. This selection is weighted by both relevance *and* resource availability.  High relevance partitions are prioritized, but partitions requiring minimal computational cost are favored when resources are strained.
*   **Output:** A list of partition IDs defining the expanded neighborhood.

**2. Dynamic Neighborhood Construction Module:**

*   **Input:** Expanded neighborhood partition IDs, target node.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each selected partition:
        *   Identify nodes within the partition connected to the target node.
        *   Rank these connected nodes based on a ‘local relevance score’ – potentially a combination of node embedding similarity to the query, node degree, and shortest path distance to the target node.
        *   Select the top *n* nodes from each partition to include in the final, dynamically constructed neighborhood. The value of *n* can be adjusted based on resource constraints.
*   **Output:** The dynamically constructed neighborhood – a set of nodes representing the target node’s context.

**3. Adaptive Query Processing Module:**

*   **Input:** Query vector, dynamically constructed neighborhood.
*   **Process:**
    *   Perform query processing operations (e.g., embedding lookup, similarity calculations) *only* on the nodes within the dynamically constructed neighborhood.
    *   If the query requires broader context beyond the immediate neighborhood, dynamically request additional nodes from adjacent partitions, weighted by similarity and resource cost.
*   **Output:** Query results based on the dynamically processed neighborhood.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Neighborhood Construction):**

```
function construct_dynamic_neighborhood(target_node, query_vector, resource_availability):
    partitions = graph_partitioning(corpus_graph, num_partitions)
    relevant_partitions = select_relevant_partitions(partitions, query_vector, resource_availability)

    neighborhood = {}
    for partition_id in relevant_partitions:
        connected_nodes = get_connected_nodes(target_node, partition_id)
        ranked_nodes = rank_nodes(connected_nodes, query_vector)
        selected_nodes = top_n_nodes(ranked_nodes, n)
        neighborhood.update(selected_nodes)

    return neighborhood
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static or iterative neighborhood identification. By dynamically adjusting the neighborhood size based on query and resource context, it achieves a balance between accuracy and efficiency. The graph partitioning allows for coarse-grained control, while the ranking and selection mechanisms enable fine-grained adaptation. It’s a "breathing" neighborhood that expands and contracts as needed, optimizing performance without sacrificing relevance.
