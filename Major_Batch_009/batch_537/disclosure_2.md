## Dynamic Interference Mapping & Predictive Beamforming

**Concept:** Leverage the grant-free overlay transmission concept to create a dynamic, real-time map of interference *caused by* the overlay transmissions, and proactively adjust beamforming parameters *for all* users (scheduled and grant-free) to mitigate that interference. This moves beyond simply *allowing* overlay, to *optimizing* the system *around* it.

**Specs:**

*   **Interference Probe Signals:** Each grant-free UT (GF-UT) periodically transmits a short, known "probe" signal *in addition* to its data. This probe signal isn’t for data, it's for interference mapping. It’s a highly compressed, pseudo-random sequence.
*   **Base Station (BS) Interference Estimation:** The BS has dedicated hardware/software to:
    *   Receive and correlate GF-UT probe signals.
    *   Estimate the interference footprint of each GF-UT transmission *in the frequency domain*. This goes beyond simple power measurement, and looks at spectral leakage.
    *   Create a real-time “interference map” representing the frequency spectrum impacted by all active GF-UTs.
*   **Predictive Beamforming Algorithm:**
    *   The BS maintains beamforming weights for *all* UTs (scheduled and grant-free).
    *   When a new GF-UT begins transmission (detected via the probe signal), or an existing GF-UT’s transmission parameters change, the BS uses the interference map to *predict* the interference impact on other UTs.
    *   The algorithm adjusts beamforming weights *proactively* to minimize interference. This isn't reactive interference cancellation. It *anticipates* the interference.
    *   The adjustment considers:
        *   The frequency spectrum impacted by the GF-UT.
        *   The current beamforming weights of other UTs.
        *   The priority of other UTs (QoS).
*   **GF-UT Parameter Reporting:** GF-UTs periodically report (within the probe signal) basic transmission parameters:
    *   Transmit power.
    *   Frequency offset.
    *   Estimated channel conditions (simple metrics).
*   **Hybrid Scheduling:** Scheduled UTs are still prioritized.  The beamforming algorithm allocates resources to scheduled UTs *first*, then optimizes beamforming for grant-free UTs in the remaining space. This prevents grant-free access from completely dominating the system.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** The correlation and beamforming calculations require significant processing power. Dedicated FPGA or ASIC hardware is essential.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Adjustment):**

```
// Input: Interference Map, Current Beamforming Weights, GF-UT Parameters
// Output: Adjusted Beamforming Weights

function adjustBeamforming(interferenceMap, beamformingWeights, gfUtParameters) {

    // Calculate interference impact of GF-UT on each scheduled UT
    impact = calculateInterferenceImpact(interferenceMap, gfUtParameters)

    // For each scheduled UT
    for each ut in scheduledUts {

        // Calculate optimal beamforming adjustment to minimize interference
        adjustment = calculateOptimalAdjustment(ut, impact, ut.qos)

        // Apply adjustment to beamforming weights
        beamformingWeights[ut] = beamformingWeights[ut] + adjustment

        // Normalize weights to ensure power constraints are met
        normalizeBeamformingWeights(beamformingWeights)
    }
    return beamformingWeights
}
