## Acoustic Event Source Localization via Federated Spatial Audio Reconstruction

**Concept:** Expand the federated learning framework to not just *detect* acoustic events, but to *localize* their source in 3D space using a distributed spatial audio reconstruction technique. Each device contributes to a global spatial audio map, improving localization accuracy without requiring raw audio data to leave the device.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing (Device-Side):**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Devices equipped with multiple microphones (smartphones, smart speakers, dedicated sensor nodes). Minimum array size: 4 microphones, optimally spaced.
*   **Beamforming:** Implement a real-time beamforming algorithm (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response) to enhance signals originating from specific directions.  This is performed *locally* on the device.
*   **Spatial Feature Extraction:** Extract spatial features from the beamformed signals. These features could include:
    *   **Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) Estimates:**  Calculated using Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) or Phase Difference of Arrival (PDoA) techniques.
    *   **Spatial Coherence:** Measures the correlation of signals between different microphone pairs, indicating the signal's spatial characteristics.
    *   **Acoustic Intensity:** Measures the signal strength from each direction.
*   **Data Representation:** Encode spatial features as a compact vector representing the acoustic "fingerprint" of the event's source direction.  Example: `[DoA_Azimuth, DoA_Elevation, Spatial_Coherence, Acoustic_Intensity]`.

**2. Federated Learning & Map Building (Server-Side):**

*   **Global Spatial Map:** Maintain a global 3D spatial map representing the acoustic environment. This map is initially empty or sparsely populated.
*   **Federated Averaging:** Employ federated averaging to aggregate updates from multiple devices. Each device contributes its local spatial feature vectors *without* sharing raw audio data.
*   **Map Update Rule:** Define a rule for updating the global spatial map based on received spatial feature vectors:
    1.  **Bayesian Filtering:** Integrate incoming spatial feature vectors into existing map entries using a Bayesian filter. This allows for probabilistic representation of sound source locations.
    2.  **Map Clustering:** Cluster similar spatial feature vectors to identify common sound source locations.
    3.  **Dynamic Map Resolution:** Adapt map resolution based on the density of spatial feature vectors. Higher resolution in areas with more frequent events.
*   **Map Distribution:** Periodically distribute updated map sections to devices to improve localization accuracy.

**3. Localization & Inference (Device-Side):**

*   **Real-time Beamforming:** Continuously perform real-time beamforming to scan the acoustic environment.
*   **Map Matching:** Compare extracted spatial features with the local copy of the global spatial map.
*   **Localization Algorithm:** Use a localization algorithm (e.g., nearest neighbor search, probabilistic matching) to determine the most likely location of the sound source.
*   **3D Positioning:** Output the estimated 3D coordinates of the sound source.

**Pseudocode (Device-Side):**

```python
# Data Acquisition
audio_data = capture_audio()
spatial_features = extract_spatial_features(audio_data)

# Federated Update
encrypted_features = encrypt(spatial_features)
send_to_server(encrypted_features)

# Receive Map Update
map_update = receive_from_server()
decrypt(map_update)
update_local_map(map_update)

# Localization
current_features = extract_spatial_features(audio_data)
location = localize_source(current_features, local_map)

print(f"Estimated Location: {location}")
```

**Innovation:** This extends the self-supervised federated learning paradigm beyond event detection to spatial awareness.  By reconstructing a distributed acoustic environment map, devices can pinpoint sound source locations in 3D without transmitting sensitive audio data, enhancing privacy and creating new possibilities for smart home automation, security systems, and assistive technologies. The self-supervision aspect comes from continually refining the map based on device observations, allowing the system to adapt to changing acoustic environments and improve localization accuracy over time.
