## Dynamic Resource Masking with Predictive Obfuscation

**Concept:** Extend the access control and redaction framework to *proactively* mask resource attributes based on predicted access patterns and sensitivity scores, rather than solely reacting to requests or log data. This moves beyond redaction to a dynamic, multi-layered obfuscation strategy.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensitivity Scoring Engine:**

*   **Input:** Resource metadata (data type, schema, owner, creation date, tags, existing access controls).
*   **Process:**  A machine learning model assigns a sensitivity score to each resource attribute based on its characteristics and historical access patterns.  The model is periodically retrained with new access data and evolving data governance policies. Factors include:
    *   **Data Type:**  PII, financial data, health information â€“ automatically increase score.
    *   **Usage Frequency:**  Rarely accessed attributes receive higher scores.
    *   **Owner/Group:** Attributes owned by specific high-risk groups increase score.
    *   **Schema:**  Specific schema fields known to contain sensitive data increase score.
*   **Output:** A sensitivity score (0-100) for each resource attribute.

**2. Access Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Client device profile (role, historical access patterns, location, time of day), requested resource type, current system load.
*   **Process:** A machine learning model predicts the *likelihood* of specific attributes being accessed within the request.  This model learns from historical access logs and client behavior.
*   **Output:** A probability distribution of attribute access for the request.

**3. Dynamic Masking Layer:**

*   **Input:** Sensitivity score (from Sensitivity Scoring Engine), Probability distribution of attribute access (from Access Prediction Module), Original resource data.
*   **Process:**  A rule-based system dynamically applies masking techniques based on the combined input.  Masking techniques can include:
    *   **Tokenization:** Replace sensitive data with non-identifiable tokens.
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypt specific attributes with varying key lengths based on sensitivity.
    *   **Data Shuffling:**  Randomly shuffle the order of data elements within a dataset.
    *   **Attribute Omission:**  Completely remove less critical attributes.
    *   **Generalized Values:** Replace specific values with broader categories (e.g., replace precise age with age range).
*   **Output:** Masked resource data.

**4. Adaptive Masking Policy Engine:**

*   **Input:** Monitoring data (access attempt failures, system performance metrics, audit logs), sensitivity scores, access prediction data.
*   **Process:**  A feedback loop that continuously adjusts masking policies based on real-time conditions. For example:
    *   If a high number of access attempts fail after masking, the system reduces masking intensity.
    *   If system load increases due to masking operations, the system optimizes masking algorithms.
*   **Output:**  Updated masking policies.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function applyDynamicMasking(request, resourceData):
  sensitivityScores = getSensitivityScores(resourceData)
  accessPredictions = getAccessPredictions(request, resourceData)

  maskedData = resourceData

  for each attribute in resourceData:
    sensitivityScore = sensitivityScores[attribute]
    accessProbability = accessPredictions[attribute]

    if sensitivityScore > threshold AND accessProbability < threshold:
      # Apply masking technique
      maskedData[attribute] = applyMaskingTechnique(maskedData[attribute], sensitivityScore)
    end if
  end for

  return maskedData
end function

function applyMaskingTechnique(data, sensitivityScore):
  if sensitivityScore > 80:
    # Strong encryption
    encryptedData = encrypt(data, strongKey)
    return encryptedData
  else if sensitivityScore > 50:
    # Tokenization
    tokenizedData = tokenize(data)
    return tokenizedData
  else:
    # Data shuffling or omission
    shuffledData = shuffle(data)
    return shuffledData
  end if
end function
```

**Engineering Notes:**

*   Requires a robust machine learning infrastructure for training and deploying models.
*   Masking techniques should be configurable and extensible.
*   Performance optimization is critical to minimize latency.
*   Audit logging of masking operations is essential for compliance.
*   Consider a tiered approach to masking, with different levels of obfuscation based on risk and sensitivity.
