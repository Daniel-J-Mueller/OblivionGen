## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Personalized Soundscapes

**Concept:** Extend the personalized audio routing concept to create localized acoustic zones around users interacting with public kiosks, and layer personalized soundscapes *on top* of kiosk audio.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array (Kiosk):**  A circular array of at least 8 microphones integrated into the kiosk housing. High-sensitivity, low-noise microphones preferred.
*   **Directional Speakers (Kiosk):** Array of small directional speakers, controllable individually in volume and frequency.
*   **Proximity Sensor (Kiosk):** Infrared or ultrasonic sensor to detect user presence within a defined radius (e.g., 1-2 meters).
*   **User Device Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.0 or higher, Wi-Fi 6.
*   **Edge Compute Module (Kiosk):**  Dedicated processor (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano) for real-time audio processing and zone detection.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Acoustic Zone Detection:** Algorithm leveraging microphone array data to pinpoint user location within a 3D space around the kiosk.  Utilizes beamforming and sound source localization techniques. Output: (x, y, z) coordinates of user's head/mouth.
*   **Personalized Soundscape Generator:** Cloud-based service (or local library) storing user-defined soundscapes: ambient music, nature sounds, white noise, etc. Triggered by user ID and contextual data (time of day, location).
*   **Audio Mixing Engine:**  Real-time audio mixer that combines:
    *   Kiosk output audio (speech prompts, informational content).
    *   Personalized soundscape audio.
    *   Directional speaker control signals.
*   **User Profile Management:** Stores user preferences:
    *   Preferred soundscape.
    *   Soundscape volume.
    *   Directional audio focus (e.g., prioritize audio directly in front of user).
*   **Privacy Control:** Toggle to disable personalized soundscapes for enhanced privacy.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Kiosk Initialization

Initialize Microphone Array
Initialize Directional Speakers
Connect to User Profile Management Service

// User Interaction Loop

Detect User Proximity (Proximity Sensor)

If User Detected:

    Authenticate User (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)

    Load User Profile

    Begin Acoustic Zone Detection

    While User Interacting:

        Update Acoustic Zone Coordinates

        Fetch Personalized Soundscape (User Profile)

        Mix Kiosk Audio & Soundscape

        Adjust Directional Speaker Volume & Angle (based on Acoustic Zone Coordinates & User Profile)

        Output Mixed Audio to Directional Speakers

    End While

    Save User Session Data

End If

```

**4.  Refinements/Extensions:**

*   **Dynamic Soundscape Adjustment:**  Modify the soundscape in real-time based on the kioskâ€™s content. (e.g., If kiosk is displaying nature documentary, blend in relevant environmental sounds).
*   **Multi-User Support:**  Enable simultaneous acoustic zones for multiple users interacting with the kiosk.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Combine directional audio with localized haptic feedback (e.g., vibrations in kiosk surface) for enhanced immersion.
*   **Emotion Detection:** Integrate emotion detection (via facial or voice analysis) to adapt soundscape to user's mood.
*   **Integration with AR/VR Headsets:**  Seamlessly integrate personalized audio with augmented or virtual reality experiences at the kiosk.
