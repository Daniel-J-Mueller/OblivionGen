## Adaptive Acoustic Masking with Contextual Awareness

**Concept:** Expand upon the keyword detection disabling mechanism to create a dynamic acoustic masking system. Instead of simply *disabling* detection during playback, proactively *mask* specific sounds based on detected context *before* they even reach the microphone. This moves from reactive suppression to proactive filtering.

**Specs:**

**Hardware:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Employ a small array (3-5) of microphones positioned near the user's mouth/headset.
*   **Dedicated DSP:** A low-latency Digital Signal Processor (DSP) unit for real-time audio processing.
*   **Bone Conduction Transducer (Optional):** A bone conduction transducer for delivering masking signals directly to the user, bypassing the eardrum.
*   **Ambient Sound Sensor:** A single microphone for monitoring room acoustics.

**Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Contextual Analysis:**
    *   **Keyword/Phrase Detection:** As in the base patent, detect keywords or phrases spoken by the user.
    *   **Activity Recognition:** Utilize machine learning models trained on audio features to identify user activities (e.g., speaking, listening to music, watching a video, typing). Leverage data from the ambient sound sensor to categorize broader environmental contexts (e.g., quiet office, busy street, home).
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Combine keyword detection, activity recognition, and environmental context to *predict* what sounds the user is likely to produce in the *near future*.

2.  **Masking Signal Generation:**
    *   **Adaptive Noise Shaping:** Generate a masking signal that is spectrally shaped to counteract the predicted sounds. This is *not* simple white noise – it is tailored to the specific frequencies and characteristics of the anticipated sounds.
    *   **Bone Conduction Delivery (Optional):** If available, deliver the masking signal through the bone conduction transducer. This minimizes interference with the user’s primary audio stream.  For traditional speakers, adjust volume and equalization dynamically.
    *   **Phase Cancellation (Experimental):** Explore the possibility of generating anti-phase audio signals to actively cancel out predicted sounds *before* they are captured by the primary microphone(s).

3.  **Real-time Adjustment:**
    *   **Continuous Monitoring:** Constantly analyze the audio stream from the primary microphone(s) and compare it to the predicted sounds.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:** Adjust the masking signal in real-time to optimize its effectiveness. This includes modifying its amplitude, frequency content, and phase.
    *   **User Feedback Loop:** Incorporate a mechanism for the user to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the masking system.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
initialize MicrophoneArray, DSP, ActivityRecognitionModel, MaskingSignalGenerator

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    audioData = captureAudioFromMicrophoneArray()
    activity = ActivityRecognitionModel.predict(audioData)
    keywords = detectKeywords(audioData)

    predictedSounds = predictSoundsBasedOn(activity, keywords)

    maskingSignal = MaskingSignalGenerator.generate(predictedSounds)

    // Deliver masking signal (bone conduction or speaker)
    deliverMaskingSignal(maskingSignal)

    // Capture ambient sound for context
    ambientAudio = captureAmbientAudio()

    //Continuously adapt masking signal based on captured audio and activity
    adaptMaskingSignal(ambientAudio, activity)
}

```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Privacy:** Suppress sensitive speech from being overheard.
*   **Improved Voice Assistant Accuracy:** Reduce false positives and improve the clarity of voice commands.
*   **Noise Cancellation:**  A more intelligent and adaptable form of noise cancellation.
*   **Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality:** Create more immersive and realistic audio experiences.
