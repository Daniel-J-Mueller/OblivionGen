## Dynamic Log Compaction with Predictive Pre-fetch

**Concept:** Extend the log-structured storage concept with a predictive pre-fetch and compaction mechanism based on access patterns and object relationships. Instead of solely relying on delayed compaction triggered by log growth or space reclamation, proactively compact and pre-fetch related data based on anticipated access.

**Motivation:** While the provided patent focuses on selectively retaining log records, the latency of reconstructing objects from logs or fetching them from storage remains a potential bottleneck. Anticipating access needs and proactively preparing data can significantly improve performance.

**System Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Log Manager (PLM)
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Access History Table (AHT):* Maps object IDs to access timestamps and access patterns (read, write, delete). Stores a rolling window of access data.
    *   *Relationship Graph (RG):*  Stores relationships between objects (e.g., foreign keys, embedded objects, logical dependencies).  This graph can be dynamically updated based on observed access patterns.
    *   *Prefetch Queue (PQ):* Prioritized queue of objects or log segments to be prefetched.
    *   *Compaction Schedule (CS):* Dynamically generated schedule for compacting log segments.
*   **Algorithm:**

    1.  **Access Monitoring:** Intercept all object accesses (reads, writes). Update the AHT with access timestamps and patterns.
    2.  **Relationship Discovery:** Analyze access patterns in the AHT to infer relationships between objects. Update the RG.  For example, if object A is consistently accessed immediately after object B, a relationship is inferred.
    3.  **Prefetch Prediction:**
        *   Based on the AHT, RG, and historical access data, predict which objects are likely to be accessed in the near future.
        *   Assign a priority score to each predicted object based on the likelihood of access and the cost of fetching it from storage.
        *   Add predicted objects to the PQ, sorted by priority score.
    4.  **Proactive Prefetching:**
        *   A dedicated prefetch thread continuously monitors the PQ.
        *   If a requested object is in the PQ (or a segment containing it is already in memory), the request is served directly from memory.
        *   Otherwise, the prefetch thread fetches the object/segment from storage and loads it into memory.
    5.  **Dynamic Compaction Scheduling:**
        *   Monitor the log file growth rate and the access patterns of objects.
        *   If a log segment contains many objects that are frequently accessed, prioritize it for compaction.
        *   If a log segment contains objects that have not been accessed for a long time, de-prioritize it for compaction.
        *   Compaction process: select log segments, apply changes from log records to create a newer version of the objects, and write the newer versions to a compact storage location.
        *   Garbage collection of outdated log segments.
*   **Pseudocode (Compaction Scheduler):**

    ```
    function scheduleCompaction() {
      segments = getLogSegments()
      for segment in segments {
        accessScore = calculateAccessScore(segment) // based on AHT
        ageScore = calculateAgeScore(segment) // based on last access
        priority = accessScore * weightAccess + ageScore * weightAge
        segment.priority = priority
      }
      sortSegmentsByPriority(segments)
      compactTopN(segments, N) // Compact the top N segments
    }

    function compactTopN(segments, N) {
      for i in range(N) {
        segment = segments[i]
        newObjects = applyLogChanges(segment)
        writeObjectsToStorage(newObjects)
        removeSegment(segment)
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Fast NVMe storage for log files and compact storage.
    *   Sufficient RAM to cache frequently accessed objects and log segments.
    *   Multi-core processor to support concurrent prefetching and compaction.
*   **Integration:** Integrate with existing database management system components (query processor, storage manager).

This system aims to reduce latency and improve performance by proactively preparing data for access, based on observed access patterns and object relationships. By dynamically scheduling compaction and prefetching, it minimizes the need for costly on-demand fetching and reconstruction.
