## Predictive Search Intent Refinement via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback (heart rate variability, skin conductance, EEG) from the user into the search query refinement process. This allows the system to not only predict *what* the user is searching for based on textual input and past behavior, but also *how* they are feeling while searching, adjusting suggestions based on emotional state and cognitive load.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biofeedback Sensor Integration:**
    *   Support for wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers, EEG headsets) via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi.
    *   Data acquisition module to receive and preprocess biofeedback signals (noise filtering, artifact removal, feature extraction - HRV, skin conductance level, alpha/theta brainwave power).
    *   Real-time data stream ingestion pipeline (low latency – <100ms).

2.  **Emotional/Cognitive State Modeling:**
    *   Machine learning models (RNNs, LSTMs) trained to map biofeedback features to emotional/cognitive states (e.g., frustration, confusion, engagement, boredom, cognitive overload).
    *   Calibration phase for each user to establish baseline biofeedback patterns.
    *   Dynamic state estimation based on continuous biofeedback input.

3.  **Search Query Adaptation:**
    *   Integration with existing search query suggestion algorithms.
    *   Query weighting adjustments based on emotional/cognitive state.
        *   **Frustration/Confusion:** Prioritize broader, more exploratory queries; introduce help/tutorial suggestions.  Lower the ranking of complex/technical results.
        *   **Engagement:**  Prioritize related but novel queries; suggest deeper dives into specific topics.
        *   **Cognitive Overload:** Simplify results presentation; reduce information density; suggest breaks.
        *   **Neutral/Focused:** Maintain standard search behavior.
    *   Adaptive filtering of search results based on inferred emotional state.
    *   Suggestion of alternative phrasing/keywords if emotional state indicates search is failing.

4.  **User Interface:**
    *   Optional visual feedback to the user indicating their inferred emotional/cognitive state (discreet display – e.g., color-coded indicator).
    *   Privacy controls to allow users to disable biofeedback integration or selectively share data.
    *   Settings to customize the sensitivity of the adaptation algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Query Adaptation):**

```
function adapt_query(query, biofeedback_data, user_profile):
  emotional_state = infer_emotional_state(biofeedback_data, user_profile)

  if emotional_state == "frustration" or emotional_state == "confusion":
    broadened_query = broaden_query(query)
    weighted_suggestions = generate_suggestions(broadened_query)
    adjust_weights(weighted_suggestions, "broaden", emotional_state)
  elif emotional_state == "engagement":
    related_query = find_related_query(query)
    weighted_suggestions = generate_suggestions(related_query)
    adjust_weights(weighted_suggestions, "deepen", emotional_state)
  elif emotional_state == "cognitive_overload":
    simplified_results = simplify_search_results(query)
    weighted_suggestions = generate_suggestions(query)
    adjust_weights(weighted_suggestions, "simplify", emotional_state)
  else:
    weighted_suggestions = generate_suggestions(query)

  return weighted_suggestions
```

**Potential Benefits:**  Improved search experience, reduced user frustration, increased efficiency, deeper understanding of user intent, potential applications in education, mental health, and accessibility.
