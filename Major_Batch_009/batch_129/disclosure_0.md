## Dynamic Network Slicing via Predictive Frame Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the described frame allocation scheme to dynamically slice the network based on *predicted* data transmission needs of devices, rather than solely reacting to requests. This allows for proactive optimization and guaranteed QoS, especially for latency-sensitive applications.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Implement a machine learning model trained on historical device communication patterns (frequency, data size, application type).
    *   Model outputs a ‘transmission probability score’ for each device over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., next 5 SPS cycles).
    *   The prediction engine runs *continuously* and updates the probability scores.
2.  **Dynamic Frame Allocation Algorithm:**
    *   Based on predicted scores, allocate SPS frames *proactively*. Higher probability devices receive a greater proportion of frames.
    *   Algorithm considers *diversity* – ensuring some frames are reserved for unexpected requests or new devices joining the network.
    *   Algorithm operates within constraints: total available frames per cycle, maximum frame allocation per device, and minimum reserved frames.
3.  **Frame ‘Warm-up’ Phase:**
    *   Newly allocated frames enter a ‘warm-up’ phase before being fully activated.
    *   During warm-up, the device transmits a small beacon signal to verify frame availability and establish communication parameters.
    *   This reduces contention and ensures reliable data transmission.
4.  **Frame ‘Cool-down’ Phase:**
    *   If a device fails to utilize an allocated frame within a defined timeframe, the frame enters a ‘cool-down’ phase.
    *   The frame is temporarily released back into the available pool for reassignment.
5.  **Prioritization Levels:**
    *   Assign devices to different priority levels based on application type (e.g., real-time video conferencing > background data synchronization).
    *   Higher priority devices receive preferential frame allocation during contention.

**Pseudocode (Frame Allocation Algorithm):**

```
// Input:
//   deviceList: List of all devices in the network
//   totalFrames: Total number of SPS frames available per cycle
//   predictionScores: Prediction scores for each device
//   priorityLevels: Priority levels for each device

// Output:
//   frameAssignments: Mapping of devices to allocated frames

frameAssignments = {}
availableFrames = totalFrames

// Sort devices by priority and prediction score (descending)
sortedDevices = sort(deviceList, by: priority, predictionScore)

for device in sortedDevices:
    // Calculate frame request based on prediction score
    requestedFrames = predictionScore * totalFrames * weightingFactor

    // Limit frame request to available frames
    allocatedFrames = min(requestedFrames, availableFrames)

    // Assign frames to device
    frameAssignments[device] = allocatedFrames

    // Update available frames
    availableFrames -= allocatedFrames

// Reserve remaining frames for unexpected requests
reservedFrames = availableFrames

// Return frame assignments and reserved frames
return frameAssignments, reservedFrames
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased processing power at the gateway to handle the prediction engine and dynamic frame allocation algorithm.
*   Sufficient memory to store device profiles, historical communication data, and prediction model parameters.
*   Optimized communication protocols to minimize latency and overhead associated with frame allocation and activation.
