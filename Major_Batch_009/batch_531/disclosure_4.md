## Dynamic Focus Stacking with AI-Driven Subject Isolation

**Concept:** Expand the multiple image capture concept to facilitate real-time dynamic focus stacking, coupled with AI-driven subject isolation and relighting. The goal is to generate images with dramatically extended depth of field *and* creatively enhanced lighting, all achieved automatically during or immediately after capture.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Camera System:** High frame rate camera (minimum 30fps, ideally 60+). Variable aperture control.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with sufficient processing power for real-time AI inference. Minimum 8GB RAM.
*   **Storage:** Fast internal storage (NVMe SSD) for temporary image buffering.
*   **Display:** High-resolution display for previewing the processed image.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Capture Module:** Controls camera parameters (frame rate, aperture, ISO, shutter speed).
*   **Focus Shift Engine:**  Automatically shifts focus between capture frames.  The shift amount is dynamically adjusted based on scene depth estimation (see Depth Estimation Module).
*   **Depth Estimation Module:** Utilizes a deep learning model (e.g., monocular depth estimation network) to estimate the depth map of the scene in real-time. The model must be trained on a large and diverse dataset.
*   **Subject Isolation Module:**  Employs a semantic segmentation model to identify and isolate the main subject(s) within the scene. This allows for selective application of focus stacking and relighting effects.
*   **Focus Stacking Engine:** Combines the sharpest regions from multiple images, based on the depth map and subject segmentation.  Utilizes a weighted averaging algorithm to minimize artifacts and maximize sharpness.
*   **Relighting Engine:**  Applies virtual lighting effects to the isolated subject(s). This allows for creative control over lighting direction, intensity, and color. The engine utilizes a physically based rendering (PBR) model for realistic results.
*   **User Interface:** Allows users to adjust parameters such as focus shift range, relighting intensity, and subject segmentation sensitivity. Also provides a preview of the processed image.

**3. Algorithm Flow:**

1.  **Capture Sequence:** The camera captures a sequence of images with slightly shifted focus points. The focus shift range and step size are determined by the Depth Estimation Module.
2.  **Depth Estimation:** The Depth Estimation Module analyzes the captured images and generates a depth map of the scene.
3.  **Subject Isolation:** The Subject Isolation Module identifies and segments the main subject(s) in the scene.
4.  **Focus Stacking:** The Focus Stacking Engine combines the sharpest regions from each image, based on the depth map and subject segmentation. Pixels are weighted based on their sharpness at a given depth.
5.  **Relighting:** The Relighting Engine applies virtual lighting effects to the isolated subject(s), enhancing their appearance and creating a more visually appealing image.
6.  **Output:** The final processed image is displayed to the user and saved to storage.

**Pseudocode (Focus Stacking Engine):**

```
function focusStack(imageSequence, depthMap, subjectMask):
  outputImage = new image
  for each pixel in imageSequence:
    pixelDepth = depthMap[pixel.x, pixel.y]
    if subjectMask[pixel.x, pixel.y] == 1: // Pixel is part of the subject
      weight = calculateWeight(pixelDepth, depthMap) // Weight based on focus
      outputImage[pixel.x, pixel.y] = weightedAverage(outputImage[pixel.x, pixel.y], pixel, weight)
    else:
      // Handle background pixels (e.g., use depth-based blending)
  return outputImage

function calculateWeight(pixelDepth, depthMap):
  // Use a Gaussian function to calculate the weight based on the difference
  // between the pixel's depth and the ideal depth at that location.
  // Adjust parameters to control the falloff and sharpness.
  // e.g., weight = exp(-((pixelDepth - idealDepth)^2) / (2 * sigma^2))
```

**Innovation & Potential:**

This system moves beyond simple focus stacking by integrating AI to dynamically control the process and enhance the artistic possibilities.  The relighting engine allows for the creation of images that are impossible to achieve with traditional photography. The real-time processing makes it suitable for both still photography and videography. The dynamic adjustments, driven by depth and subject isolation, creates a smoother user experience than existing static or manual solutions.
