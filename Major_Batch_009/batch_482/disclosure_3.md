## Dynamic Schema Generation via Federated Validation

**Concept:** Extend the existing validation framework to *dynamically generate* data schemas based on user interaction and contextual data, allowing for highly adaptable and intelligent forms/interfaces.  Instead of pre-defined validation rules tied to a fixed schema, the system learns and adapts validation requirements *during* data entry. This is achieved through a federated approach, pulling validation logic from multiple sources – including the tenant's existing rules, external APIs, and a learned model based on user input patterns.

**Specs:**

**1. Federated Validation Engine (FVE) Component:**

*   **Input:**
    *   `Page Script`: The existing page script, extended to include “validation request” hooks.
    *   `User Input Stream`: Real-time stream of data entered by the user.
    *   `Contextual Data Stream`: Data about the user (location, role, preferences, device), session information, and time.
    *   `Tenant Profile`: Access to the tenant’s existing validation rules.
    *   `External API Registry`: List of accessible external APIs for data enrichment and validation.
    *   `Learned Model`: A machine learning model trained on historical data entry patterns (see section 4).
*   **Output:**  A dynamic validation schema for each data field, expressed as a set of validation constraints (regex patterns, data type, range, required flag, etc.).

**2. Validation Request Hook (in Page Script):**

*   On `data field focus out` (or similar event), the page script triggers a “validation request” to the FVE.
*   The request includes:
    *   `Data Field ID`
    *   `Current Data Value`
    *   `Contextual Data` (from the data field or the page)
*   The FVE processes the request and returns the dynamic validation schema for that field.
*   The page script applies the received schema to validate the data *client-side* (for immediate feedback) and sends the data to the server.

**3.  FVE Processing Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
function process_validation_request(field_id, data_value, contextual_data):
  // 1. Tenant Rules
  tenant_rules = get_tenant_rules(field_id)
  base_schema = apply_tenant_rules(tenant_rules, data_value)

  // 2. External API Enrichment
  api_results = query_external_apis(field_id, data_value, contextual_data)
  enriched_schema = apply_api_results(api_results, base_schema)

  // 3. Learned Model Prediction
  prediction = learned_model.predict(field_id, data_value, contextual_data, enriched_schema)
  final_schema = apply_prediction(prediction, enriched_schema)

  // 4. Schema Merging & Conflict Resolution
  merged_schema = merge_schemas(merged_schema, final_schema) // Handle conflicting rules intelligently

  return merged_schema
```

**4. Learned Model Training:**

*   **Data Source:** Historical data entry patterns (user inputs, contextual data, successful/failed validations).
*   **Model Type:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer architecture.
*   **Training Objective:** Predict the optimal validation schema for a given data field based on the input data.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Retrain the model periodically with new data to improve accuracy and adapt to changing user behavior.

**5.  Security Considerations:**

*   **API Access Control:**  Strictly control access to external APIs to prevent malicious data injection.
*   **Data Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user inputs before sending them to the FVE or external APIs.
*   **Model Protection:**  Protect the learned model from tampering and unauthorized access.



This system allows for a much more fluid and adaptable user experience, particularly in complex forms where validation requirements can change dynamically. It also unlocks opportunities for intelligent data assistance and proactive error prevention.
