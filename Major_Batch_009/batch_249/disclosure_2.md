## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Expand on the asynchronous forwarding concept by implementing adaptive data sharding *combined* with predictive pre-fetch. The system will not just forward requests, but proactively anticipate data needs based on request patterns and pre-fetch data shards to read-only nodes *before* a request is even made. This moves beyond simply offloading work, to proactively staging data for faster response times.

**Specs:**

**1. Shard Metadata Service:**

*   **Function:** A centralized service that maintains metadata about data sharding. This includes:
    *   Shard ID to Physical Location mapping.
    *   Shard access frequency statistics.
    *   Shard dependency graph (which shards are often requested together).
*   **API:**
    *   `get_shard_location(shard_id)`: Returns the physical location (node ID) of a given shard.
    *   `update_shard_stats(shard_id, access_count)`: Updates the access statistics for a shard.
    *   `get_dependency_graph(shard_id)`: Returns a list of shard IDs frequently accessed with the given shard.

**2. Predictive Prefetch Engine (on each Read-Only Node):**

*   **Function:** Analyzes incoming request patterns to predict future data needs. Uses historical data (maintained locally and/or retrieved from the Shard Metadata Service) and potentially Machine Learning models (trained on request sequences) to identify likely shard requests.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identifies common request sequences.
    *   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovers relationships between shards frequently requested together.
    *   **Time-Series Forecasting:** Predicts future shard access based on historical trends.
*   **Prefetch Trigger:** When the engine predicts a high probability of a shard request, it initiates a prefetch request to the Read-Write node or other appropriate node hosting the shard.

**3. Asynchronous Prefetch Request Handler (on Read-Write Nodes):**

*   **Function:** Handles prefetch requests from Read-Only nodes. This handler should prioritize prefetch requests over standard requests, and leverage existing asynchronous forwarding mechanisms.
*   **Workflow:**
    *   Receive prefetch request (specifying shard ID).
    *   Retrieve shard data.
    *   Transmit shard data to requesting Read-Only node.

**4. Adaptive Shard Migration:**

*   **Function:** Periodically analyze shard access patterns and dynamically migrate shards between nodes to optimize performance. This could involve moving frequently accessed shards closer to the nodes that request them most often.
*   **Trigger:** Based on shard access statistics (collected by the Shard Metadata Service) or resource utilization on individual nodes.
*   **Workflow:**
    *   Identify shards to migrate.
    *   Initiate data transfer to the target node.
    *   Update Shard Metadata Service with new shard locations.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Engine - Read-Only Node):**

```
function process_request(request):
  # Analyze request to identify accessed shards
  accessed_shards = extract_shards(request)

  # Update shard access statistics
  for shard in accessed_shards:
    update_shard_stats(shard, 1)

  # Predict future shard needs
  predicted_shards = predict_next_shards(accessed_shards)

  # Initiate prefetch requests for predicted shards
  for shard in predicted_shards:
    if shard_not_present_locally(shard):
      prefetch_shard(shard)

  # Process the request
  process_request_data(request)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shard Metadata:**  Key-Value store (Shard ID: Location, Access Count, Dependency List).
*   **Request History:** Time-series database storing request sequences and accessed shards.
*   **Prediction Models:** Machine Learning models trained on request history data (e.g., Markov models, recurrent neural networks).
