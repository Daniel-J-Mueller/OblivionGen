## Spatial Audio Scene Reconstruction via Frequency-Band Delay Modulation

**Concept:** Expand the frequency-band processing described in the patent to reconstruct a spatial audio scene from a multi-channel input, allowing for dynamic modification of perceived sound source location *after* recording. Instead of merely reducing distortion, we leverage precise delay modulation within each frequency band to simulate head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and manipulate the perceived 3D soundstage.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-channel audio (minimum stereo, ideally ambisonics or multiple discrete channels).
*   **Processing Blocks:**
    *   **Channel Decomposition:** Audio input is split into N channels.
    *   **Frequency Band Splitting:** Each channel is processed by a filter bank, generating M frequency bands per channel (e.g., using a gammatone filter bank or a constant-Q transform).
    *   **Delay Modulation Matrix:**  A dynamically generated matrix defining a unique delay value for *each* frequency band of *each* channel. This matrix is the core of the spatial manipulation. It's calculated based on a desired 3D soundstage configuration – specifying the location of each sound source.
    *   **Delay Application:** Each frequency band of each channel is delayed according to the Delay Modulation Matrix. This simulates the time differences of arrival (TDOA) and level differences (ILD) experienced by a listener due to the sound source’s location.
    *   **Frequency Band Recombination:** Delayed frequency bands are recombined within each channel to create a modified channel signal.
    *   **Channel Summation/Rendering:** Modified channel signals are summed (for stereo/mono output) or rendered using ambisonics/wavefield synthesis techniques to create the final audio output.
*   **Dynamic Control:** 
    *   **Sound Source Tracking:** Integrate with a sound source tracking system (e.g., using microphone arrays or computer vision).  The tracking data dynamically updates the Delay Modulation Matrix, allowing for real-time manipulation of the perceived soundstage.
    *   **User Interface:** A UI to allow manual adjustment of sound source locations, or to define "virtual listening positions."
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **HRTF Approximation:** Use a database of HRTFs to generate the Delay Modulation Matrix, or approximate HRTFs using geometric models (cone or sphere head models).  The HRTF selection or modeling should adapt to the selected user / listener profile.
    *   **Delay Interpolation:** Implement efficient delay interpolation techniques to minimize artifacts when dynamically changing the Delay Modulation Matrix.
    *   **Crossfade/Smoothing:**  Apply crossfading or smoothing algorithms to the Delay Modulation Matrix to avoid abrupt changes in the perceived soundstage.
*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-performance DSP or FPGA for real-time processing.
    *   Multi-channel audio interface.
    *   (Optional) Microphone array for sound source tracking.
*   **Pseudocode (Delay Application Block):**

```
FOR each channel IN inputChannels:
    FOR each frequencyBand IN frequencyBands:
        delayValue = DelayModulationMatrix[channel][frequencyBand]
        delayedSignal = applyDelay(channelSignal[frequencyBand], delayValue)
        channelSignal[frequencyBand] = delayedSignal
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond distortion reduction to *active* spatial audio manipulation.  The core idea is that precise control over delay in each frequency band allows for a level of realism and flexibility in spatial audio rendering that is not possible with traditional methods.  The ability to dynamically modify the perceived soundstage after recording opens up new possibilities for immersive audio experiences, virtual reality, and audio post-production.
