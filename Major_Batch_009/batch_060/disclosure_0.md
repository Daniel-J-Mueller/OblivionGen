## Adaptive Cohort Construction via Generative Behavioral Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the synthetic control methodology by dynamically constructing cohort groups, not just based on historical features, but on *generated* behavioral profiles. This aims to overcome limitations of relying solely on observed data, especially for new features or rapidly changing user behaviors.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Profile Generator (BPG):**
    *   Input: Raw user interaction data (clicks, scrolls, time on page, purchase history, etc.).
    *   Process: Train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn the underlying distribution of user behaviors. The generator component of the GAN/VAE will create synthetic user behavioral profiles. The discriminator/encoder ensures realism.
    *   Output:  A library of synthetic user behavioral profiles. Each profile is a vector representing patterns of interaction. Include ‘noise’ parameters to adjust profile variance and create diverse simulations.

2.  **Dynamic Cohort Builder (DCB):**
    *   Input: Target sub-group from the first deployment region (as defined in the patent), the library of synthetic behavioral profiles from the BPG.
    *   Process:
        *   **Profile Matching:**  Calculate a similarity score (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) between the target sub-group’s historical features and each synthetic profile.
        *   **Profile Augmentation:** Select top-N matching synthetic profiles.  *Augment* the control group by weighting the historical data of existing sub-groups from the second deployment region *with* the generated synthetic profiles.  The weighting is determined by the similarity score. Higher similarity = more weight.
        *   **Iterative Refinement:** Repeat the profile matching and augmentation process iteratively. Introduce a ‘drift’ parameter that gradually increases the influence of synthetic profiles, simulating future behavioral changes.
    *   Output: A dynamically constructed control group, a combination of real and synthetic user profiles.

3.  **Effect Metric Calculation:** (Integration with existing patent logic)
    *   The synthetic data is treated as another data point when calculating the control outcome metric.
    *   A ‘synthetic weight’ is applied to each synthetic data point, based on its similarity score and the drift parameter.
    *   The effect metric is calculated as before, but uses the weighted average of the control outcome metric.

**Pseudocode (DCB):**

```pseudocode
function build_dynamic_cohort(target_subgroup, synthetic_profile_library, drift_parameter):
  // Input:
  //   target_subgroup: Historical data for a sub-group in the first deployment region
  //   synthetic_profile_library: List of generated behavioral profiles
  //   drift_parameter: Controls the influence of synthetic data (0 to 1)

  control_group = existing_control_group // From the original patent logic
  synthetic_group = []

  for each profile in synthetic_profile_library:
    similarity_score = calculate_similarity(target_subgroup, profile)

    //Weight the synthetic profile based on similarity and drift.
    synthetic_weight = similarity_score * drift_parameter

    synthetic_group.append((profile, synthetic_weight))

  //Combine the existing control group with the synthetic group.
  combined_group = combine_groups(control_group, synthetic_group)

  return combined_group
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure for training and running the GAN/VAE.
*   Data storage for storing historical and synthetic data.
*   Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Integration with the existing user interface analysis system.
