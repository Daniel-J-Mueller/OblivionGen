## Dynamic Content Weighting & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the reference page testing methodology to not just *measure* performance based on static parameters (page size, script complexity, domain count) but to dynamically weight those parameters *during* actual page load, based on real-time network conditions and user device capabilities, coupled with predictive prefetching of dynamically weighted content.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Classification Module:** Integrate a module within the browser capable of analyzing page content and classifying elements by ‘weight’ categories (High, Medium, Low). Weight is initially assigned based on element size, expected processing time (e.g., complex JavaScript), and dependency chain length.
*   **Network Condition Monitor:** A background service monitoring real-time network bandwidth, latency, and packet loss.
*   **Device Capability Profiler:**  A service profiling the user’s device – CPU speed, RAM, GPU, screen resolution, and battery level.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Network conditions, device capabilities, initial content weights.
    *   Process:  Adjust content weights based on the following rules:
        *   Poor network: Lower weights for High and Medium content, prioritizing Low content.
        *   Low device capability: Reduce weights for High and Medium content, deferring complex processing.
        *   Good network & high capability: Maintain or increase weights for High and Medium content.
    *   Output: Adjusted content weights.
*   **Prefetching Engine:**
    *   Monitors the adjusted content weights.
    *   Predicts which content elements are most critical to initial page rendering.
    *   Initiates prefetching requests for those elements *before* they are explicitly requested by the page. Prefetching requests should utilize available bandwidth strategically.
*   **Prefetching Prioritization:** Content prioritized for prefetching uses the dynamically calculated weights from the above algorithm.
*   **Caching Mechanism:** Utilize a tiered caching system to store prefetched content. Prioritize frequently accessed content and dynamically adjust cache size based on available memory.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** Integrate the prefetching engine with the browser's rendering pipeline to seamlessly incorporate prefetched content into the page rendering process.
*   **JavaScript Execution Throttling:** Dynamically throttle JavaScript execution based on the adjusted weights and device capabilities. Delay or reduce the execution of complex scripts during initial page load.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Weight Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustContentWeights(networkConditions, deviceCapabilities, initialWeights)

  IF networkConditions.bandwidth < MIN_BANDWIDTH THEN
    FOR each contentElement in contentPage
      IF contentElement.weight == HIGH OR contentElement.weight == MEDIUM THEN
        contentElement.weight = LOW
      ENDIF
    ENDFOR
  ENDIF

  IF deviceCapabilities.cpuSpeed < MIN_CPU_SPEED OR deviceCapabilities.ram < MIN_RAM THEN
    FOR each contentElement in contentPage
      IF contentElement.weight == HIGH THEN
        contentElement.weight = MEDIUM
      ELSE IF contentElement.weight == MEDIUM THEN
        contentElement.weight = LOW
      ENDIF
    ENDFOR
  ENDIF

  RETURN adjustedWeights
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond simply *measuring* performance impacts of content characteristics. It actively *adapts* to real-world conditions and device limitations to optimize the user experience. The predictive prefetching adds a proactive layer, mitigating latency and improving responsiveness. It effectively creates a self-tuning browser experience.
