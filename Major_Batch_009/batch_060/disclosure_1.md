## Automated Modular Tote Forming & Stacking System

**Concept:** A system that dynamically *forms* totes from flat, pre-cut material *in situ* before stacking, eliminating pre-formed totes altogether. This addresses limitations with standardized tote sizes and potential damage during transport/handling. It aims for a continuous flow system, forming, filling (optional module), and stacking without intermediate material handling.

**System Components:**

1.  **Material Feed System:** Roll of flexible, durable material (e.g., reinforced polymer, corrugated plastic) with precision cutting/scoring capabilities.
2.  **Forming Module:** A series of robotic arms and shaping tools. These tools will fold, crease, and bond the flat material into the desired tote configuration. Bonding can be achieved via ultrasonic welding, adhesive application, or thermal bonding.
3.  **Bottom/Base Formation:** Dedicated mechanism to create a rigid base for the tote during the forming process. This could involve folding and locking tabs, or applying a separate base panel.
4.  **Integrated Verification:** Sensors to confirm correct tote formation (dimensions, crease accuracy, base integrity) before proceeding.
5.  **Stacking Module:** Existing robotic arm and end effector (similar to the reference patent) adapted to handle the newly formed totes.  The end effector will need increased precision and adaptive gripping to accommodate minor variations in tote formation.
6.  **Palletizing System:** Standard palletizing robot.
7.  **Control System:** PLC and HMI for overall system control, recipe management (tote dimensions, material type), and error handling.

**Pseudocode (Forming Module):**

```
FUNCTION FormTote(tote_dimensions, material_type)
  1.  Retrieve material from roll.
  2.  Cut material to required size.
  3.  Initiate first fold (score line 1).
  4.  Apply pressure/heat to crease fold.
  5.  Repeat steps 3-4 for all score lines (based on tote_dimensions).
  6.  Form base (fold/lock tabs or apply base panel).
  7.  Verify tote formation (dimension check, crease accuracy, base integrity).
  8.  If verification fails:
      a.  Reject tote.
      b.  Return to step 1.
  9.  If verification passes:
      a.  Tote is ready for stacking.
      b.  Transfer tote to stacking module.
```
