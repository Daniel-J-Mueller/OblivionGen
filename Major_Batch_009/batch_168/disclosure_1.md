**Automated Item Re-Orientation & Stack Building System**

**Concept:** Expand the vision system’s capabilities to not only identify columns of items, but also to determine the optimal orientation for stacking those items on a subsequent conveyor. This system goes beyond simple singulation, aiming for automated stack building of consistently oriented products.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Vision System Enhancement:** High-resolution 3D vision system integrated with machine learning.  Capable of identifying item features (e.g., logos, unique shapes) and determining the “best” orientation for stacking based on pre-programmed criteria (e.g., logo facing up, consistent edge alignment). This would incorporate a training phase where 'good' and 'bad' orientations are taught to the AI.
*   **Singulation Conveyor Modification:**  Input conveyor equipped with individually addressable 'kickers' or small pneumatic actuators along its length. These are used for subtle adjustments to item positions *before* they reach the vision system.
*   **Re-Orientation Module:** A series of small, high-speed belts arranged perpendicularly to the main conveyor flow *after* the vision system. These belts are capable of ‘tapping’ or nudging items to rotate them slightly.  Each belt is individually controlled by the vision system's output.
*   **Stacking Conveyor:** A downstream conveyor designed for building stacks. This could utilize vacuum cups or other methods for secure item placement.
*   **Controller Integration:**  A central controller managing all components. The controller receives data from the vision system, calculates necessary re-orientation adjustments, and controls the kickers, re-orientation belts, and stacking conveyor.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Acquire Image Data
    image_data = vision_system.capture_image();

    // 2. Item Detection & Orientation Analysis
    item_data = vision_system.analyze_image(image_data); // Returns item positions, sizes, features

    for each item in item_data {
        best_orientation = determine_best_orientation(item.features);
        rotation_angle = calculate_rotation_angle(item.current_orientation, best_orientation);
    }

    // 3. Re-Orientation Control
    if (rotation_angle != 0) {
        activate_reorientation_module(rotation_angle);
    }

    // 4. Singulation & Transfer
    activate_singulation_conveyor_transfer();

    // 5. Stacking
    activate_stacking_conveyor_placement();
}

// Function: determine_best_orientation(item_features)
// Returns: ideal orientation (e.g., angle, position) for stacking
// Implementation: Uses machine learning model trained on preferred stacking configurations

// Function: calculate_rotation_angle(current_orientation, best_orientation)
// Returns:  Angle in degrees needed to rotate the item
// Implementation: Simple subtraction of angles
```
