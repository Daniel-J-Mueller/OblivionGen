## Adaptive Shard Weaving & Predictive Repair

**Concept:** Expand upon layered redundancy by introducing dynamic ‘weaving’ of shards *across* storage facilities, combined with predictive failure analysis and proactive shard replication. The goal is to move beyond static layering to a system that anticipates failures and proactively distributes data for faster, more resilient recovery.

**Specs:**

**1. Dynamic Shard Weaving Module:**

*   **Input:** Original data archives, redundancy code parameters (Erasure coding preferred), failure probability data for each data storage facility (historical data, real-time monitoring), and a user-defined performance/resilience target.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Shard Creation:** Generate shards using the specified redundancy code.
    2.  **Initial Placement:**  Distribute shards across multiple data storage facilities (as in the source patent).
    3.  **Weaving Analysis:** Employ a graph theory algorithm (e.g., minimum spanning tree, maximum flow) to model shard dependencies and inter-facility connectivity. This analysis identifies critical paths and potential single points of failure.
    4.  **Dynamic Replication:**  Replicate a subset of shards *beyond* the initial redundancy level. These replications are *not* static; they dynamically shift based on the weaving analysis.  Shards on failing/degrading facilities have increased replication, while those on stable facilities have reduced replication.
    5.  **Weaving Adjustment:** Re-evaluate the weaving graph and replication patterns at scheduled intervals (e.g., hourly, daily) or based on real-time monitoring alerts.
*   **Output:** A dynamic shard placement map specifying the location of each shard and its replication factor.

**2. Predictive Failure Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:**  Real-time monitoring data from each data storage facility (e.g., disk I/O rates, temperature, error logs, network latency). Historical failure data.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Anomaly Detection:** Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series analysis, autoencoders) to detect anomalies in the monitoring data.
    2.  **Failure Prediction:** Based on the detected anomalies and historical data, predict the probability of failure for each data storage facility.
    3.  **Risk Assessment:** Assign a risk score to each facility based on its failure probability and the criticality of the data it stores.
*   **Output:**  A list of data storage facilities ranked by risk score, along with predicted failure times.

**3. Proactive Repair & Data Migration Module:**

*   **Input:**  Risk assessment from the Predictive Failure Analysis Module, Dynamic Shard Placement Map.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Thresholding:** Define a threshold for the risk score. Facilities exceeding the threshold trigger proactive repair/migration.
    2.  **Data Migration:** Initiate data migration for shards stored on failing facilities. Migrate shards to facilities with lower risk scores.  The Dynamic Shard Weaving Module dynamically adjusts the shard placement map to reflect the migration.
    3.  **Repair Coordination:** If a facility is nearing failure but cannot be migrated immediately, pre-fetch required shards from replicas to prepare for fast recovery.
*   **Output:** Updated Shard Placement Map, coordinated data migration tasks, pre-fetched shards.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Collect Monitoring Data
    monitoringData = collectMonitoringDataFromAllFacilities();

    // 2. Predictive Failure Analysis
    riskAssessment = analyzeRisk(monitoringData);

    // 3. Dynamic Shard Weaving
    shardPlacementMap = weaveShards(riskAssessment);

    // 4. Proactive Repair & Migration
    migrateShards(shardPlacementMap);

    sleep(interval);
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-bandwidth, low-latency network interconnects between data storage facilities.
*   Dedicated processing resources for running the analysis and coordination modules.
*   Scalable storage infrastructure to accommodate the increased replication factor.
