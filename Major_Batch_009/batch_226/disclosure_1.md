## Dynamic Chunk Prediction & Pre-Enhancement

**Concept:** Extend the existing enhancement pipeline to *predict* which video chunks a user is likely to request *before* they request them, and pre-enhance those chunks. This significantly reduces latency and perceived buffering, particularly for streaming scenarios.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Enhancement Module (integrated into the existing video enhancement service)
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Streaming URL/Manifest File (HLS, DASH, etc.)
    *   User Viewing History (anonymized/opt-in data)
    *   Real-time User Playback Position
    *   Bandwidth Estimation (from existing system)
    *   Chunk Metadata (resolution, codec, keyframe status)
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Markov Chain Prediction:** Utilize a Markov Chain trained on aggregated user viewing patterns. This allows prediction of likely next chunks based on recent history.  Higher-order chains (e.g., predicting based on the last 3-5 chunks) improve accuracy.
    *   **Content Similarity Analysis:** Compare current chunk content (using feature extraction from the ML models already in use â€“ scene type, motion vectors, etc.) with historical chunk data. Predict likely next chunks based on similar content sequences.
    *   **Hybrid Prediction:** Combine Markov Chain and Content Similarity analysis for improved accuracy and robustness. Assign weights to each method based on performance metrics.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Upon request for a video, the service parses the streaming manifest.
    2.  The Predictive Enhancement Module analyzes the manifest and initiates prediction.
    3.  The module generates a "prediction queue" of likely next chunks, ranked by probability.
    4.  Selected chunks from the prediction queue are sent to the enhancement pipeline *before* they are requested by the user.  Enhancement parameters are determined as per the existing system.
    5.  Enhanced chunks are cached (local to the enhancement service, or via a CDN).
    6.  When the user requests a chunk, the service first checks the cache. If available, the enhanced chunk is served immediately. Otherwise, the standard enhancement process is initiated.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function predictNextChunks(manifest, userHistory, currentChunk, bandwidth):
  // Combine Markov Chain and Content Similarity
  markovPrediction = generateMarkovPrediction(userHistory, currentChunk)
  contentPrediction = generateContentPrediction(manifest, currentChunk)

  // Weighting factor (tune for performance)
  markovWeight = 0.6
  contentWeight = 0.4

  // Combine predictions based on weights
  combinedPrediction = (markovWeight * markovPrediction) + (contentWeight * contentPrediction)

  // Limit to a reasonable number of predicted chunks (e.g., 5-10)
  predictedChunks = takeTopN(combinedPrediction, 10)

  return predictedChunks
```

*   **Caching Strategy:**
    *   Time-to-Live (TTL) for cached chunks should be dynamically adjusted based on content volatility.  Keyframes and scenes with high motion might require shorter TTLs.
    *   Cache invalidation mechanism should be implemented to handle content updates or corrections.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Gracefully handle prediction failures or low confidence scores. Fallback to standard enhancement.
    * Monitor prediction accuracy and adjust weighting factors accordingly.
