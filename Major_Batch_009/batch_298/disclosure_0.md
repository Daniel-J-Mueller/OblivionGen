## Adaptive Resource Shaping via Predicted Workflow States

**Concept:** Extend the existing performance-based resource allocation to *proactively* shape resources based on predicted future workflow states, rather than solely reacting to current metrics. This moves beyond simple scaling *to* anticipated load and *into* pre-emptive configuration for optimal workflow execution.

**Specifications:**

**1. Workflow State Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical end-user workflow data (request types, frequencies, data sizes), time-series performance metrics (response times, CPU usage, memory consumption), external data sources (calendar events, marketing campaign schedules, news feeds potentially impacting user behavior).
*   **Process:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network, Prophet) trained on historical data to predict the probability distribution of future workflow states. States defined by vectors representing workload characteristics:  `[request_type_1_frequency, request_type_2_frequency, ..., average_request_size, expected_concurrency]`.
*   **Output:**  A probability distribution over possible workflow states for a defined prediction horizon (e.g., next 5 minutes, 15 minutes).  Output format:  `{state_1: probability_1, state_2: probability_2, ...}`.

**2. Resource Configuration Profiles:**

*   Definition: Pre-defined sets of resource configurations optimized for different workflow states. Examples:
    *   **Read-Heavy Profile:**  High cache allocation, lower CPU core count.
    *   **Write-Heavy Profile:**  High disk I/O capacity, increased CPU cores for transaction processing.
    *   **Complex Computation Profile:**  High GPU allocation, significant RAM.
*   Storage:  Stored as a JSON or YAML file, mapping workflow state vectors to corresponding resource configurations. Example:

```json
{
    "state_123": {
        "cpu_cores": 8,
        "memory_gb": 16,
        "disk_iops": 5000,
        "gpu_enabled": false
    },
    "state_456": {
        "cpu_cores": 4,
        "memory_gb": 8,
        "disk_iops": 1000,
        "gpu_enabled": true
    }
}
```

**3. Adaptive Resource Shaping Engine:**

*   **Process:**
    1.  Receive the predicted workflow state probability distribution from the Workflow State Prediction Module.
    2.  For each possible workflow state, retrieve the corresponding Resource Configuration Profile.
    3.  Calculate a weighted average resource configuration based on the probabilities of each state.  This results in a 'blended' configuration that anticipates future load.  For example:

        `blended_cpu_cores = (probability_state_1 * cpu_cores_state_1) + (probability_state_2 * cpu_cores_state_2) + ...`
    4.  Apply the blended configuration to the application's resources. This may involve:
        *   Scaling compute instances.
        *   Adjusting memory allocation.
        *   Provisioning/de-provisioning GPUs.
        *   Modifying network bandwidth.
    5.  Continuously monitor actual performance metrics and refine the prediction model and configuration profiles over time using reinforcement learning.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def shape_resources():
    predicted_states = predict_workflow_states()  # Returns {state: probability}
    blended_config = {}
    for state, probability in predicted_states.items():
        config = get_resource_config(state)
        for resource, value in config.items():
            if resource in blended_config:
                blended_config[resource] += value * probability
            else:
                blended_config[resource] = value * probability

    apply_configuration(blended_config)
    # Reinforcement Learning component to refine prediction & config over time
```

**Novelty:** This differs from the referenced patent by moving beyond *reactive* scaling based on current metrics to *proactive* shaping based on *predicted* future states, allowing for more granular and optimized resource allocation. The use of weighted averages to blend configurations provides a more nuanced approach than simple switching between predefined profiles.
