## Dynamic Payload-Driven Mesh Network Topology Reformation

**Concept:** Leveraging payload analysis to not just *route* data intelligently, but to *actively reshape* the mesh network topology in real-time. This moves beyond static or reactive routing to a proactive, self-optimizing network.

**Specs:**

**1. Topology Reformation Engine (TRE):**  A software component residing on each mesh node.

   *   **Input:** Real-time stream of payload type data from incoming/outgoing frames (as per the patent’s payload awareness). Network performance metrics (latency, throughput, link quality) for all links. Node resource availability (battery, processing).
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Payload Profile Generation:** Each node maintains a short-term history of payload types traversing it. This forms a ‘payload profile’ – a weighted distribution of traffic types.
        *   **Topology Score Calculation:** Based on the payload profile and current network performance, the TRE calculates a ‘topology score’ for each potential link. This score reflects how well that link serves the *current* traffic demands.  Factors included:
            *   **Payload-Link Affinity:** Some links may be inherently better suited for certain payload types (e.g., high-throughput links for video, low-latency links for voice).
            *   **Congestion Prediction:** Using historical data and current traffic, predict future congestion on links.
            *   **Resource Utilization:**  Factor in node battery levels and processing load.
        *   **Topology Reformation Decision:** If the topology score for a link falls below a threshold, the TRE initiates a ‘topology reformation’ request. This could involve:
            *   **Link Activation/Deactivation:** Temporarily enabling/disabling a link.
            *   **Power Level Adjustment:** Modifying transmission power to favor certain links.
            *   **Routing Protocol Modification:** Influencing the routing protocol to prioritize paths through links with high topology scores.
   *   **Output:**  Control signals for the RF module (power level, link on/off) and messages to influence the routing protocol.

**2.  Distributed Topology Score Aggregation (DTSA):**  Mechanism to share topology score information between nodes.

   *   **Protocol:** Nodes periodically broadcast their local topology scores to neighboring nodes.
   *   **Aggregation:** Each node aggregates the scores received from its neighbors, creating a ‘regional topology map’. This map provides a broader view of network performance and allows for more informed reformation decisions.
   *   **Weighting:** Scores are weighted based on the ‘trust’ relationship between nodes (e.g., based on historical reliability).

**3.  Adaptive Learning Module (ALM):** Responsible for refining the topology score calculation and learning optimal reformation strategies.

   *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to learn which reformation strategies yield the best results in different network conditions.
   *   **Reward Function:** Define a reward function that incentivizes improvements in network performance (throughput, latency, energy efficiency).
   *   **Model Updates:** Periodically update the topology score calculation model based on the learned rewards.



**Pseudocode (TRE - simplified):**

```
function calculateTopologyScore(link, payloadProfile):
  payloadAffinity = calculatePayloadAffinity(link, payloadProfile)
  congestionPrediction = predictCongestion(link)
  resourceUtilization = getResourceUtilization(link)
  score = (payloadAffinity * weight1) + (congestionPrediction * weight2) + (resourceUtilization * weight3)
  return score

function initiateTopologyReformation(link):
  if calculateTopologyScore(link, currentPayloadProfile) < threshold:
    // Send message to neighboring nodes to adjust routing
    // Adjust RF module power/state
    updateRoutingTable(link)
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simply *routing* data based on payload type. It proactively *changes* the network itself to better suit the current traffic demands.  It introduces a dynamic, self-optimizing layer on top of the existing mesh network infrastructure. The ALM adds a layer of adaptability, allowing the network to learn and improve over time.
