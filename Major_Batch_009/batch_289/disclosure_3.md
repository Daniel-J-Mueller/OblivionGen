## Dynamic Granularity Execution for RNN Layers

**Concept:** Extend the rolled/unrolled execution choice beyond the entire RNN to individual layers, *and* introduce a dynamic adjustment of this choice *during* execution based on real-time resource monitoring and performance feedback.

**Specification:**

**1. Layer-Level Execution Profiles:**

*   Each layer of the RNN is assigned a set of pre-defined execution profiles. These profiles include:
    *   **Rolled:** Standard sequential processing of time steps.
    *   **Unrolled (Factor X):**  Unrolls the layer for a limited number of time steps (X). X is a configurable parameter. Multiple "Unrolled (Factor X)" profiles exist, with different X values (e.g., Unrolled (2), Unrolled (4), Unrolled (8)).
    *   **Hybrid:**  Combines rolled and unrolled execution within the same layer.  The first N time steps are unrolled, then switches to rolled execution.

**2.  Real-Time Monitoring Module:**

*   Continuously monitors:
    *   CPU/GPU utilization
    *   Memory usage (per layer)
    *   Execution time per time step (per layer)
    *   Cache hit/miss rates (per layer)

**3. Policy Engine & Dynamic Adjustment:**

*   A reinforcement learning (RL) agent acts as the policy engine.
*   **State:** The state is a vector representing the real-time monitoring data (CPU, memory, time, cache) for each layer.
*   **Action:** The action is to select a different execution profile for a specific layer.
*   **Reward:** The reward function prioritizes:
    *   Minimizing overall execution time.
    *   Staying within memory constraints.
    *   Maximizing cache hit rates.
*   **Algorithm:** A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or similar on-policy RL algorithm. The RL agent learns an optimal policy for selecting execution profiles based on the current system state.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  During execution, the RL agent continuously evaluates the system state and, if it determines that a different execution profile would improve performance or resource utilization, triggers a switch to that profile for the corresponding layer. This switch occurs *during* the processing of the input sequence. A lightweight, optimized process handles the transition from one execution profile to another without interrupting the overall RNN execution.
*   **Constraints:**  The system includes configurable constraints to prevent excessive switching or the selection of profiles that would violate hard resource limits.  For instance, a minimum execution time threshold before allowing a switch.

**4. Profile Prioritization & Exploration:**

*   The RL agent employs an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration (trying new profiles) and exploitation (using the best known profiles).
*   A pre-training phase initializes the RL agent with a reasonable policy based on profiling different RNN architectures and input data types.

**5. Implementation Details:**

*   The system utilizes a graph-based representation of the RNN, where each node represents a layer. This allows for dynamic modification of the execution plan.
*   The execution profiles are implemented as optimized kernels that can be efficiently executed on the target hardware.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function select_execution_profile(layer, current_profile, state):
    if random() < epsilon: # Exploration
        available_profiles = [Rolled, Unrolled(2), Unrolled(4), Unrolled(8), Hybrid]
        return random_choice(available_profiles)
    else: # Exploitation
        action = RL_Agent.predict(state) # RL Agent predicts best profile
        return action
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved performance by dynamically adapting to changing resource conditions.
*   Reduced memory footprint by using rolled execution when appropriate.
*   Increased robustness to variations in input data and system load.
*   Automatic optimization of RNN execution without manual tuning.
