## Adaptive Granular Synthesis for Audio Restoration

**Concept:** Expand on the frequency-domain processing detailed in the patent by implementing an adaptive granular synthesis engine *within* the noise reduction pipeline. Instead of simply applying gains to frequency bands, reconstruct portions of the signal using short, synthesized “grains” derived from clean audio segments identified within the noisy input. This will allow for a more nuanced restoration, potentially preserving transient details lost during standard gain-based processing.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Engine – Granular Synthesis Module:**

*   **Grain Extraction:**
    *   Input: Frequency-domain representation of the audio signal (from FFT analysis).
    *   Process: Identify “clean” frequency bands (low noise floor) within each frame. Extract short segments (5-20ms) representing these clean portions. Store as “grains” in a buffer. Utilize a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) *before* FFT to prioritize clean segments from speech portions.
    *   Output: Grain Buffer – collection of short audio segments, indexed by frequency band & time frame.
*   **Grain Manipulation:**
    *   Input: Grain Buffer, current frame’s noisy frequency bands.
    *   Process: For each noisy frequency band in the current frame:
        *   Search the Grain Buffer for matching frequency content.
        *   Perform time-stretching/pitch-shifting of the grain to align with the current frame’s time & pitch.
        *   Apply a windowing function (e.g., Hann window) to the grain.
        *   Add the processed grain to the current frame’s frequency band.
    *   Output: Partially reconstructed frequency bands.
*   **Grain Density Control:**
    *   Input: Noise estimate (from patent’s approach), signal quality metric, user-adjustable “grain density” parameter.
    *   Process: Dynamically adjust the number of grains added to each frequency band based on the noise level and user preference. Higher noise levels = more grains.
    *   Output: Grain Density Map – indicates the number of grains to use for each frequency band.

**II. Noise Reduction Pipeline Integration:**

1.  **FFT Analysis:** Convert the noisy audio signal to the frequency domain.
2.  **Noise Estimation:** Utilize the patent’s minimum statistics/VAD approach for noise power estimation.
3.  **Grain Extraction & Storage:** Extract clean grains and store them in the Grain Buffer.
4.  **Frequency Band Reconstruction:** Reconstruct noisy frequency bands using the Granular Synthesis Module (steps outlined in section I).
5.  **Gain Application (Hybrid Approach):** After granular synthesis, apply the patent’s gain function (Savitzky-Golay filter) *to the residual* (the difference between the reconstructed signal and the original noisy signal). This handles remaining noise and artifacts.
6.  **Inverse FFT:** Convert the processed frequency-domain signal back to the time domain.
7.  **Output:** Cleaned audio signal.

**III. Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **Processor:** Requires significant processing power for FFT analysis, noise estimation, grain manipulation, and IFFT. Utilize parallel processing (multi-core CPU/GPU) to accelerate these tasks.
*   **Memory:** Large Grain Buffer required to store a sufficient number of clean audio segments.
*   **Software:** Implement in a real-time audio processing framework (e.g., JUCE, SuperCollider).
*   **User Interface:** Provide user-adjustable parameters for:
    *   Grain Density
    *   Grain Duration
    *   Grain Pitch Shift Range
    *   Gain Smoothing Strength

**Pseudocode (Grain Manipulation):**

```
function manipulate_grain(grain, target_frequency_band, current_time, current_pitch):
    // 1. Frequency Matching
    matched_grain = find_best_matching_grain(grain, target_frequency_band)

    // 2. Time Alignment
    stretched_grain = time_stretch(matched_grain, current_time)

    // 3. Pitch Shifting
    pitched_grain = pitch_shift(stretched_grain, current_pitch)

    // 4. Windowing
    windowed_grain = apply_hann_window(pitched_grain)

    return windowed_grain
```

This system attempts to go beyond simple gain adjustments by actively reconstructing audio segments, potentially resulting in more natural and detailed restoration. The hybrid approach (granular synthesis + gain application) seeks to combine the benefits of both techniques.
