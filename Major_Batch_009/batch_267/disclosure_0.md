**Dynamic Threat Landscape Visualization & Predictive Modeling**

**Concept:** Extend the threat notification system to incorporate a dynamic, interactive visualization of the threat landscape, coupled with predictive modeling capabilities to anticipate future threats.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Ingestion & Processing:**
    *   Extend existing data streams to include external threat intelligence feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, emerging vulnerability databases).
    *   Implement a data normalization and enrichment pipeline to standardize data formats and add contextual information.
    *   Develop a real-time data ingestion mechanism capable of handling high volumes of data.

2.  **Threat Landscape Visualization:**
    *   Create an interactive 3D map-based visualization. Nodes represent detected threats (correlations from the existing system) or vulnerabilities.  Node size/color indicates threat severity/confidence.
    *   Connections between nodes show relationships – e.g., shared IP addresses, common malware families, exploitation chains.
    *   Time-slider control to visualize the evolution of the threat landscape over time.  Allow playback of attack sequences.
    *   Filtering/search capabilities to focus on specific threats, vulnerabilities, or geographic regions.
    *   User-definable alerts based on changes in the threat landscape. (e.g., "Notify me if a new high-severity vulnerability is detected in a critical system.")

3.  **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   Integrate a machine learning engine trained on historical threat data and external intelligence feeds.
    *   Implement algorithms to predict potential attack vectors and identify systems at risk. (e.g., Bayesian Networks, Markov Models, Deep Learning).
    *   Develop a “Risk Score” for each system based on predicted threat exposure and vulnerability levels.
    *   Provide recommendations for proactive security measures. (e.g., patching vulnerable systems, implementing intrusion detection rules).

4.  **User Interface (UI):**
    *   Web-based UI accessible via standard browsers.
    *   Role-based access control. (e.g., Security Analysts, Incident Responders, System Administrators).
    *   Customizable dashboards to display key threat indicators.
    *   Integration with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
    *   API for programmatic access to threat data and predictive models.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Model Training):**

```
FUNCTION train_predictive_model(historical_data, threat_feeds)
  // historical_data:  Logs of past events, correlations, system vulnerabilities
  // threat_feeds: External intelligence feeds (VirusTotal, etc.)

  // Data Preprocessing
  cleaned_data = preprocess_data(historical_data, threat_feeds)

  // Feature Engineering
  features = extract_features(cleaned_data) // e.g., IP reputation, malware signatures, vulnerability scores

  // Model Selection (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
  model = select_model(features)

  // Train the Model
  model.train(features, labels) // labels:  "attack" or "normal"

  // Evaluate the Model
  accuracy, precision, recall = model.evaluate(test_data)

  // Save the Trained Model
  save_model(model, model_path)

  RETURN model
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers with sufficient CPU, memory, and storage.
*   Scalable database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, Cassandra).
*   Machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Web server and application framework (e.g., Apache, Django).
*   Data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Three.js).
