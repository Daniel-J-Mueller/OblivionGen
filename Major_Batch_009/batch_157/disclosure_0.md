## Dynamic Workspace Zoning with Projected Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Extend the short-range transmission system to dynamically create and project augmented reality “work zones” around workers and robots, influencing behavior beyond simple evasive maneuvers. These zones aren’t static; they’re generated and adjusted in real-time based on worker task, robot activity, and predicted trajectories.

**System Components:**

*   **Enhanced Short-Range Transmission:**  Existing RFID/short-range transmission tags & readers remain, but data transmitted now includes *task context* (worker) and *predicted trajectory* (robot).
*   **Projector Network:** A network of ceiling-mounted (or strategically placed) pico-projectors covering the warehouse floor. These aren’t for general illumination; they are dedicated to projecting AR elements.
*   **AR Engine & Zone Definition:** A centralized server running an AR engine. This engine defines "work zones" with varying properties (speed limits, restricted areas, notification zones) based on incoming data from the short-range transmission network.  Zones are represented as projected lines, colors, and potentially simple 3D shapes on the warehouse floor.
*   **Robot Visual System:** Robots are equipped with cameras and image processing to *interpret* projected zones.  
*   **Worker AR Interface (Optional):** Workers could optionally wear AR glasses/headsets to *visualize* the zones from their perspective, alongside task instructions and alerts. (This is not critical to core functionality.)

**Zone Types & Behaviors:**

*   **Velocity Zones:** Projected color gradients indicating safe speed limits.  Robots dynamically adjust their speed upon entering these zones.
*   **Exclusion Zones:** Solid projected lines/shapes designating areas where robots are prohibited. Robots halt upon approaching.
*   **Priority Zones:**  Areas where workers have priority. Robots slow down and yield right-of-way.
*   **Notification Zones:** (Around workers performing maintenance, for example).  Projected alerts warn robots and other workers of potential hazards.
*   **Dynamic Routing Overlays:** The system could project temporary path suggestions onto the floor, guiding robots around obstacles or towards specific pickup/delivery points.

**Pseudocode (Robot Logic):**

```
// Robot Main Loop

while (true) {

  // Receive data from central server (route, task)
  route = getServerRoute()
  task = getServerTask()

  // Detect projected zones using camera
  zones = detectZones()

  // Process zones and adjust behavior
  for (zone in zones) {
    if (zone.type == "Velocity") {
      targetSpeed = calculateSpeed(zone.speedLimit)
      adjustSpeed(targetSpeed)
    } else if (zone.type == "Exclusion") {
      halt()
    } else if (zone.type == "Priority") {
      yieldToWorker()
    }
  }

  // Follow route
  followRoute(route)
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Worker/Robot transmits location & activity data via short-range transmission.
2.  Central server processes data and defines dynamic work zones.
3.  Server instructs projector network to display zones on the floor.
4.  Robots "see" zones via cameras and adjust behavior accordingly.
5.  (Optional) Workers visualize zones via AR interface.

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple collision avoidance and creates a *proactive*, dynamically-adjusted workspace.  The projector-based AR allows for nuanced control of robot/worker interactions and can significantly improve safety and efficiency.  It isn't just about *reacting* to proximity; it’s about *shaping* the environment to optimize workflow.
