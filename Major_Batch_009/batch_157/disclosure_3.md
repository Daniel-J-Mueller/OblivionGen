**Adaptive Trust Scoring & Dynamic Access Control**

**Concept:** Extend the proxy-based access control to incorporate a dynamic trust score for users and third-party applications, influencing access granularity beyond simple allow/deny. This moves beyond just *where* the traffic flows, to *how* the user/app is behaving.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Trust Score Components:**
    *   **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor user/application interaction with the third-party site. Track metrics like data access patterns, time of day, frequency, and data modification attempts.  Deviations from established baselines lower the score.
    *   **Reputation Services:** Integrate with external reputation services to assess the risk associated with the third-party network site itself. Changes in the reputation (e.g., reported phishing activity) immediately impact access.
    *   **Device Posture:** Assess the security posture of the client device (OS version, antivirus status, firewall enabled). Compromised devices receive significantly lowered scores.
    *   **User Role/Group:**  Factor in the user's role within the organization.  High-privilege users (e.g., executives) may have stricter requirements or higher thresholds for acceptable risk.

2.  **Dynamic Access Control Levels:**  Implement granular access control beyond simple allow/deny:
    *   **Full Access:** (High Trust Score) - Unrestricted access to the third-party application.
    *   **Read-Only Access:** (Medium Trust Score) –  User can view data but cannot modify it.
    *   **Limited Functionality:** (Low Trust Score) – Only essential functions are available, with restrictions on data access and modification.
    *   **Blocked Access:** (Critical Low Trust Score) – Access is completely denied.

3.  **Proxy-Based Enforcement:**  The proxy server acts as the central enforcement point.
    *   **Real-time Score Calculation:** The proxy continuously calculates and updates the trust score based on incoming data from the above components.
    *   **Policy Engine:** A policy engine maps trust score ranges to specific access control levels.  Policies can be customized based on the third-party application, user group, and organizational risk tolerance.
    *   **Traffic Interception & Modification:** The proxy intercepts all traffic between the client and the third-party application.  Based on the trust score and policy, the proxy can:
        *   Allow the traffic to pass through unaltered.
        *   Block the traffic.
        *   Modify the traffic (e.g., strip out sensitive data, redirect to a different endpoint).

4.  **Alerting & Remediation:**
    *   **Threshold-Based Alerts:** Configure alerts to be triggered when trust scores fall below predefined thresholds.
    *   **Automated Remediation:**  Implement automated remediation actions, such as:
        *   Requiring multi-factor authentication.
        *   Initiating a device scan.
        *   Temporarily blocking access.

**Pseudocode (Proxy Server Logic):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  user = request.user
  thirdPartySite = request.destination
  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(user, thirdPartySite)
  accessLevel = determineAccessLevel(trustScore, thirdPartySite)

  if accessLevel == "Blocked":
    rejectRequest(request)
    logEvent("Blocked Access", user, thirdPartySite)
  elif accessLevel == "Limited":
    modifyRequest(request, "restrictDataAccess")
    forwardRequest(request)
    logEvent("Limited Access", user, thirdPartySite)
  elif accessLevel == "Read-Only":
    modifyRequest(request, "readOnlyAccess")
    forwardRequest(request)
    logEvent("Read-Only Access", user, thirdPartySite)
  else:
    forwardRequest(request)
    logEvent("Full Access", user, thirdPartySite)

function calculateTrustScore(user, thirdPartySite):
  behavioralScore = analyzeUserBehavior(user, thirdPartySite)
  reputationScore = getThirdPartyReputation(thirdPartySite)
  devicePostureScore = assessDevicePosture(user.device)
  roleScore = getUserRoleScore(user)
  return (behavioralScore + reputationScore + devicePostureScore + roleScore) / 4

```

This system allows for a more nuanced and adaptive approach to access control, going beyond simple allow/deny based on network location. The dynamic trust score provides a real-time risk assessment, enabling organizations to protect sensitive data and resources from unauthorized access.
