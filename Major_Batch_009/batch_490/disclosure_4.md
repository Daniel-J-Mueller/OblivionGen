## Dynamic Sensory Previews via Haptic & Olfactory MMS

**Concept:** Extend MMS beyond visual/audio content to include brief haptic and olfactory ‘previews’ of products, triggered by text-based requests. This builds on the patent’s existing MMS delivery, adding layers of sensory information.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Modified Mobile Devices: Devices capable of emitting localized haptic feedback (vibration patterns) and subtle scent dispersal. Integration could involve miniature haptic actuators and micro-diffusion scent cartridges.
    *   Merchant Server Infrastructure: Servers capable of generating sensory data profiles linked to product information. This requires a database correlating products with specific haptic & olfactory signatures.
    *   Scent Cartridge Standardization: Standardized, replaceable scent cartridges for mobile devices.  A subscription service could provide refills.
*   **Software Requirements:**
    *   MMS Encoding Extension: An extension to the MMS protocol allowing the inclusion of haptic/olfactory data alongside visual/audio content.  This could utilize a proprietary encoding scheme or an extension to existing MMS standards.
    *   Sensory Data Profile Generator:  Software that allows merchants to define ‘sensory profiles’ for products. This would involve assigning specific haptic patterns (e.g., texture, weight) and scent profiles (e.g., floral, spicy) to each item.  AI assistance could suggest profiles based on product descriptions.
    *   Mobile Device SDK: An SDK allowing app developers to integrate sensory MMS functionality into their applications.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  User sends a text request (SMS) to a merchant.
    2.  Merchant server receives request and identifies corresponding product.
    3.  Server retrieves product’s sensory profile (haptic & olfactory data) and compiles an MMS message including visual/audio content *and* sensory data.
    4.  MMS message is sent to the user’s mobile device.
    5.  Device receives MMS and triggers haptic actuators and scent dispersal mechanism according to the received sensory data.
*   **Pseudocode (Server-side compilation of MMS message):**

```
function compile_sensory_mms(user_request, product_data):
  # product_data contains visual, audio, haptic, and olfactory information

  mms_message = new MMSMessage()

  # Add visual and audio content
  mms_message.add_media(product_data.image)
  mms_message.add_audio(product_data.audio)

  # Add haptic data
  haptic_pattern = product_data.haptic_pattern
  mms_message.add_haptic(haptic_pattern)

  # Add olfactory data
  scent_code = product_data.scent_code
  mms_message.add_scent(scent_code)

  return mms_message
```

*   **Example Scenario:**

    A user texts “coffee” to a coffee shop. The shop sends back an MMS with a picture of the coffee, the sound of brewing coffee, a subtle vibration simulating the warmth of the cup, and the scent of roasted coffee beans.
