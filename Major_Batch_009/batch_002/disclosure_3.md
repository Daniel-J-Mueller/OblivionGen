## Dynamic Communication Space Creation & Projection

**Concept:** Extend the "joining a communication" concept to encompass not just audio/video, but a spatially aware, projected environment shared by participants. Think collaborative augmented reality overlaid *onto* the communication.

**Specs:**

*   **Core System:** A server-side engine capable of generating and maintaining a "communication space" - a virtual 3D environment. This space isn’t a fully realized VR experience, but a data structure describing objects and spatial relationships.
*   **Device Integration:** Compatible devices (phones, tablets, AR glasses, dedicated projection systems) act as “portals” into the communication space. Devices need:
    *   Spatial awareness: Utilizing cameras, LiDAR, or IMUs to map the physical surroundings.
    *   Projection/Display Capability: Able to overlay digital content onto the real world or display it on a screen.
    *   Audio Spatialization: Output audio directionally, corresponding to the virtual position of speakers within the communication space.
*   **Voice Command Extension:** Expand voice command recognition to include spatial manipulation commands. Examples: "Move the blueprint to the left," "Highlight section 3," "Zoom in on the model."
*   **Object Persistence:** Allow users to introduce persistent objects into the communication space – 3D models, documents, images, notes. These objects remain visible to all participants across sessions.
*   **Role-Based Access:** Implement granular access controls, allowing the communication space owner to define which users can manipulate objects or introduce new content.
*   **Adaptive Projection:**  The system should dynamically adjust the projected content based on the available surface area and the number of participants. For example, if using a small phone screen, it can display a 2D representation of the 3D space.  If using a wall projection, it can expand the environment accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Spatial Command Processing):**

```
function ProcessVoiceCommand(command, userId, communicationSpaceId) {
  if (command.startsWith("move")) {
    objectId = ExtractObjectId(command);
    direction = ExtractDirection(command);
    distance = ExtractDistance(command);

    // Retrieve object's current 3D coordinates
    objectCoordinates = GetObjectCoordinates(objectId, communicationSpaceId);

    // Apply transformation based on direction and distance
    newCoordinates = TransformCoordinates(objectCoordinates, direction, distance);

    // Update object's coordinates in the communication space data structure
    UpdateObjectCoordinates(objectId, newCoordinates, communicationSpaceId);

    // Broadcast updated coordinates to all participants
  } else if (command.startsWith("highlight")) {
    // Similar logic for highlighting objects
  } else if (command.startsWith("zoom")) {
      //Similar logic for zooming
  }
}

```

**Innovation Rationale:** This moves beyond simple communication *about* things to a collaborative *experience* with those things. It blends the physical and digital worlds, enabling richer interaction and understanding. Imagine remote design reviews where participants can manipulate a 3D model as if it were physically present, or remote medical consultations where doctors can annotate and analyze medical images together in a shared spatial context. This creates a fundamentally new way to communicate and collaborate.
