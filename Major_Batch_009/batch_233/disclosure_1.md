## Dynamic Feature Weighting Based on Counterfactual Performance

**Concept:** Extend the importance weighting concept to *dynamically* adjust feature weights within the treatment and control models based on counterfactual performance estimates. Instead of static weights correcting for group imbalances, apply individualized feature adjustments during model training.

**Specification:**

**1. Counterfactual Performance Estimator (CPE):**

*   **Input:** Candidate feature vector (X), Treatment/Control group indicator (T), Actual outcome (Y).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each candidate, generate a “flipped” data point: Swap the T indicator (0 -> 1, 1 -> 0).
    *   Predict the outcome (Y’) for both the original and flipped data points using a base model (initially, a simple regression or logistic regression).
    *   Calculate a counterfactual performance metric (CPM):  CPM = |Y - Y’|.  High CPM indicates the model prediction *changed significantly* with the flipped treatment indicator.
*   **Output:** CPM value for each candidate.

**2. Dynamic Feature Weighting Module (DFWM):**

*   **Input:** Candidate feature vector (X), CPM value, Learning rate (α).
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate a weighting factor (WF) for each feature: WF = exp(-α * CPM).  Higher CPM values result in lower weights. This penalizes features that significantly contribute to prediction changes based on treatment/control group.
    *   Multiply each feature value by its corresponding WF.
*   **Output:** Weighted feature vector.

**3. Integrated Model Training:**

*   **Process:**
    *   During training of both treatment and control models:
        *   For each batch of candidates:
            *   Calculate CPM values using the CPE.
            *   Apply the DFWM to generate weighted feature vectors.
            *   Train the model (regression or logistic regression) using the weighted feature vectors.
*   **Model Output:** Treatment model (predicting P(interaction | features, treatment)) and Control model (predicting P(interaction | features, no treatment)).

**4. Uplift Model & Prediction:**

*   Utilize the treatment and control model outputs as before to calculate the uplift (difference in predicted probabilities).  Base communication decisions on the uplift score.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# CPE function
def calculate_cpm(candidate_features, treatment_group, actual_outcome, base_model):
  #Predict outcome for original data point
  predicted_original = base_model.predict([candidate_features, treatment_group])
  #Flip the treatment group
  flipped_treatment = 1 - treatment_group
  #Predict outcome for flipped data point
  predicted_flipped = base_model.predict([candidate_features, flipped_treatment])
  #Calculate CPM
  cpm = abs(actual_outcome - predicted_flipped)
  return cpm

# DFWM function
def apply_dynamic_weights(candidate_features, cpm, learning_rate):
  weighted_features = []
  for feature in candidate_features:
    weighted_feature = feature * exp(-learning_rate * cpm)
    weighted_features.append(weighted_feature)
  return weighted_features

# Training Loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  for batch in data_loader:
    features, treatment_group, outcomes = batch
    
    cpm_values = [calculate_cpm(f, t, o, base_model) for f, t, o in zip(features, treatment_group, outcomes)]
    weighted_features = [apply_dynamic_weights(f, cpm, learning_rate) for f, cpm in zip(features, cpm_values)]
    
    # Train treatment/control models using weighted_features, treatment_group, outcomes
    loss = calculate_loss(model(weighted_features), outcomes)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

**Rationale:** This approach moves beyond static group correction to individualized feature adjustments. By penalizing features that are highly sensitive to treatment/control assignment, the model learns a more robust and accurate representation of the underlying effects. This could lead to more precise uplift predictions and improved targeting of communications.
