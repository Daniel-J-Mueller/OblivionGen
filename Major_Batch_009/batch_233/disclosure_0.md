## Dynamic Document ‘Heatmaps’ & Proactive Revision Suggestions

**Concept:** Leverage reading activity *and* comment density to generate dynamic “heatmaps” overlaid onto the document, coupled with AI-driven proactive revision suggestions presented *within* the document itself.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Collection & Processing:**

*   **Reading Activity Tracking:**  Beyond page turns, time spent on sections, and repeated views, track *scroll depth* within a section. This provides granular insight into where readers are struggling or focusing intently.
*   **Comment Density Calculation:** Algorithm calculates comment ‘density’ per paragraph/section (number of comments / word count or character count).
*   **Combined ‘Attention Score’:** A weighted formula combines reading activity data (scroll depth, time spent, repeat views) with comment density to generate an ‘Attention Score’ for each document section.  Weights are adjustable via a system admin panel.
*   **Real-Time Update:** Attention Scores are calculated and updated in near real-time as readers interact with the document.

**2. Document Overlay & Visualization:**

*   **Heatmap Generation:**  Attention Scores drive a color-coded heatmap overlay directly onto the document within the reading interface.  Low scores = cool colors (blue, green). High scores = warm colors (yellow, red).
*   **Adjustable Heatmap Opacity:** User-adjustable opacity to control the visibility of the heatmap.
*   **Section Highlighting:** Option to highlight sections with Attention Scores above a user-defined threshold.
*   **Toggleable Views:**  Users can toggle between standard document view, heatmap view, and a combined view.

**3. AI-Driven Revision Suggestions:**

*   **NLP Integration:** Integrate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) to analyze sections with high Attention Scores.
*   **Suggestion Generation:** The NLP engine identifies potential issues:
    *   **Clarity:**  Flags complex sentences or jargon.
    *   **Conciseness:** Suggests removing redundant phrases.
    *   **Logical Flow:**  Identifies areas where the argument may be unclear or disjointed.
    *   **Potential Misinterpretation:** Flags phrases prone to multiple interpretations.
*   **Inline Suggestions:**  Revision suggestions are displayed *inline* within the document, similar to spell-checking suggestions.  Users can:
    *   Accept the suggestion (automatically modifies the document).
    *   Reject the suggestion.
    *   Edit the suggestion.
    *   Provide feedback on the suggestion's quality.
*   **Suggestion Prioritization:**  Suggestions are prioritized based on:
    *   Attention Score of the section.
    *   Severity of the issue (e.g., a critical clarity issue is higher priority than a minor conciseness suggestion).
    *   User feedback on previous suggestions.

**4. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Server-Side
function calculateAttentionScore(section, readingActivityData, commentDensity) {
    // Weighted formula – weights configurable via admin panel
    attentionScore = (readingActivityWeight * readingActivityData) + (commentDensityWeight * commentDensity);
    return attentionScore;
}

function generateRevisionSuggestions(sectionText) {
    // Call NLP engine to analyze sectionText
    suggestions = NLP_Engine.analyze(sectionText);
    // Prioritize suggestions based on severity, attention score, user feedback
    prioritizedSuggestions = prioritizeSuggestions(suggestions, attentionScore, userFeedback);
    return prioritizedSuggestions;
}

// Client-Side (Reading Interface)
function renderDocumentWithHeatmap(documentData, heatmapData) {
    // Overlay heatmap onto document based on heatmapData
    // (Color-code sections based on attention scores)
}

function displayRevisionSuggestions(sectionText, suggestions) {
    // Display suggestions inline within the sectionText
    // (Allow user to accept, reject, or edit suggestions)
}
```

**Future Considerations:**

*   **Personalized Suggestions:** Tailor suggestions based on the reader's expertise and role.
*   **Automated Revision:** Option to automatically apply a set of revisions based on a confidence threshold.
*   **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different phrasing options and measure their impact on reader comprehension.
*   **Integration with Version Control:** Track revisions and allow users to revert to previous versions.
