## Dynamic Subnetwork Composition via Reinforcement Learning

**Specification:** A system for dynamically composing fully-connected subnetworks within a larger neural network layer, optimized by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent.

**Concept:** The provided patent details a static grouping of fully-connected layers. This design introduces a *dynamic* approach, leveraging RL to determine which subnetworks are activated for a given input, adapting to complex data distributions and minimizing computational cost.

**System Components:**

1.  **Subnetwork Library:** A collection of pre-trained, fully-connected subnetworks, each specializing in a different feature space or a subset of target classes. This library is expandable and updated periodically. Each subnetwork is assigned a cost (computational resources) and an estimated accuracy for various input types.
2.  **RL Agent:** A Q-learning or Policy Gradient agent.  The agent's state space consists of features extracted from the input data (e.g., activation patterns from preceding layers, statistical properties of the input). The action space consists of selecting which subnetworks to activate. The reward function is based on a combination of classification accuracy, computational cost, and latency.
3.  **Gating Network:** A small, fully-connected network that receives the output of the RL Agent and generates weights (between 0 and 1) for each subnetwork in the library. These weights determine the contribution of each subnetwork to the final classification.
4.  **Fusion Layer:** A weighted summation layer that combines the outputs of the activated subnetworks, using the weights generated by the gating network.
5.  **Training Procedure:**
    *   Pre-train the individual subnetworks on a large dataset.
    *   Freeze the weights of the subnetworks during RL training.
    *   Train the RL agent and gating network using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The agent learns to select the optimal combination of subnetworks for each input based on the reward function.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# Input: Input data 'x'
# Subnetwork Library: List of pre-trained subnetworks
# RL Agent: Trained reinforcement learning agent
# Gating Network: Trained fully-connected network

# 1. Feature Extraction:
features = extract_features(x)

# 2. Action Selection:
action = RL_Agent.select_action(features) # Returns a list of subnetwork indices to activate

# 3. Subnetwork Activation:
subnetwork_outputs = []
for subnetwork_index in action:
    output = Subnetwork_Library[subnetwork_index](x)
    subnetwork_outputs.append(output)

# 4. Gating Network:
weights = Gating_Network(features) # Generates weights for each activated subnetwork

# 5. Fusion:
weighted_sum = 0
for i, output in enumerate(subnetwork_outputs):
    weighted_sum += weights[i] * output

# 6. Output:
final_output = softmax(weighted_sum)
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Subnetwork Library Size:** Scalable, potentially containing thousands of specialized subnetworks.
*   **RL Algorithm:**  Prioritize algorithms that can handle continuous action spaces (e.g., DDPG, SAC) to allow for finer-grained control of subnetwork weights.
*   **Reward Function:** A weighted combination of accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. The weights should be tunable to optimize for different application requirements.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Implement the system on hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) to achieve real-time performance.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Implement a mechanism for periodically retraining the RL agent and updating the subnetwork library to adapt to changing data distributions.
*   **Evaluation Metric:** Measure the system's performance in terms of accuracy, latency, energy consumption, and model size.
