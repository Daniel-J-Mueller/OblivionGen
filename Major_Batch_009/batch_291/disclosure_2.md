## Dynamic Graph Persona Generation & Predictive Walk

**Concept:** Extend the diversified random walk by dynamically generating "personas" represented as subgraph modifications *during* the walk, influenced by user interaction and node attributes. This enables a more nuanced and adaptive recommendation engine, moving beyond static bias towards emergent behavioral modeling.

**Specs:**

**I. Persona Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Current node (source), User Interaction History (clickstream, purchases), Node Attribute Vector (tags, categories, price, etc.), Global Graph Structure.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Attribute Extraction:** Identify salient attributes of the current node.
    2.  **Persona Template Selection:** Based on user history, select a 'persona template' - a predefined subgraph modification pattern. Examples:
        *   *Price Sensitive:*  Increase edge weights towards lower-priced nodes.
        *   *Category Explorer:*  Expand the graph around related categories, increasing edge weights to nodes within those categories.
        *   *Brand Loyal:* Increase edge weights towards nodes associated with brands frequently interacted with by the user.
        *   *Novelty Seeker:* Add edges to nodes with low co-access counts.
    3.  **Subgraph Modification:** Apply the selected template, temporarily modifying edge weights *within a localized region* of the graph (e.g., k-hop neighborhood of the current node).  This creates a transient 'persona-graph'.
*   **Output:** Modified local graph structure (persona-graph) for the current walk step.

**II. Predictive Walk Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Persona-graph, Current Node, User Interaction History, Global Graph Structure.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Weight Calculation:** Calculate edge weights for outgoing edges, incorporating both co-access frequency *and* the persona-graph modifications.
        *   `Weight(edge) = CoAccessFrequency * PersonaModifier + Bias`
        *   `PersonaModifier` scales the co-access weight based on how strongly the persona aligns with the edge.
    2.  **Probability Distribution:** Normalize the weights to create a probability distribution for the next node.
    3.  **Node Selection:**  Select the next node based on the probability distribution.
    4.  **Persona Reset:** After a fixed number of steps (e.g., 5-10), revert the subgraph modifications created by the Persona Generation Module. This prevents overly rigid recommendations and allows the walk to adapt to new user interactions.
*   **Output:** Sequence of visited nodes.

**III. Recommendation Generation:**

*   **Input:** Sequence of visited nodes.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Node Scoring:** Assign a score to each visited node based on:
        *   Frequency of visits.
        *   Depth of visit within the walk (later visits are more significant).
        *   Node attribute alignment with user preferences (refined by the Persona Generation process).
    2.  **Top-N Recommendation:** Recommend the top N nodes with the highest scores.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Walk Step):**

```
function walkStep(currentNode, userHistory, graph, personaTemplates) {
  // 1. Generate Persona
  persona = generatePersona(currentNode, userHistory, personaTemplates)

  // 2. Modify Local Graph (create persona-graph)
  personaGraph = modifyGraph(graph, persona)

  // 3. Calculate Edge Weights (using personaGraph)
  edgeWeights = calculateEdgeWeights(personaGraph, currentNode)

  // 4. Select Next Node (based on edge weights)
  nextNode = selectNextNode(edgeWeights)

  return nextNode
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static bias weights towards dynamic, emergent behavioral modeling. The transient persona-graphs create a ‘sandbox’ for exploration within the existing graph structure, enabling more nuanced and adaptable recommendations. This allows the system to ‘try on’ different user ‘personas’ during the walk, leading to more surprising and relevant recommendations. The periodic reset of the persona-graph prevents over-specialization and encourages continued exploration.
