## Adaptive Key Revocation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Enhance the key revocation process by integrating behavioral biometrics to dynamically adjust revocation thresholds and response strategies. This system moves beyond simple uniqueness checks to assess the *likelihood* of key compromise based on user behavior *after* a potential uniqueness violation is detected.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, touch patterns, scrolling speed, application usage patterns, network traffic patterns).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Data normalization and feature extraction.
    *   Creation of a personalized behavioral profile for each key/user pair.
    *   Continuous monitoring of behavioral data.
*   **Output:** A “Behavioral Risk Score” (BRS) ranging from 0-100, representing the deviation from the established user profile. Higher scores indicate increased risk.

**2.  Uniqueness Violation Detection Integration:**

*   **Input:** Signal from the existing uniqueness check system (patent 9602288) indicating a potential violation.
*   **Processing:** Upon detecting a uniqueness violation, immediately trigger a query to the Behavioral Data Collection Module for the current BRS of the associated user.
*   **Output:**  Combined risk assessment: a “Total Risk Score” calculated as:  `Total Risk Score = (Uniqueness Violation Risk Weight * Uniqueness Risk) + (Behavioral Risk Weight * BRS)`.  (Weights are configurable).

**3. Adaptive Revocation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Total Risk Score.
*   **Processing:** Implement a tiered response system based on the Total Risk Score:
    *   **Score 0-30 (Low Risk):** Log the event, increase monitoring frequency, but no immediate action.
    *   **Score 31-60 (Medium Risk):** Initiate a multi-factor authentication challenge.  If the challenge fails, temporarily suspend access and require manual review.
    *   **Score 61-80 (High Risk):** Immediately revoke the key and initiate an automated incident response workflow (e.g., alert security team, lock affected accounts).
    *   **Score 81-100 (Critical Risk):**  Force a full system lockout and initiate a forensic investigation.
*   **Output:** Key revocation (if applicable), alert notifications, automated incident response actions.

**4. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Input:** Historical data on false positives/negatives, incident reports, security analysis.
*   **Processing:** Employ a machine learning algorithm to continuously refine the weights assigned to Uniqueness Violation Risk and Behavioral Risk, as well as the thresholds for each risk tier.
*   **Output:** Updated configuration parameters for the Adaptive Revocation Engine.

**5.  Secure Enclave Integration:**

*   All behavioral data and the BRS calculation must be performed within a secure enclave (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone) to protect against tampering and data leakage.



**Pseudocode (Adaptive Revocation Engine):**

```
function RevokeKey(UniquenessViolationDetected, UserID):
  UniquenessRisk = GetUniquenessRiskScore(UniquenessViolationDetected)
  BRS = GetBehavioralRiskScore(UserID)
  TotalRiskScore = (UniquenessRiskWeight * UniquenessRisk) + (BehavioralRiskWeight * BRS)

  if TotalRiskScore <= 30:
    LogEvent("Uniqueness Violation - Low Risk - User: " + UserID)
    IncreaseMonitoringFrequency(UserID)
  else if TotalRiskScore <= 60:
    ChallengeUserWithMFA(UserID)
    if MFA_Failed:
      SuspendAccount(UserID)
      ManualReviewRequired(UserID)
  else if TotalRiskScore <= 80:
    RevokeKey(UserID)
    AlertSecurityTeam(UserID)
    LockAffectedAccounts(UserID)
  else:
    ForceSystemLockout()
    InitiateForensicInvestigation()

```

This system moves beyond a static rule-based approach to key revocation. It dynamically assesses risk based on a combination of cryptographic integrity checks and user behavior, offering a more nuanced and adaptive security posture.
