## Adaptive Application Image Composition

**Concept:** Dynamically compose application images at instantiation time by layering pre-built, modular components. This allows for extreme customization and optimization based on the specific request and available resources.

**Specification:**

1.  **Modular Component Repository:** A central repository storing application components. These components are self-contained and expose well-defined interfaces. Categories include:
    *   Core Functionality (e.g., image processing, data parsing)
    *   Data Access Layers (connectors to various databases)
    *   Security Modules (authentication, authorization)
    *   Networking Adapters (support for different protocols)
2.  **Request Analysis Module:**  This module analyzes incoming requests (represented by the work token) to determine the required components. It examines:
    *   Request Type: What kind of processing is needed?
    *   Data Format:  What type of data is being processed?
    *   Security Requirements: What level of access control is necessary?
    *   Resource Constraints: What are the available CPU, memory, and network resources?
3.  **Composition Engine:**  Based on the Request Analysis, the Composition Engine selects the appropriate components and creates a customized application image. This involves:
    *   Component Selection: Choosing components based on compatibility and performance.
    *   Image Layering: Combining selected components into a layered image format (e.g., using container layering technologies).
    *   Configuration Generation:  Creating configuration files that define how the components interact.
4.  **Dynamic Image Instantiation:**  The hypervisor instantiates the virtual computer system using the dynamically composed image.
5.  **Runtime Adaptation (Optional):**  The system monitors the virtual computer system's performance during request processing. If performance degrades, it can dynamically swap out components for optimized versions or adjust resource allocations.

**Pseudocode (Composition Engine):**

```
function composeImage(workToken) {
  requestAnalysis = analyzeRequest(workToken);
  requiredComponents = determineComponents(requestAnalysis);

  imageLayers = [];
  for each component in requiredComponents {
    layer = retrieveComponent(component);
    imageLayers.append(layer);
  }

  configuration = generateConfiguration(imageLayers);

  finalImage = assembleImage(imageLayers, configuration);

  return finalImage;
}

function assembleImage(layers, config) {
    // Combines layers according to the specified configuration,
    // potentially utilizing container layering or other image building technologies.
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-speed storage for component repository.
*   Robust containerization technology (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
*   A scheduling system that can manage dynamic image instantiation.
*   Monitoring tools for performance analysis.
