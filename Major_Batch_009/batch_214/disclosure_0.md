## Dynamic Network Persona Creation & Predictive Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply classifying networks based on latency/throughput. Create *dynamic network personas* built from a much wider range of data points, then *predictively* adjust settings *before* performance degradation is observed.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Persona Building:**

1.  **Expanded Data Set:** Gather data *beyond* latency and throughput. Include:
    *   Application-level data (e.g., video streaming codec, game type, web browsing activity – anonymized).
    *   Time of day/week.
    *   Geolocation (coarse – city-level).
    *   Device type & OS.
    *   Wireless signal strength/interference.
    *   Battery level (for mobile devices).
    *   Network congestion estimates (from public sources or ISP data – if available/permitted).
2.  **Feature Engineering:**  Process raw data into relevant features. Examples:
    *   "Streaming Video Bitrate Demand" (derived from codec & resolution).
    *   "Gaming Network Priority Need" (based on game type – FPS vs. turn-based).
    *   "Commute Network Load Expectation" (time of day + geolocation = predicted congestion).
3.  **Persona Clustering:** Employ a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models) using the engineered features to create dynamic network personas.  These personas represent common network usage patterns.  The number of personas should be adaptable based on data volume and variance.
4.  **Persona Profiling:** For each persona, calculate a performance baseline (average latency, throughput, jitter) and identify key settings that *most* influence performance.
5. **Continuous Learning:** Implement a feedback loop.  Monitor performance after setting adjustments and update persona profiles accordingly.

**II. Predictive Adjustment Engine:**

1.  **Real-time Persona Assignment:** Continuously analyze network data from the device to assign it to the *most likely* active persona.  Use a probabilistic model to handle uncertainty.
2.  **Predictive Modeling:** For each persona, train a time-series model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict future network performance based on historical data.  Inputs: time, persona features, current network data.  Output: predicted latency, throughput.
3.  **Proactive Adjustment:**  If the predictive model forecasts performance degradation *below a threshold*, proactively adjust network settings *before* the user experiences a problem.  Settings to adjust:
    *   TCP congestion control algorithm.
    *   Buffer sizes.
    *   QoS prioritization.
    *   DNS server selection.
    *   Adaptive bitrate settings (for streaming).
4.  **A/B Testing & Optimization:**  Continuously A/B test different adjustment strategies to identify the *most effective* settings for each persona.
5.  **Personalized Adjustment Profiles**: Develop individualized adjustment profiles based on user behavior and preferences.

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Edge Agent:**  Runs on the device. Collects network data, performs initial feature engineering, assigns the device to a persona, and applies adjustments.
2.  **Cloud Platform:**  Handles persona clustering, predictive modeling, A/B testing, and data aggregation.
3.  **API:** Enables communication between the edge agent and the cloud platform.

**Pseudocode (Edge Agent - Simplified):**

```
loop:
    networkData = collectNetworkData()
    features = engineerFeatures(networkData)
    persona = assignPersona(features)
    predictedPerformance = predictPerformance(persona, features)
    if predictedPerformance < threshold:
        adjustmentParameters = getAdjustmentParameters(persona)
        applyAdjustmentParameters(adjustmentParameters)
    sendDataToCloud(networkData, features, appliedAdjustments)
end loop
```
