## Adaptive Proxy with Behavioral Analysis

**Specification:** Develop a proxy system that learns typical user/client behavior and dynamically adjusts access control beyond static whitelists/blacklists. This moves beyond simple rule-based access to a system that assesses *how* a client accesses resources, rather than just *what* resources.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiler:** This module analyzes network traffic patterns from each client. Metrics include:
    *   Time of day access patterns.
    *   Frequency of requests for specific resources.
    *   Sequence of resource requests (e.g., accessing A then B is normal, A then C is unusual).
    *   Data transfer volumes.
    *   Geographic location of access (if detectable and permitted).
    *   Device type/browser fingerprint.

2.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Implements machine learning algorithms (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) to identify deviations from established behavioral profiles.  A threshold for anomaly score will be configurable per client.

3.  **Dynamic Access Control:**  Based on the anomaly score, the proxy adjusts access levels:
    *   **Low Anomaly:**  Access granted as normal.
    *   **Medium Anomaly:**  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) challenge initiated *before* resource access.  Client is prompted for additional verification.  If MFA fails, access denied.
    *   **High Anomaly:**  Access temporarily blocked.  Alert sent to security operations team.  Automated investigation initiated.

4.  **Feedback Loop:**  The system continuously learns from user interactions.
    *   If a user successfully completes an MFA challenge after a medium anomaly, the behavioral profile is updated to incorporate that activity.
    *   Security team feedback on blocked access attempts is used to refine anomaly detection thresholds.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine):**

```
function detectAnomaly(client_id, request_data):
  profile = loadClientProfile(client_id)
  if profile == null:
    // Initial profile – allow access, start learning
    return 0  // No anomaly

  // Extract features from request_data
  features = extractFeatures(request_data)

  // Calculate distance from normal behavior
  distance = calculateDistance(features, profile.average_features)

  // Calculate anomaly score
  anomaly_score = distance * profile.sensitivity

  // Apply threshold
  if anomaly_score > profile.threshold:
    return anomaly_score
  else:
    return 0
```

**Configuration:**

*   **Client Sensitivity:**  Each client can be assigned a sensitivity level (low, medium, high) to adjust the strictness of anomaly detection.  Higher sensitivity means more false positives, but also faster detection of malicious activity.
*   **Learning Period:**  The initial period during which the system learns a client’s behavior without applying strict access control.
*   **Resource-Specific Profiles:**  The ability to create separate behavioral profiles for different resources.  For example, accessing a sensitive database might require a stricter profile than accessing a public website.
*   **Alerting Rules:**  Configuration of alerting thresholds and notification mechanisms for security operations.

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-throughput proxy servers.
*   Scalable data storage for behavioral profiles.
*   Machine learning platform for anomaly detection.
*   Real-time data processing pipeline.
*   Secure communication channels for MFA and alerting.
