**Adaptive Contextual Webpage Reconstruction**

**Concept:** Leverage the browsing history tracking demonstrated in the patent to *reconstruct* webpages dynamically for each user, prioritizing information predicted to be most relevant *based* on that history.  Instead of simply *associating* a user with a characteristic, *change* the webpage they see.

**Specifications:**

1.  **History Aggregation & Prediction Module:**
    *   Input:  User’s browsing history (URLs visited, time spent, interactions – clicks, scrolls, form submissions) as captured by the core patent mechanism.
    *   Process:  Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, transformer) trained to predict the user’s information needs *within* the context of the current webpage. This model learns patterns between visited pages and preferred content types.  Key features:
        *   Content Categorization:  Automatically categorize content on visited pages (e.g., “product reviews”, “price comparisons”, “technical specifications”).
        *   Relevance Scoring:  Assign a relevance score to each content category based on frequency of visits and engagement time.
        *   Contextual Awareness: Integrate current webpage content analysis to refine relevance scores.
    *   Output: A ranked list of content categories and associated relevance scores *specific to the user and current webpage*.

2.  **Dynamic Webpage Componentizer:**
    *   Input: Original webpage HTML, Relevance Scores (from Module 1).
    *   Process:
        *   HTML Parsing: Parse the HTML into a DOM tree.
        *   Component Identification: Identify logical “components” within the page (e.g., sections, articles, sidebars, product listings). Use CSS selectors or semantic HTML tags.
        *   Component Ranking: Rank components based on relevance to the user, weighted by the content category of the component.
        *   Component Prioritization: Determine which components to display *initially* (above the fold), which to load on demand, and which to hide entirely.  Components with low relevance are candidates for hiding or lazy loading.
    *   Output: A modified DOM tree representing the prioritized webpage.

3.  **Client-Side Rendering & Execution:**
    *   Input: Prioritized DOM tree, Original webpage assets (CSS, JavaScript, images).
    *   Process:
        *   Initial Render: Render the prioritized components above the fold.
        *   Lazy Loading: Load remaining components on demand as the user scrolls or interacts with the page.  Use techniques like Intersection Observer to trigger loading.
        *   Content Injection:  Dynamically inject additional content or modify existing content based on user preferences. (e.g. if a user repeatedly views "discount" pages, inject discount banners into other webpages.)
        *   JavaScript Execution: Execute any JavaScript on the page, ensuring compatibility with the modified DOM.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - simplified):**

```
function loadPage(html, userData) {
  let dom = parseHTML(html);
  let prioritizedDom = prioritizeComponents(dom, userData);
  renderInitialView(prioritizedDom);

  // Intersection Observer to lazy load
  observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        loadComponent(entry.target);
        observer.unobserve(entry.target);
      }
    });
  });

  let components = document.querySelectorAll('.lazy-load');
  components.forEach(component => {
    observer.observe(component);
  });
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `userData`: Object containing user's browsing history, preferred content categories, and relevance scores.
*   `component`: DOM element with attributes specifying its content category and priority.

**Novelty:**  This isn't just about *knowing* what a user likes; it’s about actively *changing* the webpage they experience to align with those preferences, going beyond simple personalization or targeted content injection. It creates a truly adaptive web experience.
