## Dynamic Data Partitioning & Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** A system for intelligently partitioning data objects *during* the initial scan and subsequent query execution, combined with a predictive prefetching mechanism based on query history and data distribution.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on creating metadata *after* the scan. This spec proposes interleaving metadata generation with data partitioning *during* the scan, and then using that partitioning for parallel query execution *and* predictive prefetching. This dramatically reduces latency and improves scalability.

**Components:**

1.  **Scan & Partition Engine:**  An engine integrated with the object data store that performs the initial scan of the unstructured data. *Crucially*, it doesn't just build metadata; it actively partitions the data object into smaller, logically-defined segments based on key characteristics observed during the scan. These characteristics could include:
    *   **Value Ranges:** Partitioning based on ranges of values within specific columns/fields.
    *   **Frequency Distributions:**  Creating segments based on the frequency of values.  Rare values get separate segments.
    *   **Data Types:** Segregating data based on data type.
    *   **Delimiter Patterns:** Identifying complex delimiters to create logical segments.

2.  **Dynamic Metadata Store:** A metadata store capable of reflecting the dynamic partitioning scheme.  The metadata isn't just offsets; it's a mapping of logical segments to physical storage locations.  This must be fast and mutable.

3.  **Query Planner with Partition Awareness:** A query planner that *understands* the dynamic partitioning scheme. It rewrites queries to operate on the relevant segments directly, rather than scanning the entire object.

4.  **Predictive Prefetch Engine:** A component that learns from query history and data distribution to predict which segments will be needed for future queries. It proactively prefetches these segments into faster storage tiers (e.g., RAM, SSD).

**Pseudocode (Query Planner):**

```
function plan_query(query, metadata_store):
  // Parse query to identify filtering criteria (WHERE clause)
  filters = parse_filters(query)

  // Identify relevant segments based on filters
  relevant_segments = metadata_store.get_segments(filters)

  // Rewrite query to operate only on relevant segments
  rewritten_query = rewrite_query(query, relevant_segments)

  // Generate execution plan for rewritten query
  execution_plan = generate_execution_plan(rewritten_query)

  return execution_plan
```

**Pseudocode (Predictive Prefetch Engine):**

```
function predict_next_segments(query_history, metadata_store):
  // Analyze query history to identify common patterns
  patterns = analyze_query_history(query_history)

  // Based on patterns, predict segments likely to be needed
  predicted_segments = predict_segments_from_patterns(patterns, metadata_store)

  // Prefetch predicted segments into faster storage
  prefetch_segments(predicted_segments)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Segment Metadata:**  {segment_id: UUID, start_offset: INT, end_offset: INT, data_characteristics: DICTIONARY, storage_location: STRING}
*   **Query History:**  [ {query_string: STRING, timestamp: TIMESTAMP, accessed_segments: LIST<UUID>} ]

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Scan & Partition Engine should be highly configurable, allowing administrators to define partitioning rules based on their specific data and workload.
*   The Dynamic Metadata Store needs to be extremely performant, with low latency reads and writes. A distributed, in-memory database could be a good choice.
*   The Predictive Prefetch Engine should use machine learning techniques to improve its accuracy over time.
*   Consider using a tiered storage architecture, with different storage tiers optimized for different types of data and access patterns.
