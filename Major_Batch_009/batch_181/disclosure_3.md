## Decentralized Manifest & Transfer Validation – “Project Chimera”

**Concept:** Extend the manifest & validation process beyond a centralized secure network, leveraging a distributed ledger (blockchain) for immutable record-keeping and enhanced security. This moves away from reliance on a single point of trust for file integrity verification.

**Specifications:**

**1. Manifest Generation & Anchoring:**

*   **Modified Manifest Format:** The existing manifest file (including file hash & HMAC) will be augmented with a timestamp and a unique identifier.
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Upon manifest generation, the manifest’s unique identifier *and* its HMAC will be submitted to a permissioned blockchain network.  (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric). The blockchain transaction will store these two values as immutable data.
*   **Manifest Delivery:** The full manifest file (including the original hash, HMAC, timestamp, & blockchain transaction ID) is transmitted alongside the file to the secure network.

**2. Secure Network Validation Process:**

*   **Blockchain Query:** Upon receiving the file & manifest, the secure network system first queries the blockchain using the manifest’s transaction ID.
*   **HMAC Verification:** The system retrieves the HMAC value from the blockchain transaction and compares it with the HMAC value within the received manifest. Any mismatch indicates tampering.
*   **File Hash Verification:**  The system calculates the hash of the received file and compares it with the hash stored within the manifest.
*   **Timestamp Verification:** Verify the manifest timestamp is within an acceptable window, to reject potentially stale manifests.
*   **Combined Verification:** *Only* if all three checks (HMAC, File Hash, Timestamp) pass is the file considered valid.

**3.  "Reverse Chimera" – Unsecure Network Confirmation:**

*   Upon successful validation in the secure network, a minimal confirmation message (containing only a unique transfer ID and a success/failure flag) is sent *back* to the unsecure network via a separate, dedicated communication channel (separate from the file transfer).
*   This confirmation allows the unsecure network to verify the successful delivery and validation of the file.

**Pseudocode (Secure Network Validation):**

```
FUNCTION ValidateFile(manifestFile, file):
  blockchainTxID = manifestFile.getTransactionID()
  blockchainHMAC = QueryBlockchain(blockchainTxID).getHMAC()
  manifestHMAC = manifestFile.getHMAC()

  IF blockchainHMAC != manifestHMAC:
    RETURN FALSE // Tampering detected

  calculatedFileHash = HashFile(file)
  manifestFileHash = manifestFile.getFileHash()

  IF calculatedFileHash != manifestFileHash:
    RETURN FALSE // File corruption

  manifestTimestamp = manifestFile.getTimestamp()
  currentTime = GetCurrentTime()

  IF Abs(currentTime - manifestTimestamp) > AcceptableTimestampWindow:
    RETURN FALSE // Stale Manifest

  RETURN TRUE // File Valid
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The blockchain network must be designed for high throughput and low latency.
*   Caching mechanisms should be implemented to reduce the number of blockchain queries.
*   Consider using a sidechain or layer-2 solution to offload blockchain transactions.

**Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security and data integrity.
*   Immutable audit trail.
*   Reduced reliance on a single point of trust.
*   Improved transparency and accountability.
