## Personalized Linguistic Drift - System Specification

**Core Concept:** Extend the personalized word substitution to encompass broader linguistic features – not just individual words, but phrasing, sentence structure, and even emotional tone – allowing the system to *drift* its language output over time to more closely mirror a user's evolving communication style.

**System Components:**

*   **Linguistic Feature Extractor (LFE):** Analyzes user input text (and potentially voice) to identify a range of linguistic features. These features extend beyond simple word counts to include:
    *   **N-gram Frequency:** Common word sequences (bigrams, trigrams).
    *   **Syntactic Complexity:** Sentence length, use of passive voice, clause structure.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral, and intensity).
    *   **Lexical Diversity:** Richness of vocabulary.
    *   **Topic Modeling:** Recurring themes in user communication.
*   **User Linguistic Profile (ULP):** A dynamic data structure storing the user's evolving linguistic fingerprint. This isn’t just averages, but probabilistic distributions representing the *range* of features the user employs. Weighted averages of feature frequency, sentence length distributions, sentiment score ranges, etc.
*   **System Output Modulator (SOM):** Intercepts system-generated output *before* presentation to the user.
*   **Drift Controller (DC):**  Adjusts the SOM's behavior over time, steering the system's output toward the ULP.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitors user responses (text, voice, interaction time, explicit feedback) to refine the ULP and DC parameters.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Profiling:** During initial user interaction, the LFE analyzes user input to build a baseline ULP.
2.  **Output Interception:** Before presenting output, the SOM analyzes the planned response.
3.  **Drift Calculation:** The DC compares the SOM-analyzed output with the corresponding features in the ULP. It calculates a “drift vector” representing the difference.
4.  **Output Modification:** The SOM applies transformations to the output based on the drift vector. This can involve:
    *   **Lexical Substitution:** Replacing words with synonyms that better match the user's vocabulary.
    *   **Syntactic Restructuring:** Re-phrasing sentences to align with the user's preferred sentence structure.
    *   **Sentiment Adjustment:**  Subtly adjusting the emotional tone of the output.
    *   **Phrase Insertion/Deletion:** Inserting or deleting common phrases from the user's communication.
5.  **Feedback & Adaptation:** The system monitors user responses to assess the effectiveness of the drift.  Positive responses strengthen the adaptations; negative responses (e.g., user edits, clarification requests) trigger adjustments to the ULP and DC.

**Pseudocode (Drift Controller):**

```pseudocode
function calculate_drift(system_output, user_profile):
  drift_vector = {}

  // Lexical Drift
  drift_vector["lexical_similarity"] = cosine_similarity(system_output_word_embeddings, user_profile_word_embeddings)
  drift_vector["lexical_drift"] = 1 - drift_vector["lexical_similarity"]

  // Syntactic Drift
  drift_vector["sentence_length_difference"] = average(system_output_sentence_lengths) - average(user_profile_sentence_lengths)

  // Sentiment Drift
  drift_vector["sentiment_difference"] = system_output_sentiment_score - user_profile_sentiment_score

  return drift_vector

function apply_drift(system_output, drift_vector, drift_rate):
  // Adjust word embeddings towards user's preferred vocabulary
  system_output_word_embeddings = system_output_word_embeddings + (drift_rate * (user_profile_word_embeddings - system_output_word_embeddings))

  // Adjust sentence length
  system_output_sentences = adjust_sentence_length(system_output_sentences, drift_vector["sentence_length_difference"])

  // Adjust sentiment
  system_output_sentiment_score = system_output_sentiment_score + (drift_rate * (user_profile_sentiment_score - system_output_sentiment_score))

  return system_output
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources for LFE, ULP storage, and SOM operation.  GPU acceleration would be beneficial.
*   Large storage capacity for ULP data.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-User Modeling:**  Learn from the communication patterns of multiple users to create a collective linguistic model.
*   **Cross-Lingual Drift:**  Adapt the system's language output to match the user's preferred style *across* different languages.
*   **Personality Simulation:**  Allow users to select a desired personality profile for the system, which would influence the linguistic drift.
