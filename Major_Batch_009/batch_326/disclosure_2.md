## Distributed Attentional Memory Fabric

**Concept:** Expand the multi-die approach beyond simple weight distribution and processing division. Create a fabric where *all* activations and intermediate results are distributed across dies, with an attention mechanism governing data access and computation locality. This shifts from a 'data parallel' approach to a 'spatially aware' computation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Die Architecture:** Each die contains a relatively small array of processing engines (PEs) – approximately 1024 PEs per die. Each PE includes a multiplier-accumulator, a small register file, and local SRAM. Significantly, each PE also contains a *routing table* and a hardware attention module.
*   **Inter-Die Fabric:** A high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect (e.g., silicon photonics or advanced chiplets) connects the dies. This interconnect isn't just for weight transfer; it's a full data fabric.
*   **Memory Distribution:**  The full weight matrix *and* all activations, including intermediate results, are partitioned and distributed across the die's local SRAM. The partitioning strategy is dynamic, based on attention weights.
*   **Attention Mechanism:**  A global attention module (distributed across the dies) assigns attention weights to each data element (weights, activations, intermediate results) *based on the current computational stage*.  These weights dictate:
    *   **Data Locality:**  Elements with high attention weights are replicated (or prefetched) to dies with available PEs.
    *   **Routing:**  Data transfer requests are routed through the fabric based on attention weights, prioritizing data access for PEs that ‘need’ it most.
    *   **Computational Priority:** PEs prioritize computations on data elements with high attention weights.
*   **Computational Flow:**
    1.  Input data is received and initially distributed across dies.
    2.  The global attention module computes attention weights for all data elements.
    3.  Data elements are replicated or transferred based on attention weights.
    4.  PEs compute weighted sums using local data and data received from other dies.
    5.  Intermediate results are distributed based on attention weights.
    6.  Steps 4 and 5 are repeated for each layer of the neural network.
*   **Pseudocode (Data Transfer):**

```
// For each data element 'x' in layer 'l'
attention_weight = global_attention_module(x, layer_l)

if (attention_weight > threshold) {
  // Replicate or transfer 'x' to a die with available PEs
  dest_die = find_available_die()
  transfer_data(x, dest_die)
}
```

*   **Synchronization:**  A lightweight synchronization protocol ensures data consistency and prevents race conditions during data transfer and computation. This might utilize a token-passing scheme or a distributed consensus algorithm.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to be highly scalable. Adding more dies increases computational capacity and memory bandwidth. The attention mechanism dynamically adjusts data distribution to maximize resource utilization.
*   **Hardware Attention Module (Per PE):**  A small, dedicated hardware module performs the attention weight lookup and routing table updates. This offloads the attention computation from the main PEs, improving performance. This unit would contain a CAM to map from data location to destination die.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Performance:**  Data locality and parallel computation reduce latency and improve throughput.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** The distributed architecture enables the creation of massively parallel neural networks.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Redundancy and data replication provide fault tolerance.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:**  The attention mechanism allows the system to adapt to changing workloads and data patterns.
