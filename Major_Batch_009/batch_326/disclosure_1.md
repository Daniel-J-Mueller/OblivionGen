**Dynamic Waitlist ‘Swapping’ & Skill-Based Service Matching**

**Concept:** Extend the waiting list system to allow users to *swap* positions within waitlists, or even *between* different merchants offering similar services, based on skillsets or immediate needs. This creates a more fluid and efficient allocation of resources, and prioritizes users with urgent or specialized requirements.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Data Structures:**

*   `UserSkillset`:  (UserID, SkillID, ProficiencyLevel).  Each user has a list of skills and their self-assessed proficiency (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert).
*   `ServiceSkillRequirements`: (ServiceID, SkillID, RequiredProficiency). Each service defines the skills needed and the minimum proficiency level required.
*   `WaitlistEntry`: (UserID, MerchantID, ServiceID, Position, EstimatedWaitTime, Skillset). Standard waitlist entry augmented with user skillset information.
*   `SwapRequest`: (RequestID, UserID, OriginalWaitlistEntry, TargetWaitlistEntry, Reason).  Records a user's request to swap positions in a waitlist or between waitlists.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Skillset Profiler:** Collects and maintains user skillsets via a profile interface (e.g., questionnaires, linked professional profiles).
*   **Service Requirement Engine:**  Defines and maintains skill requirements for each service offered by merchants.
*   **Swap Request Manager:** Handles incoming swap requests, evaluates feasibility, and manages the swap process.
*   **Matching Algorithm:** Identifies potential swap matches based on skillset compatibility and service requirements.
*   **Notification Service:**  Informs users of swap request status, potential matches, and completed swaps.

**III. Workflow & Pseudocode:**

1.  **User initiates Swap Request:**

    ```pseudocode
    User selects a service they are waiting for (from their waitlist entries).
    User specifies the reason for the swap request (e.g., “I have urgent need,” “I have a relevant skill to offer,” “I can provide assistance”).
    User can optionally specify criteria for the desired swap (e.g., “swap with someone who has skill X,” “swap with someone further down the list”).
    System creates a SwapRequest record.
    ```

2.  **Matching Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    function findSwapMatches(SwapRequest request) {
        potentialMatches = []
        // Search within the same waitlist
        for each WaitlistEntry entry in request.WaitlistEntry.Merchant.Waitlist {
            if entry.UserID != request.UserID and entry.Position > request.Position {
                compatibilityScore = calculateCompatibility(request, entry)
                if compatibilityScore > threshold {
                    potentialMatches.add(entry)
                }
            }
        }
        // Search across waitlists (for similar services)
        for each Merchant otherMerchant in allMerchants {
            for each WaitlistEntry entry in otherMerchant.Waitlist {
                if entry.ServiceID == request.WaitlistEntry.ServiceID and entry.UserID != request.UserID {
                    compatibilityScore = calculateCompatibility(request, entry)
                    if compatibilityScore > threshold {
                        potentialMatches.add(entry)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return potentialMatches.sortBy(compatibilityScore)
    }

    function calculateCompatibility(SwapRequest request, WaitlistEntry entry) {
        // Score based on:
        // Skillset match between user and target user
        // Urgency of request (e.g., reason for swap)
        // Estimated wait time difference
        // Service requirements
        return score
    }
    ```

3.  **Swap Confirmation & Execution:**

    ```pseudocode
    if potentialMatches is not empty {
        present top matches to user.
        if user selects a match {
            present swap offer to target user.
            if target user accepts {
                update WaitlistEntry positions for both users.
                notify both users of successful swap.
            } else {
                present next best match to user.
            }
        } else {
            notify user that no suitable matches were found.
        }
    }
    ```

**IV.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **Reputation System:** Implement a reputation system based on successful swaps and user feedback to incentivize positive behavior.
*   **Priority Swaps:** Allow users with critical needs (e.g., medical emergencies) to initiate priority swaps with faster matching.
*   **Skill Verification:** Integrate with skill verification platforms to validate user-reported skills and improve matching accuracy.
*   **API Integration:**  Provide APIs for merchants to integrate the swap functionality into their existing waiting list management systems.
