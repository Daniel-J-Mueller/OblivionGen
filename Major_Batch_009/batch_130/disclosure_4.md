**Dynamic Supplemental Content 'Blending' Based on User Emotional State**

**Specification:**

1.  **System Components:**
    *   Search Results Server (SRS): Existing infrastructure.
    *   Supplemental Content Providers (SCP): Existing infrastructure.
    *   User Device (UD): Device initiating the search.
    *   Emotional Analysis Module (EAM): New module. Runs on UD or SRS (configurable).
    *   Blending Algorithm (BA): New module. Runs on SRS.

2.  **EAM Functionality:**
    *   Real-time analysis of user emotional state via:
        *   Webcam facial expression analysis.
        *   Keyboard/Touchscreen input pattern analysis (typing speed, pressure).
        *   Voice analysis (if audio input available).
        *   Data pulled from user's connected wearables (heart rate, skin conductance – *optional* - requires user permission).
    *   Output: Emotional state categorized into primary dimensions (e.g., valence – positive/negative, arousal – high/low, dominance – controlled/submissive).  Output is a vector of values representing these dimensions.

3.  **Blending Algorithm (BA) Functionality:**
    *   Input:
        *   Search Query.
        *   Relevance scores of Supplemental Content (from existing system).
        *   Emotional State Vector (from EAM).
        *   Compatibility Rules (from existing system).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Emotional Weighting:**  Each SCP’s relevance score is modified by a weight derived from the Emotional State Vector.
            *   *Example:* If user is detected as high-arousal and negative-valence (e.g., frustrated), SCPs offering problem-solving content, or even 'distraction' content (gaming, entertainment) receive *increased* weighting. Conversely, SCPs offering purely informational/dry content receive *decreased* weighting.
            *   Weights are determined by a predefined mapping table configurable per SCP and emotional dimension. This mapping should have a "neutral" default state.
        2.  **Compatibility Filtering:** Existing compatibility rules are *relaxed* or *strengthened* based on the Emotional State Vector.
            *   *Example:*  If user is detected as low-dominance (feeling helpless), compatibility rules requiring strict content separation are relaxed to allow a more 'integrated' experience – potentially presenting multiple offers, suggestions, etc., even if slightly conflicting, to stimulate decision-making.
        3.  **Dynamic Layout Adjustment:** The layout of supplemental content on the search results page is adjusted based on both emotional state and the weighted relevance scores. Content perceived as emotionally 'resonant' is given more visual prominence (larger tiles, animation, strategic placement).
    *   Output: Modified relevance scores and layout instructions for the search results page.

4.  **Pseudocode (BA):**

    ```pseudocode
    function BlendContent(SearchQuery, SCP_Relevance, EmotionalState, CompatibilityRules)
        // EmotionalState is a vector (valence, arousal, dominance)
        // SCP_Relevance is a list of tuples: (SCP_ID, RelevanceScore)

        for each (SCP_ID, RelevanceScore) in SCP_Relevance:
            EmotionalWeight = CalculateEmotionalWeight(SCP_ID, EmotionalState)
            ModifiedRelevance = RelevanceScore * EmotionalWeight

            //Check compatibility
            if IsCompatible(SCP_ID, other_rendered_SCPs, CompatibilityRules, EmotionalState):
                //Render content
                RenderContent(SCP_ID, ModifiedRelevance)
            else:
                //Skip rendering
                SkipContent(SCP_ID)

        return RenderedSearchResults
    ```

5.  **Configuration:**
    *   Admin interface to define Emotional Weight mappings for each SCP.
    *   Admin interface to configure how Compatibility Rules are modified based on Emotional State.
    *   Privacy controls to allow users to opt-out of Emotional Analysis.

6.  **Scalability:**
    *   EAM can be implemented as a microservice to handle processing load.
    *   Caching of Emotional Weights and Compatibility Rule modifications.
