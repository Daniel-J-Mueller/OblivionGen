## Dynamic PAN Mesh Network with Predictive Channel Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the existing PAN coordination to a fully meshed network capable of predictive channel hopping, dynamically adjusting based on anticipated interference *before* collisions occur. This moves beyond simply avoiding collisions to proactively optimizing channel usage.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Types:**
    *   **Coordinator Node:** (Similar to existing PAN nodes, but with enhanced processing). Maintains a global view of the mesh network. Estimates channel contention based on historical and real-time data.
    *   **Standard Node:** Regular PAN nodes with added signal strength reporting capabilities.

*   **Communication Protocol:** Builds upon IEEE 802.15.4, adding a mesh networking layer.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Channel Contention Map:** A multi-dimensional array representing the probability of channel contention at each timeslot. Dimensions: Channel ID, Timeslot, Node ID (as a reporting source).
    *   **Predictive Channel Schedule:**  A schedule generated by the Coordinator, allocating channels and timeslots based on the Channel Contention Map, minimizing predicted collisions.
    *   **Neighbor List:** Each node maintains a list of direct neighbors (nodes it can communicate with directly).

*   **Algorithm (Coordinator Node):**

    1.  **Data Collection:** Continuously receives signal strength reports and channel usage data from all nodes in the mesh.
    2.  **Contention Map Update:**  Based on received data, update the Channel Contention Map.  Apply exponential smoothing to prioritize recent data, and weighting based on node proximity (closer nodes have more weight).
    3.  **Schedule Generation:**
        *   Using the Channel Contention Map, identify timeslots and channels with the lowest probability of contention.
        *   Allocate these channels and timeslots to nodes based on their communication needs (prioritized by QoS requirements).
        *   Implement a ‘lookahead’ mechanism to predict future contention based on historical usage patterns (e.g., predicting increased activity during certain times of day).
        *   Optimize for minimal interference *and* network throughput.
    4.  **Schedule Distribution:**  Distribute the Predictive Channel Schedule to all nodes in the mesh.
    5.  **Schedule Adjustment:** Continuously monitor network performance and adjust the schedule as needed.  Implement a feedback loop, where nodes report communication errors or congestion, triggering a re-evaluation of the schedule.

*   **Algorithm (Standard Node):**

    1.  **Reporting:** Periodically report signal strength and channel usage data to the Coordinator.
    2.  **Schedule Adherence:** Follow the Predictive Channel Schedule provided by the Coordinator.
    3.  **Error Reporting:** Report any communication errors or congestion to the Coordinator.
    4.  **Local Adaptation:** Implement a limited local adaptation mechanism. If a node consistently experiences communication errors on a scheduled channel, it can temporarily switch to an alternative channel and report the issue to the Coordinator.

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Nodes require increased processing power and memory to support the mesh networking protocol and predictive algorithms.
    *   Nodes need accurate time synchronization mechanisms (e.g., using IEEE 1588).
    *   Increased radio sensitivity for accurate signal strength reporting.

*   **Pseudocode (Coordinator Node - Schedule Generation):**

    ```
    FUNCTION GenerateSchedule()
    INPUT: ChannelContentionMap, NodeCommunicationNeeds
    OUTPUT: PredictiveChannelSchedule

    // 1. Identify Low-Contention Channels/Timeslots
    FOR EACH Timeslot IN AllTimeslots
        FOR EACH Channel IN AllChannels
            ContentionProbability = ChannelContentionMap[Channel][Timeslot]
            LOW_CONTENTION_SCORES.add((Channel, Timeslot, ContentionProbability))

    // Sort by Contention Probability (ascending)
    LOW_CONTENTION_SCORES.sort()

    // 2. Allocate Channels/Timeslots to Nodes based on Needs
    PredictiveChannelSchedule = {}
    FOR EACH Node IN AllNodes
        FOR EACH CommunicationRequest IN Node.CommunicationRequests
            //Find lowest contention channel/timeslot for the duration
            (Channel, Timeslot) = FindBestChannelTimeslot(LOW_CONTENTION_SCORES, CommunicationRequest.Duration)
            PredictiveChannelSchedule[Node][CommunicationRequest] = (Channel, Timeslot)
            //Remove allocated slot from LOW_CONTENTION_SCORES
            RemoveSlot(LOW_CONTENTION_SCORES, (Channel, Timeslot))

    RETURN PredictiveChannelSchedule
    ```

This system aims to move beyond reactive collision avoidance to proactive channel optimization, resulting in a more robust and efficient PAN mesh network.  The key is the Coordinator’s ability to predict and avoid contention *before* it occurs, rather than simply reacting to collisions as they happen.
