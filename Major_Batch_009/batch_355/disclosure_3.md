## Dynamic Schema Evolution with Probabilistic Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the schema-based partitioning to dynamically adjust partitioning strategies *during* data ingestion based on observed data distributions. Introduce probabilistic partitioning where data isn't strictly assigned to a partition but assigned a probability distribution across multiple partitions. This allows for handling schema evolution and unpredictable data patterns more gracefully than fixed, schema-driven partitioning.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Schema Monitoring Module:**

*   **Input:** Time-series data elements, potentially with varying schemas.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Derives schema as per the original patent.
    *   Continuously monitors schema changes within incoming data streams. Tracks frequency of new dimension/measure names.
    *   Calculates a "Schema Volatility Score" (SVS) for each dimension/measure. SVS represents the rate of schema change. Higher SVS indicates a more volatile schema.
    *   Calculates data distribution across existing dimension values.
*   **Output:** Derived schema, SVS per dimension/measure, Data distribution histograms.

**2. Probabilistic Partitioning Engine:**

*   **Input:** Derived schema, SVS, Data distribution histograms, Configuration parameters (number of partitions, volatility threshold, probability weighting factors).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Partition Assignment:**  Instead of a strict mapping, calculates a probability distribution across partitions for each data element. This distribution is based on:
        *   **Schema Mapping:** The original schema-based mapping provides a baseline probability.
        *   **Data Distribution:** Values within data distribution histograms influence probability.  Elements aligning with prevalent distributions get higher probability in associated partitions.
        *   **Volatility Score:** Higher SVS for a dimension/measure leads to a broader probability distribution across partitions, reducing strict assignment.
    *   **Partition Creation/Merging:** Dynamically adjusts the number of partitions:
        *   If SVS exceeds a threshold, the system initiates partition splitting/merging.
        *   Splitting creates new partitions based on prevalent dimension values.
        *   Merging combines low-usage partitions to optimize storage.
    *   **Probability Weighting:** Use configurable weights for schema mapping, data distribution, and volatility score.
*   **Output:** Probability distribution for each data element across partitions, Partition configuration (number of partitions, mapping), Partitioning adjustments.

**3. Storage & Query Engine:**

*   **Storage:** Data is stored with associated probability distribution for each partition.  Use a key-value store where:
    *   Key: Time-series identifier, timestamp.
    *   Value: Data value, Partition probabilities.
*   **Query Processing:**
    *   Query receives criteria (measure name, dimension values, time range).
    *   Query engine identifies relevant partitions based on probability distributions.
    *   Calculates a weighted sum of data from all relevant partitions, weighted by the probability of each partition.
    *   This weighted sum is the query result.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function processQuery(queryCriteria, timeRange):
  relevantPartitions = []
  for partition in allPartitions:
    if partition matches queryCriteria:
      relevantPartitions.append(partition)

  totalProbability = 0
  weightedSum = 0

  for partition in relevantPartitions:
    probability = getPartitionProbability(partition, queryCriteria)
    totalProbability += probability
    weightedSum += probability * getDataFromPartition(partition, timeRange)

  if totalProbability > 0:
    result = weightedSum / totalProbability
  else:
    result = null

  return result
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `Volatility Threshold`:  Triggers partition adjustments.
*   `Schema Weighting`: Weight for schema mapping in probability calculation.
*   `Distribution Weighting`: Weight for data distribution in probability calculation.
*   `Max Partitions`: Maximum number of partitions allowed.
*   `Min Partitions`: Minimum number of partitions allowed.

**Innovation:**

This approach shifts from static partitioning to a more fluid, adaptive system that handles schema evolution and unpredictable data patterns effectively. The probabilistic partitioning allows for more accurate query results by considering data from multiple partitions, weighted by their probability. This system addresses the limitations of fixed partitioning schemes in dynamic environments.
