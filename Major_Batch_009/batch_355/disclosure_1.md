## Dynamic Highlight "Ecosystem" & Collaborative Annotation

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual & popular highlights to create a dynamic, user-driven “highlight ecosystem” where highlights are not merely static selections, but become interconnected annotations contributing to a shared understanding of the content.

**Specifications:**

**1. Highlight "Lifespan" & Decay:**

*   **Parameter:**  `highlight_lifespan` (integer, default 72 hours). Defines how long a user-created highlight remains "active" in the ecosystem.
*   **Functionality:** After `highlight_lifespan`, the highlight transitions to a "dormant" state, visually dimmed, and contributing less to popularity algorithms.  Users can "revive" highlights (extending lifespan) or archive them.
*   **Rationale:** Encourages continuous refinement & discourages static, outdated highlights.

**2.  Highlight "Relationships" & Tagging:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Each highlight stores a list of ‘related highlights’ identified by other users.
*   **User Action:** Users can directly link highlights to each other, specifying the *type* of relationship (e.g., “supports”, “contradicts”, “expands on”, “provides context”).
*   **Visual Representation:**  Linked highlights display connection lines within the user interface (adjustable visibility).

**3.  "Highlight Streams" & User Filtering:**

*   **Streams:** Users can create and subscribe to curated “highlight streams” based on themes, topics, authors, or specific relationship types.
*   **Filtering:** Advanced filtering options to isolate highlights based on creator reputation, timestamp, relationship type, and keyword density.

**4.  AI-Driven "Insight Summarization":**

*   **Function:** Regularly analyze clusters of related highlights to automatically generate short, concise “insight summaries” representing the prevailing understanding of a particular passage.
*   **Output:** Display summaries alongside the content (user-toggleable).
*   **Algorithm:** Leverage NLP models to identify common themes, arguments, and conclusions within related highlight clusters.

**5.  "Reputation System" for Highlight Quality:**

*   **Metric:**  “Highlight Score” calculated based on:
    *   Number of "agrees" from other users.
    *   Number of "supports" from related highlights.
    *   Age of the highlight (decay over time).
    *   Creator's overall reputation score.
*   **Impact:** Higher-scoring highlights are prioritized in popularity algorithms and displayed more prominently.

**Pseudocode (Insight Summarization):**

```
function generateInsightSummary(highlightCluster):
  // Input: List of related highlights
  // Output: Short text summary

  combinedText = ""
  for each highlight in highlightCluster:
    combinedText += highlight.text + " "

  //Use NLP Model
  summary = NLP_Summarization(combinedText, max_length=100)

  return summary
```

**Interface elements:**

*   "Relate Highlight" button: Opens a panel to select existing highlights & define the relationship type.
*   "Stream Manager": Interface for creating & subscribing to highlight streams.
*   "Highlight Score" display: Visible near each highlight.
*   Filter Panel: For refining highlight views.
