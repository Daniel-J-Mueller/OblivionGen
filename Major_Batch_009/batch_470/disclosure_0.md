## Dynamic Range Mapping via Perceptual Hash Correlation

**Concept:** Leverage perceptual hashing to dynamically adjust quantization parameters *not* just across a frame, but *between* frames, optimizing for perceived visual change. The premise is to minimize the impact of quantization on noticeable differences between successive frames, improving perceived video quality, especially at low bitrates.

**Specs:**

1.  **Perceptual Hash Generation:**
    *   Algorithm: Utilize a robust perceptual hashing algorithm (e.g., pHash, dHash, aHash, or a learned perceptual image patch similarity - LPIPS) to generate a hash for each frame. This hash should capture the salient visual features of the frame. The chosen algorithm should prioritize robustness to minor distortions (compression artifacts) while remaining sensitive to meaningful content changes.
    *   Hash Size: Generate a hash of moderate size (e.g., 64-128 bits). This represents a trade-off between precision and computational cost.
    *   Frequency: Calculate a hash for every keyframe, or potentially every frame depending on motion complexity.

2.  **Inter-Frame Difference Calculation:**
    *   Calculate the Hamming distance (or a similar distance metric) between the perceptual hash of the current frame and the perceptual hash of the previous frame.  This provides a measure of how *different* the current frame is perceived to be from the previous frame.

3.  **Quantization Parameter Adjustment:**
    *   Establish a baseline quantization parameter range for the video stream.
    *   Define a mapping function that relates the inter-frame perceptual hash distance to a quantization parameter adjustment. 
        *   *Low Distance (frames are very similar):*  Aggressively increase the quantization parameter (more compression).
        *   *High Distance (frames are very different):* Decrease the quantization parameter (less compression).
    *   The mapping function could be linear, logarithmic, or a learned function (e.g., a small neural network).  The goal is to prioritize preservation of detail in frames that are perceptually distinct.
    *   Limit the adjustment to a defined range to avoid excessive fluctuations and maintain overall bitrate control.

4.  **Integration with Encoding Pipeline:**
    *   The quantization parameter adjustment is applied *before* the quantization stage of the video encoding process.
    *   The system determines quantization parameters for each CU as in the provided patent, but then modifies these based on the inter-frame hash distance. For example, the system could scale the determined quantization parameters by a factor derived from the inter-frame distance.
    *   Implement a bitrate control mechanism that monitors the overall bitrate and adjusts the quantization parameter range dynamically to maintain the target bitrate.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each frame:
1. Calculate Perceptual Hash (frame_hash)
2. Calculate Hamming Distance (hash_distance) between frame_hash and previous_frame_hash
3. Determine Quantization Parameter Adjustment:
   adjustment = mapping_function(hash_distance)
4. Determine Baseline Quantization Parameter (QP) for each CU
5. Adjusted QP = QP * (1 + adjustment)  // Scale QP based on adjustment
6. Apply Adjusted QP to CU's residual coefficients during quantization
7. Encode the frame
8. Update previous_frame_hash with current_frame_hash
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Motion Vector Integration:** Incorporate motion vector magnitude into the quantization parameter adjustment. High motion regions require more bits to encode accurately.
*   **Scene Change Detection:**  Combine perceptual hashing with traditional scene change detection techniques to ensure appropriate quantization levels at scene transitions.
*   **Learned Mapping Function:** Train a neural network to learn the optimal mapping between inter-frame perceptual hash distance and quantization parameter adjustment, based on subjective visual quality metrics.
*   **Adaptive Hash Size:** Dynamically adjust the size of the perceptual hash based on the complexity of the scene.
