## Dynamic Hardware Fingerprinting via Chaotic Circuit Analysis

**Concept:** Extend hardware fingerprinting beyond static measurements by analyzing the *dynamic* characteristics of intentionally introduced chaotic circuits within a device. This creates a highly sensitive, virtually unique "noise profile" resistant to cloning or tampering.

**Specs:**

*   **Chaotic Core:** Integrate a small, low-power chaotic circuit (e.g., a Chua's circuit variant, or a digitally implemented chaotic map) onto the main system board. This circuit is *not* essential for core functionality, serving solely as a fingerprint source.
*   **Excitation Signal:** A pseudo-random, low-amplitude excitation signal (generated by a dedicated microcontroller) is applied to the chaotic core. The frequency and pattern of this excitation change periodically (daily/weekly) – determined by a secure, internal clock.
*   **Measurement System:** A high-resolution Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) continuously monitors the output of the chaotic core.  Measurements are captured at a rate of at least 1 MHz.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Apply time-domain and frequency-domain analysis to the ADC data to extract key features:
    *   Lyapunov exponents (estimate the rate of divergence of trajectories – sensitive to even minor changes)
    *   Correlation dimension (estimate the fractal dimension of the attractor – characterizes the complexity of the chaotic system)
    *   Bispectral analysis (detect nonlinear interactions – sensitive to subtle circuit imperfections)
*   **Fingerprint Generation:** Combine the extracted features into a high-dimensional vector representing the device's unique fingerprint. Apply a secure hashing algorithm to create a compact fingerprint ID.
*   **Verification Process:**
    1.  Verification device applies the same excitation signal to the target device.
    2.  ADC data is captured and features are extracted.
    3.  Fingerprint is generated and compared to a stored reference fingerprint.
    4.  Matching requires a similarity score above a predefined threshold (adjusted to balance security and false positive rate).
*   **Tamper Detection:** Significant deviation from the reference fingerprint indicates tampering. The system can trigger security measures (e.g., data wipe, system lockdown).

**Pseudocode (Verification):**

```
// Reference Fingerprint (stored securely)
reference_features = [lyapunov_exponent, correlation_dimension, bispectrum_data]

// Target Device Measurement
excitation_signal = generate_excitation_signal()
adc_data = capture_adc_data(excitation_signal)
target_features = extract_features(adc_data)

// Similarity Calculation
similarity_score = calculate_similarity(reference_features, target_features) // (e.g., Euclidean distance, cosine similarity)

// Thresholding
if similarity_score > threshold:
  verification_status = SUCCESS
else:
  verification_status = FAILURE
  tamper_detected = TRUE
```

**Novelty:** Existing hardware fingerprinting relies on static attributes or pre-defined test patterns. This approach leverages the inherent sensitivity of chaotic systems to create a dynamically evolving, highly unique fingerprint that is difficult to predict or replicate.  The changing excitation signal adds an additional layer of security.
