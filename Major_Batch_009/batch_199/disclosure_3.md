## Adaptive Parity Placement with Dynamic Granularity

**Concept:** This system expands upon the idea of using a secondary memory for parity data, but introduces dynamic parity granularity and adaptive placement based on data access patterns and predicted error rates. Instead of fixed-width parity words, this system creates and manages variable-length parity segments, strategically placed within the faster secondary memory to minimize recovery latency.

**Specs:**

*   **Memory Hierarchy:**
    *   Primary Memory: Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (e.g., ReRAM, MRAM) - High density, lower cost, potential for higher error rates.
    *   Secondary Memory: Fast Volatile Memory (e.g., DRAM, SRAM) – Lower density, higher cost, low latency.

*   **Data Segmentation:** Primary memory data is divided into variable-sized segments. Segment size is initially determined by a base value but can dynamically adapt (see Algorithm).

*   **Parity Generation:**
    *   Parity is calculated *per segment*.
    *   Parity calculation uses a chosen algorithm (e.g., Hamming, Reed-Solomon, simple XOR).
    *   Algorithm supports incremental updates – critical for write operations.

*   **Parity Placement Strategy:**
    *   **Hot/Cold Tracking:** The system monitors read/write access frequency for each segment.
    *   **Placement Zones:** Secondary memory is logically divided into “placement zones” based on latency.
    *   **Dynamic Assignment:** Frequently accessed (hot) segments’ parity is assigned to placement zones with the lowest latency. Infrequently accessed (cold) segments’ parity is assigned to zones with higher latency, freeing up faster zones.

*   **Error Prediction:**
    *   **Historical Error Tracking:** The system tracks error rates for each memory location in the primary memory.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** A lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a simple moving average, exponential smoothing) predicts future error probability for each segment based on historical data.
    *   **Adaptive Granularity:** Segments with higher predicted error rates have their granularity reduced (split into smaller segments) to improve error isolation and recovery precision.

*   **Write Operation Pseudocode:**

```
function writeData(data, segmentAddress):
    // Read existing data and parity
    existingData = readData(segmentAddress)
    existingParity = readParity(segmentAddress)

    // Calculate new parity based on XOR of existing parity, old data, and new data
    newParity = existingParity XOR oldData XOR newData

    // Write new data and parity
    writeData(newData, segmentAddress)
    writeParity(newParity, segmentAddress)
```

*   **Recovery Process Pseudocode:**

```
function recoverSegment(segmentAddress):
    // Detect uncorrectable error using ECC
    if (detectUncorrectableError(segmentAddress)):
        // Read parity data
        parityData = readParity(segmentAddress)

        // Read data from other memory channels (as in the original patent)
        otherData = readOtherData(segmentAddress)

        // Calculate parity check bits
        calculatedParity = calculateParity(otherData)

        // Compare calculated parity with stored parity
        parityDifference = calculatedParity XOR parityData

        // Identify erroneous bits based on parity difference
        erroneousBits = identifyErroneousBits(parityDifference)

        // Invert erroneous bits in the original data
        recoveredData = invertBits(originalData, erroneousBits)

        return recoveredData
    else:
        return originalData
```

*   **Algorithm – Dynamic Segment Size Adjustment:**

```
function adjustSegmentSize(segment, predictedErrorRate):
    if predictedErrorRate > thresholdHigh:
        splitSegment(segment) //Reduce segment size
    else if predictedErrorRate < thresholdLow:
        mergeSegment(segment) //Increase segment size
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:**
    *   Dedicated hardware for parity calculation and comparison.
    *   Fast inter-memory communication bus.
    *   Address mapping table for parity placement.

*   **Software Considerations:**
    *   Memory management system integration.
    *   Real-time monitoring and adjustment of segment sizes.
    *   Error prediction model training and updates.
