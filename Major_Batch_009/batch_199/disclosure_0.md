## Adaptive Notification Prioritization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, EEG) into the notification lock mode system to dynamically adjust notification delivery based on user stress/cognitive load. Instead of a simple on/off switch for applications, notifications are *graded* and delivered based on real-time biometric data.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Device incorporates or connects to biofeedback sensors (wristband, headphones, etc.). Data stream feeds into the OS notification manager.
*   **Baseline Calibration:** System establishes a user-specific baseline for biometric data during periods of low cognitive load (e.g., during initial setup, or via a dedicated "calibration" mode).
*   **Real-time Analysis:** OS continuously monitors biometric data. Deviations from baseline indicate increased stress or cognitive load.
*   **Notification Grading:** Each application’s notifications are assigned a "priority score" (configurable by the user, with defaults based on app category – e.g., emergency contacts are always high priority).
*   **Dynamic Filtering:**
    *   **Low Stress:** All notifications (meeting priority thresholds) are delivered as usual.
    *   **Moderate Stress:** Lower priority notifications are delayed or summarized. Visual/auditory cues are minimized (e.g., grayscale icons, muted sounds).
    *   **High Stress:** Only *critical* notifications (high priority, potentially flagged by the user) are delivered immediately. Other notifications are queued for later delivery, or presented as a consolidated summary.
*   **Lock Mode Override:** The user can temporarily override the dynamic filtering (e.g., to ensure delivery of an important message despite high stress).
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns from user behavior (overrides, dismissals) to refine the dynamic filtering rules and priority scores.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Structures
struct Notification {
  string appName;
  string message;
  int priority; // 1-5 (1=Critical, 5=Low)
};

// Functions
function analyzeBiometricData():
  // Read data from biofeedback sensors
  // Calculate stress/cognitive load level (0-100)
  return stressLevel;

function filterNotifications(notificationList):
  stressLevel = analyzeBiometricData();

  filteredList = []
  for each notification in notificationList:
    if stressLevel <= 30:
      filteredList.append(notification) // Deliver all
    else if stressLevel > 30 and stressLevel <= 70:
      if notification.priority <= 2:
        filteredList.append(notification) // Deliver high/medium priority
      else:
        //Queue for later delivery or summarize
    else: //stress level > 70
      if notification.priority == 1:
        filteredList.append(notification) // Deliver critical only
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Compatible biofeedback sensors (Bluetooth or wired).
*   Sufficient processing power to analyze biometric data in real-time.
*   Secure storage for user biometric data and preferences.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Reducing distractions during critical tasks.
*   Managing stress levels in high-pressure situations.
*   Improving focus and productivity.
*   Providing personalized notification experiences.
