## Adaptive Accelerator Mesh with Dynamic Interconnect Fabrics

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Move beyond fixed accelerator assignments and static interconnects. Implement a reconfigurable mesh of accelerators with a programmable interconnect fabric allowing dynamic dataflow optimization *during* inference.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   **Accelerator Tiles:** Small, modular processing units (e.g., systolic arrays, specialized cores). Each tile possesses local memory and a standardized interface.
*   **Interconnect Fabric:**  A network-on-chip (NoC) capable of dynamically establishing connections between any two accelerator tiles. This NoC utilizes configurable logic blocks (CLBs) – think FPGA-like functionality – to route data.
*   **Global Scheduler:** A dedicated processor responsible for monitoring inference progress, calculating optimal dataflows, and configuring the interconnect fabric.
*   **Profiling Units:** Integrated into each accelerator tile and the interconnect fabric to gather real-time performance data (latency, bandwidth, utilization).

**III. Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Initial Graph Mapping:**  The neural network is initially partitioned (potentially using a technique similar to the provided patent, but as a starting point, *not* a constraint).  A coarse-grained mapping of operations to accelerator tiles is performed.
2.  **Runtime Profiling:** During inference, the profiling units collect data on the execution of each operation and the transfer of feature maps.
3.  **Dynamic Re-mapping:** The global scheduler analyzes the profiling data and dynamically re-maps operations and re-configures the interconnect fabric to optimize dataflow.  
    *   **Dataflow Optimization:** The algorithm prioritizes minimizing data transfer latency and maximizing accelerator utilization.  It might shift operations between tiles to reduce communication distances or balance workloads.
    *   **Granularity of Re-mapping:**  Re-mapping can occur at different granularities – individual operations, layers, or subgraphs.
    *   **Cost Model:**  A cost model is used to evaluate the benefits of re-mapping versus the overhead (reconfiguration time, potential data copying).
4.  **Adaptive Interconnect Configuration:**  The global scheduler programs the interconnect fabric to establish the optimized data paths.

**IV. Pseudocode (Global Scheduler):**

```pseudocode
// Input: Neural Network Graph, Initial Mapping
// Output: Optimized Inference Execution

function optimize_inference(graph, initial_mapping):

    current_mapping = initial_mapping
    profiling_data = []

    while inference_not_complete():

        // 1. Collect Profiling Data
        profiling_data = collect_data(current_mapping)

        // 2. Identify Bottlenecks
        bottlenecks = analyze_data(profiling_data)

        // 3. Generate Candidate Re-mappings
        candidate_mappings = generate_candidates(current_mapping, bottlenecks)

        // 4. Evaluate Candidate Mappings (using Cost Model)
        best_mapping = evaluate_mappings(candidate_mappings)

        // 5. If best_mapping is significantly better than current_mapping:
        if cost(best_mapping) < cost(current_mapping) * (1 - threshold): //Threshold to avoid unnecessary remapping

            // 6. Reconfigure Interconnect Fabric
            reconfigure_fabric(best_mapping)

            // 7. Update current_mapping
            current_mapping = best_mapping

        // 8. Execute next operation(s)
        execute_operations(current_mapping)
```

**V. Innovation:**

This system goes beyond static partitioning and fixed interconnects. By combining runtime profiling with dynamic re-mapping and a programmable interconnect fabric, it achieves a level of adaptability that optimizes performance for varying network architectures and input data characteristics.  The programmable interconnect is a key enabler, allowing the system to respond to dynamic workload changes without being constrained by a fixed hardware topology.
