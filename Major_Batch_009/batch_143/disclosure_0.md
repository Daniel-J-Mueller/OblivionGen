## Dynamic Intent Stacking & Predictive Directive Generation

**Concept:** Extend the system to not just prioritize directives based on content type/frequency, but to *stack* intents from continuous audio input and predictively generate directives *before* the user fully articulates a command.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Architecture:**

*   **Intent Stack:** Maintain a stack data structure to hold a rolling window of inferred user intents. Each intent is timestamped and associated with a confidence score.  The stack size is configurable (default: 3-5).
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Utilize a weighted scoring system combining:
    *   **ASR Confidence:** Confidence level from Automatic Speech Recognition (higher = better).
    *   **Contextual Relevance:** Score based on the current application/screen content.
    *   **Temporal Decay:** Intents decay in score over time, prioritizing recent commands.
*   **Directive Prediction Engine:** This module analyzes the Intent Stack and predicts likely subsequent directives.  Uses a probabilistic model (e.g., Markov Chain, LSTM) trained on user interaction data.

**2. Data Flow:**

1.  **Continuous Audio Input:** Capture ongoing audio stream.
2.  **ASR Processing:** Transcribe audio into text and generate ASR confidence score.
3.  **Intent Inference:** Determine the user's intent from the transcribed text.  Update Intent Stack.
4.  **Directive Prediction:** Predictive Engine analyzes Intent Stack, predicts likely next directive.
5.  **Preemptive Directive Presentation:** (Optional) – Display a small, unobtrusive prompt to the user suggesting the predicted action (e.g., "Do you want to share this?"). This allows for immediate confirmation or correction.
6.  **Directive Execution:**  Once confirmed (by voice or touch), the directive is sent to the device.
7.  **Learning Loop:**  Track user responses to predicted directives (confirmation/correction) to refine the predictive model.

**3. Pseudocode (Directive Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_next_directive(intent_stack):
  // 1. Extract relevant features from intent_stack
  features = extract_features(intent_stack) // e.g., last N intents, intent frequencies, time deltas

  // 2. Apply trained probabilistic model
  predicted_probabilities = model.predict(features) // output: array of directive probabilities

  // 3. Select top N directives with highest probability
  top_directives = sort_directives(predicted_probabilities) // descending order by probability

  // 4. Return the most likely directive
  return top_directives[0]
```

**4.  Priority Adjustment & Contextual Overrides:**

*   **Dynamic Priority Weights:**  Adjust the weights used for content type/frequency/rendering size based on user behavior.  If the user frequently overrides a particular directive type, lower its priority.
*   **Application-Specific Context:**  Allow applications to define custom contextual overrides for directive prioritization.  For example, a video player might always prioritize “play/pause” directives.

**5. Example Scenario:**

User: “Okay Google, find a coffee shop… and now show me the directions…”

1.  “Find a coffee shop” added to Intent Stack (high confidence).
2.  “Show me the directions” added to Intent Stack (high confidence).
3.  Predictive Engine analyzes Intent Stack and predicts “Navigate” (high probability).
4.  System displays unobtrusive prompt: “Navigate to [Coffee Shop Name]?”
5.  User says “Yes.” Directive is executed.
