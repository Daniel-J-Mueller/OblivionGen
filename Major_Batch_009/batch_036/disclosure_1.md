## Dynamic Preview Personalization via Affective Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend automated preview generation beyond content analysis to incorporate *real-time* viewer affective state, dynamically tailoring the preview to maximize engagement *during* preview consumption.

**Specifications:**

**1. Affective Sensor Integration:**

*   **Input:** Integrate with commercially available (or custom) bio-sensors capturing:
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) – for broad emotional state & attention.
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) – for arousal/excitement levels.
    *   Facial Expression Analysis (via webcam) – for nuanced emotion detection.
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – for stress/relaxation indicators.
*   **Data Pipeline:** Real-time data stream from sensors to a processing unit.
*   **Preprocessing:** Noise filtering, artifact removal, signal amplification.

**2. Real-Time Affective State Estimation:**

*   **Model:** Multi-modal machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, transformer) trained to map sensor data to a dimensional affective space (Valence, Arousal, Dominance – VAD model).
*   **Calibration:** Individual viewer calibration phase to account for baseline variations in sensor readings and personal emotional expression.
*   **Output:** Continuous estimation of viewer's affective state (VAD scores) during preview playback.

**3. Dynamic Preview Adaptation:**

*   **Segment Library:** Maintain a database of video segments (beyond those used for initial preview generation) categorized by:
    *   Emotional content (using the same emotion recognition models as the initial preview system).
    *   Pacing (fast, slow, moderate).
    *   Visual complexity.
    *   Audio characteristics.
*   **Adaptation Algorithm:**
    *   Monitor viewer’s affective state in real-time.
    *   If *boredom* is detected (low arousal, negative valence):
        *   Select segments with higher arousal and/or positive valence.
        *   Increase pacing.
        *   Introduce visual or audio complexity.
    *   If *anxiety/overstimulation* is detected (high arousal, negative valence):
        *   Select segments with lower arousal and/or positive valence.
        *   Decrease pacing.
        *   Reduce visual or audio complexity.
    *   If *engagement* is high (positive valence, moderate arousal): Maintain current segment selection.
    *   Segment transition logic to minimize jarring cuts. Blend transitions where possible.
*   **Preview Re-Rendering:** Dynamically re-render the preview based on the chosen segments. Low latency is critical.

**4. User Profile Integration:**

*   Store user-specific affective baselines and preferences.
*   Personalize the adaptation algorithm based on historical data.
*   Consider demographic factors and viewing history.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
load_user_profile(user_id)
initialize_sensors()
load_segment_library()

// Main Loop
while (preview_playing) {
    sensor_data = read_sensors()
    affective_state = estimate_affective_state(sensor_data)

    if (affective_state.arousal < boredom_threshold && affective_state.valence < boredom_threshold) {
        next_segment = select_segment(segment_library, "high_arousal_positive_valence")
    } else if (affective_state.arousal > anxiety_threshold && affective_state.valence < anxiety_threshold) {
        next_segment = select_segment(segment_library, "low_arousal_positive_valence")
    } else {
        next_segment = current_segment // Maintain current segment
    }

    render_preview(next_segment)
    update_current_segment(next_segment)
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing platform for real-time processing.
*   Bio-sensor interface hardware.
*   Low-latency display system.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Predictive modeling to anticipate viewer affective states.
*   Integration with voice assistants for personalized recommendations.
*   A/B testing of different adaptation algorithms.
*   Privacy-preserving data collection and analysis.
