## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Filtering

**Concept:** Extend the preference filtering beyond explicit user choices (genres, keywords) to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of both content *and* the user, dynamically adjusting the content stream to maximize positive emotional engagement.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Components:**

*   **Content Emotional Analyzer (CEA):** A module leveraging multimodal AI (video/audio analysis, natural language processing) to extract an "Emotional Profile" for each content item. This profile consists of:
    *   Dominant Emotion(s): (e.g., Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Excitement) - expressed as a probability distribution.
    *   Emotional Arc: A time-series representation of emotional intensity throughout the content.
    *   Emotional Complexity: A metric indicating the diversity and subtlety of emotional expression.
*   **User Emotional State Detector (UESD):** Utilizing wearable sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial expression analysis via device camera) and/or passively collected data (typing speed/pattern, interaction with interface - dwell time, scrolling speed) to generate a real-time "User Emotional Profile." Similar structure to CEA output, but representing the user’s current emotional state.
*   **Emotional Resonance Engine (ERE):** The core logic. Compares the CEA output (content emotional profile) with the UESD output (user emotional profile). ERE dynamically adjusts content filtering and prioritization based on resonance.
*   **Dynamic Weighting System (DWS):** Allows for user control over the sensitivity of emotional filtering. Users can specify:
    *   Desired Emotional Range: (e.g., "Mostly Positive," "Avoid Negative," "Neutral Preferred").
    *   Emotional Intensity Threshold: (e.g., "Mild," "Moderate," "Strong").
    *   Resonance Sensitivity:  A slider controlling how strongly the system prioritizes emotionally resonant content.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Tracks user interaction (watch time, skips, likes/dislikes) to refine the UESD and ERE models over time.

**II. Algorithm (Pseudocode - ERE):**

```
function select_content(content_pool, user_emotional_profile, weighting_system):
  filtered_content = []
  for content in content_pool:
    content_emotional_profile = CEA(content)
    resonance_score = calculate_resonance(user_emotional_profile, content_emotional_profile, weighting_system)
    if resonance_score > resonance_threshold:
      filtered_content.append((content, resonance_score))

  # Sort filtered content by resonance score (descending)
  sorted_content = sort_by_resonance(filtered_content)

  # Apply DWS-defined weighting and prioritization
  final_content = apply_weighting(sorted_content, weighting_system)

  return final_content

function calculate_resonance(user_profile, content_profile, weighting_system):
  # Calculate similarity between emotion distributions (e.g., using cosine similarity)
  emotion_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_profile.emotion_distribution, content_profile.emotion_distribution)

  #Consider Emotional Arc.  Does the content arc *complement* the user arc? (Correlation)
  arc_correlation = correlate_arcs(user_profile.emotional_arc, content_profile.emotional_arc)

  #Combine metrics, weighted by DWS settings
  resonance_score = (emotion_similarity * DWS.emotion_weight) + (arc_correlation * DWS.arc_weight)

  return resonance_score
```

**III.  Content Prioritization Logic:**

*   **Complementary Emotion:** If the user is experiencing sadness, prioritize content that evokes gentle joy or nostalgia.
*   **Emotional Lifting:** If the user is feeling neutral, prioritize content with a gradually increasing emotional arc (building excitement or wonder).
*   **Emotional Grounding:** If the user is experiencing high anxiety, prioritize content with calm, soothing visuals and sounds.
*   **Novelty/Surprise:** Periodically introduce content with unexpected emotional tones to prevent emotional fatigue. (Controlled by a 'serendipity' factor)

**IV. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Wearable sensor integration (heart rate, skin conductance) via Bluetooth.
*   Real-time video/audio processing capabilities (edge computing or cloud-based).
*   Device camera access (for facial expression analysis – with user consent, of course!).
