## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction & Interactive Layering

**Concept:** Extend the ability to capture not just the *presented* image, but reconstruct the layered scene *behind* the display, enabling interactive manipulation and augmentation of the captured reality.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution depth sensor (ToF or structured light) integrated into the camera device. Minimum range: 0.5m - 5m. Resolution: 512x512 depth map.
    *   Wide-angle RGB camera (at least 12MP) synchronized with the depth sensor. Field of View: 90 degrees.
    *   Processing unit within the camera capable of real-time depth map processing and point cloud generation.
*   **Software (Camera Device):**
    *   **Scene Capture Module:** Captures synchronized RGB and depth data.
    *   **Depth Processing:** Filters noise, performs outlier removal, and generates a cleaned depth map.
    *   **Point Cloud Generation:** Converts the depth map into a 3D point cloud.
    *   **Display Boundary Detection:** Identifies the edges of the display device in the RGB image using edge detection algorithms (Canny, Sobel) and perspective correction based on detected corners.
    *   **Scene Segmentation:** Segments the point cloud into foreground (objects in front of the display) and background (content on the display and what's *behind* it).  Segmentation is based on depth values relative to the display plane.
    *   **Layer Extraction:** Creates separate point cloud layers representing:
        *   Display Layer (content *on* the display, reconstructed from display data if available - see 'Presentation Device Communication')
        *   Foreground Layer (objects in front of the display)
        *   Background Layer (scene *behind* the display)
    *   **Data Packaging:** Packages the layered point cloud data (including RGB color information per point), display boundary data, and metadata (timestamp, device geolocation) for transmission.

*   **Software (Presentation Device):**
    *   **Presentation Data API:**  Provides access to currently displayed images/frames, application state, and associated metadata.
    *   **Communication Protocol:** Secure, low-latency communication protocol (e.g., WebSockets, gRPC) for data exchange between camera and presentation device.
    *   **Optional: Display Layer Reconstruction:** If the presentation device supports it, it can proactively transmit a high-resolution rendered image of the content currently displayed, providing an extremely accurate display layer for reconstruction.

*   **Software (Processing/Server Side):**
    *   **Data Reception & Validation:** Receives data packages from the camera device, validates data integrity, and stores data temporarily.
    *   **Point Cloud Registration & Fusion:** Registers and fuses the layered point clouds from the camera, potentially leveraging simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques for improved accuracy and drift correction.
    *   **Interactive Layering Engine:** Enables users to:
        *   Select individual layers (foreground, display, background)
        *   Isolate layers for viewing
        *   Manipulate layers (translate, rotate, scale)
        *   Add/remove layers
        *   Apply effects to layers (e.g., color correction, blending)
    *   **Augmentation Engine:** Allows users to add new virtual objects to the reconstructed scene, seamlessly integrating them with the existing layers.
    *   **Rendering Engine:**  Renders the final augmented scene from any desired viewpoint.
    *   **Storage:** Persistent storage of reconstructed scenes and user modifications.

**Pseudocode (Camera â€“ Scene Capture & Layering):**

```pseudocode
function captureScene():
  rgbImage = captureRGBImage()
  depthMap = captureDepthMap()
  displayBoundary = detectDisplayBoundary(rgbImage)
  pointCloud = generatePointCloud(depthMap, rgbImage)
  segmentedPointCloud = segmentPointCloud(pointCloud, displayBoundary)
  displayLayer = extractLayer(segmentedPointCloud, displayBoundary, "display")
  foregroundLayer = extractLayer(segmentedPointCloud, displayBoundary, "foreground")
  backgroundLayer = extractLayer(segmentedPointCloud, displayBoundary, "background")
  dataPackage = createDataPackage(displayLayer, foregroundLayer, backgroundLayer, displayBoundary, timestamp, geolocation)
  sendDataPackage(dataPackage)
```

**Novelty:**

The core innovation lies in capturing the depth information *behind* the display, allowing for reconstruction of the complete scene. Existing solutions focus on replacing the display content with a more accurate representation. This system allows for true augmentation of the captured reality, creating possibilities for interactive experiences, virtual set extensions, and advanced image manipulation.  The layering approach facilitates targeted editing and augmentation of specific elements within the scene.
