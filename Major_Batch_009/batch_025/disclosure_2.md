## Adaptive Environmental Mapping & Predictive Command Execution

**Concept:** Expand the device’s understanding of its environment beyond simple obstacle avoidance to create a dynamic, predictive system where commands are subtly modified *before* execution based on anticipated environmental interactions. This moves beyond reactive adjustments to proactive command shaping.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a low-resolution, wide-field-of-view depth sensor (e.g., time-of-flight) alongside existing sensors. Add a microphone array for enhanced spatial audio analysis.
*   **Environmental Model:** The device maintains a layered environmental model:
    *   *Static Layer:* Long-term map of fixed obstacles (walls, furniture).
    *   *Dynamic Layer:* Short-term tracking of moving objects (people, pets).
    *   *Predictive Layer:* AI-driven prediction of object trajectories and potential environmental changes (e.g., a door likely to open, a person approaching). This is built using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on sensor data.
*   **Command Interception & Modification Module:**  All incoming commands are intercepted *before* execution. This module analyzes:
    *   The command itself (desired movement, action).
    *   The current environmental model (all layers).
    *   A 'risk assessment' score based on potential collisions or disruptions.
*   **Command Modification Algorithm:** Based on the above analysis, the algorithm modifies the command parameters:
    *   **Trajectory Adjustment:**  Slightly alters the movement path to avoid predicted obstacles or optimize for smoother movement.
    *   **Velocity Scaling:** Reduces speed in areas with high risk or uncertainty.
    *   **Action Sequencing:**  If a command requires multiple steps, re-orders them to account for environmental factors (e.g., pausing to allow a person to pass).
    *   **Preemptive Actions:** Triggers small, preparatory actions to improve command success (e.g., gently nudging an object out of the path before approaching).
*   **User Feedback & Learning:**
    *   Record instances where modified commands resulted in improved performance.
    *   Allow the user to ‘override’ modifications and provide feedback on their effectiveness.
    *   Use this data to refine the predictive model and command modification algorithm.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
function processCommand(command, userProfile) {
  environmentModel = getEnvironmentModel()
  riskAssessment = calculateRisk(command, environmentModel)

  if (riskAssessment > threshold) {
    modifiedCommand = modifyCommand(command, environmentModel, riskAssessment)
  } else {
    modifiedCommand = command
  }

  executeCommand(modifiedCommand)
  logCommandExecution(command, modifiedCommand)

  //User feedback loop
  if (userOverride){
    updateModel(command, modifiedCommand, userFeedback)
  }

}

function modifyCommand(command, environmentModel, riskAssessment) {
  //Adjust trajectory based on predicted obstacles
  adjustedTrajectory = calculateSafeTrajectory(command.path, environmentModel.dynamicLayer)

  //Scale velocity based on risk assessment
  scaledVelocity = max(minVelocity, command.velocity * (1 - riskAssessment))

  //Return modified command
  return {path: adjustedTrajectory, velocity: scaledVelocity}
}
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Increased processing power for real-time environmental analysis and prediction. Improved battery life to support continuous sensor operation.
*   **Potential Applications:** Autonomous navigation in complex and dynamic environments. Enhanced safety and reliability of robotic systems. Personalized and adaptive user experience.
