## Adaptive Address Graph with Temporal Layers

**Concept:** Extend the address graph to incorporate a temporal dimension, allowing for tracking of address changes over time and improved address resolution based on historical data. This builds on the core graph tree structure, adding layers representing different points in time.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structure: Temporal Address Graph (TAG)**

   *   **Base Graph:** The existing address graph structure (as described in the patent) forms the base layer.
   *   **Temporal Layers:**  For each significant address change (identified via external data sources - see section 3), a new layer is created.  Each layer mirrors the base graph structure but reflects the address components *as they existed at that specific time*.
   *   **Layer Links:** Each vertex in a temporal layer is linked to its corresponding vertex in the previous layer. If a vertex doesn't exist in the previous layer (new street name, new building number), a "creation" link is established.  If a vertex no longer exists, a “deletion” link is established.
   *   **Metadata:** Each layer includes metadata: timestamp of the change, source of the change data (e.g., postal service update, user-provided correction).

**2.  Algorithm: Time-Aware Address Resolution**

   1.  **Input:** User-provided address string, current timestamp (optional - defaults to current time).
   2.  **Initial Search:**  Begin the search in the *current* layer of the TAG.  Use the existing depth-first search techniques to find potential matches.
   3.  **Temporal Backtracking:** If no results are found in the current layer:
        *   Iterate backwards through the temporal layers (older layers).
        *   Perform the same depth-first search in each layer.
        *   Assign a “relevance score” to each potential match based on the layer's timestamp. Newer layers have higher relevance.
   4.  **Relevance Aggregation:**  Combine relevance scores from all layers into a single aggregate score.
   5.  **Output:**  Present the highest-scoring matches to the user, including the timestamp of the data used for the match.

**3. Data Sources & Update Mechanism**

   *   **Postal Service APIs:** Integrate with postal service APIs to receive address change notifications.
   *   **Crowdsourced Data:** Allow users to submit address corrections or updates.  Implement a reputation system to validate the quality of crowdsourced data.
   *   **Geocoding Services:**  Leverage geocoding services to detect changes in geographic coordinates associated with an address.
   *   **Automated Update Trigger:**  Monitor data sources for changes.  When a significant change is detected, automatically create a new layer in the TAG.  Define "significant change" thresholds (e.g., street name change, building demolition) to avoid unnecessary layer creation.

**4. Pseudocode - Time-Aware Search**

```
FUNCTION TimeAwareAddressSearch(addressString, timestamp):
  currentLayer = GetCurrentLayer()
  matches = DepthFirstSearch(currentLayer, addressString)

  IF matches is empty:
    FOR layer IN GetHistoricalLayers() (ordered by timestamp, newest to oldest):
      matches = DepthFirstSearch(layer, addressString)
      IF matches is not empty:
        break // Stop searching once a match is found

  IF matches is not empty:
    // Calculate relevance score based on layer timestamp
    relevanceScore = CalculateRelevanceScore(layer.timestamp)

    RETURN (matches, relevanceScore)
  ELSE:
    RETURN ([], 0) // No matches found
```

**5. Scalability Considerations**

   *   **Layer Pruning:**  Implement a mechanism to prune old layers that are no longer relevant (e.g., layers older than 10 years).
   *   **Data Partitioning:**  Partition the TAG across multiple servers to handle large datasets.
   *   **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed layers and vertices to improve performance.
