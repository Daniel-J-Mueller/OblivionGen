## Adaptive Audio Beaconing & Network Topology Mapping

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

The system centers around proactive audio ‘beaconing’ – periodic, low-power transmission of uniquely identifiable audio signatures – not for immediate audio reception, but for robust and dynamic network topology mapping. Devices aren’t *listening* for coherent audio; they are detecting the *presence* of the beacon, measuring signal characteristics (RSSI, frequency drift, estimated distance), and constructing a localized network graph.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   **Enhanced Audio Transceiver:** Standard audio codec + a dedicated, low-power RF transmitter/receiver operating in a sub-GHz frequency band (e.g., 915 MHz in the US, 868 MHz in Europe).  This is *separate* from the primary audio transmission channel.
*   **Triangulation Module:**  Hardware acceleration for triangulation algorithms (laterite, multi-lateration) – crucial for accurate localization with limited anchor points.
*   **Micro-Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** 6-axis or 9-axis IMU to compensate for device movement during beacon detection and improve localization accuracy.
*   **Low-Power Processing Core:** Dedicated microcontroller for beacon processing, IMU data fusion, and network graph construction.

**III. Software Architecture:**

1.  **Beacon Generation Module:** Generates unique, digitally signed audio beacons.  Beacon content includes device ID, timestamp, and potentially environmental data (temperature, humidity).  Beacon frequency and power level are dynamically adjusted based on network density.
2.  **Beacon Detection & Analysis Module:** Receives RF signals, filters out noise, and identifies valid beacons.  Calculates signal characteristics (RSSI, frequency offset) and estimates distance using triangulation.
3.  **Network Graph Construction Module:** Builds and maintains a localized network graph representing the relationships between devices.  Nodes represent devices, and edges represent RF links with associated signal strength and estimated distance.
4.  **Dynamic Topology Adaptation Module:**  Constantly updates the network graph based on new beacon detections and signal changes.  Identifies network bottlenecks, potential interference sources, and optimal communication paths.
5.  **Proactive Interference Mitigation Module:** Uses the network graph to predict potential interference and dynamically adjust device transmission parameters (frequency, power level, data rate) to minimize collisions.
6.  **Audio Steering Algorithm:** Utilizes the network topology map to dynamically route audio streams through the optimal path.

**IV. Pseudocode (Audio Steering Algorithm):**

```pseudocode
function findOptimalPath(sourceDevice, destinationDevice, networkGraph):
  // Dijkstra’s Algorithm or A* Search with cost function based on:
  //   - Signal Strength (higher is better)
  //   - Estimated Distance (shorter is better)
  //   - Interference Levels (lower is better)

  path = searchAlgorithm(networkGraph, sourceDevice, destinationDevice)

  return path

function routeAudioStream(audioStream, optimalPath):
  // Transmit audio stream hop-by-hop along the optimal path
  for each hop in optimalPath:
    transmit(audioStream, hop.nextDevice)
    receive(audioStream, hop.nextDevice)
```

**V. Novelty & Potential Applications:**

This system transcends simple signal quality monitoring. It creates a *dynamic, self-organizing* network map using audio as a beacon, enabling:

*   **Enhanced Mesh Networking:**  Improved resilience and performance in ad-hoc audio networks.
*   **Indoor Localization:**  Precise indoor positioning without relying on GPS or Wi-Fi.
*   **Smart Audio Environments:**  Automatic adjustment of audio settings based on room acoustics and device locations.
*   **Automated Audio Conferencing:**  Seamless switching between devices and optimized audio routing for multi-party calls.
*   **Proactive Interference Avoidance:** Anticipating and mitigating interference before it impacts audio quality.
