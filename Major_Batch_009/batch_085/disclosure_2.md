## Adaptive Label Weighting based on Prediction Confidence Drift

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on determining *complete* label sets. This design extends that by introducing dynamic weighting of labels *within* a predicted set, based on observed confidence drift over time, allowing for nuanced classification and improved model calibration. It's especially useful in scenarios where label relevance changes (e.g., news articles where topics become stale, user preferences evolve).

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `LabelConfidenceRecord`:
    *   `label_id`: Integer – Unique identifier for the label.
    *   `timestamp`: Timestamp – When the confidence score was recorded.
    *   `confidence_score`: Float – Prediction confidence for this label on a given item.
    *   `drift_rate`: Float – Calculated rate of change in confidence (explained below).
*   `ItemLabelProfiles`:
    *   `item_id`: Integer – Unique identifier for the item.
    *   `label_profiles`: Dictionary – Key: `label_id`, Value: List of `LabelConfidenceRecord` objects.
*   `DriftThresholds`:
    *   `positive_drift_threshold`: Float – Threshold above which confidence increase is considered significant.
    *   `negative_drift_threshold`: Float – Threshold below which confidence decrease is considered significant.
    *   `stale_label_threshold`: Float – Absolute confidence level below which a label is considered stale.

**2. Modules/Components:**

*   **Prediction Listener:** Intercepts prediction scores from the existing machine learning model. For each item and predicted label, creates or appends a `LabelConfidenceRecord` to the item’s `label_profiles`.
*   **Drift Calculator:** Periodically (e.g., every hour, configurable) processes each `label_profiles` entry:
    *   Calculates the drift rate for each label by analyzing the slope of the confidence scores over time. A simple linear regression can be used.
    *   Flags labels with significant positive or negative drift rates based on `DriftThresholds`.
    *   Flags labels that fall below the `stale_label_threshold`.
*   **Label Weight Adjuster:**
    *   Takes the initial prediction scores and the drift information.
    *   Applies weighting factors to the prediction scores:
        *   **Positive Drift:** Increase the weight of the label (e.g., multiply by 1.1).
        *   **Negative Drift:** Decrease the weight of the label (e.g., multiply by 0.9).
        *   **Stale Label:** Significantly reduce the weight (e.g., multiply by 0.1) or remove from the predicted set entirely.
    *   Normalizes the weighted scores to ensure they sum to 1.
*   **Classification Engine:** Uses the adjusted (weighted) prediction scores to determine the final classification for the item.

**3. Pseudocode (Label Weight Adjuster):**

```python
def adjust_label_weights(item_id, prediction_scores, label_profiles, drift_thresholds):
    weighted_scores = {}
    for label_id, score in prediction_scores.items():
        base_weight = score
        drift_info = label_profiles[item_id][label_id] # Access drift information

        if drift_info.drift_rate > drift_thresholds.positive_drift_threshold:
            weight_multiplier = 1.1
        elif drift_info.drift_rate < -drift_thresholds.negative_drift_threshold:
            weight_multiplier = 0.9
        elif drift_info.confidence_score < drift_thresholds.stale_label_threshold:
            weight_multiplier = 0.1
        else:
            weight_multiplier = 1.0

        weighted_score = base_weight * weight_multiplier
        weighted_scores[label_id] = weighted_score

    # Normalize weighted scores
    total_weight = sum(weighted_scores.values())
    normalized_scores = {label_id: score / total_weight for label_id, score in weighted_scores.items()}

    return normalized_scores
```

**4. Implementation Notes:**

*   The `drift_thresholds` should be configurable and potentially learned from historical data.
*   The `drift_rate` calculation can be refined using more sophisticated time series analysis techniques.
*   Consider using exponential smoothing to give more weight to recent confidence scores.
*   This system can be integrated into the existing patent’s framework by adding the data collection and weight adjustment steps.
*   Could easily be deployed as a microservice consuming predictions from existing models.
