## Multi-Chamber Electrowetting Array for Dynamic Color Mixing

**Concept:** An array of individually addressable electrowetting elements, each containing *three* immiscible fluids of primary colors (red, green, blue). By precisely controlling the electrowetting behavior within each element, we can create a full spectrum of colors *within a single pixel*. This bypasses the need for traditional color filters or micro-lenses, leading to potentially brighter, higher resolution displays, or dynamically adjustable optical filters.

**Specs:**

*   **Element Size:** 50 μm x 50 μm (scalable)
*   **Array Configuration:** Matrix arrangement – e.g., 1024 x 768 elements.
*   **Fluid Composition:**
    *   Red: Oil-based dye with high red spectral emission.
    *   Green: Oil-based dye with high green spectral emission.
    *   Blue: Oil-based dye with high blue spectral emission.
    *   Carrier Fluid: Clear, electrically insulating oil.
*   **Substrate:** Glass or flexible polymer.
*   **Electrode Structure:**
    *   Each element will have *three* individually addressable ITO electrodes, one for each color fluid.
    *   Electrodes are patterned to create micro-chambers within each element to contain and control the individual fluids.
    *   Electrode spacing: 10 μm.
*   **Layer Stack:**
    1.  Glass/Polymer Substrate
    2.  Bottom ITO electrode (common ground)
    3.  Dielectric Layer (SiN or SiO2 – 100 nm)
    4.  Micro-chamber walls (SiN or polymer – 2 μm) – defining the three sub-chambers.
    5.  Three individually addressable ITO electrodes (top layer, patterned for sub-chamber control).
    6.  Hydrophobic coating (to ensure fluid immiscibility and electrowetting behavior).
*   **Optical Considerations:**
    *   The hydrophobic coating will be optimized for minimal light scattering and high transmission.
    *   The chamber walls will be designed to minimize internal reflections.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Each electrode will be connected to a dedicated driver circuit.
    *   A microcontroller will manage the driver circuits and control the voltage applied to each electrode.
    *   Control algorithm will implement a color lookup table and a PWM scheme to precisely control the color output of each element.

**Pseudocode (Color Mixing Algorithm):**

```
// Input: Desired RGB color value (R, G, B) - values from 0 to 255
// Output: PWM duty cycles for each electrode (Red_Duty, Green_Duty, Blue_Duty)

function calculate_duty_cycles(R, G, B) {
    // Normalize RGB values to a range of 0 to 1
    Red_Normalized = R / 255.0;
    Green_Normalized = G / 255.0;
    Blue_Normalized = B / 255.0;

    // Map normalized values to PWM duty cycles (adjust range as needed)
    Red_Duty = Red_Normalized * 100.0;
    Green_Duty = Green_Normalized * 100.0;
    Blue_Duty = Blue_Normalized * 100.0;

    // Ensure duty cycles are within valid range (0 to 100)
    Red_Duty = constrain(Red_Duty, 0, 100);
    Green_Duty = constrain(Green_Duty, 0, 100);
    Blue_Duty = constrain(Blue_Duty, 0, 100);

    return (Red_Duty, Green_Duty, Blue_Duty);
}

// Main loop:
// 1. Get desired RGB color value from image or user input.
// 2. Call calculate_duty_cycles() to get PWM duty cycles.
// 3. Set PWM duty cycles for each electrode.
```
