## Dynamic Environmental Storytelling via Bulletin Board Network

**Concept:** Expand the bulletin board system to function as a localized, dynamic environmental storytelling platform. Instead of solely delivering event calendars, the system will adapt content based on user proximity, time of day, local events *not* explicitly scheduled (weather, traffic, social media trends), and even inferred user emotional state (via anonymized facial recognition – opt-in only).

**System Specs:**

*   **Networked Bulletin Boards:**  Deploy a network of the existing bulletin boards across a defined geographic area (e.g., a campus, shopping mall, airport). Each board must be IP-connected and capable of high-resolution visual and audio output.

*   **Data Aggregation Module:**  A central server gathers data from multiple sources:
    *   Scheduled events (as per the existing patent).
    *   Real-time weather data.
    *   Local traffic conditions.
    *   Public social media feeds (filtered for relevant keywords and location).
    *   Anonymized foot traffic data (to determine dwell times and popular routes).
    *   Optional:  Facial emotion recognition (with explicit user consent – a small indicator on the board would signal this is active) to tailor content towards positive reinforcement.
*   **Content Generation Engine:**  This module dynamically creates content “scenes” based on aggregated data. These scenes are not static advertisements but short, contextual narratives.
    *   **Example 1 (Morning Commute):** User approaches board during rush hour. Board displays a visualization of traffic flow, a brief weather update, and a motivational quote related to perseverance.
    *   **Example 2 (Rainy Day):**  Board shows a soothing animated scene of rain, lists nearby coffee shops with special offers, and suggests indoor activities.
    *   **Example 3 (Local Sports Win):**  Board displays celebratory graphics and highlights of the game, triggered by social media activity and real-time sports scores.
*   **Proximity & Identification Integration:** The existing badge reader is crucial. 
    *   Upon badge scan (or optional facial recognition), the system retrieves user preferences (from a privacy-protected database) regarding content categories (e.g., news, sports, entertainment).
    *   The system also tracks user paths and dwell times to refine content delivery over time.
*   **Content Delivery Protocol:**  A robust streaming protocol ensures smooth playback of dynamic content on each bulletin board. Supports variable resolution and audio quality based on network bandwidth.
*   **Admin Interface:** A web-based dashboard allows administrators to:
    *   Monitor system performance.
    *   Configure content sources and filters.
    *   Create custom content templates.
    *   Manage user preferences.
    *   Analyze content effectiveness (dwell times, engagement metrics).

**Pseudocode (Content Generation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateContent(badgeID, location, time, weather, traffic, socialTrends)

  userPreferences = GetUserPreferences(badgeID)
  relevantEvents = GetEvents(location, time)

  IF weather == "Rain" THEN
    scene = CreateRainyDayScene(userPreferences, relevantEvents)
  ELSE IF traffic == "Congested" THEN
    scene = CreateTrafficAlertScene(userPreferences, relevantEvents)
  ELSE
    scene = CreateDefaultScene(userPreferences, relevantEvents)

  IF socialTrends contains "Local Sports Win" THEN
    AddSportsCelebrationOverlay(scene)

  RETURN scene
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-brightness displays suitable for outdoor and indoor environments.
*   Weatherproof enclosures.
*   High-quality speakers.
*   Secure network connectivity.
*   Power backup systems.
