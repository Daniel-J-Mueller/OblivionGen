## Dynamic Network Persona Shifting

**Concept:** Instead of simply regulating bandwidth *during* an attack, proactively establish and dynamically shift "network personas" for critical computing resources *before* attacks are detected. These personas pre-configure network characteristics – bandwidth allocation, routing priorities, acceptable packet types – tailored to anticipated threat profiles.

**Specifications:**

*   **Persona Database:** A central repository storing pre-defined network personas. Each persona is defined by:
    *   Bandwidth Limits (ingress/egress)
    *   Routing Table Presets
    *   Allowed/Blocked Protocol/Port Combinations
    *   Quality of Service (QoS) settings
    *   Firewall Rule Sets
    *   Intrusion Detection System (IDS) configurations.
*   **Threat Intelligence Feed Integration:** The system subscribes to real-time threat intelligence feeds. These feeds categorize threats and provide associated “Persona Recommendations.”
*   **Resource Monitoring & Predictive Analysis:** Continuously monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O) and historical traffic patterns. Employ machine learning to *predict* potential attacks based on anomalies.
*   **Dynamic Persona Application:** When a threat is predicted *or* detected, the system dynamically applies the recommended (or most appropriate) persona to the targeted computing resource. This occurs *before* significant impact.
*   **Graduated Persona Levels:** Implement multiple levels of personas.  "Level 1" might be a minor adjustment to QoS settings. "Level 3" could be a complete network isolation with limited external communication.
*   **Persona "Shadowing":**  Before activating a persona, "shadow" it on a staging environment. Validate its effectiveness and impact *without* affecting production traffic.
*   **Automated Persona Creation/Adjustment:** The system automatically learns from attack events and adjusts existing personas or creates new ones.  This is done through reinforcement learning, rewarding persona configurations that effectively mitigated threats.
*   **Network Segmentation Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with network segmentation technologies (e.g., microsegmentation).  Personas can define the boundaries and policies of these segments.
*   **API for External Integration:** Provide an API for integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and other security tools.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Main Loop
While (true) {

    //Receive Threat Intelligence Feed Updates
    ThreatData = GetThreatIntelligence();

    //Monitor Resource Utilization & Traffic Patterns
    ResourceData = MonitorResources();
    TrafficData = MonitorTraffic();

    //Predict Potential Attacks
    PredictedThreat = AnalyzeData(ResourceData, TrafficData, ThreatData);

    If (PredictedThreat != NULL) {
        RecommendedPersona = GetRecommendedPersona(PredictedThreat);
        ApplyPersona(RecommendedPersona, TargetResource);
    }

    //Detect Attacks
    DetectedAttack = DetectAttack(TrafficData);

    If (DetectedAttack != NULL) {
        RecommendedPersona = GetRecommendedPersona(DetectedAttack);
        ApplyPersona(RecommendedPersona, TargetResource);
    }
}

Function ApplyPersona(Persona, Resource){
    //Apply Firewall Rules
    ApplyFirewallRules(Persona.FirewallRules, Resource);

    //Apply Routing Table Presets
    ApplyRoutingTable(Persona.RoutingTable, Resource);

    //Configure QoS Settings
    ConfigureQoS(Persona.QoS, Resource);

    //Configure IDS Settings
    ConfigureIDS(Persona.IDS, Resource);
}
```

**Rationale:** Shifting from reactive bandwidth regulation to proactive persona application fundamentally changes the security posture.  Instead of trying to contain damage *after* an attack starts, the system proactively anticipates and prepares for threats, minimizing impact and improving resilience. This is a paradigm shift, not a refinement.
