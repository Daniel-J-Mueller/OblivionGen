## Adaptive Granularity Neural Network

**Concept:** A neural network architecture that dynamically adjusts the precision (granularity) of its weights and activations based on data complexity and computational resource availability. This differs from standard quantization or pruning techniques by operating *during* inference and training, offering a more fluid optimization.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** “Granularity Units” (GUs). Each layer will be composed of multiple GUs. A GU contains a standard neuron set *and* a “Granularity Controller.”
*   **Granularity Controller:** This sub-component monitors the input signal variance to its associated neuron set. High variance indicates potentially complex data requiring higher precision. Low variance suggests simpler data allowing lower precision.
*   **Precision Levels:** Defined set of precision levels (e.g., FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4). Each precision level requires distinct hardware/software implementation.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The Granularity Controller switches the precision level of its associated neuron set based on the input variance.  Switching includes re-scaling weights and activations as needed.
*   **Resource Aware Scaling:** A global “Resource Manager” monitors system resources (CPU, GPU, memory). It can override local Granularity Controller decisions to enforce resource limits.
*   **Training Integration:** Loss function includes a "Granularity Penalty" term.  This term encourages the network to learn solutions that allow for lower precision in most layers.  This penalty is weighted to balance accuracy and efficiency.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Within each Granularity Unit (GU)
function process_input(input_data):
  input_variance = calculate_variance(input_data)
  precision_level = determine_precision(input_variance, resource_manager.available_resources)
  scaled_weights = scale_weights(weights, precision_level)
  activation = calculate_activation(input_data, scaled_weights)
  scaled_activation = scale_activation(activation, precision_level)
  return scaled_activation

// Global Resource Manager
function manage_resources():
  available_resources = get_system_resources()
  //Distribute resource budgets to individual GUs.
  //Override local precision decisions if necessary.

//Training Update
loss = standard_loss + granularity_penalty * sum(precision_levels)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Reconfigurable Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs):**  ALUs capable of efficiently switching between different precision modes.
*   **Fine-grained Memory Access:**  Memory architecture optimized for accessing data in different precision formats.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Efficient protocol to transfer different precision data between layers.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Efficiency:** Reduced memory footprint and computational cost.
*   **Adaptive Performance:** Network adjusts to varying data complexity.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Maximized utilization of available resources.
*   **Edge Device Compatibility:** Enables deployment of complex models on resource-constrained devices.
