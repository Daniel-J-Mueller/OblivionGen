## Adaptive Session State Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of session state transferred during scaling events, based on real-time connection activity and predicted future needs. This moves beyond transferring *all* session state, to transferring only what is *actively* needed, or what *will likely* be needed soon.

**Specification:**

**1. Session State Profiler:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors active connections, tracking:
    *   Frequency of access to different session state variables.
    *   Temporal patterns of access (e.g., peak usage times, predictable sequences).
    *   Data size of each session state variable.
*   **Implementation:**  A lightweight agent running alongside each server instance.  Uses sampling and probabilistic modeling to reduce overhead.
*   **Output:** A ‘Session State Profile’ for each connection, indicating the importance and size of different state elements.

**2. Predictive State Transfer Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Analyzes the Session State Profile to determine a ‘State Transfer Plan’ for each connection during a scale event.  The plan specifies:
    *   Which session state variables to transfer immediately.
    *   Which variables to transfer lazily (on first access after the scale).
    *   Which variables can be reconstructed from other data or are considered unimportant.
*   **Algorithm:** A hybrid approach combining:
    *   **Rule-based system:**  Predefined rules based on application-specific knowledge (e.g., "user authentication tokens are always critical").
    *   **Machine learning model:**  Trained on historical session activity data to predict future access patterns.  Could use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture temporal dependencies.
*   **Output:**  A ‘State Transfer Plan’ for each connection.

**3.  Lazy State Fetcher:**

*   **Function:**  Resides on the scaled server.  Intercepts requests for session state variables not transferred during the initial scale.
*   **Implementation:**  A caching layer with a mechanism to retrieve missing data from:
    *   The original server (using a temporary, low-bandwidth connection).
    *   A shared data store (e.g., Redis) containing frequently accessed or reconstructed state.
*   **Operation:**  On a cache miss, the Lazy State Fetcher retrieves the data, caches it locally, and returns it to the client.

**4. Connection-Level Negotiation:**

*   **Function:** Establish a negotiation protocol between the request router, the original server, and the scaled server to determine optimal state transfer strategy per connection.
*   **Protocol:** A lightweight, message-based protocol using a dedicated control channel. Messages include:
    *   Connection identifier
    *   Session State Profile summary
    *   Requested State Transfer Plan
    *   Acknowledgement/Rejection of the plan.

**Pseudocode (Request Router):**

```
function handleScaleEvent(oldServer, newServer):
  for each connection in oldServer.connections:
    profile = oldServer.getSessionStateProfile(connection)
    plan = generateStateTransferPlan(profile)
    transferState(connection, newServer, plan)

function generateStateTransferPlan(profile):
  // Rule-based & ML model combined
  if profile.auth_token_accessed:
    plan.critical.add(auth_token)
  if profile.shopping_cart_size > 0:
    plan.important.add(shopping_cart)
  // ML model predicts future access
  predicted_access = ml_model.predict(profile)
  plan.deferred = predicted_access // variables to fetch lazily
  return plan

function transferState(connection, newServer, plan):
  for variable in plan.critical:
    state = connection.getState(variable)
    newServer.setState(variable, state)
  // Deferred state is handled by Lazy State Fetcher on newServer
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced scaling time (less data to transfer).
*   Lower bandwidth consumption.
*   Improved scalability (only transfer what is needed).
*   Increased resilience (reduced dependency on the original server).
