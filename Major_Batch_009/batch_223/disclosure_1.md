**Dynamic Contextual Card Stacking & 'Micro-Experiences'**

**Concept:** Expand the interactive card system beyond simple scrolling and launching 'instant experiences'. Introduce a dynamically stacked card system where cards *morph* and present ‘micro-experiences’ *within* the card itself, eliminating the need for a full app/page load for common tasks. Leverage user proximity (device orientation/motion) to reveal/trigger these micro-experiences.

**Specs:**

1.  **Card Stack Management:**
    *   Cards are not presented linearly, but in a stack (Z-axis). Higher priority/frequently used cards are ‘closer’ to the user (visually and in data structure).
    *   Stack order is dynamically adjusted based on usage patterns, time of day, location, and predicted user intent (using a predictive model).
    *   The system maintains a ‘focus card’ – the card currently in focus (visually prominent). Other cards are partially visible/blurred in the background.

2.  **Micro-Experience Triggers:**
    *   **Proximity/Motion:** Device tilt/rotation reveals hidden elements *within* the card. Example: Tilting a ‘Shopping’ card reveals a quick-access price comparison slider.
    *   **Haptic Feedback Zones:** Cards have defined haptic zones. Different pressures/gestures trigger specific micro-experiences. Example: Pressing firmly on a ‘Music’ card starts a quick preview of the currently playing song.
    *   **Gaze Tracking (if available):** User gaze on a specific element within the card triggers a related micro-experience.
    *   **Voice Commands:** Voice commands interact with micro-experiences *within* the card.

3.  **Micro-Experience Types:**
    *   **Interactive Widgets:** Small, functional widgets directly embedded within the card. Example: A ‘Calendar’ card displays a mini-calendar and allows users to add events.
    *   **Quick Actions:** Predefined actions that can be completed without leaving the card. Example: A ‘Flight’ card allows users to check-in for their flight with one tap.
    *   **Contextual Data Previews:** Real-time data previews without navigating to a full page. Example: A ‘News’ card displays a scrolling headline feed with expandable summaries.
    *   **Gamified Interactions:** Small, gamified elements to encourage engagement. Example: A ‘Fitness’ card displays a progress bar and rewards users for completing tasks.

4.  **API & Data Structure:**
    *   `CardStackManager`: Handles card stack ordering, prioritization, and rendering.
    *   `Card`: Base class for all interactive cards. Contains data, micro-experience triggers, and rendering logic.
    *   `MicroExperience`: Abstract class for all micro-experiences. Defines the interface for triggering and rendering micro-experiences.
    *   `Trigger`: Interface for defining trigger conditions (proximity, haptic feedback, gaze tracking, voice commands).

5.  **Pseudocode (Micro-Experience Trigger):**

```
function onCardSelected(card) {
  //Determine all triggers for card
  triggers = card.getTriggers()

  //Loop through all triggers and check conditions
  for (trigger in triggers) {
    if (trigger.isConditionMet()) {
      trigger.executeMicroExperience()
    }
  }
}

function isConditionMet() {
  //Condition checking logic (proximity, haptic, gaze)
  //return true if condition is met, false otherwise
}
```

6.  **Rendering Engine Adaptation:** The rendering engine must support layered rendering (Z-axis) and dynamic content updates within cards. A lightweight animation library is needed for smooth transitions between micro-experiences.
