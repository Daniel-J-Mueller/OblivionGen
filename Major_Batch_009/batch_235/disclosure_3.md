## Automated Workstation Swarm Orchestration

**Concept:** Expand the mobile drive unit system to enable dynamic workstation *creation* via temporary aggregation of modular, mobile units. Instead of simply *delivering* to fixed workstations, the system *builds* them on demand.

**Specs:**

*   **Modular Unit Types:**
    *   **Base Unit:** Provides power, network connectivity, and a basic stable platform. Equipped with omnidirectional wheels and docking connectors.
    *   **Work Surface Unit:** Flat, durable surface that docks onto Base Units. Multiple sizes available.
    *   **Tool/Supply Unit:** Holds specialized tools (e.g., label applicators, wrapping stations) or specific supplies. Docks onto Work Surface Units.
    *   **Ergonomic Support Unit:** Adjustable height/angle supports for operators – docks onto Work Surface Units.
    *   **Containment Unit:**  Small, localized waste/recycling receptacles.
*   **Swarm Control Module:** A central software system communicating with all mobile units via a mesh network.
*   **Unit Identification:**  Each unit tagged with a unique RF/visual identifier.
*   **Docking Mechanism:**  Standardized, high-reliability docking connectors – magnetic assist + physical lock. Must support power/data transfer.
*   **Obstacle Avoidance:**  All mobile units equipped with LiDAR/computer vision for dynamic obstacle avoidance.
*   **Operator Interface:**  Touchscreen/voice control for requesting workstation configurations.
*   **Safety Protocols:** Emergency stop buttons on each unit. Automated shutoff if docking is unstable.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Orchestration):**

```
FUNCTION createWorkstation(request)
  // request contains: workstationType (e.g. "giftWrap", "shippingLabel"), location
  
  //Determine required units for requested workstationType
  unitsRequired = getUnitsForType(workstationType)
  
  //Find available units
  availableUnits = findAvailableUnits(unitsRequired)
  
  IF availableUnits.count < unitsRequired.count THEN
    DISPLAY "Insufficient available units"
    RETURN
  ENDIF
  
  //Assign units to workstation, path planning to location
  FOR EACH unit IN availableUnits
    planPath(unit, location)
    moveUnit(unit)
  ENDFOR
  
  //Dock units in pre-defined configuration (stored in workstationType definition)
  FOR EACH unit IN availableUnits
    dockUnit(unit, neighborUnit, dockingPoint)
  ENDFOR
  
  //Signal workstation ready
  DISPLAY "Workstation ready at " + location
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION dockUnit(unit, neighborUnit, dockingPoint)
  //Move unit towards dockingPoint on neighborUnit
  //Engage magnetic assist
  //Verify physical lock
  //Establish power/data connection
END FUNCTION
```

**Innovation:** This system shifts from fixed infrastructure to a dynamically reconfigurable fulfillment environment.  Instead of *going* to a workstation, the workstation *comes* to the inventory.  It enables rapid scaling, adaptation to changing order volumes, and creation of specialized work areas on demand. It's akin to a robotic LEGO system for manufacturing/fulfillment.
