## Dynamic Perspective Compositing for Mixed Reality Streaming

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic range conversion concepts to incorporate multi-camera setups and perspective manipulation for immersive mixed reality streaming.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum 3 synchronized cameras (RGB + Depth capable preferred) – User configurable quantity.
    *   High-performance processing unit (GPU/TPU accelerated).
    *   Local display (HDR capable).
    *   Network interface (high bandwidth, low latency).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Camera Calibration & Synchronization:** Module to calibrate camera positions/orientations and synchronize capture timestamps.
    *   **Depth Map Generation:** If cameras lack native depth sensing, module to generate depth maps from stereo vision.
    *   **View Synthesis:** Core module that constructs arbitrary viewpoints based on captured images and depth information. This utilizes a neural radiance field (NeRF) or similar representation for high-quality view interpolation.
    *   **Dynamic Range Mapping:** Existing HDR/SDR conversion functionality, applied independently to game and camera feeds, and adjusted for synthesized views.
    *   **Compositing Engine:** Module to seamlessly blend game video, camera video (potentially synthesized from novel viewpoints), and potentially augmented reality elements.  Handles occlusion and realistic blending.
    *   **Streaming Protocol:**  Custom protocol optimized for low-latency transmission of multi-view video streams and control data.
    *   **User Interface:** Allows user to select camera views, adjust rendering parameters, and control the AR experience.
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  **Capture:** Multiple cameras capture the game scene and player.
    2.  **Calibration & Synchronization:**  The system calibrates camera positions and synchronizes capture streams.
    3.  **Viewpoint Selection:** The user (or system) selects a desired viewing perspective.  This could be a first-person view, a third-person view, or an entirely novel perspective.
    4.  **View Synthesis:** The View Synthesis module generates images from the selected viewpoint using data from the multiple cameras.  Depth information is used to ensure realistic rendering.
    5.  **Dynamic Range Conversion:** HDR game video and synthesized camera video are converted to appropriate dynamic ranges (HDR for local display, SDR for remote SDR display).
    6.  **Compositing:** Game video and camera video are seamlessly blended, with AR elements potentially added.
    7.  **Streaming/Display:** The composite video stream is transmitted to remote viewers or displayed on a local HDR display.

**Pseudocode (View Synthesis):**

```
function synthesizeView(desiredViewpoint, cameraData[], depthMap):
  // cameraData: Array of camera position, orientation, and intrinsic parameters
  // depthMap: Depth map of the scene

  // 1. Ray generation:  For each pixel in the desired viewpoint:
  //    - Cast a ray from the camera through the pixel.
  // 2. Ray intersection:
  //    - Determine which camera's view the ray best aligns with.
  //    - Use the depth map to determine the distance to the intersection point.
  // 3. Pixel sampling:
  //    - Sample the color from the corresponding point in the selected camera's image.
  //    - Apply appropriate distortion correction and blending.
  // 4.  NeRF Integration (optional):
  //    - If NeRF is enabled, use the ray and depth map to query the NeRF representation for a more accurate color and density estimate.
  // 5. Return the synthesized pixel color.
```

**Innovation:**

The system goes beyond simple streaming by actively constructing the viewer’s perspective. This allows for immersive mixed reality experiences where the viewer can see the game world from any angle, as if they were physically present. It could enable novel forms of interactive entertainment and remote collaboration.  The NeRF integration further improves realism and allows for higher-quality view synthesis.
