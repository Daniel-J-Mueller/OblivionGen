## Dynamic Focal Point Adjustment for Displays

**Concept:** Expand the movement cancellation technology to selectively *enhance* perceived motion in specific areas of the display, creating a dynamic focal point. Instead of purely canceling movement, utilize the sensor data and pixel reassignment to create the *illusion* of greater detail and responsiveness in designated regions – think heads-up displays or gaming interfaces.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing sensor suite (accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity, camera - as per original patent).
    *   High-refresh-rate display (minimum 120Hz, ideally 240Hz+) to maximize perceived smoothness.
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time image manipulation and pixel reassignment.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Focal Point Definition Module:** Allows user or application to define one or more "focal points" on the display. These could be rectangular regions, circular areas, or even dynamically tracked objects (e.g., a cursor, a character in a game).
    *   **Motion Amplification Algorithm:**  Based on sensor data, this algorithm calculates a “motion vector” for the entire display. For areas *outside* the focal point(s), the standard movement cancellation is applied. *Within* the focal point(s), the motion vector is *multiplied* by an amplification factor (user-adjustable). This effectively exaggerates the perceived motion within that region.
    *   **Pixel Reassignment Engine:**  Similar to the original patent, but with added logic to handle the amplification factor.  The engine dynamically assigns content to physical pixels, but the amount of reassignment is proportional to the amplified motion vector *within* the focal point and the standard cancellation *outside* it.
    *   **Dynamic Focus Tracking:** An optional module leveraging the camera and object recognition to automatically track objects and adjust the focal point dynamically. This could be used to keep a fast-moving object in sharp focus, even during rapid display movement.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Input: Sensor Data (accelerationX, accelerationY, rotationZ), Focal Point Coordinates, Amplification Factor
// Output: Pixel Reassignment Map

function calculatePixelReassignment(sensorData, focalPoint, amplificationFactor) {

  motionVector = calculateMotionVector(sensorData); // Determine overall display motion

  pixelReassignmentMap = new Map(); // Holds reassignment instructions for each pixel

  for each pixel in display {
    if (pixel is within focalPoint) {
      // Amplify motion vector
      amplifiedMotionVector = motionVector * amplificationFactor;

      // Calculate new pixel position based on amplified motion
      newPixelPosition = pixelPosition + amplifiedMotionVector;

      pixelReassignmentMap.put(pixel, newPixelPosition);
    } else {
      // Apply standard cancellation (opposite direction of motion vector)
      newPixelPosition = pixelPosition - motionVector;

      pixelReassignmentMap.put(pixel, newPixelPosition);
    }
  }

  return pixelReassignmentMap;
}
```

**Application:**

*   **AR/VR Headsets:**  Improve perceived clarity and responsiveness of virtual objects during head movement.
*   **Gaming:** Highlight critical UI elements or character actions. Smooth tracking of fast movements.
*   **Heads-Up Displays (HUDs):** Emphasize key data points (speed, altitude, navigation) while minimizing perceived jitter.
*   **Accessibility:**  Assist users with motion sensitivity by selectively smoothing out movement in specific areas of the screen.
