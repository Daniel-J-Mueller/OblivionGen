## Multi-Axis Thermal Conductivity Mapping with Robotic Probe

**Concept:** Expand the single-point measurement of anisotropic thermal conductivity to a full-field mapping system using a miniature robotic probe capable of localized heating and cooling, coupled with infrared thermography. This allows for visualizing thermal anisotropy *across* a sample, identifying localized variations, defects, or layered structures.

**III. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Sample Preparation:** Sample is placed on a flat, thermally stable surface.
2.  **System Calibration:**  Blackbody calibration of the IR camera.  Calibration of the robotic probe's force sensor.
3.  **Scan Pattern Definition:** User defines scan pattern and parameters (step size, scan speed, heating/cooling power).
4.  **Data Acquisition:** Robotic probe performs localized heating/cooling while the IR camera captures temperature data.  Position and force data are recorded simultaneously.
5.  **Data Processing:** Software calculates thermal conductivity and anisotropy based on the acquired data.  Thermal maps and profiles are generated for visualization and analysis.

**IV. Pseudocode - Thermal Conductivity Calculation:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateThermalConductivity(temperature_map, heater_power, probe_contact_area, sample_thickness):
  //  Simplified 1D Calculation (for demonstration)
  delta_T = temperature_map[heater_location] - temperature_map[cooler_location]
  distance = distance_between(heater_location, cooler_location)
  thermal_resistance = distance / (heater_power * probe_contact_area)
  thermal_conductivity = 1 / (thermal_resistance * sample_thickness)
  RETURN thermal_conductivity
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateAnisotropy(thermal_conductivity_x, thermal_conductivity_y):
  anisotropy_ratio = thermal_conductivity_x / thermal_conductivity_y
  RETURN anisotropy_ratio
END FUNCTION
```

This system allows for high-resolution mapping of thermal conductivity and anisotropy, providing detailed insights into material properties and defect analysis. It’s a shift from point measurements to full-field characterization.
