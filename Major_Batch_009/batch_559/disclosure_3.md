## Dynamic Question Synthesis & Multi-Modal Worker Profiling

**Concept:** Expand the crowdsourcing paradigm beyond simple question/answer pairs. Instead of *asking* a fixed question about decontextualized data, *generate* questions dynamically based on the data itself, and match those questions to workers with demonstrated aptitude *across multiple data modalities* (text, visual, audio).

**Rationale:** The current patent focuses on decontextualizing data *before* presenting it to workers. This approach inherently limits the type of insight that can be gathered. By dynamically creating questions and profiling workers' abilities beyond just textual analysis, we can unlock richer, more nuanced answers and improve the efficiency of the crowdsourcing process.

**Specs:**

**1. Dynamic Question Generator (DQG):**

*   **Input:** Decontextualized dataset (as per patent).
*   **Process:** DQG analyzes the decontextualized data to identify potential "points of interest" – anomalies, correlations, trends, outliers.  It then constructs *multiple* questions targeting these points. Question types include:
    *   **Descriptive:** “What patterns do you observe in this data?” (open-ended)
    *   **Inferential:** “Based on this data, what can you predict about [related variable]?”
    *   **Comparative:** “How does this data segment differ from this other data segment?”
    *   **Hypothetical:** “If [variable] were to change, how would this data be affected?”
*   **Output:** A set of dynamically generated questions, each associated with specific data subsets.  Each question will have an associated 'complexity score' based on the level of inference or analysis required.

**2. Multi-Modal Worker Profiling (MWP):**

*   **Data Collection:** Track worker performance not just on textual question answering, but also on:
    *   **Visual Analysis:** Present workers with visualizations of the data (charts, graphs, heatmaps) and ask them to interpret the visuals.
    *   **Audio Analysis:** Present workers with audio representations of the data (e.g., sonification of time-series data) and ask them to identify patterns or anomalies.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Present workers with abstract patterns and ask them to categorize or identify them.
*   **Profile Creation:**  Build a worker profile that includes:
    *   **Textual Analysis Score:**  Performance on traditional text-based questions.
    *   **Visual Analysis Score:** Performance on visual interpretation tasks.
    *   **Audio Analysis Score:** Performance on audio interpretation tasks.
    *   **Pattern Recognition Score:** Performance on pattern recognition tasks.
    *   **Complexity Preference:**  The level of question complexity the worker prefers.
*   **Data Storage:** Store profiles in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

**3. Matching Engine:**

*   **Input:** Dynamically generated questions (from DQG), worker profiles (from MWP).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Calculate the 'question vector' based on the question's complexity score and the data modalities it targets.
    2.  Search the vector database for workers whose profile vectors are closest to the question vector.
    3.  Prioritize workers who have demonstrated aptitude in the specific data modalities relevant to the question.
    4.  Account for worker availability and historical performance.
*   **Output:** A list of workers best suited to answer the question.

**Pseudocode (Matching Engine):**

```
function matchQuestionToWorkers(question, workerProfiles):
  questionVector = calculateQuestionVector(question)
  rankedWorkers = searchVectorDatabase(questionVector, workerProfiles) //Returns workers sorted by similarity score
  filteredWorkers = filterByAvailability(rankedWorkers) //Remove unavailable workers
  return filteredWorkers
```

**4. Adaptive Learning Loop:**

*   Collect data on worker performance for each question.
*   Update worker profiles to reflect their evolving skills.
*   Refine the question generation process to produce more effective questions.
*   Adjust the matching algorithm to improve the accuracy of worker assignments.
