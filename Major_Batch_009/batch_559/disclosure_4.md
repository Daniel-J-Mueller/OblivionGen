## Temporal Resource Weaving

**Concept:** Extend the reversion capability beyond simple state restoration to allow *concurrent* operation of multiple historical states of a virtual environment. Instead of reverting *to* a state, a new "weave" of the environment is created, branching from the current state and embodying the historical configuration.

**Specs:**

*   **Weave Creation:** Triggered via API call - `create_weave(timestamp/weave_id, environment_id)`. `timestamp` specifies a point in the environment’s history. `weave_id` is a user-defined identifier for the new weave. If `timestamp` is omitted, the current state is used as the base.

*   **Resource Isolation:** Each weave operates with its own isolated set of resources.  This is achieved through a combination of containerization and virtualized resource allocation.  The system creates a snapshot of the environment’s state at the specified `timestamp`, including:
    *   VM images
    *   Network configurations
    *   Data volumes
    *   Metadata (security groups, access policies, etc.)
    *   These are encapsulated into a new "weave container."

*   **Resource Cloning & Delta Management:** Cloning is optimized to avoid full image copying. A delta-based approach records only the changes between the base image and the current state. The “weave container” stores these deltas, applying them to the base image on demand.

*   **Network Namespace Integration:** Each weave receives its own network namespace. Traffic can be routed *to* specific weaves based on weave ID or timestamp, allowing for testing, debugging, or even concurrent operation of different versions of an application.

*   **Data Volume Shadowing:**  Data volumes are shadowed for each weave.  Writes to a volume in one weave do not affect other weaves.  A synchronization mechanism allows for controlled data exchange between weaves.

*   **API Calls:**
    *   `create_weave(timestamp, environment_id)`: Creates a new weave.
    *   `activate_weave(weave_id)`: Switches the active environment to the specified weave.
    *   `list_weaves(environment_id)`: Lists all weaves associated with an environment.
    *   `delete_weave(weave_id)`: Deletes a weave.
    *   `sync_volumes(source_weave_id, destination_weave_id, volume_name)`: Synchronizes data volumes between weaves.
    *   `route_traffic(weave_id, target_port)`: Routes traffic to a specific weave’s port.

*   **Pseudocode (Weave Creation):**
    ```
    function create_weave(timestamp, environment_id):
      snapshot = get_environment_snapshot(environment_id, timestamp)
      weave_id = generate_unique_id()
      weave_container = create_container(weave_id)
      store_snapshot_in_container(weave_container, snapshot)
      create_network_namespace(weave_container)
      configure_network_routing(weave_container)
      return weave_id
    ```

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Debugging:** Recreate a past environment state to diagnose issues.
    *   **Testing:** Run multiple versions of an application concurrently for A/B testing.
    *   **Disaster Recovery:** Quickly revert to a known good state in case of failure.
    *   **Auditing:** Recreate the environment state at a specific point in time for security audits.
    *   **Feature Rollback:** Seamlessly revert to a previous version of an application if a new release introduces problems.
