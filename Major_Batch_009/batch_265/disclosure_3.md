**Core Concept:** A camera system built around a modular core, allowing for interchangeable sensor modules beyond traditional optics, including bio-sensors for environmental or subject data capture.

**Module Specs:**

*   **Core Unit:**
    *   Dimensions: 100mm x 70mm x 40mm (approximate – subject to sensor module sizes).
    *   Material: Lightweight alloy (Magnesium or similar) with textured grip surface.
    *   Connectivity: USB-C (Data/Power), Wireless (Bluetooth 5.2, WiFi 6E), Modular Connector (Proprietary – see below).
    *   Display: 3.5” OLED touchscreen (1920x1080) – bonded to the casing.
    *   Processing: Integrated SoC (Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or equivalent) – 16GB RAM, 512GB Storage.
    *   Power: 5000mAh Battery – Wireless charging capable.

*   **Modular Connector:**
    *   Physical: High-density, multi-pin connector – allowing for power, data, and control signals.
    *   Protocol: Custom protocol – enabling hot-swapping and automatic sensor module recognition.
    *   Locking Mechanism: Magnetic locking system with mechanical failsafe.

*   **Sensor Modules (Examples):**
    *   **Standard Optics Module:** Interchangeable lens mount (Sony E-mount compatible) – with integrated image stabilization.  Sensor: 45MP Full-Frame CMOS sensor.
    *   **Thermal Imaging Module:**  Resolution: 640x512 – LWIR sensor – temperature range: -20°C to +150°C.
    *   **Hyperspectral Imaging Module:**  Spectral range: 400nm – 1000nm – Resolution: 320x240 – Enables material analysis and identification.
    *   **Air Quality Sensor Module:** Measures VOCs, PM2.5, PM10, CO2, temperature, and humidity – data logging and analysis capabilities.
    *   **Bio-Sensor Module (Prototype):**
        *   Non-invasive skin analysis: Measures hydration levels, pH, sebum production, and melanin content.
        *   Sensor Type: Spectroscopy based – utilizes LED arrays and photodiodes.
        *   Data Output:  Real-time skin condition report – integrated with image data for visual analysis.
        *   Sterilization: UV-C sterilization cycle integrated into the module.
        *   Power draw: 5W maximum.

*   **Software:**
    *   Operating System: Android 14 (Custom ROM)
    *   SDK: Open SDK for third-party module development.
    *   Data Fusion Engine: Algorithm for combining data from multiple modules – creating enriched datasets.
    *   AI Integration: Machine learning models for object recognition, scene understanding, and anomaly detection.

**Pseudocode (Data Fusion Example):**

```
FUNCTION fuse_data(image_data, thermal_data, air_quality_data):
  // Input: Image data (RGB), Thermal data (Temperature map), Air Quality data (VOC levels, PM2.5)

  // 1. Align data: Ensure all data sources are spatially aligned.
  aligned_thermal = align_data(thermal_data, image_data)
  aligned_air_quality = align_data(air_quality_data, image_data)

  // 2. Normalize data: Scale all data values to a common range (0-1).
  normalized_thermal = normalize(aligned_thermal)
  normalized_air_quality = normalize(aligned_air_quality)

  // 3. Combine data: Create a multi-channel image.
  multi_channel_image = combine_channels(image_data, normalized_thermal, normalized_air_quality)

  // 4. Apply machine learning model: Use a pre-trained model to analyze the multi-channel image.
  analysis_result = analyze_image(multi_channel_image)

  // 5. Return analysis result.
  RETURN analysis_result
```

**Innovation Rationale:** This modular design moves the camera beyond simple image capture, enabling data collection for a wider range of applications – from environmental monitoring to medical diagnostics. The bio-sensor module is a key differentiator, opening up new possibilities for personalized health and wellness tracking.
