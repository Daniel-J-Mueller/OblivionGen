## Adaptive Content Reconstruction via Distributed Parity

**Concept:** Extend the validation parameter concept to enable *reconstruction* of content fragments across CDN layers, enhancing resilience against corruption beyond simple detection. Instead of just verifying integrity, the system actively repairs compromised data.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Content Segmentation:** Incoming content at origin servers is segmented into fixed-size blocks.
2.  **Redundancy Generation:** For each block, generate N parity blocks. These parity blocks aren't traditional error correction codes (like Reed-Solomon) but are generated using a keyed cryptographic hash. The key is unique to the content and the origin server.
3.  **Distributed Storage:**  Original blocks *and* parity blocks are distributed across multiple CDN layers. Importantly, parity blocks aren't stored contiguously with original blocks. Each layer stores a mix. This prevents a single compromised layer from completely disabling reconstruction.
4.  **Validation Parameter Extension:** The validation parameters *also* include metadata about the segmentation (block size, number of parity blocks, key derivation information) and the distribution map (which layers store which blocks and parity blocks).
5.  **Reconstruction Trigger:** If a content block fails validation at *any* CDN layer, the reconstruction process begins.
6.  **Reconstruction Process:**
    *   The requesting layer queries the validation metadata to determine which other layers possess fragments of the corrupted block.
    *   The layer gathers the necessary original and parity blocks.
    *   Using the validation key (derived from the validation parameters), the layer computes a weighted sum of the gathered blocks (original + parity), effectively reconstructing the missing or corrupted block. The weights are determined by the distribution map and the parity key.
7.  **Dynamic Weighting:** Implement a dynamic weighting scheme that prioritizes blocks from layers with higher uptime and lower latency.
8.  **Key Rotation:** Implement a key rotation schedule to enhance security.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Process):**

```
function reconstructBlock(corruptedBlock, validationParams, distributionMap):
    block_size = validationParams.block_size
    num_parity_blocks = validationParams.num_parity_blocks
    key_derivation_info = validationParams.key_derivation_info
    validation_key = deriveKey(key_derivation_info)

    fragments = []
    for layer in distributionMap:
        if layer.hasFragment(corruptedBlock):
            fragments.append(layer.getFragment(corruptedBlock))

    if len(fragments) < num_parity_blocks + 1:
        // Insufficient fragments for reconstruction
        return error("Insufficient Fragments")

    reconstructedBlock = 0
    for fragment in fragments:
        if fragment.type == "original":
            weight = 1
        else: // fragment.type == "parity"
            weight = 0.5 //Example
        reconstructedBlock += weight * fragment.data

    return reconstructedBlock
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires modifications to CDN software to handle segmentation, parity generation, distribution, and reconstruction.
*   Minimal hardware impact. Increased CPU load for parity calculations.
*   Increased storage requirements due to parity block storage.
*   Secure key management is critical.
