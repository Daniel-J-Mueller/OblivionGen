## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Spatiotemporal Graph Networks

**Concept:** Expand directional separation beyond individual sources to reconstruct the *entire* acoustic scene, creating a navigable, interactive soundscape. This leverages the directional data to build a dynamic 3D representation of sound events.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones, configurable geometry)
*   High-performance computing unit with GPU acceleration.
*   Real-time audio interface.

**II. Software Architecture:**

1.  **Preprocessing Module:**
    *   Input: Raw audio streams from microphone array.
    *   Process: Noise reduction, beamforming (initial directional estimation), frequency analysis (STFT).
    *   Output: Time-frequency representations of the audio, initial directional data.

2.  **Spatiotemporal Graph Network (STGN) Module:**
    *   Input: Time-frequency representations, directional data, timestamps.
    *   Process:
        *   **Node Creation:** Each detected sound event (based on energy thresholds and spectral characteristics) is represented as a node in the graph. Initial node positions are based on estimated direction-of-arrival.
        *   **Edge Creation:** Edges connect nodes representing sound events that are:
            *   **Temporally Coherent:** Occurring within a defined time window.
            *   **Spatially Proximate:** Located within a defined distance threshold (calculated from directional data).
            *   **Acoustically Related:**  Sharing spectral characteristics (cross-correlation of frequency bands).
        *   **Node Feature Vectors:** Each node's feature vector includes:
            *   Spectral centroid, bandwidth, rolloff.
            *   Energy level.
            *   Direction-of-arrival vector (x, y, z).
            *   Temporal position.
        *   **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):** Applied to the graph to:
            *   Refine node positions based on relationships with neighboring nodes.
            *   Predict sound event types (e.g., speech, music, environmental sounds).
            *   Estimate sound source velocities and trajectories.
        *   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Integration:**  RNNs process the temporal sequence of graph states to improve trajectory estimation and predict future sound event locations.

    *   Output: Dynamic 3D graph representing the acoustic scene. Node positions represent sound source locations, and node features represent sound event characteristics.

3.  **Rendering & Interaction Module:**
    *   Input: Dynamic 3D graph from STGN module.
    *   Process:
        *   **Visual Rendering:** Render the graph as a navigable 3D soundscape, using visual cues to represent sound event types and intensities.
        *   **Spatial Audio Rendering:** Generate spatial audio output based on node positions and intensities, creating an immersive auditory experience.
        *   **User Interaction:** Allow users to:
            *   Navigate the 3D soundscape.
            *   Select individual sound events to isolate or analyze.
            *   Filter sound events based on type, intensity, or location.
            *   Reconstruct acoustic scenes from historical data.
    *   Output: Immersive 3D soundscape with interactive capabilities.

**III. Pseudocode (STGN Module - Core Update Logic):**

```pseudocode
// Assume 'graph' is a Spatiotemporal Graph data structure

function update_graph(new_audio_data, current_time):
  // 1. Feature Extraction
  features = extract_features(new_audio_data)

  // 2. Node Creation
  for each feature in features:
    if feature meets detection threshold:
      new_node = create_node(feature, current_time)
      graph.add_node(new_node)

  // 3. Edge Creation & Update
  for each node in graph.nodes:
    for each other_node in graph.nodes:
      if node != other_node:
        if is_temporally_coherent(node, other_node, time_window):
          if is_spatially_proximate(node, other_node, distance_threshold):
            if is_acoustically_related(node, other_node, correlation_threshold):
              graph.add_edge(node, other_node)
              update_edge_weight(node, other_node)

  // 4. Graph Convolutional Network Application
  graph = apply_gcn(graph)

  // 5. RNN Integration
  graph = integrate_rnn(graph)

  return graph
```

**IV. Novelty & Potential Applications:**

This expands beyond source separation to *scene reconstruction*. Potential applications include:

*   **Virtual/Augmented Reality Soundscapes:**  Creating realistic and immersive audio environments.
*   **Security & Surveillance:**  Automated detection and localization of sound events (e.g., gunshots, breaking glass).
*   **Environmental Monitoring:**  Tracking animal vocalizations or identifying sources of noise pollution.
*   **Acoustic Forensics:** Reconstructing audio scenes from limited recordings.
*   **Accessibility:** Creating navigable soundscapes for visually impaired individuals.
