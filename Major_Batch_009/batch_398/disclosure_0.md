## Adaptive JND Masking with Perceptual Region Segmentation

**Concept:** Enhance JND-based compression by dynamically adapting JND thresholds not just to local brightness and variance *within* image blocks, but also to *perceptual regions* identified through a lightweight semantic segmentation process. This aims to preserve detail in areas the human eye is more sensitive to, while aggressively compressing regions of low perceptual importance.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Perceptual Region Segmentation Module:**
    *   Input: Full-resolution image.
    *   Process: Employ a computationally efficient, lightweight semantic segmentation model (e.g., a MobileNetV3-based architecture) trained to identify broad perceptual regions: *Foreground (people, objects of interest)*, *Midground (contextual elements)*, *Background (low detail areas)*.  The model should output a segmentation map – an image where each pixel is labeled with its perceptual region.
    *   Output: Segmentation map.

2.  **Region-Aware JND Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Input: Original image, Segmentation map, base JND threshold matrix.
    *   Process:
        *   For each image block:
            *   Determine the dominant perceptual region within the block (e.g., by averaging the labels of pixels in the block).
            *   Apply a region-specific scaling factor to the base JND thresholds.
                *   Foreground: Scaling factor = 1.2 (increase sensitivity – preserve detail).
                *   Midground: Scaling factor = 1.0 (default).
                *   Background: Scaling factor = 0.7 (reduce sensitivity – aggressive compression).
            *   Calculate modified JND thresholds as: `Modified JND = Base JND * Region Scaling Factor * (Brightness Factor * Variance Factor)`. (Leveraging existing brightness and variance adjustments from the original patent).
    *   Output: Region-aware modified JND threshold matrix.

3.  **Adaptive DCT Compression:**
    *   Input: Image block, Region-aware modified JND threshold matrix.
    *   Process:
        *   Generate DCT matrix for the image block (as in the original patent).
        *   Apply the modified JND thresholds to zero out DCT coefficients below the threshold.
    *   Output: Reduced-complexity DCT matrix.

4.  **Reconstruction:**
    *   Input: Reduced-complexity DCT matrix.
    *   Process: Apply inverse DCT to reconstruct the image block.

**Pseudocode (Core Compression Loop):**

```
FOR each image block IN image:
    segmentation_region = DetermineDominantRegion(image block, segmentation map)
    scaling_factor = GetScalingFactor(segmentation_region)
    brightness_factor = CalculateBrightnessFactor(image block)
    variance_factor = CalculateVarianceFactor(image block)
    modified_jnd = base_jnd * scaling_factor * brightness_factor * variance_factor
    dct_matrix = GenerateDCT(image block)
    reduced_dct = ZeroOutBelowThreshold(dct_matrix, modified_jnd)
    reconstructed_block = InverseDCT(reduced_dct)
    output_image[block coordinates] = reconstructed_block
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Perceptual Quality:**  By prioritizing detail in perceptually important regions, the compressed image should appear more natural and less distorted.
*   **Higher Compression Ratios:**  More aggressive compression can be applied to less important regions without significantly impacting perceived quality.
*   **Adaptability:** The segmentation model can be retrained to focus on different types of content or user preferences.

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Lightweight semantic segmentation model (e.g., MobileNetV3) for real-time performance.
*   GPU acceleration for DCT and inverse DCT operations.
*   Training dataset for the segmentation model, tailored to the target content type.
