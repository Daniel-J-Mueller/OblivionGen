## Adaptive Schema Evolution with Temporal Materialization

**Concept:** Extend the multi-data-store approach to actively manage schema changes *without* downtime or application rewrites. Instead of simply materializing different representations of the *same* data, leverage the materialization nodes to dynamically adapt to schema evolution, creating temporal snapshots and enabling queries against historical data structures.

**Specs:**

1.  **Schema Registry:** A central component that tracks schema versions and transformations. This registry isn't just a passive record; it actively provides translation logic between schema versions.

2.  **Materialization Node Extension:** Each materialization node receives schema evolution updates from the Schema Registry. Nodes maintain *multiple* materializations corresponding to different schema versions, managed as time-series data.

3.  **Write Path Adaptation:** When a write occurs, the Journal Manager tags the transaction with the *current* schema version. Each materialization node, based on its configured materialization strategy, will:
    *   Apply the write to *all* relevant schema versions it maintains. This creates multiple representations of the data, each conforming to a different schema.
    *   Implement a compaction strategy to manage storage. Older schema versions may be compacted or archived to less expensive storage.

4.  **Query Path Adaptation:**
    *   The query parser determines the schema version required by the query (explicitly specified by the application, or inferred from the query's structure).
    *   The query is routed to the appropriate materialization node(s) maintaining the requested schema version.
    *   If a query requires data from *multiple* schema versions, a “schema bridge” (implemented within the materialization node or a dedicated service) performs necessary data transformations.

**Pseudocode (Query Path):**

```
function processQuery(query) {
  requiredSchemaVersion = getRequiredSchemaVersion(query);
  materializationNodes = findMaterializationNodes(requiredSchemaVersion);

  if (materializationNodes.length == 0) {
    //Handle schema not found error
    return error("Schema version not found");
  }

  node = selectMaterializationNode(materializationNodes); //Load balance, proximity, etc.

  if (needsSchemaBridging(query)) {
    bridgedData = schemaBridge(query, node.data);
    return bridgedData;
  } else {
    return node.executeQuery(query);
  }
}

function schemaBridge(query, data) {
  //Translate data from source schema to target schema based on schema definitions
  //This may involve data type conversions, field renames, data enrichment, etc.
  translatedData = transformData(query, data);
  return translatedData;
}
```

**Materialization Strategies Extension:**  Materialization strategies now include rules for:

*   Schema version retention.
*   Compaction/archiving policies.
*   Data transformation logic required for schema bridging.
*   Metadata storage for schema version tracking.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Zero-downtime schema evolution.
*   Historical data analysis without data migration.
*   Simplified application development (no need to handle schema changes).
*   Increased data agility.
