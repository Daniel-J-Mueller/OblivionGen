## Adaptive UI Complexity Scaling

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the complexity of the streamed user interface based on network conditions *and* predicted user cognitive load. This goes beyond simple resolution scaling; it alters the number of elements visible, the fidelity of animations, and the depth of available interactions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Cognitive Load Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: User interaction history (clicks, scrolls, time spent on elements), UI element density in viewport, current task (e.g., form completion, data visualization).
    *   Algorithm: Bayesian network trained on user behavior data correlated with measured cognitive load (e.g., pupil dilation via webcam, if permission granted; keystroke dynamics; response times).  Output:  Cognitive Load Score (0-100).
*   **Network Condition Monitoring:** Standard network latency, bandwidth, and packet loss monitoring. Output: Network Quality Score (0-100).
*   **UI Complexity Levels:**  Predefined UI configurations representing varying levels of complexity. Examples:
    *   **Level 1 (Minimal):**  Core functionality only, text-based, no animations, simplified layouts.
    *   **Level 2 (Basic):**  Standard UI elements, limited animations, moderate layout complexity.
    *   **Level 3 (Enhanced):**  Full UI features, smooth animations, complex layouts, interactive visualizations.
*   **Adaptation Engine:**
    *   Input: Cognitive Load Score, Network Quality Score.
    *   Algorithm:  Fuzzy logic controller. Rules:
        *   IF (Cognitive Load Score > 80 OR Network Quality Score < 20) THEN Set UI Complexity to Level 1.
        *   IF (Cognitive Load Score > 60 AND Network Quality Score < 40) THEN Set UI Complexity to Level 2.
        *   IF (Cognitive Load Score < 40 AND Network Quality Score > 60) THEN Set UI Complexity to Level 3.
        *   Otherwise, maintain current UI Complexity.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Modification:** The backend system should support swapping out entire UI component sets on the fly, allowing for seamless transitions between complexity levels. This implies a modular UI architecture.
*   **Video Stream Encoding:** Adjust video encoding parameters (bitrate, resolution, frame rate) in conjunction with UI complexity to optimize bandwidth usage.  A lower UI complexity level should be paired with a lower video encoding bitrate.
*   **Pseudocode (Adaptation Engine):**

```
function adaptUI(cognitiveLoad, networkQuality):
  if cognitiveLoad > 80 or networkQuality < 20:
    setUIComplexity(1)
  elif cognitiveLoad > 60 and networkQuality < 40:
    setUIComplexity(2)
  elif cognitiveLoad < 40 and networkQuality > 60:
    setUIComplexity(3)
  else:
    maintainCurrentUIComplexity()

function setUIComplexity(level):
  swapUIComponentSet(level)
  adjustVideoEncoding(level)

```

*   **Extension:** Provide user control over adaptation settings (e.g., prioritize network stability over UI fidelity, disable cognitive load prediction).
