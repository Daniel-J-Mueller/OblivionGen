## Adaptive Proximity Broadcasting with Intent Prediction

**Concept:** Extend location-based service zone monitoring to proactively broadcast relevant information *before* a user enters a zone, based on predicted intent derived from movement patterns and historical data. This moves beyond reactive monitoring to anticipatory assistance.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time device location (GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
    *   Movement history (speed, direction, frequent routes, dwell times).
    *   User profile (preferences, past interactions, demographic data - optional/permissioned).
    *   POI (Point of Interest) database with associated content (offers, information, services).
    *   Crowdsourced data (real-time events, congestion, local news).
*   **Intent Prediction Module:**
    *   Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on movement history to predict likely destinations or activities.  The LSTM will ingest a sequence of location data points (timestamp, latitude, longitude, speed, bearing) to forecast the next likely location or activity.
    *   Weighted scoring system for destinations.  Scoring factors include:
        *   Proximity (distance to potential destination).
        *   Frequency of past visits.
        *   Time of day/week (patterns).
        *   Current speed/direction (momentum).
        *   Crowdsourced event proximity (e.g., concert, sale).
    *   Confidence threshold for intent prediction.  If confidence is low, the system defaults to broader broadcasting.
*   **Proximity Broadcasting Module:**
    *   Defines "broadcast zones" around POIs, larger than standard monitoring zones.
    *   Based on predicted intent and the user’s proximity to a broadcast zone, pre-fetch and prepare relevant content (offers, directions, information).
    *   Content delivery triggered *before* entering the standard monitoring zone, presented via:
        *   Push notifications (user-configurable).
        *   Heads-up display integration (AR/VR capable devices).
        *   In-car infotainment system integration.
*   **Adaptive Broadcast Radius:**
    *   Dynamically adjusts broadcast radius based on:
        *   Speed of the device (faster speeds = larger radius).
        *   Predicted intent confidence (higher confidence = smaller radius).
        *   Road network topology (consider potential routes).
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All data collection and processing must be opt-in and adhere to strict privacy policies.
    *   Data anonymization and aggregation techniques should be used where possible.
    *   Users should have full control over their data and the ability to disable or customize the system.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction):**

```
function predict_intent(location_history, user_profile, poi_database):
    # Input: Sequence of location data, user preferences, POI information
    # Output: Predicted destination/activity with confidence score

    # 1. Feature extraction from location history:
    features = extract_features(location_history) # e.g., speed, direction, dwell time, frequent routes

    # 2. Combine features with user profile and POI data
    combined_features = combine_features(features, user_profile, poi_database)

    # 3. LSTM network prediction
    prediction, confidence = LSTM_network.predict(combined_features)

    # 4. Refine prediction with contextual information (e.g., time of day, events)
    refined_prediction = refine_prediction(prediction, time_of_day, events)

    return refined_prediction, confidence
