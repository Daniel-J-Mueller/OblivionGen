## Adaptive Thermal Mapping with Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing

**Concept:** Implement a real-time, high-resolution thermal map of the battery pack using distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) in conjunction with the existing thermistor-based system. This moves beyond point-sensing to continuous surface temperature monitoring.

**Specifications:**

*   **Fiber Optic Cable:** Deploy a thin, flexible fiber optic cable woven throughout the battery pack, running alongside and between battery cells. Cable should be coated with a thermally conductive, electrically insulating material. Cable diameter: <1mm.
*   **DFOS Interrogator:** Utilize a DFOS interrogator unit capable of measuring temperature distribution along the fiber optic cable with a spatial resolution of <5mm. Data acquisition rate: >10Hz.
*   **Thermistor Integration:** Retain the existing thermistor network as a redundant safety layer. Cross-reference DFOS data with thermistor readings. Significant discrepancies trigger immediate alerts.
*   **Thermal Gradient Mapping:**  DFOS data will be processed to generate a 2D/3D thermal map of the battery pack. Software will highlight areas of rapid temperature increase, thermal gradients, and potential hotspots.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Implement a machine learning algorithm to predict thermal runaway based on historical data and real-time thermal mapping. The algorithm will learn the thermal signatures of healthy and failing cells.
*   **Cooling System Control:** Integrate the thermal map with the battery pack's cooling system (if present). The system will dynamically adjust cooling airflow or liquid coolant distribution to target hotspots and maintain optimal temperature distribution.
*   **Data Communication:** Utilize a high-speed communication protocol (e.g., CAN bus, Ethernet) to transmit thermal map data and alerts to the battery management system (BMS) and external monitoring systems.
*   **Calibration:** Implement a calibration procedure to ensure accurate temperature readings from the DFOS system. Calibration should account for variations in fiber optic cable properties and environmental factors.
*   **Redundancy:** Implement a secondary DFOS interrogator for redundancy. Automatic switchover in case of primary interrogator failure.
*   **Encapsulation:** Completely encapsulate the fiber optic cable to protect it from mechanical damage, moisture, and corrosive materials within the battery pack environment.

**Pseudocode (Thermal Runaway Prediction):**

```
// Input: Thermal map data (2D array of temperatures)
//        Historical data (database of thermal signatures)

function predictThermalRunaway(thermalMap, historicalData) {

    // 1. Feature Extraction:
    maxTemperature = findMaxTemperature(thermalMap);
    averageTemperature = calculateAverageTemperature(thermalMap);
    temperatureGradient = calculateTemperatureGradient(thermalMap);
    hotspotArea = identifyHotspotArea(thermalMap);

    // 2. Data Preprocessing:
    features = [maxTemperature, averageTemperature, temperatureGradient, hotspotArea];
    normalizedFeatures = normalize(features);

    // 3. Machine Learning Model:
    model = loadPretrainedModel(historicalData); // e.g., Random Forest, SVM

    // 4. Prediction:
    riskScore = model.predict(normalizedFeatures);

    // 5. Thresholding:
    if (riskScore > threshold) {
        return "Thermal Runaway Imminent";
    } else {
        return "Normal Operation";
    }
}
