## Adaptive Data Stream Fusion & Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the edge device’s data handling capabilities beyond simple selection and export to include real-time fusion of multiple data streams *before* export, weighted by dynamic prioritization and predictive analytics. This allows for the creation of richer, more actionable insights at the edge, reducing bandwidth needs and improving response times.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Stream Metadata Profile:**

*   Each incoming data stream must be associated with a dynamic metadata profile. This profile contains:
    *   **Data Type:** (e.g., sensor reading, video frame, text message).
    *   **Priority Weight:**  A numerical value (0.0-1.0) indicating the stream’s importance. Initially set by configuration, but dynamically adjusted (see Section 3).
    *   **Data Fusion Rules:** A set of instructions detailing how this stream can be combined with other streams (e.g., average, max, concatenate, timestamp correlation). These are configurable templates.
    *   **Expected Data Rate:** Estimate of the average data volume per unit time.
    *   **Data Loss Tolerance:** Acceptable percentage of data loss without impacting overall application functionality.
*   Metadata is stored in a dedicated, lightweight database on the edge device.

**2. Fusion Engine:**

*   A modular engine responsible for combining data streams according to defined fusion rules.
*   Supports various fusion operations:
    *   **Averaging:** Calculate the average value of numerical data from multiple streams.
    *   **Max/Min:** Identify the maximum or minimum value across streams.
    *   **Concatenation:** Combine textual or string data from multiple streams.
    *   **Timestamp Correlation:** Align data based on timestamps, filling gaps using interpolation or extrapolation.
    *   **Feature Extraction:** (Advanced) Apply basic machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful features from data streams (e.g., identifying anomalies, detecting patterns).
*   The Fusion Engine operates asynchronously, processing data streams in parallel.
*   Supports configurable sampling rates for each stream, allowing for selective data reduction.

**3. Dynamic Prioritization Algorithm:**

*   The prioritization algorithm continuously adjusts the priority weights of data streams based on:
    *   **Real-Time Data Quality:** Assess data stream health (e.g., packet loss, latency).  Streams with poor quality are temporarily down-weighted.
    *   **Predictive Analytics:** Utilize a simple predictive model (e.g., moving average, exponential smoothing) to forecast future data demand. Streams predicted to be most relevant in the near future are up-weighted.
    *   **Application Feedback:** The target service can provide feedback on data relevance.  If a stream is consistently ignored, its priority is lowered.
*   Prioritization updates are performed at configurable intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds).

**4. Export Scheduler:**

*   The Export Scheduler manages the flow of fused data to the remote network.
*   Prioritizes data streams based on their dynamic priority weights.
*   Implements configurable batching and compression to reduce bandwidth usage.
*   Supports multiple export destinations.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Prioritization Update):**

```
function updatePriorities(dataStreamMetadata, dataQualityMetrics, predictedDemand, applicationFeedback):
  for each dataStream in dataStreamMetadata:
    // Calculate a base score based on historical priority
    priorityScore = dataStream.priorityWeight

    // Adjust score based on data quality
    priorityScore += dataQualityMetrics[dataStream.id] * 0.2 //Weight of 0.2 means data quality can contribute 20% of final score

    // Adjust score based on predictive demand
    priorityScore += predictedDemand[dataStream.id] * 0.3 //Predictive demand accounts for 30% of final score

    // Adjust score based on application feedback
    priorityScore += applicationFeedback[dataStream.id] * 0.1 //Feedback contributes 10%

    // Normalize score to ensure it stays within the 0.0-1.0 range
    dataStream.priorityWeight = clamp(priorityScore, 0.0, 1.0)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge device with sufficient processing power and memory to handle data fusion and prioritization.
*   High-bandwidth network connection to the remote network.
*   Secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).
