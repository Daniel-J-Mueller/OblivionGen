## Dynamic Item "Futurecasting" & Pre-emptive Substitution

**Concept:** Leveraging delivery speed selection, location data, and purchase history to *predict* potential item unavailability and proactively suggest substitutions *before* the user adds the item to their cart, increasing conversion rates and customer satisfaction. This goes beyond simply reacting to out-of-stock situations – it anticipates them.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing Layer:**

*   **Input:** User location (GPS, triangulation, WiFi), User account data (purchase history, saved addresses, subscription status), Real-time inventory data (all warehouses/stores), Historical sales data (item popularity by location/time), Delivery speed selection.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **"Availability Risk Score" Calculation:**  For each item a user is browsing, calculate a risk score based on:
        *   Current inventory levels at warehouses serving the user’s location.
        *   Historical sales velocity of the item in that location.
        *   Projected delivery time based on selected speed option.
        *   External factors (weather, holidays, known supply chain disruptions).
        *   User's past purchase patterns (likelihood to buy this item).
    *   **"Substitution Candidate" Identification:**  Identify potential substitute items based on:
        *   Item attributes (category, price, features).
        *   User's past purchases and browsing history.
        *   Items frequently purchased together.
        *   Current inventory levels of substitutes.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of "Substitution Candidates" with associated "Availability Risk Scores".

**2.  Client-Side Integration:**

*   **Real-time Item Overlay:** As the user browses, a subtle overlay appears on items with a high "Availability Risk Score".
*   **Proactive Substitution Suggestion:**  Instead of simply displaying “Out of Stock” *after* selection, the system *proactively* suggests the highest-ranked “Substitution Candidate” *before* the user adds the item to their cart. This is presented as a “Consider this alternative” type message.
*   **Visual Indicators:**  Use color-coding or icons to indicate the “Availability Risk Level” (e.g., green = low risk, yellow = moderate risk, red = high risk).
*   **"Future Availability" Display:** If possible, display an estimated time when the original item will be back in stock (based on inventory replenishment schedules).

**3. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Server-Side
function calculateAvailabilityRisk(itemId, userLocation, deliverySpeed) {
  inventoryData = getInventoryData(itemId, userLocation)
  salesVelocity = getHistoricalSalesVelocity(itemId, userLocation)
  deliveryTime = calculateDeliveryTime(userLocation, deliverySpeed)
  riskScore = (lowInventoryScore * inventoryData) + (highSalesScore * salesVelocity) + (longDeliveryScore * deliveryTime)
  return riskScore
}

function identifySubstitutionCandidates(itemId, userHistory) {
  candidates = queryDatabase(itemId, userHistory) // Attributes, purchase history, frequently bought together
  sortedCandidates = sortCandidates(candidates, inventoryLevel)
  return sortedCandidates
}

// Client-Side
onItemBrowse(itemId) {
  riskScore = callServer(calculateAvailabilityRisk, itemId)
  if (riskScore > threshold) {
    substitutionCandidates = callServer(identifySubstitutionCandidates, itemId)
    displayProactiveSubstitution(substitutionCandidates)
  }
}
```

**4.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adapt the "Availability Risk Score" threshold based on user preferences (e.g., frequent shoppers may have a lower threshold).
*   **Personalized Substitution Rankings:**  Rank substitution candidates based on the user's individual purchase history and browsing behavior.
*   **"Reserve Now" Option:** Allow users to "reserve" a substitution candidate if they are unsure about the original item.
*   **Gamification:** Award users points or badges for proactively selecting substitution candidates.
