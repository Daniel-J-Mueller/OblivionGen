## Dynamic Preference Weighting via Biometric Feedback

**Concept:** Augment pairwise comparison data with real-time biometric feedback from users to dynamically weight preferences, moving beyond aggregated historical data to personalized, contextualized comparisons.

**Specification:**

1.  **Biometric Data Acquisition:** Integrate wearable sensor data (heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, pupil dilation, facial muscle activity – microexpressions) during item viewing and selection. Data acquisition should be passive and minimally intrusive. Prior user consent is required, with options to opt-out at any time.

2.  **Session Mapping:** Correlate biometric data streams with specific user sessions within the existing data mining system. This requires a robust session ID mechanism and timestamp synchronization.

3.  **Real-Time Preference Score Calculation:**
    *   Establish baseline biometric signatures for neutral/passive viewing states.
    *   Develop algorithms to detect ‘engagement’ signals – increased heart rate, skin conductance, pupillary response – associated with item viewing.
    *   Detect ‘preference’ signals - microexpressions indicative of positive or negative affect during item consideration.
    *   Combine engagement and preference signals to generate a real-time ‘preference score’ for each item viewed.

4.  **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   The existing pairwise comparison system calculates a percentage based on historical selections.
    *   The dynamic weighting algorithm modulates this percentage *in real-time* based on the user’s current preference score for each item.
    *   Pseudocode:

    ```
    function calculate_weighted_comparison(historical_percentage, user_preference_score_item_A, user_preference_score_item_B, weighting_factor) {
      // Normalize preference scores to a 0-1 range
      normalized_score_A = (user_preference_score_A - min_score) / (max_score - min_score);
      normalized_score_B = (user_preference_score_B - min_score) / (max_score - min_score);

      // Calculate adjustment factor
      adjustment_factor = (normalized_score_A - normalized_score_B) * weighting_factor;

      // Apply adjustment to historical percentage
      weighted_percentage = historical_percentage + adjustment_factor;

      // Ensure percentage remains within 0-100 range
      weighted_percentage = constrain(weighted_percentage, 0, 100);

      return weighted_percentage;
    }
    ```

    *   `weighting_factor` is a configurable parameter that controls the influence of real-time data versus historical data.

5.  **Personalized Display:**
    *   Instead of displaying a static percentage, display a *dynamic* percentage that updates in real-time as the user views the items.
    *   Consider visual cues (e.g., a shifting balance scale, color gradients) to represent the dynamic comparison.
    *   The system should also provide a ‘confidence level’ indicator reflecting the reliability of the real-time data (based on signal strength, session duration, etc.).

6.  **System Architecture Integration:**
    *   A new module, "Real-Time Preference Engine," will be integrated into the existing data mining and server systems.
    *   This module will be responsible for biometric data acquisition, processing, preference score calculation, and dynamic weighting.
    *   API integration with the existing server system to dynamically update displayed comparison data.

7.  **Data Storage:**
    *   Store anonymized biometric data (processed preference scores, not raw signals) alongside existing user activity data.
    *   This data can be used to refine preference score algorithms and improve the accuracy of dynamic comparisons over time.

**Potential Applications:**

*   E-commerce: Dynamically personalize product recommendations and highlight products that align with a user's immediate emotional response.
*   Travel Planning: Suggest travel destinations that resonate with a user's current mood and preferences.
*   Social Networking:  Recommend content and connections that are likely to be engaging based on real-time biometric feedback.
*   Job Recruitment: Assess candidate fit by analyzing biometric responses to job descriptions and interview questions.
