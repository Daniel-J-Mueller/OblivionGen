## Dynamic Reputation Propagation Network

**Concept:** Extend the risk scoring beyond individual accounts and requests to create a dynamic, propagating reputation network. Instead of solely focusing on factors *of* the request, incorporate a "social" element – the reputation of accounts interacting with each other. This is analogous to a credit score system, but far more granular and real-time.

**Specifications:**

*   **Reputation Nodes:** Each customer account, and potentially even computing resources, becomes a node in a graph database (Neo4j preferred).
*   **Interaction Edges:**  Every interaction between nodes (request submission, data access, etc.) creates a weighted edge. Weighting is based on the type of interaction, the data involved, and the initial risk score of the request.
*   **Reputation Score Calculation:** Each node’s reputation score is calculated using a PageRank-like algorithm adapted for risk.  Nodes with high "trust" (low risk) contribute positively to the reputation of nodes they interact with.  Nodes with low "trust" (high risk) negatively impact the reputation of interacting nodes. This occurs in near-real-time.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  Weights on edges *decay* over time, representing the diminishing impact of past interactions.  Furthermore, successful mitigations (e.g., blocking a fraudulent request) increase the weight of the edge *from* the mitigated account, reinforcing its positive reputation.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** The network is constantly monitored for anomalies in reputation propagation.  Sudden shifts in a node’s reputation, or unusual patterns of interaction, trigger alerts.
*   **Cascading Risk Assessment:** When a new request is received, the system not only calculates a risk score based on the request itself, but also propagates the risk scores of interacting accounts. This means the risk score of a request is influenced by the reputation of *all* accounts involved in the transaction.
*   **Mitigation Feedback Loop:** When a mitigation action is taken, the system analyzes the network to identify accounts that were potentially complicit in the fraudulent activity.  This information is used to update the reputation scores of those accounts and refine the risk assessment algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Risk Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateOverallRiskScore(request, interactingAccounts):
  requestRiskScore = calculateInitialRiskScore(request) // Based on factors in the patent
  propagatedRiskScore = 0

  for each account in interactingAccounts:
    accountReputationScore = getAccountReputationScore(account)
    propagatedRiskScore += accountReputationScore * weightFactor // weightFactor based on interaction type

  overallRiskScore = requestRiskScore + propagatedRiskScore

  return overallRiskScore
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Account Node:** {accountID, reputationScore, lastUpdatedTimestamp, interactionHistory}
*   **Interaction Edge:** {sourceAccountID, destinationAccountID, interactionType, weight, timestamp}

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability is critical. The graph database must be able to handle millions of nodes and edges.
*   Real-time processing is essential. Updates to reputation scores must be propagated quickly.
*   The system must be resilient to attacks.  Malicious actors could attempt to manipulate the reputation network.
