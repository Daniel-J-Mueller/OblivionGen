**Dynamic Content 'Echo' & Predictive Annotation**

**Concept:** Expand upon the automatic quote generation by introducing a 'content echo' feature alongside predictive annotation. This moves beyond simply *selecting* existing content to dynamically generating related, supporting passages and proactively suggesting annotations *before* the user explicitly requests them.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** ‘Echo Engine’ – An AI model trained on the content source (e.g., a library of e-books, articles, research papers). This engine identifies semantically related passages based on user reading/interaction.
*   **Trigger:** Activation upon user highlighting/selecting text, or after a defined pause on a specific passage.
*   **Echo Output:**  A panel displaying 3-5 short passages, ranked by relevance, demonstrating supporting arguments, contrasting viewpoints, or historical context to the selected text.  Each passage is sourced and linked back to its origin.
*   **Annotation Prediction:** Based on user reading patterns & the ‘Echo Engine’s’ analysis, the system proactively suggests potential annotations (e.g., “This passage supports the main argument,” “Consider the author’s bias,” “Compare this to X”). These are presented as unobtrusive prompts.
*   **Adaptive Sensitivity:** User control over the sensitivity of ‘Echo’ & annotation prediction. Options include: ‘Off’, ‘Low’ (minimal suggestions), ‘Medium’ (balanced), ‘High’ (aggressive suggestions).
*   **Personalized Echo:** The engine learns user preferences over time, prioritizing sources and viewpoints that align with their reading history.
*   **Multi-Modal Echo:** Extend beyond text to include relevant images, videos, or audio clips (if available).
*   **Integration with existing Quote Generation:** Seamless integration. Users can easily incorporate ‘Echo’ passages into generated quotes.

**Pseudocode (Echo Engine):**

```
function generateEcho(selectedText, userHistory, contentSource):
  // 1. Semantic Analysis of selectedText
  keywords = extractKeywords(selectedText)
  // 2. Query contentSource based on keywords + userHistory
  relevantPassages = contentSource.search(keywords, userHistory)
  // 3. Rank passages by relevance score
  rankedPassages = rankPassages(relevantPassages)
  // 4. Return top N ranked passages
  return rankedPassages[0:N]

function rankPassages(passages):
  // Scoring based on:
  // - Semantic similarity to selectedText
  // - Recency of passage (newer content preferred)
  // - User engagement with source (past reads/annotations)
  // - Diversity of viewpoint (avoiding echo chambers)
  // Return a sorted list of passages based on score
  return sorted(passages, key=scoreFunction)
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   Requires a robust semantic search engine.
*   Significant computational resources for real-time analysis.
*   Data privacy considerations (user reading history).
*   User interface design to avoid information overload.
*   Potential for integration with external knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia).
