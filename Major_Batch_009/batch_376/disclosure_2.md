## Predictive Order Bundling & Dynamic Pricing

**Specification:** A system to proactively bundle anticipated repeat orders based on user behavior and dynamically adjust pricing to incentivize bundling, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing order value.

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond duplicate order *detection* to duplicate order *prediction* and proactively offer bundled pricing. The patent focuses on reactive handling of duplicates. This moves to a predictive, proactive model.

**System Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Analysis Engine:**  Continuously analyzes user order history (frequency, items, quantities, time of day, day of week).  Utilizes time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) and sequence mining (e.g., association rule learning) to predict likely repeat orders *before* the user initiates them.  This engine assigns a "Repeat Probability Score" to each item in a user's potential future order.

2.  **Bundling Algorithm:** Based on the Repeat Probability Scores, the algorithm identifies items likely to be ordered together within a specific timeframe (e.g., next 7 days).  It then creates potential bundles, ranking them based on estimated fulfillment cost savings (fewer shipments) and projected increase in average order value.  Bundle composition considers logical groupings (e.g., consumables, related products).

3.  **Dynamic Pricing Module:** Adjusts pricing for bundled items based on demand, inventory levels, and fulfillment cost. Offers discounts for purchasing bundles compared to individual items. Employs reinforcement learning to optimize pricing strategies and maximize profitability.

4.  **User Interface (UI) Component:**  Displays personalized bundle recommendations to the user during browsing or on the account dashboard.  Includes clear pricing comparisons between bundles and individual items.  Provides options for customizing bundles (e.g., adding or removing items).  Uses predictive text and auto-completion to streamline bundle creation.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Recommendation):**

```
function recommendBundles(userID):
  orderHistory = getOrderHistory(userID)
  predictedOrders = analyzeOrderHistory(orderHistory) // Time-series & sequence mining
  potentialBundles = createPotentialBundles(predictedOrders)
  rankedBundles = rankBundlesByProfit(potentialBundles) // Consider fulfillment costs
  displayBundles(userID, rankedBundles) // Show to user via UI
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Order:** {orderID, userID, items[], orderDate, totalAmount}
*   **Item:** {itemID, itemName, itemCategory, itemPrice}
*   **Bundle:** {bundleID, userID, items[], bundlePrice, discount}
*   **RepeatProbabilityScore:** {itemID, userID, probability}

**Implementation Details:**

*   Utilize cloud-based machine learning platforms (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform) for model training and deployment.
*   Implement a real-time event streaming architecture (e.g., Apache Kafka) to process order data and update predictive models.
*   Integrate with existing order management and fulfillment systems.
*   A/B test different bundle compositions and pricing strategies to optimize performance.
*   Incorporate user feedback to refine bundle recommendations and improve the overall experience.

**Novelty:**  This expands beyond simply flagging duplicates to *proactively* shaping the ordering process. It aims to create predictable demand, optimize fulfillment, and increase revenue through a personalized, predictive bundling system. The patent works *after* an order is placed, this predicts *before* and proactively impacts behavior.
