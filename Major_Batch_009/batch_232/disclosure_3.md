## Adaptive Proximity Marketing & Dynamic Pricing Beacon System

**Concept:** Expand the location-based functionality into a highly localized, dynamic pricing and product recommendation system using Bluetooth beacons combined with the portable electronic device’s existing capabilities. This creates an “intelligent storefront” experience even *before* the user enters a physical store.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Bluetooth Beacon Network:** Strategically placed low-energy Bluetooth beacons throughout a retail space (or even broader areas like malls or city centers). Each beacon transmits a unique identifier and signal strength.
*   **Portable Electronic Device (PED):** (As described in the patent, possessing GPS, electronic display, wireless transceiver, processor, memory).
*   **Retail Server:** Existing server infrastructure, expanded to manage beacon data, pricing rules, and product recommendations.

**Software/Firmware Specifications:**

1.  **Beacon Detection Module (PED):**
    *   Continuously scans for Bluetooth beacon signals.
    *   Calculates signal strength (RSSI) from each detected beacon.
    *   Uses RSSI to estimate distance to each beacon (triangulation possible with multiple beacons).
    *   Transmits beacon IDs and estimated distances to the Retail Server.

2.  **Dynamic Pricing & Recommendation Engine (Retail Server):**
    *   Maintains a database of products, prices, and associated beacons.
    *   Defines pricing rules based on:
        *   User’s proximity to a beacon (e.g., closer = lower price).
        *   Time of day/day of week.
        *   Inventory levels.
        *   User purchase history (if available).
    *   Generates personalized product recommendations based on location, history, and current offers.

3.  **PED Display & Transaction Module:**
    *   Receives dynamic pricing and recommendation data from the Retail Server.
    *   Displays personalized offers on the electronic display, highlighting products near the user.
    *   Generates machine-readable codes (QR, barcodes) representing the discounted price or special offer.
    *   Facilitates a streamlined transaction at checkout:
        *   Upon scanning the machine-readable code, the POS system automatically applies the dynamic price.
        *   Payment can be integrated via existing mobile payment solutions.

**Pseudocode (PED – Beacon Detection & Data Transmission):**

```
LOOP:
    scanForBluetoothBeacons()
    beaconList = getDetectedBeacons()

    FOR EACH beacon IN beaconList:
        distance = calculateDistance(beacon.RSSI)
        beaconData.id = beacon.id
        beaconData.distance = distance
        beaconData.timestamp = currentTime()
        transmitDataToServer(beaconData)
    END FOR

    sleep(1 second)
END LOOP
```

**Pseudocode (Retail Server – Dynamic Pricing Logic):**

```
FUNCTION calculatePrice(productId, beaconId, userId):
    product = getProductDetails(productId)
    basePrice = product.price
    distance = getBeaconDistance(beaconId)

    IF distance < 2 meters:
        discount = 0.10 // 10% discount
    ELSE IF distance < 5 meters:
        discount = 0.05 // 5% discount
    ELSE:
        discount = 0.00 // No discount

    IF userHasPurchased(userId, productId):
        discount += 0.02 // Additional 2% discount for repeat purchases

    finalPrice = basePrice * (1 - discount)
    RETURN finalPrice
END FUNCTION
```

**Innovation Highlights:**

*   **Hyper-localized pricing:** Prices dynamically adjust based on the user’s *precise* location within the store.
*   **Proactive recommendations:** Push relevant offers to users *before* they even browse, increasing impulse purchases.
*   **Seamless checkout:** Machine-readable codes simplify the transaction process.
*   **Data-driven insights:**  Gather data on user movement and preferences to optimize store layout and product placement.
*   **Scalability:** Beacon network can be easily expanded to cover larger areas.
