## Decentralized Certificate Authority Orchestration via Sovereign Identity

**Concept:** Extend the existing certificate management system by integrating with decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credential (VC) technologies, enabling a system where entities *own* their certificates and can selectively share them without reliance on a central authority, even for private CAs. This moves beyond simply managing certificates *for* entities, to enabling entities to *manage* certificates themselves, interoperating with a wider ecosystem.

**Specs:**

**1. DID Integration Module:**

*   **Function:**  Handles the creation and management of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for entities within the system (clients, servers, applications).  Supports multiple DID methods (e.g., Key DID, ED25519).
*   **API:**
    *   `createDID(entityName, keyMaterial)`:  Generates a DID and associated key pair.  Returns DID document.
    *   `resolveDID(did)`:  Retrieves DID document.
    *   `updateDIDDocument(did, didDocument)`: Updates the DID document (e.g., adding service endpoints).
*   **Data Store:** Stores DID documents (JSON-LD format).

**2. Verifiable Credential (VC) Generation & Management:**

*   **Function:**  Allows the creation and issuance of VCs representing certificates.  The issuer is the private or public CA provisioned by the system. The holder is the entity receiving the certificate.
*   **VC Schema:**
    *   `@context`: JSON-LD context for VC specification.
    *   `type`:  "VerifiableCredential"
    *   `issuer`: DID of the CA.
    *   `credentialSubject`:  Information about the certificate holder (e.g., entity name, server address).
    *   `credentialSchema`: URI pointing to the certificate schema (defines the structure and data types).
    *   `validUntil`: Expiration date of the certificate.
    *   `certificate`: Base64 encoded certificate data (e.g., X.509).
*   **API:**
    *   `issueVC(certificate, holderDID)`: Creates a VC from the provided certificate and holder's DID. Signs the VC with the CAâ€™s private key. Returns the signed VC.
    *   `verifyVC(vc)`: Verifies the signature and claims within the VC. Returns true/false.
    *   `revokeVC(vc)`:  Records the VC as revoked using a revocation list or status list.

**3. Selective Disclosure Engine:**

*   **Function:** Enables entities to selectively disclose specific attributes from their VCs without revealing the entire certificate.
*   **Mechanism:** Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).  Specifically, utilize Schnorr proofs or Sigma protocols.
*   **API:**
    *   `createProof(vc, requestedAttributes)`: Generates a ZKP proving ownership of the requested attributes within the VC without revealing the underlying data.
    *   `verifyProof(proof, verifierPublicKey)`: Verifies the ZKP.

**4.  Certificate Management API Enhancements:**

*   **`requestCertificate(entityDID, certificateType, parameters)`:** Entity requests a certificate using its DID.
*   **`retrieveCertificate(entityDID)`:** Entity retrieves its certificate (as a VC) using its DID.
*   **`presentCertificate(entityDID, relyingPartyDID)`:**  Entity presents a certificate to a relying party, potentially using a ZKP for selective disclosure.

**Pseudocode (Present Certificate Flow):**

```
function presentCertificate(entityDID, relyingPartyDID) {
  // 1. Entity requests certificate VC.
  certificateVC = retrieveCertificate(entityDID);

  // 2. Relying Party requests specific attributes.
  requestedAttributes = relyingParty.getRequestedAttributes();

  // 3. If selective disclosure is required:
  if (selectiveDisclosureEnabled) {
    // 4. Generate ZKP proving ownership of requested attributes.
    proof = createProof(certificateVC, requestedAttributes);
    // 5. Send proof to Relying Party.
    relyingParty.receiveProof(proof);
    // 6. Relying Party verifies the proof.
    relyingParty.verifyProof(proof);
  } else {
    // 7. Send the entire certificate VC to the Relying Party.
    relyingParty.receiveVC(certificateVC);
    // 8. Relying Party verifies the VC.
    relyingParty.verifyVC(certificateVC);
  }

  // 9. Access granted or denied based on verification result.
}
```

**Data Store Requirements:**

*   DID Documents
*   Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
*   Revocation Lists/Status Lists
*   VC Schemas

This system empowers entities with greater control over their digital identities and certificates, fostering trust and interoperability in a decentralized environment. The integration of ZKPs allows for privacy-preserving attribute disclosure, further enhancing security and user control.
