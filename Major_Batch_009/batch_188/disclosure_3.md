## Dynamic Federated Token Lifespan & Trust Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the federated token concept to incorporate a dynamic lifespan and a trust propagation mechanism based on service interaction history. This builds upon the patent’s secure authentication but allows for granular access control that adapts to real-time behavior.

**Specification:**

**1. Token Structure Enhancement:**

*   **Original:** Federated Token (static credential)
*   **New:** Dynamic Federated Token (DFT) – includes:
    *   Token ID
    *   Issuing Cluster ID
    *   Target Service ID(s) – list of services the token grants access to.
    *   Initial Validity Period – time window the token is valid.
    *   Usage Count – number of times the token has been successfully used.
    *   Trust Score – initial value based on the issuing cluster's reputation.
    *   Decay Rate – a parameter dictating how quickly the Trust Score degrades over time and/or with usage.
    *   Signature – cryptographic signature to ensure token integrity.

**2. Trust Score Calculation & Propagation:**

*   **Initial Trust:**  Assigned to the issuing cluster based on a pre-defined reputation system (e.g., service uptime, security audits, history of legitimate requests).
*   **Real-Time Adjustment:**
    *   **Successful Access:**  Each successful access to a target service *slightly increases* the Trust Score.
    *   **Failed Access:** Each failed access attempt (due to invalid data, permission issues, etc.) *significantly decreases* the Trust Score.
    *   **Service Feedback:** Target services can *actively report* anomalies or suspicious activity related to a specific DFT to a central trust authority.  This feedback directly impacts the DFT's Trust Score.
    *   **Decay:** The Trust Score naturally decays over time according to the Decay Rate.

**3.  Dynamic Validity Period:**

*   The token’s validity period is *not fixed*. Instead, it is dynamically adjusted based on the DFT’s Trust Score.
*   **High Trust Score:**  Longer validity period, allowing for seamless access.
*   **Low Trust Score:** Shortened validity period, forcing more frequent re-authentication/re-authorization.  This introduces a friction element to discourage malicious behavior.
*   **Thresholds:** Define specific Trust Score thresholds that trigger changes in validity period.

**4.  Implementation Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Service A (Issuing Cluster) requests token for Service B
function requestDynamicToken(serviceBId) {
  token = createDynamicToken(serviceBId);
  signToken(token);
  return token;
}

// Service B (Target Service) validates token
function validateDynamicToken(token) {
  if (signatureValid(token)) {
    currentTime = getCurrentTime();
    if (currentTime < token.validUntil) {
      //Check trust score
      if (token.trustScore > threshold) {
        //Access Granted
        updateTrustScore(token); //Increase if successful
        return true;
      } else {
        //Trust score too low - deny access
        return false;
      }
    } else {
      //Token expired
      return false;
    }
  } else {
    //Signature invalid
    return false;
  }
}

function updateTrustScore(token){
  //Increase/Decrease based on outcome and potentially service feedback.
  token.trustScore = calculateNewTrustScore(token.trustScore, outcome, serviceFeedback);
}
```

**5.  Benefits:**

*   **Adaptive Security:**  Security dynamically adjusts based on real-time behavior, reducing the attack surface.
*   **Reduced Reliance on Static Credentials:** Less reliance on long-lived static tokens.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Trust Score drops can act as an early warning signal for potential security breaches.
*   **Granular Access Control:** Fine-grained control over access permissions based on trust levels.
