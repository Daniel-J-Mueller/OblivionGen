## Dynamic Scene Contextualization via Generative Temporal Buffering

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A ‘Temporal Context Buffer’ (TCB) – a circular buffer storing a sequence of scene type predictions and corresponding raw image feature vectors (as defined in the patent) for a duration configurable between 5-60 seconds.
*   **Input:** Continuous video stream or a series of sequentially captured images.
*   **Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Initial Scene Prediction:** Utilize the existing patent’s system to generate an initial scene type prediction for the first frame/image. Store this prediction *and* the corresponding raw image feature vector in the TCB.
    2.  **Temporal Smoothing & Prediction Refinement:** For each subsequent frame/image:
        *   Retrieve the *n* most recent entries from the TCB (configurable *n* between 3-10).
        *   Calculate a weighted average of the scene type predictions from these entries. Weights are inversely proportional to the image feature distance (as calculated in the patent) between the current frame’s features and the features of the historical entries.  (Higher distance = lower weight).
        *   This weighted average provides a *refined* scene type prediction.
        *   Store the current frame's features *and* the refined scene type prediction in the TCB, overwriting the oldest entry.
    3.  **Contextual Event Triggering:** Introduce 'Contextual Event Triggers' (CETs). These are user-defined thresholds on the *rate of change* of scene type predictions within the TCB.
        *   Example CET: "If the scene type changes more than twice within 5 seconds, flag as ‘dynamic environment’."
        *   CETs allow the system to identify and react to significant shifts in the environment, such as a rapid sequence of scene changes in a video.
*   **Output:** A continuous stream of refined scene type predictions *and* alerts triggered by CETs.

**Pseudocode (CET Implementation):**

```
// Variables:
TCB = Temporal Context Buffer (circular buffer)
CETs = List of Contextual Event Triggers
current_time = current timestamp
last_scene_change_time = 0
scene_change_count = 0

function process_frame(frame):
    scene_type = predict_scene_type(frame)  // Use existing patent system

    // Add to TCB
    TCB.add(scene_type, extract_features(frame))

    // Check for scene change
    if TCB.last_scene_type != scene_type:
        scene_change_time = current_time
        scene_change_count += 1

    // Evaluate CETs
    for cet in CETs:
        if cet.type == "rate_of_change":
            if scene_change_count > cet.threshold:
                trigger_alert(cet.alert_message)
                scene_change_count = 0  // Reset counter
    return scene_type
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   GPU for accelerated feature extraction and weighted averaging calculations.
*   Sufficient RAM to store the TCB and intermediate feature vectors.
*   Real-time video capture device or streaming input.
