## Dynamic Device Mesh Creation & Collaborative Configuration

**Concept:** Extend preconfigured device representations to enable automatic discovery and configuration of interconnected devices, fostering a collaborative ‘mesh’ within the service provider environment. This moves beyond simple pre-configuration to a system where devices actively learn about and adapt to their surrounding ecosystem.

**Specifications:**

**1. Device Mesh Protocol (DMP):**

*   **Function:**  A lightweight communication protocol operating alongside existing network connectivity. DMP is for device discovery and capability exchange, *not* data transfer.
*   **Discovery:** Devices periodically broadcast “capability packets” containing:
    *   Device Type (e.g., Smart Bulb, Thermostat, Security Camera)
    *   Supported DMP Functions (see section 2)
    *   Unique Device ID (assigned during registration)
    *   Security Credentials (for secure communication)
*   **Reception & Mapping:** Devices listen for capability packets, building a local map of nearby devices and their functions. This map is updated dynamically.
*   **Range Extension:** Devices can act as relays for DMP packets, extending the discovery range beyond direct communication.

**2. DMP Functions (API):**

*   **`GET_CAPABILITIES(DeviceID)`:**  Requests detailed information about a specific device's capabilities.
*   **`REQUEST_CONFIG(DeviceID, ConfigType)`:**  Requests a specific configuration setting from another device.  (e.g., "Request light color temperature"). Requires permission.
*   **`SEND_CONFIG(DeviceID, ConfigType, Value)`:**  Sends a configuration setting to another device. Requires permission.
*   **`TRIGGER_ACTION(DeviceID, ActionName, Parameters)`:**  Triggers a specific action on another device (e.g., "Turn on", "Arm Security System"). Requires permission.
*   **`QUERY_STATE(DeviceID, StateVariable)`:** Queries a specific state variable (e.g., "Current temperature", "Motion detected").

**3. Collaborative Configuration Service (CCS):**

*   **Function:** A cloud-based service responsible for managing the device mesh and facilitating collaborative configurations.
*   **Mesh Management:** CCS maintains a global view of the device mesh, including device relationships and capabilities.
*   **Permission Management:**  CCS manages permissions for DMP function calls, ensuring devices only access authorized configurations and actions. Permissions can be user-defined or automatically inferred based on device relationships.
*   **Automated Configuration Scenarios:** Users can define automated configuration scenarios that involve multiple devices. CCS orchestrates the scenario by sending DMP function calls to the appropriate devices. Example:  "When motion is detected by the security camera, turn on the hallway light and send a notification to the user's phone."
*   **Context Awareness:** CCS can leverage contextual information (e.g., time of day, user location, weather conditions) to dynamically adjust device configurations.

**4.  Dynamic Preconfigured Representation Updates:**

*   **Mesh-Aware Profiles:** During device registration, CCS creates a "mesh-aware" preconfigured representation that incorporates information about nearby devices and their capabilities.
*   **Adaptive Configuration:** CCS monitors the device mesh and dynamically updates the preconfigured representation based on changes in the environment. For example, if a new device is added to the mesh, CCS will update the preconfigured representation to reflect the new device and its capabilities.
*   **Profile Sharing:** Users can share their mesh-aware profiles with other users, allowing them to quickly configure their own devices to match a desired environment.

**Pseudocode - CCS Orchestration of Scenario**

```
function executeScenario(scenarioDefinition, triggeringDeviceID) {
  devices = scenarioDefinition.involvedDevices
  for each deviceID in devices {
    if (deviceID == triggeringDeviceID) continue;

    action = scenarioDefinition.actionsForDevice[deviceID]
    if (action != null) {
      if(checkPermission(triggeringDeviceID, deviceID, action.name)){
        callDeviceFunction(deviceID, action.name, action.parameters)
      } else {
        logPermissionDenied(triggeringDeviceID, deviceID, action.name)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **AI-Driven Mesh Optimization:** Implement an AI algorithm to automatically optimize the device mesh topology and configuration for maximum performance and efficiency.
*   **Proactive Problem Detection:** Use the device mesh to proactively detect and diagnose problems with connected devices.
*   **Energy Management:** Optimize energy consumption across the device mesh based on user preferences and environmental conditions.
