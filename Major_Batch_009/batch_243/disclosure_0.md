## Adaptive Haptic Scene Enhancement

**System Overview:**

A system to augment media playback with localized haptic feedback, dynamically adjusted based on scene content analysis and user preference, extending beyond simple notification events. The system leverages the existing audio/video fingerprinting capability, but instead of *triggering* a notification, it generates a “haptic scene graph” representing appropriate tactile sensations.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Haptic Band/Vest:** A wearable device incorporating an array of micro-actuators (e.g., vibrotactile, electrotactile, thermal) capable of creating localized sensations across the user’s body. Resolution of actuators: 5cm spacing.
*   **Client Device:** (Smartphone/Tablet) - Captures audio/video, communicates with remote server, controls haptic band, stores user profiles.
*   **Remote Computing Device:** (Server) - Scene analysis, haptic scene graph generation, user profile management.

**Software Components:**

*   **Scene Analysis Module:** Analyzes incoming audio/video signals to identify scene elements (e.g., explosions, rain, wind, impacts, character movements, emotional tone). This module builds upon the fingerprinting system, but extracts *detailed* scene features.
*   **Haptic Scene Graph Generator:** Translates scene features into a directed graph where nodes represent haptic sensations (intensity, frequency, location on the body, duration) and edges represent the temporal relationships between sensations.
*   **User Profile Manager:** Stores user preferences for haptic intensity, sensation types, and scene-specific customizations (e.g., “more intense vibrations during action sequences,” “subtle warmth during romantic scenes”).
*   **Synchronization Module:**  Similar to the existing system, synchronizes haptic output with media playback using synchronization data.
*   **Haptic Driver:**  Controls the haptic band/vest, translating the haptic scene graph into actuator commands.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Scene Graph Generation):**

```
function generateHapticSceneGraph(sceneFeatures, userProfile):
  hapticGraph = new Graph()

  //Example - Explosion
  if (sceneFeatures.explosionDetected()):
    node = new HapticNode(intensity=userProfile.explosionIntensity,
                          frequency=userProfile.explosionFrequency,
                          location="chest",
                          duration=100ms)
    hapticGraph.addNode(node)

  //Example - Rain
  if (sceneFeatures.rainDetected(intensity=rainIntensity)):
    for each bodyLocation in [shoulders, back]:
      node = new HapticNode(intensity=rainIntensity * userProfile.rainIntensity,
                            frequency=userProfile.rainFrequency,
                            location=bodyLocation,
                            duration=500ms)
      hapticGraph.addNode(node)

  //Example - Character Movement (left to right)
  if (sceneFeatures.characterMovementDetected(direction="left-to-right")):
     node = new HapticNode(intensity = userProfile.movementIntensity,
                           frequency = userProfile.movementFrequency,
                           location = "back",
                           duration = 200ms)
     hapticGraph.addNode(node)

  //Add edges to represent temporal relationships (e.g. explosion follows impact)

  return hapticGraph
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  Client device captures audio/video of media playback.
2.  Audio/video is sent to the remote computing device.
3.  Scene analysis module extracts scene features.
4.  Haptic scene graph generator creates a haptic scene graph based on scene features and user profile.
5.  Haptic scene graph is sent to the client device.
6.  Synchronization module synchronizes haptic output with media playback.
7.  Haptic driver controls the haptic band/vest to deliver appropriate tactile sensations.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple notification-based haptic feedback and aims to create a more immersive and nuanced sensory experience that dynamically responds to the content of the media being consumed. The haptic scene graph approach allows for complex and layered tactile sensations, creating a richer and more engaging experience for the user.  The user profile allows for extremely individualized experiences.
