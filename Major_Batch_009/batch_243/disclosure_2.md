## Shared Dream-State Item Prioritization

**Concept:** Leverage biometric data during sleep to dynamically influence item prioritization for shared users, moving beyond simple co-location or stated preferences.

**Specification:**

1.  **Biometric Data Acquisition:**
    *   Non-contact sleep monitoring devices (integrated into bedroom environment - smart lighting, ambient sensors) track physiological data from both users – EEG (brainwave activity), heart rate variability (HRV), REM sleep detection, micro-movements.
    *   Data is anonymized and aggregated, focusing on emotional responses and cognitive activity *during* REM sleep – the dream state.

2.  **Dream-State Preference Mapping:**
    *   A trained AI model analyzes the biometric data to infer emotional responses to conceptual "tags" associated with catalog items (movies, books, products).
    *   Example: Increased EEG activity in areas associated with positive emotion *during* presentation of a "space exploration" tag suggests a positive affinity.
    *   This creates a "dream-state preference profile" for each user – a dynamic representation of subconscious desires.
    *   The model accounts for individual baselines and calibration periods.

3.  **Dynamic Prioritization Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION prioritize_items(user1_dream_profile, user2_dream_profile, user1_queue, user2_queue):
  combined_priority = {}

  FOR item IN user1_queue + user2_queue:
    combined_priority[item] = 0

    #Base Priority (Existing Queue Position)
    IF item IN user1_queue:
      combined_priority[item] += user1_queue.index(item) * -1  #Lower index = higher priority
    IF item IN user2_queue:
      combined_priority[item] += user2_queue.index(item) * -1

    #Dream-State Affinity Score
    affinity_score_1 = dream_profile_score(user1_dream_profile, item) #Scale 0-1
    affinity_score_2 = dream_profile_score(user2_dream_profile, item)
    combined_affinity = (affinity_score_1 + affinity_score_2) / 2

    combined_priority[item] += combined_affinity * 10

  #Sort items based on combined priority (descending)
  sorted_items = sorted(combined_priority.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)

  RETURN [item[0] for item in sorted_items]
```

4.  **User Interface Integration:**
    *   A subtle "DreamSync" indicator displays when biometric data is actively being used.
    *   An optional "Dream Insights" section reveals broad themes identified in shared dream states (e.g., "Shared interest in adventure and fantasy").
    *   A privacy control allows users to disable DreamSync entirely.

5. **System Requirements:**
    *   Non-contact sleep monitoring hardware (integrated into bedroom environment)
    *   Secure data transmission and storage infrastructure
    *   AI model for biometric data analysis and preference mapping
    *   Cloud-based processing for real-time prioritization

**Novelty:** This moves beyond explicitly stated preferences or shared physical location, tapping into subconscious desires as revealed through biometric data. The resulting prioritization algorithm is significantly more dynamic and personalized. This has potential for surprising and delightful item recommendations, fostering a deeper connection between users and the platform.
