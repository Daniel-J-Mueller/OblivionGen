## Adaptive Pre-Fetch Based on Predicted Viewer Attention

**Concept:** Expand upon the pre-fetching capability described in the patent by incorporating predictive analytics based on viewer attention metrics to optimize pre-fetched segments. Instead of simply pre-fetching "future" segments, predict *which* segments a viewer is most likely to watch *next* based on their viewing behavior, and prioritize those.

**Specs:**

*   **Attention Metric Collection:** Integrate client-side analytics to gather attention metrics. These include:
    *   **View Duration:** Time spent actively viewing a segment.
    *   **Pause/Resume Frequency:**  Indicates engagement or disengagement.
    *   **Replay Frequency:** Signals important or confusing content.
    *   **Fast-Forward/Rewind Patterns:**  Reveals skipped content or areas requiring revisiting.
    *   **Device Orientation/Motion:** (Optional) Provides contextual awareness of viewer activity (e.g., looking at phone vs. stationary viewing).
*   **Predictive Model:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) trained on historical viewer attention data. 
    *   **Input:** A sequence of attention metrics from the current viewing session.
    *   **Output:** A probability distribution over future segments, indicating the likelihood of each segment being watched next.
*   **Pre-Fetch Prioritization:** Modify the pre-fetch mechanism to prioritize segments based on the predicted probability distribution. 
    *   Higher probability segments are pre-fetched first.
    *   A configurable parameter controls the number of segments to pre-fetch.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update the predictive model and pre-fetch prioritization based on real-time viewer behavior.
*   **Server-Side Integration:** The server needs to track segment requests, durations, and engagement metrics. The predictive model runs on the server, and the client requests predictions before needing new segments.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
clientId = getClientId()
attentionMetrics = []

// During playback of segment 'n'
function onSegmentFinished(segmentNumber) {
  // Collect attention metrics for segment 'n'
  duration = calculateSegmentDuration(segmentNumber)
  pauseCount = getPauseCount(segmentNumber)
  // Add metrics to the attentionMetrics list
  attentionMetrics.append({
    segment: segmentNumber,
    duration: duration,
    pauseCount: pauseCount
  })

  // Request prediction from server
  prediction = requestPrediction(clientId, attentionMetrics)

  // Sort segments based on predicted probability
  sortedSegments = sortSegments(prediction)

  // Pre-fetch top N segments
  prefetchSegments(sortedSegments, N)
}
```

**Server-Side Flow:**

1.  Client requests prediction, sending attention metrics.
2.  Server receives metrics and uses the trained model to predict probabilities for future segments.
3.  Server sends probability distribution back to the client.
4.  Client sorts and pre-fetches segments.
