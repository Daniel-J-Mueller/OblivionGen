## Adaptive Quorum with Reputation

**Concept:** Enhance failover robustness and efficiency by introducing a reputation system for replicas, dynamically adjusting quorum requirements based on historical performance and perceived reliability. This moves beyond fixed quorum sizes and introduces a weighting system, potentially decreasing failover latency and increasing system resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Metric:**

*   **Metric Name:** Replica Reliability Score (RRS)
*   **Range:** 0-100 (0 = Untrustworthy, 100 = Highly Reliable)
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Base Score: 50
    *   Positive Adjustments:
        *   Successful Data Service: +1 point per successful request served.
        *   Successful Failover Participation: +5 points per successful participation in a failover event (determined by successful data validation post-failover).
        *   Low Latency Response: +0.1 point for each request served under a pre-defined latency threshold.
    *   Negative Adjustments:
        *   Data Corruption: -20 points (detected via checksum validation).
        *   Failed Request: -2 points.
        *   Slow Response: -1 point for each request served exceeding a defined latency threshold.
        *   Failover Participation Failure: -10 points.
*   **Decay:** RRS gradually decays over time (e.g., 1 point per day) to account for potential degradation.
*   **Storage:** RRS stored per replica, maintained by a dedicated Reputation Manager service.

**2. Dynamic Quorum Calculation:**

*   **Total Weighted Score:** Calculate the sum of all replicas’ RRS within the replica group.
*   **Quorum Threshold:** Define a minimum weighted score required for the quorum (e.g., 75% of the total weighted score).
*   **Quorum Selection:**  During failover, select replicas that contribute to the quorum until the minimum weighted score threshold is met.  Selection prioritizes replicas with the highest RRS.
*   **Example:**
    *   Replica Group: A, B, C, D
    *   RRS: A=90, B=70, C=50, D=30
    *   Total Weighted Score: 240
    *   Quorum Threshold: 180 (75% of 240)
    *   Quorum Selection: A (90), B (70), C (20) – achieves threshold.  D is excluded.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Reputation Manager Service:** Dedicated service responsible for calculating, storing, and providing RRS for each replica.
*   **Failover Coordinator:** Modified to integrate with the Reputation Manager and utilize dynamic quorum calculation during failover.
*   **Data Validation:** Strengthened post-failover data validation to accurately assess replica participation and adjust RRS accordingly.
*   **Configuration:** Allow system administrators to tune parameters such as RRS decay rate, latency thresholds, and quorum threshold percentage.

**4. Pseudocode (Failover Coordinator):**

```
function initiateFailover(failedReplica):
  quorum = []
  totalRRS = ReputationManager.getTotalRRS(replicaGroup)
  quorumThreshold = totalRRS * 0.75

  // Sort replicas by RRS in descending order
  sortedReplicas = replicaGroup.sortByRRS(descending)

  currentQuorumWeight = 0

  for replica in sortedReplicas:
    if replica != failedReplica:
      currentQuorumWeight += replica.RRS
      quorum.append(replica)

      if currentQuorumWeight >= quorumThreshold:
        break

  if len(quorum) > 0:
    // Initiate failover using the selected quorum
    performFailover(quorum)
  else:
    // Handle case where quorum cannot be formed
    logError("Unable to form quorum")
    // Implement fallback mechanism (e.g., manual intervention)
```

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Reputation Decay Acceleration:**  Accelerate RRS decay for replicas experiencing frequent failures or performance degradation.
*   **Cross-Group Reputation:**  Share reputation information across different replica groups to improve overall system reliability.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Utilize machine learning to detect anomalous behavior in replica performance and proactively adjust RRS.
