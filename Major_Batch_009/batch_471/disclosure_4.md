## Dynamic Scene Importance via Multi-Modal Affective Computing

**Concept:** Extend scene importance ranking beyond textual analysis of closed captions to incorporate real-time affective data derived from both *visual* and *audio* streams of the video content. This creates a dynamic importance score that reacts to the emotional impact of a scene *as it unfolds*, rather than relying solely on post-hoc textual analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Synchronization Module:**

*   **Input:** Video content (stream or file), Closed Caption data (as provided by the patent).
*   **Process:**  Synchronize video/audio streams with closed caption data.  Implement frame-accurate timestamping for all data sources.  
*   **Output:**  Time-synchronized multi-modal data stream (video frames, audio samples, closed caption segments).

**2. Visual Affect Analysis Subsystem:**

*   **Input:**  Synchronized video frames.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Facial Expression Recognition:**  Employ a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and classify facial expressions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral) within each frame.  Track faces across frames to maintain consistent identification.
    *   **Scene Aesthetics Analysis:** Utilize a CNN to assess aesthetic qualities of the scene (e.g., brightness, contrast, color saturation, composition).
    *   **Object/Action Recognition:** Identify key objects and actions within the scene (e.g., a character crying, a violent clash, a romantic embrace).
*   **Output:**  Time-series data representing emotional intensity (per expression), aesthetic score, and identified objects/actions for each frame.

**3. Audio Affect Analysis Subsystem:**

*   **Input:**  Synchronized audio samples.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER):** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically an LSTM or GRU – trained on a large dataset of emotional speech to classify the emotional state of spoken dialog (e.g., happy, sad, angry, fearful, neutral).
    *   **Music Mood Analysis:** Analyze background music (if present) to determine its mood (e.g., joyful, melancholic, suspenseful).  Feature extraction should include spectral features (MFCCs, chroma features) and rhythmic features.
    *   **Sound Event Detection (SED):** Identify emotionally relevant sound events (e.g., screams, gunshots, laughter).
*   **Output:**  Time-series data representing emotional intensity (from speech), music mood, and detected sound events.

**4. Scene Importance Ranking Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Time-series data from Visual Affect Analysis, Audio Affect Analysis, and Closed Caption data (textual analysis as described in the provided patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Feature Fusion:**  Combine affective features (visual & audio) with textual features. Weighting factors can be dynamically adjusted based on content type (e.g., higher weight on visual cues for action scenes, higher weight on dialog for dramatic scenes).
    *   **Dynamic Importance Score Calculation:**  Calculate a scene importance score for each scene (or short time window) using a weighted sum of affective and textual features. Implement a sliding window average to smooth the score over time.
    *   **Contextual Analysis:** Incorporate a short-term memory component (e.g., an LSTM) to consider the *change* in emotional intensity over time. Rapid shifts in emotion should be given higher weight.
*   **Output:**  Time-series data representing the dynamic importance score for each scene (or time window).

**5. System Outputs:**

*   **Ranked Scene List:** A list of scenes ranked by their calculated importance score.
*   **Dynamic Scene Graph:** A visualization of the scene importance scores over time.
*   **Emotion Timeline:** A visualization of the emotional arc of the video content.
*   **Metadata Tagging:** Automatically tag video segments with emotion-based keywords (e.g., "suspenseful," "heartwarming," "tragic").

**Pseudocode (Scene Importance Calculation):**

```
function calculate_scene_importance(visual_features, audio_features, text_features):
  // Normalize all feature vectors to a range of 0-1
  visual_features = normalize(visual_features)
  audio_features = normalize(audio_features)
  text_features = normalize(text_features)

  // Define weighting factors (adjustable)
  visual_weight = 0.3
  audio_weight = 0.3
  text_weight = 0.4

  // Calculate combined feature vector
  combined_features = (visual_weight * visual_features) + (audio_weight * audio_features) + (text_weight * text_features)

  // Apply short-term memory (LSTM) to capture emotional change
  lstm_output = lstm(combined_features)

  // Calculate scene importance score
  scene_importance_score = sigmoid(lstm_output)

  return scene_importance_score
