## Adaptive Sample Decomposition for Polymorphic Threat Detection

**Concept:** Expand upon the selective block hashing by introducing an adaptive sample decomposition algorithm. Instead of fixed beginning/end blocks, dynamically break the sample into segments based on entropy and structural changes. This aims to better detect polymorphic threats that shift code around, as consistent, fixed blocks might miss altered sections.

**Specs:**

1.  **Entropy Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Raw sample data (bytes).
    *   Process:
        *   Divide the sample into sliding windows of configurable size (e.g., 512 bytes, 1KB).
        *   Calculate Shannon entropy for each window.
        *   Identify windows with significantly higher entropy than the average entropy of the sample. These are potential areas of interest or obfuscation.
2.  **Structural Change Detection Module:**
    *   Input: Raw sample data.
    *   Process:
        *   Employ a lightweight disassembler (or byte pattern matching engine) to identify potential code sections (e.g., function headers, loops).
        *   Track the frequency of opcode sequences or specific byte patterns.
        *   Detect sudden changes in opcode distribution or pattern frequency, indicating code reordering or insertion.
3.  **Adaptive Decomposition Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Entropy analysis results, structural change detection results, configurable parameters (decomposition sensitivity, maximum segment size).
    *   Process:
        *   Initialize segment boundaries.
        *   Iterate through the sample.
        *   If a window exceeds the entropy threshold *or* a structural change is detected:
            *   Create a new segment boundary at that point.
            *   Adjust segment sizes to be within the maximum segment size limit.
            *   Prioritize segment boundaries at natural alignment boundaries (e.g., 4-byte or 16-byte alignment) where possible.
4.  **Hashing Pipeline:**
    *   Input: Segmented sample, Threat Database.
    *   Process:
        *   Generate hashes for each segment (using SHA256 or similar).
        *   Query the Threat Database for matches against these segment hashes.
        *   If a match is found, flag the segment as potentially malicious.
        *   Combine segment hashes (e.g., concatenate and hash) to generate a composite hash for the entire sample.
        *   Query the Threat Database for matches against the composite hash.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function adaptive_decomposition_scan(sample, threat_database):
  entropy_results = analyze_entropy(sample)
  structural_changes = detect_structural_changes(sample)
  segments = create_segments(sample, entropy_results, structural_changes)

  segment_hashes = []
  for segment in segments:
    segment_hash = hash_segment(segment)
    segment_hashes.append(segment_hash)

    if threat_database.contains(segment_hash):
      flag_segment_as_malicious(segment)

  composite_hash = combine_and_hash(segment_hashes)
  if threat_database.contains(composite_hash):
    flag_sample_as_malicious(sample)

  return results
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `window_size`: Size of sliding windows for entropy analysis.
*   `entropy_threshold`: Threshold for identifying high-entropy windows.
*   `max_segment_size`: Maximum allowed segment size.
*   `decomposition_sensitivity`: Controls how aggressively the sample is decomposed.  Higher values result in more frequent segment boundaries.
*   `hash_algorithm`: The hashing algorithm to use (e.g., SHA256, SHA3).
