## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Inventory Guidance

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A wearable haptic vest integrated with the existing visual display system. The vest contains an array of micro-vibration motors (actuators) distributed across the torso and shoulders.
*   **Sensor Suite:** The vest incorporates inertial measurement units (IMUs) to track torso orientation and movement in 3D space. It also includes proximity sensors to detect nearby objects (storage structures, other personnel).
*   **Data Integration:** The system receives data from the visual tracking system (head/eye level), the IMUs, the proximity sensors, and the inventory management system (item location, task assignment).
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** This algorithm correlates item location in the storage structure with specific vibration patterns on the haptic vest. Higher items trigger vibrations higher on the torso, lower items trigger vibrations lower on the torso. Depth within the storage structure is mapped to vibration intensity.
*   **Task-Based Haptic Guidance:**  The system provides subtle haptic cues to guide the operator to the correct item location. For example:
    *   **Initial Direction:** A gentle, pulsing vibration on the left or right side of the vest indicates the general direction of the target storage structure.
    *   **Vertical Guidance:** Vibration intensity increases or decreases to indicate whether the operator should look up or down.
    *   **Fine-Grained Localization:**  Subtle, localized vibrations pinpoint the exact bin or shelf containing the item.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The haptic guidance adapts in real-time to the operator’s movements, head/eye position, and changes in the environment.
*   **Safety Features:** Proximity sensors trigger increased vibration intensity as a warning when the operator gets too close to obstacles or other personnel.
*   **Power:** Battery powered, with inductive charging.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication (Bluetooth or WiFi) with the inventory management system.

**Pseudocode for Haptic Cue Generation:**

```
// Input:
//   item_x, item_y, item_z: 3D coordinates of the target item in the storage structure
//   operator_head_x, operator_head_y, operator_head_z: 3D coordinates of the operator’s head
//   storage_structure_dimensions: Dimensions of the storage structure
//   operator_height: Operator's height

// Calculate relative position of the item to the operator’s head
relative_x = item_x - operator_head_x
relative_y = item_y - operator_head_y
relative_z = item_z - operator_head_z

// Normalize relative position to a range of 0-1
normalized_x = constrain(map(relative_x, -storage_structure_dimensions.x, storage_structure_dimensions.x, 0, 1), 0, 1)
normalized_y = constrain(map(relative_y, -storage_structure_dimensions.y, storage_structure_dimensions.y, 0, 1), 0, 1)
normalized_z = constrain(map(relative_z, -storage_structure_dimensions.z, storage_structure_dimensions.z, 0, 1), 0, 1)

// Map normalized coordinates to haptic vest actuators
vest_actuator_x = round(normalized_x * num_x_actuators)
vest_actuator_y = round(normalized_y * num_y_actuators)
vest_actuator_z = round(normalized_z * num_z_actuators)

// Calculate vibration intensity based on depth (z-coordinate)
vibration_intensity = map(normalized_z, 0, 1, 0, max_vibration_intensity)

// Activate actuators with calculated intensity
activate_actuator(vest_actuator_x, vest_actuator_y, vest_actuator_z, vibration_intensity)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Haptic Profiles:** Allow operators to customize the haptic feedback patterns to their preferences.
*   **AI-Powered Learning:** Use machine learning to optimize the haptic guidance based on operator performance and task complexity.
*   **Integration with Voice Control:** Allow operators to verbally request assistance or clarification during the inventory process.
*   **Haptic Alerts:** Use distinct haptic patterns to signal critical events, such as low battery or safety hazards.
