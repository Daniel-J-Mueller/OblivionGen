## Modular, Self-Healing Battery Fabric

**Concept:** A battery constructed from interwoven, micro-encapsulated battery 'fibers' creating a flexible fabric. Damage to sections of the fabric triggers localized self-healing through microfluidic redistribution of electrolyte and active materials.

**Specs:**

*   **Fiber Construction:** Each fiber is ~100-500um diameter, containing multiple micro-channels.
    *   Core: Current collector (e.g., silver nanowires or graphene mesh)
    *   Active Material Layer: Dispersed particles of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) or similar material within a conductive polymer matrix.
    *   Electrolyte Reservoir: Micro-channel filled with a gel polymer electrolyte (e.g., PEO-LiTFSI).
    *   Protective Shell:  Micro-encapsulation using a flexible polymer (e.g., parylene) to prevent leakage and environmental degradation.
*   **Fabric Architecture:**
    *   Weaving Pattern:  A 3D woven structure maximizing surface area and flexibility. Different weave densities can control stiffness and energy density in specific areas.
    *   Interconnects: Microfluidic channels running *between* fibers allow for electrolyte and active material transfer. These channels are passively filled through capillary action.
    *   Layered Construction: Multiple layers of fabric stacked to increase voltage and capacity. Layers are electrically isolated except at designated connection points.
*   **Self-Healing Mechanism:**
    *   Damage Detection: Micro-cracks rupture micro-capsules, releasing a tracer dye (fluorescent or conductive).
    *   Fluidic Redistribution:  The tracer dye activates a microfluidic pump (piezoelectric or osmotic) to draw electrolyte and active material from surrounding intact fibers into the damaged area.
    *   Re-deposition: Damaged active material is dissolved into the electrolyte and re-deposited onto the current collector in the crack.
    *   Sealing: A secondary micro-capsule containing a sealant polymer is ruptured by the damage, sealing the crack.
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Integrated Sensors:  Fiber-optic sensors embedded within the fabric monitor voltage, current, temperature, and state of charge.
    *   Wireless Communication:  Data transmitted wirelessly to a central control unit for power management and health monitoring.

**Pseudocode (Self-Healing Algorithm):**

```
// Damage Detection
IF (Tracer_Detected == TRUE) THEN
    Damage_Location = Get_Damage_Location()
    Initiate_Self_Healing(Damage_Location)
ENDIF

// Initiate Self-Healing Function
FUNCTION Initiate_Self_Healing(Damage_Location)
    Activate_Microfluidic_Pump(Damage_Location)
    Draw_Electrolyte_And_Active_Material(Damage_Location)
    Re-Deposit_Active_Material(Damage_Location)
    Activate_Sealant_Release(Damage_Location)
END FUNCTION

**Potential Applications:** Wearable electronics, flexible displays, implantable medical devices, structural batteries integrated into vehicles/buildings.
