## Secure Data Attestation via Distributed Ledger

**Concept:** Extend secure enclave functionality by leveraging a distributed ledger (blockchain) to not only verify VMM integrity *before* operations, but to create a tamper-proof audit trail *of* operations performed within the enclave, and to allow for verifiable delegation of access to sensitive data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):** Existing secure co-processor (as described in the patent) responsible for secure computation and initial attestation.
*   **Blockchain Node Interface:** Hardware or software component enabling communication with a permissioned blockchain network. This could be integrated within the co-processor or reside as a separate peripheral.
*   **Secure Key Storage:**  Hardware Security Module (HSM) or equivalent secure storage within the co-processor for storing blockchain identity keys and potentially customer keys.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Attestation Service:**  Software running within the TEE responsible for generating cryptographic attestations of the VMM's state.  This is similar to existing functionality, but extends to include operation details.
*   **Blockchain Transaction Builder:** Software within the TEE that constructs blockchain transactions containing:
    *   VMM Hash: Current hash of the VMM code.
    *   Operation ID: Unique identifier for the type of operation being performed.
    *   Data Hash (Optional): Hash of the sensitive data being processed (avoid storing actual data on-chain).
    *   Timestamp: Time of the operation.
    *   Digital Signature: Signed by the co-processorâ€™s private key.
*   **Smart Contract:** Deployed on the permissioned blockchain that manages:
    *   VMM Registration: Stores authorized VMM hashes.
    *   Access Control Policies: Defines who (identified by blockchain addresses) is authorized to perform specific operations on sensitive data.
    *   Audit Log: Maintains an immutable record of all operations performed within the enclave.
*   **VMM Integration:** Modified VMM that interfaces with the attestation service and blockchain transaction builder.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **VMM Boot/Modification:**  Upon VMM boot or modification, the attestation service generates a hash of the VMM code and submits it to the blockchain, registering the authorized VMM.
2.  **Customer Request:** Customer VM requests an operation involving sensitive data.
3.  **Access Check:** VMM initiates a check with the smart contract to confirm the customer (identified by blockchain address) is authorized to perform the requested operation.
4.  **Secure Mode Entry:** If authorized, the VMM enters secure mode, marking memory pages.
5.  **Operation Execution:** The co-processor performs the operation on the sensitive data.
6.  **Transaction Creation:** Before returning results, the co-processor constructs a blockchain transaction detailing the operation performed.
7.  **Transaction Submission:** The co-processor signs the transaction and submits it to the blockchain network.
8.  **Result Return:** The co-processor returns the results to the VMM.
9.  **Secure Mode Exit:** The VMM exits secure mode.
10. **Blockchain Verification:**  An external auditor or the data owner can independently verify the operation's execution by examining the blockchain log.

**Pseudocode (Transaction Builder):**

```
function buildTransaction(vmmHash, operationId, dataHash, timestamp):
  transaction = new Transaction()
  transaction.vmmHash = vmmHash
  transaction.operationId = operationId
  transaction.dataHash = dataHash
  transaction.timestamp = timestamp
  transaction.signature = sign(transaction, coProcessorPrivateKey)
  return transaction
```

**Novelty:**

This design shifts from solely verifying VMM integrity *before* operations to establishing a verifiable, tamper-proof *record* of operations. This unlocks:

*   **Enhanced Auditability:**  Provides a complete audit trail for compliance and regulatory purposes.
*   **Delegated Access:** Enables customers to delegate access to their data with fine-grained control, managed on the blockchain.
*   **Data Sovereignty:**  Empowers customers with greater control over their data, as they can independently verify its processing.
*   **Trustless Verification:** Eliminates the need to trust the VMM provider, as the blockchain provides an independent source of truth.
