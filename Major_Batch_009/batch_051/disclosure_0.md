## Variable Geometry Airfoil System for Dynamic Airflow Control

**System Overview:**

This design introduces a system employing multiple small, independently controlled airfoils within the air handling unit's airflow passages. These airfoils, positioned strategically, allow for highly granular control over airflow direction and volume, surpassing the capabilities of a single pivoting barrier. Instead of simply blocking or diverting airflow, this system *shapes* the airflow.

**Components:**

1.  **Airfoil Array:** A grid or array of small, independently actuatable airfoils. Each airfoil is approximately 5-10cm in length, constructed from a lightweight, durable polymer or composite material. The density of the array will vary based on the specific size and throughput requirements of the air handling unit.

2.  **Actuation Mechanism:** Each airfoil is connected to a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric, micro-servo, or similar). The actuators allow for precise adjustment of the airfoil's angle of attack â€“ from fully aligned with the airflow (minimal deflection) to perpendicular (maximum deflection).

3.  **Control System:** A microcontroller-based system receives input from temperature, humidity, and airflow sensors. This system then calculates the optimal airfoil angles for each individual element to achieve the desired cooling and airflow characteristics.  The control system will also incorporate predictive algorithms based on historical data and external weather conditions.

4.  **Sensor Network:** A distributed network of miniature temperature, humidity, and airflow sensors positioned throughout the air handling unit. These sensors provide real-time data to the control system, enabling adaptive airflow control.

5.  **Housing Integration:** Airfoils are embedded within the existing ductwork, seamlessly integrated into the airflow passages. The airfoil mounting system allows for easy maintenance and replacement.

**Operational Modes & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Dynamic Cooling Control:**  Adjusts airflow distribution to optimize cooling based on real-time conditions.  More airflow is directed through the cooling module when higher cooling is required.

    ```pseudocode
    // Read sensor data
    temperature = readTemperatureSensor()
    humidity = readHumiditySensor()
    airflow = readAirflowSensor()

    // Calculate cooling demand
    coolingDemand = calculateCoolingDemand(temperature, humidity)

    // Calculate optimal airfoil angles
    for each airfoil in airfoilArray:
      angle = calculateAirfoilAngle(coolingDemand, airfoil.position)
      setAirfoilAngle(airfoil, angle)
    ```

2.  **Zonal Cooling:**  Creates localized cooling zones by selectively directing cooled air to specific areas of the building.

    ```pseudocode
    // Read zone temperature requests
    zoneTemps = readZoneTemperatureRequests()

    // Calculate airflow distribution for each zone
    zoneAirflow = calculateZoneAirflow(zoneTemps)

    // Adjust airfoil angles to achieve desired airflow distribution
    for each airfoil in airfoilArray:
      angle = calculateAirfoilAngle(zoneAirflow, airfoil.position)
      setAirfoilAngle(airfoil, angle)
    ```

3.  **Air Purification Mode:**  Shapes airflow to maximize contact with air purification filters (e.g., HEPA, carbon filters).

    ```pseudocode
    // Check air quality sensor data
    airQuality = readAirQualitySensor()

    // If air quality is poor:
    if airQuality < threshold:
      // Calculate airfoil angles to maximize airflow through filters
      for each airfoil in airfoilArray:
        angle = calculateAirfoilAngle(filterMode, airfoil.position)
        setAirfoilAngle(airfoil, angle)
    ```
