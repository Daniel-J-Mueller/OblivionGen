## Haptic Feedback Stylus with Variable Texture

**Concept:** A stylus capable of dynamically altering the texture of its tip to simulate different writing/drawing materials (e.g., pencil on paper, charcoal, paintbrush). This is achieved through micro-actuated pins or a fluid-based system within the stylus tip.

**Specs:**

*   **Tip Material:** Durable polymer composite with embedded micro-actuators or microfluidic channels.
*   **Actuation Method:**
    *   **Pin-based:** Array of individually controlled micro-pins extending/retracting from the stylus tip. Each pin has a controlled height and material (varying friction). Control achieved via piezoelectric actuators or MEMS solenoids.
    *   **Fluid-based:** Microfluidic channels containing fluids of varying viscosity/texture. Valves control fluid flow to change the surface feel of the tip.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Pressure sensor: Measures the force applied to the touchscreen.
    *   Angle sensor: Detects the stylus angle relative to the screen.
    *   Motion sensor (IMU): Tracks stylus movement and velocity.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth 5.0 LE for communication with the host device (tablet, computer).
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-polymer battery (minimum 8 hours of continuous use). Wireless charging capable.
*   **Control Software:** Companion app on the host device allows users to:
    *   Select pre-defined material simulations (pencil, charcoal, paintbrush, etc.).
    *   Customize material properties (roughness, hardness, friction).
    *   Create and share custom material profiles.
*   **Dimensions:** Standard stylus dimensions (approx. 140mm length, 9mm diameter).
*   **Weight:** Lightweight construction (under 30g).

**Operation:**

1.  The user selects a desired material simulation through the companion app.
2.  The app transmits control signals to the stylus via Bluetooth.
3.  The stylus activates the appropriate micro-actuators or fluidic valves to alter the tip texture.
4.  The sensor suite captures stylus position, pressure, angle, and motion.
5.  The host device renders the drawing/writing based on the sensor data and the selected material simulation.
6.  Haptic feedback, coordinated with the rendered visuals, provides an immersive writing/drawing experience.

**Pseudocode (Stylus Firmware - Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
connectBluetooth()
loadMaterialProfile(selectedProfile)

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  readSensorData()
  receiveDataFromHost()

  if (newMaterialProfileReceived) {
    loadMaterialProfile(newMaterialProfile)
  }

  // Apply haptic feedback based on sensor data and material profile
  if (isTouchingScreen) {
    setHapticFeedback(sensorData, materialProfile)
  }

  transmitSensorDataToHost()
}

function setHapticFeedback(sensorData, materialProfile) {
  // Logic to control micro-actuators or fluid valves based on
  // pressure, angle, velocity, and material profile parameters
}

function loadMaterialProfile(profile) {
  // Load parameters defining texture, friction, hardness, etc.
}
```
