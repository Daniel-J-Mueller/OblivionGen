## Adaptive Acoustic Cavity – Wearable Sensory Enhancement

**Concept:** Expand the bone conduction paradigm by actively shaping the acoustic cavity *around* the transducer, not just relying on skull resonance. This facilitates both improved audio fidelity *and* the integration of additional sensory input.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Modular Cavity System:** The bone conduction speaker (BCS) is embedded within a flexible, multi-layer structure – the “Acoustic Shell”. This shell isn’t fixed; it’s composed of individually addressable, micro-actuated segments. Think of it like a miniature, conformal display, but for sound.
2.  **Segment Composition:** Each segment is a thin polymer membrane with embedded piezoelectric actuators.  These actuators can subtly deform the membrane, altering the volume and shape of the enclosed acoustic cavity. Materials: Shape-memory polymer outer layer, piezoelectric actuator core, acoustic dampening layer (varying density).
3.  **Sensor Integration:** Each segment also houses a miniature sensor array. These sensors aren't solely for audio – they include:
    *   **Pressure Sensors:** To map the conformability to the skull.
    *   **Temperature Sensors:** For biofeedback and thermal mapping.
    *   **Strain Gauges:** To detect muscle tension near the BCS.
    *   **Bioimpedance Sensors**:  To gauge hydration levels within surrounding tissues.
4.  **Control System – ‘Acoustic AI’:** A dedicated microcontroller unit (MCU) – ‘Acoustic AI’ – manages the segment actuation and sensor data. Pseudocode:

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Read sensor data from all segments
    sensorData = readAllSegments();

    // Analyze sensor data - identify skull contours, muscle tension, temperature variations
    analyzedData = analyzeData(sensorData);

    // Calculate optimal cavity shape based on analyzedData and audio signal
    cavityShape = calculateOptimalShape(analyzedData, audioSignal);

    // Actuate segments to achieve calculated cavity shape
    actuateSegments(cavityShape);

    //Transmit audio signal to BCS
    transmitAudio(audioSignal)
}
```

5.  **Adaptive Algorithm:**  The ‘Acoustic AI’ utilizes machine learning to learn the user’s skull geometry and muscle patterns. This enables it to personalize the acoustic cavity shape for optimal sound transmission and sensory input.
6.  **Power Supply:** Low-power Bluetooth LE module for data transmission and wireless charging.  Miniature solid-state battery embedded within the temple structure.
7.  **Materials:** Biocompatible polymers for all user-contacting surfaces. Flexible PCB for sensor integration and actuation control.
8. **Extended Functionality:** Incorporate haptic feedback within the acoustic shell to convey directional audio cues, notifications, or even environmental awareness (e.g., proximity alerts).

**Novelty:**  This isn’t simply a better bone conduction speaker; it’s a dynamic acoustic system that *actively adapts* to the user’s anatomy and integrates multiple sensory inputs. It transforms the wearable device from a purely audio output system into a bio-adaptive sensory interface. The integration of multiple sensors allows for biofeedback integration, creating a personalized audio-sensory experience.
