## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction via Viewport Fusion

**Concept:** Expand the viewport system to enable real-time, dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from the multiple streaming camera views. Rather than just *displaying* camera feeds within a representation, actively build a navigable 3D environment.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Synchronization:**

*   **Input:** Multiple streaming camera feeds (viewports), each with intrinsic & extrinsic calibration data. Timestamping is critical.
*   **Synchronization Module:**  A hardware/software module to precisely synchronize incoming video streams. Aim for <10ms latency differential between streams. Utilize NTP or PTP for initial synchronization, followed by frame-level correction using visual feature tracking.

**2. Feature Extraction & Matching:**

*   **Feature Detector:** Utilize a robust feature detector (e.g., ORB, SIFT, or learned features via a CNN) to identify key points in each frame.
*   **Feature Descriptor:** Generate descriptors for each key point.
*   **Feature Matching:** Employ a feature matching algorithm (e.g., brute-force matcher with cross-check) to identify corresponding features across different views. Employ RANSAC to filter outliers.

**3. Structure from Motion (SfM) & Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):**

*   **Initialization:** Use initial calibration data to bootstrap the SfM/SLAM process.
*   **Triangulation:** Triangulate matched features to estimate 3D point locations.
*   **Bundle Adjustment:**  Optimize camera poses and 3D point locations simultaneously using a bundle adjustment algorithm. Utilize a sparse matrix solver for efficiency.
*   **Mapping:** Create a 3D map of the scene using point clouds or a mesh representation. Consider using an Octree or KD-Tree data structure for efficient storage and querying.

**4. Viewport Representation & Interaction:**

*   **Dynamic Viewport Mapping:**  Instead of fixed viewport representations, map each viewport to a specific *viewpoint* within the reconstructed 3D scene. This viewpoint's position and orientation are dynamically updated based on the SLAM solution.
*   **Viewport Blending/Fusion:** Implement techniques for blending or fusing multiple viewport views to create a seamless visual experience. Consider weighted averaging based on distance/confidence.
*   **Navigable 3D Environment:** Allow users to navigate the reconstructed 3D scene using a variety of input methods (e.g., mouse, keyboard, VR controllers).
*   **Virtual Camera Control:** Allow users to control a virtual camera within the 3D scene, switching between different viewport perspectives or creating custom viewpoints.

**5. System Architecture:**

*   **Multi-Threaded Processing:** Distribute processing tasks across multiple threads to maximize performance.
*   **GPU Acceleration:** Utilize GPU acceleration for computationally intensive tasks such as feature extraction, matching, and rendering.
*   **Real-time Performance:** Aim for a frame rate of at least 30fps to provide a smooth and responsive experience.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
load_calibration_data()
initialize_slam_system()

// Main Loop
while (running) {
  // 1. Acquire Frames from Viewports
  frames = get_viewport_frames()

  // 2. Extract Features
  features = extract_features(frames)

  // 3. Match Features
  matches = match_features(features)

  // 4. Estimate Camera Poses & 3D Points (SLAM)
  slam_result = perform_slam(matches)
  camera_poses = slam_result.camera_poses
  points_3d = slam_result.points_3d

  // 5. Update Viewport Representations
  for each viewport {
    viewport_representation.position = camera_poses[viewport].position
    viewport_representation.orientation = camera_poses[viewport].orientation
  }

  // 6. Render Scene
  render_scene(points_3d, viewport_representations)

  // 7. Display
  display_rendered_scene()
}
```
