## Contextual Credential Swarming & Dynamic Policy Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the idea of injecting context into credentials by allowing *multiple* principals to contribute context, creating a ‘swarm’ of contextual data associated with a single credential.  Furthermore, dynamically partition policy evaluation based on the *provenance* of the contextual data – meaning, the trust level or source of each injected context influences *which* policies are applied.

**Specs:**

**1. Swarm Context Data Structure:**

```
Credential {
  PrincipalID: String,
  BasePermissions: [Permission],
  ContextSwarm: [
    {
      PrincipalID: String, //Principal contributing context
      Timestamp: DateTime,
      ContextData: { //Arbitrary data structure - JSON acceptable
        Key: String,
        Value: String
      },
      TrustScore: Float (0.0 - 1.0) //Determined by a trust authority
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Context Injection API:**

*   `POST /credential/{credentialID}/context`
    *   Request Body: `{ PrincipalID: String, ContextData: { Key: String, Value: String } }`
    *   Response: `{ Status: String, Message: String, TrustScore: Float }`
    *   Upon successful injection: The system *queries* a Trust Authority (see spec 4) to determine a `TrustScore` for the injecting Principal.

**3. Policy Partitioning Engine:**

*   During authentication/authorization:
    1.  Retrieve `Credential` and `ContextSwarm`.
    2.  Divide available policies into *tiers* based on required trust level (e.g., Tier 1: Requires TrustScore > 0.9, Tier 2: Requires TrustScore > 0.5, Tier 3: No Trust Requirement).
    3.  For each context entry in `ContextSwarm`:
        *   Identify applicable policies based on the `TrustScore` of the contributing Principal.
        *   Apply relevant policies to evaluate the request.
    4.  Combine the results of policy evaluation from all context entries to determine final authorization.

**4. Trust Authority Service:**

*   API: `GET /trust/{PrincipalID}`
    *   Response: `{ PrincipalID: String, TrustScore: Float }`
*   Implementation:  The Trust Authority can leverage various signals to determine `TrustScore`:
    *   Reputation systems (e.g., based on historical behavior).
    *   Certificate authorities.
    *   Attestation services (e.g., verifying device integrity).
    *   Risk scoring (based on geographic location, time of day, etc.).

**5. Dynamic Policy Definition:**

*   Policies must be definable with trust-level requirements. Example:

```json
{
  "PolicyID": "ResourceXAccess",
  "Resource": "ResourceX",
  "Action": "Read",
  "TrustLevel": 0.7, //Minimum TrustScore required to apply this policy
  "Condition": "ContextData.Location == 'InternalNetwork'"
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Adaptive Security:**  Adjust access controls based on the trustworthiness of different context providers.
*   **Federated Identity:** Allow multiple identity providers to contribute contextual data to a credential.
*   **Zero Trust Architecture:**  Enforce granular access control based on dynamic risk assessment.
