## Adaptive Entropy Profiling for Predictive Network Segmentation

**Concept:** Extend entropy-based anomaly detection to *proactively* segment network traffic based on dynamically calculated entropy profiles, creating micro-segments that isolate potential threats *before* they manifest as full-blown anomalies. This goes beyond simply *detecting* anomalies to *anticipating* and *containing* them.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Profile Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw network traffic data (packets, flows, etc.).
*   **Process:**
    *   Continuously calculate entropy for a wide range of network parameters *simultaneously* â€“ beyond those mentioned in the reference patent. Include:
        *   Packet size distribution.
        *   Inter-arrival times.
        *   TCP flag combinations.
        *   Application layer protocol usage.
        *   Geolocation data (if available).
        *   DNS query patterns.
    *   Establish a baseline "normal" entropy profile for each parameter. Utilize a rolling window average to adapt to legitimate traffic fluctuations.
    *   Track entropy *derivatives* (rate of change) for each parameter. This is critical for predictive analysis.
*   **Output:** Multi-dimensional entropy profile (vector) representing the current state of the network. Include timestamps to track changes over time.

**2. Predictive Segmentation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Current entropy profile, baseline entropy profile, entropy derivatives, configurable segmentation thresholds.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Anomaly Prediction:** Calculate a "risk score" for each network parameter based on:
        *   Deviation from baseline entropy.
        *   Rate of entropy change (derivative).
        *   Correlation with other parameters.
    *   **Dynamic Segmentation:** Based on risk scores, dynamically create network segments (micro-segments). Segments are defined by:
        *   Source/Destination IP addresses.
        *   Port numbers.
        *   Application protocols.
        *   User agents.
    *   **Segment Isolation:**  Isolate high-risk segments using:
        *   Traffic shaping (bandwidth limiting).
        *   Rate limiting.
        *   Deep packet inspection (DPI) and filtering.
        *   Connection termination.
    *   **Adaptive Thresholding:**  Adjust segmentation thresholds dynamically based on network load and historical data. Machine learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) can be used to optimize threshold settings.

**3. Entropy Correlation Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical entropy profiles, current entropy profiles, network event logs.
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify correlations between changes in entropy for different parameters.
    *   Build a "knowledge base" of entropy correlations associated with known attack types.
    *   Use this knowledge base to improve the accuracy of anomaly prediction and segmentation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Entropy Profile Generation
function generateEntropyProfile(networkTraffic):
  entropyProfile = {}
  for parameter in [packetSize, interArrivalTime, tcpFlags, protocolUsage, dnsQueries]:
    entropyProfile[parameter] = calculateEntropy(extractParameterData(networkTraffic, parameter))
  return entropyProfile

// Predictive Segmentation
function segmentNetwork(entropyProfile, baselineProfile, thresholds):
  segments = []
  for ipAddress in getIPAddresses(networkTraffic):
    riskScore = 0
    for parameter, entropy in entropyProfile.items():
      deviation = abs(entropy - baselineProfile[parameter])
      riskScore += deviation * getParameterWeight(parameter) //Assign weight to parameter
    if riskScore > thresholds['segmentationThreshold']:
      segments.append(createSegment(ipAddress))
  return segments

//Entropy Correlation
function updateCorrelationKnowledge(anomalyEvent, entropyProfile):
  //Store entropy profiles associated with anomalyEvent
  //Identify correlated entropy changes
  //Update correlationKnowledge database
  pass
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance multi-core processors.
*   Large amounts of RAM.
*   Fast network interfaces.
*   Dedicated hardware acceleration for entropy calculations.

**Future Extensions:**

*   Integration with threat intelligence feeds.
*   Automated response actions (e.g., blocking malicious IPs).
*   Visualization of entropy profiles for network security analysts.
*   Distributed entropy calculation across multiple network devices.
