## Adaptive Projection Privacy Shield

**Concept:** Expand upon the unauthorized viewer detection to create a localized, dynamic privacy shield *projected* onto the viewing space. Instead of merely dimming or obstructing the display, this system actively *shapes* the visible content to prevent viewing from unintended angles.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Ultra-short-throw projector integrated into the computing device (laptop, tablet, dedicated base unit).  Must support keystone correction & edge blending.
    *   Multiple infrared (IR) proximity/depth sensors (at least 4, strategically placed around display) – for real-time viewer position/orientation tracking.
    *   High-resolution camera (for initial calibration & image analysis).
    *   Processing unit dedicated to real-time projection mapping calculations.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Viewer Tracking Module:** Processes IR & camera data to identify potential unauthorized viewers – position, orientation (gaze direction not strictly required). Uses skeletal tracking where possible to improve accuracy & robustness.
    *   **Privacy Zone Calculation:** Defines a "privacy zone" surrounding the authorized viewer’s typical viewing position. This zone is dynamically adjusted based on user preferences & environmental factors.
    *   **Projection Mapping Engine:** Calculates the necessary distortions and masking patterns to effectively "block" the display from outside the privacy zone. This could involve:
        *   **Content Masking:** Projecting a dark, textured pattern onto the wall/surface surrounding the display, effectively creating a visual barrier.  The pattern would be dynamic, shifting to maintain the barrier as viewer positions change.
        *   **Adaptive Brightness Modulation:** Reducing brightness in specific areas *projected onto the surface around the display* to obscure content viewed from unintended angles.  This would rely on careful color/luminance blending to avoid creating obvious dark spots.
        *   **"Phantom Image" Generation:** Projecting a slightly distorted, subtly altered version of the displayed content onto the surrounding surfaces, creating visual confusion for unintended viewers. This would require significant processing power & careful content analysis.
    *   **User Interface:** Allows the user to:
        *   Define the sensitivity of the unauthorized viewer detection.
        *   Adjust the size and shape of the privacy zone.
        *   Select the type of privacy protection (masking, brightness modulation, phantom image).
        *   Customize the appearance of the projected privacy shield.
*   **Pseudocode (Privacy Zone Calculation & Projection Mapping):**

```
function calculatePrivacyZone(authorizedViewerPosition, sensitivity) {
  // Define base privacy zone (e.g., cone shape)
  baseZone = createCone(authorizedViewerPosition, viewingAngle, distance);

  // Adjust zone based on sensitivity
  expandedZone = expandCone(baseZone, sensitivity);

  return expandedZone;
}

function generateProjectionMap(unauthorizedViewerPosition, privacyZone, displayContent) {
  // Calculate vectors from display to unauthorized viewer & privacy zone boundaries
  vectors = calculateVectors(displayContent, unauthorizedViewerPosition, privacyZone);

  // Determine areas of display visible to unauthorized viewer
  visibleAreas = calculateVisibleAreas(vectors);

  // Create projection map:
  //   - Mask visibleAreas with dark texture.
  //   - Apply adaptive brightness modulation to areas near privacy zone boundaries.
  //   - (Optional) Generate phantom image based on display content and viewer position
  projectionMap = createProjectionMap(visibleAreas, projectionType);

  return projectionMap;
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  The system continuously monitors the environment for potential unauthorized viewers.
2.  When an unauthorized viewer is detected, the system calculates a projection map based on their position and the defined privacy zone.
3.  The projector dynamically alters the projected image to obscure the display content from the unauthorized viewer.
4.  The system adapts the projection map in real-time as the unauthorized viewer moves.
