**Adaptive Resource Partitioning via Dynamic Logic Remapping**

**Concept:** Extend the isolation techniques described in the patent to allow *dynamic* remapping of logic functions between the client and host domains, creating adaptive resource partitioning. This goes beyond simply isolating errant behavior; it actively shifts workload based on real-time system conditions and application needs.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Programmable Logic Device (PLD) – A single PLD (FPGA or similar) hosts both client and host domain logic. The PLD must support partial reconfiguration.
    *   High-Speed Interconnect – A dedicated, high-bandwidth interconnect between client and host domain logic within the PLD.
    *   Configuration Manager – Hardware/firmware module responsible for managing partial reconfiguration of the PLD.
    *   Monitoring Unit – A dedicated monitoring circuit (as in the patent) enhanced with performance metrics (latency, throughput, power consumption) specific to logical functions.
*   **Software:**
    *   Hypervisor Integration – The hypervisor must expose APIs for requesting and authorizing logic transfers between domains.
    *   Logic Transfer Manager – Software component responsible for packaging, transferring, and instantiating logic modules within the PLD.
    *   Performance Profiler – Application-level component that profiles workload characteristics and identifies functions suitable for transfer.
    *   Policy Engine – Defines rules for automatic logic transfer based on system load, application priorities, and security constraints.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Workload Profiling:** The Performance Profiler monitors application workload characteristics (e.g., function call frequency, execution time, data dependencies).
2.  **Transfer Decision:** The Policy Engine evaluates workload data, system load, and configured policies. If a logic transfer is beneficial (e.g., offloading a computationally intensive function from the client to the host), a transfer request is generated.
3.  **Authorization:** The hypervisor receives the transfer request and verifies authorization based on security policies.
4.  **Logic Packaging:** The Logic Transfer Manager packages the selected logic module (e.g., a hardware IP core) for transfer. This may involve compilation or optimization for the target PLD.
5.  **Dynamic Remapping:** The Configuration Manager initiates a partial reconfiguration of the PLD. This involves:
    *   Deallocating resources currently used by the logic module in the originating domain.
    *   Allocating resources in the target domain.
    *   Transferring the logic module to the target domain.
    *   Establishing communication pathways between the logic module and other components.
6.  **Runtime Monitoring:** The Monitoring Unit tracks the performance of the logic module in the new domain. This data is used to refine transfer policies and optimize resource allocation.

**Pseudocode (Configuration Manager – Partial Reconfiguration):**

```
function PartialReconfigure(logicModule, sourceDomain, targetDomain):
  // Validate parameters
  if (logicModule == null or sourceDomain == null or targetDomain == null):
    return ERROR

  // Acquire lock on PLD resources
  Lock(PLD_Resources)

  // Identify resources used by logicModule in sourceDomain
  resourceList = GetResourceList(logicModule, sourceDomain)

  // Deallocate resources in sourceDomain
  DeallocateResources(resourceList, sourceDomain)

  // Identify available resources in targetDomain
  availableResources = GetAvailableResources(targetDomain)

  // Check if sufficient resources are available
  if (availableResources.size() < resourceList.size()):
    // Log error and release lock
    LogError("Insufficient resources in target domain")
    ReleaseLock(PLD_Resources)
    return ERROR

  // Allocate resources in targetDomain
  allocatedResources = AllocateResources(availableResources, resourceList, targetDomain)

  // Transfer logicModule to targetDomain
  TransferLogic(logicModule, allocatedResources)

  // Establish communication pathways
  EstablishCommunication(logicModule, targetDomain)

  // Release lock
  ReleaseLock(PLD_Resources)

  return SUCCESS
```

**Innovation:** This design transcends simple isolation by enabling *dynamic* and intelligent resource partitioning. The system adapts to changing workloads and prioritizes critical functions, maximizing performance and resilience. It moves beyond error containment to *proactive* resource management. It also introduces a novel mechanism for partially reconfiguring hardware resources during runtime, offering greater flexibility and efficiency.
