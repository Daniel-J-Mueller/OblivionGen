## Predictive Pre-Fetching with Dynamic Granularity

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** "Anticipation Engine" â€“ A dedicated hardware module integrated with the memory controller.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Access History Table (AHT):* Stores recent access patterns, indexed by token. Each entry includes:
        *   Token
        *   Sequence of Accessed Memory Addresses
        *   Prediction Confidence Level (0-100)
        *   Granularity Level (see below)
    *   *Granularity Map:* Defines pre-fetch block sizes (e.g., 64B, 128B, 256B, 512B, 1KB).
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   *Coarse-Grained:* Prefetches based on large blocks, suitable for sequential access.
    *   *Medium-Grained:* Prefetches based on moderate blocks, for predictable stride access.
    *   *Fine-Grained:* Prefetches individual cache lines based on predicted accesses.
    *   *Adaptive:* Dynamically adjusts pre-fetch granularity based on prediction confidence.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Access Monitoring:** The Anticipation Engine monitors all memory access requests.  For each request with a token, it logs the accessed address in the AHT.
2.  **Pattern Recognition:** Continuously analyzes the logged addresses for each token to identify access patterns (sequential, stride, random).
3.  **Prediction Generation:**  Based on the identified pattern, predicts the next memory address(es) that will be accessed.
4.  **Granularity Selection:**
    *   If Prediction Confidence > 80%:  Fine-Grained pre-fetch (individual cache lines).
    *   If 60 < Prediction Confidence <= 80%: Medium-Grained pre-fetch (128B or 256B blocks).
    *   If Prediction Confidence <= 60%: Coarse-Grained pre-fetch (512B or 1KB blocks).
5.  **Pre-Fetch Initiation:** Issues pre-fetch requests to the memory controller based on the predicted address(es) and selected granularity.
6.  **Performance Feedback:** Monitors pre-fetch hit/miss rate. Adjusts prediction algorithms and granularity selection thresholds based on feedback.
7.  **Token Management:** If a token is inactive for a defined period, the corresponding AHT entry is discarded to free up resources.

**Pseudocode (Anticipation Engine):**

```
Initialization:
    AHT = Empty Table
    GranularityMap = {64B, 128B, 256B, 512B, 1KB}

OnMemoryAccess(token, address):
    If token in AHT:
        Update AHT entry with address
        Calculate prediction confidence level
        predictedAddress = PredictNextAddress(AHT[token])
        granularity = SelectGranularity(predictionConfidence)
        Prefetch(predictedAddress, granularity)
    Else:
        Create new AHT entry for token
        Add address to AHT entry

SelectGranularity(confidence):
    If confidence > 80: Return FineGrained
    If 60 < confidence <= 80: Return MediumGrained
    Return CoarseGrained

PredictNextAddress(AHTEntry):
    // Implement pattern recognition algorithm (e.g., stride detection, sequential prediction)
    // Return predicted address

Prefetch(address, granularity):
    // Issue prefetch request to memory controller for specified address and granularity
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated hardware accelerator for pattern recognition.
*   Fast access to AHT.
*   Low-latency communication with memory controller.
*   Configurable buffer size for pre-fetched data.
