## Adaptive Mesh Networking for Edge Device Resilience

**Specification:** Implement a dynamically configurable mesh network overlaid on top of existing client isolated virtual networks. This network leverages edge devices themselves as relay nodes, enhancing resilience and extending connectivity beyond direct reach of the IoT service’s private endpoints.

**Components:**

*   **Mesh Agent:** Software component deployed on each edge device within a client's isolated virtual network. This agent handles mesh network discovery, routing, and data forwarding.
*   **Connectivity Probe:** A background process within the Mesh Agent that periodically evaluates link quality to neighboring edge devices and the private endpoint.
*   **Dynamic Routing Table:**  A distributed routing table maintained by each Mesh Agent, updated based on Connectivity Probe results. Utilizes a cost function that prioritizes latency, bandwidth, and hop count.
*   **Traffic Shaper:** A component within the Mesh Agent that intelligently manages traffic flow, prioritizing critical data and adapting to network conditions.
*   **IoT Service Mesh Integration:** Modifications to the IoT Service to recognize and utilize the mesh network as a potential pathway for edge device connections.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Mesh Discovery:** Upon joining the isolated virtual network, each edge device's Mesh Agent initiates a discovery process to identify neighboring devices within radio range (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, etc.).
2.  **Topology Mapping:** The Mesh Agents collaboratively build a network topology map, sharing information about discovered neighbors and their signal strengths.
3.  **Route Calculation:**  Each Mesh Agent calculates the optimal route to the IoT Service’s private endpoint, considering the network topology, link quality, and cost function.
4.  **Data Forwarding:** When an edge device needs to communicate with the IoT Service, it forwards data packets through the mesh network using the calculated route.  Packets are dynamically routed based on real-time network conditions.
5.  **Adaptive Routing:** The Connectivity Probe continuously monitors link quality. If a link fails or becomes congested, the routing table is updated to reroute traffic through alternative paths.
6.  **IoT Service Awareness:** The IoT Service is configured to accept connections originating from both direct connections and through the mesh network. A trust mechanism verifies the authenticity of mesh-routed connections.

**Pseudocode (Connectivity Probe):**

```
function probe_connectivity()
    neighbors = scan_for_nearby_devices()
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        signal_strength = measure_signal_strength(neighbor)
        link_quality = evaluate_link_quality(signal_strength)
        update_routing_table(neighbor, link_quality)

    // Periodic evaluation of private endpoint connectivity
    endpoint_reachability = check_endpoint_reachability()
    update_routing_table(private_endpoint, endpoint_reachability)
end function
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Resilience:** The mesh network provides redundant pathways for communication, ensuring connectivity even if individual edge devices fail or experience intermittent connectivity.
*   **Extended Range:**  The mesh network extends the range of the IoT Service by leveraging edge devices as relay nodes, enabling connectivity in areas with poor signal coverage.
*   **Scalability:** The mesh network can scale to accommodate a large number of edge devices, automatically adapting to changes in network topology.
*   **Self-Healing:**  The dynamic routing capabilities enable the mesh network to automatically reroute traffic around failures and congestion, ensuring continuous connectivity.
