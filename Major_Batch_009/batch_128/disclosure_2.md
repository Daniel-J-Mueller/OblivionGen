## Dynamic Intent Weaving for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Expand the hierarchical NLU to not just *understand* intent, but to *predict* likely subsequent intents based on user behavior and external context. This creates a system that anticipates user needs and proactively offers assistance.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** “Anticipatory Layer” integrated *above* the existing hierarchical NLU.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   “Intent Graph”: A directed graph where nodes represent commands (from the existing hierarchy) and edges represent probabilistic transitions between them.  Edge weights are dynamically adjusted based on user session data (command sequences) and external context (time of day, location, calendar events).
    *   "Context Vectors": Multi-dimensional vectors representing user context, derived from data sources like location services, calendar apps, and system usage patterns.
*   **Processing Flow:**
    1.  **Base NLU:** The existing NLU processes the user’s query to identify the primary intent and entities.
    2.  **Context Vector Generation:** The system generates a context vector based on available data sources.
    3.  **Intent Prediction:**
        *   The system uses the identified primary intent as a starting node in the Intent Graph.
        *   It combines the starting node’s outgoing edge weights with the similarity between the context vector and the edge’s associated context (stored during graph construction).
        *   This results in a probability distribution over potential next intents.
        *   The top N intents (configurable) are selected as “predicted intents.”
    4.  **Proactive Assistance:**
        *   The system presents predicted intents to the user as suggestions *before* they explicitly ask. These could be presented as:
            *   Quick action buttons/chips.
            *   Auto-completion suggestions.
            *   Voice prompts (“Would you like to…?”).
        *   The system monitors user actions. If the user selects a predicted intent, its associated edge weight in the Intent Graph is increased, reinforcing the prediction. If the user ignores the prediction and performs a different action, the edge weight is decreased.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_next_intents(primary_intent, context_vector):
    predicted_intents = []
    for next_intent in Intent_Graph.neighbors(primary_intent):
        edge_weight = Intent_Graph.get_edge_weight(primary_intent, next_intent)
        context_similarity = cosine_similarity(context_vector, Intent_Graph.get_edge_context(primary_intent, next_intent))
        combined_score = edge_weight * context_similarity
        predicted_intents.append((next_intent, combined_score))

    predicted_intents.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return predicted_intents[:N]  // Top N predicted intents
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:** Requires additional memory for the Intent Graph and context vector storage.  May benefit from GPU acceleration for context similarity calculations, especially with large graphs and high user concurrency.
*   **Data Requirements:** Large dataset of user command sequences and associated context data for building and training the Intent Graph.  Continual learning mechanism to adapt the graph over time as user behavior evolves.
*   **Error Handling:**  Mechanism to detect and correct inaccurate predictions. This could involve a confidence threshold for predictions, or a feedback mechanism allowing users to explicitly indicate when a prediction was incorrect.
