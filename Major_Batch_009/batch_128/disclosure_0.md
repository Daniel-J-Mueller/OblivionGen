## Dynamic Visual Storytelling via Image Sequences

**Concept:** Extend the image selection process beyond single images to short, dynamic visual sequences – essentially miniature "stories" – designed to capture user attention and convey product information more effectively.

**Specs:**

*   **Sequence Generation:**  A system component creates short (2-5 second) video sequences by subtly animating product images. Animations could include:
    *   **Gentle Rotation:**  The product slowly rotates to showcase all angles.
    *   **Feature Highlights:**  Zooming in and out on key product features with brief visual cues (e.g., a sparkle effect).
    *   **Contextual Insertion:** Seamlessly inserting the product into a relevant scene (e.g., a chair in a living room, a watch on a wrist).  This would leverage a library of pre-rendered environments or utilize generative AI to create custom scenes.
*   **Sequence A/B Testing:**  The system automatically generates multiple sequence variations for each item. These variations differ in animation style, scene context, and feature emphasis. A/B testing is performed to determine which sequences perform best based on user engagement metrics.
*   **User Interaction & Sequencing:** Integrate user actions (e.g. mouse hovers, scrolls) to trigger different sequence variations or transitions between segments.
*   **Sequence Data Structure:**
    ```
    Sequence {
      itemID: string;
      segments: [
        {
          imageURL: string;
          animationType: enum (rotate, zoom, context);
          duration: float; // seconds
          transitionEffect: enum (fade, slide, wipe);
        }
      ];
      bestPerformingSegmentIndex: integer; //index to start with when serving sequence
    }
    ```
*   **Serving Logic:** When a user views an item, the system serves the associated sequence. The best-performing segment is initially served to reduce initial loading time. User interactions dynamically trigger alternate sequences, diversifying the viewing experience.
*   **Generative AI Integration:** Utilize AI to dynamically generate sequences based on product attributes and user preferences. For example, if a user frequently views outdoor gear, the AI could generate sequences showcasing the product in outdoor settings.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Leverage GPU processing for smooth animation playback and real-time sequence generation.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:** Ensure compatibility with web browsers, mobile apps, and other platforms.
*   **Sequence Metrics:** Track the following metrics to assess sequence effectiveness:
    *   Completion Rate: Percentage of users who watch the entire sequence.
    *   Engagement Time: Average time users spend watching the sequence.
    *   Click-Through Rate: Percentage of users who click on the item after watching the sequence.
    *   Conversion Rate: Percentage of users who purchase the item after watching the sequence.
    *   User Feedback: Collect user ratings and comments on the sequences.
