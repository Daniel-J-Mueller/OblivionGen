## Dynamic Acoustic Shadowing

**Concept:** Utilize phased array microphone technology coupled with real-time audio analysis to create a localized “acoustic shadow” that actively suppresses the re-recording of output audio by the device’s microphone, *before* it reaches the input stage. This goes beyond simply disabling the microphone; it *shapes* the sound field.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Microphone Array: A circular array of at least 16 high-sensitivity microphones integrated into the device housing.  Spacing between microphones: 2cm.
    *   Digital Signal Processor (DSP): Dedicated DSP chip with a clock speed of 1 GHz or higher.
    *   Amplifiers: Low-noise amplifiers for each microphone element.
    *   Acoustic Dampening Material: Internal dampening material to minimize reflections within the device.
*   **Software:**
    *   Beamforming Algorithm: Real-time beamforming algorithm capable of steering nulls (areas of minimal sensitivity) in the direction of the device's speakers.  Algorithm: Delay-and-Sum beamforming with adaptive weighting.
    *   Audio Analysis Module:  Module to analyze outgoing audio in real-time, identifying the characteristics of the spoken words (frequency, amplitude, etc.).
    *   Null Steering Control:  Control logic to dynamically adjust the direction and shape of the acoustic nulls based on the audio analysis.
    *   Adaptive Filtering:  Filters to remove ambient noise and improve the accuracy of the beamforming.
    *   Triggering Mechanism:  Based on metadata received (as in the supplied patent), or internal wakeword detection, initiate the dynamic acoustic shadowing.
*   **Operational Procedure:**
    1.  Upon receiving metadata indicating audio output (or internal wakeword detection), the system activates the microphone array and the audio analysis module.
    2.  The audio analysis module analyzes the outgoing audio, characterizing the waveform.
    3.  The null steering control calculates the optimal direction and shape of the acoustic nulls to minimize the re-recording of the outgoing audio by the microphone array.  Calculation frequency: 10ms.
    4.  The DSP applies the beamforming algorithm, steering the acoustic nulls in the calculated direction.
    5.  The DSP continuously monitors the incoming audio signal from the microphone array and adjusts the beamforming parameters in real-time to maintain the acoustic shadow.
    6.  Once the output audio has ceased (or a timeout period has elapsed), the system deactivates the microphone array and the audio analysis module.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize microphone array and DSP

ON metadata_received OR wakeword_detected:
    activate_microphone_array()
    activate_audio_analysis_module()

    WHILE audio_is_playing:
        analyze_audio() // Get frequency, amplitude, waveform characteristics
        calculate_null_steering_parameters(audio_characteristics)
        apply_beamforming(null_steering_parameters)
        monitor_incoming_audio()
        adjust_beamforming_parameters() // Real-time adjustment loop

    deactivate_microphone_array()
    deactivate_audio_analysis_module()
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply disabling the microphone. It *actively shapes* the sound field to prevent re-recording, creating a localized zone of silence around the device’s speakers.  This is far more robust than passive methods. It's a proactive, rather than reactive, solution.
