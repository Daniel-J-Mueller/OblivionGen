## Dynamic Attribute Synthesis & Predictive Filtering

**Concept:** Extend the ability to dynamically *create* attributes from unstructured data, and proactively filter items *before* a user even searches, based on learned user preferences and global trend analysis. This goes beyond simply *extracting* existing attributes; it actively *synthesizes* new, potentially useful characteristics.

**Specifications:**

**1. Synthesis Engine:**

*   **Input:** Unstructured item information (textual descriptions, images, videos – as per the provided patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a multi-modal AI model (LLM + Computer Vision) to identify relationships between features within item data.
    *   Utilize a knowledge graph to map identified features to potential 'synthetic attributes'.  Example:  If many items are described as “vintage” and have “floral patterns”, synthesize an attribute “Romantic Aesthetic”.
    *   A "Novelty Score" algorithm assesses how unique each synthesized attribute is across the catalog. High novelty attributes are prioritized.
    *   The Synthesis Engine operates continuously, updating synthetic attributes as new item data becomes available.
*   **Output:**  A list of synthesized attributes with associated novelty scores and confidence levels. These are stored alongside existing structured data.

**2. Predictive Filtering Module:**

*   **Input:** User profile (purchase history, browsing behavior, saved items), Global Trend Data (social media, news, sales data), Catalog Data (existing and synthesized attributes).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Preference Modeling:** Employ a collaborative filtering and content-based filtering hybrid to build a user preference model.
    *   **Trend Analysis:**  Identify emerging trends from global data sources.
    *   **Proactive Filtering:** *Before* a user enters a search query, the system proactively filters the catalog based on:
        *   Predicted user preferences.
        *   Relevant emerging trends.
        *   A "Serendipity Factor" – a controlled randomness element to introduce unexpected but potentially interesting items.
    *   The Predictive Filtering Module dynamically adjusts the filtered catalog in real-time, based on user interaction and trend updates.
*   **Output:** A dynamically filtered catalog displayed to the user, prioritizing items predicted to be of interest.

**3. User Interface Integration:**

*   **"Discover" Tab:** A dedicated tab showcasing items identified by the Predictive Filtering Module.
*   **Dynamic Attribute Facets:** New facets automatically created for synthesized attributes, allowing users to refine their searches.
*   **“Why am I seeing this?” Explanation:**  Provide a clear explanation of why an item is being displayed to the user (e.g., “Based on your past purchases and the current trend for ‘Coastal Living’”).
*   **Feedback Mechanism:**  Allow users to provide feedback on the relevance of displayed items, further refining the preference model.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Filtering):**

```
// UserProfile: Purchase history, browsing data, saved items
// GlobalTrends: Data from social media, news, sales
// Catalog: Items with structured and synthesized attributes

function filterCatalog(UserProfile, GlobalTrends, Catalog) {

    // 1. Predict User Preferences
    PredictedPreferences = Predict(UserProfile, Catalog)

    // 2. Identify Relevant Trends
    RelevantTrends = IdentifyTrends(GlobalTrends, Catalog)

    // 3. Calculate Relevance Score for each item
    for each item in Catalog {
        RelevanceScore = 0
        // Preference Matching
        for each preference in PredictedPreferences {
            if (item has attribute matching preference) {
                RelevanceScore += PreferenceWeight
            }
        }
        // Trend Matching
        for each trend in RelevantTrends {
            if (item has attribute matching trend) {
                RelevanceScore += TrendWeight
            }
        }
        // Serendipity Factor (Randomness)
        RelevanceScore += Random(0, SerendipityWeight)

        item.RelevanceScore = RelevanceScore
    }

    // 4. Sort Items by Relevance Score
    SortedCatalog = Sort(Catalog, RelevanceScore, Descending)

    return SortedCatalog
}
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond attribute extraction to attribute *creation*, coupled with proactive filtering.  It anticipates user needs *before* a search, rather than simply responding to queries. The dynamic attribute generation and integration into a predictive filtering system represents a significant departure from existing catalog search methodologies.
