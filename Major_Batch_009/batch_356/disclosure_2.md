## Adaptive Time Granularity for Network Devices

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on redundancy and convergence of time sources. This builds on that by proposing *dynamic* adjustment of time granularity based on network role and observed time variance. Not all devices *need* nanosecond accuracy.

**Specification:**

**I. System Architecture:**

1.  **Time Granularity Profiles:** Define pre-configured time granularity levels:
    *   **Level 1 (High Precision):**  < 10ns – For critical timing applications (financial trading, high-frequency data logging).
    *   **Level 2 (Medium Precision):** < 100ns – For standard server operations, database timestamps.
    *   **Level 3 (Low Precision):** < 1ms – For monitoring, logging, and less time-sensitive applications.
2.  **Variance Monitoring Agent (VMA):**  A software agent running on each network device.
    *   Continuously monitors the variance between received time signals from the multiple grand masters (as per the base patent).
    *   Calculates a rolling average of time variance.
    *   Determines a ‘stability score’ based on variance and stability score is between 0 and 1.
3.  **Granularity Adjustment Module (GAM):**  A module responsible for adjusting the time granularity based on the stability score and device role.
    *   Device roles are configurable (e.g., “critical server”, “monitoring node”, “storage array”).
    *   GAM applies a predefined mapping between device role, stability score, and target time granularity level.  Example:
        *   Critical Server & Stability Score > 0.9: Level 1
        *   Critical Server & 0.5 < Stability Score < 0.9: Level 2
        *   Monitoring Node: Level 3 (always)
4. **Time Source Prioritization:** The GAM will prioritize Time Sources according to configurable factors.

**II.  Pseudocode (GAM):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION DetermineGranularity(deviceRole, stabilityScore)
  IF deviceRole == "critical server" THEN
    IF stabilityScore > 0.9 THEN
      RETURN "Level 1"
    ELSE IF stabilityScore > 0.5 THEN
      RETURN "Level 2"
    ELSE
      RETURN "Level 3"
    END IF
  ELSE IF deviceRole == "monitoring node" THEN
    RETURN "Level 3"
  ELSE // Default
    RETURN "Level 2"
  END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ApplyGranularity(targetGranularity)
  // Configure the time synchronization protocol (PTP/NTP)
  // to use the specified granularity.
  // This might involve adjusting the message intervals,
  // filtering parameters, or data representation.
END FUNCTION

// Main Loop
WHILE TRUE DO
  stabilityScore = GetStabilityScore() // From VMA
  deviceRole = GetDeviceRole()
  targetGranularity = DetermineGranularity(deviceRole, stabilityScore)
  ApplyGranularity(targetGranularity)
  WAIT(60 seconds) // Adjust as needed
END WHILE
```

**III.  Implementation Notes:**

*   **Protocol Adaptation:** Requires modification of PTP/NTP implementations to support configurable granularity levels.
*   **Hardware Considerations:** High-precision timing may require specialized hardware (e.g., high-resolution timers, precise oscillators).
*   **Security:** Secure the VMA and GAM to prevent malicious manipulation of time granularity.
*  **Time Source Diversity:** Implement a mechanism that detects the potential loss of a Time Source, and dynamically updates accordingly.
