## Dynamic Contextual Symbol Expansion

**Concept:** Extend the byte-pair encoding (BPE) system to incorporate dynamic contextual symbols derived from a rolling window of recent user input *beyond* the immediate search query. This allows for a more nuanced and predictive encoding, especially beneficial for conversational translation or rapidly evolving jargon.

**Specs:**

1.  **Context Window:** Implement a configurable rolling window (e.g., last 10-20 user inputs/utterances) stored in memory associated with the user session. This window acts as a dynamic context source.

2.  **Context Symbol Generation:** 
    *   Analyze the context window to identify frequent n-grams (sequences of *n* words/symbols).
    *   Generate *contextual symbols* representing these frequent n-grams. The frequency threshold for symbol creation is configurable.
    *   Assign unique IDs to these contextual symbols.

3.  **Dynamic Encoding Integration:**
    *   Before encoding a user query, analyze it against the current context window.
    *   If portions of the query match generated contextual symbols, replace those portions with the corresponding symbol ID. 
    *   This effectively "compresses" the query by leveraging contextual knowledge.

4.  **Decoding with Context:**
    *   During decoding, the system must access the current context associated with the user. 
    *   Symbol IDs are replaced with the corresponding n-gram derived from the current context.

5. **Contextual Symbol Decay:** Implement a decay mechanism for contextual symbols.  Less frequent or older n-grams should have their associated symbols removed or downgraded in priority to prevent the context from becoming stale or overloaded.

6. **Adaptive Thresholding:** Automatically adjust the frequency threshold for generating contextual symbols based on the rate of new input and the diversity of language used by the user.

**Pseudocode (Encoding):**

```
function encodeWithContext(query, contextWindow, symbolMap):
  // 1. Identify frequent n-grams in contextWindow
  frequentNgrams = findFrequentNgrams(contextWindow, threshold)

  // 2. Update symbolMap with new ngrams, or update existing
  updateSymbolMap(symbolMap, frequentNgrams)

  // 3. Tokenize the query
  tokens = tokenize(query)

  // 4. Replace tokens with symbols where possible
  encodedTokens = []
  for token in tokens:
    if token in symbolMap:
      encodedTokens.append(symbolMap[token])
    else:
      encodedTokens.append(token) // Keep original if not in symbolMap
  return encodedTokens
```

**Pseudocode (Decoding):**

```
function decodeWithContext(encodedTokens, contextWindow, symbolMap):
  decodedTokens = []
  for token in encodedTokens:
    if token in symbolMap.values():
      // Find key for value
      key = [k for k, v in symbolMap.items() if v == token][0]
      decodedTokens.append(key)
    else:
      decodedTokens.append(token)
  return " ".join(decodedTokens)
```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   Increased memory requirements to store the context window and symbol map.
*   Potential need for faster processing to analyze the context window and perform symbol replacement.
