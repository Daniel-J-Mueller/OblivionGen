## Dynamic Issue Tagging & Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Expand upon the tokenized messaging system to create a dynamic issue tagging and predictive routing system. Instead of solely relying on a pre-defined issue category, analyze the *content* of the reply messages to refine and update the issue tag *in real-time*. This allows for more granular routing and potentially proactive solutions.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine:** Integrate an NLP engine (e.g., BERT, GPT-3, or a custom-trained model) into the reply message processing pipeline.
*   **Component 2: Dynamic Tagging Module:** This module receives the text of the reply message and utilizes the NLP engine to extract keywords, sentiment, and intent. It then assigns weighted tags representing different issue facets.
*   **Component 3: Tag Weighting & Refinement:**  A system for dynamically adjusting the weight of each tag based on subsequent messages. Early messages contribute more strongly to initial tagging, but later messages refine the tags. (e.g.,  A first message might heavily influence a tag for "Billing Issue", but a follow-up clarifies it’s specifically a “Dispute over late fee”, refining the tag).
*   **Component 4: Routing Engine:** Utilize the dynamically weighted tags to route the message to the most appropriate specialist or support queue.  Routing decisions are *not* fixed by the initial issue category.
*   **Component 5: Proactive Resolution Module:** Based on the identified tags and patterns, trigger proactive actions, such as providing relevant knowledge base articles, offering self-service options, or automatically escalating to a specialist.
*   **Component 6: Feedback Loop:** Implement a mechanism for specialists to validate or correct the dynamically assigned tags, providing feedback to improve the NLP model's accuracy.
*   **Component 7: Token Extension:** Extend the token to include a version number representing the current tag set. This facilitates A/B testing of different tagging models.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Upon receiving reply message to tokenized address:
message_text = extract_message_text(reply_message)
tags = analyze_message_text(message_text, NLP_Model) //returns list of tags with weights

//Combine initial issue category with dynamic tags, prioritizing dynamic tags
combined_tags = merge_tags(initial_issue_category, tags)

routing_destination = determine_destination(combined_tags, routing_rules)

proactive_actions = trigger_actions(combined_tags, action_rules)

update_token(token, combined_tags) //Include tag set version

forward_message(message, routing_destination)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Tag:** {tag_name: string, weight: float, category: string}
*   **Token:** {token_id: string, user_id: string, issue_category: string, tags: [Tag], version: int}

**Potential Innovations:**

*   **Predictive Tagging:**  Train a machine learning model to *predict* future tags based on message history.
*   **Automated Knowledge Base Updates:**  Automatically identify common issues and suggest updates to the knowledge base.
*   **Personalized Support Experiences:** Use the dynamic tags to tailor the support experience to the individual user's needs.
