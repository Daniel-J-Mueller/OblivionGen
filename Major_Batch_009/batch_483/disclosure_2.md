## Predictive Seller Bundling & Dynamic Pricing

**Concept:** Expand the prediction model to not only forecast item quantity acquisition based on shipping option & destination, but to *proactively suggest* bundled items and dynamically adjust pricing *before* the seller commits to a shipping/offer configuration. This aims to maximize overall revenue by intelligently influencing buyer behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Integration:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Historical Sales Data (as per original patent)
    *   Product Catalog Data (features, cost, margin, associated products)
    *   Real-time Competitor Pricing (scraped from public sources, APIs)
    *   Buyer Demographics (if available, anonymized, aggregated) - destination region based.
    *   Current Inventory Levels.
*   **Processing:** Data cleansing, normalization, feature engineering. Combine historical sales data with product catalog information to create a comprehensive dataset.

**2. Enhanced ML Model:**

*   **Architecture:** Utilize a multi-layered neural network. The core network from the original patent will be the foundation. Add a branching architecture to predict:
    *   **Bundle Affinity:** Probability that a buyer acquiring *item A* will *also* acquire *item B* (based on historical co-purchases, item features, buyer demographics).
    *   **Price Elasticity:** Sensitivity of demand for *item A* to price changes, segmented by destination and shipping option.
*   **Training:** Train the model on the expanded dataset. Utilize reinforcement learning to optimize bundle recommendations and pricing strategies. Reward function: maximize predicted revenue (quantity * price â€“ cost).

**3. Seller Interface Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Bundling Panel:**
    *   Display a list of recommended bundles for the selected item, ranked by predicted revenue contribution.
    *   Each bundle displays:
        *   Bundle Components (Item A + Item B)
        *   Predicted Revenue Increase (vs. selling Item A alone)
        *   Cost of Goods Sold (for the bundle)
        *   Margin Percentage.
    *   Seller can accept/reject recommendations, adjust bundle composition, or override predicted pricing.
*   **Dynamic Pricing Slider:**
    *   Allow the seller to adjust the price of the item (or bundle) within a recommended range.
    *   Real-time feedback on predicted quantity acquisition at different price points, segmented by destination and shipping option.
    *   Visual representation of the price-quantity curve.
*   **"What-If" Analysis:**  Enable the seller to simulate the impact of different bundle configurations and pricing strategies on predicted revenue.
*   **Automated Offer Creation:**  Option to automatically create offers based on the seller's preferred bundle configuration, pricing strategy, and shipping options.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices:** Deploy the enhanced ML model and the new UI components as microservices.
*   **API Gateway:** Provide a unified API for accessing the system's functionality.
*   **Real-time Data Pipeline:**  Process real-time data (competitor pricing, inventory levels) and update the ML model accordingly.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of sellers and products.



**Pseudocode (Bundle Recommendation):**

```
FUNCTION recommend_bundles(item_id, destination_region, shipping_option):
  // Fetch item features
  item_features = get_item_features(item_id)

  // Fetch historical co-purchase data
  co_purchase_data = get_co_purchase_data(item_id, destination_region)

  // Predict bundle affinity for each potential bundle
  bundle_affinities = []
  FOR each potential_bundle_item in potential_bundle_items:
    bundle_affinity = predict_bundle_affinity(item_features, potential_bundle_item.features, destination_region)
    bundle_affinities.append((potential_bundle_item, bundle_affinity))

  // Sort bundles by predicted affinity
  sorted_bundles = sort_bundles(bundle_affinities, descending=True)

  // Recommend top N bundles
  return sorted_bundles[:N]
```
