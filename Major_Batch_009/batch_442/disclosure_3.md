## Automated Predictive Test Case Generation via Feature Dependency Mapping

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the core concept of impact analysis but extends it significantly by *proactively generating* test cases, rather than just defining a test *plan* based on existing information. It focuses on understanding *how* features interact, and predicting likely failure points due to modifications.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Feature Dependency Graph (FDG) Builder:** 
    *   **Input:** Codebase (static analysis), historical bug reports, user behavior data (telemetry, usage logs), and existing test suites.
    *   **Process:**  The FDG Builder automatically constructs a graph representing the relationships between software features. This graph isn't simply a "calls" relationship; it identifies *functional dependencies*.  For instance, feature A *requires* feature B to be functioning correctly for a specific use case.  The weight of an edge between features represents the strength of the dependency (based on frequency of co-occurrence in user behavior and historical data).
    *   **Output:** A weighted Feature Dependency Graph (FDG).

2.  **Modification Impact Analyzer:**
    *   **Input:** Code diffs (representing the software modification), the FDG.
    *   **Process:**  This component analyzes the code diff and identifies the features directly affected by the modification.  Critically, it then *propagates* the impact through the FDG. For example, if a modification to feature X impacts feature Y, and feature Y is a strong dependency of feature Z, the Analyzer flags feature Z as potentially impacted, even if the code diff doesn’t directly touch it.  It assigns an impact score to each potentially affected feature, based on the distance from the original modification and the weight of the connecting edges.
    *   **Output:**  A list of potentially impacted features, each with an impact score.

3.  **Predictive Test Case Generator:**
    *   **Input:** List of impacted features (with impact scores), historical bug reports, feature specifications, and the FDG.
    *   **Process:** This is the core of the system.  It uses a combination of techniques to generate new test cases:
        *   **Bug Pattern Matching:**  The system searches historical bug reports for patterns associated with the impacted features. If similar bugs have occurred before, it generates test cases designed to reproduce and verify fixes.
        *   **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) & Equivalence Partitioning:** Uses feature specifications to automatically generate test cases for edge cases and valid/invalid input combinations.
        *   **Dependency-Driven Test Case Generation:**  Focuses on the dependencies identified in the FDG.  Generates test cases that specifically target the interaction between the modified feature and its dependent features. These test cases might involve complex scenarios that wouldn’t be obvious from simply looking at the code diff.  The impact score dictates the thoroughness of tests generated. High impact means more thoroughness.
        *   **AI-Assisted Test Generation:** Utilize a trained LLM, fine tuned on internal codebase, to generate test cases based on impact scores and the FDG.
    *   **Output:** A set of newly generated test cases.

4.  **Test Prioritization Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Generated test cases, existing test suite, impact scores.
    *   **Process:**  The Engine prioritizes the generated test cases based on their potential impact. High-impact tests are executed first.  It also integrates the generated tests with the existing test suite.
    *   **Output:** Prioritized test suite.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Test Case Generation (Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateTestCases(impactedFeatures, featureDependencyGraph, historicalBugs, featureSpecs):
  testCases = []

  FOR EACH feature IN impactedFeatures:
    // Bug Pattern Matching
    bugReports = GetBugReportsForFeature(feature)
    FOR EACH bugReport IN bugReports:
      testCases.add(GenerateTestCaseFromBugReport(bugReport))

    // Boundary Value Analysis & Equivalence Partitioning
    testCases.addAll(GenerateBVATestCases(featureSpecs[feature]))

    // Dependency-Driven Tests
    dependentFeatures = GetDependentFeatures(feature, featureDependencyGraph)
    FOR EACH dependentFeature IN dependentFeatures:
      testCases.addAll(GenerateInteractionTestCases(feature, dependentFeature))

    //AI Assisted
    testCases.addAll(GenerateAITestCases(feature, featureDependencyGraph, historicalBugs))

  RETURN testCases
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Feature Dependency Graph (FDG):**  A graph database (e.g., Neo4j) or adjacency matrix. Nodes represent features; edges represent dependencies with associated weights.
*   **Feature Specification:** A structured representation of the feature's behavior and input/output parameters (e.g., JSON schema, Protobuf).
*   **Historical Bug Report:** A structured database containing bug descriptions, severity, root cause, and associated features.

**Deployment:**

Integrated into CI/CD pipeline. Automated execution of generated tests after each code commit.  Feedback loop to update the FDG and improve test generation accuracy.
