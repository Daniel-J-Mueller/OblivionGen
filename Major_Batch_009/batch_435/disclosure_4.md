**Decentralized Reputation System for Voter Eligibility & Auditability**

**Concept:** Expand the access token system beyond simple vote submission authorization to a fully decentralized reputation system built on a blockchain, influencing voter eligibility and providing a verifiable audit trail of participation & vetting.

**Specs:**

*   **Reputation Token (RT) Generation:** Upon initial registration (as per claim 3), instead of *just* an access token, generate a small amount of Reputation Tokens (RTs). RTs are non-transferable and reside solely within the user’s blockchain address.
*   **Voter Tiering:** Define voter tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) based on RT balance. Higher tiers grant increased voting weight or access to specific polls/initiatives. Initial tier is Bronze, assigned upon registration.
*   **Reputation Gain/Loss Mechanics:**
    *   **Civic Engagement:** RTs awarded for verified participation in civic duties *outside* of direct voting (e.g., attending town halls – verified via location services and biometric confirmation, completing validated educational modules about policy, reporting misinformation – with peer/expert review).
    *   **Accurate Prediction Markets:** Integrate prediction markets tied to election outcomes. Users staking RTs on correct predictions earn more RTs. Incorrect predictions result in RT loss. This encourages informed participation.
    *   **Peer Review of Civic Data:** Users earn RTs by reviewing and validating submitted civic information (e.g., fact-checking claims made by candidates).
    *   **Malicious Activity Penalties:** Detected instances of voter fraud, misinformation spreading, or abuse result in significant RT loss, potentially dropping the user to a lower tier or revoking voting privileges.
*   **Dynamic Eligibility Threshold:** Voting eligibility isn’t static. A minimum RT balance (and therefore tier) might be *required* to participate in specific polls. This ensures a baseline of engaged, informed voters. The threshold can be adjusted dynamically by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).
*   **Verifiable Audit Trail:** All RT transactions, civic engagement records, and prediction market stakes are immutably recorded on the blockchain. This creates a transparent, auditable trail of voter eligibility and participation.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** Modify claim 3’s registration process to include RT generation & initial assignment. Claims 4 & 5 can be extended to incorporate RT tier checks before authorization. Claim 11 can be adjusted to include RT tier verification.
*   **Pseudocode (Registration):**

```
function registerUser(clientDevice, registrationData):
    // Existing registration checks (claim 3)
    if (registrationValid(registrationData)):
        userAccount = createUserAccount(registrationData)
        initialRT = 10 // Initial Reputation Token allocation
        generateRT(userAccount, initialRT)
        userTier = determineTier(initialRT) // Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum
        assignTier(userAccount, userTier)
        generateAccessToken(userAccount)
        return accessToken
    else:
        return "Registration Failed"
```

*   **Pseudocode (Vote Submission):**

```
function submitVote(clientDevice, voteData, accessToken):
    if (validateAccessToken(accessToken)):
        userAccount = getUserAccount(accessToken)
        userTier = getUserTier(userAccount)
        voteWeight = calculateVoteWeight(userTier) // Tier impacts vote weight
        ciphertext = encryptVote(voteData)
        signature = signCiphertext(ciphertext)
        // Existing signature verification (claim 1)
        if (verifySignature(ciphertext, signature)):
            storeCiphertext(ciphertext)
            updateBlockchain(ciphertext)
            updateUserState(userAccount)
            recordVoteWeight(ciphertext, voteWeight) // Record weight on blockchain
            return "Vote Submitted"
        else:
            return "Signature Invalid"
    else:
        return "Access Token Invalid"
```

This system incentivizes informed civic participation, creates a more robust and verifiable voting process, and adds a layer of accountability to the electorate.
