**Dynamic Style Transfer via Neural Texture Synthesis**

**Concept:** Extend the image enhancement patent by moving beyond simple patch matching and modification to a system capable of dynamically transferring the *style* of exemplar images onto captured images, creating novel visual aesthetics. This isn't merely adjusting color or sharpness, but fundamentally altering the texture and artistic 'feel' of the image.

**Specs:**

1.  **Exemplar Library:** A database of high-resolution images categorized by artistic style (e.g., Impressionism, Cubism, Watercolor, Digital Painting, specific artist styles).  Each exemplar image has associated metadata describing its dominant textures, color palettes, and artistic techniques.

2.  **Neural Texture Synthesis Engine:** A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a massive dataset of artistic images. The CNN learns to extract and reproduce the textures and stylistic elements present in the exemplar images. Specifically, a StyleGAN architecture is preferred, capable of generating highly realistic and diverse textures.

3.  **Semantic Segmentation:** Before style transfer, the captured image undergoes semantic segmentation, identifying objects and regions (e.g., sky, trees, buildings, people). This allows for targeted style transfer, applying different styles to different parts of the image.  A Mask R-CNN model is proposed.

4.  **Style Mixing & Blending:**  The system allows for mixing multiple styles. A user can specify a weighted combination of styles, creating unique aesthetic blends.  The blending process is handled by the neural texture synthesis engine, which interpolates between the style representations.

5.  **Real-time Performance:**  Optimization for real-time performance on mobile devices. This requires model quantization, pruning, and hardware acceleration (e.g., using the Neural Engine on Apple devices or similar on Android).

6.  **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface for selecting styles, adjusting blending weights, and previewing the results.  Sliders and visual previews are essential.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function applyStyleTransfer(image, styleList, weightList):
  // styleList and weightList are lists of style names and weights
  segmentationMap = performSemanticSegmentation(image)

  for each region in segmentationMap:
    combinedStyle = createCombinedStyle(styleList, weightList)
    textureMap = generateTextureMap(combinedStyle) // using StyleGAN

    applyTextureToRegion(image, region, textureMap)

  return stylizedImage
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Massive dataset of artistic images (millions of images).
*   Metadata describing the artistic styles and techniques used in each image.
*   Labeled data for semantic segmentation.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Mobile photo editing app with advanced artistic filters.
*   Creating unique visual effects for video games and movies.
*   Generating artwork based on user input.
*   Virtual reality and augmented reality experiences.
