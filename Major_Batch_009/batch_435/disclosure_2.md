## Adaptive Haptic Notification System - Vehicle Occupant

**System Overview:**

This system augments in-vehicle messaging/notification filtering (as described in the patent) with a localized, adaptive haptic feedback system integrated into vehicle seating. Rather than *only* filtering what is presented visually or audibly, it prioritizes information delivery *through touch*, using patterns and intensity to convey message urgency and type *without requiring conscious visual or auditory attention from the driver/occupant.*

**Core Components:**

1.  **Haptic Actuator Network:** An array of micro-actuators embedded within driver/passenger seat surfaces (back, seat pan, armrests). These actuators are capable of generating localized pressure variations, vibrations, and thermal changes.  Density will vary based on seat region (higher density in lumbar/shoulder regions for stronger, more defined patterns).
2.  **Biometric Sensor Integration:** Seat-integrated sensors monitor occupant physiological state: heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance (GSR), muscle tension (EMG). This data informs the adaptive intensity and pattern selection of haptic notifications.
3.  **Contextual Awareness Module:**  Integrates data from:
    *   Vehicle sensors (speed, acceleration, steering angle, ADAS status).
    *   Environmental sensors (weather, traffic).
    *   Occupant calendar/scheduled events.
    *   Existing message prioritization algorithms (from the referenced patent).
4.  **Haptic Mapping Engine:**  The core of the system. Translates message priority, context, and occupant state into specific haptic patterns. 
    *   **Urgency Encoding:**  High priority/urgent messages = rapid, high-intensity vibrations/pressure changes focused on the lumbar region. Low priority = subtle, slow patterns in peripheral areas (e.g., seat bolsters).
    *   **Message Type Encoding:** Distinct patterns for different message types:
        *   Critical System Alerts (e.g., collision warning) = Strong, pulsating pressure on both lumbar regions.
        *   Navigation Updates = Gentle, directional vibrations mimicking turn signals.
        *   Incoming Calls/Texts =  Rhythmic tapping on the shoulder area.
        *   Calendar Reminders = Slow, wave-like patterns across the seat.
5.  **Adaptive Learning Algorithm:**  Utilizes machine learning to personalize haptic patterns based on occupant responses.  Monitors occupant reaction times to different patterns (via EMG) and adjusts the mapping to optimize clarity and minimize distraction.  A ‘training’ mode will allow occupants to customize patterns for specific message types.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Engine):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(message, occupantState, vehicleContext) {
  priority = message.priorityScore // From existing patent filtering

  if (priority > 0.8) { //Critical Alert
    pattern = createCriticalAlertPattern()
    intensity = adjustIntensity(occupantState.HRV, vehicleContext.speed) //Reduce intensity at high speeds/stress
    applyPattern(pattern, intensity, lumbarRegions)
  } else if (priority > 0.5) { // Medium Priority (Navigation, Calendar)
    if (message.type == "navigation") {
      pattern = createDirectionalPattern(turnDirection)
      applyPattern(pattern, moderateIntensity, shoulderRegions)
    } else if (message.type == "calendar") {
      pattern = createWavePattern()
      applyPattern(pattern, lowIntensity, seatPan)
    }
  } else { // Low Priority (SMS, Email)
    pattern = createSimpleTapPattern()
    applyPattern(pattern, veryLowIntensity, seatBolsters)
  }
}

function adjustIntensity(HRV, speed) {
  //HRV represents stress level (lower HRV = higher stress)
  //Speed represents vehicle velocity
  intensity = baseIntensity * (1 - (HRV / maxHRV)) * (1 - (speed / maxSpeed))
  return intensity
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Power consumption of haptic actuators.
*   Durability and comfort of embedded actuators.
*   Integration with existing vehicle electrical systems.
*   Software architecture for real-time pattern generation and adaptation.
*   Data privacy considerations for biometric sensor data.
