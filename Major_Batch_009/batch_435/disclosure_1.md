## Adaptive Encoding Prioritization Based on Perceptual Quality Metrics

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple synchronization and priority switching between encoders to dynamically adjust encoding priorities *within* a single stream based on real-time perceptual quality assessment. Instead of just switching *which* encoderâ€™s output is prioritized, we modulate the priority weighting *between* encoded layers generated by potentially multiple encoders or within a single scalable encoder.

**Specs:**

1.  **Perceptual Quality Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Encoded video streams (potentially from multiple encoders).
    *   Function: Continuously analyze the encoded streams using a no-reference perceptual quality metric (e.g., VMAF, SSIM). These metrics provide a score representing the perceived visual quality without needing a pristine reference source.
    *   Output: Per-frame (or per-group of frames) perceptual quality scores for each encoded stream.

2.  **Priority Weighting Controller:**
    *   Input: Perceptual quality scores from the Perceptual Quality Analysis Module, target quality threshold, encoder capacity data (CPU/GPU usage), available bandwidth estimates.
    *   Function: Implement a control algorithm (e.g., PID controller, fuzzy logic) to dynamically adjust priority weights assigned to each encoded stream (or layer within a scalable stream). Higher weights are assigned to streams/layers with lower perceptual quality scores (i.e., those needing more attention) or if their encoding is limited by resource contention.
    *   Output: Priority weight values for each stream/layer (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, summing to 1.0).

3.  **Adaptive Encoding Orchestrator:**
    *   Input: Priority weight values from the Priority Weighting Controller, encoded video streams from multiple encoders.
    *   Function:  This module manages the mixing/compositing of encoded layers. It blends/combines the output streams based on the assigned priority weights. For example, in a scalable video coding (SVC) scenario, if a lower layer has a low perceptual quality score, the priority weighting controller increases its priority, leading to more bits allocated to that layer during transmission.
    *   Output: Combined encoded video stream with dynamically adjusted layer priorities.

4.  **Resource Management Module:**
    *   Input: Encoder capacity data, available bandwidth estimates, priority weight requests.
    *   Function:  Negotiates resource allocation among encoders. This is crucial to prevent starvation. An encoder with a consistently high priority request might need additional resources to meet the demand.
    *   Output: Updated resource allocation parameters for each encoder.

**Pseudocode (Priority Weighting Controller):**

```
function calculate_priority_weights(quality_scores, target_quality, resource_usage):
  // Normalize quality scores (e.g., to a 0-1 scale)
  normalized_scores = normalize(quality_scores)

  // Calculate error from target quality
  quality_error = target_quality - average(normalized_scores)

  // Calculate weighting based on error (PID or similar control loop)
  weighting = PID(quality_error)

  // Adjust weighting based on resource usage (avoid starvation)
  resource_factor = 1.0 - average(resource_usage) //Higher factor if less resource used

  //Apply both weighting factors
  priority_weights = weighting * resource_factor

  //Ensure weights sum to 1.0
  normalize_weights(priority_weights)

  return priority_weights
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simple encoder handover. It introduces a feedback loop that *continuously* adapts encoding priorities based on real-time perceptual quality and resource constraints. The goal is to maximize perceived video quality for the end user, even under fluctuating network conditions or encoder load. It inherently increases the resilience of video delivery systems.
