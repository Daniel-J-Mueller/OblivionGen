**Dynamic Temporal Graph Embedding for Proactive Recommendation**

**Concept:** Extend the temporal split of user interaction data beyond simply input/output for training. Construct a dynamic temporal graph where nodes represent users and items, and edges represent interactions *weighted by time elapsed since the interaction*.  This creates a continuously evolving representation of user preferences and item relationships.  Proactively predict future interactions not just by predicting the *next* item, but by identifying emerging patterns within the graph *before* they manifest as direct interactions.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Structure:**  
    *   Temporal Graph: G(V, E, T)
        *   V: Set of nodes (Users + Items)
        *   E: Set of weighted edges representing interactions. Weight = `exp(-Δt)`, where Δt is the time elapsed since the interaction.  This gives more weight to recent interactions.
        *   T:  Timestamp of each interaction (edge creation/update).
2.  **Graph Construction:**
    *   Initialize the graph with all users and items.
    *   For each user-item interaction:
        *   Create/Update the edge between the user and item.
        *   Set the edge weight based on the time elapsed since the interaction.
        *   Regularly prune edges with weights below a threshold (e.g., 0.1) to reduce noise and focus on recent activity.
3.  **Embedding Generation:**
    *   Employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) – specifically, a Temporal Graph Network (TGN) – to generate embeddings for each node. TGNs are designed to handle time-varying graphs.
    *   Input to TGN: Node features (user demographics, item attributes), edge weights, and interaction timestamps.
    *   Output: Node embeddings representing the learned relationships and temporal dynamics.
4.  **Proactive Prediction:**
    *   **Pattern Detection:** Use anomaly detection techniques (e.g., autoencoders) on the node embeddings to identify emerging patterns in user preferences.  For example, a sudden increase in the similarity between a user's embedding and the embedding of a previously un-interacted item could indicate a potential future interaction.
    *   **Predictive Scoring:** Calculate a "proactive score" for each user-item pair based on:
        *   Embedding similarity.
        *   Temporal trend of the embedding similarity.
        *   Strength of the connections between the user and related items.
    *   **Recommendation Generation:** Recommend items with the highest proactive scores, even if the user hasn't directly interacted with them yet.
5.  **Training & Optimization:**
    *   Loss Function: Combine a standard recommendation loss (e.g., cross-entropy) with a regularization term that encourages the emergence of meaningful patterns in the embeddings.
    *   Optimization Algorithm: Adam with a learning rate schedule.
    *   Evaluation Metrics: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K, and a novel "Proactive Hit Rate" metric that measures the ability to predict interactions *before* they occur.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
# Data: user_interactions (list of (user_id, item_id, timestamp))

# 1. Construct Temporal Graph
graph = TemporalGraph()
for user_id, item_id, timestamp in user_interactions:
    graph.add_interaction(user_id, item_id, timestamp)
    graph.update_edge_weights()

# 2. Generate Node Embeddings
embeddings = TGN(graph).generate_embeddings()

# 3. Calculate Proactive Scores
for user_id in users:
    for item_id in items:
        proactive_score = calculate_proactive_score(embeddings[user_id], embeddings[item_id])
        # Store scores for recommendation

# 4. Recommend Items
recommendations = select_top_k_items(proactive_scores, k=10)
```

This system moves beyond reactive recommendation to actively predict emerging interests, allowing for truly personalized and proactive experiences. The temporal graph allows for capturing the evolving dynamics of user preferences in a more nuanced way than traditional methods.
