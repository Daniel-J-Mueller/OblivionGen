## Dynamic Auction 'Mood Board' Generation

**Concept:** Extend the notification system to proactively generate visually-rich ‘mood boards’ of auctions matching a user’s specifications, served *before* they explicitly request notifications. This shifts from reactive alerting to proactive discovery.

**Specs:**

1.  **Visual Asset Extraction:** Auction postings (text & images) are parsed. Image recognition AI identifies dominant colors, object types (e.g., ‘vintage guitar’, ‘mid-century chair’), and aesthetic styles (e.g., ‘minimalist’, ‘bohemian’).  Textual descriptions are analyzed for sentiment (e.g., ‘rare’, ‘collectible’, ‘rustic’) and keywords.

2.  **Mood Board Composition:**
    *   A ‘mood board’ is a visual arrangement of extracted assets, categorized by identified aesthetic themes.  Dominant colors form a palette. Representative images are displayed as tiles. Key descriptive keywords are presented as tags.
    *   The system creates multiple mood boards, each representing a different potential theme or ‘vibe’ within the user’s specified selection criteria.
    *   Mood boards are rendered as interactive web or mobile elements.

3.  **Proactive Delivery:**  Instead of *only* sending notifications when new auctions appear, the system periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) generates and presents users with a curated set of mood boards matching their selections.  The presentation is *before* new items are listed.

4.  **User Interaction & Refinement:**
    *   Users can ‘favorite’ mood boards or individual tiles.
    *   Favorited mood boards inform the notification algorithm – prioritizing similar items in future alerts.
    *   Users can 'swipe' on boards to indicate preferences.
    *   The system dynamically adjusts the mood board generation algorithm based on user interactions, becoming more attuned to their evolving tastes.

5.  **Integration with Notification System:** Traditional keyword/category-based notifications remain available. The mood board system enhances the discovery experience. Users can seamlessly transition from browsing mood boards to receiving targeted alerts for specific items.

**Pseudocode (Mood Board Generation):**

```
function generateMoodBoards(userID, selectionSpecifications):
  auctions = getAuctionsMatching(selectionSpecifications)
  moodBoards = []
  themes = analyzeAuctionsForThemes(auctions) //AI-driven theme identification

  for theme in themes:
    moodBoard = createMoodBoard(theme)
    relevantAuctions = filterAuctionsByTheme(auctions, theme)
    populateMoodBoardWithAssets(moodBoard, relevantAuctions)
    moodBoards.append(moodBoard)

  return moodBoards

function populateMoodBoardWithAssets(moodBoard, auctions):
  //Extract dominant colors, key images, and descriptive tags.
  //Arrange visually.
  //Prioritize high-quality images.

function getAuctionsMatching(selectionSpecifications):
  //Existing auction query logic from the patent.

function analyzeAuctionsForThemes(auctions):
  //AI image recognition & NLP to identify prevalent themes.
  //Example themes: "Vintage Electronics", "Coastal Decor", "Industrial Design"
