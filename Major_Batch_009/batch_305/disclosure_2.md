## Dynamic Event Horizon Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the file-folder partitioning scheme to incorporate a time-based "event horizon" alongside the prefix-based organization. This allows for automated archival and tiered storage, optimizing for both recent access and long-term retention, while maintaining performance.

**Specs:**

1.  **Time-Based Partitioning Layer:** Introduce a secondary partitioning layer based on event timestamps. This layer operates *above* the prefix-based folders.
2.  **Event Horizon Definition:** Define an adjustable "event horizon" – a sliding window of time (e.g., 30 days, 90 days). Events within the horizon reside in high-performance storage (SSD, NVMe). Events outside the horizon are archived to lower-cost storage (HDD, tape, cloud archival).
3.  **Hybrid Folder Structure:**
    *   Top Level: Time-based partitions (e.g., `2024-10`, `2024-11`, `2024-12`).
    *   Second Level: Prefix-based folders (as in the original patent) *within* each time partition (e.g., `2024-10/prefixA`, `2024-10/prefixB`).
4.  **Background "Horizon Shifter" Process:** A daemon process continuously monitors event timestamps. When an event’s time partition falls outside the event horizon, the process:
    *   Moves the corresponding prefix-based folder (or individual events) to the archival storage.
    *   Updates indexing metadata to reflect the new storage location.
5.  **Metadata Enhancement:** Extend event metadata to include:
    *   `original_partition`: The time partition where the event was initially stored.
    *   `current_location`: A pointer to the current storage location (high-performance or archival).
6.  **Query Optimization:** Modify query processing to:
    *   First, consult the metadata to determine the current location of the event.
    *   Direct the query to the appropriate storage tier.
7.  **Archival Storage Abstraction:** Implement an abstraction layer for archival storage. This allows for easy integration with different archival solutions (e.g., Amazon S3 Glacier, Azure Archive Storage, on-premise tape libraries).

**Pseudocode (Horizon Shifter Process):**

```
function horizon_shifter():
  while (true):
    current_time = get_current_time()
    horizon_cutoff = current_time - event_horizon_duration

    for each time_partition in storage_partitions:
      if time_partition < horizon_cutoff:
        for each prefix_folder in time_partition:
          move_folder_to_archive(prefix_folder, archive_location)
          update_metadata(prefix_folder, new_location=archive_location)

    sleep(configurable_interval) //Adjust frequency based on write load
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Performance Optimization:** Frequent access events reside on fast storage.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Infrequent access events are archived to lower-cost storage.
*   **Scalability:**  Handles large volumes of event data efficiently.
*   **Automated Tiering:** Simplifies data lifecycle management.
