## Dynamic DNS Labeling with Client-Specific Trust Scores

**Concept:** Leverage the DNS resolution process to dynamically attach trust/reputation scores to client requests, influencing CDN edge selection and resource delivery. This extends beyond simple geolocation or network-level metrics.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:** Client IP address, DNS resolution history (recursive path), TLS fingerprint (if available), historical request patterns (e.g., frequency, resource types), and potentially, threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Process:** A machine learning model (continuously trained) assigns a trust score (0-100) to each client based on the input data.  Higher scores indicate higher trust. This module runs on CDN core infrastructure.
*   **Output:** Client ID -> Trust Score mapping. Cached with a short TTL.

**2. Dynamic DNS Label Generation:**

*   **Process:**  When a DNS query arrives, the CDN intercepts it. It retrieves the clientâ€™s trust score (or calculates it on first encounter). It then constructs a dynamic label (e.g., a subdomain or a special DNS record attribute) incorporating the trust score.
    *   Example: `client_trust_{trust_score}.cdn.example.com`  (where `{trust_score}` is the calculated value).  This label is appended to the standard CDN hostname.
*   **Integration:** The DNS server (authoritative for the CDN) is configured to recognize this dynamic label.

**3. CDN Edge Selection Logic:**

*   **Modified Logic:** CDN edge servers are configured to prioritize serving requests with higher trust score labels. This is achieved via weighting within the edge selection algorithm.
*   **Tiered Prioritization:**
    *   **High Trust (80-100):** Served from premium, low-latency edges.
    *   **Medium Trust (50-79):** Served from standard edges.
    *   **Low Trust (0-49):** Served from more geographically diverse, potentially less performant edges, or subjected to additional security checks (e.g., CAPTCHA).
*   **Caching:**  The edge selection preference (based on trust score) is cached at the CDN edge for a short period to minimize overhead.

**4. Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Data Collection:** Monitor request latency, error rates, and security events associated with different trust score tiers.
*   **Model Retraining:** Use this data to retrain the Trust Score Calculation Module, improving its accuracy and effectiveness.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Dynamically adjust the trust score thresholds used for edge prioritization based on real-time performance and security data.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(clientIP, dnsHistory, tlsFingerprint):
  score = 50  // Base score

  // DNS History Analysis
  if dnsHistory.length > 5 and allResolversAreReputable(dnsHistory):
    score += 20
  else:
    score -= 10

  // TLS Fingerprint Analysis
  if isValidTLSFingerprint(tlsFingerprint):
    score += 15
  else:
    score -= 5

  // Threat Intelligence Check
  if isBlacklisted(clientIP):
    score -= 30

  // Clamp score between 0 and 100
  score = max(0, min(100, score))

  return score
```

**Rationale:**  This approach moves beyond simple network-level filtering and allows for a more nuanced and dynamic assessment of client trustworthiness. It can improve CDN performance by directing legitimate traffic to the best edges while mitigating the impact of malicious or suspicious activity.  It's also inherently adaptable, learning from real-world data to optimize its effectiveness over time.
