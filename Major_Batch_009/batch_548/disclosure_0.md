## Dynamic Glyph Weighting for Scene Understanding

**Concept:** Expand the glyph analysis beyond simple recognition (text, barcode, QR code) to build a real-time “scene understanding” weight based on glyph characteristics. This isn’t about *what* the glyphs are, but *how* they’re arranged and what that implies about the environment.

**Specs:**

1.  **Glyph Feature Expansion:**  Beyond gradient, perimeter, size, color, and stroke width (as mentioned in the patent), compute:
    *   **Glyph Density:** Number of glyphs per unit area in a localized region.
    *   **Glyph Orientation Variance:**  Standard deviation of glyph orientation angles within a localized region.
    *   **Glyph Inter-Distance:** Average distance between glyphs within a localized region.
    *   **Glyph Aspect Ratio Distribution:** Histogram of aspect ratios for glyphs within a localized region.
    *   **Glyph Edge Sharpness:** Measurement of edge contrast/blur within the glyph contours.

2.  **Localized Region Definition:** Implement a sliding window approach.  Window size is adaptable based on image resolution and camera field of view.  Overlap between windows should be configurable (e.g., 50%, 75%).

3.  **Weight Calculation:** For each localized region, calculate a “scene understanding weight” based on the extracted features. This weight will be a vector.  The vector components correspond to the feature values.  Normalization (e.g., Z-score) is crucial to ensure consistent weighting across different images.  The formula is as follows:

    `Weight Vector = Normalize([Glyph Density, Glyph Orientation Variance, Glyph Inter-Distance, Aspect Ratio Distribution (mean/std), Edge Sharpness])`

4.  **Hierarchical Scene Representation:**  Construct a hierarchical representation of the scene.  

    *   **Level 1:**  Individual localized regions and their weight vectors.
    *   **Level 2:**  Clusters of adjacent localized regions with similar weight vectors (using k-means or similar clustering algorithm). This defines “scene elements”.
    *   **Level 3:**  Relationships between scene elements (e.g., adjacency, containment). This forms a “scene graph”.

5. **Dynamic Processing Prioritization:** Utilize the scene graph to dynamically prioritize image processing tasks.

    *   **High-Weight Regions:** Regions with high scene understanding weights (indicating potential textual information or structured content) receive higher processing priority for OCR or barcode/QR code recognition.
    *   **Low-Weight Regions:** Regions with low weights (indicating unstructured background or clutter) receive lower priority or are skipped entirely.
    *   **Task Sequencing:**  Sequence OCR, barcode, and QR code tasks based on region weights and relationships within the scene graph.

6. **Model Training & Adaptation:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., a convolutional neural network) to predict the scene understanding weights directly from image patches. This model can be fine-tuned on specific datasets to improve accuracy for different scenarios (e.g., document scanning, object recognition).

**Pseudocode (Weight Calculation):**

```
function calculate_scene_weight(image_patch):
  features = extract_glyph_features(image_patch) //From 1.
  glyph_density = features.density
  orientation_variance = features.orientation_variance
  inter_distance = features.inter_distance
  aspect_ratio_dist = features.aspect_ratio_dist
  edge_sharpness = features.edge_sharpness

  normalized_density = normalize(glyph_density)
  normalized_variance = normalize(orientation_variance)
  normalized_distance = normalize(inter_distance)
  normalized_aspect = normalize(aspect_ratio_dist)
  normalized_sharpness = normalize(edge_sharpness)

  weight_vector = [normalized_density, normalized_variance, normalized_distance, normalized_aspect, normalized_sharpness]
  return weight_vector
```
