## Adaptive Predictive Burst – APB

**Concept:** Expand upon the capture of multiple images around a shutter event by introducing predictive burst capture triggered by subject motion *before* the shutter is even fully pressed. This moves beyond simply capturing before/after, and into anticipatory capture.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-speed image sensor (minimum 960fps at full resolution).
    *   Dedicated AI processing unit (NPU) for real-time motion analysis.
    *   Gyroscope/accelerometer for device motion compensation.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Motion Prediction Module:**  Utilizes the camera feed and device motion sensors to predict subject movement.  This employs a Kalman filter to smooth data and predict trajectories.
    *   **Dynamic Buffer:** Circular buffer, but dynamic in size, adjusting based on predicted motion.  Fast-moving subjects = larger buffer.
    *   **Adaptive Trigger:** Triggers the full capture sequence *before* the shutter button is fully pressed.  This 'pre-capture' is seamlessly integrated into the final image selection.
    *   **User Feedback:**  Subtle visual cue (e.g., pulsing border) indicating pre-capture is active.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
initializeMotionPredictionModule()
initializeDynamicBuffer()
setInitialBufferCapacity(defaultCapacity)

//Capture Loop
while(cameraActive):
    frame = captureFrame()
    motionVector = analyzeMotion(frame)  //Using optical flow & device sensors
    predictedPosition = predictPosition(motionVector)
    
    //Adjust buffer size
    bufferSize = calculateBufferSize(predictedPosition)
    adjustDynamicBuffer(bufferSize)
    
    //Pre-capture frames
    preCaptureFrames(numberFrames)
    
    //User presses shutter
    if (shutterButtonPressed):
        //Capture final frames
        captureFinalFrames()
        
        //Assemble image sequence
        imageSequence = combinePreCaptureAndFinalFrames()
        
        //Present selection to user (as per existing patent)
        presentImageSequence(imageSequence)
```

*   **Refinements:**
    *   **Scene Understanding:**  Integrate scene understanding (object recognition) to improve motion prediction.  (e.g., predicting a ball’s trajectory in sports).
    *   **Learning Mode:**  The system learns user shooting patterns.  (e.g., if the user often shoots in burst mode for action shots, the pre-capture buffer automatically increases).
    *   **Variable Frame Rate:**  Adjust the frame rate *within* the pre-capture buffer based on predicted motion. Faster motion = higher frame rate for smoother capture.
    *    **Haptic Feedback**:  Slight vibration to indicate optimal pre-capture timing.
