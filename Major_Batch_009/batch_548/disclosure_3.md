## Adaptive Notification Zones & Event Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the proximity-based notification suppression by introducing dynamically adjustable notification zones *around* the camera, and a system for prioritizing event types based on user-defined importance *within* those zones. This goes beyond simple on/off suppression and offers granular control.

**Specs:**

*   **Zone Definition:** A mobile application interface allowing users to define circular or polygonal zones around the cameraâ€™s field of view. Multiple zones are supported, each with adjustable radius/perimeter and assigned priority levels (High, Medium, Low, None).
*   **User Profiles:** The system supports multiple user profiles, each with customized zone configurations and event prioritization settings.
*   **Event Type Library:** A pre-defined library of event types (e.g., person detected, vehicle detected, animal detected, sound event, motion, package delivery). Users can add custom event types.
*   **Prioritization Matrix:** Within each zone, users assign a priority level (Critical, Important, Informational) to each event type. This determines whether a notification is sent, suppressed, or simply logged.
*   **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:**  Zones can be adjusted remotely via the mobile app. The system tracks user location and adjusts zone boundaries automatically to maintain a consistent proximity relationship.
*   **AI-Driven Zone Suggestion:** The system analyzes historical event data and suggests optimal zone configurations for each user, improving accuracy and reducing false positives.
*   **Geofencing Integration:** Integration with existing geofencing services to trigger zone adjustments based on pre-defined locations (e.g., "home," "work").

**Pseudocode (Event Processing Flow):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessEvent(eventData, userProfile, cameraLocation):
    userLocation = GetUserLocation(userProfile)
    proximityStatus = CheckProximity(userLocation, cameraLocation)
    
    IF proximityStatus == "ProximityActive":
        zoneStatus = CheckZone(userLocation, cameraLocation, eventData)
        
        IF zoneStatus == "ZoneActive":
            eventPriority = GetEventPriority(eventData, userProfile)
            
            IF eventPriority == "Critical":
                SendNotification(eventData, userProfile)
            ELSE IF eventPriority == "Important":
                LogEvent(eventData, userProfile)
                SendNotificationIfUserIsActive(userProfile)
            ELSE:
                LogEvent(eventData, userProfile)
        ELSE:
            LogEvent(eventData, userProfile)
    ELSE:
        SendNotification(eventData, userProfile)
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Existing camera hardware is largely compatible.
*   Improved wireless communication capabilities (e.g., Wi-Fi 6, 5G) for faster event data transfer and location updates.
*   Potential for edge computing capabilities to process event data locally, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with smart home ecosystems (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) to enable voice control of notification settings.
*   Machine learning algorithms to predict user behavior and proactively adjust notification settings.
*   Support for multiple camera devices, allowing users to create a comprehensive security network.
