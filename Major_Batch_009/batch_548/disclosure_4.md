## Adaptive Cache Partitioning via Error-Driven Migration

**Concept:** Dynamically re-partition the cache based on observed error rates of cache lines, migrating frequently errored lines to a dedicated, error-tolerant region.

**Specification:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Cache Memory:** Standard SRAM cache, physically partitioned into two regions: *Performance Region* (majority of cache), and *Resilient Region* (smaller, dedicated to frequently errored lines).
*   **Error Tracking Unit (ETU):**  Per-cache-line counter (identical to existing patent's counters), and a *Migration Score* associated with each cache line. Migration Score is calculated based on error count *and* time since last error.  Older errors contribute less to the score.
*   **Migration Controller:**  Monitors Migration Scores. When a line’s score exceeds a threshold, the Migration Controller initiates a swap: the errored line is moved to the Resilient Region, and a relatively “clean” line from the Resilient Region is moved to the Performance Region.
*   **Resilient Region Controller:** Operates the Resilient Region with different error mitigation techniques (described in Section 3).
*   **Global Migration Threshold:** Adjustable system-wide threshold governing the overall aggressiveness of migration.

**2. Migration Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
// Per-Cache-Line (executed periodically by ETU)
function update_migration_score(cache_line, error_count, time_since_last_error):
  migration_score = error_count * weight_recent + (1 - weight_recent) * (time_since_last_error / max_time_window)
  return migration_score

// Migration Controller (executed periodically)
function perform_migration():
  for each cache_line:
    score = update_migration_score(cache_line, cache_line.error_count, cache_line.time_since_last_error)
    if score > global_migration_threshold:
      select_clean_line_from_resilient_region() // Select a line with lowest error count
      swap(cache_line, selected_clean_line) // Move lines between regions
      reset(cache_line.error_count)
      reset(cache_line.time_since_last_error)
```

**3. Resilient Region Operation:**

*   **Error Correction Code (ECC):** Employ stronger ECC (e.g., SECDED with higher correction capability) in the Resilient Region, even at the cost of some performance.
*   **Redundancy:** Utilize a simple form of mirroring (duplicate cache line) for critical data in the Resilient Region. Access both copies and compare for error detection.
*   **Refresh:** Periodically refresh (rewrite) data in the Resilient Region to mitigate wear and data retention issues.
*   **Writeback Policy Modification:** Implement a more conservative writeback policy in the Resilient Region, favoring write-through or write-allocate to reduce data loss.

**4. System Parameters (Configurable):**

*   `Resilient_Region_Size`: Percentage of total cache allocated to the Resilient Region.
*   `Global_Migration_Threshold`: Sensitivity of the migration algorithm.
*   `Weight_Recent`:  Emphasis on recent errors versus long-term error rate in the Migration Score.
*   `Max_Time_Window`:  Maximum time considered for the time-since-last-error calculation.
*   `ECC_Strength`: Strength of ECC used in the Resilient Region.
