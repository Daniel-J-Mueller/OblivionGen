## Temporal Resonance Mapping for Anomaly Localization

**Concept:** Expand the windowing approach to incorporate a ‘resonance’ concept. Instead of just comparing windows to each other and injected anomalies, we analyze *how* windows change over time to establish a baseline ‘temporal fingerprint’. Anomalies then disrupt this established resonance, creating detectable deviations.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Preprocessing:**  Time series data is segmented into overlapping windows as described in the source patent.  However, each window is not treated as an isolated data point. Instead, we calculate a set of temporal features for each window—mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, dominant frequency (via FFT), and rate of change (first derivative). These form a 'temporal feature vector' for each window.
*   **Resonance Baseline Creation:**  A sliding window approach is used to create a ‘resonance baseline’.  For each window, we calculate the correlation between its temporal feature vector and the temporal feature vectors of its *n* preceding windows. This creates a resonance score for each window, indicating its similarity to the recent past.  The average resonance score across a larger time segment serves as the baseline.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** When a new window is processed, its resonance score is calculated. A significant deviation from the established baseline—above a dynamically adjusted threshold—indicates a potential anomaly.
*   **Localization:**  The degree of resonance deviation, combined with the window’s position in the time series, provides a localized anomaly signature. A sharp drop in resonance, coupled with a window location near a key event, reinforces the anomaly’s significance.
*   **Dynamic Thresholding:** The anomaly detection threshold adapts to the inherent variability of the time series data. This is achieved by calculating a moving average and standard deviation of resonance scores over a defined time window.
*   **Feature Weighting:**  Different temporal features can be assigned weights based on their relative importance for a given application. This allows the system to prioritize specific characteristics of the time series data.
*   **Resonance Network (RN):** Implement a separate neural network layer dedicated to analyzing resonance patterns. The RN receives the resonance scores from each window and learns to identify subtle anomalies that might be missed by traditional anomaly detection methods.
*   **RN Training:** Train the RN using a dataset of normal and anomalous time series data. The training process optimizes the weights of the RN to accurately classify resonance patterns as either normal or anomalous.

# Anomaly Detection

    # Calculate resonance score

    # Check for anomaly
    if resonance_score < anomaly_threshold:
        print("Anomaly detected in window", i)
        print("Resonance score:", resonance_score)
