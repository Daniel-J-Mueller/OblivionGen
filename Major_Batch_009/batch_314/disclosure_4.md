## Personalized Sonic Environments - Dynamic Audio Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the virtualized product evaluation beyond simple simulation of device output to create *dynamic* and *personalized* sonic environments. Instead of just hearing what the headphones *can* do, the user experiences how the headphones modify *their* existing audio world in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** User’s live audio feed (microphone) *and* a pre-selected audio ‘seed’ (music, podcast, ambient noise - user choice).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Audio Analysis:** Real-time analysis of the ‘seed’ audio: spectral characteristics, dominant frequencies, transient detection.
    2.  **Virtual Headphone/Speaker Emulation:** Implementation of a virtual audio processing chain mirroring the characteristics of the device being evaluated (EQ, spatialization, noise cancellation, etc.). This uses parameters from the patent, but adds dynamic modification.
    3.  **Dynamic Morphing:**  The processed ‘seed’ audio is blended with the user’s live microphone input.  The *degree* of blending is controlled by a ‘morphing factor’ derived from real-time analysis of the user's vocal characteristics (pitch, volume, emotional tone - detected via AI).  A calm voice = more direct ‘seed’ audio, stressed voice = more processed audio emphasis.
    4.  **Personalized EQ:** The virtual device's EQ is *automatically* adjusted based on the user’s typical listening preferences (extracted from their music streaming data or via an initial preference questionnaire).
    5.  **Spatialization Mapping:** Spatial audio parameters are adapted to the user's head-related transfer function (HRTF) – either pre-loaded or estimated via a quick calibration process.
*   **Output:**  A blended audio stream delivered to the user’s headphones or speakers.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Morphing Sensitivity Slider:** Allows users to control the responsiveness of the dynamic blending.
    *   **Seed Selection:** A library of pre-defined audio ‘seeds’ or the option to use a local audio file.
    *   **Personalization Toggle:** Option to enable/disable automated personalization features.
    *   **Emotional Response Visualization:** Display a real-time visualization of the user’s detected emotional tone, correlated to the audio morphing.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Inputs: liveAudio, seedAudio, deviceParameters
// Outputs: processedAudio

function processAudio(liveAudio, seedAudio, deviceParameters) {
  // Analyze seedAudio for spectral characteristics
  seedAnalysis = analyzeAudio(seedAudio)

  // Analyze liveAudio for emotional tone
  emotionalTone = analyzeEmotionalTone(liveAudio)

  // Calculate morphing factor based on emotionalTone
  morphingFactor = calculateMorphingFactor(emotionalTone)

  // Emulate device characteristics based on deviceParameters
  emulatedAudio = emulateDevice(seedAudio, deviceParameters)

  // Blend emulatedAudio and liveAudio based on morphingFactor
  processedAudio = blendAudio(liveAudio, emulatedAudio, morphingFactor)

  return processedAudio
}
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simulating static output. It creates a *reactive* audio experience, adapting the virtualized product's effect to the user’s *current* state and environment.  It leverages emotional AI to tailor the experience and demonstrates how the product impacts the user’s everyday life – creating a stronger connection and more compelling evaluation.
