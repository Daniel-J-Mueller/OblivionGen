## Dynamic GPU Partitioning & Resource Allocation based on Predictive Workload

**Concept:** Extend the existing capacity reservation system to *dynamically* partition physical GPUs into smaller, logical GPUs *on-demand* based on predicted workload characteristics. This moves beyond simple reservation to true resource optimization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Workload Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time monitoring of virtual compute instance resource usage (CPU, memory, network) *and* application-level profiling data (if available - e.g., frame rates, rendering complexity, AI model size/batch size).
*   **Processing:** Utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, long short-term memory network) trained on historical workload data to predict future GPU resource requirements (memory bandwidth, compute units, texture sampling rate) *at a granular level* (e.g., per-frame, per-inference).  The model should predict a resource 'footprint' â€“ a vector of required resources.
*   **Output:**  Predicted resource footprint for the virtual compute instance over a defined time window (e.g., next 5 seconds). Includes a confidence interval for the prediction.

**2. Dynamic GPU Partitioning Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted resource footprint, physical GPU inventory (including current partition configurations), and cost/performance metrics for different partitioning schemes.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Determines the optimal partitioning of available physical GPUs to *exactly* match the predicted resource footprint. This may involve creating multiple small logical GPUs from a single physical GPU.
    *   Considers trade-offs between partitioning granularity (smaller partitions offer more flexibility but incur overhead) and communication latency (logical GPUs residing on different physical GPUs will have higher communication costs).
    *   Employs a cost function that minimizes resource wastage, communication latency, and partitioning overhead.
    *   Utilizes a hardware virtualization layer (e.g., SR-IOV, NVIDIA vGPU) to create and manage the logical GPUs.
*   **Output:**  Configuration details for the logical GPUs (memory allocation, compute unit assignment, communication channels).

**3.  Resource Broker & Scheduler:**

*   **Input:**  Requests for virtual GPUs, predicted resource footprints, and availability information.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Prioritizes requests based on service-level agreements (SLAs) or application importance.
    *   Schedules the allocation of dynamically partitioned logical GPUs to virtual compute instances.
    *   Handles requests that exceed available resources by queuing them or dynamically scaling resources (e.g., adding more physical GPUs).
    *   Monitors resource utilization and adjusts partitioning configurations in real-time to optimize performance and resource efficiency.

**4.  Partitioning Granularity Levels:**

*   Define a hierarchy of partitioning levels to balance flexibility and overhead. Examples:
    *   **Full GPU:**  Entire physical GPU assigned to a virtual compute instance.
    *   **Half GPU:** Physical GPU divided into two logical GPUs with equal resources.
    *   **Quarter GPU:** Physical GPU divided into four logical GPUs.
    *   **Custom Partition:**  Dynamically sized partition based on the predicted resource footprint. This requires more sophisticated virtualization and resource management.

**Pseudocode (Resource Broker):**

```
function allocate_gpu(request):
    footprint = predict_workload(request.compute_instance)
    available_partitions = find_available_partitions(footprint)
    if available_partitions is empty:
        queue_request(request)
        return
    best_partition = select_best_partition(available_partitions)
    configure_virtual_gpu(best_partition, request.compute_instance)
    update_availability_info(best_partition)
    return success
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-bandwidth interconnect between physical GPUs (e.g., NVLink, PCIe Gen4/5).
*   Hardware virtualization support (SR-IOV, NVIDIA vGPU).
*   Sufficient physical GPU memory to support dynamic partitioning.
