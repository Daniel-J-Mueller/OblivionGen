## Dynamic Label Anchoring via Voronoi Diagram Integration

**Concept:** Instead of relying solely on the centroid of an inner buffer zone, dynamically determine label anchor points using a Voronoi diagram generated from key features *within* the buffered polygon. This allows labels to ‘repel’ each other and cling to visually distinct areas, improving readability and avoiding overlap, particularly in dense geographic regions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Feature Extraction:**
    *   Input: Reduced set of points defining the buffered polygon perimeter.
    *   Process: Identify 'key features' within the polygon. These could be:
        *   Points of high curvature on the perimeter.
        *   Centroids of smaller, enclosed polygons within the main polygon (e.g., lakes, islands).
        *   Points representing significant population centers or landmarks (using external data sources).
    *   Output: List of (x, y) coordinates representing key features.

2.  **Voronoi Diagram Generation:**
    *   Input: List of key feature coordinates.
    *   Process: Generate a Voronoi diagram using the key feature coordinates as seeds.  Each region in the diagram represents the area closest to a specific key feature.
    *   Output: Voronoi diagram data structure (e.g., a list of polygons defining each Voronoi cell).

3.  **Label Placement & Anchor Selection:**
    *   Input:  Text string for the label, Voronoi diagram data, and label dimensions.
    *   Process:
        *   For each label:
            *   Determine the Voronoi cell(s) that *fully contain* the polygon.
            *   Calculate the centroid of the identified Voronoi cell(s).
            *   Attempt to place the label's anchor point at the calculated centroid.
            *   **Collision Detection:** Check for overlap with existing labels. If collision detected:
                *   Use a repulsive force algorithm (e.g., spring-like forces) to adjust the anchor point within the Voronoi cell, pushing it away from the colliding label.
                *   If adjustment fails to resolve collision, prioritize placement within the *largest* available Voronoi cell.
    *   Output:  (x, y) coordinates of the label anchor point.

4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Input: User interaction (e.g., panning, zooming) on the map.
    *   Process:  Periodically re-evaluate label placements and anchor points, especially after significant map changes. This ensures labels remain optimally positioned and readable.

**Pseudocode (Label Placement):**

```
function placeLabel(labelText, polygon, existingLabels):
  keyFeatures = extractKeyFeatures(polygon)
  voronoiDiagram = generateVoronoiDiagram(keyFeatures)
  relevantCells = findCellsContainingPolygon(voronoiDiagram, polygon)
  if relevantCells is empty:
    //Fallback to centroid of buffered polygon if no suitable Voronoi cells are found
    return calculateCentroid(polygon)
  
  bestCell = findLargestCell(relevantCells) //Prioritize larger cells
  anchorPoint = calculateCentroid(bestCell)
  
  //Collision Detection & Repulsion
  for each existingLabel in existingLabels:
    if labelsOverlap(anchorPoint, existingLabel):
      anchorPoint = repel(anchorPoint, existingLabel)

  return anchorPoint
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   **Performance:** Voronoi diagram generation can be computationally expensive. Implement caching and optimization techniques.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of polygons and labels.
*   **External Data Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with external data sources for landmark and population center information.
*   **Visualization:** Provide tools for visualizing the Voronoi diagram and label placement process.
