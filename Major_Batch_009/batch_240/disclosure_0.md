## Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Coordination via Predictive Collision Cone Mapping

**Core Concept:** Extend the bounded area safety system to enable coordinated navigation of multiple autonomous vehicles within a shared space. Instead of each vehicle solely reacting to immediate obstacles, predict potential collisions *between* vehicles and dynamically adjust trajectories.

**System Specs:**

*   **Vehicle Hardware:**
    *   Existing propulsion, motor controller, sensor suites (as per patent).
    *   Dedicated short-range, high-bandwidth communication module (UWB, 60GHz, etc.) for inter-vehicle messaging.
    *   Computational unit capable of running predictive algorithms in real-time.

*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Collision Cone Generator (CCG):** Each vehicle runs a CCG module.  This module operates on data received from its sensors *and* from other vehicles.
    *   **Predictive Trajectory Engine (PTE):** Within each CCG, a PTE estimates the future trajectories of nearby vehicles based on their current speed, direction, and communicated intent (task objectives).
    *   **Collision Cone Mapping:** The PTE projects these predicted trajectories as 'collision cones' extending from each vehicle. These cones represent areas of potential collision over a specified time horizon (e.g., 3-5 seconds).  Cones are dynamically updated based on incoming data.
    *   **Conflict Resolution Module (CRM):**  The CRM analyzes overlapping collision cones. When a conflict is detected, the CRM calculates alternative trajectories for the involved vehicles, prioritizing safety and efficiency. It uses a decentralized consensus algorithm (e.g., a variant of Raft) to ensure that all affected vehicles agree on the new trajectories.
    *   **Intent Communication Protocol:**  Vehicles broadcast their task objectives (e.g., “transporting item X to location Y”) and estimated time of arrival (ETA). This information is used by other vehicles to anticipate their movements and plan accordingly.

**Pseudocode (CRM - Conflict Resolution):**

```
function resolveConflict(vehicleA, vehicleB, overlappingCone) {
  // Calculate potential maneuvers for each vehicle (e.g., speed reduction, lane change)
  maneuversA = generateManeuvers(vehicleA, overlappingCone)
  maneuversB = generateManeuvers(vehicleB, overlappingCone)

  // Evaluate maneuvers based on cost function (safety, efficiency, task completion)
  costsA = evaluateManeuvers(maneuversA, costsA)
  costsB = evaluateManeuvers(maneuversB, costsB)

  // Select best maneuvers for each vehicle
  bestManeuverA = selectBestManeuver(bestManeuverA, costsA)
  bestManeuverB = selectBestManeuver(bestManeuverB, costsB)

  // Initiate decentralized consensus algorithm (Raft variant) to agree on new trajectories
  proposeNewTrajectories(vehicleA, vehicleB, bestManeuverA, bestManeuverB)

  // Implement new trajectories via motor controller
  applyNewTrajectory(vehicleA, bestManeuverA)
  applyNewTrajectory(vehicleB, bestManeuverB)
}
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Collision Avoidance:**  Shifts from reactive to proactive collision avoidance by predicting potential conflicts *before* they occur.
*   **Decentralized Coordination:** Eliminates the need for a central controller, improving robustness and scalability.
*   **Intent-Aware Navigation:** Leverages task objectives to anticipate vehicle movements and optimize coordination.
*   **Dynamic Cone Adjustment:** Adapts collision cone size and shape in real-time based on vehicle speed, sensor data, and predicted trajectories.
