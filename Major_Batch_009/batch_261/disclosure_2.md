## Predictive Anomaly Propagation & Mitigation System

**Core Concept:** Extend the dependency mapping to *predict* anomaly propagation before it impacts services, and automatically initiate mitigation steps.

**System Specs:**

**1. Propagation Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Dependency Map (as defined in patent), Real-time System Metrics (CPU, Memory, Network I/O, Application-specific metrics), Historical Anomaly Data, Anomaly Propagation Models (trained via machine learning).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each detected anomaly, identify impacted components via the dependency map.
    *   Run propagation models to estimate the *likelihood* and *severity* of the anomaly reaching dependent components. Models consider component health, current load, and historical data.
    *   Calculate a "Propagation Risk Score" for each dependent component.
*   **Output:** Propagation Risk Scores for all dependent components, predicted time-to-impact.

**2. Automated Mitigation Module:**

*   **Input:** Propagation Risk Scores, System Policies (defined by administrators - e.g., "Prioritize critical services", "Minimize user impact"), Available Mitigation Actions.
*   **Mitigation Actions:** (examples)
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Dynamically increase resources (CPU, memory) to potentially impacted components.
    *   **Traffic Shaping:** Redirect traffic away from potentially failing components.
    *   **Cache Invalidation:** Force cache refreshes to prevent propagation of stale data.
    *   **Service Degradation:**  Gracefully degrade non-critical functionality to conserve resources.
    *   **Preemptive Restart:** Restart potentially failing components before they impact users (with rollback capabilities).
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on Propagation Risk Scores and System Policies, select the most appropriate mitigation actions for each impacted component.
    *   Automate the execution of these actions.
    *   Monitor the effectiveness of mitigation actions and adjust as needed.
*   **Output:** Executed Mitigation Actions, Mitigation Effectiveness Metrics.

**3.  Anomaly "Immunity" Scoring:**

*   **Process:**  Assign an “Immunity Score” to each system component. This score reflects the component's inherent resilience to anomalies (e.g., redundancy, self-healing capabilities, robust error handling).
*   **Integration:**  The Immunity Score is factored into the Propagation Risk Score calculation. Components with higher Immunity Scores have lower Propagation Risk Scores.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Analyze the effectiveness of Immunity Scores during anomaly events to continuously refine the scoring model.

**4.  User Interface Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Visualization:** Display a visual representation of predicted anomaly propagation paths, highlighting components at high risk.
*   **Mitigation Action Recommendations:**  Provide administrators with recommendations for mitigation actions, based on the predicted impact and available options.
*   **Real-time Mitigation Status:**  Display the status of all ongoing mitigation actions.

**Pseudocode (Mitigation Module):**

```
FUNCTION select_mitigation_actions(component, risk_score, policies):
  actions = []

  IF risk_score > threshold_high:
    actions.append("increase_resources")
    actions.append("redirect_traffic")
  ELSE IF risk_score > threshold_medium:
    actions.append("invalidate_cache")
    actions.append("degrade_service")

  //Consider Policies
  IF policies.prioritize_critical AND component.is_critical:
      actions.insert(0, "increase_resources")

  RETURN actions
```

**Data Stores:**

*   Enhanced Dependency Map (includes Immunity Scores)
*   Anomaly Propagation Models (trained ML models)
*   Mitigation Action Library (predefined actions and configurations)
*   Mitigation Event Logs (detailed records of all mitigation actions)
