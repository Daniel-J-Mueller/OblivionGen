## Dynamic Compute Node Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the system view information to incorporate ‘personas’ assigned to internal compute nodes, influencing message routing and prioritization based on simulated expertise or ‘skill’.

**Specification:**

*   **Persona Database:** A centralized database storing persona definitions. Each persona represents a simulated expertise profile. Parameters include:
    *   `skill_vector`: A multi-dimensional vector representing proficiency in various game mechanics (e.g., combat, resource management, puzzle-solving). Values range 0.0 - 1.0.
    *   `latency_preference`:  A weighting factor influencing node selection based on proximity to the external compute node *and* the simulated persona’s ‘reaction time’. Higher values prioritize faster nodes; lower values prioritize nodes with more complex processing capabilities.
    *   `resource_capacity`: Represents the node’s processing bandwidth allocated to persona execution.
*   **Persona Assignment:** Entry point compute nodes dynamically assign personas to internal compute nodes based on:
    *   Current game state.
    *   External compute node's demonstrated player style (analyzed from input patterns).
    *   Available resource capacity on internal nodes.
*   **Message Routing & Prioritization:**
    *   Incoming messages from the external compute node are tagged with ‘skill requirements’ based on the action being performed (e.g., a complex combat maneuver requires high ‘combat’ skill).
    *   The entry point compute node matches skill requirements to available personas on internal compute nodes.
    *   Messages are routed to nodes with matching personas, prioritized by persona skill level (higher skill = higher priority).
    *   Latency is calculated using the `latency_preference` weighting.
*   **Dynamic Persona Adjustment:** Entry point nodes continuously monitor internal node performance and dynamically adjust persona assignments:
    *   If a node is overloaded, its persona is downgraded or reassigned.
    *   If a node is underutilized, its persona is upgraded.
*   **Persona ‘Drift’ Simulation:** Introduce a small degree of randomness to persona skill vectors over time to simulate ‘learning’ and ‘adaptation’ within the game world. This introduces subtle variations in node behavior.

**Pseudocode (Entry Point Compute Node - Message Routing):**

```
function route_message(message, external_node):
  skill_requirements = extract_skill_requirements(message)
  available_nodes = get_available_internal_nodes()
  
  best_node = null
  best_score = -1
  
  for node in available_nodes:
    persona = node.assigned_persona
    if persona != null:
      skill_match_score = calculate_skill_match_score(skill_requirements, persona.skill_vector)
      latency = calculate_latency(external_node, node) * persona.latency_preference
      score = skill_match_score - latency // Combine skill match and latency
      
      if score > best_score:
        best_score = score
        best_node = node
  
  if best_node != null:
    send_message_to_node(best_node, message)
  else:
    // Handle case where no suitable node is found (e.g., queue message, error)
    log_error("No suitable node found for message")
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Player Experience:** More responsive and intelligent game behavior.
*   **Improved Resource Utilization:** Dynamic allocation of processing power.
*   **Emergent Game Dynamics:** Subtle variations in node behavior creating unique game scenarios.
*   **Scalability:**  Facilitates efficient distribution of game load across a large number of compute nodes.
