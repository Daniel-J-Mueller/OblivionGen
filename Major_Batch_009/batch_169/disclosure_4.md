## Dynamic Contextual Ruby Character Generation

**Concept:** Instead of *selecting* existing ruby characters, generate them dynamically based on the user's interaction with the text and inferred reading comprehension.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A neural network trained on a large corpus of text with associated ruby character mappings *and* a comprehension model (e.g., BERT, GPT-3 fine-tuned for reading level assessment).
*   **Input:** Electronic book text, user interaction data (highlighting, tap/click duration on words, scrolling speed, time spent on pages), and real-time reading level assessment.
*   **Process:**
    1.  User begins reading.
    2.  Text is segmented into phrases.
    3.  The comprehension model assesses the user's understanding of the current phrase based on interaction data and reading history.
    4.  If the comprehension score falls below a defined threshold:
        *   The neural network *generates* appropriate ruby characters for key logographic characters within the phrase, prioritizing those which contributed most to the comprehension deficit.  Generation isn't simply lookup; it involves creating phonetically accurate ruby characters *even if* the exact mapping doesn't exist in the training data, utilizing probabilistic character generation.
        *   Generated ruby characters are displayed.
    5.  If comprehension is satisfactory, no ruby characters are displayed.
    6.  The system continuously monitors comprehension and dynamically adjusts ruby character generation.
*   **Output:** Electronic book text with dynamically generated ruby characters as needed.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function process_text(text, user_interaction_data, user_reading_level):
  segments = segment_text(text)
  for segment in segments:
    comprehension_score = assess_comprehension(segment, user_interaction_data, user_reading_level)
    if comprehension_score < threshold:
      key_logographic_characters = identify_key_logographic_characters(segment)
      ruby_characters = generate_ruby_characters(key_logographic_characters)
      display_ruby_characters(ruby_characters)
    else:
      hide_ruby_characters()
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Sufficient processing power for real-time neural network inference (GPU recommended).
*   Adequate memory for model storage and intermediate calculations.

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large corpus of text with accurate ruby character mappings.
*   Data on user reading habits and comprehension levels.

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond simple selection of pre-defined ruby characters to *generation* based on real-time user comprehension. It's adaptive, personalized, and potentially more effective than static or pre-determined ruby character displays. It creates a truly interactive learning experience.
