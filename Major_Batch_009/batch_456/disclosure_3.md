## Dynamic Regional 'Shadowing' for Proactive Failover

**Concept:** Enhance failover preparedness by creating ‘shadow’ regions that mirror primary regions, not with full data replication, but with continuously updated *capacity profiles* and *dependency maps*. This allows for incredibly rapid scaling and configuration in a failover scenario, bypassing lengthy provisioning and dependency resolution.

**Specs:**

1.  **Capacity Profiler:**
    *   Input: Real-time metrics from primary regions (CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O, disk I/O, concurrent connections, request latency).
    *   Process: Continuous monitoring and statistical analysis (moving averages, standard deviation, percentile calculations) to create a dynamic capacity profile.
    *   Output: A lightweight, compressed representation of the region’s capacity ‘fingerprint’. This isn't the data *itself*, but a profile of *how much* infrastructure is actively being used.

2.  **Dependency Mapper:**
    *   Input: Application configuration files, service discovery logs, network traffic analysis.
    *   Process: Automated discovery of inter-service dependencies (which services rely on which others). Generates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing these dependencies.
    *   Output: A dependency DAG encoded as a serialized object (e.g., JSON).

3.  **Shadow Region Manager:**
    *   Input: Capacity profiles and dependency DAGs from primary regions.
    *   Process:
        *   Maintains a ‘shadow’ infrastructure blueprint for each primary region. This blueprint *doesn't* contain data, only configurations for launching instances, setting up networking, and configuring services.
        *   Continuously updates shadow blueprints with the latest capacity profiles and dependency information.
        *   Monitors the health of primary regions.
    *   Output: Pre-configured shadow regions ready for activation.

4.  **Failover Orchestrator:**
    *   Input: Signal from primary region health monitor indicating a failure.
    *   Process:
        *   Activates the corresponding shadow region.
        *   Launches instances based on the shadow blueprint.
        *   Configures networking to redirect traffic.
        *   Initiates data replication (from backup or other secondary source - this is separate from the shadow region functionality).
    *   Output: Fully operational failover region.

**Pseudocode (Failover Orchestrator):**

```
function initiate_failover(primary_region_id):
  shadow_region_id = get_shadow_region_id(primary_region_id)
  blueprint = get_shadow_blueprint(shadow_region_id)

  launch_instances(blueprint)
  configure_networking(blueprint)
  redirect_traffic(primary_region_id, shadow_region_id)

  # Data replication triggered as a separate process
  trigger_data_replication(primary_region_id, shadow_region_id)

  log_failover_event(primary_region_id, shadow_region_id)
```

**Novelty:** Existing failover systems focus on replicating data or pre-provisioning full standby regions. This approach minimizes the *time to scale* in a failover scenario by focusing on the *configuration* and *capacity* requirements *before* data needs to be replicated. This is a key difference - faster configuration, and the assumption that data replication will occur concurrently, and is not part of the initial, immediate step. It’s about being ready to *accept* data, not *have* it already.
