## Dynamic Encoding Granularity with Multi-Level Lookup

**Concept:** Extend the fixed/variable length encoding by introducing multiple levels of lookup tables, dynamically adjusted based on data entropy and available processing resources. Instead of just 'long' and 'short' encoded symbols, we use a hierarchy – micro, short, medium, long – determined *during* encoding and signaled within the data stream.

**Specs:**

*   **Encoding Core:**
    *   **Entropy Analysis Module:** Continuously analyzes incoming data to determine symbol frequency distributions. This dictates the optimal encoding granularity.
    *   **Granularity Selector:** Based on entropy analysis, selects one of four encoding levels: Micro, Short, Medium, Long.
    *   **Encoding Tables:** Four distinct lookup tables (Micro, Short, Medium, Long) storing symbol-to-code mappings. Each table has a different code length range.
    *   **Granularity Indicator:** A 2-bit field prepended to each encoded block, indicating the selected encoding granularity level (00=Micro, 01=Short, 10=Medium, 11=Long).

*   **Decoding Core:**
    *   **Granularity Detector:** Reads the 2-bit granularity indicator at the beginning of each block.
    *   **Lookup Table Selector:** Selects the appropriate lookup table (Micro, Short, Medium, or Long) based on the detected granularity level.
    *   **Parallel Decoding:** The decoding core features a parallel architecture, allowing simultaneous lookups in multiple potential tables. The correct table is selected via a multiplexer.
    *   **Error Handling:** If an invalid granularity indicator is detected, the decoder enters an error recovery mode.

**Pseudocode (Decoding):**

```
function decode_block(input_bits):
    granularity_indicator = input_bits[0:2]
    
    if granularity_indicator == "00":
        selected_table = micro_table
    elif granularity_indicator == "01":
        selected_table = short_table
    elif granularity_indicator == "10":
        selected_table = medium_table
    elif granularity_indicator == "11":
        selected_table = long_table
    else:
        // Error Handling - Invalid Granularity Indicator
        return error_state
    
    encoded_symbol = input_bits[2: (2 + symbol_length)]  // symbol_length depends on the selected table
    
    decoded_symbol = selected_table.lookup(encoded_symbol)
    
    return decoded_symbol
```

**Refinement Details:**

*   **Dynamic Table Sizing:** The lookup tables should be dynamically sized. Less frequent symbols should be stored in larger tables, while more frequent symbols can be consolidated into smaller tables.
*   **Adaptive Entropy Calculation:** The entropy calculation should be adaptive, adjusting its window size based on the data stream's characteristics.
*   **Power Management:** Implement power-saving modes for infrequently used lookup tables. This can involve storing the table contents in low-power memory or shutting down the table entirely.
*    **Resource Allocation:** A dedicated hardware resource manager will allocate memory and processing power to each decoding table based on its current activity level. This will ensure efficient use of resources and prevent bottlenecks.
