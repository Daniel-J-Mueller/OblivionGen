## Personalized Media 'Mood' Generation

**Concept:** Extend dynamic manifest generation to incorporate not just device attributes and quality preferences, but *predicted* or *explicitly stated* user mood/emotional state to dynamically tailor media presentation *beyond* simple resolution/bitrate selection.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

1.  **Mood Inference Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Device data (time of day, location if permitted, activity – motion sensor data), historical viewing data, optional explicit mood input from user (e.g., via app interface: "Happy," "Relaxed," "Focused," "Energetic," "Sad").
    *   **Processing:** Machine learning model trained to infer user mood state. Could be a multi-layer perceptron or recurrent neural network.  Emphasis on probabilistic output (e.g., 70% Relaxed, 20% Neutral, 10% Energetic) rather than single-state assignment.
    *   **Output:** Mood vector – a numerical representation of the user’s emotional state.

2.  **Mood-to-Manifest Mapping Database:**
    *   **Structure:**  A database linking mood vectors to specific manifest modifications. Each entry contains:
        *   Mood Vector Range:  Defines the range of mood vectors this mapping applies to.
        *   Manifest Modification Rules:  Detailed instructions for altering the manifest.  Examples:
            *   Color Grading Preset: Apply a specific color filter to the video stream.
            *   Soundscape Overlay: Add ambient sounds (e.g., rain, coffee shop, upbeat music) to the audio track.
            *   Scene Transition Style: Adjust the style of scene transitions (e.g., slow fades for relaxed mood, quick cuts for energetic mood).
            *   Framerate Adjustment: Subtle framerate adjustments for a smoother or more dynamic feel.
            *   Content Emphasis:  If the media contains multiple audio tracks or camera angles, select the ones best suited to the mood.
            *   Dynamic Subtitle Styling: Adjust subtitle font, color, and animation based on mood.

3.  **Manifest Generation Service (Modified):**
    *   **Input:** Device Attributes, User Mood Vector, Master Manifest Data Identifier.
    *   **Processing:**
        1.  Receive device data and mood vector.
        2.  Query Mood-to-Manifest Mapping Database to find the best matching manifest modification rules.
        3.  Apply the rules to the master manifest data to create a dynamic manifest.
        4.  Return the dynamic manifest.

**II. System Architecture:**

```
[User Device] --> [Mood Inference Engine] --> [Manifest Generation Service] --> [CDN] --> [User Device]
      ^
      |
[Explicit Mood Input (Optional)]
```

**III. Pseudocode (Manifest Generation Service):**

```
function GenerateDynamicManifest(deviceData, moodVector, masterManifestId):
  moodMapping = QueryMoodMappingDatabase(moodVector)

  dynamicManifest = Clone(GetMasterManifest(masterManifestId))

  // Apply modifications
  if (moodMapping.colorGradingPreset != null):
    ApplyColorGrading(dynamicManifest, moodMapping.colorGradingPreset)

  if (moodMapping.soundscapeOverlay != null):
    AddSoundscape(dynamicManifest, moodMapping.soundscapeOverlay)

  // ... other modifications

  return dynamicManifest
```

**IV.  Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Mood inference based on device data must be handled with strict privacy safeguards. User consent is essential. Explicit mood input should be encouraged as a more privacy-preserving alternative.
*   **Scalability:**  The Mood-to-Manifest Mapping Database must be efficiently scalable to handle a large number of users and mood states.
*   **Content Compatibility:**  Manifest modifications should be designed to be compatible with a wide range of media content.
*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to customize the mood-to-manifest mappings to their preferences.
*   **A/B Testing:** Continuously A/B test different mood-to-manifest mappings to optimize the user experience.
