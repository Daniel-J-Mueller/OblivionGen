## Dynamic Haptic Texture Shifting

**Concept:** An electronic device incorporating a surface capable of dynamically shifting haptic textures *without* mechanical protrusions. This is achieved through localized, controlled thermal variations and electrostatic charge manipulation to alter the perceived friction coefficient.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Integration:** Designed for integration into a device with a touch-sensitive display (e.g., smartphone, tablet, smartwatch). Area coverage approximately 100mm x 150mm.
*   **Layer 1: Transparent Heating Element:** Ultra-thin, transparent resistive heating layer (Indium Tin Oxide or similar) patterned with micro-heaters. Resolution: 50 heaters per cm². Control: Each heater independently addressable via micro-controller. Temperature range: 20°C - 45°C (localized).
*   **Layer 2: Dielectric Layer:** Thin layer of dielectric material (e.g., silicon nitride) to isolate the heating element from the electrostatic layer.
*   **Layer 3: Electrostatic Charge Control Layer:**  Array of individually addressable micro-capacitors formed from transparent conductive material. Resolution: 50 capacitors per cm². Voltage range: 0V - 200V. Polarity control:  Each capacitor capable of both positive and negative charge accumulation.
*   **Layer 4:  Surface Layer:**  A smooth, durable, transparent coating (e.g., chemically strengthened glass or polymer) to protect the internal layers and provide a tactile surface.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller with sufficient processing power to manage the heating element and electrostatic charge control layers in real-time.
    *   Algorithm to map desired textures (e.g., wood grain, fabric, metal) to specific temperature and electrostatic charge patterns.
    *   Sensor Suite: Capacitive proximity sensor to detect user touch, and temperature sensor to monitor surface temperature and prevent overheating.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Texture Mapping Function
function mapTexture(textureName) {
  if (textureName == "woodGrain") {
    // Define temperature and electrostatic charge pattern for wood grain
    for (i = 0 to width) {
      for (j = 0 to height) {
        temperature[i][j] = waveFunction(i,j); //Simulate wood grain pattern
        charge[i][j] = noiseFunction(i,j) * polarity; //add randomized electrostatic noise
      }
    }
  } else if (textureName == "fabric") {
    //Define temperature and electrostatic charge pattern for fabric
    //... similar logic as above
  } else {
    //Default to smooth surface
    temperature = 25°C;
    charge = 0V;
  }
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
  //Detect user touch via proximity sensor
  if (userTouchDetected) {
    //Get requested texture from user interface
    requestedTexture = getUserTexture();

    //Map texture to temperature and charge patterns
    mapTexture(requestedTexture);

    //Apply temperature and charge to layers
    setTemperature(temperature);
    setCharge(charge);
  } else {
    //Default to smooth surface
    setTemperature(25°C);
    setCharge(0V);
  }
}
```

**Innovation Detail:**  The device creates the *illusion* of texture by subtly altering the friction coefficient of the surface through thermal gradients and electrostatic attraction/repulsion.  Higher temperature and increased electrostatic charge decrease friction, while lower temperature and reduced charge increase friction.  Rapidly switching these parameters creates a dynamic, perceived texture that can be customized and changed on-demand.  This is unlike existing haptic technologies which rely on mechanical movement. This allows for infinitely variable textures to be created on a completely smooth surface, without requiring any mechanical parts.
