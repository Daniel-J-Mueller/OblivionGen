## Secure Ephemeral Resource Access via Biometric-Keyed Time-Limited URLs

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of embedding cryptographic keys within URLs, but introduce biometric authentication *before* the key is revealed and utilized. This creates a system for highly secure, time-limited access to resources, even in scenarios where the initial URL might be compromised. It moves beyond simple signature verification to active, real-time biometric confirmation.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Requestor Device:** A device capable of biometric scanning (fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scan, etc.) and possessing a secure enclave or TPM for storing a private key.
*   **Authentication Server:** A server responsible for verifying biometric data and generating time-limited, cryptographically signed URLs.
*   **Resource Server:** The server hosting the protected resource, responsible for validating the signed URL and granting access.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Resource Request:** A user (via Requestor Device) requests access to a resource. The user initiates a biometric scan.
2.  **Biometric Authentication:** The Requestor Device captures biometric data and sends it (encrypted) to the Authentication Server.
3.  **Identity Verification:** The Authentication Server verifies the user's identity based on the biometric data.  This could involve matching against a pre-enrolled biometric template.
4.  **URL Generation:** Upon successful authentication, the Authentication Server generates a unique URL containing:
    *   A resource identifier.
    *   A symmetric encryption key (e.g., AES-256) for encrypting communication between the Requestor and Resource Server.
    *   A timestamp indicating the URL’s expiration time.
    *   A digital signature generated using a private key associated with the Authentication Server. The signature covers the resource identifier, encryption key, timestamp, and potentially other relevant data.
    *   A ‘nonce’ – a random number to prevent replay attacks.
5.  **URL Delivery:** The generated URL is delivered to the Requestor Device.
6.  **Resource Access:** The Requestor Device opens the URL. This triggers a request to the Resource Server.
7.  **URL Validation:** The Resource Server:
    *   Verifies the digital signature of the URL.
    *   Checks the timestamp to ensure the URL has not expired.
    *   Confirms the nonce is unique (not previously used).
    *   If all validations pass, the Resource Server extracts the symmetric encryption key.
8.  **Secure Communication:** The Resource Server and Requestor Device establish a secure communication channel using the extracted symmetric key.  The requested resource is then transmitted.

**3. Pseudocode (Resource Server – URL Validation):**

```
function validateURL(url):
  signature = extractSignature(url)
  resourceID = extractResourceID(url)
  encryptionKey = extractEncryptionKey(url)
  timestamp = extractTimestamp(url)
  nonce = extractNonce(url)

  if not verifySignature(url, authenticationServerPublicKey):
    return false // Signature invalid

  if timestamp < currentTime:
    return false // URL expired

  if isNonceUsed(nonce):
    return false // Nonce reused

  return true // URL valid

```

**4. Security Considerations:**

*   **Biometric Spoofing:** Implement liveness detection techniques to prevent the use of fake biometric data.
*   **Secure Enclave:** Utilize a secure enclave or TPM on the Requestor Device to protect the user's private key and biometric data.
*   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate the keys used for signing URLs.
*   **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Always use TLS to encrypt communication between all components.
*   **Revocation:** Implement a mechanism to revoke URLs in case of compromise.



**Novelty:** This system adds a layer of *active* biometric authentication to the existing concept of embedding keys in URLs.  It's not just verifying a signature; it's requiring live biometric confirmation before access is granted, making it significantly more secure against replay attacks and unauthorized access. The time-limited aspect further enhances security by reducing the window of opportunity for exploitation.
