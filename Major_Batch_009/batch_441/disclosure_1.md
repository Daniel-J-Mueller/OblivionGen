## Autonomous Device Swarm Coordination via Bioacoustic Principles

**Concept:** Expand the single AMD control paradigm to a multi-AMD ‘swarm’ dynamically organized using principles observed in animal aggregation (flocking, schooling, swarming). The existing speech control acts as an initial ‘seed’ for swarm behavior, but the primary coordination mechanism shifts to bioacoustic emulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each AMD equipped with a low-frequency (20-200Hz) transducer for both emission and reception.  Transducer directionality configurable via internal actuators.
    *   High-sensitivity microphone array to capture ambient sound, isolating and interpreting AMD-generated bioacoustic signals.
    *   Increased onboard processing to handle real-time signal analysis and modulation.
*   **Software - Core Bioacoustic Engine:**
    *   **Signal Library:** Pre-loaded with a library of synthesized bioacoustic ‘primitives’ – variations of pulsed signals, frequency sweeps, and amplitude modulation patterns mimicking the communication methods of schooling fish, insect swarms, or bird flocks.
    *   **Contextual Modulation:**  The initial speech command (processed as in the parent patent) triggers a ‘behavioral state’ within each AMD. This state dictates the *type* of bioacoustic signal emitted.  Example: “Clean the living room” -> “exploration/coverage” state ->  AMD emits a pulsed signal with a specific frequency band and pulse repetition rate.
    *   **Proximity/Collision Avoidance:** Each AMD continuously emits a low-power ‘ping’ signal.  Received signals from other AMDs are analyzed for time-of-flight and signal strength to determine proximity and velocity.  Adjustments to bioacoustic signal timing & amplitude are made to avoid collisions and maintain optimal spacing.  Think of it as echolocation between the devices.
    *   **Coverage Mapping:** As AMDs explore, they generate a bioacoustic ‘beacon’ signal indicating their location and coverage area.  Other AMDs ‘listen’ for these beacons to create a dynamic coverage map.  Areas with low beacon density represent areas needing attention.
    *   **Task Allocation:**  The initial speech command also influences the *modulation* of the beacon signal.  For example, an AMD set to ‘clean’ might emit a beacon with a specific amplitude modulation indicating its cleaning status.  Nearby AMDs can detect this and coordinate to avoid redundant cleaning.
*   **Software – User Interface Integration:**
    *   **Visual Swarm Representation:**  The user device displays a real-time visualization of the swarm, showing AMD locations, coverage areas, and task assignments.
    *   **Bioacoustic Signal Visualization:** Option to visualize the emitted and received bioacoustic signals, allowing users to understand swarm behavior.
    *   **Swarm ‘Personality’ Control:**  User-adjustable parameters to control swarm behavior, such as aggregation density, exploration radius, and task prioritization. (e.g. "Aggressive Cleaning" vs. "Gentle Coverage").

**Pseudocode - AMD Behavior Loop:**

```
loop:
    receive_speech_command()
    determine_command_type()
    if command_corresponds_to_AMD:
        set_behavioral_state(command_type)
        emit_bioacoustic_signal(behavioral_state)
    receive_bioacoustic_signals_from_other_AMDs
    analyze_signals_for_proximity_and_task_status
    adjust_movement_and_task_allocation_based_on_analysis
    transmit_location_and_task_status_as_bioacoustic_beacon
    repeat
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond direct voice control to an emergent coordination system inspired by natural swarming behaviors. The bioacoustic communication allows for more robust and flexible coordination than relying solely on centralized control or pre-programmed routines.  The swarm adapts to the environment and dynamically distributes tasks without explicit direction.
