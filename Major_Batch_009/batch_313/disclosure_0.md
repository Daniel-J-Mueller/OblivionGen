## Illuminated Signal Device - Predictive Hazard Mapping & AR Overlay

**Concept:** Expand the illuminated signal device's capabilities beyond simple speed detection to create a localized predictive hazard map, viewable via augmented reality (AR) on a connected device. This aims to move from reactive speed monitoring to proactive hazard anticipation, enhancing safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Radar Device (as in original patent) - For vehicle speed and distance.
    *   LiDAR Module – High-resolution depth mapping of surrounding environment (pedestrians, cyclists, obstacles). Minimum 120° horizontal field of view.
    *   Low-Light Camera – Enhanced visibility in dark conditions for object recognition.
    *   Environmental Sensors – Temperature, humidity, precipitation detection for hazard prediction (e.g., black ice).
    *   Microphone Array – Ambient sound analysis for emergency vehicle sirens or anomalous sounds.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge computing capable processor (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano or equivalent) – For real-time data fusion and hazard analysis.
*   **Communication:** 5G/WiFi 6E connectivity for low-latency data transmission.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable battery with solar charging option (as in original patent).
*   **Illumination:** Programmable RGB LED array for customized hazard warnings.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Data Fusion Engine:**
    *   Combines data from all sensors to create a 3D environmental map.
    *   Utilizes object recognition algorithms to identify pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles, and other potential hazards.
    *   Implements sensor fusion techniques (e.g., Kalman filtering) to improve accuracy and reduce noise.
*   **Predictive Hazard Algorithm:**
    *   Analyzes movement patterns and trajectories of detected objects to predict potential collisions or near misses.
    *   Considers environmental factors (weather, road conditions) to adjust risk assessment.
    *   Leverages machine learning models trained on historical accident data to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **AR Overlay Application:**
    *   Receives hazard data from the illuminated signal device.
    *   Overlays visual warnings onto the user's camera view (smartphone, AR glasses).
    *   Displays real-time hazard information: distance to hazard, predicted time to collision, severity of risk.
    *   Offers customizable warning styles: color-coded alerts, directional arrows, visual highlighting.
    *   Allows users to set personalized safety preferences (e.g., alert sensitivity, hazard type filtering).

**Pseudocode (Hazard Prediction Logic):**

```
FUNCTION predict_hazard(radar_data, lidar_data, camera_data, env_data):
    // Data Preprocessing
    objects = identify_objects(camera_data, lidar_data)
    velocities = calculate_velocities(objects, radar_data)
    environment = assess_environment(env_data)

    // Trajectory Prediction
    predicted_trajectories = predict_object_paths(objects, velocities)

    // Collision Detection
    potential_collisions = detect_collisions(predicted_trajectories)

    // Risk Assessment
    risk_level = calculate_risk(potential_collisions, environment)

    // Alert Generation
    IF risk_level > threshold:
        generate_alert(risk_level, object_location, predicted_collision_time)

    RETURN risk_level
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  The illuminated signal device continuously scans the surrounding environment.
2.  Sensor data is processed by the edge computing unit.
3.  The predictive hazard algorithm analyzes the data and identifies potential risks.
4.  If a hazard is detected, an alert is generated and transmitted to the user’s device.
5.  The AR overlay application displays the hazard information in real-time.
