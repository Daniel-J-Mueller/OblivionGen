## Dynamic Key Orchestration via Biometric Attestation

**System Overview:** A system extending the described key distribution mechanism by incorporating biometric attestation of physical nodes *before* key transmission. This aims to mitigate rogue node attacks and enhance security within virtualized network environments. The system introduces a “Trust Score” for each physical node, influencing key rotation frequency and access privileges.

**Components:**

*   **Attestation Module:** Integrated within each physical node. Captures biometric data (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint) from authorized administrators *during initial node onboarding*. This data isn’t stored raw but used to generate a unique cryptographic challenge response profile.
*   **Trust Authority (TA):** A centralized service responsible for managing Trust Scores, verifying biometric attestations, and coordinating key distribution.  Operates in conjunction with the existing mapping service.
*   **Key Orchestration Service (KOS):** An extension of the existing key distribution mechanism. Receives Trust Scores from the TA and adjusts key rotation, key version selection, and access control based on these scores.
*   **Physical Nodes:**  Nodes equipped with Attestation Modules. Initiate attestation challenges periodically or upon request from the Trust Authority.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Onboarding:** Administrator authenticates to the physical node and provides biometric data.  A cryptographic profile is derived and securely registered with the Trust Authority.
2.  **Periodic Attestation:** The Trust Authority initiates a random attestation challenge to the physical node. The Attestation Module captures the administrator’s biometric data and generates a response.
3.  **Verification:** The Trust Authority verifies the response against the registered profile.  A Trust Score is assigned based on verification success, speed, and quality.
4.  **Key Orchestration:** The Key Orchestration Service receives the Trust Score. 
    *   **High Trust Score:** Node receives the latest key version with standard rotation frequency.  Full access to virtual network resources.
    *   **Medium Trust Score:** Node receives a slightly older key version with increased rotation frequency.  Access to critical resources may be limited.
    *   **Low Trust Score:** Node receives an outdated key version with very frequent rotation. Access to all resources is restricted. An alert is generated for administrative review.  May trigger temporary isolation of the node.
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Trust Scores are continuously updated based on attestation results and network behavior. This allows the system to adapt to changing security conditions.

**Pseudocode (Key Orchestration Service):**

```
function distributeKey(physicalNodeAddress, virtualNetworkAddress):
  trustScore = getTrustScore(physicalNodeAddress)

  if trustScore > 0.8:
    keyVersion = latestKeyVersion
    rotationFrequency = standardRotationFrequency
    accessLevel = fullAccess
  else if trustScore > 0.5:
    keyVersion = previousKeyVersion
    rotationFrequency = increasedRotationFrequency
    accessLevel = limitedAccess
  else:
    keyVersion = outdatedKeyVersion
    rotationFrequency = veryIncreasedRotationFrequency
    accessLevel = restrictedAccess
    generateAlert(physicalNodeAddress)

  transmitKey(physicalNodeAddress, keyVersion)
  setRotationFrequency(physicalNodeAddress, rotationFrequency)
  setAccessLevel(physicalNodeAddress, accessLevel)
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Biometric Modalities:** Support for fingerprint, facial recognition, and voiceprint.  Future extensibility for other modalities.
*   **Attestation Challenge Frequency:**  Randomized, configurable interval (e.g., 1-24 hours).
*   **Key Versioning:**  Support for multiple key versions to allow for smooth rotation and fallback.
*   **Trust Score Algorithm:**  Weighted combination of attestation success rate, verification speed, and biometric data quality.
*   **Alerting System:**  Integration with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
*   **API Integration:**  Open APIs for integration with third-party security tools.
*   **Secure Enclave Integration:** Leverage secure enclaves within physical nodes to protect biometric data and cryptographic keys.
