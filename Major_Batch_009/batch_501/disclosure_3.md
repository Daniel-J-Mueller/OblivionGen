## Modular Acoustic Shell with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** A voice-controlled assistant housed within a dynamically configurable acoustic shell, capable of physically reshaping itself to optimize sound projection and incorporate haptic feedback for user interaction.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Unit:** A cylindrical housing containing the voice assistant’s core processing, speakers, microphones, and magnetic/alignment elements as described in the provided patent. This unit is the constant element.

*   **Acoustic Modules:** Interchangeable, geometrically diverse modules that magnetically attach to the core unit. Modules are constructed from a sound-diffusing material (e.g., textured plastic, fabric-covered foam) and contain embedded micro-actuators.
    *   Module types:
        *   **Reflector Modules:** Concave or convex surfaces to focus or disperse sound.
        *   **Absorber Modules:** Porous materials to dampen sound reflections.
        *   **Directional Modules:** Horn-shaped or slotted modules to project sound in specific directions.
        *   **Haptic Modules:** Modules with small, localized vibration motors controlled by the assistant.

*   **Actuation System:** Each module incorporates a network of micro-actuators (e.g., piezoelectric, shape-memory alloy) enabling slight adjustments to its shape and orientation. Controlled via a dedicated microcontroller within each module, synchronized with the core unit.

*   **Control System:**
    *   The voice assistant analyzes the acoustic environment (using onboard microphones) and user preferences to determine the optimal shell configuration.
    *   It sends commands to the module microcontrollers, adjusting module shapes and orientations.
    *   Haptic feedback is triggered based on user voice commands or interactions. Example: a pulse when a timer finishes, a ripple effect during music playback.

*   **Power:** Wireless power transfer to modules.

*   **Materials:**
    *   Module Shell: Durable, lightweight plastic or composite material with integrated micro-actuators.
    *   Acoustic Dampening: Sound-absorbing foam or fabric.
    *   Connectors: High-strength magnets and alignment guides for secure module attachment.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Core Unit - Main Loop

while (true) {
    // 1. Analyze Acoustic Environment
    acousticData = analyzeRoom();

    // 2. Determine Optimal Configuration
    optimalConfig = calculateConfiguration(acousticData, userPreferences);

    // 3. Send Configuration Commands to Modules
    for each module in moduleList {
        sendCommand(module, optimalConfig[module]);
    }

    // 4. Process Voice Commands and Trigger Haptics
    command = processVoiceCommand();
    if (command == "timer_done") {
        triggerHapticFeedback(moduleList[0], "pulse"); // Example
    }
}

// Module Microcontroller - Module Loop
while (true) {
    command = receiveCommand();
    adjustShape(command);
}
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond static sound control. The dynamic shell adapts to the user’s environment and preferences in real-time, creating a personalized audio experience and adding a new dimension of tactile feedback to voice interactions. This fosters a more immersive and engaging user interface.
