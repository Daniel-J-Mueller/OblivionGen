## Adaptive Key Rotation via Behavioral Biometrics

**System Overview:** A cryptographic key management system integrated with real-time user behavioral analysis to dynamically adjust key rotation schedules and access control policies.

**Motivation:** The provided patent focuses on secure key *import* and lifecycle. This expands on that, focusing on *ongoing* security, adapting to user behavior and potential compromise *after* import. Existing systems often rely on static rotation schedules, which may be overly conservative or insufficient given actual user activity.

**Core Innovation:** Tie key rotation frequency and access control levels to a continuous stream of behavioral biometrics.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Acquisition:**
    *   Capture a wide range of user behavioral data during typical system interactions. This includes:
        *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, error rate).
        *   Mouse movements (speed, trajectory, click patterns).
        *   Scrolling behavior.
        *   Application usage patterns (time spent in each application, order of application launches).
        *   Network activity (typical access times, data transfer rates).
        *   Geolocation data (if permissible and relevant).
    *   Data is collected via system hooks and APIs, ensuring minimal performance impact.
    *   All behavioral data is anonymized and encrypted at rest and in transit.

2.  **Baseline Profile Creation:**
    *   Upon initial user registration, a baseline behavioral profile is established. This involves collecting behavioral data over a defined period (e.g., one week) to capture normal usage patterns.
    *   The profile is represented as a statistical model, capturing the mean, standard deviation, and other relevant metrics for each behavioral feature.
    *   Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian Mixture Models) are used to model temporal dependencies and identify typical behavioral sequences.

3.  **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:**
    *   As the user interacts with the system, real-time behavioral data is compared to the baseline profile.
    *   Anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., outlier detection, change point detection) identify deviations from normal behavior.
    *   A risk score is calculated based on the severity and frequency of anomalies.

4.  **Dynamic Key Rotation:**
    *   The key rotation schedule is dynamically adjusted based on the risk score.
    *   High-risk scores trigger immediate key rotation.
    *   Moderate-risk scores shorten the key rotation interval.
    *   Low-risk scores maintain the standard key rotation schedule.
    *   Rotation utilizes existing key derivation functions (KDFs) to minimize disruption.

5.  **Adaptive Access Control:**
    *   Access control policies are dynamically adjusted based on the risk score.
    *   High-risk scores trigger stricter access control measures (e.g., multi-factor authentication, temporary account lockout).
    *   Moderate-risk scores increase the level of scrutiny for sensitive operations.
    *   Low-risk scores maintain the standard access control policies.

6.  **System Architecture:**
    *   Behavioral Data Collector: A system hook/API-based component that collects behavioral data.
    *   Anomaly Detection Engine: A machine learning-based component that analyzes behavioral data and calculates risk scores.
    *   Key Management Service: An existing service, augmented to support dynamic key rotation and adaptive access control.
    *   Policy Engine: A component that enforces adaptive access control policies based on risk scores.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine):**

```
function detectAnomaly(behavioralData, baselineProfile):
  anomalyScore = 0

  for each feature in behavioralData:
    deviation = abs(behavioralData[feature] - baselineProfile[feature])
    standardizedDeviation = deviation / baselineProfile[feature].standardDeviation
    anomalyScore += standardizedDeviation

  if anomalyScore > threshold:
    return "High Risk"
  elif anomalyScore > moderateThreshold:
    return "Moderate Risk"
  else:
    return "Low Risk"
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with threat intelligence feeds to correlate behavioral anomalies with known attack patterns.
*   User profiling based on behavioral biometrics to personalize security settings.
*   Adaptive authentication based on behavioral biometrics.
*   Federated learning to improve anomaly detection models without sharing raw behavioral data.
