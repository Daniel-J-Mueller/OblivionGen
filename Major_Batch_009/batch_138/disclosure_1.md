## Dynamic Content Personalization Based on Mode of Transportation & Passenger Activity

**Concept:** Leverage onboard sensors and passenger device data to dynamically adjust content delivery – not just pre-selecting content based on the *mode* of transport, but *during* the journey, based on observed passenger behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensor Integration:**

*   **Onboard Sensors:** Integrate access to data from the mode of transportation’s sensors (if available). This includes:
    *   **Turbulence/Motion Sensors:** (Aircraft, Trains) Detect ride quality.
    *   **Lighting Data:** (All Modes) Ambient light levels.
    *   **Noise Level Sensors:** (All Modes) Detect environmental sound.
    *   **Location Data:** (GPS/Network triangulation) – Track progress & anticipate upcoming events (scenic views, landing, arrival).
*   **Passenger Device Integration (Opt-In):**  Request permission to access (anonymized) data from passenger devices:
    *   **Headphone Usage:**  Detect content consumption.
    *   **Screen Orientation/Activity:**  Detect reading, gaming, video viewing.
    *   **Device Motion:** (Accelerometer/Gyroscope) –  Infer passenger activity (sitting, walking).

**2. Dynamic Content Profile Creation:**

*   **Baseline Profile:** Create a user profile based on historical content preferences (streaming services, purchased media).
*   **Contextual Adjustment:**  Modify the profile *in real-time* based on:
    *   **Mode of Transport:** (Aircraft, Train, Bus, etc.).
    *   **Time of Day:** (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
    *   **Ride Quality:** (Smooth, Turbulent).
    *   **Passenger Activity:** (Reading, Gaming, Sleeping, Watching Video).
    *   **Location Data:** (Proximity to points of interest).

**3. Content Delivery Engine:**

*   **Content Sources:** Access content from:
    *   Pre-loaded onboard storage.
    *   Cloud streaming services (when available).
    *   User’s personal devices (with permission).
*   **Adaptive Streaming:** Prioritize content based on available bandwidth. If bandwidth is limited, serve lower-resolution versions or pre-downloaded content.
*   **Content Recommendations:** Suggest content based on the dynamic profile. Examples:
    *   **Turbulence:** Recommend calming music or audiobooks.
    *   **Smooth Ride:** Suggest action-packed video content.
    *   **Reading:** Offer relevant articles or ebooks.
    *   **Scenic View:** Provide informational content about the landscape.
*   **Automated Playlist Generation:** Create personalized playlists based on passenger preferences and context.

**4. Pseudocode (Content Selection Logic):**

```
FUNCTION SelectContent(userProfile, transportMode, rideQuality, passengerActivity, locationData):
  contentPool = GetContentPool(userProfile, transportMode)

  IF rideQuality == "Turbulent":
    priorityContent = FilterContent(contentPool, genre="Calming", type="Audio")
  ELSE IF passengerActivity == "Reading":
    priorityContent = FilterContent(contentPool, type="Ebook", category="Relevant to Location")
  ELSE:
    priorityContent = contentPool  // Default to user preferences

  IF bandwidth < threshold:
    priorityContent = FilterContent(priorityContent, type="Pre-Downloaded")

  selectedContent = SortContent(priorityContent, relevanceScore)
  return selectedContent
```

**5.  User Interface (Passenger Device):**

*   **Content Discovery:**  Browse curated content recommendations.
*   **Personalized Playlists:**  Access auto-generated playlists.
*   **Content Control:**  Pause, skip, rewind, adjust volume.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:**  Rate content and provide preferences.
*   **Opt-In/Opt-Out Settings:**  Control data sharing and personalization.
