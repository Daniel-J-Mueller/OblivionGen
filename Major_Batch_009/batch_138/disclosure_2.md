## Adaptive Glyph Contextualization for Dynamic Script Identification

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on determining text lines based on glyph *pair* relationships. This extension aims to build a system that not only identifies text lines but also *dynamically identifies the script* (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese) *within* those lines, adapting its feature extraction based on the detected script characteristics. This facilitates more robust OCR and text analysis in multi-script documents.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Initial Glyph Feature Extraction:**
    *   Extract a broad range of glyph features (height, width, stroke width, aspect ratio, loop closures, concavity/convexity, radical/component analysis â€“ *crucially including features relevant to multiple scripts*).
    *   Store these features in a multi-dimensional feature vector per glyph.

2.  **Probabilistic Script Classification Module (PSCM):**
    *   Implement a hierarchical Bayesian network (or similar probabilistic model) to estimate the probability of each script given the initial feature vector.
    *   The network should be trained on a large dataset of glyphs representing various scripts.
    *   Output a probability distribution over scripts for each glyph.

3.  **Dynamic Feature Adaptation (DFA) Engine:**
    *   Based on the script probability distribution from the PSCM, the DFA engine *selects and weights* the most relevant glyph features for subsequent analysis.
    *   *Example:* For a likely Chinese glyph, radical/component analysis receives high weighting; for a likely Latin glyph, stroke width and loop closures are prioritized.
    *   *Implementation:* Use a weighted sum or a learned transformation matrix to combine the features.

4.  **Enhanced Glyph Pair Scoring:**
    *   The existing glyph pair scoring mechanism is *modified* to incorporate the dynamically weighted features.
    *   The score is calculated based on the weighted feature differences between glyphs.
    *   *Crucially*, different scoring functions may be used for different script families.

5.  **Text Line Reconstruction & Script Identification:**
    *   Utilize a graph-based approach to reconstruct text lines based on the enhanced glyph pair scores.
    *   The dominant script within each text line is determined by aggregating the script probabilities of the constituent glyphs.
    *   Output: Text line segments with identified script.

**Pseudocode (Simplified DFA Engine):**

```python
def dynamic_feature_adaptation(glyph_features, script_probabilities, feature_weights):
    """
    Adapts glyph features based on script probabilities.

    Args:
        glyph_features (list): List of raw glyph features.
        script_probabilities (list): List of script probabilities for each feature.
        feature_weights (dict): Dictionary of pre-defined feature weights for each script.

    Returns:
        adapted_features (list): List of adapted glyph features.
    """

    adapted_features = []
    for i in range(len(glyph_features)):
        weighted_sum = 0
        for script, weights in feature_weights.items():
            weighted_sum += script_probabilities[script] * weights[i]
        adapted_features.append(weighted_sum)

    return adapted_features
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for probabilistic modeling and feature extraction.
*   Large RAM capacity for storing glyph feature vectors and probabilistic models.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Adaptive language modeling integration to further refine script identification.
*   Online script identification for real-time text processing.
*   Automatic script-specific OCR engine selection.
