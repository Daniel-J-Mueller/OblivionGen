## Modular, Self-Balancing Rack Power System with Integrated Kinetic Energy Harvesting

**Concept:** A rack power distribution system utilizing modular PDUs with bidirectional power flow, coupled with kinetic energy harvesting from rack movement/vibration to supplement power and improve efficiency. The system aims to create a self-balancing, resilient power infrastructure within the data center.

**Specs:**

**1. Modular PDU Units (MPDU):**

*   **Dimensions:** 1U height, varying widths (1/2, 1, 2 width options).
*   **Input:** Accepts standard power cables (L6-30P, etc.). Multiple input connections per MPDU (2-4) for redundancy & load balancing.
*   **Output:** Standard outlet types (NEMA 5-15R, C13, C19, etc.). Configurable outlet mix per MPDU.
*   **Bidirectional DC/DC Converters:** Each outlet is fed by a DC/DC converter capable of both drawing and supplying power to a central DC bus. Converter capacity: 500W – 2kW per outlet.
*   **Digital Power Metering:** Integrated power monitoring per outlet (Voltage, Current, Power, Energy).
*   **Communication:** Ethernet/RS485 interface for remote monitoring & control. Modbus TCP/RTU protocol.
*   **Physical:** Aluminum enclosure with fanless convection cooling.

**2. Central DC Bus:**

*   **Voltage:** 48V DC.
*   **Capacity:** Scalable, built from redundant DC power supplies (10kW – 100kW modules).
*   **Energy Storage:** Integrated flywheel-based kinetic energy storage system (KESS). Flywheel RPM target: 10,000 RPM. KESS capacity: Scalable, target 10kWh per rack.
*   **Control System:** Centralized controller managing power flow, load balancing, KESS charging/discharging, and monitoring.

**3. Rack Integration & Kinetic Harvesting:**

*   **Rack Mounting:** MPDUs mount horizontally within rack rails.
*   **Vibration Sensors:** Piezoelectric vibration sensors mounted to rack posts and MPDU enclosures. Detect rack movement and vibrations.
*   **Kinetic Energy Conversion:** Vibration energy converted into electrical energy using piezoelectric generators.
*   **Energy Routing:** Harvested energy fed into the central DC bus to supplement power.

**4. Software & Control:**

*   **Dashboard:** Real-time monitoring of power usage, KESS status, and kinetic energy harvesting.
*   **Load Balancing:** Automatic power redistribution to prevent overloads and maximize efficiency.
*   **Predictive Failure Analysis:** Algorithms to detect potential power supply or PDU failures.
*   **Remote Control:** Ability to remotely power cycle outlets or adjust power limits.
*   **API:** Open API for integration with data center infrastructure management (DCIM) systems.

**Pseudocode - Load Balancing Algorithm:**

```
function balanceLoad(rackPDUs) {
  // Calculate total power draw across all PDUs
  totalPower = sum(rackPDUs.powerDraw)

  // Calculate average power draw per PDU
  averagePower = totalPower / rackPDUs.length

  // Iterate through each PDU
  for each PDU in rackPDUs {
    // If PDU power draw is above average
    if PDU.powerDraw > averagePower {
      // Identify underutilized PDUs
      underutilizedPDUs = findPDUsWhere(PDU.powerDraw < averagePower)

      // If underutilized PDUs exist
      if underutilizedPDUs.length > 0 {
        // Redistribute load from overloaded PDU to underutilized PDU
        transferLoad(overloadedPDU, underutilizedPDU, loadAmount)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Innovation:** The system combines modularity, bidirectional power flow, and kinetic energy harvesting to create a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable data center power infrastructure. The KESS provides short-term backup power and smooths out power fluctuations. The kinetic energy harvesting reduces reliance on grid power.
