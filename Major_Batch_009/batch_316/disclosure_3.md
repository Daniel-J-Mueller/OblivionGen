## Dynamic Schema Evolution via Query Language

**Concept:** Extend the ability to not only *query* a non-relational database using a relational query language, but to *define and evolve* the schema of the non-relational database *through* that same query language. This creates a unified interface for both data access and data definition, simplifying database administration and enabling more agile development practices.

**Specification:**

**1. Schema Definition Language (SDL) Extension:**

*   Augment the supported relational query language with a set of commands for schema manipulation. These commands are recognizable by the query engine as schema definition instructions *instead* of data queries.
*   Examples:
    *   `CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name STRING, email STRING);` - Creates a logical 'table' definition. The query engine translates this into the appropriate collection/document structure within the non-relational database.
    *   `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INT;` - Modifies the existing schema.
    *   `DROP TABLE users;` - Deletes the logical table and associated data.
*   The engine maintains a metadata layer that maps these logical schema definitions to the actual physical storage format of the non-relational database.

**2. Dynamic Schema Mapping:**

*   Implement a flexible mapping mechanism that allows the translation of relational schema definitions to various non-relational data models (document, graph, key-value, etc.).
*   This mapping is configurable and allows administrators to optimize the physical storage format for specific query patterns.
*   The mapping process must handle data type conversions, indexing strategies, and other physical storage considerations.

**3. Query Engine Integration:**

*   The query engine must be able to parse incoming requests and determine whether they are data queries or schema definition commands.
*   Schema definition commands are routed to a separate schema management module that handles the translation and execution of the commands.
*   The engine must maintain consistency between the logical schema definitions and the physical storage format. Any schema changes must be reflected in the metadata layer and propagated to the underlying database.

**4. API Extensions:**

*   Introduce new APIs to support schema management operations. These APIs can be exposed to external applications and tools, allowing programmatic schema manipulation.
*   Example API calls:
    *   `createTable(tableName, columnDefinitions)`
    *   `alterTable(tableName, columnChanges)`
    *   `dropTable(tableName)`

**5. Pseudocode for Schema Creation:**

```
function createTable(tableName, columnDefinitions) {
  // Parse columnDefinitions to extract column names, data types, constraints
  parsedColumns = parseColumnDefinitions(columnDefinitions);

  // Determine the appropriate storage format based on the database type and query patterns
  storageFormat = determineStorageFormat(parsedColumns);

  // Create the physical storage structure (e.g., a collection in MongoDB, a graph in Neo4j)
  createPhysicalStructure(storageFormat, tableName);

  // Update the metadata layer with the new table definition
  updateMetadata(tableName, parsedColumns, storageFormat);

  return "Table created successfully";
}
```

**6. Data Validation & Migration:**

*   Implement mechanisms for data validation during schema evolution. Ensure that existing data conforms to the new schema definitions.
*   Provide tools for automated data migration. Allow users to transform existing data to comply with the updated schema.

**7. Versioning and Rollback:**

*   Maintain a history of schema changes. Allow users to revert to previous schema versions if necessary.
*   Implement a robust rollback mechanism to ensure data consistency during schema evolution.
