## Dynamic Singulator Array for Multi-Orientation Product Handling

**Concept:** Expand the single-port singulation concept into a dynamically reconfigurable array capable of handling products arriving in varied orientations and diverting them to multiple, individually addressable output chutes.

**Specifications:**

*   **Array Configuration:** A modular array of singulation modules, each mirroring the core functionality of the original patent but with enhanced flexibility. Array size is configurable from 3x3 to 10x10 modules.
*   **Module Components:**
    *   **Conveyor System:** Each module possesses a short-loop conveyor system. Conveyor segments utilize brushless DC motors for precise speed control and acceleration/deceleration.
    *   **Side Walls & Ports:** Each module features dynamically adjustable side walls.  Walls can rotate +/- 45 degrees relative to the input/output conveyor direction. Ports within these side walls are also adjustable in height and width. Each port has an associated pneumatic actuator for selective opening/closing.
    *   **Sensors:** Each module integrates a suite of sensors:
        *   **Object Detection:** Time-of-flight sensors and/or laser scanners to detect object presence and approximate dimensions.
        *   **Orientation Sensors:** Miniature IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) detect the orientation of the package as it enters the module.
        *   **Port Occupancy Sensors:** Infrared sensors to confirm a port is clear before diverting an item.
    *   **Microcontroller:** Each module has a dedicated microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) for local control and communication.
*   **Central Control System:**
    *   **Master Controller:** A central controller (e.g., industrial PC) manages the entire array.
    *   **Software:** Custom software allows operators to define routing rules based on product characteristics (size, weight, orientation, barcode/RFID data). The software also facilitates dynamic array reconfiguration.
*   **Chute System:** Multiple individually controlled chutes are positioned downstream of the array.  Each chute is equipped with a diverting mechanism (e.g., pneumatic pusher) to direct items to their final destination.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Modules communicate with the central controller via a high-speed Ethernet network using a custom protocol.

**Pseudocode (Module Logic):**

```
//Initialization
Set conveyor speed to default
Initialize sensors

//Main Loop
While (true)
  If (ObjectDetected())
    GetObjectCharacteristics() //Size, weight, orientation, barcode/RFID
    RequestRoutingInstructions(ObjectCharacteristics) //From Central Controller
    If (RoutingInstructionsReceived())
      AdjustSideWalls(RoutingInstructions)
      OpenPort(RoutingInstructions)
      AdjustConveyorSpeed(RoutingInstructions)
      DivertObject()
      ClosePort()
      ResetConveyor()
    Else
      //Default Routing/Error Handling
      //Send Error Message to Central Controller
      //Stop Conveyor
    End If
  End If
End While
```

**Operation:**

1.  Products enter the array in potentially random orientations.
2.  Each module detects the object and determines its characteristics.
3.  The module requests routing instructions from the central controller.
4.  The central controller determines the appropriate output chute based on pre-defined rules.
5.  The module adjusts its side walls, opens the corresponding port, and diverts the object.
6.  The object falls into the assigned chute and is transported to its final destination.
