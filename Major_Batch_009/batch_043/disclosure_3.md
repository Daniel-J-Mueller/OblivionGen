## Dynamic Virtual Machine 'Ecosystem' Mapping & Self-Optimization

**Concept:** Extend the placement strategy concept to create a dynamic 'ecosystem' map of VM interactions and resource dependencies, allowing VMs to not just *be* placed, but to *request* optimal neighboring VMs for performance benefits and automatically trigger migrations to achieve those configurations.

**Specifications:**

**1. VM Dependency Declaration:**

*   Each VM image includes a metadata section detailing *required* and *preferred* neighboring VM characteristics.  
    *   Required: VM images which *must* be co-located to function. (e.g. Database server and caching layer).
    *   Preferred: VM images which, if co-located, significantly improve performance. (e.g. Multiple application tiers).
    *   Dependencies defined by resource type: CPU architecture, RAM size, network bandwidth, storage type, software stack.  Dependencies can also be *fuzzy* - e.g. “Prefer VMs running similar machine learning models”.
*   Dependency Declaration Format: JSON schema. Example:

```json
{
  "vm_name": "WebTier1",
  "dependencies": {
    "required": [
      {
        "type": "database",
        "version": "PostgreSQL 14",
        "network_latency_requirement": " < 1ms"
      }
    ],
    "preferred": [
      {
        "type": "caching",
        "version": "Redis 6",
        "resource_profile": "high-memory"
      },
      {
        "type": "analytics",
        "fuzzy_match": "similar ML model signature"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**2. Ecosystem Mapping Service:**

*   A central service maintains a real-time graph of all deployed VMs and their declared dependencies.
*   The graph is updated with VM deployments, scaling events, and migrations.
*   Uses a graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) for efficient relationship queries.

**3.  Proactive Migration Engine:**

*   Continuously monitors the ecosystem map for dependency violations and suboptimal configurations.
*   Calculates a "Dependency Satisfaction Score" for each VM, weighting required vs. preferred dependencies.
*   Triggers migration requests to the placement service when the score falls below a configurable threshold.
*   Migration algorithm considers:
    *   Resource availability
    *   Network topology
    *   Migration cost (downtime, data transfer)
    *   Priority (critical VMs prioritized)

**4.  Self-Optimization Feedback Loop:**

*   Collects performance metrics (latency, throughput, CPU utilization) *before* and *after* migrations.
*   Uses machine learning to refine the Dependency Satisfaction Score weighting and migration cost calculations.
*   Identifies patterns of successful and unsuccessful migrations to improve future placement decisions.

**5.  API Endpoints:**

*   `POST /dependencies`: Register VM dependencies.
*   `GET /ecosystem`: Retrieve the current ecosystem map. (limited access for monitoring)
*   `POST /migrate`: Trigger a migration request. (internal use only)

**Pseudocode - Proactive Migration Engine:**

```
function monitorEcosystem() {
  for each vm in ecosystem {
    dependencySatisfactionScore = calculateDependencySatisfactionScore(vm)
    if (dependencySatisfactionScore < threshold) {
      migrationRequest = createMigrationRequest(vm)
      triggerMigration(migrationRequest)
    }
  }
}

function calculateDependencySatisfactionScore(vm) {
  requiredDependenciesMet = checkRequiredDependencies(vm)
  preferredDependenciesMet = checkPreferredDependencies(vm)
  score = (requiredDependenciesMet * weight_required) + (preferredDependenciesMet * weight_preferred)
  return score
}
```
