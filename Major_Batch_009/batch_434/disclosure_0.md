## Dynamic Key Lifecycle & Packet Fragmentation

**Concept:** A system that dynamically adjusts the encryption key lifecycle *based on observed network conditions* and proactively fragments packets to optimize for those conditions, minimizing the impact of potential key compromise and improving overall throughput. This moves beyond static lifespan estimations to a responsive system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Network Condition Monitoring Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network telemetry (packet loss, latency, jitter, bandwidth utilization, interference metrics - derived from wireless signals where applicable).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Applies a weighted scoring system to the telemetry data. Higher weights are assigned to metrics indicating increased risk (e.g., high packet loss = high risk).
    *   Calculates a 'Network Risk Score' (NRS).
    *   Applies hysteresis to the NRS to prevent rapid key rotation fluctuations.
*   **Output:** NRS â€“ A continuous value representing the current network health/risk.

**2. Dynamic Key Rotation Module:**

*   **Input:** NRS, Current Key Lifespan Remaining, Encryption Algorithm Overhead.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Uses a configurable mapping function to translate the NRS into a Key Rotation Adjustment Factor (KRAF).
        *   Low NRS: KRAF = 1 (no adjustment)
        *   Moderate NRS: 0.5 < KRAF < 1 (prolong lifespan)
        *   High NRS: KRAF < 0.5 (shorten lifespan).
    *   Calculates the Adjusted Key Lifespan = Current Key Lifespan Remaining * KRAF.
    *   Triggers key rotation when the Adjusted Key Lifespan reaches zero.
*   **Output:** Signal to initiate key rotation.

**3. Adaptive Packet Fragmentation Module:**

*   **Input:** NRS, Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), Packet Size, Encryption Overhead, Current Key Lifespan Remaining.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Fragmentation Threshold Calculation:**  Based on NRS and Key Lifespan Remaining, determine the optimal packet size for fragmentation.
        *   Low NRS/Long Key Lifespan: No fragmentation (use full MTU).
        *   High NRS/Short Key Lifespan:  Aggressive fragmentation (reduce packet size significantly).  The goal is to minimize the data volume exposed if a key is compromised during transmission.
    *   **Fragmentation Logic:** Fragment packets *before* encryption.  Include a sequence number in each fragment to ensure reassembly order.
*   **Output:** Fragmented packets ready for encryption.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Packet Fragmentation):**

```
function fragmentPacket(packet, NRS, KeyLifespan, MTU):
  if NRS > HIGH_THRESHOLD and KeyLifespan < SHORT_THRESHOLD:
    fragmentSize = MIN_FRAGMENT_SIZE // e.g., 500 bytes
  elif NRS > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    fragmentSize = MTU / 2
  else:
    fragmentSize = MTU

  fragments = splitPacketIntoFragments(packet, fragmentSize)

  for i in range(length(fragments)):
    fragment = fragments[i]
    addSequenceNumber(fragment, i)

  return fragments
```

**4. Secure Fragment Reassembly Module (Destination):**

*   **Input:** Fragmented packets, Sequence Numbers.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Reassembles fragments based on sequence numbers.
    *   Validates sequence order to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Performs decryption *after* reassembly.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Overhead:** Fragmentation/reassembly adds overhead.  The system must dynamically balance security gains against performance losses.
*   **Complexity:**  The system adds complexity to both the sender and receiver.
*   **Synchronization:**  Key rotation and fragmentation must be synchronized to ensure seamless operation.
*   **Algorithm:** Consider using authenticated encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-GCM) to provide both confidentiality and integrity.
