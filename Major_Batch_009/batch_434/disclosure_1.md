## Modular Kinetic Energy Harvesting & Distribution System – Vehicle Integration

**Concept:** Integrate piezoelectric materials *within* the flexible seal of the thermally conductive vibration isolating connector, and expand the concept beyond thermal regulation to become a distributed energy harvesting system for powering auxiliary vehicle functions.

**Specs:**

*   **Piezoelectric Material:** Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) composite embedded within silicone or polyurethane flexible seal. Target density: 20-30% piezoelectric material by volume within the seal.
*   **Seal Geometry:** The flexible seal isn't a simple O-ring or flat gasket. It will be constructed as a series of interconnected, micro-cantilevered piezoelectric elements. Each element is individually encapsulated for environmental protection.
*   **Electrical Interface:** Each piezoelectric element is connected to a micro-rectifier circuit (Schottky diode based) and a DC-DC boost converter. Boost converter output: 3.3V/5V selectable.
*   **Energy Storage:** Supercapacitor array (stacked) integrated *within* the heat exhaust element housing. Capacity: 100mF – 1F. Voltage: 5V.
*   **Distribution Network:** Low-voltage power bus running along the vehicle frame, accessible via standardized micro-connectors.
*   **Control System:** Microcontroller monitoring supercapacitor voltage and distributing power to auxiliary systems (sensors, LEDs, wireless communication modules). Prioritization algorithm to ensure critical systems remain powered during peak loads.
*   **Mechanical Integration:** The heat exhaust element mounting system will incorporate vibration dampening materials to maximize piezoelectric element activation.
*   **System Architecture:**

    ```pseudocode
    // Main Loop
    while (true) {
        // Read Voltage from Supercapacitor
        supercapVoltage = readSupercapVoltage();

        // If Voltage is above threshold
        if (supercapVoltage > 3.5V) {
            // Distribute Power to Auxiliary Systems
            distributePower();
        } else {
            // Conserve Power – Deactivate non-critical systems
            deactivateAuxiliarySystems();
        }

        // Monitor Vibration – Adjust Power Distribution Algorithm based on vibration frequency/amplitude
        monitorVibration();

        delay(10ms);
    }

    //Distribute Power Function
    function distributePower() {
        //Check for Active Requests
        activeRequests = getActiveRequests();

        //Prioritize Requests based on Importance
        prioritizedRequests = prioritizeRequests(activeRequests);

        //Iterate through Requests & Fulfill
        for (request in prioritizedRequests) {
            if (supercapVoltage > request.voltageRequirement) {
                fulfillRequest(request);
                supercapVoltage -= request.currentDraw * deltaTime;
            } else {
                //Request Denied – Log Event
                logEvent("Request Denied: Insufficient Power");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Material Considerations:** Corrosion-resistant coatings on all electrical components. High-temperature silicone/polyurethane for seal construction. Graphite or graphene additives to improve thermal conductivity of the seal.
*   **Scalability:** The system is designed to be modular. Multiple heat-generating electronic devices can be connected to the same power bus, effectively creating a distributed energy harvesting network.
