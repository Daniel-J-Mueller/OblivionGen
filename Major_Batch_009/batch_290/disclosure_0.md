## Adaptive Probe Injection based on Network Congestion

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust probe injection rates and TTL values based on real-time network congestion data, improving the accuracy and efficiency of forwarding table testing. Current methods appear static – fixed TTL & injection rates. A responsive system would allow for more comprehensive and relevant testing.

**Specifications:**

**1. Congestion Monitoring Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Utilize existing network monitoring tools (sFlow, NetFlow, SNMP) or implement a lightweight packet sampling mechanism on network devices.
*   **Metrics:** Collect key congestion metrics:
    *   Average queue depth per interface.
    *   Packet loss rate per interface.
    *   Link utilization.
    *   Round Trip Time (RTT) between source and destination.
*   **Aggregation & Analysis:**  Aggregate collected metrics and calculate a “Congestion Score” for each link and device. A simple weighted average can be used, favoring high packet loss or high queue depth.

**2. Adaptive Probe Control Module:**

*   **Input:** Congestion Score (from Congestion Monitoring Module).
*   **Logic:**
    *   **High Congestion (Score > Threshold_High):**
        *   Reduce probe injection rate. Fewer probes mean less additional load.
        *   Increase TTL value.  Allows probes to propagate further before expiring, potentially reaching more distant devices.
    *   **Medium Congestion (Threshold_Low < Score < Threshold_High):**
        *   Maintain current probe injection rate and TTL.
    *   **Low Congestion (Score < Threshold_Low):**
        *   Increase probe injection rate. More frequent testing provides faster feedback.
        *   Decrease TTL value.  Focuses testing on immediate neighbors.
*   **Output:** Adjusted probe injection rate and TTL value.

**3. Probe Generation & Injection:**

*   Modify the existing probe generation module to accept the adjusted injection rate and TTL value as parameters.
*   Implement a pacing mechanism to control the probe injection rate accurately.

**4. Data Correlation & Analysis:**

*   Collect probe results (success/failure, TTL expiration events) along with the corresponding congestion metrics.
*   Analyze the data to identify correlations between network congestion and forwarding table errors. This data can be used to refine the adaptive probe control logic and improve testing accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Probe Control Module):**

```
function adjust_probe_parameters(congestion_score):
  if congestion_score > THRESHOLD_HIGH:
    probe_rate = base_probe_rate * 0.5  // Reduce rate by 50%
    probe_ttl = base_probe_ttl * 1.5     // Increase TTL by 50%
  elif congestion_score > THRESHOLD_LOW:
    probe_rate = base_probe_rate
    probe_ttl = base_probe_ttl
  else:
    probe_rate = base_probe_rate * 2  // Double the rate
    probe_ttl = base_probe_ttl * 0.75   // Decrease TTL by 25%

  return probe_rate, probe_ttl
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   The Congestion Monitoring Module can be implemented in hardware for faster data collection and analysis, potentially using dedicated ASICs or FPGAs.
*   The Adaptive Probe Control Module can be implemented in software running on the CPU of the network device, or offloaded to a dedicated hardware accelerator.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved accuracy of forwarding table testing.
*   Reduced network load during testing.
*   Faster identification of forwarding table errors.
*   Enhanced network resilience and stability.
*   More realistic testing conditions by accounting for dynamic network congestion.
