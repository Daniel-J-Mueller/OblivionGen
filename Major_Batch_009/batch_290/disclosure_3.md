## Snapshot Data Provenance & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend snapshot manifests to incorporate detailed data provenance information and a trust scoring system. This allows for more granular access control, detection of compromised data within snapshots, and facilitates data lineage tracking.

**Specs:**

*   **Extended Snapshot Manifest:** Modify the existing snapshot manifest to include:
    *   `DataBlockCreatorAccountID`: (Existing) Identifier of the account that originally created the data block.
    *   `DataBlockCreationTimestamp`: Timestamp of when the data block was initially created.
    *   `DataBlockLastModifiedTimestamp`: Timestamp of the last modification to the data block.
    *   `DataBlockIntegrityHash`: Cryptographic hash of the data block (e.g., SHA-256).
    *   `DataBlockOriginatingService`: Identifier of the service/application that created/modified the data block (e.g., database, web server).
    *   `DataBlockLocationMetadata`: Geographic location where the data block was originally created or modified. (Optional, configurable)
*   **Trust Scoring Engine:**
    *   A component that calculates a trust score for each data block within a snapshot based on:
        *   Creator Account Reputation:  An internal/external reputation score for the creating account.
        *   Data Block Age:  Older data blocks may have lower trust scores.
        *   Integrity Verification:  Compare the `DataBlockIntegrityHash` with a trusted source or historical record.
        *   Originating Service Trust: Assign trust levels to different services based on security posture.
        *   Location Risk:  Flag data blocks originating from high-risk geographic locations.
*   **Access Control Policy Integration:**
    *   Extend the existing access control system to allow policies based on:
        *   Data Block Trust Score:  Only allow access to snapshots with a minimum overall trust score.
        *   Data Block Creator:  Restrict access to data blocks created by specific accounts.
        *   Data Block Originating Service:  Restrict access based on the service that created the data.
*   **Data Lineage Visualization Tool:**
    *   A web-based tool that allows users to:
        *   Visualize the lineage of data blocks within a snapshot.
        *   Trace data blocks back to their original source.
        *   Identify potential data integrity issues.

**Pseudocode (Access Control Decision):**

```
function decideAccess(clientAccount, snapshotManifest) {
  overallTrustScore = 0
  for each dataBlock in snapshotManifest {
    trustScore = calculateDataBlockTrustScore(dataBlock)
    overallTrustScore += trustScore
  }

  averageTrustScore = overallTrustScore / count(snapshotManifest)

  if (averageTrustScore >= MINIMUM_TRUST_THRESHOLD) {
    return ACCESS_GRANTED
  }

  //Additional checks:

  for each dataBlock in snapshotManifest{
    if(dataBlock.DataBlockCreatorAccountID != clientAccount){
        return ACCESS_DENIED
    }
  }

  return ACCESS_GRANTED
}

function calculateDataBlockTrustScore(dataBlock){
    score = 0
    score += dataBlock.CreatorAccountReputation * WEIGHT_CREATOR_REPUTATION
    score += (1 - (currentTime - dataBlock.DataBlockLastModifiedTimestamp)/MAX_DATA_AGE) * WEIGHT_DATA_AGE
    if (verifyIntegrityHash(dataBlock.DataBlockIntegrityHash)){
        score += WEIGHT_INTEGRITY
    }
    return score
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced data security and compliance.
*   Improved data quality and reliability.
*   Streamlined data governance and lineage tracking.
*   Detection of compromised data within snapshots.
