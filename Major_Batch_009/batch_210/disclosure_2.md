## Dynamic Peripheral Power Islands

**Concept:** Extend the quiescent doze/wait mode paradigm by creating dynamically configurable “power islands” around peripherals. Instead of simply gating clocks or putting memory into self-refresh, treat each peripheral (or groups of tightly coupled peripherals) as an independent power domain, with its own dedicated power supply controlled by the kernel.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each peripheral cluster connected to a dedicated, digitally controlled power switch (MOSFET or similar).
    *   Each power switch controlled by a dedicated GPIO pin accessible by the kernel.
    *   Integrated current sensors on each power island to monitor power draw.
    *   Dedicated low-dropout (LDO) regulators providing stable voltage to each island (optional, for noise-sensitive peripherals).
*   **Software (Kernel Module):**
    *   **Peripheral Power Manager (PPM):** A kernel module responsible for managing power islands.
    *   **Device Driver Interface:**  Drivers expose a “power budget” parameter reflecting the peripheral’s estimated energy needs.  Also expose “activity profile” – predictable usage patterns (e.g., camera used only during short bursts, Bluetooth constantly scanning).
    *   **Dynamic Power Allocation Algorithm:**
        1.  Kernel tracks processor idle state and device driver reported activity.
        2.  PPM polls drivers for current “power budget” and "activity profile."
        3.  During idle periods, PPM intelligently powers down islands where no immediate activity is predicted.
        4.  Algorithm considers the time required to power up/down each island vs. estimated energy savings.
        5.  The PPM incorporates “graceful shutdown” sequences for peripherals needing time to save state (e.g., disabling radios, flushing buffers).
        6.  Current sensors provide real-time feedback to the algorithm, allowing for dynamic adjustment of power allocation.
        7.  The algorithm can prioritize peripherals based on user-defined criteria (e.g., always keep Bluetooth active for emergency calls).
*   **Pseudocode (PPM Core Loop):**

```pseudocode
// Global Variables
island_states = {}  // Dictionary: {island_id: {state: 'on'/'off', power_draw: float}}
driver_info = {}  // Dictionary: {device_id: {power_budget: float, activity_profile: list}}

function update_island_states():
    for island_id in island_states:
        island_states[island_id]['power_draw'] = read_current_sensor(island_id)

function get_driver_info():
    for device_id in registered_devices:
        driver_info[device_id] = driver.get_power_info() // Poll each driver

function allocate_power():
    get_driver_info()
    update_island_states()

    // Iterate through islands
    for island_id in island_states:
        // Find associated device
        device = find_device_for_island(island_id)

        // If device predicts no activity AND island is on
        if device.activity == 'inactive' and island_states[island_id]['state'] == 'on':
            // Check if powering down is worthwhile (power savings > power-up cost)
            if is_power_down_worthwhile(island_id):
                // Power down island
                power_down_island(island_id)
                island_states[island_id]['state'] = 'off'
        # If device predicts activity AND island is off
        elif device.activity == 'active' and island_states[island_id]['state'] == 'off':
            // Power up island
            power_up_island(island_id)
            island_states[island_id]['state'] = 'on'

// Main Loop
while(true):
    allocate_power()
    sleep(10ms)
```

*   **Additional Features:**
    *   **Predictive Power Management:** Integrate machine learning models to predict peripheral usage based on user behavior, time of day, location, and other factors.
    *   **Energy Harvesting Integration:**  If the device includes energy harvesting capabilities (solar, kinetic, etc.), dynamically allocate power to islands based on available energy.
    *   **User-Configurable Power Profiles:**  Allow users to define custom power profiles that prioritize certain peripherals or applications.
