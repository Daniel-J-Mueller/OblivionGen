## Dynamic Codeword Graphing for Adaptive Decompression

**Concept:** Instead of fixed literal/length/offset trees or relying solely on overlapping bit windows, build a dynamic, probabilistic graph representing potential codeword matches *during* decompression. This allows for adaptive compression/decompression based on real-time data characteristics.

**Specs:**

**1. Graph Construction Module:**

*   **Node Representation:** Each node in the graph represents a potential codeword (literal, length, or offset).  Nodes store:
    *   Codeword value (bit sequence).
    *   Probability score (initially uniform, updated during decompression).
    *   Pointer to parent node (for backtracking/tree structure).
    *   Pointer to next possible node (for parallel exploration).
*   **Edge Representation:** Edges represent transitions between potential codewords.  Edges store:
    *   Transition cost (based on bit differences between codewords).
    *   Probability boost (if the transition is statistically likely).
*   **Initial Graph:** A small, pre-built graph containing common literal values and basic length/offset codes.
*   **Dynamic Expansion:** As the compressed data is processed, new nodes and edges are added to the graph based on observed bit patterns.  This uses a rolling window of recent bits.

**2. Parallel Codeword Matching Engine:**

*   **Bit Window Array:** Utilize an array of overlapping bit windows, similar to the patent, but instead of direct comparison to trees, each window initiates a search through the dynamic graph.
*   **Graph Traversal:** For each bit window, start at the root node of the graph.
    *   Explore multiple paths simultaneously (parallelism is key).
    *   Calculate a score for each path based on:
        *   Bitwise similarity to the window.
        *   Node probability.
        *   Edge transition cost.
*   **Probabilistic Pruning:** Regularly prune paths with low scores to reduce computational load.

**3. Codeword Selection & Decoding Module:**

*   **Best Path Selection:** For each bit window, select the path with the highest score.
*   **Adaptive Probability Update:**  
    *   If a path leads to a valid codeword:
        *   Increase the probability of the nodes and edges along that path.
        *   Decrease the probability of nodes and edges on pruned paths.
    *   Implement a decay factor to prevent probabilities from becoming overly biased towards early data.
*   **Output Decoding:** Decode the selected codewords to generate decompressed data.

**4. Hardware Implementation Considerations:**

*   **FPGA/ASIC:**  Ideal for parallel processing and custom data structures.
*   **Distributed Memory:** Utilize distributed memory to store the graph nodes and edges for fast access.
*   **Custom Data Structures:** Implement optimized data structures for representing the graph and managing probabilities.
*   **Bitwise Operations:** Leverage bitwise operations for fast bit comparisons and calculations.



**Pseudocode (Core Traversal):**

```
function traverse_graph(bit_window, graph_root):
  paths = [graph_root]  // Initialize with root node

  while paths is not empty:
    current_path = paths.pop(0)
    current_node = current_path.last_node

    // Expand current path with possible next nodes
    for next_node in current_node.next_nodes:
      // Calculate path score based on bit similarity, node probability, and transition cost
      score = calculate_score(bit_window, next_node, current_node)

      // Add new path to list (if score is high enough)
      if score > threshold:
        new_path = current_path.copy()
        new_path.add_node(next_node)
        paths.append(new_path)

  // Return the best path (highest score)
  return find_best_path(paths)
```

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond static trees and fixed windows. The dynamic graph adapts to the characteristics of the data, potentially leading to better compression ratios and faster decompression speeds, particularly for data with complex patterns.  The probabilistic pruning and adaptive learning components enable the system to optimize itself over time.
