## Dynamic Embedding Dimensionality via Learned Attention

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on fixed-dimension embeddings. This design proposes a system where the dimensionality of the embedding *dynamically adapts* based on the input image's complexity, learned through an attention mechanism.  Higher complexity images receive higher-dimensional embeddings, capturing finer-grained details, while simpler images utilize lower dimensions for efficiency.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Embedding Network Architecture:**  Base the embedding layer on a convolutional neural network (CNN). This CNN’s output will *not* be flattened into a fixed-size vector immediately. Instead, retain spatial dimensions (e.g., a 7x7 feature map with 128 channels).

2.  **Attention Module:** Implement an attention module *after* the CNN embedding layer. This module will take the 7x7x128 feature map as input.

    *   **Attention Weights:** The attention module learns a set of attention weights, one for each spatial location (49 weights in the 7x7 example). These weights determine the relative importance of each spatial feature.

    *   **Weight Calculation:** The weights are calculated using a small fully connected network (FCN) taking the feature vector at each spatial location as input.  The output of the FCN is passed through a sigmoid function to produce a value between 0 and 1.

    *   **Spatial Pooling:** Perform weighted spatial pooling using the attention weights. This creates a single feature vector representing the entire image.  The pooled vector’s dimensionality is equal to the number of channels in the feature map (128 in the example).

3.  **Dimensionality Control Layer:**  Introduce a "Dimensionality Control Layer" after the spatial pooling. This layer predicts a scalar value, 'd', representing the desired embedding dimensionality.

    *   **Prediction Network:**  ‘d’ is predicted by a small FCN taking the pooled feature vector as input. Constrain 'd' to be within a predefined range (e.g., 32 to 512) using a clamping function.

    *   **Projection Matrix:**  A learned projection matrix (W) maps the pooled feature vector to the dynamically determined dimensionality ‘d’.  The matrix W will have dimensions (pooled_vector_size, d).

4.  **Training:**
    *   **Loss Function:** Augment the existing loss function with a regularization term that penalizes large values of ‘d’ (encouraging lower dimensionality when possible).
    *   **Data Augmentation:** Include augmentations that intentionally vary image complexity to force the network to learn appropriate dimensionality adaptation.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Input: Image (img)
# Output: Embedding Vector (embedding)

# 1. CNN Embedding
feature_map = CNN_Embedding(img)  # Output: 7x7x128

# 2. Attention Module
attention_weights = Attention_Module(feature_map) # Output: 7x7
weighted_map = feature_map * attention_weights # Element-wise multiplication

# 3. Dimensionality Control
pooled_vector = AveragePooling2D(weighted_map) # Output: 1x1x128
dimensionality = Dimensionality_Control_Layer(pooled_vector)
projection_matrix = Learnable_Projection_Matrix(dimensionality)
embedding = matrix_multiply(projection_matrix, pooled_vector)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Efficiency:**  Lower dimensionality for simple images reduces computational cost.
*   **Enhanced Accuracy:**  Higher dimensionality for complex images allows for finer-grained representation.
*   **Adaptability:**  The system can learn to adapt to varying image complexities.
