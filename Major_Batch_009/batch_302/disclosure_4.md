## Dynamic Resolution & Detail Streaming Based on Predictive Gaze & Semantic Segmentation

**Concept:** Expand upon the frame quality assessment by integrating real-time eye-tracking data *and* semantic scene understanding to dynamically adjust resolution *and* detail levels not just per-frame, but *within* each frame. This goes beyond simply transmitting the first frame if quality is high; it proactively predicts where the user is looking and prioritizes detail there, while drastically reducing detail in peripheral or semantically unimportant areas.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Integrated eye-tracking system (IR sensors, cameras). Minimum sample rate: 60Hz.
*   High-fidelity depth sensor (ToF or structured light) for initial scene reconstruction & ongoing geometric updates.
*   Dedicated GPU with hardware acceleration for semantic segmentation & real-time rendering.
*   High-bandwidth, low-latency communication link (e.g., Wi-Fi 6E, 5G) for streaming data.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Gaze Prediction Module:**  Utilizes a Kalman filter or LSTM network trained on user gaze data to predict the user’s point of focus 100-200ms into the future.  This prediction is used to create a 'focus region' within the frame.
*   **Semantic Segmentation Engine:**  A deep learning model (e.g., Mask R-CNN, DeepLab) operating on the rendered frame to identify objects and assign semantic labels (e.g., 'sky', 'building', 'tree', 'person', 'road').
*   **Detail Level Assignment:**  This module combines gaze prediction and semantic segmentation.
    *   **Focus Region:** Within the predicted gaze region, maintain maximum detail (highest resolution textures, full polygon count, advanced shaders).
    *   **Semantic Prioritization:** Assign detail levels based on semantic labels:
        *   **High Priority:**  Objects directly related to gameplay (e.g., player character, enemies, interactive elements) maintain high detail regardless of gaze.
        *   **Medium Priority:** Objects within the peripheral vision but relevant to the scene (e.g., buildings, trees) receive reduced detail.
        *   **Low Priority:**  Semantically unimportant objects (e.g., distant sky, ground far from the player) receive drastically reduced detail (e.g., simplified geometry, low-resolution textures, or even procedural generation).
*   **Adaptive Streaming Protocol:** A custom protocol designed to stream only the *changes* in detail level between frames, rather than full frame updates. This protocol will leverage a tile-based rendering system.
*   **Error Correction/Loss Concealment:** Robust error correction and loss concealment mechanisms to mitigate the effects of network jitter or packet loss.

**III. Pseudocode - Detail Level Assignment**

```
function assignDetailLevels(frame, gazePrediction, semanticSegmentation) {
  // 1. Create a Detail Map - Initialize all tiles to 'Low'
  detailMap = createDetailMap(frame);

  // 2. Prioritize Gaze Region
  gazeRegion = createRegionFromGazePrediction(gazePrediction);
  setDetailLevel(detailMap, gazeRegion, 'High');

  // 3. Prioritize Gameplay Elements
  gameplayObjects = findGameplayObjects(semanticSegmentation);
  for (object in gameplayObjects) {
    setDetailLevel(detailMap, getObjectBoundingBox(object), 'High');
  }

  // 4. Assign Detail Based on Semantic Labels
  for (tile in detailMap) {
    semanticLabel = getSemanticLabel(tile);
    if (semanticLabel == 'sky' || semanticLabel == 'distant_ground') {
      setDetailLevel(detailMap, tile, 'Lowest');
    } else if (semanticLabel == 'building' || semanticLabel == 'tree') {
      setDetailLevel(detailMap, tile, 'Medium');
    } else {
      setDetailLevel(detailMap, tile, 'Low');
    }
  }

  return detailMap;
}
```

**IV. Streaming Protocol Details:**

*   **Tile-Based Rendering:** Divide the frame into a grid of tiles (e.g., 64x64 pixels).
*   **Delta Encoding:**  Instead of sending the entire tile each frame, send only the changes (delta) in the tile’s data. This includes changes in texture resolution, polygon count, shader parameters, and other visual properties.
*   **Priority-Based Streaming:**  Prioritize the streaming of tiles containing the focus region and high-priority gameplay elements.
*   **Loss Resilience:** Implement forward error correction (FEC) to protect against packet loss.

**V. Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant bandwidth reduction.
*   Improved perceived visual quality due to prioritized detail.
*   Reduced latency due to smaller data transfers.
*   Scalability to a wider range of network conditions.
*   Potential for more immersive and engaging gaming experiences.
