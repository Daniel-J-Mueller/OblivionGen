## Micro-Vapor Chamber Array for Localized Thermal Runaway Mitigation

**Concept:** Integrate an array of micro-vapor chambers directly into the battery cell structure – specifically, embedded within the electrolyte or as part of the separator layer. These chambers wouldn't be for overall cooling, but for *extremely* localized heat extraction at the onset of thermal runaway within a single cell.

**Specifications:**

*   **Chamber Dimensions:** Each micro-vapor chamber will be approximately 2mm x 2mm x 0.5mm.  Density: 1 chamber per 500mm<sup>2</sup> of battery surface area.
*   **Working Fluid:**  A low-boiling-point, non-flammable fluid (e.g., a fluorocarbon) encapsulated within a sealed micro-chamber.  Vapor pressure curve optimized for rapid phase change at 80-120°C.
*   **Chamber Material:**  Thin-walled copper or aluminum alloy for efficient heat transfer.  Coated with a polymer barrier to prevent electrolyte interaction.
*   **Integration Method:**
    *   **Option 1 (Electrolyte Embedding):** Micro-chambers encapsulated in a protective polymer shell and dispersed evenly throughout the electrolyte during cell manufacturing.
    *   **Option 2 (Separator Layer):** Micro-chambers integrated *into* the separator material during separator fabrication. This could be achieved through micro-molding or direct deposition.
*   **Venting System:** Each micro-chamber connected to a micro-vent channel network leading to a dedicated venting port on the battery pack exterior. The venting port includes a flame arrestor and a condensing chamber to capture vented fluid.
*   **Detection System:** Integrate micro-thermocouples *inside* select micro-chambers to detect temperature spikes *before* they propagate.  This provides an early warning signal for preventative measures.
*   **Heat Spreading Layer:** A thin graphite or carbon fiber sheet placed *above* the micro-chamber array to further distribute heat and prevent localized hotspots.
*   **Control System:** A battery management system (BMS) that monitors the micro-thermocouple data. If a temperature threshold is exceeded, the BMS can activate localized cooling (if available) or initiate emergency shutdown procedures.

**Pseudocode (BMS Logic):**

```
FOR EACH micro_thermocouple IN thermocouple_array:
    IF micro_thermocouple.temperature > threshold_temperature:
        log_event("Thermal runaway detected in cell: " + cell_id)
        IF localized_cooling_available:
            activate_localized_cooling(cell_id)
        ELSE:
            initiate_emergency_shutdown()
            vent_cell(cell_id)
        BREAK
```

**Innovation Notes:**

The existing thermal shields focus on spreading heat *after* a thermal event begins. This approach aims to *interrupt* the cascading failure by actively extracting heat at the source *before* runaway can fully develop.  Integrating the chambers directly into the cell structure maximizes heat transfer efficiency. This is not just about preventing fire; it's about preserving battery capacity and extending lifespan by minimizing thermal degradation.
