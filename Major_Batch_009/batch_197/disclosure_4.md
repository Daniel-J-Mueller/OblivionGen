## Adaptive Request Shaping with Predictive Congestion Avoidance

**Specification:** A system augmenting the existing traffic metric collection with proactive request shaping based on predicted congestion. The core innovation lies in shifting from reactive monitoring to *predictive* adjustment of request flow.

**Components:**

1.  **Congestion Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Time-series data from the existing traffic metric collection system (call volume, latency, error rates).
    *   Process: Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical traffic data. The LSTM predicts future congestion levels (latency spikes, error rate increases) for each service within the architecture.  A confidence interval is generated alongside each prediction.
    *   Output: Predicted congestion level (scale 0-100, 100 being maximum congestion) with associated confidence interval for each service, updated every 5 seconds.

2.  **Request Shaping Engine:**
    *   Input:  Predicted congestion levels & confidence intervals from the Congestion Prediction Module, incoming request metadata (priority level, estimated resource consumption), and a configurable 'risk tolerance' parameter (0-1, higher value means more aggressive shaping).
    *   Process:
        *   **Priority Queuing:**  Requests are categorized by priority (critical, high, medium, low).
        *   **Dynamic Throttling:** Based on predicted congestion and risk tolerance, the engine dynamically adjusts the rate at which requests are forwarded to services.
            *   If predicted congestion is *low* (below threshold T1) and confidence is high:  Requests are forwarded at normal rate.
            *   If predicted congestion is *medium* (between T1 and T2) and confidence is medium-high:  Lower-priority requests (medium/low) are delayed or dropped (configurable), while high/critical priority requests are prioritized.
            *   If predicted congestion is *high* (above T2) and confidence is high:  All but critical priority requests are delayed or dropped.  Critical requests may also be rate-limited to prevent cascading failure.
        *   **Request Splitting:** For large requests, the engine can split them into smaller chunks, distributing the load across multiple instances of the service.
    *   Output: Modified request stream with adjusted rate, priority, and size.

3.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   The actual latency and error rates observed *after* the request shaping are fed back into the Congestion Prediction Module, improving its accuracy over time.  This is implemented using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning).

**Pseudocode (Request Shaping Engine):**

```
function shapeRequest(request, congestionData):
  priority = request.priority
  congestionLevel = congestionData.level
  confidence = congestionData.confidence
  riskTolerance = getConfig().riskTolerance

  if congestionLevel > 80 and confidence > 0.7:  // High congestion, high confidence
    if priority == "low":
      dropRequest(request)
      return
    elif priority == "medium":
      delayRequest(request, 500ms) // delay for 500ms
  elif congestionLevel > 60 and confidence > 0.5:
    if priority == "medium":
      delayRequest(request, 200ms)

  if request.size > 1MB:
      splitRequest(request, numChunks=4)

  forwardRequest(request)
```

**Data Model Extensions:**

*   **Request Metadata:** Add fields for: `priority` (critical, high, medium, low), `estimatedResourceConsumption`.
*   **Congestion Data:**  `serviceName`, `predictedCongestionLevel` (0-100), `confidence` (0-1).
