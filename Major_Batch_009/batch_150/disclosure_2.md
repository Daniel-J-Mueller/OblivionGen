## Dynamic Test Suite Synthesis via Generative AI

**Core Concept:** Automatically generate new, targeted tests based on code changes, going beyond coverage maps to proactively identify potential failure modes. This moves beyond *selecting* existing tests to *creating* new ones, augmenting the existing test suite.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Change Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Unique Change List Number (CLN) & associated code diff.
    *   Process: Utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on the codebase’s semantics and testing patterns. The LLM analyzes the diff to identify:
        *   Modified functionality.
        *   Potential side effects of the changes.
        *   Edge cases introduced or exacerbated by the changes.
        *   Dependencies impacted by the changes.

2.  **Test Case Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Analysis from Change Analysis Module.
    *   Process: The LLM generates test case *skeletons* – high-level descriptions of test scenarios in a domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL focuses on defining inputs, expected outputs, and pre/post conditions.  Example DSL snippet:
        ```dsl
        test_scenario: "Verify user authentication with invalid credentials"
        input: { username: "testuser", password: "wrongpassword" }
        expected_output: { status: "error", message: "Invalid username or password" }
        pre_condition: "User account exists"
        post_condition: "No changes to user account status"
        ```
        The DSL is designed to be easily parseable and executable by a test framework.

3.  **Test Implementation & Execution Module:**
    *   Input: Test Case Skeletons from Test Case Generation Module.
    *   Process: A code generation engine translates the DSL skeletons into executable test code (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript) using pre-defined templates and utility functions.
    *   The generated tests are automatically added to the existing test suite.
    *   The test suite is executed, and results are reported.

4.  **Feedback Loop & Model Refinement:**
    *   Test execution results (pass/fail) are fed back into the LLM to refine its test case generation capabilities. This can be achieved through reinforcement learning or supervised learning techniques.
    *   The LLM learns to prioritize test cases that are most likely to uncover bugs based on past failures.

**Technical Details:**

*   **LLM:** Utilize a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-3, CodeGen) and fine-tune it on the codebase.
*   **DSL:** Design a concise and expressive DSL that captures the essential aspects of test scenarios.
*   **Code Generation Engine:** Implement a flexible code generation engine that supports multiple programming languages.
*   **Test Framework Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with existing test frameworks (e.g., JUnit, pytest, Jest).
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle large codebases and frequent changes.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```pseudocode
function generate_tests_from_change(change_list_number):
  diff = get_code_diff(change_list_number)
  analysis = analyze_diff_with_llm(diff)
  test_skeletons = generate_test_skeletons_from_analysis(analysis)
  test_code = generate_executable_test_code(test_skeletons)
  add_tests_to_suite(test_code)
  execute_tests()
  feedback = collect_test_results()
  refine_llm(feedback)
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply selecting existing tests based on coverage. It dynamically *creates* new tests tailored to the specific changes, increasing the probability of catching subtle bugs and improving code quality. The feedback loop further enhances the system’s ability to generate effective tests over time.
