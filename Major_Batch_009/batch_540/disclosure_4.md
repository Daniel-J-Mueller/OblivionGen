## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Predictive Beamforming

**Concept:** This system expands on the multi-device speech processing by introducing dynamically adjustable ‘acoustic zones’ within a physical space, coupled with predictive beamforming tailored to user movement and anticipated speech direction. It moves beyond simply offloading processing; it *shapes* the acoustic environment for optimal capture.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of spatially distributed microphone/speaker units. Minimum of 6, optimally 12+ for larger spaces. Each unit contains:
        *   Far-field microphone array (4-8 mics).
        *   High-frequency speaker (for acoustic shaping/masking - ultrasonic preferred).
        *   Edge processing unit (for pre-processing & zone communication).
    *   Central Processing Unit (CPU) with significant parallel processing capability.
    *   Optional: Depth sensors (LiDAR, time-of-flight) for 3D space mapping and user tracking.
*   **Software – Core Modules:**
    *   **Space Mapping & Zone Definition:** Algorithm to create a dynamic 3D map of the environment using depth sensors (if present) or acoustic triangulation.  Divides the space into adjustable ‘acoustic zones’ – regions prioritized for speech capture.  Zone sizes and boundaries are determined by occupancy and anticipated usage.
    *   **User Tracking & Prediction:**  Algorithm to track user position within the space (using visual or acoustic cues).  Predicts user movement trajectory based on velocity and historical data.
    *   **Predictive Beamforming:** Utilizes user tracking and predicted trajectory to dynamically adjust beamforming parameters *before* speech is uttered.  Pre-steers the microphone arrays toward the anticipated source.
    *   **Acoustic Shaping:** Employs the speakers to actively shape the acoustic environment.  This could involve:
        *   Creating ‘quiet zones’ by emitting anti-noise to cancel reflections.
        *   Directing sound reflections away from sensitive areas.
        *   Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by focusing sound energy.
    *   **Distributed Processing & Synchronization:** Each microphone/speaker unit performs pre-processing (noise reduction, echo cancellation) locally.  Data is synchronized and fused at the central processing unit.
    *   **Machine Learning Integration:**
        *   User Voice Profiling:  Adapts to individual voice characteristics and accent.
        *   Environment Modeling:  Learns the acoustic properties of the space to optimize shaping parameters.
        *   Anomaly Detection:  Identifies unusual sounds (e.g., breaking glass) that may require attention.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    1.  Update 3D Space Map (using depth sensors or acoustic triangulation).
    2.  Track User Position & Predict Trajectory.
    3.  Adjust Acoustic Zone Boundaries based on occupancy & prediction.
    4.  Calculate optimal Beamforming Parameters for each microphone array.
    5.  Calculate Acoustic Shaping Parameters (anti-noise levels, reflection direction).
    6.  Apply Beamforming & Acoustic Shaping.
    7.  Capture Audio Data.
    8.  Perform Noise Reduction & Echo Cancellation.
    9.  Send Processed Audio to Speech Recognition Engine.
    10. Repeat from step 1.
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple multi-device processing by *actively shaping* the acoustic environment itself.  Traditional beamforming is reactive; this system is *proactive*. By predicting user movement and tailoring the acoustic landscape, it aims to dramatically improve speech recognition accuracy, reduce latency, and enhance the overall user experience. The integration of acoustic shaping adds another layer of control over the acoustic environment.
