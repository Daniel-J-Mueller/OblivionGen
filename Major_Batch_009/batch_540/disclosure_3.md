## Adaptive Threat Response via Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Proactively allocate computing resources to investigate potential threats *before* they fully manifest, based on correlated threat intelligence and predictive modeling of resource demand during an attack.

**Specification:**

**I. System Components:**

1.  **Threat Intelligence Core (TIC):**  Receives correlated threat information as per the base patent, but extends it with a predictive modeling engine.
2.  **Resource Demand Profiler (RDP):**  Analyzes historical data of resource utilization during past security incidents (both real and simulated). Creates profiles detailing resource needs (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, storage I/O) for different attack vectors and severity levels.  This includes modeling scaling requirements.
3.  **Predictive Resource Allocator (PRA):** The core innovation.  Monitors the TIC output and, based on the modeled threat characteristics (from TIC) and the RDP profiles, *proactively* requests resource allocation from a cloud infrastructure manager (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS Auto Scaling). This allocation occurs *before* definitive anomalous activity is detected, creating a ‘warm’ pool of resources ready for immediate deployment.
4.  **Dynamic Analysis Sandbox (DAS):** A dedicated environment provisioned by the PRA. Incoming suspicious events (identified via correlated threat data) are immediately routed to the DAS for deeper analysis without impacting production systems.  The DAS scales dynamically based on the event volume.
5.  **Feedback Loop:**  Performance data from the DAS and incident response actions are fed back into the RDP to refine resource demand profiles and improve predictive accuracy.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  The TIC receives and correlates threat intelligence.
2.  The TIC identifies a potential threat with characteristics matching known attack patterns.
3.  The TIC sends threat characteristics to the PRA.
4.  The PRA consults the RDP to determine the resource needs for investigating this type of threat.
5.  The PRA proactively requests the necessary resources from the cloud infrastructure manager.
6.  A DAS instance is automatically provisioned with the requested resources.
7.  Suspicious events related to the threat are routed to the DAS for analysis.
8.  The DAS performs automated analysis, including behavioral analysis, malware scanning, and network traffic analysis.
9.  Results from the DAS are used to confirm or refute the threat.
10. Incident response actions are triggered as needed.
11. Performance data from the DAS and incident response actions are fed back into the RDP to refine resource demand profiles.

**III. Pseudocode (PRA - Predictive Resource Allocator):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION AllocateResources(ThreatCharacteristics)
  // ThreatCharacteristics contains features like attack vector, severity, target system, etc.

  ResourceProfile = RDP.GetResourceProfile(ThreatCharacteristics)

  If ResourceProfile == NULL Then
    // Handle unknown threat profile – fallback to default profile or alert administrator
    Log("Unknown threat profile: " + ThreatCharacteristics)
    ResourceProfile = RDP.GetDefaultResourceProfile()
  End If

  RequiredCPU = ResourceProfile.CPU
  RequiredMemory = ResourceProfile.Memory
  RequiredBandwidth = ResourceProfile.Bandwidth

  // Check if sufficient resources are currently available.
  AvailableCPU = GetAvailableCPU()
  AvailableMemory = GetAvailableMemory()
  AvailableBandwidth = GetAvailableBandwidth()

  If AvailableCPU < RequiredCPU OR AvailableMemory < RequiredMemory OR AvailableBandwidth < RequiredBandwidth Then
    // Request additional resources from cloud provider.
    RequestResources(RequiredCPU - AvailableCPU, RequiredMemory - AvailableMemory, RequiredBandwidth - AvailableBandwidth)
    WaitUntilResourcesAvailable() //Or implement a queuing mechanism
  End If

  // Provision Dynamic Analysis Sandbox (DAS) instance
  DASInstance = ProvisionDAS(RequiredCPU, RequiredMemory, RequiredBandwidth)
  Return DASInstance
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION RequestResources(CPU, Memory, Bandwidth)
  //Cloud provider specific API call to scale infrastructure
  //e.g., Kubernetes scale deployment, AWS Auto Scaling group
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ProvisionDAS(CPU, Memory, Bandwidth)
  //API call to create a sandbox instance with the specified resources
END FUNCTION
```

**IV.  Novelty & Potential:**

This design moves beyond reactive security measures by anticipating resource needs. It enables faster threat analysis, reduces the impact of attacks on production systems, and improves overall security posture. The predictive modeling component allows for efficient resource utilization and cost optimization. The feedback loop ensures continuous improvement in resource allocation accuracy.
