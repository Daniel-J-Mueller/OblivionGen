## Multi-Modal Contextual Awareness & Predictive Action System

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple “last used” context to create a system that anticipates user needs based on a fusion of environmental, biometric, and historical data, proactively preparing devices *before* a wakeword is even detected.

**System Components:**

1.  **Sensor Fusion Hub:**
    *   Microphones (existing)
    *   Low-resolution cameras (IR preferred for privacy) – facial recognition, gesture detection, room occupancy.
    *   Biometric Sensors (optional, user-opt-in) – wearable integration (heart rate, skin conductance - indicators of stress/engagement), ambient temperature/humidity sensors.
    *   Location Services – room-level awareness.
    *   Network Data – Calendar, email, messaging (with user permission) – anticipating needs based on scheduled events/communications.

2.  **Contextual Reasoning Engine:**
    *   Real-time data ingestion from Sensor Fusion Hub.
    *   Historical data storage & analysis – user preferences, usage patterns.
    *   Predictive Modeling – Machine Learning algorithms (RNNs, LSTMs) to forecast likely user actions based on fused contextual data.
    *   “Action Readiness” Score – assigns a probability score to potential user actions (e.g., “play music,” “make call,” “set timer”).

3.  **Device Orchestration Layer:**
    *   Device Registry – list of available devices (speakers, lights, displays, etc.).
    *   Preemptive Device Activation – based on “Action Readiness” scores, the system *proactively* prepares devices. For example:
        *   If “play music” score is high, start buffering the user's preferred playlist.
        *   If “make call” score is high, prime the speakerphone.
        *   If “set timer” score is high, display a partially-populated timer interface.
    *   Wakeword Detection as a *Confirmation* – when a wakeword is detected, the system doesn’t *start* the action, it *confirms* the pre-prepared state.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    sensorData = getSensorData();
    historicalData = getHistoricalData();

    context = fuseData(sensorData, historicalData);
    actionReadinessScores = predictActionScores(context);

    for (each action in possibleActions) {
        if (actionReadinessScores[action] > threshold) {
            prepareDevice(action); // Buffer playlist, prime speakerphone, etc.
        }
    }

    if (wakewordDetected()) {
        confirmAction(); // Execute the pre-prepared action.
    }
}
```

**Novelty:**

*   **Shifts from Reactive to Proactive:**  Current systems react *after* a wakeword. This system anticipates *before*, reducing latency and improving perceived responsiveness.
*   **Multi-Modal Context:** Combines environmental, biometric, and historical data for a more holistic understanding of user intent.
*   **Wakeword as Confirmation:** Reframes wakeword detection – not the trigger, but the final confirmation of an anticipated action.
