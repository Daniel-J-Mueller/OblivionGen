## Dynamic Style Blending for Generative Image Editing

**Specification:** A system for real-time, user-guided image manipulation leveraging dynamic style blending based on convolutional neural network feature spaces, extending beyond simple similarity assessment.

**Core Concept:** Instead of *finding* similar images, we *create* novel images by dynamically blending style and content features from multiple source images based on user interaction.  The system uses the principles of the existing patent – Gram matrix-based style representation and vector distance-based content representation – but applies them in a generative loop, not a comparative one.

**System Components:**

1.  **Source Image Input:** Accepts multiple source images (at least two).
2.  **CNN Feature Extraction:** Employs a pre-trained convolutional neural network (e.g., VGG, ResNet) to extract style and content features from each source image.  Layers for style and content extraction are configurable.
3.  **Interactive Style/Content Weighting:**  A user interface allowing real-time adjustment of style and content weights for each source image.  This could be a slider interface, or more advanced – allowing the user to "paint" influence maps onto the target image.
4.  **Dynamic Blending Engine:** This is the core of the innovation. It operates as follows:
    *   **Style Blending:**  For each layer selected for style transfer, calculate a weighted sum of the Gram matrices from the source images, using the user-defined weights.
    *   **Content Blending:**  For each layer selected for content transfer, calculate a weighted sum of the feature vectors from the source images, using the user-defined weights.
    *   **Image Reconstruction:** Using the blended style and content representations, reconstruct a new image. This could be achieved through iterative optimization, or generative adversarial networks (GANs).
5.  **Feedback Loop:**  Display the reconstructed image to the user, allowing for continuous adjustment of the weights and parameters.
6.  **Layer Masking:** A feature allowing the user to selectively apply style and content transfer from specific source images to *specific regions* of the target image.

**Pseudocode (Blending Engine):**

```
function blend_image(target_image, source_images, style_weights, content_weights, style_layers, content_layers):
  # Extract features from all images
  features = extract_features(target_image, source_images, style_layers, content_layers)

  # Calculate blended style representations
  blended_style = {}
  for layer in style_layers:
    blended_style[layer] = 0
    for i, source_image in enumerate(source_images):
      blended_style[layer] += style_weights[i] * features[i][layer].gram_matrix

  # Calculate blended content representations
  blended_content = {}
  for layer in content_layers:
    blended_content[layer] = 0
    for i, source_image in enumerate(source_images):
      blended_content[layer] += content_weights[i] * features[i][layer].feature_vector
    
  #Reconstruct image from blended features.
  reconstructed_image = reconstruct(blended_style, blended_content)
  return reconstructed_image
```

**Configurable Parameters:**

*   `style_layers`: List of layers to use for style transfer.
*   `content_layers`: List of layers to use for content transfer.
*   `style_weights`: Weights for each source image's style contribution.
*   `content_weights`: Weights for each source image's content contribution.
*   `optimization_iterations`: Number of iterations for image reconstruction (if using iterative optimization).
*   `learning_rate`: Learning rate for image reconstruction.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time image editing and artistic effects.
*   Content creation and style mixing.
*   Image restoration and enhancement.
*   Generative art and design.
