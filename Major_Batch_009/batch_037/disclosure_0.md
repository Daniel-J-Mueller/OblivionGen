## Adaptive Key Sharding with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the request-supplied key concept by dynamically sharding the symmetric key across multiple service provider nodes, coupled with a temporal decay mechanism for each shard. This drastically increases security and resilience against compromise, while also providing a natural key rotation system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Generation & Sharding Module (Service Provider Side):**

*   **Input:** Symmetric key (AES-256 preferred) provided in the request.
*   **Process:**
    *   Generate *n* random seeds.
    *   Using a Key Derivation Function (KDF) like HKDF-SHA256, derive *n* key shards from the original symmetric key and each seed.  Each shard will be a reduced-length key (e.g., AES-128 from AES-256).
    *   Distribute each shard to a different, geographically dispersed service provider node. Record the node ID and associated shard.
    *   Assign a Time-To-Live (TTL) value to each shard, configurable by the user or determined by a service-level agreement (SLA). TTL represents the duration the shard is valid.  Shorter TTLs increase security but require more frequent re-keying.
    *   Maintain a shard revocation list to invalidate compromised or expired shards.
*   **Output:**  Shard distribution map (node ID -> shard), TTL values, revocation list.

**2.  Request Processing Module (Service Provider Side):**

*   **Input:** Data to be encrypted/decrypted, user request, shard distribution map, revocation list.
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify the necessary shards for the operation (based on data segment or algorithm requirements).
    *   Verify that each shard is valid (not revoked, within TTL).
    *   If any shard is invalid, initiate re-keying (see below).
    *   Perform the encryption/decryption operation using the assembled shards.  A multi-party computation (MPC) technique is preferable for enhanced security.
*   **Output:** Encrypted/decrypted data.

**3. Re-Keying Module (Service Provider Side):**

*   **Trigger:** Invalid shard detected.
*   **Process:**
    *   Request the user to provide the original symmetric key again.
    *   Regenerate the key shards using a new set of random seeds.
    *   Distribute the new shards.
    *   Update the shard distribution map.
    *   Decommission the old shards.

**4. User Interface (Client Side):**

*   **Functionality:**
    *   Key Upload: Securely transmit the symmetric key.
    *   TTL Configuration: Allow the user to specify the TTL for key shards.
    *   Re-Keying Request: Initiate re-keying when prompted by the service provider.
    *   Auditing: Provide logs of key shard distribution and re-keying events.

**Pseudocode (Encryption):**

```
// Service Provider Side
function encryptData(data, userKey, shardMap, revocationList) {
  shards = []
  for (nodeId, shard in shardMap) {
    if (!isRevoked(shard, revocationList) && isValidTTL(shard)) {
      shards.add(shard)
    }
  }

  if (shards.length < requiredShards) {
    requestReKeying()
    return error("Insufficient Valid Shards")
  }

  encryptedData = performMPCEncryption(data, shards) //Multi-Party Computation
  return encryptedData
}

//Client Side
function sendData(data, userKey){
  send(data, userKey)
}
```

**Novelty:** This builds on request-supplied keys by introducing dynamic sharding, geographical distribution, and temporal decay, creating a highly resilient and automatically rotating key system.  MPC enhances security by minimizing the exposure of the full key at any single node.  The multi-layered approach adds significant defense-in-depth.
