## Adaptive Perimeter Beacon Network

**Concept:** Expand beyond a single sensor/security device pairing to create a dynamic, adaptable perimeter using multiple low-power beacons, each capable of independent assessment & relaying information. This moves beyond simply *unlocking* a location to actively *monitoring* a defined area.

**Specifications:**

*   **Beacon Hardware:**
    *   Low-power wide-area network (LoRaWAN) or similar connectivity.
    *   Miniature camera (low resolution, IR capable).
    *   Microphone array (for sound event detection).
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality).
    *   Tamper detection (physical intrusion alert).
    *   Battery life: minimum 1 year operation. Solar charging option.
    *   Ruggedized, weatherproof housing.
*   **Network Topology:** Mesh network. Beacons communicate directly with each other and a central control hub. Redundancy built-in – if one beacon fails, others route information.
*   **Central Control Hub:**
    *   Runs AI-powered analytics.
    *   Receives data from all beacons.
    *   Processes data for anomaly detection.
    *   Manages beacon network.
    *   Provides user interface for monitoring and control.
*   **Delivery Agent Integration:**
    *   Agent’s device receives a dynamically generated “perimeter key” via the network upon initiating a delivery.
    *   This key authenticates the agent to the beacon network, not just a single sensor.
    *   Agent’s device constantly broadcasts its location to the network.
    *   Beacons use triangulation to confirm the agent’s position within the authorized delivery zone.
*   **Dynamic Security Zones:**
    *   The system allows the user to define multiple security zones within the perimeter. For example, a "package drop-off zone" and a "restricted access zone."
    *   Access permissions are assigned to each zone.
*   **AI-Driven Anomaly Detection:**
    *   The AI analyzes data from all sensors to detect anomalies.
    *   Examples: unexpected movement, unusual sounds, changes in air quality.
    *   Alerts are sent to the user if an anomaly is detected.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:**
    *   Combination of location verification, facial recognition (from camera), and voice authentication.
*   **Pseudocode - Beacon Processing Loop:**

```
LOOP:
    Receive Data (LoRaWAN)
    IF Data Type == "AgentLocation":
        Calculate Distance to Agent
        IF Distance < AuthorizedRadius:
            Send Confirmation to Hub
        ELSE:
            Send Alert to Hub
    IF Data Type == "SensorData":
        Process SensorData
        IF SensorData Indicates Anomaly:
            Send Alert to Hub
    IF PeriodicUpdateTriggered:
        Capture Image
        Capture Audio
        Send SensorData to Hub
    ENDLOOP
```

*   **Extended Functionality:**
    *   Integration with smart home systems (lights, alarms).
    *   Remote monitoring of environmental conditions.
    *   Automated alerts for potential hazards (e.g., water leaks, smoke).
    *   Historical data logging for security and environmental analysis.
    *   Geofencing capabilities for automated access control.
