## Dynamic Asset Pre-Fetching Based on Predictive Gaze Tracking

**Concept:** Extend the viewport-based performance optimization by *predictively* pre-fetching assets based on likely user gaze direction. This moves beyond reacting to the current viewport to anticipating future rendering needs, significantly reducing perceived latency.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires integration with gaze tracking hardware (built-in eye trackers on devices, or webcam-based gaze estimation).  Assume gaze data provides X,Y coordinates representing the user's point of focus on the screen, along with a confidence score.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Gaze Prediction Engine:**  This module analyzes historical gaze data (user's typical scanning patterns) and current gaze direction to predict where the user will likely look *next*.  Utilizes a Kalman filter or similar predictive algorithm. Output: Predicted Gaze Point (X,Y) with confidence score, and prediction horizon (e.g., 200ms into the future).
    *   **Predictive Viewport Module:**  Creates a *predicted viewport* around the Predicted Gaze Point.  The size of the predicted viewport is adjustable but should be larger than the standard viewport to account for head movements and rapid saccades.
    *   **Asset Prioritization Module:** Identifies assets (images, videos, etc.) that fall within the Predictive Viewport but *not* the standard viewport.  Prioritizes these assets for pre-fetching.
    *   **Adaptive Pre-Fetch Rate Limiter:**  Limits the number of pre-fetched assets to prevent overwhelming network bandwidth and client resources.  Adjusts the pre-fetch rate based on network conditions and client device capabilities.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Gaze tracking hardware provides gaze data (X,Y, confidence) to the Gaze Prediction Engine.
    2.  Gaze Prediction Engine predicts the next gaze point and provides coordinates with a confidence score.
    3.  Predictive Viewport Module creates a predictive viewport around the predicted gaze point.
    4.  Asset Prioritization Module identifies assets within the predictive viewport but not the standard viewport.
    5.  Adaptive Pre-Fetch Rate Limiter regulates the pre-fetching of these assets.

**Pseudocode (Asset Prioritization Module):**

```
function prioritizeAssets(standardViewport, predictiveViewport, assetList):
    prioritizedAssets = []
    for asset in assetList:
        if asset.intersects(predictiveViewport) and not asset.intersects(standardViewport):
            prioritizedAssets.append(asset)
    return prioritizedAssets
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `PredictionHorizon`:  Duration (in milliseconds) into the future to predict gaze direction.
*   `PredictiveViewportSize`: Size of the predictive viewport (e.g., width and height in pixels).
*   `MaxPrefetchAssets`: Maximum number of assets to pre-fetch at a time.
*   `PrefetchPriorityBoost`: A factor to increase the priority of pre-fetched assets.
*   `GazeConfidenceThreshold`: Minimum confidence score for gaze data to be considered valid.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly reduced perceived latency, as assets are likely already loaded when the user looks at them.
*   Improved user experience, especially for content-rich web pages and applications.
*   Adaptive performance optimization based on user behavior and gaze direction.
