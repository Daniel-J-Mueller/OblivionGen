## Adaptive Encapsulation Mesh

**Specification:** Implement a system enabling dynamic, multi-path encapsulation selection based on real-time network conditions and application requirements. This extends beyond the single encapsulation/de-encapsulation pairs described in the provided patent.

**Components:**

*   **Encapsulation Profiles:** Define encapsulation methods (VxLAN, GRE, proprietary) with associated performance characteristics (latency, bandwidth, overhead). Profiles are versioned and updated dynamically.
*   **Path Probes:** Lightweight probes continuously assess network paths between user networks and provider network resources. Metrics include latency, packet loss, jitter, and bandwidth availability.
*   **Encapsulation Mesh Manager:** Central controller responsible for managing encapsulation profiles, collecting path probe data, and making encapsulation decisions.
*   **Distributed Encapsulation Nodes (DENs):**  Nodes within the provider network capable of performing encapsulation/de-encapsulation using multiple profiles. These replace the single forwarding/virtual router paradigm.
*   **Application-Aware Routing:** Integration with application layer data to prioritize encapsulation paths based on application requirements (e.g., low latency for gaming, high bandwidth for video streaming).

**Operation:**

1.  **Profile Discovery:** DENs register available encapsulation profiles with the Encapsulation Mesh Manager.
2.  **Path Monitoring:** Path Probes continuously monitor network paths between user networks and provider resources. Data is reported to the Encapsulation Mesh Manager.
3.  **Encapsulation Decision:** When a new flow is established, the Encapsulation Mesh Manager analyzes available paths and application requirements. It selects the optimal encapsulation profile and DEN for the flow.
4.  **Dynamic Adaptation:** The Encapsulation Mesh Manager continuously monitors network conditions. If conditions change, it can dynamically re-route traffic to a different DEN or change the encapsulation profile.
5.  **Flow Steering:** Traffic is steered to the selected DEN based on flow identifiers.
6. **DEN Operation:** The DEN encapsulates/de-encapsulates packets based on the selected profile and forwards them to the destination.
7. **Encapsulation Chaining:** Multiple DENs can be chained together to provide advanced encapsulation features such as security and compression.

**Pseudocode (Encapsulation Mesh Manager â€“ Flow Establishment):**

```
function establishFlow(flowId, sourceAddress, destinationAddress, applicationRequirements):
  paths = getAvailablePaths(sourceAddress, destinationAddress)
  bestPath = null
  bestScore = -1

  for each path in paths:
    for each encapsulationProfile in path.supportedProfiles:
      score = calculateScore(encapsulationProfile, path.metrics, applicationRequirements)
      if score > bestScore:
        bestScore = score
        bestPath = path
        bestProfile = encapsulationProfile

  if bestPath != null:
    activateFlow(flowId, bestPath, bestProfile)
    return true
  else:
    return false

function calculateScore(encapsulationProfile, pathMetrics, applicationRequirements):
  latencyWeight = applicationRequirements.latencyWeight
  bandwidthWeight = applicationRequirements.bandwidthWeight
  overheadWeight = applicationRequirements.overheadWeight

  latencyScore = calculateLatencyScore(pathMetrics.latency, encapsulationProfile.latency)
  bandwidthScore = calculateBandwidthScore(pathMetrics.bandwidth, encapsulationProfile.bandwidth)
  overheadScore = calculateOverheadScore(encapsulationProfile.overhead)

  score = (latencyWeight * latencyScore) + (bandwidthWeight * bandwidthScore) + (overheadWeight * overheadScore)
  return score
```

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   Distributed architecture minimizes single points of failure.
*   Horizontal scaling of DENs and Encapsulation Mesh Manager.
*   Automatic failover and load balancing.
*   Profile versioning supports seamless updates without disrupting existing flows.
