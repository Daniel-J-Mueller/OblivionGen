## Adaptive Query Federation with Predictive Pre-fetching

**Concept:** Expand upon the multi-datastore query capabilities by introducing a predictive pre-fetching mechanism based on historical query patterns and data change events. This anticipates data needs *before* the full query is executed, significantly reducing latency, particularly for frequently accessed data.

**Specs:**

1.  **Query Pattern Historian:**
    *   Records all queries (syntax tree representation as per the patent) along with execution times, datastore access patterns, and resulting data subsets.
    *   Uses a time-decaying mechanism to prioritize recent patterns.
    *   Employs clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to identify common query shapes and data access profiles.

2.  **Data Change Event Listener:**
    *   Monitors all datastores for data modifications (inserts, updates, deletes).
    *   Records change events with associated data attributes and timestamps.
    *   Tracks data volatility – frequency and magnitude of changes for each attribute.

3.  **Predictive Prefetching Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Current query (syntax tree), Query Pattern Historian, Data Change Event Listener.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Analyzes the current query’s syntax tree to identify potential data attributes and conditions.
        *   Matches the query’s pattern to historical queries using fuzzy matching and similarity scores.
        *   Identifies likely datastores based on historical access patterns.
        *   Predicts data attributes likely to be required *before* full query execution based on historical patterns and data volatility.
        *   Initiates asynchronous pre-fetching requests for predicted data from the identified datastores.
        *   Dynamically adjusts pre-fetching aggressiveness based on real-time system load and resource availability.
    *   **Output:** Prefetched data stored in a local, in-memory cache (e.g., Redis or Memcached).

4.  **Adaptive Query Plan Optimizer:**
    *   Modifies the original query plan to prioritize data from the pre-fetch cache.
    *   Rewrites queries to leverage cached data whenever possible.
    *   Dynamically switches between cached data and datastore access based on data freshness and cache hit rates.
    *   Prioritizes datastores with lower latency during query plan generation.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```pseudocode
function predict_and_prefetch(current_query):
  historical_patterns = QueryPatternHistorian.get_similar_patterns(current_query)
  likely_datastores = []
  predicted_attributes = []

  for pattern in historical_patterns:
    likely_datastores.extend(pattern.datastore_access_pattern)
    predicted_attributes.extend(pattern.accessed_attributes)

  // Filter for unique values
  likely_datastores = unique(likely_datastores)
  predicted_attributes = unique(predicted_attributes)

  // Apply volatility weighting - prioritize prefetching frequently changing data
  for attribute in predicted_attributes:
    volatility = DataChangeEventListener.get_volatility(attribute)
    prefetch_priority = volatility // Higher volatility = higher priority

  // Initiate asynchronous prefetch requests
  for datastore in likely_datastores:
    for attribute in predicted_attributes:
      prefetch_data(datastore, attribute)

  return //Prefetched data available in cache
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Query Pattern:** {query\_tree, datastore\_access\_pattern, accessed\_attributes, execution\_time}
*   **Volatility Score:** (Attribute, ChangeFrequency, ChangeMagnitude)

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced query latency, especially for frequently accessed data.
*   Improved system responsiveness.
*   Scalability – pre-fetching can offload processing from the main query execution thread.
*   Adaptability – the system learns from historical patterns and adjusts pre-fetching behavior dynamically.
