## Dynamic Component Inheritance & ‘Ghost’ Components

**Concept:** Extend the component grouping concept to facilitate a system of component inheritance and temporary, ‘ghost’ components for rapid prototyping and experimentation within the editor. This builds on the idea of grouping, but moves toward a more powerful system for managing complexity and promoting reuse.

**Specification:**

1.  **Component Inheritance:** Allow component groups to be designated as ‘base’ groups.  Any new component group created can inherit all parameters and settings from a designated base group. Modifications to the base group *automatically* propagate to all inheriting groups (with optional override capabilities - see #4).
2.  **'Ghost' Component Creation:** Within the editor, users can create ‘ghost’ components.  These are components that *do not exist in the final build*.  They serve purely as prototyping tools. Ghost components appear and function identically to normal components within the editor, but are flagged during build to be excluded.  
3.  **Ghost Component Linking:**  Ghost components can be linked to existing component groups.  Any parameters exposed on the linked group are then visible and editable *through* the ghost component, providing a convenient interface for prototyping without affecting the core component structure. This could be visually indicated in the editor by a semi-transparent overlay on the ghost component.
4.  **Parameter Overrides:**  Allow individual inheriting groups to override specific parameters from the base group.  This override can be ‘local’ (affecting only this instance) or ‘propagated’ (affecting all further inheriting groups). A visual indicator (e.g., a broken link icon) would denote overridden parameters.
5.  **Component Group Versioning:**  Implement a simple version control system for component groups.  This allows users to revert to previous states, compare changes, and collaborate more effectively.
6.  **Dynamic Parameter Visibility:** Allow parameters to be conditionally visible/editable based on the values of *other* parameters within the same component group or related groups. This adds a layer of complexity but enables more intuitive editor experiences.
7. **'Component Recipes':** Enable users to save component group structures as 'recipes' that can be applied to new entities. These recipes would include base groups, inherited groups, and any customized settings. 

**Pseudocode (simplified – focuses on inheritance):**

```
Class ComponentGroup:
    name: String
    parameters: Dictionary<String, Parameter>
    baseGroup: ComponentGroup (nullable)

    Function ApplyInheritance():
        For each parameter in baseGroup.parameters:
            If parameter not in this.parameters:
                this.parameters[parameter.name] = parameter.copy()

    Function GetParameterValue(parameterName):
        If parameterName in this.parameters:
            return this.parameters[parameterName].value
        Else If this.baseGroup != null:
            return this.baseGroup.GetParameterValue(parameterName)
        Else:
            return null

    Function SetParameterValue(parameterName, newValue):
        If parameterName in this.parameters:
            this.parameters[parameterName].value = newValue
        Else If this.baseGroup != null:
            this.baseGroup.SetParameterValue(parameterName, newValue)
        Else:
            // Handle case where parameter doesn't exist
```

**Editor UI Considerations:**

*   Visual hierarchy for displaying inherited parameters.
*   Clear indication of overridden parameters.
*   Intuitive interface for managing base group relationships.
*   Easy access to version control history.
*   Color coding to differentiate between regular, inherited, and overridden parameters.
*  'Ghost' components displayed with a distinctive visual style (e.g., semi-transparent).
