## Dynamic Scene Graph Integration for Interactive Video

**Concept:** Extend object identification beyond simple attribute display to create a dynamic, interactive scene graph derived from video content. This allows users to not just *see* an object, but *interact* with it within the video context.

**Specifications:**

**1. Scene Graph Construction Module:**

*   **Input:** Video stream, object detection output (bounding boxes, classifications, confidence scores) from existing systems (like the one described in the patent).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Temporal Filtering: Smooth bounding box data across frames to reduce jitter.  Kalman filtering or similar techniques.
    *   Relationship Inference: Analyze spatial relationships between detected objects (e.g., "cup on table", "person wearing hat"). Utilize 3D pose estimation (if available) for more accurate relationship inference.
    *   Semantic Tagging:  Attach semantic tags to objects and relationships (e.g., "furniture", "clothing", "support").
    *   Graph Creation: Construct a dynamic scene graph where nodes represent objects and edges represent relationships. The graph is updated in real-time as the video progresses.
*   **Output:** Real-time scene graph data structure.

**2. Interactive Layer Module:**

*   **Input:** Scene graph data, user input (mouse clicks, touch events, voice commands).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Object Selection:  Identify the object the user interacted with based on its position within the video frame.
    *   Action Triggering:  Based on the selected object and the user's input, trigger corresponding actions.  Possible actions:
        *   Information Display: Show detailed information about the object (e.g., product details, historical facts).
        *   Object Manipulation: Allow the user to virtually manipulate the object within the video (e.g., rotate, zoom, change color).  This requires rendering the object in 3D based on its bounding box and inferred geometry.
        *   Scene Branching:  Based on the object interacted with, branch the video to a different scene or storyline.
        *   Contextual Actions: Trigger actions specific to the context of the scene (e.g., if the user interacts with a cooking pot, display a recipe).
*   **Output:** Modified video stream (with overlaid information or rendered objects), triggered actions.

**3.  Knowledge Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Scene graph data, external knowledge databases (e.g., Wikipedia, product catalogs, social media feeds).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Semantic Enrichment: Enhance the scene graph with information from external databases. For example, if an object is identified as a "Eiffel Tower", retrieve historical facts, tourist information, and related images from Wikipedia.
    *   Personalization:  Tailor the information displayed to the user's interests and preferences (based on user profiles or browsing history).
    *   Social Integration:  Connect the scene graph to social media feeds, allowing users to share their interactions with others.
*   **Output:** Enhanced scene graph data, personalized information, social media integration.

**Pseudocode (Interactive Layer Module):**

```
function handleUserInput(videoFrame, userInput, sceneGraph) {
  selectedObject = findObjectAtPosition(videoFrame, userInput.x, userInput.y, sceneGraph);

  if (selectedObject != null) {
    switch (userInput.action) {
      case "info":
        displayObjectInfo(selectedObject);
      case "manipulate":
        render3DObject(selectedObject); // Render and allow manipulation
      case "branch":
        branchVideo(selectedObject.type); // Branch based on object type
      default:
        // Handle other actions
    }
  }
}
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   Real-time processing is crucial.  Hardware acceleration (GPUs) may be necessary.
*   Accuracy of object detection and relationship inference is critical.
*   Scalability to handle complex scenes with many objects.
*   User interface design to provide intuitive interactions.
