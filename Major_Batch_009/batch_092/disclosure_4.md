**Adaptive Data Object Prefetching with Predictive Transformation**

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand computation concept to *proactively* generate likely future data object transformations, not just in response to a request. This aims to reduce perceived latency and improve user experience by anticipating needs.

**Specs:**

1.  **Historical Transformation Graph:**  Maintain a graph tracking all user-defined transformations applied to source data objects.  Nodes represent transformations (e.g., thumbnail, watermarking, resolution scaling), edges represent the sequence of transformations applied.  Edge weights reflect frequency of use.
2.  **User Behavior Modeling:** Implement a probabilistic model of user behavior. This model should track:
    *   **Data Object Access Patterns:** Which source data objects are frequently accessed.
    *   **Transformation Sequences:** Which sequences of transformations are most common *after* accessing a specific source data object.  (e.g., User opens image -> 90% chance they request a thumbnail, 5% chance they request a cropped version, 5% other).
    *   **Time Decay:**  Apply a time decay factor to historical data, giving more weight to recent activity.
3.  **Predictive Transformation Queue:** Based on the user behavior model, maintain a queue of predicted transformations for each actively accessed source data object. The queue should prioritize transformations with the highest probability and consider the estimated computational cost (see below).
4.  **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**  Before generating a predicted transformation, perform a cost-benefit analysis:
    *   **Computational Cost:** Estimate the CPU, memory, and network bandwidth required to generate the transformation.
    *   **Latency Reduction:** Estimate the latency saved by pre-generating the transformation (compared to generating it on demand).
    *   **Storage Cost:**  Estimate the storage space required to store the pre-generated transformation.
    *   If the latency reduction outweighs the computational and storage costs, proceed with pre-generation.
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor user behavior and adjust the predictive transformation queue and cost-benefit analysis accordingly.  Incorrect predictions should *reduce* the probability of that transformation being pre-fetched in the future.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// On Data Object Access:
function handleDataObjectAccess(sourceDataObject) {
  predictedTransformations = getUserBehaviorModel().getPredictedTransformations(sourceDataObject)
  for (transformation in predictedTransformations) {
    if (costBenefitAnalysis(sourceDataObject, transformation)) {
      generateDataObject(sourceDataObject, transformation)
      // Store pre-generated data object
    }
  }
}

function costBenefitAnalysis(sourceDataObject, transformation) {
  computationalCost = estimateComputationalCost(sourceDataObject, transformation)
  latencyReduction = estimateLatencyReduction(transformation)
  storageCost = estimateStorageCost(transformation)

  if (latencyReduction > (computationalCost + storageCost)) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}

// When user requests a transformation:
function handleTransformationRequest(sourceDataObject, transformation) {
  if (preGeneratedDataObjectExists(sourceDataObject, transformation)) {
    return preGeneratedDataObject
  } else {
    generatedDataObject = generateDataObject(sourceDataObject, transformation)
    // Update historical data
    return generatedDataObject
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `HistoricalTransformationGraph`: Graph database or adjacency matrix.
*   `UserBehaviorModel`:  Probabilistic model (e.g., Markov chain, Bayesian network).
*   `PredictedTransformationQueue`: Priority queue.
*   `CostBenefitAnalysisData`: Data structure to store cost and benefit estimates.
