## Adaptive Difficulty & Narrative Branching via External Input

**Concept:** Extend the system to dynamically adjust game difficulty *and* alter the narrative path based on external user input received through the inline frame, effectively turning spectators into active storytellers.

**Specifications:**

*   **Input Types:** Expand the inline frame to support diverse input methods beyond simple modifications. Include:
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze text input to gauge spectator mood/intent (e.g., "make it harder," "more suspenseful").
    *   **Choice Selection:** Present multiple-choice options to spectators, dictating character actions or plot points.
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Allow spectators to 'donate' or 'withdraw' resources from the game world (e.g., health, ammunition, manpower).
*   **Difficulty Adjustment Module:**
    *   **Real-time Calibration:** Implement an algorithm that adjusts game parameters (enemy AI, resource scarcity, environmental hazards) based on spectator sentiment and input. A positive sentiment might lower difficulty, while negative sentiment or requests for a challenge would increase it.
    *   **Dynamic Scaling:** Difficulty changes should be gradual and avoid abrupt shifts that break immersion.
*   **Narrative Branching Engine:**
    *   **Decision Nodes:** Integrate 'decision nodes' into the game's narrative structure. Spectator choices at these nodes determine which path the story takes.
    *   **Content Integration:** Pre-create multiple narrative branches and integrate them into the game engine. The branching engine selects the appropriate content based on spectator input.
    *   **Procedural Generation Augmentation:** If narrative branches are limited, augment the system with procedural content generation to create unique scenarios based on spectator choices.
*   **State Data Integration:**
    *   **Spectator Input Metadata:** Associate all spectator input with a timestamp and a game state snapshot. This allows the system to accurately track the impact of spectator choices.
    *   **Input Prioritization:** Implement a prioritization system to resolve conflicting spectator input (e.g., if multiple spectators request different actions).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Input Visualization:** Display a visual representation of spectator input in the inline frame (e.g., a sentiment meter, a list of active requests).
    *   **Influence Indication:** Provide feedback to spectators, indicating how their input has affected the game world.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Branching Engine):**

```
function processSpectatorInput(input, gameState):
  if input.type == "choice":
    decisionNode = findCurrentDecisionNode(gameState)
    if decisionNode:
      gameState = applyChoice(decisionNode, input.choice, gameState)
  else if input.type == "sentiment":
    difficultyLevel = calculateDifficultyLevel(input.sentiment, gameState)
    gameState = adjustDifficulty(difficultyLevel, gameState)
  return gameState
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Network Latency: Minimize latency between spectator input and game response.
*   Scalability: Design the system to handle a large number of concurrent spectators.
*   Security: Protect against malicious spectator input.
*   Content Creation: Develop tools for creating and managing narrative branches.
