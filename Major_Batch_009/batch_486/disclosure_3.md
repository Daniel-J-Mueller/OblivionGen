## Dynamic Access Revocation Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Behavioral Authentication Module (BAM) – a software component integrated into the document management and collaboration system.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User device identifiers (as per the provided patent - host name, IP address, etc.)
    *   Real-time user interaction data: keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns, scrolling speed, typing cadence, application usage patterns *within* the document viewer/editor.
    *   Time-based access control rules (defined by administrators or users).
*   **Data Storage:** Encrypted user behavioral profiles – stored locally on the server and, optionally, on the user device (with user consent).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Baseline Profiling:** During initial usage, BAM establishes a baseline behavioral profile for each user on each device.  This involves recording a representative set of interaction data.
    2.  **Real-time Monitoring:** BAM continuously monitors user interactions.
    3.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, machine learning classifiers) compare real-time interactions to the baseline profile. Significant deviations trigger anomaly scores.
    4.  **Dynamic Access Control:**
        *   A configurable threshold is established for anomaly scores.
        *   If the anomaly score exceeds the threshold, the system initiates targeted denial of access – *not* immediate lock-out, but escalating restrictions.
        *   **Restriction Levels:**
            *   **Level 1 (Warning):**  Multi-factor authentication prompt.
            *   **Level 2 (Limited Access):**  Read-only mode.  Editing, downloading, printing disabled.
            *   **Level 3 (Revocation):**  Access completely denied.  Session terminated.
        *   Users can appeal restrictions via a verification process.
*   **API:** Secure API for integration with existing authentication and authorization systems.
*   **Security:** End-to-end encryption of behavioral data. Secure storage of profiles. Audit trails of access control decisions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function monitorUserActivity(userID, deviceID) {
  interactionData = captureInteractionData(); // keystrokes, mouse movements, scrolling, app usage
  profile = loadUserProfile(userID, deviceID);
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(interactionData, profile);

  if (anomalyScore > threshold) {
    restrictionLevel = determineRestrictionLevel(anomalyScore);
    applyAccessControl(userID, deviceID, restrictionLevel);
  }
}

function applyAccessControl(userID, deviceID, restrictionLevel) {
  if (restrictionLevel == 1) {
    promptForMFA();
  } else if (restrictionLevel == 2) {
    setAccessMode("read-only");
  } else if (restrictionLevel == 3) {
    terminateSession();
  }
}
```

**Innovation Detail:**

This system moves beyond device identification *and* static time-based access control.  It introduces a layer of *behavioral* authentication, verifying that the user interacting with the document is genuinely the authorized user. The escalating restriction levels provide a balance between security and usability.  A compromised account *may* still gain initial access, but anomalous behavior will trigger progressively stronger security measures. This is proactive security, not reactive.
