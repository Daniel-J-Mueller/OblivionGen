## Adaptive Data Tiering with Predictive Pre-Capture

**Concept:** Extend the data capture concept to proactively *tier* data based on predicted access patterns *before* capture, creating a multi-tiered storage system where capture acts as a final, durable archival step.  This moves beyond simply replicating for disaster recovery or inspection, and leverages prediction to optimize storage costs and access speeds.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:**  “Prediction Engine” – A module integrated into the existing control plane.
*   **Inputs:** Historical access logs for datasets, dataset metadata (size, type, creation date, modification frequency), resource utilization metrics (CPU, network, I/O), cost models for each storage tier.
*   **Outputs:**  Tier assignment for each dataset block (or granularity defined by system admin), schedule for data movement between tiers.
*   **Storage Tiers:**
    *   **Tier 0: RAM/NVMe:**  Extremely fast, expensive, for frequently accessed data blocks.
    *   **Tier 1: SSD:**  Fast, moderately expensive, for moderately accessed blocks.
    *   **Tier 2: HDD:**  Slower, inexpensive, for infrequently accessed blocks.
    *   **Tier 3: Archive (Existing Capture System):**  Slowest, cheapest, for long-term storage and audit.
*   **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```pseudocode
function predict_tier(data_block, historical_access_logs, metadata, cost_models):
    access_frequency = calculate_access_frequency(historical_access_logs, data_block)
    access_recency = calculate_access_recency(historical_access_logs, data_block)
    data_size = get_data_size(metadata, data_block)

    //Weighted scoring – adjust weights based on system priorities
    score = (0.6 * access_frequency) + (0.3 * access_recency) + (0.1 * data_size)

    if score > 0.8:
        return Tier_0  //RAM/NVMe
    else if score > 0.5:
        return Tier_1  //SSD
    else if score > 0.2:
        return Tier_2  //HDD
    else:
        return Tier_3  //Archive
```

*   **Pre-Capture Mechanism:**  Instead of just *capturing* data, the system will *move* data to lower tiers *before* the final archival capture.  The frequency of pre-tiering is configurable, and can be tied to prediction confidence levels.
*   **Adaptive Policy Management:** Capture policies become "Tiering Policies" – specifying not only capture frequency but also criteria for moving data between tiers.  Policies can be defined at the dataset level or globally.
*   **Integration with Existing System:**  The Prediction Engine leverages the existing control plane’s scheduling capabilities to orchestrate data movement. Existing capture functionality is repurposed as the final archival step (Tier 3).
*   **Resource Consideration:** The prediction engine will factor in the capacity of the tiers, and will avoid overburdening specific tiers by delaying pre-tiering of data.
