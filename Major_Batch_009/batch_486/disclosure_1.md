**Adaptive Projection with Haptic Feedback & Environmental Mapping**

**Core Concept:** Extend the multi-surface projection concept by incorporating real-time environmental mapping and haptic feedback, creating an interactive projected experience *onto* physical objects. The system projects not just images, but simulated textures and forces, overlaid onto real-world surfaces.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Projection Unit:** High-resolution, short-throw projector with integrated depth sensor (e.g., structured light or Time-of-Flight).  Capable of projecting onto irregular surfaces with automatic keystone correction and surface adaptation.  Must support high refresh rates (120Hz+) for responsive interaction.
*   **Depth Sensor:**  High-resolution depth camera (integrated into projector) for real-time 3D mapping of the environment *including* the projection surface and surrounding objects.  Range: 0.2m – 5m. Accuracy: +/- 1cm.
*   **Haptic Feedback Array:**  An array of miniature ultrasonic transducers, positioned around the projection area. These transducers create localized air pressure variations, simulating the sensation of touch on the projected surface. Transducer density: 50 per square decimeter. Frequency range: 20kHz – 40kHz.
*   **Surface Detection & Tracking:**  Combines visual data (from projector camera) and depth data to identify and track surfaces.  Utilizes machine learning algorithms to differentiate between surfaces and objects.  Must be able to handle dynamic environments (e.g., moving hands, objects).
*   **Content Generation Engine:** Software capable of generating dynamic content based on environmental data. This includes:
    *   Texture Mapping:  Projecting textures that conform to the shape of the detected surface.
    *   Force Field Generation:  Calculating and simulating force fields based on user interaction or programmed events.
    *   Procedural Content Generation: Creating dynamic visual and haptic effects based on user input or environmental conditions.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance CPU/GPU to handle real-time depth processing, content generation, and haptic feedback control.
*   **Communication Interface:** Wireless communication (Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2) for data transfer and control.
*   **Power Supply:** Internal rechargeable battery with a minimum runtime of 4 hours.

**Pseudocode (Interaction Loop):**

```
Initialize system components (projector, depth sensor, haptic array, content engine)

While (System is running)
{
    Capture depth data using depth sensor
    Process depth data to create 3D environmental map
    Identify projection surface and surrounding objects
    Detect user interaction (hand gestures, object manipulation)

    If (User interaction detected)
    {
        Calculate interaction forces
        Update content based on interaction forces and environmental map
        Project updated content onto projection surface
        Activate haptic array to simulate touch sensations
    }
    Else
    {
        Project pre-rendered or dynamically generated content onto projection surface
    }
}
```

**Applications:**

*   **Interactive Training & Simulation:**  Simulate realistic tactile experiences for training in fields like surgery, mechanics, or emergency response.
*   **Gaming & Entertainment:**  Create immersive gaming experiences with realistic tactile feedback.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide tactile information for visually impaired users, allowing them to "feel" projected images.
*   **Product Visualization:**  Allow users to virtually "touch" and interact with products before purchasing them.
*   **Remote Collaboration:** Enable remote users to interact with physical objects as if they were present in the same room.
