**Dynamic Aesthetic Drift Simulation**

**Concept:** Extend the existing attribute-based visual complementarity system with a dynamic simulation component. Instead of solely identifying static pairings, model how aesthetic preferences *shift* over time, and predict future complementarity based on evolving trends. This addresses the problem of static recommendations becoming stale and failing to account for changing tastes.

**Specs:**

1.  **Trend Data Acquisition:** Integrate external data feeds (social media, design blogs, sales data) to identify emerging aesthetic trends – color palettes, material preferences, furniture styles, spatial arrangements. This data is timestamped.
2.  **Aesthetic Drift Vectors:** Represent each identified trend as a vector in a multi-dimensional aesthetic space. Each dimension corresponds to an attribute extracted by the existing attribute extractors (e.g., color saturation, texture complexity, geometric regularity). The vector's magnitude reflects the trend’s intensity.
3.  **User Preference Profiling:**  Beyond implicit preferences (purchase history, browsing behavior), incorporate explicit user feedback through a “style evolution” interface. Users can rate images/combinations *and* indicate desired aesthetic *direction* (e.g., "more minimalist," "warmer tones"). This generates a user-specific aesthetic drift vector.
4.  **Simulation Engine:**
    *   Input: Source furniture item attributes, user aesthetic drift vector, global trend vectors.
    *   Process: Project the source item’s attributes forward in aesthetic space, influenced by both user and global drift vectors. This produces a predicted aesthetic profile for the source item at a future time.
    *   Output: A set of “future compatible” items, identified by finding items whose current attributes align with the source item’s *predicted* future aesthetic profile.

5.  **Compatibility Metric:**  Expand the existing compatibility score to include a "temporal alignment" component.  This component measures how well the predicted aesthetic trajectories of two items converge over a specified timeframe.

6.  **UI/UX Integration:** Present recommendations as "aesthetic progressions" – visual sequences showing how a room might evolve over time, incorporating predicted trend shifts.  Allow users to adjust the simulation timeframe and the relative influence of personal vs. global trends.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_future_compatibility(source_item, user_drift, global_trends, timeframe):
  source_attributes = extract_attributes(source_item)
  predicted_attributes = source_attributes + user_drift + weighted_sum(global_trends) //Vector addition, weighted by trend intensity
  
  candidate_items = all_items_in_catalog
  
  compatible_items = []
  for item in candidate_items:
    item_attributes = extract_attributes(item)
    temporal_alignment_score = calculate_trajectory_convergence(source_attributes, item_attributes, timeframe)
    compatibility_score = existing_compatibility_metric(source_attributes, item_attributes) + temporal_alignment_score
    if compatibility_score > threshold:
      compatible_items.append(item)
      
  return compatible_items
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   GPU acceleration for simulation processing.
*   Time-series database for trend data.
*   Scalable cloud infrastructure for handling simulation loads.
*   Integration with existing attribute extraction models.
