## Dynamic Directory Sharding via Predictive Load Balancing

**Specification:** Implement a system for proactively sharding a network directory based on *predicted* user access patterns, not just reactive load. This goes beyond simply adding domain controllers to handle geographic regions.

**Core Concept:** Utilize machine learning models to predict future access hotspots within the directory.  Instead of waiting for performance degradation, the system *preemptively* divides the directory into shards and assigns them to domain controllers.  These shards aren’t necessarily geographic; they’re based on access patterns – for example, a shard could contain all user objects frequently accessed by a specific application, regardless of location.

**Components:**

1.  **Access Pattern Analyzer:**
    *   Continuously monitors directory access logs (authentication, authorization, attribute reads/writes).
    *   Employs time series analysis and machine learning algorithms (e.g., LSTM networks, ARIMA models) to predict future access patterns.
    *   Identifies potential hotspots – sections of the directory expected to experience high load.
    *   Outputs a “Sharding Recommendation” – a proposed directory division based on predicted access.

2.  **Dynamic Sharder:**
    *   Receives Sharding Recommendations from the Access Pattern Analyzer.
    *   Implements the recommended directory division by creating new shards and assigning them to domain controllers.
    *   Uses a consistent hashing algorithm to ensure minimal disruption during sharding – objects are moved between shards only when the sharding scheme changes.
    *   Supports “shadowing” – temporarily duplicating data in the new shard before fully committing to the change, to ensure data integrity and minimize downtime.

3.  **Resource Orchestrator:**
    *   Monitors domain controller resource usage (CPU, memory, network I/O).
    *   Automatically scales resources up or down based on load.
    *   Can provision new domain controllers on demand.
    *   Optimizes shard placement to minimize inter-shard communication.

4.  **Client Resolver:**
    *   Intercepts directory access requests from clients.
    *   Determines the appropriate shard to handle the request based on the object being accessed.
    *   Routes the request to the corresponding domain controller.
    *   Uses a caching mechanism to reduce latency and improve performance.

**Pseudocode (Client Resolver):**

```
function resolveRequest(request):
  objectType = request.objectType
  objectId = request.objectId
  shardKey = hash(objectId) //Consistent hashing
  shardId = shardKey % numberOfShards
  domainController = shardToDomainControllerMap[shardId]
  forwardRequest(request, domainController)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `shardToDomainControllerMap`:  A map associating shard IDs with domain controller addresses.
*   `accessLogs`: Time-stamped records of directory access events.
*   `predictedAccessPatterns`:  Output of the Access Pattern Analyzer – predicted access rates for each shard.

**Novelty:** Existing systems react to load. This system *predicts* load and proactively adjusts the directory structure. Sharding is not tied to geography, but to access patterns, allowing for more granular and efficient scaling.  The use of machine learning for proactive sharding is a key differentiator.
