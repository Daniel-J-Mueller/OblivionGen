## Dynamic Resolution Stitching with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the existing pipeline to seamlessly blend content delivered at multiple resolutions, dynamically adjusting based on network conditions and device capabilities *before* it reaches the rendering thread. This is achieved through a predictive buffering system that anticipates resolution switches and prepares frames accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Resolution Analysis Module (New Thread - operates *before* the first thread in the existing pipeline):**

    *   **Input:** Live video stream metadata (available resolutions, current bandwidth estimates).
    *   **Process:** Continuously analyze network bandwidth and device rendering capabilities. Maintain a dynamic resolution profile (preferred resolutions, acceptable ranges).
    *   **Output:** Resolution switch requests (resolution ID, timing offset).  These requests are transmitted to the Frame Acquisition & Stitching Module.

**2.  Frame Acquisition & Stitching Module (Inserts between the First and Second Threads):**

    *   **Input:** Content from the First Buffer Queue (parsed video frames), Resolution Switch Requests.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Maintain multiple buffer queues (one for each supported resolution).
        *   Fetch and decode frames for *multiple* resolutions concurrently, utilizing spare processing power.
        *   Implement a frame stitching algorithm:
            *   Identify regions within frames suitable for resolution blending (e.g., static backgrounds).
            *   Smoothly transition between resolutions *before* rendering.
            *   Employ spatial and temporal anti-aliasing to minimize blending artifacts.
        *   Prioritize stitching based on predicted network fluctuations.  If a bandwidth drop is anticipated, proactively stitch lower-resolution frames.
    *   **Output:**  A stitched frame stream to the Second Buffer Queue.

**3.  Predictive Buffering System (Integrated with Frame Acquisition & Stitching):**

    *   **Function:**  Anticipate resolution switches based on historical data, network predictions, and content analysis.
    *   **Algorithm:**
        *   Time Series Analysis: Track historical bandwidth fluctuations.
        *   Content Analysis: Identify scenes with high or low complexity (impact bandwidth requirements).
        *   Predictive Model: Train a machine learning model to predict bandwidth availability and optimal resolution.
    *   **Implementation:** Implement a prioritized buffer system. Higher priority is given to frames likely to be needed in the near future.

**4.  Rendering Thread Modification:**

    *   The Rendering Thread remains largely unchanged, receiving a consistent stream of pre-stitched frames.
    *   Add a quality metric monitoring component to assess the effectiveness of the stitching algorithm. (For feedback loop)

**Pseudocode (Frame Acquisition & Stitching):**

```
function processFrames():
  while (true):
    frame = getFrameFromFirstQueue()
    resolutionSwitchRequest = checkResolutionSwitchRequest()

    if (resolutionSwitchRequest):
      targetResolution = resolutionSwitchRequest.resolutionID
      preFetchFrames(targetResolution)  //Load upcoming frames

    stitchedFrame = stitchFrame(frame, preFetchedFrames, targetResolution)
    putStitchedFrameIntoSecondQueue(stitchedFrame)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires significant processing power for parallel frame decoding and stitching. (GPU acceleration recommended)
*   Machine learning model training requires large datasets of network conditions and content characteristics.
*   Optimized memory management is crucial for handling multiple frame buffers.

**Novelty:**

Existing adaptive bitrate streaming solutions switch between entire video streams. This system proposes a more granular approach â€“ blending resolutions *within* a frame to achieve a smoother and more responsive viewing experience. The predictive buffering system anticipates bandwidth fluctuations and proactively prepares frames, minimizing latency and buffering artifacts.
