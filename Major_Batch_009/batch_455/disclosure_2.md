## Secure Credential Delegation with Ephemeral Access Graphs

**Specification:** A system for dynamically constructing and managing access permissions via ephemeral, cryptographically-sealed access graphs. This builds on the concept of credential translation but moves beyond static tables to a fluid, real-time permission structure.

**Core Concept:** Instead of a fixed translation table linking frontend to backend credentials, we create a directed graph where nodes represent services/resources and edges represent permitted access.  Access is granted not by direct credential sharing, but by a cryptographic “seal” applied to the edge of the graph.  This seal is valid for a limited time and can only be unlocked by the frontend credential.

**Components:**

1.  **Access Graph Builder (AGB):**  A service responsible for constructing the access graph.  Policy rules (potentially defined via a visual interface) dictate the initial graph structure.  The AGB doesn’t *store* credentials; it defines *relationships* between services.

2.  **Credential Seal Service (CSS):** This service takes a request (Frontend Credential, Target Service, Operation) and generates a cryptographically sealed access token (SAT). The SAT is valid for a short duration and can only be decrypted using the Frontend Credential's private key. The SAT *does not* contain backend credentials. It’s a proof of authorization, not a credential itself.

3.  **Backend Service Gateway (BSG):** This is the entry point for backend services. It receives the SAT from the client.  It verifies the SAT's signature using the *public* key associated with the frontend credential. Upon successful verification, it consults a local policy engine (rules specific to that backend service) to determine if the requested operation is allowed *given* the validated authorization.  If allowed, the BSG performs the operation.

**Workflow:**

1.  Client requests access to a backend service.
2.  Client sends Frontend Credential to CSS to request a SAT for the target service/operation.
3.  CSS generates and returns the SAT.
4.  Client presents the SAT to the BSG.
5.  BSG verifies the SAT signature.
6.  BSG enforces local policy and allows/denies access.

**Pseudocode (CSS - Generate SAT):**

```
function generateSAT(frontendCredential, targetService, operation, validityDuration):
  // 1. Create a unique request ID
  requestID = generateUUID()

  // 2. Timestamp the request
  timestamp = getCurrentTime()

  // 3. Construct the authorization statement
  authStatement = "Allow " + frontendCredential + " to " + operation + " on " + targetService + " @ " + timestamp + " (ID: " + requestID + ")"

  // 4. Sign the authorization statement with the backend service’s private key.
  signedStatement = sign(authStatement, backendPrivateKey)

  // 5. Encrypt the signed statement using the frontend credential’s public key.
  encryptedSAT = encrypt(signedStatement, frontendPublicKey)

  // 6. Set the expiry time on the encrypted SAT
  setExpiry(encryptedSAT, validityDuration)

  return encryptedSAT
```

**Pseudocode (BSG - Verify & Authorize):**

```
function authorizeRequest(sat, requestDetails):
  // 1. Verify SAT expiry
  if (isExpired(sat)):
    return "Authorization Failed: SAT Expired"

  // 2. Decrypt the SAT using the frontend credential’s public key.
  decryptedStatement = decrypt(sat, frontendPublicKey)

  // 3. Verify the signature of the decrypted statement using the backend service’s public key.
  if (verifySignature(decryptedStatement, backendPublicKey) == false):
    return "Authorization Failed: Invalid Signature"

  // 4. Enforce local policy based on the decrypted statement and request details
  if (enforcePolicy(decryptedStatement, requestDetails)):
    return "Authorized"
  else:
    return "Authorization Failed: Policy Violation"
```

**Innovation:**

This system significantly reduces the attack surface compared to credential translation.  Backend credentials are *never* exposed. Authorization is time-bound and verifiable. The ephemeral nature of the access graph makes it difficult for attackers to maintain long-term access even if they compromise a single node.  The system also allows for fine-grained access control based on operation and timestamp.
