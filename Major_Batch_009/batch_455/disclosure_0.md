## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping via Light Field Projection

**Core Concept:** Extend the light element functionality beyond simple visual cues to create a dynamic, spatially-mapped acoustic environment for improved beamforming and echo cancellation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Element Light Array:** Replace the existing "one or more light elements" with a high-density array of individually addressable micro-projectors capable of projecting complex light *fields* - not just color/intensity, but structured light patterns. Resolution: minimum 100x100 elements.
*   **Time-of-Flight Sensor Array:** Integrate a low-latency Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor array, co-located with the light array. Resolution: minimum 100x100 sensors, synchronized with light array.
*   **Microphone Array (Enhanced):** Maintain the dual-microphone setup, but increase the sampling rate to at least 96kHz for more accurate spatial analysis.
*   **Processing Unit (Dedicated):** A dedicated processor core with optimized algorithms for real-time light field processing, ToF data analysis, and advanced beamforming.

**2. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Light Field Projection Module:** This module controls the micro-projector array. It allows for the projection of:
    *   **Structured Light Patterns:**  Projection of rapidly changing patterns (e.g., sine waves, checkerboards) to create a 3D map of the immediate environment.
    *   **Acoustic Shadows:** Projection of light patterns designed to *absorb* or redirect sound waves in specific directions, creating "acoustic shadows."
    *   **Virtual Sound Source Projection:**  Projection of light patterns that mimic the perceived location of a virtual sound source, enhancing the sense of directionality.
*   **ToF Data Processing Module:** Processes the data from the ToF sensors to build a real-time 3D point cloud of the environment. This point cloud is used to:
    *   Identify reflective surfaces (walls, furniture, etc.).
    *   Calculate the distance to these surfaces.
    *   Detect moving objects.
*   **Adaptive Beamforming Module:**  This module takes data from the ToF sensors, the 3D point cloud, and the microphone array to dynamically adjust the beamforming parameters.
    *   **Reflective Surface Compensation:** The beamformer actively steers nulls in the direction of detected reflective surfaces, minimizing echo and reverberation.
    *   **Dynamic Beam Steering:** The beamformer dynamically steers the beam towards the detected speaker, even if the speaker is moving.
    *   **Acoustic Shadow Enhancement:**  The beamformer leverages the projected acoustic shadows to further focus the beam and reduce noise.
*   **Echo Cancellation Enhancement Module:** This module enhances the existing AEC by utilizing the 3D map generated from ToF data to better predict and cancel echoes.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Environment Mapping:** The system continuously projects structured light patterns and analyzes the reflected patterns using the ToF sensors to build a real-time 3D map of the environment.
2.  **Reflective Surface Detection:** The system identifies reflective surfaces and calculates their distance and angle from the microphones.
3.  **Acoustic Shadow Creation:** Based on the detected reflective surfaces, the system projects acoustic shadows to redirect or absorb sound waves.
4.  **Adaptive Beamforming:** The system dynamically adjusts the beamforming parameters to focus on the detected speaker and minimize echo and reverberation.
5.  **Echo Cancellation:** The system uses the adaptive beamforming data and the 3D map to enhance the existing AEC.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Environment Mapping & Surface Detection
  map = generate3DMap(lightArray, ToFsensors);
  surfaces = detectReflectiveSurfaces(map);

  // 2. Acoustic Shadow Creation
  createAcousticShadows(lightArray, surfaces);

  // 3. Adaptive Beamforming
  beamformData = processMicrophoneData(microphoneArray);
  adaptiveBeamform(beamformData, surfaces);

  // 4. Enhanced Echo Cancellation
  echoCanceledData = enhancedEchoCancellation(beamformData, surfaces);
}
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple visual cues and creates a *dynamic, spatially-mapped acoustic environment* that actively manipulates sound waves to improve beamforming and echo cancellation. The integration of light field projection with ToF sensing allows for a much more precise and adaptable acoustic experience. This has potential applications beyond voice control, such as immersive audio and augmented reality.
