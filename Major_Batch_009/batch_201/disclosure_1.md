## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Composition

**Concept:** Expand beyond 2D composition assistance to enable *reconstruction* of a simplified 3D scene model and *predictive* composition guidance based on anticipated user movement and subject behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. 3D Scene Capture & Modeling Module:**

*   **Input:** Continuous video stream from image capturing device.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ Structure from Motion (SfM) and/or monocular depth estimation techniques to generate a sparse or dense 3D point cloud representing the scene.  Prioritize speed over absolute accuracy – a “sketchy” 3D model is sufficient.
    *   Semantic segmentation of the 3D point cloud to identify objects (people, furniture, walls, etc.).  Utilize a pre-trained model fine-tuned for common indoor/outdoor scenes.
    *   Object tracking to maintain object IDs and positions across frames.
*   **Output:** A dynamic 3D scene model represented as a list of tracked objects with positions, orientations, and semantic labels.

**2. Behavior Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** 3D Scene Model (from above), historical trajectory data for tracked objects.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the future trajectory of moving objects.  Models trained on datasets of human and animal movement patterns.
    *   Probabilistic modeling of object interactions (e.g., two people approaching each other).
    *   Consider environmental constraints (walls, furniture) when predicting trajectories.
*   **Output:**  Probabilistic predictions of future object positions over a short time horizon (e.g., 1-3 seconds).

**3. Predictive Composition Guidance Module:**

*   **Input:** 3D Scene Model, Behavior Predictions, Composition Templates.
*   **Process:**
    *   Simulate potential future camera views based on predicted object positions.
    *   Evaluate each simulated view against a set of composition templates (Rule of Thirds, Leading Lines, Symmetry, etc.).
    *   Assign a score to each composition based on the template match and predicted subject visibility.
    *   Select the composition with the highest score.
    *   Generate a combination of visual and auditory cues to guide the user to achieve the selected composition *before* the predicted event occurs.
*   **Output:**
    *   Real-time visual overlays on the camera preview, showing the optimal framing for the predicted scene.
    *   Auditory cues (e.g., “Slightly pan left”, “Move closer”, “Wait for the subject to turn”).
    *   Haptic feedback (e.g., gentle vibrations to indicate optimal movement direction).

**4. User Interaction & Feedback Loop:**

*   Capture user responses to the guidance cues (voice commands, physical movement).
*   Adjust the behavior prediction and composition guidance based on user actions.
*   Over time, the system learns to better anticipate user intent and provide more relevant guidance.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
while (camera is active):
  scene_model = capture_3d_scene()
  behavior_predictions = predict_behavior(scene_model)
  best_composition = find_best_composition(scene_model, behavior_predictions)
  guidance_cues = generate_guidance(best_composition)
  display_guidance(guidance_cues)
  user_response = capture_user_response()
  update_model(user_response)
```

**Novelty:** This extends 2D composition assistance into a proactive, 3D-aware system that anticipates user actions and guides them *before* the moment of capture, rather than reacting to existing conditions. It moves beyond simple adjustments to a predictive framing assistant. This isn't just about "move left" – it's about preparing for a dynamic event.
