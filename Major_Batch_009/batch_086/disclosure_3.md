## Sentiment-Driven Dynamic Item Categorization

**Concept:** Extend the negative sentiment identification to *dynamically* reshape item categories based on aggregated user reactions. Instead of merely filtering/downranking items *within* existing categories, the system proactively identifies emerging negative sentiment clusters and creates new, temporary "avoidance categories" or sub-categories.

**Specification:**

1.  **Sentiment Aggregation Module:**
    *   Continuously monitor user interactions (explicit feedback, dwell time, click-through rates, purchase history) across all catalog items.
    *   Utilize natural language processing (NLP) to analyze user-generated content (reviews, comments, social media mentions) associated with items.
    *   Assign sentiment scores to each item based on aggregated data.
2.  **Clustering Algorithm:**
    *   Employ a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) to group items exhibiting similar negative sentiment patterns. Key features for clustering:
        *   Keywords associated with negative sentiment.
        *   Specific attributes driving negative reactions.
        *   User demographics exhibiting the negative sentiment.
    *   Define thresholds for cluster creation based on:
        *   Cluster size (minimum number of items).
        *   Sentiment score (average negativity).
        *   Statistical significance.
3.  **Dynamic Category Generation:**
    *   When a cluster meets the defined thresholds, automatically create a temporary category or sub-category (e.g., "Items associated with recent user complaints regarding material quality", "Potentially triggering content - user flagged").
    *   Assign items within the cluster to this new category.
4.  **Recommendation Engine Integration:**
    *   Modify the recommendation engine to:
        *   Avoid recommending items from newly created categories to users demonstrating affinity to the negative sentiment that triggered the category creation.
        *   Present options to users to *actively* exclude items from specific dynamic categories ("Exclude items flagged for potentially triggering content").
        *   Highlight the rationale behind category creation to build user trust and transparency. ("This category was created based on recent user feedback regarding X.")
5. **Category Decay & Analysis**:
    * Implement a time-based decay function for dynamic categories. After a set period (e.g., 30 days) without consistent negative sentiment, the category is dissolved, and items are reassigned to their original categories.
    * Regularly analyze the characteristics of dissolved categories to identify underlying product issues or areas for improvement.
6. **Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION ProcessUserInteraction(user, item, interactionType, interactionData):
    sentimentScore = CalculateSentimentScore(interactionData)
    UpdateItemSentiment(item, sentimentScore)
    PerformClustering()

FUNCTION PerformClustering():
    items = GetItemsWithRecentInteractions()
    clusters = ApplyClusteringAlgorithm(items)
    FOR cluster IN clusters:
        IF ClusterMeetsThreshold(cluster):
            CreateDynamicCategory(cluster)

FUNCTION CreateDynamicCategory(cluster):
    categoryName = "Negative Sentiment Cluster - " + GetTimestamp()
    categoryItems = GetItemsFromCluster(cluster)
    AddItemsToCategory(categoryItems, categoryName)
    UpdateRecommendationEngine(categoryName)

FUNCTION UpdateRecommendationEngine(categoryName):
    AddCategoryToExclusionList(categoryName)
    EnableUserControl(categoryName)
```

**Potential Benefits:**  Proactive identification of emerging issues, more nuanced personalization, improved user experience, and valuable insights for product development.
