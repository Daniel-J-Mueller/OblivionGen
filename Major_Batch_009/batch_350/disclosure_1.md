## Dynamic Procedural Detail Generation

**Concept:** Extend the real-time manipulation of objects within the video to *procedurally generate* missing or enhanced detail *during* the paused/streaming phase, based on user interaction and pre-defined rules. This moves beyond simply re-rendering existing model data to creating *new* visual information.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A procedural detail generator module integrated into the RVE system. This module houses a library of procedural generation algorithms (noise functions, rule-based systems, L-systems, etc.) tailored to common object types (vehicles, furniture, architecture, etc.).
*   **Interaction Trigger:** When a user interacts with an object (zoom, rotate, component selection), the RVE system analyzes the interaction type and the object's semantic category.
*   **Detail Request:** This triggers a "detail request" to the procedural detail generator. The request includes:
    *   Object semantic category (e.g., "car," "wooden chair," "brick wall")
    *   Interaction type (e.g., "zoom on engine," "rotate chair leg," "inspect wall texture")
    *   Current view parameters (camera position, angle)
    *   Existing model data (access to the manipulated model)
*   **Procedural Generation:** The procedural detail generator selects appropriate algorithms and parameters to generate new geometric and textural details. Examples:
    *   **Zoom on Car Engine:** Generate detailed engine components (wiring harnesses, fluid lines, individual bolts) that werenâ€™t present in the original model.
    *   **Rotate Chair Leg:**  Generate wear and tear patterns (scratches, dents, wood grain variations) dynamically on the rotating surface.
    *   **Inspect Wall Texture:** Generate micro-details on the brick texture (mortar irregularities, individual brick imperfections, weathering effects).
*   **Seamless Integration:** The generated details are blended seamlessly with the existing model data in real-time, creating a more immersive and detailed visual experience.  This requires careful handling of lighting, shading, and texture mapping.
*   **Data Streaming:**  The generated details are streamed to the client device alongside the manipulated model, maintaining a consistent and fluid experience. Compression and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques are used to optimize streaming performance.
*   **Rule-Based Control:**  A rule engine governs the procedural generation process. Rules define the types of details generated, their level of complexity, and their stylistic consistency with the original video content.  Rules can be customized per object type or even per specific scene.
*   **AI-Assisted Generation:** Integrate a machine learning model trained on a dataset of detailed 3D models to guide the procedural generation process. This model can predict the types of details that are most likely to be present on a given object, based on its semantic category and current interaction context.
*   **Caching System:** Implement a caching system to store frequently generated details. This can significantly reduce the computational load and improve performance, especially for common object types and interactions.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function HandleObjectInteraction(interactionType, objectCategory, objectModel) {
  detailRequest = createDetailRequest(interactionType, objectCategory, objectModel);
  generatedDetails = proceduralDetailGenerator.generateDetails(detailRequest);

  // Blend generated details with objectModel
  enhancedObjectModel = blendDetails(objectModel, generatedDetails);

  streamToClient(enhancedObjectModel);
}

function proceduralDetailGenerator.generateDetails(detailRequest) {
  if (detailRequest.interactionType == "zoom") {
    // Generate high-resolution details for zoomed area
    details = generateMicroDetails(detailRequest.objectCategory);
  } else if (detailRequest.interactionType == "rotate") {
    // Generate dynamic surface details
    details = generateDynamicDetails(detailRequest.objectCategory);
  }
  return details;
}
```

This system moves beyond simple model manipulation to *creation* of detail, enabling a truly dynamic and immersive video exploration experience. It offers significant potential for enhancing realism and engagement, and opens up new possibilities for interactive storytelling and virtual experiences.
