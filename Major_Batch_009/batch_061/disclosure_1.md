## Dynamic Journal Sharding & Predictive Flushing

**Concept:** Extend the selective flushing concept by introducing dynamic sharding of the database journal based on request type *and* predicted user interaction. This anticipates future actions and proactively prepares the database for likely scenarios, minimizing latency even *before* the user initiates them.

**Specs:**

**1. Journal Sharding Logic:**

*   **Sharding Keys:**  Journal entries are sharded based on two primary keys:
    *   `Request Type`:  (Create, Modify, Delete) – as per the provided patent.
    *   `Interaction Prediction Score`:  A value (0.0 – 1.0) representing the likelihood of the user interacting with records affected by the request *soon*.
*   **Prediction Engine:**  A separate module (built via ML) assesses `Interaction Prediction Score` based on:
    *   User history (past access patterns).
    *   Record attributes (e.g., recent modification, importance tags).
    *   Time-based decay (recent activity boosts the score).
    *   Collaborative filtering (similar users’ behavior).
*   **Shard Types:**
    *   `High-Interaction Shard`: (Score > 0.7) – Entries likely to be immediately accessed. These are kept in fast storage (RAM/SSD).
    *   `Medium-Interaction Shard`: (Score 0.3 – 0.7) –  Stored on SSD.
    *   `Low-Interaction Shard`: (Score < 0.3) – Stored on HDD/Object Storage.

**2. Flushing Algorithm:**

*   **Non-Interactive Mode:**
    *   Flush *only* Create & Delete entries in the Low & Medium shards.
    *   Defer Modify entries – even in Medium shards.
    *   Completely bypass the High-Interaction Shard for any flushing.
*   **Interactive Mode:**
    *   Flush all shards.
    *   Prioritize High-Interaction Shard for immediate updates.

**3.  Adaptive Shard Management:**

*   **Shard Splitting/Merging:** Dynamically split or merge shards based on load and access patterns.
*   **Shard Migration:**  Move entries between shards based on changing `Interaction Prediction Score`.
*   **Hot/Cold Data Separation:**  Ensure frequently accessed records reside in faster storage tiers.

**4.  Pseudocode - Flushing Process (Simplified):**

```
function flushJournal(mode, journalEntry) {
  interactionScore = getInteractionScore(journalEntry);
  shardType = determineShardType(interactionScore);

  if (mode == "non-interactive") {
    if (shardType == "High") {
      //Do nothing - Skip this entry
      return;
    }

    if (journalEntry.type == "Create" || journalEntry.type == "Delete") {
      //Process and flush
      applyJournalEntry(journalEntry);
      removeJournalEntry(journalEntry);
    } else {
      //Defer processing
      markJournalEntryForLaterProcessing(journalEntry);
    }
  } else { //Interactive Mode
    applyJournalEntry(journalEntry);
    removeJournalEntry(journalEntry);
  }
}
```

**5.  Data Structures:**

*   `JournalEntry`: {`type`: ("Create", "Modify", "Delete"), `recordId`, `data`, `interactionPredictionScore`}
*   `Shard`: {`shardType`, `entries`}

**Innovation:**  This isn’t just selective flushing; it's *predictive* flushing. By anticipating user interaction, the system proactively prepares the database, reducing latency and improving the user experience, especially in non-interactive scenarios.  The dynamic sharding component adds flexibility and allows the system to adapt to changing workloads.
