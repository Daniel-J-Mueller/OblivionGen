## Distributed Haptic Feedback System for Voice Command Confirmation

**Concept:** Extend the distributed voice assistant network to incorporate localized haptic feedback, providing a more intuitive and reassuring confirmation of voice commands. This goes beyond simple audio confirmations and aims to create a more immersive and physically grounded user experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Types:**
    *   **Primary Assistant (PA):** As described in the patent - Microphone, Speakers, Processors, Computer-Readable Media. *Adds:* Haptic Actuator Array (HAA) – Small, low-power array of vibrotactile elements embedded within the housing. Array resolution: 8x8. Frequency range: 10Hz-250Hz. Amplitude control: 0-100%.
    *   **Secondary Assistant (SA):** Similar to PA, but *lacks* speakers. *Adds:* Haptic Actuator Array (HAA) – identical to PA’s HAA, positioned for proximity feedback.
    *   **User Wearable (UW):** Optional wrist-worn or clip-on device with a single, high-precision haptic actuator.

*   **System Architecture:**
    *   The PA acts as the central coordinator for voice command processing *and* haptic feedback distribution.
    *   SA units are networked wirelessly (Bluetooth Low Energy preferred) and contribute to ambient haptic confirmations.
    *   UW provides personalized, discrete feedback to the user.

*   **Haptic Feedback Mapping:**
    *   **Command Confirmation:** Short, localized pulse on the PA’s HAA, coinciding with the audio confirmation.  Pulse duration: 50ms. Pulse frequency: 120Hz. Amplitude: 60%.
    *   **Contextual Feedback:**  More complex haptic patterns indicating command status. Example: “Searching…” - Slow, sweeping pattern across the PA’s HAA.  "Error" - Rapid, staccato pulses.
    *   **Spatial Audio/Haptics Correlation:** If a voice command references a physical location (e.g., "Turn on the lights in the kitchen"), the SA unit closest to that location activates a corresponding haptic pattern.
    *   **Personalized Feedback (UW):** The user can customize haptic patterns for specific commands or applications via a companion app.

*   **Algorithm/Pseudocode (PA):**

    ```
    ON VoiceCommandReceived:
        audioData = CaptureAudio()
        confidenceLevel = AnalyzeAudio(audioData)

        IF confidenceLevel > threshold:
            command = ProcessVoiceCommand(audioData)
            PerformAction(command)

            //Haptic Feedback Distribution
            HapticPattern = GetHapticPattern(command)
            ActivateHAA(HapticPattern) // On Primary Assistant
            BroadcastHapticCommand(HapticPattern) // To Secondary Assistants

            IF UserWearableConnected:
                SendHapticPatternToUW(HapticPattern)
        ELSE:
            //Indicate Command Not Recognized with Subtle Haptic Feedback
            ActivateHAA(Pattern = "SoftPulse")
    ```

*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   SA units communicate with the PA via a low-latency wireless protocol.
    *   Data packets include command type, haptic pattern, and intensity level.
    *   The PA dynamically adjusts the intensity of haptic feedback based on ambient noise levels and user preferences.

*   **Power Management:**
    *   Haptic actuators are low-power.
    *   The system utilizes adaptive power management to minimize energy consumption.
    *   SA units can enter a sleep mode when inactive.

*   **Materials:**
    *   HAA elements constructed from piezoelectric materials or micro-motors.
    *   Housing materials chosen for acoustic transparency and haptic conductivity.
