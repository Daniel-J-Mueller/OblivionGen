## Dynamic Swarm Coordination for Distributed Power Harvesting & Delivery

**Concept:** Extend the single UAV power harvesting model to a dynamic, self-organizing swarm of smaller, specialized UAVs. These UAVs would collaboratively harvest power from multiple overhead lines simultaneously and distribute it to a central receiving station or directly to ground-based devices.

**Specifications:**

**1. UAV Types:**

*   **Harvester Units (HU):** Small, highly maneuverable UAVs equipped with miniature induction coils optimized for harvesting energy from overhead power lines. Each HU possesses limited onboard storage and minimal processing capabilities. Target weight: 50g.
*   **Relay Units (RU):** Medium-sized UAVs with larger battery capacity and short-range communication capabilities. These units receive harvested energy from HUs and relay it towards the central station. Target weight: 200g.
*   **Central Station (CS):** A stationary or slowly moving platform capable of receiving power from multiple RUs and distributing it to a grid or end-users.

**2. Swarm Coordination System:**

*   **Decentralized Algorithm:** Employ a biologically-inspired algorithm (e.g., particle swarm optimization) for dynamic task allocation and route planning. No central controller.
*   **Proximity-Based Communication:** UAVs communicate with neighbors via short-range radio frequency (RF) signals. Data exchanged includes:
    *   Energy Harvest Rate
    *   Battery Level
    *   Estimated Distance to CS
    *   Obstacle Detection
*   **Dynamic Task Assignment:**
    *   HUs autonomously navigate to optimal harvesting positions along overhead lines.
    *   HUs periodically broadcast their energy harvest rate.
    *   RUs assess the energy availability of nearby HUs and form dynamic "energy chains" to relay power efficiently.
    *   RUs autonomously adjust their routes to optimize energy delivery to the CS.

**3. Power Transfer Mechanism:**

*   **Wireless Power Transfer (WPT):** Utilize resonant inductive coupling for short-range power transfer between HUs and RUs, and between RUs and the CS.
*   **Optimized Coil Design:** Miniature, high-efficiency induction coils tuned to the frequency of the power lines.
*   **Dynamic Frequency Adjustment:** The swarm dynamically adjusts the WPT frequency to minimize interference and maximize energy transfer.

**4. Safety & Redundancy:**

*   **Obstacle Avoidance System:** Each UAV is equipped with LiDAR or ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and avoidance.
*   **Failover Mechanism:** If a UAV fails, neighboring UAVs automatically re-route power and maintain system functionality.
*   **Geofencing:** Implement geofencing to restrict UAV operation to designated areas and prevent collisions with infrastructure.

**5. Pseudocode (RU Task Allocation):**

```
// Relay Unit (RU) Algorithm

while (true) {
    // Scan for nearby Harvester Units (HUs)
    nearbyHUs = scanForHUs();

    // Calculate energy potential from each HU (energy rate * distance)
    for each (HU in nearbyHUs) {
        energyPotential[HU] = HU.energyRate * calculateDistance(RU, HU);
    }

    // Select HU with highest energy potential
    bestHU = selectBestHU(energyPotential);

    // Navigate to bestHU
    navigateTo(bestHU);

    // Receive power from bestHU via WPT
    receivePower(bestHU);

    // Navigate towards Central Station (CS)
    navigateTo(CS);

    // Transmit received power to CS via WPT
    transmitPower(CS);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Emergency power delivery to remote areas.
*   Continuous power supply for sensors and IoT devices.
*   Mobile charging stations for electric vehicles.
*   Distributed energy resource management.
