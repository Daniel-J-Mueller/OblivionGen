## Adaptive Authentication Weighting System

**Concept:** Expand the layered authentication concept to dynamically adjust the 'weight' or importance of each authentication layer based on real-time threat intelligence and user behavior. This moves beyond a static layered approach to a fluid, responsive system.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Threat Intelligence Integration:**
    *   Interface with multiple external threat intelligence feeds (IP reputation, malware signatures, known attack patterns, compromised credential databases).
    *   Real-time ingestion and processing of threat data.
    *   Mapping of threat indicators to authentication layer weights.  For example, a detected brute-force attack originating from a known malicious IP range *immediately* increases the weight of the first authentication layer (e.g., requiring stronger credential verification or multi-factor authentication) and potentially bypasses subsequent layers if the initial check fails.

2.  **User Behavior Analytics (UBA):**
    *   Continuous monitoring of user access patterns (time of day, location, device, resource accessed, typical behavior).
    *   Establishment of baseline profiles for each user.
    *   Anomaly detection algorithms to identify deviations from established baselines. Deviations trigger weight adjustments. (e.g. User typically accesses resources from the US, but a login attempt originates from Russia - increased weight on location verification, potentially triggering MFA).

3.  **Dynamic Weight Assignment:**
    *   Each authentication layer is assigned a numerical weight.
    *   A scoring system calculates an overall authentication score based on the weights and the results of each layer.
    *   The system dynamically adjusts weights based on threat intelligence, UBA, and historical authentication data.
    *   Weight adjustments are granular and can affect specific users, groups, resources, or access patterns.

4.  **Authentication Layer Prioritization:**
    *   The system prioritizes authentication layers based on their current weights and the associated risk levels.
    *   Layers with higher weights are executed first, allowing for early detection and prevention of malicious activity.
    *   If a layer fails, the system can either deny access immediately or proceed to subsequent layers based on pre-defined policies.

5.  **Adaptive Challenge Response:**
    *   Based on the authentication score and risk level, the system can dynamically adjust the challenge response required from the user.
    *   Low-risk users might only require a simple password authentication.
    *   High-risk users might be required to complete multiple MFA challenges, provide biometric authentication, or undergo a behavioral analysis assessment.

6.  **Pseudocode (Weight Adjustment Logic):**

```
// Variables
user_risk_score = calculate_user_risk_score() //Based on UBA and threat intel
layer1_weight = 50
layer2_weight = 30
layer3_weight = 20

// Risk-based weight adjustments
IF user_risk_score > 80 THEN
  layer1_weight = 80
  layer2_weight = 15
  layer3_weight = 5
ELSE IF user_risk_score > 50 THEN
  layer1_weight = 60
  layer2_weight = 25
  layer3_weight = 15
ELSE
  //Default weights (as defined initially)

//Threat intel adjustments (example: known malicious IP)
IF source_IP IN blacklisted_IPs THEN
  layer1_weight = 90
  layer2_weight = 5
  layer3_weight = 5

//Total authentication score calculation
total_score = (layer1_result * layer1_weight) + (layer2_result * layer2_weight) + (layer3_result * layer3_weight)

IF total_score >= threshold THEN
  grant_access()
ELSE
  deny_access()
```

7. **Implementation Details:**

   *   Utilize a microservices architecture for scalability and flexibility.
   *   Employ a distributed caching system (e.g., Redis) for storing user profiles, threat intelligence data, and authentication weights.
   *   Leverage machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection and risk scoring.
   *   Provide a central management console for administrators to configure policies, monitor authentication activity, and fine-tune weight adjustments.
