**Automated, Modular Conveyance System with Dynamic Light-Field Obstruction Mapping**

**System Overview:**

A fully automated conveyance system designed for highly dynamic environments. This builds upon the light curtain concept but expands it to provide real-time 3D obstruction mapping and intelligent pathing for modular conveyance units. The core innovation lies in transforming the light curtain from a simple detection system into an active sensing system capable of building a volumetric understanding of surrounding obstacles.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Conveyance Units (CUs):** Modular, self-propelled platforms approximately 60cm x 40cm x 20cm. Each CU is equipped with omnidirectional wheels, a high-torque electric motor, and a robust chassis capable of carrying up to 50kg. Each CU has a standardized docking interface for securing payloads.
*   **Light-Field Emitters (LFEs):** Arrays of micro-projectors capable of emitting structured light patterns (e.g., coded light, line sweeps). These are mounted on fixed locations along the conveyance path and on the CUs themselves for redundancy and close-range obstacle detection. Each LFE has a minimum resolution of 640x480 pixels.
*   **High-Speed Depth Cameras:** Multiple cameras (minimum 3 per LFE array) with a frame rate of at least 60fps. These are calibrated to the LFEs and capture the reflected light patterns. Cameras have a minimum resolution of 1280x720.
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** A high-performance server cluster responsible for processing the depth data, building the 3D map, and calculating optimal paths for the CUs. The CPU needs to handle data from dozens of LFEs and depth cameras in real time.
*   **Wireless Communication Network:** A dedicated, low-latency wireless network (e.g., 802.11ax or 5G) for communication between the CUs, LFEs, and CPU.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Light-Field Mapping Module:**
    *   Emits structured light patterns from LFEs.
    *   Captures reflected light patterns using depth cameras.
    *   Calculates depth information from the captured patterns.
    *   Combines depth data from multiple LFEs to create a dense 3D point cloud of the environment.
2.  **Obstacle Detection & Classification Module:**
    *   Filters noise and outliers from the 3D point cloud.
    *   Identifies and classifies obstacles based on their shape, size, and movement. (e.g., stationary objects, moving pedestrians, other CUs). Machine Learning classification will be used.
    *   Predicts the future trajectory of moving obstacles.
3.  **Path Planning Module:**
    *   Uses a dynamic path planning algorithm (e.g., A*, RRT*) to calculate optimal paths for the CUs, avoiding obstacles and minimizing travel time.
    *   Considers the constraints of the CUs (e.g., maximum speed, turning radius).
    *   Dynamically adjusts the paths in response to changes in the environment.
4.  **CU Control Module:**
    *   Sends commands to the CUs to execute the planned paths.
    *   Monitors the position and velocity of the CUs using onboard sensors (e.g., IMU, encoders).
    *   Provides feedback to the Path Planning Module to ensure accurate and efficient navigation.
5.  **Remote Monitoring and Control Interface:**
    *   A user-friendly interface for monitoring the status of the system, visualizing the 3D map, and manually controlling the CUs.

**Pseudocode â€“ Dynamic Path Calculation:**

```
function calculatePath(start_node, goal_node, obstacle_map):
  open_set = [start_node]
  closed_set = []

  while open_set is not empty:
    current_node = node with lowest cost in open_set
    if current_node == goal_node:
      return reconstruct_path(current_node)

    open_set.remove(current_node)
    closed_set.append(current_node)

    for neighbor in get_neighbors(current_node):
      if neighbor in closed_set:
        continue

      tentative_g_score = g_score[current_node] + distance(current_node, neighbor)

      if neighbor not in open_set or tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor]:
        g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score
        h_score[neighbor] = heuristic(neighbor, goal_node)
        f_score[neighbor] = g_score[neighbor] + h_score[neighbor]
        parent[neighbor] = current_node

        if neighbor not in open_set:
          open_set.append(neighbor)

  return null // No path found
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   The system is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for the addition of more CUs and LFEs as needed.
*   The use of structured light provides a more accurate and robust depth map than traditional stereo vision or time-of-flight sensors.
*   The dynamic path planning algorithm allows the CUs to navigate complex and changing environments in real-time.
*   The system can be used in a variety of applications, such as manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare.
