## Personalized Speech Interaction ‘Echo’ System

**Concept:** A system augmenting the historical speech interaction feedback loop with proactive, personalized ‘echo’ prompts to refine understanding *during* interactions, rather than solely post-hoc. This builds on the patent's core idea of feedback but shifts the focus to real-time refinement.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Real-time Intent Confidence Analyzer:**  A module residing within the speech interface platform.  This analyzes the confidence score of the understood user intent *as it’s being formed*.  A threshold is defined - if the confidence score falls below this threshold, the system triggers an ‘echo’ prompt.
*   **Component 2: Dynamic Prompt Generator:** This module generates prompts based on the identified uncertainty.  Prompts are designed to be non-intrusive and seek clarification *without* fully disrupting the interaction.
    *   **Prompt Types:**
        *   *Confirmation:*  “Did you mean… [closest alternative intent]?”
        *   *Clarification:* "Could you rephrase that?" (utilizing speech-to-text to analyze the last utterance for ambiguity).
        *   *Contextual Probe:* “Regarding [topic of last utterance], are you referring to… [relevant options]?” (leveraging a knowledge graph of user history & preferences).
*   **Component 3: User Response Analyzer:**  Analyzes the user’s response to the prompt. If the response clarifies intent (confidence score increases above threshold), the interaction continues. If not, the system can escalate to a more detailed clarification sequence, or offer alternative actions.
*   **Component 4: Personalized Echo Profile:**  Stores individual user preferences for echo prompt types, frequency, and intrusiveness. Users can customize their experience to minimize disruption. This profile is used to fine-tune the Dynamic Prompt Generator.
*   **Component 5: Offline Echo Training Module:** A system for pre-training the Dynamic Prompt Generator.  Utilizes large language models to generate a diverse range of clarification prompts, and evaluates their effectiveness through simulated user interactions.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Prompt Generation):**

```
function generatePrompt(intentConfidence, lastUtterance, userProfile) {
  if (intentConfidence < userProfile.confidenceThreshold) {
    //Determine appropriate prompt type based on utterance analysis
    promptType = analyzeUtterance(lastUtterance) // returns "confirmation", "clarification", "contextual"

    if (promptType == "confirmation") {
      prompt = generateConfirmationPrompt(lastUtterance, userProfile)
    } else if (promptType == "clarification") {
      prompt = generateClarificationPrompt(userProfile)
    } else {
      prompt = generateContextualPrompt(lastUtterance, userProfile)
    }

    return prompt
  } else {
    return null // No prompt needed
  }
}

function analyzeUtterance(utterance) {
  //Logic to determine ambiguity. e.g. sentence structure, common homophones, etc.
  //Returns a prompt type category.
}

function generateConfirmationPrompt(utterance, userProfile){
  //Logic to generate confirmation based on intent
}
```

**Innovation:** This system shifts from *reacting* to errors in understanding (post-hoc feedback) to *proactively* seeking clarification *during* the interaction. It utilizes a personalized profile to minimize disruption and improve the user experience, and uses a dynamic prompt generator to tailor the clarification process. It aims to create a more fluid and natural dialogue, where the system anticipates potential misunderstandings and resolves them before they become frustrating for the user.
