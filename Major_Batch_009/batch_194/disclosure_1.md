## Predictive Proximity Notifications & Dynamic Environmental Control

**Concept:** Expanding on the availability/location awareness, create a system that proactively adjusts a user's environment *before* they arrive, based on learned preferences and predicted arrival time.  This goes beyond simple "turn on lights" – it anticipates needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time Location (from voice assistant/device or linked mobile)
    *   Calendar Data (meetings, appointments)
    *   Historical Preference Data (temperature, lighting, music, ambient scents, display settings, device states) – stored per location
    *   Environmental Sensor Data (temperature, humidity, air quality, noise levels at the target location)
    *   External Data Sources (weather, traffic, news – for context)
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Arrival Prediction:** Machine learning model predicts arrival time at a designated location. Factors: current location, travel mode (inferred or specified), traffic conditions, calendar events.  Confidence interval calculated for prediction.
    *   **Preference Mapping:**  Model correlates location with preferred environmental settings (temperature, lighting, audio, etc.).
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Based on predicted arrival and learned preferences, the system initiates adjustments to the environment *prior* to the user’s arrival.  (e.g., Pre-heating/cooling, adjusting lighting, initiating music playlist, activating air purifier, displaying relevant information on smart displays)
    *   **Adaptive Learning:**  System monitors user interactions *after* arrival. If the user manually adjusts settings, the system learns and refines its predictions for future arrivals at that location.
*   **Hardware:**
    *   Voice-controlled device (as central hub)
    *   Smart home ecosystem compatibility (lights, thermostats, audio systems, air purifiers, smart displays)
    *   Location tracking (mobile app/device integration)
*   **Software:**
    *   Machine learning model for arrival prediction.
    *   Preference mapping algorithm.
    *   Environmental control API for smart home devices.
    *   User interface for preference customization and system configuration.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (user_location_available) {
  predicted_arrival = calculate_predicted_arrival(user_location, calendar_events, traffic_data)

  if (predicted_arrival within threshold) { // e.g. 15 minutes
    location = get_current_location()

    preferences = get_preferences_for_location(location)
    adjust_environment(preferences)
  }

  monitor_user_adjustments() // learn from manual overrides
}
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems focus on *reacting* to a user's presence or responding to voice commands.  This proactively anticipates needs based on prediction, creating a seamless and personalized environmental experience *before* the user arrives. It also leverages ongoing learning to refine personalization over time.
