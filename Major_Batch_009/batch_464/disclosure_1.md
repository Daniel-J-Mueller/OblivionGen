**Dynamic Compute Environment Sharding with Predictive Scaling**

**Specification:**

*   **Core Concept:** Implement a system that dynamically shards a compute environment (as defined in the provided patent) based on predicted job workload *before* the reserved compute instance window opens, and proactively allocates resources across multiple multi-tenant provider networks. This extends the concept of reserved instances from a single environment to a distributed, sharded one.

*   **Components:**
    *   **Workload Prediction Engine:** An AI/ML model trained on historical job data (job type, size, dependencies, estimated runtime) to predict workload distribution across queues *during* a specified window. It forecasts demand for various compute instance types.
    *   **Sharding Manager:** Responsible for dividing the overall compute environment into logical shards. Each shard is associated with a specific subset of queues and a designated multi-tenant provider network.
    *   **Cross-Provider Resource Broker:** Negotiates and reserves compute instances across multiple providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) based on the Sharding Managerâ€™s directives and cost optimization algorithms.
    *   **Inter-Shard Communication Fabric:**  A secure, low-latency communication layer (e.g., gRPC, message queue) that enables jobs spanning multiple shards to exchange data and coordinate execution.
    *   **Dynamic Routing Layer:**  Intelligently routes jobs to the appropriate shard based on resource availability, job dependencies, and latency requirements.

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  *Prediction Phase:*  The Workload Prediction Engine analyzes historical data and generates a workload forecast for the upcoming reservation window.
    2.  *Sharding & Allocation:* The Sharding Manager divides the compute environment into shards. The Cross-Provider Resource Broker reserves compute instances across multiple providers for each shard, *before* the reservation window opens.
    3.  *Queue Mapping:* Queues are dynamically mapped to specific shards based on predicted workload.
    4.  *Job Execution:* Jobs are routed to the appropriate shard, executed on reserved compute instances.
    5.  *Dynamic Re-Sharding:* The system continuously monitors resource utilization and workload distribution. If necessary, it dynamically re-shards the environment (e.g., migrating jobs between shards) to optimize performance and cost.

*   **Pseudocode (Sharding Manager):**

```
function createShards(workloadForecast, providerList, costConstraints):
    shardList = []
    for each provider in providerList:
        shard = new Shard(provider)
        shard.instanceType = selectOptimalInstanceType(workloadForecast, provider, costConstraints)
        shard.instanceCount = estimateRequiredInstanceCount(workloadForecast)
        shardList.append(shard)

    //Distribute Queues based on the workload forecast and shard capacity
    for each queue in workloadForecast.queues:
        bestShard = findShardWithSufficientCapacity(queue, shardList)
        bestShard.addQueue(queue)

    return shardList

function findShardWithSufficientCapacity(queue, shardList):
    //Iterate through shards and determine which best fits the needs
    //based on capacity and estimated load
    //Consider latency requirements
    return bestShard

```

*   **Scalability & Resilience:**
    *   Utilize containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) for easy deployment and scaling.
    *   Implement health checks and automated failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
    *   Distribute shards across multiple geographic regions to improve resilience and reduce latency.

*   **Potential Benefits:**
    *   Increased resource utilization.
    *   Reduced costs through multi-provider negotiation and dynamic scaling.
    *   Improved performance and latency.
    *   Enhanced resilience and availability.
    *   Greater flexibility and scalability.
