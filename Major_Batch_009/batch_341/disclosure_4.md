## Dynamic Trie Sharding with Bloom Filter Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand upon the trie-based indexing by introducing a dynamic sharding scheme coupled with Bloom filter prefetching to dramatically improve search performance and scalability, particularly for streaming data. The core idea is to distribute the trie across multiple nodes (shards), not based on fixed prefixes, but on data *density* within the trie itself, and proactively prefetch relevant shards based on Bloom filter predictions.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Density Mapping:** Implement an algorithm to analyze the trie structure and identify “hot” and “cold” regions based on node visit frequency during training or initial data ingestion. Nodes with high visit frequencies represent dense regions.
*   **Dynamic Sharding:** Divide the trie into shards dynamically. Shards are not based on prefixes (e.g., A-C, D-F). Instead, the algorithm determines shard boundaries by cutting the trie at points that minimize inter-shard node connections while maximizing shard size balance. Each shard resides on a separate processing node.
*   **Bloom Filter Construction:**  For each shard, construct a Bloom filter representing the data it indexes. The Bloom filter size should be tunable to balance accuracy and memory consumption.
*   **Query Routing:**
    1.  Receive a search query.
    2.  Hash the query string.
    3.  Probe the Bloom filters of all shards using the hash.
    4.  Identify shards that *potentially* contain the query (positive Bloom filter probes).
    5.  Send the query *only* to the identified shards.
    6.  Aggregate results from the shards.
*   **Shard Migration:** Implement a mechanism for dynamic shard migration.
    1.  Monitor shard load (query volume, memory usage).
    2.  If a shard becomes overloaded, split it into smaller shards and redistribute the data.
    3.  If a shard is underutilized, merge it with another shard.  This is achieved via a distributed trie merging operation.
*   **Trie Merging Protocol:** Distributed protocol for merging two trie shards.
    1.  Initiate the merge operation.
    2.  One shard becomes the "donor" and the other the "recipient".
    3.  The donor shard streams its trie structure to the recipient.
    4.  The recipient incrementally integrates the donor's structure into its own trie.
    5.  Utilize consistent hashing to determine data ownership after the merge.
*   **Failure Handling:** Implement robust failure handling mechanisms.
    1.  Replication: Replicate each shard across multiple nodes.
    2.  Automatic Failover: If a node fails, automatically failover to a replica.

**Pseudocode (Query Routing):**

```
function route_query(query, shard_list):
  hash_val = hash(query)
  potential_shards = []
  for shard in shard_list:
    if bloom_filter_check(shard.bloom_filter, hash_val):
      potential_shards.append(shard)

  results = []
  for shard in potential_shards:
    result = shard.search(query)  // Search within the shard's trie
    results.extend(result)

  return results
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The number of shards can be scaled up or down dynamically based on data volume and query load.
*   Shards can be distributed across a cluster of commodity servers.
*   Bloom filter size and parameters (e.g., number of hash functions) can be tuned to optimize performance and accuracy.

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond static trie indexing to a truly dynamic and distributed system that can handle massive streaming datasets and provide low-latency search results.  The combination of density-based sharding and Bloom filter prefetching is a key innovation.
