## Automated Predictive Scaling Based on Impairment 'Shadows'

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:**  Instead of *reacting* to identified impairments, proactively scale resources based on ‘impairment shadows’ – subtle performance deviations *preceding* full impairment manifestation.  The existing patent focuses on mitigating *after* an impairment is detected. This builds a predictive layer.

**Components:**

1.  **Shadow Metric Collection Agent:** Runs on each computing node.  Collects a broader range of metrics than typical health checks, focusing on subtle deviations. Examples:
    *   Minor increases in latency (even within acceptable bounds)
    *   Slight increases in resource contention (CPU, memory, network I/O)
    *   Changes in request processing patterns (e.g., a slight shift in the distribution of request types)
    *   Increases in minor error rates (e.g., transient network errors, minor application-level errors logged but not immediately impacting service)
2.  **Baseline Profiler:** Continuously builds a performance baseline for each computing device and the overall system.  Uses statistical methods (e.g., time series analysis, anomaly detection) to establish 'normal' operating ranges for all collected metrics.  Crucially, this baseline is *dynamic* and adapts to changing workloads.
3.  **Impending Impairment Detector:**  Analyzes incoming shadow metrics against the established baseline.  Uses a weighted scoring system.
    *   Each metric deviation receives a score based on its magnitude and statistical significance.
    *   The score is weighted based on the metric’s historical correlation with actual impairments (learned over time – see ‘Feedback Loop’).
    *   When the total score exceeds a predefined threshold, the system predicts an impending impairment.
4.  **Predictive Scaler:**  Upon receiving an impending impairment signal, automatically scales resources *before* the impairment fully manifests.
    *   Scales *predictively*, adding capacity to the affected computing device(s) or shifting load to healthy devices.
    *   Scaling can be vertical (increasing resources on the existing device) or horizontal (adding new devices).
    *   Scaling decisions are based on the severity of the predicted impairment and the available capacity.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitors the accuracy of impairment predictions.
    *   Records all predictions and their outcomes (whether an impairment actually occurred).
    *   Adjusts the weighting factors in the Impending Impairment Detector based on prediction accuracy.  Metrics that consistently predict accurate impairments receive higher weights.
    *   Refines the scaling policies based on observed performance.

**Pseudocode (Impending Impairment Detector):**

```
function detectImpendingImpairment(shadowMetrics):
  impairmentScore = 0
  for metric in shadowMetrics:
    deviation = metric.currentValue - metric.baselineValue
    if abs(deviation) > metric.threshold:
      score = deviation * metric.weight  // Metric weight learned via feedback loop
      impairmentScore += score
  if impairmentScore > IMPAIRMENT_THRESHOLD:
    return TRUE // Predict Impairment
  else:
    return FALSE
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Time-series database for storing shadow metrics and baseline data.
*   Configuration database for storing metric thresholds, weights, and scaling policies.
*   Log database for recording all predictions, outcomes, and scaling actions.

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond *reactive* impairment mitigation to *proactive* prevention, leveraging subtle performance deviations as early warning signals.  The feedback loop allows the system to learn and adapt, improving prediction accuracy and optimizing scaling decisions.  Existing systems primarily focus on identifying and resolving impairments *after* they occur.
