## Dynamic AP "Personality" Profiles

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple performance scoring & reason code classification to create dynamic "personality" profiles for each AP, factoring in usage patterns, client device types, and environmental conditions. This allows for *proactive* connection steering beyond simple load balancing or band steering, anticipating client needs and optimizing connections *before* disconnects occur.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Module (Server-Side):**
    *   Collects data from wireless devices:
        *   BSSID, OUI
        *   Reason codes (as per patent)
        *   Client Device Type (e.g., phone, laptop, IoT) – via DHCP fingerprinting or active probing.
        *   Signal Strength (RSSI) – real time and historical.
        *   Data Rate – current & historical.
        *   Application Type – (e.g. video streaming, web browsing, gaming) – using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) – anonymized and aggregated.
        *   Time of Day/Week.
        *   Location Data (approximate, derived from client device if permission granted, or network topology) – to infer environment (e.g. office, home, public space).
    *   Data is anonymized and aggregated to protect user privacy.
*   **Personality Engine (Server-Side):**
    *   Utilizes a machine learning model (e.g. clustering, Bayesian networks, reinforcement learning) to create “Personality Profiles” for each AP.
    *   Personality Profile contains:
        *   **Usage Pattern:**  Time-of-day usage peaks, predominant application types.
        *   **Client Preference:** Most common client device types connecting to this AP.
        *   **Performance Characteristics:** Average throughput, latency, signal strength.
        *   **Environmental Sensitivity:**  Sensitivity to interference, roaming patterns based on location.
        *   **"Mood"**: A dynamic score (0-100) indicating AP health and suitability for different client types. Derived from all other parameters.
*   **Predictive Steering Module (Server-Side):**
    *   Receives connection requests from wireless devices.
    *   Based on client device type, location (if available), and AP Personality Profiles, predicts the *best* AP for that client *before* connection.
    *   Sends a recommendation to the client device (e.g., via beacon frame modification or a dedicated signaling channel).
*   **Client-Side Agent:**
    *   Receives AP recommendations from the Predictive Steering Module.
    *   Weighs the recommendation against its own internal preferences (e.g., saved networks, signal strength).
    *   Prioritizes AP scanning based on the recommendation.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitors connection quality and client behavior after steering.
    *   Uses this data to refine AP Personality Profiles and improve prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Steering Module):**

```
function predict_best_AP(client_device_type, client_location, available_APs):
  best_AP = null
  highest_score = -1

  for each AP in available_APs:
    score = 0

    // Client Type Preference
    if AP.personality.client_preference matches client_device_type:
      score += 30

    // Location Preference
    if AP.personality.location matches client_location:
      score += 20

    // Performance
    score += AP.personality.performance_score * 20

    // Mood
    score += AP.personality.mood * 30

    if score > highest_score:
      highest_score = score
      best_AP = AP

  return best_AP
```

**Expansion:**  Integrate with smart home/office systems to factor in environmental conditions (temperature, occupancy) into AP Personality Profiles. APs could dynamically adjust transmit power or channel selection based on predicted client needs.
