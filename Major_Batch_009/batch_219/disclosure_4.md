**Volumetric Capture Stage with Dynamic Reflective Geometry**

**Core Concept:** Extend the studio arrangement to enable capture of subjects from multiple perspectives *simultaneously* without physical camera movement, creating a rudimentary volumetric capture stage. This relies on dynamically adjustable reflective surfaces to “steer” light and create the illusion of different viewpoints.

**Specs:**

*   **Stage Dimensions:** 8ft x 8ft x 8ft enclosed space.
*   **Reflective Panels:** 12 independent, hexagonal panels (approx. 2ft edge length) lining the interior walls and ceiling. Material: Highly polished, motorized aluminum composite. Each panel capable of +/- 30 degree rotation on two axes.
*   **Lighting System:**
    *   Key Light: High-output LED fixture, adjustable color temperature & intensity. Positioned outside the stage.
    *   Rear Light: Strip LED array, positioned behind elevated platform (as in the base patent).
    *   Panel-Integrated LEDs: Each reflective panel incorporates addressable RGB LEDs on its surface. These LEDs are used for subtle fill, edge highlighting, and dynamic reflections.
*   **Elevated Platform:** Transparent acrylic top, white rear panel, dimensions identical to those described in the patent (4ft x 4ft x 11in).
*   **Image Capture:** Single, high-resolution camera with a fixed position. Alternatively, an array of synchronized cameras could be used to reduce capture time.
*   **Control System:** Real-time control software to manage panel rotation, LED brightness/color, and camera trigger.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
initialize_panels()
initialize_lighting()
initialize_camera()

// Capture Sequence
for each view_angle in desired_angles:
    calculate_panel_angles(view_angle) // Determine necessary panel rotation
    set_panel_angles()
    adjust_panel_leds(view_angle) // Color and intensity to simulate light bounce
    capture_image()
    save_image(view_angle)

// Image Processing
combine_images() // Stitch images together to create a 3D representation
generate_volumetric_model()
```

**Refinements/Extensions:**

*   **Polarization Control:** Incorporate polarization filters on the panels and camera to minimize reflections and control light direction further.
*   **Dynamic Mesh:** Replace hexagonal panels with a more complex, adaptable mesh for finer control over reflections.
*   **AI-Assisted Reflection Mapping:** Use machine learning to predict optimal reflection patterns for different subjects and lighting conditions.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Incorporate haptic feedback devices to allow users to "feel" the 3D representation.
*   **Automated Calibration Routine:** Implement a self-calibration routine to ensure accurate reflection mapping and image alignment.
*   **Transparent Floor:** Replace the floor with transparent material to enhance the volumetric effect.
*   **Multi-Camera Support:** Add additional cameras to increase capture speed and resolution.
*   **Remote Control:** Enable remote control of the entire system via a mobile app or web interface.
