## Dynamic Contextual Bias Network (DCBN)

**Concept:** Leverage the companion network concept to create a continuously adapting "bias" network that isn’t just item-specific, but *user-session* specific, influencing the primary network’s predictions in real-time based on immediate interaction. This moves beyond cold-start to *warm-follow* – adapting to evolving user needs *during* a session.

**Specifications:**

*   **Primary Network:** Any standard machine learning model for prediction (e.g., neural network for recommendation, classification, regression). This is the network being *influenced*.
*   **Bias Network (BN):** A small, rapidly trainable neural network (potentially a simplified version of the Primary Network’s architecture – fewer layers/nodes). This is the network *generating* the bias.
*   **Input to BN:** Real-time user interaction data *within the current session*. This includes:
    *   Items viewed/clicked.
    *   Time spent on each item.
    *   Search queries.
    *   Any explicit feedback (likes, dislikes, ratings).
    *   Implicit signals (mouse movements, scrolling).
*   **Output of BN:** A dynamic “bias vector”.  This vector will have the same dimensionality as a key layer (e.g. the final fully connected layer) in the Primary Network. This bias vector represents a *shift* in the Primary Network’s activation values.
*   **Integration:** The bias vector is *added* to the activation values of the target layer in the Primary Network *before* the final prediction is made. This is a direct modulation of the primary network’s output.
*   **Training:**
    *   **Primary Network:** Trained offline on historical data.
    *   **Bias Network:** Trained *online* during the user session using reinforcement learning. The reward function is based on user engagement (click-through rate, purchase rate, time spent on site, etc.).  Training data is generated *from the current session*.
*   **Session Reset:** At the start of each new user session, the Bias Network is re-initialized (or set to a default state).
*   **Parallel Processing:** The Primary Network and Bias Network operate in parallel.  This minimizes latency.

**Pseudocode (Bias Network Update):**

```python
# Assume 'session_data' contains the user's interaction history in the current session
# 'bn_model' is the Bias Network
# 'primary_model' is the Primary Network
# 'input_vector' is the input to the primary network

def update_bias(session_data, bn_model, primary_model, input_vector):
    # Process session data into a feature vector
    feature_vector = process_session_data(session_data)

    # Generate bias vector using the Bias Network
    bias_vector = bn_model.predict(feature_vector)

    # Get primary network activation
    activation = primary_model.predict(input_vector)

    # Apply bias
    biased_activation = activation + bias_vector

    # Return biased activation
    return biased_activation
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   The Bias Network is designed to be small and efficient, allowing it to run on edge devices (e.g., user’s phone, browser) or on a dedicated server.
*   Parallel processing capabilities are essential to minimize latency.
*   GPU acceleration may be beneficial for training the Bias Network in real-time.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Personalized recommendations.
*   Dynamic pricing.
*   Adaptive user interfaces.
*   Real-time fraud detection.
