## Predictive Parcel Interaction System

**System Overview:**

This system expands on parcel monitoring by not just detecting removal, but *predicting* interaction with a parcel and initiating proactive responses. It aims to move beyond simple alerts to provide a more nuanced and potentially preventative security/convenience layer.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **A/V Device:** Existing camera/motion detection hardware as per the base patent.
*   **Low-Power Radar Module:** Integrated or add-on module to detect approaching individuals/objects *before* they enter the camera's primary field of view. Operates independently of visual data, providing early warning even in low-light or obscured conditions.
*   **Micro-Actuator (Optional):** Small, localized actuator capable of activating a deterrent (e.g., brief, directional puff of air, focused ultrasonic sound) or a convenience feature (e.g. temporary spotlight illumination).

**Software/Algorithmic Components:**

1.  **Approach Vector Prediction:**
    *   Radar data is processed to identify approaching objects/individuals.
    *   Trajectory analysis predicts the likely path and point of interaction with the monitored area (where parcels are placed).
    *   This is a Kalman filter type prediction.

2.  **Interaction Probability Assessment:**
    *   Combines trajectory data with visual analysis (from A/V device).
    *   Object recognition identifies the approaching entity (person, animal, vehicle, etc.).
    *   Behavioral analysis assesses intent – is the entity directly approaching the parcel, or simply passing by? Uses pre-trained models for activity recognition (walking, running, reaching, etc.).
    *   Assigns a probability score (0-100%) indicating the likelihood of parcel interaction.

3.  **Dynamic Response System:**
    *   Based on the interaction probability score, the system initiates one of several actions:
        *   **Low Probability (0-30%):** No action. System continues monitoring.
        *   **Medium Probability (30-70%):**
            *   Initiate camera recording.
            *   Send a pre-emptive alert to the user: “Potential parcel interaction detected.”
            *   Activate a temporary spotlight focused on the parcel area for better visibility.
        *   **High Probability (70-100%):**
            *   Initiate camera recording.
            *   Send an immediate alert to the user: “Parcel interaction imminent.”
            *   Activate deterrent (brief air puff or ultrasonic sound) directed towards the approaching entity.
            *   Automatically initiate emergency services call if specified by user.

**Pseudocode (Simplified – Interaction Probability Assessment):**

```
function calculateInteractionProbability(radarData, visualData):
  // Radar Data Processing
  approachVector = calculateApproachVector(radarData)
  distanceToParcel = calculateDistance(approachVector, parcelLocation)

  // Visual Data Processing
  objectType = identifyObject(visualData)
  behavior = analyzeBehavior(visualData)

  // Probability Calculation (weighted sum)
  probability = 0
  if objectType == "human":
    probability += 0.6
  if behavior == "reaching":
    probability += 0.7
  if distanceToParcel < 2 meters:
    probability += 0.5

  // Normalize probability (0-100%)
  probability = clamp(probability * 100, 0, 100)

  return probability
```

**User Interface/Settings:**

*   Sensitivity adjustment for interaction probability thresholds.
*   Selection of deterrent type (air puff, ultrasonic sound, etc.).
*   Emergency services call settings (automatic, manual).
*   Customizable alert messages.
*   “Safe Zone” definition – allowing the user to designate areas where approaching individuals should be ignored.
