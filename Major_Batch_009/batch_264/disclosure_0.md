## Adaptive Resolution Mapping with Per-Block Rotation

**Concept:** Extend the address circuit’s shifting/twisting capability to dynamically adjust the resolution of image blocks *before* processing. Instead of simply addressing data, the circuit pre-processes blocks by rotating them – effectively changing the orientation and, consequently, the apparent resolution – based on content analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Resolution Map Generator:** A pre-processing stage analyzes image blocks (e.g., 8x8, 16x16) and assigns a rotation value (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) to each block based on edge direction, texture density, or other visual features. The goal is to align dominant features with the sensor’s highest resolution axis. This generator uses a lightweight CNN or similar algorithm.
*   **Rotational Address Circuit (RAC):**  This is the core innovation.  Instead of purely shifting address bits, the RAC incorporates rotation instructions from the Resolution Map Generator into the address calculation. This dictates how address bits are twisted *before* the data is fetched.
*   **Block Rotation Buffer (BRB):** A dedicated buffer stores rotated blocks temporarily. The BRB is organized as a multi-dimensional array mirroring the image structure.
*   **Modified Address Calculation:**

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_rotated_address(address, rotation_value):
        // address:  Base address for the block
        // rotation_value: 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees

        // High Order Bits (Row) & Low Order Bits (Column)
        row_bits = extract_row_bits(address)
        col_bits = extract_col_bits(address)

        // Rotation Matrix Application (Simplified)
        if rotation_value == 90:
            temp_row = col_bits
            col_bits = row_bits
            row_bits = temp_row
        elif rotation_value == 180:
            row_bits = invert_bits(row_bits)
            col_bits = invert_bits(col_bits)
        elif rotation_value == 270:
            temp_row = col_bits
            col_bits = row_bits
            row_bits = temp_row

        rotated_address = combine_bits(row_bits, col_bits)
        return rotated_address
    ```

*   **Data Fetch Sequence:**
    1.  Image Block Analysis: Resolution Map Generator determines rotation value for a block.
    2.  Address Calculation: RAC modifies the original address based on the rotation value.
    3.  Data Fetch: Data is fetched from memory using the rotated address.
    4.  Store in BRB: Rotated block is stored in the Block Rotation Buffer.
    5.  Image Processing:  Image processing unit operates on rotated data in BRB.

*   **Hardware Implementation:** The RAC will be implemented using a combination of barrel shifters (as described in the provided patent), multiplexers, and a dedicated rotation logic unit. The BRB will be implemented using high-speed SRAM or similar memory technology.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** A feedback loop monitors image processing results. If features are still misaligned or resolution adjustments are insufficient, the Resolution Map Generator dynamically adjusts rotation values and recalculates addresses.
* **Extension**: Implement a 'gradient' rotation, where each pixel within the block is rotated slightly based on local feature analysis.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved image sharpness and detail, particularly in images with prominent diagonal lines or textures.
*   Reduced aliasing artifacts.
*   More efficient image compression.
*   Enhanced performance for computer vision tasks such as object detection and recognition.
*   Increased dynamic range.
