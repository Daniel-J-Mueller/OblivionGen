## Adaptive Resource Allocation based on Code Provenance & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust resource allocation (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to containerized code *not* solely based on user-defined security policies, but on a dynamically calculated ‘trust score’ derived from the code's origin, build process, and runtime behavior. This is a layered system, combining static and dynamic analysis to create a granular resource control mechanism.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Provenance Tracking System:**
    *   Implement a system to meticulously record the entire lifecycle of the program code, from initial commit in a repository, through build steps (including dependencies), to deployment.
    *   Utilize cryptographic signing at each stage to ensure integrity and non-repudiation.  Every artifact (source code, compiled binaries, container images) receives a digital signature.
    *   Store provenance data in a tamper-proof ledger (blockchain or similar).

2.  **Trust Score Calculation:**
    *   **Static Analysis Component:** Analyze code for known vulnerabilities, code complexity (cyclomatic complexity), and adherence to secure coding standards.  Assign a base trust score.
    *   **Build Process Verification:** Verify the integrity of the build environment (e.g., Dockerfile, CI/CD pipeline). Confirm that build dependencies are from trusted sources and have not been tampered with. Adjust the trust score accordingly.
    *   **Runtime Behavior Monitoring:**  Monitor the container’s runtime behavior (system calls, network activity, memory access patterns) for anomalous activities. Employ machine learning models to detect deviations from expected behavior.
    *   **Reputation System:** Incorporate a reputation system based on the historical behavior of the code and the organization that produced it. Track instances of security incidents, vulnerabilities discovered, and compliance violations.

    *   **Trust Score Formula:**  `Trust Score = Base Score + Build Integrity Score + Runtime Behavior Score + Reputation Score`. Each component is weighted based on its importance.  Adjust weights dynamically based on observed performance.

3.  **Adaptive Resource Allocation:**
    *   Implement a resource scheduler that utilizes the Trust Score to dynamically adjust resource allocation for each container.
    *   **Resource Allocation Policy:**

        *   `High Trust Score (e.g., > 0.8):`  Allocate requested resources with minimal restrictions.
        *   `Medium Trust Score (e.g., 0.5 - 0.8):` Allocate a percentage of requested resources, apply rate limiting on network traffic, and enable increased logging and monitoring.
        *   `Low Trust Score (e.g., < 0.5):` Allocate a minimal set of resources, severely restrict network access, and run the container in a highly isolated environment (e.g., a sandboxed VM). Implement real-time security analysis of container activity.

4.  **Runtime Isolation & Sandboxing:**
    *   Employ a multi-layered isolation strategy:
        *   **Containerization:** Use Docker or similar to isolate the application from the host system.
        *   **Seccomp & AppArmor:**  Configure seccomp profiles and AppArmor policies to restrict system call access.
        *   **Sandboxed VM:**  For low-trust code, run the container within a lightweight VM (e.g., Firecracker) to provide an additional layer of isolation.

5.  **Automated Response & Remediation:**
    *   Implement an automated response system that triggers alerts and takes corrective actions based on the Trust Score and observed behavior.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   **Resource Restriction:** Reduce resource allocation.
        *   **Network Isolation:** Block network access.
        *   **Container Termination:** Terminate the container.
        *   **Rollback:** Revert to a known-good version of the code.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function allocateResources(container, trustScore) {
  if (trustScore > 0.8) {
    container.cpu = container.requestedCPU;
    container.memory = container.requestedMemory;
    container.networkAccess = "unrestricted";
  } else if (trustScore >= 0.5 && trustScore <= 0.8) {
    container.cpu = container.requestedCPU * 0.5;
    container.memory = container.requestedMemory * 0.5;
    container.networkAccess = "rateLimited";
    enableDetailedLogging(container);
  } else {
    container.cpu = 100; // Millicores
    container.memory = 256; // MB
    container.networkAccess = "isolated";
    runInSandboxedVM(container);
  }
}

function monitorRuntimeBehavior(container) {
  // Collect metrics (system calls, network activity, memory access)
  metrics = collectMetrics(container);

  // Analyze metrics using machine learning models
  anomalyScore = detectAnomaly(metrics);

  // Update trust score based on anomaly score
  container.trustScore = updateTrustScore(container.trustScore, anomalyScore);

  // Re-allocate resources based on updated trust score
  allocateResources(container, container.trustScore);
}
```

This system goes beyond user-defined policies and creates a dynamic, self-adjusting security layer based on the actual trustworthiness of the code, improving overall security posture and resource utilization.
