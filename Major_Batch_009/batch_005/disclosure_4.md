## Dynamic Comic Panel Linking & Narrative Branching

**Concept:** Extend the interactive 3D comic panel system to allow for dynamic linking between panels based on user interaction *and* narrative branching based on cumulative interaction across multiple pages. Essentially, create a 'choose your own adventure' style comic experience *within* the 3D panel framework.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Interaction Data Logging:**  The system must log *all* user interactions within each panel â€“ gaze direction, object selection, duration of focus, even subtle gestures if input devices allow. This is beyond simple "click" or "tap" data.

2.  **Panel Link Database:** A database (JSON or similar) will map interaction data patterns to potential linked panels.  For example: 
    ```json
    {
      "panel_id": "page3_panel2",
      "trigger": {
        "object_focused": "rusty_gear",
        "duration": ">3 seconds"
      },
      "destination_panel": "page5_panel1",
      "transition_effect": "zoom_and_pan"
    }
    ```
    This means if the user focuses on 'rusty_gear' for more than 3 seconds in panel `page3_panel2`, the system will transition to `page5_panel1` using a zoom and pan effect.

3.  **Narrative State Engine:** A core engine that tracks a 'narrative state' based on accumulated user interactions. This state is a vector of values representing the user's choices and actions across multiple pages.  Example: `narrative_state = [choice_A: 1, choice_B: 0, action_C: 1]`

4.  **Dynamic Panel Generation:**  The system must be able to dynamically generate or modify panel content based on the `narrative_state`. This could involve:
    *   Changing character dialogue within a speech bubble.
    *   Introducing new objects into the panel scene.
    *   Altering the background environment.
    *   Swapping out entire panels with alternative versions.

5.  **Content Authoring Tool:**  A visual editor allowing content creators to:
    *   Define interaction triggers for each panel.
    *   Link panels to specific destination panels.
    *   Define how the `narrative_state` should be modified by each interaction.
    *   Create different versions of panels based on `narrative_state` conditions.

**Pseudocode (Interaction Handler):**

```
function handlePanelInteraction(panel_id, interaction_data) {
  // 1. Check for linked panels based on interaction_data
  linked_panel = findLinkedPanel(panel_id, interaction_data);

  if (linked_panel != null) {
    // 2. Update narrative state
    narrative_state = updateNarrativeState(interaction_data, narrative_state);

    // 3. Transition to linked panel
    transitionToPanel(linked_panel, narrative_state);
    return;
  }

  // 4. If no link, process standard panel interaction logic
  processStandardInteraction(panel_id, interaction_data);
}

function updateNarrativeState(interaction_data, narrative_state) {
  // Logic to modify narrative_state based on interaction_data
  // Example: narrative_state["choice_A"] = 1;
  return narrative_state;
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Requires a robust and scalable database for storing panel link data and narrative state information.
*   Efficient panel loading and rendering are crucial to maintain a smooth user experience.
*   The content authoring tool must be intuitive and easy to use for content creators.
*   A system for version control of panel content is essential for managing changes and updates.
