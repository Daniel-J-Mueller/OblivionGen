## Dynamic Interference Mapping & Predictive Power Allocation

**Concept:** Augment the RSSI/RSQI-based power saving scheme with a dynamic interference map, and use predictive algorithms to anticipate future channel conditions, enabling even more granular and proactive power allocation. This moves beyond *reacting* to current conditions to *anticipating* them.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Directional Antenna Array (Small Form Factor):** Integrated into the wireless device. Minimum 4 elements, capable of beamforming/beamsteering. This isnâ€™t for data transmission, but *solely* for interference mapping.
*   **Dedicated Interference Measurement Unit (IMU):** A low-power dedicated processor for analyzing signals received by the antenna array, identifying interference sources (frequency, direction, strength).
*   **Increased Memory:** Sufficient to store a dynamic interference map (described below) and historical channel data.
*   **Enhanced CPU:** Capable of running predictive algorithms (described below).

**2. Software/Algorithm Components:**

*   **Dynamic Interference Map:** A spatial representation of interference sources, updated continuously. This map stores:
    *   Frequency of interference signal.
    *   Angle of Arrival (AoA) of interference signal (derived from the antenna array data).
    *   Strength of interference signal.
    *   Timestamp of measurement.
*   **Interference Source Tracking Algorithm:**  Tracks the movement of interference sources over time. Kalman filtering or particle filtering could be employed.
*   **Channel Prediction Algorithm:** Utilizes historical channel data (RSSI, RSQI), interference map data, and interference source tracking to predict future channel quality.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are suitable. This predicts RSSI/RSQI *and* potential interference levels.
*   **Predictive Power Allocation Module:** Based on the predicted channel quality and interference, dynamically adjusts power levels for:
    *   RFFE circuitry.
    *   TX signal processing block.
    *   RX signal processing block.
    *   CPU.
    *   Individual antenna elements (beamforming/steering to minimize interference *and* focus signal).
*   **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjusts the thresholds used for determining the category of channel quality (as defined in the base patent) based on the predicted interference levels. High predicted interference raises the thresholds; low interference lowers them.
*   **Data Collection and Reporting:** A module to log all relevant data (RSSI, RSQI, interference map, predictions, power levels) for further analysis and refinement of the algorithms.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Continuous Interference Mapping:** The antenna array constantly scans for interference, and the IMU builds and updates the dynamic interference map.
2.  **Data Fusion:** The channel prediction algorithm fuses the RSSI/RSQI data with the interference map data and historical channel data.
3.  **Prediction:** The algorithm predicts future channel quality and potential interference levels.
4.  **Power Allocation:** The predictive power allocation module determines the optimal power levels for each component based on the prediction.
5.  **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**  The adaptive threshold adjustment module adjusts the thresholds used to categorize channel quality based on predicted interference.
6.  **Operation:** The wireless device operates using the dynamically allocated power levels.
7.  **Feedback Loop:** The system continuously monitors performance and adjusts the prediction models and power allocation strategies to optimize efficiency.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Power Allocation):**

```
function allocatePower(rssi, rsqi, interferenceMap, historicalData):
  predictedRSSI, predictedRSQI, predictedInterference = predictChannel(rssi, rsqi, interferenceMap, historicalData)

  if predictedInterference > interferenceThreshold:
    // Increase thresholds for channel quality categorization
    thresholdMultiplier = 1.2
  else:
    thresholdMultiplier = 1.0

  channelCategory = determineChannelCategory(rssi, rsqi, thresholdMultiplier)

  if channelCategory == "Excellent":
    rffePowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel * 0.2
    txPowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel * 0.3
    rxPowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel * 0.4
    cpuPowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel * 0.1
  else if channelCategory == "Good":
    rffePowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel * 0.5
    txPowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel * 0.6
    rxPowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel * 0.7
    cpuPowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel * 0.3
  else:
    rffePowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel
    txPowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel
    rxPowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel
    cpuPowerLevel = defaultPowerLevel

  // Apply beamforming/steering to antenna elements to minimize interference

  return rffePowerLevel, txPowerLevel, rxPowerLevel, cpuPowerLevel
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant power savings beyond the base patent.
*   Improved reliability and data throughput in noisy environments.
*   Proactive adaptation to changing channel conditions.
*   More efficient use of wireless resources.
