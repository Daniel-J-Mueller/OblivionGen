## Dynamic Infrastructure 'Stencils' & Procedural Generation

**Concept:** Expand the image-based infrastructure definition to leverage procedural generation *within* the interpreted image. The user doesn’t just draw resources; they draw *rules* for resource creation, and the system expands those rules into a full infrastructure. Think of it as drawing a "seed" that grows into a complex system.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Image containing "stencil" elements. These aren't fully defined resources, but visual cues indicating procedural generation rules. Examples:
    *   **Repeating Pattern Icon:**  Indicates that a resource should be replicated a certain number of times, defined either visually (number of instances drawn) or through a secondary input.
    *   **Gradient Fill:** Indicates a scaling resource. The length/intensity of the gradient determines the scale (e.g., database size, compute capacity).
    *   **Noise Texture:** Represents a randomly distributed set of resources. Parameters control density, distribution type (uniform, gaussian, etc.).
    *   **Connection 'Flow' Arrows:** Indicate the desired data flow and automatically provision data pipelines. The arrow’s thickness can define bandwidth.
*   **Analysis Engine:**
    *   **Stencil Recognition Module:** Identifies the stencil elements within the image using computer vision.
    *   **Rule Interpretation Module:** Translates the recognized stencil elements into procedural generation rules. This module needs a configurable rule set allowing administrators to add/modify rules.
    *   **Parameter Extraction:**  Extracts numerical or symbolic parameters from the image associated with the stencils (e.g., size, count, scaling factor).  
*   **Procedural Generation Engine:**
    *   **Resource Instantiation:**  Instantiates resources based on the defined procedural generation rules.
    *   **Configuration Application:** Configures the instantiated resources based on parameters extracted from the image.
    *   **Connection Establishment:** Establishes connections between the resources, interpreting connection flow arrows and applying appropriate networking configurations.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Interactive Seed Editing:** Allows users to edit the "seed" image directly, visually modifying the procedural generation rules.
    *   **Preview Generation:** Generates a visual preview of the resulting infrastructure before deployment, allowing users to validate the design.
    *   **Parameter Adjustment:** Provides a UI for adjusting the procedural generation parameters (e.g., number of instances, scaling factor) outside of the image itself.

**Pseudocode (Procedural Generation Core):**

```
function generate_infrastructure(image_data):
  stencils = detect_stencils(image_data)
  rules = interpret_stencils(stencils)

  infrastructure = {}

  for rule in rules:
    resource_type = rule.resource_type
    parameters = rule.parameters

    if rule.action == "replicate":
      count = parameters.count
      for i in range(count):
        resource_name = f"{resource_type}_{i}"
        infrastructure[resource_name] = create_resource(resource_type, parameters)

    elif rule.action == "scale":
      size = parameters.size
      infrastructure[resource_type] = create_resource(resource_type, size)

    elif rule.action == "distribute":
      density = parameters.density
      distribute_resources(resource_type, density)

  establish_connections(image_data, infrastructure)
  return infrastructure
```

**Expansion Potential:**  Integration with AI-driven resource optimization. The AI could analyze the generated infrastructure and suggest improvements based on performance, cost, and security.  The user could also provide AI 'constraints' via visual annotations on the image.
