## Adaptive Auditory Scene Reconstruction for Multi-Talker Endpointing

**Concept:** Extend directional audio processing to *reconstruct* a probabilistic auditory scene, actively modeling multiple talkers and background noise sources. Use this reconstruction to inform endpoint detection, dramatically improving accuracy in multi-talker environments.  The existing patent focuses on *discarding* secondary sources. This builds a model of them.

**Specs:**

1.  **Input:** Multi-channel audio stream (minimum 4 channels recommended for 3D localization).
2.  **Source Localization & Tracking Module:**
    *   Employ a beamforming array (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, MVDR) to estimate the direction of arrival (DoA) for all detected audio sources.
    *   Implement a Kalman filter or Particle filter to track the DoA of each source over time, maintaining a probability distribution for its location.  This is critical – we aren’t just looking at a single DoA, but a *cloud* of probable locations.
    *   Assign a “confidence score” to each tracked source based on signal strength, consistency of tracking, and spectral characteristics. Low confidence sources are flagged for potential merging or discarding.
3.  **Auditory Scene Reconstruction Module:**
    *   **Spatial Audio Mapping:** Create a 3D spatial map representing the estimated location and confidence of each detected audio source.  Use a voxel-based approach for discretization.
    *   **Spectral Decomposition:** Perform spectral decomposition (e.g., Non-negative Matrix Factorization - NMF) on the audio signal, *separating* individual sound sources into spectro-temporal components. This isn't perfect separation, just a probabilistic decomposition.
    *   **Source-Voxel Assignment:**  Probabilistically assign each spectro-temporal component to one or more voxels in the spatial map, based on the estimated source direction and confidence.  This creates a “sound field” representation.
    *   **Background Noise Modeling:**  Continuously model the ambient noise floor in each voxel, using statistical methods (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models). This is crucial for distinguishing speech from noise.
4.  **Endpoint Detection Module:**
    *   **Weighted Pause Duration Calculation:**  As in the original patent, calculate pause durations, but weight them based on:
        *   **Source Confidence:**  Higher confidence sources have a stronger weighting.
        *   **Voxel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):**  Pauses in voxels with low SNR are considered less significant.
        *   **Spectral Energy:**  Pauses dominated by non-speech spectral components (e.g., music, environmental noise) are treated differently.
    *   **Multi-Talker Activity Detection:** Implement an algorithm to detect overlapping speech from multiple talkers. This could involve:
        *   **Voice Activity Detection (VAD) per Voxel:** Apply VAD to each voxel independently.
        *   **Inter-Voxel Correlation:** Analyze the correlation between VAD outputs in adjacent voxels. High correlation suggests a single talker.
    *   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the endpoint threshold based on:
        *   **Number of Active Talkers:** Higher numbers of talkers require more conservative thresholds.
        *   **SNR:** Lower SNR requires more lenient thresholds.
        *   **Contextual Analysis:** Utilize a language model to predict likely speech patterns and adjust thresholds accordingly.
5.  **Output:** Endpoint timestamps for each detected utterance, along with confidence scores and identified talker IDs.

**Pseudocode (Endpoint Detection):**

```pseudocode
function detectEndpoint(audioData, spatialMap, languageModel):
    for each voxel in spatialMap:
        vadResult = applyVAD(audioData, voxel)
        if vadResult == "speech":
            voxelSNR = calculateSNR(audioData, voxel)
            pauseDuration = calculatePauseDuration(audioData, voxel)
            weightedPause = pauseDuration * (voxelSNR * confidenceScore)
            cumulativeWeightedPause += weightedPause
        else:
            continue

    if cumulativeWeightedPause > adaptiveThreshold(cumulativeWeightedPause, languageModel):
        return endpointTimestamp
    else:
        return continueProcessing
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond simple directional discarding to a dynamic, probabilistic model of the auditory scene. This allows for far more accurate endpoint detection in challenging multi-talker environments. The focus is on *understanding* the scene, rather than just filtering out unwanted sounds.
