## Dynamic Frequency Allocation Based on Predicted CT Mobility

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Mobility Prediction Engine (MPE) â€“ software module operating within the base station/satellite.
*   **Input Data:**
    *   Real-time CT location data (GPS, triangulation, signal strength).
    *   Historical CT movement patterns (stored database).
    *   Traffic load data for each frequency band.
    *   Weather data (satellite communication systems).
*   **Output Data:** Predicted CT location and frequency band suitability score for the next transmission window (e.g., 100ms - 1s).
*   **Frequency Bands:** Utilize multiple frequency bands for DL/UL communications. (e.g., Ku, Ka bands in satellite systems).

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** MPE continuously gathers CT location, historical movement data, traffic load, and weather data.
2.  **Mobility Prediction:**
    *   **Historical Pattern Analysis:** Identify frequently traveled routes, common dwell locations, and typical movement speeds for each CT.
    *   **Real-time Tracking:** Combine historical data with current location to refine prediction. Kalman filtering or similar algorithms used for trajectory estimation.
    *   **External Factor Integration:** Incorporate weather patterns (satellite) or urban density (terrestrial) to adjust predictions.
3.  **Frequency Suitability Scoring:**
    *   Based on predicted location, assign a suitability score to each frequency band for both DL and UL communications.
    *   Factors influencing score:
        *   **Signal Obstruction:** Evaluate potential obstructions (buildings, terrain, weather) in the predicted path.
        *   **Interference:** Analyze interference levels on each frequency band in the predicted location.
        *   **Bandwidth Availability:** Determine available bandwidth on each frequency band.
        *   **Doppler Shift:** Predict Doppler shift based on CT velocity and adjust frequency allocation accordingly.
4.  **Dynamic Frequency Allocation:**
    *   Based on suitability scores, dynamically allocate frequency bands to each CT for the next transmission window.
    *   Prioritize CTs with high mobility or critical applications.
    *   Implement a feedback loop to adjust predictions based on actual performance.
5.  **Resource Allocation:** The UL/DL schedulers will consider the frequency assignment information when making allocation decisions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Mobility Prediction Engine (MPE)
function predict_ct_location(ct_id, current_location, history, external_factors) {
    // Combine historical data, current location, and external factors
    predicted_location = KalmanFilter(history, current_location, external_factors)
    return predicted_location
}

function calculate_frequency_suitability(predicted_location, frequency_band) {
    obstruction_score = calculate_obstruction(predicted_location, frequency_band)
    interference_score = calculate_interference(predicted_location, frequency_band)
    bandwidth_score = calculate_bandwidth_availability(frequency_band)

    suitability_score = (1 - obstruction_score) * (1 - interference_score) * bandwidth_score
    return suitability_score
}

function allocate_frequency(ct_id) {
    predicted_location = predict_ct_location(ct_id, current_location, history, external_factors)

    frequency_scores = {}
    for each frequency_band in available_bands {
        frequency_scores[frequency_band] = calculate_frequency_suitability(predicted_location, frequency_band)
    }

    best_frequency = max(frequency_scores)
    return best_frequency
}

//Main loop
for each CT in active_CTs {
    assigned_frequency = allocate_frequency(CT.id)
    CT.assigned_frequency = assigned_frequency
    send_frequency_assignment(CT.id, assigned_frequency)
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance processing unit within the base station/satellite to execute the MPE algorithms.
*   Real-time data feeds for CT location, traffic load, and weather data.
*   Flexible radio interface to support multiple frequency bands.
*   Sufficient memory to store historical CT movement data.
