## Thread: Integrated Microfluidic Sample Preparation

**Concept:** A sample collection tube incorporating an integrated, disposable microfluidic chip for on-tube sample preparation *before* analysis. This moves beyond simple collection to initial processing *within* the tube itself.

**Specs:**

*   **Tube Material:** Standard biocompatible plastic (polypropylene, polyethylene) with a molded recess for chip integration. Recess dimensions: 15mm x 8mm x 2mm.
*   **Microfluidic Chip:** Disposable polymer (e.g., PDMS, COC) with pre-defined microchannels. Chip size: 14mm x 7mm x 1mm.  Adheres to recess via biocompatible adhesive or snap-fit mechanism.
*   **Fluidic Interconnects:**  Two barbed fittings molded *into* the tube cap, aligned with inlet/outlet ports on the microfluidic chip when the cap is tightened. Fittings accept standard 1.5mm ID tubing.
*   **Microfluidic Chip Functionality (Example - adaptable):**
    *   **Cell Separation:** Microchannel network with varying widths/heights to separate cells based on size (e.g., RBCs from WBCs).
    *   **Plasma Extraction:** Integrated membrane for selective plasma separation.
    *   **DNA/RNA Extraction (Basic):**  Lysis buffer pre-loaded in a microchamber. Sample flows through, initiating lysis, and captures nucleic acids on a functionalized surface.
*   **Reagent Reservoir:** Small, sealed chamber *within* the chip containing lyophilized reagents (e.g., lysis buffer, primers, enzymes). Activated by sample introduction. Reservoir volume: 50-100uL.
*   **Waste Chamber:** Integrated chamber within the chip for collecting waste fluids. Sealed to prevent leakage.
*   **Optional: Integrated Sensor:**  Miniaturized optical or electrochemical sensor embedded within the chip to monitor the progress of the preparation steps (e.g., pH, concentration of target analyte). Communicates wirelessly via NFC or Bluetooth.
*   **Manufacturing:**
    *   Standard injection molding for tube body.
    *   Microfluidic chips fabricated using soft lithography or micro-milling.
    *   Automated assembly line for chip insertion and adhesive application.

**Pseudocode (Chip Control - for optional sensor integration):**

```
BEGIN
    INITIALIZE sensor
    DETECT sample insertion
    ACTIVATE reagent reservoir
    MONITOR process:
        WHILE (process incomplete)
            READ sensor data
            IF (data outside acceptable range)
                SIGNAL error
                HALT process
            ENDIF
            WAIT(1 second)
        ENDWHILE
    SEAL waste chamber
    RECORD data
    TRANSMIT data wirelessly
END
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond passive collection to *active* on-tube sample processing, reducing contamination, preserving sample integrity, and enabling point-of-care diagnostics. The integrated microfluidic chip is disposable, eliminating the need for manual sample preparation.
