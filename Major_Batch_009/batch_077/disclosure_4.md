*   **Onboard Processing:** NVIDIA Jetson Nano or equivalent with at least 4GB RAM.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   High-resolution RGB camera (minimum 12MP) for visual verification.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for accurate positioning and navigation.
    *   Barometric pressure sensor for altitude control.
*   **Communication:** Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) or 5G cellular connectivity for real-time data transmission.
*   **Software:** ROS (Robot Operating System) framework for modularity and scalability.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Mapping Phase:** Drone autonomously maps the inventory location using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms, creating a 3D model of the environment. Initial map created manually, updated with each audit.
2.  **RFID Scanning:** Drone navigates the mapped area, utilizing the RFID reader to scan for RFID tags associated with inventory items. Tag reads are time-stamped and geo-located within the 3D map.
3.  **Data Fusion:** RFID read data is fused with visual data from the camera. Image recognition algorithms verify the identity of items based on visual features (e.g., product packaging, labels).
4.  **Predictive Loss Detection:**
    *   **Baseline Establishment:** System creates a baseline inventory profile based on initial scans and historical data.
    *   **Deviation Analysis:** Continuous monitoring of RFID tag presence and location. Significant deviations from the baseline (e.g., tag disappearance, unexpected location changes) trigger alerts.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizing machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection models trained on historical inventory data), identify potentially misplaced or stolen items.
    *   **Zone Monitoring:** Divide inventory location into zones. Analyze tag density and distribution within each zone. Significant imbalances indicate potential issues.
5.  **Alerting & Reporting:** System generates real-time alerts for detected anomalies. Detailed reports with inventory status, location data, and anomaly summaries are available through a web-based dashboard.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(RFID_tag_data, historical_data):
    # Calculate deviation from historical data
    deviation = calculateDeviation(RFID_tag_data, historical_data)

    # If deviation exceeds threshold
    if deviation > anomalyThreshold:
        # Generate alert
        generateAlert(RFID_tag_data)
        return True
    else:
        return False

function calculateDeviation(RFID_tag_data, historical_data):
    # Compare current tag locations with historical locations
    location_deviation = calculateLocationDeviation(RFID_tag_data, historical_data)
    # Compare current tag counts with historical counts
    count_deviation = calculateCountDeviation(RFID_tag_data, historical_data)
    # Combine deviations
    combined_deviation = (location_deviation + count_deviation) / 2
    return combined_deviation
```
