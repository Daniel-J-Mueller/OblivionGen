## Dynamic Granularity Caching with Predictive Pre-computation

**Concept:** Extend hierarchical caching by dynamically adjusting the granularity of cached path solutions *and* pre-computing potential future paths based on observed user movement patterns. This shifts from purely reactive caching to a proactive system.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:** A multi-layered caching system.
    *   **Layer 1: Macro-Regions.** Large, pre-defined areas of the grid. Caches general routing possibilities (e.g., "Route from Sector A to Sector B generally involves passing through Landmark X"). Low detail, high coverage.
    *   **Layer 2: Meso-Regions.** Subdivisions of Macro-Regions. Caches more detailed paths, including likely route variations. Medium detail, medium coverage.
    *   **Layer 3: Micro-Regions.** Small grid sections. Caches precise, optimal paths. High detail, low coverage.
*   **Granularity Adjustment:** Implement an algorithm that monitors user request patterns.
    *   If a region receives frequent requests for paths *within* a coarse area, *increase* the granularity of caching in that area (split Meso-Regions into smaller ones, or generate more Micro-Region data).
    *   If a region remains unused for a defined period, *decrease* the granularity, reclaiming memory.
*   **Predictive Pre-computation:**
    *   **Movement Pattern Analysis:** Monitor user travel history (anonymized). Identify common routes, popular destinations, and frequent movement patterns.
    *   **Path Prediction:** Based on historical data, predict potential future paths users might take.
    *   **Pre-compute Paths:** Asynchronously calculate and cache these predicted paths. Prioritize pre-computation for high-probability paths.
    *   **Cost/Benefit Analysis:**  Implement a system that assesses the storage cost of pre-computed paths against the likelihood of use. Don't cache rarely-used predictions.
*   **Caching Validation & Invalidation:**
    *   **Dynamic Obstacle Integration:** Implement a system that re-evaluates cached paths if obstacle data changes, marking the path as potentially invalid.
    *   **Time-To-Live (TTL):** Assign a TTL to each cached solution. Shorter TTLs for frequently changing areas, longer TTLs for static areas.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Pre-computation):**

```
FUNCTION predictAndPrecompute(userTravelHistory, gridData):
  // Analyze user history to determine likely destinations
  destinations = analyzeTravelHistory(userTravelHistory)

  // For each likely destination
  FOR destination IN destinations:
    // Calculate the probability of travel to that destination
    probability = calculateProbability(destination)

    // If the probability exceeds a threshold
    IF probability > threshold:
      // Generate potential paths from current user location to destination
      potentialPaths = generatePaths(currentUserLocation, destination, gridData)

      // For each potential path
      FOR path IN potentialPaths:
        // Calculate the cost of the path
        cost = calculatePathCost(path, gridData)

        // Store the path with its cost in the cache
        cache.storePath(path, cost)
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   Focus on efficient memory management, especially for the dynamic granularity adjustment.
*   Utilize asynchronous processing to avoid blocking the main pathfinding service.
*   Design the caching system to be scalable and resilient to failures.
*   Consider using a distributed caching architecture for large grids.
*   Privacy considerations are paramount â€“ ensure user data is anonymized and handled securely.
