## Dynamic Contextual Indexing & Retrieval

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple term indexing to index *relationships* between terms within a document, creating a contextual graph. Then, leverage this graph for search, allowing retrieval based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matches.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Contextual Graph:** A graph database (Neo4j, ArangoDB) where:
    *   **Nodes:** Represent individual terms (words, phrases).
    *   **Edges:** Represent relationships between terms.  Edge types include:
        *   `PRECEDES`: Term A precedes Term B in the text.
        *   `FOLLOWS`: Term A follows Term B.
        *   `COOCCURS_WITHIN_SENTENCE`: Term A and Term B appear in the same sentence.
        *   `COOCCURS_WITHIN_PARAGRAPH`: Term A and Term B appear in the same paragraph.
        *   `DEFINES` / `IS_DEFINED_BY`:  Used for identifying definitions and the terms they define. (Requires NLP-based definition extraction).
*   **Document Index:** A standard index (like Lucene) that maps document IDs to their content for fast access.

**2. Indexing Process:**

```pseudocode
function indexDocument(documentID, documentContent):
    text = extractText(documentContent)
    sentences = splitTextIntoSentences(text)

    for sentence in sentences:
        terms = extractTerms(sentence) // Tokenization, stemming, stop word removal
        for i from 0 to terms.length - 1:
            termA = terms[i]

            for j from i + 1 to terms.length - 1:
                termB = terms[j]
                // Create/update edges in the Contextual Graph
                addOrUpdateEdge(graph, termA, "PRECEDES", termB)
                addOrUpdateEdge(graph, termB, "FOLLOWS", termA)
                if terms share a sentence:
                   addOrUpdateEdge(graph, termA, "COOCCURS_WITHIN_SENTENCE", termB)
                if terms share a paragraph:
                   addOrUpdateEdge(graph, termA, "COOCCURS_WITHIN_PARAGRAPH", termB)

        // Definition extraction (NLP)
        definitions = extractDefinitions(sentence)
        for definition in definitions:
           addOrUpdateEdge(graph, definition.term, "DEFINES", definition.definition)
           addOrUpdateEdge(graph, definition.definition, "IS_DEFINED_BY", definition.term)

    // Update document index with metadata/links to graph nodes
```

**3. Search Process:**

```pseudocode
function search(query):
    queryTerms = extractTerms(query)
    results = []

    // Initial node retrieval
    startNodes = []
    for term in queryTerms:
        nodes = findNodesByTerm(graph, term)
        startNodes.addAll(nodes)

    // Graph traversal (Depth-First Search / Breadth-First Search)
    visitedNodes = new Set()
    queue = new Queue()
    queue.addAll(startNodes)
    visitedNodes.addAll(startNodes)

    while queue is not empty:
        currentNode = queue.dequeue()

        // Check for document association
        documentID = getAssociatedDocument(currentNode)
        if documentID is not null and documentID not in results:
            results.add(documentID)

        // Expand search - find neighbors
        neighbors = getNeighbors(graph, currentNode)
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if neighbor not in visitedNodes:
                visitedNodes.add(neighbor)
                queue.enqueue(neighbor)

    return results
```

**4.  Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated graph database server.
*   Sufficient RAM for graph database and indexing operations.
*   Solid-state drives (SSDs) for fast data access.

**5.  User Interface Enhancements:**

*   **Semantic Highlighting:** Highlight related terms within search results based on graph connections.
*   **Concept Exploration:** Allow users to navigate the contextual graph to discover related concepts.
*   **Query Refinement:** Suggest related terms or concepts to help users refine their searches.
