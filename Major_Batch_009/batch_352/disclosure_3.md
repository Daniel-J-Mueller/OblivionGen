## Adaptive Inventory Holder Geometry

**Concept:** Develop inventory holders with dynamically adjustable geometry, allowing them to reconfigure their shape and internal division to optimally accommodate items of varying sizes and shapes. This moves beyond static holders and introduces a ‘morphing’ capacity.

**Specs:**

*   **Holder Material:** Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) composite reinforced with carbon nanotubes for strength and responsiveness. The composite needs to exhibit predictable and repeatable deformation under controlled thermal or electrical stimuli.
*   **Actuation System:** Embedded micro-heaters or piezoelectric actuators distributed throughout the holder’s structure. These actuators respond to signals from the management module.
*   **Sensing System:** Integrated pressure sensors and proximity sensors distributed across the internal surfaces of the holder. These sensors detect the presence and size of items placed within the holder.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy) to relay sensor data to the management module and receive actuation commands.
*   **Geometry Control Algorithm:**  The management module runs an algorithm that analyzes sensor data to determine the optimal holder geometry for the current inventory. 
    *   Algorithm Input: Sensor data (pressure, proximity), item dimensions (obtained from inventory database), desired packing density.
    *   Algorithm Output: Actuation signals for individual micro-heaters/piezoelectric actuators.
*   **Power Supply:** Integrated rechargeable battery with wireless charging capability.
*   **Mechanical Design:** Modular construction with interlocking segments to allow for complex deformations.  Segments should have rounded edges to prevent damage to inventory items.
*   **Surface Finish:** Non-static, easily cleanable material to prevent dust accumulation.

**Pseudocode (Geometry Control Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustHolderGeometry(sensorData, itemDimensions, desiredPackingDensity):

  // Analyze sensor data to determine occupied volume and pressure distribution
  occupiedVolume = CalculateOccupiedVolume(sensorData)
  pressureDistribution = AnalyzePressureDistribution(sensorData)

  // Calculate available volume and potential for rearrangement
  availableVolume = TotalHolderVolume - occupiedVolume
  rearrangementPotential = CalculateRearrangementPotential(itemDimensions, availableVolume)

  // Determine optimal geometry based on rearrangement potential and desired packing density
  IF rearrangementPotential > threshold AND desiredPackingDensity > currentPackingDensity:
    optimalGeometry = CalculateOptimalGeometry(itemDimensions, desiredPackingDensity)
    // Apply actuation signals to morph holder into optimal geometry
    ApplyActuationSignals(optimalGeometry)
  ELSE:
    //Maintain current geometry
    MaintainCurrentGeometry()
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Mobile Drive Unit Interaction:**

The mobile drive unit needs to be equipped with sensors to detect the holder’s current geometry. Before docking, the unit scans the holder to verify a secure connection. The unit’s control system adjusts its gripping mechanisms to conform to the holder's shape. The management module may request the holder to 'normalize' its geometry to a standard configuration for easier transport.
