## Dynamic Contextual Embedding for Product Discovery

**Concept:** Extend the n-gram-based product reference identification with dynamic contextual embeddings derived from surrounding text to improve accuracy and enable discovery of implied product references.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Input:** User-submitted content (text pages, community posts, etc.).
*   **Segmentation:** Divide content into logical segments â€“ paragraphs, sections, or even sentences. This is crucial for contextual understanding.
*   **N-gram Extraction:**  Maintain the existing n-gram extraction process.  Extract n-grams of varying lengths (e.g., 2-5 words).
*   **Context Window:** Define a context window around each n-gram. This window represents the surrounding text (e.g., 20-50 words before and after).

**2. Embedding Generation:**

*   **Model:** Employ a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, or similar transformer-based architecture). Fine-tune this model on a dataset of product descriptions and user-generated content related to product discussions.
*   **Embedding Creation:** For each n-gram, combine the n-gram itself with its context window. Pass this combined text through the fine-tuned language model to generate a contextual embedding vector. The embedding captures the semantic meaning of the n-gram within its surrounding context.
*   **Embedding Storage:** Store the contextual embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Annoy) for efficient similarity searches.

**3. Product Matching & Ranking:**

*   **Product Catalog Embedding:** Generate embeddings for all products in the product catalog using the *same* fine-tuned language model and a standardized product description format. Store these in the vector database alongside the contextual embeddings.
*   **Similarity Search:** When an n-gram is extracted, retrieve its contextual embedding from the vector database. Perform a nearest neighbor search in the vector database to find products with the most similar embeddings.
*   **Hybrid Scoring:** Combine the similarity score from the vector search with existing scoring methods (product catalog search, conditional probability from behavior-based data). Weight the contributions of each method to optimize performance.  Consider a weighted sum or a more sophisticated ensemble learning approach.
*   **Relevance Filtering:** Apply filters based on product attributes (category, price range, etc.) to narrow down the list of potential matches.
*   **Confidence Threshold:** Apply a confidence threshold to the final score. Only present products that exceed the threshold as potential references.

**4. Dynamic Adaptation:**

*   **User Feedback:** Collect user feedback on the accuracy of product references.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Utilize reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the weights in the hybrid scoring function based on user feedback.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Continuously update the fine-tuned language model with new user-generated content and product descriptions.



**Pseudocode:**

```
function identifyProductReferences(content):
  segments = segmentContent(content)
  potentialReferences = []

  for segment in segments:
    n_grams = extractNgrams(segment)
    for n_gram in n_grams:
      contextWindow = getContextWindow(n_gram, segment)
      combinedText = n_gram + " " + contextWindow
      embedding = generateEmbedding(combinedText)

      # Vector Search
      similarProducts = vectorSearch(embedding)

      # Hybrid Scoring
      score = hybridScore(similarProducts, n_gram, existingMethods())

      if score > confidenceThreshold:
        potentialReferences.append(similarProducts[0]) #top product

  return potentialReferences
```
