## Adaptive Step Size Modulation via Perceptual Audio Feature Correlation

**Concept:** Leverage perceptual audio features (e.g., spectral centroid, spectral flux, zero-crossing rate) *correlated* with adaptive coefficient magnitudes to dynamically modulate the step size – not just *based* on coefficient values, but on *how those values relate to perceived sound characteristics*.

**Specification:**

**I. System Components:**

*   **Acoustic Echo Canceller (AEC):** Standard adaptive filter implementation.
*   **Perceptual Feature Extractor:** A real-time DSP block capable of extracting relevant perceptual audio features from the *residual* signal (the difference between the input and the AEC’s echo estimate). Features:
    *   Spectral Centroid: Represents the ‘brightness’ of the sound.
    *   Spectral Flux: Measures the rate of change in the spectrum – indicating transient sounds.
    *   Zero-Crossing Rate: Approximation of frequency content.
*   **Correlation Engine:**  This block calculates the correlation between the magnitudes of the AEC adaptive coefficients (specifically, the "first set" from the original patent) and the extracted perceptual features.  This *isn’t* simply a linear correlation; a rolling window cross-correlation is preferred.  The window length should be adjustable (e.g., 10ms – 50ms).
*   **Step Size Modulation Unit:**  This unit receives the correlation coefficient(s) from the Correlation Engine and maps them to a step size adjustment. A non-linear mapping (e.g., a sigmoid function) is preferred to prevent extreme step size changes.
*   **Coefficient Adjustment Module:** Standard AEC update process, now utilizing the dynamically adjusted step size from the Step Size Modulation Unit.

**II. Algorithm & Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
window_length = 20ms;  // Adjustable
correlation_threshold = 0.5; //Adjustable
base_step_size = 0.001; //Initial Step Size

// Real-time processing loop
for each new audio frame:
    // 1. Extract perceptual features from residual audio
    spectral_centroid, spectral_flux, zero_crossing_rate = extract_features(residual_audio);

    // 2. Calculate Coefficient Magnitudes
    coefficient_magnitudes = abs(adaptive_coefficients);

    // 3. Rolling Window Cross-Correlation
    correlation = calculate_correlation(coefficient_magnitudes, [spectral_centroid, spectral_flux, zero_crossing_rate], window_length);

    // 4. Step Size Adjustment
    if correlation > correlation_threshold:
        step_size_multiplier = 1.2; //Increase step size
    else:
        step_size_multiplier = 0.8; // Decrease step size

    adjusted_step_size = base_step_size * step_size_multiplier;

    // 5. Update Adaptive Coefficients
    for each coefficient:
        adaptive_coefficient = adaptive_coefficient + adjusted_step_size * error_signal;
```

**III. Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Implementation can be done in DSP hardware (e.g., dedicated audio processing chips) or software (e.g., embedded systems, mobile devices).
*   The correlation calculation is computationally intensive. Efficient correlation algorithms (e.g., FFT-based methods) should be used.
*   Adjustable parameters (window length, correlation threshold, base step size) should be exposed for tuning and optimization.



**Novelty:**  This differs from the source patent by shifting the focus from *absolute* coefficient magnitudes to the *relationship* between those magnitudes and perceptually relevant sound characteristics.  It introduces a perceptual dimension to the step size control, potentially improving adaptation speed and stability in challenging acoustic environments (e.g., non-stationary noise, impulsive sounds). The idea moves away from purely mathematical metrics and towards auditory processing.
