## Dynamic Resource Swarm Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic pricing and incentive system to not just individual computing resources, but to *swarms* of resources – potentially heterogeneous – allocated dynamically to a customer based on predicted workload *shape* rather than just volume.

**Specification:**

**1. Workload Shape Profiling Module:**

*   **Input:** Customer application request (API call, job submission, etc.).
*   **Process:** Analyze request metadata (e.g., expected CPU/memory/IO patterns, dependencies, execution graph) to generate a “workload shape profile.” This profile is a multi-dimensional vector representing resource needs over time.  The time dimension is discretized (e.g., 1-minute intervals) to capture resource demands fluctuations.  Utilize machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks) trained on historical workload data to predict future resource needs based on request characteristics.
*   **Output:** Workload Shape Profile (WSP).

**2. Resource Swarm Catalog:**

*   Database of available computing resources, including:
    *   Resource Type (CPU, GPU, memory, storage, specialized hardware)
    *   Capacity
    *   Performance Characteristics (benchmarks)
    *   Cost per unit time
    *   Location (network latency considerations)
    *   Current Utilization
*   Resources can be virtualized, physical, or a combination.
*   Resources are categorized into "swarm templates" - pre-defined configurations for specific workload types.

**3. Swarm Allocation Engine:**

*   **Input:** WSP, Resource Swarm Catalog, Current System Load, Customer Budget.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Matching:** Identify potential swarm configurations from the catalog that *best* match the WSP. Utilize a cost function (minimize mismatch between WSP and available resources, maximize resource utilization, stay within budget).
    *   **Dynamic Provisioning:**  Instantiate or allocate the identified resources (e.g., spin up VMs, allocate GPU time).
    *   **Orchestration:** Assign workload tasks to specific resources within the swarm, ensuring data locality and minimizing communication overhead.
*   **Output:** Active Resource Swarm.

**4. Incentive Layer (Extension of Original Patent):**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor resource utilization within the swarm.
*   **Dynamic Pricing/Incentives:**
    *   If swarm utilization is below predicted levels, offer customers incentives to shift workloads or increase resource requests. Incentives can include cost reductions, priority access, or expanded features.
    *   If swarm utilization is near capacity, dynamically increase pricing to incentivize customers to optimize their resource usage or schedule workloads during off-peak hours.
*   **Incentive Notification:** Deliver incentives to customers via a web service API or push notifications.

**5.  Swarm Evolution Module:**

*   **Real-time Adaptation:**  Monitor the performance of the allocated swarm.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:**
    *   If a resource fails or becomes overloaded, automatically reallocate tasks to other available resources within the swarm.
    *   If the workload shape changes during execution, dynamically adjust the swarm configuration (e.g., add or remove resources, change resource types).
*   **Learning:** Use machine learning to improve swarm allocation and reconfiguration strategies over time.  Track performance metrics (e.g., completion time, cost, resource utilization) to identify optimal configurations for different workload types.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Allocation Engine):**

```
function allocate_swarm(WSP, Catalog, SystemLoad, Budget):
  potential_swarms = find_matching_swarms(WSP, Catalog)
  filtered_swarms = filter_by_budget(potential_swarms, Budget)
  optimal_swarm = select_best_swarm(filtered_swarms, SystemLoad)
  provision_resources(optimal_swarm)
  return optimal_swarm
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond simply incentivizing use of *individual* resources to incentivizing the efficient utilization of dynamically assembled *swarms* of resources, tailored to the shape of the workload. This addresses the complexity of modern applications with fluctuating and heterogeneous resource demands. The swarm evolution module provides self-healing and adaptive capabilities.
