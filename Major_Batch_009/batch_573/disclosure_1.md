## Adaptive Privilege Escalation Based on Biometric & Behavioral Analysis

**Specification:** A system that dynamically adjusts account privileges *during* a cool-down period, not just restricting or granting full access, leveraging biometric and behavioral data analysis.  This goes beyond simple time-based cool-downs or reset verification.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of a binary "restricted/unrestricted" state during a cool-down, assess the user’s legitimacy *in real-time* via continuous biometric & behavioral authentication.  If the analysis strongly suggests the genuine user, *temporarily* grant access to specific, less sensitive privileges.  

**Components:**

*   **Biometric Sensor Integration:** System supports integration with device-native biometric sensors (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint) *and* passively collected behavioral data.
*   **Behavioral Data Collection:**  Monitor typing cadence, mouse movement patterns, scrolling speed, application usage frequency, common navigation pathways, and other user interaction metrics.
*   **Real-time Authentication Engine:**  Machine learning model trained on authenticated user behavior. Continuously evaluates biometric and behavioral data against the established baseline for the user. Outputs a “trust score” (0-100).
*   **Privilege Mapping Table:**  Defines a tiered structure of account privileges, each mapped to a minimum required trust score. Example: 
    *   View account balance: Trust Score 60+
    *   Initiate small transactions (<$50): Trust Score 75+
    *   Change address/financial instrument: Trust Score 95+ (Requires full verification).
*   **Dynamic Privilege Manager:**  Responsible for granting/denying access to privileges based on the *current* trust score.
*   **Adaptive Cool-Down Adjuster:**  Modifies the remaining cool-down time based on trust score. High and consistent trust scores shorten the remaining cool-down; low scores extend it.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION HandleCredentialReset(userID, resetRequestInfo):
  SET UserStatus = "CoolDown"
  SET CoolDownStartTime = NOW()
  SET InitialCoolDownDuration = 600  // seconds (10 minutes)
  SET RemainingCoolDownTime = InitialCoolDownDuration
  
  WHILE UserStatus == "CoolDown":
    TrustScore = GetTrustScore(userID)  // Based on Biometric/Behavioral analysis
    
    IF TrustScore >= 60:
      AllowAccess("View Account Balance")
      AllowAccess("View Transaction History")
      
    IF TrustScore >= 75:
      AllowAccess("One-Click Transactions" < $50)
    
    IF TrustScore < 40:
      ExtendCoolDownTime(60) // extend by 60 seconds
    
    RemainingCoolDownTime = RemainingCoolDownTime - 1
    
    IF RemainingCoolDownTime <= 0 OR ResetVerificationReceived():
        UserStatus = "Active"
        AllowAllPrivileges()
        
    SLEEP(1) // check every second
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserBehaviorProfile`:  Stores historical biometric and behavioral data for each user.
*   `PrivilegeTier`:  Defines a privilege, its risk level, and minimum required Trust Score.
*   `TrustScore`:  A floating-point number (0-100) representing the user's legitimacy.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Protect UserBehaviorProfile data with strong encryption.
*   Implement safeguards against biometric spoofing.
*   Monitor for anomalies in behavioral data that may indicate malicious activity.
*   The system must be resilient to replay attacks.
