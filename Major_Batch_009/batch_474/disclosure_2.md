## Dynamic Partition Sharding based on Query Load Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the database partition splitting mechanism to proactively shard partitions *before* performance degradation occurs, driven by predicted query load, not just reactive splitting based on size or operation rate. This moves beyond simple rebalancing to anticipatory sharding.

**Specifications:**

**1. Query Load Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical query logs (timestamp, query type, involved tables/partitions, estimated resource consumption), current system load (CPU, memory, disk I/O), external event feeds (e.g., scheduled reports, marketing campaign launches).
*   **Processing:** Employ time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future query load for each partition. Model selection is dynamic, based on the historical data characteristics of each partition.
*   **Output:** Predicted query load (requests per second, estimated resource consumption) for each partition, with confidence intervals.  A 'Shardability Score' is generated for each partition.  Higher scores indicate a greater need for proactive sharding.

**2. Shardability Score Calculation:**

*   **Formula:** `Shardability Score = (Predicted Load / Partition Capacity) * (Confidence Interval Width) * (Criticality Factor)`
    *   `Predicted Load`:  From the Query Load Prediction Module.
    *   `Partition Capacity`:  Maximum sustainable load for the partition (determined through benchmarking).
    *   `Confidence Interval Width`: Represents the uncertainty in the load prediction.  Wider intervals increase the score.
    *   `Criticality Factor`:  A configurable weight based on the importance of the data within the partition. Higher criticality = higher weight.

**3. Automated Sharding Trigger:**

*   **Threshold:** A configurable threshold for the Shardability Score. When a partition’s score exceeds this threshold, a sharding process is initiated.
*   **Sharding Strategy Selection:** Based on the type of data and query patterns:
    *   **Hash Sharding:** If queries primarily involve key lookups.
    *   **Range Sharding:** If queries primarily involve range scans.
    *   **Hybrid Sharding:** If queries exhibit both types of patterns.
*   **Split Point Determination:** Utilize the existing median-finding logic, but incorporate the 'Hybrid Sharding' strategy – dynamically determine whether to split based on median or range bounds to optimize for predicted query distribution.

**4.  Data Migration & Validation:**

*   **Online Migration:** Perform data migration to the new shards *while* the original shard remains active. Utilize a technique like consistent hashing or a shadow table approach to minimize disruption.
*   **Validation:** After migration, automatically run a suite of validation queries against both the original and new shards to ensure data consistency and query correctness.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**  Implement a robust rollback mechanism in case of migration failures or data inconsistencies.

**5.  Dynamic Adjustment & Learning:**

*   **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of the sharded partitions (query latency, throughput, resource utilization).
*   **Feedback Loop:** Feed the performance data back into the Query Load Prediction Module to refine the forecasting models and improve the accuracy of future predictions.
*   **Auto-tuning:**  Automatically adjust the sharding thresholds, split point selection strategies, and migration parameters based on the observed performance data.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
WHILE TRUE DO
    // 1. Collect Data
    queryLogs = GetQueryLogs()
    systemLoad = GetSystemLoad()
    externalEvents = GetExternalEvents()

    // 2. Predict Load
    predictedLoad = PredictQueryLoad(queryLogs, systemLoad, externalEvents)

    // 3. Calculate Shardability Score
    shardabilityScore = CalculateShardabilityScore(predictedLoad)

    // 4. Check Threshold
    IF shardabilityScore > threshold THEN
        // 5. Initiate Sharding
        InitiateSharding(partition)
    ENDIF

    // 6. Monitor Performance
    performanceData = MonitorPartitionPerformance()
    UpdatePredictionModels(performanceData)

    SLEEP(interval)
ENDWHILE
```

This system goes beyond reactive splitting to *proactive* sharding, driven by predictive analytics and a continuous feedback loop. This should minimize performance degradation and ensure optimal database performance even under fluctuating workloads.
