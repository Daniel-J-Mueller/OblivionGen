## Hierarchical Data Attestation with Bloom Filters

**Concept:** Extend the journaled database with hierarchical nodes to include Bloom filters alongside hash values. This allows for efficient probabilistic data attestation *without* requiring full data retrieval.

**Specification:**

1.  **Node Structure:** Modify the node structure within the journal's hierarchy. Each node will now contain:
    *   `hash_value`:  As defined in the original patent.
    *   `bloom_filter`: A Bloom filter representing the *keys* of the entries (or a subset of keys) covered by that node’s subtree.
    *   `filter_size`: Integer defining the size (in bits) of the Bloom filter.
    *   `hash_count`: Integer defining the number of hash functions used within the Bloom filter.

2.  **Bloom Filter Population:**  
    *   During entry storage, populate Bloom filters at each node as data is added.
    *   Leaf nodes will have Bloom filters representing the keys of the entries they reference.
    *   Parent nodes will merge (using a bitwise OR operation) the Bloom filters of their children. This ensures the parent’s Bloom filter represents the union of keys in its entire subtree.

3.  **Attestation Procedure:**
    *   To attest to the existence of a specific key within the journal:
        1.  Start at the root node.
        2.  Check if the key is *potentially* present by probing the root node’s Bloom filter.
        3.  If the key is not present, it does not exist in the journal.  Terminate the attestation.
        4.  If the key is potentially present, traverse down the hierarchy (following a predetermined path – e.g., based on the key's hash) towards the relevant leaf node.
        5.  At each node along the path, probe the Bloom filter. If the key is not present in any Bloom filter along the path, terminate the attestation.
        6.  Reach the leaf node. Verify the leaf node’s reference to the entry.

4.  **Path Construction:** The path through the hierarchy used for attestation can be determined by a cryptographic commitment to the key, ensuring the same key always maps to the same path, providing non-repudiation.  This can be implemented using a Merkle-Damgård construction applied to the key.

**Pseudocode (Attestation):**

```
function attestKey(key, rootNode):
  path = constructPath(key, rootNode) // Returns list of nodes from root to leaf
  for node in path:
    if not keyPresentInBloomFilter(key, node.bloom_filter, node.filter_size, node.hash_count):
      return False // Key not present
  leafNode = path[-1]
  if leafNode.reference != null:
    // Verify entry referenced by leaf node
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Bloom filter size and hash count should be tuned based on the desired false positive rate and the number of keys being stored.
*   The path construction algorithm should be deterministic to ensure consistent attestation.
*   This can be combined with cryptographic signatures on each node for enhanced security.
*   Bloom filters are probabilistic; false positives are possible, but the false positive rate can be controlled by adjusting the filter parameters.
