## Adaptive Quorum Sizing Based on Network Latency & Node Health

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the size of the locality-based failover quorum (N-K+1) *in real-time* based on observed network latency between nodes and individual node health metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O). This moves beyond a statically configured quorum size, making the system more resilient to transient network issues and failing nodes.

**Specifications:**

*   **Monitoring Agent:** Each node runs a lightweight monitoring agent that collects:
    *   Round Trip Time (RTT) to all other nodes.
    *   CPU utilization, memory pressure, and disk I/O rates.
    *   Node status (online/offline, degraded performance flags).
*   **Quorum Manager:** A dedicated service (can be distributed) responsible for:
    *   Aggregating monitoring data from all nodes.
    *   Calculating a "network health score" for each node based on RTT to a majority of other nodes. Lower RTT = higher score.
    *   Calculating a "node health score" based on CPU, memory, and disk I/O.
    *   Deriving an "effective quorum size" for each write operation.
*   **Effective Quorum Size Calculation:**
    *   Base Quorum: Start with the statically configured N-K+1.
    *   Latency Adjustment:
        *   If the average RTT to nodes *above* a certain threshold (e.g., 5ms) exceeds a configured limit, *increase* the quorum size by +1.  This ensures more nodes acknowledge the write despite potential network delays. Cap this increase at a reasonable value (e.g., +3).
        *   If the average RTT is consistently *below* a threshold (e.g., 1ms), *decrease* the quorum size by -1.  Faster network implies less need for a large quorum.
    *   Node Health Adjustment:
        *   If a significant number of nodes have consistently high resource utilization (CPU > 80%, Memory > 90%), *increase* the quorum size by +1. This provides more redundancy and reduces the impact of a failing node.
        *   If node health is consistently good, maintain the base quorum size.

*   **Write Protocol Modification:**
    *   Before initiating a write, the Quorum Manager determines the effective quorum size for that *specific* write operation.
    *   The write request is then sent to the calculated number of nodes.
    *   The write is considered successful only after receiving acknowledgements from the required number of nodes.

**Pseudocode (Quorum Manager):**

```
function calculateEffectiveQuorumSize(baseQuorum, monitoringData):
  latencyScore = calculateLatencyScore(monitoringData)
  nodeHealthScore = calculateNodeHealthScore(monitoringData)

  effectiveQuorum = baseQuorum

  if latencyScore > LATENCY_THRESHOLD:
    effectiveQuorum += 1
  elif latencyScore < LATENCY_THRESHOLD_LOW:
    effectiveQuorum -= 1

  if nodeHealthScore > HEALTH_THRESHOLD:
    effectiveQuorum += 1

  #Ensure quorum size doesn't fall below a minimum value (e.g., 2) or exceed a maximum value (e.g., N)
  effectiveQuorum = clamp(effectiveQuorum, MIN_QUORUM, N)

  return effectiveQuorum
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `NodeStats`: {nodeId, latencyScore, healthScore}
*   `MonitoringData`: [NodeStats]

**Benefits:**

*   **Increased Resilience:** Adapts to changing network and node conditions.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Reduces latency when network conditions are good.
*   **Automatic Adjustment:** No manual configuration required.
*   **Dynamic Redundancy:** Provides greater protection against node failures.
