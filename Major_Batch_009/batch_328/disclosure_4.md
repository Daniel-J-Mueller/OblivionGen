## Bloom Filter Swarm with Dynamic Specialization

**Concept:** Instead of maintaining a small pool of Bloom filters and switching between them, maintain a *large*, distributed “swarm” of Bloom filters, each specializing in a narrow subset of the overall data space. This specialization isn't pre-defined; it *emerges* based on observed query patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Swarm Size:** Initial swarm size = 1024 Bloom filters. Scalable up or down dynamically.
*   **Bloom Filter Parameters:** Each Bloom filter in the swarm uses identical base parameters (bit array size, number of hash functions).
*   **Data Partitioning:** Data is *not* explicitly partitioned. All data items are hashed and potentially inserted into *all* Bloom filters in the swarm. (See 'Adaptive Weighting' below)
*   **Adaptive Weighting:**  Each Bloom filter maintains a ‘weight’ value. When a lookup request arrives:
    1.  Hash the record identifier.
    2.  Evaluate all Bloom filters in the swarm.
    3.  Calculate a weighted score based on the Bloom filter's response (positive or negative) *and* its current weight.
    4.  Combine these weighted scores to generate a final “potential existence” score.
*   **Feedback Loop & Weight Adjustment:**
    1.  Upon receiving feedback (record exists/doesn’t exist), adjust the weights of the Bloom filters that participated in the lookup.
    2.  Bloom filters that returned a correct answer (positive & record exists, or negative & record doesn’t) have their weight *increased*.
    3.  Bloom filters that returned an incorrect answer (false positive or false negative) have their weight *decreased*.
    4.  Weight adjustments are performed using a learning rate parameter to control the speed of adaptation.
*   **Bloom Filter Pruning & Reproduction:**
    1.  Periodically evaluate Bloom filter weights.
    2.  Remove filters with consistently low weights (low contribution to accurate lookups).
    3.  Reproduce new filters by cloning high-performing filters with slight parameter variations (different seed values for hash functions) to encourage diversity and exploration.
*   **Query Distribution:** Queries are not directed to specific filters. All filters participate in every lookup. The weighted scores determine the overall likelihood of existence.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Swarm management and weight updates can be implemented as a distributed microservice.
    *   Bloom filters can be stored in a distributed key-value store or in memory for performance.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Weight Update):**

```
function update_weights(feedback, filter_results, learning_rate):
  for filter in filter_results:
    if feedback == EXISTS and filter.result == EXISTS:
      filter.weight += learning_rate  # Correct positive
    elif feedback == DOES_NOT_EXIST and filter.result == DOES_NOT_EXIST:
      filter.weight += learning_rate  # Correct negative
    else:
      filter.weight -= learning_rate # Incorrect response

  # Normalize weights to prevent runaway values
  normalize_weights(weights)

function normalize_weights(weights):
  total_weight = sum(weights)
  for i in range(len(weights)):
    weights[i] = weights[i] / total_weight
```

**Novelty:** This differs from existing dynamic Bloom filter approaches by eschewing explicit data partitioning and instead relying on *emergent* specialization driven by query patterns and a continuous feedback loop. The swarm architecture provides inherent redundancy and adaptability, while the weight adjustment mechanism allows the system to “learn” which filters are most effective for different types of queries. The continuous reproduction/pruning mechanism ensures that the swarm remains diverse and responsive to changing data characteristics.
