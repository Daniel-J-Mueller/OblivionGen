## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Personalized Command Routing

**Concept:** Extend the multi-device arbitration beyond simple energy level comparison to create dynamically adjusted acoustic zones within a conference space, coupled with personalized command routing based on user voiceprints and proximity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Microphone Array:** High-density microphone array (minimum 16 microphones) deployed within the conference room. Resolution sufficient to pinpoint sound source location with centimeter accuracy.
*   **Speaker Array:** Distributed speaker array for localized audio playback and potential acoustic masking.
*   **Voiceprint Database:** Secure storage for authorized user voiceprints.
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** Dedicated processor for real-time audio processing, voiceprint recognition, and zone management.
*   **Network Connectivity:** Reliable network connection for communication with central server and voice-enabled devices.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:**
    *   Utilizes microphone array data to create a real-time acoustic map of the conference room.
    *   Identifies sound sources (speakers) and their locations.
    *   Divides the room into dynamic acoustic zones based on sound source proximity and ambient noise levels.
*   **Voiceprint Recognition Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors audio input and identifies speaking users based on voiceprints.
    *   Maintains a user activity log, noting who is speaking and for how long.
*   **Command Routing Engine:**
    *   Receives voice commands from any connected voice-enabled device.
    *   Determines the originating speaker using voiceprint recognition.
    *   Associates the command with the acoustic zone of the speaker.
    *   Routes the command *only* to devices within that zone (or to a designated 'master' device if no zone-specific device is available).
*   **Adaptive Noise Cancellation:**
    *   Utilizes the acoustic map and speaker location data to implement targeted noise cancellation.
    *   Focuses on suppressing noise *outside* the current speaker’s zone, enhancing clarity for those within.
*   **Command Conflict Resolution (Enhanced):**
    *   Extends the original patent’s energy level comparison with zone-based prioritization.
    *   If multiple devices detect a command, the device within the speaker’s zone has highest priority.
    *   Introduces a “command lock” system – once a device successfully executes a command, other devices are temporarily blocked from executing the same command.

**3. System Operation:**

1.  **Initialization:** Microphone array calibrates and creates a baseline acoustic map of the room. User voiceprints are loaded into the system.
2.  **Monitoring:** System continuously monitors audio input, identifying speakers and their locations. Acoustic zones are dynamically adjusted based on speaker movements and noise conditions.
3.  **Command Reception:** A voice-enabled device receives a command.
4.  **Speaker Identification:** System identifies the originating speaker using voiceprint recognition.
5.  **Zone Determination:**  The system maps the speaker to their current acoustic zone.
6.  **Command Routing:** The command is routed *only* to devices within that zone.
7.  **Conflict Resolution:** If a conflict arises, zone-based priority and the command lock system are used to determine which device executes the command.

**4. Pseudocode - Command Routing:**

```
FUNCTION RouteCommand(command, sourceDevice, speakerID)

  zone = GetSpeakerZone(speakerID)
  devicesInZone = GetDevicesInZone(zone)

  IF devicesInZone is not empty THEN
    targetDevice = SelectDeviceFromList(devicesInZone) //Prioritize specific device types if needed
    SendCommandToDevice(command, targetDevice)
    LogCommandExecution(command, speakerID, targetDevice)
  ELSE
    //No device in zone - route to master device or designated default
    SendToMasterDevice(command)
  ENDIF

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION GetSpeakerZone(speakerID)
  //Process audio from microphones to determine speaker's location
  //Return the zone ID corresponding to the speaker's location
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION GetDevicesInZone(zoneID)
  //Query the system to retrieve a list of devices located within the specified zone
  //Return the list of devices
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced video conferencing in large meeting rooms.
*   Smart office spaces with personalized control over audio and video.
*   Hands-free control of devices in noisy environments.
*   Improved accessibility for users with hearing impairments.
