**Adaptive Power Distribution with Predictive Failure Mitigation**

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond configuration validation to *predictive* power distribution adjustments based on component health monitoring and learned usage patterns, creating a self-optimizing and resilient power infrastructure.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Component Health Monitoring:**
    *   Each PSU, BBU, and critical connection component (whip) integrates a micro-controller with embedded sensors (voltage, current, temperature, impedance).
    *   Sensors transmit data via a dedicated, low-bandwidth communication bus (e.g., Modbus, CAN) to the PSC.
    *   Data is timestamped and logged.
    *   Establish baseline operational parameters for each component during initial deployment (learning phase).

2.  **AI-Powered Predictive Analytics:**
    *   PSC integrates a lightweight, edge-based AI model (e.g., LSTM, anomaly detection algorithm).
    *   AI model is trained on historical sensor data and server rack usage patterns.
    *   Model predicts potential component failures based on subtle deviations from baseline parameters.
    *   Prediction confidence levels are generated.

3.  **Dynamic Power Allocation:**
    *   Based on prediction confidence and severity of potential failure, the PSC dynamically adjusts power allocation.
    *   If a PSU is predicted to fail:
        *   Increase load on healthy PSUs incrementally.
        *   Reduce load on the potentially failing PSU.
        *   Prioritize critical server components for continued power delivery.
    *   Load balancing is performed in real-time to prevent overloading healthy components.
    *   The system aims to maintain *graceful degradation* rather than sudden failure.

4.  **Proactive Maintenance Alerts:**
    *   Based on predicted failure probabilities and component health metrics, the PSC generates proactive maintenance alerts.
    *   Alerts include:
        *   Component ID
        *   Predicted time to failure
        *   Recommended maintenance action (e.g., replacement)
        *   Impact assessment (e.g., potential downtime)
    *   Alerts are transmitted to a central management module via a secure network connection.

5.  **Feedback Loop & Model Refinement:**
    *   The system logs all adjustments made to power allocation and the actual outcomes (e.g., component failure, successful mitigation).
    *   This data is used to retrain the AI model, improving its accuracy and predictive capabilities over time.
    *   A cloud-based platform facilitates model sharing and updates across multiple data centers.

**Pseudocode (PSC Logic):**

```
loop:
    receive sensor data from components
    calculate component health scores
    run AI model to predict potential failures
    if failure predicted:
        confidence = AI model output
        if confidence > threshold:
            adjust power allocation:
                reduce load on failing PSU
                increase load on healthy PSUs
                prioritize critical servers
            generate maintenance alert
            log adjustments and outcomes
    else:
        maintain current power allocation
    end
```
