**Adaptive Prefetching with Content-Aware Quality Scaling**

**Specification:**

**I. System Overview:**

The system extends the concept of local caching, but moves beyond simply caching lower-quality versions. It aims to predictively cache *multiple* quality levels of video segments, and dynamically switch between them based on real-time network conditions *and* user viewing patterns. This is driven by a central 'Quality Prediction Engine'.

**II. Core Components:**

*   **Content Analyzer:**  Analyzes incoming video streams (or metadata) to identify visually complex segments (high motion, detailed textures). Assigns a 'visual complexity score' to each segment.
*   **Network Condition Monitor:** Tracks bandwidth, latency, and packet loss. Provides a 'network health score'.
*   **User Behavior Analyzer:** Monitors viewing habits â€“ buffering frequency, playback pauses, seeking behavior.  Develops a 'user sensitivity score'.
*   **Quality Prediction Engine (QPE):** The core.  Combines data from the Content Analyzer, Network Condition Monitor, and User Behavior Analyzer.  Uses a weighted formula (weights configurable via UI) to predict the optimal quality level for each upcoming video segment.
*   **Multi-Quality Cache:** Stores multiple versions (e.g., 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) of video segments.
*   **Adaptive Streaming Client:**  Resides on the client device. Requests video segments from the Multi-Quality Cache (or remote server if not cached). Prioritizes segments predicted by the QPE.

**III. Algorithm (Simplified Pseudocode - QPE):**

```
function predict_quality(segment_id):
  complexity_score = ContentAnalyzer.get_complexity(segment_id)
  network_health = NetworkConditionMonitor.get_health()
  user_sensitivity = UserBehaviorAnalyzer.get_sensitivity()

  // Configurable weights (adjustable via UI)
  weight_complexity = 0.3
  weight_network = 0.5
  weight_user = 0.2

  quality_score = (weight_complexity * complexity_score) + (weight_network * network_health) + (weight_user * user_sensitivity)

  // Map quality_score to available quality levels
  if quality_score > 0.8:
    return "1080p"
  elif quality_score > 0.6:
    return "720p"
  elif quality_score > 0.4:
    return "480p"
  else:
    return "360p"
```

**IV.  Caching Strategy:**

*   **Predictive Caching:**  Cache multiple quality levels of upcoming segments *before* they are requested.
*   **Dynamic Prioritization:**  Prioritize caching of segments with high visual complexity or predicted low network conditions.
*   **Least Recently Used (LRU) Eviction:**  Evict least recently used segments to free up space.
*   **Proactive Re-Caching:**  If network conditions improve after a low-quality segment is served, proactively re-cache a higher-quality version.

**V.  User Interface (UI) Elements:**

*   **Quality Weight Adjustment:**  Sliders to adjust the weights for complexity, network health, and user sensitivity.
*   **Cache Size Limit:**  Configuration option to set the maximum cache size.
*   **Real-Time Monitoring:**  Display of current network conditions, user sensitivity, and cache hit rate.
*   **Manual Override:**  Option to manually select the desired quality level.
