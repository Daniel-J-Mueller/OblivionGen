## Adaptive Password Complexity based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust password complexity requirements *not* based on static account thresholds or breach data, but on real-time behavioral biometrics of the user *during* login attempts.  This creates a ‘moving target’ for attackers and minimizes user friction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate with device sensors (keyboard dynamics, mouse movements, touch screen pressure, gait analysis via mobile device accelerometer – if applicable).
*   **Data Points:** Capture:
    *   Keypress dwell time (time between key presses)
    *   Keypress velocity (speed of typing)
    *   Inter-key timing variance
    *   Mouse acceleration/deceleration
    *   Swipe speed and pressure (touchscreen)
    *   Gait patterns (mobile – optional)
*   **Frequency:** Sample data points continuously during login attempt *prior* to password entry.
*   **Normalization:** Normalize all data streams to account for device variations and user habits.

**2. Behavioral Profile Creation & Maintenance Module:**

*   **Baseline Establishment:** During initial account setup and subsequent ‘training’ periods (user prompted), establish a behavioral baseline for each user. This profile stores average values and standard deviations for all captured data points.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update the baseline over time, weighting recent behavior more heavily than older behavior. Use a rolling average or exponential smoothing.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Calculate a ‘behavioral distance’ score during each login attempt – a weighted sum of the deviations from the established baseline for each data point.
*   **Profile Segmentation:** Segment behavioral profiles by user roles or risk profiles (e.g., standard user vs. administrator) for tailored security levels.

**3. Adaptive Complexity Engine:**

*   **Complexity Levels:** Define a tiered system of password complexity requirements (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
*   **Thresholds:** Associate each complexity level with a range of behavioral distance scores.
*   **Real-Time Adjustment:** During login, the behavioral distance score determines the required complexity:
    *   **Low Score (Normal Behavior):** Allow simpler passwords (shorter length, fewer special characters).
    *   **Medium Score (Slight Deviation):**  Increase password length requirement or add one special character requirement.
    *   **High Score (Significant Deviation):** Require a longer, more complex password with multiple special characters or a challenge question.
*   **Challenge Mechanism:** If behavioral deviation is extreme, trigger a multi-factor authentication challenge (e.g., SMS code, authenticator app).
*   **Progressive Difficulty:** For repeated failed attempts, progressively increase the complexity requirement or lock the account.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side Agent:** Lightweight agent on client device to collect behavioral data.
*   **Secure Communication:** Encrypt all data transmission between client and server.
*   **Server-Side Processing:** Secure server to store behavioral profiles, calculate behavioral distance, and enforce complexity rules.
*   **API Integration:** API for integration with existing authentication systems and password managers.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function authenticate(user, password) {
  behavioralData = getBehavioralData();
  behavioralDistance = calculateBehavioralDistance(behavioralData, user.profile);
  complexityLevel = determineComplexityLevel(behavioralDistance);

  if (passwordMeetsComplexity(password, complexityLevel)) {
    if (verifyPassword(user, password)) {
      return SUCCESS;
    } else {
      return INVALID_PASSWORD;
    }
  } else {
    return INSUFFICIENT_COMPLEXITY;
  }
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** Use machine learning to detect more subtle deviations from normal behavior.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Consider external factors like location, time of day, and device used when determining complexity.
*   **Passwordless Authentication Integration:**  Combine behavioral biometrics with passwordless authentication methods for enhanced security and usability.
