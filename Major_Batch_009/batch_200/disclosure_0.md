## Temporal Data Weaving for Predictive Analytics

**Concept:** Extend the “restore to a previous state” capability to not just replay historical database states for querying, but to *weave* together multiple historical states, weighted by predictive models, to generate a probabilistic “future state” for advanced analytics and forecasting.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structure – Temporal Layers:**

*   Introduce a "Temporal Layer" abstraction. Each layer represents a snapshot of the database at a specific point in time (as currently stored).
*   Extend the data store to include metadata for each Temporal Layer:
    *   Timestamp
    *   "Weight" – a floating-point value representing the layer's contribution to the woven future state (initialized to 0).
    *   Associated Predictive Model ID – links the layer to a trained model.
    *   Data Version – a hash of the layer’s data to ensure integrity.

**2. Predictive Model Integration:**

*   A dedicated "Predictive Model Manager" component.
*   Supports diverse machine learning algorithms (time series forecasting, regression, classification).
*   Models are trained on historical database data, using designated "feature" columns.
*   Each model outputs a probability distribution or a predicted value for specific database attributes.
*   Models are versioned and stored alongside their associated Temporal Layers.

**3. Temporal Weaving Process:**

*   A new "Weave Request" type, initiated by a user or automated job.
*   The request specifies:
    *   Target Future Time – the point in time for which the future state is being predicted.
    *   Weaving Horizon – the length of time into the future to predict.
    *   Target Database Attributes – the specific columns to predict.
    *   Weighting Strategy – (e.g., “equal weighting,” “model-driven weighting,” “time-decay weighting”).
*   The "Temporal Weaver" component performs the following steps:
    1.  Identifies relevant Temporal Layers based on the Target Future Time and Weaving Horizon.  Layers outside of the defined range are excluded.
    2.  For each relevant layer:
        *   Loads the layer’s data.
        *   Applies the associated Predictive Model to predict the values of the Target Database Attributes.
        *   Calculates the layer’s weight based on the specified Weighting Strategy.
    3.  Combines the predicted values from all layers, weighted by their respective weights, to generate a composite “Future State” for the Target Database Attributes.
    4.  The Future State is presented as a virtual database view or materialized as a new table.

**4. Querying the Future State:**

*   Standard SQL queries can be executed against the virtualized Future State view.
*   The query engine transparently interprets the query against the woven data, combining values from the various Temporal Layers.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Weaving Process):**

```
function weaveFutureState(targetTime, horizon, attributes, strategy):
  layers = getRelevantLayers(targetTime, horizon)
  predictions = []
  for layer in layers:
    model = getModelForLayer(layer)
    prediction = model.predict(layer.data, attributes)
    weight = calculateWeight(layer, strategy)
    predictions.append((prediction, weight))

  compositePrediction = combinePredictions(predictions)
  return compositePrediction
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond simple historical replay to create a predictive analytics platform built directly on the database's historical data. It allows businesses to anticipate future trends, optimize operations, and make data-driven decisions with a higher degree of accuracy. It provides a foundational layer for “what-if” analysis and scenario planning. The platform is not simply a ‘replay’ function, it is a fully-fledged predictive system.
