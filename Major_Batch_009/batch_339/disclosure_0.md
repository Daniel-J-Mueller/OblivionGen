## Dynamic Data Sharding based on Read Request Frequency

**Concept:** Extend the read-only node system by dynamically sharding data based on the frequency of read requests for specific data segments. This creates a tiered read system where frequently accessed data resides on faster, more readily available nodes, while infrequently accessed data is stored on cheaper, slower storage.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** `Read Frequency Monitor` – a daemon running on each read-only node.
*   **Input:** All incoming read requests.
*   **Process:**
    *   Tracks the frequency of read requests for specific data segments (e.g., keys, ranges of keys).
    *   Maintains a rolling average of read frequency over a configurable time window.
    *   Categorizes data segments into tiers based on frequency: "Hot", "Warm", "Cold".
*   **Output:** Tier assignment for data segments, reported to `Data Shard Manager`.

*   **Component:** `Data Shard Manager` – A central service responsible for managing data distribution.
*   **Input:** Tier assignments from `Read Frequency Monitor`.
*   **Process:**
    *   Maintains a mapping of data segment tiers to physical storage nodes.
    *   Dynamically adjusts data replication based on tier assignment.
        *   "Hot" data: Replicated on multiple fast, low-latency nodes.
        *   "Warm" data: Replicated on a moderate number of standard nodes.
        *   "Cold" data: Replicated on fewer, cheaper storage nodes (potentially even object storage).
    *   Implements data migration policies for moving data between tiers.
*   **Output:** Data migration requests, replication instructions.

*   **Component:** `Read Request Interceptor` – Intercepts read requests *before* they reach the storage layer.
*   **Input:** Incoming read requests, current data tier mapping.
*   **Process:**
    *   Determines the tier of the requested data segment.
    *   Routes the request to the appropriate storage nodes based on tier.
*   **Output:** Forwarded read request.

**Pseudocode (Read Request Interceptor):**

```
function interceptReadRequest(request):
  dataSegment = extractDataSegment(request)
  tier = getDataTier(dataSegment)

  if tier == "Hot":
    storageNodes = getHotStorageNodes()
  elif tier == "Warm":
    storageNodes = getWarmStorageNodes()
  else:
    storageNodes = getColdStorageNodes()

  nextNode = selectNode(storageNodes) // Load balancing
  forwardRequest(request, nextNode)

```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DataTierMap`: Key-Value store mapping data segments to tiers (Hot, Warm, Cold).
*   `NodeList`: List of storage nodes, categorized by tier (Hot, Warm, Cold).

**Considerations:**

*   **Consistency:** Need to ensure data consistency during migration between tiers. Utilize strong consistency protocols or eventual consistency with conflict resolution.
*   **False Positives:** Transient spikes in read requests could cause incorrect tier assignments. Implement smoothing techniques (e.g., moving averages) to mitigate this.
*   **Metadata Management:** The `DataTierMap` itself must be highly available and consistent.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of data segments and storage nodes.
