## Automated Resource Dependency Graph & Proactive Role Suggestion

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Resource Dependency Analyzer (RDA) – a static analysis engine integrated into the code authoring environment.
*   **Data Storage:**  A graph database storing resource dependencies identified within code segments. Nodes represent resources (databases, APIs, files, etc.). Edges represent the type of access (read, write, execute).
*   **Role Suggestion Engine:** AI-powered component leveraging the dependency graph and a knowledge base of pre-defined roles/permissions.
*   **User Interface:**  Integrated within the code editor – displays dependency graph visualization, suggested roles, and potential security implications.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Dependency Extraction:** RDA parses code segments in real-time, identifying all accessed resources.  It creates nodes in the graph database for each resource, and edges representing access types.
2.  **Graph Visualization:** The UI displays a visual representation of the resource dependency graph for the current code segment.  Nodes are color-coded based on resource type.  Edges display access type and sensitivity level (e.g., critical, sensitive, public).
3.  **Role Suggestion:** The Role Suggestion Engine analyzes the dependency graph and queries its knowledge base for roles that match the required permissions.  It ranks suggested roles based on least privilege principle.
4.  **Proactive Warnings:** Before code is saved or deployed, the system displays warnings if:
    *   No matching role exists.
    *   Suggested role requires elevated privileges.
    *   Code accesses resources outside of defined organizational policies.
5.  **Automated Role Creation:**  With user approval, the system can automatically create new roles based on the dependency graph and least privilege principles.
6.  **Dynamic Role Update:** The system monitors changes to code segments and automatically updates the dependency graph and role suggestions.
7.  **Policy Enforcement:** Integrates with organizational security policies to ensure compliance.  Can block deployment of code that violates policies.
8.  **Simulation/Sandboxing:**  Ability to simulate code execution in a sandbox environment to identify potential security vulnerabilities before deployment.

**Pseudocode (Role Suggestion Engine):**

```
function suggestRoles(dependencyGraph) {
  // Query knowledge base for roles matching required permissions
  candidateRoles = knowledgeBase.findRoles(dependencyGraph)

  // Filter out roles with excessive permissions
  filteredRoles = filterRolesByLeastPrivilege(candidateRoles, dependencyGraph)

  // Rank roles based on least privilege principle
  rankedRoles = rankRolesByLeastPrivilege(filteredRoles)

  // Return top N ranked roles
  return rankedRoles
}

function filterRolesByLeastPrivilege(roles, dependencyGraph) {
  // Iterate through roles
  for each role in roles {
    // Check if role permissions exceed required permissions
    if (role.permissions > dependencyGraph.requiredPermissions) {
      // Remove role from list
      remove(role)
    }
  }
  return roles
}

function rankRolesByLeastPrivilege(roles) {
  // Sort roles based on number of permissions
  roles.sort(by permissions ascending)
  return roles
}
```

**Innovation:** This shifts the focus from *reacting* to code changes to *proactively* identifying resource dependencies and suggesting roles *before* code is committed. It moves beyond simple warnings and automates role creation based on least privilege principles. The dependency graph provides a powerful visualization and analysis tool for security engineers.
