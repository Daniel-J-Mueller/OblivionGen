## Dynamic Simulation Mesh Generation & Adaptive Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the Monte Carlo simulation framework to leverage a dynamically generated, adaptive resolution “mesh” representing the simulation space. This allows focusing computational effort on regions exhibiting high variance or sensitivity, improving efficiency and accuracy. The system would essentially learn where to refine its calculations *during* the simulation, unlike static mesh approaches.

**Specs:**

*   **Mesh Representation:**  The simulation space is discretized into a hierarchical mesh (octree, quadtree, etc.). Each node in the mesh represents a region of the input parameter space.
*   **Variance Tracking:**  During simulation runs, the system tracks the variance of the output distribution *within* each mesh node.  This is a core metric driving adaptation.
*   **Adaptive Refinement:**
    *   If the variance within a node exceeds a threshold, the node is subdivided, creating finer-resolution child nodes.
    *   Subdivision criteria:  Variance threshold, number of simulation samples within the node, and a cost function (computational expense of refinement vs. potential accuracy gain).
    *   Conversely, if the variance within a node falls below a threshold *and* the node has been subdivided, the node can be coarsened (merged with its siblings).
*   **Sampling Strategy:**  A dynamic sampling strategy biases sampling towards high-variance regions.  This could be implemented using weighted random sampling, where the weights are proportional to the variance of the node.
*   **Simulation Distribution:** The Monte Carlo simulation, when executed on a set of input parameters, distributes samples across the mesh.
*   **Parallelization:**  Mesh nodes can be assigned to different compute nodes for parallel processing.  The adaptive mesh structure enables dynamic load balancing, with more resources allocated to refining high-variance regions.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `MeshNode`:  Contains:
        *   `bounds`:  The spatial bounds of the node.
        *   `variance`:  The variance of the output distribution within the node.
        *   `sample_count`:  Number of simulation samples contributing to the variance.
        *   `children`:  Array of child `MeshNode` objects.
        *   `parent`: Pointer to parent `MeshNode`.
    *   `Mesh`: Contains a root `MeshNode` and functions for traversal, refinement, and coarsening.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function AdaptiveMonteCarloSimulation(template, runtime_parameters):
    mesh = CreateMesh(template.simulation_bounds)
    output_data = []

    for i in range(template.num_samples):
        node = SelectNodeForSampling(mesh, template.sampling_strategy) # Biased towards high variance
        sample_point = GenerateRandomPointWithinNode(node)
        output_value = RunSimulation(sample_point, runtime_parameters)

        UpdateNodeVariance(node, output_value)
        RefineOrCoarsenMesh(mesh) #Adaptive refinement/coarsening

        output_data.append(output_value)

    statistic = CalculateStatistic(output_data)
    return statistic
```

*   **I/O:**  The template would include parameters defining the initial mesh bounds, refinement thresholds, and sampling strategy. Output would be the statistic of the output distribution, as in the original patent.
*   **Potential Extensions:** Incorporate machine learning to *predict* high-variance regions *before* sampling, further optimizing the mesh adaptation process.  Allow the user to define regions of interest, forcing refinement in those areas.
