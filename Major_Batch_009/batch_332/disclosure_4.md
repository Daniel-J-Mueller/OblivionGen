## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Biofeedback Integration

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of dynamically switching microphones based on battery levels but expands it to create personalized acoustic zones around the user, adapting to both environmental context *and* the user’s physiological state. The goal is to optimize audio input quality and reduce cognitive load by prioritizing relevant sounds and filtering out distractions.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:**  The user device (phone, watch, etc.) and potentially several ‘satellite’ wearable devices (earbuds, necklace, glasses) each contain multiple microphones.
*   **Biofeedback Sensors:** Integrated heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), and potentially EEG sensors in wearable devices.
*   **Bone Conduction Transducers:** Integrated into earbuds/headphones for private audio feedback.
*   **Edge Processing Unit:** Low-power processor in the user device and wearables for real-time signal processing.
*   **Haptic Feedback Modules:** Integrated into wearables for subtle directional cues.

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Acoustic Mapping:**
    *   Real-time beamforming using the microphone array to create a 3D acoustic map of the user’s surroundings.
    *   Sound source localization and classification (speech, music, environmental noise).
    *   Acoustic event detection (e.g., car horn, baby crying, someone calling the user’s name).

2.  **Physiological State Assessment:**
    *   HRV analysis to determine stress, focus, and cognitive load levels.
    *   EDA analysis to detect emotional arousal and attention.
    *   Algorithm to correlate physiological states with optimal audio profiles.  Example: high stress/cognitive load -> prioritize clear speech, suppress background noise; focused/relaxed -> allow for ambient sound, emphasize music.

3.  **Adaptive Acoustic Zone Creation:**
    *   Algorithm to dynamically adjust beamforming parameters to create personalized ‘acoustic zones’ around the user.
    *   These zones can be:
        *   **Focused Zone:** Prioritizes sounds from a specific direction (e.g., the person speaking directly to the user).
        *   **Ambient Zone:** Allows for a wider range of sounds, but filters out harsh or distracting noises.
        *   **Silent Zone:**  Actively suppresses sounds from a specific direction or frequency range.
    *   Algorithm continuously adjusts zone parameters based on:
        *   Acoustic map.
        *   User’s physiological state.
        *   User preferences (defined in a settings menu).
        *   Contextual information (e.g., location, time of day).

4.  **Feedback Mechanisms:**
    *   **Bone Conduction Audio:** Provide subtle audio cues to indicate changes in acoustic zones or highlight important sounds. (e.g., a gentle tone when a speaker is emphasized).
    *   **Haptic Feedback:** Use directional haptic vibrations to guide the user’s attention to specific sound sources.
    *   **Visual Indicators (Optional):** Display a simplified representation of the acoustic zones on a smartwatch screen or AR glasses.

5.  **Battery Management:**
    *   Prioritize microphone usage based on battery levels.  As in the initial patent, switch to lower-power microphones if battery levels are low.
    *   Dynamically adjust the number of active microphones based on the complexity of the acoustic scene and the user’s activity.
    *   Utilize edge processing to reduce data transmission and conserve battery life.

**Pseudocode (Zone Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
function adjustAcousticZone(acousticMap, physiologicalState, userPreferences) {
  // Calculate attention level based on physiologicalState
  attentionLevel = calculateAttentionLevel(physiologicalState);

  // Determine desired zone type based on attentionLevel and userPreferences
  if (attentionLevel > 0.75) {
    zoneType = "Focused";
  } else if (attentionLevel > 0.5) {
    zoneType = "Ambient";
  } else {
    zoneType = "Silent";
  }

  // Identify dominant sound source from acousticMap
  dominantSource = identifyDominantSoundSource(acousticMap);

  // Adjust beamforming parameters based on zoneType and dominantSource
  if (zoneType == "Focused") {
    beamformingParameters = focusOn(dominantSource);
  } else if (zoneType == "Ambient") {
    beamformingParameters = createAmbientZone();
  } else {
    beamformingParameters = suppressAllSounds();
  }

  // Apply beamforming parameters to microphone array
  applyBeamforming(beamformingParameters);

  // Provide feedback to user (audio, haptic, visual)
  provideFeedback(zoneType);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Productivity:**  Focus on work tasks by filtering out distractions.
*   **Improved Communication:**  Clearly hear conversations in noisy environments.
*   **Stress Reduction:**  Create a calming acoustic environment.
*   **Accessibility:**  Assist individuals with hearing impairments or auditory processing disorders.
*   **AR/VR Integration:**  Create immersive and realistic audio experiences.
