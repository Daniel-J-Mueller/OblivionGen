## Automated Data Lineage & Impact Analysis via Dynamic Graph Reconstruction

**Specification:** A system that automatically reconstructs and visualizes data lineage graphs *during* ETL job execution, allowing for real-time impact analysis and debugging.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *generating* ETL code. This specification details a system that *observes* ETL execution and builds a dynamic, executable graph representing data flow. This is different than generating a graph *from* the code – it’s building the graph *while* the code runs.

**Components:**

1.  **Execution Interceptor:** A lightweight agent deployed alongside the ETL process. It intercepts data read/write operations.
2.  **Metadata Collector:** Extracts metadata from intercepted operations:
    *   Data source/destination identifier.
    *   Transformation function applied.
    *   Data schema (input/output).
    *   Timestamps.
3.  **Dynamic Graph Builder:** Constructs a graph in memory where:
    *   Nodes represent data objects (tables, files, streams).
    *   Edges represent transformations.  Edge metadata includes the transformation function, timestamp, and data volume.
4.  **Impact Analysis Engine:** Allows users to select a node (data object) and:
    *   **Upstream Analysis:**  Identifies all sources that contributed to the selected data object.
    *   **Downstream Analysis:** Identifies all consumers of the selected data object.
    *   **Transformation Path Visualization:** Highlights the specific transformations applied along a chosen path.
5.  **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:** Displays the dynamic graph with:
    *   Node/edge highlighting based on selection.
    *   Data volume statistics.
    *   Transformation execution times.
    *   Error indicators.

**Pseudocode (Impact Analysis Engine – Upstream Analysis):**

```
function findUpstream(targetNode, graph):
  upstreamNodes = []
  queue = [targetNode]
  visited = set()

  while queue:
    currentNode = queue.pop(0)
    if currentNode in visited:
      continue
    visited.add(currentNode)

    for edge in graph.incomingEdges(currentNode):
      sourceNode = edge.sourceNode
      upstreamNodes.append(sourceNode)
      queue.append(sourceNode)

  return upstreamNodes
```

**Innovation:**

*   **Runtime Graph Construction:** This differs from static analysis by building the lineage graph *during* execution.  Errors in transformation logic that aren’t apparent in the code itself become visible in the graph.
*   **Granular Lineage:** Captures data flow at a very detailed level, enabling root cause analysis of data quality issues.
*   **Real-time Debugging:**  Allows developers to step through the data pipeline visually and identify bottlenecks or errors immediately.
*   **Automated Data Governance:** Provides a verifiable audit trail of data transformations, supporting compliance with data governance regulations.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify unusual patterns in data flow.
*   **Automated Data Quality Checks:** Integrate data quality rules into the graph and flag violations.
*   **Cost Optimization:**  Identify redundant transformations and optimize the data pipeline.
