**Adaptive CDN Prefetching via Predictive Client Mobility**

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic CDN selection to *proactively* prefetch content to a CDN closer to the predicted future location of a mobile client. This anticipates movement, reducing latency before the request even occurs.

**Specs:**

1.  **Mobility Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Network Identifier (IP address/ASN) from DNS query, historical location data (from previous requests/connections – anonymized/aggregated, user opt-in required), real-time location hints (if available – e.g., coarse-grained cell tower ID, with appropriate privacy controls).
    *   Process: Employ a Kalman filter or similar predictive model to estimate the client’s future location (latitude/longitude) over a short time horizon (e.g., 5-10 seconds). Model learns from individual client movement patterns and broader regional mobility trends.
    *   Output: Predicted future location (latitude/longitude) with a confidence score.

2.  **Geo-Distributed CDN Map:**
    *   Maintain a database mapping CDN nodes to geographical coordinates. Include node capacity and current load.
    *   Regularly updated (e.g., every minute) via heartbeats from CDN nodes.

3.  **Prefetch Trigger & Content Selection:**
    *   If the mobility prediction confidence score exceeds a threshold (e.g., 70%), calculate the distance between the predicted future location and each CDN node.
    *   Select the CDN node closest to the predicted future location *with available capacity*.
    *   Identify content the client is likely to request based on browsing history (locally cached/aggregated, respecting user privacy), current web page content (e.g., images, scripts), or prefetching hints from the web server.
    *   Initiate a prefetch request to the selected CDN node for the identified content.

4.  **DNS Integration:**
    *   The DNS server (as in the original patent) continues to select a CDN based on *current* location.
    *   If a prefetch has been initiated, the DNS server also provides a flag or indicator in the DNS response, signaling the client to prioritize content from the prefetched CDN. This can be an EDNS extension or a custom DNS record type.

5.  **Client-Side Handling:**
    *   The client receives the DNS response.
    *   If the prefetch flag is set, the client prioritizes loading content from the indicated CDN (using HTTP caching headers or similar mechanisms).

**Pseudocode (DNS Server):**

```
function handleDNSQuery(query):
  networkIdentifier = query.networkIdentifier
  location = getLocationFromIdentifier(networkIdentifier)
  
  predictedLocation = predictFutureLocation(networkIdentifier)
  if predictedLocation.confidence > threshold:
    closestCDN = findClosestCDN(predictedLocation.latitude, predictedLocation.longitude)
    prefetchContent(closestCDN, predictedContent)
    prefetchFlag = true
  else:
    prefetchFlag = false
    closestCDN = selectCDNBasedOnCurrentLocation(location)
  
  response = createDNSResponse(closestCDN, prefetchFlag)
  return response
```

**Considerations:**

*   Privacy: Anonymization and aggregation of location data are crucial.  User opt-in is required.
*   Accuracy:  Mobility prediction is inherently uncertain.  The system must handle prediction errors gracefully.
*   Bandwidth:  Prefetching consumes bandwidth.  The system should limit prefetching to a reasonable amount of content.
*   Caching: Effective caching at the client and CDN levels is essential to maximize the benefits of prefetching.
*   Dynamic content: This may be less effective with highly dynamic content, which may become stale before it can be used.
