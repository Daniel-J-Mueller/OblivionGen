## Dynamic SCM Bank Interleaving with Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting SCM bank interleaving patterns based on real-time workload analysis and predictive prefetching to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

**Core Concept:** The provided patent focuses on *measuring* utilization. This design proactively *shapes* utilization by adapting the physical organization of data access.

**Components:**

1.  **Workload Analyzer:**  A hardware module (FPGA accelerated) that constantly monitors memory access patterns from the memory controller. It identifies:
    *   **Sequential Access:** Long runs of reads/writes to contiguous memory regions.
    *   **Random Access:** Scattered, unpredictable memory accesses.
    *   **Access Hotspots:** Frequently accessed memory regions.
    *   **Temporal Locality:**  Data accessed recently is likely to be accessed again soon.

2.  **Interleave Controller:** A hardware module responsible for mapping logical addresses to physical SCM bank addresses. This is the key component. It utilizes a configurable interleaving pattern. Interleaving patterns include:
    *   **Fine-Grained:**  Data is spread evenly across all banks. Good for random access.
    *   **Coarse-Grained:** Data is grouped into larger blocks, each assigned to a specific bank. Good for sequential access.
    *   **Hybrid:** Combines fine and coarse-grained interleaving for different regions of memory.

3.  **Prefetch Engine:** A hardware module that predicts future memory accesses based on the workload analyzer's data and prefetches data into SCM banks before it is requested.

4.  **Dynamic Configuration Table (DCT):** A small, high-speed memory that stores the current interleaving pattern and prefetch configuration for each memory region.

**Operation:**

1.  The Workload Analyzer continuously monitors memory access patterns.
2.  Based on the analysis, the Workload Analyzer updates the DCT with the optimal interleaving pattern and prefetch configuration for each memory region.
3.  The Interleave Controller reads the configuration from the DCT and dynamically maps logical addresses to physical SCM bank addresses.
4.  The Prefetch Engine, guided by the DCT, proactively fetches data into the appropriate SCM banks.

**Pseudocode (Interleave Controller):**

```
function mapLogicalAddress(logicalAddress, DCT):
  regionID = identifyRegion(logicalAddress) // Simple hashing or range lookup
  interleavingPattern = DCT[regionID].interleavingPattern
  bankID = calculateBankID(logicalAddress, interleavingPattern)
  return bankID
```

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **FPGA Acceleration:** Workload Analyzer and Interleave Controller implemented on a dedicated FPGA for low latency.
*   **DCT Memory:** High-bandwidth, low-latency SRAM (e.g., 10ns access time). Size: 64KB â€“ 256KB (depending on the memory size and granularity of regions).
*   **Interconnect:** High-speed, low-latency interconnect between the FPGA, DCT, and SCM banks (e.g., PCIe Gen5).

**Novelty:**

This system differs from the provided patent, which focuses on measurement. This is about *proactive shaping* of memory access patterns. By dynamically adjusting interleaving and prefetching, it aims to minimize latency and maximize throughput *before* bottlenecks occur.  It's a move from reactive monitoring to predictive optimization. The combination of dynamic interleaving, a region-based configuration table, and a hardware-accelerated workload analyzer is the core innovation. This adds a layer of intelligent orchestration to SCM access that wasn't present in the source document.
