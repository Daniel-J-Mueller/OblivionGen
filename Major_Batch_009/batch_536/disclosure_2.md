## Delegated Action Chaining & Temporal Permissions

**Concept:** Extend the delegation profile concept to allow chained actions with permissions that decay over time, creating ‘time-limited workflows’ accessible to delegated entities.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Action Node:**
    *   `action_id`: Unique identifier for the action.
    *   `action_type`: Specifies the type of action (e.g., `read_file`, `write_db`, `invoke_function`).
    *   `resource_id`: Identifier of the resource the action operates on.
    *   `parameters`: Dictionary of parameters required for the action.
    *   `next_action`: `action_id` of the next action in the chain (null if terminal).
    *   `time_to_live`: Duration (in seconds) after which this action node becomes invalid.
    *   `success_action`: `action_id` of an action to execute upon successful completion of this node (optional – for branching).
    *   `failure_action`: `action_id` of an action to execute upon failure of this node (optional – for error handling).

*   **Delegation Workflow:**
    *   `workflow_id`: Unique identifier for the workflow.
    *   `start_action`: `action_id` of the initial action.
    *   `action_nodes`: Dictionary mapping `action_id` to `Action Node` objects.
    *   `delegation_profile_id`: ID of the associated delegation profile.

**2. API Extensions:**

*   `create_delegation_workflow(delegation_profile_id, start_action_id)`: Creates a new workflow associated with a profile.
*   `add_action_node(workflow_id, action_node)`: Adds a new action node to an existing workflow.
*   `execute_workflow(entity_id, workflow_id)`: Initiates workflow execution for a given entity.

**3. Workflow Engine Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
function execute_workflow(entity_id, workflow_id):
  workflow = get_workflow(workflow_id)
  current_action_id = workflow.start_action

  while current_action_id is not null:
    current_action = get_action(current_action_id)

    # Check Time-To-Live
    if current_action.time_to_live has expired:
      log "Action expired, terminating workflow"
      return ERROR

    # Validate Permissions
    if not has_permission(entity_id, current_action.action_type, current_action.resource_id):
      log "Permission denied"
      return ERROR

    # Execute Action
    try:
      execute_action(entity_id, current_action)  #Call to actual action execution logic
      next_action_id = current_action.next_action
    except Exception as e:
      log "Action failed: " + e.message
      if current_action.failure_action is not null:
        next_action_id = current_action.failure_action
      else:
        return ERROR
    
    if current_action.success_action is not null:
        next_action_id = current_action.success_action

    current_action_id = next_action_id
  
  log "Workflow completed successfully"
  return SUCCESS

```

**4. Security Considerations:**

*   Each action node's `time_to_live` must be strictly enforced.
*   The `execute_action` function requires robust security checks to prevent malicious code execution.
*   Consider incorporating digital signatures on action parameters to ensure data integrity.

**5. Use Cases:**

*   **Temporary Access:** Granting a third-party vendor time-limited access to specific resources for a defined task.
*   **Automated Workflows:** Triggering a series of actions based on a schedule or event, performed on behalf of the customer.
*   **Just-In-Time Access:** Providing access to sensitive data only when a user explicitly requests it, with the access expiring after a short period.
