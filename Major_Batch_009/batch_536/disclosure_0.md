## Modular Garment Containment System – Integrated RFID & Climate Control

**Concept:** A garment containment system building upon foldable panel construction, but incorporating active climate control and RFID tracking for high-value garment logistics and retail.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Structure:**
   *   Material: Multi-layer composite. Outer layer: Durable, water-resistant recycled polyester. Middle layer: Insulating aerogel layer. Inner layer: Static-dissipative, anti-microbial fabric.
   *   Panel Configuration:  Based on the folding panel design of the referenced patent, but with reinforced crease lines and integrated flexible circuitry.
   *   Dimensions: Scalable, configurable for standard garment sizes (S, M, L, XL) through modular panel addition/subtraction. Base unit footprint: 24” x 18”. Max expanded volume: 3 cubic feet.
   *   Sealing Mechanism: Water-tight zipper closure system reinforced with magnetic seals.

**2. Climate Control Subsystem:**
   *   Peltier Module Integration: Miniature Peltier modules embedded within the inner layer of the container panels.  Controlled via microcontroller.
   *   Temperature Sensor: Digital temperature sensor (DHT22) placed inside the container to monitor internal climate. Target Temperature Range: 65-75°F.
   *   Power Source: Rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack (5V, 2A) integrated into the base panel. Wireless charging capability. Battery Life: 12 hours continuous operation.
   *   Air Circulation: Miniature, low-power fan integrated into the base panel for forced air circulation. Adjustable fan speed.

**3. RFID Tracking System:**
   *   RFID Tag: EPC Gen2 UHF passive RFID tag embedded within the base panel.
   *   RFID Reader Integration:  Compatibility with standard UHF RFID readers (902-928 MHz).
   *   Data Logging:  Microcontroller logs temperature, humidity, and RFID read events. Data accessible via USB connection.
   *   Tamper Detection:  Accelerometer detects container movement or tampering. Triggers alert via RFID transmission.

**4. Modular Panel Design & Expansion:**
    *   Panel Connection: Panels connected via reinforced magnetic connectors and interlocking edges.
    *   Expansion Modules: Additional panels available for accommodating larger garments or adding extra climate control zones.
    *   Customizable Panels: Option to add transparent panels for garment visibility.

**5. Control Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Read Temperature Sensor
    temperature = readTemperature();

    // Read RFID Tag ID
    tagID = readRFID();

    // Check for Tamper Alert
    tamperDetected = checkTamper();

    // Control Peltier Module based on temperature
    if (temperature > targetTemperature) {
        activatePeltierCooling();
    } else if (temperature < targetTemperature) {
        activatePeltierHeating();
    } else {
        deactivatePeltier();
    }

    // Activate Fan (based on temperature differential)
    if (temperature > (targetTemperature + 2)) {
        activateFan();
    } else {
        deactivateFan();
    }

    // Transmit Data (RFID & Sensor Data)
    transmitRFIDData(tagID);
    transmitSensorData(temperature);

    // Check for Tamper
    if (tamperDetected) {
        transmitTamperAlert();
    }

    delay(500ms);
}
```

**6. Manufacturing Notes:**
    *   Automated panel cutting and folding using CNC machinery.
    *   Flexible circuitry integration using conductive inks and automated deposition techniques.
    *   Rigorous quality control testing for climate control performance and RFID read range.
