## Adaptive Behavioral Model Synthesis from Live System Data

**Specification:** A system for automatically refining and expanding the behavioral model used in verifying software, utilizing live production data to identify edge cases and previously unmodeled behavior.

**Rationale:** The patent describes a process of verifying new code against a behavioral model derived from legacy code. This is excellent, but static behavioral models, even those painstakingly created, will *always* be incomplete. Real-world usage uncovers behaviors not anticipated during initial modeling. This system addresses that limitation.

**Components:**

1.  **Data Tap:** A non-intrusive mechanism for capturing relevant runtime data from the deployed legacy and verified code. This will include input parameters, internal state changes (selected key variables), and output values.  The selection of data to capture will be configurable via policy.

2.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:**  A machine learning model trained on a baseline of "normal" behavior derived from initial runs of the legacy and verified code.  This engine flags deviations from the baseline as potential new behaviors.  Multiple anomaly detection algorithms will be employed (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) and their outputs combined.

3.  **Behavioral Inference Module:**  When an anomaly is detected, this module attempts to *infer* the underlying behavioral rule. It doesnâ€™t simply report the anomaly; it tries to understand *why* it happened. This leverages symbolic execution and constraint solving techniques to derive a formal representation of the new behavior.

4.  **Model Integration & Validation:**  The inferred behavioral rule is added to the existing behavioral model. *Crucially*, this isn't done blindly. The system automatically generates test cases based on the new rule and runs them against both the legacy and verified code. If the new rule causes discrepancies (i.e., the verified code fails the test), the rule is refined or rejected.

5.  **Policy-Driven Filtering:**  A policy engine controls which anomalies are considered for behavioral inference.  This allows filtering out noise, transient errors, or behaviors deemed irrelevant to core functionality.  Policies can be defined based on user roles, system criticality, or other criteria.



**Pseudocode (Behavioral Inference Module):**

```
function inferBehavior(anomalyData, existingModel):
  // anomalyData contains input, state, output of anomalous execution
  // existingModel is the current behavioral model (rules, constraints)

  // 1. Symbolic Execution: Execute the code symbolically with anomalyData as input
  symbolicTrace = symbolicExecute(anomalyData, existingModel)

  // 2. Constraint Solving: Identify constraints that explain the anomalous behavior.
  constraints = solveConstraints(symbolicTrace)

  // 3. Rule Generation:  Create a formal rule from the constraints.
  newRule = generateRule(constraints)

  // 4.  Verification:  Validate the new rule against existing rules for consistency.
  if (newRule is consistent with existingModel):
     return newRule
  else:
     // Refinement: Attempt to refine the rule or discard it.
     refinedRule = refineRule(newRule, existingModel)
     if(refinedRule is valid):
        return refinedRule
     else:
        return null // Discard the rule.
```

**Deployment:**  This system would operate as a sidecar process alongside the deployed legacy and verified code.  It would continuously monitor runtime data, refine the behavioral model, and provide feedback for improving the verification process.

**Novelty:** The continuous, automated refinement of the behavioral model based on live production data is a significant departure from existing approaches, which rely on static analysis and manual modeling. This enables a more robust and adaptable verification process that can handle the complexity of real-world systems.
