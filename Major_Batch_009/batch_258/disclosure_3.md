## Dynamic Resource Swapping & Predictive Pre-Transcode

**Concept:** Extend the existing resource utilization model to actively *swap* resource allocations between customers based on predicted transcoding needs and real-time market pricing, *before* a job is even submitted. Simultaneously, proactively pre-transcode common segments of media, caching them for instant delivery.

**Specs:**

*   **Predictive Engine:**
    *   Input: Historical transcoding requests (format, duration, complexity), user viewing habits (time of day, content preferences), real-time content trending data (news, sports, viral videos).
    *   Algorithm: Time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) combined with a Markov Chain model to predict future transcoding load per customer and content type.
    *   Output: Predicted resource demand (CPU, memory, storage) for each customer over a defined time horizon (e.g., next hour, next day).

*   **Dynamic Resource Swapper:**
    *   Input: Predictive Engine output, Real-time resource pricing data (spot instances, reserved instances), Customer priority levels (defined by subscription tier or bid price), Current resource allocation for each customer.
    *   Logic: 
        1.  Identify potential resource imbalances (customers predicted to be over or under-utilized).
        2.  Calculate the cost of acquiring/releasing resources on the spot market vs. shifting resources between customers.
        3.  Prioritize swaps based on cost, customer priority, and predicted transcoding quality.
        4.  Automatically reallocate resources *before* transcoding requests are submitted.
    *   Output: Adjusted resource allocations for each customer.

*   **Pre-Transcode Cache:**
    *   Input: Popular media segments (identified by view count, trending algorithms), Common transcoding profiles (e.g., 720p H.264 for mobile).
    *   Process:
        1.  Segment popular media into short, manageable chunks (e.g., 5-10 seconds).
        2.  Pre-transcode each segment into multiple common profiles.
        3.  Cache pre-transcoded segments on a CDN or distributed storage system.
    *   Integration: When a user requests a specific media segment, check the cache first. If available, deliver the pre-transcoded segment instantly.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Resource Swapper):**

```
function swapResources(predictiveData, pricingData, customerPriorities, currentAllocations):
  imbalances = findResourceImbalances(predictiveData)
  
  for each imbalance in imbalances:
    customerToIncrease = imbalance.customer
    resourceNeeded = imbalance.resource
    
    potentialSwaps = findPotentialSwaps(customerToIncrease, resourceNeeded, currentAllocations)
    
    bestSwap = null
    lowestCost = Infinity
    
    for each swap in potentialSwaps:
      cost = calculateSwapCost(swap, pricingData)
      
      if cost < lowestCost:
        lowestCost = cost
        bestSwap = swap
        
    if bestSwap != null:
      executeSwap(bestSwap)
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The Predictive Engine must be highly scalable to handle large volumes of historical data and real-time requests.
*   The Resource Swapper must be able to manage a large number of resource allocations and swaps concurrently.
*   The Pre-Transcode Cache must be able to store and deliver a large volume of pre-transcoded segments with low latency.
