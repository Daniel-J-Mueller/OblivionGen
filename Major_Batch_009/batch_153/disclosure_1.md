## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping with Biofeedback Integration

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-density microphone array (64+ microphones) – circular or hemispherical configuration preferred.
    *   Biofeedback sensors (EEG, GSR, heart rate variability) integrated into a wearable headset or positioned near the user.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (GPU/FPGA) for real-time signal processing.
    *   Haptic feedback system (vibration motors) integrated into the headset or worn on the wrist.

*   **Software:**
    *   Real-time audio processing pipeline.
    *   Biofeedback signal analysis module.
    *   Adaptive acoustic mapping algorithm.
    *   Haptic feedback control module.
    *   Machine Learning models (training data derived from user-specific biofeedback during speech and silence).

**Innovation Description:**

This system aims to create a dynamically adjusting acoustic "bubble" around the user, optimizing speech recognition and noise cancellation based on *both* ambient audio and the user's internal physiological state. 

The core idea is that a user's cognitive load, emotional state, and focus affect subtle vocal characteristics and background noise perception.  By integrating biofeedback signals (EEG for attention/cognitive load, GSR/HRV for emotional state), we can anticipate and compensate for these changes, improving speech recognition accuracy and creating a more immersive and personalized audio experience.

**Algorithm Outline:**

1.  **Baseline Calibration:** Establish baseline biofeedback readings for the user during a period of silence and minimal external noise. This creates a "neutral" state for comparison.

2.  **Acoustic Mapping:**  The microphone array continuously maps the surrounding acoustic environment, identifying sound sources and generating a beamformed signal.  This is similar to the provided patent but expands beyond simple directionality.  We track not just *where* sound is coming from, but *how* it's changing – amplitude, frequency, and spectral characteristics.

3.  **Biofeedback Analysis:** Continuously analyze biofeedback signals:
    *   **EEG:** Extract features related to attention, cognitive load, and emotional valence. (Alpha/Theta band activity for relaxation, Beta/Gamma for focused attention).
    *   **GSR/HRV:**  Assess emotional arousal and stress levels.

4.  **Adaptive Beamforming:**
    *   **Cognitive Load Adjustment:** If EEG indicates high cognitive load, the beamforming algorithm prioritizes clarity and intelligibility of speech, suppressing background noise more aggressively. The beamforming “tightens” around the expected source of speech.
    *   **Emotional State Adjustment:** If GSR/HRV indicates emotional arousal (e.g., stress, excitement), the system can adjust the acoustic environment to be more calming.  This might involve subtly filtering out harsh frequencies or introducing ambient sounds.
    *   **Predictive Beamforming:**  Machine learning models trained on historical biofeedback and audio data can *predict* changes in the user’s vocal characteristics or the surrounding noise environment *before* they happen, allowing the beamforming algorithm to proactively adjust.

5.  **Haptic Feedback:**  Provide subtle haptic cues to the user to indicate changes in the acoustic environment or the system’s adjustments. For example:
    *   A gentle vibration when the system suppresses a loud noise.
    *   A pulsating vibration to indicate that the system is actively focusing on the user's speech.
    *   A different vibration pattern to signal a change in the user’s emotional state (based on GSR/HRV).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Adaptive Beamforming):**

```
// Input: Audio signals from microphone array, Biofeedback data (EEG, GSR/HRV)

// 1. Calculate baseline acoustic map
acoustic_map = calculate_acoustic_map(audio_signals)

// 2. Analyze biofeedback data
biofeedback_data = analyze_biofeedback(EEG, GSR/HRV)
cognitive_load = biofeedback_data.cognitive_load
emotional_state = biofeedback_data.emotional_state

// 3. Adjust beamforming parameters based on biofeedback
if cognitive_load > threshold:
    noise_suppression_level = increase(noise_suppression_level)
    beam_width = decrease(beam_width) //Tighten the beam
if emotional_state == "stressed":
    filter_frequencies = apply_calming_filter()

// 4. Apply beamforming with adjusted parameters
beamformed_signal = apply_beamforming(audio_signals, beam_width, filter_frequencies)

// 5. Provide haptic feedback (optional)
if noise_suppression_level > threshold:
    haptic_vibrate(intensity=0.5)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced speech recognition in noisy environments (e.g., call centers, crowded offices).
*   Improved communication for individuals with cognitive impairments.
*   Personalized audio experiences for immersive gaming and virtual reality.
*   Stress reduction and mindfulness applications.
*   Biometric authentication based on vocal characteristics and physiological state.
