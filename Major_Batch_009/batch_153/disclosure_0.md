## Dynamic Narrative Branching via Gaze-Contingent Content Injection

**Specification:** A system for generating dynamically branching narrative content within a linear entertainment experience, driven by real-time analysis of a viewer’s gaze direction and duration. This builds upon the patent’s dynamic perspective rendering but extends it to *content* modification, not just viewpoint.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Gaze Tracking Module:** High-precision eye-tracking hardware and software integrated with the display system. Outputs real-time gaze direction (x, y, z coordinates within the virtual scene) and dwell time (duration gaze remains fixed on a point of interest).

2.  **Semantic Scene Graph:**  The entertainment content is structured as a detailed semantic scene graph. Each node represents an object, character, or region within the scene, tagged with semantic metadata (e.g., “locked chest”, “suspicious guard”, “hidden doorway”).

3.  **Branching Narrative Database:** A database containing pre-authored narrative branches – short video clips, dialogue sequences, animation alterations, or procedural content generation rules – linked to specific semantic nodes and gaze behaviors.  Each branch has associated ‘activation thresholds’ – gaze direction proximity, dwell time duration, and optionally, emotional state inferred from facial expression analysis.

4.  **Real-time Content Director:** The central control module. It continuously receives gaze data, queries the semantic scene graph to identify objects/regions under the viewer's gaze, and uses the Branching Narrative Database to determine if a narrative branch activation threshold has been met.  If triggered, it seamlessly injects the corresponding content (video clip, altered animation, procedural content) into the current scene stream.

**Pseudocode (Content Director):**

```
LOOP:
    gazeData = GetGazeData()  // Returns (x, y, z, dwellTime)
    sceneGraph = GetCurrentSceneGraph()
    
    closestNode = FindClosestSemanticNode(sceneGraph, gazeData)
    
    IF closestNode != NULL:
        branchOptions = GetBranchOptions(closestNode) // Returns list of potential branches
        
        FOR EACH branch IN branchOptions:
            IF branch.ActivationThresholdMet(gazeData):
                // Blend/Inject branch content into current scene
                RenderBranchContent(branch)
                break // Only activate one branch per frame
    ENDIF
ENDLOOP
```

**Content Injection Methods:**

*   **Seamless Blending:** For minor alterations (e.g., a character glancing at the viewer), use alpha blending to smoothly transition between the original content and the injected content.
*   **Scene Cut:** For more substantial changes (e.g., a flashback sequence triggered by gazing at a specific object), perform a quick scene cut to the injected content.
*   **Procedural Generation:**  Trigger procedural content generation based on the viewer’s gaze. For example, gazing at a blank wall could trigger the generation of a hidden doorway or secret message.
*   **Dialogue Augmentation:** Inject additional dialogue lines or reactions from characters based on the viewer’s gaze.

**Example Scenario:**

A viewer is watching a scene in a haunted mansion. They gaze at a dusty portrait on the wall for more than 2 seconds. The system recognizes the portrait as a semantic node with an associated branch: a brief flashback sequence showing the portrait's subject engaging in a suspicious activity. The system seamlessly blends the flashback into the current scene, revealing a crucial plot point.

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **Minimum Frame Rate:** 60 FPS for seamless blending.
*   **Eye-Tracking Accuracy:** Sub-pixel accuracy for precise gaze direction detection.
*   **Database Size:** Scalable database to store a large number of branching narrative options.
*   **API:** Open API for content creators to easily add and manage branching narrative options.
*   **Rendering Engine Compatibility:** Compatible with major rendering engines (Unity, Unreal Engine).
