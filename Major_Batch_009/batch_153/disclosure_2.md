## Predictive Prefetching via User Interaction Heatmaps

**Concept:** Expand prefetching beyond resource request monitoring to incorporate real-time user interaction data, creating dynamic “heatmaps” of likely content engagement. This isn’t just *what* is requested, but *how* users are interacting with delivered content, predicting *future* interaction before a formal request.

**Specs:**

**1. Interaction Tracking Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Capture user interactions via client-side Javascript injected into delivered webpages. Interactions include:
    *   Mouse movements (heatmaps)
    *   Scroll depth
    *   Time spent on specific elements
    *   Clicks/taps
    *   Form inputs (anonymized/aggregated)
    *   Video/audio engagement (play/pause/seek)
*   **Data Aggregation:** Aggregate interaction data at the client-side and transmit anonymized/aggregated summaries to the CDN edge nodes. Minimize data transmission by using delta encoding and compression.
*   **Data Format:** JSON payload containing interaction heatmaps, scroll depths, time-on-element data, etc.

**2. Predictive Algorithm (Edge Node Implementation):**

*   **Input:**
    *   Current Resource Request
    *   Real-time Interaction Heatmaps (from Interaction Tracking Module)
    *   Historical Resource Request Data
    *   User Cluster Association (from original patent concept)
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Heatmap Analysis:** Analyze interaction heatmaps for the current user cluster. Identify areas of high engagement (e.g., frequently hovered elements, deeply scrolled sections).
    2.  **Correlation Analysis:** Correlate high-engagement areas with potential follow-up resource requests. (e.g., hovering over a product image suggests a likely request for the product page).
    3.  **Probability Scoring:** Assign a probability score to each potential follow-up resource request based on correlation and historical data.
    4.  **Prefetch Trigger:** If the probability score exceeds a predefined threshold, trigger a prefetch request for the potential resource.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Employ a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, random forest) at the edge node to refine probability scoring and adapt to evolving user behavior. Model parameters updated periodically via a central server.

**3. Cache Management Module:**

*   **Dynamic Cache Allocation:** Allocate cache space dynamically based on prefetch probabilities. Prioritize caching of high-probability resources.
*   **Cache Eviction Policy:** Implement a cache eviction policy that considers both resource popularity and prefetch probability.
*   **Prefetch Validation:** Before serving a prefetched resource, validate that the user is still likely to be interested (e.g., based on current page context, time since prefetch).

**Pseudocode (Edge Node):**

```
function processRequest(request):
  userCluster = getUserCluster(request)
  interactionHeatmap = getInteractionHeatmap(userCluster)
  potentialResources = analyzeHeatmap(interactionHeatmap) // Identify potential resources based on heatmap
  for resource in potentialResources:
    probability = calculateProbability(resource, interactionHeatmap, historicalData)
    if probability > threshold:
      prefetchResource(resource) // Initiate prefetch request
  serveResource(request)
```

**Infrastructure Considerations:**

*   Edge Node Processing Capacity: Ensure edge nodes have sufficient processing capacity to run the predictive algorithm and manage prefetch requests.
*   Scalability: Design the system to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing traffic and user base.
*   Privacy: Implement robust privacy controls to protect user data and comply with relevant regulations. Data aggregation and anonymization are crucial.
