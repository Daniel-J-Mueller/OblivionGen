## Dynamic Color Mood Generation & Projection

**Concept:** Extend color naming beyond static identification to *dynamic mood generation* tied to environmental data and user biofeedback, then project those moods as ambient lighting.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Environmental Sensors:** Integrated sensors for ambient light level, temperature, humidity, sound (decibel level & frequency analysis), and air quality (VOCs, particulate matter).
*   **Biofeedback Sensors (Optional):** Integration with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers) for heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance, and potentially EEG data. User consent required.
*   **Real-time Data Streaming:** All sensor data streams into a central processing unit.

**2. Color Mood Engine:**

*   **AI Model:**  A trained neural network (e.g., recurrent neural network or transformer) trained on a dataset linking environmental conditions, biofeedback signals, and subjective mood associations (collected via user surveys/input).
*   **Mood State Determination:** The AI model analyzes incoming sensor data to infer a current "mood state" (e.g., calm, energetic, focused, anxious, romantic, etc.).  Mood state is represented as a vector.
*   **Color Palette Generation:** Based on the mood state vector, the engine generates a dynamic color palette of 3-5 colors. This is *not* simply a lookup table. The AI model learns complex relationships between mood and color.
*   **Color Blending & Transition:** Algorithm for smooth, aesthetically pleasing transitions between color palettes.  Parameters for transition speed, blending mode (e.g., linear, exponential), and color saturation/brightness adjustments.
*   **User Override:** Option for users to manually select a mood or color palette, overriding the automated system.

**3. Projection System:**

*   **Addressable LED Array:**  High-density array of individually addressable RGB LEDs (e.g., WS2812B or similar) capable of displaying a wide range of colors and dynamic effects.
*   **Projection Surface:** Diffuse, translucent surface (e.g., frosted acrylic, fabric screen) to evenly distribute light and create a soft ambient glow.  Multiple surfaces can be used for a more immersive experience.
*   **Spatial Mapping (Optional):** Using depth sensors (e.g., Intel RealSense, LiDAR) to create a 3D map of the surrounding environment.  The projection system can then adapt the color and intensity of the light to create a more realistic and immersive effect.
*   **Control Interface:** App for iOS/Android to configure sensors, calibrate the system, select moods, and customize projection settings.

**Pseudocode (Color Mood Engine):**

```
function generate_color_palette(environmental_data, biofeedback_data):
  # Input: Environmental & Biofeedback data
  # Output: Dynamic color palette (list of RGB values)

  # 1. Feature Extraction:
  features = extract_features(environmental_data, biofeedback_data)

  # 2. Mood State Prediction:
  mood_vector = AI_Model.predict(features)  # Predict mood state vector

  # 3. Color Palette Generation:
  primary_color = generate_color_from_mood(mood_vector[0])
  secondary_color = generate_color_from_mood(mood_vector[1])
  accent_color = generate_color_from_mood(mood_vector[2])

  palette = [primary_color, secondary_color, accent_color]

  return palette

function generate_color_from_mood(mood_value):
  # Map mood value to RGB components
  # Use a non-linear mapping function (e.g., sigmoid, exponential) to create richer color variations
  red = sigmoid(mood_value * 0.7) * 255
  green = sigmoid(mood_value * 0.5) * 255
  blue = sigmoid(mood_value * 0.3) * 255

  return (red, green, blue)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart homes/offices: Create adaptive lighting that enhances mood and productivity.
*   Wellness centers:  Use color therapy to promote relaxation and healing.
*   Gaming/entertainment:  Immersive lighting that responds to in-game events.
*   Art installations:  Dynamic color displays that react to the environment and audience.
