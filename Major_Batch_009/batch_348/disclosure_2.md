## Dynamic Keyline Shifting & Data Fragmentation

**Concept:** Enhance data security & resilience by dynamically fragmenting data across multiple keylines *within* the existing hierarchical key management system, and shifting these fragments between keylines at regular intervals. This introduces a layer of obfuscation beyond simple key rotation, making data reconstruction significantly more difficult for an attacker even if some keys are compromised.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Fragmentation Module:**
    *   Input: Data object, Fragmentation Level (configurable - 1-N, determining fragment size/count).
    *   Process: Divide the input data object into `N` fragments based on the Fragmentation Level. Each fragment should be approximately equal in size.
    *   Output: Array of data fragments.

2.  **Keyline Assignment Module:**
    *   Input: Array of data fragments, Current Keyline Map (see 3), Key Hierarchy (from patent).
    *   Process: Assign each data fragment to a unique keyline within the existing hierarchical key structure.  Keyline selection should prioritize distributing fragments across different branches of the hierarchy to maximize dispersion.
    *   Output:  Fragment-Keyline Map (associates each fragment with a specific keyline).

3.  **Keyline Map:**
    *   Data Structure: A multi-level map reflecting the hierarchy.  Each level maps a key ID to a list of fragment IDs assigned to that keyline.
    *   Dynamic Update: The Keyline Map is not static. It is periodically shuffled (see 5).

4.  **Encryption/Decryption Module (Modified):**
    *   Encryption: Utilize the existing key hierarchy for encryption, but apply the assigned keyline to *each fragment* individually.
    *   Decryption: Requires access to the Keyline Map to identify the correct keyline for each fragment before decryption. Fragments are reassembled only after successful decryption.

5.  **Keyline Shuffling Module:**
    *   Trigger: Configurable interval or event-driven (e.g., high security alert).
    *   Process:
        *   Generate a new Keyline Map.
        *   Randomly (or pseudo-randomly based on a seed) reassign fragments to different keylines, ensuring each fragment is moved.
        *   Re-encrypt affected fragments with the new keyline.
        *   Update the Keyline Map storage.

6.  **Key Hierarchy Integration:**
    *   The existing key hierarchy (from the patent) remains unchanged. This system adds a layer of dynamic fragmentation and reassignment *on top* of the existing structure.
    *   Key rotation within the existing hierarchy continues as before.

7.  **Metadata Storage:**
    *   Store metadata associated with each data object:
        *   Original data object ID
        *   Fragmentation Level used
        *   Current Keyline Map version (for retrieval/reconstruction)

**Pseudocode (Keyline Shuffling Module):**

```
FUNCTION ShuffleKeylines(KeylineMap, FragmentList, KeyHierarchy, VersionNumber)

    // Create a new KeylineMap
    NewKeylineMap = CreateEmptyKeylineMap(KeyHierarchy)

    // Iterate through each fragment
    FOR EACH Fragment IN FragmentList:

        // Select a new random keyline from the KeyHierarchy
        NewKeyline = SelectRandomKeyline(KeyHierarchy)

        // Assign the fragment to the new keyline in the NewKeylineMap
        AssignFragmentToKeyline(NewKeylineMap, Fragment, NewKeyline)

        // Re-encrypt the fragment with the new keyline's key
        ReEncryptFragment(Fragment, NewKeyline.Key)

    // Update the current Keyline Map with the NewKeylineMap
    CurrentKeylineMap = NewKeylineMap

    // Increment Keyline Map version number
    VersionNumber = VersionNumber + 1

    RETURN CurrentKeylineMap, VersionNumber
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased resilience against key compromise.  An attacker needs to compromise multiple keylines to reconstruct the data.
*   Enhanced data obfuscation.
*   Dynamic security posture.
*   Compatibility with existing key management infrastructure.
*   Scalability â€“ adaptable to various data sizes and security requirements.
