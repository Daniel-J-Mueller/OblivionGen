## Dynamic Component Synthesis with Generative AI

**Concept:** Expand beyond prioritizing existing components to *generating* new, personalized components on-the-fly based on user behavior and predicted intent. This builds on the existing behavioral data collection to create truly adaptive web experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Component Library:** A repository of modular, generative AI "seeds". These seeds aren't full components, but parameterized instructions for generating them (e.g., "Generate a product recommendation carousel with X items, style Y, based on category Z").  Seeds are tagged with metadata describing cost (compute time, bandwidth), complexity, and target audience.
*   **Behavioral Profile:**  Each user has a dynamic behavioral profile tracking:
    *   Dwell time (as in the patent).
    *   Scrolling speed and patterns.
    *   Interaction types (clicks, hovers, form submissions).
    *   Content consumption history (categories, keywords).
    *   Session context (time of day, device type, location â€“ with user permission).
*   **Intent Prediction Engine:**  A machine learning model predicts user intent based on the behavioral profile and current session context. Outputs a probability distribution over potential user goals (e.g., "find a red shirt," "learn about climate change," "purchase running shoes").
*   **Component Synthesis Engine:**
    1.  Receives intent predictions.
    2.  Queries the Component Library for seeds matching the predicted intent.
    3.  Ranks seeds based on:
        *   Intent match score.
        *   Estimated cost.
        *   User profile preferences (e.g., prefers minimal designs).
    4.  Selects the top N seeds.
    5.  Instantiates the seeds using a generative AI model (e.g., a large language model, a diffusion model) to create the personalized component.
    6.  Returns the generated component.
*   **Adaptive Rendering Pipeline:**  The web server integrates with the Component Synthesis Engine. When a request for a web page is received:
    1.  The server retrieves the base page structure.
    2.  For each designated component slot, it calls the Component Synthesis Engine.
    3.  The server renders the base page with the dynamically generated components.

**Pseudocode (Component Synthesis Engine):**

```python
def synthesize_component(intent_predictions, user_profile):
  seeds = query_component_library(intent_predictions)
  ranked_seeds = rank_seeds(seeds, user_profile)
  selected_seed = ranked_seeds[0]  # Select top seed
  component = generate_component(selected_seed)  # Use generative AI model
  return component

def generate_component(seed):
  # Input: Seed (parameters for generative model)
  # Output: Generated component (HTML/CSS/JS)
  # Implementation: Calls a generative AI model (LLM, Diffusion Model)
  # Example (using a hypothetical LLM API):
  prompt = f"Generate a web component based on: {seed['parameters']}"
  component_code = call_llm_api(prompt)
  return component_code
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond *prioritizing* existing components to dynamically *creating* new ones based on user intent. It leverages generative AI to provide truly personalized and adaptive web experiences. The ranking system balances relevance with resource cost, ensuring efficient delivery.
