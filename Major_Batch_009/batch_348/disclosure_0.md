## Adaptive Skill-Based Routing with Predictive Agent State

**Concept:** Expand upon the bipartite graph weighting to incorporate real-time agent skill assessment and predicted agent ‘state’ (e.g., fatigue, emotional tone) to optimize routing *beyond* simple predicted interaction success. The aim is to not only connect the right agent to the contact, but also to maximize agent *performance* and *longevity*.

**Specs:**

1.  **Agent State Monitoring Module:**
    *   Input: Audio stream from agent's headset, keystroke dynamics, CRM data (call duration, resolution rate, post-call work time).
    *   Processing: Utilize a multi-modal machine learning model (potentially a recurrent neural network with attention mechanisms) to assess:
        *   *Fatigue Level*: Predict likelihood of burnout or diminished performance.
        *   *Emotional Tone*: Detect frustration, empathy, or disengagement.
        *   *Cognitive Load*: Estimate the agent’s current mental workload.
    *   Output: Real-time Agent State Vector – a numerical representation of the agent’s condition.

2.  **Skill Drift Detection & Recalibration:**
    *   Monitor agent performance on different interaction types over time.
    *   Employ a Bayesian updating model to track the probability distribution of each agent's skill level for each supported interaction type (e.g., sales, technical support, customer service).
    *   Trigger automated retraining of the agent’s skill profile based on performance deviations.
    *   Integrate with a ‘skill decay’ model—skills degrade with disuse.

3.  **Weighted Bipartite Graph Enhancement:**
    *   Augment the existing edge weightings with:
        *   *Agent Skill Score*: Weighted based on the contact’s needs and the agent’s demonstrated proficiency.
        *   *Agent State Penalty/Bonus*: Dynamically adjust weights based on the Agent State Vector (e.g., penalize agents showing high fatigue, bonus agents exhibiting high empathy).
        *   *Interaction Complexity Score*: Estimate the cognitive load required for the interaction type.

4.  **Routing Algorithm:**
    *   Employ an enhanced assignment solver (e.g., Hungarian algorithm, minimum cost flow) that considers the augmented edge weights.
    *   Introduce a 'fairness' constraint to distribute workload equitably among agents (prevent overloading high-performing agents).
    *   Implement a ‘proactive intervention’ mechanism. If the algorithm consistently assigns complex interactions to agents showing signs of fatigue, flag for supervisor intervention (coaching, breaks).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Agent State Monitoring (running continuously)
function monitorAgentState(agentID):
  audioStream = getAudioStream(agentID)
  keystrokeDynamics = getKeystrokeDynamics(agentID)
  crmData = getCrmData(agentID)
  stateVector = analyzeData(audioStream, keystrokeDynamics, crmData) // ML model output
  updateAgentState(agentID, stateVector)

// Skill Drift Detection (periodically)
function detectSkillDrift():
  for each agent:
    for each interactionType:
      performanceData = getPerformanceData(agent, interactionType)
      updateSkillDistribution(agent, interactionType, performanceData)

// Weighted Graph Construction
function buildWeightedGraph(contacts, agents):
  graph = new BipartiteGraph(contacts, agents)
  for each contact, agent:
    skillScore = calculateSkillScore(contact, agent)
    statePenalty = calculateStatePenalty(agent)
    complexityScore = calculateComplexityScore(contact)
    edgeWeight = skillScore + statePenalty + complexityScore
    graph.addEdge(contact, agent, edgeWeight)
  return graph

// Routing Decision
function routeContact(contact):
  graph = buildWeightedGraph(contacts, agents)
  assignment = solveAssignmentProblem(graph) // e.g., Hungarian algorithm
  assignedAgent = assignment.getAgentForContact(contact)
  connectContactToAgent(contact, assignedAgent)
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond predicting successful interactions to proactively manage agent well-being and optimize long-term performance. The dynamic weighting system, incorporating real-time state assessment and skill drift detection, offers a significantly more nuanced and adaptive routing solution. The combination of ML with assignment optimization provides a potentially superior outcome to existing systems.
