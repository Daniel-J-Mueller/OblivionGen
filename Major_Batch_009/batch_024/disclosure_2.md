## Dynamic Permission Scaffolding via Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the existing permission framework to *proactively* adjust access levels based on observed user behavior, creating a "dynamic permission scaffold" that anticipates needs and mitigates risks.  Instead of solely relying on pre-defined roles and groups, the system learns from user actions to refine permissions in near real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Behavioral Data Collection Module:**
    *   Collects data on user interactions with the network resource: API calls, UI element access, data modification attempts, time-based access patterns (e.g., accessing sensitive data only during business hours).
    *   Data is anonymized/pseudonymized to protect privacy.
    *   Data points include: resource accessed, action performed (read, write, delete, execute), timestamp, client device details, network location (coarse-grained).
*   **Behavioral Analysis Engine:**
    *   Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection, clustering, sequential pattern mining) to identify typical user behavior.
    *   Builds user behavior profiles:  "This user typically reads reports A & B, then exports data to CSV.  Unusual activity: Attempted to delete record X."
    *   Calculates a "Behavioral Risk Score" (BRS) for each user, reflecting deviation from their established baseline.
*   **Permission Adjustment Logic:**
    *   Defines thresholds for the BRS.  High BRS triggers alerts or temporary access restrictions.  Low BRS (indicating consistently appropriate behavior) may *grant* temporary elevated permissions (e.g., access to a more advanced feature).
    *   Dynamic permission "boosts" can be applied. "User consistently accesses read-only data, grant temporary access to edit feature Y".
    *   Permission adjustments are logged with detailed explanations.
*   **Integration with Existing Framework:**
    *   The system intercepts requests *after* the initial authentication and permission check (as defined in the patent).
    *   The Behavioral Analysis Engine provides a supplemental permission signal.  The original permission is not overwritten, but modified based on the BRS.
    *   A "Permission Override" flag is added to the forwarded request, indicating that the permissions were dynamically adjusted.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/behavior/profile/{userId}`:  Retrieve user behavior profile (for auditing/debugging).
    *   `/behavior/thresholds`:  Configure BRS thresholds and permission adjustment rules.
*   **Pseudocode (Permission Adjustment Logic):**

```
function adjustPermissions(request, originalPermission, userBRS) {
  if (userBRS > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
    //Restrict access.  Log event.
    request.permission = "read-only";
    logEvent("High BRS - Access Restricted", request.userId, request.resource);
  } else if (userBRS < LOW_THRESHOLD && request.operation == "edit") {
    //Grant temporary edit permission.  Log event.
    request.permission = "edit";
    logEvent("Low BRS - Edit Permission Granted", request.userId, request.resource);
  } else {
    request.permission = originalPermission;
  }
  return request;
}
```

**Novelty:**  While the source patent focuses on static permissions based on user classes, this design introduces *dynamic* adjustments based on real-time behavioral analysis, creating a more adaptive and secure system. The permission signals aren't simply 'on' or 'off', but can be adjusted in granularity.  It shifts from *who* the user is to *what* the user is *doing*.
