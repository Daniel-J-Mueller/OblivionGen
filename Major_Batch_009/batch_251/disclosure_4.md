## Dynamic Inventory Holder Morphology

**Concept:** Inventory holders aren’t static containers. They adapt shape *in situ* based on item size and access frequency, optimizing space and minimizing drive unit travel.

**Specs:**

*   **Holder Material:** Shape-memory polymer composite with embedded micro-actuators. The composite incorporates flexible sensors for object detection and dimensioning.
*   **Actuation:** Electrically controlled micro-actuators respond to signals from the central management module, causing the holder to expand or contract along multiple axes.
*   **Sensing:** Ultrasonic or laser rangefinders integrated into the holder walls scan for items placed within and determine dimensions. Pressure sensors determine the weight of the contained item.
*   **Morphology Profiles:** Pre-defined morphology profiles correspond to common item sizes. A learning algorithm refines these profiles based on historical data and current item characteristics.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication (e.g., Zigbee, Bluetooth LE) between the holder, the central management module, and the drive unit.
*   **Power:** Integrated, rechargeable battery with inductive charging capability. The battery powers the micro-actuators and sensors.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// When Item Added to Holder:
1.  Sense Item Dimensions (length, width, height) & Weight
2.  Determine Optimal Holder Morphology based on sensed dimensions & predefined profiles
3.  Activate Micro-Actuators to adjust Holder Shape
4.  Communicate Updated Holder Dimensions to Central Management Module
5.  Update Access Frequency data based on item.

// When Item Removed from Holder:
1.  Sense Empty Space
2.  Revert to Default Holder Morphology (or pre-defined ‘empty’ profile)
3.  Communicate Updated Holder Dimensions to Central Management Module
4.  Update Access Frequency data based on item.

//Central Management Module Integration:
1.  Receive Holder Dimension Updates
2.  Optimize Storage Location Assignment based on updated dimensions & access frequency
3.  Communicate Instructions to Drive Unit (e.g., adjust gripper size, navigate around obstructions)
```

**Drive Unit Adaptation:**

*   Drive units require adaptable grippers and navigation algorithms to accommodate dynamically changing holder shapes and sizes.
*   A vision system on the drive unit verifies the holder shape before attempting to lift or move it.
*   The central management module optimizes drive unit paths to minimize travel distance and avoid collisions with other dynamically morphing holders.
