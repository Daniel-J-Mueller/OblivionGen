## Adaptive Polarization Patch Antenna Array

**Concept:** Expand the dual-feed patch antenna concept to a dynamically reconfigurable array enabling beam steering and polarization diversity without mechanical movement. This would be beneficial for maintaining signal integrity in dynamic environments and optimizing data throughput.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:** 4x4 array of patch antennas. Each patch element incorporating the dual-feed technology detailed in the provided patent.
*   **Dielectric Substrate:** Rogers 4350B (or equivalent) â€“ chosen for its low loss tangent and good mechanical properties. 1.6mm thickness.
*   **Patch Dimensions:** Each patch element 25mm x 20mm, etched from copper with a thickness of 35um.
*   **Feed Network:** Microstrip feed lines connecting each patch to a central RF switch matrix.
*   **Switch Matrix:** 8x8 SPDT RF switches (Skyworks SMS7630 or equivalent). Controlled by a microcontroller (ESP32 or similar).
*   **Polarization Control:**  Each patch element driven by the dual-feed network, allowing independent control of amplitude and phase of the signals feeding the two orthogonal feeds. This enables full control of polarization (linear, circular, elliptical) and beam steering.
*   **Control Algorithm:**  Microcontroller executes an algorithm based on signal strength feedback (from integrated signal strength sensors). The algorithm dynamically adjusts the amplitude and phase of each feed to maximize signal strength, minimize interference, and maintain optimal polarization.  Algorithm components:
    *   **Beam Steering:**  Phase shift calculations based on desired beam direction.
    *   **Polarization Optimization:**  Adjusts feed amplitudes to minimize signal fading and maximize signal-to-noise ratio.
    *   **Interference Mitigation:**  Null steering to minimize interference from external sources.
*   **Power Supply:** 5V DC.
*   **Communication Interface:** Wi-Fi (ESP32 integrated). Allows for remote monitoring and control of antenna array.
*   **Integration:** Designed to be integrated into the streaming media player PCB. Requires dedicated layer for routing microstrip feed lines and switch matrix control signals.
*   **Calibration:** Factory calibration routine to account for manufacturing variations. User-adjustable calibration parameters accessible through Wi-Fi interface.
*   **Signal Strength Sensors:** Integrated RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) sensors located near each antenna element.
*   **Algorithm Pseudocode:**
    ```
    // Initialization
    calibrate_antennas()
    
    // Main Loop
    while(true){
        // Read signal strength from each sensor
        signal_strength = read_signal_strength()
        
        // Calculate optimal feed amplitudes and phases
        optimal_feed_parameters = calculate_optimal_parameters(signal_strength)
        
        // Set feed parameters for each antenna element
        set_feed_parameters(optimal_feed_parameters)
        
        // Delay for a short period
        delay(100ms)
    }

    // Function to calculate optimal feed parameters
    calculate_optimal_parameters(signal_strength){
        // Implement beam steering and polarization optimization algorithms
        // Based on signal strength feedback
        // Return optimal feed amplitudes and phases
    }
    ```
