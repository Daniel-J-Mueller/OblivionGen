## Adaptive Certificate Revocation with Bloom Filters & Threshold Signatures

**Concept:** Extend the implicit certificate framework to support efficient and privacy-preserving certificate revocation using a combination of Bloom filters and threshold signatures. Current revocation mechanisms (like CRLs or OCSP) introduce bottlenecks and privacy concerns. This aims for a scalable, decentralized revocation system woven into the implicit certificate process.

**Specs:**

*   **Revocation Authority (RA) Setup:**
    *   A distributed network of RAs. Each RA manages a portion of the revocation space.
    *   Each RA generates a key pair for a threshold signature scheme (e.g., Schnorr or BLS). The threshold *t* and total number of signers *n* are configurable.
    *   Public keys of all RAs are published and verifiable.

*   **Certificate Issuance Enhancement:**
    *   When an implicit certificate is issued, a unique certificate identifier (CID) is generated.
    *   The CID is added to a Bloom filter maintained by each RA. The Bloom filter's false positive rate is configurable. This establishes initial 'good standing'.

*   **Revocation Process:**
    *   When a certificate is compromised, the certificate owner or a trusted party initiates a revocation request.
    *   The request includes the CID.
    *   A subset (*t*) of RAs is randomly selected.
    *   These selected RAs collectively sign a revocation message containing the CID using their threshold signature scheme.
    *   The signed revocation message is broadcast or published.

*   **Certificate Verification Enhancement:**
    *   During verification, the verifier performs the following:
        1.  Queries each RA’s Bloom filter with the CID.
        2.  If *all* Bloom filters indicate the CID is *not* revoked, the certificate is considered valid (subject to standard implicit certificate verification).
        3.  The verifier checks for any valid revocation messages with the CID signed by a valid threshold signature. A valid threshold signature means at least *t* RAs have signed the revocation.
        4.  If a valid revocation message exists, the certificate is considered revoked.

*   **Bloom Filter Maintenance:**
    *   Bloom filters are periodically refreshed or rebuilt to reduce false positive rates and accommodate new certificates. Strategies:
        *   **Time-based:** Refresh every *X* hours/days.
        *   **Size-based:** Rebuild when the Bloom filter reaches a certain occupancy level.

*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   Revocation messages only contain CIDs, *not* the underlying identity or other sensitive information.
    *   The distributed nature of the RAs makes it more difficult to track revocation requests or censor certificates.

**Pseudocode (Verification):**

```
function verifyCertificate(certificate, cid):
  // Standard implicit certificate verification
  if !standardVerify(certificate):
    return false

  // Bloom filter check
  for each ra in raList:
    if ra.bloomFilter.contains(cid) == false:
      return false

  // Revocation check
  revocationMessage = getRevocationMessage(cid)
  if revocationMessage != null:
    if isValidThresholdSignature(revocationMessage.signature, revocationMessage.cid, raList):
      return false // Certificate is revoked

  return true // Certificate is valid
```

**Scalability Notes:** Bloom filters provide a space-efficient way to represent revocation status. The threshold signature scheme reduces reliance on a single point of failure and improves security. The distributed nature of the RAs allows for horizontal scaling. Different RA’s can specialize in different portions of the revocation space to improve efficiency.
