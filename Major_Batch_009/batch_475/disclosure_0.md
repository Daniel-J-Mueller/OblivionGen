## Dynamic Skill Chaining & Proactive Correction

**Concept:** Extend the existing endpointing/NLU system to *proactively* chain skills based on predicted user intent *before* full utterance completion, and to allow for automatic correction of chained skill execution based on later NLU results. This creates a more fluid, conversational interaction.

**Specs:**

**1. Intent Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Streaming ASR data, initial NLU output (even partial), user profile data (if available), conversation history.
*   **Function:**  Employs a lightweight neural network (e.g., a small transformer) to predict the *most likely* sequence of skills the user intends to activate, given the partial utterance.  Outputs a probability distribution over potential skill chains.  This is *distinct* from the final NLU output; it's a forward-looking prediction.
*   **Output:**  Ranked list of potential skill chains with associated confidence scores.

**2. Provisional Skill Activation:**

*   **Trigger:** When the Intent Prediction Module’s confidence score for the *top* skill chain exceeds a threshold (configurable per skill).
*   **Action:**  Initiate the first skill in the predicted chain *before* the full utterance is processed.  Pass a “provisional” data structure to the skill, indicating that execution is tentative and subject to correction.
*   **Data Structure (“ProvisionalData”):** Contains the partial ASR transcript, the initial NLU output, and a flag indicating provisional status.  The skill should *not* perform irreversible actions based on this data.  It should primarily focus on gathering clarifying information or preparing a response.

**3. NLU Correction & Skill Adjustment:**

*   **Process:** As the full utterance is processed and final NLU results are available, compare the predicted skill chain with the actual NLU intent.
*   **Correction Logic:**
    *   **Match:** If the predicted chain matches the actual intent, mark the skills as “confirmed” and allow full execution.
    *   **Mismatch – Skill Substitution:** If a skill in the predicted chain is incorrect, *pause* the current skill execution (using a defined API), substitute the correct skill, and activate it with the latest NLU results. The paused skill remains in a recoverable state (e.g., saving its internal state) should it be needed later.
    *   **Mismatch – Chain Insertion:** If the actual intent requires a skill *not* in the predicted chain, insert it at the appropriate point in the sequence.
    *   **Mismatch – Chain Abort:**  If the entire predicted chain is incorrect, abort all provisional skills and re-initiate NLU processing to determine the correct intent.
*   **API:** Skills must implement a standardized API for pausing, resuming, and recovering state.

**4.  Self-Correction Integration:**

*   Leverage the existing patent's self-correction capabilities. When the NLU identifies a self-correction, *immediately* update the active skill chain and re-route execution as needed. This is distinct from the general mismatch correction, and should take precedence.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - NLU Correction):**

```pseudocode
function correct_skill_chain(predicted_chain, actual_intent, active_skills):
  if predicted_chain == actual_intent:
    # Confirm all active skills
    for skill in active_skills:
      skill.confirm_execution()
    return

  mismatches = find_mismatches(predicted_chain, actual_intent)

  for mismatch in mismatches:
    if mismatch.type == "skill_substitution":
      pause_skill(mismatch.predicted_skill)
      activate_skill(mismatch.actual_skill, latest_NLU_results)
    elif mismatch.type == "chain_insertion":
      insert_skill(mismatch.new_skill, latest_NLU_results)
    elif mismatch.type == "chain_abort":
      abort_all_skills(active_skills)
      reinitiate_NLU(latest_asr_data)

  # Apply self-correction if present
  if self_correction_detected():
    update_skill_chain(self_correction_results)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency – Proactive skill activation improves responsiveness.
*   More natural conversations – Dynamic chain adjustment creates a more fluid interaction.
*   Improved accuracy – Self-correction and NLU mismatch correction reduce errors.
*   Enhanced user experience – A more intelligent and responsive assistant.
