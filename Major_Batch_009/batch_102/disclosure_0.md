## Dynamic Key Sharding with Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the key usage limitation concept by *dynamically* sharding cryptographic keys based on both data sensitivity *and* time. Instead of a single policy limiting overall key usage, implement a system where a key is algorithmically split into multiple "key fragments". Access to these fragments is controlled via a time-decaying permission structure.

**Specs:**

*   **Key Sharding Algorithm:** Implement a Shamir Secret Sharing (or similar) algorithm. The master key is split into *n* fragments. *n* is configurable, tied to data sensitivity levels. Higher sensitivity = more fragments.
*   **Temporal Access Control:** Associate each key fragment with a "validity window."  This window dictates when a fragment can be used for decryption/signing. Validity windows are determined by data classification (e.g., "Highly Confidential - 24hr validity", "Internal Use - 7 day validity").
*   **Fragment Distribution:** Fragments are distributed across a trusted execution environment (TEE) network â€“ ideally utilizing a hardware security module (HSM) cluster or secure enclaves. Redundancy is key (k out of n fragments required for reconstruction).
*   **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** All cryptographic operations pass through a PEP. The PEP verifies the current time against the validity window of the required key fragments.
*   **Reconstruction Proxy:**  A designated reconstruction proxy is responsible for assembling the full key from available fragments *within* the PEP.  This prevents full keys from being exposed outside the secure environment.
*   **Auditing:** All key fragment access and reconstruction attempts are logged with timestamps, user IDs, and data identifiers.

**Pseudocode (PEP Logic):**

```
function process_crypto_request(data, operation_type, user_id):
  data_classification = classify_data(data)
  required_fragments = determine_fragments(data_classification)
  available_fragments = get_fragments(user_id, required_fragments)

  if (size(available_fragments) < threshold(required_fragments)):
    log_access_denied(user_id, data)
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  reconstructed_key = reconstruct_key(available_fragments)

  if (reconstructed_key is invalid):
    log_reconstruction_failure(user_id, data)
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  result = perform_crypto_operation(data, reconstructed_key, operation_type)
  log_operation_success(user_id, data)
  return result

function classify_data(data):
  #Implement data classification logic based on metadata and/or content analysis
  return data_classification_level

function determine_fragments(data_classification_level):
  # Map data classification to a set of required key fragments
  return fragment_set
```

**Innovation:**  This system goes beyond simple usage limits by introducing *temporal* control and dynamic key sharding.  The time-decaying access reduces the window of opportunity for a compromised key to be exploited, and sharding reduces the blast radius of any individual compromise. It adapts to data sensitivity *at runtime* instead of relying on static policies. The PEP ensures that only authorized fragments, valid at the current time, are used for cryptographic operations.
