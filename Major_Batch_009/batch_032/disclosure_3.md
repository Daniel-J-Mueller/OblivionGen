## Dynamic Acoustic Shadowing & Occlusion Mapping

**Concept:** Expand directional audio beyond simple location-based panning and volume adjustments. Implement a system that dynamically models acoustic shadows and occlusion based on the 3D environment and object properties, creating a far more realistic and immersive audio experience.

**Specifications:**

**I. Environmental Mapping & Material Properties:**

*   **Real-time Ray Tracing Integration:** Utilize existing or implement basic ray tracing to calculate sound propagation paths. This doesn’t require full path tracing for visuals, only for audio path calculation.
*   **Material Database:**  Create a database of materials with associated acoustic properties:
    *   *Absorption Coefficient:*  Value representing how much sound energy is absorbed by the material.
    *   *Reflection Coefficient:* Value representing how much sound energy is reflected.
    *   *Diffusion Coefficient:*  Value representing how much sound is scattered.
    *   *Material Geometry Details:* Level of detail defining surface irregularities impacting sound diffusion.
*   **Dynamic Occlusion Volumes:** Algorithmically generate occlusion volumes around objects. These volumes define areas where sound propagation is blocked. The system must track object movement in real-time and update these volumes accordingly.
*   **Environmental Mesh Simplification:** To reduce computational load, implement a dynamic mesh simplification algorithm that adjusts the level of detail of environmental geometry based on distance from the sound source and listener.

**II. Acoustic Simulation Engine:**

*   **Sound Source Emission:** Each sound source emits “sound rays” in multiple directions.  The number of rays should be configurable based on desired accuracy vs. performance.
*   **Ray Propagation & Interaction:**
    *   Rays travel until they intersect with an object’s surface.
    *   Upon intersection, the ray’s energy is split based on the material’s reflection, absorption, and diffusion coefficients.
    *   Reflected rays continue propagation. Absorbed energy is removed from the simulation. Diffused rays are scattered in multiple directions.
*   **Acoustic Shadow Calculation:**  Track rays blocked by objects, creating “acoustic shadows” in areas behind obstructions.  The intensity of the shadow is proportional to the size and density of the blocking object.
*   **Early Reflections Modeling:**  Capture the first few reflected sound rays reaching the listener’s position. These early reflections are crucial for creating a sense of spaciousness.

**III. Listener Rendering:**

*   **Binaural Rendering:** Use Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) to simulate how sound reaches the listener's ears from different directions.
*   **Dynamic HRTF Adjustment:**  Adjust HRTF parameters based on the listener's head orientation and position within the environment.
*   **Acoustic Shadow & Reflection Integration:**  Apply acoustic shadow and reflection data to the HRTF processing, realistically simulating how sound is blocked or reflected before reaching the listener’s ears.
*   **Per-Ear Audio Processing:**  Process audio independently for each ear, incorporating differences in arrival time, intensity, and frequency content.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Ray Propagation):**

```
Function PropagateRay(ray, environment):
  intersection = ray.intersect(environment)
  if intersection:
    material = intersection.material
    reflectionEnergy = ray.energy * material.reflectionCoefficient
    absorptionEnergy = ray.energy * material.absorptionCoefficient
    diffusionEnergy = ray.energy * material.diffusionCoefficient

    // Create new reflected rays
    newRays = generateReflectedRays(ray, intersection)
    for newRay in newRays:
      newRay.energy = reflectionEnergy / len(newRays)
      PropagateRay(newRay, environment)

    // Update ray energy
    ray.energy -= (absorptionEnergy + diffusionEnergy)
  else:
    // Ray reaches listener
    renderAudio(ray)
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   **Optimization:** Ray tracing can be computationally expensive. Implement optimizations such as spatial partitioning (octrees or BVH) and early ray termination.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of sound sources and a complex environment.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Leverage GPU acceleration for ray tracing and audio processing.
*   **Real-time Performance:**  Target a frame rate of at least 60 FPS for smooth audio rendering.
