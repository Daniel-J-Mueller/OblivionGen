## Adaptive Focal Plane Projection

**Concept:** Extend autofocus beyond a single focal plane to dynamically project a tailored focal plane onto the scene, optimized for object recognition and augmented reality overlays, rather than simply achieving sharpness.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution camera module with a micro-lens array (MLA) integrated directly onto the sensor. Each micro-lens is individually addressable via electrostatic control.
    *   Depth sensor (ToF or structured light) with a minimum resolution of 640x480.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (GPU/FPGA) for real-time MLA control and depth data processing.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - 6DoF (accelerometer, gyroscope) for motion tracking.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Depth Map Generation:**  Process depth sensor data to generate a high-resolution depth map of the scene.
    *   **Object Segmentation:** Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., Mask R-CNN, YOLO) to identify and segment objects within the depth map.
    *   **Focal Plane Projection Algorithm:**
        1.  **Object Priority:** Assign a priority score to each identified object based on user input, pre-defined rules, or learned preferences.  (e.g., faces have highest priority, background objects have lowest)
        2.  **Focal Plane Calculation:** For each object, calculate the optimal focal plane distance based on its depth value and priority.
        3.  **MLA Control Map Generation:** Generate a control map for the micro-lens array, dynamically adjusting the angle of each micro-lens to "bend" the light rays and project the calculated focal planes onto the corresponding objects in the scene.
        4.  **Motion Compensation:**  Utilize IMU data to compensate for camera motion and stabilize the projected focal planes.
    *   **AR Overlay Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate AR overlays with the dynamically projected focal planes, ensuring that AR content appears correctly focused and aligned with the real-world scene.
    *   **User Interface:** Allow users to manually adjust object priorities and focal plane settings.

**Pseudocode (Focal Plane Projection Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION ProjectFocalPlanes(depthMap, objectData, objectPriorities):

    FOR EACH object IN objectData:
        distance = object.depth
        priority = objectPriorities[object.ID]

        // Calculate optimal focal plane based on distance & priority
        focalPlaneDistance = CalculateFocalDistance(distance, priority)

        // Generate MLA control map for this object
        mlaControlMap = GenerateMLAControlMap(focalPlaneDistance, object.boundingbox)

        // Apply control map to MLA
        ApplyMLAControlMap(mlaControlMap)

    END FOR

END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Advanced Photography/Videography:** Achieve selective focus effects without post-processing.
*   **Augmented Reality:** Create more realistic and immersive AR experiences.
*   **Robotics:** Enable robots to perceive and interact with their environment more effectively.
*   **Medical Imaging:**  Improve the clarity and accuracy of medical images.
*   **Security Systems:** Enhance object recognition and tracking capabilities.
