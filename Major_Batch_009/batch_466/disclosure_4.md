## Query Shadowing & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the execution time prediction system to proactively "shadow" incoming queries across multiple potential query engines *before* committing to a single execution path.  This allows for a more nuanced understanding of query behavior and enables dynamic resource allocation *during* query execution, not just at the outset.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Query Initiation:** Upon receiving a query, the system initiates a "shadow" execution on a configurable subset of query engines *concurrently* with initial plan analysis. These shadow executions run with limited resources (e.g., restricted CPU/memory allocation, sampling of data) – think of them as highly accelerated “dry runs”.
*   **Real-Time Profiling:** Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) *during* shadow execution. This includes not just elapsed time, but also I/O rates, CPU utilization, memory access patterns, and network latency. These metrics should be captured at a granular level (e.g., per operator in the query plan).
*   **Dynamic Resource Adjustment:** Based on real-time profiling, the system dynamically adjusts resource allocation for the shadow executions.  If a shadow execution appears promising (e.g., low I/O, high CPU utilization, predictable latency), it receives increased resources.  If it falters, resources are curtailed. This creates a self-optimizing feedback loop.
*   **Weighted Prediction Model:**  The final execution time prediction is no longer based on a single model, but a weighted average of predictions derived from each shadow execution. Weights are determined by the quality of the shadow execution (e.g., completion rate, resource utilization, prediction accuracy on historical data).
*   **Mid-Query Migration:**  Enable the ability to *migrate* a query from one query engine to another *during* execution if a more favorable execution path emerges. This requires careful state management and potentially re-materialization of intermediate results, but can unlock significant performance gains.
*   **Workload Balancing:** Use the shadow execution data to predict future workload demands and proactively provision or de-provision query engines. This enables more efficient resource utilization and reduces the risk of bottlenecks.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function processQuery(query, engines):
  shadowExecutions = []
  for engine in engines:
    shadowExecutions.append(startShadowExecution(query, engine))

  while any(shadowExecution.isRunning()):
    for shadowExecution in shadowExecutions:
      if shadowExecution.isRunning():
        collectPerformanceMetrics(shadowExecution)
        adjustResourceAllocation(shadowExecution)
        updatePredictionModel(shadowExecution)

  bestEngine = selectBestEngine(shadowExecutions)

  if midQueryMigrationEnabled():
    migrateQuery(query, bestEngine)

  executeQuery(query, bestEngine)

function selectBestEngine(shadowExecutions):
  // Calculate a weighted score for each engine based on
  // prediction accuracy, resource utilization, and completion rate
  // Return the engine with the highest score
```

**Novelty:** Current systems focus on static prediction *before* execution.  This system introduces dynamic prediction and adaptation *during* execution, enabling a more responsive and efficient query processing pipeline. The mid-query migration is a high-risk, high-reward feature that differentiates this system from existing approaches.
