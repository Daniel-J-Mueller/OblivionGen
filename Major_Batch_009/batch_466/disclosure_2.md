## Compartment-Based Resource Orchestration with Dynamic Policy Inheritance

**Concept:** Extend the compartment model to not just isolate resources, but actively *orchestrate* resource allocation based on compartment policies, dynamically inheriting and adapting those policies across nested compartments and even temporarily applying them to resources outside of defined compartments.

**Specification:**

**1. Policy Definition Language (PDL):**
   *   Introduce a PDL allowing administrators to define resource allocation and behavior policies at the compartment level. Policies would specify criteria based on resource type, cost, performance, security, or other relevant metrics.
   *   Example PDL snippet:
        ```
        compartment: "Development"
        policy:
            resource_type: "GPU"
            max_cost: "$100/day"
            priority: "Low"
            allowed_users: ["devteam1", "devteam2"]
        ```

**2. Dynamic Policy Inheritance Engine:**
   *   Implement an engine that dynamically inherits and applies policies. Child compartments inherit policies from their parent, potentially overriding or extending them.
   *   The engine must support:
        *   **Policy Merging:** Combining policies from multiple levels of inheritance.
        *   **Policy Conflict Resolution:** Predefined rules or administrator-defined logic to resolve conflicting policies.
        *   **Time-Based Policies:** Policies active only during specific time windows.

**3. Transient Policy Application:**
    * Allow administrators to *temporarily* apply compartment policies to resources outside of defined compartments (e.g., a production server) for limited-duration testing or troubleshooting. This enables safe experimentation without permanent configuration changes.
    *  Mechanism:  Introduce a "policy overlay" feature.  An administrator selects a resource, a compartment, and a duration.  The resource temporarily operates as if it were within that compartment.
    *  Logging: All transient policy applications are fully logged with administrator details, resource details, compartment details and duration.

**4. Automated Resource Provisioning & Adjustment:**

*   Based on defined policies and real-time resource usage, the system automatically provisions or adjusts resources within compartments.
*   If a compartmentâ€™s usage approaches a defined cost limit, the system automatically scales down non-critical resources or provision cheaper alternatives.
*   Automated response is programmable and extensible via hooks.

**5.  Policy-Driven Access Control:**

*   Extend the existing identity management system to leverage compartment policies for access control.
*   Instead of directly assigning permissions to users, assign users to compartments.  Permissions are then implicitly derived from the compartment policies.
*   Supports role-based access control (RBAC) within compartments.

**Pseudocode Example (Automated Scaling):**

```
function monitor_compartment_usage(compartment_id):
  usage_data = get_usage_data(compartment_id)
  policy = get_compartment_policy(compartment_id)

  if usage_data.cost > policy.max_cost * 0.8:  # 80% threshold
    if policy.auto_scale_down:
      scale_down_resources(compartment_id)
    else:
      send_alert(policy.admin_email, "Compartment cost approaching limit.")

function scale_down_resources(compartment_id):
  resources = get_resources_in_compartment(compartment_id)
  for resource in resources:
    if resource.priority == "Low":
      deallocate_resource(resource)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Compartment:** `id`, `name`, `parent_id`, `policy`, `resources`
*   **Policy:** `max_cost`, `priority`, `allowed_users`, `auto_scale_down`
*   **Resource:** `id`, `type`, `cost`, `priority`, `compartment_id`
