## Dynamic NLU Model Composition via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Instead of pre-defining specific domain-specific NLU models, this system learns to *compose* NLU models from a library of modular components during runtime, optimized for each input utterance. This shifts from a static model selection to a dynamic, learned composition.

**Specifications:**

*   **Modular NLU Component Library:** A collection of reusable NLU components. These components are small, focused models responsible for specific tasks (e.g., entity type classification, intent detection, coreference resolution, sentiment analysis, slot filling, relation extraction). Each component has an associated cost (computational resources, latency) and a confidence score representing its reliability.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An RL agent is trained to select and combine modular NLU components.
    *   **State:** The current state is represented by the input utterance (text), the ASR confidence score (if applicable), and the intermediate NLU results (e.g., identified entities, extracted intent).
    *   **Action:**  The action space consists of selecting a modular NLU component to apply to the current state. Actions can also include ‘stop’ which signifies completion of NLU processing.
    *   **Reward:** The reward function is multifaceted:
        *   **Accuracy:** Based on the NLU result's alignment with ground truth (when available - training data)
        *   **Efficiency:** Penalizes the use of computationally expensive components and longer processing times.
        *   **Confidence:**  Rewards the selection of components with high confidence scores.
        *   **Coverage:** Encourages component selection that ensures all relevant information in the utterance is processed.
*   **Composition Engine:** This engine takes the sequence of selected components and combines their outputs to produce a final NLU result. It employs a weighting mechanism to prioritize results from more reliable components.
*   **Training Data:** A large corpus of utterances with ground truth NLU annotations. This data is used to train the RL agent. Simulated data, generated by varying sentence structure and domain, will augment this corpus.
*   **Runtime Adaptation:** The RL agent continuously refines its policy based on real-world usage and feedback. Online learning techniques can be used to adapt to changing user behavior and new domains.

**Pseudocode (RL Agent’s Decision Loop):**

```
function select_nlu_components(utterance, current_state, policy):
    action = policy.choose_action(current_state) // Selects a component or 'stop'
    if action == 'stop':
        return final_nlu_result // Stop processing
    else:
        component = action
        intermediate_result = apply_component(component, utterance, current_state)
        new_state = update_state(intermediate_result)
        return select_nlu_components(utterance, new_state, policy)
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond static NLU pipelines to a dynamic, learned composition of modular components. The RL agent optimizes the NLU process for each utterance, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and confidence. This enables faster, more accurate, and more adaptable speech interfaces.  It provides a framework to scale NLU capabilities to new domains with minimal model retraining.
