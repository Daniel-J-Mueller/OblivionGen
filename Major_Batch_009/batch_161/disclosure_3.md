## Dynamic Ontology Construction & Temporal Drift Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the semantic relationship discovery beyond static ontologies. Introduce a system that *constructs* ontologies on the fly *and* tracks how those relationships evolve over time, explicitly modelling ‘semantic drift’.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Data Structure: Relational Graph with Temporal Tags**

*   **Nodes:** Represent values (from the key-value data). Each node stores:
    *   `value`: The string representation of the data value.
    *   `key_origin`: The key associated with the value in the original data source.
    *   `creation_timestamp`: Timestamp indicating when the node was first introduced.
*   **Edges:** Represent semantic relationships between nodes. Each edge stores:
    *   `source_node`: Pointer to the source node.
    *   `target_node`: Pointer to the target node.
    *   `relationship_type`: Categorical value representing the relationship (e.g., synonym, antonym, hypernym, hyponym, related).  This could be expanded with confidence scores.
    *   `creation_timestamp`: Timestamp of edge creation.
    *   `decay_rate`: A configurable value representing the rate at which the edge’s weight degrades over time.  Higher rates indicate a more volatile relationship.
    *   `current_weight`: A floating-point value representing the strength of the relationship, updated periodically based on `decay_rate` and observed co-occurrence.

**2.  Relationship Discovery Engine:**

*   **Initial Seed:** Leverage existing ontologies (WordNet, etc.) to provide initial seed relationships and confidence scores.
*   **Co-occurrence Analysis:**  Analyze the key-value data to identify values that frequently appear with each other within the same key or across related keys.  This provides evidence for potential relationships.
*   **Embedding Generation:** Utilize a pre-trained or fine-tuned language model (BERT, RoBERTa) to generate vector embeddings for each value. Calculate cosine similarity between embeddings to quantify semantic similarity.
*   **Dynamic Edge Creation/Weight Adjustment:**
    *   If two values are found to co-occur frequently or have high embedding similarity, create a new edge (if one doesn't already exist) or increase the weight of an existing edge.
    *   Periodically decay the weight of all edges based on their `decay_rate`.  Edges with consistently low weight are pruned.
    *   Introduce a "drift factor" which is a stochastic element modulating the `decay_rate` – this models unexpected shifts in meaning.

**3. Temporal Drift Analysis Module:**

*   **Relationship Lifespan Tracking:** Monitor the lifespan of each relationship (time between creation and pruning).
*   **Drift Detection:** Identify relationships where the weight rapidly decreases over a short period, indicating a potential semantic drift.
*   **Anomaly Reporting:** Flag potentially drifting relationships for human review.
*   **Trend Analysis:** Aggregate data on relationship lifespans and drift rates to identify broader trends in semantic change within the dataset.

**4.  Algorithm Pseudocode (Edge Weight Update):**

```
function update_edge_weight(edge, co_occurrence_count, similarity_score, time_delta):
  # time_delta is the time since the last update

  # Calculate weight decay
  decay_factor = exp(-edge.decay_rate * time_delta)

  # Calculate weight increase based on co-occurrence and similarity
  increase_factor = (co_occurrence_count * similarity_score)

  # Update edge weight
  edge.current_weight = edge.current_weight * decay_factor + increase_factor

  # Ensure weight remains within bounds (e.g., 0-1)
  edge.current_weight = clamp(edge.current_weight, 0, 1)

  return edge
```

**5. System Integration:**

*   This system can be integrated into existing data ingestion pipelines.
*   Provides an API for querying the relational graph and retrieving semantic relationships.
*   Provides a user interface for visualizing the graph and exploring semantic drifts.
