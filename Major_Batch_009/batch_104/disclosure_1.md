## Modular Nesting System with Active Height Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand the concept of variable nesting height to include *active* height adjustment via integrated micro-actuators within the nesting features. This creates a dynamic nesting system capable of adapting to variable loads, automated sorting, or even creating temporary, self-leveling platforms.

**Specs:**

*   **Container Body:** Primarily constructed from a durable, lightweight polymer (polypropylene or similar). Square or rectangular cross-section preferred for stability. Dimensions scalable to various use cases.
*   **Nesting Features (Exterior - Primary Container):** Each sidewall features at least three distinct ‘nodes’ – raised, circular platforms designed to interface with corresponding recesses on the interior of the receiving container. These nodes are *not* fixed.
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Each node houses a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric or micro-servo). These actuators are controlled wirelessly via a low-power Bluetooth mesh network.
*   **Power Source:** Each container incorporates a thin-film rechargeable battery and a wireless charging receiver (inductive charging).
*   **Sensor Suite:** Each container includes an accelerometer and gyroscope to determine orientation and stability. A weight sensor within the base detects load.
*   **Receiving Container Features (Interior):** Corresponding recessed areas designed to receive and support the exterior nodes. These recesses include proximity sensors to detect node presence and position.
*   **Control System:** A central control unit (or distributed network) manages the actuator network. The system can operate in several modes:
    *   **Passive Nesting:** Actuators remain static, functioning as described in the original patent.
    *   **Adaptive Leveling:** Based on accelerometer/gyroscope data, actuators dynamically adjust to maintain a level nesting surface, even on uneven ground.
    *   **Automated Sorting:**  Actuators raise/lower containers within a larger system to direct them along different paths based on weight or other criteria.
    *   **Platform Creation:** Multiple containers can coordinate to raise their nesting features, creating a temporary, level platform capable of supporting a load.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Leveling Mode):**

```
// Container Initialization
function initializeContainer() {
  connectToNetwork();
  calibrateAccelerometer();
  activateWeightSensor();
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  readAccelerometerData();
  readWeightData();

  // Calculate Tilt Angle
  tiltAngle = calculateTiltAngle(accelerometerData);

  // Calculate Actuator Adjustment
  actuatorAdjustment = calculateActuatorAdjustment(tiltAngle, weightData);

  // Apply Adjustment to Actuators
  for (i = 0; i < numActuators; i++) {
    adjustActuator(i, actuatorAdjustment);
  }

  delay(100ms);
}

function calculateActuatorAdjustment(tiltAngle, weightData) {
    //Proportional control with weight-based scaling
    adjustment = tiltAngle * Kp + weightData * Kw;
    //Limit maximum adjustment to prevent instability
    if (adjustment > maxAdjustment) {
        adjustment = maxAdjustment;
    }
    if (adjustment < -maxAdjustment) {
        adjustment = -maxAdjustment;
    }
    return adjustment;
}
```

**Material Considerations:**

*   Containers: Injection molded polypropylene or similar high-strength polymer.
*   Actuators: Miniature piezoelectric actuators or micro-servos with durable housings.
*   Sensors: MEMS-based accelerometers, gyroscopes, and weight sensors.
*   Wireless Communication: Low-power Bluetooth mesh network modules.
