## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Directed Audio Beaming

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple proximity detection for audio routing. Create a system that dynamically maps a physical space, identifies occupants *and* their activity (conversation, music listening, phone call), and then directs audio – whether from the PSTN call, streamed content, or local microphone input – *specifically* to that individual using directed audio beaming.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of miniature, beamforming microphones (minimum 8, optimally 16-32) embedded in a ceiling or wall-mounted unit.  Each microphone connected to a dedicated DSP.
    *   Array of high-frequency ultrasonic transducers (minimum 8, optimally 16-32) – similar spatial distribution to microphones.  These will generate localized audio 'sweet spots'.
    *   Central processing unit (edge device – e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 or similar) for data fusion and control.
    *   Network connectivity (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) for integration with existing smart home systems and external data sources (e.g., calendar, presence detection).
    *   Optional: Low-resolution wide-angle camera for visual activity recognition (supplementing audio analysis).

*   **Software:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Module:**  Utilizes microphone array data to create a real-time 3D map of the room’s acoustic environment.  Identifies sound sources and their locations.  Employs source localization techniques (e.g., Time Difference of Arrival, beamforming) and potentially machine learning for improved accuracy.
    *   **Activity Recognition Module:**  Analyzes audio features (speech patterns, music genre, sound events) and potentially visual data to infer occupant activity. This goes beyond simple 'presence' - recognizes 'phone call', 'conversation', 'music listening', 'watching TV', ‘silent reading’, etc.  This module leverages pre-trained machine learning models (e.g., audio event detection) and potentially custom models trained on user-specific data.
    *   **Beamforming Control Module:**  Dynamically adjusts the ultrasonic transducer array to create localized 'sweet spots' of audio. This module uses the output of the acoustic mapping and activity recognition modules to direct audio *specifically* to the individual engaged in the target activity.  Beamforming algorithms (e.g., delay-and-sum, minimum variance distortionless response) are employed to maximize audio clarity and minimize interference.
    *   **Integration Module:**  Connects with existing smart home systems (e.g., Alexa, Google Home) and allows for voice control of the system. Enables integration with calendar applications to anticipate activity patterns (e.g., automatically adjust audio settings during scheduled meetings).
    *   **User Profile Management:** Allows users to define their preferences for audio settings, activity recognition, and privacy.

*   **Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Acquire Audio Data from Microphone Array
  audioData = acquireAudioData();

  // 2. Perform Acoustic Mapping
  acousticMap = createAcousticMap(audioData);

  // 3. Identify Occupants and Activities
  occupantData = identifyOccupants(acousticMap);
  activityData = recognizeActivities(acousticMap, occupantData);

  // 4. Determine Target Audio Routing
  for each (occupant in occupantData) {
    if (activityData[occupant] == "phone call") {
      // Route PSTN audio to occupant's location using beamforming
      beamform(occupant.location, pstnAudioStream);
    } else if (activityData[occupant] == "music listening") {
      // Route music stream to occupant's location using beamforming
      beamform(occupant.location, musicStream);
    } else {
      // Silence audio at occupant's location
      beamform(occupant.location, silence);
    }
  }

  // 5. Repeat
}
```

*   **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Haptic feedback integration (localized vibration) to enhance audio experience.
    *   Privacy mode (disables microphones and ultrasonic transducers).
    *   Adaptive noise cancellation based on environmental conditions.
    *   Multi-room audio synchronization.
    *   Integration with virtual reality/augmented reality devices.
