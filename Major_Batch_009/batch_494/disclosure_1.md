## Adaptive Hashing with Predictive Pre-fetching

**Concept:** Extend the internal hashing scheme to proactively pre-fetch and hash data portions *before* updates occur, based on predicted access patterns and data relationships. This allows for near-instantaneous hash generation upon update confirmation, reducing latency for systems requiring rapid integrity checks or transactional consistency.

**Specs:**

1.  **Relationship Graph:** Maintain a directed graph representing relationships between data portions. Nodes represent data portions (as defined in the patent), and edges represent relationships (e.g., foreign keys, containment, sequential access).  Edge weights represent the probability of access or modification based on historical data.

2.  **Access Pattern Prediction:** Implement a predictive model (e.g., Markov chain, LSTM neural network) trained on historical access logs. This model predicts the probability of accessing specific data portions given a current operation or a sequence of operations.  The model outputs a confidence score alongside each prediction.

3.  **Pre-fetch Queue:** Create a priority queue for data portions to be pre-fetched.  Priority is determined by a combined score: `(Prediction Confidence * Relationship Weight) / (Data Portion Size)`.  Larger portions have a lower priority to avoid excessive pre-fetching.

4.  **Background Hashing Worker:**  A dedicated worker thread continuously pulls data portions from the pre-fetch queue. It calculates and stores internal hash values for those portions before they are modified.  These hashes are stored in a dedicated, low-latency cache.

5.  **Update Interception & Hash Composition:** When an update occurs, the system first checks if a pre-calculated hash exists for the modified portion in the cache. If it exists, the new hash value is immediately available.  Otherwise, the update is processed as in the original patent, but with the benefit of pre-calculated hashes for unaffected portions.

6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor the accuracy of the access pattern prediction model.  Adjust the weights of the priority calculation in the pre-fetch queue based on observed prediction errors. If prediction accuracy is consistently low for certain data portions, reduce their priority or exclude them from pre-fetching.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Update Handling):**

```
function handleUpdate(dataPortion, updateData):
  if precalculatedHashExists(dataPortion):
    newHash = calculateHash(updateData) // Only hash the updated data
    updatedInternalHash = combineHashes(newHash, storedUnaffectedHashes)
    return updatedInternalHash
  else:
    // Original patent logic â€“ calculate hashes for all affected portions
    // (including potentially pre-fetching for future updates)
    // ...
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `RelationshipGraph`: Adjacency list or matrix representing data portion relationships.
*   `PredictionModel`: Trained model for predicting access patterns.
*   `PreFetchQueue`: Priority queue implemented with a heap data structure.
*   `HashCache`: Low-latency cache (e.g., Redis, in-memory hash table) for storing pre-calculated internal hash values.
