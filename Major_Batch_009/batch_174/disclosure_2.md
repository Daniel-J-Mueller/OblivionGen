## Modular, Self-Healing Power Distribution Network

**Concept:** A server power distribution system leveraging distributed, modular power delivery units (PDUs) with automated fault detection and rerouting capabilities. Inspired by the compartmentalization suggested by mounting components on sidewalls, this expands that principle to the *entire* power delivery infrastructure.

**Specs:**

*   **PDU Modules:** Small, hot-swappable PDUs, roughly 1U in height, designed to mount directly onto a server chassis’ internal sidewalls *and* into a dedicated backplane. Each module handles a limited but defined set of server components (e.g., CPU, DIMMs, one NVMe drive).
*   **Backplane:** A conductive backplane running along the server’s sidewalls. This backplane isn't merely a physical support; it’s an integral part of the power distribution *and* communication network.  It carries both power *and* data signals.
*   **Power Source:** Redundant, high-efficiency power supply units (PSUs) providing a DC voltage to the backplane.
*   **Data Communication:** Each PDU module contains a microcontroller with a communication interface (e.g., I2C, SPI) connected to the backplane. This allows PDUs to report status, voltage/current readings, and detected faults.
*   **Fault Detection:** Each PDU constantly monitors its output voltage and current. If a fault is detected (over-current, under-voltage, short circuit), the PDU isolates itself *and* transmits a fault signal via the backplane.
*   **Automated Rerouting:** The server’s main controller (or a dedicated subsystem) receives fault signals.  It then analyzes the failure and dynamically reroutes power. This is achieved through software control of electronically controlled switches (solid-state relays) embedded in the backplane.  Power is redirected to unaffected PDUs servicing the same component.
*   **Redundancy Levels:**  The system will support several redundancy levels (N+1, 2N).  The redundancy level is configurable via the server BIOS/management interface.
*   **Cascading PDUs:**  PDUs can be cascaded to handle higher power demands.  A “master” PDU manages the power distribution to the cascaded “slave” PDUs.

**Pseudocode (Automated Rerouting):**

```
// Main Server Controller Loop

while (true) {

  // Check for Fault Signals on Backplane
  if (FaultSignalDetected()) {

    FaultID = GetFaultID();
    AffectedComponent = GetAffectedComponent(FaultID);
    AlternatePDU = FindAlternatePDU(AffectedComponent);

    if (AlternatePDU != null) {
      ActivateAlternatePDU(AlternatePDU);
      DeactivateFaultyPDU(FaultyPDU);
      LogEvent("Power Rerouted - Component: " + AffectedComponent + ", From: " + FaultyPDU + ", To: " + AlternatePDU);
    } else {
      LogEvent("Critical Failure - No Alternate PDU Available for Component: " + AffectedComponent);
      // Initiate Server Shutdown Procedure
    }
  }
  // Delay for a short period to reduce CPU load
  Delay(10ms);
}
```

**Physical Implementation Notes:**

*   The backplane will utilize high-current connectors for reliable power delivery.
*   PDUs will incorporate heatsinks or fans for effective thermal management.
*   Robust mechanical locking mechanisms will ensure secure PDU mounting.
*   LED indicators on each PDU will provide visual status information.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased server uptime through automated fault tolerance.
*   Simplified maintenance and repair due to modular design.
*   Improved power efficiency through optimized distribution.
*   Reduced downtime during maintenance (individual PDUs can be swapped without shutting down the entire server).
*   Scalability - Easily add or remove PDUs as needed.
