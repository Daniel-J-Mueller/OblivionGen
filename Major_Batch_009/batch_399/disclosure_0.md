## Adaptive Packet Reconstruction for Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** This system utilizes the dynamic mirroring described in the provided patent not just for capture, but for *reconstruction* of packets, enabling deeper analysis beyond simple header or payload inspection. It aims to detect anomalies by comparing reconstructed packets against expected norms based on learned network behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component Overview:**

*   **Mirroring Engine:** (Leverages existing patent functionality) â€“ Receives and duplicates packets based on specified criteria (IP address, user, etc.).
*   **Reconstruction Buffer:** A high-speed, circular buffer capable of storing fragmented or out-of-order packets associated with a single network flow.
*   **Behavioral Learning Module:** A machine learning component responsible for establishing baseline network behavior.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Compares reconstructed packets against the learned baseline, flagging deviations.
*   **Adaptive Reassembly Logic:** Dynamically adjusts the reassembly parameters (timeout values, maximum fragments, fragment order enforcement) based on detected network conditions and behavioral models.

**2. Data Flow:**

1.  Mirroring Engine duplicates packets destined for/from monitored devices.
2.  Duplicated packets are sent to the Reconstruction Buffer.
3.  Adaptive Reassembly Logic attempts to reconstruct complete packets. It prioritizes reassembly based on flow ID (source/destination IP/port).
4.  Reconstructed packets are passed to the Behavioral Learning Module and the Anomaly Detection Engine.
5.  Behavioral Learning Module updates the baseline model based on observed packet characteristics (size, frequency, inter-arrival times, header fields).
6.  Anomaly Detection Engine compares reconstructed packets against the learned baseline.
7.  Deviations trigger alerts or automated responses (e.g., packet filtering, session termination).

**3. Key Algorithms:**

*   **Dynamic Timeout Adjustment:** The reassembly timeout is dynamically adjusted based on network latency and flow characteristics. A short timeout for low-latency flows, a longer timeout for high-latency flows. The algorithm uses an exponentially weighted moving average of recent RTT (Round Trip Time) measurements.
*   **Fragment Ordering Heuristics:**  A heuristic algorithm prioritizes fragment ordering based on fragment offset and sequence number. If fragments arrive out of order, the algorithm attempts to reorder them using a time-to-live (TTL) based sorting mechanism, assuming older fragments are less likely to be valid.
*   **Behavioral Profiling:** The Behavioral Learning Module uses a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques (e.g., anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM) to build a profile of normal network behavior for each monitored device or user. This profile includes metrics such as packet size distribution, inter-arrival times, protocol usage, and destination IP addresses.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Anomaly Detection Engine assigns a score to each reconstructed packet based on its deviation from the learned baseline. This score is calculated using a weighted combination of different anomaly metrics.

**4. Pseudocode (Adaptive Reassembly Logic):**

```
function reassemble_packet(packet):
  flow_id = extract_flow_id(packet)
  fragment_offset = packet.fragment_offset
  fragment_length = packet.fragment_length

  if flow_id not in active_flows:
    active_flows[flow_id] = {
      "fragments": [],
      "expected_offset": 0,
      "reassembly_timeout": default_timeout
    }

  fragments = active_flows[flow_id]["fragments"]
  expected_offset = active_flows[flow_id]["expected_offset"]
  reassembly_timeout = active_flows[flow_id]["reassembly_timeout"]

  if fragment_offset == expected_offset:
    fragments.append(packet)
    expected_offset += fragment_length

    if len(fragments) == total_fragments:
      # Reassembly complete
      reconstructed_packet = combine_fragments(fragments)
      return reconstructed_packet
  else:
    # Out-of-order fragment
    if len(fragments) == 0:
        fragments.append(packet)
        expected_offset = fragment_length
    else:
      #Handle fragment reordering (heuristic)
      if fragment_offset < expected_offset:
        fragments.append(packet) #Append out of order packets to the buffer
        expected_offset += fragment_length #Update expected offset
      else:
        #Discard if too far out of order (potential replay attack)
        discard_packet(packet)

  #Update reassembly timeout (based on network conditions)
  update_timeout(reassembly_timeout, flow_id)
  return null # Reassembly in progress
```

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Traffic Shaping Integration:** Integrate with traffic shaping tools to automatically mitigate detected anomalies.
*   **Decryption Support:** Support decryption of encrypted traffic (e.g., TLS) for deeper inspection.
*   **Distributed Architecture:** Implement a distributed architecture to handle high-volume network traffic.
*   **Integration with Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Leverage threat intelligence feeds to identify and block malicious traffic.
