## Adaptive Delivery Prioritization & "Shadow" Content

**Concept:** Extend scheduled delivery beyond simple item retrieval to a system that dynamically prioritizes content based on user behavior *and* prefetches "shadow" content anticipating future needs, even before a scheduled delivery time. This goes beyond simply receiving what's scheduled; it's about the system *predicting* what the user will want next and preparing it seamlessly.

**Specs:**

*   **User Behavior Monitoring:** Continuous tracking (with user permission, naturally) of app usage, content consumption (type, duration), location (coarse-grained), and device sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope – for activity level).
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** A machine learning model trained on user behavior data to predict future content requests.  This algorithm outputs a “priority score” for different content types/items.  Higher score = higher priority.
*   **"Shadow" Content Prefetching:** Based on the predictive algorithm, the system proactively downloads "shadow" copies of content *before* scheduled delivery times. These shadow copies are stored locally in a dedicated, sandboxed storage area. Limited storage capacity enforced, older shadow content auto-deleted based on a Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm.
*   **Adaptive Delivery Scheduling:**  The scheduled delivery system is augmented to *reorder* content delivery based on the priority scores. High-priority items are delivered first, even if they were scheduled later in the original schedule.
*   **Content Stitching:**  The system seamlessly integrates pre-fetched "shadow" content with the content received during scheduled delivery. This creates a fluid and uninterrupted user experience.
*   **Bandwidth Management:**  The system intelligently manages bandwidth usage for pre-fetching and scheduled delivery. It prioritizes critical content and delays lower-priority downloads during periods of network congestion.
*   **Offline Availability:** Shadow content is immediately available even if the device loses network connectivity.

**Pseudocode (Delivery Manager):**

```
// On Scheduled Delivery Time
function handleDelivery(schedule) {
  // 1. Fetch content from server based on schedule
  content = server.download(schedule);

  // 2. Check for pre-fetched shadow content
  shadowContent = localStore.getShadowContent();

  // 3. Calculate combined priority
  priorityMap = calculatePriority(content, shadowContent); //Combines priority scores

  // 4. Sort content based on combined priority
  sortedContent = sortContent(priorityMap);

  // 5. Deliver content to user
  deliverContent(sortedContent);

  // 6. Update shadow content store (remove delivered items, add new)
  updateShadowStore(content);
}

function calculatePriority(content, shadowContent) {
    priorityMap = {}
    for(item in content){
        priorityMap[item] = getPriorityScore(item);
    }
    for (item in shadowContent){
        priorityMap[item] = getPriorityScore(item);
    }
    return priorityMap;
}

function getPriorityScore(item){
    // User behavior data, predictive algorithm, etc
    return score;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved user experience.
*   Enhanced offline availability.
*   Optimized bandwidth usage.
*   Proactive content delivery.
*   Increased user engagement.
