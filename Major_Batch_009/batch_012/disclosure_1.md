## Automated Predictive Load Balancing & Transfer System

**Concept:** Expand the testing system to *actively* manage and predict load transitions, effectively creating a self-optimizing power distribution system alongside testing. Instead of just *measuring* transfer times, the system anticipates needs and proactively shifts load to maintain optimal power delivery.

**Specs:**

*   **Modular Load Bank:**  A highly granular, digitally controlled load bank consisting of hundreds (or even thousands) of independent resistive, inductive, and capacitive loads. Each load element is individually addressable and controllable via a digital interface. Physical arrangement optimized for heat dissipation.
*   **Predictive Algorithm Core:**  An AI-driven predictive engine trained on historical load data, real-time sensor readings (voltage, current, temperature, harmonics), and environmental factors (weather, time of day). The algorithm anticipates load fluctuations and predicts optimal transfer times *before* they are needed.
*   **Dynamic Transfer Matrix:**  A configurable matrix allowing any load element (or combination) to be switched between primary and secondary power sources.  This is the "muscle" of the system, enabling dynamic load balancing.  Utilizes solid-state switches (IGBTs, MOSFETs) for fast and reliable switching.
*   **Sensor Network:**  A comprehensive network of sensors monitoring:
    *   Input power quality (voltage, current, THD) on both primary & secondary feeds.
    *   Load current at individual load elements and aggregated groups.
    *   Temperature within the load bank and surrounding environment.
    *   Ambient conditions (humidity, temperature).
*   **Real-Time Data Acquisition & Processing:**  High-speed data acquisition system with dedicated processing unit. Data is filtered, processed, and fed into the predictive algorithm.
*   **Closed-Loop Control System:**  Algorithm outputs commands to the dynamic transfer matrix, shifting load as needed. Sensor data provides feedback to the algorithm, creating a closed-loop control system.
*   **User Interface (UI):** Web-based UI with:
    *   Real-time visualization of load distribution, power consumption, and system status.
    *   Historical data logging and analysis tools.
    *   Configurable parameters for the predictive algorithm.
    *   Manual override controls for testing and troubleshooting.

**Pseudocode (Core Control Loop):**

```
//Initialization
load historical data
train predictive algorithm
establish sensor connections
initialize dynamic transfer matrix

//Main Control Loop
while (true) {
    //Acquire sensor data
    sensorData = readSensors()

    //Predict future load demand
    predictedLoad = predictLoad(sensorData)

    //Calculate optimal load distribution
    optimalDistribution = calculateOptimalDistribution(predictedLoad)

    //Adjust dynamic transfer matrix
    adjustTransferMatrix(optimalDistribution)

    //Log data for analysis
    logData(sensorData, optimalDistribution)

    //Delay for next iteration
    delay(100ms)
}
```

**Novelty:**  Existing automatic transfer switch (ATS) testing focuses on *reaction* â€“ measuring how quickly the system responds to a power failure. This system proactively *predicts* load changes and *dynamically balances* load to optimize power delivery and minimize disruptions. It transforms the ATS test setup from a passive measurement tool into an active power management system. Further, the granular load control enables much more precise and realistic testing scenarios.
