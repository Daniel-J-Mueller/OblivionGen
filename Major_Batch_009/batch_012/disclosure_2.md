## Adaptive Key Derivation via Biometric Drift

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Module:** Biometric Drift Key Derivation (BDKD)
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Standard computing system with biometric sensor (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint) integration. Secure Enclave/TPM recommended for key storage.
*   **Software Requirements:** Operating System with secure API access to biometric sensor. Cryptographic libraries (elliptic curve cryptography preferred).

**Innovation Description:**

The core idea is to dynamically alter a shared secret, not through regular key rotation, but based on *measurable drift* in a user’s biometric signature. Instead of fixed schedules, the system continuously monitors subtle changes in a user’s biometric data. These changes are then used to derive variations of the shared secret.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Handshake:** Establishes a baseline biometric profile and shared secret (using existing methods like Diffie-Hellman or ECC) as described in the patent.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The system constantly monitors the user’s biometric data during ongoing communication sessions.
3.  **Drift Calculation:** A “drift score” is calculated by comparing current biometric readings to the baseline profile. This could involve measuring variance in feature vectors extracted from the biometric data.
4.  **Secret Variation:** The drift score is used as input to a Key Derivation Function (KDF). This KDF takes the original shared secret and the drift score as inputs, generating a temporary variation of the shared secret.
5.  **Session Key Update:**  The temporary secret variation is used to derive a new session key. This session key is used for encrypting/decrypting communications for a short period.
6.  **Adaptive Windowing:** The system dynamically adjusts the window size for drift calculation based on communication patterns.  Higher activity leads to smaller windows, and vice-versa.
7.  **Anomaly Detection:** Significant, abrupt shifts in biometric data (beyond expected drift) trigger security alerts and potential session termination.

**Pseudocode (KDF):**

```
function derive_session_key(shared_secret, drift_score):
  // drift_score is a floating-point number representing biometric drift
  // shared_secret is the original shared secret

  // Combine shared_secret and drift_score
  combined_input = shared_secret + drift_score  // or a more sophisticated concatenation

  // Hash the combined input using a secure hash function (SHA-256 or similar)
  hashed_input = SHA256(combined_input)

  // Derive a session key from the hashed input
  session_key = KDF(hashed_input, "session_key_label") // KDF is a standard Key Derivation Function (e.g., HKDF)

  return session_key
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   Biometric spoofing countermeasures are critical.
*   The KDF must be resistant to known attacks.
*   The system should be designed to handle noisy biometric data.
*   Privacy implications of continuous biometric monitoring must be addressed.
