## Dynamic Burst Allocation via Predictive Modeling

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Burst Allocator (PBA)
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Work request history (timestamps, request size, request type – read/write).
    *   System resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).
    *   Client profiles (historical usage patterns, service level agreements).
    *   Time-of-day/Day-of-week data.
*   **Model:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture.  Trained to predict future work request arrival rates and sizes.  Separate models maintained for different client profiles/workload types.
*   **Burst Bucket Configuration:** Extends the original token bucket concept to a *dynamic* set of buckets.
    *   **Base Bucket:**  Corresponds to the ‘normal mode’ bucket. Refilled based on provisioned throughput.
    *   **Prediction Buckets:**  A configurable number of additional buckets (e.g., 3-5). Each bucket corresponds to a predicted burst window (e.g., 5-second intervals).  Refill rates are *determined by the RNN output* for that specific window.  Bucket size is configurable and can be adjusted based on prediction confidence.
    *   **Priority Buckets:**  A set of buckets assigned to clients based on SLA or subscription. These buckets have higher refill rates and priority during contention.
*   **Admission Control Logic:**
    1.  Receive Work Request.
    2.  Identify Client Profile.
    3.  RNN predicts future work request rate for the immediate window.
    4.  Check Base Bucket. If sufficient tokens, accept request.
    5.  If Base Bucket insufficient, check Prediction Buckets. Prioritize buckets with higher prediction confidence.
    6.  If Prediction Buckets insufficient, check Priority Buckets (based on SLA).
    7.  If all buckets insufficient, reject request (or queue with lower priority).
    8.  Upon request completion, update RNN model with actual work performed to refine future predictions.
*   **Monitoring & Adjustment:**
    *   Real-time monitoring of prediction accuracy.
    *   Automated model retraining based on performance metrics.
    *   Dynamic adjustment of bucket sizes and refill rates based on system load and SLA requirements.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
TrainRNN(historical_data)
CreateBaseBucket(provisioned_throughput)
CreatePredictionBuckets(number_of_buckets, initial_size, initial_refill_rate)
CreatePriorityBuckets(sla_data)

//Work Request Handler
function HandleWorkRequest(request):
  client_profile = GetClientProfile(request)
  prediction = PredictFutureRate(client_profile, current_time)

  if HasTokens(BaseBucket, request_size):
    ConsumeTokens(BaseBucket, request_size)
    ExecuteRequest(request)
    return

  for bucket in PredictionBuckets:
    if HasTokens(bucket, request_size) and bucket.confidence > threshold:
      ConsumeTokens(bucket, request_size)
      ExecuteRequest(request)
      return

  for bucket in PriorityBuckets:
    if HasTokens(bucket, request_size):
      ConsumeTokens(bucket, request_size)
      ExecuteRequest(request)
      return

  RejectRequest(request)

//Background Task: Model Retraining
function RetrainModel(new_data):
  TrainRNN(new_data)
  UpdatePredictionBuckets()
```

**Rationale:** The original patent focuses on static allocation of burst capacity. This design aims to *proactively* allocate burst capacity based on predicted demand, leading to more efficient resource utilization and improved responsiveness. The dynamic bucket configuration allows for fine-grained control over burst allocation, while the RNN model provides adaptive capacity planning. The prioritization mechanism ensures that high-priority clients receive guaranteed burst capacity.
