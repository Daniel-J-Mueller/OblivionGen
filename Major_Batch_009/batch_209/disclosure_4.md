## Dynamic Highlight Reel Generation & Personalized Event Stitching

**Concept:** Leverage tagging data and discontinuous segment presentation not just for ‘catch-up’ but for *proactive* personalized highlight reel creation *during* live events, coupled with event stitching for multi-camera/perspective experiences.

**Specs:**

**1. Real-time Tagging Pipeline:**

*   **Input:** Live video stream, pre-existing tagging service (as in patent), user profile data (preferences, favorite players/teams/moments).
*   **Process:**
    *   AI-driven tagging engine continuously analyzes the video stream, generating tags beyond simple “action”/“non-action”.  Tags include: Player ID, Event Type (goal, tackle, foul, etc.), Emotion (excitement, tension, disappointment), Camera Angle (wide, close-up, replay).
    *   User profile data is used to weight the importance of different tags.  A user who favors a particular player will see more tags related to that player.
    *   A "Moment Score" is calculated for each segment based on tag weights and intensity.
*   **Output:**  A real-time stream of tagged segments with associated Moment Scores.

**2. Personalized Highlight Reel Generator:**

*   **Input:** Tagged segment stream, user profile, configurable highlight length/frequency.
*   **Process:**
    *   Algorithm selects segments with the highest Moment Scores, prioritizing segments that align with user preferences.
    *   Segments are re-ordered/edited (using seamless transition algorithms) to create a coherent, fast-paced highlight reel.
    *   Optionally, segments can be dynamically enhanced with graphics/text (e.g., player name, score update).
*   **Output:**  A continuously updating, personalized highlight reel stream.

**3. Multi-Camera Event Stitching:**

*   **Input:** Multiple live video streams (different camera angles), synchronized timestamps, tagging data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Tagging data is used to identify corresponding events across different camera angles (e.g., a goal scored).
    *   Algorithm dynamically switches between camera angles to provide the "best" view of each event (based on user preferences, event type, or AI-determined "quality").
    *   Seamless transitions between camera angles are employed, potentially incorporating slow-motion replays or augmented reality overlays.
*   **Output:**  A single, dynamically stitched video stream that combines the best perspectives of the live event.

**4.  Hybrid Presentation Layer:**

*   **Input:** Personalized Highlight Reel, Stitched Video Stream, Live Video Stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   A user interface allows the user to seamlessly switch between the Live Video Stream, the Personalized Highlight Reel, and the Stitched Video Stream.
    *   AI can proactively suggest switching based on user engagement patterns and event intensity.  Example: If the user pauses the Live Stream during a slow period, the AI can automatically play a relevant segment from the Personalized Highlight Reel.
*   **Output:** An immersive, customizable viewing experience.

**Pseudocode (Highlight Reel Generation):**

```
function generateHighlightReel(taggedSegments, userProfile, reelLength) {
  sortedSegments = sortSegmentsByMomentScore(taggedSegments, userProfile)
  selectedSegments = []
  currentTime = 0

  for (segment in sortedSegments) {
    if (currentTime + segment.duration <= reelLength) {
      selectedSegments.push(segment)
      currentTime += segment.duration
    }
  }

  return selectedSegments
}

function sortSegmentsByMomentScore(segments, userProfile) {
  for (segment in segments) {
    segment.momentScore = calculateMomentScore(segment, userProfile)
  }
  segments.sort(function(a, b) { return b.momentScore - a.momentScore; });
  return segments;
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Interactive Highlight Creation:** Allow users to create their own personalized highlights in real-time by tagging segments and adding commentary.
*   **Social Sharing:** Enable users to share their personalized highlights with friends and followers.
*   **Integration with AR/VR:** Create immersive AR/VR experiences that allow users to view highlights from different perspectives and interact with the event in new ways.
