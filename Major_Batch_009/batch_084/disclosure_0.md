## Personalized "Style Sync" Across Marketplaces

**Concept:** Extend the universal cart functionality to encompass stylistic preferences, enabling automated cross-marketplace “style syncing” and recommendation. This moves beyond simple item recommendations based on purchase history to proactively assembling cohesive looks or projects across different vendors.

**Specifications:**

**1. Style Profile Creation & Management:**

*   **Input:** Users define style preferences through a multi-faceted system:
    *   **Visual Boards:** Users upload images representing desired styles (e.g., "Modern Farmhouse Living Room," "Bohemian Summer Outfit").
    *   **Keyword Tags:**  Users select from pre-defined style tags (e.g., "Minimalist," "Rustic," "Vintage," "Techwear") and add custom tags.
    *   **Vendor Preferences:** Users can prioritize or exclude specific merchants based on style alignment.
    *   **Color Palettes:**  Users define preferred color schemes.
*   **AI-Powered Style Analysis:** A computer vision and NLP model analyzes uploaded images and keywords to generate a "Style Vector" representing the user's aesthetic. This vector is continuously refined based on user interactions (purchases, saves, dismissals).
*   **Style Vector Storage:**  The Style Vector is stored in a user profile database, accessible to the recommendation engine.

**2. Cross-Marketplace Item Tagging & Metadata Enrichment:**

*   **Vendor API Integration:** Integrate with merchant APIs to access item metadata (descriptions, images, categories).
*   **AI-Powered Style Tagging:** A separate AI model analyzes item images and descriptions to automatically assign style tags (using the same tag vocabulary as the user profiles).  This tagging is performed at scale for all items across all integrated marketplaces.
*   **Metadata Enrichment:** Enhance item metadata with calculated style similarity scores based on the AI-generated style tags.

**3. Style-Based Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Query Input:** When a user adds an item to the universal cart, the engine generates a “Style Context” based on that item's style tags.
*   **Similarity Search:**  The engine performs a similarity search across all tagged items in all marketplaces, prioritizing those with high style similarity to the Style Context *and* the user's Style Vector.
*   **“Complete the Look” Recommendations:**  The engine returns recommendations for complementary items that align with the user’s overall style, even if they come from different vendors.
*   **"Project Assembly" Recommendations:** Based on user keywords and selected items, the system can suggest a *complete* project. (e.g. User adds a specific type of chair to the cart; the system suggests a table, rug, and lamps in a matching style).

**4. Universal Cart Integration & Presentation:**

*   **"Style Sync" View:**  A dedicated section within the universal cart displays recommendations based on the user's Style Vector and current cart contents.
*   **Visual Similarity Display:** Recommendations are presented visually, emphasizing style similarity (e.g., through color-matched thumbnails or mood boards).
*   **"One-Click Add" Functionality:**  Users can easily add recommended items to the cart.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```
function generateRecommendations(userStyleVector, cartContents):
  styleContext = calculateStyleContext(cartContents) // Average style tags of items in cart
  candidateItems = getAllItemsFromAllMarketplaces()
  filteredItems = []

  for item in candidateItems:
    similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(userStyleVector, item.styleTags) + calculateSimilarity(styleContext, item.styleTags)
    if similarityScore > threshold:
      filteredItems.append(item)

  sortedItems = sort(filteredItems, by: similarityScore, descending: true)
  return topN(sortedItems, N: 10) //Return top 10 recommendations
```

**Data Storage:**

*   User Profiles: Style Vector, Purchase History, Saved Items, Vendor Preferences
*   Item Database: Item ID, Style Tags, Images, Descriptions, Vendor ID, Price
*   Similarity Cache: Pre-calculated style similarity scores between items (to improve performance).
