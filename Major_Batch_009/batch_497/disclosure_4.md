## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Spatial Audio Projection

**Concept:** Extend the device arbitration system to dynamically create "acoustic zones" within a space, projecting audio responses *specifically* towards the user identified as the primary speaker, even in multi-user environments. This moves beyond simply selecting *which* device speaks, to *where* the audio is directed.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array (MMA):** Integrated into each speech interface device. Minimum 4 microphones, strategically positioned for beamforming and source localization.
*   **Spatial Audio Transducers:**  High-fidelity speakers with directional capabilities (e.g., phased array, beamforming speaker) in each device.
*   **Proximity/Depth Sensors:**  IR or ToF sensors integrated to create a basic map of the user’s position relative to the device and other objects.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Dedicated processor (DSP/GPU) within each device for real-time audio processing, beamforming, and spatial audio rendering.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Enhanced Device Arbitration:** Existing system augmented to prioritize user identification *and* spatial location.
*   **Acoustic Zoning Engine:**
    *   **Source Localization:** Uses MMA data to accurately determine the location of each speaker in the environment. (Kalman filtering, time difference of arrival algorithms).
    *   **Zone Creation:** Dynamically defines acoustic zones around each detected speaker.  Zone size adapts to speaker movement and background noise.
    *   **Beamforming/Spatial Audio Rendering:**  Directs audio output (response data) towards the identified user’s zone using beamforming techniques or spatial audio rendering algorithms. Algorithms will prioritize clear voice transmission with minimized spillover to other zones.
*   **Environmental Mapping:** Uses proximity/depth sensor data to create a basic 3D map of the room, identifying obstacles and reflective surfaces. This map improves the accuracy of beamforming and minimizes audio reflections.
*   **Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Speaker Diarization:** Enhances accuracy in multi-user scenarios, isolating individual voices and preventing interference.
*   **Automatic Calibration Routine:**  A self-calibration routine that uses test tones and microphone array data to optimize beamforming and spatial audio rendering for the specific environment.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Speech Detection:** Multiple speech interface devices detect a speech utterance.
2.  **Audio & Metadata Reception:** The remote speech processing system receives audio signals and metadata (device state, contextual attributes) from all detecting devices.
3.  **Source Localization:**  The acoustic zoning engine uses the MMA data to localize the speaker(s) in the environment.
4.  **Device Arbitration & Intent Recognition:** The remote speech processing system performs ASR, NLU, and device arbitration as before.
5.  **Zone Assignment:**  Based on arbitration, a specific device is selected to deliver the response. The acoustic zoning engine assigns an acoustic zone to the identified speaker.
6.  **Spatial Audio Rendering:** The selected device renders the response data using spatial audio techniques, directing the sound towards the assigned acoustic zone.
7.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors the speaker’s location and adjusts the acoustic zone and audio projection accordingly.

**Pseudocode - Acoustic Zoning Engine (Simplified):**

```
Function CreateAcousticZone(SpeakerLocation, ZoneSize):
  // Define a spherical or ellipsoidal zone around the speaker's location
  Zone = Sphere(SpeakerLocation, ZoneSize)
  Return Zone

Function RenderSpatialAudio(ResponseData, Zone):
  // Apply beamforming or spatial audio rendering techniques
  // to direct the ResponseData towards the defined Zone
  RenderedAudio = Beamform(ResponseData, Zone) // or SpatialAudioRender(ResponseData, Zone)
  Return RenderedAudio

Function UpdateZone(SpeakerLocation, ZoneSize):
  // Continuously update the speaker location based on microphone data
  NewZone = CreateAcousticZone(SpeakerLocation, ZoneSize)
  Return NewZone
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Multi-user environments:** Enhanced privacy and clarity in shared spaces.
*   **Open-plan offices:**  Directed audio responses for individual users.
*   **Smart homes:** Targeted audio for specific rooms or users.
*   **Accessibility:**  Audio projection for users with hearing impairments.
