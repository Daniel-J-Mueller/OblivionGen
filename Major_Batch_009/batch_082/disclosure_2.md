## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Tiered Communication Access

**Concept:** Extend the communication filtering beyond simple content checks to incorporate a dynamic trust score for each user, influencing *how* and *if* communications are delivered. This shifts from blocking to modulating communication access.

**Specs:**

**1. Trust Score Calculation:**

*   **Initial Score:** All new users begin with a base trust score (e.g., 50/100).
*   **Behavioral Factors:**  The score is dynamically adjusted based on:
    *   **Transaction History:** Successful/failed transactions, disputes, returns. Positive history increases the score, negative decreases.
    *   **Communication Patterns:** Frequency of communications, response times, flagged content (even if not blocked), use of external links (weighted by domain reputation).
    *   **Verification Levels:**  Completed profile information, verified email/phone, linked social media accounts, identity verification (e.g., KYC).  Each adds to the score.
    *   **Reported Behavior:** User reports (with moderation verification) impact the score.
    *   **Time-Based Decay:** Scores gradually decay over time to incentivize continued positive behavior.
*   **Score Range:**  0-100.  Scores below a threshold (e.g., 20) trigger severe restrictions.  Above a threshold (e.g., 90) grant expanded privileges.

**2. Tiered Communication Access:**

*   **Tier 1 (Score 0-20):**  Communication *only* via a highly moderated, templated system. No free-text input. Limited to essential transaction details.  Automatic flagging for review by human moderators.
*   **Tier 2 (Score 21-50):**  Standard free-text communication *with* automated content filtering (as in the provided patent).  Communications are subject to increased scrutiny, and delivery may be delayed for review.
*   **Tier 3 (Score 51-80):**  Standard free-text communication with typical automated filtering.  Normal delivery speed.
*   **Tier 4 (Score 81-100):**  "Trusted Communicator" status. Reduced filtering.  Priority delivery. Access to advanced communication features (e.g., richer media, direct contact options – with user consent).

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **API Endpoint:** `/trust_score/{user_id}` – Returns the current trust score for a given user.
*   **Data Structure:**  User Profile augmented with a `trust_score` field and a `communication_tier` field.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:**  Transaction events, communication events, report events, and verification events trigger updates to the trust score.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:**  Employ a model to predict potentially fraudulent or inappropriate behavior based on user communication patterns and historical data. This prediction feeds into the trust score calculation.
*   **Pseudocode (Trust Score Update):**

```
function updateTrustScore(userID, eventType, eventData):
    userProfile = getUserProfile(userID)
    currentScore = userProfile.trust_score

    if eventType == "successful_transaction":
        scoreAdjustment = 5
    elif eventType == "failed_transaction":
        scoreAdjustment = -3
    elif eventType == "flagged_communication":
        scoreAdjustment = -7
    elif eventType == "verified_email":
        scoreAdjustment = 2
    // ... other event types and adjustments

    newScore = clamp(currentScore + scoreAdjustment, 0, 100)
    userProfile.trust_score = newScore
    userProfile.communication_tier = determineCommunicationTier(newScore)
    saveUserProfile(userProfile)
```

**4.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Communication Tier Override:**  Allow administrators to manually adjust a user's communication tier for exceptional cases.
*   **Temporary Tier Downgrade:**  Automatically downgrade a user’s tier if suspicious activity is detected, even if their overall score is high.
*   **"Request to Escalate" Button:**  Allow Tier 1/2 users to request a review and potential tier upgrade.
