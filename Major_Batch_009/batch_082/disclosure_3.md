## Dynamic Content Reflow Based on User Gaze Tracking

**Concept:** Extend reflow content generation by dynamically adjusting content presentation based on the user’s gaze. Instead of a static reflow, the system prioritizes content the user is *actively looking at*, refining reflow on-the-fly for optimal readability and engagement.

**Specs:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Eye-tracking integration (integrated webcam-based or dedicated eye-tracking hardware). Resolution minimum: 60Hz. Accuracy: <1° visual angle.
*   Processing Unit: Multi-core processor (minimum 4 cores) for real-time gaze data processing and content reflow.
*   Display: Standard display capable of rendering dynamic content (resolution dependent on target application).

**II. Software Components:**

1.  **Gaze Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   Captures gaze data (x, y coordinates) from the eye-tracking hardware.
    *   Filters and smooths raw gaze data to reduce noise.
    *   Calibration routine to map gaze coordinates to screen coordinates.

2.  **Content Analysis Module:**
    *   Analyzes digital image content (text, images, layout).
    *   Identifies content blocks (paragraphs, headings, images).
    *   Assigns priority scores to content blocks based on semantic importance (using NLP techniques).
    *   Generates a content dependency graph to understand relationships between content blocks.

3.  **Dynamic Reflow Engine:**
    *   Receives gaze data and content analysis data.
    *   Calculates a ‘gaze-weighted priority score’ for each content block. This score combines semantic importance with how long/often the user looks at the block.
    *   Dynamically adjusts reflow parameters:
        *   **Font Size:** Increase font size for content blocks with high gaze-weighted priority.
        *   **Line Spacing:** Adjust line spacing to improve readability of prioritized content.
        *   **Content Ordering:** Re-order content blocks to bring prioritized content closer to the user’s current focus.
        *   **Image Resolution:** Dynamically adjust image resolution, prioritizing full resolution for images the user is looking at.
        *   **Content Expansion/Contraction:** Expand detailed explanations for blocks receiving high gaze, and condense less viewed content.
    *   Renders the dynamically reflowed content.
    *   Implements a “cooldown” period to prevent rapid reflow oscillations.

4.  **User Interface:**
    *   Visual feedback indicating which content is currently prioritized. (e.g., subtle highlighting).
    *   Options to adjust sensitivity of gaze tracking and reflow parameters.
    *   Option to disable dynamic reflow.

**III. Pseudocode – Dynamic Reflow Engine:**

```pseudocode
function DynamicReflow(gaze_x, gaze_y, content_blocks, semantic_scores):
  // 1. Calculate proximity scores based on gaze position
  proximity_scores = []
  for block in content_blocks:
    distance = calculate_distance(gaze_x, gaze_y, block.x, block.y)
    proximity_score = 1.0 / (1.0 + distance) // Inverse relationship with distance
    proximity_scores.append(proximity_score)

  // 2. Calculate gaze-weighted priority score
  gaze_weighted_scores = []
  for i in range(len(content_blocks)):
    gaze_weighted_score = semantic_scores[i] * proximity_scores[i]
    gaze_weighted_scores.append(gaze_weighted_score)

  // 3. Sort content blocks based on gaze-weighted score
  sorted_blocks = sort_blocks_by_score(content_blocks, gaze_weighted_scores)

  // 4. Adjust reflow parameters
  reflowed_content = []
  for block in sorted_blocks:
    // Increase font size and line spacing for prioritized blocks
    if block.score > threshold:
      block.font_size = base_font_size * 1.2
      block.line_spacing = base_line_spacing * 1.2
    else:
      block.font_size = base_font_size
      block.line_spacing = base_line_spacing

    reflowed_content.append(block)

  // 5. Render reflowed content
  render(reflowed_content)
```

**IV. Potential Applications:**

*   E-readers and digital textbooks.
*   Long-form article readers.
*   Accessibility tools for users with visual impairments.
*   Interactive presentations.
*   Scientific document viewers.
