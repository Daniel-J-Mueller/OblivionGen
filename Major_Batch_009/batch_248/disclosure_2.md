## Dynamic Proximity-Based Influence Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the transaction path analysis to incorporate real-world proximity as a key influence factor, creating a dynamic influence map that predicts not just *what* a user will do, but *where* and *with whom*. This goes beyond predicting the next purchase; it predicts the user's likely physical location and interactions.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate data from multiple proximity sensors beyond just transaction terminals. Include Bluetooth beacons, Wi-Fi triangulation, and even anonymized mobile device location data (opt-in required).
*   **Social Proximity Weighting:** Develop a weighting algorithm that factors in the proximity of other users. If a user frequently interacts (based on proximity data) with another user near a specific transaction point, that other user’s transaction history becomes a stronger influence factor.
*   **Dynamic Influence Map Generation:**
    *   Create a layered map representing physical spaces (stores, venues, city blocks).
    *   Populate the map with "influence nodes" representing transaction points and proximity sensor locations.
    *   Assign weights to each node based on transaction frequency, proximity sensor activity, and social proximity weighting.
    *   Update the map in real-time based on ongoing sensor data.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   Utilize machine learning models (e.g., Graph Neural Networks) to predict a user's future location and interactions based on their transaction history, current location, and the dynamic influence map.
    *   Model not only *where* a user will go but *who* they are likely to meet.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Trigger personalized promotions based on predicted location and social interactions. Example: "Since you're likely to meet John at Cafe X, here's a discount on two coffees."
    *   Optimize store layouts and product placement based on predicted foot traffic and social clusters.
    *   Create targeted advertising campaigns based on predicted social influence.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Generation):**

```
function predictNextLocation(user, currentTime):
  // Get user's transaction history
  history = getUserTransactionHistory(user)

  // Get user's current location
  currentLocation = getUserCurrentLocation(user)

  // Get the dynamic influence map for the current location
  influenceMap = getDynamicInfluenceMap(currentLocation)

  // Apply graph neural network to predict probability distribution of next locations
  probabilities = gnn.predictNextLocations(history, influenceMap)

  // Calculate a weighted score for each potential location
  scoredLocations = []
  for location, probability in probabilities.items():
    score = probability * influenceMap.getScore(location)
    scoredLocations.append((location, score))

  // Sort locations by score
  scoredLocations.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  // Return the top N predicted locations
  return scoredLocations[0:N]
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Anonymized transaction data (item purchased, time, location).
*   Proximity sensor data (Bluetooth beacon IDs, Wi-Fi signal strength).
*   Anonymized mobile device location data (opt-in only).
*   User profile data (demographics, preferences – with explicit consent).
