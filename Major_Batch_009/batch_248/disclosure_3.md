## Dynamic Contextual Highlighting & Narrative Stitching

**Concept:** Extend frame selection based on object proximity to incorporate *narrative* proximity. Instead of simply highlighting objects within a distance threshold, analyze object interactions and generate 'story beats' within the video.  These beats form the basis of the summary.

**Specs:**

**1. Beat Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Video Frames, Object Annotations (from existing system), Audio Transcript (optional, generated via speech-to-text).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Interaction Analysis:**  Identify object interactions (e.g., person handing object to another person, car approaching pedestrian).  Utilize bounding box overlap, proximity, and potentially skeletal tracking (if available) to determine interaction type.
    *   **Temporal Coherence:**  Track object interactions across multiple frames to establish a temporal sequence.  A 'beat' is defined as a cohesive interaction sequence lasting between 2-10 seconds.
    *   **Narrative Weighting:** Assign a 'narrative weight' to each beat based on:
        *   **Interaction Complexity:** More complex interactions (e.g., multiple objects involved, significant movement) receive higher weight.
        *   **Audio Correlation:**  If audio is available, identify spoken words related to the objects/interaction and increase weight accordingly. Keyword spotting.
        *   **Object Significance:** User-defined prioritization of objects (e.g., "focus on the dog").
*   **Output:** List of beats, each with:
    *   Start/End Frames
    *   Involved Objects
    *   Interaction Type
    *   Narrative Weight

**2. Dynamic Highlighting Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Video Frames, Beat List.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Contextual Expansion:** For each beat:
        *   Identify the primary objects involved.
        *   Calculate a 'context radius' dynamically based on object movement and scene density.
        *   Highlight objects within the context radius, but *only* if they are directly related to the beat's interaction. This is achieved by analyzing object relationships within the scene (e.g. object A is blocking object B, person C is looking at object D).
    *   **Motion-Adaptive Framing:**  Adjust the frame selection and zoom level to keep the highlighted objects within the frame and maintain visual clarity during object movement.
    *   **Selective Blur/Focus:** Apply blur to the background to emphasize the highlighted objects.  Use depth estimation to create a more realistic depth of field effect.
*   **Output:**  Sequence of dynamically highlighted frames.

**3. Narrative Stitching Module:**

*   **Input:**  Sequence of highlighted frames, Beat List.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Beat Prioritization:** Sort beats based on narrative weight.
    *   **Smooth Transition:** Generate smooth transitions between beats by:
        *   Cross-dissolving between keyframes.
        *   Using motion tracking to follow objects between beats.
        *   Adding short, visually engaging transitions (e.g., wipes, zooms)
    *   **Adaptive Summary Length:**  Adjust the summary length based on user preferences or available time.
*   **Output:**  Final video summary.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Stitching):**

```
function generateSummary(beats, desiredLength) {
  sortedBeats = sortBeatsByNarrativeWeight(beats)
  selectedBeats = []
  currentTime = 0

  for (beat in sortedBeats) {
    if (currentTime + beat.duration <= desiredLength) {
      selectedBeats.push(beat)
      currentTime += beat.duration
    } else {
      break
    }
  }

  finalSummary = createVideoFromBeats(selectedBeats)
  return finalSummary
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Driven Scene Understanding:** Integrate a scene understanding model to better interpret object relationships and interactions.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define their own "story beats" or prioritize specific objects.
*   **Emotion Recognition:** Analyze facial expressions and audio to identify emotionally significant moments in the video.
