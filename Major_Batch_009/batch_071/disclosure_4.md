## Dynamic Catalog ‘Mood Boards’

**Concept:** Extend the item selection tracking to visually represent ‘mood boards’ or curated collections based on user selections *and* predictive AI styling. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Selection History:**  Continuously monitor and store user item selections *and* quantities. Timestamp each selection.
*   **Item Attribute Extraction:**  Each catalog item requires associated metadata beyond basic attributes (price, description). Metadata includes:
    *   **Style Keywords:** (e.g., "modern", "rustic", "bohemian", "minimalist", "industrial"). Manually assigned *and* AI-generated via image analysis.
    *   **Color Palette:**  Dominant and accent colors identified via image analysis. Express as RGB or hex codes.
    *   **Material Tags:**  (e.g., "wood", "metal", "fabric", "glass").
    *   **Pattern Tags:** (e.g. floral, striped, geometric)
*   **AI Style Profiling:**  Employ a machine learning model (trained on interior design/fashion databases) to analyze user selection history and generate a "style profile."  This profile is a weighted vector representing the user’s preference for various style keywords, colors, and materials.

**2. Mood Board Generation:**

*   **Automatic Mood Board Creation:** When a user has selected 3+ items, automatically generate a visual “mood board” representing their current selections.  The mood board is a dynamic collage of item images.
*   **AI-Powered Item Suggestions:**  Based on the user’s style profile and current selections, suggest additional items that would complement the mood board.  Display these suggestions *within* the mood board interface.
*   **Mood Board Editing:** Allow users to:
    *   Rearrange items on the mood board.
    *   Add/remove items from the mood board.
    *   Adjust the quantity of items on the mood board.
    *   Save multiple mood boards for different projects/themes.
*   **Dynamic Layout:** Implement an algorithm to dynamically arrange items on the mood board based on color harmony, visual balance, and item size.

**3. User Interface (UI) Integration:**

*   **Dedicated Mood Board Tab:** Create a dedicated tab/section within the user account for managing mood boards.
*   **Inline Mood Board Preview:** Display a small, interactive preview of the current mood board on category/search result pages.
*   **‘Shop the Look’ Feature:** Allow users to ‘shop the look’ directly from a mood board. Clicking on an item on the mood board should redirect the user to the item’s product page with the quantity pre-filled.
*   **Social Sharing:** Enable users to share their mood boards on social media platforms.

**4.  Algorithmic Pseudocode (Mood Board Item Suggestion):**

```
FUNCTION SuggestItems(userStyleProfile, currentSelections, catalog):
  // Calculate similarity score between user style profile and each catalog item
  FOR each item IN catalog:
    itemStyleVector = ExtractStyleVector(item) // Extract style keywords/attributes
    similarityScore = CalculateCosineSimilarity(userStyleProfile, itemStyleVector)
    item.similarityScore = similarityScore

  // Filter out items already in currentSelections
  filteredCatalog = Catalog - currentSelections

  // Sort filteredCatalog by similarityScore (descending)
  sortedCatalog = Sort(filteredCatalog, by similarityScore)

  // Return top N items (e.g., N=10)
  RETURN sortedCatalog[0:N]
END FUNCTION
```

**5.  Scalability:**

*   Utilize a distributed caching system (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to store user style profiles and mood board data.
*   Implement a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to handle asynchronous tasks such as image analysis and style profile updates.
