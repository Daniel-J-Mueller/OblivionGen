## Adaptive OR Stream Partitioning & Dynamic Sharding

**Concept:** The patent describes a system for publishing operation records (ORs) to a durable log.  This design expands on that by introducing *dynamic* sharding of the OR stream *based on operation type and data dependency*, coupled with adaptive partitioning of the data object itself.  Instead of static assignment of OR submitters to partitions, we introduce a ‘flow control graph’ representing data dependencies and operation frequencies.

**Specification:**

**I. Flow Control Graph (FCG) Generation:**

*   **Monitoring Agent:** Continuously monitors incoming operations against the data object.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Identifies dependencies between operations (e.g., an update requires a prior read, a delete invalidates cached reads).
*   **Operation Frequency:** Tracks the frequency of each operation type (create, read, update, delete, etc.).
*   **FCG Construction:** Builds a directed graph where:
    *   Nodes represent operation types.
    *   Edges represent dependencies between operations.
    *   Edge weight represents the frequency of the dependent operation.
*   **Graph Pruning:**  Removes infrequently occurring operation type nodes to manage complexity.  A threshold can be set dynamically based on resource availability.

**II. Adaptive Partitioning & Sharding:**

*   **Partitioning Algorithm:** Employs a graph partitioning algorithm (e.g., METIS, ParMETIS) on the FCG to divide operation types into shards. This minimizes inter-shard communication.
*   **Data Object Mapping:** Maps shards to data object partitions. The partitioning of the data object mirrors the operation type shards. Data locality is prioritized during mapping.
*   **Dynamic Re-Sharding:** Periodically (or triggered by significant workload changes) re-evaluates the FCG and re-shards both operation types and data objects.  A sliding window average of operation frequencies is used to detect significant changes.
*   **Shard Migration:**  Supports seamless shard migration between storage nodes to balance load and optimize for data locality.

**III. OR Submitter Management:**

*   **Virtual OR Submitters:** Introduces the concept of *virtual* OR submitters.  Each virtual OR submitter is associated with a specific shard.
*   **Dynamic Assignment:**  A central 'OR Submitter Manager' dynamically assigns physical OR submitter resources to virtual OR submitters based on workload.
*   **Workload Prediction:** Employs machine learning models to predict workload for each shard, enabling proactive resource allocation.
*   **Flow Control:**  Utilizes a credit-based flow control mechanism between the OR Submitter Manager, virtual OR submitters, and the durable log publisher.

**IV. Pseudocode (OR Submitter Manager):**

```
function allocate_submitter(virtual_submitter):
  // Check if a free submitter is available
  free_submitter = find_free_submitter()

  if free_submitter == null:
    // Scale up - request a new submitter instance
    new_submitter = request_new_submitter()
    free_submitter = new_submitter

  // Assign virtual submitter to physical submitter
  assign(virtual_submitter, free_submitter)

  return free_submitter

function monitor_workload():
  // Collect workload statistics for each shard
  shard_workload = collect_workload_stats()

  // Predict future workload
  predicted_workload = predict_workload(shard_workload)

  // Adjust resource allocation based on prediction
  allocate_resources(predicted_workload)

function allocate_resources(predicted_workload):
  // Scale up/down OR submitter instances
  if predicted_workload > capacity:
    scale_up()
  else if predicted_workload < capacity * 0.5:
    scale_down()
```

**V. Benefits:**

*   **Improved Scalability:** Dynamic sharding allows the system to scale horizontally more efficiently.
*   **Reduced Latency:** Data locality and minimized inter-shard communication reduce latency.
*   **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Dynamic resource allocation ensures efficient use of compute and storage resources.
*   **Increased Resilience:**  Shard migration provides resilience to node failures.
