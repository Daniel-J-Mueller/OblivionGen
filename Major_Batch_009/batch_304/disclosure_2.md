## Adaptive Event Weighting for Predictive System Response

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the influence of historical events on simulated responses, based on real-time system behavior and predictive modeling.

**Core Concept:** The provided patent focuses on replaying historical events to generate responses. This extension introduces a system that *weights* those historical events, prioritizing those most likely to lead to accurate predictions of current system state. It’s not just *what* happened, but *how relevant* it is *now*.

**Components:**

1.  **Real-time System Monitor:** Continuously collects data on the computing system being tested – throughput, latency, error rates, resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O).
2.  **Feature Extraction Module:** Processes raw monitoring data into a set of quantifiable features representing the current system state. Examples: request rate, average response time, error rate, queue depth, CPU load.
3.  **Predictive Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., regression, neural network, decision tree) trained on historical system data and feature sets. This model predicts the expected behavior (e.g., response time, error rate) of the system given the current feature set.
4.  **Event Relevance Engine:** Calculates a “relevance score” for each historical event stored in the simulation history database. This score is determined by:
    *   **Feature Vector Similarity:** Comparing the feature vector associated with the historical event to the current system’s feature vector. Higher similarity = higher score. Cosine similarity or Euclidean distance can be used.
    *   **Prediction Error Correlation:** Analyzing how well the historical event’s outcome correlated with the current prediction. If the current prediction is wildly inaccurate, events that produced similar inaccuracies historically are downweighted.
    *   **Temporal Decay:** A decreasing weight assigned to older events, reflecting the likelihood that past behavior is less relevant.
5.  **Weighted Event Aggregator:** Retrieves historical events from the database and applies the calculated relevance scores as weights. This produces a weighted average of historical responses.
6.  **Response Generator:** Constructs the simulated response based on the weighted average.  This could involve selecting the most likely response, averaging values, or creating a hybrid response.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// System Initialization
train_predictive_model(historical_system_data)

// For each incoming event:
function generate_simulated_response(incoming_event, current_system_state):
  current_features = extract_features(current_system_state)

  // Retrieve relevant historical events
  historical_events = retrieve_events_from_db(unique_test_id)

  // Calculate relevance scores
  for each event in historical_events:
    event_features = extract_features(event.system_state)
    similarity_score = calculate_similarity(current_features, event_features)
    prediction_error_correlation = calculate_correlation(event.prediction_error, current_prediction_error) //if available
    relevance_score = similarity_score * prediction_error_correlation * temporal_decay(event.timestamp)
    event.relevance = relevance_score

  // Calculate weighted average
  weighted_response = calculate_weighted_average(historical_events.responses, historical_events.relevance)

  return weighted_response
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Event:** `[timestamp, system_state, incoming_event, response, relevance]`
*   **System State:** `[request_rate, avg_response_time, error_rate, queue_depth, cpu_load]`

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   The choice of machine learning model for the predictive model is crucial. Experimentation is needed to find the best fit for the specific system being tested.
*   Feature engineering is critical. Careful selection of relevant features can significantly improve the accuracy of the predictive model.
*   The weighting scheme needs to be tuned to balance the influence of recent and historical events.
*   Scalability is important, as the simulation history database can grow large over time. Consider using a distributed database or indexing techniques.
