# D1055081

## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Streaming Device

**Concept:** A content streaming device integrating localized haptic feedback synchronized with on-screen content. This isn’t a generalized rumble, but precise, directional haptic stimulation tailored to the visual experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Device similar in size/shape to the existing design (D1055081), but with a textured surface composed of an array of miniature, individually addressable actuators. Actuator density: 50 actuators per square inch minimum. Material: Flexible polymer with high tensile strength.
*   **Actuator Type:** Piezoelectric actuators embedded within the device’s shell. Each actuator is capable of generating localized pressure/vibration.
*   **Content Analysis Module:** Real-time analysis of streamed content (video, audio, games). Identifies key events/elements triggering haptic feedback. This requires integration with streaming services' APIs or onboard processing.
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** Maps visual/auditory events to specific actuator combinations and intensity levels. Algorithm customizable by user/content provider. Example mappings:
    *   Rain in a film = Light, dispersed vibration across the device’s upper surface.
    *   Car racing =  Vibration corresponding to engine RPM and road texture, localized to the side of the device corresponding to the car's position on screen.
    *   Gunfire = Sharp, localized pulses on the device's front.
*   **Directional Focus:** Implement algorithms to create the *illusion* of directional haptic feedback. By rapidly sequencing activation across neighboring actuators, the device can simulate a feeling originating from a specific location.
*   **User Profiles:** Allow users to create and save custom haptic profiles tailored to their preferences and content types.
*   **Power:** Integration with existing power supply for the streaming device. Actuators require low-voltage operation.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication with the streaming device’s processor.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Algorithm – Simplified Example):**

```
function map_haptic_event(event_type, event_location, intensity) {
  if (event_type == "rain") {
    activate_actuators(top_surface_array, intensity * 0.1, random_pattern);
  } else if (event_type == "impact") {
    activate_actuators(localized_array(event_location), intensity * 0.5, pulse_pattern);
  } else if (event_type == "vehicle_pass") {
    // Calculate actuator positions based on vehicle location on screen
    vehicle_actuators = calculate_actuator_positions(event_location);
    activate_actuators(vehicle_actuators, intensity * 0.2, wave_pattern);
  }
}

function activate_actuators(actuator_array, intensity, pattern) {
  for each actuator in actuator_array {
    actuator.intensity = intensity * pattern[actuator.index];
    actuator.vibrate();
  }
}
```

**Refinement:** Explore use of electrostatic adhesion to create more nuanced tactile sensations, moving beyond simple vibration. Consider integrating biosensors to tailor haptic feedback to the user’s emotional state.
