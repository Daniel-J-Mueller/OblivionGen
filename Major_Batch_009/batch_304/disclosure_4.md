## Dynamic Item 'Ecosystem' Visualization

**Concept:** Extend the item comparison beyond simply *substitute* goods (A vs. B vs. C) and model an entire "ecosystem" of related items, revealing not just direct competition, but also complementary relationships and emergent usage patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Source:** Leverages existing user activity data (views, orders, clickstream) *plus* external data sources: product specifications, user reviews (sentiment analysis), social media trends (item mentions/hashtags), and even publicly available "wish lists" or "saved items" data.
*   **Ecosystem Graph Construction:**
    *   Nodes: Individual catalog items.
    *   Edges: Weighted relationships between items, determined by:
        *   **Competition Weight:**  (Existing patent logic – inverse correlation of views/orders) – Negative weight.
        *   **Complementarity Weight:**  Frequency of co-purchase *within a short time window* (e.g., purchased together in the same session, or within 24 hours). Also, co-viewing with a high purchase conversion rate. Positive weight.
        *   **Association Weight:**  Derived from user reviews.  Sentiment analysis identifies phrases like “often used with,” “pairs well with,” or “essential for.” Positive weight.
        *   **Social Affinity Weight:** Frequency of items appearing together in social media content. Positive weight.
*   **Visualization Engine:**
    *   Interactive graph displayed on item detail pages or dedicated “Ecosystem Explorer” pages.
    *   Nodes dynamically sized/colored based on popularity (views, orders).
    *   Edge thickness/color indicates relationship strength (weight).
    *   Users can:
        *   Zoom/pan/explore the graph.
        *   Filter the graph (e.g., show only complementary items, only items with a weight above a certain threshold).
        *   Click on nodes to view item details.
        *   "Seed" the graph with an item to see its direct and indirect relationships.
*   **Dynamic Update:** Graph dynamically updates based on real-time user activity and external data feeds.
*   **AI-Driven ‘Emergent Use Case’ Detection:** AI monitors the graph for unexpected or novel connections between items. (e.g., a sudden increase in the co-purchase of seemingly unrelated items).  This could be highlighted to product teams or suggested to users (“Users who viewed this item also started buying X”).

**Pseudocode (AI-driven Emergent Use Case Detection):**

```
function detectEmergentUseCases(ecosystemGraph, historicalGraph, timeWindow) {
  // Calculate the difference between the current graph and the historical graph
  differenceGraph = ecosystemGraph - historicalGraph

  // Identify nodes/edges with significant increases in weight or new connections
  significantChanges = findSignificantChanges(differenceGraph, weightThreshold, connectionThreshold)

  // For each significant change:
  for (change in significantChanges) {
    // Analyze the surrounding nodes/edges to understand the context of the change
    context = analyzeContext(change)

    // Generate a human-readable explanation of the emergent use case
    explanation = generateExplanation(context)

    // Flag the emergent use case for review by product teams or user recommendations
    flagEmergentUseCase(explanation)
  }
}

function analyzeContext(change) {
  // Examine the connected nodes/edges and their attributes (category, price, features)
  // Use natural language processing to identify patterns and themes
  // Return a contextual representation of the change
}

function generateExplanation(context) {
  // Use natural language generation to create a human-readable explanation of the emergent use case
  // Example: "Users are now combining Item A with Item B, likely because of Feature X."
}
```

**Expansion**: Expand the model to include 'temporal' ecosystems. How do relationships between items *change* over time (seasonality, trends, etc.)?
