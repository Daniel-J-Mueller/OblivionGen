**Adaptive Granularity Time Series Status Reporting**

**Concept:** Extend the existing status tracking to dynamically adjust the granularity of status reporting based on observed task behavior and user query patterns. This moves beyond simply reporting status *of* a portion of the time series, to proactively shaping *how* that status is reported.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** `Granularity Manager` - A module integrated with the existing time series processing system.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Granularity Profile`: Stores user-defined and system-learned preferences for status granularity. Includes:
        *   `Default Granularity`: Initial reporting resolution (e.g., per-second, per-minute, per-hour).
        *   `Adaptive Rules`: A list of conditions triggering granularity adjustments.  Example: `IF error_rate > 0.1 AND query_frequency < 1/minute THEN increase_granularity_to(per-second)`.
        *   `History`:  A time-series of reported granularity levels.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `MonitorTaskBehavior(task_id)`:  Continuously monitors key task metrics (error rate, processing speed, resource consumption).
    *   `AnalyzeQueryPatterns(task_id)`: Tracks query frequency and requested granularity levels from users.
    *   `AdjustGranularity(task_id, desired_granularity)`: Dynamically updates the reporting granularity for the specified task.
    *   `GenerateStatusReport(task_id, requested_granularity)`:  Generates the status report using the specified granularity level.
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  When a new time series processing task is initiated, a default `Granularity Profile` is assigned.
    2.  The `Granularity Manager` continuously runs `MonitorTaskBehavior` and `AnalyzeQueryPatterns` in the background.
    3.  Based on the observed task behavior and user query patterns, the `Granularity Manager` applies the `Adaptive Rules` to determine if the granularity needs adjustment.
    4.  If adjustment is required, `AdjustGranularity` is called to update the reporting granularity.
    5.  When a user requests the status, `GenerateStatusReport` is called with the dynamically adjusted granularity level.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
task_id = new_task()
granularity_profile = default_granularity_profile()
granularity_profile.task_id = task_id

// Background monitoring loop
while (task_running(task_id)):
    behavior_metrics = MonitorTaskBehavior(task_id)
    query_patterns = AnalyzeQueryPatterns(task_id)

    for rule in granularity_profile.adaptive_rules:
        if rule.condition(behavior_metrics, query_patterns):
            new_granularity = rule.action()
            AdjustGranularity(task_id, new_granularity)
            break  // Apply only the first matching rule

// Status request handling
status_request = receive_status_request()
status_report = GenerateStatusReport(status_request.task_id, get_current_granularity(status_request.task_id))
send_response(status_report)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced network bandwidth and server load by reporting only the necessary level of detail.
*   Improved user experience by providing more relevant and timely status updates.
*   Proactive identification of potential issues based on granularity adjustments (e.g., increased granularity indicates a problem).
*   Allows users to 'tune' status reporting based on their specific needs.
