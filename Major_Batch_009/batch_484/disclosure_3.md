## Autonomous Interior Mapping & Dynamic Resource Allocation System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple access control and task notification to create a fully autonomous interior mapping and dynamic resource allocation system integrated with the intermediary device. This system learns the layout of the home, identifies objects within it, and proactively manages resources (lighting, temperature, consumables) based on worker tasks *and* occupant preferences, all while maintaining a secure and auditable log.

**System Specs:**

*   **Intermediary Device Hardware Additions:**
    *   360° LiDAR sensor (range: 5-10m) – for real-time interior mapping.
    *   RGB-D camera – for object recognition and scene understanding.
    *   Increased processing power (dedicated edge AI accelerator) – for on-device data processing.
    *   Extended wireless communication (UWB/Zigbee) - for granular location tracking within the home.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) Module:** Creates and updates a 3D map of the interior.  Prioritizes rooms based on usage patterns and task assignments.
    *   **Object Recognition Module:** Employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset of household objects (appliances, furniture, consumables).  Identifies object locations and types.  Updates object state (e.g., "refrigerator door open," "plant needs water").
    *   **Resource Management Engine:**  An AI-powered engine that dynamically adjusts home resources based on worker tasks and occupant preferences.
        *   **Task-Based Lighting:**  Adjusts lighting levels and color temperature in specific areas based on the worker's task (e.g., bright white light for repairs, dim warm light for cleaning).
        *   **Zone Heating/Cooling:**  Adjusts temperature in specific zones based on worker location and task duration.
        *   **Consumable Monitoring:**  Tracks consumable levels (cleaning supplies, paper towels, etc.) and proactively notifies the owner when restocking is needed.
    *   **Secure Audit Log:**  Records all worker actions, resource adjustments, and sensor data with timestamp and geolocation.  Accessible to the owner via a secure mobile app.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   The intermediary device establishes a secure, encrypted connection with the owner’s mobile app and the service provider’s server.
    *   Utilizes MQTT or similar lightweight messaging protocol for real-time data exchange.

**Pseudocode (Resource Management Engine):**

```
function manageResources(workerLocation, taskType, taskDuration) {

  //Determine optimal lighting
  if (taskType == "repair") {
    setLighting(workerLocation, "bright", "white")
  } else if (taskType == "cleaning") {
    setLighting(workerLocation, "dim", "warm")
  } else {
    setLighting(workerLocation, "default")
  }

  //Adjust temperature
  if (taskDuration > 30 minutes) {
    setTemperature(workerLocation, "comfortable")
  } else {
    setTemperature(workerLocation, "normal")
  }

  //Monitor consumables
  if (taskType == "cleaning" && consumableLevel("cleaning_spray") < 20%) {
    notifyOwner("Low cleaning spray level")
  }

  //Update map
  updateInteriorMap(workerLocation)
}
```

**Integration with Existing System:** The existing authentication and access control features are maintained. The new system adds a layer of intelligence and automation, enhancing the user experience and creating a more proactive and responsive smart home environment.  The device can even *anticipate* needs. For example, if a plumber is scheduled, the system could automatically locate the water shut-off valve and highlight it on the owner’s mobile app.
