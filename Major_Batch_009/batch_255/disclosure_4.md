## Dynamic Address Space Partitioning with Adaptive Shifting

**Concept:** Extend the shifting hardware concept to enable *dynamic* partitioning of the address space, not just fixed regions. This allows for on-the-fly reconfiguration of memory access permissions and allocation based on runtime needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Adaptive Shift Module (ASM):** Replaces the fixed-size shifting hardware. The ASM incorporates a tree of multiplexers controlled by a “Partition Control Register” (PCR).  The PCR is writable by software/firmware.
    *   **Partition Control Register (PCR):**  A multi-bit register. Each bit (or group of bits) corresponds to a level in the multiplexer tree, determining the shift amount. The higher the PCR value, the more the address space is 'shifted' - effectively moving the start of the region.
    *   **Region Definition Table (RDT):** A small memory region holding the base address and size of several address regions. The number of regions is limited, but dynamically configurable (e.g., 2-16).
    *   **Address Filter:**  Logic that compares the transaction address against the RDT entries and applies the appropriate shift from the ASM before checking against region boundaries.

*   **Operation:**
    1.  Software/firmware writes the desired shift amount (derived from window size/address range) into the PCR.
    2.  The ASM uses the PCR value to configure its multiplexer tree, creating the appropriate shift for the address.
    3.  The Address Filter reads the RDT to get region base address & size.
    4.  The transaction address is shifted by the ASM *before* being compared to region boundaries.
    5.  The shifted address is then combined with the region base address (using XOR or XNOR as in the original patent) to generate the indicator.

*   **Pseudocode (Address Filter):**

```
function isAddressWithinRegion(transactionAddress, regionBaseAddress, regionSize, PCR):
    shiftedAddress = shiftAddress(transactionAddress, PCR)
    combinedAddress = XOR(shiftedAddress, regionBaseAddress)
    if (combinedAddress < regionSize):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

*   **Pseudocode (shiftAddress function):**

```
function shiftAddress(transactionAddress, PCR):
    // Implementation details of multiplexer tree based on PCR value
    // (This will vary depending on the ASM implementation)
    // Example: If PCR = 2, shift left by 2 bits
    shiftedAddress = transactionAddress << PCR // or appropriate multiplexer selection
    return shiftedAddress
```

*   **Innovation:** This moves beyond fixed-region decoding. Allows for real-time adjustment of memory access permissions, enabling secure multi-tenancy, dynamic memory allocation, and flexible memory mapping.  It also provides a hardware-based mechanism for address space randomization, enhancing security.

* **Considerations:**  The complexity of the ASM increases with the desired level of granularity and the number of configurable regions. Memory access latency may increase slightly due to the additional shifting operation.
