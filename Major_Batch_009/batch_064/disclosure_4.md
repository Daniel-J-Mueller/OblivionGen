## Distributed Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Leverage the multi-unit processor system to create a distributed haptic feedback network, enabling localized tactile sensations for applications beyond simple device testing.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-Unit Device: Existing board configuration, capable of hosting and powering multiple mobile device processor units (minimum 8).
    *   Haptic Actuators: Small, low-power piezoelectric or electromagnetic actuators. Each processor unit will connect to 2-4 actuators. (Actuator selection criteria: size, weight, power consumption, and force output).
    *   Proximity Sensors: Short-range (1-5cm) capacitive or infrared proximity sensors, integrated with each actuator array. (Used for detecting user proximity and initiating feedback).
    *   Connectivity: High-speed data communication between the main processor and each mobile processor unit (USB 3.0 or equivalent). Wireless connectivity (Bluetooth 5.0 or Wi-Fi 6) for external input/output.
    *   Power Supply: Shared power supply for the multi-unit device, capable of delivering sufficient current to all processor units and actuators.
*   **Software:**
    *   Core Application (Main Processor): Manages overall system operation, communication with processor units, and application logic.
    *   Processor Unit Firmware: Custom firmware for each processor unit, responsible for:
        *   Actuator Control: Precise control of actuator timing and intensity based on received commands.
        *   Proximity Sensing: Monitoring proximity sensor data and triggering feedback events.
        *   Communication: Receiving commands and sending status updates to the main processor.
    *   API: A software API allowing developers to create applications that utilize the haptic feedback system.
*   **System Operation:**
    1.  The main processor receives user input or application events.
    2.  Based on the input, the main processor determines which processor units and actuators should be activated.
    3.  The main processor sends a command to the appropriate processor unit(s), specifying the desired actuator pattern and intensity.
    4.  The processor unit(s) activate the connected actuators, creating localized tactile sensations.
    5.  Proximity sensors detect user interaction and provide feedback to the system, allowing for dynamic adjustment of the haptic feedback.

**Pseudocode (Main Processor - Sending Haptic Feedback):**

```
function sendHapticFeedback(processorUnitID, actuatorPattern, intensity) {
  // Validate inputs
  if (processorUnitID < 0 || processorUnitID > numProcessorUnits) {
    return "Invalid processor unit ID";
  }

  // Construct command packet
  commandPacket = {
    commandType: "hapticFeedback",
    actuatorPattern: actuatorPattern,
    intensity: intensity
  };

  // Send command to processor unit
  sendCommand(processorUnitID, commandPacket);
}

function sendCommand(processorUnitID, command) {
  // Establish communication channel with processor unit
  // Serialize command data
  // Transmit data over communication channel
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Localized Notifications:** Direct tactile alerts for specific applications or events.
*   **Gaming & VR/AR:** Enhanced immersion through realistic haptic feedback.
*   **Assistive Technology:** Providing tactile cues for visually impaired users.
*   **Medical Simulations:** Simulating the feel of tissues and organs for training purposes.
*   **Interactive Surfaces:** Creating responsive tactile interfaces for public displays or control panels.
