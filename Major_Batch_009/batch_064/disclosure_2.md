## Haptic Gesture Replication System

**System Overview:** A wearable device capable of *recording* complex gestures and *replicating* them on a remote device, creating a form of 'digital touch' or 'remote manipulation'. This builds on the angle/RSSI-based device targeting, but shifts the focus from *commanding* a device to *teaching* a device a motion.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Wearable Unit:**
    *   High-Precision IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit): 9-axis (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) with sampling rate > 200Hz.
    *   Micro-Haptic Actuators: Array of small, precise actuators capable of replicating fine motor movements (e.g., piezoelectric, shape-memory alloy).
    *   Bluetooth 5.2+ LE Radio
    *   Low-Power Processor (ARM Cortex-M7 or equivalent)
    *   Secure Element for Encryption.
    *   Small OLED Display for Status/Feedback.
*   **Remote Receptor Unit:** (integrated into target device or as a separate module)
    *   Haptic Actuator Array: Corresponding to the wearable's actuator array, capable of precise replication.
    *   Bluetooth 5.2+ LE Radio.
    *   Low-Power Processor.

**Software/Firmware:**

1.  **Gesture Capture Mode:**
    *   The wearable enters a “Record” mode.
    *   The IMU captures raw acceleration and angular velocity data.
    *   Data is filtered (Kalman filter or similar) to reduce noise.
    *   A gesture recognition algorithm (based on Dynamic Time Warping or Hidden Markov Models) segment gesture *start* and *end* states.
    *   Captured gesture data is timestamped and compressed.
    *   Data is encrypted and sent to the remote receptor.
2.  **Gesture Playback Mode:**
    *   The remote receptor receives the encrypted gesture data.
    *   The data is decrypted and reconstructed.
    *   The reconstruction uses the sensor data as inputs to control the haptic actuator array.
    *   A feedback loop adjusts the actuator outputs to minimize the difference between the reconstructed gesture and the actual actuator movements, thereby increasing precision.
3.  **Calibration Routine:**
    *   A user-initiated calibration procedure ensures accurate synchronization between the wearable and the remote receptor. This includes determining offsets and scaling factors for the actuator arrays.
4.  **Protocol:**
    *   Secure Bluetooth LE protocol for data transmission.
    *   Data packets include:
        *   Packet Identifier
        *   Timestamp
        *   IMU Data (acceleration, angular velocity)
        *   Actuator Control Signals
        *   Checksum for error detection.

**Pseudocode - Wearable Unit (Capture):**

```pseudocode
// Initialize IMU, Bluetooth, Secure Element
loop:
  if button_pressed("Record"):
    start_capture()
  if capturing:
    imu_data = read_imu()
    filtered_data = filter(imu_data)
    append(filtered_data, capture_buffer)
    if gesture_end_detected(capture_buffer):
        encrypt(capture_buffer)
        send_bluetooth(encrypted_buffer)
        stop_capture()
```

**Pseudocode - Remote Unit (Playback):**

```pseudocode
// Initialize Bluetooth, Haptic Actuators
loop:
  if bluetooth_packet_received():
    decrypt_packet(packet)
    gesture_data = get_gesture_data(packet)
    control_signals = process_gesture_data(gesture_data)
    activate_haptic_actuators(control_signals)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Remote Robotics:** Precise manipulation of robots from a distance.
*   **Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality:**  Replicating tactile sensations in VR/AR environments.
*   **Remote Assistance:**  Guiding someone through a complex task by physically "showing" them the motion.
*   **Medical Training:**  Allowing trainees to practice surgical techniques with realistic haptic feedback.
