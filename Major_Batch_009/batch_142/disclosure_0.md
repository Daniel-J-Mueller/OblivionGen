## Adaptive Key Sharding with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the revocable key concept by not just rotating *to* a new key, but *splitting* the current key into multiple shards, each used for a limited timeframe, then decaying. This adds a layer of forward secrecy *and* reduces the impact of a single key compromise.

**Specs:**

**1. Key Sharding Engine (KSE):**

*   **Input:** Current encryption key (K), Shard Count (N), Shard Lifetime (T - in time units), Decay Rate (D - a percentage), Data Stream.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Generate N random “seed” values (S1…SN). These seeds are *not* secrets themselves.
    2.  For each shard (i=1 to N):
        *   Combine the current key (K) with seed Si:  Shard_Key_i = Hash(K + Si). (SHA-256 or similar)
        *   Apply the Shard_Key_i to encrypt a portion of the data stream.  (Data partitioning method is configurable – block, stream, etc.)
        *   Set shard lifetime counter to T.
    3.  As time progresses:
        *   For each shard: Decrement lifetime counter.
        *   When a shard’s lifetime reaches zero:
            *   Apply Decay Rate (D) to the shard key using a cryptographic decay function:  Decayed_Shard_Key_i = CryptographicDecay(Shard_Key_i, D). This function *irreversibly* weakens the key.
            *   The decayed key is still usable for decryption *of data encrypted under that shard*, but becomes progressively harder to use for *future* encryption or key derivation.
*   **Output:** Stream of encrypted data, set of shard keys (potentially decayed), shard lifetime counters.

**2. Cryptographic Decay Function:**

*   **Input:** Key (K), Decay Rate (D).
*   **Process:** This function must irreversibly weaken the key, making it harder to derive other keys or encrypt new data.  Possible approaches:
    *   **Key Masking:** XOR the key with a random mask derived from the decay rate.  Higher decay rate = more random data XORed in.
    *   **Key Truncation:**  Remove a percentage of the key bits based on the decay rate.
    *   **Key Diffusion:** Apply a diffusion layer to the key, mixing bits in a way that is difficult to reverse.
*   **Output:** Decayed Key.

**3. Decryption Process:**

*   **Input:** Encrypted Data, Shard Keys (current and decayed), Seed Values.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Identify the shard used to encrypt each block of data.
    2.  If the shard key is decayed: Attempt decryption with the decayed key.  If decryption fails, report an error (may indicate key compromise or corruption).
    3.  If the shard key is current: Decrypt with the current key.
*   **Output:** Decrypted Data.

**4. Key Management System Integration:**

*   The KSE integrates with the existing key manager.
*   The key manager is responsible for generating and storing the seed values.
*   The key manager initiates key sharding based on a configurable schedule or event.

**Pseudocode (KSE - Simplified):**

```
function shardKey(currentKey, seed, decayRate):
  shardKey = Hash(currentKey + seed)
  return shardKey

function encryptData(data, currentKey, seedValues, decayRate):
  shardKeys = []
  for seed in seedValues:
    shardKey = shardKey(currentKey, seed, decayRate)
    shardKeys.append(shardKey)
  
  encryptedData = ""
  for i, block in enumerate(data):
    shardKeyIndex = i % len(shardKeys)
    encryptedBlock = Encrypt(block, shardKeys[shardKeyIndex])
    encryptedData += encryptedBlock
  
  return encryptedData

function decryptData(encryptedData, shardKeys, seedValues, decayRate):
    decryptedData = ""
    for i, block in enumerate(encryptedData):
        shardKeyIndex = i % len(shardKeys)
        decryptedBlock = Decrypt(block, shardKeys[shardKeyIndex])
        decryptedData += decryptedBlock
    return decryptedData
```

**Novelty:** This isn't just rotating keys, but proactively *weakening* old keys over time, adding a layer of temporal security. It assumes a compromise *will* happen, and mitigates the damage by making stolen keys less useful the longer they're held.  The decay function is key - it needs to be secure and irreversible.  The shard count and lifetime are configurable to balance security and performance.
