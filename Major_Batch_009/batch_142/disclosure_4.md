## Dynamic Delivery Network Resilience - Predictive Geofence Expansion

**Concept:** The patent details a system for managing delivery partners and detecting potential issues like “Unassigned Delivery Blocks” (UDBs). This inspires a system for proactively *increasing* network resilience by predicting and pre-emptively expanding geofence areas around stations *before* capacity is reached, based on real-time demand and partner availability. This isn't just about detecting defects; it’s about preventing them by building a buffer.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical delivery order volume by time of day, day of week, and geographic area.
    *   Real-time delivery order stream.
    *   Current number of active delivery partners and their locations.
    *   Partner acceptance rates for delivery blocks.
    *   Station capacity limits (physical space for partners).
    *   Partner dwell time distributions (how long partners typically stay at a station).
    *   External event data (weather, concerts, sporting events) that may impact demand.
*   **Core Algorithm - Predictive Geofence Expansion:**
    1.  **Demand Prediction:** Utilize a time series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future delivery order volume for each station over a rolling horizon (e.g., next 30-60 minutes).  Model should incorporate historical data, real-time order stream, and external event data.
    2.  **Partner Availability Prediction:** Based on current partner locations, predicted demand, and partner acceptance rates, estimate the number of partners likely to be available at each station within the prediction horizon. Incorporate dwell time distributions to account for partner turnaround time.
    3.  **Capacity Gap Analysis:** Compare predicted demand with predicted partner availability at each station. Identify stations where demand is likely to exceed capacity.
    4.  **Dynamic Geofence Adjustment:** For stations with predicted capacity gaps:
        *   Calculate the necessary expansion of the geofence area to accommodate the projected overflow of delivery partners.  This calculation should consider the physical layout of the station and available parking/waiting space.
        *   Dynamically adjust the geofence radius around the station. This expanded geofence becomes the "staging area" for incoming partners.
        *   Prioritize expansion in directions that minimize traffic congestion and maximize accessibility.
    5.  **Staging Area Management:**
        *   Communicate the expanded geofence boundaries to delivery partner apps.
        *   Offer incentives (e.g., slightly increased payment) to partners who enter the expanded geofence during off-peak hours to proactively increase capacity.
        *   Implement a queuing system within the expanded geofence to manage partner arrival order.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Geofence API Integration:** Integrate with a geofencing API (e.g., Google Maps Platform, Mapbox) to define and manage geofence boundaries.
    *   **Real-Time Data Pipeline:** Build a real-time data pipeline to ingest and process data from various sources (order management system, partner apps, external data feeds).
    *   **Machine Learning Infrastructure:** Utilize a machine learning platform (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to train and deploy the demand prediction and partner availability models.
    *   **Partner App Integration:** Update the partner app to display the expanded geofence boundaries and communicate queuing information.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
def predict_demand(station_id, time_horizon):
  # Use time series model to predict demand
  demand = time_series_model.predict(station_id, time_horizon)
  return demand

def predict_partner_availability(station_id, time_horizon):
  # Calculate available partners based on location and acceptance rates
  availability = calculate_availability(station_id, time_horizon)
  return availability

def calculate_geofence_expansion(station_id, demand, availability):
  # Determine expansion based on the difference between demand and availability
  expansion_radius = max(0, (demand - availability) * scaling_factor)
  return expansion_radius

def update_geofence(station_id, expansion_radius):
  # Update the geofence boundary in the system
  geofence_api.update_boundary(station_id, expansion_radius)

# Main loop
while True:
  for station_id in station_list:
    demand = predict_demand(station_id, time_horizon)
    availability = predict_partner_availability(station_id, time_horizon)
    expansion_radius = calculate_geofence_expansion(station_id, demand, availability)
    update_geofence(station_id, expansion_radius)
  sleep(interval)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves *beyond* reactive defect detection to proactive capacity management. It anticipates potential issues and prepares for them *before* they occur, increasing network resilience and improving the delivery experience. The dynamic geofence expansion, coupled with incentive programs, allows for a more flexible and efficient allocation of delivery resources.
