## Dynamic Soundtrack Layering & Emotional Resonance Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the cast member information overlay to influence and dynamically layer the video soundtrack based on emotional resonance and cast member performance.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

1.  **Emotional Resonance Analysis:**
    *   Implement real-time audio analysis to detect emotional cues within dialogue and background music (joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc.).  This analysis will assign a “Resonance Score” to each audio segment.
    *   Cross-reference dialogue with script data (if available) to confirm intended emotional context.
2.  **Cast Member Performance Mapping:**
    *   Track cast member presence & emotional ‘intensity’ within a scene.  This could be derived from lip movement analysis (correlated with dialogue emotion), facial expression analysis (if scene data is available), and/or voice tone/volume analysis.
    *   Assign each cast member an “Influence Score” based on their prominence in the scene and emotional delivery.
3.  **Dynamic Soundtrack Layering:**
    *   Create a library of “Emotional Layers” – pre-composed musical phrases or soundscapes designed to amplify specific emotions (e.g., a soaring string section for joy, a low cello drone for sadness).
    *   Based on the combined Resonance Score and Influence Score for a scene/character, dynamically adjust the volume and/or introduce new Emotional Layers into the soundtrack.
    *   A “Blending Algorithm” should prioritize layers that align with both the overall scene emotion *and* the prominent cast member's performance.

**II. User Interface Integration:**

1.  **Cast Member Emotional Profile:** Expand the existing cast member overlay to display a real-time “Emotional Profile” – a visual representation of the cast member's current emotional state (e.g., a color-coded graph, a simple emoji).
2.  **Soundtrack Customization:**  Allow users to influence the layering process:
    *   "Intensity Slider":  Control the overall intensity of emotional layering.
    *   "Focus Character":  Prioritize emotional layering based on a selected character.
    *   "Emotional Filter":  Choose to amplify or suppress specific emotions.
3.  **Soundtrack Breakdown:**  Provide a visual breakdown of the current soundtrack composition, showing which Emotional Layers are active and their relative volume.

**III. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop
While (videoPlaying) {
  sceneData = getCurrentSceneData();
  dialogueAudio = getDialogueAudio();
  backgroundAudio = getBackgroundAudio();

  // Analyze Audio
  resonanceScore = analyzeAudioEmotion(dialogueAudio, backgroundAudio);

  // Determine Cast Member Influence
  castMemberData = getCastMemberDataForScene();
  influenceScores = calculateInfluenceScores(castMemberData);

  // Determine Emotional Layering
  emotionalLayers = selectEmotionalLayers(resonanceScore, influenceScores);
  layeredSoundtrack = blendSoundtrackLayers(emotionalLayers);

  // Output Layered Soundtrack
  outputAudio(layeredSoundtrack);

  // Update UI
  updateCastMemberEmotionalProfiles(castMemberData);
  displaySoundtrackBreakdown(layeredSoundtrack);
}
```

**IV. Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance audio processing unit
*   Real-time video analysis capabilities
*   Sufficient memory to store and process audio/video data
*   Network connectivity to download/stream emotional layer assets.

**V. Expansion:**

*   **Biofeedback Integration:** Incorporate user biometric data (heart rate, skin conductance) to personalize emotional layering.
*   **AI-Generated Layers:** Leverage AI to create new, contextually relevant emotional layers on-the-fly.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Extend functionality to gaming, VR/AR experiences, and live performances.
