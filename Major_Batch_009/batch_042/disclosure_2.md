## Dynamic Contextual Output Layering

**Concept:** Extend the system to not only manage *what* information is displayed but *how* it's presented, layering outputs based on user proximity *and* predicted intent derived from multi-sensor input.  Instead of simple expiration, create a cascading system of information density.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate additional sensor data – beyond those already listed – including:
    *   **Eye-tracking:** Determine user gaze direction to infer points of interest.
    *   **Bio-sensors (heart rate, skin conductance):**  Assess user stress/engagement levels.
    *   **Environmental sensors (temperature, light):**  Consider contextual factors affecting readability/usability.
*   **Output Layer Definition:** Define a hierarchy of output layers:
    *   **Layer 0: Core Information:** Essential, persistent information (e.g., safety warnings, basic identification).  Highest priority; never expires.
    *   **Layer 1: Proximity-Based Detail:** Information relevant to the user's immediate location (as in the base patent). Medium priority. Expires based on proximity and retention data.
    *   **Layer 2: Predictive Intent Detail:**  Information *predicted* to be useful to the user based on sensor fusion (eye-tracking, bio-sensors, movement patterns). Low priority. Very short time-to-live.
    *   **Layer 3: Augmented Reality Overlays:** 3D information layered onto the user’s view (using AR glasses/projection). Tied to specific assets/locations.  Dynamically generated and updated.
*   **Sensor Fusion & Intent Prediction:**
    *   Implement a machine learning model trained on user behavior data to predict information needs.
    *   Model inputs: position, speed, gaze direction, biometric data, environmental conditions, task history.
    *   Model outputs: probability scores for various information categories (e.g., "needs instruction manual," "interested in order history," "requires assistance").
*   **Dynamic Output Routing:**
    *   Based on intent prediction scores, route relevant information to the appropriate output layer.
    *   Adjust information density (text size, image resolution, detail level) based on layer and user engagement.
*   **Expiration/Decay Mechanism:**
    *   Instead of immediate expiration, implement a gradual decay mechanism. As the user moves away or predicted intent changes, information in higher layers fades/simplifies.
    *   Layer 0 information remains static.

**Pseudocode (Output Update Loop):**

```
function updateOutput(userPosition, sensorData) {
  intentScores = predictIntent(userPosition, sensorData)
  
  //Determine current output layer priority
  priority = determinePriority(intentScores)

  //Retrieve information relevant to current priority
  relevantInfo = getRelevantInfo(priority)

  //Adjust information density based on user engagement & priority
  displayInfo = adjustDensity(relevantInfo, sensorData)

  //Update output device with displayInfo
  outputDevice.display(displayInfo)
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution sensors (eye-tracking, bio-sensors)
*   Powerful processing unit for sensor fusion and intent prediction
*   AR-capable display/projection system (optional)
*   Wireless communication for real-time data transfer.
