## Adaptive Timer Granularity Based on Task Priority & Resource Contention

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust timer granularity (resolution) *per task*, not globally, based on a combination of task priority *and* real-time assessment of resource contention. This allows high-priority, latency-sensitive tasks to operate on finer-grained timers while lower-priority tasks use coarser timers, reducing overall system overhead without sacrificing responsiveness where it matters most.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Existing hardware timer (Phase Locked Loop based, as in the source patent)
    *   Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) capable of tracking resource contention metrics (L1/L2 cache misses, TLB misses, memory bus utilization, etc.) *per core*.
    *   Priority assignment mechanism (OS scheduling, QOS flags, etc.) accessible at the virtual timer module level.
*   **Virtual Timer Module Enhancement:**
    *   **Priority Table:** A lookup table mapping task priority levels (e.g., Real-time, High, Normal, Low) to a desired timer resolution (e.g., 1ns, 10ns, 100ns, 1ms).  This is configurable via OS APIs or a dedicated system interface.
    *   **Contention Metric Aggregation:** The PMU data is aggregated (smoothed over a short time window) to provide a real-time “contention score” for each core. This score reflects the degree of resource contention.
    *   **Dynamic Resolution Adjustment:**
        *   The virtual timer module, upon receiving a timer request from a task:
            1.  Determines the task’s priority from the OS or QOS flags.
            2.  Looks up the base timer resolution from the Priority Table.
            3.  Reads the current contention score for the core the task is running on.
            4.  **Adjusts the timer resolution based on the contention score:**
                *   Low contention: Use the base timer resolution.
                *   Moderate contention: Increase the timer resolution (coarser granularity).
                *   High contention: Significantly increase the timer resolution (very coarse granularity).  This prioritizes system stability and reduces overhead for all tasks.
    *   **Granularity Levels:** Support a configurable set of granularity levels (e.g., 1ns, 10ns, 100ns, 1ms, 10ms).  The number of levels is hardware-dependent.
    *   **Timer Masking:** Implement a timer masking feature. This allows lower priority tasks to yield timer slices to higher priority tasks if contention is extremely high.

**Pseudocode (Virtual Timer Module - Timer Request Handling):**

```
function handleTimerRequest(taskID, requestedTime) {
    priority = getTaskPriority(taskID);
    baseResolution = lookupResolution(priority);
    contentionScore = getContentionScore(currentCore);

    adjustedResolution = baseResolution;

    if (contentionScore > moderateThreshold) {
        adjustedResolution = increaseResolution(adjustedResolution);
    }

    if (contentionScore > highThreshold) {
        adjustedResolution = increaseResolution(adjustedResolution);
    }

    // Round requestedTime to the nearest adjustedResolution
    roundedTime = roundToNearest(requestedTime, adjustedResolution);

    // Schedule timer event with roundedTime
    scheduleTimerEvent(roundedTime);

    return;
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The thresholds for contention scores (moderateThreshold, highThreshold) will require calibration based on specific hardware and workload characteristics.
*   Consider a hysteresis mechanism to prevent rapid switching between granularity levels.
*   The `increaseResolution()` function could implement a logarithmic scale to provide a smooth transition between levels.
*   The PMU data collection and aggregation should be performed in a separate thread to minimize impact on timer performance.
