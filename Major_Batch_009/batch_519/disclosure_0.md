## Predictive Agent Trajectory Mapping & Intervention

**Concept:** Expand the motion analysis beyond *identifying* an agent involved in an event to *predicting* their likely trajectory and proactively intervening to optimize material handling. This builds on the existing overhead image analysis but introduces a predictive element and potential robotic interaction.

**Specs:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Core:** Existing overhead camera system + Edge Computing Unit + Central Server.
*   **New Components:**
    *   **Trajectory Prediction Module (TPM):**  Resides on Edge Computing Unit.  Runs a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical agent movement data (captured by overhead cameras).
    *   **Intervention Module (IM):** Resides on Central Server.  Controls robotic intervention (e.g., Autonomous Mobile Robots - AMRs) and communicates with the TPM.
    *   **Dynamic Risk Assessment (DRA):** Software module running on Central Server. Integrates trajectory predictions, object locations, and safety protocols.

**2. Data Flow & Processing:**

1.  Overhead cameras capture agent and object data.
2.  Images are fed to the existing motion analysis pipeline.
3.  **New:** Extracted agent pose/position data, along with historical movement data, is fed to the TPM.
4.  TPM generates a probability distribution of future agent trajectories (e.g., 5 potential paths with associated probabilities).
5.  DRA analyzes predicted trajectories, object locations, and potential collisions/inefficiencies.
6.  Based on DRA output, IM determines appropriate intervention (see section 4).
7.  IM issues commands to AMRs or other robotic systems.

**3. Software – Trajectory Prediction Module (TPM) – Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: Agent Pose History (list of [x, y, time] points), Current Agent Pose
// Output: List of Predicted Trajectories (each trajectory is a list of [x, y, time] points) with associated probabilities

function predictTrajectories(agentHistory, currentPose):
    // 1. Data Preprocessing:
    //    - Normalize agent history and current pose data.
    //    - Resample data to a fixed time interval.

    // 2. LSTM Network:
    //    - Input: Preprocessed agent history and current pose.
    //    - LSTM layers: Multiple layers to capture temporal dependencies.
    //    - Output:  A distribution over future agent poses (represented as mean and variance).

    // 3. Trajectory Generation:
    //    - Sample multiple trajectories from the predicted distribution.
    //    -  Each trajectory represents a possible future path of the agent.

    // 4. Probability Calculation:
    //    -  Calculate the probability of each trajectory based on the predicted distribution.

    // 5.  Return: List of Trajectories and their probabilities
    return trajectoriesWithProbabilities
```

**4. Intervention Strategies (controlled by Intervention Module):**

*   **Proactive Item Pre-Positioning:**  If the TPM predicts an agent will need an item, the IM directs an AMR to pre-position the item along the predicted path.
*   **Dynamic Path Optimization:**  If the predicted trajectory intersects with obstacles or inefficient areas, the IM directs AMRs to temporarily re-route traffic or adjust conveyor belt speeds.
*   **Collision Avoidance:**  If the TPM predicts a collision, the IM immediately directs AMRs to brake or change course.  Emergency stop protocols are integrated.
*   **Real-Time Assistance:**  If the TPM predicts an agent struggling with a heavy load, the IM directs an AMR to provide assistance.
*   **Guided Pathways:** Subtle lighting or projected paths indicating the optimal path, adjusted in real time.

**5. Hardware Requirements (Beyond Existing System):**

*   **High-Performance Edge Computing Unit:** Required for running the LSTM network and processing image data in real-time. GPU acceleration is essential.
*   **Fleet of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs):**  For item pre-positioning, dynamic path optimization, collision avoidance, and real-time assistance.
*   **High-Precision Localization System:** For accurate tracking of AMRs and agents within the facility. (e.g., Ultra-Wideband (UWB) or visual SLAM).
*   **Projectors/Lighting system:** For dynamically guided pathways.
