## Dynamic Acoustic Mapping for Personalized Sound Zones

**Concept:** Leveraging the patent’s focus on location-based audio processing, we can create a system that generates personalized “sound zones” within a room, dynamically adjusting audio output based on individual user positions and preferences, while minimizing sound bleed to other zones.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Sensor Array:** A distributed array of low-latency microphones (at least 8, strategically positioned within the environment) and optionally, small, wide-angle cameras. These are networked via a low-latency protocol (e.g., 60GHz wireless, wired Ethernet).
*   **Processing Unit:** A dedicated edge computing device (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson class) capable of real-time signal processing.
*   **Speaker Network:** A distributed network of directional speakers (beamforming capable) or an array of traditional speakers combined with digital signal processing for localized audio control.
*   **User Tracking:** Each user wears a low-power Bluetooth beacon or has a dedicated wearable sensor with IMU.  Alternatively, utilize camera-based skeletal tracking (optional).

**2. Software/Algorithms:**

*   **Acoustic Mapping:**
    *   The sensor array continuously captures room impulse responses (RIRs) using swept sine waves or other suitable excitation signals.
    *   Acoustic features (reverberation time, sound absorption coefficients) are extracted and used to create a dynamic 3D acoustic map of the room.
    *   Map updates occur in real-time to account for changes in the environment (e.g., moving furniture, people).
*   **User Localization:**
    *   The processing unit triangulates user positions based on received signal strength (RSSI) from Bluetooth beacons or processes skeletal tracking data from cameras.
    *   A Kalman filter is used to smooth user location data and predict future positions.
*   **Personalized Sound Zone Creation:**
    *   For each user, a “sound zone” is defined as a virtual sphere surrounding the user's head.
    *   The processing unit calculates the optimal beamforming weights for the directional speakers (or DSP settings for traditional speakers) to focus audio energy within the user's sound zone.
    *   Audio content is tailored to the user's preferences (e.g., music genre, volume level) and fed into the beamforming/DSP algorithms.
*   **Sound Bleed Mitigation:**
    *   The system utilizes null steering techniques to minimize sound leakage from one sound zone to another.
    *   Adaptive filtering algorithms are employed to suppress unwanted noise and reflections within each sound zone.
* **AI Integration:** Machine learning models will be trained using large datasets of acoustic characteristics to allow for automatic room calibration and sound zone optimization.

**3. Pseudocode for Sound Zone Processing:**

```pseudocode
// For each user:
user_location = get_user_location()
sound_zone_center = user_location
sound_zone_radius = 1.5 meters  // Customizable

// Calculate optimal speaker weights for sound zone:
speaker_weights = calculate_speaker_weights(sound_zone_center, sound_zone_radius, room_acoustic_map)

// Calculate null steering weights to minimize sound bleed:
null_steering_weights = calculate_null_steering_weights(sound_zone_center, other_user_locations)

// Combine weights:
final_speaker_weights = combine_weights(speaker_weights, null_steering_weights)

// Apply weights to audio signal:
processed_audio = apply_weights(audio_signal, final_speaker_weights)

// Output audio to speakers:
output_audio(processed_audio)
```

**4. Potential Applications:**

*   **Open-Plan Offices:** Create private acoustic spaces for each employee.
*   **Home Entertainment:** Allow multiple users to enjoy different audio content simultaneously.
*   **Public Spaces:** Provide personalized audio experiences in museums, libraries, or waiting rooms.
*   **Gaming/VR:** Enhance immersion by creating realistic and localized soundscapes.
