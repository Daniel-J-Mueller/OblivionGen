## Modular Pedestal Scanner with Dynamic Projection Mapping

**Concept:** Transform the pedestal scanner into a dynamic information display using integrated projection mapping. The scanner itself becomes a canvas, displaying data visualizations, interactive prompts, or augmented reality overlays directly onto, and around, the physical device.

**Specs:**

*   **Base Unit:** Maintain a core pedestal scanner footprint compatible with existing models. Internal component layout should accommodate additional hardware without compromising scanning functionality.
*   **Projector System:**
    *   Four miniature, high-lumen laser projectors embedded within the pedestalâ€™s upper housing, angled 45 degrees inward and upward. These projectors will cover a roughly hemispherical projection area above and around the scanner.
    *   Automatic keystone correction and blending capabilities for seamless projection.
    *   Projector resolution: 1920x1080 minimum.
    *   Brightness: 1000 lumens per projector minimum.
    *   Projectors must be fan-cooled to prevent overheating.
*   **Depth Sensor Array:** Integrate a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor array around the scanner's scanning window to detect object proximity and shape within the projection area. This will allow for interactive projection and occlusion handling. (Minimum 4 sensors, evenly spaced).
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated onboard processor (Nvidia Jetson Nano or equivalent) to manage projection mapping, depth data processing, and interactive elements.
*   **Software Interface:** SDK allowing developers to create custom projection content and interactive experiences. Content creation tools should support 3D modeling and animation.
*   **Power Supply:** Increased power capacity to accommodate projectors and processing unit.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Scanner Hardware
Initialize Projectors
Initialize Depth Sensor Array
Initialize Processing Unit
Load Default Projection Map (Calibration Pattern)

// Scanning Loop
While (Scanner is Active) {
  Scan Object
  Process Scan Data

  // Depth Data Acquisition
  DepthData = AcquireDepthData()

  // Projection Mapping
  If (ScanData Valid AND DepthData Valid) {
    ProjectionMap = GenerateProjectionMap(ScanData, DepthData)
    ProjectProjectionMap(ProjectionMap)
  } Else {
    ProjectDefaultProjectionMap() //Show Calibration pattern or error message
  }

  //Interactive Element Handling
  If (User Interaction Detected) {
    ProcessInteraction()
    UpdateProjectionMap()
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Interactive Retail:** Project product information, 3D models, or AR try-on experiences around scanned items.
*   **Museum Exhibits:** Display contextual information about scanned artifacts.
*   **Medical Imaging:** Overlay scan data with anatomical models for visualization.
*   **Security:** Highlight scanned objects of interest.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide audio descriptions or visual cues for visually impaired users.
