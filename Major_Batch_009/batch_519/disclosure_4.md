## Adaptive Interference Cancellation Network for Co-Located Radios

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on *selecting* a channel. This design proposes an active system that *mitigates* interference *after* channel selection, enabling denser co-location of radios. It moves beyond passive selection to proactive interference management.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of miniature directional antennas (MIMO configuration) integrated into a single housing.  Each antenna serves one of the radio controllers (WIFI, ZIGBEE, BLUETOOTH). Minimum array size: 4x4.
    *   High-speed, low-latency analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for each antenna element. Sample rate: > 20 MHz.
    *   Dedicated FPGA or high-performance DSP for real-time signal processing.
    *   Software-defined radio (SDR) transceiver module integrated with the FPGA/DSP.
    *   Microphone array for acoustic interference sensing (optional, for specific environments).
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Interference Profiling:** Continuous monitoring of RF spectrum to identify dominant interference sources across all radio bands.  Uses FFT and spectrogram analysis.  Builds a dynamic interference map.
    *   **Beamforming & Null Steering:**  Dynamically adjusts the antenna array’s beamforming weights to:
        *   Maximize signal strength to the intended receiver.
        *   Create nulls (signal cancellation) in the direction of identified interference sources.  Algorithm: Least Mean Squares (LMS) or Recursive Least Squares (RLS).
        *   Prioritize beams based on data priority (e.g., real-time data streams get higher priority).
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:**  Implements adaptive filters (e.g., Kalman filters) to predict and cancel residual interference. 
    *   **Cross-Protocol Interference Mitigation:**  Algorithm that analyzes interference patterns *across* different radio protocols (WIFI, ZIGBEE, BLUETOOTH).  For instance, a strong WIFI transmission might be interfering with a ZIGBEE channel.  The system will attempt to mitigate this cross-protocol interference through beamforming and adaptive filtering.
    *   **Machine Learning Integration:**  Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize beamforming weights and adaptive filter parameters based on real-time performance metrics (e.g., throughput, packet error rate).
    *   **Acoustic Interference Cancellation (Optional):**  If microphone array is present, uses acoustic beamforming to cancel noise from the environment, further improving signal quality in noisy settings.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  System continuously profiles the RF spectrum and identifies interference sources.
    2.  Based on interference map and data priorities, the system dynamically adjusts beamforming weights to maximize signal strength and create nulls in the direction of interference.
    3.  Adaptive filters further refine the signal by canceling residual interference.
    4.  The machine learning algorithm continuously optimizes the system’s performance based on real-time metrics.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Adjustment):**

```
// Input: Interference Map (interference_map), Data Priority (data_priority)
// Output: Beamforming Weights (beamforming_weights)

function adjust_beamforming(interference_map, data_priority):
  // Calculate desired signal direction (based on receiver location)
  desired_direction = calculate_desired_direction()

  // Calculate interference direction and strength
  interference_direction = get_interference_direction(interference_map)
  interference_strength = get_interference_strength(interference_map)

  // Calculate beamforming weights
  beamforming_weights = calculate_weights(desired_direction, interference_direction, interference_strength, data_priority)

  // Apply weights to antenna array
  apply_weights(beamforming_weights)

  return beamforming_weights
```

**Novelty:** This system isn’t just about *avoiding* interference through channel selection. It actively *cancels* it after selection, allowing for a higher density of radio devices and improved performance in challenging RF environments. The cross-protocol interference mitigation and machine learning integration further enhance its capabilities.
