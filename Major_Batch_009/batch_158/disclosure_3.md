## Personalized Auditory "Time Capsules" & Emotional Tagging

**Concept:** Expand the interaction beyond simple feedback on speech-to-text accuracy. Create a system where users can not only review past utterances but *re-experience* the emotional context surrounding them, and build a personalized "auditory time capsule."

**Specs:**

*   **Data Capture:**
    *   Beyond speech, passively capture ambient audio during utterance (environmental sounds, background conversations - with user consent, of course).
    *   Utilize device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) to capture physical context (e.g., user was walking, stationary, driving).
    *   Integrate with calendar/location data to add contextual metadata (e.g., "meeting with John," "at home," "commuting").
    *   Implement an emotion detection module (via audio analysis & potentially text analysis) that suggests emotional tags (happy, sad, frustrated, excited, neutral). *User override is critical.*
*   **"Time Capsule" Interface:**
    *   Chronological timeline view of utterances.
    *   Each utterance entry displays:
        *   Speech-to-text transcript.
        *   Ambient audio snippet (user-selectable length).
        *   Sensor data visualization (simple graph of movement).
        *   Location/calendar metadata.
        *   User-assigned/AI-suggested emotional tag(s).
    *   Playback mode: Reconstructs the experience by playing ambient audio *alongside* the synthesized or original speech.
*   **User Interaction:**
    *   Manual emotional tagging/editing.
    *   “Memory Association” feature: Allow users to attach photos, notes, or other media to specific utterances.
    *   "Emotional Filtering": Filter the timeline by emotional tag. E.g., “Show me all utterances where I was feeling frustrated.”
*   **Backend/Processing:**
    *   Secure storage of audio, sensor data, and metadata.
    *   Cloud-based emotion analysis (optional).
    *   AI-powered suggestion engine for emotional tags.
    *   Privacy controls: Users must have full control over data retention and access.

**Pseudocode (Timeline Generation):**

```
function generateTimeline(userID):
  utterances = fetchUtterances(userID) //Fetch from database
  timelineEntries = []

  for utterance in utterances:
    entry = {}
    entry.transcript = utterance.text
    entry.ambientAudio = utterance.audioURL
    entry.sensorData = utterance.sensorData
    entry.timestamp = utterance.timestamp
    entry.location = utterance.locationData
    entry.emotionalTag = utterance.emotionalTag

    timelineEntries.append(entry)

  timelineEntries.sort(by: timestamp) //Chronological order
  return timelineEntries
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Therapeutic Applications:** Assist with memory recall, emotional processing, or journaling.
*   **Personalized AI Assistant:**  AI learns user’s emotional patterns and adapts responses accordingly.
*   **Enhanced Voice Biometrics:** Improve accuracy by incorporating emotional state as a factor.
