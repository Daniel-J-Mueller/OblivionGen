## Subterranean Acoustic Mapping & Retrieval System

**Concept:** Expand the depth control system to facilitate detailed underwater mapping and automated retrieval of multiple items, not just single on-demand requests, utilizing a network of acoustic beacons and a central control system.

**System Components:**

*   **Enhanced Depth Control Device (EDCD):** The existing device is modified with:
    *   **Miniature Hydrophone Array:**  3-5 hydrophones integrated into the frame for improved acoustic localization.
    *   **Short-Range Acoustic Transceiver:**  For communication with the central control system and other EDCDs.
    *   **Low-Power Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  To track EDCD orientation and movement.
    *   **Increased Battery Capacity:** For prolonged operation.

*   **Acoustic Beacon Network (ABN):**  A series of stationary acoustic beacons deployed throughout the storage area. Each beacon broadcasts a unique identification signal. These can be anchored to the seabed or suspended from a floating structure.

*   **Central Control System (CCS):**  A shore-based or ship-based system comprising:
    *   **Acoustic Receiver Array:**  To receive signals from both the ABN and EDCDs.
    *   **Signal Processing Unit:**  For trilateration, localization, and signal decoding.
    *   **Mapping Software:**  To create 3D maps of the storage area and item locations.
    *   **Automated Retrieval Scheduler:**  To optimize retrieval routes and minimize congestion.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Deployment & Mapping:** The ABN is deployed, and the CCS performs a calibration sequence to map beacon locations. As items equipped with EDCDs are deposited, their initial positions are logged by the CCS.
2.  **Dynamic Mapping:** EDCDs continuously transmit beacon reception data and IMU readings to the CCS. This data is used to refine the 3D map, accounting for currents, settling, and item movement.
3.  **Automated Retrieval Scheduling:** The CCS receives retrieval requests and calculates the optimal retrieval routes based on item locations, current conditions, and potential obstacles.
4.  **Targeted Acoustic Signaling:** The CCS transmits a unique acoustic signal to the target EDCD. This signal contains instructions to rise to the surface and identify its location.
5.  **Precise Localization:** As the EDCD rises, its acoustic signals are tracked by the CCS, providing a precise location for retrieval.
6.  **Multi-Item Coordination:** The CCS can coordinate the retrieval of multiple items simultaneously, optimizing the workflow and minimizing retrieval time.

**Pseudocode (CCS Retrieval Scheduler):**

```
FUNCTION ScheduleRetrieval(requestList, mapData, currentData):
    // requestList: List of item IDs to retrieve
    // mapData: 3D map of item locations and obstacles
    // currentData: Real-time current data

    priorityQueue = CreatePriorityQueue()
    FOR itemID IN requestList:
        itemLocation = GetItemLocation(itemID, mapData)
        travelDistance = CalculateTravelDistance(currentLocation, itemLocation, currentData)
        priority = travelDistance // Or other cost function (e.g., urgency, fragility)
        priorityQueue.Add(itemID, priority)

    retrievalPlan = []
    WHILE priorityQueue.NotEmpty():
        itemID = priorityQueue.Pop()
        itemLocation = GetItemLocation(itemID, mapData)
        route = PlanRoute(currentLocation, itemLocation, mapData)
        retrievalPlan.Add(route)
        currentLocation = itemLocation // Update current location for the next route

    RETURN retrievalPlan
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simple on-demand retrieval to create a dynamic, automated underwater storage and retrieval system. The acoustic mapping capabilities and automated scheduling algorithms enable efficient management of a large number of items in a complex underwater environment. This could be used for underwater warehousing, marine salvage operations, or long-term storage of sensitive materials.
