## Dynamic Sentiment-Triggered Proactive Support

**Concept:** Extend the embedded feedback link system to *proactively* offer support based on real-time sentiment analysis of customer communication *before* a formal feedback link is even clicked.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sentiment Analysis Module:** Integrate a natural language processing (NLP) engine capable of real-time sentiment analysis of incoming customer communications (email text, chat transcripts, voice-to-text).  Sentiment scored on a scale of -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).

2.  **Threshold Configuration:** Allow administrators to configure sentiment thresholds for triggering proactive support.  Example:  If sentiment falls below 0.2 for 3 consecutive messages, trigger a proactive support action.  Thresholds are configurable per customer segment or product line.

3.  **Proactive Support Action Library:**  Define a library of proactive support actions.  Examples:
    *   **Knowledge Base Article Suggestion:**  Automatically insert a relevant knowledge base article into the ongoing communication.
    *   **Offer to Connect with Live Agent:** Offer immediate connection to a live agent with pre-populated context from the communication.
    *   **"Check-In" Message:** Send a personalized message like, "We noticed you seemed frustrated. Is there anything we can help with?"
    *   **Automated Troubleshooting Guide:**  Initiate an automated, interactive troubleshooting guide.

4.  **Dynamic Link Insertion:** When a negative sentiment is detected, dynamically insert a new, context-sensitive feedback link *in addition to* the existing links. This link could lead to:
    *   **Real-time Chat Session:** Direct connection to a support agent.
    *   **Dedicated "Help Me Now" Form:** A simplified form to quickly capture the issue.
    *   **Escalated Priority Queue:** Automatically flags the issue for immediate attention.

5.  **Contextual Data Passing:**  When a proactive action is taken (e.g., opening a chat session), pass relevant contextual data to the support agent, including:
    *   Full communication history.
    *   Sentiment score over time.
    *   Detected keywords related to the issue.
    *   Customer profile information.

6.  **A/B Testing Framework:**  Implement an A/B testing framework to evaluate the effectiveness of different proactive support actions and threshold configurations. Metrics to track:
    *   Customer satisfaction (CSAT).
    *   First contact resolution rate.
    *   Average handle time.
    *   Escalation rate.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyze_communication(communication_text):
  sentiment_score = NLP_Engine.analyze_sentiment(communication_text)
  return sentiment_score

function trigger_proactive_support(customer, communication):
  sentiment_score = analyze_communication(communication)
  if sentiment_score < PROACTIVE_SUPPORT_THRESHOLD:
    proactive_action = SELECT_BEST_ACTION(customer, sentiment_score)
    EXECUTE_ACTION(customer, proactive_action)

function SELECT_BEST_ACTION(customer, sentiment_score):
  # Logic to select the most appropriate proactive action based on customer segment,
  # issue type (detected keywords), and sentiment score.
  # Example:  If customer is a high-value subscriber and sentiment is very negative,
  # offer a live chat session.
  return ACTION

function EXECUTE_ACTION(customer, ACTION):
  # Executes the selected action (e.g., open chat session, show knowledge base article).
