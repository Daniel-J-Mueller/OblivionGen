## Adaptive Query Decomposition with Dynamic Schema Generation

**Concept:** Extend the map-based query translation to incorporate runtime query decomposition based on database statistics *and* dynamic schema generation tailored to the specific database service's capabilities.  Instead of a single, monolithic map representing the entire query, the system splits the query into sub-queries optimized for parallel execution and translates each sub-query with a dynamically generated schema.

**Specs:**

1.  **Query Decomposition Engine:**
    *   Input: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the original query.
    *   Process:
        *   Analyze AST for potential decomposition points (e.g., joins, filters, aggregations).
        *   Consult database statistics (available via API) regarding data distribution, index availability, and estimated query costs.
        *   Employ a cost-based optimization algorithm to determine the optimal decomposition strategy (e.g., splitting a complex join into multiple smaller joins, applying filters early).
        *   Output: A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing the decomposed query, where nodes are sub-queries and edges indicate data dependencies.

2.  **Dynamic Schema Generator:**
    *   Input: Sub-query (from the DAG) and Database Service Profile.
    *   Database Service Profile: A metadata store describing the target database's data types, supported operators, and query language nuances.  This would be populated via discovery or manual configuration.
    *   Process:
        *   Analyze the sub-query's requirements (data types, operations, expected result set).
        *   Consult the Database Service Profile to identify the most efficient data representation and query operators.
        *   Generate a schema (map structure) that leverages the database's native capabilities. This may involve:
            *   Type mapping (e.g., translating a generic 'date' type to the database's specific date/timestamp format).
            *   Operator translation (e.g., replacing a complex string manipulation function with a sequence of database-supported string functions).
            *   Data restructuring (e.g., transforming a nested structure into a flattened table for improved performance).
        *   Output:  A schema (map structure) tailored to the sub-query and the target database.

3.  **Parallel Execution Engine:**
    *   Input: DAG of sub-queries, corresponding schemas.
    *   Process:
        *   Submit each sub-query (with its schema) to the database service for execution.
        *   Monitor the status of each sub-query.
        *   Collect results from completed sub-queries.
        *   Orchestrate the assembly of final results based on data dependencies (defined in the DAG).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Schema Generation):**

```pseudocode
function generateSchema(subQuery, databaseProfile):
  schema = {}
  for each node in subQuery:
    dataType = node.dataType
    operation = node.operation
    
    # Type mapping
    mappedType = databaseProfile.mapType(dataType)
    
    # Operator translation
    translatedOperation = databaseProfile.translateOperation(operation)
    
    # Data restructuring (example: flattening nested structure)
    if nested:
      flattenedData = flatten(node.data)
      
    # Add to schema
    schema[node.name] = {
      "type": mappedType,
      "operation": translatedOperation,
      "data": node.data or flattenedData
    }
  return schema
```

**Innovation:** This approach moves beyond a static mapping between the AST and the interchange format.  It introduces runtime adaptation based on database characteristics, enabling optimizations that wouldn't be possible with a fixed translation.  The dynamic schema generation allows the system to express queries in a way that is *native* to the target database, potentially bypassing limitations of the interchange format and improving performance.  It allows for much more nuanced optimization, and should lend itself to a broader array of targets than a single translation strategy.
