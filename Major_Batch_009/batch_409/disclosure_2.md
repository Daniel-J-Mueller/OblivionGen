## Dynamic Contextual Arc Weighting via Multi-Modal Fusion

**Concept:** Extend the FST-based language model by dynamically adjusting arc weights not solely on N-gram similarity vectors, but by fusing those vectors with real-time, contextual data derived from multiple modalities (visual, sensor, etc.). This enables the system to better handle ambiguous audio and adapt to the user's immediate environment.

**Specifications:**

**I. Multi-Modal Input Layer:**

*   **Visual Input:** Integrate a camera input. Employ a pre-trained object detection/scene understanding model (e.g., YOLO, ResNet) to identify objects and the overall scene. Output a vector representing the scene context (e.g., "office", "car", "restaurant").
*   **Sensor Input:** Incorporate data from available sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone - beyond the primary speech signal, GPS). Process sensor data to determine user activity (e.g., "walking", "driving", "stationary") and location. Output a vector representing the activity/location context.
*   **Audio Features:** Beyond the standard acoustic features for speech recognition, extract features related to ambient sound (noise level, type of noise – traffic, music, etc.). Output a vector representing the ambient sound context.

**II. Context Fusion Module:**

*   **Concatenation & Transformation:** Concatenate the vectors from the Visual, Sensor, and Audio features into a single context vector.
*   **Attention Mechanism:** Apply an attention mechanism to weight the different modalities based on their relevance to the current audio segment. This prevents irrelevant modalities from dominating the context vector. The attention weights are learned during training.
*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduce the dimensionality of the fused context vector using a fully connected layer or autoencoder to create a manageable context representation.

**III. Dynamic Arc Weight Adjustment:**

*   **Contextual Similarity Score:** Calculate a contextual similarity score between the fused context vector and a set of pre-computed context vectors associated with each arc in the FST.  Use cosine similarity or another appropriate metric.
*   **Weight Modification Function:**  Develop a function that dynamically modifies the arc weight based on both the original N-gram similarity score *and* the contextual similarity score. Example: `New Arc Weight = Original Arc Weight * (1 + α * Contextual Similarity Score)`. ‘α’ is a learnable parameter.
*   **Arc Prioritization:** During FST traversal, prioritize arcs with higher modified weights. This will bias the search towards more contextually relevant paths.

**IV. Training & Data Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Modal Dataset:** Create a large, multi-modal dataset consisting of audio recordings, corresponding visual scenes, and sensor data. Label the dataset with accurate transcriptions.
*   **End-to-End Training:** Train the entire system (Multi-Modal Input Layer, Context Fusion Module, Dynamic Arc Weight Adjustment) end-to-end using a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) or attention-based sequence-to-sequence framework.
*   **Regularization:** Employ regularization techniques (dropout, weight decay) to prevent overfitting.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function CalculateArcWeight(arc, originalWeight, contextVector, arcContextVector):
  contextSimilarity = cosineSimilarity(contextVector, arcContextVector)
  newWeight = originalWeight * (1 + alpha * contextSimilarity)
  return newWeight

//During FST traversal:
For each arc:
  newWeight = CalculateArcWeight(arc, originalWeight, currentContextVector, arc.contextVector)
  arc.weight = newWeight
  //Prioritize arcs with higher weights during beam search
```

**Notes:**

*   Pre-trained models for visual and audio analysis can be utilized to accelerate development and improve performance.
*   The complexity of the Context Fusion Module can be adjusted based on available computational resources.
*   The `alpha` parameter controls the influence of the contextual similarity score on the arc weight.  Careful tuning is required to achieve optimal performance.
