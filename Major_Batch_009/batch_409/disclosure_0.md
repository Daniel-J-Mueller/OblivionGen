## Dynamic Data Masking via Policy-Driven Feature Extraction

**System Overview:**

This system extends the concept of request-based policies to implement dynamic data masking *before* data is returned to the client. Instead of simply swapping or altering the *entire* data object, the system focuses on selectively masking individual *features* within the data object based on the requesting client's identity, permissions, and the specific context of the request.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Feature Definition Library:**  A centralized repository defining all possible features within various data object types.  Features are defined with metadata â€“ data type, sensitivity level, display format (e.g., masked, redacted, aggregated), and associated access control rules.  This library is extensible and allows administrators to add/modify features without code changes.

2.  **Policy Engine (Extended):** The existing policy engine is extended to support *feature-level* masking rules. Policies now specify:
    *   Data Object Type
    *   Client Identity/Group
    *   Request Context (e.g., API endpoint, time of day)
    *   Feature Masking Rules:  A list of features and the desired masking action (e.g., redact, hash, encrypt, aggregate, substitute with placeholder).

3.  **Data Object Decomposition & Reconstruction Module:** This module is responsible for:
    *   Decomposing the requested data object into its constituent features.
    *   Applying the masking rules specified by the policy engine to each feature.
    *   Reconstructing the modified data object before returning it to the client.

**Workflow:**

1.  Client requests a data object.
2.  The Data Storage System intercepts the request.
3.  The Policy Engine evaluates the request against the defined policies.
4.  The Data Object Decomposition & Reconstruction Module decomposes the data object.
5.  For each feature, the Policy Engine determines if a masking rule applies.
6.  If a rule applies, the corresponding masking action is executed.
7.  The modified features are reconstructed into a new data object.
8.  The modified data object is returned to the client.

**Pseudocode (Policy Evaluation & Masking):**

```
function handle_request(request):
  policy = find_matching_policy(request)
  if policy != null:
    data_object = request.data_object
    features = decompose_data_object(data_object)
    for feature in features:
      masking_rule = policy.get_masking_rule(feature.name)
      if masking_rule != null:
        masked_feature = apply_masking_rule(feature, masking_rule)
        feature.data = masked_feature.data
    reconstructed_object = reconstruct_data_object(features)
    return reconstructed_object
  else:
    return request.data_object
```

**Example Policy:**

```json
{
  "data_object_type": "CustomerRecord",
  "client_group": "Marketing",
  "masking_rules": [
    {
      "feature_name": "CreditCardNumber",
      "action": "Redact"
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "SSN",
      "action": "Hash"
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "Address",
      "action": "Aggregate" //Replace with city/state level data.
    }
  ]
}
```

**Scalability & Considerations:**

*   **Caching:**  Cache frequently accessed data objects with applied masking rules to reduce processing overhead.
*   **Asynchronous Masking:** For complex masking operations, perform them asynchronously to avoid blocking the request.
*   **Feature Discovery:** Implement mechanisms for automatic feature discovery and registration in the Feature Definition Library.
*   **Audit Logging:**  Log all masking operations for auditing and compliance purposes.
*   **Granular Access Control:** The system allows extremely fine-grained access control over specific data features.
