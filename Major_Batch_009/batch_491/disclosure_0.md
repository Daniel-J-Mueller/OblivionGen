## Autonomous Condition-Based Robotic Maintenance Scheduling

**Concept:** Expand the robotic image capture and condition assessment to *proactively* schedule maintenance based on predicted component failure rates, integrating with external service provider APIs.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Integration:** Integrate with public and private databases containing component failure rate data (e.g., vehicle manufacturer recall data, known component lifespans, user-reported issues).
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Implement a machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network or time series forecasting model) to predict component failure based on:
    *   Condition metric derived from image comparison (patent’s core).
    *   Historical failure data for that component type.
    *   User's driving/usage patterns (derived from browsing/purchase history – e.g., frequent off-road driving, high mileage).
    *   Environmental factors (derived from geolocation data – e.g., extreme temperatures, corrosive environments).
*   **Robotic Inspection Routine Augmentation:** Modify the robotic inspection routine to specifically focus on components identified as high-risk by the predictive model. This includes:
    *   Increased image capture resolution for critical areas.
    *   Implementation of specialized sensors (e.g., thermal imaging, ultrasonic sensors) to detect hidden defects.
    *   Automated creation of inspection 'playlists' based on the predictive model output.
*   **Service Provider API Integration:** Develop APIs to communicate with third-party service providers (e.g., auto repair shops, parts suppliers). This allows for:
    *   Automated scheduling of maintenance appointments.
    *   Pre-ordering of necessary parts.
    *   Remote diagnostics and repair guidance.
*   **User Interface Enhancements:** Expand the user interface to:
    *   Display predicted component failure times.
    *   Provide cost estimates for upcoming maintenance.
    *   Allow users to easily schedule appointments and order parts.
    *   Offer alternative repair options (e.g., DIY repair guides, mobile mechanic services).
