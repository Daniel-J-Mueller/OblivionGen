## Adaptive Modular Electronic Device Adapter - "Chameleon"

**Concept:** A device adapter that physically reconfigures its connector interface based on detected device requirements *and* user-defined profiles. This moves beyond simple passive connection to active, intelligent adaptation.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Rectangular prism, 60mm x 40mm x 15mm. Constructed from a high-strength, lightweight polymer (Carbon-fiber reinforced PEEK preferred). Contains the central processing unit (low-power ARM Cortex-M7), power management circuitry, and internal connection matrix.
*   **Morphing Connector Array:** Six faces of the core module, each containing a 9x9 array of micro-actuated pins. Each pin can independently extend/retract and rotate. Material: Shape-memory alloy (Nickel-Titanium) for rapid, reliable actuation. Pin pitch: 2.5mm. Total number of pins: 81 per face.
*   **Detection System:** Each face includes capacitive touch sensors to detect the presence of a device and preliminary connector type. Infrared proximity sensors confirm device alignment.
*   **Actuation System:** Piezoelectric micro-actuators control individual pin movement. Software-controlled algorithms drive precise pin configurations.
*   **Power Delivery:** Supports USB-PD (Power Delivery) up to 240W, with dynamic voltage/current adjustment based on connected device.
*   **Data Transfer:** Supports USB 3.2, DisplayPort 1.4, and Thunderbolt 3/4 protocols.
*   **User Interface:** Bluetooth connectivity to a mobile app for profile creation and management.
*   **Profiles:** Users can define custom connector profiles for specific devices. The app learns and suggests optimal configurations.
*   **Self-Calibration:** Internal sensors and algorithms calibrate the pin array to ensure accuracy.
*   **Material:** Outer shell utilizes a dynamically color-changing polymer â€“ user-definable color via app.

**Pseudocode (Connector Configuration):**

```
FUNCTION ConfigureConnector(device_type, user_profile)
    // 1. Device Type Detection
    IF device_type == "Unknown" THEN
        // Scan connector face for pin contact and capacitance changes
        detected_connector = DetectConnectorType()
    ELSE
        detected_connector = device_type
    ENDIF

    // 2. Load Profile (User or Default)
    IF user_profile EXISTS THEN
        connector_profile = LoadUserProfile(user_profile, detected_connector)
    ELSE
        connector_profile = LoadDefaultProfile(detected_connector)
    ENDIF

    // 3. Pin Configuration
    FOR each pin IN pin_array DO
        IF connector_profile[pin.position] == "EXTEND" THEN
            ExtendPin(pin)
        ELSE IF connector_profile[pin.position] == "RETRACT" THEN
            RetractPin(pin)
        ELSE
            RetractPin(pin) // Default to retracted
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // 4. Power & Data Negotiation
    NegotiatePowerDelivery(connected_device)
    NegotiateDataProtocol(connected_device)

    RETURN success
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Innovation:** Moving beyond static adapter configurations. Adapts *physically* to the connected device, creating a truly universal connector. Allows for future-proofing against new connector standards. The color-changing shell provides visual feedback and personalization.
