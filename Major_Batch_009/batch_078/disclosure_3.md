## Dynamic Chart Composition via Generative AI

**Concept:** Extend linked charts to not merely *reflect* transformations, but *generate* supplementary charts based on user interaction, leveraging a generative AI model. This introduces a self-expanding visualization ecosystem.

**Specifications:**

1.  **AI Model Integration:** Integrate a Generative AI model (e.g., a diffusion model or a transformer network) trained on a dataset of chart types, data correlations, and visualization best practices. This model will be the ‘chart generator’.

2.  **Interaction Monitoring:** Monitor user interactions with existing linked charts – not just parameter transformations (zoom, filter), but also selections (data points, lines), and even dwell time on specific chart elements.

3.  **Contextual Prompt Generation:**  Translate user interactions into natural language prompts for the Generative AI model.  
    *   Example: "User zoomed into region X on time-series chart Y showing sales data. Generate a related chart visualizing customer demographics in that region for the same time period.”
    *   Example: “User selected data point Z on scatter plot A showing correlation between marketing spend and website traffic. Generate a bar chart showing the top 5 performing marketing channels for that specific data point.”

4.  **Chart Generation & Linking:** The Generative AI model, receiving the prompt, will generate a new chart (chart type, data mapping, visualization style) in a standardized format.  A linking mechanism will automatically establish bidirectional connections between the original chart and the generated chart. Transformations in either chart will propagate to the other.

5.  **Chart Library & Customization:**  Maintain a library of pre-trained chart styles and customization options (color palettes, fonts, aesthetics) to allow users to influence the output of the Generative AI model.

6.  **User Feedback Loop:**  Implement a user feedback mechanism (thumbs up/down, “re-generate,” “suggest alternative”) to refine the Generative AI model and improve chart generation quality.

**Pseudocode (Chart Generation Module):**

```
function generate_chart(user_interaction, source_chart):
  prompt = create_prompt(user_interaction, source_chart)
  generated_chart = AI_model.generate(prompt)  // Call to the AI model

  // Automatic Linking
  link_charts(source_chart, generated_chart)

  return generated_chart
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Chart`:  Object representing a chart (data source, visualization type, parameters, linked charts).
*   `UserInteraction`:  Object capturing user action (type, parameters, affected chart).
*   `Prompt`: String of natural language that instructs the AI Model to create a new chart.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Automated Insight Generation:**  Go beyond chart generation to suggest *insights* based on correlated data and user interactions.
*   **Personalized Visualization:**  Tailor chart generation to individual user preferences and roles.
*   **Real-time Data Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with real-time data streams to dynamically generate and update charts.
