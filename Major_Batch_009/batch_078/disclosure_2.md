## Secure Proximity-Based Service Discovery & Dynamic Access Control

**Concept:** Expand the trust establishment framework to facilitate secure, dynamic service discovery and access control between short-range devices *without* reliance on pre-shared credentials or central servers. Leverage the existing encrypted communication channel for negotiation and authorization.

**Specs:**

**1. Service Advertisement Protocol (SAP):**

*   **Data Structure:**  Short-range devices (e.g., sensors, actuators) will broadcast a SAP message. This message contains:
    *   `ServiceID`:  Unique identifier for the service offered.
    *   `ServiceType`: Categorization of the service (e.g., temperature sensor, lighting control).
    *   `SecurityFlags`:  Indicates required security level (e.g., read-only, authenticated access, encrypted communication).
    *   `Metadata`:  Optional descriptive information.
    *   `Signature`:  Digitally signed using the device’s private key.
*   **Transmission:** SAP messages broadcast periodically over the short-range communication channel.

**2. Discovery & Request Initiation:**

*   A hub device scans for SAP messages.
*   Upon finding a service of interest, the hub constructs a “Service Request” message. This message includes:
    *   `ServiceID`: The ID of the service being requested.
    *   `RequestedAccess`:  The level of access being requested (e.g., read, write, execute).
    *   `HubCapabilities`: A list of capabilities the Hub possesses (e.g., encryption support, authentication methods).
    *   `Challenge`: A random nonce for authentication.
*   The Service Request is *encrypted* using the *public* key of the service provider (obtained via a trusted key exchange – potentially extended from the original patent).

**3. Dynamic Authorization & Access Grant:**

*   The service provider decrypts the Service Request.
*   It verifies the Hub's capabilities and the Challenge.
*   Based on the requested access and its own policies, the service provider generates an “Access Token” or a “Denial Response”.
*   *If granted access*:
    *   The Access Token contains:
        *   `ExpirationTimestamp`: When the access expires.
        *   `AuthorizedOperations`: Specific operations allowed.
        *   `SessionKey`: A symmetric key for subsequent encrypted communication.
    *   The Access Token is *encrypted* using the *public* key of the hub.
*   The response (Access Token or Denial Response) is sent back to the hub via the established encrypted channel.

**4. Secure Communication:**

*   If access is granted, all subsequent communication between the hub and the service provider is encrypted using the `SessionKey` established in the Access Token.

**Pseudocode (Hub Side - Simplified):**

```
function discoverServices():
  scanShortRangeChannel()
  for message in messages:
    if message.isValidSignature():
      addServiceToList(message)

function requestAccess(serviceID, accessLevel):
  createServiceRequest(serviceID, accessLevel)
  encryptRequest(service.publicKey)
  sendEncryptedRequest(service)

  encryptedResponse = receiveEncryptedResponse()
  decryptedResponse = decryptResponse(privateKey)

  if decryptedResponse.accessGranted:
    sessionKey = decryptedResponse.sessionKey
    establishSecureChannel(sessionKey)
    return true
  else:
    return false
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires secure key generation and storage on both hub and short-range devices.
*   Lightweight encryption algorithms suitable for constrained devices.
*   Implementation of secure signature schemes.
*   Robust error handling and replay protection mechanisms.
