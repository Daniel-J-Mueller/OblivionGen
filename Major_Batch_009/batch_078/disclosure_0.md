## Dynamic Digital Diorama Generation

**Concept:** Expand the sticker/image placement concept into fully interactive, dynamic digital dioramas. Instead of simply placing images on a static background, users construct miniature 3D environments and populate them with catalog items.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Engine:** Utilize a lightweight real-time 3D rendering engine (e.g., Babylon.js, Three.js) to facilitate scene creation and manipulation. This will run within a web browser or dedicated app.
*   **Asset Library:** Integrate a library of pre-built 3D environment components (walls, floors, furniture, props). These should be modular and easily customizable (texture swaps, color adjustments, scaling). Initial library should focus on common room types (living room, bedroom, kitchen) but be extensible.
*   **Catalog Item Integration:** Allow seamless import of catalog items as 3D models (if available) or as textured planes mimicking 3D appearance. A system to automatically generate basic 3D proxies from 2D item images should be included.
*   **Interactive Placement System:** Implement a drag-and-drop interface for placing and manipulating items within the 3D scene. Snapping-to-grid, collision detection, and layer management should be included. Users can rotate, scale, and reposition items with intuitive controls.
*   **Lighting and Effects:** Offer basic lighting controls (ambient, directional, point lights) and visual effects (shadows, reflections) to enhance realism and visual appeal.
*   **"Living" Diorama Features:**
    *   **Animation:**  Enable simple animations for catalog items (e.g., turning on a lamp, opening a drawer). Triggered by user interaction or predefined rules.
    *   **Environmental Effects:** Integrate subtle environmental effects (e.g., falling snow, flickering fireplace) to create a more immersive experience.
    *   **Interactive Elements:** Allow users to define interactive elements within the diorama (e.g., clicking on a book to open a webpage, tapping on a TV to play a video).
*   **AI-Assisted Diorama Generation:**
    *   **Style Transfer:** Utilize AI models to apply different art styles (e.g., cartoon, realistic, minimalist) to the diorama.
    *   **Auto-Arrangement:** Provide an "auto-arrange" feature that automatically populates the diorama with items based on user-defined preferences (e.g., "cozy living room," "modern kitchen").  AI analyzes item characteristics and suggests optimal placement.
    *   **Room Recognition:** Allow users to upload a photo of their room, and the AI will generate a 3D model of the room to serve as the base for their diorama.
*   **Sharing and Collaboration:**
    *   **Diorama Export:** Allow users to export their dioramas as interactive 3D scenes or as static images/videos.
    *   **Social Sharing:** Integrate social sharing features to allow users to share their dioramas with friends and family.
    *   **Collaborative Editing:** Enable multiple users to collaborate on a diorama in real-time.

**Pseudocode (AI Auto-Arrangement):**

```
function autoArrange(roomType, items, userPreferences) {
  // 1. Analyze roomType and userPreferences to determine overall aesthetic and layout goals
  aestheticGoals = analyzePreferences(roomType, userPreferences)

  // 2. For each item in items:
  for (item in items) {
    // 3. Calculate "compatibility score" between item and aestheticGoals
    compatibilityScore = calculateCompatibility(item, aestheticGoals)

    // 4. Identify potential placement locations within the diorama
    potentialLocations = findPotentialLocations(item, diorama)

    // 5. For each potential location:
    for (location in potentialLocations) {
      // 6. Evaluate location based on compatibility score, spatial constraints, and aesthetic principles
      locationScore = evaluateLocation(location, item, locationScore)

      // 7. Store location score and item association
      storeLocationScore(location, item, locationScore)
    }
  }

  // 8. Sort locations by score and place items accordingly
  sortLocationsByScore(locations)
  placeItemsInLocations(locations)
}
```

This system offers a much richer and more engaging experience than simply placing stickers on a background, allowing users to visualize products in realistic contexts and express their creativity. The AI-assisted features can help streamline the process and provide personalized recommendations.
