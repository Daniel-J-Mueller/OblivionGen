## Adaptive Granularity Frequency Distribution for Predictive Maintenance

**Concept:** Extend the frequency distribution concept beyond simple counting to model asset degradation and predict maintenance needs. Instead of just tracking *how many* values fall into ranges, track *rate of change* within those ranges.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Input:** Stream of monitoring values representing asset health indicators (temperature, vibration, pressure, current draw, etc.). Multiple assets can contribute to this stream, each identified by a unique Asset ID.
*   **Baseline Establishment:** For each asset, establish a historical baseline frequency distribution (as described in the provided patent) over a defined calibration period. This baseline represents normal operating conditions.
*   **Real-time Stream:** Continuously receive real-time monitoring values.

**2. Dynamic Range Adjustment & Granularity:**

*   **Adaptive Range Width:** Range widths are not fixed. They adjust based on the *variance* of values within that range over a rolling window. High variance = smaller range width (finer granularity). Low variance = wider range width.
*   **Granularity Levels:** Implement multiple levels of granularity. Start with coarse granularity for initial monitoring.  As anomalies are detected (see section 4), dynamically increase granularity in affected ranges.
*   **Range Expansion:**  Similar to the provided patent, expand ranges when values exceed the upper limit. However, *also* contract ranges where values consistently fall far below the lower limit, optimizing range coverage.

**3. Degradation Tracking & Rate of Change:**

*   **Frequency Delta:** Instead of *absolute* frequency counts, track the *change* in frequency counts over defined time intervals (e.g., hourly, daily). This 'Frequency Delta' represents the rate at which values are shifting into different ranges.
*   **Weighted Delta:** Weight Frequency Deltas based on the *distance* from the baseline distribution. Large deviations from the baseline receive higher weights.
*   **Degradation Score:** Calculate a ‘Degradation Score’ for each asset by summing the weighted Frequency Deltas across all ranges.

**4. Anomaly Detection & Predictive Maintenance:**

*   **Thresholding:** Define thresholds for the Degradation Score.  Exceeding a threshold triggers an anomaly alert.
*   **Trend Analysis:** Analyze the *trend* of the Degradation Score over time.  A consistently increasing trend indicates accelerating degradation.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Use historical Degradation Score data to train a predictive model (e.g., linear regression, time series analysis) to forecast future degradation and estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL).
*   **Maintenance Scheduling:** Automatically schedule maintenance based on the predicted RUL, optimizing maintenance intervals and minimizing downtime.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Asset Data Structure
struct Asset {
    AssetID: string;
    BaselineDistribution: FrequencyDistribution; // From patent
    CurrentDistribution: FrequencyDistribution;
    DegradationScore: float;
    RUL: float;
}

// Function to update asset data
function UpdateAsset(asset: Asset, monitoringValue: float) {
    // 1. Update CurrentDistribution (similar to patent)
    UpdateFrequencyDistribution(asset.CurrentDistribution, monitoringValue);

    // 2. Calculate Frequency Delta for each range
    FrequencyDelta[i] = CurrentDistribution.frequency[i] - BaselineDistribution.frequency[i];

    // 3. Calculate Weighted Delta
    WeightedDelta[i] = FrequencyDelta[i] * Distance(CurrentDistribution.range[i], BaselineDistribution.range[i]);

    // 4. Calculate Degradation Score
    asset.DegradationScore = Sum(WeightedDelta);

    // 5. Predict RUL (using trained model)
    asset.RUL = PredictRUL(asset.DegradationScore, historicalData);
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Real-time data streaming pipeline (e.g., Kafka, MQTT).
*   Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) for storing monitoring data and Degradation Scores.
*   Machine learning platform (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for training predictive models.
*   Cloud infrastructure for scalability and reliability.
