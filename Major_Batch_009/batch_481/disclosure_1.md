## Dynamic Policy Enforcement via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Concept:** Extend the existing policy enforcement mechanism by integrating Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to create a more granular, dynamic, and trustless access control system.  Instead of solely relying on centrally stored policies, leverage a blockchain or distributed ledger to manage and verify access rights.

**Specifications:**

**1. DID/VC Integration Layer:**

*   **Component:**  DID/VC Manager.  This module sits between the external endpoint and the internal service.
*   **Function:**  Handles the exchange of DIDs and VCs.  The customer (owner of the external endpoint) registers a DID representing their endpoint. They then request VCs from authorized issuers (potentially the service provider or a third-party trust authority) representing specific access rights.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `DID`: String – Unique identifier for the external endpoint.
    *   `VC`: JSON Web Token (JWT) – Contains claims about the endpoint’s access rights, signed by an issuer.
    *   `PolicyDefinition`: JSON –  Defines acceptable VC claims for access (e.g., “must have VC issued by ‘Acme Corp’ with claim ‘access_level’ equal to ‘admin’”).
*   **API:**
    *   `registerDID()`:  Registers a DID for the external endpoint. Returns a confirmation receipt.
    *   `requestVC(issuer, claim)`: Requests a VC from a specified issuer for a given claim.  Returns the VC (if successful).
    *   `verifyVC(vc, policy)`: Verifies a VC against a predefined policy. Returns `true` or `false`.

**2. Dynamic Policy Engine:**

*   **Component:** Policy Engine (integrated into the internal endpoint).
*   **Function:**  Processes access requests based on VCs and policy definitions.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Receive request from external endpoint.
    2.  Extract DID from the request.
    3.  Request VC(s) associated with the DID from the DID registry (blockchain/DLT).
    4.  Verify VC(s) against defined policy.
    5.  Grant/deny access based on policy evaluation.

**3.  Blockchain/DLT Integration:**

*   **Component:** DID Registry.
*   **Technology:** Choice of DLT (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, IOTA).
*   **Data Structure:**  DID Document – Stores information about the DID, including its public key and service endpoint.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `resolveDID(did)`:  Retrieves the DID Document associated with a given DID.
    *   `registerDIDDocument(did, document)`:  Registers a new DID Document on the DLT.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function processAccessRequest(request):
  did = request.did
  policy = request.policy

  didDocument = resolveDID(did) // Fetch from DLT
  if didDocument == null:
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  vcs = didDocument.vcs // Extract VCs from DID Document

  for vc in vcs:
    if verifyVC(vc, policy): //Check VC against policy
      return ACCESS_GRANTED
  
  return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**Enhancements/Further Specifications:**

*   **Revocation Lists:** Implement VC revocation lists to invalidate compromised or revoked credentials.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Utilize ZKPs to allow the external endpoint to prove possession of specific credentials without revealing the underlying data.
*   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Integrate ABAC principles to define access control policies based on attributes of the endpoint, the user, and the resource being accessed.
*   **Policy as Code:** Define policies using a declarative language (e.g., Rego) to enable automated policy validation and enforcement.
