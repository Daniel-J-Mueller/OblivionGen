## Adaptive Recommendation 'Echo' System

**Concept:** A system that generates recommendations *about* recommendations, based on user interaction and a 'resonance' score. Instead of directly suggesting items, it suggests *patterns* of recommendations that a user might find appealing, effectively predicting what kind of recommendation *style* they'll respond to.

**Specs:**

1.  **Recommendation Database:** Maintain a comprehensive database of original recommendations (like those generated by the parent patent) alongside metadata: category, source, attributes, user interaction data (clicks, purchases, ratings, dwell time).
2.  **'Echo' Generation Module:** This module analyzes user interaction with original recommendations. It identifies commonalities in successfully engaged-with recommendations. Key factors: category clusters, attribute overlap, source weighting (trust score of the source).
3.  **Resonance Score:**  A metric calculated for each user. It represents their affinity for certain recommendation *styles*. Higher scores indicate strong preference.  Calculated via:
    *   **Category Resonance:** Weighting of categories within positively interacted-with recommendations.
    *   **Attribute Resonance:** Weighting of dominant attributes within positively interacted-with recommendations (e.g., 'high-rated', 'new release', 'discounted').
    *   **Source Resonance:**  Preference for specific recommendation sources.
4.  **'Echo' Recommendation Generation:** Based on the Resonance Score, generate ‘Echo’ recommendations. These are *not* direct item suggestions, but descriptions of recommendation characteristics. Examples:
    *   "We think you'd enjoy recommendations with a strong emphasis on recently released items."
    *   "You seem to prefer recommendations from sources known for expert reviews."
    *   "You've shown interest in items with high user ratings – we'll prioritize those in our suggestions."
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor user interaction with *both* original recommendations *and* the ‘Echo’ recommendations themselves.  Adjust the Resonance Score and ‘Echo’ generation algorithms accordingly.
6.  **Presentation Layer:** Implement a user interface that presents ‘Echo’ recommendations alongside original recommendations.  Users can explicitly “tune” their preferences by providing feedback on the ‘Echo’ recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Echo Generation):**

```
function generateEchoRecommendation(userID):
  userHistory = getUserRecommendationHistory(userID)
  categoryWeights = calculateCategoryWeights(userHistory)
  attributeWeights = calculateAttributeWeights(userHistory)
  sourceWeights = calculateSourceWeights(userHistory)

  // Select top N most resonant characteristics
  topCategories = getTopN(categoryWeights, 3)
  topAttributes = getTopN(attributeWeights, 3)
  topSources = getTopN(sourceWeights, 2)

  echoRecommendation = ""
  if topCategories:
    echoRecommendation += "We think you'd like recommendations focusing on " + join(topCategories, ", ") + "."
  if topAttributes:
    echoRecommendation += " You seem to prefer items with " + join(topAttributes, ", ") + "."
  if topSources:
    echoRecommendation += " Recommendations from " + join(topSources, " & ") + " are likely to appeal to you."

  return echoRecommendation
```

**Potential Downstream Applications:**

*   Personalized recommendation ‘playlists’ – curated sequences of recommendation styles.
*   AI-powered recommendation engine training – the Resonance Score could inform model weighting.
*   User preference profiling – deep understanding of what *kind* of recommendations drive engagement.
