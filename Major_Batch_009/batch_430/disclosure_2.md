## Adaptive Event Data Granularity & Predictive Notification

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of event notifications, but instead of a static level of detail, it dynamically adjusts the granularity of event data delivered to customers *based on predicted impact and real-time resource utilization*. It also proactively *predicts* potential impact before an event fully manifests, offering pre-emptive notifications.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Impact Prediction Engine (IPE):**  This engine leverages historical event data, real-time resource monitoring (CPU, Memory, Network I/O), and machine learning models to predict the potential impact of an ongoing event *before* it fully propagates.  Impact is scored across multiple dimensions (Performance Degradation, Data Loss Risk, Financial Cost).

2.  **Granularity Control Module (GCM):**  This module receives the impact score from the IPE and dynamically adjusts the level of detail included in event notifications.  Higher impact scores trigger more detailed data (e.g., specific affected resources, detailed logs, root cause analysis fragments), while lower scores deliver summarized information.

3.  **Resource-Aware Throttling:**  Notifications are throttled based on the *current load* of the customer's monitoring systems (or client devices).  If a customer's systems are already heavily loaded, notifications are either delayed or their granularity reduced to prevent cascading failures.

4.  **Proactive Notification Channel:** A dedicated channel for *predicted* impact notifications.  These notifications are flagged as "potential" and include recommended actions (e.g., scale resources, migrate workloads).

**Data Flow:**

1.  System detects an event impacting infrastructure.
2.  IPE analyzes event data and resource metrics to predict potential impact.
3.  GCM determines notification granularity based on impact score.
4.  System checks customer resource load.
5.  Notification (with adjusted granularity) is sent to customer’s monitoring system or client device.
6.  Proactive ‘potential impact’ notification sent via dedicated channel.
7.  Feedback loop: Customer actions (or lack thereof) are fed back into IPE to refine prediction models.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Control Module):**

```
function determineGranularity(impactScore, customerPreferences, resourceLoad) {

  if (impactScore > 0.8) { // Critical Impact
    granularity = "Detailed";  // Include logs, root cause fragments, impacted resource list
  } else if (impactScore > 0.5) { // Medium Impact
    granularity = "SummaryWithResources"; // Summarized description + list of impacted resources
  } else if (impactScore > 0.2) { // Low Impact
    granularity = "SummaryOnly"; // Brief summary of the event
  } else {
    granularity = "Minimal"; // Only essential information, if any.
  }

  //Adjust based on customer preferences:
  if(customerPreferences.alwaysDetailed) {
      granularity = "Detailed"
  }

  //Adjust based on resource load:
  if(resourceLoad > 0.9) {
      granularity = "Minimal" //Reduce to only essential information.
  }

  return granularity
}
```
