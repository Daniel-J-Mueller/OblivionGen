## Dynamic DNS Weighting via Client Device Signal Strength

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust DNS resolution weighting based on real-time signal strength data reported *from the client device itself*.

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on IP address to location mapping for routing. This is good, but passive. What if the *client* actively participated in the routing decision, providing immediate, real-time feedback? This isn’t about location; it’s about *current connectivity*.

**System Components:**

*   **Modified DNS Resolver:** The DNS resolver (likely at the CDN POP) needs to be able to accept an additional field in the DNS query – a “Signal Strength Indicator” (SSI). This field would be an integer value representing the device’s current signal strength (e.g., WiFi RSSI, cellular RSRP/RSRQ, or a combined metric).
*   **Client SDK:** A lightweight SDK integrated into client applications (web browsers, mobile apps, etc.). This SDK constantly monitors signal strength and, upon DNS resolution requests, populates the SSI field in the DNS query.
*   **Weighting Algorithm:** A server-side algorithm within the DNS resolver. This algorithm considers the SSI when determining which DNS records to return. Higher SSI values would result in a higher weighting for records associated with the "best" (currently strongest signal) POPs.
*   **POP Health Monitoring:** Existing POP health monitoring should be maintained to provide a baseline for routing decisions. SSI weighting acts *on top of* this baseline.

**Pseudocode (Weighting Algorithm):**

```
function resolveDNS(dnsQuery, queryIPAddress):
  popList = getAvailablePOPs()
  baselineWeights = calculateBaselineWeights(popList) // Based on latency, capacity, etc.

  if dnsQuery.hasSignalStrengthIndicator():
    signalStrength = dnsQuery.getSignalStrengthIndicator()
    weightedPOPs = adjustWeightsBySignalStrength(baselineWeights, signalStrength)
  else:
    weightedPOPs = baselineWeights // Use baseline weights if no SSI

  sortedPOPs = sortPOPsByWeight(weightedPOPs)
  return sortedPOPs // List of DNS records from best to worst POP
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `POPRecord`:  `{popID, latitude, longitude, capacity, latency, weight}`
*   `DNSQuery`: `{resourceIdentifier, queryIPAddress, signalStrengthIndicator}`

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **SSI Normalization:** Different signal strength metrics have different scales. The SDK should normalize the SSI value to a standard range (e.g., 0-100) before including it in the DNS query.
2.  **Weighting Function:** The `adjustWeightsBySignalStrength` function could use a linear, exponential, or logarithmic weighting scheme to adjust the POP weights based on the SSI value.  Experimentation will be needed to determine the optimal weighting function.
3.  **Caching:**  The system should cache the adjusted POP weights to reduce processing overhead. The cache invalidation strategy should consider changes in signal strength and network conditions.
4.  **Security:** The SSI field should be treated as untrusted data.  The server should validate the SSI value to prevent malicious clients from manipulating the routing decisions.



This system shifts from *predicting* the best route based on IP address to *actively learning* the best route based on real-time client feedback. This enables a more responsive and adaptive CDN, improving user experience, particularly in mobile or dynamic network environments.
