## Dynamic Watermark Injection & Behavioral Biometrics

**Core Concept:** Extend the fingerprinting process beyond static file analysis to include dynamic watermark injection *and* behavioral biometric capture during media playback. This creates a multi-layered authentication system that verifies not only the file's integrity but also the *way* it's being consumed, making unauthorized copies significantly harder to monetize.

**Specs:**

**I. Dynamic Watermark Generator (DWG)**

*   **Input:** Media file (audio/video), user account ID, timestamp, device ID.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Segmentation:** Divide media file into short, variable-length segments (e.g., 0.5-2 seconds).  Segment length is pseudo-randomly determined based on user account ID and timestamp.
    2.  **Perceptual Hashing:** Generate a perceptual hash for *each* segment.
    3.  **Watermark Embedding:** Embed a unique watermark (derived from user account ID, timestamp, and device ID) into the perceptual hash using a discrete cosine transform (DCT) or similar technique. This is NOT a visible watermark. It alters the perceptual hash in a way that's statistically detectable but imperceptible to the human ear/eye.
    4.  **Re-encoding:** Re-encode the segments with the modified perceptual hashes.
    5.  **Assembly:** Reassemble the segments into a new media file.
*   **Output:** Watermarked media file.

**II. Playback Monitoring & Behavioral Biometric Capture (PMBBC)**

*   **Process:** During media playback, the PMBBC module runs in the background.
    1.  **Segment Extraction:** Extracts segments from the playback stream.
    2.  **Perceptual Hash Calculation:** Calculates the perceptual hash of each extracted segment.
    3.  **Watermark Detection:** Attempts to detect the embedded watermark within the perceptual hash.
    4.  **Behavioral Capture:** Tracks user interaction metrics:
        *   **Playback Position Jitter:** Measures micro-variations in the playback position.  (Unauthorized copies often lack precise timing).
        *   **Buffering Events:** Detects and logs buffering events. (Indicates potential network issues or low-quality copies).
        *   **Seeking Behavior:** Analyzes seeking patterns (fast forward, rewind, skipping).
        *   **Volume/Brightness Adjustments:** Tracks frequency and magnitude of adjustments.
    5.  **Data Aggregation:** Combines watermark detection results with behavioral biometric data.

**III. Authentication Engine (AE)**

*   **Input:** Data from PMBBC (watermark detection results, behavioral biometrics).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Watermark Validation:** Verifies the detected watermark against expected values (derived from user account ID, timestamp, and device ID).
    2.  **Behavioral Anomaly Detection:** Uses a machine learning model (trained on legitimate user behavior) to identify anomalies in the captured behavioral biometrics.
    3.  **Risk Scoring:** Assigns a risk score based on watermark validation results and behavioral anomaly detection.
    4.  **Action:**
        *   **Low Risk:** Continue playback.
        *   **Medium Risk:** Display a warning message to the user.
        *   **High Risk:** Suspend playback and require re-authentication.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Engine):**

```
function authenticate(watermarkValid, behavioralScore):
  if watermarkValid == TRUE and behavioralScore > threshold:
    return TRUE
  else:
    return FALSE
```

**Novelty:** This system doesnâ€™t rely solely on static file fingerprints. It combines those with *dynamic* watermarks and actively monitors how the file is *used*. Unauthorized copies will either lack the correct watermark or exhibit abnormal behavioral patterns, making them easily identifiable.  The combination significantly raises the barrier to effective piracy. The behavioral aspect could even differentiate between legitimate users on the same account (e.g., family members).
