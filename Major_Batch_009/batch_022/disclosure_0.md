## Secure Credential 'Ghosting' & Dynamic Delegation

**Concept:** Extend the temporary credential reset functionality to create dynamically delegated access 'ghosts'. Instead of simply resetting to a single temporary password, the system creates short-lived, narrowly scoped credentials tied to *specific actions* or resources, effectively ‘ghosting’ access rights. These ghosts are automatically revoked after the action completes or a very short time period, minimizing the attack surface.

**Specifications:**

**1. Ghost Credential Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** User request for credential reset (initiated as in the existing patent), target resource/action (e.g., "Access file X," "Authorize transaction Y," "Change setting Z"), duration (automatically set, adjustable by admin policy).
*   **Process:**
    *   Decrypt account data using master security credential.
    *   Identify relevant authentication services associated with the target resource/action.
    *   Generate a unique, short-lived credential (e.g., JWT, limited-use token) authorized *only* for the specified resource/action. This credential bypasses traditional password entry.
    *   Log credential generation event (timestamp, user, resource, action, IP address).
*   **Output:**  Ghost credential, activation parameters (resource/action scope, expiration time).

**2.  Dynamic Delegation Engine:**

*   **Input:** User request to perform action/access resource.
*   **Process:**
    *   Check for active ghost credential associated with the user & target.
    *   If found, automatically authenticate the user using the ghost credential *without* prompting for a password.
    *   Record successful authentication event.
    *   If no ghost credential found, fall back to existing authentication methods.
*   **Output:** Authentication success/failure.

**3. Automated Revocation Service:**

*   **Process:** Regularly scans for expired ghost credentials.
*   **Action:**  Revokes expired credentials by invalidating the tokens at the appropriate authentication services. Logs revocation events.

**4. Policy Engine:**

*   **Configuration:**  Administrators define policies governing ghost credential usage:
    *   Allowed actions/resources for ghost credentials.
    *   Maximum ghost credential lifetime.
    *   Auditing requirements (logging levels).
    *   User/group-based restrictions.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Delegation Engine):**

```
function authenticateUser(userId, resource, action) {
  ghostCredential = getGhostCredential(userId, resource, action);

  if (ghostCredential != null && ghostCredential.isValid()) {
    // Authenticate user using ghostCredential (bypass password)
    authenticationService.authenticate(userId, ghostCredential);
    logEvent("Ghost Credential Authentication Success");
    return SUCCESS;
  } else {
    // Fallback to traditional authentication
    result = traditionalAuthentication(userId);
    return result;
  }
}

function getGhostCredential(userId, resource, action) {
  // Query database for active ghost credentials matching userId, resource, and action
  credentials = database.query("SELECT * FROM ghost_credentials WHERE userId = ? AND resource = ? AND action = ? AND expiration > NOW()", userId, resource, action);

  if (credentials.size() > 0) {
    return credentials[0];
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Existing authentication management service infrastructure.
*   Secure database for storing ghost credentials.
*   API integration with authentication services.
*   Policy management interface.
*   Auditing and logging capabilities.
