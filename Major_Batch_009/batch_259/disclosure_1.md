**Adaptive Behavioral Profiling with Multi-Modal Data Fusion**

**Specification:**

**1. Overview:**

This design expands on the concept of timing vectors by incorporating multi-modal data streams beyond simple log actions. It aims to create a richer, more nuanced behavioral profile of a user or account, improving anomaly detection accuracy and reducing false positives. This is accomplished by fusing data from device telemetry, network traffic analysis, and application usage patterns alongside traditional log data.

**2. Data Sources:**

*   **Log Actions:** (As in the provided patent) â€“ Create, Read, Update, Delete operations, API calls, etc.
*   **Device Telemetry:** CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, battery level (for mobile devices), geolocation data.
*   **Network Traffic:** Protocol types, source/destination IPs, packet sizes, connection durations, DNS queries, TLS/SSL certificate information.
*   **Application Usage:** Applications launched, duration of use, frequency of access, specific features used within applications.

**3. Data Processing Pipeline:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Each data source feeds into a dedicated ingestion module.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Each module extracts relevant features from its data stream. Examples:
    *   Log Actions: Action type, timestamp, resource accessed.
    *   Device Telemetry: CPU load average, memory usage percentage.
    *   Network Traffic: Average packet size, number of unique destination IPs.
    *   Application Usage: Total application runtime, number of API calls.
3.  **Data Normalization:** Features are normalized to a common scale (e.g., 0-1) to prevent dominance by features with large values.
4.  **Time-Series Creation:** Data points are organized into time series for each feature.
5.  **Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Training:** Multiple HMMs are trained, each focused on a specific data modality (log actions, device telemetry, network traffic, application usage). Each HMM generates a hidden state vector.
6.  **Weighted Fusion:** The hidden state vectors from each HMM are combined using a weighted sum. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on the reliability and relevance of each data modality.  A weighting algorithm could utilize a Bayesian approach.
7.  **Behavioral Profile Creation:** The fused hidden state vector represents the user's current behavioral profile. This profile is compared to historical profiles.
8.  **Anomaly Detection:** Discrepancies between the current profile and historical profiles trigger anomaly detection alerts.
9.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns from new data, updating the HMMs, weights, and historical profiles.

**4. Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Input: Current data streams (log actions, device telemetry, network traffic, app usage)

// 1. Extract features from each data stream
features_log = extract_features_log(data_log)
features_device = extract_features_device(data_device)
features_network = extract_features_network(data_network)
features_app = extract_features_app(data_app)

// 2. Generate hidden state vectors using respective HMMs
hidden_state_log = HMM_log.predict(features_log)
hidden_state_device = HMM_device.predict(features_device)
hidden_state_network = HMM_network.predict(features_network)
hidden_state_app = HMM_app.predict(features_app)

// 3. Calculate weights for each modality (dynamic adjustment)
weight_log, weight_device, weight_network, weight_app = calculate_weights(hidden_state_log, hidden_state_device, hidden_state_network, hidden_state_app, historical_data)

// 4. Fuse hidden state vectors
fused_hidden_state = weight_log * hidden_state_log + weight_device * hidden_state_device + weight_network * hidden_state_network + weight_app * hidden_state_app

// 5. Compare fused hidden state to historical baseline profile
anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(fused_hidden_state, historical_profile)

// 6. Trigger alert if anomaly score exceeds threshold
if anomaly_score > threshold:
    trigger_alert(anomaly_score)
```

**5.  Components:**

*   **Data Ingestion Modules:** Responsible for collecting and pre-processing data from various sources.
*   **Feature Extraction Modules:** Extract relevant features from each data stream.
*   **HMM Training Modules:** Train HMMs for each data modality.
*   **Weighting Algorithm:** Dynamically adjusts weights based on data reliability and relevance.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Calculates anomaly scores and triggers alerts.
*   **Data Storage:** Stores historical data, HMMs, and profiles.

**6.  Potential Improvements:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to optimize the weighting algorithm.
*   **Federated Learning:** Train HMMs using federated learning to improve privacy and scalability.
*   **Explainable AI:** Provide explanations for anomaly detections.
*   **Real-time Analysis:**  Optimize the pipeline for real-time analysis of streaming data.
