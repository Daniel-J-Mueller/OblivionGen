**Adaptive Sharding based on Query Load Prediction**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust replica group membership (sharding) based on predicted query load for specific data subsets. This goes beyond simply adding/removing replicas; it involves *moving* data between replica groups to optimize for anticipated access patterns.

**II. Components:**

*   **Query Load Predictor (QLP):**  A machine learning model trained on historical query data (timestamp, data range, query type).  Output: Predicted query rate for specific data ranges over a defined future time window (e.g., next 5 minutes, next hour).
*   **Sharding Manager (SM):**  Responsible for enacting sharding changes.  Interfaces with the Control Plane of the existing patent, but adds a layer of intelligent decision-making.
*   **Data Mover (DM):**  A component responsible for efficiently transferring data *between* replica groups.  Uses a checksum/versioning scheme to ensure data consistency.
*   **Metadata Store:**  Stores mapping of data ranges to replica groups, QLP predictions, and DM status.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Prediction:** The QLP continuously analyzes query logs and generates predictions for future query load on various data ranges.
2.  **Evaluation:** The SM periodically evaluates QLP predictions against current replica group load. If a significant imbalance is detected (e.g., predicted load on replica group A is 3x higher than group B), it initiates a re-sharding operation.
3.  **Re-Sharding Plan:** The SM generates a plan to move data from overloaded replica groups to underloaded ones.  This plan prioritizes minimizing data movement and disruption to ongoing queries.
4.  **Data Movement:** The DM executes the plan.  This involves:
    *   Identifying data to be moved.
    *   Copying data to the target replica group.
    *   Updating metadata to reflect the new data location.
    *   Verifying data consistency using checksums.
    *   Removing data from the source replica group *after* successful verification.
5.  **Query Routing Update:** The SM updates query routing tables to direct queries to the appropriate replica groups based on the new data locations.
6.  **Monitoring & Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors performance and adjusts the re-sharding plan as needed.

**IV. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Query Load Predictor (QLP)
function predictQueryLoad(historicalData, timeWindow):
  // Train ML model (e.g., time series forecasting)
  predictedLoad = model.predict(historicalData, timeWindow)
  return predictedLoad

// Sharding Manager (SM)
function evaluateSharding(currentSharding, predictedLoad):
  imbalanceDetected = false
  for each replicaGroup in currentSharding:
    if predictedLoad[replicaGroup] > threshold:
      imbalanceDetected = true
      break
  return imbalanceDetected

function generateReShardingPlan(currentSharding, predictedLoad):
  plan = {}
  for each replicaGroup in currentSharding:
    if predictedLoad[replicaGroup] > threshold:
      // Identify data to move (based on data range)
      dataToMove = findDataToMove(replicaGroup)
      // Select target replica group (least loaded)
      targetReplicaGroup = selectTarget(dataToMove)
      plan[replicaGroup] = {target: targetReplicaGroup, data: dataToMove}
  return plan

// Data Mover (DM)
function moveData(plan):
  for each sourceReplicaGroup, details in plan:
    data = details.data
    targetReplicaGroup = details.target
    // Copy data to target
    copyData(sourceReplicaGroup, targetReplicaGroup, data)
    // Verify data
    verifyData(sourceReplicaGroup, targetReplicaGroup, data)
    // Delete data from source
    deleteData(sourceReplicaGroup, data)

// Main loop
while true:
  predictedLoad = predictQueryLoad(queryLogs, timeWindow)
  if evaluateSharding(currentSharding, predictedLoad):
    reShardingPlan = generateReShardingPlan(currentSharding, predictedLoad)
    moveData(reShardingPlan)
    updateQueryRouting(currentSharding)
  sleep(interval)
```

**V. Considerations:**

*   **Data Locality:**  Prioritize moving data that is frequently accessed together.
*   **Consistency:** Implement robust consistency mechanisms to prevent data loss or corruption.
*   **Performance:**  Optimize data transfer and routing to minimize latency.
*   **Cost:** Balance the cost of data movement with the benefits of improved performance.
