## Adaptive Resource Entanglement for Collaborative AI Agents

**Concept:** Extend the multi-party access control described in the patent to facilitate dynamic, temporary "entanglement" of computing resources between independent AI agents. This entanglement would allow agents to collaboratively process data or execute tasks, but with strict, auditable access controls enforced by a central manager. The goal is to enable complex, distributed AI workflows without compromising data security or intellectual property.

**Specifications:**

*   **Entanglement Profiles:** Define configurable profiles specifying allowed interactions between AI agents. These profiles go beyond simple read/write access; they define *functional* access – what operations one agent can request another to perform.  Example: Agent A (image recognition) can request Agent B (object tracking) to track identified objects in a video stream, but cannot access the internal parameters of Agent B’s tracking algorithm.

*   **Resource Tokens:** When an AI agent requests access to a resource controlled by another agent, the resource access manager (RAM) generates a temporary, scoped resource token. This token encapsulates the entanglement profile, access duration, and a cryptographic signature verifying its authenticity.

*   **Functional Call Graph:**  Instead of raw data access, the RAM mediates communication via a functional call graph. Agent A sends a request to Agent B specifying the function to be executed and the input parameters. The RAM verifies the request against the entanglement profile before forwarding it.

*   **Attestation & Provenance:** Every functional call is digitally attested by both the requesting and responding agents, and a full provenance record is maintained by the RAM. This record includes timestamps, agent IDs, function names, input parameters, and output data.

*   **Dynamic Profile Updates:** Entanglement profiles can be dynamically updated during runtime based on pre-defined policies or manual overrides.  This allows for adaptive resource allocation and response to changing security threats.

**Pseudocode (RAM - Resource Access Manager):**

```
function handleRequest(request, agentA, agentB, resource):
  profile = getEntanglementProfile(agentA, agentB, resource)

  if profile == null:
    log("No entanglement profile found")
    return denyAccess()

  if not request.function in profile.allowedFunctions:
    log("Function not allowed by profile")
    return denyAccess()

  token = generateResourceToken(request, profile)
  attestation = agentB.attestRequest(token)

  if not attestation.valid:
    log("Attestation failed")
    return denyAccess()

  result = agentB.executeFunction(request.function, request.parameters)
  logProvenance(request, result, agentA, agentB)

  return grantAccess(result)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Secure Enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) to protect cryptographic keys and sensitive data within the RAM.
*   High-bandwidth network connectivity to support real-time communication between AI agents.
*   Hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations and attestation processes.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Federated learning with enhanced privacy and security.
*   Distributed robotics and autonomous systems.
*   Collaborative data analysis and scientific discovery.
*   Secure AI-powered services in regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, finance).
