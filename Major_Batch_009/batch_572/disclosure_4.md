## Dynamic Contextual View Stacking & "Ghosting"

**Concept:** Expand the "flipping" view transition to a multi-layered stack, introducing persistent, semi-transparent "ghost" views of previous states alongside the current, active view. This allows for richer contextual awareness and more complex interactions without losing sight of prior information.

**Specification:**

**1. View Stack Management:**

*   **Data Structure:** Implement a stack data structure to manage views. Each element in the stack represents a view state.
*   **Push/Pop Operations:** Standard stack operations (push to add a view, pop to remove). Transitions (like adding to a shopping cart) push new views onto the stack. "Undo" operations pop views.
*   **Maximum Stack Depth:** Define a maximum stack depth to prevent excessive memory usage.  The oldest views are discarded when the limit is reached.

**2. Ghost View Rendering:**

*   **Transparency:** Render views below the current active view with varying degrees of transparency.  Views further down the stack have greater transparency.  (e.g. Active view: 100% opacity. 1 level below: 70%. 2 levels below: 40%. 3 levels below: 10%).
*   **Partial Opacity:** Allow individual elements within a ghost view to have different opacity levels. For instance, only changed elements from the previous state are rendered with slight opacity, drawing user attention to updates.
*   **Dimming & Focus:**  When a user interacts with a ghost view element, temporarily increase its opacity and highlight it, drawing focus. This provides a clear connection between the current action and the previous state.

**3. Interaction Model:**

*   **Tap-to-Activate:** Users can tap on ghost views to instantly "pop" them to the active view, reverting to that state. This allows for rapid navigation through past decisions.
*   **Swipe-to-Reveal:** Implement a swipe gesture on the active view to reveal more ghost views, creating a dynamic, layered display of history.
*   **Contextual Actions:**  Ghost view elements can trigger contextual actions. For example, tapping on a removed item in a shopping cart ghost view could re-add it to the current cart.
*   **Animated Transitions:** Transitions between views (push/pop) should be smooth and visually engaging, using animations that emphasize the stacking effect.

**4. System Components:**

*   **View Manager Module:** Responsible for managing the view stack, rendering views with appropriate transparency, and handling transitions.
*   **Gesture Recognizer Module:** Detects user gestures (taps, swipes) and translates them into actions within the View Manager.
*   **Rendering Engine:**  Handles the actual rendering of views with transparency and animations.
*   **State Management System:**  Tracks the state of each view in the stack, allowing for accurate rendering and contextual actions.

**Pseudocode (View Manager - Push Operation):**

```
function pushView(newView):
  if viewStack.length >= maxStackDepth:
    removeOldestView()

  viewStack.push(newView)
  renderViewStack()

function renderViewStack():
  for i = 0 to viewStack.length - 1:
    currentView = viewStack[i]
    opacity = 100 - (i * 30) // Calculate opacity based on stack depth
    render(currentView, opacity)
```

**Novelty:**  Existing "flipping" transitions are typically binary (one view or the other). This expands on that concept by creating a persistent, layered history, providing richer contextual awareness and a more fluid user experience. Itâ€™s more than just visual flair; it fundamentally changes how users navigate and interact with information.
