## Automated Resource Dependency Mapping & Proactive Policy Generation

**Concept:** Expand beyond role-based access control to dynamically map application resource dependencies *during* the provisioning process and proactively generate/suggest granular IAM policies tailored to those dependencies. This addresses potential over-provisioning of permissions inherent in broader role assignments and enhances security posture.

**Specs:**

**1. Dependency Mapping Engine:**

*   **Input:** Application definition (e.g., container image, deployment manifest, cloudformation template), selected region, VPC configuration.
*   **Process:**
    *   Static Analysis: Parse application definition to identify declared resource requests (e.g., database connections, storage buckets, API calls).
    *   Dynamic Analysis (Sandbox): Deploy a minimal, isolated instance of the application within a secure sandbox environment.
    *   Runtime Monitoring: Monitor application behavior during sandbox execution – track API calls, network connections, file access, and other resource interactions.  This is critical to identify *implicit* dependencies not explicitly declared in the application definition.
    *   Dependency Graph Generation: Construct a directed graph representing all identified resource dependencies. Nodes represent resources; edges represent the type of access required.
*   **Output:**  A structured dependency graph (JSON, YAML) detailing all required resources and access levels.

**2. Policy Generation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Dependency graph, user account details, existing IAM policies (optional).
*   **Process:**
    *   Policy Rule Construction: For each dependency, generate a minimal IAM policy rule granting only the necessary permissions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `dynamodb:GetItem`).
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege – grant only the permissions required for the application to function.
    *   Policy Consolidation:  Combine individual policy rules into a consolidated IAM policy document.
    *   Policy Suggestion: Present the generated policy to the user for review and approval. Offer a one-click deployment option.
    *   Automated Updates: Monitor application behavior post-deployment.  If new dependencies are detected, trigger an automated policy update request.

**3. Integration with Launch Wizard/Deployment Service:**

*   The Dependency Mapping & Policy Generation Engine is integrated into the existing launch wizard or deployment service.
*   During application provisioning, the system automatically performs dependency mapping and policy generation.
*   The user is presented with a clear overview of the generated policies before deployment.

**Pseudocode (Policy Generation):**

```
function generatePolicy(dependencyGraph) {
  policyDocument = {}
  policyDocument.Version = "2012-10-17"
  policyDocument.Statement = []

  for each dependency in dependencyGraph {
    statement = {}
    statement.Effect = "Allow"
    statement.Action = dependency.requiredPermissions
    statement.Resource = dependency.resourceARN

    policyDocument.Statement.push(statement)
  }

  return JSON.stringify(policyDocument)
}
```

**Considerations:**

*   Sandbox environment must be robust and isolated to prevent malicious code execution.
*   Dynamic analysis may introduce latency during provisioning.
*   Granular policies can increase complexity of IAM management.
*   Monitoring for new dependencies post-deployment is crucial to maintain security.
*   Integration with existing identity management systems is essential.
