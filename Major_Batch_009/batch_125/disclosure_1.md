## Dynamic Network Topology Mapping via Status Request Injection & Triangulation

**Concept:** Leverage the existing status request system not just for health monitoring, but for *active* network topology discovery and mapping.  Instead of simply confirming pathway availability, inject unique, identifiable data packets into status requests and analyze their propagation to infer network links and node positions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Packet Injection Module:**

*   **Function:** Modifies outgoing status requests to include a "Topology Probe" packet.
*   **Probe Packet Structure:**
    *   `Probe ID`: Unique identifier for this probe. (UUID)
    *   `Origin Endpoint ID`: ID of the initiating endpoint.
    *   `Hop Count`:  Initial value = 0.  Incremented at each hop.
    *   `Timestamp`:  Time of injection.
    *   `Signal Strength`:  Optional â€“ for rudimentary distance estimation.
*   **Injection Logic:**  Randomly select a subset of status requests to include a probe packet. Adjustable probability.

**2. Probe Reception & Logging Module (Implemented on each Endpoint):**

*   **Function:**  Receives status requests containing probe packets.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Extract Probe Packet data.
    *   Increment `Hop Count`.
    *   Record reception time and endpoint ID.
    *   Log entry: `{Probe ID, Origin Endpoint ID, Receiving Endpoint ID, Reception Time, Hop Count}`
    *   Forward the status request (and probe packet) if not the destination.

**3. Topology Inference Engine (Centralized Server):**

*   **Function:** Collects probe reception logs from all endpoints.  Reconstructs the network topology.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Data Collection:** Gather all probe reception logs.
    2.  **Path Reconstruction:** For each `Probe ID`, identify the sequence of endpoints through which the probe traveled. This forms a network path.
    3.  **Link Inference:**  If a probe travels from Endpoint A to Endpoint B, infer a direct link between them.  Strength of the link can be estimated based on the number of probes that traverse it.
    4.  **Latency Estimation:**  Calculate the latency of each link based on the time difference between probe reception at consecutive endpoints.
    5.  **Visualization:**  Generate a dynamic network topology map displaying endpoints, links, latency, and link strength.

**4. Dynamic Mapping & Adaptive Probing:**

*   **Adaptive Probing:** Adjust the frequency and intensity of probe packet injection based on network conditions.  Increase probing in areas with high churn or suspected failures.
*   **Topology Change Detection:**  Continuously monitor the network topology map for changes.  Alert administrators to new links, broken links, or significant performance degradation.

**Pseudocode (Topology Inference Engine - Simplified):**

```
function infer_topology(logs):
  topology = {} // {endpoint_id: {neighbors: [neighbor_id, ...], latency: {...}}}
  paths = group_logs_by_probe_id(logs)

  for path in paths:
    for i in range(len(path) - 1):
      endpoint_a = path[i].receiving_endpoint_id
      endpoint_b = path[i+1].receiving_endpoint_id

      if endpoint_a not in topology:
        topology[endpoint_a] = {"neighbors": [], "latency": {}}

      if endpoint_b not in topology[endpoint_a]["neighbors"]:
        topology[endpoint_a]["neighbors"].append(endpoint_b)
        topology[endpoint_a]["latency"][endpoint_b] = path[i+1].reception_time - path[i].reception_time

  return topology
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Path Probing:** Inject multiple probes simultaneously with different routes to improve accuracy and resilience.
*   **Signal Strength Analysis:** Use signal strength readings to estimate the distance between endpoints and create a more detailed map.
*   **Integration with Existing Network Management Tools:** Integrate the topology mapping data with existing network management tools for a comprehensive view of the network.
