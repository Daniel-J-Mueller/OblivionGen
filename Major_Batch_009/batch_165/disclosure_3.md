## Adaptive Tensor Decomposition for Sparsity Control

**Specification:** A system for dynamically decomposing tensors within neural networks to promote sparsity and reduce computational load, adapting the decomposition based on activation patterns.

**Core Concept:** Instead of static tensor decomposition (e.g., CP or Tucker decomposition applied once during model initialization), we introduce a mechanism to *re-decompose* tensors during runtime based on observed activation sparsity. The system monitors activation patterns across layers, identifies sparse activation regions within tensors, and selectively decomposes only those regions. This allows for fine-grained control of computational cost, prioritizing decomposition in areas where it yields the most benefit.

**System Components:**

1.  **Activation Monitor:** Tracks activation values across all layers during forward passes. Calculates sparsity metrics (e.g., percentage of zero activations) for each tensor.
2.  **Decomposition Engine:** Implements various tensor decomposition techniques (CP, Tucker, etc.). Selects the most appropriate decomposition method based on tensor shape and observed sparsity.
3.  **Sparsity Threshold Controller:** Dynamically adjusts the sparsity threshold for decomposition.  Higher thresholds mean only extremely sparse regions are decomposed, reducing overhead. Uses a feedback loop based on performance metrics (latency, throughput).
4.  **Recomposition Manager:**  Orchestrates the entire process.  Monitors activation sparsity, triggers decomposition/recomposition, manages memory allocation for decomposed tensors, and blends decomposed tensors back into the original network during forward/backward passes.

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
Initialize:
  For each tensor T in the network:
    Monitor activation sparsity S(T) = 0 

During forward/backward pass:
  For each tensor T:
    Update S(T) based on observed activation values

  If S(T) > Threshold: # Trigger decomposition
    Decompose T into a set of lower-rank tensors T_decomposed using chosen decomposition method
    Replace T with T_decomposed in the network graph
    
  Else: #Recompose
    If T_decomposed exists:
      Reconstruct T from T_decomposed
      Replace T_decomposed with T in the network graph
      
  Update performance metrics (latency, throughput)

  Adjust Threshold based on performance metrics (e.g., using a PID controller)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires hardware acceleration for tensor decomposition and reconstruction.  Dedicated tensor processing units (TPUs) or GPUs are well-suited.
*   Efficient memory management is crucial to minimize the overhead of storing both the original and decomposed tensors.
*   Data locality optimizations are important to reduce memory access latency.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced computational cost, particularly for sparse neural networks.
*   Improved energy efficiency.
*   Adaptive performance based on input data and network activation patterns.
*   Enhanced model compression.

**Novelty:** Existing tensor decomposition methods are typically applied statically during model training or inference. This system introduces a *dynamic* approach that adapts to runtime activation patterns, leading to more efficient and flexible neural networks.
