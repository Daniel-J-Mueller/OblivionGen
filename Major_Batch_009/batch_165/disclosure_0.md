## Adaptive Event Stream Granularity

**Specification:** Implement a system to dynamically adjust the granularity of event streams delivered to clients based on client device capabilities, network conditions, and user activity. This goes beyond simple filtering; it's about *how much* data is sent per event.

**Components:**

1.  **Granularity Profiles:** Define pre-set granularity levels (e.g., "Minimal", "Standard", "Detailed") for different event types. Each level specifies which fields are included in the event payload.  "Minimal" might send only event ID and timestamp. "Detailed" would include all available data.

2.  **Client Capability Assessment:** The server maintains a profile for each connected client, detailing device type, screen resolution, CPU speed, estimated network bandwidth, and battery level. This data can be obtained through initial client handshake or periodic probing.

3.  **Contextual Analysis Engine:** Monitors user activity (e.g., scrolling speed, interaction frequency, app focus) and network conditions (latency, packet loss).  This informs dynamic adjustments to granularity.

4.  **Granularity Controller:** A server-side component responsible for mapping client profiles, contextual data, and event types to optimal granularity levels. It modifies event payloads *before* transmission.

5.  **Event Payload Modification Module:** This module takes an event and, based on the selected granularity level, includes or excludes specific fields from the payload.  It handles serialization/deserialization efficiently.

**Workflow:**

1.  Client connects and provides initial capability data.
2.  Server creates a client profile and assigns a baseline granularity level.
3.  As events occur, the Contextual Analysis Engine monitors user activity and network conditions.
4.  The Granularity Controller evaluates the client profile, contextual data, and event type.
5.  The Event Payload Modification Module alters the event payload based on the selected granularity level.
6.  The modified event is transmitted to the client.
7.  The system continuously adjusts granularity levels in response to changing conditions.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Controller):**

```
function determineGranularity(clientProfile, eventType, contextualData):
  baseGranularity = clientProfile.getDefaultGranularity(eventType)
  networkConditionModifier = getNetworkConditionModifier(contextualData.networkLatency, contextualData.packetLoss)
  userActivityModifier = getUserActivityModifier(contextualData.scrollingSpeed, contextualData.interactionFrequency)
  finalGranularity = baseGranularity + networkConditionModifier + userActivityModifier

  //Enforce boundaries on granularity level
  if (finalGranularity > MAX_GRANULARITY):
    finalGranularity = MAX_GRANULARITY
  elif (finalGranularity < MIN_GRANULARITY):
    finalGranularity = MIN_GRANULARITY

  return finalGranularity
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ClientProfile`:  Includes device type, screen resolution, CPU speed, network bandwidth estimate, battery level, default granularity levels for different event types.
*   `GranularityLevel`: An integer representing the level of detail (e.g., 1 = Minimal, 2 = Standard, 3 = Detailed).
*   `Event`:  A data structure containing event data. Fields can be conditionally included or excluded based on the granularity level.
