**Candidate Sentiment & Predictive Rescheduling System**

**Concept:** Expand beyond predicting *appointment* numbers to predicting *candidate engagement* and proactively rescheduling based on sentiment analysis. The core idea leverages real-time analysis of candidate communication (text/voice) during initial contact/screening to predict 'no-show' risk and reschedule appointments *before* they are missed, maximizing efficiency and candidate satisfaction.

**Specs:**

1.  **Communication Interface:** Integration with existing communication channels (SMS, email, phone systems, video conferencing). API for adding new channels.
2.  **Sentiment Analysis Engine:** 
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) module for text analysis. Pre-trained models for baseline sentiment, intent, and emotional state detection.
    *   Voice analysis module. Feature extraction (pitch, tone, speech rate). Machine learning model trained on labeled audio data to correlate acoustic features with candidate sentiment.
    *   Multi-modal fusion: Combines text and voice analysis to enhance accuracy.
3.  **Risk Scoring Model:**
    *   Input: Sentiment scores (text & voice), communication patterns (response time, message length), historical data (no-show rate for similar candidates).
    *   Model: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) or similar ensemble method. Outputs a ‘no-show risk score’ (0-100).
4.  **Predictive Rescheduling Algorithm:**
    *   Trigger: Risk score exceeds a predefined threshold (adjustable per site/role).
    *   Action: Automated rescheduling attempt. 
        *   Priority 1: Offer alternative time slots *immediately* via preferred channel.
        *   Priority 2: If no immediate response, escalate to a recruiter for personalized rescheduling.
5.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Algorithm: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent.
    *   Objective: Maximize show rates and minimize recruiter workload.
    *   State: Current risk score, historical show rate, recruiter availability.
    *   Action: Adjust the risk score threshold for triggering rescheduling.
6.  **Candidate Profile Integration:**  Associate risk scores and rescheduling history with candidate profiles for long-term analysis and improved prediction accuracy.
7.  **Recruiter Dashboard:**  Real-time view of at-risk candidates, rescheduling requests, and overall system performance. 
8. **Alerting System:** Integration with existing notification systems (Slack, email) to alert recruiters to urgent rescheduling needs.

**Pseudocode (Rescheduling Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION RescheduleCandidate(candidateID, riskScore):
  IF riskScore > threshold:
    availableSlots = GetAvailableSlots(candidatePreferences)
    IF availableSlots != NULL:
      SendRescheduleOffer(candidateID, availableSlots)
      response = WaitForResponse(timeout)
      IF response == ACCEPT:
        UpdateAppointment(candidateID, newSlot)
        LogReschedule(candidateID, success)
      ELSE:
        EscalateToRecruiter(candidateID)
        LogReschedule(candidateID, escalation)
    ELSE:
      EscalateToRecruiter(candidateID)
      LogReschedule(candidateID, no_slots)
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
