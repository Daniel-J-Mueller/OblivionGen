## Federated Identity & Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the federated messaging system to incorporate a dynamic trust scoring mechanism, not just for network-to-network communication permissions, but for individual user reputation *within* the federated system. This moves beyond simple allow/deny lists and allows for graduated trust levels, influencing message delivery prioritization, content filtering, and even feature access.

**Specs:**

**1. Trust Score Database:**

*   **Data Points:**
    *   **Network Reputation:** Baseline trust assigned to each participating secure communication network. (Initial value, adjustable by admins).
    *   **User Activity:** Frequency of communication, message volume, types of content shared (metadata analysis, not content inspection initially).
    *   **User Verification Level:**  Integration with identity providers (e.g., verified email, multi-factor authentication, government ID). Higher verification = higher initial score.
    *   **Peer Reporting:**  A mechanism for users to report suspicious activity (spam, harassment).  Reports *reduce* score – requires moderation and thresholding.
    *   **Positive Interactions:**  "Appreciation" or "Acknowledgement" features – users can positively signal interactions (minimal impact, prevents gaming the system).
    *   **Compliance with Federation Rules:**  Flags for violations of agreed-upon federation guidelines (e.g., spamming the network).
*   **Data Storage:**  A distributed, append-only ledger (similar to blockchain principles, but doesn’t require full decentralization) to ensure auditability and tamper-resistance.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:**  A weighted algorithm combining all data points. Weights are configurable by federation admins, allowing adaptation to evolving threats and priorities.

**2. Dynamic Permissioning Layer:**

*   **Trust Thresholds:** Define levels of trust required for different actions:
    *   **Basic Delivery:** Minimum trust level for message delivery.
    *   **Prioritized Delivery:** Higher trust = messages are prioritized in queues.
    *   **Feature Access:**  Access to advanced features (e.g., file sharing, group video calls) requires a higher trust level.
    *   **Content Filtering Override:**  Users with very high trust may have reduced content filtering (with appropriate warnings).
*   **Permission Propagation:** When a user on Network A communicates with a user on Network B, the system checks *both* network reputation *and* the individual user's trust score.  Permissions are granted based on the *lowest* score.
*   **Temporary Permissions:**  Grant temporary elevated permissions based on specific contexts (e.g., emergency communication).

**3.  Trust Score Propagation:**

*   **Partial Disclosure:** Networks do *not* share raw trust scores with each other. Instead, they share a “Trust Level” (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on the score.
*   **Reciprocal Trust:** Networks establish reciprocal trust relationships. If Network A trusts Network B, Network B is incentivized to trust Network A.
*   **Trust Decay:** Trust scores decay over time if activity is low.  This prevents stale scores from being exploited.

**4.  Moderation & Dispute Resolution:**

*   **Moderation Queue:**  Reported users are placed in a moderation queue for review.
*   **Dispute Resolution System:**  A mechanism for users to appeal trust score reductions or content filtering decisions.
*   **Federation Admin Oversight:**  Federation admins have the ability to override trust scores in exceptional circumstances.

**Pseudocode (Permission Check):**

```
function checkPermission(senderNetwork, senderUser, receiverNetwork, receiverUser) {

  senderNetworkTrust = getNetworkTrust(senderNetwork);
  senderUserTrust = getUserTrust(senderUser);
  receiverNetworkTrust = getNetworkTrust(receiverNetwork);
  receiverUserTrust = getUserTrust(receiverUser);

  combinedSenderTrust = min(senderNetworkTrust, senderUserTrust);
  combinedReceiverTrust = min(receiverNetworkTrust, receiverUserTrust);

  minimumRequiredTrust = calculateMinimumTrust(receiverUser); // based on receiver's preferences

  if (combinedSenderTrust >= minimumRequiredTrust && combinedReceiverTrust >= minimumRequiredTrust) {
    return true; // Permission granted
  } else {
    return false; // Permission denied
  }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Reputation-Based Monetization:**  Users with high trust scores could be offered premium features or rewards.
*   **Trust Score Visualization:**  Provide users with a clear visualization of their trust score and how it’s calculated.
*   **AI-Powered Trust Assessment:**  Use AI to analyze user behavior and predict potential risks.
