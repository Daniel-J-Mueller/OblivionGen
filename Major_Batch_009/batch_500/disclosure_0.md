## Adaptive Lockscreen Environments

**Concept:** Expand the lockscreen credential system to dynamically alter the device’s entire operating environment, not just launch an application. This extends the “limited access” concept to full system state control triggered by the credential.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core System – Environment Profiles:**

*   **Definition:**  The OS maintains a library of “Environment Profiles.” Each profile represents a specific system configuration, including permitted applications, available system resources (CPU, memory, network access), UI customizations, and active security policies.
*   **Profile Attributes:** Each profile includes:
    *   `ProfileID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `CredentialTrigger`: The alphanumeric code (or biometric signature) that activates the profile.
    *   `ApplicationWhitelist`: List of permitted applications. Empty list = no applications.
    *   `ResourceLimits`:  CPU %, Memory MB, Network Bandwidth Kbps.  Values of -1 indicate unlimited.
    *   `UILayout`:  Customizable UI elements (themes, widget positions, launcher icons).
    *   `SecurityPolicy`:  Restricted system functions (e.g., camera access, microphone access, location services).
*   **System Profiles:** Several pre-defined profiles exist:
    *   “Standard”: Full access. Uses default credentials.
    *   “Kiosk”:  Single whitelisted application. Limited UI elements.
    *   “Focus”:  Whitelists productivity apps.  Disables notifications from non-whitelisted applications.
    *   “Travel”:  Limited data usage, maps & navigation apps whitelisted.
    *   “Emergency”: Single app (Emergency dialer).  Overrides all other settings.

**2. Credential Processing:**

*   **Credential Input:** The lockscreen accepts alphanumeric codes or biometric data.
*   **Profile Matching:** The system iterates through the Environment Profiles.
*   If the entered credential matches a `CredentialTrigger`, the corresponding profile is loaded.
*   If no match is found, a standard “locked” state is maintained (requires full credentials).

**3. Dynamic Environment Loading:**

*   **OS Override:** Upon profile activation, the OS dynamically:
    *   Loads the whitelisted applications.
    *   Applies resource limits.
    *   Modifies the UI according to `UILayout`.
    *   Enforces the `SecurityPolicy`.
*   **Persistent State:** The profile state remains active until:
    *   The device is locked (requires new credentials).
    *   A system-level event triggers a reset to “Standard” profile.
    *   A scheduled timeout expires.

**4. Profile Management Interface:**

*   An administrative interface allows users to:
    *   Create new Environment Profiles.
    *   Edit existing profiles.
    *   Assign `CredentialTriggers`.
    *   Import/Export profiles.

**Pseudocode (Credential Processing):**

```
function processCredential(credential):
    for each profile in EnvironmentProfiles:
        if profile.CredentialTrigger == credential:
            loadProfile(profile)
            return
    displayStandardLockScreen() // No match
end function

function loadProfile(profile):
    // Disable all apps/services
    disableAll()

    // Apply Resource Limits
    setCPULimit(profile.ResourceLimits.CPU)
    setMemoryLimit(profile.ResourceLimits.Memory)
    setNetworkLimit(profile.ResourceLimits.Network)

    // Load Whitelisted Apps
    for each app in profile.ApplicationWhitelist:
        launchApp(app)

    // Apply UI Layout
    applyTheme(profile.UILayout.Theme)
    repositionWidgets(profile.UILayout.Widgets)

    // Apply Security Policy
    setCameraAccess(profile.SecurityPolicy.CameraAccess)
    setMicrophoneAccess(profile.SecurityPolicy.MicrophoneAccess)
    setLocationAccess(profile.SecurityPolicy.LocationAccess)

    // Transition to Profile State
    displayProfileUI()
end function
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Contextual Profiles:** Trigger profiles based on location, time of day, or network connection.
*   **Profile Chaining:**  Activate a sequence of profiles based on a single credential.
*   **AI-Driven Profile Generation:**  Use machine learning to automatically create profiles based on user behavior.
