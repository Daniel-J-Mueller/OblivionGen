## Dynamic Embedding Granularity for Multi-Modal Input

**Concept:** Expand the embedding generation beyond word or phrase level to encompass *event* or *action* level within textual and audio input, coupled with dynamic granularity adjustment based on context. The system will move beyond static embedding vectors associated with pre-defined text segments.

**Specification:**

**1. Event/Action Segmentation Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw text, ASR output, audio stream.
*   **Process:** Utilize a combination of Named Entity Recognition (NER), Verb Phrase identification, and Audio Event Detection (AED) to identify potential events or actions. AED uses acoustic modeling to detect sounds like 'door closing', 'car starting', 'speech burst', etc. NER/verb phrase detection extracts potential actions from text like 'book a flight', 'set a reminder', 'play music'.
*   **Output:** A time-aligned sequence of event/action candidates with confidence scores.

**2. Dynamic Granularity Controller:**

*   **Input:** Event/action candidates, original text/audio, current task context (from NLU).
*   **Process:** This module assesses the relevance of each candidate event/action to the current task. This is done via a learned scoring function that considers:
    *   **Semantic Similarity:**  Similarity between the event/action’s description and the task’s intent.
    *   **Temporal Proximity:**  How closely the event/action follows or precedes key phrases in the input.
    *   **Acoustic Salience:** (for audio events)  The loudness, clarity, and distinctiveness of the event in the audio stream.
*   **Output:**  A list of *selected* event/action segments, along with a 'granularity level' (e.g., ‘fine’, ‘medium’, ‘coarse’) indicating the desired embedding precision.  'Fine' granularity might isolate a single verb, while 'coarse' might combine an entire sentence.

**3. Adaptive Embedding Generator:**

*   **Input:** Selected event/action segments, granularity levels, ML Transformer.
*   **Process:**  
    *   The ML Transformer is modified to accept granularity level as an input parameter.
    *   For 'fine' granularity, the transformer processes the event/action segment as a standard input.
    *   For 'medium' and 'coarse' granularity, the input is processed with a form of *contextual windowing*. A sliding window expands around the event/action, incorporating surrounding text or audio.  The transformer then attends to the entire window, giving higher weight to the core event/action.
*   **Output:** A set of dynamic, context-aware embedding vectors, each corresponding to a selected event/action segment and its associated granularity level.

**4. Multi-Task Layer Integration:**

*   The MTL is modified to accept embedding vectors with associated granularity metadata. The MTL learns to interpret this metadata and adjust its processing accordingly. This allows the MTL to leverage the fine-grained and coarse-grained information effectively.



**Pseudocode (Adaptive Embedding Generator):**

```
function generate_embedding(segment, granularity):
  if granularity == "fine":
    embedding = ML_Transformer(segment)
  elif granularity == "medium":
    window = expand_window(segment, window_size)
    embedding = ML_Transformer(window) * attention_mask(window, segment)
  elif granularity == "coarse":
    window = expand_window(segment, large_window_size)
    embedding = ML_Transformer(window) * attention_mask(window, segment)
  return embedding
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond treating text as a linear sequence of words. It recognizes events and actions as discrete units of meaning and dynamically adjusts embedding granularity based on context.  This provides a richer and more nuanced representation of input, potentially improving performance on complex tasks like dialogue understanding, action recognition, and contextual search.
