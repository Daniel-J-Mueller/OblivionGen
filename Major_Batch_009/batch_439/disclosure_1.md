**Dynamic Reputation-Based Listing ‘Shielding’**

**Concept:** Expand the authority level weighting to encompass proactive ‘shielding’ of listings *before* reports are even filed. This anticipates potentially problematic listings based on merchant behavior and listing characteristics.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Proactive Risk Scoring:**
    *   Develop a risk score for each listing *immediately* upon creation. This score considers:
        *   Merchant history (sales volume, return rates, prior report resolutions).
        *   Listing keywords (flagging potentially infringing or misleading terms).
        *   Image analysis (detecting low-quality or potentially counterfeit images).
        *   Pricing anomalies (significant deviations from market price).
    *   Assign a baseline 'visibility' level to the listing based on the risk score. (e.g., High Visibility, Medium Visibility, Low Visibility).

2.  **Dynamic Shielding Levels:**
    *   **Low Visibility:** Listings with high-risk scores are initially displayed with reduced prominence (e.g., lower ranking in search results, muted thumbnails, delayed loading).  A small disclaimer might indicate “Listing under review.”
    *   **Medium Visibility:** Standard display.
    *   **High Visibility:** Listings with extremely low-risk scores (established merchants, consistent positive feedback) are boosted in search rankings and given preferential display treatment.

3.  **Reporting-Triggered Adjustment:**
    *   When a report is filed, the system *immediately* reduces the listing’s visibility.
    *   The severity of the visibility reduction is based on the initial risk score *and* the nature of the report (e.g., intellectual property infringement triggers a harsher penalty than a minor descriptive error).

4.  **Authority-Weighted Resolution Impact:**
    *   The resolution of a report (whether validated or dismissed) significantly impacts the merchant's future risk scores.
    *   If the report is validated, the merchant's authority level *decreases* dramatically.
    *   If the report is dismissed (and deemed malicious), the reporting merchant's authority level decreases.
    *   Authority-level *increases* are tied to consistently accurate reporting *and* demonstrated compliance with platform guidelines.

5.  **‘Transparency Shield’ for Merchants:**
    *   Provide merchants with a dashboard showing their risk score, factors contributing to the score, and suggestions for improving their standing.
    *   Allow merchants to appeal risk score assessments and provide supporting documentation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculateListingRiskScore(merchantHistory, listingKeywords, imageQuality, priceAnomaly):
  score = 0
  score += merchantHistoryWeight * merchantHistoryScore
  score += keywordWeight * keywordScore
  score += imageWeight * imageQualityScore
  score += priceWeight * priceAnomalyScore
  return score

function adjustListingVisibility(riskScore):
  if riskScore > highThreshold:
    visibility = "Low"
  else if riskScore > mediumThreshold:
    visibility = "Medium"
  else:
    visibility = "High"
  return visibility

function resolveReport(report, evaluationResults, authorityLevels):
  validated = determineValidation(evaluationResults, authorityLevels)
  if validated:
    demoteMerchantAuthority(reportingMerchant)
    promoteMerchantAuthority(reportedMerchant)
  else:
    demoteMerchantAuthority(reportingMerchant)
  updateRiskScores(reportedMerchant, validationResult)
  adjustListingVisibility(reportedMerchant)
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond *reactive* report management to a *proactive* system that anticipates and mitigates risk *before* it escalates, creating a safer and more trustworthy marketplace. The ‘Transparency Shield’ fosters accountability and encourages compliance.
