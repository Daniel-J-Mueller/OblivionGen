## Predictive Neighbor Notification System

**Concept:** Extend the sharing functionality to incorporate predictive alerts based on shared footage analysis. Instead of solely reacting to shared events, proactively notify neighbors of *potential* issues based on learned patterns.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Input:** Video footage from A/V devices (as per the provided patent) *plus* historical incident reports (police blotters, neighborhood watch data - anonymized).
*   **AI Core:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of:
    *   Visual events (people, vehicles, animals, objects).
    *   Incident types (theft, vandalism, suspicious behavior - tagged from historical reports).
    *   Time-of-day, weather conditions, and location data.
*   **Neighborhood Profile Creation:** Each A/V device’s location is associated with a ‘neighborhood profile’ built from aggregated data (visual events, incidents, user-reported issues).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** The AI core analyzes incoming footage and compares it to the neighborhood profile.  Deviations trigger a risk score.
*   **Predictive Alerting:** If the risk score exceeds a predefined threshold, a *predictive alert* is generated *before* an incident occurs.
*   **Alert Customization:** Users can adjust alert sensitivity (high, medium, low) and specify types of events they want to be alerted about (e.g., “unfamiliar vehicles near my property”, “people loitering after dark”).
*   **Alert Delivery:**  Alerts are delivered via a mobile app with:
    *   A short video clip highlighting the potential issue.
    *   A risk score indicating the likelihood of an incident.
    *   An option to view live footage from the triggering A/V device.
    *   A button to report the activity to local authorities.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION analyzeFootage(footage, location):
    neighborhoodProfile = getNeighborhoodProfile(location)
    features = extractFeaturesFromFootage(footage)
    riskScore = calculateRiskScore(features, neighborhoodProfile)

    IF riskScore > threshold:
        generatePredictiveAlert(footage, riskScore, location)
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateRiskScore(features, neighborhoodProfile):
    // Weighted sum of feature deviations from neighborhood norms
    score = 0
    FOR feature IN features:
        deviation = ABS(feature - neighborhoodProfile.getFeature(feature))
        weight = getFeatureWeight(feature) // Assign higher weights to critical features
        score += deviation * weight
    ENDFOR
    RETURN score
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION getFeatureWeight(feature):
  //Example weights
  IF feature == "unfamiliar vehicle":
    RETURN 0.7
  ELSE IF feature == "person loitering":
    RETURN 0.6
  ELSE:
    RETURN 0.2
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing A/V devices (compatible with the system).
*   Edge computing devices (optional, for faster analysis).
*   Cloud infrastructure (for data storage, AI model training, and alert delivery).

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with smart home security systems.
*   Real-time crime mapping.
*   Community-based threat assessment.
