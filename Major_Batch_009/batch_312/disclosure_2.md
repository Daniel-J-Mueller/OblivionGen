## Dynamic Data Masking with Generative AI

**Specification:** A system for real-time data masking leveraging generative AI models to create plausible, but non-sensitive, data replacements within natural language question answering (NLQ) systems. This expands upon the row-level security concept by adding *column*-level and *cell*-level dynamic masking tailored to both user classification *and* the specific question being asked.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Sensitivity Profile:** Each column in the dataset is assigned a sensitivity profile (High, Medium, Low, None). This profile dictates the masking strategy.
2.  **Generative Masking Models:** Pre-trained or fine-tuned generative AI models (e.g., GPT-3, T5, diffusion models) are associated with each sensitive column type (e.g., name, address, financial data).
3.  **NLQ Analysis Module:** Parses the incoming natural language question to identify the columns being referenced.
4.  **Contextual Masking Engine:**  This engine is the core of the system. It combines user classification (from the existing RLS system), the identified columns in the NLQ, and the column's sensitivity profile to determine the masking strategy.
5.  **Dynamic Data Replacement:**  For sensitive columns, the system replaces the actual data with AI-generated plausible replacements *in real-time*, before returning the results to the user.

**Workflow:**

1.  User submits a natural language question.
2.  The NLQ Analysis Module identifies the columns referenced in the query.
3.  The system determines the user's classification (from the existing RLS system).
4.  For each identified column:
    *   If the column has a “None” sensitivity profile, no masking is applied.
    *   If the column has a “Low” sensitivity profile, basic anonymization techniques are applied (e.g., pseudonymization, generalization).
    *   If the column has a “Medium” or “High” sensitivity profile:
        *   The Contextual Masking Engine selects the appropriate generative AI model.
        *   The AI model generates a plausible replacement value based on:
            *   The column's data type and distribution.
            *   The *context* of the NLQ (e.g., generating a plausible address for a query about 'customers in California').
            *   The user's classification (e.g., generating different data for a marketing analyst versus a data scientist).
        *   The actual value is replaced with the generated replacement.
5.  The system returns the masked results to the user.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Masking Engine):**

```
function mask_data(user_classification, nlq, column_name, original_value, sensitivity_profile):
  if sensitivity_profile == "None":
    return original_value

  if sensitivity_profile == "Low":
    # Apply basic anonymization (pseudonymization, generalization)
    return anonymize(original_value)

  if sensitivity_profile == "Medium" or "High":
    model = get_generative_model(column_name)
    context = extract_context_from_nlq(nlq)
    user_profile = get_user_profile(user_classification)

    # Generate replacement value using generative model, context, and user profile
    replacement_value = generate_value(model, original_value, context, user_profile)
    return replacement_value
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Caching: Cache frequently generated replacement values to reduce latency.
*   Model Optimization: Utilize optimized generative models for faster inference.
*   Distributed Processing: Distribute the masking workload across multiple servers.
*   Sharding: Shard the data based on sensitivity profile to improve performance.
