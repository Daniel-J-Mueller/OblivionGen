## Secure Peripheral Authentication & Dynamic Capability Delegation

**Concept:** Expand beyond static command authorization to a system where peripheral authentication not only *grants* access, but dynamically delegates specific computational capabilities to the host device. This moves beyond simply allowing/disallowing commands to *allowing the peripheral to offload processing to the host, securely*.

**Specs:**

**1. Peripheral Hardware:**

*   **Secure Element (SE):**  Standard secure element with asymmetric key storage and cryptographic acceleration.
*   **Capability Descriptor:**  A digitally signed data structure stored on the peripheral. This defines a set of *computational functions* the peripheral can perform, alongside resource limits (memory, CPU cycles) the peripheral can request from the host.  Examples: "Image Filtering – Gaussian Blur", "Encryption – AES-256", "Data Compression – LZ4".  Includes versioning for updates.
*   **Minimal Interface:** USB-C data interface. Limited to authentication and capability negotiation.

**2. Host System Requirements:**

*   **Secure Boot:** Mandatory. Protects against compromised host OS.
*   **Capability Broker:**  A kernel-level module responsible for:
    *   Authenticating the peripheral.
    *   Parsing the Capability Descriptor.
    *   Allocating resources based on descriptor limits.
    *   Creating secure sandboxes (e.g., using virtualization or containers) for executing peripheral-delegated code.
    *   Monitoring resource usage and enforcing limits.
*   **Remote Attestation Support:**  Needed to verify the integrity of the Capability Broker itself.

**3. Authentication & Delegation Flow:**

1.  Peripheral connects.
2.  Host detects peripheral and initiates authentication sequence (as in provided patent, using digital signatures and nonces).
3.  Upon successful authentication, peripheral transmits Capability Descriptor.
4.  Capability Broker parses Descriptor and validates requested capabilities.
5.  Broker allocates a secure sandbox with the specified resource limits.
6.  Broker establishes a secure communication channel with the peripheral.
7.  Peripheral *transmits code segments* or requests specific computations to be performed within the sandbox.  The code segments are small, well-defined functions (e.g., a kernel for a specific image filter).
8.  The host executes the code within the sandbox and returns the results to the peripheral.
9.  Broker monitors all activity within the sandbox, ensuring no resource limits are exceeded and no unauthorized actions are taken.
10. Upon completion, sandbox is destroyed.

**Pseudocode (Capability Broker - Resource Allocation):**

```
function allocateSandbox(capabilityDescriptor) {
  if (capabilityDescriptor.memoryLimit > MAX_MEMORY) {
    log("Error: Memory limit exceeds maximum allowed.");
    return null;
  }

  if (capabilityDescriptor.cpuCycles > MAX_CPU_CYCLES) {
    log("Error: CPU cycle limit exceeds maximum allowed.");
    return null;
  }

  sandbox = new Sandbox(capabilityDescriptor.memoryLimit, capabilityDescriptor.cpuCycles);
  sandbox.permissions = capabilityDescriptor.permissions; // Read/Write access to specific data
  return sandbox;
}

function executeDelegateCode(sandbox, codeSegment) {
  // Code integrity check (hash verification)
  if (!verifyCodeIntegrity(codeSegment)) {
    log("Error: Code integrity check failed.");
    return null;
  }

  result = sandbox.execute(codeSegment);
  return result;
}
```

**Novelty:**

The core innovation is moving *beyond* simple command authorization. This system allows the peripheral to delegate *computational work* to the host, effectively turning the host into a remote processor for the peripheral. This opens possibilities for complex peripheral functionality without requiring expensive on-device processing power. The secure sandbox ensures the host remains protected from malicious or poorly written peripheral code. It’s a move away from 'what can I *ask* the host to do', to 'what parts of my processing can I *move* to the host'?
