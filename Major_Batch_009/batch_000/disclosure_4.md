## Dynamic Message Prioritization & Adaptive Buffer Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the shared memory messaging system to incorporate a dynamic prioritization scheme *and* adaptive buffer allocation, based on real-time message content analysis. This aims to minimize latency for critical messages and optimize resource utilization.

**Specification:**

**1. Message Content Analysis Module (MCAM):**

*   **Function:**  Integrated within the first computer process (the message writer).
*   **Process:**  MCAM analyzes the content of each message *before* writing it to shared memory.  Analysis includes:
    *   **Keyword Detection:** Predefined keywords indicate message criticality (e.g., "emergency," "critical alert," "immediate action").
    *   **Data Type Identification:** Distinguishes between different data types (e.g., sensor readings, control commands, status updates).  Certain data types may inherently be more time-sensitive.
    *   **Content-Based Urgency Estimation:** Employ a simple machine learning model (trained offline) to estimate message urgency based on content features.  Model could be a basic classifier (urgent/not urgent) or a regression model predicting a priority score.
*   **Output:**  Each message is tagged with:
    *   `priority_score`: A numerical value representing message urgency.
    *   `data_type`:  A categorization of the message's content.

**2. Adaptive Buffer Allocation & Management:**

*   **Shared Memory Structure:**  Beyond fixed-size buffers, a *dynamic buffer pool* is created within shared memory.
*   **Buffer Request Process:** When the first process needs to write a message:
    1.  It calculates the required buffer size based on the message content.
    2.  It requests a buffer from the dynamic buffer pool, *specifying* the `priority_score` and `data_type`.
    3.  The buffer manager allocates a buffer from the pool.  Buffers are allocated with a metadata header containing:
        *   `priority_score`
        *   `data_type`
        *   `buffer_size`
        *   `sequence_number`
*   **Buffer Pool Management:**
    *   The buffer pool is divided into priority tiers (e.g., high, medium, low).
    *   Buffers are assigned to tiers based on the `priority_score` of the messages they contain.
    *   A garbage collection mechanism reclaims unused buffers, returning them to the pool.  Priority is given to reclaiming lower-priority buffers.

**3. Second Process (Reader) Enhancements:**

*   **Priority-Based Reading:** The reader process scans the shared memory, prioritizing buffers based on `priority_score`.  Buffers with higher scores are read first.
*   **Data-Type Specific Processing:** The reader routes messages to different processing threads based on the `data_type`. This enables parallel processing and optimized handling of different message types.
*   **Adaptive Read Rate:** The reader monitors the number of messages in each priority tier. If a tier is filling up, the reader increases its read rate for that tier to prevent buffer overflows.

**Pseudocode (Reader Process):**

```
while (true) {
  // Scan shared memory for available buffers
  for (each buffer in shared_memory) {
    if (buffer.is_available()) {
      // Prioritize by priority_score
      if (buffer.priority_score > threshold_high) {
        process_high_priority_message(buffer);
      } else if (buffer.priority_score > threshold_medium) {
        process_medium_priority_message(buffer);
      } else {
        process_low_priority_message(buffer);
      }
    }
  }
  // Adaptive read rate adjustment (based on buffer queue lengths)
  adjust_read_rate();
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency for critical messages.
*   Optimized resource utilization.
*   Improved system responsiveness.
*   Enhanced scalability.
*   Allows for graceful degradation under heavy load.
