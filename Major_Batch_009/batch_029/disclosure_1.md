## Dynamic Quantum Circuit Compilation & Resource Allocation

**Concept:** The patent describes accessing quantum resources. This inspires a system that doesn't just *access* those resources, but intelligently *compiles* and *allocates* quantum circuits *during* runtime, based on real-time resource availability and circuit optimization potential. It moves beyond pre-programmed algorithms to dynamically adapting to hardware constraints.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Quantum Circuit Compiler (QCC):**
    *   Input: High-level quantum algorithm description (e.g., OpenQASM, Qiskit code)
    *   Processing:
        *   Circuit decomposition & optimization: Breaks down complex operations into native gate sets of available quantum hardware.
        *   Dynamic gate scheduling: Orders gate execution to minimize wait times & maximize throughput.
        *   Error mitigation strategies: Implements techniques like dynamical decoupling or zero-noise extrapolation based on detected noise characteristics of the target hardware.
        *   Resource estimation:  Estimates qubit count, gate depth, and coherence time requirements.
    *   Output: Compiled quantum circuit optimized for the selected quantum hardware, along with resource usage profile.

*   **Component 2: Resource Broker (RB):**
    *   Input: Resource request from QCC (qubit count, gate types, coherence time).  Real-time hardware availability data from Quantum Hardware Management System (QHMS).  Cost/performance metrics for each available resource.
    *   Processing:
        *   Resource matching: Identifies available quantum resources that meet the request.
        *   Bid/Allocation: Implements a bidding system where different quantum resources compete to execute the circuit. The resource with the optimal cost/performance ratio is selected.
        *   Circuit Mapping: Maps logical qubits to physical qubits on the selected hardware.  Optimizes qubit placement to minimize communication overhead.
        *   Scheduling: Allocates execution time on the selected resource.
    *   Output: Resource allocation confirmation and execution schedule.

*   **Component 3: Quantum Hardware Management System (QHMS):**
    *   Function: Monitors the status and performance of all available quantum resources (qubit coherence times, gate fidelities, connectivity, etc.).
    *   Output: Real-time hardware status updates to the Resource Broker.

**Pseudocode (Resource Broker â€“ Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
function allocateResource(request):
  availableResources = QHMS.getAvailableResources(request.qubitCount, request.gateTypes)
  
  if availableResources is empty:
    return "No resources available"

  bids = []
  for resource in availableResources:
    cost = resource.computeExecutionCost(request.circuitDepth)
    performance = resource.estimateCircuitSuccessProbability(request.circuitDepth)
    bid = cost / performance
    bids.append((resource, bid))

  bestResource = min(bids, key=lambda x: x[1])  // Select resource with lowest bid

  allocation = bestResource[0].allocate(request.circuitDepth)
  
  return allocation
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond static resource selection. The dynamic compilation and bidding system allow for optimized resource usage, potentially enabling execution of algorithms on smaller, more readily available hardware, or accelerating execution by choosing the *best* resource at a given time. It introduces an economic element to quantum computing resource allocation.
