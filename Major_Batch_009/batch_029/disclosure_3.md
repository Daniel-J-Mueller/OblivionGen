## Dynamic Centroid Weighting for Temporal Data Streams

**Concept:** Extend centroid-based clustering to handle continuous data streams where data points arrive sequentially. Introduce a weighting system for centroids based on their "age" and recent relevance, effectively allowing the clustering to adapt to changing data distributions *without* constant re-computation from scratch.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Initial Clustering:**
   *   Input: Continuous stream of multi-dimensional data points (e.g., sensor readings, stock prices).
   *   Initial Phase: Perform a standard k-means (or similar) clustering on a buffer of the *first N* data points to establish initial centroids.  N is a configurable parameter.
   *   Data Structure: Maintain a list of `Centroid` objects. Each `Centroid` has attributes: `location` (vector), `weight`, `last_updated_timestamp`, `member_count`.

**2. Data Point Assignment & Centroid Update:**
   *   For each incoming data point:
      *   Calculate distance to each centroid.
      *   Assign the data point to the closest centroid.
      *   Update `member_count` for the assigned centroid.
      *   Update `last_updated_timestamp` for the assigned centroid to the current timestamp.

**3. Dynamic Weighting:**
   *   Every *T* time units (configurable), recalculate centroid weights.
   *   Weight Calculation:
      *   **Age Factor:** `age_weight = exp(-lambda * (current_timestamp - last_updated_timestamp))` where `lambda` is a configurable decay rate.  Higher lambda means faster decay of older centroids.
      *   **Relevance Factor:** `relevance_weight = member_count / total_data_points_processed`.  This penalizes centroids with few recent members.
      *   **Final Weight:** `centroid_weight = age_weight * relevance_weight`.
   *   Normalize all centroid weights so they sum to 1.

**4. Adaptive Centroid Adjustment:**
   *   After weight recalculation:
      *   Calculate a "weighted centroid location" by taking a weighted average of all data points assigned to each centroid, using the centroid's normalized weight.  This effectively "pulls" the centroids towards recent, relevant data.
      *   Implement a "momentum" factor to prevent wild oscillations in centroid location.  `new_location = (1 - momentum) * weighted_location + momentum * old_location`. `momentum` is a configurable parameter (0 < momentum < 1).
      *   Periodically (every M time units, configurable), remove centroids with very low weights (below a threshold) to allow the clustering to adapt to changes in the data distribution.

**5. Splitting and Merging Centroids:**
   *   If a centroid's `member_count` exceeds a threshold, split it into two centroids by adding small random displacement to the centroid's location.
   *   If two centroids are within a certain distance of each other for a defined period, merge them into a single centroid.

**Pseudocode (Core Update Loop):**

```pseudocode
function update_clustering(data_point):
  closest_centroid = find_closest_centroid(data_point, centroids)
  assign_data_point_to_centroid(data_point, closest_centroid)
  update_centroid_timestamp(closest_centroid)

  if current_timestamp % T == 0:
    recalculate_centroid_weights(centroids, T, lambda)
    update_centroid_locations(centroids, momentum)
    remove_low_weight_centroids(centroids, threshold)

    if random() < split_probability:
      split_centroid(centroids)

    for each pair of centroids:
      if distance(centroid1, centroid2) < merge_distance:
        merge_centroids(centroid1, centroid2)

```

**Configurable Parameters:**

*   `N`: Initial buffer size.
*   `T`: Weight recalculation interval.
*   `lambda`: Decay rate for age factor.
*   `momentum`: Momentum factor for centroid location update.
*   `threshold`: Minimum weight for centroid retention.
*   `merge_distance`: Distance threshold for centroid merging.
*   `split_probability`: Probability of splitting a centroid.
