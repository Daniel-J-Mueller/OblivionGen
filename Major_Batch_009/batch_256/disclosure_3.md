## Adaptive Haptic Notification System – “SenseScape”

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond visual and auditory interruption models to incorporate localized haptic feedback delivered via wearable devices (smartwatches, bands, clothing) synchronized with content metadata, creating a multi-sensory interruption experience.

**System Components:**

1.  **Content Metadata Enrichment:** Extend metadata tagging to include 'Haptic Profile' data. This profile defines:
    *   **Haptic Intensity:** (0-100) – Overall strength of haptic feedback.
    *   **Haptic Pattern:** (Predefined library or customizable) - Vibration sequences, textures, or pulsations. Examples: gentle pulse for email, rapid taps for urgent message, rising wave for calendar event.
    *   **Haptic Localization:** Specifies which part of the wearable/body should receive the feedback (e.g., wrist, upper arm, back).
    *   **Haptic Duration:** Length of the haptic event.
    *   **Haptic Context:** (Optional) – A short descriptor of the event type for AI adaptation (e.g. 'social notification', 'calendar reminder', 'critical alert').

2.  **Wearable Integration:** A software development kit (SDK) allowing seamless integration with a wide range of wearable devices. The SDK will handle:
    *   Device discovery and connection.
    *   Haptic command translation – mapping of ‘Haptic Profile’ data to device-specific commands.
    *   Power management optimization.

3.  **AI-Powered Haptic Adaptation Engine:** A machine learning model running on the central processing unit.
    *   **User Preference Learning:** Observes user responses to haptic notifications (e.g., acknowledging, dismissing, ignoring) and adjusts ‘Haptic Profile’ parameters to maximize effectiveness and minimize disruption.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrates data from device sensors (location, activity, ambient sound) to dynamically modify haptic feedback. Example: reduce intensity during a meeting, increase during physical activity.
    *   **Content Prioritization:**  Ranks incoming notifications based on urgency and relevance and adjusts haptic feedback accordingly.
    *   **‘Haptic Blending’:**  Combines multiple notifications into a single, complex haptic pattern, allowing users to differentiate between multiple alerts.

**Pseudocode (AI Adaptation Engine):**

```
function AdaptHapticFeedback(incomingNotification, userProfile, sensorData):
    hapticProfile = incomingNotification.hapticProfile
    
    // Adjust intensity based on user preferences
    hapticProfile.intensity = userProfile.preferredIntensity * hapticProfile.intensity
    
    // Adjust based on context
    if sensorData.activity == "meeting":
        hapticProfile.intensity *= 0.5  //Reduce during meetings
    elif sensorData.ambientSound > 70dB:
        hapticProfile.intensity *= 1.2 // Increase in noisy environments
        
    // Prioritization (example)
    if incomingNotification.priority == "critical":
        hapticProfile.duration *= 2
        hapticProfile.pattern = "urgent_pulse"
        
    // Send to wearable (using wearable SDK)
    wearableSDK.transmitHapticFeedback(hapticProfile)
    
    // Log user response (acknowledged, dismissed, ignored) for learning
    logUserResponse(incomingNotification, userResponse)
    
    return
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Multi-sensory interruption:** Moves beyond visual/auditory to leverage haptic feedback.
*   **Personalized Haptic Profiles:** Allows for customized interruption experiences.
*   **AI-Driven Adaptation:** Learns user preferences and optimizes haptic feedback in real-time.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Adapts to the user’s environment and activity level.
*   **'Haptic Blending'**: Creates richer, more informative haptic notifications.
