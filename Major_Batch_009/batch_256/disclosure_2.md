## Acoustic Scene Composition with Generative Spatial Audio

**Concept:** Expand upon multi-channel audio processing by *composing* acoustic scenes dynamically, layering generative spatial audio elements onto real-world recordings. This goes beyond simple speech enhancement to create augmented auditory experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:**  A 'Scene Composer' module, operating in parallel with the existing DNN acoustic processing pipeline.
*   **Input:**  Multi-channel audio data (from the device microphones), metadata (location, time of day, user profile).
*   **Generative Engine:**  A library of parameterized sound events (footsteps, traffic, birdsong, music fragments, etc.) represented as procedural audio or short audio samples.  These are triggered and modulated by the Scene Composer.  Employ diffusion models to generate novel sound events based on high-level descriptions.
*   **Spatialization Engine:** A binaural/Ambisonic spatial audio renderer. Supports Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) personalized to the user, and dynamic object-based spatial audio.
*   **DNN Integration:** The output of the DNN (feature vectors) is used as *control signals* for the Scene Composer. For example:
    *   Dominant speech frequencies modulate music genre selection.
    *   Detected environmental sounds (e.g., car noise) trigger relevant sound event augmentation (additional traffic layers).
    *   The DNN’s confidence score regarding speech presence controls the level of augmentation - more augmentation when speech is unclear.
*   **Output:** A mixed audio stream – the original multi-channel audio *plus* the generated and spatialized audio elements.

**Pseudocode (Scene Composer):**

```
function ComposeScene(multiChannelAudio, featureVectors, metadata) {
  // 1. Analyze Feature Vectors & Metadata
  environmentType = AnalyzeEnvironment(featureVectors); // e.g., "street", "office", "park"
  speechClarity = GetSpeechClarity(featureVectors);
  userPreferences = LoadUserPreferences(metadata);

  // 2. Select Sound Events based on Analysis
  eventList = SelectEvents(environmentType, userPreferences); // Returns list of sound events

  // 3.  Generate and Modulate Sound Events
  for each event in eventList {
      if (event.type == "procedural") {
          event.parameters = GenerateParameters(speechClarity); //Modulate parameters based on speech clarity
          event.audio = GenerateAudio(event.parameters);
      } else if (event.type == "diffusion") {
          prompt = CreatePrompt(environmentType, userPreferences) //e.g., "gentle stream flowing"
          event.audio = GenerateDiffusionAudio(prompt)
      } else {
          event.audio = LoadSample(event.filename)
      }

      // 4. Spatialization
      event.position = CalculatePosition(event.type, metadata); // Based on perceived direction and distance
      event.spatializedAudio = Spatializer.render(event.audio, event.position, HRTF)
  }

  // 5. Mix Audio
  mixedAudio = Mixer.mix(multiChannelAudio, spatializedAudio)
  return mixedAudio
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Enhanced Communication:** Make a voice clearer in noisy environments by intelligently layering in complementary audio (e.g., subtle white noise masking, reverb simulation).
*   **Immersive AR/VR Experiences:** Dynamically augment the soundscape of virtual or augmented environments based on real-world audio input.
*   **Accessibility:** Generate auditory cues for visually impaired users, providing information about the surrounding environment.
*   **Creative Audio Applications:**  Allow users to “remix” their environment in real-time, adding or subtracting sound elements.
