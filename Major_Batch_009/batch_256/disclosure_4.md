## Dynamic Traffic Sharding & Predictive Routing

**Specification:** A system for proactively partitioning network traffic streams based on predicted network conditions and dynamically routing shards to geographically diverse processing clusters. This expands on the existing ‘rerouting’ concept by shifting from reactive mitigation to *proactive* segmentation.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Traffic Profiler:**
    *   Continuously monitors traffic patterns (volume, packet size, protocol, source/destination).
    *   Uses machine learning models (time series forecasting, anomaly detection) to predict potential network congestion or degradation *before* it occurs.  Models trained on historical data *and* real-time telemetry from network infrastructure.
    *   Generates ‘risk scores’ for different traffic streams.

2.  **Shard Manager:**
    *   Based on risk scores and pre-defined policies, divides traffic streams into multiple ‘shards.’
    *   Shard size dynamically adjusted based on predicted impact of adverse conditions.  (e.g., high-risk stream gets smaller shards)
    *   Each shard assigned a unique identifier and routing priority.
    *   Policy examples: Prioritize shards containing critical data, distribute shards across multiple geographical regions, or limit shard size to prevent overload.

3.  **Predictive Router:**
    *   Maintains a global view of network infrastructure health (latency, bandwidth, error rates) across multiple regions.
    *   Uses predictive modeling (based on network telemetry and historical data) to forecast network performance in different regions.
    *   Dynamically routes shards to regions predicted to have optimal performance.
    *   Utilizes a cost function incorporating latency, bandwidth, and processing capacity.
    *   Supports multi-path routing to maximize redundancy and throughput.

4.  **Geo-Distributed Processing Clusters:**
    *   Multiple processing clusters geographically distributed.
    *   Each cluster equipped with resources to process assigned shards.
    *   Clusters communicate with each other to share load and maintain data consistency.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Traffic Profiler
function analyzeTraffic(trafficStream) {
  data = collectTelemetry(trafficStream);
  riskScore = predictRisk(data);
  return riskScore;
}

//Shard Manager
function createShards(trafficStream, riskScore) {
  shardSize = calculateShardSize(riskScore);
  shards = splitTraffic(trafficStream, shardSize);
  for (shard in shards) {
    shard.id = generateShardID();
    shard.priority = determinePriority(riskScore);
  }
  return shards;
}

//Predictive Router
function routeShards(shards) {
  for (shard in shards) {
    bestRegion = predictBestRegion(shard.priority);
    sendShard(shard, bestRegion);
  }
}

function predictBestRegion(priority) {
  regionData = collectRegionTelemetry();
  predictedPerformance = calculatePerformance(regionData);
  bestRegion = selectRegion(predictedPerformance, priority);
  return bestRegion;
}
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simple rerouting *after* a problem occurs. This system *anticipates* network issues and proactively fragments traffic, distributing it across regions *before* congestion impacts users.  The use of predictive modeling for both risk assessment *and* region selection is a key differentiator. Furthermore, dynamic shard sizing and priority assignment allow for fine-grained control over traffic management. This addresses a limitation of the reference patent which reacts to conditions rather than anticipates them.
