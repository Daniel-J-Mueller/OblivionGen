## Dynamic Authentication ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Triggering

**System Overview:**

This system extends the concept of multifactor authentication triggering based on deviations from established behavioral/environmental baselines. Instead of *reacting* to exceeding thresholds, this system *predicts* potential anomalous activity based on ‘shadowing’ – creating a parallel, short-term baseline *during* a session – and proactively requesting authentication *before* a deviation is even confirmed. This adds a layer of preemptive security.

**Components:**

1.  **Real-Time Session Profiler (RTSP):** Continuously builds a short-term profile (e.g., 5-15 seconds) of metrics *during* the current session. Metrics mirror those used in the historical baseline (rendering speed, clickstream, noise levels, etc.). This short-term profile adapts to immediate user behavior and environmental changes.

2.  **Deviation Projector (DP):** This module constantly projects potential deviations based on the rate of change observed in the RTSP. It utilizes time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to forecast metric values for the *next* short interval.  A 'deviation score' is calculated based on the projected values and the established historical thresholds.

3.  **Predictive Authentication Engine (PAE):** Monitors the deviation score. If the projected deviation score *exceeds a pre-defined ‘prediction threshold’* (lower than the reactive threshold used in the original patent), the PAE initiates a multifactor authentication request.  The prediction threshold is tunable to balance security and user experience.

4.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA):**  The DTA module adjusts the prediction threshold *during* the session. If the user consistently operates *near* the prediction threshold (frequent authentication requests), the DTA *slightly* increases the prediction threshold. Conversely, if the user operates *well below* the threshold, the DTA *slightly* decreases it. This allows the system to adapt to user behavior *during* the session, minimizing false positives.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
historical_profile = load_historical_profile(user_id)
prediction_threshold = initial_prediction_threshold //Tunable Parameter

// Session Start
while (session_active) {
  // 1. Capture Real-Time Metrics
  realtime_metrics = capture_session_metrics()

  // 2. Build Short-Term Profile
  shortterm_profile = build_profile(realtime_metrics)

  // 3. Project Potential Deviation
  projected_metrics = project_metrics(shortterm_profile, historical_profile)
  deviation_score = calculate_deviation_score(projected_metrics, historical_profile)

  // 4. Authentication Decision
  if (deviation_score > prediction_threshold) {
    request_multifactor_authentication()
  }

  // 5. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment
  if (deviation_score frequently near prediction_threshold){
    prediction_threshold = prediction_threshold + small_increment
  } else if (deviation_score consistently low){
    prediction_threshold = prediction_threshold - small_increment
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Historical Profile:** Stores aggregated metrics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) for each user/device combination.
*   **Short-Term Profile:** Stores metrics captured during the current session (rolling window).
*   **Deviation Score:** A numerical value representing the predicted deviation from the historical baseline.

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   **Computational Cost:** Time series analysis and prediction can be computationally expensive.  Optimization is critical.  Consider using lightweight algorithms or hardware acceleration.
*   **Data Privacy:** Ensure data is collected and processed in compliance with privacy regulations.
*   **Tunable Parameters:** The initial prediction threshold and the adjustment increment must be carefully tuned to balance security and user experience. A/B testing is recommended.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent sessions.
