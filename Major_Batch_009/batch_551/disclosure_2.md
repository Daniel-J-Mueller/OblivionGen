## Dynamic Interest Graph Projection

**Concept:** Extend user matching beyond item affinities to model *evolving* interest spaces, and project those spaces onto geographical locations to facilitate real-world connections and experiences.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

1.  **Multi-Source Event Data:** Collect event data beyond the catalog as described in the base patent. Include:
    *   Social media activity (public posts, shares, likes – user consent required).
    *   Location data (opt-in GPS, WiFi positioning – anonymized/aggregated options).
    *   News consumption (articles read, topics followed).
    *   Event attendance (concerts, workshops, meetups).
2.  **Interest Vector Creation:** For each user, construct a dynamic interest vector. This is a weighted representation of their interests, updated continuously.
    *   Weights adjusted based on event frequency, recency, and ‘strength’ (e.g., rating a movie vs. passively viewing a thumbnail).
    *   Utilize embedding models (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) to represent interests as high-dimensional vectors, capturing semantic relationships.
3.  **Temporal Decay:** Implement temporal decay functions to reduce the influence of outdated interests.

**II. Interest Graph Construction & Projection:**

1.  **Interest Graph:** Create a graph where:
    *   Nodes represent interests (e.g., "Sci-Fi Movies", "Vegan Cooking", "Hiking").
    *   Edges represent relationships between interests (e.g., "Sci-Fi Movies" is related to "Space Exploration"). Edge weights represent the strength of the relationship.  Relationships can be derived from co-occurrence in user profiles, knowledge graphs (DBpedia, Wikidata), and external APIs.
2.  **Geographical Projection:**
    *   For each interest node, identify geographical ‘hotspots’ – locations where a high concentration of users express that interest. This can be calculated using spatial statistics (kernel density estimation).
    *   Assign a geographical ‘centroid’ to each interest hotspot.
3.  **User-Interest-Location Mapping:** For each user:
    *   Determine their dominant interests (based on interest vector).
    *   Map those interests to their corresponding geographical centroids.
    *   Create a ‘personal interest map’ – a set of geographical locations representing their interests.

**III. Matching & Recommendation:**

1.  **Proximity-Based Matching:** Identify users with overlapping personal interest maps. Proximity can be calculated using geographical distance or network distance (number of hops between interest centroids).
2.  **Dynamic Interest Alignment:**
    *   Beyond simple overlap, consider the *evolution* of interests. Match users whose interests are *converging* (moving closer in the interest vector space).
    *   Implement a ‘serendipity factor’ – intentionally recommend users with *slightly* different interests to encourage exploration.
3.  **Experience Recommendation:**
    *   Recommend real-world experiences (events, meetups, workshops) that align with the user's interests and are located near their personal interest map.
    *   Facilitate group formation around shared interests and experiences.

**Pseudocode (Matching):**

```
function matchUsers(user1, user2):
    interestVector1 = getUserInterestVector(user1)
    interestVector2 = getUserInterestVector(user2)

    // Calculate cosine similarity between interest vectors
    similarityScore = cosineSimilarity(interestVector1, interestVector2)

    // Calculate convergence rate (how quickly interests are aligning)
    convergenceRate = calculateConvergenceRate(user1, user2)

    // Calculate geographical proximity
    geographicalProximity = calculateGeographicalProximity(user1, user2)

    // Combine scores with weighted sum
    finalScore = (0.5 * similarityScore) + (0.3 * convergenceRate) + (0.2 * geographicalProximity)

    return finalScore
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Scalability is critical. Utilize distributed computing frameworks (Spark, Hadoop) to process large datasets.
*   Privacy is paramount. Anonymize user data and obtain explicit consent for location tracking.
*   Machine learning models should be continuously retrained to improve accuracy and adapt to changing user preferences.
*   The system should be designed to handle noisy and incomplete data.
