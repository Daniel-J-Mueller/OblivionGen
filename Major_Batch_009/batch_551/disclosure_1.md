## Device-Agnostic Intent Persistence & Cross-Device Handoff

**Concept:** Extend the accountless control system to allow for persistent user intent across *any* connected device, not just smart home devices initially paired with voice control. This moves beyond simple voice command translation to active state replication.

**Specification:**

**1. Intent Capture Module (ICM):**

*   **Function:** Captures user intent expressed through *any* input method (voice, touch, gesture, proximity) on *any* connected device.
*   **Data Structure:** `IntentPayload = { deviceID: String, timestamp: Int, intentType: Enum (e.g., "play", "pause", "dim", "setTemperature"), intentData: JSON }`
*   **Operation:**
    *   Listens for input events on all connected devices.
    *   Parses input to determine `intentType` and `intentData`.
    *   Creates `IntentPayload` and pushes to a central Intent Broker.

**2. Intent Broker (IB):**

*   **Function:** Central repository and routing system for `IntentPayload` objects.
*   **Data Structure:**  Redis queue with deviceID as a key for prioritized messaging.
*   **Operation:**
    *   Receives `IntentPayload` from ICM.
    *   Associates `deviceID` with `IntentPayload`.
    *   Broadcasts `IntentPayload` to all devices registered to the user account (or shadow account).
    *   Manages device registration/deregistration.

**3. Device State Replication Module (DSRM):**

*   **Function:**  Responds to `IntentPayload` broadcasts and updates device state accordingly.  Crucially, this is *not* a direct command execution â€“ it's state synchronization.
*   **Operation:**
    *   Listens for `IntentPayload` broadcasts.
    *   Filters `IntentPayload` by `intentType` and `intentData`.
    *   If `intentType` applies to the device:
        *   Updates internal device state based on `intentData`.
        *   Executes the action on the device.
        *   Publishes a "StateConfirmed" message back to the IB with the updated device state.

**4. Cross-Device Handoff Mechanism:**

*   **Trigger:** User proximity to a new device.
*   **Process:**
    *   Proximity sensor detects user near a new device.
    *   New device queries IB for the current device state of all services the user is currently interacting with.
    *   IB broadcasts a query for current state to all associated devices.
    *   DSRM on active devices respond with their current state.
    *   New device receives the state information and seamlessly resumes the user's activity.

**Pseudocode (Cross-Device Handoff):**

```
// On New Device (proximity detected)
function handleProximityDetected() {
  queryIBForCurrentState();
}

function queryIBForCurrentState() {
  IB.sendRequest("getCurrentState");
}

// On IB (Receives Request)
IB.onRequest("getCurrentState") {
  broadcastToAllDevices("requestCurrentState");
}

// On Active Devices (Receives Broadcast)
device.onBroadcast("requestCurrentState") {
  currentState = getCurrentDeviceState();
  IB.sendResponse(currentState);
}

//On New Device (Receives Response)
device.onReceiveResponse(currentState) {
  applyDeviceState(currentState);
  //resume activity
}

```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond voice-activated control to a system where user intent is a persistent, shareable state across *all* connected devices. Imagine starting a music playlist on your phone, walking over to your smart speaker, and having the song seamlessly continue. Or dimming lights using a gesture on your smartwatch and having those lights stay dimmed when you enter the room. This creates a genuinely interconnected experience and a more intuitive user interface.
