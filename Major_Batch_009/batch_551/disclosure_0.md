## Temporal Data Sharding with Rotating Keys

**Concept:** Expand upon the key rotation concept by applying it to *time-based* data sharding. Instead of a single document key, utilize a series of document keys, each valid for a specific time window. These keys are themselves rotated, but more critically, data is *sharded* based on the key used to encrypt it. This creates inherent temporal access control and simplifies auditing.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:** Documents are broken into immutable “time-stamped records.” Each record includes a timestamp *and* the document key ID used for encryption.
*   **Key Hierarchy:**
    *   *Root Key:* Long-term, rarely rotated. Used to encrypt the Key Encryption Keys (KEKs).
    *   *KEKs:*  Rotate frequently (e.g., weekly). Encrypt the Document Key Sets.
    *   *Document Key Sets:* Contain a set of Document Keys, each valid for a specific time window (e.g., daily or hourly).
    *   *Document Keys:* Used to encrypt individual time-stamped records.
*   **Encryption Process:**
    1.  Determine the appropriate Document Key based on the record’s timestamp.
    2.  Encrypt the record using the Document Key.
    3.  Store the encrypted record *along with* its associated timestamp and Document Key ID.
*   **Decryption Process:**
    1.  Retrieve the encrypted record, timestamp, and Document Key ID.
    2.  Use the timestamp and Document Key ID to locate the correct Document Key.
    3.  Decrypt the record using the Document Key.
*   **Key Rotation:**
    1.  When a Document Key Set is due for rotation:
        *   Generate a new Document Key Set.
        *   Encrypt the new Document Key Set with a new KEK.
        *   Rotate the KEK (potentially using a Hardware Security Module - HSM).
        *   Update metadata to indicate the active Key Set.
    2. Old key sets are archived but remain accessible for auditing or replay.
*   **Access Control:**
    *   Access to data is governed by the active Key Set at the time the data was encrypted.
    *   Access requests require a valid KEK and Root Key to decrypt the necessary Key Sets.
    *   Auditing is simplified by examining the Document Key ID associated with each record.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation):**

```
FUNCTION RotateDocumentKeySet(oldKEK, newKEK, oldKeySet, newKeySet, rootKey)

    // Decrypt oldKeySet using oldKEK and rootKey
    decryptedOldKeySet = Decrypt(oldKeySet, oldKEK, rootKey)

    // Generate newKeySet (collection of document keys)

    // Encrypt newKeySet using newKEK and rootKey
    encryptedNewKeySet = Encrypt(newKeySet, newKEK, rootKey)

    // Archive oldKeySet (for auditing)

    // Update metadata to point to encryptedNewKeySet as the active Key Set

    // Rotate KEK (optional, but recommended)

    RETURN SUCCESS
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Fine-grained access control:** Allows for temporal access restrictions.
*   **Simplified auditing:** Makes it easy to track who had access to data at any given time.
*   **Increased security:** Reduces the blast radius of a key compromise. If a key is compromised, only data encrypted with that key is affected.
*   **Scalability:** Allows for the distribution of key management responsibilities. Different teams can manage different key sets.
*   **Temporal Data Integrity:** Records are intrinsically linked to a specific key version, enhancing forensic analysis.
