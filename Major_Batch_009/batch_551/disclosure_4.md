## Adaptive Haptic Notification System

**Concept:** Extend environmental awareness beyond audio volume adjustment to incorporate localized haptic feedback, modulated by environmental context and user activity, creating a multi-sensory notification system.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of micro-actuators embedded within device casing (e.g., phone, smartwatch, tablet). Density: 20 actuators/100mm<sup>2</sup>.
    *   Haptic driver chip capable of independent control of each actuator.
    *   Existing suite of sensors: Microphone, accelerometer, gyroscope, location sensor, camera.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Environmental Analyzer:* Processes sensor data (audio, visual, motion, location) to classify environment (e.g., quiet office, noisy street, moving vehicle, stationary). Utilizes existing classification models, potentially augmented with a new ‘Activity’ classification based on accelerometer/gyroscope data.
    *   *Haptic Pattern Generator:*  Creates localized vibration patterns (frequency, intensity, duration) based on:
        *   Environment Classification: Different environments trigger different base haptic patterns. (e.g., subtle pulsing in a quiet office, sharp taps on a noisy street).
        *   Notification Type: Prioritize notifications (e.g., urgent calls = strong, localized vibration; low-priority email = gentle, diffused vibration).
        *   User Activity: Dynamically adjust haptic intensity/pattern based on user motion. (e.g., reduce vibration while running, increase during inactivity).
        *   Directional Haptics: Use actuator array to create a sense of direction for notifications. (e.g., vibrating actuators on the left side of the device to indicate an incoming call from a contact saved on the left).
    *   *Dynamic Model Training:* Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to personalize haptic feedback based on user interaction. User feedback (e.g., manually adjusting vibration intensity, dismissing notifications) used to refine the haptic pattern generation logic.
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(environment, notificationType, userActivity, notificationDirection) {
    basePattern = getBasePattern(environment);  // Returns a default haptic pattern for the environment
    priorityModifier = getPriorityModifier(notificationType); // Modifies base pattern based on urgency
    activityModifier = getActivityModifier(userActivity); // Adjusts intensity based on movement

    // Apply modifiers to base pattern
    modifiedPattern = applyModifiers(basePattern, priorityModifier, activityModifier);

    // Directional Haptics
    if (notificationDirection != null) {
        localizedPattern = applyDirectionalHaptics(modifiedPattern, notificationDirection);
    } else {
        localizedPattern = modifiedPattern;
    }

    return localizedPattern;
}
```

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Environment Class:* (Environment Type, Noise Level, Location, Activity)
    *   *HapticPattern:* (Frequency, Intensity, Duration, Localization)
    *   *User Profile:* (Preferred Haptic Intensity, Notification Prioritization)

*   **Considerations:** Power consumption of micro-actuators. Optimization for battery life. Integration with existing notification system. User customization options.
