## Dynamic Port Weighting with Predictive Loss Modeling

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Standard network interface cards (NICs) with hardware timestamping capabilities. High-resolution system clock. Sufficient processing power for real-time data analysis.
*   **Software:** Kernel-level network monitoring module. User-space application for configuration and data visualization. Machine learning library (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

**Innovation Description:**

The core idea is to move beyond simple duration-based port selection for retransmission, incorporating *predictive* loss modeling based on historical network performance. Instead of passively observing lossless duration, the system actively learns to *anticipate* potential packet loss on each port.

**Functional Components:**

1.  **Real-time Packet Monitoring:** The kernel module intercepts all outgoing and incoming packets. Hardware timestamps are recorded for each packet.
2.  **Port Performance History:** A sliding window stores performance metrics for each port. Metrics include:
    *   Round Trip Time (RTT)
    *   Packet Loss Rate
    *   Jitter
    *   Bandwidth Utilization
3.  **Predictive Loss Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network) is trained on the port performance history. The model predicts the probability of packet loss on each port *before* a packet is sent. Input features include historical RTT, loss rate, jitter, bandwidth, and time-of-day effects.
4.  **Dynamic Port Weighting:** Each port is assigned a weight based on the predicted probability of loss. Lower predicted loss = higher weight.
5.  **Weighted Port Selection:** When retransmitting lost packets, the system selects the port with the highest weight. This is *not* simply choosing the port with the longest lossless duration; it's choosing the port most likely to deliver the packet successfully *right now*.
6.  **Adaptive Learning:** The machine learning model is continuously retrained with new performance data. This allows the system to adapt to changing network conditions and improve its prediction accuracy over time.
7.  **Probing & Calibration:**  Periodically, the system sends small 'probe' packets over each port to gather fresh performance data and calibrate the predictive model. These probes are distinct from regular data packets.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
port_history = {} // Dictionary to store port performance data
model = train_predictive_model() // Train initial model

// Packet Transmission/Reception Loop
for each packet:
    timestamp = get_hardware_timestamp()
    port = get_packet_port()
    direction = get_packet_direction() //outgoing/incoming

    if direction == "outgoing":
        predicted_loss = model.predict_loss(port, timestamp)
        port_weight = 1.0 - predicted_loss // Higher weight for lower predicted loss
        //use the port_weight in a probability distribution for port selection

    if direction == "incoming":
        //update port_history with RTT, loss, etc.

    //If packet loss detected
    if packet_lost(packet):
        best_port = select_best_retransmission_port(port_history, model)
        retransmit_packet(packet, best_port)
```

**`select_best_retransmission_port()` Function:**

```
function select_best_retransmission_port(port_history, model):
    candidate_ports = get_available_ports()
    port_scores = {}

    for port in candidate_ports:
        predicted_loss = model.predict_loss(port, current_timestamp)
        historical_performance_score = calculate_historical_score(port_history, port) //Consider RTT, loss, jitter
        port_score = (1.0 - predicted_loss) * historical_performance_score
        port_scores[port] = port_score

    best_port = max(port_scores, key=port_scores.get)
    return best_port
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved reliability in dynamic network environments.
*   Proactive loss mitigation, reducing retransmissions.
*   Adaptability to changing network conditions.
*   Enhanced user experience for real-time applications (e.g., video streaming, online gaming).
