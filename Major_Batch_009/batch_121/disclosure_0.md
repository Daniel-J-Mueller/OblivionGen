# D1035472

## Dynamic Camouflage Security Sensor

**Concept:** A security sensor that actively blends into its surroundings, achieving a level of visual concealment exceeding static camouflage. This isn't about matching color, but about *mimicking texture and apparent depth*.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Housing:** Constructed from an array of micro-actuators and a flexible, high-resolution e-ink/electrowetting display surface. Dimensions initially similar to D1035472, but adaptable.
*   **Environmental Scanning:** Integrated micro-lidar and high-resolution camera system. Scanning frequency: 5-10 Hz. Range: 0.5 - 5 meters.
*   **Texture Mapping Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Point cloud data from lidar, RGB data from camera.
    *   Process: Algorithm analyzes the scanned surface and generates a height map representing surface texture.  Height map resolution: dynamically adjusted based on distance – higher resolution closer to the sensor, lower resolution further away.
    *   Output:  Data stream to control the micro-actuators and e-ink display.
*   **Micro-Actuator Array:** Dense array of MEMS-based micro-actuators beneath the e-ink display. Each actuator can independently adjust the display surface's height by up to 2mm.  Actuator pitch: 1mm.
*   **E-Ink/Electrowetting Display:**  High-resolution, full-color display capable of rendering grayscale and color information. Refresh rate: 30Hz.  Pixel density: >300 PPI. Capable of displaying textures mimicking scanned surfaces.
*   **Power Source:** Internal rechargeable battery. Estimated operating time: 24 hours. Wireless charging capability.
*   **Communication:** Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy.
*   **Mounting:** Magnetic base, adhesive backing, or threaded mount.

**Pseudocode (Texture Mapping Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateTextureMap(lidarData, cameraData):
  // Lidar data is a point cloud
  // Camera data is RGB image

  // 1. Preprocess Lidar Data:
  //   - Filter noise
  //   - Downsample if necessary

  // 2. Create Depth Map from Lidar:
  //   - Convert point cloud to depth image

  // 3. Extract Texture Features from Camera Image:
  //   - Calculate texture descriptors (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, Haralick features)

  // 4. Combine Depth and Texture:
  //   - Associate texture features with corresponding depth values
  //   - Create a combined texture map that represents both depth and texture information

  // 5. Dynamic Resolution Adjustment:
  //   - Determine optimal resolution based on distance to scanned surface
  //   - Resample texture map to match desired resolution

  // 6. Output: Texture map data stream for micro-actuators and e-ink display
  RETURN textureMap
END FUNCTION

**Operation:**

The sensor continuously scans its surroundings. The Texture Mapping Algorithm processes the data to create a dynamic texture map. This map controls the micro-actuators, physically altering the sensor’s surface to mimic the surrounding texture, while the e-ink display adjusts color and pattern. The combination of physical deformation and visual rendering creates a powerful camouflage effect.  The sensor essentially becomes "invisible" by blending into its background.
