## Haptic Display Integration & Environmental Mapping

**Concept:** Augment the audiovisual device with localized haptic feedback, synchronized with displayed content and environmental analysis, creating a spatially aware immersive experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Array:** Integrate a dense array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or electro-tactile) into the display sub-assembly *behind* the display panel. Resolution: minimum 60 actuators per 100mmÂ². Actuator range: 0-5mm displacement, variable frequency (20Hz-2kHz).
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Add a LiDAR sensor (range: 5m) and an array of ultrasonic sensors (range: 3m) to the display sub-assembly. Sensors should be capable of creating a real-time 3D map of the immediate environment. Sensor data fusion should prioritize obstacle detection within a 1m radius of the device.
*   **Processing Unit Enhancement:** Upgrade the existing processor to handle sensor data processing, environmental mapping, and haptic feedback synchronization. Minimum specs: Octa-core processor, dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) for AI-assisted environmental analysis, 16GB RAM.
*   **Software Integration:** Develop software capable of:
    *   Analyzing visual content for haptic cues (e.g., texture, impact, movement).
    *   Interpreting environmental map data to identify surfaces and obstacles.
    *   Generating haptic patterns based on visual content *and* environmental data.
    *   Synchronizing haptic feedback with both visual and auditory output.
    *   User customization of haptic intensity and patterns.
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:**
    ```pseudocode
    FUNCTION GenerateHapticPattern(visualData, environmentData):
        // Analyze visual data for texture, impact, movement
        textureMap = ExtractTexture(visualData)
        impactPoints = DetectImpactPoints(visualData)
        movementVectors = CalculateMovementVectors(visualData)

        // Analyze environment data for nearby surfaces
        nearbySurfaces = IdentifyNearbySurfaces(environmentData)
        surfaceDistances = CalculateSurfaceDistances(nearbySurfaces)

        // Combine data to create haptic pattern
        hapticPattern = {}
        FOR each pixel IN textureMap:
            hapticPattern[pixel] = CalculateHapticIntensity(pixel, surfaceDistances)

        FOR each impactPoint IN impactPoints:
            hapticPattern[impactPoint] += ImpactIntensity

        FOR each movementVector IN movementVectors:
            hapticPattern[movementVector] += MovementIntensity

        RETURN hapticPattern
    ```
*   **Power System:** Supplement existing power supply with a dedicated high-current output for haptic actuators. Add thermal management system to dissipate heat generated by actuators.
*   **Physical Integration:** Redesign display sub-assembly to accommodate haptic array and environmental sensors. Ensure minimal impact on device weight and dimensions. Integrate vibration dampening materials to minimize unwanted resonances.
