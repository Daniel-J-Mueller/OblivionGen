## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Device Profiles

**Concept:** Expand device grouping beyond simple co-location to create dynamic acoustic scene reconstructions and personalized device profiles, allowing for more nuanced voice command execution and environmental awareness.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Feature Extraction:**

1.  **Multi-Device Audio Synchronization:**  Implement a high-precision synchronization protocol across all paired devices (as established by the existing patent’s methods).  Beyond timestamping, incorporate frequency-domain correlation to refine alignment.  Target synchronization accuracy: < 5ms.
2.  **Environmental Audio Fingerprinting:**  Each device continuously analyzes ambient audio (even when not actively processing voice commands) to build an ‘acoustic fingerprint’ of its environment.  This includes:
    *   **Dominant Frequency Analysis:** Identify prevalent frequencies (e.g., HVAC systems, traffic noise, appliance hum).
    *   **Reverberation Mapping:**  Estimate room size and surface characteristics based on reverberation patterns.  Utilize impulse response analysis.
    *   **Sound Event Detection (SED):**  Identify and categorize specific sound events (e.g., door slams, footsteps, speech, music). Employ a pre-trained SED model.
3.  **Device-Specific Noise Profiles:** Each device builds a profile of its inherent noise characteristics (e.g., fan noise, internal component hum). This is crucial for isolating user voice commands.

**II. Scene Reconstruction & Profile Building:**

1.  **Federated Scene Modeling:**  Data from all devices within a user's network is aggregated (using federated learning techniques to preserve privacy). A shared acoustic scene model is built representing the user's typical environment(s).
2.  **Scene Segmentation:**  The continuous audio stream is segmented into distinct acoustic scenes based on changes in the acoustic fingerprint.
3.  **Device Role Assignment:** Based on scene reconstruction & device audio characteristics, assign a ‘role’ to each device:
    *   **Primary Listener:**  The device closest to the user and with the clearest audio capture.
    *   **Secondary Listener:** Devices providing supplemental audio or spatial context.
    *   **Environmental Monitor:** Devices focused on ambient noise detection.
4.  **Personalized Device Profiles:** Create a profile for each device reflecting its role, acoustic characteristics, and typical location. Profiles should dynamically adapt over time.

**III. Command Processing & Execution:**

1.  **Intent Recognition Refinement:** Use the acoustic scene model and device profiles to refine intent recognition:
    *   **Noise Filtering:** Dynamically adjust noise filtering based on ambient noise levels identified in the scene.
    *   **Spatial Audio Processing:** Utilize multi-device audio data to estimate the user's location and direction of speech.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:**  Consider the current acoustic scene when interpreting voice commands (e.g., "turn on the lights" might activate different lights depending on whether the scene is "living room" or "bedroom").
2.  **Command Delegation:** Delegate commands to the appropriate device based on its role and capabilities.
3.  **Adaptive Sensitivity:** Adjust the sensitivity of each device's microphone array based on its role and the current acoustic scene.

**Pseudocode (Intent Recognition Refinement):**

```
FUNCTION RefineIntent(audioData, deviceProfile, acousticScene):
    // 1. Noise Reduction
    noiseLevel = acousticScene.getNoiseLevel()
    filteredAudio = applyNoiseReduction(audioData, noiseLevel)

    // 2. Spatial Audio Processing
    userLocation = estimateUserLocation(filteredAudio, deviceProfile)

    // 3. Contextual Awareness
    sceneType = acousticScene.getType()
    refinedIntent = interpretIntent(filteredAudio, sceneType, userLocation)

    RETURN refinedIntent
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-quality microphone arrays with beamforming capabilities.
*   Edge processing capabilities on each device to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
*   Secure communication protocols to protect user privacy.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart home automation with improved accuracy and responsiveness.
*   Enhanced voice assistants with contextual awareness.
*   Immersive audio experiences with spatial sound reproduction.
*   Privacy-preserving acoustic monitoring for security or health applications.
