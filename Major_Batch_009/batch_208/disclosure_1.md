## Adaptive Perimeter System with Predictive Alerting

**System Overview:**

This system extends the location-based triggering of camera systems by incorporating predictive analysis of user behavior and environmental factors to create dynamically adjusted security perimeters and pre-emptive recording. It moves beyond simply reacting to alerts *within* a defined area to *anticipating* potential events and preparing accordingly.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Existing Camera Network:** Leverages existing camera infrastructure as described in the provided patent.
*   **User Device(s):** Smartphones, smartwatches, or dedicated wearable devices.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Integration with publicly available data (weather, traffic, noise levels) and optionally, local sensors (motion, air quality, vibration).
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** A local server or powerful device capable of running machine learning models.
*   **Central Server:** For data aggregation, model training, and system management.

**Software Components:**

*   **Behavioral Analysis Engine:** Machine learning model trained on user location history, time of day, day of week, and other contextual data to predict likely paths and activity patterns.
*   **Environmental Anomaly Detector:** Identifies unusual environmental conditions that may indicate potential security risks (e.g., sudden loud noises, unusual traffic patterns, severe weather).
*   **Dynamic Perimeter Generator:**  Creates a security perimeter that adapts in real-time based on behavioral predictions and environmental anomalies. The perimeter isn’t static, but rather a 'bubble' that moves and changes shape with the predicted user path.
*   **Pre-emptive Recording Manager:** Initiates recording *before* an event occurs, based on the dynamic perimeter and associated risk levels.  Can utilize different recording modes (e.g., low-resolution continuous recording, high-resolution event-triggered recording).
*   **Alert Prioritization Engine:** Filters and prioritizes alerts based on risk level, user preferences, and contextual data.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Baseline Data Collection:** System gathers data on user location history, routine activities, and environmental factors.
2.  **Predictive Modeling:** The Behavioral Analysis Engine and Environmental Anomaly Detector generate predictions about the user’s likely path and potential risks.
3.  **Dynamic Perimeter Creation:** The Dynamic Perimeter Generator creates a security perimeter that moves with the predicted user path, adjusting its size and shape based on risk level.
4.  **Pre-emptive Recording:** Cameras within the dynamic perimeter begin pre-emptive recording, capturing footage *before* an event occurs.
5.  **Event Detection & Alerting:**  If an event is detected (e.g., motion, sound, intrusion), the Alert Prioritization Engine filters and prioritizes the alert, sending it to the user.
6.  **Continuous Adaptation:** The system continuously learns and adapts based on new data, improving the accuracy of its predictions and the effectiveness of its security measures.

**Pseudocode - Dynamic Perimeter Generation**

```
// Variables
userLocation (x, y)
predictedPath [list of (x, y) coordinates]
riskLevel (integer 0-10)
perimeterRadiusBase (float) = 10 meters
perimeterRadiusMultiplier (float) = 0.5 // adjust based on risk level
maxPerimeterRadius (float) = 50 meters
minPerimeterRadius (float) = 5 meters

// Function to calculate the perimeter radius
function calculatePerimeterRadius(riskLevel) {
    radius = perimeterRadiusBase + (riskLevel * perimeterRadiusMultiplier)
    if (radius > maxPerimeterRadius) {
        radius = maxPerimeterRadius
    }
    if (radius < minPerimeterRadius) {
        radius = minPerimeterRadius
    }
    return radius
}

// Function to generate the perimeter polygon
function generatePerimeterPolygon(userLocation, radius, predictedPath) {
    // Create a polygon that follows the predicted path, with a radius
    // around each point.  Use a smoothing algorithm to create a
    // natural-looking perimeter.
    polygon = createPolygon(userLocation, radius)
    for (point in predictedPath) {
        addPointToPolygon(polygon, point, radius)
        smoothPolygon(polygon) // Apply smoothing algorithm
    }
    return polygon
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
    getUserLocation(userLocation)
    getPredictedPath(predictedPath)
    getRiskLevel(riskLevel)

    perimeterRadius = calculatePerimeterRadius(riskLevel)
    perimeterPolygon = generatePerimeterPolygon(userLocation, perimeterRadius, predictedPath)

    // Send the perimeter polygon to the camera system
    sendPerimeterToCameraSystem(perimeterPolygon)

    sleep(1) // Update the perimeter every second
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Integration with Smart Home Devices:**  Automate actions based on the dynamic perimeter (e.g., turn on lights, lock doors).
*   **Crowdsourced Risk Assessment:** Leverage data from other users to identify potential risks in the area.
*   **Augmented Reality Overlay:**  Display the dynamic perimeter and potential risks in an augmented reality view on the user's device.
