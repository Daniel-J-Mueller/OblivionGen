## Adaptive Resonance Network with Temporal Contextual Gating

**Concept:** Expanding on the probabilistic circuit’s decision-making, create an Adaptive Resonance Network (ART) architecture that incorporates a temporal contextual gating mechanism. This allows the network to not only classify data but to dynamically adjust its resonance thresholds based on recent input sequences and learned temporal dependencies. It aims to improve classification accuracy and adaptability in time-series data or sequential inputs.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Architecture:** A layered ART network. Each layer consists of:
    *   **Input Buffer:** Stores the current input vector.
    *   **Category Representation Layer:** Stores learned category vectors (weights).
    *   **Resonance Detector:** Compares input vector with category vectors, determines resonance.
    *   **Match/Mismatch Logic:**  Decides to resonate with an existing category or create a new one.
*   **Temporal Context Module (TCM):**  Connected to each layer of the ART network.
    *   **Sequence Buffer:** Stores a rolling window of recent input vectors (e.g., last 10-20 vectors).
    *   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – LSTM or GRU:** Processes the sequence buffer to learn temporal dependencies.
    *   **Gating Mechanism:**  The RNN outputs a set of 'gate' values (between 0 and 1) for each category in the ART network.  These gates modulate the resonance thresholds.
        *   A high gate value *increases* the resonance threshold for a specific category, making it more difficult to resonate with. This is used when the current input sequence suggests the category is unlikely.
        *   A low gate value *decreases* the resonance threshold, making it easier to resonate. This is used when the sequence suggests the category is likely.
*   **Probabilistic Input Layer:**  The initial input to the network is processed by a probabilistic circuit similar to the one described in the patent. This adds noise and randomization to the input, promoting exploration and robustness.
*   **Weight Update Rule:**  Weights are updated using a modified Hebbian learning rule.  The learning rate is dynamically adjusted based on the gate values.  Stronger signals (low gate values) lead to larger weight updates, while weaker signals (high gate values) lead to smaller updates.
*   **Category Aging:** Implement a category aging mechanism where categories with prolonged inactivity have their weights decayed slightly. This prevents the network from becoming overly rigid and allows it to adapt to changing data distributions.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Input: input_vector, sequence_buffer
// Output: output_vector, updated_weights

1.  probabilistic_input = ApplyProbabilisticCircuit(input_vector)
2.  temporal_context = RNN(sequence_buffer) // Output: gate_values
3.  For each category in CategoryRepresentationLayer:
    resonance_threshold = BaseThreshold * (1 - temporal_context[category])
    resonance_level = CosineSimilarity(probabilistic_input, category_vector)
    If resonance_level > resonance_threshold:
        Resonate(category)
        UpdateCategoryVector(category, probabilistic_input)
        Break // Resonate with first resonant category
    Else:
        CreateNewCategory(probabilistic_input)

4.  UpdateSequenceBuffer(input_vector)
5.  Return output_vector
```

**Components:**

*   **RNN:** LSTM or GRU. Configurable hidden layer size.
*   **Base Threshold:**  Adjustable parameter to control overall sensitivity.
*   **Cosine Similarity:** Used for measuring resonance level.
*   **Sequence Buffer Size:** Adjustable to capture longer or shorter temporal dependencies.
*   **Category Aging Rate:** Adjustable parameter to control the rate of weight decay.
