## Dynamic Content Stitching via URL Fragments

**Concept:** Leverage the URL fragment (the portion after the `#` symbol) not just as an anchor within a page, but as a directive to dynamically stitch together content from multiple sources *before* delivery to the user. This expands on the idea of URL rescue by repurposing ‘failed’ URLs as content assembly instructions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Fragment Schema:** Define a structured schema for URL fragments.  This schema will specify content source identifiers, content block identifiers, and optional parameters (e.g., formatting, language). Example: `/product/1234#source=blog,block=feature,lang=en`.
*   **Content Source Registry:** Maintain a registry mapping source identifiers (e.g., "blog", "FAQ", "product_details") to content retrieval endpoints (URLs, database queries, APIs).
*   **Content Block Definition:** For each content source, define available content blocks and their associated data structures. Blocks can be text, images, videos, or structured data.
*   **Request Interception:** When a URL with a fragment is received, intercept the request before standard URL resolution.
*   **Fragment Parsing:** Parse the fragment according to the defined schema.
*   **Content Retrieval:** Retrieve the requested content blocks from the registered sources. Handle errors gracefully (e.g., source unavailable, block not found).
*   **Content Stitching Engine:** A component that assembles the retrieved content blocks into a cohesive page. This engine will manage layout, formatting, and data binding. Utilize templating or a component-based architecture.
*   **Dynamic Page Generation:** Generate the complete HTML page dynamically.
*   **Caching Layer:** Implement a caching layer to store frequently assembled pages and reduce latency.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** If content retrieval or stitching fails, provide a meaningful fallback experience (e.g., a generic error page, a related content suggestion).
*   **Security Considerations:**  Implement strict validation of source identifiers and block identifiers to prevent malicious content injection.

**Pseudocode (Content Stitching Engine):**

```
function stitchContent(fragmentData):
  blocks = []
  for (sourceId, blockId) in fragmentData.blocks:
    try:
      block = getContent(sourceId, blockId)  // Retrieves content from source
      blocks.append(block)
    catch (error):
      logError(error)
      // Handle error - e.g., use default content, skip block

  pageContent = applyTemplate(blocks)  // Renders blocks using a template

  return pageContent
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

This moves beyond simply "rescuing" broken URLs. It *reinterprets* them as instructions for content construction. This allows for extremely granular content personalization and dynamic page generation, creating tailored experiences based on user-defined (or algorithmically determined) URL fragments. It’s a paradigm shift – URLs aren’t just addresses; they’re programmatic content requests.
