## Dynamic Highlight ‘Ecosystem’ & Collaborative Annotation Layers

**Concept:** Expand the core functionality from simply *finding* popular highlights to creating a dynamic, layered annotation ecosystem where highlights aren't static markers, but entry points to user-created content, discussions, and evolving interpretations of the text.

**Specs:**

**1. Annotation Layers:**

*   **Layer Types:** Define distinct annotation layer types:
    *   *Clarification:* User provides a simplified explanation of a passage.
    *   *Context:* User adds historical/external information relevant to the passage.
    *   *Counterpoint:* User presents an opposing viewpoint or critique.
    *   *Expansion:* User extends the idea presented, linking to further reading.
    *   *Creative:* User responds with a poem, song, or short story inspired by the passage.
*   **Layer Visibility:** Users control which layers are visible. Default: Only 'Clarification' is shown.
*   **Layer Creation/Editing:**  Any user can create a new layer or contribute to an existing one (subject to moderation – see section 4).

**2.  Dynamic Highlight Weighting:**

*   **Beyond Popularity:**  Instead of solely weighting highlights by the number of users who made them, incorporate:
    *   *Layer Activity:* Highlights with active layers (recent contributions) receive higher weight.
    *   *Layer Quality:* A reputation system (upvotes/downvotes) for layer contributions.  Higher-quality contributions boost highlight weight.
    *   *User Authority:* Users with proven expertise in a subject (verified profiles) have their highlights and layer contributions weighted more heavily.
*   **‘Emergent Consensus’ Algorithm:**  A constantly recalculating score that determines the visibility and ranking of highlights, factoring in all weighting criteria.

**3.  Interactive ‘Highlight Maps’**

*   **Visual Representation:**  Display the text as a ‘map’ where highlights are represented as nodes.
*   **Node Size/Color:**  Reflect the ‘Emergent Consensus’ score – larger/brighter nodes indicate more significant highlights.
*   **Connectivity:**  Draw lines connecting related highlights (based on semantic similarity and user-defined relationships).
*   **Layer Filtering:**  Allow users to filter the map by annotation layer type (e.g., show only highlights with ‘Counterpoint’ layers).

**4.  Moderation & Curation**

*   **Community Moderation:**  Allow users to flag inappropriate or inaccurate layer contributions.
*   **Expert Curation:**  Enlist subject matter experts to curate high-quality layers and identify misinformation.
*   **‘Canonical’ Layers:**  Allow experts to designate specific layers as ‘canonical’ – these appear prominently and are considered the authoritative interpretation of the passage.

**5.  Pseudocode – ‘Emergent Consensus’ Algorithm**

```
function calculateEmergentConsensus(highlight) {
  basePopularityScore = numberOfUsersWhoHighlighted(highlight)

  activityScore = calculateActivityScore(highlight) // Based on recent layer contributions
  qualityScore = calculateQualityScore(highlight) // Based on layer upvotes/downvotes
  authorityScore = calculateAuthorityScore(highlight) // Based on contributor profiles

  emergentConsensusScore = (
    basePopularityScore * 0.4 +
    activityScore * 0.3 +
    qualityScore * 0.2 +
    authorityScore * 0.1
  )

  return emergentConsensusScore
}

function calculateActivityScore(highlight) {
  // Calculate score based on number of new contributions in the last X days
  // Higher number of contributions = higher score
}

function calculateQualityScore(highlight) {
  // Calculate score based on average upvote/downvote ratio of layer contributions
  // Higher ratio = higher score
}

function calculateAuthorityScore(highlight) {
  // Calculate score based on the authority level of users who contributed to the layer
  // Users with verified expertise = higher score
}
```

**Potential Expansion:** Integrate with external knowledge bases (Wikipedia, academic databases) to automatically enrich annotation layers. Allow users to create and share ‘highlight tours’ – curated sequences of highlights with accompanying commentary.
