## Dynamic Regex Token Generation via Active Learning & User Feedback Loops

**Concept:** Extend the existing token library generation with an active learning system that learns from user interactions and data drift to continuously refine and expand the regex tokens. This moves beyond initial machine learning training to a persistent, adaptive system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Drift Detection:**

*   **Input Data Stream:**  Continuously ingest a stream of raw input data representative of the domain (e.g., product descriptions, customer reviews, support tickets).
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Track the performance of existing regex tokens against the incoming data stream. Metrics include:
    *   *Match Rate:* Percentage of input data fields successfully matched by tokens.
    *   *False Positive Rate:* Percentage of incorrect matches.
    *   *Coverage:*  Percentage of unique string values captured by tokens.
*   **Drift Detection Algorithm:** Implement a drift detection algorithm (e.g., ADWIN, DDM) to identify significant changes in the distribution of input data.  Triggers token re-evaluation or generation.

**2. Active Learning Loop:**

*   **Uncertainty Sampling:** When drift is detected, or periodically, select data fields with high uncertainty – fields where existing tokens have low confidence or fail to match.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop Annotation:** Present these uncertain data fields to human annotators via a user interface. Annotators will:
    *   Identify the attribute being described.
    *   Highlight the relevant string values.
    *   Provide a normalized value (as in the existing system).
*   **Model Retraining:** Use the newly annotated data to retrain the machine learning model responsible for generating regex tokens. Incorporate the annotations to refine existing tokens or generate new ones.
*   **Token Ranking & Selection:** Implement a ranking system to prioritize newly generated tokens based on:
    *   *Coverage:* How many previously unmatched string values the token now matches.
    *   *Specificity:*  How narrowly the token matches – minimizing false positives.
    *   *Human Feedback Score:* Annotator rating of token quality.

**3. Token Library Management:**

*   **Versioning:** Maintain a version history of all regex tokens, allowing rollback to previous states.
*   **A/B Testing:** Enable A/B testing of different token sets to evaluate their performance in real-world scenarios.
*   **Automatic Deployment:** Automatically deploy updated token sets to production after successful A/B testing.

**4. Pseudocode (Active Learning Loop):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Monitor data stream and detect drift
    driftDetected = detectDataDrift(incomingDataStream);

    if (driftDetected) {
        // Select uncertain data fields
        uncertainFields = selectUncertainFields(incomingDataStream);

        // Present to human annotators
        annotatedFields = presentToAnnotators(uncertainFields);

        // Retrain model with new annotations
        retrainModel(annotatedFields);

        // Generate new tokens
        newTokens = generateRegexTokens(retrainedModel);

        // Evaluate and prioritize tokens
        prioritizedTokens = evaluateAndPrioritizeTokens(newTokens);

        // Update token library
        updateTokenLibrary(prioritizedTokens);
    }

    // Monitor performance and adjust parameters
    monitorPerformanceAndAdjustParameters();
}
```

**5.  User Interface Enhancement:**

*   **Annotation Tool:**  A dedicated UI for annotators to highlight strings, select attributes, and provide normalized values.
*   **Token Explorer:**  A UI for users to browse the token library, view token details, and test tokens against sample data.
*   **Performance Dashboard:**  A dashboard to visualize token performance metrics (match rate, false positive rate, coverage).
