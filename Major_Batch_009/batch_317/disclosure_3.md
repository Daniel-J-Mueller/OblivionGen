## Adaptive Acoustic Guidance System

**Concept:** Expand the visual guidance system to incorporate directional audio cues, dynamically adjusting to ambient noise and worker preferences, and layering in subtle haptic feedback.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of directional micro-speakers mounted alongside the existing light array on the mounting plate. Minimum 8 speakers, capable of beamforming.
    *   Low-profile haptic transducers integrated into the vests or armbands worn by associates. (Optional, for premium setups).
    *   Ambient noise sensors (microphones) integrated into the mounting plate and potentially associate wearables.
    *   Existing camera/computer vision system remains core for package/destination ID.
*   **Software/Logic:**
    *   **Audio Cue Generation:** Based on package destination and direction of travel, generate a corresponding spatial audio cue. For 'correct' destination, a gentle chime or tone originates from the direction of the container. For 'incorrect' destination, a distinct, slightly more urgent tone originates from the direction the associate *should* be moving.
    *   **Dynamic Noise Cancellation/Amplification:**  Real-time analysis of ambient noise via sensors. System adjusts audio cue volume and frequency to ensure audibility *above* the noise floor. Utilize noise-cancellation techniques where possible.
    *   **Personalization Profiles:**  Associate-specific profiles to adjust audio cue preferences (volume, tone, style). Option for visual-only, audio-only, or combined guidance.
    *   **Haptic Layer (Optional):**  Subtle vibrations on vest/armband synced with audio cues. E.g., a gentle pulse on the left side when the correct container is on the left.
    *   **Directional Audio Beamforming:** Speakers utilize beamforming to focus audio cues directly towards the associate.  Minimizes disruption to other workers.
    *   **Integration with Computer Vision:**  The computer vision system feeds directional and destination data to the audio/haptic control module.
    *   **Calibration Routine:**  Automatic calibration of audio beams and haptic patterns based on associate position relative to the mounting plate.

*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - runs continuously
function processPackage(packageData, associateID) {

  destination = packageData.destination;
  direction = packageData.direction;
  container = packageData.container;

  associateProfile = getAssociateProfile(associateID);

  // Check if audio/haptic guidance is enabled in profile
  if (associateProfile.audioEnabled) {

    if (destination == container) {
      // Correct Container
      audioCue = associateProfile.correctAudioCue;
      playAudioCue(audioCue, direction); // Beamform towards direction
    } else {
      // Incorrect Container
      audioCue = associateProfile.incorrectAudioCue;
      playAudioCue(audioCue, direction); // Beamform towards correct direction.
    }
  }

  if (associateProfile.hapticEnabled) {
    // Activate haptic feedback on correct side (based on correct container location)
    activateHaptic(correctContainerSide, intensity);
  }
}

function playAudioCue(cue, direction) {
  // Calculate speaker array configuration for beamforming
  speakerConfiguration = calculateBeamformingConfiguration(direction);

  // Play audio cue on specified speakers with adjusted volume/frequency
  for (speaker in speakerConfiguration) {
    setSpeakerVolume(speaker, speakerConfiguration[speaker].volume);
    playAudio(speaker, cue);
  }
}
```

*   **Mounting:**  The mounting plate would require space for the additional speakers and sensors. Existing mounting points should be leveraged where possible. Cabling will need to be routed for power and data.
