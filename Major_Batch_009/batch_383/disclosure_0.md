## Modular, Self-Sealing Coolant Distribution Manifold with Integrated Leak Localization

**Concept:** Expand beyond single-basin leak detection to a distributed system that proactively isolates leaks within a complex liquid cooling loop, minimizing downtime and coolant loss.

**Specifications:**

*   **Manifold Material:** High-density polymer with chemically inert internal coating (e.g., PTFE).
*   **Module Dimensions:** Standardized dimensions (e.g., 5cm x 5cm x 2cm) to allow for modular assembly.
*   **Internal Channels:** Microfluidic channels within each module for coolant distribution. Channels designed for minimal dead volume.
*   **Valve Type:** Micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) pinch valves integrated into each channel. Valve control via a central controller.
*   **Leak Sensor:** Capacitive liquid sensor integrated into each channel *before* and *after* the valve. Sensor resolution: 0.1 ml.
*   **Sealant Dispenser:**  Micro-nozzle integrated into each module, connected to a reservoir of fast-curing, thermally conductive sealant. Activated upon leak detection.
*   **Flow Sensors:** Miniature differential pressure sensors at inlet/outlet of each module to monitor coolant flow rate.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  I2C or SPI for communication with the central controller.
*   **Power Requirements:** 3.3V or 5V DC.
*   **Mounting:** Standardized mounting features (screw holes, dovetail joints) for easy integration into a cooling loop.

**Operation:**

1.  Coolant flows through a series of interconnected modules forming a distribution manifold.
2.  Flow sensors continuously monitor coolant flow rate in each module.
3.  Leak sensors detect the presence of coolant outside the designated channels.
4.  Upon leak detection:
    *   The central controller receives a signal from the leak sensor.
    *   The controller immediately closes the pinch valve upstream and downstream of the leak.
    *   The sealant dispenser activates, injecting sealant into the leak area to create a permanent seal.
    *   The controller logs the leak location and time.
5.  The system continues operating with the leak isolated, minimizing coolant loss and preventing damage to components.

**Pseudocode (Controller Logic):**

```
// Global Variables
moduleCount = 16;  // Number of modules in the system
moduleStates[moduleCount] = {ValveOpen, ValveClosed, LeakDetected, SealantApplied};
leakLog = [];

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  for (i = 0; i < moduleCount; i++) {
    if (moduleStates[i] != SealantApplied) {
      if (leakSensor[i].isLiquidDetected()) {
        moduleStates[i] = LeakDetected;
        closePinchValves(i);
        dispenseSealant(i);
        moduleStates[i] = SealantApplied;
        logLeak(i);
      }
    }
  }
}

function logLeak(moduleID) {
  timestamp = getCurrentTimestamp();
  leakLog.append({moduleID: moduleID, timestamp: timestamp});
}

function closePinchValves(moduleID) {
  // Send command to close upstream and downstream valves
}

function dispenseSealant(moduleID) {
  // Activate sealant dispenser for specified module
}
```

**Expansion:**

*   Integration with a central cooling system management platform.
*   Predictive maintenance based on leak sensor data (early detection of potential failures).
*   Automated coolant replenishment system.
*   Use of different sealant materials based on coolant type.
*   Visual indicator (LED) on each module to indicate leak status.
