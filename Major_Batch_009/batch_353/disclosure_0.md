## Dynamic Data Bucketing with Predictive Partition Adjustment

**Concept:** Enhance data stream processing by dynamically adjusting the number of partitions *within* a data bucket based on real-time data arrival rates and processing load. This moves beyond static partition counts established at the beginning of a data bucketâ€™s timeframe.

**Specification:**

1.  **Data Arrival Rate Monitor:** Implement a monitor that tracks the rate of incoming data items assigned to a given data bucket. This should calculate items/second, but also maintain a rolling average over a configurable window (e.g. 5, 10, 30 seconds).
2.  **Processing Load Monitor:** Track the average processing time of data items within each partition of a data bucket.  Metrics should include CPU usage, memory consumption, and I/O operations per partition.
3.  **Partition Adjustment Function:**
    *   Define a threshold for acceptable processing load (e.g., target CPU utilization of 60%).
    *   If the processing load in a partition exceeds the threshold, *and* the data arrival rate is consistently high, initiate a partition split.
    *   If the processing load in a partition falls below a low threshold (e.g., 20%), *and* the data arrival rate is consistently low, initiate a partition merge.
4.  **Dynamic Re-Hashing:**  Develop a re-hashing algorithm to re-assign data items to newly created or merged partitions *without* disrupting ongoing processing. This may involve:
    *   A brief period of dual-writing to both the old and new partition assignments.
    *   Using a consistent hashing approach to minimize data movement during re-partitioning.
5.  **Data Divider Modification:** Augment the existing data divider structure to include a 'partition history' field. This field tracks the partitions to which the data divider was assigned during any re-partitioning events. This allows for auditability and diagnostics.
6.  **Configuration Parameters:**
    *   `max_partitions`: Maximum number of partitions allowed within a data bucket.
    *   `min_partitions`: Minimum number of partitions allowed within a data bucket.
    *   `load_threshold_high`: CPU utilization threshold for triggering partition splits.
    *   `load_threshold_low`: CPU utilization threshold for triggering partition merges.
    *   `arrival_rate_window`: Time window for calculating data arrival rate.
7.  **Pseudocode (Partition Adjustment Function):**

```
function adjustPartitions(dataBucket):
  arrivalRate = calculateArrivalRate(dataBucket)
  load = calculateAveragePartitionLoad(dataBucket)

  if load > load_threshold_high and arrivalRate > arrivalRate_threshold:
    if dataBucket.partitionCount < max_partitions:
      splitPartition(dataBucket)
      rehashData(dataBucket)
  elif load < load_threshold_low and arrivalRate < arrivalRate_threshold:
    if dataBucket.partitionCount > min_partitions:
      mergePartitions(dataBucket)
      rehashData(dataBucket)
```

**Rationale:** Traditional static partitioning can lead to inefficient resource utilization.  Over-partitioning wastes resources, while under-partitioning causes bottlenecks.  Dynamic adjustment ensures that processing capacity aligns with data stream characteristics, improving performance and scalability.  The partition history in the data divider aids in debugging and performance analysis.
