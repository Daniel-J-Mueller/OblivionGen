## Secure Enclosure - Bio-Authentication & Dynamic Access Profiles

**Concept:** Integrate biometric authentication *with* dynamically generated access profiles based on the virtual machine instances running *within* the enclosure. This moves beyond simple on/off power state locking and granularizes access based on *what* is running, not just *that* something is running. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Biometric Reader Integration:**

*   **Type:** Multi-factor – Fingerprint *and* iris scan. Combined for higher security.
*   **Location:** Integrated into enclosure access door handle.
*   **Data Storage:** Biometric data is *not* stored locally.  A secure enclave on a remote server handles verification against a pre-registered user database. Encrypted communication channel (TLS 1.3 minimum) between enclosure and remote server.
*   **Fallback:** PIN entry as a secondary fallback if biometric scans fail.

**2. Virtual Machine Instance Monitoring:**

*   **Agent:** Lightweight agent running within each VM.  Reports:
    *   VM Instance ID
    *   Running Application/Service (identified by signature/hash)
    *   Data Classification (e.g., “Confidential – Financial Data”, “Public – Web Server”) – configurable per VM.
*   **Communication:** Agent communicates with a central "Access Profile Manager" (APM) via a secure, authenticated channel (e.g., gRPC over TLS).
*   **Heartbeat:** Agent sends regular heartbeat signals to APM.  Loss of heartbeat indicates VM failure/shutdown.

**3. Access Profile Manager (APM):**

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  RBAC defined based on data classification & application type.
*   **Dynamic Profile Generation:** APM generates an “Access Profile” for the enclosure based on the running VMs.  The profile dictates:
    *   Allowed biometric users
    *   Allowed access times (time-based restrictions)
    *   “Override” level – Defines if the access is overridden based on a critical alert.
*   **Enclosure Communication:** APM communicates with the enclosure’s controller via a secure API (RESTful).  Sends updated Access Profile data.

**4. Enclosure Controller Logic:**

*   **Authentication:** Upon access attempt:
    1.  Verify biometric data against remote server.
    2.  Retrieve current Access Profile from APM.
    3.  Check if user is authorized based on the profile.
*   **Override Mechanism:** Critical alerts (e.g., intrusion detection, data breach) trigger an immediate lock-down, *even* for authorized users.
*   **Logging:**  Detailed audit logs of all access attempts, including user ID, timestamp, and authorization status.

**5. Pseudocode - Enclosure Controller Access Check:**

```
function checkAccess(biometricData):
  user = authenticateBiometric(biometricData)
  if user == null:
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  accessProfile = getAccessProfile()

  if accessProfile.overrideActive():
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  if user in accessProfile.allowedUsers():
    return ACCESS_GRANTED
  else:
    return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**6. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Tamper Detection:** Physical tamper sensors on the enclosure to detect unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Remote Management:** Secure remote management interface for configuring and monitoring the enclosure.
*   **Integration with SIEM/SOAR:** Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) systems.
*   **Key Management:** Implement a secure key management system for encrypting sensitive data and communications.
