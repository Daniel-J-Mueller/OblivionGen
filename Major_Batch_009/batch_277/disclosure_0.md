## Dynamic Code Composition via Event-Driven Micro-Function Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the event-driven architecture to not just *execute* existing code, but *compose* new code on-the-fly from a library of reusable micro-functions. This allows for dynamic adaptation to event contexts beyond simple function calls.

**Specs:**

**1. Micro-Function Repository:**

*   **Structure:** A decentralized, version-controlled repository of self-contained, stateless micro-functions. Each function includes:
    *   Unique identifier
    *   Input schema (defined using a standard like JSON Schema or Protocol Buffers)
    *   Output schema
    *   Execution logic (compiled bytecode or interpreted script)
    *   Resource requirements (CPU, memory)
    *   Dependencies (other micro-functions)
    *   Metadata (author, creation date, license)
*   **Discovery:** A metadata service enables searching and discovery of micro-functions based on keywords, input/output types, dependencies, and resource requirements.

**2. Event Orchestration Engine:**

*   **Event Intake:** Receives event messages (as described in the base patent) containing user account identifier and event metadata.
*   **Composition Planning:**
    1.  **Event Analysis:** Analyzes event metadata to determine the *intent* of the event (e.g., "image processing," "data transformation").
    2.  **Graph Construction:** Constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the sequence of micro-functions required to fulfill the intent.  The root node represents the initial event, and leaf nodes represent the desired output.  The engine leverages a knowledge base or machine learning model to determine appropriate function sequences.
    3.  **Resource Allocation:** Estimates resource requirements for each function in the graph and allocates sufficient resources on the virtual compute system.
*   **Dynamic Code Generation:** 
    1.  **Code Snippet Retrieval:** Retrieves the bytecode or script for each micro-function from the repository.
    2.  **Function Wiring:** Dynamically constructs a "glue" layer that connects the retrieved functions based on the graph structure. This involves data type conversion, parameter mapping, and error handling.  The glue layer may utilize a lightweight scripting language (e.g., Lua) or a code generation library.
    3.  **Compilation/Interpretation:**  Compiles (if bytecode) or interprets the combined code to create an executable unit.
*   **Execution & Monitoring:** Executes the composed code on the virtual compute system and monitors its performance (CPU usage, memory consumption, execution time).  Error handling is centralized, allowing for logging and recovery.

**3. Data Flow & Context Propagation:**

*   **Streaming Data:** Data flows between functions as a stream of bytes or objects. 
*   **Context Management:**  A context object is passed between functions, carrying information like user account, event ID, session state, and temporary data. This allows for stateful operations.
*   **Asynchronous Execution:** Functions can be executed asynchronously to improve performance and responsiveness.

**Pseudocode (Orchestration Engine - Simplified):**

```
function orchestrateEvent(eventMessage):
  intent = analyzeEvent(eventMessage)
  executionGraph = planExecution(intent, eventMessage)

  // Retrieve function bytecode and assemble execution plan
  compiledCode = assembleExecution(executionGraph)

  // Execute and monitor
  result = execute(compiledCode, eventMessage)
  monitor(result)

  return result
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Function Discovery:** Use machine learning to recommend relevant micro-functions based on event context and user history.
*   **Self-Optimizing Graphs:** Continuously monitor the performance of execution graphs and automatically adjust them to improve efficiency.
*   **Dynamic Dependency Resolution:**  Handle function dependencies on-the-fly by downloading or instantiating required components as needed.
*   **Versioning and Rollback:**  Maintain a history of execution graphs and allow for rolling back to previous versions in case of errors.
