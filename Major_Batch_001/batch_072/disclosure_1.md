## Dynamic Payment Allocation & Predictive Funding

**Concept:** Expand the ability to split payments across multiple funding sources *proactively*, based on predictive analytics of user spending habits and potential funding source limitations. Not just *during* authorization, but *before* the transaction even initiates.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Funding Engine:**

*   **Data Inputs:** Transaction history (amount, merchant, time), account balances (checking, savings, credit limits), recurring bill schedules, predicted income (based on linked accounts/payroll data – optional, user consent required), merchant category data, user-defined spending rules (e.g., “always use rewards card for gas”).
*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically an LSTM – trained on user spending data to predict upcoming expenses. Incorporate reinforcement learning to optimize allocation strategies over time, maximizing rewards and minimizing overdraft risk.
*   **Output:**  A probability distribution of upcoming expenses and corresponding optimal funding sources.

**2. Pre-Authorization Funding Allocation:**

*   **Trigger:**  System detects a likely upcoming transaction (e.g., user approaches a frequented gas station, a monthly subscription renewal date is approaching).
*   **Process:**
    *   Predictive Funding Engine generates potential funding scenarios.
    *   System presents options to the user *before* the transaction occurs via mobile app/device (e.g., “Upcoming gas purchase. Recommended funding: 60% Rewards Card, 40% Checking Account.  Adjust?”).
    *   User confirms, modifies, or allows auto-allocation.
    *   System pre-allocates funds (e.g., initiates a small transfer from savings to checking if necessary).

**3. Dynamic Adjustment During Transaction:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:**  Monitor transaction amount as it occurs.
*   **Dynamic Allocation Shift:** If actual transaction amount differs from prediction, system dynamically shifts funding sources in real-time, prioritizing available funds and minimizing risk of declined transactions. (e.g., if gas is more expensive than predicted, shift more funding to a higher-limit credit card).
*   **User Notification:**  Notify user of any dynamic adjustments.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION PredictSpending(user_id)
  // Access historical transaction data, account balances, recurring bills
  data = GET_USER_DATA(user_id)
  // Train/Load LSTM model
  model = LOAD_MODEL("spending_predictor")
  // Predict upcoming expenses
  predicted_expenses = model.PREDICT(data)
  RETURN predicted_expenses

FUNCTION AllocateFunds(user_id, transaction_amount)
  predicted_expenses = PredictSpending(user_id)
  // Determine optimal funding sources based on predicted expenses & transaction amount
  funding_sources = OPTIMIZE_ALLOCATION(predicted_expenses, transaction_amount)
  // Present options to user (if applicable)
  DISPLAY_FUNDING_OPTIONS(funding_sources)
  // Confirm funding allocation
  confirmed_allocation = GET_USER_CONFIRMATION()
  RETURN confirmed_allocation

FUNCTION HandleTransaction(transaction_details, funding_allocation)
  // Process transaction using selected funding sources
  transaction_result = PROCESS_PAYMENT(transaction_details, funding_allocation)
  // Monitor transaction in real-time
  realtime_data = MONITOR_TRANSACTION(transaction_result)
  // Dynamically adjust funding sources if needed
  IF realtime_data.amount_differs_from_prediction THEN
    adjusted_allocation = ADJUST_ALLOCATION(realtime_data)
    transaction_result = PROCESS_PAYMENT(transaction_result, adjusted_allocation)
  ENDIF
  RETURN transaction_result
```
