## Aerial Bioluminescence Mapping System

**Concept:** Adapt the laser-based 3D modeling system to detect and map bioluminescent organisms in aerial environments – think fireflies, glowing fungi on trees, even marine bioluminescence reflecting off the ocean surface.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-sensitivity, low-noise EMCCD (Electron-Multiplying Charge-Coupled Device) camera, optimized for low-light detection in the visible spectrum (400-700nm).  Must have adjustable gain and exposure settings.
    *   Narrowband optical filters centered on key bioluminescence emission wavelengths (e.g., 560nm for common firefly species, customizable via software).  Filter wheel to rapidly switch between wavelengths.
    *   Polarization filter to reduce glare from reflected sunlight or artificial light sources.
*   **Light Emitter:**
    *   Replace the pulsed laser with a highly focused, modulated UV/Blue LED array.  The purpose is not illumination but *stimulation* of bioluminescence in organisms that respond to light. Modulation frequency adjustable via software.  Power output controllable.
*   **Navigation & Control:**
    *   UAV equipped with a precision GPS/IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for accurate positioning and orientation.
    *   Real-time flight path planning software enabling autonomous scanning of target areas.  Software allows defining scan altitude, speed, and overlap between scan lines.
    *   Software control system allowing adjustment of LED array modulation frequency and power output, camera settings (gain, exposure, filters), and flight path in real-time.
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    *   High-speed data acquisition system to capture camera images and UAV position/orientation data simultaneously.
    *   Software pipeline for:
        *   Geometric correction of images based on UAV position/orientation.
        *   Image enhancement and noise reduction algorithms tailored for low-light bioluminescence imaging.
        *   Bioluminescence intensity mapping:  Algorithm to quantify bioluminescence intensity at each location within the scan area.
        *   3D reconstruction: Combining intensity data with UAV position data to create a 3D map of bioluminescence distribution.
        *   Species identification (future development): Integration with machine learning algorithms trained on bioluminescence spectra for species-level identification.
*   **Operational Parameters:**
    *   Scan Altitude: 5 – 50 meters (adjustable).
    *   Scan Speed: 0.5 – 5 m/s (adjustable).
    *   Data Storage: Minimum 1 TB SSD for on-board data storage.
    *   Power Source: High-capacity LiPo battery providing at least 30 minutes of flight time.

**Pseudocode for Data Processing Pipeline:**

```
FOR each frame in captured data:
    Correct geometric distortion using UAV position/orientation data.
    Apply noise reduction filter (e.g., median filter).
    Calibrate image based on known light source.
    FOR each pixel in corrected image:
        Calculate bioluminescence intensity.
        IF intensity > threshold:
            Record pixel coordinates and intensity value.
    END FOR
END FOR

Create 3D map by interpolating intensity data between recorded points.
Apply visualization techniques (e.g., color mapping) to represent bioluminescence intensity in 3D space.
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Monitoring firefly populations and habitat health.
*   Mapping bioluminescent fungal distribution in forests.
*   Detecting marine bioluminescence blooms.
*   Environmental monitoring and pollution detection.
*   Search and rescue operations (detecting bioluminescent organisms indicating life).
