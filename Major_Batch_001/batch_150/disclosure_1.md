## Delegated Action Chains & Predictive Authorization

**Concept:** Expand delegation profiles beyond simple permission grants to encompass *chains of actions* and utilize predictive authorization based on observed behavior.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Action Blueprint:**  A structured definition of a multi-step process. Each step specifies an action (read, write, access resource) and any required preconditions/inputs.  Blueprints are created by account owners/administrators.  Example: "Backup Database" – Step 1: Verify storage availability; Step 2: Initiate database dump; Step 3: Transfer to backup location; Step 4: Confirm transfer.
*   **Delegation Chain Profile:** Extends the existing delegation profile to include one or more Action Blueprints.  The profile specifies *which* chains a delegated principal is authorized to execute, not just individual actions.
*   **Behavioral Observer:**  A background process that logs the execution of delegated action chains. It records timestamps, inputs, outputs, and any errors.
*   **Predictive Authorization Engine:** A machine learning model trained on the logged behavioral data. This engine predicts the likelihood of a delegated principal successfully completing a chain *before* authorization is granted.  It considers historical success rates, input data characteristics, and current system state.
*   **Risk Score:** An output of the Predictive Authorization Engine.  Higher scores indicate a higher probability of successful chain execution.  Authorization thresholds can be set dynamically based on risk score.

**II. System Architecture:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** A security principal requests execution of an action chain via a standard API. The request includes chain ID, input data, and delegation profile ID.
2.  **Profile Validation:**  The system verifies that the delegation profile exists and includes the requested action chain.
3.  **Predictive Authorization:**  The Behavioral Observer feeds data to the Predictive Authorization Engine.  The engine calculates a Risk Score.
4.  **Dynamic Threshold Check:** The Risk Score is compared against a dynamically adjusted authorization threshold. This threshold can be modified based on factors like account sensitivity, time of day, or current system load.
5.  **Authorization & Execution:** If the Risk Score exceeds the threshold, authorization is granted, and the action chain is executed.  Execution data is logged by the Behavioral Observer.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** The Behavioral Observer’s logged data continuously retrains the Predictive Authorization Engine, improving its accuracy over time.

**III. Pseudocode (Predictive Authorization Engine):**

```
function calculate_risk_score(chain_id, input_data, historical_data) {
  // Feature Extraction:
  features = extract_features(input_data, historical_data) //e.g., data size, data type, user role, time of day

  // Model Prediction (using a trained ML model - e.g., RandomForest, Neural Network)
  risk_score = model.predict(features)

  return risk_score
}

function extract_features(input_data, historical_data) {
  //Extract relevant data from input data and historical execution logs
  //Examples: data size, number of records processed, user access pattern,
  //resource utilization, frequency of chain executions, error rates
  //Combine and normalize to a standard format
  features = {
    "data_size": input_data.size,
    "user_role": historical_data.user.role,
    "execution_frequency": historical_data.frequency,
    "error_rate": historical_data.error_rate
  }
  return features
}
```

**IV. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Chain Composition:** Allow delegation profiles to include chains *within* other chains, creating complex, nested authorization scenarios.
*   **Adaptive Authorization:** Dynamically adjust delegation permissions based on real-time risk assessment and contextual factors.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Flag potentially malicious behavior based on deviations from expected execution patterns.
*   **Automated Chain Creation:** Use AI to automatically generate Action Blueprints based on common user tasks and system requirements.
