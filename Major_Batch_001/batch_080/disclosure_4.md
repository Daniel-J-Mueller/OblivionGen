## Dynamic Packet Reconstruction for Multi-Path Resilience

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on hierarchical routing and distributing forwarding information. This inspires a system where, instead of *just* distributing information, we actively reconstruct packets at intermediate nodes to utilize diverse paths *even if* the destination address isn’t fully known at that node. This shifts from deterministic routing to probabilistic/adaptive resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Node Architecture Enhancement:**

*   **Packet Fragmentation/Reassembly Module (PFRAM):** Added to each router (all levels). PFRAM doesn't just forward; it *can* split a packet into multiple fragments, each addressed to a different potential next hop.
*   **Probabilistic Path Table (PPT):**  Alongside the standard FIB, each router maintains a PPT.  The PPT isn’t a definitive route; it’s a list of *potential* next hops with associated probabilities. These probabilities can be based on link quality, congestion, historical performance, or even randomly generated 'exploration' values.
*   **Fragment Tracking Table (FTT):**  Each router keeps an FTT to track fragments of a single original packet. This is crucial for reassembly. The FTT will store metadata like fragment ID, original packet ID, expected fragment count, and timestamp.

**2. Packet Handling Process:**

1.  **Incoming Packet:** Router receives a packet.
2.  **FIB Lookup:** Standard FIB lookup is performed first. If a definitive route exists, the packet is forwarded normally.
3.  **PPT Activation:** If *no* definitive route exists in the FIB (or a configurable threshold for path diversity is met), the PPT is consulted.
4.  **Fragment Generation:** The packet is split into *N* fragments (configurable). Each fragment receives a unique fragment ID and the original packet ID.
5.  **Destination Addressing (Fragment Level):** Each fragment is assigned a *probabilistic* destination. The PPT is used to select a potential next hop, and the fragment is addressed accordingly. The destination address may not be the final destination; it could be an intermediate node suggested by the PPT.
6.  **Fragment Forwarding:** Fragments are forwarded along their respective probabilistic paths.
7.  **Fragment Tracking:** The FTT is updated with the fragment's ID, original packet ID, destination, and timestamp.
8.  **Reassembly:** At the final destination (or a designated reassembly point), fragments are collected based on their original packet ID. Fragments are reordered based on sequence number (included in the fragment header) and reassembled into the original packet. If fragments are missing after a timeout, retransmission requests can be sent.

**3. Control Plane Adjustments:**

*   **PPT Population:** The PPT is populated through a combination of:
    *   **Network Monitoring:**  Collect data on link quality, congestion, and latency.
    *   **Historical Data:** Analyze past performance to identify reliable paths.
    *   **Random Exploration:** Introduce a small percentage of randomly selected next hops to discover new paths.
*   **PPT Update Frequency:** The PPT is updated dynamically based on network conditions and performance data.
*   **Control Signal Protocol:** A new control protocol is required to advertise PPT information between routers.

**Pseudocode (Fragment Handling):**

```
Function HandleIncomingPacket(packet):
  fibRoute = LookupFIB(packet.destination)
  if fibRoute != null:
    ForwardPacket(packet, fibRoute)
    return

  if ShouldFragment(packet, diversityThreshold):
    fragments = SplitPacket(packet, numFragments)
    for fragment in fragments:
      nextHop = SelectNextHop(fragment.destination, PPT)
      fragment.nextHop = nextHop
      TrackFragment(fragment)
      ForwardPacket(fragment, nextHop)
  else:
    //Standard handling or drop packet
    ...
```

**Innovation & Potential:**

This approach provides a higher degree of resilience to network failures and congestion. By actively reconstructing packets, the system can dynamically adapt to changing network conditions and utilize diverse paths, even if the optimal path is not known in advance.  The probabilistic nature adds an element of self-discovery, potentially leading to more efficient and robust routing over time. It would require substantial engineering effort, particularly in the development of the new control plane and fragmentation/reassembly logic, but represents a significant departure from traditional routing paradigms.
