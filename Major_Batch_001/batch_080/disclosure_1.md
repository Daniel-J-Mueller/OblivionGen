## Adaptive Granularity Compression & Transmission

**Concept:** Extend the idea of padding to dynamically adjust the compression *level* of storage units *before* transmission, based on network conditions and client capabilities. Instead of just padding to a fixed size, we modulate compression ratios.

**Specs:**

*   **Compression Profiles:** Define a tiered system of compression profiles (e.g., Lossless, Standard, High Compression). Each profile specifies a compression algorithm and target compression ratio.
*   **Network Condition Monitoring:** Storage server continuously monitors network characteristics (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) to assess available throughput.
*   **Client Capability Reporting:** Clients report their decompression capabilities (CPU speed, available memory, supported algorithms) during session setup.
*   **Dynamic Compression Assignment:** Based on network conditions and client capabilities, the storage server dynamically assigns a compression profile to each storage unit *before* transmission. Units likely to bottleneck network transmission receive higher compression; units sent to powerful clients can utilize lower compression, minimizing decompression overhead.
*   **Header Extension:** Extend the network packet header to include:
    *   Compression Profile ID for the storage unit.
    *   Original (uncompressed) size of the storage unit.
    *   Compressed size of the storage unit.
*   **Padding Adjustment:**  Padding is still utilized, but its size is calculated based on the *dynamically chosen* compressed size, not a fixed expectation.
*   **Client-Side Decompression:** Client utilizes the Compression Profile ID from the header to select the appropriate decompression algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Storage Server - Pre-Transmission)**

```
function prepareStorageUnit(storageUnit, clientInfo, networkConditions):
  originalSize = getUncompressedSize(storageUnit)
  compressionProfile = selectCompressionProfile(clientInfo, networkConditions, originalSize)
  compressedStorageUnit = compress(storageUnit, compressionProfile)
  compressedSize = getCompressedSize(compressedStorageUnit)
  paddingSize = calculatePaddingSize(compressedSize, desiredPacketSize) // Based on dynamically compressed size
  paddedStorageUnit = pad(compressedStorageUnit, paddingSize)
  header = createHeader(compressionProfile, originalSize, compressedSize)
  return header, paddedStorageUnit
```

**Pseudocode (Client - Reception)**

```
function receiveStorageUnit(header, paddedStorageUnit):
  compressionProfile = header.compressionProfile
  compressedStorageUnit = extractCompressedData(paddedStorageUnit)
  decompressedStorageUnit = decompress(compressedStorageUnit, compressionProfile)
  return decompressedStorageUnit
```

**Hardware Implications:** Increased computational load on both server (compression selection & execution) and client (decompression). May require hardware acceleration for compression/decompression algorithms.
