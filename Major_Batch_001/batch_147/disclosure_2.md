## Adaptive Authentication via Bioacoustic Resonance

**Concept:** Augment facial/IR dot-pattern authentication with analysis of subtle bioacoustic resonances emitted from a user’s face during attempted authentication. Every person has a unique 'acoustic signature' derived from minute muscle movements, blood flow, and even subtle bone vibrations. This adds a layer of liveness detection *far* beyond what current systems offer – effectively preventing highly sophisticated spoofing attempts.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** A micro-array of highly sensitive MEMS microphones integrated *within* the bezel of a mobile device (phone, tablet, laptop).  Placement is critical – aimed at the cheekbone/jawline region during typical device usage. Minimum of 8 microphones, optimally 16-32.
*   **Excitation Signal:** A low-power, inaudible ultrasonic pulse emitted by a micro-speaker array (integrated alongside microphone array). This 'pings' the user’s facial tissue, generating subtle resonant frequencies.
*   **Signal Processing Unit (DSP):** Dedicated DSP coprocessor for real-time analysis of returned resonant signals.
*   **Resonance Feature Extraction:** DSP analyzes returned signals for frequency, amplitude, and phase characteristics of resonant peaks.  Machine learning algorithms (specifically, a customized recurrent neural network – RNN – architecture) trained on individual user resonance profiles.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** System *requires* confirmation of both visual/IR authentication *and* bioacoustic resonance signature match.  Failure of either factor results in authentication denial.
*   **Enrollment Process:** During initial setup, the system records a baseline bioacoustic resonance profile of the authorized user. Multiple recordings taken under varying conditions (facial expression, head position) to build a robust profile.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The RNN continuously learns and adapts to changes in the user’s bioacoustic profile over time (e.g., due to aging, weight change, facial expression).
*   **Spoofing Detection Enhancement:** System trained to differentiate between genuine resonant signals and synthetic signals generated by spoofing attempts (e.g., high-resolution printed faces, deepfakes). Analysis focuses on subtle temporal variations and harmonic content of resonant signals.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Sequence):**

```
FUNCTION AuthenticateUser()

    // 1. Initiate Visual/IR Authentication (as per existing patent)
    IF VisualIRAuthSuccessful() THEN

        // 2. Initiate Bioacoustic Resonance Capture
        Transmit UltrasonicExcitationSignal()
        CaptureResonanceSignals(microphoneArray)

        // 3. Feature Extraction
        resonanceFeatures = ExtractResonanceFeatures(resonanceSignals)

        // 4. Resonance Profile Matching
        similarityScore = Compare(resonanceFeatures, EnrolledResonanceProfile)

        // 5. Authentication Decision
        IF similarityScore > Threshold AND VisualIRAuthSuccessful() THEN
            RETURN AuthenticationSuccessful()
        ELSE
            RETURN AuthenticationFailed()
        ENDIF
    ELSE
        RETURN AuthenticationFailed()
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION
