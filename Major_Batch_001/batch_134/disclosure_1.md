**Adaptive Document Preview Generation & Contextual Summarization**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

This system aims to dynamically generate previews of attached documents *within* the email client, going beyond static thumbnails or first-page views.  The core is a server-side component that analyses document content *and* the email context (sender, recipients, subject, body text) to prioritize information for the preview.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Email Client Plugin/Extension:**  Intercepts email rendering and handles requests for dynamic previews.  Communicates with the Preview Generation Server.
*   **Preview Generation Server:**  Core logic.  Receives document metadata (location, type) and email context. Uses NLP, document parsing, and potentially image analysis to generate preview content.
*   **Document Access Layer:** Handles retrieving documents from various sources (file system, cloud storage, DMS).
*   **Context Analyzer:**  NLP module that extracts key entities, topics, and sentiment from the email's text.

**III. Preview Generation Logic:**

1.  **Document Type Detection:**  Identifies the document type (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, etc.).
2.  **Contextual Relevance Scoring:**  Uses the Context Analyzer to score sections of the document based on relevance to the email context. For example:
    *   If the email mentions "project budget", sections of the document containing financial data receive higher scores.
    *   If the email is to a specific recipient, sections mentioning that recipient or related projects are prioritized.
    *   Sentiment analysis can be used to highlight sections addressing positive or negative feedback.
3.  **Dynamic Preview Construction:**
    *   Based on relevance scores, the system selects key paragraphs, tables, images, or slides to include in the preview.
    *   The preview is rendered as a visually appealing snippet, potentially with highlights or annotations based on context.
    *   Previews are paginated within the email client.
4.  **Adaptive Resolution:** Preview resolution dynamically adjusts based on screen size, network speed and client hardware.
5.  **Real-time Update:**  Previews are updated when the underlying document changes.

**IV.  Pseudocode (Preview Generation Server):**

```
function generate_preview(document_metadata, email_context) {
  document_type = detect_document_type(document_metadata);
  email_entities = extract_email_entities(email_context);
  document_content = load_document_content(document_metadata);
  relevance_scores = calculate_relevance_scores(document_content, email_entities);
  selected_content = select_top_n_sections(document_content, relevance_scores, n=5);  //Selects top 5 sections
  rendered_preview = render_preview_content(selected_content, document_type);
  return rendered_preview;
}

function calculate_relevance_scores(document_content, email_entities) {
    scores = []
    for section in document_content:
        score = 0
        for entity in email_entities:
            if entity in section:
                score += 1
        scores.append(score)
    return scores
}
```

**V. UI/UX Considerations:**

*   Previews displayed in dedicated panel within email client.
*   Navigation controls for browsing preview pages.
*   Option to open the full document.
*   Visual cues indicating sections highlighted due to contextual relevance.

**VI. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Interactive Previews:** Allow users to highlight text or add notes directly within the preview.
*   **AI-Powered Summarization:** Generate a short summary of the document based on the email context.
*   **Cross-Document Analysis:**  Identify relationships between multiple attached documents.
*   **Support for Rich Media:** Render previews for videos, audio files, and other multimedia content.
*   **Serverless Architecture:** Deploy the Preview Generation Server as a serverless function to scale efficiently.
