## Dynamic Anomaly Contextualization via Probabilistic Time-Series Graphing

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on identifying anomalies by comparing current data to baseline data using weighted parameters. This is good, but static. We can greatly enhance this by dynamically building a probabilistic ‘context graph’ representing the normal operational state of a system. Instead of fixed baselines and weights, the system learns and adapts its understanding of ‘normal’ in real-time, accounting for complex interdependencies and evolving conditions.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Extraction:**

*   **Input:** Raw telemetry data streams from the virtual machine instance (CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O, disk I/O, application-specific metrics).
*   **Feature Engineering:**  Automated feature extraction using a combination of:
    *   Rolling window statistics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles)
    *   Frequency domain analysis (Fast Fourier Transform – FFT) to identify cyclical patterns.
    *   Differential values (rate of change) to capture trends.
*   **Normalization:**  Data normalization (e.g., Z-score normalization) to ensure features are on a comparable scale.

**2. Probabilistic Context Graph Construction:**

*   **Graph Nodes:** Each extracted feature represents a node in the graph.
*   **Edge Weights:**  Edges between nodes represent statistical dependencies (correlation, mutual information, Granger causality) calculated over a sliding time window.  Edge weights are probabilistic, representing the *strength* of the dependency and a confidence interval.
*   **Bayesian Network Structure Learning:** Employ a Bayesian network learning algorithm (e.g., Hill-Climbing, Tabu Search) to determine the optimal graph structure based on the observed data. The algorithm will discover causal relationships between features.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** The graph structure and edge weights are updated continuously as new data arrives.  A forgetting factor can be used to discount older data, allowing the graph to adapt to changing system behavior.

**3. Anomaly Detection:**

*   **Probabilistic Inference:**  Given the current values of observed features, use probabilistic inference (e.g., Belief Propagation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to estimate the expected values of *all* features in the graph.
*   **Anomaly Score:** Calculate an anomaly score for each feature based on the difference between its observed value and its expected value (from probabilistic inference).  Use a robust error metric (e.g., Huber loss) to mitigate the impact of outliers.
*   **Contextual Anomaly Scoring:**  Rather than simply comparing individual feature anomalies, compute a *system-level* anomaly score by aggregating the individual feature anomalies, weighted by their importance in the graph (determined by centrality measures such as PageRank or betweenness centrality).
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:**  Dynamically adjust the anomaly threshold based on the distribution of anomaly scores over time.  Use a statistical process control (SPC) chart (e.g., Shewhart chart) to detect shifts in the anomaly score distribution.

**4. Implementation Details:**

*   **Programming Languages:** Python with libraries such as `pgmpy` (for probabilistic graphical models), `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.
*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) to store raw telemetry data and derived features.
*   **Scalability:**  Distributed processing framework (e.g., Apache Spark, Dask) to handle large-scale data streams and parallelize probabilistic inference.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```python
# Assuming 'context_graph' is the learned probabilistic graphical model
# and 'current_data' is the vector of current telemetry values

def detect_anomaly(context_graph, current_data):

  # 1. Probabilistic Inference
  predicted_values = context_graph.infer(current_data)

  # 2. Calculate Anomaly Scores for each feature
  anomaly_scores = []
  for i in range(len(current_data)):
    anomaly_score = huber_loss(current_data[i], predicted_values[i])
    anomaly_scores.append(anomaly_score)

  # 3. Calculate System-Level Anomaly Score
  system_anomaly_score = weighted_sum(anomaly_scores, centrality_measures)

  # 4. Compare to Adaptive Threshold
  if system_anomaly_score > adaptive_threshold:
    return True  # Anomaly Detected
  else:
    return False # No Anomaly
```

This system creates a far more nuanced understanding of ‘normal’ behavior, allowing it to detect anomalies that might be missed by traditional static thresholding methods. The probabilistic nature of the model allows it to quantify uncertainty and provide confidence intervals for anomaly detections.
