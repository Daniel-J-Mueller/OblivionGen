## Acoustic Mapping Drone Swarm with Dynamic Beamforming

**System Overview:**

A swarm of small, lightweight drones equipped with ultrasonic transducers, capable of collaboratively creating real-time 3D acoustic maps of environments. Unlike the patent’s focus on individual vehicle airspeed determination, this system emphasizes *collective sensing* and environmental reconstruction.

**Drone Specifications (per unit):**

*   **Size:** 15cm diameter, 8cm height.
*   **Weight:** 300g.
*   **Propulsion:** Quadcopter configuration with shrouded propellers for safety and noise reduction.
*   **Power:** Lithium Polymer battery, 20-minute flight time.
*   **Processing:** Embedded ARM Cortex-A72 processor with a dedicated DSP for signal processing.
*   **Communication:** 802.11ax Wi-Fi for inter-drone communication and data relay to a base station.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   8 x Ultrasonic Transducers (20-40kHz) arranged in a spherical array. Each transducer is independently controllable in phase and amplitude.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for localization and orientation.
    *   Barometric Altimeter for altitude measurement.

**System Operation:**

1.  **Swarm Deployment:** A swarm of drones is deployed into the target environment. Initial swarm formation is pre-programmed or dynamically established.
2.  **Collaborative Acoustic Emission:** Each drone emits a series of short ultrasonic pulses. The pulses are synchronized across the swarm to minimize interference.
3.  **Dynamic Beamforming:** Each drone utilizes its transducer array to perform dynamic beamforming. This allows the drones to steer the ultrasonic beam in different directions without physically moving the transducers. The beamforming parameters are adjusted in real-time based on the swarm’s collective understanding of the environment.
4.  **Time-of-Flight Measurement:** The time it takes for the ultrasonic signal to travel from the drone to an object and return is measured. This time-of-flight data is used to calculate the distance to the object.
5.  **Data Fusion & Map Creation:** The time-of-flight data from all drones is fused using a distributed Kalman filter. This filter estimates the 3D positions of all objects in the environment and creates a real-time 3D acoustic map.
6. **Acoustic Signature Analysis:** Beyond simple distance mapping, signal processing algorithms analyze the *returning* ultrasonic signals to identify material properties and classify objects based on their acoustic signatures.

**Pseudocode (Data Fusion – Simplified):**

```
// Each drone's process
function process_data() {
    // Transmit ultrasonic pulse
    transmit_pulse();

    // Receive reflected signal
    reflected_signal = receive_signal();

    // Calculate Time of Flight
    tof = calculate_tof(reflected_signal);

    // Estimate distance
    distance = tof * speed_of_sound / 2;

    // Send distance and drone location to central coordinator
    send_data(distance, drone_location);
}

//Central Coordinator Process
function coordinate_swarm(){
  data_points = receive_all_drone_data();
  filtered_points = apply_kalman_filter(data_points);
  create_3d_map(filtered_points);
  broadcast_map_updates_to_drones();
}
```

**Innovation Points:**

*   **Collective Sensing:** Moves beyond individual vehicle measurements to leverage the power of a swarm.
*   **Dynamic Beamforming:** Enables precise acoustic mapping without physical drone movement.
*   **Acoustic Signature Analysis:** Extends the capability beyond simple 3D mapping to identify materials and classify objects.
*   **Real-time 3D Mapping:** Provides a dynamic, up-to-date representation of the environment.
