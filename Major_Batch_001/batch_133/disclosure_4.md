## Adaptive Projection Mapping via Distributed Device Network

**Concept:** Expand the "fling" concept beyond device-to-device transfer of *content* and instead utilize the image recognition and proximity detection to facilitate *dynamic projection mapping* onto arbitrary surfaces in the environment, using a network of participating devices.

**Core Idea:** The system identifies surfaces (walls, tables, even people) in the environment, and allows users to "fling" instructions to those surfaces, triggering dynamic projection mapping. The "fling" gesture isnâ€™t about sending a file, but sending a *request* for visual augmentation. This utilizes a distributed network of devices - the original flinging device, plus any nearby devices with projection capabilities (phones, tablets, smart speakers with pico-projectors, dedicated ambient displays).

**System Specs:**

*   **Device Roles:**
    *   **Initiator:** The device performing the "fling" gesture.  Responsible for gesture recognition, surface identification (assisted by network), and instruction transmission.
    *   **Projector:** Any device with projection capabilities within the network.  Receives projection instructions and renders/projects the content.
    *   **Network Coordinator:** A designated device (or a distributed consensus algorithm) that manages the network, distributes instructions, and handles resource allocation.
*   **Surface Identification:**
    *   Utilize the camera to capture the environment.
    *   Employ computer vision algorithms to identify planar surfaces and estimate their geometry.
    *   The Network Coordinator maintains a dynamic map of identified surfaces, accessible to all devices.
    *   ARKit/ARCore integration for more accurate surface tracking.
*   **Instruction Set:**  (Defined as JSON objects)
    *   `target_surface_id`: Unique identifier for the target surface.
    *   `instruction_type`: (e.g., "image", "video", "text", "animation", "dynamic_data")
    *   `content_url`: URL or local path to the content.
    *   `transform_matrix`:  Matrix defining the position, rotation, and scale of the content on the surface. (Calculated by the system automatically, or overridden by the user).
    *   `animation_parameters`:  Parameters for animating the content (e.g., speed, direction, easing).
    *   `trigger`: Conditions that trigger content changes (e.g., proximity of a user, specific voice command).
*   **"Fling" Gesture Refinement:**
    *   The direction of the fling determines the *initial* target surface. (Raycasting from the device onto the environment).
    *   The *speed* of the fling determines the *intensity* or *size* of the projection.
    *   A "hold" gesture *after* the fling allows the user to refine the target surface or adjust the projection parameters.
*   **Dynamic Content Sources:**
    *   Integration with real-time data feeds (weather, news, stock prices).
    *   User-generated content via a companion app.
    *   Procedural content generation based on environmental data.
*   **Network Communication:**
    *   Utilize a low-latency communication protocol (e.g., WebSockets, multicast).
    *   Implement a robust error handling mechanism to ensure reliable communication.

**Pseudocode (Initiator):**

```
function onFlingGesture(gestureData) {
    surfaceID = raycast(gestureData.direction) // Identify target surface
    instruction = {
        target_surface_id: surfaceID,
        instruction_type: "image",
        content_url: "user_selected_image.jpg",
        transform_matrix: calculateTransformMatrix(surfaceID)
    }
    sendInstructionToNetwork(instruction)
}

function sendInstructionToNetwork(instruction) {
    // Broadcast instruction to Network Coordinator
    // Network Coordinator distributes to appropriate Projector
}

function calculateTransformMatrix(surfaceID) {
    // Retrieve surface geometry from Network Coordinator
    // Calculate transform matrix to align content with surface
}
```

**Pseudocode (Projector):**

```
function onReceiveInstruction(instruction) {
    // Retrieve surface geometry from Network Coordinator
    // Apply transform matrix to content
    // Render and project content onto surface
}
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Interactive Projections:** Users can interact with projections using gestures or voice commands.
*   **Collaborative Projections:** Multiple users can contribute to a single projection.
*   **Ambient Intelligence:** The system learns user preferences and adapts the projections accordingly.
*   **Environmental Storytelling:** Create immersive experiences by projecting narratives onto the environment.
