## Adaptive Resource Allocation via Predictive Multi-Tenancy

**Concept:** Expand the concept of predicting request periodicity to proactively *shape* the virtual machine instances themselves, creating tailored "tenants" within VMs based on anticipated workload profiles. This moves beyond simply adding/removing VMs, to dynamically partitioning existing resources.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Workload Profile Database:** Maintain a database storing workload profiles. Each profile includes:
    *   Expected CPU usage pattern (time-series data).
    *   Expected memory usage pattern (time-series data).
    *   Expected I/O pattern (time-series data).
    *   Dependencies (libraries, specific OS versions).
    *   Priority Level (determines resource allocation weighting).

2.  **VM Partitioning Engine:** A component residing within the virtual compute system responsible for dynamically partitioning VMs. This engine utilizes a lightweight containerization technology (e.g., Kata Containers or gVisor) *within* existing VMs.

3.  **Predictive Partitioning Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Incoming code execution requests, associated execution parameters, historical workload data.
    *   Process:
        *   Identify requests exhibiting periodicity (as in the original patent).
        *   Match incoming requests to existing workload profiles, or create new profiles if no match exists.
        *   Based on the matched profile, dynamically create/resize containers within a target VM.
        *   Allocate CPU cores, memory, and I/O bandwidth to each container based on the profile’s requirements.
        *   Prioritize containers based on the workload profile’s priority level.
    *   Output: Container configurations, resource allocations.

4.  **Dynamic Resource Rebalancing:**
    *   Monitor container resource usage in real-time.
    *   If a container’s resource requirements deviate significantly from its profile, dynamically adjust its allocated resources (within predefined limits).
    *   If resources are consistently underutilized, consolidate containers into fewer VMs.

5. **Resource 'Shadowing'**: Before a new tenant/container is fully established, pre-allocate a minimal 'shadow' resource footprint. This allows for almost instantaneous instantiation.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Partitioning Algorithm):**

```
function predict_and_partition(request, parameters):
  profile = find_matching_profile(request, parameters)

  if profile == null:
    profile = create_new_profile(request, parameters)

  vm = select_target_vm(profile) # Based on capacity, proximity, etc.

  container = create_container(vm, profile)

  allocate_resources(container, profile)

  set_priority(container, profile.priority)

  return container
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Virtualized compute infrastructure (e.g., KVM, Xen, VMware).
*   Lightweight containerization technology (Kata Containers, gVisor).
*   Monitoring and metrics collection tools (Prometheus, Grafana).
*   Machine learning algorithms for workload profile creation and prediction.
*   A distributed database for storing workload profiles and historical data.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased resource utilization.
*   Reduced latency for periodic requests.
*   Improved scalability and elasticity.
*   Enhanced security through container isolation.
*   Cost savings due to efficient resource allocation.
