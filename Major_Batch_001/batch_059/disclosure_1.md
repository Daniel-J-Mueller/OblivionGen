## Dynamic Calibration & Predictive Re-Alignment System

**Concept:** Extend the system's ability to understand camera fields of view beyond static mapping. Implement a predictive re-alignment system based on identified object trajectories and anticipated movement, effectively "pre-steering" cameras to maintain optimal tracking *before* misalignment occurs.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-precision inertial measurement unit (IMU) integrated into each camera housing. Provides real-time data on camera orientation and minor vibrations.
    *   Optional: Low-power radar/LiDAR module integrated with each camera for coarse positional tracking of primary objects.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Trajectory Prediction Engine:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical object movement data. Inputs: object ID, current velocity, acceleration, direction, and environmental factors (e.g., wind speed, known pedestrian flow patterns). Output: Predicted trajectory for the next 5-10 seconds.
    *   **Field of View (FOV) Anticipation Module:** Uses the predicted trajectory to calculate the anticipated impact on FOV. Determines when a critical object is likely to move outside the current FOV.
    *   **Micro-Adjustment Controller:** Sends commands to the camera's pan/tilt mechanism (or digital image correction algorithms) to proactively adjust the FOV based on the FOV Anticipation Module’s output. Micro-adjustments – sub-pixel shifts – prioritize smooth tracking.
    *   **Calibration Drift Compensation:**  The IMU data is continuously fused with visual data (detected matrix barcodes, feature tracking) to refine the camera's internal calibration parameters. This accounts for thermal drift, mechanical wear, and minor impacts.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Flag incidents where the predicted trajectory deviates significantly from actual observed movement. This could indicate unexpected obstacles, system failures, or malicious activity.

**Pseudocode (Micro-Adjustment Controller):**

```
FUNCTION adjust_camera(camera_id, predicted_trajectory, time_horizon)

    // 1. Calculate predicted object position at time_horizon
    predicted_position = calculate_position(predicted_trajectory, time_horizon)

    // 2. Determine if predicted_position is outside current FOV
    IF predicted_position OUTSIDE FOV THEN

        // 3. Calculate necessary pan/tilt adjustment
        adjustment_vector = calculate_adjustment(predicted_position, current_FOV)

        // 4. Apply micro-adjustment to camera pan/tilt mechanism
        apply_adjustment(camera_id, adjustment_vector)

        // 5. Log adjustment event
        log_event("Camera adjusted for trajectory prediction", camera_id, adjustment_vector)

    ENDIF

END FUNCTION
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond *reactive* alignment (detecting misalignment and correcting it) to *proactive* alignment.  By predicting movement and adjusting FOV *before* misalignment occurs, it significantly improves tracking accuracy, reduces latency, and enables more robust surveillance in dynamic environments.  The combination of IMU data and trajectory prediction offers a more reliable and accurate calibration system than relying solely on visual data.
