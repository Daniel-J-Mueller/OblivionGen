**Dynamic Attribute Weighting based on Temporal Context**

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on attribute-value tuples for recommendations. This builds on that by dynamically adjusting the *weight* of those attributes based on the *time* of day, day of the week, season, or even current events.  Instead of static attribute importance, the system learns which attributes are most relevant at specific times.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Temporal Data Integration:** The system will ingest external temporal data feeds:
    *   Time of day (hour, minute)
    *   Day of week (Monday-Sunday)
    *   Calendar data (holidays, events) – via API integration with calendar services.
    *   Trending news/event data – via API integration with news aggregators and social media trends.
2.  **Attribute-Temporal Relationship Matrix:**  A matrix will be constructed where rows represent attribute-value tuples, and columns represent time ‘slices’ (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).  Each cell will store a weight representing the correlation between that attribute-value tuple and that time slice.
3.  **Weight Calculation:**
    *   **Initial Weights:** Start with equal weights for all attribute-value tuples at each time slice.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to dynamically adjust weights.  
        *   **State:**  (User ID, Current Time Slice, Attribute-Value Tuple).
        *   **Action:** Increase/Decrease/Maintain weight for that attribute-value tuple.
        *   **Reward:**  Based on user interaction with the recommendation (click-through rate, purchase, rating).  Positive reward for positive interaction, negative for negative interaction.
4.  **Recommendation Algorithm Modification:**
    *   The existing recommendation algorithm will be modified to incorporate the time-dependent attribute weights.
    *   The score for an item will be calculated as a weighted sum of its attribute-value tuples, using the weights determined by the Attribute-Temporal Relationship Matrix.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Score Calculation):**

```
function calculate_item_score(item, user, current_time):
  score = 0
  for attribute_value_tuple in item.attribute_value_tuples:
    weight = get_attribute_temporal_weight(attribute_value_tuple, current_time)
    user_interest = get_user_interest(user, attribute_value_tuple)
    score += weight * user_interest
  return score
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AttributeTemporalMatrix`: 2D array (Attribute-Value Tuple ID, Time Slice ID) -> Weight (float)
*   `UserInterestMap`: (User ID, Attribute-Value Tuple ID) -> Interest Score (float)

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The AttributeTemporalMatrix may become large. Consider using sparse matrix representations.
*   Caching of frequently accessed weights to reduce latency.
*   Distributed training of the reinforcement learning model to handle large datasets.
