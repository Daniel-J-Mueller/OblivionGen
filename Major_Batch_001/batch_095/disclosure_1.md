## Dynamic Log Data Obfuscation via Predictive Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the existing data leakage prevention by *proactively* obfuscating sensitive data in logs *before* it's even written, based on predictive analysis of ongoing data flows and learned sensitivity patterns. This differs from simply blocking or redacting after detection.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component: Sensitivity Prediction Engine (SPE)**

*   **Input:** Real-time data streams (network traffic, application logs, system calls).  Metadata associated with data (user ID, process ID, timestamp, source/destination IP).
*   **Processing:**  Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical data to predict the *likelihood* of sensitive data appearing in the current data stream. The LSTM will learn sequential patterns and contextual clues that indicate sensitivity.  Features used for training will include:
    *   Data type (e.g., credit card number, SSN, medical record).
    *   Data format (regex patterns).
    *   Source application/service.
    *   User role/permissions.
    *   Time of day/week.
    *   Network location.
*   **Output:** A “Sensitivity Score” (0-100) for each data element.  Higher scores indicate a greater probability of containing sensitive information.

**2. Component: Dynamic Obfuscation Module (DOM)**

*   **Input:** Data stream, Sensitivity Score from SPE.
*   **Processing:** Applies obfuscation techniques *proportionally* to the Sensitivity Score.  The level of obfuscation is configurable and can include:
    *   **Score 0-30:** No obfuscation.  Data is logged as-is.
    *   **Score 31-60:**  Partial masking (e.g., replacing characters with ‘X’ or asterisks). The degree of masking is proportional to the score.
    *   **Score 61-90:** Tokenization – replacing sensitive data with a unique, non-identifiable token.  A mapping table stores the relationship between tokens and original data. This mapping is securely stored and access-controlled.
    *   **Score 91-100:** Full redaction – removing the data entirely.
*   **Output:** Obfuscated data stream.

**3. Component: Token Management System (TMS)**

*   **Function:** Securely stores and manages tokens generated by the DOM.
*   **Features:**
    *   Token generation and revocation.
    *   Access control – limiting which services/users can access token mappings.
    *   Token lifecycle management (expiration, rotation).
    *   Auditing – tracking token usage.

**Pseudocode (DOM):**

```
function obfuscate_data(data, sensitivity_score):
  if sensitivity_score <= 30:
    return data
  elif sensitivity_score <= 60:
    # Partial masking (example)
    masked_data = mask_characters(data, sensitivity_score)
    return masked_data
  elif sensitivity_score <= 90:
    # Tokenization
    token = generate_token()
    store_token_mapping(token, data)
    return token
  else:
    # Redaction
    return ""

function mask_characters(data, score):
  #Implement logic to mask a percentage of characters 
  #based on the score
  return masked_data
```

**System Integration:**

*   The SPE, DOM, and TMS can be implemented as a microservice architecture.
*   The DOM should be integrated as a filter in the data logging pipeline.
*   Monitoring and alerting should be implemented to track the effectiveness of the system and identify potential false positives or false negatives.
