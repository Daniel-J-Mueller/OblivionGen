## Interactive Product Disassembly & Component Function Visualization

**Concept:** Extend the component-level rating system to incorporate an interactive, layered product disassembly view combined with functional visualization of each component. Instead of simply rating a component, users can virtually "disassemble" the product to view its internal structure and see how each component *works* – either through pre-loaded animations, simulations, or even user-generated content.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Functionality:** Upon selecting a component within the interactive catalog, the system presents a 3D (or high-resolution multi-layered 2D) exploded view of the product, highlighting the selected component and its immediate surrounding parts.

*   **Disassembly Layers:** The exploded view should be structured in layers representing logical assembly groups (e.g., "Power Supply," "Display Assembly," "Chassis"). Users can cycle through these layers to progressively reveal deeper levels of the product.

*   **Component Function Visualization:** Each component, when selected within the disassembly view, triggers one or more of the following:
    *   **Pre-loaded Animations:** Short, looping animations demonstrating the component’s primary function (e.g., a fan spinning, a gear rotating, a circuit board illuminating).
    *   **Simplified Simulations:** Basic physics-based simulations showing the component reacting to virtual forces or inputs (e.g., a shock absorber compressing, a spring extending).
    *   **Data Overlays:** Real-time data displays showing the component’s current status (e.g., temperature, voltage, load).
    *   **User-Generated Content:** Ability for users to upload and share their own animations, simulations, or instructional videos related to the component.  Moderation would be critical here.

*   **Augmented Reality Integration:**  Allow users to project the interactive disassembly view onto a physical product using AR-enabled devices (smartphones, tablets, AR glasses).  This would enable users to visualize internal components without physically disassembling the product.

*   **"Sandbox" Mode:** Provide a “Sandbox” mode where users can virtually manipulate components, connect/disconnect them, and observe the resulting effects on the overall product (within defined constraints).

*   **Component-Level Troubleshooting Guides:** Integrate component-level troubleshooting guides and repair instructions directly into the disassembly view.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function onComponentSelected(componentID):
    // Retrieve component data (3D model, animation, simulation parameters)
    componentData = getComponentData(componentID)

    // Generate Exploded View
    explodedView = generateExplodedView(productModel, componentID)

    // Highlight selected component in exploded view
    highlightComponent(explodedView, componentID)

    // Load animation/simulation
    if (componentData.animation):
        loadAnimation(componentData.animation)
        playAnimation()
    if (componentData.simulation):
        loadSimulation(componentData.simulation)
        runSimulation()

    // Display relevant troubleshooting guides
    displayTroubleshootingGuide(componentID)

    // Update AR view (if enabled)
    updateARView(explodedView, componentID)

function generateExplodedView(productModel, startingComponentID):
    // Determine logical assembly groups
    assemblyGroups = determineAssemblyGroups(productModel)

    // Calculate offsets for each component within assembly groups
    offsets = calculateOffsets(assemblyGroups)

    // Create exploded view based on offsets
    explodedView = createExplodedView(productModel, offsets)

    return explodedView
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **E-commerce:** Enhance product understanding and build customer confidence.
*   **Technical Support:** Provide interactive troubleshooting guides.
*   **Education:**  Create engaging learning materials for engineering and technical fields.
*   **Product Design:**  Visualize and analyze complex assemblies.
