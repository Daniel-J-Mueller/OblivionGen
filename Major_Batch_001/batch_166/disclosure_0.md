## Dynamic Shelf Morphology

**Concept:** Implement a shelf system where individual shelf sections (tiles) can dynamically adjust their height and angle relative to adjacent sections, creating localized “wells” or inclines for item containment and display. This expands beyond simple weight detection to *active* shelf reshaping.

**Specifications:**

*   **Tile Dimensions:** Standardized tile size – 30cm x 30cm x 5cm. Constructed from lightweight, high-strength polymer composite.
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Each tile contains four micro-linear actuators (piezoelectric or miniature stepper motors) positioned at each corner. These actuators control vertical height (±2cm range) and tilt (±5° range) independently.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Each tile integrates:
    *   Strain gauges (as in the original patent) for weight detection.
    *   Capacitive proximity sensors to detect item presence/absence and approximate volume.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - accelerometer and gyroscope – to monitor tile orientation and vibration.
*   **Communication:** Tiles connect via a mesh network (Wi-Fi or dedicated RF protocol) to a central control unit (embedded system or cloud server).
*   **Power:** Wireless power transfer (inductive charging) or low-voltage DC power distributed via the shelf framework.
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    *   **Initial Mapping:** System scans shelf area to create a 3D map of item placement.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Based on item weight, volume, and location, control unit adjusts tile heights and angles to:
        *   Create localized “wells” to contain items and prevent rolling.
        *   Tilt items towards the front of the shelf for better visibility.
        *   Create inclines to facilitate item removal.
        *   Optimize space utilization by dynamically adjusting to item shapes.
    *   **User Interface:** App or web interface allows users to:
        *   Define custom shelf configurations.
        *   Specify item categories (e.g., “fragile”, “heavy”) for automated adjustment.
        *   Manually override automated adjustments.
*   **Framework:** Modular framework with standardized connection points for tiles. Framework provides power and data connectivity.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Initialize: Scan shelf, create 3D map
map = scanShelf()

// Main Loop
while (true) {

    // Detect changes
    changes = detectItemChanges()  // Returns list of added/removed/moved items

    for each item in changes {

        if (item.action == "added") {
            // Calculate optimal tile configuration
            config = calculateTileConfig(item.location, item.weight, item.volume)

            // Adjust tiles
            adjustTiles(config)
        } else if (item.action == "removed") {
            // Re-calculate tile configuration
            config = recalculateTileConfig()

            // Adjust tiles
            adjustTiles(config)
        }
    }
}

function calculateTileConfig(location, weight, volume) {
    // Determine surrounding tiles
    surroundingTiles = getSurroundingTiles(location)

    // Calculate optimal height and angle for each tile based on weight, volume, and surrounding items
    // Use equilibrium principles and spatial reasoning
    for each tile in surroundingTiles {
        tile.height = calculateHeight(weight, volume)
        tile.angle = calculateAngle(weight, volume)
    }

    return tile
}
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrate haptic actuators into tiles to provide tactile confirmation of adjustments.
*   **Thermal Regulation:** Incorporate micro-cooling/heating elements into tiles for temperature-sensitive items.
*   **Augmented Reality Integration:**  Project AR overlays onto the shelf to highlight item locations and provide interactive information.
*   **AI-Powered Optimization:** Train a machine learning model to predict item placement and optimize shelf configuration in real-time.
