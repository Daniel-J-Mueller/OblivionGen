## Adaptive Error Prediction & Pre-emptive Link Switching

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the idea of tracing link errors but shifts from *reactive* error location to *proactive* error prediction and mitigation. It leverages machine learning to anticipate link failures *before* they manifest as detectable errors, and implements a pre-emptive link switching mechanism.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Telemetry Collection Module:**
    *   Gathers not only error counts (as in the source patent) but also a broader range of network interface statistics: packet loss, latency, jitter, signal strength (where applicable), utilization, and temperature.
    *   Data is collected from all network devices in the fabric.
    *   Data is time-stamped and tagged with interface and device identifiers.

2.  **Machine Learning Engine:**
    *   Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical telemetry data.
    *   The LSTM learns the temporal dependencies between different telemetry metrics and predicts the probability of a link failure within a defined timeframe (e.g., next 5, 15, 30 minutes).
    *   The model outputs a “risk score” for each network link, indicating the likelihood of failure.
    *   Continuous retraining of the model with new data is crucial.
    *   Anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual telemetry patterns which may indicate impending failure, even if not captured by the RNN.

3.  **Pre-emptive Link Switching Module:**
    *   Monitors the risk scores generated by the ML Engine.
    *   When a link’s risk score exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the module initiates a pre-emptive switch to a redundant link (if available). This switch occurs *before* any errors are detected.
    *   The module employs a path calculation algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra’s algorithm, ECMP) to identify the optimal redundant path.
    *   A “graceful switch” mechanism minimizes disruption to traffic. This may involve briefly duplicating traffic across both links before fully switching over.
    *   If no redundant link is available, the module raises an alert and initiates diagnostic procedures.

4.  **Validation & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Any pre-emptive switch is logged, along with the associated telemetry data and risk score.
    *   After the switch, the system monitors the performance of the new link and the original link (if still active) to validate the prediction.
    *   If the prediction was accurate (i.e., the original link would have failed), the ML Engine receives positive feedback, strengthening its predictive capabilities. If the prediction was false positive, the ML Engine adjusts its model to reduce similar false alarms in the future.

**Pseudocode (ML Engine - Prediction):**

```
function predict_link_failure(link_id, telemetry_data):
  // telemetry_data is a time-series of metrics for the link
  // (e.g., error counts, latency, utilization)

  // 1. Preprocess telemetry data: normalize, scale, handle missing values
  processed_data = preprocess(telemetry_data)

  // 2. Input processed data into the LSTM model
  predicted_risk_score = lstm_model.predict(processed_data)

  // 3. Compare risk score to threshold
  if predicted_risk_score > risk_threshold:
    return True // High risk of failure
  else:
    return False // Low risk of failure
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources for ML training and real-time prediction. GPUs are highly recommended.
*   Requires a high-bandwidth, low-latency network infrastructure to support telemetry data collection and control signaling.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced network downtime and improved service availability.
*   Proactive mitigation of link failures before they impact users.
*   Enhanced network resilience and stability.
*   Data-driven insights into network health and performance.
