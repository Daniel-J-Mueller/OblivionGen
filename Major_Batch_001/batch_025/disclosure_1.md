## Adaptive Symbol Weighting for Predictive Keyboard Assistance

**Concept:** Extend the error-reduction heuristics to actively *shape* the predictive keyboard experience, weighting symbol suggestions based not only on recent errors, but also on user-specific biomechanical tendencies and environmental factors.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Profiling:**

1.  **Biomechanical Sensor Integration:** Integrate data from device sensors (touchscreen pressure, accelerometer, gyroscope) to detect subtle user movements *during* typing. Capture:
    *   Finger velocity & acceleration.
    *   Contact area & pressure distribution.
    *   Device orientation & stability.
2.  **Typographical Error Logging:**  Record all user input errors (substitutions, omissions, additions) with timestamps.
3.  **Environmental Data Collection:**  Access (with user permission) external data:
    *   Ambient lighting levels (via device camera).
    *   Device temperature (potential indicator of hand sweat/grip).
    *   Background noise levels (potential distraction indicator).
4.  **User Attribute Mapping:** Associate user profiles with:
    *   Dominant hand.
    *   Keyboard layout preference (QWERTY, AZERTY, etc.).
    *   Preferred writing style (formal, informal).

**II.  Dynamic Symbol Weighting Algorithm:**

1.  **Baseline Symbol Probability:** Assign initial probabilities to all symbols based on language model and common usage.
2.  **Error-Based Weight Adjustment:**  As per the source patent, negatively bias symbol probabilities contributing to recent errors.  *However*, scale the bias reduction based on:
    *   **Error Severity:**  More egregious errors (e.g., substituting 'e' for 't') incur a larger weight reduction.
    *   **Error Frequency:**  Frequent errors indicate a more persistent issue, leading to a sustained weight reduction.
3.  **Biomechanical Weight Adjustment:** 
    *   Analyze sensor data to identify patterns in user typing behavior.  For example:
        *   If the user consistently overshoots/undershoots a specific key, slightly increase the probability of adjacent keys.
        *   If the user exhibits rapid, jerky movements, prioritize larger, more easily-targeted keys.
        *   If the user applies inconsistent pressure, reduce the probability of keys requiring precise control.
    *   Create a "biomechanical profile" for each user, storing these weighting adjustments.
4.  **Environmental Weight Adjustment:**
    *   **Lighting:**  In low-light conditions, prioritize keys with distinct visual shapes.
    *   **Temperature/Sweat:** Adjust for potential slippage by favoring larger keys or reducing the sensitivity of touch input.
    *   **Noise:** Increase the prominence of haptic feedback to compensate for auditory distractions.
5.  **Dynamic Combination:**  Combine error-based, biomechanical, and environmental weighting adjustments using a weighted sum.  Allow the weights to be adjusted via user preference.

**III. Predictive Keyboard Implementation:**

1.  **Real-time Weight Calculation:**  Calculate symbol weights dynamically as the user types.
2.  **Suggestion Ranking:**  Rank predictive keyboard suggestions based on weighted symbol probabilities.
3.  **Adaptive Keyboard Layout:**  Optionally, dynamically adjust the keyboard layout to emphasize frequently used or easily accessible keys.  (e.g., slightly enlarge preferred keys).
4.  **User Feedback Mechanism:**  Allow users to override suggestions or provide explicit feedback on the accuracy of predictions.  Use this feedback to refine the weighting algorithm.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_symbol_weight(symbol, user_profile, current_context, sensor_data, environmental_data) {
  base_weight = get_base_probability(symbol, current_context);
  error_weight = adjust_for_recent_errors(symbol, user_profile);
  biomechanical_weight = adjust_for_biomechanical_tendencies(symbol, sensor_data);
  environmental_weight = adjust_for_environmental_factors(symbol, environmental_data);

  final_weight = (base_weight * w1) + (error_weight * w2) + (biomechanical_weight * w3) + (environmental_weight * w4);

  return final_weight;
}
```

Where `w1`, `w2`, `w3`, and `w4` are adjustable weights.
