## Adaptive Bus Fabric with Dynamic Endpoint Reconfiguration

**Specification:** A reconfigurable interconnect fabric enabling dynamic attachment and detachment of functional units without system interruption.

**Core Concept:** Building upon the adapter module’s address-based routing, extend the system to support “virtual endpoints”. Instead of fixed connections, endpoints are represented by software-defined address ranges. The fabric dynamically maps these address ranges to physical functional units, enabling reconfiguration *during* operation.

**Components:**

*   **Reconfigurable Adapter Module (RAM):** An enhanced adapter module with the following additions:
    *   **Virtual Address Table (VAT):** A memory-mapped table storing mappings between virtual addresses (logical endpoint addresses) and physical endpoint addresses.  Managed by software.
    *   **Endpoint State Machine (ESM):**  Controls the physical connection/disconnection of endpoints.  Handles handshaking and signal integrity during reconfiguration.
    *   **Dynamic Routing Engine (DRE):**  Uses the VAT to translate access requests to the correct physical endpoint.
*   **Fabric Controller (FC):** A centralized unit responsible for:
    *   Managing the VAT.
    *   Orchestrating endpoint reconfiguration.
    *   Monitoring fabric health.
*   **Functional Units (FU):** The components that attach to the fabric (microprocessors, memory, peripherals, etc.). Each FU presents a standardized interface to the fabric.

**Operation:**

1.  **Endpoint Registration:**  When a FU powers on, it registers its capabilities and desired address range with the FC. The FC allocates a virtual address range and updates the VAT.
2.  **Normal Operation:**  The master module issues a bus transaction with a virtual address. The RAM’s DRE consults the VAT, resolves the virtual address to a physical address, and forwards the transaction.
3.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration:**
    *   The FC determines that a FU needs to be replaced or moved.
    *   The FC updates the VAT to re-map the virtual address to the new FU.
    *   The ESM initiates a controlled handover, ensuring data integrity and minimal disruption.
    *   Old FU is deactivated, new FU is activated.

**Pseudocode (DRE – Dynamic Routing Engine):**

```
function routeTransaction(busTransaction, virtualAddress) {
  physicalAddress = lookupAddress(virtualAddress); // Access VAT
  if (physicalAddress != NULL) {
    // Forward transaction to physicalAddress
    transmitTransaction(busTransaction, physicalAddress);
  } else {
    // Handle invalid address (e.g., log error, return error code)
    logError("Invalid virtual address: " + virtualAddress);
  }
}

function lookupAddress(virtualAddress) {
  // Access VAT (Virtual Address Table)
  // Return physical address associated with virtual address
  // If virtual address is not found, return NULL
}

function transmitTransaction(busTransaction, physicalAddress) {
  // Transmit bus transaction to specified physical address
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Hot-Swap Capability:**  Functional units can be added or removed without system downtime.
*   **Increased Flexibility:**  System configuration can be dynamically adjusted to meet changing demands.
*   **Improved Fault Tolerance:**  Failed functional units can be automatically bypassed or replaced.
*   **Simplified System Integration:**  New functional units can be easily integrated into the system.
