## Mobile Robotics & Dynamic Workspace Reconfiguration

**Concept:** A dynamically reconfigurable workspace for automated mobile robots, incorporating a network of modular, height-adjustable barriers and a ceiling-mounted robotic arm system for localized, temporary load support.

**Specification:**

**1. Modular Barrier System ("FlexiGuard"):**

*   **Components:** Interlocking, hexagonal barrier modules constructed from lightweight aluminum alloy. Each module is 60cm edge-to-edge.
*   **Actuation:** Each module incorporates a small linear actuator allowing for vertical height adjustment (range: 20cm - 100cm). Controlled wirelessly.
*   **Sensors:** Each module integrates proximity sensors (LiDAR or ultrasonic) to detect obstacles and prevent collisions with mobile robots or personnel.
*   **Connectivity:** Modules communicate via a mesh network (WiFi or Bluetooth) to coordinate movements and create dynamic workspaces.
*   **Power:** Wireless inductive charging or low-voltage DC power distributed through the interlocking connections.
*   **Locking Mechanism:** Each module features a magnetic locking mechanism for securing in a fixed position, adjustable remotely.

**2. Robotic Arm Support System ("SkySupport"):**

*   **Mounting:** Multiple (minimum of 4) six-axis robotic arms are ceiling-mounted, strategically positioned above the primary workspace area.
*   **Payload Capacity:** Each arm capable of lifting and supporting at least 25kg.
*   **End-Effector:** Universal gripper or vacuum suction cup end-effector, configurable for different inventory holder types.
*   **Control System:** Integrated with the FlexiGuard system and mobile robot fleet management software. Capable of coordinated movements with mobile robots.
*   **Safety Features:** Laser scanning obstacle avoidance, emergency stop functionality, and force sensors to prevent damage to inventory holders.

**3. Software Integration:**

*   **Workspace Mapping:** Software tool for creating virtual workspace layouts using the FlexiGuard modules.
*   **Robot Fleet Management:** Integration with existing mobile robot fleet management software for task assignment and coordination.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration Algorithm:** Algorithm for automatically adjusting the FlexiGuard layout and SkySupport positions based on real-time workspace demands and robot task assignments.
*   **Collision Avoidance:** Centralized collision avoidance system integrating data from FlexiGuard sensors, SkySupport sensors, and mobile robot sensors.

**Operation:**

1.  A central control system receives task assignments for mobile robots.
2.  The dynamic reconfiguration algorithm determines the optimal FlexiGuard layout and SkySupport positions to create a safe and efficient workspace for the assigned tasks.
3.  The FlexiGuard modules automatically adjust their heights and positions.
4.  The SkySupport robotic arms position themselves to provide localized load support for inventory holders during transfer or manipulation.
5.  Mobile robots navigate the workspace, guided by the dynamic reconfiguration system and collision avoidance system.
6.  SkySupport arms can temporarily 'catch' a tilted inventory holder, allowing the mobile robot to correct its path or perform more complex maneuvers.
