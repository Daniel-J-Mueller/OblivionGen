## Distributed Lock Choreography with Predictive Pre-emption

**Concept:** Extend the asynchronous lock model to incorporate predictive pre-emption based on historical lock contention and client behavioral patterns. This allows the system to *proactively* release locks from clients exhibiting a high probability of prolonged lock holding or impending failure, minimizing overall system latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Lock Request Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Capture:**  Each client’s lock requests are timestamped and associated with metadata: requested element, queue depth (if applicable), request duration, historical lock contention for the element, client’s average lock hold time, client’s operational status (reported heartbeat/healthcheck).
*   **Behavioral Modeling:**  Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict a client's lock hold time based on captured data. Model updates are performed continuously.
*   **Risk Assessment:**  Assign a 'Risk Score' to each pending lock request, factoring in:
    *   Predicted Lock Hold Time
    *   Current System Load
    *   Historical Contention for the locked element
    *   Client Health (derived from heartbeat/healthcheck)

**2. Proactive Release Mechanism:**

*   **Threshold Configuration:** Define adjustable thresholds for the Risk Score.  When a pending lock's Risk Score exceeds a threshold, the system initiates a pre-emption sequence.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** Instead of abruptly terminating a client's lock hold, the system employs a 'countdown' mechanism.  The client receives asynchronous notifications indicating the impending lock release and a time window to gracefully release the lock.
*   **Automated Rollback:** If the client fails to release the lock within the allotted time window, the system forcefully releases the lock and initiates automated rollback procedures (if configured) to maintain data consistency.

**3.  Asynchronous Communication Protocol Extension:**

*   **‘PreemptionWarning’ Message:** Add a new message type to the asynchronous communication protocol indicating an impending lock preemption. Includes a timestamp for the final release.
*   **‘PreemptionAcknowledgement’ Message:**  Clients must acknowledge the 'PreemptionWarning' message to signal their intent to gracefully release the lock.
*   **‘PreemptionFailure’ Message:** If a client fails to acknowledge or gracefully release the lock, the system transmits a 'PreemptionFailure' message, triggering the forced release.

**4.  Workflow Pseudocode:**

```
// On Client:
function requestLock(element) {
    asyncOperation = sendQueueForLockRequest(element);
    receivePreemptionWarning(asyncOperation) {
        //Attempt to gracefully release lock
        releaseLock(asyncOperation);
        sendPreemptionAcknowledgement(asyncOperation);
    }
}

// On Server:
function processQueueForLockRequest(client, element) {
    asyncOperation = createAsyncOperation();
    insertLockRequest(client, element, asyncOperation);
    sendAsyncOperationReference(client, asyncOperation);
}

function monitorLockRequests() {
    for each lockRequest in pendingLockRequests {
        riskScore = calculateRiskScore(lockRequest);
        if riskScore > threshold {
            sendPreemptionWarning(lockRequest.client, lockRequest.asyncOperation);
            startPreemptionTimer(lockRequest);
        }
    }
}
```

**5.  Scalability Considerations:**

*   Risk score calculation and monitoring should be distributed across multiple server nodes.
*   Preemption timers and rollback procedures must be resilient to node failures.
*   Threshold values should be dynamically adjusted based on system load and performance metrics.
