## Autonomous Wheel Well Cleaning System

**Specification:** Integrate a self-cleaning system *within* the wheel well structure of the intermodal container. This system aims to remove debris (dirt, ice, snow, small rocks) that accumulate during transport, preventing component binding and ensuring smooth wheel deployment/retraction.

**Components:**

*   **High-Pressure Nozzle Array:** A series of small, strategically positioned nozzles directed at critical areas within the wheel well (around the axle, linkage arms, tire contact points).
*   **Reservoir & Pump:** A small, onboard reservoir containing a cleaning fluid (water-glycol mix for freeze protection) and a compact, high-pressure pump. Pump capacity should provide approximately 30 seconds of continuous spray per wheel well.
*   **Microcontroller & Sensors:** A microcontroller unit (MCU) to manage the cleaning cycle. Sensors include:
    *   **Optical Dirt Sensor:** Detects significant debris accumulation.
    *   **Wheel Position Sensor:** Detects whether the wheels are extended or retracted. Cleaning cycles *only* run when retracted.
    *   **Temperature Sensor:** Prevents fluid freezing in extremely cold environments.
*   **Debris Collection System:** A sloped floor within the wheel well guiding dislodged debris towards a small, removable collection tray.
*   **Power Source:** Integrated power tap from containerâ€™s existing auxiliary power system, or a small, rechargeable battery.

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
Initialization:
  Enable sensors
  Monitor wheel position

Main Loop:
  If wheel position == retracted:
    If dirt_sensor_reading > threshold:
      Activate pump
      Spray nozzles for 30 seconds
      Deactivate pump
      Log cleaning event
    End If
  End If
End Loop
```

**Design Considerations:**

*   Nozzle array angles optimized for maximum coverage and minimal fluid waste.
*   Fluid reservoir capacity balanced against weight constraints.
*   Collection tray easily accessible for maintenance.
*   All components designed for durability and resistance to vibration/impact.
*   System activation could be triggered automatically by debris detection or manually via a container interface.
