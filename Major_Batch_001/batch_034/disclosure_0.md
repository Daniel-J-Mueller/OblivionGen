## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Personalized Speech Enhancement

**Concept:** Leveraging multi-device audio analysis to dynamically create 'acoustic zones' within a space, tailored to individual user preferences and speech characteristics. This goes beyond simply *selecting* a device, and instead creates a spatially aware, personalized audio experience.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Distributed Microphone Array:** Utilize existing voice-enabled devices (smart speakers, displays, etc.) as nodes in a distributed microphone array. Each device must have a minimum of 4 microphones.
*   **High-Precision Time Synchronization Module:**  Each device must integrate with a network time protocol (NTP) server with sub-millisecond accuracy. This is critical for beamforming and sound source localization.
*   **Dedicated Edge Processing Unit (per device):** A low-power processor capable of performing real-time signal processing tasks – beamforming, noise reduction, feature extraction.
*   **Central Processing Server:** A server capable of aggregating data from all devices, running advanced algorithms for zone creation and personalization, and distributing updated parameters to edge devices.

**II. Software Modules & Algorithms:**

*   **Beamforming & Sound Source Localization:** Implement a multi-channel beamforming algorithm (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response – MVDR) on each device.  This determines the direction of speech sources and forms directional 'listening beams'.
*   **Acoustic Zone Creation Algorithm:**  The central server employs a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, K-Means) using:
    *   Sound source locations (derived from beamforming).
    *   Detected speech activity (voice activity detection - VAD).
    *   User proximity (determined by device location and/or user identification via voice recognition/biometrics).
    *   Room geometry (inputted via user configuration or inferred through visual scanning using device cameras).
    *   This algorithm creates dynamic "acoustic zones" around individual users or groups.
*   **Personalized Speech Enhancement Profiles:** Each user has a profile storing:
    *   Speech characteristics (pitch, tone, speaking rate) analyzed from previous speech samples.
    *   Preferred noise reduction settings.
    *   Preferred audio equalization settings.
    *   Preferred voice assistant personality.
*   **Adaptive Filtering & Noise Cancellation:**  Apply adaptive filters to each microphone channel, targeting noise sources *outside* the user's acoustic zone.  Filter coefficients are adjusted in real-time based on the detected noise characteristics and the user’s preferences.
*   **Zone Handover Protocol:**  As a user moves between acoustic zones, a seamless handover protocol transfers the audio processing context (user profile, active filters) to the device now closest to the user.

**III. System Operation:**

1.  **Initialization:** Devices connect to the network and synchronize time.  User profiles are loaded.
2.  **Real-time Audio Acquisition:**  Each device continuously captures audio from its microphones.
3.  **Beamforming & Localization:**  Each device performs beamforming and localizes sound sources.
4.  **Data Aggregation:**  Beamforming results and localized sound source data are sent to the central server.
5.  **Acoustic Zone Creation:** The central server creates and dynamically updates acoustic zones.
6.  **Personalization & Filtering:**  The central server distributes personalized filter parameters to the devices within each zone.
7.  **Audio Processing:** Devices apply the personalized filters to the incoming audio stream.
8.  **Voice Assistant Interaction:** Processed audio is sent to the voice assistant for command recognition and response. The assistant adapts its responses based on the user’s profile.
9.  **Zone Handover:**  As the user moves, the system intelligently transfers the audio processing context to the nearest device.

**Pseudocode (Zone Handover):**

```
function ZoneHandover(user_id, current_device, new_device) {
  // 1. Retrieve user profile
  profile = GetUserProfile(user_id);

  // 2. Transfer active filter settings
  TransferFilters(current_device, new_device, profile.filter_settings);

  // 3. Update zone association
  SetUserZone(user_id, new_device);

  // 4. Send confirmation to voice assistant
  SendHandoverConfirmation(new_device);
}
```

This system creates a fluid, personalized audio experience that adapts to the user’s movements and preferences, effectively creating a ‘bubble’ of clear audio within a shared space.  It moves beyond simply choosing *which* device hears the user to *how* that user is heard, providing a significant enhancement to voice assistant interaction and overall audio quality.
