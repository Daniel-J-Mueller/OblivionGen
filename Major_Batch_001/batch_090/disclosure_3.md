## Secure Key Sharding with Biometric Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the trusted execution environment (TEE) security model by not only securing the key *within* the TEE but by *sharding* the key itself, distributing portions to multiple TEEs, and requiring biometric attestation from authorized users *across* those TEEs to reconstruct the key for cryptographic operations. This dramatically increases the attack surface required to compromise the key, as an attacker would need to compromise multiple TEEs *and* spoof biometric data from authorized personnel.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Shard Generation & Distribution:**

*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) to split the secret key into *n* shares.  Each share is encrypted with a unique key derived from the provider's private key and a vendor-specific key.
*   **TEE Distribution:**  Distribute each key share to a separate, independent TEE. These TEEs could be located on different devices (e.g., servers, edge devices, user devices) or virtualized within a secure enclave.
*   **Share Metadata:** Each TEE stores metadata describing its key share: share ID, total number of shares, and the cryptographic hash of the share itself.  This metadata is publicly verifiable.

**2. Biometric Attestation Protocol:**

*   **Authorized User List:** Maintain a list of authorized users associated with the secret key, each with enrolled biometric templates (fingerprint, iris scan, voice print, etc.).
*   **Request Initiation:** When a cryptographic operation is requested, a client initiates a "key reconstruction request".
*   **TEE Challenge:** Each TEE holding a key share issues a biometric challenge to the requesting user. This challenge is cryptographically signed by the TEE using its unique attestation key.
*   **Biometric Submission:** The user provides their biometric data to each TEE.
*   **Biometric Verification:** Each TEE verifies the submitted biometric data against the enrolled template for authorized users.  Verification thresholds can be dynamically adjusted based on risk factors.
*   **Attestation Reporting:** Each TEE reports its biometric verification result (success/failure) to a central "reconstruction coordinator."

**3. Key Reconstruction & Operation:**

*   **Reconstruction Threshold:** The reconstruction coordinator only proceeds with key reconstruction if a minimum number of TEEs (e.g., *k* out of *n*) report successful biometric verification.
*   **Share Aggregation:**  The reconstruction coordinator securely aggregates the key shares from the verifying TEEs.
*   **Key Reconstruction:**  Using the secret sharing scheme, the aggregated shares are used to reconstruct the original secret key *within* the reconstruction coordinator's secure enclave.
*   **Cryptographic Operation:** The reconstructed key is then used to perform the requested cryptographic operation.
*   **Key Destruction:** The reconstructed key is immediately destroyed after the cryptographic operation is completed.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Coordinator):**

```
function reconstructKey(requestID, operationType):
  // 1. Collect Attestation Reports
  attestationReports = collectAttestationReports(requestID)

  // 2. Verify Sufficient Attestations
  if (countSuccessfulAttestations(attestationReports) < requiredAttestations):
    return ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_ATTESTATIONS

  // 3. Gather Key Shares
  keyShares = gatherKeyShares(requestID)

  // 4. Reconstruct Secret Key
  secretKey = reconstructKeyFromShares(keyShares)

  // 5. Perform Cryptographic Operation
  result = performCryptoOperation(secretKey, operationType)

  // 6. Destroy Secret Key
  destroyKey(secretKey)

  return result
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   **TEE Compromise:**  Mitigated by requiring multiple TEE compromises.
*   **Biometric Spoofing:** Requires robust biometric authentication techniques and liveness detection.
*   **Network Security:** Secure communication channels between the client, TEEs, and reconstruction coordinator are essential.
*   **Reconstruction Coordinator Security:**  The reconstruction coordinator must be highly secure and trustworthy.
