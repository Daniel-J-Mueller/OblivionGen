## Adaptive Predictive Congestion Shaping with Dynamic Hash Range Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the existing hash-based routing and congestion detection to *predict* congestion before it manifests, then proactively *shape* traffic flow via dynamic adjustment of hash range assignments, and selective packet duplication for preemptive flow balancing.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Congestion Engine (PCE):**

*   **Input:**  Real-time interface statistics (packet rates, queue depths), historical traffic patterns (stored as time-series data), hash value distributions per interface.
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict interface congestion based on historical data and current traffic load.  The model should output a 'congestion risk score' for each interface.
*   **Output:** Congestion risk score per interface, prediction horizon (time until predicted congestion).

**2. Dynamic Hash Range Partitioning (DHRP) Module:**

*   **Input:** Congestion risk scores from PCE, current hash range assignments for each interface, available bandwidth per interface.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   If the congestion risk score for an interface exceeds a threshold:
        *   Identify the hash ranges currently mapped to that interface.
        *   Dynamically *split* those hash ranges into smaller sub-ranges.
        *   Assign the newly created sub-ranges to *neighboring* interfaces with available bandwidth. Prioritize interfaces with lower load and minimal disruption to established flows.
        *   Record the changes in a hash range mapping table.
*   **Output:** Updated hash range mapping table, list of affected flows.

**3. Selective Packet Duplication (SPD) Module:**

*   **Input:**  Updated hash range mapping table, congestion risk scores, SPD parameters (duplication probability, duplication factor).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   For flows predicted to be impacted by congestion (based on hash range reassignments):
        *   With a probability determined by the congestion risk score and SPD parameters, duplicate the packet.
        *   Route the original packet to its originally assigned interface, and the duplicate to a newly assigned interface (based on the updated hash range mapping).
        *   Implement a mechanism to suppress duplicate packets at the destination (e.g., using a sequence number or timestamp).
*   **Output:**  Duplicated packets routed to alternative interfaces.

**4.  Feedback & Learning Loop:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the DHRP and SPD modules by tracking interface loads, packet loss rates, and flow completion times.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to optimize the DHRP and SPD parameters based on the observed performance. The reward function should prioritize minimizing packet loss and maximizing throughput.

**Pseudocode (DHRP Module):**

```
function DynamicHashRangePartitioning(congestionRiskScores, hashRangeMappingTable, availableBandwidth):
  for interface in interfaces:
    if congestionRiskScores[interface] > threshold:
      # Identify hash ranges assigned to the congested interface
      assignedRanges = hashRangeMappingTable[interface]

      # Split each assigned range into sub-ranges
      subRanges = Split(assignedRanges, numSubRanges)

      # Identify neighboring interfaces with available bandwidth
      neighbors = GetNeighbors(interface, availableBandwidth)

      # Assign sub-ranges to neighbors (round robin or weighted assignment)
      for subRange in subRanges:
        neighbor = SelectNeighbor(neighbors)
        hashRangeMappingTable[neighbor].append(subRange)
        hashRangeMappingTable[interface].remove(subRange)

  return hashRangeMappingTable
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-speed memory for storing historical traffic data and hash range mapping tables.
*   Dedicated hardware acceleration for hash calculations and packet duplication.
*   Programmable logic (FPGA or ASIC) for implementing the predictive congestion engine and dynamic hash range partitioning algorithm.
