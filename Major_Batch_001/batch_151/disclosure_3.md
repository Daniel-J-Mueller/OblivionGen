**Proactive Contextual Agent Handoff with Predictive Sentiment Analysis**

**Concept:** Extend the existing agent continuity service to *proactively* hand off a customer to a more suitable agent *during* an ongoing interaction, based on real-time sentiment analysis and contextual understanding of the conversation. This moves beyond simply reconnecting to a previously helpful agent.

**Specs:**

1.  **Real-Time Sentiment Engine:** Integrate a natural language processing (NLP) engine capable of analyzing customer text and/or speech in real-time to determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, frustrated, confused, etc.) and intent.  The engine should provide a confidence score for each sentiment/intent determination.

2.  **Contextual Data Stream:** Capture a continuous data stream of the customer interaction, including:
    *   Transcribed text/speech from the customer and agent.
    *   Keywords and phrases detected within the conversation.
    *   Customer account data (e.g., purchase history, demographics, known issues).
    *   Agent skills and expertise (from a central registry).
    *   Current topic categorization (using topic modeling).

3.  **Handoff Trigger Logic:** Define configurable thresholds for sentiment scores and/or keyword detections that trigger a handoff evaluation.  Examples:
    *   Sentiment consistently negative for X seconds.
    *   Detection of keywords indicating frustration ("cancel," "refund," "problem," "unhappy").
    *   Topic drift outside of the current agent's expertise.

4.  **Agent Recommendation Engine:** Based on the contextual data stream and handoff trigger, the system will:
    *   Identify available agents with skills matching the current topic and *positive* sentiment handling experience (based on historical data of their interactions).
    *   Estimate wait times for each recommended agent.
    *   Rank agents based on skill match *and* predicted ability to de-escalate or improve the interaction (using a machine learning model trained on historical data).

5.  **Warm Handoff Protocol:**
    *   The system presents the customer with a message: “To better assist you, I’m connecting you with an agent specializing in [topic] with a history of positive outcomes in similar situations. The estimated wait time is [time].”
    *   The system provides the receiving agent with a concise summary of the interaction history, the identified customer sentiment, and relevant account data *before* the connection is made.
    *   Optionally, a short audio/text transcript of the last 30-60 seconds of the conversation is provided to the receiving agent.

6.  **Feedback Loop:** Collect data on the success of handoffs (e.g., customer satisfaction scores, resolution rates, call duration) to continuously improve the agent recommendation model and handoff trigger logic.

**Pseudocode (Agent Recommendation Engine):**

```
function recommend_agent(customer_context, available_agents):
  // customer_context:  Includes sentiment score, keywords, account data, topic
  // available_agents: List of agents with skills and availability

  filtered_agents = []
  for agent in available_agents:
    if agent.skills contains customer_context.topic:
      filtered_agents.append(agent)

  if len(filtered_agents) == 0:
    return "No suitable agents available"

  // Calculate a "suitability score" for each agent:
  for agent in filtered_agents:
    agent.suitability_score = (
        agent.skill_match_score * 0.6 +
        agent.sentiment_handling_score * 0.4  // Based on historical data
    )

  sorted_agents = sort(filtered_agents, key=lambda agent: agent.suitability_score, reverse=True)
  return sorted_agents[0]  // Return the top-ranked agent
```
