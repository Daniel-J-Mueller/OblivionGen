## Airborne Modular Power & Data Relay Network

**Concept:** Establish a dynamically reconfigurable, airborne mesh network of UAVs leveraging the power harvesting technology described in the source patent. These UAVs aren't solely focused on recharging *other* UAVs, but act as intelligent nodes in a self-healing, power/data relay system for remote infrastructure monitoring, disaster response, or persistent surveillance.

**Specs:**

*   **UAV Node - "Spark" (Base Unit):**
    *   **Dimensions:** 50cm x 50cm x 20cm (approximate)
    *   **Weight:** 5kg (target)
    *   **Flight Time (Harvesting):** 8+ hours (dependent on environmental factors)
    *   **Flight Time (Battery):** 2 hours (backup)
    *   **Power Harvesting:** Receptor as described in source patent, optimized for broad frequency range of overhead power lines. Multiple receptor arrays for redundancy/directional optimization.
    *   **Energy Storage:** High-density solid-state battery (48V, 20Ah)
    *   **Communication:**
        *   Long-range (10km+) directional radio (900MHz) for inter-node communication.
        *   Short-range (1km) omnidirectional radio (2.4GHz) for localized sensor/UAV communication.
        *   Secure encrypted communication protocols.
    *   **Processing:** Onboard edge computing (Nvidia Jetson Nano equivalent) for data pre-processing and network management.
    *   **Payload Interface:** Standardized modular payload bay (approx. 10cm x 10cm x 5cm) – supports various sensors, cameras, or communication modules.
    *   **Positioning:** High-precision GPS with RTK correction.
    *   **Shielding:** Advanced multi-layer shielding (Faraday cage & Mu-metal) to minimize interference with onboard electronics and sensitive payloads.
*   **UAV Node - "Beacon" (Enhanced Sensing):**
    *   Shares core architecture with "Spark" node.
    *   Payload: High-resolution multi-spectral camera with stabilized gimbal, environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, gas detection), LiDAR for terrain mapping.
*   **UAV Node - "Relay" (Long-Range Communication):**
    *   Shares core architecture with "Spark" node.
    *   Payload: High-gain directional antenna, software-defined radio for extended communication range and frequency agility.
*   **Ground Control Station:**
    *   Real-time network monitoring and management interface.
    *   Automated node deployment and routing algorithms.
    *   Power usage optimization & billing management.
    *   Secure data storage & analytics.

**Operation & Algorithm:**

1.  **Deployment:** Network of “Spark” nodes deployed along power line corridors or target areas.
2.  **Initial Synchronization:** Nodes establish communication links and synchronize time/location data.
3.  **Power Harvesting & Distribution:** Nodes harvest power from overhead lines & distribute energy within the network to maintain operational status. Prioritization algorithm favors critical nodes & those supporting active payloads.
4.  **Dynamic Routing:** Mesh network automatically adapts to node failures or environmental obstructions. Algorithms prioritize path with highest power availability/bandwidth.
5.  **Payload Management:** Ground station assigns tasks to specific nodes based on payload capabilities and network conditions.
6.  **Data Aggregation & Transmission:** Nodes collect data from payloads and relay it back to the ground station via multi-hop communication.
7.  **Self-Healing:** Nodes detect failures in the network, identify alternative routing paths, and automatically reconfigure the network to maintain connectivity.

**Pseudocode (Network Reconfiguration):**

```
function reconfigureNetwork(failedNode, currentNetworkTopology):
  # Calculate cost of each potential alternative path
  # Cost = (Hop Count) + (Power Loss) + (Bandwidth)

  alternativePaths = findAlternativePaths(failedNode, currentNetworkTopology)
  pathCosts = calculatePathCosts(alternativePaths)
  bestPath = selectBestPath(pathCosts)

  # Update Network Topology
  updateNetworkTopology(bestPath, currentNetworkTopology)

  # Broadcast new topology to all nodes
  broadcastNetworkTopology(currentNetworkTopology)

  return currentNetworkTopology
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple UAV-to-UAV charging. It creates a persistent, self-powered, intelligent network capable of supporting a wide range of applications. Leveraging the power harvesting tech as a foundational element for a broader infrastructure.
