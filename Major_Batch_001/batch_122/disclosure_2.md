## Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment via AI-Driven Character Mimicry

**Concept:** Extend the replay system by allowing a "ghost" AI to control opposing characters (or allies) during the replay, learning and mimicking the original player’s style *and* the playstyles of other original players in the recorded session. This creates a dynamic difficulty adjustment *during* the replay, tailored to the skill of the new player assuming control.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** "Mimic AI" – A neural network trained on recorded gameplay data. Input: Player actions (movement, attacks, resource management), game state (enemy positions, health, map data). Output: Predicted actions for NPCs, informed by both the original player’s style *and* the combined styles of other players present in the original session.
*   **Data Capture:** During original gameplay sessions, record not only player actions but also statistical data about player decisions (e.g., frequency of specific attacks, preferred weapon combinations, average reaction time).
*   **Style Vectors:** For each player in a recorded session, generate a "Style Vector" – a numerical representation of their playstyle, derived from the captured data. This vector is stored with the game record.
*   **Difficulty Scaling:** During replay, the Mimic AI uses the Style Vectors of *all* original players to create a blended difficulty profile. A new player taking control will face opponents whose behaviors reflect a composite of the original players’ skill levels. This difficulty profile can be adjusted in real-time based on the new player's performance.
*   **Opponent Selection:** The Mimic AI doesn't just mimic behavior; it dynamically selects which opponent's style it should prioritize for each encounter. For example, if the new player is struggling, it might prioritize the style of the weakest original player.
*   **Ally Control:** If the game involves cooperative play, the Mimic AI can also control ally characters, mimicking the behaviors of the original co-op players.
*   **Replay Settings:**  Allow players to customize the intensity of the Mimic AI. Options: "Novice" (easy difficulty), "Experienced" (moderate difficulty), "Master" (challenging difficulty), "Unpredictable" (randomized difficulty based on original player styles).
*   **New Game Record Creation:** When a new player joins a replay and the timeline diverges, the newly created game record should *also* store the Mimic AI's difficulty settings and the blended style vector used during the replay. This ensures consistent difficulty across subsequent replays of the new timeline.

**Pseudocode (Difficulty Adjustment Logic):**

```
function adjustDifficulty(newPlayerPerformance, originalPlayerStyleVectors, currentDifficultySetting):
  // Calculate performance score based on new player actions
  performanceScore = calculatePerformanceScore(newPlayerActions)

  // Calculate weighted average of original player styles
  blendedStyleVector = calculateBlendedStyleVector(originalPlayerStyleVectors)

  // Adjust difficulty based on performance and settings
  difficultyMultiplier = 1.0  // Base difficulty

  if performanceScore < 0.3:  // New player struggling
    difficultyMultiplier *= 0.7  // Reduce difficulty
    blendedStyleVector = prioritizeWeakestPlayer(blendedStyleVector)
  else if performanceScore > 0.7: // New player excelling
    difficultyMultiplier *= 1.3  // Increase difficulty
    blendedStyleVector = prioritizeStrongestPlayer(blendedStyleVector)

  difficultyMultiplier = constrain(difficultyMultiplier, 0.5, 2.0) // Limit multiplier range

  return blendedStyleVector, difficultyMultiplier
```

**Potential:**

This extends the replay system beyond simple viewing or participation, adding a sophisticated dynamic difficulty adjustment that makes replays engaging and challenging for players of all skill levels. It also creates a novel way to learn from the playstyles of top players.
