## Modular Thermal Compartment System - “Thermo-Blocks”

**Concept:** Expand the insulated bag’s internal organization beyond a single adjustable divider. Create a system of independent, magnetically-secured thermal compartments (“Thermo-Blocks”) of varying sizes and shapes that can be arranged *within* the bag to perfectly fit the contents.

**Specifications:**

*   **Thermo-Block Construction:** Each block is a rigid or semi-rigid container (polypropylene, recycled plastic) with full thermal insulation (vacuum panel, aerogel, or high-density foam). Dimensions ranging from small (6x6x4 inches) to large (12x8x6 inches), with several intermediate sizes. Basic shapes are rectangular prism, cube, and cylinder.
*   **Magnetic Interface:** Each Thermo-Block has a full perimeter of high-strength neodymium magnets embedded within its exterior walls. Polarity is consistent across all blocks for reliable attachment. Magnet strength must be sufficient to hold the block’s contents during transport but allow for easy repositioning.
*   **Bag Integration:** The interior of the bag (front, back, side, bottom) is lined with a ferrous material (steel mesh embedded in the fabric) creating a “magnetic canvas”. This allows Thermo-Blocks to attach to any interior surface.
*   **Connectivity Features:**
    *   **Stacking:** Thermo-Blocks are designed with interlocking edges to prevent shifting during transport.
    *   **Portals:** Smaller blocks have integrated “portal” openings on one or more sides, allowing for transfer of heat/cold between adjacent blocks or to/from the bag’s external environment (controlled by small, magnetically-sealed flaps).
    *   **Fluid Channels:** Some blocks have internal microfluidic channels, allowing for circulation of temperature-controlled fluid (via a small, external pump) to maintain precise temperature control.
*   **Accessories:**
    *   **Thermo-Block Dividers:** Thin, magnetically-secured dividers that can be placed between blocks to further compartmentalize space.
    *   **Temperature Sensors:** Wireless temperature sensors that can be placed inside blocks to monitor contents and provide data to a mobile app.
    *    **External Pump:** To facilitate fluid circulation in applicable Thermo-Blocks
* **Material Specification:** Food-grade polypropylene, vacuum insulation panels, high-strength neodymium magnets, ferrous steel mesh, food-grade silicone seals.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// User configures Thermo-Blocks:

1. Select desired block sizes/shapes based on contents.
2. Configure fluid channels (if applicable) and set target temperature.
3. Arrange blocks within bag. Blocks attach to ferrous lining via magnets.
4. Secure bag flap.

// System Operation:

1. Temperature sensors monitor block contents.
2. Fluid pump (if enabled) circulates temperature-controlled fluid.
3. Mobile app displays temperature readings and allows user control.
4. Magnetic connections maintain block stability during transport.

// Potential Features:

1. AI-powered block arrangement recommendations based on contents.
2. Predictive temperature control based on ambient conditions.
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond a single, adjustable divider to a dynamic, modular system allowing for customized thermal organization. The magnetic attachment, fluid channels, and sensor integration create a “smart” insulated bag capable of maintaining precise temperature control for diverse contents. This concept opens the door for completely new applications such as mobile catering, temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical delivery, or personalized meal prep.
