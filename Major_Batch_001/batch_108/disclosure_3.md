## Adaptive Virtual Peripheral Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the remote application streaming capability to intelligently map physical peripherals on the client device to virtual equivalents within the streamed application’s virtual machine, dynamically adjusting behavior based on application context and user skill level.

**Specifications:**

**1. Peripheral Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Function:** Detects connected physical peripherals on the client device (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, drawing tablet, specialized controllers).
*   **Data Points:**
    *   Peripheral Type (enum: KEYBOARD, MOUSE, GAMEPAD, TABLET, OTHER)
    *   Vendor ID/Product ID (for device identification)
    *   Input Capabilities (button mappings, axis ranges, pressure sensitivity, etc.)
    *   User-Defined Profiles (saved configurations for specific applications)
*   **Implementation:** Utilize OS-level APIs (e.g., DirectInput, HID API) to enumerate and query peripheral information.

**2. Virtual Peripheral Manager (VPM):**

*   **Function:** Creates and manages virtual peripheral representations within the streamed VM.
*   **Virtual Peripheral Types:** Mirror physical peripheral types, with configurable mappings.
*   **Mapping Engine:**
    *   **Static Mapping:** Direct physical input to virtual output.
    *   **Contextual Mapping:** Dynamically adjust mappings based on the running application and active UI element. (e.g., remap a gamepad button to a specific function in a game editor).
    *   **Skill-Based Adaptation:** Analyze user input patterns (e.g., reaction time, accuracy) and subtly adjust mapping parameters to optimize performance and learning. (e.g., reduce sensitivity for beginners, introduce advanced control schemes for experts)
*   **API:** Expose an API for applications to query and control virtual peripheral settings.

**3.  Input Stream Interception & Translation:**

*   **Function:** Intercept input events from the client device, translate them into virtual peripheral events, and inject them into the application’s input stream.
*   **Implementation:** A kernel-mode driver on the client device and a corresponding component within the VM.
*   **Pseudocode (Client-Side Driver):**

```
OnInputEvent(event):
    device_id = event.deviceId
    event_data = event.data

    virtual_device_id = MapDeviceIdToVirtualId(device_id)
    translated_data = TranslateInputData(event_data, virtual_device_id)

    SendTranslatedEventToVM(translated_data)
```

**4.  Application Context Awareness:**

*   **Function:** Dynamically determine the active application and its current UI context.
*   **Implementation:** A monitoring process within the VM that analyzes application windows and UI elements.
*   **Data Points:** Application Name, Window Title, Active UI Element (e.g., button, slider, text field).

**5.  User Profile Management:**

*   **Function:** Store and retrieve user-defined peripheral profiles and skill levels.
*   **Storage:** Cloud-based or local storage.
*   **Data Points:** Peripheral Mappings, Sensitivity Settings, Skill Level (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert).

**Workflow:**

1.  Client device scans for connected peripherals and sends data to the VPM.
2.  VPM creates virtual peripheral representations.
3.  Application context awareness module identifies the active application and UI element.
4.  Mapping Engine selects appropriate mapping based on application context, user profile, and skill level.
5.  Input events are intercepted, translated, and injected into the application’s input stream.
6.  User profile and skill level are dynamically adjusted based on performance.
