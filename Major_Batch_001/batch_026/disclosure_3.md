## Adaptive Codeword Fusion with Predictive Bit-Windowing

**Concept:** Expand the parallel codeword parsing by dynamically adjusting bit-window overlap based on predicted data entropy. Rather than fixed, overlapping windows, the system *predicts* likely codeword boundaries and adjusts window sizes/overlaps accordingly, maximizing parsing efficiency and reducing redundant computations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Compressed data stream, historical data entropy (maintained rolling average).
*   **Process:** Employ a lightweight model (e.g., Finite State Entropy Estimator – FSEE) to predict entropy of the next *n* bits.  The model should be trainable and adapt to changing data characteristics.
*   **Output:** Entropy score (0.0 – 1.0, higher = higher entropy) and predicted codeword length.

**2. Dynamic Bit-Window Manager:**

*   **Input:** Entropy score, predicted codeword length, current bit position.
*   **Process:**
    *   **High Entropy (score > 0.7):**  Small, highly overlapping windows (e.g., 8-bit windows with 4-bit overlap). Prioritize full coverage to capture potentially fragmented codewords.
    *   **Medium Entropy (0.3 < score < 0.7):** Moderate window size (e.g., 16-bit windows with 8-bit overlap). Balance coverage and computation.
    *   **Low Entropy (score < 0.3):** Larger windows with minimal overlap (e.g., 32-bit windows with 4-bit overlap).  Assume more structured data and reduce redundancy.
    *   **Adaptive Adjustment:** Continuously monitor parsing success rate within each window. If parsing fails consistently within a window, reduce its size or increase overlap *dynamically*.
*   **Output:** Configuration parameters for codeword parsers: window size, overlap, and starting position.

**3. Parallel Codeword Parser Array:**

*   **Configuration:** Each parser receives window configuration from the Dynamic Bit-Window Manager.
*   **Process:** Parses assigned bit window concurrently using literal/length and offset trees (as in the base patent).
*   **Output:** Potential codewords with confidence scores.

**4. Codeword Fusion & Validation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Potential codewords from all parsers, confidence scores, window configuration.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Fusion:** Combines potential codewords from overlapping windows. Prioritizes codewords with higher confidence scores.
    *   **Validation:**  Checks for codeword boundaries based on aggregated lengths and window configurations. Discards invalid combinations.
    *   **Contextual Analysis:** Utilize historical data to favor more likely codeword sequences.  For example, if a specific sequence is frequently encountered, prioritize that sequence in the fusion process.
*   **Output:** Valid, decoded codewords.

**5. Rolling Entropy History:**

*   **Process:** Maintain a rolling average of entropy scores over a defined window of data. This provides a historical context for predicting future entropy levels.
*   **Output:** Historical entropy data used by the Entropy Prediction Module.

**Pseudocode (Codeword Fusion & Validation Engine):**

```
function FuseAndValidate(potential_codewords, window_configs):
  fused_codewords = []
  for codeword in potential_codewords:
    if codeword.valid:
      fused_codewords.append(codeword)

  // Sort by confidence score (descending)
  fused_codewords.sort(key=lambda x: x.confidence, reverse=True)

  validated_codewords = []
  aggregate_length = 0
  for codeword in fused_codewords:
    if aggregate_length <= codeword.start_index:
      validated_codewords.append(codeword)
      aggregate_length = codeword.start_index + codeword.length

  return validated_codewords
```

**Novelty:** The dynamic adjustment of bit-window sizes and overlaps based on predicted entropy levels, rather than fixed configurations. This allows the system to adapt to varying data characteristics and optimize parsing efficiency. Contextual analysis and the rolling entropy history further enhance decoding accuracy.
