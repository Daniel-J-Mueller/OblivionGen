**Dynamic Data Provenance with Ephemeral Tokens & Attestation**

**Concept:** Extend the token-based system to not just manage data access & lifespan, but also build a dynamic, verifiable provenance trail *using* the tokens themselves. This adds an auditability layer beyond simple data deletion.

**Specs:**

*   **Token Structure:** Tokens will no longer *just* represent data; they encapsulate a minimal "history" object. This history includes:
    *   `data_id`: Unique identifier of the sensitive data.
    *   `creation_timestamp`: When the token (and initial data association) was created.
    *   `creator_id`: Identifier of the entity that *originally* submitted the data.
    *   `transformation_id` (Optional):  An ID representing a specific processing step applied to the data (e.g., encryption, redaction). This allows tracking data changes.
    *   `current_owner_id`: Identifier of the entity currently holding the token.
    *   `signature`: Cryptographic signature of the history object, verifiable by a trusted authority.
*   **Token Transfer Protocol:** All token transfers are recorded as *new* history entries within the token itself.  Each transfer appends a new `transfer_timestamp` and `transferee_id` to the history. The signature is re-calculated and updated after *every* transfer.
*   **Attestation Service:** A dedicated service that can, given a token, reconstruct the *complete* provenance history of the data it represents. This service can verify the integrity of the history by validating the signatures at each step.
*   **Ephemeral Token Variants:** Introduce a tiered token system:
    *   *Standard Tokens*:  Longer lifespan, used for persistent data.
    *   *Attestation Tokens*: Short-lived, created specifically for verification requests to the Attestation Service.  These are computationally expensive to generate, discouraging frivolous requests.
    *   *Zero-Knowledge Tokens*:  Enable a recipient to *prove* they possess a valid token *without* revealing the token itself. Useful for access control without data exposure.

**Pseudocode (Attestation Service):**

```
function attestToken(token):
  history = token.getHistory()
  for entry in history:
    if not verifySignature(entry.signature, entry):
      return False  // Invalid history
  return True  // Valid history

function getDataProvenance(token):
  if not attestToken(token):
    return "Provenance verification failed"
  return token.getHistory() // Return complete provenance trail
```

**Integration Points:**

*   **Security Modules:** Integrate token generation and transfer protocols directly into existing security modules.
*   **Storage Services:** Modify storage services to automatically manage token lifecycles and enforce access control based on token validity.
*   **Audit Logs:** Use the provenance history to generate detailed audit logs for compliance and security investigations.
*   **Data Lineage Tools:**  Leverage the token system to build sophisticated data lineage tools that track data flow and transformations across systems.
