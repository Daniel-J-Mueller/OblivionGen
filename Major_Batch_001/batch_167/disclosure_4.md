## Dynamic Contextual Embeddings for Prosodic Feature Integration

**Concept:** Expand the language model's state representation to incorporate *prosodic features* (pitch, rhythm, stress) alongside word sequences.  Rather than treating prosody as a post-processing step or solely acoustic data, embed these features directly into the language model's state space, enabling predictive modeling of prosody *alongside* word choice.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prosodic Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio data.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Utilize a deep neural network (DNN) trained on a large corpus of labeled speech data to extract a vector of prosodic features for each short audio segment (e.g., 50-100ms).  Features include:
        *   Fundamental Frequency (F0) – mean, variance, slope.
        *   Energy – mean, variance, slope.
        *   Duration – segment length.
        *   Spectral Tilt.
        *   Rhythm/Stress indicators derived from amplitude and duration patterns.
    *   Normalize all features to a consistent scale (e.g., 0-1).
*   **Output:** A prosodic feature vector for each audio segment.

**2. Embedding Layer:**

*   **Input:** Prosodic feature vector.
*   **Processing:** Pass the prosodic feature vector through a fully connected layer (embedding layer) to create a *prosodic embedding vector* with a fixed dimensionality (e.g., 128 or 256).  This embedding represents the prosodic characteristics of the audio segment in a compact form.
*   **Output:** Prosodic embedding vector.

**3. Augmented Language Model State:**

*   **Modification:**  Modify the language model's FST state representation. Each state, previously corresponding *only* to a word sequence (N-gram), now incorporates a *concatenation* of the N-gram’s existing representation *and* the prosodic embedding vector corresponding to the audio segment associated with that N-gram.
*   **Representation:**  State = [N-gram Representation || Prosodic Embedding]
*   **Dimensionality:** The dimensionality of the augmented state will be the sum of the original N-gram representation dimensionality and the prosodic embedding dimensionality.

**4. Arc Scoring Modification:**

*   **Adjustment:** Modify the arc scoring function in the FST.  The score for an arc (transition between states) is now calculated as a weighted sum of:
    *   The traditional language model score (based on N-gram probability).
    *   A *prosodic compatibility score*. This score measures the similarity between the prosodic embedding associated with the *current* state and the prosodic embedding predicted for the *next* state based on the acoustic model’s output.  Cosine similarity or Euclidean distance can be used to calculate this score.
*   **Equation:** Arc Score =  (Weight_LM * LM_Score) + (Weight_Prosody * Prosodic_Compatibility_Score)
    *   `Weight_LM` and `Weight_Prosody` are tunable parameters that control the relative importance of language model and prosodic information.

**5.  Training Procedure:**

*   **Data:**  Requires a large corpus of speech data with accurate transcriptions and labeled prosodic features.
*   **Process:** Train the entire system end-to-end using a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) criterion.  The training process will optimize the weights of the embedding layer, the weights in the arc scoring function, and the parameters of the acoustic model.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// During ASR Decoding:

function calculate_arc_score(current_state, next_state, acoustic_score):
  lm_score = get_language_model_score(current_state, next_state)
  prosodic_compatibility_score = calculate_cosine_similarity(
      get_prosodic_embedding(current_state),
      get_predicted_prosodic_embedding(acoustic_score)
  )
  arc_score = (weight_lm * lm_score) + (weight_prosody * prosodic_compatibility_score)
  return arc_score

//  Where get_predicted_prosodic_embedding() is the output of the acoustic model’s prosody prediction layer.
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved accuracy in recognizing ambiguous utterances.
*   More natural-sounding synthesized speech.
*   Better handling of disfluencies and spontaneous speech.
*   Enhanced emotion recognition capabilities.
