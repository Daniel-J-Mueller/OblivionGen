## Dynamic Environmental Adaptation via Bio-Inspired Beacon Networks

**Concept:** Expand the beacon proximity automation concept to create a dynamic, responsive environment that mimics biological systems, specifically swarming behavior and pheromone trails. Instead of static rules tied to individual beacons, introduce a system where beacons communicate with each other, creating “environmental gradients” that influence device behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Beacon Node Architecture:**

*   **Communication Protocol:** Mesh network utilizing low-energy Bluetooth or Zigbee. Each beacon can act as a repeater, extending the network range.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Each beacon incorporates the following:
    *   Ambient Light Sensor
    *   Temperature Sensor
    *   Humidity Sensor
    *   Motion Detector (Passive Infrared)
    *   Microphone (for sound level detection)
*   **Processing Unit:** Low-power microcontroller capable of running basic data aggregation and communication protocols.
*   **Power Source:** Battery powered with optional energy harvesting (solar, vibration).
*   **Data Transmission:** Each beacon broadcasts:
    *   Unique Beacon ID
    *   Sensor Data (aggregated over a short time window)
    *   “Environmental Influence Score” (EIS) - A calculated value (see section 3)
    *   Neighbor Beacon List (beacon IDs of nearby beacons)

**2. Network Addressable Device (NAD) Architecture:**

*   **Beacon Detection:** Continuously scans for beacon signals (Bluetooth/Zigbee).
*   **Signal Strength Analysis:** Determines proximity to each detected beacon.
*   **EIS Reception:** NADs can *receive* EIS values broadcast by beacons.
*   **NAD Profile:** Each NAD has a profile defining its response to various EIS ranges (configurable via UI).
*   **Communication:** NADs communicate with a central server to report status and receive updated profiles.

**3. Environmental Influence Score (EIS) Calculation:**

The EIS is a dynamic value calculated by each beacon, reflecting the localized environmental conditions.  The formula is:

`EIS = w1 * LightLevel + w2 * Temperature + w3 * Humidity + w4 * Motion + w5 * SoundLevel`

Where:

*   `LightLevel`, `Temperature`, `Humidity`, `Motion`, `SoundLevel` are normalized sensor readings (0-1).
*   `w1`, `w2`, `w3`, `w4`, `w5` are configurable weights, allowing prioritization of certain environmental factors.  These weights are managed centrally and propagated to beacons.

**4.  Automation Logic:**

*   **EIS-Based Rules:** NAD behavior is determined by the *combined* EIS values of nearby beacons.  For example:
    *   A lighting system might increase brightness if the average EIS of surrounding beacons indicates high activity (motion + sound).
    *   A thermostat might adjust temperature based on the average temperature reading from nearby beacons.
    *   A robotic vacuum cleaner might prioritize cleaning areas with higher activity.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Rather than fixed proximity ranges, NADs respond to *changes* in EIS values. This enables responsiveness to gradual shifts in environmental conditions.
*   **Swarming Behavior:**  NADs can communicate with each other, sharing their perceived EIS values and coordinating actions to create a more cohesive environmental response.

**5.  Central Management System:**

*   **Beacon Network Mapping:**  Automatically discovers and maps the beacon network topology.
*   **Weight Configuration:**  Allows administrators to adjust the `w1` - `w5` weights to prioritize specific environmental factors.
*   **NAD Profile Management:**  Allows administrators to define NAD profiles that specify how each device responds to different EIS ranges.
*   **Data Analytics:**  Collects and analyzes data from the beacon network and NADs to identify trends and optimize environmental control.
*   **User Interface:**  Provides a visual representation of the beacon network, NAD status, and environmental conditions.



**Pseudocode (NAD):**

```
// Initialization
device_id = get_device_id()
device_profile = load_device_profile(device_id)

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Scan for beacons
    beacon_list = scan_for_beacons()

    // Calculate combined EIS
    total_eis = 0
    for each beacon in beacon_list {
        distance = calculate_distance(beacon)
        influence = 1 / (distance * distance) // Inverse square law
        total_eis += beacon.eis * influence
    }

    // Apply automation rule
    if (total_eis > device_profile.high_eis_threshold) {
        perform_action("high_activity")
    } else if (total_eis > device_profile.medium_eis_threshold) {
        perform_action("medium_activity")
    } else {
        perform_action("low_activity")
    }

    sleep(1)
}
