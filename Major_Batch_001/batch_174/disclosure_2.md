## Predictive Pre-fetching with Tiered Object Reconstruction

**Specification:** Implement a system that proactively fetches data *fragments* – not entire files – anticipating future read requests, and reconstructs objects in a tiered manner based on predicted access frequency. This expands upon the proactive transfer idea by focusing on granular data anticipation and optimized reconstruction.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Fragmentor:** Divides file system objects into fixed-size fragments.  Metadata associated with each fragment records its originating object and offset within that object.
2.  **Access Pattern Predictor (APP):** A machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network or transformer architecture) trained on historical access patterns *at the fragment level*. Input: Sequence of fragment IDs accessed. Output: Probability distribution over all possible fragment IDs for the next access. This predicts what fragment is most likely to be needed next.
3.  **Tiered Storage Manager (TSM):**  Manages multiple storage tiers with varying performance characteristics (e.g., NVMe SSD, SATA SSD, HDD, object storage).  Assigns fragments to tiers based on predicted access frequency.
4.  **Pre-fetcher:**  Monitors access requests. Based on APP’s predictions, initiates asynchronous pre-fetches of the most likely fragments to the fastest available tier. A configurable 'prefetch depth' determines how many fragments ahead to prefetch.
5.  **Reconstruction Engine:** When a fragment is requested, it first checks the fastest tier. If not present, it checks subsequent tiers. If the fragment is missing from all tiers, it is retrieved from the origin storage and placed in the fastest available tier.  The Reconstruction Engine also handles any necessary reassembly of fragments into a complete object.

**Pseudocode (Prefetcher component):**

```
function prefetch_loop():
    while True:
        access_sequence = get_recent_access_sequence(N) // N = window size
        predicted_fragment_ids = APP.predict(access_sequence) // returns list of fragment IDs with probabilities
        top_k_fragments = get_top_k(predicted_fragment_ids, K) // K = prefetch depth

        for fragment_id in top_k_fragments:
            if fragment_id not in cache: // assumes a simple cache for initial checks
                TSM.prefetch(fragment_id) // requests prefetch from TSM
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Fragment Metadata:** `{fragment_id: UUID, object_id: UUID, offset: integer, size: integer}`
*   **Access History:** Time-stamped list of `fragment_id` values.
*   **Tiered Storage Map:** `{fragment_id: tier_id}` -  tracks where each fragment is stored.

**Innovation & Differentiation:**

This system moves beyond file-level prefetching to a more granular, predictive approach.  By operating at the fragment level, it can:

*   Reduce latency for frequently accessed portions of files.
*   Minimize the amount of data that needs to be transferred proactively.
*   Optimize storage tier utilization based on predicted access patterns. The tiered system maximizes performance by keeping hot fragments on the fastest media and cold fragments on the slowest, minimizing cost.

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The APP model can be distributed across multiple machines.
*   The TSM can be sharded based on object or fragment ID.
*   Caching layers can be implemented to further reduce latency.
