## Temporal Data Reconstruction via Multi-Key Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the key-value store concept to support temporal data reconstruction through multi-key sharding and version vector tracking. This allows for not just tracking *that* data has changed, but reconstructing *any* prior state of the data within a defined retention period.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Sharding:**  Instead of a single key for a data object, employ a key structure: `[object_id]_[timestamp]`. The `timestamp` represents a discrete point in time (e.g., epoch milliseconds). This creates a stream of key-value pairs for each object, representing its evolution.
*   **Version Vectors:** Each data object should maintain a version vector. This vector tracks the latest timestamp for each shard (key) associated with that object. This ensures efficient access to the latest version and assists in reconstruction.
*   **Retention Policy:** A configurable retention policy dictates how long shards are stored. Older shards are archived or deleted based on policy.
*   **Reconstruction API:**
    *   `get_data(object_id, timestamp)`: Retrieves the data object's state *as it existed* at the specified timestamp.  The system uses the timestamp to locate the appropriate shard. If the exact timestamp doesn't exist, the nearest preceding shard is returned.
    *   `reconstruct_history(object_id, start_timestamp, end_timestamp)`: Returns a sequence of data object states between the specified timestamps, reconstructing the object's history.
*   **Write Operation Enhancement:** When a write operation occurs:
    1.  A new shard (`[object_id]_[current_timestamp]`) is created with the updated data.
    2.  The version vector for the object is updated to include the `current_timestamp`.
*   **Garbage Collection:** Implement a background process to automatically delete shards older than the defined retention period.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruct History):**

```
function reconstruct_history(object_id, start_timestamp, end_timestamp):
  shards = []
  query = "SELECT key, value FROM key_value_store WHERE key LIKE '" + object_id + "_%' AND timestamp >= " + start_timestamp + " AND timestamp <= " + end_timestamp + " ORDER BY timestamp ASC"
  results = executeQuery(query)
  for result in results:
    shard_key = result.key
    shard_value = result.value
    shards.append(shard_value)

  return shards
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   The query language must support timestamp ranges and wildcard searches on keys.
*   Consider using a time-series database as the underlying storage mechanism to optimize timestamp-based queries.
*   Efficient indexing on the `key` and `timestamp` columns is crucial for performance.
*   The retention policy should be configurable at the object level.
*   Compression techniques should be applied to reduce storage costs.
