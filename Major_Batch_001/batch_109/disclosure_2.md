## Dynamic Predictive Occlusion Mapping for Presence Detection

**Concept:** Extend presence detection by incorporating a predictive occlusion mapping layer *before* confidence value calculation. This layer anticipates potential occlusions (objects blocking the view of a person) based on scene geometry and learned object behavior, dynamically adjusting confidence values to mitigate false negatives.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Scene Understanding:**

1.  **Depth Sensor Integration:** Mandatory integration with a depth sensor (e.g., Time-of-Flight, Stereo Vision) to generate a real-time depth map of the environment.
2.  **Semantic Segmentation:** Employ a semantic segmentation model (trained on a diverse dataset of indoor environments) to identify static objects within the depth map (furniture, walls, etc.).  Output: Semantic map with object labels and 3D bounding boxes.
3.  **Object Trajectory Prediction:** Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) preferred – to predict the trajectories of *moving* objects identified in consecutive frames.  Input: Historical object positions, velocities. Output: Predicted object positions for the next *n* frames (n=3-5 recommended).

**II. Occlusion Map Generation:**

1.  **Ray Casting:** For each pixel in the image frame, cast a ray from the camera’s perspective into the 3D scene.
2.  **Intersection Testing:** Test the ray for intersections with the 3D bounding boxes of *static* objects and predicted positions of *moving* objects.
3.  **Occlusion Probability:**  If an intersection occurs, calculate an “occlusion probability” for that pixel based on:
    *   Distance to the intersecting object.
    *   Size of the intersecting object.
    *   Angle between the ray and the object’s surface.
4.  **Dynamic Occlusion Map:**  Create a 2D map representing the probability of occlusion for each pixel.  High values indicate a high likelihood of a person being obscured.

**III. Confidence Value Adjustment:**

1.  **Pre-Confidence Calculation:** Calculate initial confidence values as described in the reference patent.
2.  **Occlusion Map Integration:**  Apply a weighting factor to the initial confidence value based on the corresponding value in the occlusion map.
    *   `Adjusted Confidence = Initial Confidence * (1 - Occlusion Map Value)`
    *   This reduces the confidence value in areas likely to be occluded.
3.  **Adaptive Weighting:** Dynamically adjust the weighting factor based on the “certainty” of the occlusion prediction.
    *   Higher certainty (e.g., a large, close object blocking a significant portion of the view) leads to a greater reduction in confidence.
    *   Lower certainty (e.g., a small, distant object) leads to a smaller reduction.

**IV. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
LOOP for each frame:
    DEPTH_MAP = AcquireDepthData()
    SEMANTIC_MAP = PerformSemanticSegmentation(DEPTH_MAP)
    OBJECT_TRAJECTORIES = PredictObjectTrajectories(SEMANTIC_MAP)

    FOR each pixel (x, y):
        RAY = CastRay(x, y)
        INTERSECTION = FindIntersection(RAY, SEMANTIC_MAP, OBJECT_TRAJECTORIES)

        IF INTERSECTION:
            OCCLUSION_PROBABILITY = CalculateOcclusionProbability(INTERSECTION)
        ELSE:
            OCCLUSION_PROBABILITY = 0.0

        INITIAL_CONFIDENCE = CalculateInitialConfidence(pixel)
        ADJUSTED_CONFIDENCE = INITIAL_CONFIDENCE * (1 - OCCLUSION_PROBABILITY)

        // Update confidence map with ADJUSTED_CONFIDENCE

    // Perform presence detection based on adjusted confidence map
END LOOP
```

**V. Hardware Requirements:**

*   RGB-D Camera (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect)
*   GPU for accelerated semantic segmentation and object trajectory prediction.
*   Sufficient RAM to store depth maps, semantic maps, and model weights.

**VI. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Learned Occlusion Patterns:** Train a neural network to learn common occlusion patterns in specific environments (e.g., a person frequently walking behind a couch).
*   **Multi-Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from multiple cameras to provide a more complete view of the scene and reduce the impact of occlusions.
*   **Human Pose Estimation:**  Use human pose estimation to infer the presence of a person even if they are partially occluded (e.g., only their legs are visible).
