## Dynamic Scene Composition from Emotional Text Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the image generation to incorporate emotional tone detection within the text and translate that into dynamic scene composition. Instead of *just* identifying subjects and attributes, analyze the sentiment and emotional weight of the descriptive text to affect lighting, color palettes, camera angles, and even the inclusion of atmospheric effects within the generated image.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sentiment Analysis Module:** Integrate a natural language processing (NLP) module capable of identifying sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and more granular emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, etc.) within the selected text portion.  Output a weighted emotional vector representing the emotional profile of the text.

2.  **Emotional Mapping Database:** Create a database mapping emotional weights to visual parameters.  Example:
    *   High Joy: Warm color palettes (yellows, oranges), bright lighting, upward camera angles, inclusion of bokeh or lens flares.
    *   High Sadness: Cool color palettes (blues, grays), low-key lighting, downward camera angles, inclusion of rain or fog effects.
    *   High Anger:  Strong contrasts, saturated reds and blacks, dynamic camera angles (slight tilts or shakes), inclusion of fire or smoke effects.
    *   High Fear: Desaturated colors, stark lighting, wide-angle lens (to emphasize vastness or confinement), inclusion of shadows and distorted perspectives.

3.  **Dynamic Scene Generation Engine:** Modify the existing image generation pipeline to:
    *   Receive the emotional vector from the Sentiment Analysis Module.
    *   Query the Emotional Mapping Database based on the emotional vector.
    *   Adjust the following parameters during image generation:
        *   **Color Palette:** Select colors based on the mapped palette.
        *   **Lighting:** Adjust brightness, contrast, and direction of light sources.
        *   **Camera Angle:** Apply slight rotations or tilts to the camera.
        *   **Depth of Field:** Control the amount of blur in the background.
        *   **Atmospheric Effects:** Add effects like rain, fog, snow, or fire.
        *   **Particle Systems:** Generate particles to represent emotional energy (e.g., glowing embers for anger, falling leaves for sadness).

4.  **User Control:** Provide users with a “Mood Slider” or similar interface element. This would allow them to manually adjust the overall emotional intensity of the generated image, overriding the default emotion derived from the text.

5.  **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    function generateImage(textPortion):
      emotionalVector = sentimentAnalysis(textPortion)
      visualParameters = emotionalMappingDatabase(emotionalVector)

      //User Override
      userMoodLevel = getUserMoodInput()
      visualParameters.intensity = visualParameters.intensity * userMoodLevel

      scene = generateBaseScene(textPortion, visualParameters) //Uses existing scene generation
      applyVisualParameters(scene, visualParameters)
      return scene
    ```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple object/attribute matching. It leverages emotional intelligence to create images that *feel* as well as *look* representative of the text, fostering a deeper connection between the reader and the visual content.  Existing systems primarily focus on *what* is described; this focuses on *how* it is described.
