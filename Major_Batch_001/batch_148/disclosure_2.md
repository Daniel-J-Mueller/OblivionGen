## Temporal Key Sharding with Entropy Pools

**Concept:** Expand upon the durability concept by *sharding* a cryptographic key across multiple, independently expiring keys and entropy pools, adding a layer of proactive key reconstruction rather than simple failure.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Shard Generation:**

*   **Input:** Original cryptographic key (`K`), desired durability period (`D`), number of shards (`N`), maximum shard lifetime (`L` – must be less than `D`).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Generate `N` unique, temporary cryptographic keys (`K1`, `K2`, ... `Kn`). Each `Ki` has an individually determined, random expiration time within the range of `D` (but no more than `L`).
    2.  Divide `K` into `N` equal (or nearly equal) shards (`S1`, `S2`, … `Sn`).
    3.  Encrypt each shard `Si` with its corresponding temporary key `Ki` resulting in `E1`, `E2`, … `En`.
    4.  Distribute each encrypted shard `Ei` to a separate entropy pool (described below).

**2. Entropy Pools:**

*   Each entropy pool is a distributed, secure storage system.  Its primary function is to hold encrypted key shards and provide access based on time and authorization.
*   Entropy pools should be geographically distributed and utilize diverse security measures (e.g., hardware security modules, multi-factor authentication, intrusion detection).
*   Each entropy pool maintains a record of the expiration time of the shard it holds.
*   Entropy Pools provide an API for 'harvesting' shards (decrypting and returning them) *before* their expiration time.

**3. Key Reconstruction:**

*   To reconstruct the original key `K`:
    1.  An authorized entity requests the shards from the entropy pools.
    2.  The entropy pools verify the request and, if valid and *before* the shard's expiration, return the encrypted shards.
    3.  The entity assembles the encrypted shards.
    4.  A master decryption key (separate from the shard keys) decrypts the assembled shards to recreate `K`.

**4. Proactive Reconstruction & Rotation:**

*   A background process monitors shard expiration times.
*   *Before* a shard expires, the system attempts to reconstruct `K` using the remaining valid shards.
*   If reconstruction is successful, a new shard is generated to replace the expiring one. This process keeps the key ‘live’ indefinitely.
*   Rotation strategy: if a shard is lost, the system can reconstruct from others and proactively request an immediate new shard generated.

**5. Pseudocode:**

```
function generateShards(key K, duration D, numShards N):
  shards = []
  for i from 1 to N:
    expirationTime = randomTimeWithin(D)
    shardKey = generateRandomKey()
    shard = splitKey(K, N, i)
    encryptedShard = encrypt(shard, shardKey)
    shards.append((encryptedShard, shardKey, expirationTime))
  return shards

function reconstructKey(shards):
  decryptedShards = []
  for (encryptedShard, shardKey, expirationTime) in shards:
    if expirationTime > currentTime:
      decryptedShard = decrypt(encryptedShard, shardKey)
      decryptedShards.append(decryptedShard)
  if length(decryptedShards) == originalShardCount:
    return assembleKey(decryptedShards)
  else:
    return keyReconstructionFailed

function proactiveRotation():
  expiringShards = findShardsExpiringSoon()
  if expiringShards:
    reconstructedKey = reconstructKey(allShards)
    if reconstructedKey:
      newShard = generateNewShard(reconstructedKey)
      replaceExpiredShard(newShard)
```

**Rationale:** This system improves durability and resilience beyond simple expiration. Sharding reduces the impact of a single entropy pool compromise. Proactive reconstruction prevents key loss and allows for continuous key rotation without service interruption. The randomness in shard lifetimes and distribution further enhances security.
