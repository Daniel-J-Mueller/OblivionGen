## Adaptive Request Shadowing & Synthetic Load Generation

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of intercepting and simulating sub-operations to *proactively* generate synthetic load mirroring production traffic, but with injected faults/variations.  This isn't just testing *if* something fails, but building a system that *predicts* how a system will behave under varying conditions *before* those conditions occur in production. It's about synthetic observability.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:**  `ShadowRequestEngine` – a service integrated with the existing front-end nodes.
*   **Input:** Real-time production request stream (sampled – adjustable sampling rate).  User account authorization data (from existing system). Test condition definitions (JSON format – see below).
*   **Output:** Synthetic request stream (identical to sampled production requests, but modified per test condition). Metrics on synthetic request performance.
*   **Data Structure: Test Condition Definition (JSON):**

```json
{
  "name": "HighLatencyDatabase",
  "description": "Simulates increased latency for database interactions.",
  "target": "database_query", // Specific sub-operation to target
  "condition": {
    "type": "latency",
    "value": "200ms", //Introduce 200ms latency
    "distribution": "uniform" // Optional: distribution type (uniform, gaussian, etc.)
  },
  "weight": 0.1 // Probability of applying this condition to a shadowed request
}
```

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  `ShadowRequestEngine` intercepts a percentage of production requests (configurable).
    2.  For each intercepted request, it retrieves a set of active test condition definitions.
    3.  Based on the `weight` in the test condition definition, a condition may be applied to the request.
    4.  The request is "shadowed" – a synthetic version is created.
    5.  The synthetic request is routed to the same backend systems as the original request.
    6.  The system simulates the specified condition (e.g., adds latency to a database query).
    7.  Metrics are collected on the synthetic request's performance (response time, error rate, etc.).
    8.  Original production request continues unaffected.

*   **Pseudocode (within `ShadowRequestEngine`):**

```
function processRequest(request):
  if random() < samplingRate:
    testConditions = getActiveTestConditions()
    shadowRequest = clone(request)

    for condition in testConditions:
      if random() < condition.weight:
        if condition.target == "database_query":
          shadowRequest = injectLatency(shadowRequest, condition.value, condition.distribution)
        # Add other condition handling here (e.g., error injection, data corruption)

    sendRequest(shadowRequest)  # Send the modified request to the backend
    collectMetrics(shadowRequest)
  sendRequest(request) # Send the original request
```

*   **Key Innovations:**

    *   **Proactive Failure Prediction:**  Observing synthetic load under stress allows for prediction of potential production issues before they occur.
    *   **Dynamic Load Generation:** Adapts to production traffic patterns.
    *   **Granular Control:** Test conditions can target specific sub-operations.
    *   **Non-Intrusive:** Doesn't impact production traffic.
    *   **Observable Synthetic Behavior:** The entire shadow system can be monitored to establish baselines.
