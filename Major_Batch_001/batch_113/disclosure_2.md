## Adaptive Notification Profiles & Contextual Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the notification lock mode functionality to dynamically adjust notification delivery *based on predicted user activity* and *environmental context*, going beyond simply disabling or enabling notifications per application. The system learns user patterns and anticipates needs, proactively managing notification flow.

**System Specs:**

*   **Contextual Data Acquisition:**
    *   Sensors: Access to device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, microphone, camera – with user permissions).
    *   Calendar Integration: Access (with permission) to user’s calendar for scheduled events.
    *   App Usage Monitoring: Track app usage patterns – frequency, duration, time of day.
    *   Network Connectivity: Monitor network type (Wi-Fi, cellular) and signal strength.
    *   Environmental Audio Analysis: Analyze ambient sound levels (using the microphone) to determine user location/activity (e.g., meeting, driving, home).

*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:**
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained on user data to predict:
        *   Likelihood of user engaging with specific apps within a timeframe.
        *   User’s current activity (driving, walking, in a meeting, sleeping).
        *   User’s level of distraction/focus.
    *   Model updates continuously based on new data.
    *   Privacy-preserving data aggregation techniques to reduce individual data exposure.

*   **Notification Prioritization & Delivery:**
    *   Notifications assigned a "priority score" based on:
        *   Predictive model output (user likely to engage).
        *   App-defined importance level.
        *   Notification content analysis (urgent/critical keywords).
    *   During notification lock mode (or even in normal mode):
        *   High-priority notifications *always* delivered (e.g., emergency alerts, critical system messages).
        *   Medium-priority notifications delivered if user is predicted to be receptive (not driving, not in a meeting).
        *   Low-priority notifications *deferred* or summarized for later viewing.
    *   "Smart Summarization" – consolidate multiple low-priority notifications into a single digest.

*   **User Interface & Control:**
    *   “Notification Profile” settings – pre-defined profiles (e.g., "Work Focus", "Commute", "Relaxation", "Sleep") that adjust notification behavior.
    *   Manual override – allow users to temporarily boost or suppress notifications.
    *   “Learning Mode” – initial period where the system learns user patterns.
    *   Transparency – provide users with insight into how notifications are being prioritized.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Acquire contextual data
  contextData = getContextData();

  // Predict user activity & engagement
  prediction = predictActivity(contextData);

  // Get pending notifications
  notifications = getPendingNotifications();

  // Prioritize notifications
  for (notification in notifications) {
    priority = calculatePriority(notification, prediction);
    notification.priority = priority;
  }

  // Deliver notifications based on priority & lock mode
  if (lockModeEnabled()) {
    for (notification in notifications) {
      if (notification.priority == HIGH) {
        deliverNotification(notification);
      } else if (notification.priority == MEDIUM && isUserReceptive()) {
        deliverNotification(notification);
      } else {
        deferNotification(notification); // Store for later
      }
    }
  } else {
    deliverAllNotifications(notifications);
  }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Cross-Device Coordination:** Extend notification management across multiple devices (phone, tablet, smartwatch).
*   **Proactive Assistance:** Suggest actions based on notifications (e.g., "Traffic is heavy – would you like to leave earlier?").
*   **Notification "Buffering":** Temporarily store notifications when the user is in a highly focused state, and deliver them later in a non-disruptive manner.
*   **Sentiment Analysis of Messages:** Prioritize notifications based on the emotional tone of the message content.
