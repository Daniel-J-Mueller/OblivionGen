## Autonomous Drone Swarm Mapping & Dynamic Landing Pad Creation

**System Overview:** A multi-drone system capable of rapidly mapping a landing zone *during* descent, dynamically identifying the safest and largest planar surface, and constructing a temporary, illuminated landing pad using biodegradable, rapidly deploying material. This goes beyond static surface detection, adapting to changing conditions (e.g., moving obstacles, temporary obstructions) *during* the final descent phase.

**Components:**

*   **Lead Drone:** Equipped with high-resolution LiDAR and conventional RGB cameras. Handles initial broad area mapping and swarm coordination.
*   **Mapping Drones (x5-x10):** Agile drones with downfacing RGB-D cameras. Execute detailed surface scans of designated areas identified by the Lead Drone. 
*   **Material Dispenser Drone:** Carries a biodegradable, lightweight material (e.g., compressed mycelium, rapidly expanding foam derived from algae) in a spool/cartridge.
*   **Ground Control Station (GCS):** Processes sensor data, manages swarm behavior, and communicates with drones.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Descent & Broad Mapping:** Lead Drone initiates descent and performs broad area LiDAR scan to create initial terrain map.
2.  **Area Partitioning:** GCS analyzes the terrain map and partitions the landing zone into sub-areas.
3.  **Detailed Mapping by Swarm:** Mapping Drones are dispatched to scan their assigned sub-areas, generating high-resolution point clouds and RGB-D data. Data is streamed back to GCS in real-time.
4.  **Dynamic Planar Surface Identification:** GCS employs a robust plane fitting algorithm to identify potential landing surfaces within the point cloud data. Algorithm prioritizes:
    *   Area (minimum size threshold)
    *   Planarity (deviation from ideal plane)
    *   Obstacle avoidance (detects and excludes areas with obstacles)
    *   Material properties (assesses surface texture and suitability for landing)
5.  **Landing Pad Construction:** Once a suitable surface is identified, the Material Dispenser Drone deploys the biodegradable material to create a clearly visible, illuminated landing pad. Deployment pattern is dynamically adjusted to conform to the identified surface shape and size. Integrated LED illumination ensures visibility in low-light conditions.
6.  **Final Descent & Landing:** Lead Drone executes a precision landing on the constructed pad, guided by onboard sensors and visual markers on the pad.

**Pseudocode (GCS - Planar Surface Identification):**

```
FUNCTION IdentifyLandingSurface(pointCloudData):
    planes = FindPlanes(pointCloudData)
    validPlanes = []

    FOR plane IN planes:
        IF plane.area > MINIMUM_AREA AND plane.planarity > MINIMUM_PLANARITY:
            obstacles = DetectObstacles(plane)
            IF obstacles.count == 0:
                validPlanes.append(plane)

    IF validPlanes.count > 0:
        bestPlane = SelectBestPlane(validPlanes)  // Criteria: Area, Planarity, Obstacle Free
        RETURN bestPlane
    ELSE:
        RETURN NULL // No suitable surface found
```

**Material Specifications (Biodegradable Pad):**

*   **Composition:** Compressed mycelium or algae-derived expanding foam.
*   **Density:** Low density for lightweight deployment.
*   **Expansion Rate:** Rapid expansion upon release.
*   **Luminescence:** Integrated LED strip for visibility.
*   **Biodegradability:** Complete biodegradation within 72 hours.

**Safety Features:**

*   **Redundancy:** Multiple drones and sensors ensure continued operation in case of failure.
*   **Collision Avoidance:** Onboard sensors and algorithms prevent collisions with obstacles.
*   **Emergency Landing:** Automated emergency landing procedure in case of critical failure.
*   **Geofencing:** Virtual boundaries prevent drones from entering restricted areas.
