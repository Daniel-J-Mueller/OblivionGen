## Dynamic Phrase-Based Reality Augmentation

**Concept:** Leverage user-defined phrases not just for data routing and storage, but as anchors for localized augmented reality (AR) experiences. Extend the existing phrase-rule system to trigger AR content overlays based on location, time, and user context.

**Specs:**

**1. Phrase-AR Rule Definition:**

*   **Data Structure:** Extend user-defined rules to include an “AR Trigger” flag. When set, the rule must contain the following:
    *   `AR Content URL`: Points to a resource containing the AR experience (e.g., a USDZ file, a WebXR experience).
    *   `Activation Radius`: Defines a geographic radius (in meters) around a GPS coordinate where the AR experience is activated.
    *   `Temporal Constraints`: Defines specific times/days when the AR experience is active. (e.g., "Weekdays 9am-5pm", "Sunset", "During specific events").
    *   `Contextual Filters`: Optional criteria that must be met for the AR experience to activate. (e.g., "Weather is sunny", "User is moving", "User is wearing headphones").
*   **Rule Storage:** Store AR rules alongside existing phrase-rule sets.

**2. AR Trigger Engine:**

*   **Location Tracking:** Continuously monitor the user’s GPS location.
*   **Phrase Matching:** When a message containing a defined phrase is received, cross-reference the phrase with the user’s stored rules.
*   **Trigger Evaluation:**
    *   If an AR Trigger is set for the phrase, evaluate the Activation Radius, Temporal Constraints, and Contextual Filters.
    *   If all criteria are met, initiate the AR experience.
*   **AR Content Delivery:**
    *   Fetch the AR content from the URL.
    *   Utilize the device’s AR capabilities (ARKit, ARCore) to render the content overlayed on the real-world view.

**3. Dynamic Content Updates:**

*   **Real-time Content Modification:** Allow AR content to be dynamically updated without requiring a full app update. (e.g., changing the text displayed in an AR label, updating the price of a product displayed in AR).
*   **Push Notifications:** Send push notifications to users when AR content associated with their phrases has been updated.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
// On Message Received
function handleMessage(message) {
  phrase = extractPhrase(message)
  rules = getUserRules(phrase)

  for (rule in rules) {
    if (rule.AR_Trigger == true) {
      // Get User Location
      userLocation = getCurrentLocation()

      //Check if within Activation Radius
      distance = calculateDistance(userLocation, rule.location)
      if (distance <= rule.activationRadius) {

        //Check Temporal Constraints
        if (isWithinTemporalConstraints(rule.temporalConstraints)) {

          //Check Contextual Filters
          if (meetsContextualFilters(rule.contextualFilters)) {

            //Load AR content
            arContent = loadARContent(rule.arContentURL)

            //Display AR content
            displayARContent(arContent)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Retail:**  A phrase like “ShoeSale” could trigger an AR overlay showcasing discounted shoes when the user is near a shoe store.
*   **Tourism:** A phrase like “HistoricalFacts” could overlay historical information onto landmarks.
*   **Personal Reminders:** A phrase like “GroceryList” could display an AR grocery list when the user enters a supermarket.
*   **Gamification:** A phrase like “TreasureHunt” could trigger AR clues in a real-world treasure hunt.
*   **Smart Home Integration**: A phrase like “MovieNight” could dim the lights and activate an AR scene related to the movie.
