## Adaptive Hash Granularity with Connection State Propagation

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the hash bucket size and propagate connection state information across buckets based on observed collision rates and network traffic patterns. This goes beyond fixed bucket sizes and aims for a self-optimizing memory access scheme.

**Specifications:**

**1. Monitoring Module:**

*   **Input:** Network packet data, Hash bucket access logs (first hash value, accessed bucket, collision flag).
*   **Process:** Continuously monitor hash bucket access patterns. Calculate collision rates per bucket. Track access frequencies. Detect traffic bursts or anomalies.
*   **Output:** Collision rate map, Access frequency map, Anomaly flags.

**2. Granularity Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Input:** Collision rate map, Access frequency map, Anomaly flags, Current bucket size configuration.
*   **Process:** 
    *   If a bucket’s collision rate exceeds a threshold, *split* the bucket into smaller buckets. The splitting process should distribute existing entries based on a secondary hash function applied to the original hash key.
    *   If a bucket’s access frequency falls below a threshold *and* the total number of buckets exceeds a minimum, *merge* adjacent buckets. The merging process must reconcile any conflicting entries.
    *   Adaptive threshold adjustment: the thresholds for splitting and merging are adjusted based on overall system load and memory availability.
*   **Output:** Updated bucket size configuration, List of buckets to split/merge, Migration instructions for entries.

**3. Connection State Propagation Module:**

*   **Input:** Migration instructions, Connection state entries, Access frequency map.
*   **Process:**
    *   When a bucket splits or merges, propagate relevant connection state information to the newly created or combined buckets. This ensures that connections are not lost during dynamic resizing.
    *   Implement a ‘least recently used’ (LRU) eviction policy within each bucket, but allow for ‘cross-bucket’ LRU. Meaning, if a bucket is splitting, the least recently used entries across *both* buckets are considered for eviction.
    *   Enable ‘state shadowing’. When a connection state entry is accessed, a copy is temporarily stored in a faster cache (e.g., a small array associated with each hash key). Subsequent accesses can then be served from the cache, reducing memory access latency.
*   **Output:** Updated connection state entries, Cache updates.

**4. Memory Allocation & Management:**

*   Implement a dynamically sized memory pool for hash buckets.
*   Support efficient allocation and deallocation of buckets.
*   Minimize memory fragmentation.
*   Allow for pre-allocation of buckets based on anticipated traffic patterns.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Adjustment Engine):**

```
function adjust_granularity(collision_map, frequency_map, current_config):
  for each bucket in collision_map:
    if collision_map[bucket] > HIGH_COLLISION_THRESHOLD:
      split_bucket(bucket, current_config)
    elif frequency_map[bucket] < LOW_FREQUENCY_THRESHOLD and num_buckets > MIN_BUCKETS:
      merge_bucket(bucket, current_config)

function split_bucket(bucket, current_config):
  new_buckets = create_new_buckets(bucket)
  redistribute_entries(bucket, new_buckets)
  update_current_config(new_buckets)

function merge_bucket(bucket, current_config):
  adjacent_bucket = find_adjacent_bucket(bucket)
  merge_entries(bucket, adjacent_bucket)
  deallocate_bucket(bucket)
  update_current_config(adjacent_bucket)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced collision rates and improved memory access performance.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing network traffic patterns.
*   Increased memory efficiency.
*   Improved scalability.
*   Lower latency for connection state lookups.
