## Adaptive Haptic Guidance System

**Concept:** Extend the visual overlay guidance system with localized haptic feedback on the touchscreen display. This allows for guidance *through touch*, improving accessibility and potentially speeding up task completion.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** Integrate a high-resolution array of micro-actuators beneath the touchscreen. These actuators should be capable of creating localized vibrations, bumps, or subtle deformations on the screen surface. Resolution should be at least 1mm spacing, ideally finer.
*   **Guidance Mode Selection:** Implement a user-selectable "Haptic Guidance" mode within the remote support application. This mode activates the haptic feedback system.
*   **Support Agent Control:**  The support agent interface should include tools to *draw* haptic guidance paths directly on the user’s screen view. The agent should be able to define path width, intensity, and pattern (e.g., continuous vibration, pulsing, directional arrows).
*   **Dynamic Haptic Shaping:**  The system should dynamically shape the haptic feedback based on the overlay visual guidance.  If a visual arrow points to a button, the haptic feedback should intensify *at the tip* of the arrow, effectively "drawing" the user’s finger to the correct location.
*   **Force Feedback Profiles:**  Predefined force feedback profiles optimized for common tasks (e.g., "tap," "swipe," "drag") should be available. Agents can select these profiles or customize them.
*   **User Sensitivity Adjustment:**  Allow users to adjust the intensity of the haptic feedback to their preference.
*   **Haptic Data Transmission:** Establish a dedicated data channel for transmitting haptic guidance information from the support agent’s computer to the user's device. This channel should prioritize low latency.
*   **Simultaneous Multi-Touch Support:** The haptic system must function correctly with multi-touch input.  It should not interfere with standard touchscreen gestures.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a system for resolving conflicts between visual guidance, haptic guidance, and user input.  For example, if the user initiates an action that conflicts with the haptic guidance, the haptic feedback should temporarily pause.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Guidance Update):**

```
function UpdateHapticGuidance(visualGuidanceData, touchInputData):
  // visualGuidanceData: Array of points/paths defining visual guidance
  // touchInputData: Current touch location/gesture

  // Convert visual guidance data to haptic guidance data
  hapticGuidanceData = ConvertVisualToHaptic(visualGuidanceData)

  // Adjust haptic intensity based on proximity to touch input
  for each point in hapticGuidanceData:
    distance = CalculateDistance(point, touchInputData)
    if distance < threshold:
      hapticIntensity = MaxIntensity - (distance / threshold) * MaxIntensity
    else:
      hapticIntensity = 0

  // Apply haptic feedback to touchscreen actuators
  ApplyHapticFeedback(hapticGuidanceData, hapticIntensity)
end function
```
