## Dynamic Content ‘Resurrection’ via Predictive Expiration & Automated Variant Generation

**Concept:** Extend the system to *proactively* identify content nearing expiration and automatically generate variations of that content (different wording, images, calls to action) to test against the original before it expires. This moves beyond simply *detecting* expiration to actively *mitigating* its impact and learning from expiring content.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Expiration Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Content identifier, original content metadata (creation date, initial performance metrics), historical expiration data (how similar content has performed leading up to expiration).
    *   Process: Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict the likelihood of content expiration *before* the official expiration date.  Model training uses historical data on content performance (clicks, conversions) *leading up to* past expirations.  Factors include diminishing returns, engagement drops, and campaign budget depletion.
    *   Output:  A "Resurrection Score" (0.0 - 1.0) indicating the probability the content will expire without achieving desired results.  A threshold score triggers the Variant Generation Module.

2.  **Variant Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Original content (text, images, URL), Resurrection Score.
    *   Process:
        *   **Text Variation:** Utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate multiple text variations of the original content.  Prompt the LLM with instructions to maintain the core message but vary phrasing, tone, and call to action.  Control variance via a parameter (e.g., `creativity_level` from 0.0 - 1.0).
        *   **Image Variation:** Employ a generative image model (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) to create visually similar but distinct images.  Control variation via style prompts (e.g., "photorealistic," "cartoon," "minimalist").
        *   **A/B Testing Framework:** Automatically create A/B tests with the original content as the control group and the generated variations as test groups.
    *   Output: Multiple content variations, each linked to an A/B test instance.

3.  **Dynamic Slot Prioritization:**
    *   Input: A/B test results, content Resurrection Score, slot ranking (from the base patent).
    *   Process:  Dynamically adjust slot prioritization based on real-time A/B test performance.  If a content variation is significantly outperforming the original, *immediately* promote that variation to the higher-ranked slots.  This overrides the pre-defined slot ranking to maximize engagement.
    *   Output:  An updated slot ranking reflecting real-time performance.

4.  **Content ‘Archive’ & Re-Use Pipeline:**
    *   Input: Expired content, A/B test data, performance metrics.
    *   Process:  Archive expired content *along with* its associated A/B test data.  Analyze the A/B test results to identify the most effective variations.  Tag these successful variations for potential re-use in future campaigns or content creation.  
    *   Output:  An archived content database with performance annotations and re-use tags.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_expiration(content_id, historical_data):
  resurrection_score = time_series_forecasting(historical_data)
  return resurrection_score

function generate_variants(content, resurrection_score):
  if resurrection_score > threshold:
    text_variants = generate_text_variations(content.text)
    image_variants = generate_image_variations(content.image)
    variants = [Variant(text=t, image=i) for t, i in zip(text_variants, image_variants)]
    return variants
  else:
    return []

function dynamic_slot_prioritization(ab_test_results, slot_ranking):
  for result in ab_test_results:
    if result.performance > threshold:
      update_slot_ranking(result.content_id, higher_rank)
  return updated_slot_ranking
```

This system aims to move beyond simple expiration detection to proactive content optimization and re-use, minimizing wasted effort and maximizing engagement. It leverages generative AI to create variations, A/B testing to identify the most effective content, and dynamic slot prioritization to deliver the best possible user experience.
