## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Code Complexity

**Specification:** System for predicting code complexity from pre-trigger notifications and dynamically allocating resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) *before* virtual machine instantiation. This goes beyond simply scaling the *number* of VMs, and focuses on tailoring the resources *within* each VM.

**Core Concept:**  The system assesses the anticipated computational load of the incoming code *before* it executes. Pre-trigger notifications aren't just signals of *volume*, but contain metadata indicating the *type* of code being submitted. This metadata is used to predict complexity.

**Components:**

1.  **Complexity Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on a dataset of code snippets, their execution profiles (CPU usage, memory access patterns, network I/O), and associated metadata (programming language, libraries used, algorithm type â€“ e.g., sorting, searching, image processing).  Input: Pre-trigger notification metadata. Output: Predicted complexity score (e.g., low, medium, high) and resource requirements (CPU cores, RAM, network bandwidth).

2.  **Resource Profile Database:** A database mapping complexity scores to optimized resource profiles.  For example:
    *   Low Complexity: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 10 Mbps bandwidth
    *   Medium Complexity: 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 50 Mbps bandwidth
    *   High Complexity: 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 100 Mbps bandwidth + GPU access

3.  **Pre-Instantiation Manager:** Monitors pre-trigger notifications. Upon receiving a notification, the Pre-Instantiation Manager queries the Complexity Prediction Engine to determine the appropriate resource profile. It then proactively requests the cloud provider (or hypervisor) to create VMs with the specified resources *before* the actual code execution request arrives. 

4. **Dynamic Adjustment Module**:  Monitors initial code execution.  If actual resource usage deviates significantly from the predicted usage, this module dynamically adjusts the VM's resources (within defined limits) to optimize performance and cost.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On receiving a pre-trigger notification
function handlePreTriggerNotification(notification) {
  complexityScore = ComplexityPredictionEngine.predictComplexity(notification.metadata)
  resourceProfile = ResourceProfileDatabase.getResourceProfile(complexityScore)

  // Request VM creation with specified resources
  CloudProvider.createVM(resourceProfile)
}

// On receiving a code execution request
function handleCodeExecutionRequest(request, vmInstance) {
  // Execute code on pre-initialized VM
  vmInstance.execute(request.code)

  // Monitor resource usage during initial execution
  resourceUsage = Monitor.getResourceUsage(vmInstance)

  // If usage deviates significantly from prediction:
  if (resourceUsage.cpu > predictedCpu * 1.2) {
    // Scale up CPU cores
    CloudProvider.scaleCpu(vmInstance, predictedCpu * 1.5)
  }
  // Repeat for memory and network
}
```

**Innovation:**  Current systems focus on *scaling out* (adding more VMs). This system prioritizes *scaling deep* (optimizing resources *within* each VM) *before* instantiation.  This reduces latency and improves resource utilization, particularly for computationally intensive tasks.  The integration of machine learning for predicting code complexity allows for proactive resource allocation.
