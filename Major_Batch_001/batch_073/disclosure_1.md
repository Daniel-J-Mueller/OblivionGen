## Dynamic Contextual Result Prioritization & “Ambient Mode”

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple context awareness (user type, location, time) to actively *learn* and prioritize results based on a constantly evolving user “state” derived from multi-modal input – not just speech, but also environmental sensors (light, sound, motion), and potentially biometric data (heart rate variability, skin conductance – *with explicit user consent and privacy controls*).  This goes beyond predicting *what* the user wants, to anticipating *how* they want it presented – visual density, audio complexity, interaction style.  Introduce an "Ambient Mode" where the system proactively displays relevant information *before* being asked, anticipating needs.

**Specs:**

**1. Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion Module:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   Speech Data (from existing system)
    *   Ambient Light Sensor Data
    *   Ambient Sound Level (and analysis – identifying keywords or patterns)
    *   Motion Sensor Data (detecting activity level – stationary, walking, driving)
    *   *Optional (with consent):* Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Skin Conductance (via wearable device integration)
*   **Processing:**
    *   Sensor data is timestamped and correlated with speech input.
    *   Machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network preferred) learns to identify patterns associating sensor data with user preferences (e.g., high ambient sound + rapid speech = prioritize concise results; low light + stationary = prioritize visually calming content; increased HRV + specific keyword = prioritize actionable items).
    *   Output:  “User State Vector” – a numerical representation of the user’s current context and inferred preferences.

**2. Dynamic Result Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   User Query (from existing system)
    *   Content Source Results (from existing system)
    *   User State Vector (from Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion Module)
*   **Processing:**
    *   Results are scored based on relevance to the query *and* alignment with the User State Vector.  For example:
        *   If User State indicates high cognitive load (high HRV, rapid speech), prioritize short, direct answers or summaries.
        *   If User State indicates relaxation (low light, stationary, low HRV), prioritize visually appealing, exploratory content.
        *   Use a weighted scoring system allowing adjustment of prioritization based on specific contexts.
    *   Re-rank results based on the combined score.

**3. "Ambient Mode" Implementation:**

*   **Trigger:** Activated by system idle state (no speech input for a defined period) *and* positive User State indicators (e.g., consistent patterns suggesting routine activity).
*   **Content Generation:** Proactively displays relevant information based on:
    *   Historical user data (most frequently accessed content)
    *   Calendar events (upcoming meetings, appointments)
    *   Real-time information (weather, traffic, news headlines)
    *   Personalized recommendations based on User State
*   **Presentation:**  Low-intensity visual display (minimal brightness, subtle animations) or ambient audio cues.  Designed to be non-intrusive and informative without requiring direct interaction.
*   **Interaction:**  A simple voice command ("Dismiss" or "More") allows the user to acknowledge or expand the Ambient Mode display.

**Pseudocode (Ambient Mode Activation):**

```
function checkAmbientModeActivation() {
  if (systemIdle && positiveUserStateIndicators()) {
    generateAmbientModeContent()
    displayAmbientModeContent(lowBrightness, subtleAnimations)
  } else {
    clearAmbientModeContent()
  }
}

function positiveUserStateIndicators() {
  // Check for consistent patterns suggesting routine activity
  // (e.g., consistent location, time of day, activity level)
  //  AND
  //  Absence of indicators suggesting focused attention (e.g., rapid speech, high HRV)
  return (routineActivityDetected && !focusedAttentionDetected)
}

function generateAmbientModeContent() {
  // Retrieve historical data, calendar events, real-time info, recommendations
  //  Combine into a cohesive display
}

function displayAmbientModeContent(brightness, animations) {
  // Render content on display with specified settings
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Ambient Light Sensor
*   Microphone Array (for ambient sound analysis)
*   Motion Sensor (accelerometer/gyroscope)
*   Integration with wearable devices (optional, requires user consent)
