## Autonomous Swarm Debris Mitigation System

**Concept:** Expand the robot's object classification and response beyond individual obstacle avoidance, into a coordinated swarm system for actively *removing* small debris from warehouse floors or other environments. This isn't just avoidance; it’s cleaning.

**System Specs:**

*   **Robot Base:** Utilize existing robot platform with drive system, object detection (LiDAR, cameras), RFID reader, 3D scanner, and processor.
*   **Swarm Communication:** Implement a short-range, secure mesh network (e.g., UWB, Bluetooth 5+) allowing robots to communicate position, detected object data (type, size, location), and assigned tasks.
*   **Debris Collection Module:** Add a small, integrated suction/vacuum system to each robot, with a self-emptying debris container. Container size to be optimized for frequent emptying at designated stations.
*   **Central Coordination Unit:** A local server or cloud service manages the swarm, receives floor maps, and assigns cleaning tasks. Algorithm prioritizes areas with high debris density.
*   **Object Classification Expansion:**  Modify existing classification to include granular debris types: "cardboard scrap," "plastic wrap," "small packaging," “pallet splinter”, etc.  Training data to be generated via simulated debris fields and real-world capture.
*   **Swarm Logic:**
    *   **Mapping & Task Assignment:** The central unit divides the environment into sectors, assigns robots to sectors, and updates assignments dynamically based on robot status & debris density.
    *   **Debris Detection & Tagging:** Robots scan sectors. Identified debris is “tagged” with location & type data transmitted to the central unit.
    *   **Cooperative Collection:**
        *   If debris is small enough for a single robot, it autonomously collects it.
        *   If debris is larger (e.g., a torn piece of cardboard), multiple robots converge on the location. They collaboratively lift/move the debris to a designated disposal point.
        *   If a robot encounters an unclassifiable object, it signals the central unit, which may dispatch a human operator for manual intervention.
    *   **Docking/Emptying:** Robots automatically navigate to designated docking stations to empty debris containers & recharge.
    *   **Dynamic Re-routing:** If a robot encounters a blockage or unexpected obstacle, it communicates the information to the central unit, which re-routes the robot & adjusts the cleaning schedule accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Logic – Debris Collection):**

```
// Robot Code
loop:
    scan_environment()
    detect_objects()
    for each object in detected_objects:
        if object.type == "debris":
            if object.size <= single_robot_capacity:
                collect_debris(object)
            else:
                signal_swarm(object.location, object.size, object.type)  // Request assistance
                wait_for_assistance()
                collaborate_collection(object)
    
    if debris_container_full():
        navigate_to_docking_station()
        empty_debris_container()
        recharge()

// Central Unit Code
loop:
    receive_robot_data()
    update_environment_map()
    
    if new_debris_detected():
        if debris_size > single_robot_capacity:
            assign_multiple_robots(debris_location)
        else:
            assign_robot(debris_location)
```
