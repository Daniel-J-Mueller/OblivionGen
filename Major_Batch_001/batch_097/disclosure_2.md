## Adaptive Proximity-Based Communication Hub

**Concept:** Expand the notion of escalation beyond simple message exchange rate to leverage spatial awareness and create a dynamic communication hub. The system will become aware of the physical proximity of users to devices and automatically configure communication modes (voice, video, text) based on this proximity, anticipating needs before escalation thresholds are met.

**Specifications:**

**1. Device Integration & Sensor Suite:**

*   Each speech-controlled device integrates with:
    *   Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio for precise indoor positioning (accuracy < 30cm).
    *   Low-resolution camera (for basic human detection/pose estimation - privacy focused).
    *   Ambient sound sensor (for identifying environmental context - e.g. background noise).
*   Devices broadcast UWB beacons and periodically capture camera/audio data.

**2. Spatial Awareness Engine:**

*   A central server maintains a dynamic map of device locations and identified user positions.
*   Algorithm uses triangulation/multilateration based on UWB signals to determine distances between devices and users.
*   Computer vision analyzes camera data to confirm human presence/identity (facial recognition optional, but requires explicit user consent).  Focus on pose estimation to infer activity (e.g., facing device, gesturing).
*   Ambient sound analysis provides contextual clues (e.g., identifying a phone call in progress, detecting shouting).

**3. Dynamic Communication Mode Selection:**

*   **Proximity Zones:** Define multiple proximity zones around each device (e.g., "Immediate" < 50cm, "Near" 1-3m, "Far" > 3m).
*   **Mode Mapping:**  Configure communication mode based on zone & context:
    *   **Immediate:**  Assumes a private, hands-free conversation. Automatically initiates direct voice call/audio streaming *without* a wakeword or explicit command.
    *   **Near:**  Assumes a collaborative environment.  Displays a contextual menu on the device offering options: "Share Screen", "Start Group Chat", "Send File".  Voice commands still active, but prioritized towards collaboration features.
    *   **Far:**  Default messaging mode. Wakeword required.
*   **Activity-Based Mode Shift:**  If the Spatial Awareness Engine detects a user actively gesturing towards a device, the system can preemptively shift to a more interactive mode (e.g., displaying a visual interface, initiating a video call).
*   **Adaptive Privacy:** System will not enable immediate communication mode if other humans are detected nearby, preventing accidental disclosure of information.

**4. Communication Escalation Override:**

*   Traditional escalation triggers (message rate) are still active, but are *de-prioritized* in favor of proximity-based mode selection.
*   If a user explicitly requests a different communication mode (e.g., "Send a text"), the system will override the proximity-based setting.

**5.  Pseudocode â€“ Mode Selection Logic:**

```
function selectCommunicationMode(device, user) {
  distance = calculateDistance(device, user);
  proximityZone = determineProximityZone(distance);

  if (userExplicitlyRequestedMode != null) {
    return userExplicitlyRequestedMode;
  }

  if (proximityZone == "Immediate") {
    if (privacyCheck(device)) {
      return "DirectVoiceCall";
    } else {
      return "DefaultMessaging";
    }
  } else if (proximityZone == "Near") {
    return "CollaborationMenu";
  } else {
    return "DefaultMessaging";
  }
}
```

**6.  Hardware Requirements:**

*   Speech-controlled devices with UWB radio, low-resolution camera, and ambient sound sensor.
*   Central server with sufficient processing power to handle spatial awareness calculations and communication management.

**7. Future Considerations:**

*   Integration with smart home devices (lighting, thermostats) to create a more immersive communication experience.
*   Personalized proximity settings based on user preferences and habits.
*   Support for multiple users and devices in a shared environment.
