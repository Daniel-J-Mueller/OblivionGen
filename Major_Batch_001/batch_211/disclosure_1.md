## Adaptive Data Shadowing with Predictive Pre-Migration

**Concept:** Extend the migration framework by introducing a 'shadowing' phase *before* actual data movement, combined with predictive pre-migration based on access patterns. This allows for a significantly smoother transition with minimal downtime and improved performance *during* migration.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadowing Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors read/write operations to the source database.
*   **Mechanism:** Intercepts all database access requests. For each request:
    *   Writes the same operation (read or write) to both the source database *and* a designated ‘shadow’ storage (could be a temporary distributed store mirroring the destination).
    *   Maintains a mapping (similar to the existing key-location mapping) indicating the data is now present in both locations.
    *   The shadowing module operates independently of the main migration process initially.
*   **Configuration:**  Admin configurable 'shadowing start' trigger (e.g., percentage of peak load, specific time window).  Shadowing can be enabled/disabled per table or database schema.

**2. Predictive Pre-Migration Engine:**

*   **Data Collection:**  Analyze shadowing logs to identify frequently accessed data items (rows, columns, or combinations). Uses a time-decay algorithm to prioritize recent accesses.
*   **Pre-Migration Scheduling:** Based on access frequency and data size, schedule data items for *proactive* migration to the destination distributed storage *before* a full cutover is initiated.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Employ optimistic locking. If a write occurs to a pre-migrated data item in the source database, the destination is updated as soon as possible.

**3. Migration Orchestration Updates:**

*   **Combined Approach:** The existing migration process remains largely intact. However, it now leverages the pre-migrated data whenever possible.
*   **Access Redirection:** During migration, the access redirection logic is updated to first check if the requested data is already present in the destination store (due to pre-migration). If so, serve the data directly from the destination.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning Adjustment:** The predictive pre-migration data can inform intelligent partitioning of the distributed storage. Frequently accessed data can be placed on faster or more readily available partitions.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
//Shadowing Module
OnDataAccess(operation, key, data) {
  PerformOperationOnSourceDatabase(operation, key, data);
  PerformOperationOnShadowStorage(operation, key, data);
  UpdateKeyLocationMapping(key, "source and shadow");
}

//Predictive Pre-Migration Engine
AnalyzeShadowingLogs() {
  calculateAccessFrequency(key);
  if (accessFrequency(key) > threshold && dataSize(key) < maxPreMigrationSize) {
    moveData(key, "source", "destination");
    UpdateKeyLocationMapping(key, "destination");
  }
}

//Access Redirection Logic
GetData(key) {
  location = getKeyLocation(key);
  if (location == "destination") {
    return GetDataFromDestination(key);
  } else {
    return GetDataFromSource(key);
  }
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   The Shadowing Module should be lightweight and have minimal impact on the source database performance.
*   A robust logging and monitoring system is crucial for analyzing access patterns and identifying potential bottlenecks.
*   The Predictive Pre-Migration Engine may require significant processing power and memory, depending on the size of the data and the complexity of the access patterns.
*   The key-location mapping should be highly scalable and efficient.
