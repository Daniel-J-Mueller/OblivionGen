## Dynamic TTL & Predictive Failure Mitigation - "Ghosting"

**Concept:** Extend dynamic TTL beyond simple health check responsiveness and introduce *predictive* TTL adjustments based on historical connection attempt patterns *after* a health check passes. Essentially, "ghost" failed connection attempts to preemptively shorten TTLs *before* widespread failures occur.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Analysis Module:**

*   **Connection Attempt Logging:** Client-side (or edge-server) logging of *all* connection attempts to services resolved via this dynamic TTL system.  Logs must include: timestamp, IP address attempted, success/failure status, latency (if successful), client geolocation (optional, but valuable).
*   **Historical Data Storage:** Time-series database optimized for rapid aggregation and querying of connection attempt data.  Data retention policy configurable (e.g., 7 days, 30 days).
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Algorithm to identify statistically significant increases in connection failure rates to specific IPs.  This isn't about immediate failures, but a *trend* towards increasing failures.  Algorithm should account for:
    *   Time of day/week patterns (e.g., increased load during business hours).
    *   Geographic patterns (e.g., localized network issues).
    *   Rolling averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations.

**2. Predictive TTL Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Baseline Establishment:**  For each IP address, establish a baseline connection success rate based on historical data.
*   **Deviation Trigger:**  When the current connection success rate falls below a configurable threshold (e.g., 90% of baseline) *for a sustained period* (e.g., 5 minutes), the Predictive TTL Adjustment Engine is triggered.
*   **TTL Reduction Algorithm:**  Instead of immediately failing over, *gradually* reduce the TTL.  The rate of reduction is configurable and can be adaptive.  Example algorithm:
    *   If deviation is slight (95-99% of baseline): Reduce TTL by 5%.
    *   If deviation is moderate (90-95% of baseline): Reduce TTL by 15%.
    *   If deviation is severe (<90% of baseline): Reduce TTL by 30%.
*   **Adaptive Reduction:** Monitor subsequent connection attempts. If the reduced TTL results in a decrease in failed connections, continue the reduction. If not, revert to a more conservative approach.
*   **TTL Maximum/Minimum:** Configurable minimum and maximum TTL values to prevent excessively short or long TTLs.

**3. System Integration:**

*   **Integration with Existing DNS Infrastructure:**  Designed to be a drop-in replacement for traditional DNS servers, or a caching layer in front of them.
*   **API for Configuration and Monitoring:**  REST API for configuring thresholds, algorithms, and monitoring system performance.
*   **Data Export:**  Ability to export connection attempt data for further analysis.

**Pseudocode (Predictive TTL Adjustment):**

```
function adjustTTL(ipAddress, currentTTL, currentFailureRate, baselineFailureRate):
  deviation = (currentFailureRate - baselineFailureRate) / baselineFailureRate

  if deviation > 0.05:  // 5% deviation
    reductionRate = 0.15  // 15% reduction
    newTTL = currentTTL * (1 - reductionRate)
    newTTL = max(newTTL, minTTL)  // Ensure within bounds
  else:
    // Gradually increase TTL if failure rate improves
    // (Implementation omitted for brevity)
  return newTTL
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Failure Mitigation:** Reduce the impact of server outages or performance degradation by preemptively shortening TTLs.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Minimize connection errors and latency.
*   **Reduced Load on DNS Servers:**  By proactively shortening TTLs, reduce the frequency of DNS queries.
*   **Data-Driven Optimization:**  Use historical data to optimize TTL values and improve system performance.
