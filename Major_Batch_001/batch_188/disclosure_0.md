## Adaptive Health Check Granularity & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust health check frequency and scope based on real-time service performance metrics *and* predictive modeling of potential failures, moving beyond simple pass/fail checks.

**Components:**

1.  **Performance Data Collector:** Collects metrics beyond basic HTTP status codes. Includes latency, throughput, error rates (categorized – e.g., 4xx, 5xx), CPU/memory usage of the server, disk I/O, network bandwidth. This data is streamed to the Predictive Analysis Engine.

2.  **Predictive Analysis Engine:**  A machine learning model trained on historical performance data and known failure patterns. It predicts the probability of failure for each server within a specified timeframe.  Models could include time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) combined with anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).  The output is a 'health score' for each server.

3.  **Dynamic Health Check Controller:**  This component receives the health score from the Predictive Analysis Engine and adjusts the frequency and *type* of health checks accordingly.

    *   **High Health Score (Healthy):** Reduced frequency of standard health checks. Focus on 'spot checks' to confirm basic functionality.
    *   **Medium Health Score (Warning):** Increased frequency of standard health checks. Introduction of more granular checks focusing on specific service components (e.g., database connectivity, cache performance).
    *   **Low Health Score (Critical):**  Very frequent and comprehensive health checks.  Activation of 'synthetic transactions' – simulating user behavior to identify performance bottlenecks.  Automated notification to the hosting system to preemptively migrate traffic or scale resources.

4.  **Adaptive Health Check Types:**  Beyond simple HTTP GET requests:

    *   **Database Query Performance Checks:**  Execute representative database queries to measure response times and identify slow queries.
    *   **Cache Hit/Miss Ratio Checks:** Measure the efficiency of caching layers.
    *   **Dependency Health Checks:** Verify the availability of external dependencies (e.g., message queues, APIs).
    *   **Synthetic Transactions:** Simulate user workflows to identify end-to-end performance issues.

5.  **Automated Remediation Integration:**  Integration with the hosting system to automatically trigger remediation actions based on health check results (e.g., scaling up resources, restarting services, rolling back deployments).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Health Check Controller):**

```python
def adjust_health_checks(server_id, health_score):
  if health_score > 0.8:  # Healthy
    check_frequency = 60 * 60  # Once per hour
    check_type = "basic_http"
  elif health_score > 0.5:  # Warning
    check_frequency = 60 * 15  # Every 15 minutes
    check_type = "database_query_performance"
  else:  # Critical
    check_frequency = 60 * 5  # Every 5 minutes
    check_type = "synthetic_transaction"

  # Send instruction to Health Check Executor to perform check
  health_check_executor.perform_check(server_id, check_type, check_frequency)
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Performance Data Collector -> Predictive Analysis Engine
2.  Predictive Analysis Engine -> Dynamic Health Check Controller
3.  Dynamic Health Check Controller -> Health Check Executor
4.  Health Check Executor -> Servers
5.  Servers -> Health Check Executor
6.  Health Check Executor -> Dynamic Health Check Controller & Hosting System (for alerts/remediation)

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive health checking to *proactive* failure prediction and adaptive testing, tailoring the level of scrutiny to the individual server's risk profile. It isn't just *whether* a server is up, but *how likely* it is to fail soon, and adjusting the checks accordingly.
