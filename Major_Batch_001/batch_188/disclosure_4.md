## Adaptive Internal Suspension System – Airbag Container

**Concept:** Integrate a secondary, actively controlled internal suspension system within the airbag container to isolate sensitive items from shock and vibration *after* initial impact absorption by the airbag itself. This goes beyond simply cushioning; it aims to maintain a stable internal environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Internal Framework:** A network of miniature, interconnected pneumatic ‘cells’ suspended within the main airbag cavity. These cells are *not* directly inflated with the primary inflation gas.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Miniature accelerometers and gyroscopes embedded within the internal framework to detect movement and orientation changes.
*   **Micro-Pump/Valve System:** Each cell is connected to a micro-pump and valve system controlled by a central processing unit (CPU).
*   **CPU & Power:** Low-power CPU, housed in a protected compartment within the airbag container. Powered by a small, rechargeable battery (wireless charging preferred).
*   **Control Algorithm:** Real-time control algorithm that adjusts the pressure in each cell based on sensor data. The algorithm focuses on *reducing* the transfer of kinetic energy to the contained item.
*   **Materials:** Pneumatic cells constructed from flexible, high-strength polymers. Internal framework constructed from lightweight composite materials.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth or similar wireless communication module for diagnostics and potential remote control.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
Initialize sensors, pump system, and control parameters.

Loop:
    Read accelerometer and gyroscope data.
    Calculate item displacement and velocity.
    Predict item movement based on current conditions.
    Adjust pressure in individual pneumatic cells to counteract predicted movement.
    Repeat.
```

**Detailed Description:**

The primary airbag provides initial impact absorption. Once the initial force is dissipated, the internal suspension system takes over. The sensor suite detects any residual movement of the item within the container. The CPU analyzes this data and activates the micro-pumps to selectively inflate or deflate individual cells, effectively creating a localized counterforce to stabilize the item. For example, if the item begins to tilt to the left, cells on the right side would be inflated to provide support.  The system would be tuned to specific object types (fragile, liquid, electronic) or potentially learn object characteristics through initial data acquisition. The system does not attempt to *completely* eliminate movement, but to dampen and control it.
