## Adaptive Spectrum Allocation with Predictive Multicast

**Concept:** Leverage the bitmap-based recovery system described in the patent as a signaling mechanism for *proactive* spectrum allocation optimization, anticipating device needs *before* recovery requests are made. Instead of just reacting to missing data, the system learns patterns and adjusts spectrum use to maximize multicast efficiency.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Spectrum Prediction Engine (SPE):**  Located on the server/control access point.
    *   Input: Device registration data, initial bitmap data, real-time channel quality indicators (CQI) from devices, historical multicast consumption patterns per device type/group.
    *   Process:  Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) preferred – to predict, for each device, the probability of needing recovery data for *future* multicast segments.  The prediction is based on the history of bitmap requests, CQI fluctuations, and general usage patterns. Output is a "Recovery Risk Score" (RRS) – a normalized value between 0 and 1.
    *   Output: RRS for each connected device.

*   **Component 2: Dynamic Spectrum Allocator (DSA):** Integrated with the multicast access point.
    *   Input:  RRS from SPE, available spectrum bands, current channel utilization, device proximity data.
    *   Process:  Prioritizes spectrum allocation based on RRS. Devices with high RRS are given preferential access to wider bandwidth or less congested channels for the *upcoming* multicast segment.  DSA employs a proportional allocation scheme – higher RRS results in a larger share of available bandwidth. A genetic algorithm (GA) component dynamically adjusts the allocation scheme to optimize overall throughput and minimize interference.
    *   Output: Spectrum allocation parameters (channel, bandwidth) for each device for the next multicast segment.

*   **Component 3:  Bitrate Adaptation Module (BAM):** Resident on the device.
    *   Input:  Channel quality reports (CQRs), allocated bandwidth, predicted RRS (sent from server via initial bitmap).
    *   Process: Uses the allocated bandwidth to decode the incoming data and can make predictions regarding the likelihood of lost segments. Allows the device to proactively make intelligent decisions as to the allocation of resources.
    *   Output: Device resource allocation.

*   **Signaling Protocol Extension:**  
    *   The initial bitmap sent by the server now *includes* the predicted RRS for the device. This allows the device's BAM to proactively adjust its decoding parameters and resource allocation.
    *   Devices send "Channel Feedback Reports" (CFRs) back to the server, providing real-time channel quality information. These CFRs are used to refine the SPE’s prediction model.

**Pseudocode (SPE):**

```
//Initialization: Train RNN with historical data
RNN = train(historical_data)

//Per Device Prediction:
function predict_recovery_risk(device_id, current_bitmap, cqi_history) {
  input_vector = combine(current_bitmap, cqi_history)
  recovery_risk = RNN.predict(input_vector)
  return recovery_risk
}

//Update RNN with new data (after each multicast segment)
function update_model(device_id, actual_recovery_data, predicted_recovery_risk) {
  error = actual_recovery_data - predicted_recovery_risk
  RNN.train(error)
}
```

**Novelty:** This isn't simply about *reacting* to lost data; it's about *anticipating* it and proactively optimizing the wireless environment to minimize data loss *before* it occurs. It transforms the bitmap from a recovery mechanism into a predictive signaling system, fundamentally changing the way multicast data is delivered.  It combines machine learning, dynamic spectrum allocation, and intelligent device adaptation.
