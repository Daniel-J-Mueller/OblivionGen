## Haptic-Guided Acoustic Beamforming

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback with dynamic acoustic beamforming to create a spatially-aware audio experience. The system allows a user to “feel” the direction of audio, enhancing immersion and providing assistive capabilities.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing:** Cylindrical, approx. 15cm height, 8cm diameter. Material: Aluminum alloy with soft-touch polymer overmold.
*   **Microphone Array:** 8-element circular microphone array integrated into the top surface. Each microphone is independently steerable via software.
*   **Speaker Array:** 4 full-range drivers arranged in a vertical stack, capable of both coherent and incoherent sound emission. Drivers use phase array technology.
*   **Haptic Array:** An array of 16 micro-actuators embedded within a ring that sits flush with the top surface of the device, surrounding the microphone array. Actuators use piezoelectric technology for fast response times. Each actuator corresponds to a discrete angular position.
*   **Processor:** High-performance ARM processor with dedicated DSP for audio processing and haptic control.
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, USB-C for data and power.
*   **Power:** Internal rechargeable battery (minimum 8 hours playback).
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   **Acoustic Beamforming Algorithm:**  Utilizes a delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm enhanced with adaptive filtering to minimize noise and reflections. The beamforming direction is dynamically adjustable in both azimuth and elevation.
    *   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** Maps the beamforming direction to specific actuators in the haptic array.  Actuator intensity is proportional to the beamforming gain in that direction.  Smooth interpolation between actuators to create a continuous "feel."
    *   **Spatial Audio Engine:**  Processes multi-channel audio sources to create a 3D soundscape.  Audio objects are positioned in virtual space, and the system calculates the appropriate beamforming and haptic feedback.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Microphone Array
Initialize Speaker Array
Initialize Haptic Array
Load Spatial Audio Engine

// Main Loop
While (Device is On) {
    // 1. Capture Audio (ambient + user input)
    ambientAudio = CaptureAmbientAudio()
    userAudio = CaptureUserAudio()

    // 2. Spatial Audio Processing
    spatialAudio = ProcessSpatialAudio(ambientAudio, userAudio) // Applies 3D positioning and effects

    // 3. Beamforming Calculation
    beamformingWeights = CalculateBeamformingWeights(spatialAudio) // Based on desired audio focus

    // 4. Speaker Output
    OutputAudio(beamformingWeights)

    // 5. Haptic Feedback Calculation
    hapticActivation = CalculateHapticActivation(beamformingWeights)

    // 6. Haptic Activation
    ActivateHapticArray(hapticActivation)

    // 7. Device state handling, user input, etc.
}
```

**Function Details:**

*   `CalculateBeamformingWeights()`: This function determines the optimal weights for each speaker based on the desired audio direction and spatial properties.  It utilizes a delay-and-sum algorithm, adjusting for speaker geometry and acoustic properties.
*   `CalculateHapticActivation()`: This function maps the beamforming direction to the haptic array.  A lookup table or interpolation algorithm is used to determine which actuators should be activated, and at what intensity.
*    `ActivateHapticArray()`: Sends signals to individual actuators to create localized tactile sensations on the user's hand.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Gaming/VR:**  Feel the direction of sounds in a virtual environment.
*   **Assistive Technology:**  Aid individuals with hearing impairments by providing directional tactile cues.
*   **Navigation:**  Provide tactile feedback for turn-by-turn directions.
*   **Music Production:**  Spatial audio mixing and monitoring with tactile feedback.
*   **Accessibility**: Increase the accessibility for people who are visually impaired.
