## Adaptive Multi-Radio Congestion Avoidance

**Specification:** A system for proactively managing data transmission across heterogeneous wireless networks (cellular, Wi-Fi 6E/7, mmWave) *before* congestion occurs, leveraging predicted network performance based on historical data and real-time monitoring.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Radio Module:** Device incorporates at least two distinct wireless transceivers (e.g., 5G cellular & Wi-Fi 6E).
*   **Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU):** Dedicated hardware to collect real-time network statistics (RSSI, SNR, throughput, latency) from each transceiver.
*   **Predictive Processing Unit (PPU):**  A dedicated co-processor or a block within the main processor optimized for time-series forecasting and machine learning.
*   **Adaptive Routing Table:** A dynamically updated table stored in non-volatile memory to map data streams to optimal wireless interfaces.

**Software Components:**

*   **Network Performance Historian:** Records network statistics (PMU data) over time, tagged with application/data stream identifiers.
*   **Congestion Prediction Engine:** Trained ML model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) operating on historical data, predicting congestion likelihood for each radio interface. Input features include: time of day, location (GPS), application type, historical throughput, current throughput, interference levels.
*   **Dynamic Routing Algorithm:** Based on congestion predictions, this algorithm proactively selects the optimal wireless interface for each data stream. The algorithm considers:
    *   Predicted congestion level for each interface.
    *   Data stream priority (user-defined or application-defined).
    *   Interface capabilities (throughput, latency).
    *   Cost (cellular data vs. Wi-Fi).
*   **Seamless Handoff Manager:**  Handles transitioning data streams between wireless interfaces *before* congestion impacts performance.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Load Historical Data
Train Congestion Prediction Engine
Initialize Adaptive Routing Table

// Main Loop
For each new data stream:
    Determine data stream priority
    Predict congestion for each interface (using Congestion Prediction Engine)
    Select optimal interface based on:
        Predicted Congestion Level (lowest preferred)
        Data Stream Priority
        Interface Capabilities
        Cost
    Route data stream to selected interface
    Update Adaptive Routing Table

// Background Task (Periodic)
For each interface:
    Collect real-time network statistics (PMU)
    Update Congestion Prediction Engine model (online learning)
    Re-evaluate optimal routing for existing data streams (if congestion predictions change significantly)

//Handoff Procedure (triggered by congestion predictions)
If Prediction > Threshold:
    Identify Data Streams on Congested Interface
    For each Data Stream:
        If alternative Interface is available:
            Initiate seamless handoff to alternative Interface
            Update Adaptive Routing Table
            Notify Application of Handoff (optional)
```

**Novelty:**  This system focuses on *proactive* congestion avoidance through prediction, rather than reactive measures like retransmission or load balancing.  The multi-radio approach and dynamic routing algorithm enable seamless transitions between networks *before* performance degradation occurs. The use of machine learning to predict congestion allows the system to adapt to changing network conditions and user behavior.
