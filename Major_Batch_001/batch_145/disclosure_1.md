## Dynamic Translation Granularity & Perceptual Fidelity Adjustment

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on preemptive translation and quality ranking. This expands on that by introducing *dynamic granularity* of translation based on user perceptual needs and a system to actively adjust translation ‘fidelity’ – essentially, how ‘close’ to the original the translation is – in real time.

**Specs:**

*   **Perceptual Profile Creation:**
    *   User profile stores ‘perceptual sensitivity’ data – assessed via initial questionnaires (e.g., “How much does slight grammatical error bother you?”) and continuous implicit feedback (see below).
    *   Sensitivity dimensions: Grammar, Vocabulary, Nuance, Formality. Each dimension is assigned a sensitivity score (1-10).
*   **Content Analysis Module:**
    *   Analyzes incoming content (text, audio, video subtitles) to identify ‘perceptual risk’ elements. Examples:
        *   High-complexity sentence structures (risk: Grammar)
        *   Idiomatic expressions/slang (risk: Nuance)
        *   Technical jargon (risk: Vocabulary)
        *   Informal language in a formal context (risk: Formality)
    *   Assigns a 'Perceptual Risk Score' (PRS) to each content segment.
*   **Dynamic Granularity Engine:**
    *   Based on PRS and user perceptual profile, determines translation granularity:
        *   **High PRS / High Sensitivity:** Full, high-fidelity translation.
        *   **High PRS / Low Sensitivity:**  Acceptable loss of nuance/precision.
        *   **Low PRS / High Sensitivity:**  Minimal adjustment, focus on clarity.
        *   **Low PRS / Low Sensitivity:** Aggressive simplification/summarization.  (e.g. reduce sentence length, replace complex words with simpler synonyms.)
*   **Fidelity Adjustment Mechanism:**
    *   The translation service isn’t simply choosing from pre-generated translations. It *actively adjusts* parameters during translation.
    *   Parameters:
        *   **Lexical Precision:** (0-100%) Controls the probability of choosing a direct synonym vs. a broader equivalent.
        *   **Syntactic Complexity:**  Controls the degree to which sentence structures are simplified (e.g. breaking long sentences into shorter ones).
        *   **Cultural Adaptation:**  Controls the degree to which idioms and cultural references are localized.
*   **Implicit Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitors user behavior to refine the perceptual profile:
        *   **Reading Speed:** Slow reading speed on a translated segment suggests low quality/difficulty.
        *   **Re-translation Requests:** Requesting a re-translation implies dissatisfaction.
        *   **Highlighting/Selection:** Highlighting specific parts of the translation may indicate confusion.
        *   **Scrollback/Rewind:** Indicates needing to re-read segments.
    *   Automatically adjusts sensitivity scores based on collected data.
*   **Caching & Prioritization:** Similar to existing patent, cache translations. Prioritize caching of segments with high perceptual risk, as these are likely to be re-requested or require higher fidelity.
*   **API Access:** Expose an API allowing third-party applications to integrate perceptual-aware translation. For example, a news app could automatically translate headlines with high perceptual risk at a higher fidelity.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Granularity Engine):**

```
function translateSegment(content, userProfile) {
  prs = calculatePerceptualRiskScore(content);

  if (prs > thresholdHigh && userProfile.sensitivity > thresholdHigh) {
    translation = performHighFidelityTranslation(content);
  } else if (prs > thresholdHigh && userProfile.sensitivity < thresholdLow) {
    translation = performSimplifiedTranslation(content);
  } else if (prs < thresholdLow && userProfile.sensitivity > thresholdHigh){
    translation = performStandardTranslation(content);
  } else {
    translation = performStandardTranslation(content); //Default
  }

  return translation;
}
```
