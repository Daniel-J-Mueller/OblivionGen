## Adaptive Authority Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the delegation concept to allow for *granular* and *time-limited* authority grants, not just blanket permissions. Instead of simply granting a service access to a user’s data, the access manager allows specification of *what* data, *for how long*, and *under what conditions* the service can access.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Classification Layer:** Implement a system for classifying user data into categories (e.g., "Basic Profile", "Purchase History", "Location Data", "Contact List"). This classification happens *within* the access manager system.
*   **Temporal Authority Control:** A time-based access control system. Authority grants expire automatically after a defined period (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week).  Users can also manually revoke access at any time.
*   **Conditional Authority:** Define conditions under which access is granted.  Examples:
    *   "Allow access only when the user is actively using the service."
    *   "Allow access only if the user has explicitly consented to share this data for this specific purpose."
    *   “Allow access only during a defined geographic region”.
*   **Fine-Grained Permission Sets:** Beyond data categories, allow permission sets *within* each category.  For example, within "Purchase History", a service might be granted access to “product names” but *not* “payment details”.
*   **Policy Engine:** A central policy engine within the access manager evaluates all access requests against these granular policies.
*   **API Extensions:**
    *   `requestAccess(user_id, service_id, data_category, permission_set, duration, conditions)`:  A service requests access with specific parameters.
    *   `revokeAccess(user_id, service_id)`:  A service or user revokes all access.
    *   `checkAccess(user_id, service_id, data_category, permission_set)`:  A service checks if it has access *before* attempting to retrieve data. Returns a boolean result.
*   **User Interface (Access Manager):**
    *   A user-facing dashboard to view all services with granted access, the specific permissions granted, and the expiration dates.
    *   Granular controls to modify permissions or revoke access.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  A service requests access using `requestAccess()`.
    2.  The access manager's policy engine evaluates the request against the user's preferences and the service’s registration details.
    3.  If approved, a temporary credential (similar to the existing system) is issued, but it includes the fine-grained permission information.
    4.  The service presents this credential when requesting data.
    5.  The access manager validates the credential and enforces the permissions.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine – simplified):**

```
function evaluateAccess(user_id, service_id, data_category, permission_set):
  user_policy = getUserPolicy(user_id)
  service_policy = getServicePolicy(service_id)

  if not user_policy.allowsService(service_id):
    return false

  if not service_policy.allowsDataCategory(data_category):
    return false

  if not user_policy.allowsPermissionSet(data_category, permission_set):
    return false

  # Check temporal constraints (expiration date)
  if hasExpired(user_policy.expirationDate):
    return false

  # Check conditional constraints (e.g., user actively using service)
  if not meetsConditions(user_id, service_id, user_policy.conditions):
    return false

  return true
```
