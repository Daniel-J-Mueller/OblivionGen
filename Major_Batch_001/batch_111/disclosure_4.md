**Holographic Page Markers & Dynamic Chapter Generation**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Miniature holographic projector embedded within the book's spine. Resolution: 500x500 pixels, visible spectrum.
*   **Tracking:** Capacitive touch sensors integrated into each page, detecting finger position. Combined with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) within the spine for orientation.
*   **Data Storage:** 64GB solid-state drive (SSD) within the spine, pre-loaded with chapter data and a procedural content generation (PCG) algorithm.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.0 for firmware updates and external data input.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery (3000mAh) with wireless charging capability.
*   **Materials:** Book spine constructed from lightweight aluminum alloy. Pages utilize e-paper technology for low power consumption and high contrast.

**Innovation Description:**

This system extends the page-turning detection to dynamically augment the reading experience. The core innovation is *procedural chapter generation* triggered by reading progress. 

The system tracks reading speed and patterns (pauses, re-reads). Based on this, the PCG algorithm generates supplementary content—illustrations, historical context, character background, or even short "what-if" scenarios—displayed as holographic projections *above* the current page.

**Pseudocode for PCG Algorithm:**

```
function generate_supplemental_content(current_page, reading_speed, reading_pattern):
  // Load relevant data for the current page
  page_data = load_page_data(current_page)

  // Determine content type based on reading pattern
  if reading_speed < threshold_slow AND reading_pattern == "pause":
    content_type = "historical_context"
  elif reading_speed > threshold_fast:
    content_type = "character_background"
  else:
    content_type = "illustration"

  // Generate content based on content type
  if content_type == "historical_context":
    content = generate_historical_context(page_data)
  elif content_type == "character_background":
    content = generate_character_background(page_data)
  else:
    content = generate_illustration(page_data)

  // Format content for holographic projection
  projected_content = format_for_hologram(content)

  return projected_content
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  User reads the book as normal.
2.  Capacitive sensors and IMU track page turns, finger position, and reading speed.
3.  Data is fed into the PCG algorithm.
4.  Algorithm generates supplementary content.
5.  Holographic projector displays content above the current page.
6.  User can interact with the hologram via finger gestures (e.g., dismiss, zoom).

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with external databases for real-time information updates.
*   Multi-user mode for shared reading experiences.
*   Holographic annotations and note-taking.
*   AI-driven content generation based on user preferences.
