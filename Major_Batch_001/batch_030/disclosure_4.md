## Adaptive Avatar Projection & Haptic Feedback System

**System Overview:** A multi-device system leveraging projected augmented reality, haptic feedback, and dynamic avatar instantiation to create immersive, context-aware user assistance experiences extending beyond traditional screens.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of strictly transferring an avatar *between* devices, this system projects aspects of the avatar *onto* real-world surfaces and objects, supplementing or replacing screen-based displays.  Haptic feedback is then localized to those surfaces to create a feeling of physical interaction with the avatar/assistance.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** High-performance processor for handling image processing, audio analysis, and haptic control.
*   **Depth Sensor:**  LiDAR or structured light sensor for accurate environmental mapping.
*   **High-Resolution Projectors (x2+):** Short-throw projectors with keystone correction for projecting onto varied surfaces.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** An array of localized ultrasonic transducers or micro-vibrators embedded within surfaces (tabletops, walls, furniture) or integrated into wearable accessories (gloves, bracelets).
*   **Microphone Array:** For accurate voice command capture and noise cancellation.
*   **Network Connectivity:** WiFi 6E/7 for low-latency communication between devices.
*   **Wearable Computing Device (optional):**  AR glasses or a wrist-mounted device to provide supplemental information and control.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Environmental Mapping Module:**  Processes depth sensor data to create a 3D model of the environment in real-time.
2.  **Avatar Projection Engine:**
    *   **Dynamic Mesh Generation:**  Generates a deformable mesh of the avatar based on user interaction and context.
    *   **Projection Mapping Algorithm:**  Maps avatar features (face, hands, body) onto appropriate surfaces in the environment, leveraging the 3D model.  Prioritizes surfaces near the user.
    *   **Occlusion Handling:** Detects and handles occlusions (objects blocking the projection) by dynamically adjusting the projection.
3.  **Haptic Feedback Engine:**
    *   **Localized Haptic Control:** Controls haptic actuators to create sensations corresponding to avatar actions (e.g., a "handshake" on a tabletop, a "tap" on a wall).
    *   **Haptic Texture Synthesis:** Creates the sensation of different textures on projected surfaces.
    *   **Force Feedback Simulation:** Simulates the feeling of resistance or weight when interacting with projected objects.
4.  **Voice & Gesture Recognition Module:**  Processes audio and gesture input to determine user intent.
5.  **Contextual Awareness Engine:** Integrates data from all sensors to understand the user's context (location, activity, environment).

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
mapEnvironment()
loadAvatarProfile()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    processUserInput() // Voice, Gesture
    determineContext()
    generateAvatarAnimation()
    projectAvatar()
    applyHapticFeedback()
}

// Functions

function mapEnvironment() {
    // Use depth sensor to create 3D map of environment
    // Identify potential projection surfaces
}

function loadAvatarProfile() {
    // Load avatar visual and audio characteristics
    // Include animation presets and interaction behaviors
}

function processUserInput() {
    // Analyze voice and gesture commands
    // Translate commands into actions
}

function determineContext() {
    // Integrate sensor data to understand user's situation
    // Example: "User is looking at a recipe on the table"
}

function generateAvatarAnimation() {
    // Create animation sequence based on user input and context
    // Example: Avatar points to ingredients in the recipe
}

function projectAvatar() {
    // Map avatar features onto available surfaces
    // Adjust projection based on surface geometry and lighting
}

function applyHapticFeedback() {
    // Activate haptic actuators to create relevant sensations
    // Example: "Tap" on the table where the avatar's hand is projected
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Interactive Tutorials:**  Projected avatar demonstrates tasks directly on the user's workspace, with haptic guidance.
*   **Remote Collaboration:**  Remote participants are represented by projected avatars, creating a more immersive and collaborative experience.
*   **Immersive Gaming:** Projected avatars and haptic feedback enhance the realism and immersion of video games.
*   **Accessibility:**  Assistive technology for visually impaired users, providing tactile representations of digital information.
*   **Retail & Product Demonstration:**  Projected product demonstrations with interactive haptic feedback.
