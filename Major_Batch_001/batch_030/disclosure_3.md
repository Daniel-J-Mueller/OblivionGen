## Dynamic Workspace Partitioning with Projected Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Extend the safety system beyond simple robotic inhibition by *actively* re-defining the workspace itself, leveraging projected augmented reality (AR) to create dynamic, visually-defined safety zones. This isn't just about stopping robots; it's about guiding *people* to safer locations within the workspace.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **AR Projectors:** Multiple high-lumen, short-throw AR projectors strategically mounted throughout the workspace. These projectors must be capable of projecting visible light patterns onto floors, walls, and potentially even translucent barriers. Resolution: minimum 1920x1080. Refresh Rate: 60Hz minimum.
*   **Enhanced Reference Radios:** Reference radios (as in the patent) with added inertial measurement units (IMUs) and potentially small, wide-angle cameras. IMUs improve positional accuracy. Cameras allow for basic visual confirmation of worker locations (and potential obstruction detection).
*   **Portable Radio (Worker Tag):** Similar to the existing portable radio, but with an integrated haptic feedback module (vibration motor).
*   **Central Controller:** Existing central controller architecture with added AR rendering and projection control capabilities.
*   **Overhead Mapping System:** A LiDAR or similar system to generate a 3D map of the workspace for AR projection calibration. This is a one-time setup.

**2. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Dynamic Zone Generation:** The controller receives worker location data from the reference radios.  It calculates bounding areas as in the original patent. *However,* instead of just inhibiting robots, it projects visually distinct zones onto the workspace floor and walls.
    *   **Safe Zone:** A brightly illuminated area surrounding the worker, indicating a 'safe' perimeter.
    *   **Warning Zone:** A gradually changing color (e.g., yellow to red) zone extending beyond the safe zone, indicating proximity to robotic activity.
    *   **No-Go Zone:**  A clearly demarcated area (e.g., solid red) around active robotic pathways. This zone *actively shifts* based on robot movement.
*   **Projection Calibration:**  The software uses the overhead map to accurately warp and blend projections onto surfaces, accounting for angles and obstructions.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** If a worker *enters* a warning or no-go zone, the portable radio emits a distinct vibration pattern.
*   **Robot Path Prediction:** The controller analyzes robot movement patterns and *predicts* future paths. This allows for pre-emptive projection of no-go zones, rather than just reactive ones.
*   **AI-Driven Zone Adjustment:** Integrate a simple AI model. If a worker consistently ignores warnings and enters restricted zones, the AI can *slightly expand* the restricted zones to encourage safer behavior. (This feature requires careful ethical consideration and user opt-in.)
*   **Emergency Override:** A manual override to instantly illuminate the entire workspace in a bright, attention-grabbing color for emergency situations.

**3. Pseudocode â€“ Dynamic Zone Projection:**

```
//  Loop for continuous update

// 1. Get Worker Location from Reference Radios
workerLocation = getWorkerLocation()

// 2. Calculate Bounding Areas
safeZone = calculateSafeZone(workerLocation, safeZoneRadius)
warningZone = calculateWarningZone(workerLocation, warningZoneRadius)
noGoZone = calculateNoGoZone(robotPositions, robotPathPredictions)

// 3. Generate Projection Data
safeZoneProjectionData = generateProjectionData(safeZone, color = "Bright Green")
warningZoneProjectionData = generateProjectionData(warningZone, color = "Yellow to Red Gradient")
noGoZoneProjectionData = generateProjectionData(noGoZone, color = "Solid Red")

// 4. Send Projection Commands to AR Projectors
sendProjectionCommands(safeZoneProjectionData)
sendProjectionCommands(warningZoneProjectionData)
sendProjectionCommands(noGoZoneProjectionData)

// 5. Check for Zone Violations and Activate Haptic Feedback
if (workerLocation within warningZone or noGoZone) {
    activateHapticFeedback()
}

// 6. Update Robot Positions and Path Predictions
updateRobotData()
```

**4. Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple robotic inhibition. It provides *active* guidance and visual cues to workers, improving situational awareness and proactively preventing collisions. The dynamic projection of zones creates a truly interactive and responsive workspace.  The AI-driven zone adjustment adds a layer of adaptability and user behavior encouragement.
