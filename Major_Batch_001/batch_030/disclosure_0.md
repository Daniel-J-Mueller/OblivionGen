## Adaptive Propeller Geometry via Micro-Actuators

**Concept:** Instead of *switching* between different sized propellers, dynamically alter the *shape* of existing propellers during flight using integrated micro-actuators. This allows for continuous sound profile manipulation, beyond the discrete steps of propeller swapping, and opens possibilities for active noise cancellation or signature sound generation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Propeller Construction:** Propellers are constructed from a flexible polymer matrix reinforced with carbon nanotubes for strength and responsiveness. Internal channels are embedded within the propeller blade structure.
*   **Micro-Actuator System:** Each propeller contains an array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or shape memory alloy) distributed along the blade length. These actuators are housed within the internal channels.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated onboard microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M7 or equivalent) manages the micro-actuator array. It receives commands from the primary flight controller and translates them into individual actuator signals.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Microphone Array:** Four or more miniature microphones are integrated into the UAV frame to capture ambient and propeller-generated sound.
    *   **Blade Strain Gauges:** Strain gauges embedded within the propeller blades measure blade deflection and stress, providing feedback for actuator control and damage detection.
    *   **IMU:**  Inertial Measurement Unit (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) to measure orientation and vibration.
*   **Actuation Modes:**
    *   **Variable Camber:** Actuators adjust the curvature of the propeller blade, altering lift, thrust, and sound signature.
    *   **Trailing Edge Flaps:** Miniature trailing edge flaps, controlled by actuators, modulate airflow and reduce tip vortex noise.
    *   **Blade Twist:** Actuators induce localized blade twist, creating aerodynamic imbalances for sound cancellation or specific tonal effects.
*   **Software Implementation:**
    *   **Sound Profile Library:** Predefined sound profiles are stored onboard, each corresponding to a specific flight condition or acoustic goal.
    *   **Real-Time Acoustic Feedback:** The microphone array continuously monitors sound levels and frequencies.
    *   **Adaptive Control Algorithm:**  A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) or Model Predictive Control algorithm adjusts actuator signals to maintain the desired sound profile. The algorithm dynamically balances sound reduction, thrust, and energy consumption.
    *   **Machine Learning Integration:**  A machine learning model (trained offline with diverse sound data) can predict optimal actuator settings for different environments and flight conditions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Control Loop
while (flight_active) {
    // Read sensor data
    sound_data = microphone_array.capture();
    blade_strain = blade_strain_gauges.read();
    imu_data = imu.read();

    // Determine desired sound profile based on flight condition
    desired_profile = sound_profile_library.get_profile(flight_condition, user_preference);

    // Calculate actuator commands
    actuator_commands = adaptive_control_algorithm.calculate_commands(
        sound_data, blade_strain, imu_data, desired_profile
    );

    // Send commands to micro-actuators
    micro_actuator_array.set_commands(actuator_commands);

    // Delay for control loop frequency
    delay(control_loop_frequency);
}
```

**Power Requirements:** Dedicated high-efficiency power supply to the micro-actuator array. Energy harvesting from propeller vibration could supplement power needs.

**Materials:** Flexible polymers (e.g., TPU, TPE), carbon nanotubes, piezoelectric materials, shape memory alloys, miniature electronics.
