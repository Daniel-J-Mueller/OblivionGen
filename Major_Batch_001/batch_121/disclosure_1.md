**Adaptive Content Re-Composition for Personalized Live Streams**

**Concept:** Dynamically re-compose live streams *on the fly* based on individual viewer preferences and available bandwidth, going beyond simply skipping expendable portions. This creates personalized “cuts” of the live event, optimizing for engagement and minimizing buffering – but not by simply speeding up or slowing down playback.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Segmentation:** The live feed is ingested and segmented into granular “action units” (AUs). An AU isn't necessarily a fixed duration; it's a semantically meaningful unit of action (e.g., a single play in a sports game, a musical phrase, a speaker's point in a presentation).  This segmentation happens in near real-time via AI analysis of video and audio, or via explicit tagging by a content operator.
*   **Viewer Preference Profiles:** Each viewer has a profile storing preferences. These can be explicit (e.g., “focus on player X,” “skip commercial breaks,” “show replays”) or implicit (learned from viewing history, engagement metrics).
*   **Bandwidth Prediction:**  Continuously predict each viewer’s available bandwidth using network metrics.
*   **Dynamic AU Selection & Stitching:**  A central server dynamically selects and stitches together AUs based on the viewer’s profile and predicted bandwidth. This is *not* simple concatenation. It requires smooth transitions between AUs, which may involve short crossfades, or the generation of synthetic "bridge" content.
*   **AI-Driven Transition Generation:** If smooth transitions are not possible due to content discontinuities, an AI model generates short synthetic transitions (e.g., a blurred frame, a zoom, a simple animation) to bridge the gap.
*   **Real-Time Rendering:**  The selected and stitched AUs are rendered into a personalized stream for each viewer.
*   **Metadata Augmentation:**  Each AU is associated with rich metadata, including:
    *   Semantic content (e.g., "goal scored," "speaker introduced," "commercial break")
    *   Visual complexity (for bandwidth adaptation)
    *   Emotional valence (for engagement prediction)
    *   Key player/object tracking data

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function process_live_feed(live_feed):
  au_list = segment_feed(live_feed) # Break into Action Units

  while stream_active:
    for viewer in active_viewers:
      viewer_profile = get_viewer_profile(viewer)
      predicted_bandwidth = predict_bandwidth(viewer)

      selected_aus = filter_aus(au_list, viewer_profile, predicted_bandwidth) # Select based on preferences & bandwidth
      stitched_stream = stitch_aus(selected_aus) #  Stitch together with smooth transitions or AI generated content
      send_stream_to_viewer(viewer, stitched_stream)
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simply skipping content.  It *recomposes* the live stream into a personalized experience, dynamically adapting to both viewer preferences and network conditions.  The AI-driven transition generation is key to maintaining a seamless viewing experience despite the dynamic recomposition. Think of a director's cut tailored *in real-time* to each individual viewer.
