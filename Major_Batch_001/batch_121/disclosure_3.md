# 10091329

## Adaptive Payload Decomposition for Heterogeneous Device Networks

**Specification:** A system for dynamically breaking down and reassembling payloads based on device capabilities and network conditions, extending the functionality described in patent 10091329. This goes beyond simple message translation (HTTP/MQTT/CoAP) to granular data decomposition.

**Core Concept:** The gateway server, as described in the patent, will analyze device profiles and real-time network telemetry to determine the *optimal* way to split a payload before transmission. This isn't just about protocol adaptation; it’s about intelligently dividing data based on a device’s processing power, memory constraints, and bandwidth availability. The receiving device, or another intermediary gateway, then reassembles the data.

**Components:**

1.  **Payload Decomposition Engine (PDE):**  Resides on the gateway server.  This module is responsible for the following:
    *   **Device Profile Database:** Stores detailed profiles for each registered device, including processing capabilities (CPU speed, RAM), supported data formats, network bandwidth, and available storage.
    *   **Network Telemetry Collector:** Monitors real-time network conditions (latency, packet loss, bandwidth) for each device connection.
    *   **Decomposition Algorithm:**  A configurable algorithm that determines how to split a payload.  Key considerations:
        *   **Data Dependency Graph:**  Analyzes the payload to identify data dependencies.  Critical data that must arrive together is kept in the same fragment.
        *   **Fragment Size Optimization:**  Determines the optimal fragment size based on device capabilities and network conditions.  Smaller fragments for low-bandwidth or resource-constrained devices.
        *   **Redundancy Encoding:** Optionally encodes fragments with redundancy (e.g., Reed-Solomon codes) to improve resilience to packet loss.
2.  **Fragment Assembly Engine (FAE):** Resides on either the target device or an intermediary gateway. Responsible for:
    *   **Fragment Reception and Buffering:** Receives and buffers fragments.
    *   **Dependency Resolution:** Resolves dependencies between fragments.
    *   **Reassembly and Validation:** Reassembles the payload and validates its integrity.

**Pseudocode (Gateway Server - PDE):**

```pseudocode
function decomposePayload(payload, deviceProfile, networkTelemetry):
  dataDependencyGraph = analyzePayload(payload)
  optimalFragmentSize = calculateOptimalFragmentSize(deviceProfile, networkTelemetry)
  fragments = splitPayload(payload, dataDependencyGraph, optimalFragmentSize)
  
  //Optional redundancy encoding
  if networkTelemetry.packetLossRate > threshold:
    encodedFragments = encodeFragments(fragments, redundancyScheme)
    return encodedFragments
  else:
    return fragments

function calculateOptimalFragmentSize(deviceProfile, networkTelemetry):
  //Consider device RAM, CPU, network bandwidth, and latency
  fragmentSize = min(deviceProfile.maxRAM, deviceProfile.maxPayloadSize)
  fragmentSize = min(fragmentSize, networkTelemetry.availableBandwidth * latency)
  return fragmentSize

function encodeFragments(fragments, redundancyScheme):
  //Implement Reed-Solomon or other error correction code
  encodedFragments = []
  for fragment in fragments:
    encodedFragment = applyRedundancy(fragment, redundancyScheme)
    encodedFragments.append(encodedFragment)
  return encodedFragments
```

**Pseudocode (Device/Gateway - FAE):**

```pseudocode
function assemblePayload(fragments):
  //Receive fragments and store in buffer
  
  //Resolve dependencies between fragments (based on metadata)
  
  //Reassemble payload
  assembledPayload = concatenateFragments(fragments)
  
  //Validate payload integrity (checksum, etc.)
  if isValidPayload(assembledPayload):
    return assembledPayload
  else:
    //Request retransmission of lost or corrupted fragments
    return error
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **IoT Sensor Networks:** Efficiently deliver sensor data from resource-constrained devices.
*   **Smart Cities:**  Manage data from a diverse range of devices with varying capabilities.
*   **Industrial Automation:**  Real-time control of machinery with reliable data delivery.
*   **Automotive:**  Over-the-air software updates and diagnostics.
