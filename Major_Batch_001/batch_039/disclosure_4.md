## Dynamic Environmental Mapping & Predictive Grouping

**Concept:** Leverage spatial audio and environmental sensors to *automatically* detect and group devices based on usage patterns and proximity, *before* a voice command is even issued. This moves beyond static group creation to a truly adaptive and intuitive smart home experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of wide-aperture microphones (minimum 6) distributed throughout the environment.  These are *not* solely for voice command capture but for spatial audio analysis.
    *   Low-resolution thermal cameras (1 per major room) for basic occupancy detection and heat signature analysis.
    *   Integration with existing smart device infrastructure (must support APIs for status requests and control).
    *   Dedicated edge processing unit (powerful enough to handle real-time audio and thermal processing – e.g., NVIDIA Jetson equivalent).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Spatial Audio Engine:** Processes microphone array data to create a 3D sound map of the environment. Identifies sound sources (e.g., TV, music player, human speech) and their locations.
    *   **Thermal Signature Analysis:** Detects heat signatures to determine occupancy and general activity levels in each room.
    *   **Usage Pattern Learning:** An AI model (LSTM or Transformer-based) learns typical device usage patterns.  This includes *when* devices are used, *where* they are used, and *in conjunction with other devices*. The model should be able to handle seasonality and variation in routine.
    *   **Predictive Grouping Engine:** Combines spatial audio, thermal data, and learned usage patterns to *predict* likely device groupings *before* a user issues a voice command.  For example:
        *   If a user typically turns on the TV, lights, and sound system together in the evening, the system will pre-stage these devices for control.
        *   If the system detects a user sitting on the couch and the TV is off, it will suggest turning on the TV and adjusting the lighting.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:**  Integrates with calendar events and other data sources to anticipate needs.  For example, if a movie night is scheduled, the system will pre-configure the entertainment system.
    *   **Dynamic Group Naming:** Groups are named based on activity (“Movie Night”, “Reading Time”, "Dinner Prep”).
*   **Workflow (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Capture Audio & Thermal Data
  audioData = captureAudio();
  thermalData = captureThermal();

  // 2. Analyze Data
  soundSources = analyzeAudio(audioData);  // Identify sound sources & locations
  occupancy = analyzeThermal(thermalData); // Detect occupancy & activity

  // 3. Predict Device Grouping
  predictedGroup = predictGrouping(soundSources, occupancy, historicalData);

  // 4.  Pre-Stage Devices (Optional)
  if (predictedGroup != null) {
      preStageDevices(predictedGroup); // Bring devices to a ready state
  }

  // 5. Await Voice Command (Existing System)
  voiceCommand = awaitVoiceCommand();

  // 6. Process Voice Command (Handle Predicted Group as Context)
  if (voiceCommand contains group name) {
      // Execute command on pre-staged group
  } else {
      // Process command as usual
  }

}
```

*   **API Integration:**
    *   All device control is abstracted through a unified API.
    *   API supports status requests (e.g., “Is the TV on?”) and control commands (e.g., “Turn on the TV”).
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All audio and thermal data processing is performed locally on the edge device.
    *   No data is transmitted to the cloud without explicit user consent.
    *   Users have full control over data retention policies.
