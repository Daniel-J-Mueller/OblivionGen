## Dynamic Policy Orchestration with Predictive Load Balancing

**System Overview:**

This system extends the concept of dynamic traffic remapping to include predictive load balancing driven by machine learning models. It anticipates network congestion and proactively shifts traffic *before* performance degradation occurs.  Crucially, it introduces a layered policy system allowing for fine-grained control, exceeding static or simple rule-based approaches.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Global Traffic Observer (GTO):** Continuously monitors network performance metrics (latency, packet loss, bandwidth utilization) across all network locations. This isn't simply reactive monitoring; it’s time-series data collection primed for prediction.
2.  **Predictive Load Balancer (PLB):** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, LSTM) trained on historical GTO data.  The PLB predicts future load at each network location, with confidence intervals. This is the 'brain' of the system.
3.  **Policy Engine:**  A hierarchical policy system.  Policies are defined in layers:
    *   **Global Policies:**  High-level objectives (e.g., "Minimize latency for all users," "Prioritize traffic for premium customers"). These define overall system behavior.
    *   **Service Policies:**  Specific to individual services or applications. (e.g., "Route database queries to the nearest replica," “Prioritize video streaming traffic”).
    *   **Granular Policies:**  Fine-grained rules triggered by specific conditions (e.g., "If network location X is above 80% utilization, divert traffic to location Y"). These are dynamically created by the PLB’s recommendations.
4.  **Dynamic Remapping Agent (DRA):**  The component responsible for implementing the decisions made by the Policy Engine.  This leverages the existing remapping mechanisms of the core system, but now receives guidance based on predictive data.

**Data Flow & Operation:**

1.  The GTO collects real-time network performance data.
2.  The PLB analyzes the data and predicts future load at each location.
3.  The Policy Engine evaluates the predictions against defined Global and Service Policies.
4.  Based on this evaluation, the Policy Engine dynamically creates or adjusts Granular Policies. These policies dictate which network locations should receive traffic.
5.  The DRA implements these policies by remapping traffic to the appropriate destinations.
6.  The system continuously loops, adapting to changing conditions.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function evaluate_policies(predicted_load, global_policies, service_policies):
  granular_policies = []

  for location in all_locations:
    predicted_utilization = predicted_load[location]

    if predicted_utilization > threshold_high:
      # High Utilization - divert traffic
      alternative_location = find_least_loaded_location(all_locations, location)
      granular_policies.append(rule("divert", location, alternative_location))

    elif predicted_utilization < threshold_low:
      # Low Utilization - attract traffic
      granular_policies.append(rule("attract", location))

  #Apply Service Policies - potentially override granular policies
  refined_granular_policies = apply_service_policies(granular_policies, service_policies)

  return refined_granular_policies

function apply_service_policies(granular_policies, service_policies):
  #Iterate through service policies and potentially override granular policies
  #Example: Service policy "Prioritize database queries" might override a "divert" rule
  #for database traffic
  refined_policies = []
  for policy in service_policies:
    if policy.type == "priority":
      #Apply priority rule to relevant traffic
      refined_policies.append(policy)
    else:
      refined_policies.append(policy)
  return refined_policies
```

**Specifications:**

*   **ML Model:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers, trained on at least 6 months of historical network data.
*   **Data Resolution:** Network performance data collected every 5 seconds.
*   **Policy Engine:**  Rule-based engine with support for complex conditional logic.
*   **API:**  REST API for managing policies and monitoring system performance.
*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle a minimum of 1 million requests per second.
*   **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing DNS and BGP infrastructure.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond reactive load balancing to *predictive* load balancing. The layered policy system allows for extremely fine-grained control, adapting to complex network conditions and service requirements. The use of machine learning to anticipate load fluctuations and proactively shift traffic is a significant advancement. The granular policies allow for prioritization and complex traffic routing.
