## Dynamic Reading Style Adaptation

**Concept:** Leverage the SRL determination system to *dynamically* adjust the reading experience beyond just the starting point. Instead of a static SRL, the system will analyze the ebook content and infer the reader's preferred reading style (e.g., skimming, detailed, character-focused) and adapt the display accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Style Profile Generation:**

*   **Data Points:** The system will monitor reading behavior *after* the initial SRL is established. Specifically:
    *   **Scroll Speed:** Average scroll speed per page/section.
    *   **Highlight Frequency:**  Number of highlights per page/section.
    *   **Note Frequency:** Number of notes created per page/section.
    *   **Dictionary Lookups:** Frequency of dictionary lookups.
    *   **Font Size/Style Changes:** Any manual adjustments to font size/style.
    *   **Time Spent on Page:** Duration reader spends on each page/section.
*   **Style Clusters:** A machine learning model (trained on a large corpus of reading data) will categorize reading styles into clusters (e.g., “Skimmer”, “Detail-Oriented”, “Character-Focused”, "Narrative-Driven"). The model will assign a probability score to each cluster based on the collected data points.
*   **Initial Profile:** The system initially assumes a default reading style ("Neutral") and starts collecting data.

**2. Content Analysis & Adaptation:**

*   **Section-Level Analysis:** The ebook is divided into sections (chapters, sub-sections). Each section is analyzed for:
    *   **Density of Proper Nouns:** Number of named entities (people, places, organizations). High density suggests a plot-heavy or informative section.
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** Average sentence length and use of complex grammatical structures.
    *   **Descriptive Language:** Ratio of adjectives/adverbs to total words.
    *   **Dialogue Ratio:** Percentage of text that is dialogue.
*   **Dynamic Display Adjustments:** Based on the reader's style profile and the section analysis, the system makes the following adjustments:
    *   **Skimmer Profile:**
        *   Increase font size slightly.
        *   Reduce line spacing.
        *   Emphasize headings and subheadings.
        *   Provide a summarized "key takeaway" for each section.
    *   **Detail-Oriented Profile:**
        *   Maintain standard font size.
        *   Increase line spacing.
        *   Enable automatic footnote/endnote pop-ups.
        *   Provide access to related research/articles.
    *   **Character-Focused Profile:**
        *   Highlight character names when they appear.
        *   Provide a "character guide" with brief descriptions.
        *   Visualize character relationships (e.g., a network graph).
    *    **Narrative-Driven Profile:**
        *   Reduce margins
        *   Increase font size
        *   Increase line spacing
        *   Dim lighting to draw reader in

**3. Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
// Initial Setup
readerStyle = "Neutral"
styleData = []

// Reading Loop
for each page in ebook:
    // Collect Data
    scrollSpeed = getScrollSpeed(page)
    highlightCount = getHighlightCount(page)
    // ... other metrics

    styleData.append( { scrollSpeed: scrollSpeed, highlights: highlightCount, ... } )

    // Update Reader Style (every N pages)
    if (length(styleData) > N):
        readerStyle = determineReaderStyle(styleData)

    // Analyze Page Content
    pageContent = analyzePageContent(page) //returns data about proper nouns, etc.

    // Apply Adaptations
    applyAdaptations(readerStyle, pageContent) // adjusts font size, spacing, etc.
```

**4.  Training Data:**

*   A dataset of ebooks annotated with reading style preferences (collected from user surveys or behavioral data).
*   A large corpus of text used to train the language model for content analysis.
