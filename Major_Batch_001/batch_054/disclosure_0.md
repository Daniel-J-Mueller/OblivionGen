## Adaptive Data Granularity & Predictive Tiering

**Concept:** Expand upon the partitioning idea, but *dynamically* adjust partition size & storage tier based on predicted access patterns *within* each partition, not just full/incremental backup schedules. This creates a tiered, self-optimizing backup system.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Profiler Module:** Continuous analysis of data access within each partition (read frequency, modification rate, data type, user access patterns).
*   **Granularity Engine:** Divides partitions into *sub-partitions* (potentially down to the individual file level).  Initial sub-partition size is configurable.
*   **Tier Assignment Logic:** Based on profiler data:
    *   **Tier 0 (Fastest/Most Expensive):** Frequently accessed, modified, and critical data. Stored on NVMe SSDs or in-memory caching.
    *   **Tier 1 (Fast):** Regularly accessed data. Stored on SSDs.
    *   **Tier 2 (Balanced):** Moderately accessed data. Stored on high-performance HDDs.
    *   **Tier 3 (Archive/Slowest/Cheapest):** Infrequently accessed, long-term archival data.  Stored on tape, object storage, or cold HDDs.
*   **Reverse Delta Enhancement:**  Instead of a single reverse delta, generate *multiple* reverse deltas, one for *each tier*. This allows reconstruction of data at different tiers with minimal I/O.
*   **Predictive Tiering Algorithm:** Uses machine learning (time series analysis, anomaly detection) to *predict* future access patterns and proactively move data between tiers.  Key inputs: time of day, day of week, user behavior, data lifecycle.
*   **Automated Rebalancing:** Periodically re-evaluates tier assignments and automatically rebalances data as access patterns change.
*   **Data Versioning:** Maintain multiple versions of data at different tiers to support point-in-time recovery.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Tiering Algorithm):**

```
function predict_tier(data_access_history, current_time, data_metadata):
  // Fetch historical access data for this data element
  history = get_access_history(data_access_history)

  // Extract features: time of day, day of week, user ID, access frequency, modification rate
  features = extract_features(history, current_time, data_metadata)

  // Load trained ML model
  model = load_model("tier_prediction_model.pkl")

  // Predict tier based on features
  predicted_tier = model.predict(features)

  return predicted_tier
```

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   Multi-tiered storage infrastructure (NVMe, SSD, HDD, Tape/Object Storage).
*   High-performance network connectivity.
*   Machine learning platform for model training and deployment.
*   Robust monitoring and alerting system.
