## Dynamic Content Isolation via Federated Execution

**Concept:** Extend the endpoint segregation concept to allow for *dynamic*, policy-driven content execution across multiple, mutually distrusting "execution domains". Instead of static endpoint assignment, content (particularly active content) is routed to the most appropriate, secure domain *at runtime*, based on content characteristics and user policy. This moves beyond preventing XSS to providing a framework for verifiable, compartmentalized computation within the browser.

**Specifications:**

**1. Architecture:**

*   **Content Descriptor:** Each content block (JS, CSS, HTML fragment) includes a "Content Descriptor" – a digitally signed metadata package outlining origin, dependencies, security requirements (e.g., allowed network access, data access), and a ‘trust level’. This descriptor is *required* for any dynamically loaded content.
*   **Policy Engine:** A browser-integrated policy engine evaluates the Content Descriptor against user-defined policies and available execution domains. Policies specify acceptable trust levels, required security features, and allowed execution environments.
*   **Execution Domains:** These are isolated runtime environments, potentially leveraging web workers, sandboxed iframes, or even remote execution servers (with appropriate authentication and authorization). Each domain declares its capabilities and supported trust levels.
*   **Content Router:** This component intercepts content requests, retrieves the Content Descriptor, invokes the Policy Engine, and routes the content to a suitable Execution Domain.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  Client requests a webpage.
2.  Webpage loads, requesting dynamic content (e.g., a widget).
3.  Content server provides the content *with* its Content Descriptor.
4.  The Content Router intercepts the request.
5.  The Policy Engine evaluates the Content Descriptor against user policies.
6.  The Policy Engine identifies a suitable Execution Domain.
7.  The Content Router forwards the content to the selected Execution Domain.
8.  The Execution Domain executes the content and returns the results (e.g., rendered HTML) to the main page.
9.  Results are integrated into the main page’s DOM.

**3. Pseudocode (Content Router):**

```
function routeContent(content, descriptor) {
  policyResult = policyEngine.evaluate(descriptor);

  if (policyResult.approved == false) {
    // Log denial, return error to client.
    return error("Content blocked by policy");
  }

  domain = findSuitableDomain(policyResult.requiredCapabilities);

  if (domain == null) {
    //Log inability to find appropriate domain, return error to client.
    return error("No suitable domain available");
  }

  result = domain.execute(content);
  return result;
}

function findSuitableDomain(requiredCapabilities) {
  //Iterate through available domains, check capabilities.
  //Return the first domain that meets the requirements.
  //If none are found, return null.
}
```

**4. Domain Capabilities:**

*   **Network Access:** Allowed domains, protocols, ports.
*   **Data Access:** Access to browser storage, cookies, local data.
*   **Rendering Restrictions:** Restrictions on DOM manipulation, JavaScript execution.
*   **Trust Level:** A numeric score reflecting the domain’s security posture.
*   **Hardware/Software Verification:** Cryptographic attestation of the domain's runtime environment.

**5. Novelty & Potential:**

*   **Dynamic Security:** Adapts to changing content characteristics and user preferences.
*   **Federated Trust:** Allows users to choose domains based on their reputation and security features.
*   **Reduced Attack Surface:** Isolates potentially malicious code within secure domains.
*   **Verifiable Computation:** Enables trust in remote code execution through cryptographic verification.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Users can define granular policies to control content behavior.

This framework moves beyond simply segregating content *endpoints* to creating a dynamic, policy-driven system for secure content execution, offering a robust solution to evolving web security threats.
