## Dynamic Menu Personalization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend restaurant recommendation and reservation systems by incorporating real-time biofeedback from the user to dynamically personalize not just *where* they eat, but *what* they order. This moves beyond predictive patterns of restaurant choice to influence in-the-moment menu selection.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Integration:**

*   **Wearable Sensor:** Compatible with common smartwatches/fitness trackers (API access required). Primary sensors: Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Conductance (Electrodermal Activity – EDA), potentially facial muscle activity (via camera access – user opt-in).
*   **Restaurant POS Integration:**  API access to restaurant Point of Sale (POS) systems to retrieve real-time menu data, ingredient lists, and nutritional information.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Biofeedback Analysis Module:**  Processes raw sensor data to derive 'state' metrics.
    *   **Stress Level:** HRV & EDA combined. High EDA/low HRV = Elevated stress.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** HRV (rapid fluctuations) indicative of intense focus or decision-making.
    *   **Mood/Emotional State:**  Machine learning model trained on biofeedback data correlated with self-reported mood (initial calibration phase).
*   **Menu Mapping Database:** Comprehensive database linking menu items to:
    *   **Ingredient Profiles:** Detailed list of ingredients.
    *   **Nutritional Information:** Calories, macronutrients, micronutrients.
    *   **Sensory Attributes:** Flavor profiles (sweet, sour, umami, etc.), texture (creamy, crunchy, etc.), temperature.
    *   **'Bio-Impact' Scores:**  Estimated impact on stress, cognitive load, and mood (derived from research & user data).  Example: Spicy food = increased heart rate, potentially elevated stress.  Comfort food = potentially lowered stress, increased relaxation.
*   **Recommendation Engine:**  Algorithm that dynamically adjusts menu recommendations based on real-time biofeedback and user preferences.  Rules-based and machine learning components.
    *   **Stress Reduction Mode:** If high stress detected, recommend calming foods (e.g., chamomile tea, warm milk, foods rich in magnesium).
    *   **Cognitive Boost Mode:** If high cognitive load, recommend foods that support brain function (e.g., blueberries, nuts, salmon).
    *   **Mood Enhancement Mode:**  Recommend foods associated with positive emotions based on user’s historical data.
*   **User Interface (Mobile App):**
    *   **Real-time Biofeedback Display:** Visualization of user’s stress level, cognitive load, and mood.
    *   **Dynamic Menu:** Menu items are ranked/highlighted based on the recommendation engine’s output.
    *   **“Why This Recommendation?” Feature:** Explains the rationale behind each suggestion (e.g., “This salad is rich in antioxidants, which can help reduce stress”).
    *   **Feedback Mechanism:** Users can rate recommendations and provide feedback to improve the algorithm.

**3. Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION get_recommendations(user_id, menu_data, biofeedback_data):

  stress_level = biofeedback_data.stress_level
  cognitive_load = biofeedback_data.cognitive_load
  mood = biofeedback_data.mood

  // Apply weighting factors based on user preferences (e.g., prioritize stress reduction over cognitive boost)
  stress_weight = user_preferences.stress_weight
  cognitive_weight = user_preferences.cognitive_weight
  mood_weight = user_preferences.mood_weight

  FOR each item IN menu_data:
    item.stress_score = calculate_stress_score(item) // based on ingredients & 'bio-impact'
    item.cognitive_score = calculate_cognitive_score(item)
    item.mood_score = calculate_mood_score(item)

    item.total_score = (item.stress_score * stress_weight) + (item.cognitive_score * cognitive_weight) + (item.mood_score * mood_weight)

  // Sort menu items by total score (descending)
  sorted_menu = sort_by_score(menu_data)

  RETURN sorted_menu
```

**4.  Novelty & Potential:**

*   Moves beyond *predictive* personalization to *reactive* personalization.
*   Addresses the immediate physiological needs of the user.
*   Creates a deeply personalized dining experience.
*   Potential for integration with health/wellness tracking apps.
*   Data collection opportunities to better understand the relationship between food and well-being.
