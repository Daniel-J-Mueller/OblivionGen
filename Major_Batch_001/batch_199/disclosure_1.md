## Adaptive Timer Granularity based on Task Priority

**Specification:**

**I. System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of injecting noise into timer values, but instead of a uniform approach, dynamically adjusts the granularity of the timer itself based on the priority of the executing task.  The core idea is to provide *higher resolution* timing for critical tasks and *lower resolution* timing for less important ones, optimizing both performance and potentially reducing contention for shared resources.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   **Hardware Timer:** Standard high-resolution hardware timer (PLL-based, as in the provided patent).
*   **Priority Assignment Module:** A mechanism (OS-level or hardware-assisted) to assign a priority level to each executing task. This could be a simple integer value (0-7, for example) or a more complex priority scheme.
*   **Granularity Control Unit (GCU):** A dedicated hardware unit that sits between the hardware timer and the virtual timer module. This unit receives the hardware timer's output and, based on the current task's priority, applies a scaling factor to the timer value *before* any noise injection.
*   **Noise Injection Module:**  As in the reference patent, this module injects pseudorandom noise into the scaled timer value.
*   **Virtual Timer Module:**  Provides the final virtual timer value to the requesting task.

**III. Software Components:**

*   **Priority Assignment API:** Allows the operating system or application to set the priority of each task.
*   **GCU Configuration Interface:** Provides a mechanism for the OS to configure the scaling factors used by the GCU for different priority levels.

**IV. Operational Details:**

1.  **Priority Assignment:** When a task is created or its priority changes, the Priority Assignment Module sets the task's priority level.

2.  **Timer Request:** When a task requests a timer value, the Virtual Timer Module initiates the process.

3.  **Granularity Scaling:** The GCU receives the hardware timer’s output. It consults the task’s priority level and applies a corresponding scaling factor.  Higher priority tasks receive a smaller scaling factor (higher resolution), while lower priority tasks receive a larger scaling factor (lower resolution).

    *Example:*

    | Priority | Scaling Factor | Effective Timer Resolution |
    |---|---|---|
    | 0 (Lowest) | 8 | Coarse |
    | 1 | 4 |  |
    | 2 | 2 |  |
    | 3 | 1 | Fine |
    | 4-7 | 0.5 |  |

4.  **Noise Injection:** The Noise Injection Module adds pseudorandom noise to the scaled timer value.

5.  **Virtual Timer Value Delivery:** The Virtual Timer Module provides the final virtual timer value to the requesting task.

**V. Pseudocode (GCU):**

```
function scaleTimerValue(hardwareTimerValue, taskPriority):
  scalingFactor = getScalingFactor(taskPriority)
  scaledValue = hardwareTimerValue / scalingFactor
  return scaledValue

function getScalingFactor(taskPriority):
  // Lookup table or calculation based on priority
  if taskPriority == 0:
    return 8
  else if taskPriority == 1:
    return 4
  else if taskPriority == 2:
    return 2
  else:
    return 1
```

**VI. Benefits:**

*   **Improved Performance:** Critical tasks receive higher resolution timing, improving their responsiveness and accuracy.
*   **Reduced Contention:** Lower priority tasks use coarser timing, reducing contention for shared resources like the hardware timer.
*   **Adaptive Resource Allocation:** Dynamically adjusts timer resolution based on task needs.
*   **Flexibility:** The scaling factors can be configured to optimize performance for different workloads.
