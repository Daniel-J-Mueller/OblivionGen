## Dynamic Offer Bundling & Contextual Localization

**Concept:** Extend localized offer presentation by dynamically bundling complementary items *based on the user's detected context* (location, time of day, weather, known preferences). This moves beyond simple translation to personalized offer *creation* during localization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** User location (GPS, IP address), Time, Date, Weather data (API integration), User profile data (purchase history, stated preferences – if available, anonymous browsing data).
*   **Processing:**  A rules engine (or machine learning model) determines relevant context tags. Example: “Paris, Rainy Day, User likes Italian Food”.
*   **Output:** A context tag vector representing the user's current situation.

**2. Complementary Item Database:**

*   Structure: A graph database. Nodes represent items. Edges represent relationships like “often purchased with,” “complementary to,” “frequently viewed with”.  Relationships have weights indicating strength of association.
*   Data Sources: Purchase history data, browsing patterns, expert-defined relationships (e.g., “wine pairs well with cheese”).
*   Indexing: Indexed by item category, tags (e.g., “rainy day activity”, “romantic dinner”, "travel essential").

**3. Dynamic Bundle Creation Module:**

*   **Input:** Localized offer listing content, Context tag vector.
*   **Processing:**
    1.  Identify primary item category from the localized offer.
    2.  Query the Complementary Item Database using the primary item category *and* the context tag vector.  Prioritize items with high relationship weights and those matching the context tags.
    3.  Create a bundled offer: combine the localized primary offer with 2-3 complementary items.
    4.  Dynamically adjust pricing for the bundle (discount, free shipping, etc.).

**4. Localization & Presentation Module:**

*   **Input:** Bundled offer data, User Locale.
*   **Processing:**
    1.  Localize all item descriptions, pricing, and bundle messaging.
    2.  Present the bundled offer via the second user interface (customer client device).
    3.  Track bundle performance (click-through rates, purchase conversions).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Bundle Creation):**

```
FUNCTION CreateDynamicBundle(localizedOffer, contextTags)
  primaryCategory = GetCategory(localizedOffer)
  candidateItems = QueryComplementaryItemDatabase(primaryCategory, contextTags) //Returns a list of items with relevance scores
  sortedItems = SortItemsByRelevance(candidateItems) //Sort by relevance score
  selectedItems = TakeTopN(sortedItems, 3) //Select top 3 items
  bundle = CombineOffers(localizedOffer, selectedItems) //Create bundle
  bundlePrice = CalculateBundlePrice(bundle)
  RETURN bundle
END FUNCTION
```

**Example:**

User in Paris, Rainy Day, Likes Italian Food views a localized offer for a Pasta Maker. The system dynamically bundles it with:

*   A bottle of Italian Olive Oil
*   A recipe book for Italian Pasta dishes
*   A waterproof carry bag.

The bundle is presented in French with a slight discount.
