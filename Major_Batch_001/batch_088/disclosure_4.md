## Adaptive Environmental Baseline for Multi-Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Expand the temperature-based filtering to encompass a broader range of environmental factors and dynamically adjust sensitivity thresholds based on learned baselines. This allows for more robust and accurate motion detection in complex environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensor Suite:**

*   **Core Sensors:**
    *   Motion Sensor (PIR preferred, but expandable to include mmWave radar).
    *   Temperature Sensor.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor.
    *   Humidity Sensor.
    *   Microphone (for environmental noise analysis).
*   **Optional Enhancement:**
    *   Air Pressure Sensor.
    *   Vibration Sensor (detects device movement vs. external motion).

**2. Baseline Learning Module:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Collect sensor data continuously over a defined “learning period” (e.g., 7 days).  Data must be time-stamped.
*   **Baseline Profile Creation:** For each sensor, generate a statistical baseline profile:
    *   Mean value.
    *   Standard deviation.
    *   Diurnal pattern (hourly average deviations).
    *   Short-term fluctuation analysis (moving average filtering).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Baseline profiles are *continuously updated* over time, adapting to seasonal changes and long-term environmental shifts. Weighting of recent data should be higher than older data in the continuous update.

**3. Motion Detection Algorithm:**

*   **Multi-Sensor Input:** Combine data from all sensors.
*   **Deviation Calculation:** For each sensor, calculate the *deviation* from the established baseline.  Use a Z-score calculation to normalize deviations.
*   **Weighted Summation:**  Calculate a composite “motion score” using a weighted sum of all sensor deviations. Weights will be configurable and potentially learnable (see section 4).
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** Define a dynamic threshold for the motion score.  This threshold will adjust based on:
    *   Time of day (based on diurnal pattern in baseline).
    *   Environmental conditions (e.g., higher sensitivity at night, lower during daylight).
    *   User-defined sensitivity settings.
*   **Motion Event Trigger:** If the motion score exceeds the adaptive threshold, a motion event is triggered.

**4. Machine Learning Component (Optional):**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ reinforcement learning to optimize sensor weights in the weighted summation (section 3). The reward function should prioritize accurate motion detection and minimize false positives.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Utilize anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual sensor readings that may indicate a malfunction or an attempt to tamper with the device.

**5. Data Storage & Processing:**

*   **Local Storage:** Implement local data storage for baseline learning and short-term analysis.
*   **Cloud Integration (Optional):** Allow data to be uploaded to the cloud for long-term analysis, model training, and remote diagnostics.

**Pseudocode (Motion Detection Core):**

```
// Initialize baseline profiles for each sensor
load_baseline_profiles()

// Main loop
while (true) {
    // Read sensor data
    temperature = read_temperature_sensor()
    light = read_light_sensor()
    humidity = read_humidity_sensor()
    motion = read_motion_sensor()

    // Calculate deviations from baseline
    temp_deviation = (temperature - baseline_temperature.mean) / baseline_temperature.std
    light_deviation = (light - baseline_light.mean) / baseline_light.std
    humidity_deviation = (humidity - baseline_humidity.mean) / baseline_humidity.std

    //Calculate motion deviation
    motion_deviation = motion

    // Calculate weighted motion score
    motion_score = (weight_temp * temp_deviation) + (weight_light * light_deviation) + (weight_humidity * humidity_deviation) + (weight_motion * motion_deviation)

    // Determine dynamic threshold
    dynamic_threshold = base_threshold + (time_of_day_adjustment * diurnal_pattern) + (environmental_adjustment)

    // Trigger motion event if threshold is exceeded
    if (motion_score > dynamic_threshold) {
        trigger_motion_event()
    }
}
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   The weighting of each sensor in the motion score is crucial. Experimentation and/or machine learning are needed to determine optimal weights.
*   Consider using a Kalman filter to smooth sensor data and reduce noise.
*   Implement a mechanism to detect and filter out transient events (e.g., a brief spike in temperature) that are not indicative of motion.
*   Explore the use of edge computing to perform data processing locally, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements.
