## Adaptive Spectrum Filtering Enclosure

**Concept:** Enhance the particulate exclusion enclosure with active spectral filtering of both illumination and reflected light, optimizing sensor readings and minimizing false positives caused by ambient light or material interference.

**Specifications:**

*   **Enclosure Material:** Translucent polymer housing with integrated micro-LED arrays and photodetectors.
*   **Illumination System:** Array of individually addressable micro-LEDs within the enclosureâ€™s second passage (incoming light path). LEDs capable of emitting a tunable spectrum (400-700nm).
*   **Spectral Analysis Module:** Photodetectors positioned after the mirror, monitoring the reflected light spectrum.
*   **Control System:** Embedded microcontroller with the following functionalities:
    *   Real-time spectral analysis of reflected light.
    *   Dynamic adjustment of micro-LED emission spectrum to maximize signal-to-noise ratio of detected reflected light.
    *   Algorithm to compensate for variations in material reflectivity and ambient light conditions.
    *   Communication interface for data logging and system calibration.
*   **Gas Flow Integration:** Existing gas flow system maintained. Gas flow can be pulsed or modulated in coordination with illumination to further reduce particle accumulation.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Compatible with a range of optical sensors, including photodetectors, spectrometers, and cameras.
*   **Mounting:** Adjustable mount for mirror and sensor positioning.

**Innovation Details:**

This system moves beyond passive particulate exclusion. By actively controlling the illumination and filtering the reflected light, it significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of the scanning process. The spectral analysis and dynamic adjustment of the LED array allow the system to adapt to different materials, lighting conditions, and environmental factors. The integration with the existing gas flow system provides a multi-layered approach to particulate exclusion. 

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-precision quality control in manufacturing.
*   Advanced material analysis.
*   Biomedical imaging.
*   Security scanning.
