## Dynamic PCIe Fabric with Computational Steering

**Concept:** Expand the multi-PCIe controller approach to create a dynamically reconfigurable PCIe fabric, not just for endpoint emulation, but for general-purpose computational acceleration. Instead of solely merging traffic *into* an emulation processor, actively *route* computational tasks *through* the PCIe fabric utilizing the controllers as specialized processing nodes.

**Specs:**

*   **PCIe Fabric Controller (PFC):** A modified PCIe controller capable of both standard endpoint/root complex functions *and* acting as a computational node. Each PFC contains:
    *   PCIe Interface: Standard PCIe interface for communication.
    *   Computational Core: A small, RISC-V based, or specialized (e.g. DSP, FPGA-lite) core.
    *   Local Memory: Small, fast SRAM for computations.
    *   Interconnect: High-speed internal interconnect for communication with other PFCs.
*   **Fabric Management Unit (FMU):** A dedicated controller responsible for:
    *   Fabric Topology: Maintaining a map of the PCIe fabric.
    *   Task Scheduling: Assigning computational tasks to available PFCs.
    *   Data Routing:  Directing data streams between PFCs and the host.
    *   Dynamic Reconfiguration: Adjusting the fabric topology based on workload.
*   **Software Interface (Fabric API):** A user-space API allowing applications to:
    *   Discover available PFCs and their capabilities.
    *   Offload computational tasks to the fabric.
    *   Manage data transfer to and from the fabric.
    *   Define custom dataflow graphs within the fabric.

**Operation:**

1.  An application identifies a computationally intensive task.
2.  The application uses the Fabric API to describe the task and its data dependencies.
3.  The FMU analyzes the task and partitions it into smaller subtasks.
4.  The FMU assigns each subtask to an available PFC based on its capabilities and the dataflow graph.
5.  Data is streamed to the appropriate PFCs.
6.  Each PFC performs its assigned subtask.
7.  Results are streamed back to the host or to other PFCs for further processing.
8.  The FMU dynamically adjusts the fabric topology to optimize performance.

**Pseudocode (Task Offload):**

```
// Application Code
task_description = create_task("image_filter", "apply_gaussian_blur")
input_data = load_image("image.jpg")

// Offload to Fabric
fabric_handle = connect_to_fabric()
task_id = offload_task(fabric_handle, task_description, input_data)

// Wait for Completion
result_data = get_result(fabric_handle, task_id)
save_image("blurred_image.jpg", result_data)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time video processing
*   High-frequency trading
*   Machine learning inference
*   Scientific simulations

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simply emulating hardware. The PCIe fabric becomes a general-purpose computational resource. The dynamic reconfiguration aspect enables adaptation to changing workloads and unlocks opportunities for novel algorithm design. This concept utilizes the PCIe infrastructure itself as the computational platform. It's akin to creating a distributed processing system *within* the PCIe bus itself.
