## Dynamic Environmental Storytelling via Projected Narrative

**Concept:** Expand the system’s capacity beyond presenting content *about* objects to actively constructing temporary, projected narratives *around* them, influenced by user interaction and environmental context.  This isn't just advertising or information; it's creating ephemeral, location-specific stories.

**Specs:**

*   **Narrative Engine:** A content creation and management system (software) that allows designers to define ‘story fragments’ – short, pre-rendered 3D animations, soundscapes, and projected visuals. These fragments are tagged with contextual metadata – object type, user profile characteristics (age, gender, interests – inferred or provided), time of day, weather conditions, proximity to other users, user emotional state (inferred via camera and potentially biometric sensors).

*   **Projection Mapping System:** An enhanced projector system capable of dynamically adjusting projection parameters (brightness, focus, keystone correction) in real-time to account for uneven surfaces and moving users. Multi-projector support for larger or more complex projection areas.

*   **Environmental Sensor Suite:** Integration of additional sensors beyond the structured light system:
    *   Ambient light sensors.
    *   Microphones (for ambient sound analysis & potential voice command integration).
    *   Temperature/humidity sensors.
    *   Optional: Wind speed/direction sensor.

*   **User Interaction Tracking (Enhanced):**  Beyond gesture recognition, incorporate gaze tracking and potentially subtle biometric data (heart rate variability, facial expression analysis) to gauge user engagement and emotional response to the projected narrative.

*   **Narrative Composition Algorithm:**  The core software module. This algorithm dynamically assembles story fragments based on:
    1.  Object Recognition: Identifies the object triggering the narrative.
    2.  Contextual Analysis: Assesses environmental conditions, user characteristics, and user interaction.
    3.  Fragment Selection: Chooses appropriate story fragments from a database.
    4.  Fragment Sequencing:  Arranges fragments into a coherent narrative sequence.
    5.  Projection Adjustment: Dynamically adjusts projection parameters for optimal viewing.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Composition Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION ComposeNarrative(objectID, userProfile, environmentData, interactionData):

    // 1. Identify relevant story categories based on objectID
    storyCategories = GetStoryCategories(objectID)

    // 2. Filter story fragments based on user profile & environment
    filteredFragments = []
    FOR fragment IN storyFragmentsDatabase:
        IF fragment.category IN storyCategories AND
           fragment.userProfileMatches(userProfile) AND
           fragment.environmentMatches(environmentData):
            filteredFragments.append(fragment)

    // 3.  Determine Narrative 'Arc' based on interactionData (e.g., user proximity, gaze duration)
    arc = DetermineNarrativeArc(interactionData) // e.g., "Mystery", "Humor", "Historical"

    // 4. Sequence Fragments (using arc as guiding principle)
    narrativeSequence = SequenceFragments(filteredFragments, arc)

    // 5. Generate Final Narrative Output
    finalOutput = GenerateOutput(narrativeSequence) // Combine visuals, audio, & projection settings

    RETURN finalOutput
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user approaches an antique chair. The system recognizes the chair and the user's inferred interest in history.  The narrative engine constructs a short, projected scene showing a fleeting glimpse of a historical figure sitting in the same chair, overlaid with atmospheric audio and lighting effects. If the user lingers and shows continued engagement (tracked via gaze & interaction), the narrative might expand to include additional historical context or a short dramatic scene.  A negative gesture (determined via gesture recognition) would immediately cease the narrative.
