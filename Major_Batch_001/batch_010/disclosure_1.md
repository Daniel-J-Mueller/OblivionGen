## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Tagging for Inventory

**Concept:** Extend the capacitive sensing framework to incorporate resonant frequency tagging of individual inventory items *within* the shelf array, creating a dense, item-level tracking system. Instead of just detecting *presence*, this allows for unique identification and dynamic inventory mapping.

**Specs:**

*   **Tag Design:** Each inventory item receives a small, passive resonant circuit (LC or similar) tuned to a unique frequency within a defined band (e.g., 100 kHz - 1 MHz). These circuits are extremely low-power and can be implemented using conductive inks or embedded components.  Tag size is minimized; ideally integrated into packaging or labels.
*   **Shelf Integration:** The capacitive sensors on each shelf are augmented with narrow-band receiver circuitry. Each sensor element is now capable of not just measuring capacitance, but also detecting the *frequency* of any resonant tag within its immediate range.
*   **Sensor Array Mapping:** The shelf array's sensor elements are precisely mapped to known physical locations. This mapping is critical for pinpointing the location of a specific resonant tag.
*   **Dynamic Frequency Assignment:** A central controller manages the frequency allocation to ensure no two tags occupy the same frequency within the same sensor range.  Algorithms dynamically adjust frequencies to avoid interference and optimize detection rates.  Frequency hopping could be implemented.
*   **Data Processing:** The controller receives frequency and amplitude data from each sensor element. Signal processing algorithms identify the resonant frequencies present and correlate them to specific inventory items. Location data is derived from the sensor element's physical mapping.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Data is transmitted to a central inventory management system using a standard wireless protocol (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN).
*   **Power Management:** Shelf sensors operate in a low-power listening mode.  When a tag signal is detected, the sensor increases its bandwidth and processing power.

**Pseudocode (Sensor Element Processing):**

```
FUNCTION process_signal():
    raw_signal = read_sensor_data()
    frequency_spectrum = perform_fft(raw_signal)

    IF detect_resonant_peak(frequency_spectrum):
        resonant_frequency = identify_peak_frequency(frequency_spectrum)
        item_id = lookup_item_id(resonant_frequency) // Database Lookup
        location = get_sensor_location()

        transmit(item_id, location, resonant_frequency)

    ELSE:
        // No resonant tag detected
        transmit(null, null, null)
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION detect_resonant_peak(frequency_spectrum):
    // Implement thresholding and signal-to-noise ratio analysis
    // to determine if a resonant peak is present
    // ...
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION identify_peak_frequency(frequency_spectrum):
    // Find the frequency corresponding to the highest peak
    // in the spectrum
    // ...
END FUNCTION
```

**Refinement Considerations:**

*   **Antenna Integration:** Utilize the capacitive sensor electrodes as antennas for both tag signal reception and potential tag interrogation/activation (low-power transmission to confirm tag presence).
*   **Multi-Sensor Fusion:** Combine data from multiple adjacent sensors to improve location accuracy and reduce false positives.
*   **Self-Calibration:** Implement self-calibration routines to compensate for temperature variations and sensor drift.
*   **Security:** Incorporate encryption and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to inventory data.
