## Dynamic Category Weighting via User Interaction & Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Expand the categorization system to not only *assign* categories but to continuously refine category importance based on user behavior (clicks, purchases, saves) *and* a temporal decay factor. This creates a personalized, evolving categorization profile for each item, moving beyond static hierarchical structures.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Item Category Profile (ICP):**  Associated with each item. Stores:
    *   `base_categories`: The initial categories assigned by the system (as per the provided patent).  (List of Category IDs)
    *   `user_interaction_weights`: A dictionary mapping Category ID to a weight value (float).  Initializes to 0 for all categories.
    *   `temporal_decay_rate`:  A configurable parameter (float, e.g., 0.95) determining how quickly interaction weights diminish over time.
    *    `last_updated_timestamp`: Timestamp of the last weight adjustment.

*   **Interaction Log:** A time-series database storing user interactions with items. Fields:
    *   `user_id`
    *   `item_id`
    *   `category_id` (of the interacted category)
    *   `interaction_type`: (e.g., “click”, “purchase”, “save”, “add_to_cart”)
    *   `timestamp`

**2. Algorithms:**

*   **Initial Category Assignment:**  Employ the existing categorization logic from the provided patent. This populates the `base_categories` within the ICP.

*   **Weight Update Function:** Called periodically (e.g., hourly) or on significant interaction events.
    1.  **Temporal Decay:** For each category in the ICP:
        `weight = weight * temporal_decay_rate`
    2.  **Interaction Weighting:**
        *   Query the `Interaction Log` for interactions with the item within a defined timeframe (e.g., last 7 days).
        *   For each interaction:
            *   Determine an interaction score based on `interaction_type`:
                *   Click: +0.1
                *   Add to Cart: +0.5
                *   Save: +0.7
                *   Purchase: +1.0
            *   Add the interaction score to the category’s weight.
    3.  **Normalization:** Normalize all category weights within the ICP to sum to 1.0. This ensures a probability distribution across categories.

*   **Category Ranking for Display:** When presenting an item, rank categories for display based on their normalized weights in the ICP.  High-weight categories appear prominently.

**3. System Architecture Modifications:**

*   **Interaction Log Ingestion:**  Implement a pipeline to ingest user interaction events into the `Interaction Log` database.
*   **Weight Update Service:** Create a service responsible for periodically executing the `Weight Update Function` for all items.  This could be a batch process or a real-time streaming process.
*   **Category Ranking Service:** Integrate a service to rank categories for each item based on its ICP.  This service would be called by the item display component.

**4. Pseudocode (Weight Update Function):**

```python
def update_category_weights(item_id, interaction_log, temporal_decay_rate):
    icp = get_item_category_profile(item_id) # Retrieve existing profile
    current_time = get_current_timestamp()

    for category_id in icp.base_categories:
        # Temporal Decay
        icp.user_interaction_weights[category_id] *= temporal_decay_rate

        # Interaction Weighting
        interactions = query_interaction_log(item_id, category_id, timeframe="7d")
        for interaction in interactions:
            if interaction.interaction_type == "click":
                icp.user_interaction_weights[category_id] += 0.1
            elif interaction.interaction_type == "add_to_cart":
                icp.user_interaction_weights[category_id] += 0.5
            # etc...

    # Normalize weights
    total_weight = sum(icp.user_interaction_weights.values())
    if total_weight > 0:
        for category_id in icp.user_interaction_weights:
            icp.user_interaction_weights[category_id] /= total_weight

    save_item_category_profile(icp)
```

**5.  Further Considerations:**

*   **Cold Start Problem:**  For new items with no interaction data, rely solely on the initial category assignment. Gradually incorporate interaction data as it becomes available.
*   **User Personalization:**  Extend the system to incorporate user-specific interaction data. This would allow for even more refined category weighting.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Conduct A/B tests to evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic category weighting compared to the static approach.
