## Adaptive Key Rotation with Behavioral Biometrics

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the delayed access concept by introducing *proactive* key rotation triggered by deviations in user behavioral biometrics, creating a dynamic security layer beyond static delays. It's aimed at mitigating risks associated with compromised credentials *after* initial authentication, providing a continuous security assessment.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometric Engine (BBE):** Continuously monitors user interactions (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, app usage patterns) during authenticated sessions. Establishes a baseline profile for each user.
*   **Deviation Analysis Module (DAM):** Compares real-time behavioral data against the established baseline.  Uses machine learning to detect anomalous behavior exceeding predefined thresholds.  Triggers alerts based on severity.
*   **Adaptive Key Rotation Service (AKRS):** Manages key rotation policies. Receives deviation alerts from DAM. Initiates key rotation when a significant deviation is detected.  Handles key distribution to relevant systems.
*   **Delayed Access Module (DAM - reused/extended):** Integrates with AKRS. Upon key rotation, the system enforces a configurable delay *before* allowing access with the *new* key.  This delay provides a window for detection of automated attacks or ongoing compromise.  Can leverage existing notification mechanisms.
*   **Policy Engine (PE):** Defines rules for deviation thresholds, key rotation frequency, and access delays.  Allows administrators to customize security settings based on data sensitivity and user roles.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  User authenticates and gains initial access with a key.
2.  BBE begins monitoring user behavior.
3.  DAM continuously compares real-time behavior to baseline.
4.  If DAM detects a significant deviation:
    *   AKRS is notified.
    *   AKRS initiates key rotation.
    *   New key is distributed.
    *   Delayed Access Module is activated, enforcing a delay before access with the new key is granted.
    *   Notifications are sent to security personnel and/or the user (optional, configurable).
5.  User attempts to access protected data.
6.  Delayed Access Module enforces the delay.
7.  After the delay, access is granted with the new key.
8.  BBE continues to monitor behavior, establishing a new baseline with the new key.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation Trigger):**

```
// DAM - Deviation Analysis Module

function analyzeBehavior(userID, currentBehaviorData):
  baselineData = getBaseline(userID)
  deviationScore = calculateDeviation(currentBehaviorData, baselineData)

  if deviationScore > threshold:
    triggerKeyRotation(userID)

function triggerKeyRotation(userID):
  newKey = generateKey()
  distributeKey(userID, newKey)
  activateDelayedAccess(userID, newKey, delayDuration)

function activateDelayedAccess(userID, newKey, delayDuration):
  //Configure access controls to require the newKey after the delayDuration
  setAccessControl(userID, newKey, delayDuration)
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `deviationThreshold`:  A numerical value representing the acceptable level of behavioral deviation.
*   `delayDuration`: The length of the delay enforced after key rotation (in seconds/minutes).
*   `notificationEnabled`:  A boolean flag to enable/disable notifications.
*   `baselineUpdateInterval`: Frequency at which user baseline profiles are updated.
*   `keyRotationFrequency`:  A limit on how often keys can be rotated to prevent denial of service.

**Novelty & Rationale:**

This system goes beyond passive delays to introduce *adaptive* security. By integrating behavioral biometrics, it proactively responds to potential compromises *during* an authenticated session, rather than relying solely on pre-defined delays. This significantly reduces the window of opportunity for attackers and enhances overall security posture. It dynamically adjusts the security level based on user behavior, providing a more seamless and effective user experience.
