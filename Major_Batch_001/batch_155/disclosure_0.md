## Dynamic Data Shadowing & Behavioral Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Extend the data access monitoring to proactively create “shadow copies” of sensitive data *during* access, coupled with behavioral profiling of the accessing application. This moves beyond merely detecting rule violations to predicting and preventing anomalous data manipulation *before* it completes.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadow Copy Engine:**
    *   Intercept data access requests (read/write) targeting sensitive data.
    *   Create a transient, in-memory "shadow copy" of the requested data *before* the access is fulfilled.
    *   The shadow copy is a complete, point-in-time replica of the data *at the moment of access*.
    *   All subsequent access is redirected *through* the shadow copy. Original data remains untouched until operations are approved.

2.  **Behavioral Profiler:**
    *   Monitor the accessing application's interaction with the shadow copy.
    *   Track operations performed: read patterns, write locations, data modification types, access frequencies, etc.
    *   Establish a baseline behavioral profile for each application/user combination. This profile is dynamic, continuously updated with observed behavior.
    *   Utilize statistical anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models, Isolation Forests) to identify deviations from the baseline profile.

3.  **Risk Scoring & Adaptive Mitigation:**
    *   Assign a risk score based on:
        *   Severity of deviation from baseline behavior.
        *   Sensitivity of the data being accessed.
        *   Confidence level of anomaly detection.
    *   Implement adaptive mitigation strategies based on risk score:
        *   **Low Risk:** Log the anomaly for auditing.
        *   **Medium Risk:** Prompt the user for confirmation before allowing the operation to proceed.
        *   **High Risk:** Block the operation entirely and alert security personnel.
    *   Option to automatically revert changes made to the shadow copy if a high-risk anomaly is detected.

4.  **Data Provenance Tracking:**
    *   Record a detailed log of all operations performed on the shadow copy, including timestamps, user IDs, application names, and data modification details.
    *   This log provides a complete audit trail for investigating security incidents and identifying malicious activity.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function processDataAccess(accessRequest, data):
  shadowCopy = createShadowCopy(data)
  behavioralProfiler = getProfiler(accessRequest.application, accessRequest.user)
  
  accessResult = performAccess(accessRequest, shadowCopy)
  behavioralProfiler.update(accessResult)
  
  anomalyScore = behavioralProfiler.detectAnomaly(accessResult)
  
  if anomalyScore > threshold:
    logAnomaly(anomalyScore, accessRequest, shadowCopy)
    # Implement mitigation strategy based on anomalyScore
    if anomalyScore > highThreshold:
      revertShadowCopy(shadowCopy)
      blockAccess()
  else:
    applyShadowCopyToOriginal(shadowCopy)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server infrastructure to support in-memory shadow copy creation.
*   Real-time data streaming and processing capabilities.
*   Machine learning libraries for behavioral profiling and anomaly detection.
*   Integration with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
