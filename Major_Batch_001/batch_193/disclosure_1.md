## Personalized Emotional Prosody Generation

**Concept:** Extend the existing text-to-speech system to generate output audio with dynamically adjusted emotional prosody based on real-time biometric data from the user *and* inferred emotional state of the message recipient.

**Specs:**

*   **Biometric Input Module:**
    *   Sensors: Integrate with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers) to capture:
        *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – Indicator of stress, relaxation, engagement.
        *   Skin Conductance (GSR) – Measures arousal levels.
        *   Facial EMG – Detects subtle facial muscle movements associated with emotions.
    *   Data Preprocessing: Noise reduction, artifact removal, and normalization of sensor data.
    *   Feature Extraction: Derive relevant emotional features (e.g., valence, arousal, dominance) from preprocessed data using machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests).
*   **Recipient Emotion Inference Module:**
    *   Text Analysis: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text message content (sentiment analysis, emotion detection).
    *   Contextual Data: Integrate data from recipient’s social media activity (with user consent), calendar events, and communication history to infer their current emotional state.
    *   Combined Inference: Fuse text analysis and contextual data to create a probabilistic model of the recipient's emotions.
*   **Prosody Control Module:**
    *   Emotional Prosody Database: Create a comprehensive database of speech samples with diverse emotional expressions (anger, joy, sadness, fear, etc.). Categorize samples based on prosodic features (pitch range, speaking rate, intensity, pauses).
    *   Prosody Mapping Function: Develop a function that maps the combined emotional state (user + recipient) to specific prosodic parameters.
        *   Input: Valence, Arousal, Dominance (user & recipient).
        *   Output: Target values for:
            *   Fundamental Frequency (F0) – Average pitch and pitch range.
            *   Speaking Rate – Words per minute.
            *   Intensity – Volume of speech.
            *   Pauses – Duration and frequency of pauses.
            *   Voice Quality –  (e.g., breathiness, tension).
    *   Dynamic Prosody Adjustment: In real-time, adjust prosodic parameters of the generated speech based on the output of the prosody mapping function.
*   **System Architecture:**
    1.  User sends text message.
    2.  Biometric Data Input: System receives biometric data from user’s wearable device.
    3.  Recipient Emotion Inference: System analyzes message content and contextual data to infer recipient’s emotional state.
    4.  Emotional State Fusion: Combine user’s biometric emotional state with inferred recipient emotional state.
    5.  Prosody Mapping: Apply prosody mapping function to generate target prosodic parameters.
    6.  Speech Synthesis: Generate speech using the original text and target prosodic parameters.
    7.  Output: Send synthesized speech to recipient’s device.

**Pseudocode (Prosody Mapping Function):**

```
function map_emotion_to_prosody(user_valence, user_arousal, recipient_valence, recipient_arousal):

    // Weighted Average of Emotional States
    combined_valence = (0.7 * user_valence) + (0.3 * recipient_valence)
    combined_arousal = (0.7 * user_arousal) + (0.3 * recipient_arousal)

    // Prosody Parameter Mapping (example)
    f0_mean = 120 + (combined_valence * 30)  // Higher valence = higher pitch
    f0_range = 50 + (combined_arousal * 20)   // Higher arousal = wider pitch range
    speaking_rate = 150 + (combined_arousal * 10) // Higher arousal = faster rate
    intensity = 70 + (combined_valence * 15)  // Higher valence = louder volume

    return f0_mean, f0_range, speaking_rate, intensity
```

**Expansion:**

Explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to synthesize novel emotional prosody variations based on the learned emotional prosody database, moving beyond simple parameter adjustments. Consider creating distinct "emotional voices" tailored to individual recipients, learning their preferred prosodic styles over time.
