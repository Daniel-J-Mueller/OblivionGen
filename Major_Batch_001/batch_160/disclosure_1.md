## Dynamic Authentication Profiles & Contextual Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the user authentication beyond device-centric verification to incorporate a dynamic, contextual trust score that influences authentication challenges. This moves beyond simply *verifying* a user to *assessing* risk in real-time, adapting the authentication process accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Inputs (Trust Score Components):**

*   **Device Trust:** (Existing in patent) – Device ID, App Version, OS, Known Exploits.
*   **Network Context:** IP Address, Geolocation (coarse), ISP, VPN/Proxy Detection, Network Reputation (blacklist/whitelist).
*   **Behavioral Biometrics:** Keystroke Dynamics (typing speed, rhythm), Mouse Movement (speed, patterns), App Usage Patterns (time of day, frequency, common sequences). *Requires passive data collection - implemented as a background service on trusted apps.*
*   **Environmental Factors:** Ambient Noise (detected via microphone – processed locally), Light Level (detected via camera – processed locally), Motion (accelerometer/gyroscope data) - used to approximate user environment and detect anomalies.
*   **Transaction Context:** (If applicable) – Amount, Recipient, Time of Day, Usual Transaction Patterns.
*   **Social Graph Data:** (Optional, with user consent) –  Connections to trusted accounts, shared activity.

**2. Trust Score Calculation:**

*   Each data input is assigned a weight based on its perceived risk contribution. (Weights are configurable via an admin panel.)
*   Data inputs are normalized to a 0-1 scale.
*   Weighted inputs are summed to generate a Trust Score between 0-100. (Higher score = higher trust).

**3. Dynamic Authentication Profiles:**

*   Define a set of Authentication Profiles, each triggered by a Trust Score range.
    *   **High Trust (80-100):** No authentication required. Silent verification.
    *   **Medium Trust (50-79):**  Low-friction authentication: Push Notification to a trusted device, biometric scan (fingerprint, face ID).
    *   **Low Trust (20-49):**  Multi-Factor Authentication: Push Notification + PIN/Password.
    *   **Critical Trust (0-19):** Account Lockout/Manual Review.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Trust Engine:** A dedicated service responsible for collecting, analyzing, and scoring trust data. (Microservice architecture).
*   **Authentication Proxy:** Intercepts authentication requests and routes them to the appropriate authentication method based on the Trust Score.
*   **Data Lake:** Stores raw trust data for analysis and machine learning.
*   **Admin Panel:** Allows administrators to configure weights, thresholds, and authentication profiles.

**5. Pseudocode - Authentication Proxy:**

```
function authenticate(user_id, request_data):
    trust_score = TrustEngine.get_trust_score(user_id, request_data)

    if trust_score >= 80:
        return "Authenticated - Silent Verification"

    elif trust_score >= 50:
        push_notification_result = send_push_notification(user_id)
        if push_notification_result == "Accepted":
            return "Authenticated - Biometric Scan"
        else:
            // Fallback to MFA
            return perform_mfa(user_id)

    elif trust_score >= 20:
        return perform_mfa(user_id)

    else:
        // Account Lockout/Manual Review
        return "Account Locked - Manual Review Required"
```

**6. Machine Learning Integration:**

*   Train machine learning models to:
    *   Detect anomalous behavior.
    *   Optimize trust score weights.
    *   Predict authentication failures.
    *   Adapt authentication profiles dynamically.

**7. Privacy Considerations:**

*   Minimize data collection.
*   Anonymize/Pseudonymize data where possible.
*   Obtain explicit user consent for data collection and usage.
*   Provide users with control over their data.
