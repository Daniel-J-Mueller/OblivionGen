## Dynamic Call Context Switching & AI Persona Blending

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple voice command execution *within* a single call to allow users to seamlessly switch call context – effectively layering AI ‘personas’ onto the conversation to handle parallel or specialized tasks. This goes beyond a single assistant responding to commands; it’s about dynamically assigning multiple, cooperating AI entities to different aspects of the same call, managed by the system.

**Specs:**

*   **AI Persona Library:** A catalog of pre-defined AI ‘personas’ with distinct skillsets and communication styles. Examples: 'Travel Agent', 'Legal Consultant', 'Technical Support', 'Creative Writer', 'Translator'. Each persona encapsulates specific knowledge bases and response templates.
*   **Contextual Trigger Phrases:** Beyond a single predefined utterance, employ a broader range of trigger phrases and natural language understanding to identify intent for context switching. Think: "Let's get some help with that," or "Can you look up the legal implications?"
*   **Persona Assignment Module:** Algorithmically determine the most appropriate persona(s) based on the identified intent and current call context. Prioritize based on user preference history and persona availability.
*   **Audio Stream Segmentation:** The system splits the audio stream into separate channels, one for each active persona. Each persona *only* hears and responds to relevant parts of the conversation, while the primary caller hears a blended output.
*   **Voice Modulation & Synthesis:** Each persona is assigned a unique vocal profile using voice synthesis, allowing users to instantly identify *who* is speaking.
*   **Dynamic Persona Blending:** Seamlessly switch between personas and blend their outputs during the same conversational turn. For example, the primary caller asks a question, the ‘Travel Agent’ persona provides initial options, and the ‘Legal Consultant’ persona immediately chimes in with relevant disclaimers.
*   **Persona Handoff:** Enable smooth transitions between personas. If a task requires expertise beyond the current persona’s skillset, the system should automatically hand off the task to a more appropriate persona.
*   **Real-time Contextual Memory:** Each persona maintains its own contextual memory, allowing it to track the conversation and provide more relevant responses.
*   **User Control Interface:** Allow users to explicitly request personas, adjust persona behavior, and control persona blending.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On receiving voice data:
audioData = receiveAudio();
intent = analyzeIntent(audioData);

if (intent == "SWITCH_CONTEXT") {
    requestedPersona = extractPersona(audioData);
    availablePersona = checkAvailability(requestedPersona);
    if (availablePersona) {
        activatePersona(availablePersona);
        currentPersona = availablePersona;
    }
}
// Process audio through currentPersona
processedAudio = currentPersona.processAudio(audioData);
outputAudio = blendAudio(processedAudio, mainCallAudio); // Blend persona's response with main call

transmitAudio(outputAudio);
```

**Expansion:** Tie persona activation to external data sources. For example, if the caller mentions a product, automatically activate the "Product Support" persona and provide relevant documentation. Create a marketplace for third-party persona development.
