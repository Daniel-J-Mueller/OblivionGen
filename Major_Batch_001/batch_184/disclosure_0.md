## Dynamic Research Note ‘Ecosystem’ & Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Expand the research note functionality beyond simple item comparison to a dynamic ‘ecosystem’ where notes evolve based on aggregate user behavior *and* proactively suggest relevant external information, effectively becoming living documents.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Data Structure – ‘Living Note’**

*   **Base:** Inherits all data from existing research notes (item comparisons, user-supplied text, accessed URLs).
*   **Behavioral Data Layer:** Records *how* users interact with the note (time spent on sections, links clicked, edits made by different users, 'helpful' votes, etc.). This is stored as timestamped event data.
*   **External Data Integration Layer:** Connects to external APIs (price tracking, reviews, social media sentiment analysis, product specification databases) *based on the items within the note*. This integration is dynamic, activated by item identification.
*   **Weighted Factor System:** Users assign weights to comparison factors (price, features, reviews, etc.). The system records *how* these weights change over time *for each user* and aggregates this data across all users for each item pair.

**II. Predictive Modeling & ‘Ecosystem’ Features:**

*   **Price Fluctuation Prediction:** Utilizing historical price data and aggregated user weighting, predict future price movements for items in the note. Display as a probability curve.
*   **Feature Importance Drift:** Track how the relative importance of different features changes over time across all users.  Highlight features experiencing rapid shifts in importance.
*   **Sentiment Analysis Integration:** Display aggregate sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) pulled from social media and review sites, broken down by feature. (e.g., “Battery life sentiment: 85% positive”).
*   **‘Emergent Feature’ Detection:** Algorithm identifies features *not* explicitly being compared in the note but are frequently discussed in external data sources (reviews, forums) related to the items.  Suggests adding these to the comparison table.
*   **‘Collective Intelligence’ Suggestions:**  Based on similar research notes created by other users, suggest additional items for comparison, potentially uncovering hidden alternatives.

**III. System Architecture & Pseudocode:**

*   **Microservice Architecture:** Implement as a series of loosely coupled microservices (Data Ingestion, Behavioral Analytics, External API Connector, Predictive Modeling, UI Presentation).
*   **Data Pipeline:** Real-time data ingestion via Kafka/RabbitMQ. Data stored in a NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) optimized for time-series data.
*   **UI Integration:**  Augment existing catalog pages with a ‘Living Note’ panel.

```pseudocode
// On catalog page load, check for existing Living Note for item pair
LivingNote note = findLivingNote(item1, item2);

if (note == null) {
  // Create new Living Note
  note = createLivingNote(item1, item2);
}

// Fetch data for display
pricePrediction = note.getPricePrediction();
sentimentAnalysis = note.getSentimentAnalysis();
emergentFeatures = note.getEmergentFeatures();

// Display data in Living Note panel
display(pricePrediction);
display(sentimentAnalysis);
display(emergentFeatures);

// Log user interactions for behavioral analysis
logInteraction(user, item1, item2, interactionType);
```

**IV. Browser Extension/Toolbar Functionality**

*   **Automatic Note Population:**  Extension detects items being viewed and automatically populates the initial comparison table with basic specifications.
*   **Content Snippet Integration:**  Allows users to highlight text on any webpage and add it as a comment within the Living Note.
*   **Real-time Updates:**  Extension pushes updates (price changes, sentiment shifts) to the Living Note in real-time.
