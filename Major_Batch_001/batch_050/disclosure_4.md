## Adaptive Data Masking with Behavioral Profiling

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically masks data *before* encryption based on observed user behavior and data access patterns. This goes beyond simple data type identification and policy enforcement; it anticipates *intent* and obfuscates data accordingly.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Analysis Engine:** Continuously monitors user interactions (queries, access logs, data manipulation) to build a profile of “normal” behavior for each user/group. Uses anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) to identify unusual access patterns.
*   **Data Sensitivity Matrix:**  Beyond simple data type labels (PII, confidential), this matrix assigns a dynamic sensitivity score to data elements based on context (e.g., a customer ID is more sensitive when combined with credit card information).
*   **Masking Library:**  A versatile library of masking techniques (redaction, substitution, shuffling, generalization, pseudonymization, tokenization, noise injection). Crucially, the selection of technique is *adaptive* and determined by the Behavioral Analysis Engine and the Data Sensitivity Matrix.
*   **Policy Orchestration Module:** Integrates with existing DLP policies but adds a layer of behavioral-based overrides.  If a user's behavior deviates from their established profile, the system automatically *increases* the intensity of masking, even if it would not be triggered by static policies.

**Workflow:**

1.  Data arrives at the API proxy.
2.  The Behavioral Analysis Engine assesses the user/group requesting the data.  It determines a “risk score” based on deviation from established behavioral norms.
3.  The Data Sensitivity Matrix evaluates the sensitivity of data elements within the request.
4.  The Policy Orchestration Module combines the risk score, data sensitivity, and existing DLP policies to determine the appropriate masking strategy.
5.  The Masking Library applies the chosen technique(s) to the data.
6.  Masked data is encrypted using a cryptographic key inaccessible to the remote service.
7.  Encrypted data is transmitted.

**Pseudocode (Policy Orchestration Module):**

```
function determineMaskingStrategy(userRiskScore, dataSensitivity, existingPolicies):
    if userRiskScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
        maskingLevel = AGGRESSIVE  // Redact or substitute all sensitive fields
    else if userRiskScore > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
        maskingLevel = MODERATE  // Pseudonymize or generalize sensitive fields
    else:
        maskingLevel = BASIC    // Minimal masking (e.g., truncate fields)

    if dataSensitivity == CRITICAL:
        maskingLevel = MAX(maskingLevel, AGGRESSIVE)

    // Apply existing DLP policies as a final filter

    return applyMasking(maskingLevel, data)
```

**Novelty:**  Current DLP systems are primarily reactive, triggered by defined rules. This system is *proactive*, anticipating potential misuse based on observed behavior and adapting its defenses accordingly. It moves beyond simply identifying sensitive data to understanding *how* it’s being accessed and *why* that access might be risky.  The dynamic sensitivity matrix allows for nuanced protection based on context.
