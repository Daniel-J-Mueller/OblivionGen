## Adaptive Load Balancer 'Shadowing' for Canary Deployments

**Concept:** Extend the load balancer state tracking to facilitate advanced canary deployments and rollback strategies by introducing a 'shadowing' feature. Instead of simply transitioning load balancers to 'in-service', create a multi-stage state incorporating 'shadow', 'testing', and 'live'.

**Specification:**

**1. Enhanced State Model:**

*   **Shadow:**  A replica of live traffic is mirrored to the new version of the application *without* affecting live users. The load balancer directs a percentage (configurable) of traffic to the shadowed instances.  No health checks are enforced on the shadow instances at this stage - purely for observation.
*   **Testing:**  A small percentage of *real* user traffic is routed to the new version. Health checks are enabled. Metrics are collected and compared against the live version.  Rollback is instant if critical errors are detected.
*   **Live:** Standard in-service state.  Full traffic directed to the new version.
*   **Removing:** As described in the base patent.
*   **Degraded:**  A new state indicating reduced capacity or performance issues.  Traffic is automatically reduced to this instance, and alerts are triggered.

**2.  Traffic Shifting Algorithm:**

*   **Shadow Phase:**  Traffic duplication based on a configurable percentage (e.g., 5%).  This can be implemented using techniques like network taps or specialized load balancer features.
*   **Testing Phase:** Incremental traffic shifting. Algorithm can be linear, exponential, or based on real-time performance metrics (e.g., error rate, latency).  The following pseudocode describes the incremental shift:

```pseudocode
function shiftTraffic(currentTrafficPercentage, targetTrafficPercentage, errorRateThreshold, latencyThreshold):
  if (errorRate > errorRateThreshold OR latency > latencyThreshold):
    return currentTrafficPercentage // Remain at current level
  else:
    increment = min(0.01 * (targetTrafficPercentage - currentTrafficPercentage), 0.1) // Max 10% increase per interval
    newTrafficPercentage = currentTrafficPercentage + increment
    return newTrafficPercentage
```

*   **Automatic Rollback:** If the error rate or latency exceeds predefined thresholds *at any stage*, automatically revert traffic back to the previous stable version.

**3.  Data Store Modifications:**

*   Add new 'state' values: 'shadow', 'testing', 'degraded'.
*   Add fields to track metrics during 'testing':  'errorRate', 'latency', 'requestCount'.
*   Include timestamps for state transitions for auditability.

**4.  API Endpoints:**

*   `POST /loadbalancer/{id}/shadow`:  Initiate shadow deployment.
*   `POST /loadbalancer/{id}/testing`:  Initiate testing phase. Specify target traffic percentage and thresholds.
*   `GET /loadbalancer/{id}/metrics`:  Retrieve real-time metrics for a specific load balancer.

**5. Background Process Integration:**

*   A background process continuously monitors load balancer metrics and automatically adjusts traffic shifting based on predefined rules.
*   The background process can also trigger alerts if critical errors are detected.

**6. Transient State Handling:**

*   Monitor instances transitioning between states (e.g., 'testing' to 'live').
*   During transition, limit traffic to prevent overwhelming the system.
*   Record all state transitions for debugging and analysis.
