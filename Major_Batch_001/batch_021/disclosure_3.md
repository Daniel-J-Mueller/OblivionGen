## Dynamic Resolution Tile Streaming with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the tile-based panoramic video system with dynamic resolution scaling per tile *and* a predictive buffering system leveraging user gaze tracking (or predicted gaze based on pan direction/speed) to prioritize tile downloads.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core System Architecture:**

*   **Tile Pyramid Generation:**  During video encoding, generate multiple resolution pyramids for each tile (e.g., 1/4, 1/2, full resolution). The highest resolution available is dependent on network conditions & device capabilities, selectable by user settings.
*   **Client-Side Resolution Request:** The client dynamically requests tile resolution based on the tile's distance from the active field-of-view center, the current pan rate, and network bandwidth. Tiles further from the center, or those rapidly moving out of view, are requested at lower resolutions.
*   **Server-Side Response:** The server responds with the requested tile data at the specified resolution.

**II. Predictive Buffering Module:**

*   **Gaze Tracking (Optional):** If gaze tracking hardware/software is available, use it to determine the user's point of focus within the panoramic video. This informs the buffering priority.
*   **Pan/Translation Prediction:** If gaze tracking is unavailable, *predict* the user's likely gaze direction based on the current pan rate and direction. A simple linear extrapolation is sufficient as a starting point.
*   **Priority Queue:** Maintain a priority queue of tiles to be downloaded.  Tile priority is calculated as:
    `Priority = (ProximityToGazeCenter * Weight_Gaze) + (TimeUntilVisible * Weight_Time) + (Resolution * Weight_Res)`
    *   `ProximityToGazeCenter`: Distance between tile center and gaze point (lower is better).
    *   `TimeUntilVisible`: Estimated time until the tile enters the active field-of-view (lower is better).
    *   `Resolution`:  Tile resolution (higher is better, but only to a point).
*   **Adaptive Download Rate:**  Dynamically adjust the download rate for each tile based on its priority and available bandwidth.
*   **Pre-Fetching:** Proactively pre-fetch tiles with high priority before they are needed.

**III. Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialize
tile_pyramid = load_tile_pyramid_data();
gaze_tracking_enabled = check_gaze_tracking_availability();
priority_queue = new PriorityQueue();

loop:
    active_fov = get_active_field_of_view();
    gaze_point = (gaze_tracking_enabled) ? get_gaze_point() : predict_gaze_point(active_fov);

    // Calculate tile priorities
    for each tile in visible_tiles:
        priority = calculate_tile_priority(tile, gaze_point, active_fov);
        add_tile_to_priority_queue(priority_queue, tile, priority);

    // Download tiles
    while (bandwidth_available() && !priority_queue.isEmpty()):
        tile = priority_queue.dequeue();
        requested_resolution = determine_resolution_based_on_distance_and_bandwidth(tile, active_fov);
        request_tile_from_server(tile, requested_resolution);

    //Display tiles in active FOV
    display_tiles(active_fov);
```

**IV. Server-Side Considerations:**

*   **Tile Storage:** Efficiently store multiple resolutions of each tile.
*   **Request Handling:** Quickly respond to tile requests at the specified resolution.
*   **Bandwidth Management:** Implement mechanisms to prevent overwhelming the server with requests.

**V. Future Extensions:**

*   **AI-Powered Prediction:** Replace the simple linear gaze prediction with a more sophisticated AI model trained on user viewing patterns.
*   **Foveated Rendering:** Implement foveated rendering, dynamically adjusting the rendering quality based on gaze direction.
*   **Collaborative Buffering:** In multi-user environments, share buffered tiles to reduce overall bandwidth usage.
