**Dynamic Reflective Pixel Array for Multi-Angle Viewing**

**Concept:** Instead of a static reflective layer, implement a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) array *within* each pixel, allowing the angle of reflection to be dynamically adjusted. This enables the display to maintain consistent brightness and contrast from a wider range of viewing angles. This builds on the reflective layer concept but adds active control.

**Specifications:**

*   **Pixel Structure:** Standard TFT backplane as described in the provided patent. However, the reflective layer is *not* continuous. It’s comprised of millions of micro-mirrors (MEMS devices) arranged in a grid pattern *above* the organic layer.
*   **Micro-Mirror Dimensions:** 5µm x 5µm (adjustable based on pixel density requirements). Each mirror is individually addressable.
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Electrostatic actuation. Each micro-mirror is suspended above electrodes within the organic layer. Applying a voltage to specific electrodes tilts the mirror.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller manages the array. It receives input from a viewing angle sensor (e.g., camera or infrared sensor) and calculates the required tilt angle for each mirror.
*   **Addressing Scheme:** A multiplexed addressing scheme is used to minimize the number of control lines. Row and column drivers select individual mirrors.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Micro-Mirrors: Silicon or Aluminum coated with a highly reflective material (e.g., silver or gold).
    *   Electrodes: Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) such as ITO.
    *   Organic Layer: Acts as a dielectric layer and provides structural support.
*   **Organic Layer Specifications:** Thickness of 2-3 micrometers. Must have high dielectric strength and low loss.

**Pseudocode for Control System:**

```
// Initialize viewing angle sensor and MEMS driver

loop:
    // Read viewing angle from sensor (horizontal, vertical)
    angle_horizontal = read_horizontal_angle()
    angle_vertical = read_vertical_angle()

    // Calculate target tilt angle for each micro-mirror
    for each micro_mirror in array:
        // Calculate the angle of incidence of light from the viewer
        incidence_angle = calculate_incidence_angle(micro_mirror, angle_horizontal, angle_vertical)

        // Calculate the required tilt angle to maximize reflection towards the viewer
        tilt_angle = calculate_tilt_angle(incidence_angle)

        // Send command to MEMS driver to set tilt angle
        set_tilt_angle(micro_mirror, tilt_angle)

    // Delay for a short period (e.g., 10 ms)
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   **Wide Viewing Angle:** Significantly improved viewing angle compared to conventional displays.
*   **Enhanced Contrast:** Dynamic adjustment of reflection maximizes contrast from various angles.
*   **Energy Efficiency:** By directing light towards the viewer, the display can reduce overall power consumption.
*   **Adaptive Brightness:** The system can adjust brightness based on ambient light and viewing angle.
