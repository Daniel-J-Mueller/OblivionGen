**Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping via Reflectance & Distance**

**Concept:** Expand the existing depth/reflectance analysis to actively map and *modify* the acoustic environment of a space, creating localized audio ‘sweet spots’ or noise cancellation zones.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing camera system (as described in provided patent)
    *   Array of miniature, directional speakers (minimum 8, optimally 16+) integrated with the camera housing. Speakers must have a frequency response range of 20Hz - 20kHz.
    *   High-precision microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+) integrated with the camera housing, capable of capturing spatial audio.
    *   Dedicated Digital Signal Processor (DSP) with sufficient processing power to handle real-time audio beamforming and environmental mapping.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Scene Analysis:** Utilize the existing reflectance and distance determination algorithms to identify surfaces within the scene. Assign material properties (estimated from reflectance data – e.g., hard/soft, absorbent/reflective) to each surface.
    2.  **Acoustic Modeling:**  Create a basic acoustic model of the space based on identified surfaces and their properties. This model will predict sound propagation and reflection patterns.
    3.  **Target Zone Definition:** Allow the user to define ‘target zones’ within the camera’s field of view – areas where they want enhanced or isolated audio. These can be defined through a UI, or automatically detected (e.g., identifying a seated person as a target zone).
    4.  **Beamforming & Phase Adjustment:** Based on the acoustic model and target zone definition, calculate the necessary beamforming parameters (direction, amplitude, phase) for each speaker in the array.
    5.  **Active Sound Control:**
        *   **Enhancement:** Direct amplified audio towards the target zone, leveraging reflections from surfaces to create a localized ‘sweet spot’.
        *   **Cancellation:** Generate anti-phase sound waves to actively cancel out unwanted noise within or around the target zone.  Noise source identification (via microphone array) will be required for this feature.
    6.  **Dynamic Adaptation:** Continuously monitor the acoustic environment (via microphone array) and adjust the beamforming parameters in real-time to compensate for changes in the environment (e.g., people moving, doors opening).
    7.  **Reflectance-Based Calibration:**  Utilize the reflectance data to calibrate the acoustic model and compensate for variations in surface reflectivity.  Higher reflectance = louder signal required, and more directed signal to prevent reflections.
    8.  **Pseudocode:**

```
// Scene Analysis & Acoustic Model
sceneData = analyzeScene(cameraInput); // Returns reflectance, distance, material properties
acousticModel = createAcousticModel(sceneData);

// Target Zone Definition
targetZone = defineTargetZone(userInput); // Could be manual or automatic detection

// Beamforming Calculation
beamParameters = calculateBeamParameters(acousticModel, targetZone);

// Sound Control & Dynamic Adaptation (Real-Time Loop)
while (true) {
    audioInput = captureAudio(microphoneArray);
    noiseSources = identifyNoiseSources(audioInput); // Optional
    beamParameters = adjustBeamParameters(beamParameters, noiseSources, acousticModel);
    outputAudio(beamParameters, speakerArray);
    updateAcousticModel(acousticModel, sceneData); // Periodic updates
}
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Personalized audio experiences (e.g., focused sound for video calls, immersive gaming).
    *   Noise cancellation in open office environments.
    *   Creating localized audio zones for public spaces.
    *   Assistive listening devices for individuals with hearing impairments.
