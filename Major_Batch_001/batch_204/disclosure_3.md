## Adaptive Acoustic Zones via Distributed Beamforming

**Concept:** Expand the multicast approach to dynamically create localized “acoustic zones” within a space, tailoring audio output to specific listener locations or groups, leveraging the distributed network of audio devices. This moves beyond simple multicast of identical audio and towards personalized, localized audio experiences.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Existing audio device network (as described in provided patent).
    *   Each audio device equipped with multiple microphones (minimum 2, optimal 4+ for beamforming).
    *   Optional: Ultra-wideband (UWB) or similar precise location tracking system for listener positioning (can be supplemented by audio-based localization).
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Zone Manager:** Central software component responsible for:
        *   Receiving listener location data (from UWB, audio localization, or manual input).
        *   Defining acoustic zones based on listener locations and desired coverage areas.
        *   Calculating beamforming weights for each audio device within a zone.
        *   Distributing beamforming weights to audio devices via a multicast protocol.
    *   **Beamforming Engine (on each audio device):**
        *   Receives beamforming weights from the Zone Manager.
        *   Processes incoming audio data.
        *   Applies digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms to steer the audio beam towards the desired location/zone, and nullify sound outside of the zone.
        *   Outputs processed audio through the device’s speakers.
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Module:**
        *   Utilizes microphone arrays on each device to map the acoustic environment.
        *   Identifies reflective surfaces, noise sources, and optimal speaker positioning.
        *   Provides data to the Zone Manager to refine beamforming algorithms.
    *   **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:**
        *   Real-time tracking of listener movement.
        *   Automated adjustment of beamforming weights to maintain optimal audio coverage.
        *   Seamless transitions between zones as listeners move.

*   **Pseudocode (Zone Manager – Simplified):**

    ```
    function create_zone(listener_location, zone_radius):
      zone_devices = find_devices_within_range(listener_location, zone_radius)
      for device in zone_devices:
        beamforming_weights = calculate_beamforming_weights(device, listener_location)
        multicast_weights(device, beamforming_weights)
    
    function calculate_beamforming_weights(device, listener_location):
      // Algorithm to determine optimal weights based on device position,
      // listener location, and acoustic environment.  Could use delay-and-sum,
      // Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR), or similar.
      weights = // ... calculation ...
      return weights

    function multicast_weights(device, weights):
      // Send weights to device via multicast protocol
      send_multicast_message(device, weights)
    ```

*   **Operational Modes:**

    *   **Personal Zone:** Creates a focused audio bubble around a single listener.
    *   **Group Zone:**  Establishes a shared audio experience for a group of listeners.
    *   **Spatial Audio:**  Positions audio sources in 3D space, creating an immersive soundscape.
    *   **Noise Cancellation Zone:**  Actively cancels out unwanted noise in a specific area.

*   **Future Enhancements:**

    *   Integration with virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems.
    *   Adaptive acoustic mapping based on listener feedback.
    *   AI-powered optimization of beamforming algorithms.
    *   Support for multi-channel audio sources.
