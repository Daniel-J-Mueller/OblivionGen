## Dynamic Code Coverage Weighting based on Module Interdependence

**Specification:** A system and method for dynamically weighting code coverage metrics based on identified interdependencies between software modules. This goes beyond simple aggregation by recognizing that coverage in one module *implies* a degree of coverage in dependent modules, and adjusts weighting accordingly.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on *achieving* a coverage threshold for promotion. This specification tackles the *meaning* of that coverage. A high coverage score in a core library heavily used by many modules should carry more weight than the same coverage in an isolated utility.

**Components:**

1.  **Dependency Graph Generator:** A component that automatically analyzes the codebase to generate a dependency graph. This graph maps each module to its direct and indirect dependencies.  Static analysis, API call tracing, and potentially even runtime observation will be used.  Output: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing module dependencies.
2.  **Coverage Data Collector:**  Standard code coverage collection mechanism (as described in the given patent) providing raw coverage data (lines, branches, functions) per module.
3.  **Weighting Engine:** The core of the system.  This engine calculates a weighted coverage score for each module.
4.  **Promotion Logic:**  Uses the weighted coverage scores to determine promotion eligibility, potentially using different thresholds for different levels of the deployment hierarchy.

**Pseudocode (Weighting Engine):**

```
FUNCTION calculate_weighted_coverage(module, coverage_data, dependency_graph):
  // 1. Base Coverage Score
  base_score = calculate_base_coverage_score(coverage_data)  // Lines/Branches/Functions covered

  // 2. Dependency Weight
  dependency_weight = 0
  FOR EACH dependent_module IN get_dependent_modules(module, dependency_graph):
    dependency_weight +=  get_coverage_score(dependent_module) * dependency_strength(module, dependent_module)

  // 3.  Weighted Score Calculation
  weighted_score = base_score + dependency_weight

  RETURN weighted_score

FUNCTION dependency_strength(parent_module, child_module)
  // Determine the strength of dependency, based on amount of code that uses a specific module.
  // Factors:
  //  - Number of API calls from parent to child
  //  - Size of the interface used
  //  - Criticality of the functionality provided
  strength =  (API_call_count * interface_size) * criticality_factor
  RETURN strength

FUNCTION calculate_base_coverage_score(coverage_data):
    // Logic to calculate coverage score based on lines/branches/functions.
    // (Standard code coverage calculation)
    score = (lines_covered / total_lines) * 0.5 + (branches_covered / total_branches) * 0.3 + (functions_covered/total_functions) * 0.2
    RETURN score
```

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   The Dependency Graph Generator could be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   The Weighting Engine could be a separate service that receives coverage data and dependency information.
*   Configuration options for dependency strength calculation. (e.g., different weights for API calls vs. data sharing)
*   Integration with existing promotion gates.
