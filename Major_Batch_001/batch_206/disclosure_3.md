## Adaptive Replication Granularity Based on Query Complexity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust replication granularity (table, row, or even column-level) based on the complexity of queries accessing the data. The system profiles incoming queries, assigns a complexity score, and then utilizes that score to determine the appropriate replication level for the involved tables.

**Specification:**

**1. Query Complexity Profiler:**

*   **Input:** SQL query text.
*   **Process:**
    *   Parse the query to identify involved tables, joins, WHERE clauses, and aggregate functions.
    *   Assign weights to different query features:
        *   Number of joined tables: High weight.
        *   Use of aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT): Medium weight.
        *   Complexity of WHERE clause (number of conditions, use of wildcards): Medium weight.
        *   Use of subqueries: High weight.
        *   Estimated data scan size: Medium weight.
    *   Calculate a complexity score based on weighted feature sums. (Example: `Score = (NumJoins * 10) + (AggFuncs * 5) + (WhereComplexity * 3) + (Subqueries * 8)`)
*   **Output:** Query complexity score.

**2. Replication Granularity Manager:**

*   **Input:** Query complexity score, current replication settings for involved tables, historical performance data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Define granularity levels:
        *   Level 0: Full table replication.
        *   Level 1: Row-level replication (based on a primary key range or hash).
        *   Level 2: Column-level replication (replication of specific columns needed by the query).
    *   Map complexity score ranges to granularity levels. (Example: `Score 0-20: Level 0, Score 21-50: Level 1, Score 51+: Level 2`)
    *   Dynamically adjust replication settings for involved tables based on the mapped granularity level. This could involve creating new replication streams for specific rows or columns.
    *   Monitor replication performance (latency, throughput) and adjust granularity mappings over time to optimize performance.
*   **Output:** Updated replication settings for involved tables.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Structures:** Use a hash table to store replication settings for each table. Each entry includes the current granularity level, replication stream identifiers, and performance metrics.
*   **Concurrency:** Implement asynchronous replication streams to avoid blocking query processing.
*   **Monitoring:** Collect replication performance data using a time-series database.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to support a large number of tables and replication streams.

**Pseudocode (Replication Granularity Manager):**

```
function adjustReplication(queryComplexityScore, tableInfo):
  if queryComplexityScore < 20:
    granularityLevel = 0 // Full table replication
  elif queryComplexityScore < 50:
    granularityLevel = 1 // Row-level replication
  else:
    granularityLevel = 2 // Column-level replication

  if tableInfo.currentGranularityLevel != granularityLevel:
    // Stop current replication stream
    stopReplicationStream(tableInfo.replicationStreamId)

    // Create new replication stream based on granularityLevel
    replicationStreamId = createReplicationStream(tableInfo, granularityLevel)

    // Update tableInfo
    tableInfo.replicationStreamId = replicationStreamId
    tableInfo.currentGranularityLevel = granularityLevel

    log("Replication settings adjusted for table " + tableInfo.tableName + " to granularity level " + granularityLevel)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced replication overhead for simple queries.
*   Improved query performance for complex queries.
*   Optimized resource utilization.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing workloads.
