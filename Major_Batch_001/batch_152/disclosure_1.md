## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Projection

**Concept:** Extend the environmental awareness beyond simple object detection to create a real-time, dynamic acoustic model of the space. This model isn’t just about *where* things are, but *how* they reflect and absorb sound. Then, proactively *project* synthesized acoustic events into that model to enhance or alter the perceived audio environment.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution LiDAR or Time-of-Flight cameras for detailed environmental geometry capture. (Update rate: 30Hz minimum)
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 elements) for ambient sound capture and source localization.
    *   Material classification sensors (e.g., spectral imaging, acoustic impedance measurement) to identify surface properties.
    *   Ambient temperature and humidity sensors.

2.  **Acoustic Modeling Engine:**
    *   Ray Tracing/Path Tracing Algorithm: Simulate sound propagation through the environment, accounting for reflections, diffraction, and absorption.
    *   Material Database: Store acoustic properties (absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient) for common materials. Allows for user customization/learning.
    *   Real-time Geometry Processing: Process LiDAR data to create a dynamic mesh representation of the environment. Incorporate moving objects detected by the sensor suite.
    *   Ambisonic Rendering: Generate 3D sound fields for playback through multi-speaker systems.

3.  **Synthesized Event Library:**
    *   Pre-recorded sound events (footsteps, speech, environmental sounds) tagged with spatial metadata.
    *   Procedural sound generation algorithms (e.g., for creating realistic reverberation tails).
    *   User-definable sound events with customizable spatial properties.

4.  **Projection Control System:**
    *   AI-driven “Acoustic Director”: Analyzes the current acoustic scene and dynamically selects/generates sound events to enhance the experience.
    *   Spatial Audio Engine: Positions synthesized sound events within the 3D acoustic model, taking into account listener position and orientation.
    *   Speaker Control: Adjusts volume levels and equalization settings for individual speakers to create a realistic sound field.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop

While (True) {

    // 1. Sensor Data Acquisition
    lidarData = acquireLidarData();
    micData = acquireMicData();
    materialData = acquireMaterialData();
    tempHumidity = acquireTempHumidityData();

    // 2. Acoustic Scene Reconstruction
    environmentMesh = createMeshFromLidar(lidarData);
    materialProperties = assignMaterialProperties(environmentMesh, materialData);
    currentAcousticScene = reconstructAcousticScene(environmentMesh, materialProperties, micData, tempHumidity);

    // 3. Event Selection & Generation
    selectedEvents = acousticDirector.selectEvents(currentAcousticScene, userPreferences);
    synthesizedEvents = generateSynthesizedEvents(selectedEvents);

    // 4. Sound Field Rendering
    soundField = renderSoundField(synthesizedEvents, currentAcousticScene);

    // 5. Speaker Control
    controlSpeakers(soundField);
}
```

**Applications:**

*   Immersive home entertainment (e.g., creating a realistic forest soundscape)
*   Adaptive audio for open-plan offices (e.g., reducing noise distraction)
*   Enhanced accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals (e.g., spatial cues for locating sound sources)
*   Virtual/Augmented Reality environments (e.g., realistic sound propagation in virtual spaces).
*   Museum or exhibit enhancement (localized audio to improve engagement.)
