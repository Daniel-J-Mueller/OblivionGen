## Adaptive Affective Advertising – System Specs

**Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust advertisement content *not* based on observed facial features directly, but on inferred emotional *intensity* and *valence* combined with predicted user attentional state – all driving procedural generation of advertisement visuals & audio.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Portable Computing Device (as per patent) with high-resolution front-facing camera.
*   Real-time processing unit capable of running lightweight neural networks (see Software).
*   High-quality audio output.
*   Optional: Eye-tracking sensor integrated into device.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Affective Inference Engine:**
    *   Neural Network trained on diverse datasets of facial expressions, vocal tone (if available), and physiological data (future expansion – heart rate via camera).
    *   Output: Continuous stream of *emotional intensity* (0-1 scale) and *valence* (-1 to 1 scale – negative to positive).
    *   Latency: < 50ms.
2.  **Attentional State Predictor:**
    *   Input: Facial landmark data (eye gaze direction if eye-tracking sensor is present, head pose).
    *   Algorithm: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained to identify states such as “focused”, “distracted”, “glancing away”, “peripheral vision”.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over attentional states.
3.  **Procedural Ad Generator:**
    *   Core: Rule-based system combined with parametric generative models.
    *   Asset Library: Modular library of visual elements (shapes, colors, textures) and audio snippets (music, sound effects, voiceovers).
    *   Parameters driven by:
        *   Emotional Intensity: Higher intensity -> more saturated colors, faster visual cuts, louder audio. Lower intensity -> pastel colors, slow transitions, softer audio.
        *   Emotional Valence: Positive valence -> uplifting music, bright visuals, friendly voiceovers. Negative valence -> darker colors, suspenseful music, cautionary voiceovers.
        *   Attentional State: “Focused” -> detailed visuals, complex audio, longer-form content. “Distracted”/“Peripheral” -> simpler visuals, attention-grabbing audio cues, short-form content.
4.  **Ad Delivery & Analytics Module:**
    *   Integrates with existing ad networks.
    *   Tracks user response (dwell time, click-through rate, inferred emotional response) to refine procedural generation rules and asset selection.

**Pseudocode (Procedural Ad Generation):**

```
function generateAd(emotionalIntensity, emotionalValence, attentionalState) {
  // Base parameters
  let bgColor = "white";
  let textColor = "black";
  let transitionSpeed = 1.0;
  let contentDuration = 5.0;

  // Adjust based on emotion
  if (emotionalIntensity > 0.7) {
    bgColor = colorGradient(emotionalValence, "red", "yellow");
    transitionSpeed = 0.5;
    contentDuration = 2.0;
  } else {
    bgColor = "lightgray";
  }

  if (emotionalValence < 0) {
    textColor = "darkred";
  } else {
    textColor = "blue";
  }

  // Adjust based on attention
  if (attentionalState == "peripheral") {
    displayLargeText("Limited Time Offer!");
    playSoundEffect("attentionGrabber");
    contentDuration = 1.0;
  } else {
    displayDetailedProductInfo();
  }

  // Generate Visuals & Audio
  generateVisuals(bgColor, textColor);
  generateAudio(contentDuration);

  // Display Ad
  displayAd();
}
```

**Future Expansion:**

*   Integration with physiological sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) for more accurate affective inference.
*   Dynamic adjustment of ad content based on user’s predicted long-term preferences.
*   Generative AI models to create unique visuals and audio on the fly, further personalizing the ad experience.
