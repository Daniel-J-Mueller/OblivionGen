## Dynamic Focal Point Adjustment via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the perspective transformation system to incorporate real-time biofeedback data – specifically, eye tracking and potentially even subtle facial muscle activity – to dynamically adjust the focal point *within* the transformed image. This goes beyond simply correcting perspective; it aims to create an image that feels more 'natural' to the viewer by aligning the transformed perspective with where the viewer is *actually* looking.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Integration:**
    *   Eye-tracking module (integrated into image capture device or external via wireless connection - Bluetooth/WiFi). Resolution: Minimum 120Hz sampling rate, accuracy within 1 degree of visual angle.
    *   Optional: Electromyography (EMG) sensors placed near facial muscles controlling eye movement and gaze (e.g., orbicularis oculi, frontalis). These would provide supplementary data for gaze estimation.
    *   Existing image capture device, processor, and memory as outlined in the original patent.

*   **Software Modules:**

    1.  **Gaze Estimation Module:**
        *   Input: Raw eye-tracking data (pupil position, gaze direction). Raw EMG data (optional).
        *   Processing: Kalman filtering to smooth gaze data and predict future gaze position.  Integration of EMG data to refine gaze estimation, particularly in cases of quick saccades.  Calibration routine to map eye movements to screen coordinates.
        *   Output:  Gaze coordinates (x, y) representing the point on the image where the viewer is looking, updated in real-time.

    2.  **Dynamic Perspective Adjustment Module:**
        *   Input: Original image, perspective transformation parameters (pitch angle, etc.), gaze coordinates.
        *   Processing:
            *   Identify regions of interest (ROI) around the gaze coordinates.
            *   Re-run the linear perspective transformation algorithm, but *weighted* towards preserving visual clarity within the ROIs. This means applying a stronger transformation to areas further from the gaze point and a weaker transformation to areas near the gaze point.
            *   Implement a “focal depth” parameter that controls the extent of this weighting. Higher focal depth = larger area of preserved clarity.
        *   Output: Dynamically transformed image.

    3.  **Biofeedback Learning Module (Optional):**
        *   Monitor user eye movements over time.
        *   Identify patterns in gaze behavior.
        *   Automatically adjust the focal depth parameter to optimize viewing comfort and perceived naturalness.

*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Perspective Adjustment Module):**

```
function dynamicallyTransformImage(image, perspectiveParams, gazeCoords):
  transformedImage = applyLinearPerspective(image, perspectiveParams)
  focalDepth = 100 // pixels - adjustable parameter
  roiRadius = focalDepth
  roi = createCircularROI(transformedImage, gazeCoords, roiRadius)

  for each pixel in transformedImage:
    distance = calculateDistance(pixel, gazeCoords)
    if distance <= roiRadius:
      # Preserve the original transformation for pixels within the ROI
      finalPixel = transformedImage[pixel]
    else:
      # Apply a stronger transformation to pixels outside the ROI
      # Transformation strength based on distance - inverse relationship
      transformationStrength = 1 - (distance / (imageWidth + imageHeight))
      finalPixel = applyTransformation(transformedImage[pixel], transformationStrength)

  return finalPixel
```

*   **Output Format:** Standard image format (JPEG, PNG) with metadata indicating gaze tracking status.

* **Potential Applications:** Augmented Reality (AR) displays, telepresence systems, gaming, user interfaces, accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
