## Adaptive Aesthetic Presets via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Expand the aesthetic analysis capabilities by incorporating real-time biofeedback from the user to personalize and dynamically adjust image evaluation and processing.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Wearable biosensor capable of measuring:
        *   Electroencephalography (EEG) – focus on alpha and beta wave activity.
        *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) – measuring skin conductivity.
        *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - measuring time variance between heartbeats.
    *   Wireless communication module (Bluetooth Low Energy preferred) for data transfer to the computing device.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Biofeedback Data Acquisition Module:**
        *   Receives and pre-processes raw biofeedback signals.
        *   Applies noise filtering and artifact removal techniques.
        *   Extracts relevant features (e.g., alpha/beta wave power, GSR peak amplitude, HRV metrics).
    *   **Aesthetic Preference Mapping Module:**
        *   Employs a machine learning model (e.g., neural network) trained to correlate biofeedback features with aesthetic preferences.
        *   Initial training data collected via a guided experience where the user views a series of images and provides subjective aesthetic ratings.
        *   The model learns to predict aesthetic preference based on the user's physiological response to different visual stimuli.
    *   **Dynamic Heuristic Adjustment Module:**
        *   Integrates the predicted aesthetic preference into the heuristic selection process.
        *   The system dynamically adjusts the weighting of different aesthetic criteria (e.g., color balance, composition, subject matter) based on the user's real-time physiological response.
        *   For example, if the user exhibits increased alpha wave activity when viewing images with warm colors, the system will prioritize color balance criteria that favor warm tones.
    *   **Adaptive Preset Generation Module:**
        *   Learns to create personalized "aesthetic presets" based on the user's long-term biofeedback data.
        *   These presets encapsulate the user's individual aesthetic preferences and can be applied automatically to new images.
    *   **User Interface:**
        *   Real-time visualization of biofeedback signals.
        *   Options to customize biofeedback sensitivity and calibration.
        *   Interface to review and refine aesthetic presets.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
WHILE (images_to_analyze) {
    // Get next image
    image = get_next_image();

    // Acquire Biofeedback Data
    biofeedback_data = acquire_biofeedback_data();

    // Predict Aesthetic Preference
    aesthetic_preference = predict_aesthetic_preference(biofeedback_data);

    // Adjust Heuristic Weights
    heuristic_weights = adjust_heuristic_weights(aesthetic_preference);

    // Analyze Image with Adjusted Heuristics
    analysis_results = analyze_image(image, heuristic_weights);

    // Present Results to User
    present_results(analysis_results);

    // Update Aesthetic Preference Model (ongoing learning)
    update_aesthetic_preference_model(biofeedback_data, user_feedback);
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static aesthetic criteria by actively incorporating the user’s emotional and cognitive responses to images.  The biofeedback loop creates a dynamic, personalized aesthetic evaluation process that can adapt to the user's evolving preferences and even detect subtle emotional cues that might not be consciously expressed.  This will allow the system to be highly effective for sorting and editing photos, especially in cases where the "best" image is subjective or emotionally resonant.
