## Dynamic Header Prediction & Prefetching Engine

**Specification:** A system to dynamically predict the next header type (MPLS or IP) in a packet stream and prefetch lookup table entries, significantly reducing pipeline stalls.

**Components:**

*   **Header Prediction Module:** A shallow neural network (3-5 layers) trained on observed packet header sequences. Input: Last N header types (e.g., last 4). Output: Probability distribution over the next header type (MPLS or IP).
*   **Dual Lookup Table Prefetcher:** Two separate prefetch queues, one for MPLS lookup table entries and one for IP lookup table entries.
*   **Prefetch Control Logic:** Based on the output of the Header Prediction Module, the Prefetch Control Logic triggers the prefetching of the most likely lookup table entries into the respective prefetch queues.  It maintains a confidence score and adjusts prefetch aggressiveness.
*   **Pipeline Integration:** A small buffer between the header prediction/prefetch logic and the MPLS/IP header processing circuits.  If a prefetch is successful (entry present in the buffer), the lookup is performed immediately. If not, a standard lookup is initiated.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The Header Prediction Module is continuously retrained with observed header sequences to improve prediction accuracy.  A feedback mechanism monitors prediction accuracy and adjusts the learning rate.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Control Logic):**

```
function handle_next_packet(packet):
  header_type_prediction = header_prediction_module.predict(packet.last_N_headers)

  if header_type_prediction.MPLS_probability > threshold AND mpls_prefetch_queue.is_empty():
    mpls_prefetch_queue.prefetch(packet.MPLS_lookup_key)

  if header_type_prediction.IP_probability > threshold AND ip_prefetch_queue.is_empty():
    ip_prefetch_queue.prefetch(packet.IP_lookup_key)

  if mpls_prefetch_queue.contains(packet.MPLS_lookup_key):
    route_packet_mpls(packet)
  elif ip_prefetch_queue.contains(packet.IP_lookup_key):
    route_packet_ip(packet)
  else:
    perform_standard_lookup(packet)

function update_prediction_model(observed_header_sequence):
  header_prediction_module.train(observed_header_sequence)
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Neural Network:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) preferred for sequence learning.
*   **Prefetch Queue Size:** 16-32 entries per queue, configurable based on network traffic patterns.
*   **Threshold:** Adjustable confidence threshold (e.g., 0.7) to control prefetch aggressiveness.
*   **Learning Rate:** Adaptive learning rate (e.g., Adam optimizer) to optimize model training.
*   **Hardware Implementation:**  ASIC or FPGA preferred for high-speed processing.
*   **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing MPLS/IP header processing pipeline.
