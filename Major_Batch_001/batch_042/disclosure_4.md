## Adaptive Spillover Table Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the spillover table concept to a dynamically sharded, distributed system. Instead of a single spillover table per data table, create a cluster of spillover tables, managed by a routing layer that adapts to transaction characteristics. This will improve concurrency and scalability beyond what a single spillover table can provide.

**Specifications:**

**1. Spillover Table Cluster Manager (STCM):**

*   **Function:** Responsible for creating, monitoring, and managing the cluster of spillover tables.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `shard_count`: Initial number of spillover table shards.
    *   `shard_growth_threshold`: CPU/memory usage threshold triggering shard creation.
    *   `shard_shrink_threshold`:  CPU/memory usage threshold triggering shard deletion.
    *   `replication_factor`: Number of replicas per shard.
*   **Operations:**
    *   `create_shard()`:  Allocates a new spillover table shard, registers it with the routing layer, and initializes replication.
    *   `delete_shard()`:  Removes a shard, redistributes its data (if necessary), and updates the routing layer.
    *   `monitor_performance()`:  Tracks CPU, memory, and I/O usage of each shard.
    *   `rebalance_shards()`:  Dynamically adjusts shard counts and data distribution based on performance monitoring.

**2. Transaction Routing Layer (TRL):**

*   **Function:**  Intercepts transactions destined for the data table and routes them to the appropriate spillover table shard.
*   **Routing Logic:**
    *   **Amount Sign:** Positive amounts are routed to shards optimized for "credit" transactions. Negative amounts are routed to shards optimized for "debit" transactions.
    *   **Amount Magnitude:**  Transactions exceeding a certain magnitude are routed to shards with higher throughput/storage capacity.
    *   **Account ID Hashing:**  Distributes transactions across shards based on a consistent hash of the account ID.
*   **Operations:**
    *   `route_transaction(transaction_data)`:  Determines the target shard based on the routing logic and forwards the transaction.
    *   `get_shard_location(shard_id)`:  Returns the physical location of a specific shard.

**3. Spillover Table Shard:**

*   **Function:**  A standard key-value store optimized for high-write throughput.
*   **Data Model:**
    *   `key`: Account ID + Timestamp (for conflict resolution).
    *   `value`:  Transaction amount.
*   **Operations:**
    *   `store_transaction(key, value)`:  Persists the transaction.
    *   `retrieve_transactions(account_id)`:  Returns a list of transactions for a given account.

**Pseudocode - Transaction Flow:**

```
function process_transaction(transaction_data):
    account_id = transaction_data.account_id
    amount = transaction_data.amount

    shard_id = TRL.route_transaction(transaction_data)

    if shard_id is not null:
        STCM.get_shard_location(shard_id)
        SpilloverTableShard.store_transaction(account_id + timestamp, amount)
    else:
        //Handle error -  Routing layer failed
        //Attempt to write directly to data table with appropriate locking
```

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   **Horizontal Scalability:** Add more shards as load increases.
*   **Data Replication:**  Replicate shards for fault tolerance.
*   **Sharding Key Selection:**  The combination of account ID and amount sign/magnitude will help distribute the load effectively.
*   **Dynamic Rebalancing:** STCM rebalances shards based on performance metrics to optimize resource utilization.
