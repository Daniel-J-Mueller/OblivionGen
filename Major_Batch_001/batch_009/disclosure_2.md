## Dynamic Data Sharding with Homomorphic Encryption

**Concept:** Extend client-side encryption to not only protect data *at rest* and *in transit*, but also facilitate secure, distributed computation *on* the encrypted data *before* it’s stored. This leverages homomorphic encryption alongside a dynamic data sharding strategy.

**Specification:**

**1. Sharding Algorithm:**

   *   Data is divided into multiple "shards" based on a deterministic function incorporating user ID and data type. This function ensures that related data (e.g., parts of a single object) are likely to reside on the same set of shards.
   *   Shard assignment is *dynamic* and periodically re-evaluated based on network conditions, server load, and user access patterns.  The re-evaluation doesn't require decrypting the data.
   *   A "Shard Map" is maintained (encrypted and distributed) that maps data identifiers to shard locations.

**2. Homomorphic Encryption Layer:**

   *   Each shard utilizes a Homomorphic Encryption (HE) scheme (e.g., BFV, CKKS) chosen for its suitability for the types of operations performed on the data within that shard.
   *   All data within a shard is encrypted using the shard’s HE key.
   *   Crucially, the HE scheme must support the necessary operations for the application. For example, social media application may require addition and multiplication to facilitate likes, views, etc.

**3. Secure Computation on Shards:**

   *   When a user requests a computation involving data across multiple shards:
        1.  The client obtains the relevant shard locations from the Shard Map.
        2.  The client sends requests to the shards to perform their portion of the computation on the encrypted data.
        3.  Each shard performs the computation homomorphically and returns the encrypted result.
        4.  The client aggregates the encrypted results to produce the final encrypted result.
        5.  The client decrypts the final result.

**4. Key Management:**

   *   Each shard has its own unique HE key.
   *   Keys are derived from a master key encrypted using a threshold secret sharing scheme. This protects against single points of failure.
   *   Key rotation is performed periodically to enhance security.

**5. Pseudocode - Secure Aggregation Example:**

```
// Client Side
function secureAggregate(dataIDs):
  shardMap = getShardMap()
  encryptedResults = []
  for dataID in dataIDs:
    shardLocation = shardMap[dataID]
    encryptedResult = callShard(shardLocation, "performOperation", dataID) //Operation is predefined
    encryptedResults.append(encryptedResult)

  aggregatedEncryptedResult = aggregateEncryptedResults(encryptedResults) //Homomorphic aggregation
  decryptedResult = decrypt(aggregatedEncryptedResult)
  return decryptedResult

//Shard Side
function performOperation(dataID):
  encryptedData = readData(dataID)
  encryptedResult = performHomomorphicOperation(encryptedData)
  return encryptedResult
```

**6. Error Detection and Correction:**

   *   Employ techniques such as Reed-Solomon codes on the encrypted data within shards to provide redundancy and resilience against data corruption or loss. This ensures that computations can still be performed accurately even if some shards are unavailable or contain corrupted data.

**7. Dynamic Shard Adjustment:**

   *   Implement a system that monitors shard performance (latency, throughput) and adjusts shard assignments dynamically to optimize performance and minimize latency. This system should be able to reassign shards without decrypting the data, ensuring ongoing data privacy.



This approach aims to move beyond simply encrypting data at rest to enabling secure, distributed computations *on* the data, opening up new possibilities for privacy-preserving data analytics and applications. It will require more complex infrastructure to implement compared to simply using encryption.
