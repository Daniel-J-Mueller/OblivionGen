## Adaptive NPC Threat Modeling via Procedural Narrative

**Concept:** Extend the NPC-driven security assessment by implementing procedural narrative generation to dynamically create and evolve threat scenarios within the gaming environment. This shifts from simply *reacting* to rule violations to *proactively* challenging users with realistic, evolving threats.

**Specs:**

**1. Narrative Engine Core:**

*   **Input:** Data model of network security environment (as per patent), current world state of gaming environment, user action logs.
*   **Process:**  A procedural narrative engine constructs a high-level “story” based on vulnerabilities identified in the data model. This isn’t a fully scripted story, but a set of interconnected goals, motivations, and constraints for the NPCs.  The engine uses a Markov chain or similar probabilistic model to generate NPC behaviors that align with these constraints.
*   **Output:** A set of NPC “directives” (goals to achieve within the gaming environment) and a probability distribution over possible actions for each NPC. These directives are dynamic and change based on user interaction and evolving vulnerabilities.

**2. NPC Directive Types:**

*   **Reconnaissance:**  NPCs attempt to map the gaming environment (representing the network) and identify potential targets (vulnerable systems).  These actions are modeled as in-game movements and sensor sweeps.
*   **Exploitation:**  NPCs attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in the gaming environment.  This could involve "attacking" (interacting with) specific entities or triggering events.  Success/failure is based on the security configuration of the corresponding system.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  If an NPC successfully exploits a vulnerability, it attempts to move laterally through the gaming environment, gaining access to other systems.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  NPCs attempt to "steal" data from the gaming environment, modeled as transferring objects or information to a designated "safe zone."
*   **Persistence:** NPCs attempt to establish a foothold within the gaming environment, making it harder for users to remove them.

**3. Dynamic Scenario Generation:**

*   **Vulnerability-Driven Scenarios:** The narrative engine prioritizes scenarios based on the severity and exploitability of vulnerabilities in the network data model. High-priority vulnerabilities result in more aggressive and complex scenarios.
*   **User-Driven Adaptation:** NPC behavior adapts to user actions. For example, if a user quickly patches a vulnerability, the NPCs might switch to a different attack vector or target a different system.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Incorporate “random events” (e.g., a simulated power outage, a new software release) that create unexpected challenges for both users and NPCs.

**4.  Game Mechanics Integration:**

*   **NPC “Reputation”:** NPCs gain or lose reputation based on their actions and user responses. A high-reputation NPC might be more difficult to track or disable.
*   **“Threat Level” Indicator:** A visual indicator displays the overall threat level in the gaming environment, providing users with a sense of urgency.
*   **“Red Team” vs. “Blue Team” Support:**  Allow users to take on roles as either “red team” (attackers) or “blue team” (defenders), creating a competitive environment.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Narrative Engine):**

```
function generate_narrative(network_data, world_state, user_actions):
  vulnerabilities = analyze_network_data(network_data)
  prioritized_vulnerabilities = sort_vulnerabilities(vulnerabilities)

  for vulnerability in prioritized_vulnerabilities:
    npc = create_npc(vulnerability)
    npc.directive = generate_directive(vulnerability)
    npc.action_probability = calculate_action_probability(npc.directive, world_state, user_actions)
    add_npc_to_world(npc)

  return world_state
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   This system requires a robust NPC AI engine capable of pathfinding, object interaction, and decision-making.
*   The procedural narrative engine should be designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the addition of new vulnerabilities, NPC types, and scenarios.
*   Consider using a rule-based system or a machine learning model to automate the generation of NPC directives and action probabilities.
*   The visual design of the gaming environment should clearly communicate the status of systems and the actions of NPCs.
