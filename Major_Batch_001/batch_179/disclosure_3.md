## Adaptive Sector Prioritization & Dynamic Antenna Reconfiguration

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of multi-radio mesh networks, specifically focusing on maximizing throughput and resilience in dynamic environments. It moves beyond static sector assignments to embrace real-time prioritization of communication sectors and *physical* reconfiguration of antenna directionality.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Mesh Node:** Equipped with a primary omnidirectional radio (for initial beaconing/discovery – as in the patent), *plus* four (or more) radios each coupled to a phased-array antenna system. Each phased-array antenna can electronically steer its beam across a defined angular range (e.g., 120 degrees).
*   **Environmental Sensor Array:** Integrated into each mesh node. This array includes:
    *   **Millimeter Wave Radar:** Provides high-resolution mapping of node density and movement within a radius of 50-100 meters.
    *   **Directional Microphone Array:** Detects sources of interference (e.g., other wireless devices, environmental noise) and their direction.
    *   **Visible Light Communication (VLC) Transceiver:**  Limited range, but provides a highly secure, interference-immune communication channel for localized coordination (e.g., between two adjacent nodes).

**Software/Algorithm Components:**

1.  **Real-Time Sector Mapping:**  Data from the environmental sensor array is fused to create a dynamic map of:
    *   Node density in each sector.
    *   Signal strength from neighboring nodes in each sector.
    *   Interference sources and their direction/intensity.
    *   Movement patterns of nodes within the mesh network.

2.  **Predictive Beamforming:** An AI-powered algorithm analyzes the real-time sector map to *predict* future communication demand in each sector. This prediction considers:
    *   Historical traffic patterns.
    *   Real-time node movement.
    *   Event-driven communication (e.g., video streams from mobile devices).
    *   Interference levels.

3.  **Dynamic Antenna Control:** Based on the predictive beamforming output, the phased-array antennas are dynamically steered to:
    *   Focus beams towards sectors with high predicted demand.
    *   Nullify interference sources.
    *   Establish directional links with high-priority nodes.

4.  **Adaptive Channel Allocation:**  The system dynamically allocates channels to the phased-array radios based on:
    *   Sector priority.
    *   Interference levels.
    *   Channel availability.
    *   Node capability (e.g., some nodes may support wider channels).

5.  **VLC-Assisted Coordination:** Adjacent mesh nodes use VLC to exchange:
    *   Sector maps.
    *   Channel allocation plans.
    *   Beamforming parameters.
    *   This allows for highly coordinated interference mitigation and channel reuse.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Antenna Control Loop):**

```
FOR each radio IN mesh_node.radios:
    sector_priority = calculate_sector_priority(radio.sector_map, historical_traffic)
    interference_level = detect_interference(radio.sector_map)
    beam_angle = optimize_beam_angle(sector_priority, interference_level)
    radio.set_beam_angle(beam_angle)

    available_channels = determine_available_channels(radio.sector_map, neighboring_nodes)
    channel = select_optimal_channel(available_channels, sector_priority)
    radio.set_channel(channel)
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simply discovering neighbors and selecting links. It actively *shapes* the wireless environment to maximize throughput and resilience. The integration of environmental sensors and predictive AI allows the mesh network to proactively adapt to changing conditions, making it ideal for dynamic, high-density environments like smart cities, stadiums, or disaster relief zones.  It’s a transition from reactive network management to *proactive* wireless environment control.
