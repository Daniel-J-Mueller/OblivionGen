## Personalized Affect-Based ASR Weighting

**Concept:** Extend the interaction history encoding to incorporate *affective* data gleaned from prosodic features and potentially even visual cues (if available) to dynamically weight the acoustic and language models during ASR. This isn't just about *what* the user says, but *how* they say it – their emotional state.

**Specifications:**

**I. Affective Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio data, optional video stream (facial expressions).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Prosodic Analysis:** Extract features like pitch, intensity, speaking rate, pauses.  Utilize a pre-trained model for basic emotion recognition (e.g., valence-arousal).
    *   **Visual Analysis (Optional):**  If video is available, employ a facial expression recognition model to identify emotions (anger, joy, sadness, etc.).
    *   **Affect Vector Generation:** Combine prosodic and visual features into a normalized “Affect Vector” representing the user's emotional state. (e.g., \[valence: 0.8, arousal: 0.6, anger: 0.1, joy: 0.7]).
*   **Output:** Affect Vector.

**II. Dynamic Weighting Module:**

*   **Input:** Affect Vector, Interaction History Vector (from existing patent), Acoustic Model Score, Language Model Score.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Affect-to-Weight Mapping:**  Implement a trainable function (e.g., a neural network) that maps the Affect Vector to weighting factors for the Acoustic and Language Models. This function learns how specific emotional states influence the relative importance of acoustic and linguistic cues. For example:
        *   High Arousal/Negative Valence (anger, frustration): Increase Acoustic Model weight (emphasize clarity in pronunciation, potentially reducing tolerance for disfluencies).
        *   Low Arousal/Positive Valence (calm happiness): Increase Language Model weight (emphasize contextual understanding, potentially accepting more relaxed pronunciation).
    *   **Weighted Score Calculation:** Combine the Acoustic Model Score and Language Model Score using the learned weighting factors:
        `Final Score = (Weight_Acoustic * Acoustic_Score) + (Weight_Language * Language_Score)`
*   **Output:** Final Score for each transcription hypothesis.

**III. Integration with Existing System:**

*   The Affective Feature Extraction Module and Dynamic Weighting Module are inserted *between* the acoustic model/language model output and the final transcription selection.
*   The Interaction History Vector from the existing patent provides contextual information. The Affect Vector provides *emotional* contextual information.
*   The weight mapping function is trained using a dataset of user utterances labeled with emotional states.  Reinforcement learning could be used to optimize the weighting function based on user feedback (e.g., transcription accuracy).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function CalculateFinalScore(acoustic_score, language_score, affect_vector, interaction_history_vector):
  // 1. Extract relevant features from affect_vector and interaction_history_vector
  affect_features = ExtractFeatures(affect_vector)
  history_features = ExtractFeatures(interaction_history_vector)

  // 2. Predict Acoustic and Language model weights using a trained NN
  acoustic_weight, language_weight = PredictWeights(affect_features, history_features)

  // 3. Calculate the weighted score
  final_score = (acoustic_weight * acoustic_score) + (language_weight * language_score)

  return final_score
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved ASR accuracy in emotionally charged scenarios (e.g., customer service calls, emergency situations).
*   More natural and human-like ASR results.
*   Potential for personalized ASR experiences tailored to individual user’s emotional states.
