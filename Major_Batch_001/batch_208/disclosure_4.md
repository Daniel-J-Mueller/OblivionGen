## Adaptive Session Footprinting with Bio-Behavioral Drift Detection

**Specification:** A system for establishing and continuously refining a “session footprint” encompassing not just request patterns, but also nuanced bio-behavioral signals derived from client-side interactions, to detect subtle deviations indicative of compromise.

**Core Concept:** Move beyond simply tracking *what* a session does (requests) to *how* a session does it (interaction style).  This isn't just about timing; it's about the subtle “texture” of user interaction.

**Components:**

1.  **Client-Side Agent:** A lightweight Javascript component embedded within the web application.
    *   **Data Collection:**  Captures:
        *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure - if available via device).
        *   Mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, trajectory, jitter).
        *   Scroll behavior (speed, smoothness, patterns).
        *   Touch event data (if applicable – pressure, area, velocity).
        *   Device motion sensors (acceleration, rotation – optional, user permission required).
        *   CSSOM Read/Write timings – When elements are rendered, read, or interacted with.
    *   **Feature Extraction:**  Calculates statistical features from raw data (mean, standard deviation, entropy, correlation).  Emphasis on complex, non-linear features.
    *   **Local Drift Detection:** A simple, localized drift detection algorithm to filter out momentary changes in behavior.
    *   **Secure Transmission:** Encrypts and securely transmits aggregated feature vectors to the server. (Prioritize privacy-preserving techniques.)

2.  **Server-Side Session Footprint Builder:**
    *   **Baseline Creation:**  Upon session initiation, establishes a baseline “session footprint” using the initial data received from the client.
    *   **Dynamic Footprint Refinement:**  Continuously updates the footprint with incoming data, applying a weighted average to account for recent behavior. (Exponential decay weighting).
    *   **Footprint Vectorization:** Represents the session footprint as a high-dimensional vector.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Employ a distance metric (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) to compare the current session footprint vector to the baseline vector. Establish a dynamic threshold based on historical data and session-specific factors.

3.  **Drift Classification Engine:**
    *   **Behavioral Clustering:** Use unsupervised learning (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) to cluster session footprints. Identify outlier clusters that deviate significantly from the norm.
    *   **Real-time Drift Scoring:** Assign a "drift score" to each session based on its deviation from the baseline footprint and the characteristics of its cluster.
    *   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the anomaly detection threshold based on the overall drift score distribution and the severity of detected anomalies.

4.  **Response System:**

    *   **Adaptive Challenge:** Implement a tiered response system based on drift score. Low scores trigger logging and monitoring. Moderate scores initiate a step-up authentication challenge (e.g., multi-factor authentication, CAPTCHA). High scores result in session termination and account lockout.
    *   **Emulation Data Injection:** Generate tailored emulation session data reflecting the compromised session's bio-behavioral profile. This provides the attacker with a realistic, but subtly flawed, session to trap and analyze their behavior.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Session Footprint Update):**

```
function updateSessionFootprint(sessionId, featureVector) {
  sessionFootprint = getSessionFootprint(sessionId); // Retrieve current footprint

  if (sessionFootprint == null) {
    // Initialize footprint with first feature vector
    sessionFootprint = featureVector;
    setSessionFootprint(sessionId, sessionFootprint);
    return;
  }

  // Weighted average update
  alpha = 0.1; // Learning rate
  updatedFootprint = (1 - alpha) * sessionFootprint + alpha * featureVector;

  setSessionFootprint(sessionId, updatedFootprint);
}
```

**Novelty:**

*   **Bio-behavioral Integration:** Moves beyond traditional request-based analysis to incorporate nuanced user interaction data.
*   **Dynamic Footprint Refinement:** Continuously adapts the baseline footprint to account for normal user behavior variations.
*   **Emulation Data Injection:** Leveraging bio-behavioral profiles to create realistic traps for malicious actors.
