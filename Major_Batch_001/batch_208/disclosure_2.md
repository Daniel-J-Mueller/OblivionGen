**Dynamic Key Sharding with Temporal Decay**

**Concept:** Extend the secure key storage by introducing key *sharding* combined with *temporal decay*. Instead of storing a single, encrypted second key, break it into multiple shards. Each shard is encrypted with the primary (smaller) key, but *also* with a time-based encryption layer. These shards are then distributed across multiple non-volatile memory locations.  The temporal layer ensures that shards become inaccessible (effectively deleted) after a pre-defined period, even if the primary key is compromised.

**Specs:**

*   **Shard Generation:** The second key will be divided into *n* equal-sized shards. *n* is configurable, with a default of 8.
*   **Encryption Layers:**
    *   **Primary Encryption:** Each shard is encrypted using the first (smaller) cryptographic key (symmetric). Standard AES-256.
    *   **Temporal Encryption:**  Each shard is then 'wrapped' in a time-sensitive encryption layer. This layer uses a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) based on a timestamp. The HMAC key is derived from the primary key and a shard-specific seed. The seed changes with each key refresh cycle, making replay attacks difficult. The timestamp is embedded within the encrypted shard data.
*   **Shard Storage:** Shards are scattered across multiple flash memory blocks.  A metadata table stored in persistent memory (fuse-based) tracks shard locations, timestamps, and HMAC keys. This metadata table itself is redundantly stored.
*   **Key Reconstruction:**  To decrypt the second key, the system must retrieve all shards *before* their timestamps expire.  The metadata table is consulted to determine shard locations and to verify timestamp validity. If a shard's timestamp is invalid, the reconstruction fails.
*   **Key Refresh:** A background process periodically regenerates the shards with new timestamps and seeds.  This refresh cycle prevents long-term compromise.
*   **Trigger Events:** External events (e.g., system tampering, detected intrusion) can immediately trigger shard regeneration and distribution.
*   **Shard Rotation:** The algorithm for distributing shards will change with each refresh.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
FUNCTION ReconstructKey(primaryKey):
  metadata = LoadMetadataFromFuseMemory()
  shards = []
  FOR EACH shardEntry IN metadata:
    IF shardEntry.timestamp > currentTime():
      shard = ReadShard(shardEntry.location)
      IF VerifyHMAC(shard, shardEntry.hmacKey, primaryKey):
        shards.append(shard)
      ELSE:
        RETURN Error("HMAC Verification Failed")
    ELSE:
      RETURN Error("Shard Expired")

  IF length(shards) == n:
    secondKey = CombineShards(shards)
    RETURN secondKey
  ELSE:
    RETURN Error("Insufficient Shards Retrieved")
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Fuse-based persistent memory (for metadata storage).
*   Flash memory (for shard storage).
*   Cryptographic accelerator (for AES and HMAC operations).
*   Real-time clock (for timestamping).

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Shard Count:** Adjust the number of shards (*n*) based on security requirements and storage availability.
*   **Threshold Cryptography:** Require a threshold number of shards to reconstruct the key, even if some are compromised or inaccessible.
*   **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** Incorporate DKG to generate the primary key itself, further enhancing security.
*   **Biometric Integration:** Tie key reconstruction to biometric authentication for added security.
