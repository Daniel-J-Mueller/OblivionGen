## Dynamic Resource Allocation via Predictive Failure Analysis & Layered Service Migration

**Concept:** Extend the layered approach to encompass predictive failure analysis. Rather than reacting *to* an event impacting resources, proactively migrate services *before* failure occurs, utilizing a learned model of component health and resource dependency. This anticipates resource scarcity and optimizes service availability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component Health Monitoring & Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time telemetry data from all physical datacenter/computer components (CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, temperature, power draw, network latency).
    *   Historical failure data (component failures, service outages, resource constraints).
    *   Log data (system logs, application logs, security logs).
*   **Modeling:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network) to predict the probability of failure for each component.  Model trained on historical data and continuously updated with real-time telemetry.
    *   Separate models for each component type (CPU, memory, disk, network).
    *   Confidence intervals associated with predictions.
*   **Output:**
    *   Failure probability score (0-1) for each component.
    *   Estimated time to failure (ETA).
    *   Confidence level for ETA.

**2. Service Dependency Graph (SDG):**

*   Dynamic graph representing the dependencies between all services running in the environment.
*   Nodes represent services.
*   Edges represent dependencies (e.g., Service A depends on Service B).
*   Edge weights represent the strength of the dependency (e.g., number of requests per second).
*   Continuously updated based on real-time service interactions.
*   Incorporates the criticality level from the existing patent as a node property.

**3. Layered Migration Engine:**

*   **Triggering Condition:** Failure probability of a component exceeds a predefined threshold *and* migration would not violate service level agreements (SLAs).
*   **Migration Strategy:**
    *   Identify services running on the potentially failing component.
    *   Traverse the SDG to identify all dependent services.
    *   Determine available resources on components in higher layers (based on existing layer definitions).
    *   Prioritize migration of critical services first.
    *   Migrate services to the least loaded component in an appropriate layer.
    *   Utilize containerization (e.g., Docker) for rapid service deployment.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**
    *   Automated rollback to the original component if migration fails or performance degrades.
*   **Resource Reservation:** Pre-allocate a percentage of resources on higher-layer components as a buffer for proactive migration.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function proactiveMigrate(component, threshold) {
  if (getFailureProbability(component) > threshold) {
    services = getServicesRunningOnComponent(component)
    for (service in services) {
      dependencies = getDependencies(service)
      targetComponent = findAvailableComponent(dependencies, service.criticality)
      if (targetComponent != null) {
        migrateService(service, targetComponent)
      } else {
        log("No available component found for service: " + service)
      }
    }
  }
}

function findAvailableComponent(dependencies, criticality) {
  //Finds a component that can support dependencies and is in a suitable layer
  //Considers resource usage, layer assignment, and dependencies
}

```

**4. Adaptive Layering:**

*   Dynamically adjust layer assignments based on component health and service dependencies.
*   If a component’s health degrades significantly, automatically demote it to a lower layer.
*   If a component’s health improves, promote it to a higher layer.
*   This ensures that critical services are always running on the most reliable hardware.

**5. Monitoring and Alerting:**

*   Comprehensive monitoring of component health, service performance, and migration activity.
*   Real-time alerts when component failures are predicted or migration fails.
*   Dashboards to visualize the overall health of the environment.
