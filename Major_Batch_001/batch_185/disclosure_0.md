## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping with Neural Resonance

**Concept:** Extend the beam selection capability into a dynamic acoustic mapping system. Instead of solely *selecting* a beam, the system will *morph* multiple beams, blending their characteristics in real-time to create a spatially-aware acoustic 'fingerprint' of the environment. This goes beyond direction-of-arrival and aims to model the *resonance* of the space itself.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Microphone Array: Minimum 32 microphone elements, arranged in a spherical or near-spherical configuration. High SNR microphones are critical.
*   Processing Unit: High-performance CPU/GPU cluster capable of real-time processing of audio data from all microphones. Dedicated neural network acceleration hardware (e.g., Tensor Cores) is required.
*   Memory: Minimum 64GB RAM for buffering and processing audio frames.
*   Storage: High-speed SSD for storing acoustic maps and model parameters.

**II. Software Architecture:**

1.  **Acoustic Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   Simultaneous audio capture from all microphone elements.
    *   Pre-processing: Noise reduction, automatic gain control, and synchronization.

2.  **Neural Resonance Network (NRN):**
    *   Architecture: Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) with recurrent layers (e.g., LSTM or GRU) for temporal modeling.
    *   Input: Multi-channel audio data from the microphone array.
    *   Output: A spatially-resolved "resonance map" representing the acoustic characteristics of the environment. This map will be a multi-dimensional array where each element represents the amplitude and phase response at a specific location in space.
    *   Training: Train the NRN on a diverse dataset of acoustic environments with labeled resonance characteristics (e.g., reverberation time, spectral centroid, etc.). Data augmentation techniques should be used to improve robustness.

3.  **Beam Morphing Engine:**
    *   Input: Resonance map from the NRN, desired target location for beam focus.
    *   Functionality: Implement a beamforming algorithm that *morphs* the weights of multiple beams to create a combined beam with the desired characteristics. The morphing process will be guided by the resonance map, allowing the system to adapt to the acoustic properties of the environment.
    *   Algorithm: Phase-weighted beamforming combined with dynamic filtering based on the resonance map. Filters will be applied to individual microphone signals to compensate for frequency-dependent reflections and resonances.

4.  **Spatial Audio Rendering Module:**
    *   Functionality: Render the processed audio data in 3D space, creating a realistic and immersive listening experience.
    *   Algorithm: Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) will be used to simulate the effects of sound propagation in the ear canal. The HRTFs will be customized based on the user's head size and shape.

**III. Pseudocode (Beam Morphing Engine):**

```pseudocode
function MorphBeams(resonance_map, target_location, beam_weights):
  // resonance_map: Spatially-resolved acoustic characteristics
  // target_location: Coordinates of the desired audio source
  // beam_weights: Initial weights for each beam

  // 1. Calculate beamforming weights based on target_location
  beamforming_weights = CalculateBeamformingWeights(target_location)

  // 2. Adapt weights based on resonance_map
  for each microphone i:
    for each beam j:
      // Calculate the resonance factor based on the resonance_map at microphone i
      resonance_factor = GetResonanceFactor(resonance_map, microphone_i)

      // Adjust the beam weight based on the resonance factor
      beam_weights[j][microphone_i] = beam_weights[j][microphone_i] * resonance_factor

  // 3. Apply beamforming weights to microphone signals
  output_signal = ApplyBeamforming(microphone_signals, beam_weights)

  return output_signal
```

**IV. Novelty:**

This concept moves beyond simple beam selection and creates a dynamic acoustic map of the environment. By modeling the resonance characteristics of the space, the system can adapt to changing acoustic conditions and provide a more accurate and immersive audio experience. The beam morphing engine allows for a flexible and precise control over the audio focus, while the neural resonance network provides a robust and adaptive modeling of the acoustic environment.
