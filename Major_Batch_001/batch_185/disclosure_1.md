## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Instead of solely focusing on endpoint detection based on directional audio and duration, this system attempts to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene from multiple audio streams, assigning probabilistic "object" labels to detected sounds, and using these labels to refine endpoint detection *and* provide contextual information.

**Specs:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Minimum of 4 synchronized microphones. Spatial resolution is prioritized over absolute fidelity.
*   **Acoustic Event Detection (AED):** A pre-trained AED model capable of identifying common sounds (speech, music, door slams, keyboard clicks, vehicle noise, etc.). This model's confidence scores will be used, not absolute classifications.
*   **Spatial Audio Processing:** Beamforming algorithms (similar to the source patent) to determine the direction of arrival (DoA) for detected sounds.  The system calculates a 3D sound map, associating detected event confidence with spatial coordinates.
*   **Scene Graph Construction:** A dynamic scene graph is built. Nodes represent detected sounds (from AED), edges represent spatial relationships (DoA, distance estimation), and node weights are determined by AED confidence.  Edges incorporate uncertainty (confidence intervals for DoA).
*   **Probabilistic Object Labeling:** Based on the scene graph, a probabilistic labeling system assigns "object" labels to sounds.  For example: a sound near a "desk" node might be labeled as "typing" with a certain probability, even if AED doesn't definitively identify it as such.  The system maintains a knowledge base associating sounds with potential objects and locations.
*   **Contextual Endpoint Detection:** Endpoint detection is modified. Instead of solely relying on pauses in a single direction, the system considers:
    *   The probability that a pause is *meaningful* given the context (e.g., a pause during speech is more significant than a pause during music).
    *   The likelihood that a detected sound *belongs* to the current utterance, based on the scene graph and object labeling.
    *   The possibility that a detected sound is *non-speech* that should be ignored for endpointing.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Endpoints are determined through a dynamic threshold which is determined by the confidence score of the object associated with the current segment of audio.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
AED_Model = Load_AED_Model()
Scene_Graph = Initialize_Scene_Graph()
Knowledge_Base = Load_Knowledge_Base()

// Processing Loop
For each audio frame:

    // 1. Acoustic Event Detection
    Events = AED_Model.Detect_Events(audio_frame)

    // 2. Spatial Audio Processing
    For each Event:
        DoA = Calculate_DoA(Event)
        Scene_Graph.Update_Node(Event, DoA)

    // 3. Scene Graph & Object Labeling
    Scene_Graph.Infer_Relationships()
    Objects = Scene_Graph.Label_Objects(Knowledge_Base)

    // 4. Contextual Endpoint Detection
    For each object:
        Contextual_Confidence = Objects[object].Confidence
        Weighted_Pause_Duration = Pause_Duration * (1 - Contextual_Confidence) // Higher confidence = less influence from pauses

    // 5. Endpoint Determination
    If Weighted_Pause_Duration > Threshold:
        Endpoint = Current_Frame
        Reset_Scene_Graph()

```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **User-Specific Profiles:** Adapt the knowledge base and thresholds based on individual user behavior and environment.
*   **Multi-Modal Integration:** Incorporate data from other sensors (e.g., cameras, motion detectors) to refine the scene reconstruction and endpoint detection.
*   **Real-Time Scene Adaptation:** Allow the scene graph to dynamically evolve as new sounds are detected and relationships are inferred.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual sounds or events that may indicate errors or unexpected situations.
