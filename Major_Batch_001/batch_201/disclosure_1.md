## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction via Multi-Modal Temporal Fusion

**Core Concept:** Expand the single-stream acoustic modeling into a system that reconstructs the acoustic *scene* – not just recognizing speech, but building a temporal model of all sounds present, differentiating between speech, interference, and other environmental sounds. This allows for more robust speech recognition in challenging conditions and opens avenues for scene understanding.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Input:** Integrate data streams beyond the core acoustic signal. This includes:
    *   **Visual Input:** Camera feed capturing lip movements and environmental context.
    *   **IMU Data:** Inertial Measurement Unit (accelerometer, gyroscope) data to capture head/device movement and potential sound source localization clues.
    *   **Microphone Array:** Utilize multiple microphones for beamforming, spatial audio analysis, and sound source separation.

2.  **Feature Extraction Modules:** Separate modules for each input modality:
    *   **Acoustic:** Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms, and potentially learned embeddings from pre-trained audio models.
    *   **Visual:** Lip reading features, object detection (identifying sound-emitting objects), and scene classification.
    *   **IMU:** Motion vectors, acceleration patterns, and orientation changes.

3.  **Temporal Fusion Network:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Transformer architecture – to model temporal dependencies *across* modalities.
    *   **Early Fusion:** Concatenate features from all modalities at the input layer.
    *   **Attention Mechanisms:** Employ self-attention and cross-attention to weigh the importance of different modalities and time steps.
    *   **Gated Mechanisms:** Utilize gated recurrent units (GRUs) or LSTM units to regulate information flow and prevent vanishing/exploding gradients.
    *   **Output:** A sequence of embeddings representing the reconstructed acoustic scene at each time step.

4.  **Scene Decomposition Layers:** Layers dedicated to disentangling individual sound sources within the reconstructed scene.
    *   **Masking:** Trainable masks applied to the fused embeddings to isolate specific sound sources (speech, interference, music, etc.).
    *   **Source Separation:** Employ source separation algorithms (e.g., Deep Clustering) within the network to separate the mixed audio signal into individual sources.
    *   **Output:** Separate embeddings for each identified sound source.

5.  **Acoustic Model Integration:** Feed the decomposed speech embedding into a traditional acoustic model (e.g., CTC or attention-based) for speech recognition.

6.  **Training Procedure:**
    *   **Multi-Task Learning:** Simultaneously train the entire system for speech recognition, scene decomposition, and sound source separation.
    *   **Loss Functions:**
        *   **CTC/Attention Loss:** For speech recognition.
        *   **Reconstruction Loss:** Minimize the difference between the reconstructed scene and the original input.
        *   **Source Separation Loss:** Minimize the difference between the separated sources and the ground truth sources (if available).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
# Input: Audio, Video, IMU data
audio_features = extract_audio_features(audio)
video_features = extract_video_features(video)
imu_features = extract_imu_features(imu)

# Temporal Fusion
fused_features = TemporalFusionNetwork(audio_features, video_features, imu_features)

# Scene Decomposition
speech_embedding, interference_embedding = SceneDecompositionLayers(fused_features)

# Acoustic Model
recognized_text = AcousticModel(speech_embedding)

# Output: recognized_text, speech_embedding, interference_embedding
```

**Novelty:** This extends the concept of side-task learning from predicting interference to actively *reconstructing* the entire acoustic scene, going beyond just recognizing speech and providing a richer representation of the surrounding environment. It combines multiple modalities to create a more robust and context-aware speech recognition system. The system isn't just predicting what is interfering with the speech, it's modelling *everything* happening in the audio, visual, and inertial spaces.
