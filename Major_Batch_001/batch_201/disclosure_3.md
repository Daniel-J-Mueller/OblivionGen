## Battery Package with Integrated Thermal Regulation & Shape Memory Alloy Contacts

**Concept:** Enhance battery performance and safety by integrating microfluidic cooling channels directly *within* the recessed regions of the electrode, coupled with shape memory alloy (SMA) contacts for reliable, self-adjusting connections.

**Specs:**

**1. Electrode Modification:**

*   **Recessed Region Design:** Expand the existing recessed region concept beyond simply exposing conductive layers. Design a network of microfluidic channels *within* the recessed areas of both anode and cathode. Channels should be dimensioned to maximize surface area for heat transfer (channel width: 0.2-0.5mm, channel depth: 0.1-0.3mm).
*   **Channel Material:** Utilize a thermally conductive polymer (e.g., polyetheretherketone - PEEK) or a ceramic material for channel construction.  Integrate the channels directly into the electrode material layer during fabrication.
*   **Electrode Material Compatibility:** Ensure electrode materials (LiCoO2, Graphite, etc.) are chemically compatible with channel materials and coolant fluids.

**2. Coolant System:**

*   **Coolant Fluid:** Employ a non-conductive dielectric fluid with high thermal conductivity (e.g., Novec engineered fluids or synthetic esters).
*   **Micro-Pump Integration:** Integrate a miniature, low-power micro-pump (piezoelectric or micro-gear pump) into the battery package. Pump capacity: 10-50 µL/min.
*   **Fluid Reservoirs:**  Design flexible micro-reservoirs within the battery package to store coolant fluid. Reservoir material: Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE).
*   **Flow Control:** Implement micro-valves (MEMS-based) to regulate coolant flow based on temperature sensors.

**3. SMA Contact System:**

*   **Contact Material:** Utilize a Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy for the tab connectors.
*   **SMA Configuration:**  Design the SMA tabs with a pre-set curvature that provides consistent contact pressure even with slight variations in battery package expansion/contraction or component tolerances.
*   **Heating Element Integration:** Integrate miniature resistive heating elements near the SMA tabs to trigger shape recovery (and increased contact pressure) on demand or based on temperature readings. Power requirement: < 50 mW.
*   **Contact Surface Coating:** Coat SMA contact surfaces with a high-conductivity metal (e.g., gold) to minimize contact resistance.

**4. Packaging & Control System:**

*   **Housing Material:** Utilize a thermally conductive polymer or composite material for the battery package housing to facilitate heat dissipation.
*   **Temperature Sensors:** Integrate multiple miniature temperature sensors (thermocouples or thermistors) within the battery stack to monitor temperature distribution.
*   **Control Algorithm:** Develop a control algorithm that adjusts coolant flow and SMA contact pressure based on temperature sensor data to maintain optimal battery operating temperature. Algorithm should prioritize preventing thermal runaway.
*    **Communication Protocol:** Implement a communication protocol (e.g., I2C or SPI) to allow the battery management system (BMS) to monitor battery temperature, coolant flow rate, and SMA contact pressure.



**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Initialize Variables
targetTemperature = 25°C
maxTemperature = 60°C
minTemperature = 10°C
pumpSpeed = 0
smaHeat = 0

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Read Temperature Sensors
  batteryTemperature = readBatteryTemperature()

  // Check Temperature
  if (batteryTemperature > maxTemperature) {
    pumpSpeed = increasePumpSpeed(pumpSpeed, 10)  // Increase Pump Speed
    smaHeat = activateSMAHeat(smaHeat, 5)  //Activate SMA heat
  } else if (batteryTemperature < minTemperature) {
    pumpSpeed = decreasePumpSpeed(pumpSpeed, 5)
    smaHeat = deactivateSMAHeat(smaHeat)
  } else {
    //Maintain Target Temperature
    pumpSpeed = maintainPumpSpeed(pumpSpeed, targetTemperature)
    smaHeat = maintainSMAHeat(smaHeat, targetTemperature)
  }

  //Control Pump & SMA
  setPumpSpeed(pumpSpeed)
  setSMAHeat(smaHeat)

  delay(100ms)
