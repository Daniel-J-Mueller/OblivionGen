**Automated Aerial Vehicle Swarm Energy Harvesting & Distribution**

**Concept:** Develop a system where multiple automated aerial vehicles (drones) collaboratively harvest energy from atmospheric phenomena – specifically, localized updrafts and downdrafts – and dynamically distribute that energy amongst themselves, creating a mobile, self-sustaining power grid. This moves beyond individual drone energy scavenging and leverages swarm intelligence for maximized efficiency and resilience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Drone Hardware:**
    *   **Propeller Design:** Variable pitch propellers optimized for both thrust *and* energy generation in turbulent air. Include micro-generators integrated into the propeller hubs, capable of converting rotational energy into electrical energy. Utilize lightweight, high-strength materials (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced polymers).
    *   **Aerodynamic Control Surfaces:** Small, rapidly adjustable control surfaces to fine-tune airflow over the propellers, maximizing energy capture even in variable wind conditions.
    *   **Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) Coils:** Each drone equipped with both transmitting and receiving WPT coils, operating at a standardized frequency. Range: 5-10 meters. Power transfer rate: up to 500W.
    *   **High-Density Battery System:** Solid-state batteries optimized for rapid charging and discharging. Capacity: 10 kWh.
    *   **Onboard Processing Unit:** High-performance embedded system for real-time data processing, flight control, and swarm communication.
*   **Swarm Software:**
    *   **Atmospheric Mapping:** Utilize onboard sensors (anemometers, barometers, GPS) and data from external sources (weather forecasts, other drones) to create a 3D map of atmospheric conditions.
    *   **Dynamic Flight Path Planning:** Algorithm that optimizes drone flight paths to maximize exposure to favorable updrafts and downdrafts. Prioritize areas with consistent, moderate wind shear.
    *   **Energy Distribution Algorithm:**
        1.  Each drone continuously monitors its own energy levels and the energy levels of neighboring drones.
        2.  Drones with excess energy wirelessly transmit power to drones with low energy levels.
        3.  A central coordinating algorithm (running on a designated 'leader' drone or ground station) manages the energy distribution network to ensure equitable power sharing and prevent any single drone from being depleted. The coordination also factors in flight path objectives, prioritizing mission completion alongside power needs.
        4.  Utilize a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to track energy transactions between drones, ensuring transparency and accountability.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Algorithm that identifies and responds to unexpected atmospheric events (e.g., microbursts, sudden wind shifts). Automatically adjust flight paths and energy distribution strategies to mitigate risks.
    *   **Communication Protocol:** Mesh network using a standardized wireless protocol (e.g., 802.11ad). Range: 500 meters. Data rate: 1 Gbps.
*   **Ground Station:**
    *   **Real-Time Monitoring:** Displays the status of all drones in the swarm, including their location, energy levels, and atmospheric conditions.
    *   **Swarm Control:** Allows operators to adjust swarm parameters, such as flight paths, energy distribution strategies, and anomaly detection thresholds.
    *   **Data Logging:** Records all sensor data and communication logs for analysis and optimization.

**Pseudocode (Energy Distribution Algorithm):**

```
For each drone in swarm:
  current_energy = get_energy_level()
  location = get_location()
  wind_data = get_wind_data(location)

  If current_energy < threshold:
    Request energy from nearby drones

  If current_energy > threshold:
    Share energy with nearby drones requesting energy

  Update energy levels based on received/transmitted power

  Communicate energy status and location to swarm
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Persistent aerial surveillance
*   Long-range delivery services
*   Environmental monitoring
*   Disaster response
*   Remote infrastructure inspection.
