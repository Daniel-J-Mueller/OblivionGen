## Adaptive Resonance Imaging for Defect Characterization

**Concept:** Expand the inspection system to incorporate adaptive resonance imaging (ARI) principles, moving beyond simple flaw *detection* to flaw *characterization* based on material resonance signatures. This allows for differentiation between benign imperfections and critical defects, reducing false positives and improving quality control.

**Specs:**

1.  **Resonance Excitation Module:**
    *   Integration of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or MEMS-based) into the support fixture.
    *   Programmable excitation frequencies ranging from 100Hz to 20kHz.
    *   Localized excitation – ability to excite specific areas of the device under test (DUT).
    *   Waveform generation: Sine, square, chirp, and custom waveforms.
    *   Amplitude control: 0-10V adjustable range.

2.  **Acoustic Emission Sensing Array:**
    *   Array of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) microphones positioned around the enclosure, particularly on the side walls and near the camera.
    *   High sensitivity (> -130dB SPL) and wide frequency response (100Hz - 30kHz).
    *   Each microphone coupled to a low-noise amplifier (LNA) with adjustable gain.
    *   Array geometry optimized for spatial resolution and beamforming.

3.  **Data Acquisition and Processing Unit:**
    *   High-speed, multi-channel data acquisition system (minimum 16 channels) with simultaneous sampling.
    *   Real-time signal processing algorithms including:
        *   Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency domain analysis.
        *   Wavelet Transform for time-frequency analysis.
        *   Beamforming to enhance signal directionality.
        *   Resonance peak detection algorithm to identify material resonances.
    *   Machine learning module trained to classify defects based on resonance signatures. (Supervised learning using labelled data.)

4.  **Control System Integration:**
    *   Integration with existing control system to synchronize excitation, data acquisition, and camera operation.
    *   Automated resonance mapping – software automatically sweeps excitation frequencies and maps resonance peaks.
    *   Defect localization – algorithms triangulate defect location based on resonance peak propagation.

5. **System Calibration:**
    *   A known “golden” sample for calibration.
    *   Calibration procedure for microphone array and excitation module.
    *   Automated compensation for environmental noise and vibrations.

**Pseudocode (Defect Characterization Process):**

```
// Initialize System
Initialize Excitation Module
Initialize Microphone Array
Calibrate System

// Define DUT Parameters
Set DUT Material Properties (Density, Young’s Modulus)
Set DUT Geometry (Dimensions)

// Resonance Mapping
For Each Frequency in Frequency Range:
    Apply Excitation Signal to DUT
    Acquire Acoustic Emission Data from Microphone Array
    Process Data: Apply FFT, Beamforming
    Store Resonance Map Data (Frequency, Amplitude, Direction)

// Defect Detection and Characterization
For Each Resonance Peak in Resonance Map:
    Extract Peak Features (Amplitude, Frequency, Width)
    Classify Defect Type using Machine Learning Model (Trained on labelled data)
    Localize Defect based on Resonance Propagation

// Output Results
Display Defect Map with Defect Types and Locations
Store Data with DUT Identifier
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

Existing inspection systems primarily focus on *visual* defect detection. ARI allows for *subsurface* defect characterization, differentiating between cracks, voids, delamination, and material inconsistencies *before* they become visible. This leads to improved quality control, reduced manufacturing costs, and enhanced product reliability.
