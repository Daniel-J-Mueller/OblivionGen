## Adaptive Environmental Projection System

**Core Concept:** Expand the portable display's functionality beyond simple information delivery to include localized environmental manipulation through projected augmented reality combined with haptic feedback.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Unit:** Transparent, flexible OLED/MicroLED display (as per patent - retains this feature). Dimensions variable, target size 15cm x 8cm, 2mm thickness.
*   **Projection System:** Integrated pico-projector capable of generating high-resolution, color-accurate images onto nearby surfaces. Luminosity: 500 lumens minimum. Projection range: 0.2m - 1.0m.  Includes dynamic keystone correction and surface mapping.
*   **Haptic Emitter Array:** An array of micro-actuators embedded within the display's frame.  Capable of generating localized pressure, vibration, and thermal sensations on the userâ€™s skin directly adjacent to the projected image. Resolution: 5mm spacing. Force range: 0 - 2N.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Depth Sensor (Time-of-Flight): For accurate surface mapping and gesture recognition. Range: 0.1m - 2m. Resolution: 5cm.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: For automatic brightness adjustment of both the display and projector.
    *   Temperature Sensor: For localized thermal haptic feedback.
    *   Microphone Array: For voice control and ambient sound analysis (used for contextual projection).
*   **Wireless Communication:** Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for precise location tracking.
*   **Power:** Wireless power receiver (compatible with existing Qi standard, extended range version). Battery backup for limited operation (30 minutes).
*   **Processing Unit:** Integrated System-on-Chip (SoC) with dedicated AI accelerator for real-time image processing, sensor fusion, and haptic feedback control.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Dynamic Augmented Reality:**  The system projects interactive elements onto surfaces, creating a mixed reality experience.  Example: Projecting a virtual keyboard onto a table, or displaying contextual information overlaid on real-world objects.
2.  **Localized Haptic Feedback:**  Haptic emitters synchronize with projected images, creating tactile sensations.  Example: Feeling the texture of a virtual object, or receiving a gentle nudge to indicate a direction.
3.  **Environmental Simulation:**  The system can simulate basic environmental effects.  Example: Projecting a virtual flame with accompanying warmth, or creating the illusion of a breeze.
4.  **Contextual Awareness:**  The sensor suite analyzes the surrounding environment and adapts the projected content accordingly. Example: Displaying relevant information based on the user's location, or adjusting the brightness of the projection based on ambient light levels.
5.  **Gesture Control:**  Users can interact with the projected content using hand gestures, detected by the depth sensor.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Synchronization):**

```
function updateHapticFeedback(projectedImage, hapticEmitterArray):
  for each pixel in projectedImage:
    x = pixel.x
    y = pixel.y
    intensity = pixel.intensity

    emitterIndex = mapPixelToEmitter(x, y)

    if emitterIndex is valid:
      setEmitterForce(emitterIndex, intensity * scalingFactor)
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Gaming:** Immersive gaming experiences with tactile feedback and environmental simulation.
*   **Education:** Interactive learning tools with hands-on simulations.
*   **Accessibility:** Assistive technology for visually impaired users (e.g., tactile maps, object recognition).
*   **Remote Collaboration:**  Shared augmented reality experiences for remote teams.
*   **Industrial Maintenance:**  Guided repair procedures with step-by-step instructions overlaid on the equipment.
