## Dynamic Permissioned Data Streams – "Ghost Shopping"

**Concept:** Expand on the temporary access token idea to create a system where a sales representative (agent) doesn't *see* full account data, but receives a dynamically filtered "data stream" relevant *only* to the current interaction, and decaying over time. This allows for highly personalized assistance *without* granting persistent access or storing sensitive information. Imagine the agent only 'sees' what the user is actively discussing, or what is relevant to a potential purchase *right now*.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Ghost Stream" – a temporary, encrypted data stream generated by the host computing device. This stream is *not* a copy of account data, but a calculated view based on user interaction and pre-defined permission levels.
*   **Interaction Trigger:** The Ghost Stream activates upon initiation of a communication session (voice, text, video) between the user and agent.
*   **Data Filtering:**  Filtering parameters are determined by:
    *   **User-Defined Privacy Levels:**  User selects broad categories (e.g., "Show purchase history related to sporting goods," "Do not share address," "Mask partial credit card number").
    *   **Contextual Relevance:**  The system analyzes the current conversation. Keywords, expressed needs, and product inquiries trigger specific data points to be included in the stream.
    *   **Time Decay:**  Data points in the stream have a defined lifespan. For example, a previously viewed item may be removed from the stream after 5 minutes if it's not revisited in the conversation.
*   **Data Presentation:** The agent's device receives a structured data feed, *not* direct access to the account. The agent's UI presents this data in a pre-formatted way.
*   **Encryption:** The Ghost Stream is end-to-end encrypted.  Only the agent device (with correct credentials) and the host computing device can decrypt it.
*   **Logging & Auditing:**  All data access within the Ghost Stream is logged for audit purposes. No raw account data is stored on the agent's device.
*   **Access Control:**  Permission to include specific data types in the stream is controlled by a granular permission system on the host server.

**Pseudocode (Host Computing Device - Stream Generation):**

```
function generateGhostStream(userID, agentID, currentConversation):
    userAccount = getUserAccount(userID)
    privacySettings = getUserPrivacySettings(userID)
    relevantData = []

    // Filter data based on privacy settings
    filteredPurchaseHistory = filterPurchaseHistory(userAccount.purchaseHistory, privacySettings)
    filteredPaymentInfo = maskPaymentInfo(userAccount.paymentInfo, privacySettings)
    filteredAddress = maskAddress(userAccount.address, privacySettings)

    // Add data based on conversational context (keyword matching, intent analysis)
    if (conversationContainsKeyword("running shoes")):
        relevantData.append(filteredPurchaseHistory.runningShoes)

    if (userExpressesIntent("find gift for daughter")):
        relevantData.append(userAccount.daughterInterests)

    // Apply time decay to relevant data (remove stale information)
    decayedRelevantData = applyTimeDecay(relevantData, 5 minutes)

    // Encrypt the data stream
    encryptedStream = encryptData(decayedRelevantData, agentID)

    return encryptedStream
```

**Engineer Considerations:**

*   Develop a robust conversational analysis engine to accurately determine contextual relevance.
*   Implement a highly secure encryption and key management system.
*   Design a flexible permission system to accommodate evolving privacy requirements.
*   Optimize data filtering and streaming performance to minimize latency.
*   Focus on user interface design to present the Ghost Stream data in a clear and intuitive manner for the agent.
