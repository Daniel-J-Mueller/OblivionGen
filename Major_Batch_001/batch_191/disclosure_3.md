## Dynamic Sender Reputation & Predictive Blocking

**Concept:** Expand upon complaint thresholds by introducing a predictive element. Instead of *reacting* to complaints, proactively assess the likelihood of future complaints based on message content *before* delivery, and dynamically adjust delivery acceptance/delay or require sender authentication steps.

**Specs:**

**1. Content Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw email content (text, HTML, attachments).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify keywords/phrases associated with spam/phishing/unwanted content. Utilize a continuously updated database of ‘flag’ terms.
    *   Image analysis to detect logos/branding associated with known malicious actors or deceptive practices. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images to extract embedded text.
    *   Link analysis: Extract all URLs and check against known blacklists. Evaluate URL shortening services with increased scrutiny. Analyze the destination website’s content (similarly to email content analysis).
    *   Attachment analysis: Scan attachments for malware, executable code, and suspicious file types. Analyze file metadata.
*   **Output:** ‘Risk Score’ – a numerical representation of the likelihood that the email is unwanted, ranging from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).

**2. Behavioral Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Sender IP address, sending volume (emails/hour), recipient list size, historical complaint rates for the sender, time of day/week of sending.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Establish baseline sending patterns for the sender.
    *   Detect anomalies: Sudden increases in sending volume, sending to unusually large recipient lists, sending during off-peak hours, sending to recipients with low engagement rates.
    *   Analyze recipient engagement: Track open rates, click-through rates, bounce rates, and spam reports.
*   **Output:** ‘Anomaly Score’ – a numerical representation of how much the sender's behavior deviates from established norms.

**3. Dynamic Threshold Engine:**

*   **Input:** Risk Score, Anomaly Score, historical complaint data, recipient preferences (e.g., sensitivity to advertising), and a configurable ‘safety level’ (low, medium, high).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Combine Risk Score and Anomaly Score using a weighted formula to generate a ‘Combined Score’.
    *   Compare the Combined Score to dynamically adjusted thresholds. Thresholds are adjusted based on:
        *   Recipient's historical spam reporting behavior.
        *   Sender's overall reputation.
        *   Current threat landscape (e.g., increased phishing attacks).
*   **Output:**  Action:
    *   **Accept:** Deliver the email normally.
    *   **Delay:** Hold the email and present the sender with a CAPTCHA or request further authentication.
    *   **Sandbox:** Deliver the email to a sandbox environment for deeper analysis.
    *   **Reject:** Block the email entirely.
    *   **Greylist:** Temporarily reject the email, requiring the sender to retry.

**4. Feedback Loop & Machine Learning:**

*   All actions (Accept, Delay, Reject) are logged.
*   Recipient feedback (e.g., marking as spam) is used to refine the Machine Learning models used for Risk Scoring and Anomaly Detection.
*   The system continuously learns and adapts to new threats and patterns.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function assessEmail(email):
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(email.content)
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(email.sender)
  combinedScore = (riskScore * weightRisk) + (anomalyScore * weightAnomaly)

  if combinedScore < thresholdLow:
    action = "Accept"
  else if combinedScore < thresholdMedium:
    action = "Delay" // Prompt for authentication
  else:
    action = "Reject"

  logAction(email.sender, action)
  return action
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   Integration with existing email security solutions (e.g., SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
*   Privacy-preserving mechanisms to avoid false positives.
*   Transparency for senders to understand why their emails are being delayed or rejected.
*   Support for whitelisting and blacklisting.
