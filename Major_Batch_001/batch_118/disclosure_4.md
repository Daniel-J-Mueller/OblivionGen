## Aerial Vehicle Swarm Coordination via Distributed Hash Table (DHT) & Predictive Collision Avoidance

**Concept:** Extend the hash-based path management to a fully distributed, peer-to-peer system leveraging a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). Instead of a central data store, each aerial vehicle maintains a partial view of the path data, contributing to a globally consistent map.  Supplement this with predictive collision avoidance calculations performed *locally* by each vehicle, broadcasting only *intentions* (predicted trajectories) – not complete path data – for conflict resolution.

**Specs:**

*   **DHT Implementation:** Utilize a DHT (e.g., Chord, Kademlia) to partition the airspace into virtual cells.  Each cell’s path data (hashed paths & associated data) is assigned to a set of vehicles responsible for maintaining that data fragment.
*   **Path Hashing:** Employ a cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or similar) to generate unique path identifiers.  The hash acts as the key in the DHT, locating the responsible vehicle(s) for that path.
*   **Path Data Structure:**  Each path entry stored within the DHT includes:
    *   `PathHash`: The unique identifier.
    *   `Timestamp`:  Time of path creation/modification.
    *   `PathPoints`: A sequence of 3D coordinates representing the path. (compressed representation preferred)
    *   `VelocityProfile`:  Vehicle speed over time.
    *   `VehicleID`: Identifier of the aerial vehicle.
*   **Intent Broadcasting:**  Each vehicle, at a defined frequency (e.g., 10Hz), broadcasts its *predicted* trajectory for the next X seconds (e.g., 5-10 seconds). This prediction is based on its current velocity, planned maneuvers, and goals. The broadcast includes:
    *   `VehicleID`
    *   `PredictedTrajectory`: A sequence of 3D coordinates representing the predicted path.
    *   `ConfidenceLevel`: A measure of the certainty of the prediction.
*   **Local Collision Avoidance:** Each vehicle performs collision detection and avoidance calculations *locally* based on the received intent broadcasts.
    *   **Threat Assessment:** Calculate the Time-To-Closest-Point-of-Approach (TCPA) and Distance-To-Closest-Point-of-Approach (DCPA) for each potentially conflicting vehicle.
    *   **Maneuver Planning:**  If a collision is predicted, plan a local maneuver (e.g., altitude adjustment, lateral deviation) to resolve the conflict.
    *   **Maneuver Broadcasting:**  Broadcast the planned maneuver (as a modification to the predicted trajectory) to neighboring vehicles.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Implement a consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure data consistency and fault tolerance within the DHT. This handles vehicle failures and ensures that all vehicles have access to the most up-to-date path information.
*   **Dynamic DHT Membership:**  Vehicles seamlessly join and leave the DHT without disrupting the system.  The DHT automatically rebalances the data distribution to accommodate changes in membership.
*   **Airspace Partitioning:** The airspace is divided into virtual cells, and each vehicle is responsible for maintaining the path data for its assigned cells. This partitioning helps to distribute the workload and improve scalability.

**Pseudocode (Local Collision Avoidance):**

```pseudocode
function processIntentBroadcast(intent):
  threatLevel = assessThreat(intent)
  if threatLevel > threshold:
    maneuver = planManeuver(intent)
    broadcastManeuver(maneuver)
    applyManeuver(maneuver)

function assessThreat(intent):
  # Calculate TCPA and DCPA
  # Based on TCPA and DCPA, assign a threat level (Low, Medium, High)
  return threatLevel

function planManeuver(intent):
  # Based on the predicted collision point, calculate a safe maneuver
  # (e.g., altitude adjustment, lateral deviation)
  return maneuver

function broadcastManeuver(maneuver):
  # Broadcast the planned maneuver to neighboring vehicles
  send broadcastMessage(maneuver)

function applyManeuver(maneuver):
  # Apply the planned maneuver to the vehicle's trajectory
  update trajectory(maneuver)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Scalability:**  DHT-based architecture scales well to a large number of aerial vehicles.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** DHT provides redundancy and resilience to vehicle failures.
*   **Reduced Communication Overhead:**  Only intentions (predicted trajectories) are broadcast, reducing communication bandwidth compared to sharing complete path data.
*   **Decentralization:** Eliminates the need for a central controller, improving system robustness.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** System adapts to changing airspace conditions and vehicle movements.
