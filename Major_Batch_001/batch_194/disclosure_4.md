## Adaptive Firewall Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the host-based firewall to not just enforce rules, but *adopt* behavioral personas based on observed traffic and customer-defined risk tolerance, creating a dynamic, self-modifying security profile. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Definitions:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Each Persona is defined by a weighted list of rule parameters.  Parameters include:
    *   `PortBlockWeight`: (Float 0.0-1.0) Weight assigned to blocking specific ports.
    *   `GeoBlockWeight`: (Float 0.0-1.0) Weight assigned to blocking traffic from specific geographic locations.
    *   `ApplicationBlockWeight`: (Float 0.0-1.0) Weight assigned to blocking specific applications.
    *   `TrafficShapingWeight`: (Float 0.0-1.0) Weight assigned to traffic shaping/rate limiting.
    *   `LoggingLevelWeight`: (Float 0.0-1.0)  Weight assigned to the level of logging detail.
    *   `AlertThresholdWeight`: (Float 0.0-1.0) Weight assigned to alert thresholds (higher = more sensitive).
*   **Predefined Personas:** System includes a library of pre-defined personas:
    *   `HighlySecure`:  High weights on all block parameters, strict logging, low alert thresholds.
    *   `Balanced`:  Moderate weights across parameters.
    *   `Permissive`: Low weights on block parameters, minimal logging, high alert thresholds.
    *   `Gaming`:  Prioritizes low latency for gaming-related ports/applications, relaxes some security restrictions.
    *   `Development`: Allows broad access for development tools, relaxed logging.
*   **Custom Persona Creation:** Customer interface allows creation of custom personas by adjusting the weights of each parameter.

**2. Behavioral Analysis Engine:**

*   **Traffic Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of network traffic patterns (source/destination IPs, ports, applications, data volume, frequency).
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) to identify anomalous traffic patterns.
*   **Persona Assignment:** Based on observed traffic and anomaly scores, the engine dynamically assigns a persona to the virtual machine instance.  A scoring function will combine anomaly scores with predefined persona profiles.
    *   `PersonaScore = (AnomalyScore * AnomalyWeight) + (ProfileSimilarityScore * ProfileWeight)`
    *   Where `AnomalyWeight` and `ProfileWeight` are configurable parameters.
*   **Persona Blending:** Allows blending of multiple personas based on traffic characteristics.  For example, 80% "Balanced" + 20% "Gaming" during peak gaming hours.

**3.  Adaptive Rule Generation:**

*   **Rule Prioritization:** Rules are prioritized based on the assigned persona.  Higher-weighted parameters in the persona receive greater emphasis.
*   **Dynamic Rule Creation:** New rules are generated dynamically based on observed traffic and persona preferences.
*   **Temporary Rule Overrides:**  Allows temporary overrides of rules based on specific events (e.g., known malicious IP address detected).
*   **Rule Feedback Loop:**  Tracks the effectiveness of generated rules and adjusts weights accordingly to improve accuracy.

**4. Customer Interface:**

*   **Persona Management:**  Ability to create, edit, and delete personas.
*   **Traffic Visualization:**  Real-time visualization of network traffic patterns.
*   **Anomaly Reporting:**  Detailed reports of detected anomalies.
*   **Rule Explanation:**  Explanation of why specific rules were generated and enforced.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:**  Ability to provide feedback on rule accuracy and effectiveness.

**Pseudocode Example (Persona Assignment):**

```
function assign_persona(traffic_data, customer_preferences):
  // Calculate anomaly score
  anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(traffic_data)

  // Calculate profile similarity score
  profile_similarity_score = calculate_profile_similarity_score(traffic_data, customer_preferences)

  // Calculate persona score for each persona
  for each persona in available_personas:
    persona_score = (anomaly_score * anomaly_weight) + (profile_similarity_score * profile_weight)
    persona_scores[persona] = persona_score

  // Select persona with highest score
  selected_persona = max(persona_scores, key=persona_scores.get)

  return selected_persona
```
