**Secure Session-Bound Data Streams with Dynamic Attestation**

**Concept:** Extend the patent’s session-binding approach beyond simple message verification to enable secure, dynamically attested data streams *within* an established cryptographically protected session. This allows for granular access control and tamper detection *during* data transmission, not just at the message level.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Stream Initiation:**
    *   Client and Server negotiate a Data Stream ID (DSID) after session establishment, but before any data transmission. This DSID is derived from a shared secret established during the initial handshake, plus a client-generated random nonce.
    *   The client sends a `STREAM_REQUEST` message, digitally signed with the session-independent key (as in the patent), containing the DSID and a description of the requested data stream (e.g., data type, access permissions).
    *   The server validates the signature and DSID. If valid, the server allocates resources for the stream and responds with a `STREAM_GRANT` message, also signed with the session-independent key.

2.  **Dynamic Attestation Tokens:**
    *   The server generates a short-lived, cryptographically signed Attestation Token (AT) for each data 'chunk' sent along the stream.
    *   The AT incorporates:
        *   DSID
        *   Chunk Sequence Number
        *   Timestamp
        *   Hash of the Chunk Data
        *   A server-side counter (incremented with each chunk)
    *   The AT is appended to each data chunk before transmission.

3.  **Client Verification & Re-Attestation:**
    *   The client receives the data chunk and AT.
    *   The client verifies the AT’s signature (using a server public key).
    *   The client recalculates the hash of the received data and compares it to the hash in the AT.
    *   The client verifies the chunk sequence number and timestamp for replay attack prevention.
    *   Periodically (e.g., every N chunks), the client *re-attests* to the server by sending a message containing the last received sequence number, timestamp, and a fresh nonce, signed with its session-independent key. This proves the client is still actively participating and hasn’t been hijacked.

4.  **Mitigation:**
    *   If any verification fails, the client discards the chunk and sends an `INVALID_CHUNK` message to the server (signed with its session-independent key).
    *   If the client fails to re-attest, the server terminates the data stream.
    *   If the server detects multiple `INVALID_CHUNK` messages from the client, it may temporarily or permanently block the client's access.

**Pseudocode (Client Side - Chunk Reception):**

```
function receiveChunk(chunk, attestationToken) {
  if (!verifySignature(attestationToken, serverPublicKey)) {
    log("Signature verification failed");
    sendInvalidChunkMessage(attestationToken);
    return;
  }

  if (!verifyHash(chunk, attestationToken)) {
    log("Hash verification failed");
    sendInvalidChunkMessage(attestationToken);
    return;
  }

  if (!verifySequenceAndTimestamp(attestationToken)) {
    log("Sequence/Timestamp verification failed");
    sendInvalidChunkMessage(attestationToken);
    return;
  }

  // Chunk is valid - process the data
  processData(chunk);

  // Periodic re-attestation
  if (chunkCount % REATTEST_INTERVAL == 0) {
    sendReAttestationMessage(lastSequenceNumber, timestamp, nonce);
  }
}
```

**Innovation:**  This builds upon the patent’s session-binding approach by extending it to *ongoing data streams*, providing a far more granular and robust security mechanism. The dynamic attestation tokens prevent tampering *during* transmission, while the periodic re-attestation verifies the ongoing legitimacy of the client.  This approach moves beyond simply verifying message origin to actively safeguarding the integrity of a continuous data flow.
