## Adaptive Secret Rotation via Decentralized Oracle Network

**Concept:** Extend the secret-holding proxy to utilize a decentralized oracle network for dynamically rotating the “recognized credential” used for signing instructions. This prevents credential compromise even with proxy breaches and introduces a layer of trustlessness.

**Specs:**

1.  **Credential Authority (CA) Contract:** A smart contract deployed on a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum). This contract manages the issuance and rotation of recognized credentials.
2.  **Oracle Network Integration:** Utilize a decentralized oracle network (e.g., Chainlink, Tellor) to periodically request a new, cryptographically-signed recognized credential from the CA Contract.  Frequency determined by policy (e.g. every hour, every 1000 requests, on a triggered event).
3.  **Proxy Modification:** The signing service (secret-holding proxy) is modified to:
    *   Retrieve the current recognized credential from the Oracle Network upon initialization and periodically thereafter.
    *   Cache the retrieved credential for performance.
    *   Use the cached credential for signing instructions.
    *   Implement a fault-tolerance mechanism: If the Oracle Network fails to provide a credential within a defined timeframe, revert to a previously-known good credential (with logging and alerting).
4.  **CA Contract Logic:**
    *   `issueCredential(policyID)`:  Issues a new, cryptographically-signed credential associated with a specific `policyID`.  The `policyID` determines the access permissions granted by the credential.
    *   `rotateCredential(policyID)`: Rotates the existing credential associated with a `policyID`, invalidating the previous one.
    *   `isValidCredential(policyID, credential)`: Returns `true` if the provided `credential` is valid for the given `policyID`, and `false` otherwise.
5.  **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Signing Service -> Oracle Network: Request for current credential for `policyID`.
    *   Oracle Network -> Signing Service:  Response containing the current, valid credential for `policyID` (signed by the CA Contract).
6.  **Policy Enforcement:** The `policyID` associated with the credential determines the resource the client is permitted to access. This ties the credential rotation to specific access rights.

**Pseudocode (Signing Service):**

```
FUNCTION signRequest(clientRequest):
  policyID = extractPolicyID(clientRequest)
  credential = getCredential(policyID) // attempts to retrieve from cache, falls back to Oracle
  IF credential == NULL:
    log("Oracle Network Failure - Using last known good credential")
    credential = getLastKnownGoodCredential() // fallback, log error
  signedInstructions = sign(clientRequest, credential)
  removeClientSignature(clientRequest) // Remove interim credential signature
  return signedInstructions

FUNCTION getCredential(policyID):
  IF credentialCache.contains(policyID):
    return credentialCache.get(policyID)
  ELSE:
    oracleResponse = requestCredentialFromOracle(policyID)
    IF oracleResponse.success:
      credential = oracleResponse.credential
      credentialCache.put(policyID, credential)
      return credential
    ELSE:
      log("Oracle Network Failure")
      return NULL

FUNCTION requestCredentialFromOracle(policyID):
  // Send request to Oracle Network
  response = OracleNetwork.requestCredential(policyID)
  // Verify signature of response from CA Contract
  IF Crypto.verifySignature(response.credential, CA_Contract_Address, response.signature):
    return response
  ELSE:
    return {success: false, error: "Signature verification failed"}
```

**Novelty:** This adaptation introduces a dynamic, trustless credential rotation mechanism that enhances security beyond the standard proxy-based authentication. It mitigates risks associated with long-lived credentials and potential proxy compromises. The use of a decentralized oracle network adds a layer of transparency and auditability.
