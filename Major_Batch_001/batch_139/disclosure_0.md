## Dynamic Task Decomposition & Predictive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend the voice-activated instruction following to *proactively* break down complex tasks into sub-tasks, predict potential user errors *before* they happen, and offer preemptive assistance, all layered on top of the existing instruction list framework.  Rather than simply following instructions, the system becomes a collaborative co-pilot for task completion.

**System Specs:**

*   **Task Graph Builder:** A module that analyzes the instruction list (e.g., a recipe, repair manual, project guide) and automatically constructs a dependency graph. Nodes represent individual steps, and edges represent dependencies (e.g., “mix ingredients” depends on “gather ingredients”). This can utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer implicit dependencies.
*   **Predictive Error Engine:**  This module monitors user actions (voice commands, IoT device states) in real-time and compares them against the task graph.  It uses a Bayesian network or similar probabilistic model to estimate the probability of errors at each step. Factors influencing error probability include:
    *   User skill level (inferred from past performance).
    *   Step complexity.
    *   IoT device status (e.g., low battery, connection issues).
    *   Environmental factors (e.g., poor lighting, background noise).
*   **Proactive Assistance Module:** Based on the Predictive Error Engine’s output, this module offers preemptive assistance.  Assistance types:
    *   **Voice prompts:** “You’re about to start step 3, which requires precise measurements. Double-check your units.”
    *   **IoT device control:**  If a tool is needed, automatically activate it (e.g., turn on a blender).
    *   **Augmented Reality (AR) overlays:** Project visual guidance onto the user’s environment (e.g., highlight the correct wire to connect).
    *   **Conditional Sub-task Injection:** If a high probability of error is detected, automatically inject a simpler sub-task.  Example: Instead of "Solder these two wires together", suggest "Practice soldering on a scrap piece of wire first".
*   **Dynamic Instruction Revision:** Based on error detection and user feedback, the system can automatically revise the instruction list, adding clarifying steps or reordering them for optimal flow.
*   **User Skill Profiling:** Maintain a user profile that tracks their performance on various tasks. This data is used to refine the Predictive Error Engine and personalize the assistance provided.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Task Initiation
user_utterance = receive_voice_command()
instruction_list = retrieve_instructions(user_utterance)
task_graph = build_task_graph(instruction_list)
user_profile = load_user_profile()

// Main Loop
current_step = task_graph.start_node
while current_step != task_graph.end_node:
    error_probability = predictive_error_engine.calculate_error_probability(current_step, user_profile)
    if error_probability > threshold:
        assistance_type = proactive_assistance_module.determine_assistance_type(current_step, user_profile)
        proactive_assistance_module.deliver_assistance(assistance_type)

    user_action = receive_user_action()  // Voice command, IoT device state change
    task_graph.update_progress(user_action)
    current_step = task_graph.next_step()

// Task Completion
output_completion_message()
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Voice-activated electronic device (e.g., smart speaker, smartphone).
*   IoT devices with network connectivity.
*   AR-capable device (e.g., smartphone, smart glasses).
*   Cloud-based server for task graph storage, error probability calculation, and LLM inference.
*   Machine learning models for error prediction and user skill profiling.
