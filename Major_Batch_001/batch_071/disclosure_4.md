## Haptic Checkout Confirmation & Dynamic Barcode Generation

**System Specs:** Mobile computing device (smartphone or tablet) with integrated haptic engine, front-facing camera, microphone, and wireless communication capabilities. Cloud-based secure key exchange & item database.

**Innovation Description:** This system aims to enhance the checkout experience by replacing the audio 'beep' with nuanced haptic feedback, and by *dynamically* generating barcodes/machine-readable identifiers on the device’s screen *after* successful item verification. It also incorporates a ‘confidence score’ linked to each verification.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initiation:** User launches the checkout application and begins scanning (or selecting) items. The application accesses a list of items (local or remote).
2.  **Barcode/Identifier Display:** The application displays a barcode/machine-readable identifier on the device’s screen.
3.  **Verification Process:** 
    *   The microphone actively listens for the register ‘beep’ as before.  
    *   Simultaneously, the front-facing camera analyzes the register for visual confirmation – specifically, a red laser scan line or similar visual cue.  
    *   The system calculates a ‘confidence score’ based on *both* the audio and visual confirmations. (Audio weight: 60%, Visual weight: 40% – adjustable).
4.  **Haptic Feedback:** Upon reaching a threshold confidence score (e.g., 90%), the device delivers a *distinct* haptic pattern – not just a simple vibration. Different patterns could indicate:
    *   Successful verification: A short, crisp ‘pulse’.
    *   Low confidence (needs re-scan): A longer, wavering vibration.
    *   Error (item not found): A series of rapid taps.
5.  **Dynamic Identifier Update:** *After* successful verification (confirmed by haptic feedback), the displayed barcode/identifier is *replaced* with a *new*, dynamically generated identifier. This new identifier is unique to that transaction and that item, tied to a secure session key.
6.  **Transaction Security:** The dynamic identifiers are short-lived and expire after a brief period. This mitigates the risk of barcode spoofing or reuse.
7.  **Checkout Completion:** The system tracks all verified items and their associated dynamic identifiers.  Upon reaching the end of the list, the transaction is considered complete.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
itemList = loadItemList()
sessionKey = generateSessionKey()
displayBarcode(itemList[currentItemIndex], sessionKey)

// Main Loop
while (currentItemIndex < itemList.length) {
  audioSignal = captureAudio()
  visualSignal = captureVisual()
  confidenceScore = calculateConfidence(audioSignal, visualSignal)

  if (confidenceScore > threshold) {
    hapticEngine.playPattern("success")
    dynamicIdentifier = generateDynamicIdentifier(itemList[currentItemIndex], sessionKey)
    displayDynamicIdentifier(dynamicIdentifier)
    currentItemIndex++
  } else {
    hapticEngine.playPattern("lowConfidence")
  }
}

// Transaction Complete
transactionComplete()
```
