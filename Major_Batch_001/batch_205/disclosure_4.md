## Dynamic Acoustic Feature Weighting Based on Predicted Word Confidence

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of dynamically adjusting prior probabilities to influence speech recognition confidence scores, but instead of focusing solely on word frequency or group statistics, *directly modulate acoustic features* during the ASR process based on the predicted confidence of hypothesized words. This creates a feedback loop where higher-confidence hypotheses reinforce the acoustic signals supporting them, and vice versa.

**Specifications:**

**1. Feature Extraction Module Enhancement:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio data, initial acoustic feature vectors (e.g., MFCCs, Filterbanks).
*   **Process:**
    *   During initial ASR processing, maintain a running confidence score for each hypothesized word/phoneme at each time step. This utilizes the existing confidence estimation mechanisms (as in the provided patent – leverages prior probabilities, language models etc.).
    *   Introduce a ‘confidence weighting factor’ (CWF) for each acoustic feature.  Initially, all CWFs are set to 1.0.
    *   Apply the CWF to each corresponding acoustic feature.  Feature Value’ = Feature Value * CWF
*   **Output:** Weighted acoustic feature vectors.

**2. Confidence Weighting Factor (CWF) Adjustment:**

*   **Input:** Confidence score of hypothesized word/phoneme, CWF for the corresponding acoustic features.
*   **Process:**
    *   Define a dynamic adjustment function. Pseudocode:

```
function adjustCWF(confidence_score, current_CWF, learning_rate):
  if confidence_score > threshold:
    new_CWF = current_CWF * (1 + learning_rate)
  elif confidence_score < threshold:
    new_CWF = current_CWF * (1 - learning_rate)
  else:
    new_CWF = current_CWF
  
  # Clamp CWF to prevent extreme values
  new_CWF = max(0.1, min(10.0, new_CWF)) 
  return new_CWF
```

    *   ‘threshold’ controls the sensitivity to confidence changes.
    *   ‘learning_rate’ governs the speed of adjustment.
*   **Output:** Updated CWF.

**3. ASR Engine Integration:**

*   Integrate the Feature Extraction Module Enhancement into the existing ASR pipeline.
*   The ASR engine processes the weighted acoustic features.
*   The confidence scores generated by the ASR engine are fed back to the CWF Adjustment module.

**4. System Parameters:**

*   *Threshold*: Adjustable parameter (default = 0.7)
*   *Learning Rate*: Adjustable parameter (default = 0.05)
*   *Minimum CWF*: 0.1
*   *Maximum CWF*: 10.0
*   *Feature Set*:  Specify which acoustic features are subject to weighting (e.g., all MFCCs, or a selected subset).

**Novelty:**

This approach differs from the provided patent by *directly influencing the acoustic signal* based on prediction confidence. It’s not merely adjusting prior probabilities, but shaping the input to the ASR engine itself. It creates a closed-loop system where confident predictions amplify the supporting acoustic evidence. This potentially improves robustness to noise and accents, and enhances recognition accuracy. The adjustable parameters allow for fine-tuning the system’s sensitivity and responsiveness.
