## Dynamic Intent Refinement via Multi-Modal Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend the incremental semantic processing to incorporate real-time visual data as an 'anchor' for intent refinement, enhancing stability and reducing ambiguity, particularly in noisy environments or with complex requests.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:**  Integrate a camera module providing a live video stream alongside the audio input.
*   **Visual Feature Extraction:** Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to identify salient objects, actions, or scenes within the video stream.  Output: Vector representing visual features (e.g., object detection bounding boxes, action classifications, scene labels).
*   **Intent Fusion Module:**  A dedicated neural network layer combining the semantic representation from the incremental speech recognition (as described in the source patent) with the visual feature vector.  This module learns to weight the contributions of each modality based on context and confidence levels.
*   **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm that adjusts the weighting of the audio and visual modalities based on:
    *   **Confidence Scores:**  Lower confidence in speech recognition (due to noise or ambiguity) increases the weight of the visual input.
    *   **Contextual Relevance:**  If the detected visual scene strongly correlates with potential intents (e.g., a kitchen scene suggests food-related intents), the visual weight is increased.
    *   **Temporal Consistency:**  Track changes in visual features over time. Stable visual features reinforce the current intent, while rapid changes indicate potential ambiguity.

**2.  Data Flow & Processing:**

1.  **Audio Input:**  Audio data is partitioned and processed as per the original patent. Incremental speech recognition results are generated.
2.  **Visual Input:**  Live video stream is analyzed to extract visual features.
3.  **Initial Intent Estimation:**  Initial semantic representation is generated based *solely* on early audio input.
4.  **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Visual feature vector is fed into the Intent Fusion Module alongside the initial semantic representation.  The module generates a *refined* semantic representation.
5.  **Stability Score Calculation:** Calculate a stability score comparing the refined semantic representation to the initial one.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Based on the stability score, confidence levels, and contextual relevance, adjust the weighting of the audio and visual modalities in the Intent Fusion Module.
7.  **Iterative Refinement:** Steps 4-6 are repeated iteratively as more audio and visual data become available.
8. **Output**:  The most stable and confident semantic representation is used to determine user intent and initiate appropriate actions.

**3. Pseudocode (Intent Fusion Module):**

```
function fuse_intent(audio_semantic_vector, visual_feature_vector, audio_confidence, visual_relevance, weights):
  # weights = [audio_weight, visual_weight]
  # Ensure weights sum to 1
  normalized_audio_weight = weights[0]
  normalized_visual_weight = weights[1]

  fused_vector = (normalized_audio_weight * audio_semantic_vector) + (normalized_visual_weight * visual_feature_vector)
  return fused_vector

function calculate_weights(audio_confidence, visual_relevance, stability_score):
  # Base weights (can be tuned)
  audio_weight = 0.6
  visual_weight = 0.4

  # Adjust weights based on confidence & relevance
  audio_weight += audio_confidence * 0.2
  visual_weight += visual_relevance * 0.2

  # Adjust weights based on stability (higher stability -> less visual weighting)
  visual_weight -= (1 - stability_score) * 0.1

  # Normalize weights
  total_weight = audio_weight + visual_weight
  audio_weight /= total_weight
  visual_weight /= total_weight

  return [audio_weight, visual_weight]
```

**4.  Example Use Case:**

User says "Set a timer for... " while looking at a pot on the stove. 

*   Early audio input suggests a timer-related intent.
*   Visual input detects the pot on the stove, strongly correlating with cooking.
*   The system *prioritizes* the cooking context and infers the user intends to set a timer for cooking, even if the audio is slightly unclear.
