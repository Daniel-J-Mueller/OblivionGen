## Dynamic Port-Based Session Steering with Predictive Load Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the port-based address mapping to include *predictive* load balancing, anticipating shifts in server load *before* they impact performance. Instead of merely reacting to current load, proactively steer sessions to servers predicted to have capacity.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Load Prediction Engine (LPE):**  An AI/ML model trained on historical traffic patterns, server resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O), and application-specific metrics.  The LPE generates short-term (e.g., 5-15 second) load predictions for each server within the load balancing pool. Output: a 'Capacity Score' (0-100) for each server.
*   **Dynamic Port Allocation Manager (DPAM):**  A module residing on the ingress host. It maintains a mapping between remote client IP addresses *and* a dynamically assigned range of ports. This goes beyond the 1:1 port-address mapping in the base patent.
*   **Session Steering Algorithm (SSA):**  The core logic for directing traffic. It factors in both current server load *and* the Capacity Score from the LPE.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Server performance data (latency, error rates) is continuously fed back to the LPE to refine its predictions.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Connection:** A remote client connects to the ingress host.
2.  **Client Identification:**  The ingress host identifies the client (IP address).
3.  **Port Range Allocation:** DPAM allocates a range of ports to the client.  The size of the range is configurable.
4.  **Session Establishment:** The client initiates a session.
5.  **Server Selection:** SSA evaluates candidate servers based on:
    *   Current Load (as reported by the servers).
    *   Capacity Score (from LPE).
    *   Port Availability (within the allocated range). Servers with more available ports within the client's allocated range are favored.
6.  **Port Assignment:** A specific port within the allocated range is assigned to the session. This port is associated with the selected server.
7.  **Traffic Steering:**  All subsequent packets for that session are directed to the assigned server based on the assigned port.
8.  **Performance Monitoring:**  Server performance metrics are collected and fed back to the LPE for continuous learning.

**III. Pseudocode (SSA - Server Selection Algorithm):**

```
function selectServer(clientID, requestedPort):
  servers = getAvailableServers()  // Get list of servers in the pool

  bestServer = null
  bestScore = -1

  for each server in servers:
    currentLoad = getServerLoad(server)
    capacityScore = getCapacityScore(server)
    portAvailability = checkPortAvailability(server, requestedPort)

    // Weighted scoring (weights configurable)
    score = (0.4 * (1 - currentLoad)) + (0.5 * (capacityScore / 100)) + (0.1 * portAvailability)

    if score > bestScore:
      bestScore = score
      bestServer = server

  return bestServer
```

**IV. Configuration Parameters:**

*   `PortRangeSize`:  Number of ports allocated per client.
*   `PredictionHorizon`:  Time horizon for load predictions (e.g., 10 seconds).
*   `Weight_CurrentLoad`:  Weight assigned to current server load in the scoring function.
*   `Weight_CapacityScore`: Weight assigned to the LPE capacity score.
*   `Weight_PortAvailability`: Weight assigned to port availability.
*   `LPE_ModelPath`: Path to the trained Load Prediction Engine model.

**V. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Adaptive Port Range Size:** Dynamically adjust the `PortRangeSize` based on client behavior and predicted session duration.
*   **Geographic Load Balancing:** Factor in server location to minimize latency.
*   **Application-Aware Steering:** Consider application-specific requirements when selecting a server.
