## Personalized Sound Bubbles with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend targeted sound zone control to create truly *personalized* audio experiences, adapting not just to location, but to the listener's physiological state.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a non-invasive biofeedback sensor array into a wearable (headband, glasses, or integrated into seating). Sensors include:
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) – to detect brainwave activity (alpha, beta, theta, delta bands).
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) – to measure heart rate variability (HRV).
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) – to measure skin conductance (emotional arousal).
    *   Eye Tracking – to determine focus and cognitive load.
*   **Real-time Data Processing:** An onboard processor (or connection to external processing unit) analyzes sensor data in real-time. Algorithms classify the listener's cognitive/emotional state (e.g., relaxed, focused, stressed, creative).
*   **Dynamic Filter Coefficient Adjustment:**  The core innovation is mapping detected states to adjustments in the filter coefficients controlling the loudspeaker array. For example:
    *   *Relaxation State (High Alpha Waves, Low HRV):* Increase bass frequencies, widen sound zone, reduce directional emphasis, subtly introduce binaural beats or pink noise.
    *   *Focused State (High Beta Waves, Low HRV):* Sharpen sound zone, emphasize frequencies relevant to the task (e.g., speech frequencies), reduce ambient noise, increase sound pressure in the target area.
    *   *Creative State (High Alpha/Theta Waves, Moderate HRV):*  Introduce subtle spatial audio effects, expand sound zone, introduce unexpected sound textures, increase stereo width.
    *   *Stress/Anxiety (High GSR, Elevated HRV):* Lower overall volume, introduce calming ambient sounds (nature sounds, white noise), narrow sound zone to minimize external distraction.
*   **Personalized Profiles:** Allow users to create and save personalized profiles based on their preferred audio settings for different states. Machine learning can refine these profiles over time.
*   **Sound Source Adaptation:** The system should be able to adapt filter coefficients for multiple audio sources simultaneously. For instance, emphasizing speech from a specific direction while suppressing ambient noise.
*   **Loudspeaker Array Integration:** The system will leverage an existing or dedicated loudspeaker array capable of precise beamforming and spatial audio control.
*   **Software Interface:** A companion app for managing profiles, calibrating sensors, and adjusting system settings.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
loop:
    sensorData = readSensorData()
    state = analyzeState(sensorData) // Classify cognitive/emotional state
    filterCoefficients = generateFilterCoefficients(state, userProfile)
    applyFilterCoefficients(filterCoefficients, loudspeakerArray)
    playAudio(audioSources, loudspeakerArray)
    delay(0.05) // 50ms update rate
end loop
```

**Novelty:** The current patent focuses on spatial audio control. This expands it by adding *biometric* feedback to dynamically personalize the listening experience. It moves beyond simply directing sound to actively shaping it *based on the listener’s internal state*, creating a responsive auditory environment. This has potential in applications like therapeutic soundscapes, productivity enhancement, and immersive entertainment.
