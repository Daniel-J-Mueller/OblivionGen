## Personalized Auditory Scenes

**Concept:** Expand the user presence detection beyond simple notification delivery to create dynamically adjusted auditory scenes, layering ambient sounds and targeted audio cues based on user location *within* a space, and predicted activity.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a dense network of microphone/speaker nodes (similar to Sonos, but more granular), plus existing user devices (phones, smartwatches). Nodes should incorporate environmental sensors (temperature, light, motion).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Presence Engine:** Enhanced version of the existing system, tracking user location with sub-meter accuracy using triangulation of signals from user devices & microphone array data.  Includes activity prediction (based on historical data, calendar entries, and real-time sensor input).
    *   **Soundscape Generator:** Procedurally generates ambient soundscapes (e.g., coffee shop, forest, city park) based on user-defined preferences and predicted activity.  Soundscape complexity and content adjust dynamically.
    *   **Targeted Audio Cue Engine:**  Layered on top of the soundscape.  Delivers localized audio cues (e.g., reminder chime, turn-by-turn navigation, appliance status) directly to the user's perceived location within the space.  Uses spatial audio techniques for realistic sound placement.
    *   **User Profile/Preference Manager:**  Stores user preferences for soundscapes, audio cue types, and personalization settings. Learns user behavior over time to optimize the experience.
*   **Pseudocode - Core Loop (executed on a central server/hub):**

```
LOOP:
    user_locations = PresenceEngine.getUserLocations() // Returns a dictionary of user IDs and their 3D coordinates
    FOR EACH user_id, location IN user_locations:
        activity = PresenceEngine.predictActivity(user_id, location)
        soundscape = SoundscapeGenerator.generate(user_id, activity)
        audio_cues = TargetedAudioCueEngine.generate(user_id, location, activity)
        
        FOR EACH cue IN audio_cues:
            cue.position = location // Set the 3D position of the audio cue
            send_audio_to_nodes(cue) // Transmit the cue to the nearest microphone/speaker nodes
        
        send_soundscape_to_nodes(soundscape) // Stream the soundscape to the nodes
    
    WAIT(0.1 seconds) // Update rate
```

*   **Node Functionality:**
    *   Receives audio streams (soundscapes, cues) from the central server.
    *   Performs localized audio processing (EQ, reverb) to optimize sound quality.
    *   Utilizes beamforming and spatial audio techniques to create realistic sound placement.
    *   Captures environmental audio for ambient mixing.
*   **Example Scenario:**  User is in the kitchen, preparing coffee. The system generates a "cozy kitchen" soundscape (gentle background music, sizzling sounds).  A reminder chime for an upcoming meeting is localized to the area near the coffee machine. The system detects that the user is now moving towards the living room, seamlessly transitioning the soundscape to a "relaxed living room" ambience, and moving the audio cues accordingly.
*   **Scalability:** Modular design allows for easy expansion of the node network and addition of new features.
*   **Power Considerations:** Nodes should utilize low-power wireless communication protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy) to minimize energy consumption.
