## Dynamic Interior Illumination & Projection System

**Concept:** Expand the mirror functionality to create a dynamic internal illumination and projection system within the assembly. Instead of simply redirecting ambient light, integrate micro-projectors and diffusers alongside movable mirrors to display information *inside* the enclosed space.

**Specifications:**

*   **Mirror Array:** Replace the single movable mirror with an array of miniature, individually-controlled mirrors. Each mirror is mounted on a micro-servo system allowing for precise angular control (pitch, yaw, roll). The array should cover a significant portion of the exterior surface opposing the interior space.
*   **Micro-Projector Integration:** Embed a set of low-power, high-resolution micro-projectors behind the mirror array. These projectors are paired with the mirrors. Each projector’s output is directed onto its corresponding mirror.
*   **Diffuser Panels:** Line the interior walls (specifically the semi-transparent sidewalls) with thin, electronically-controlled diffuser panels. These panels can dynamically adjust their transparency/diffusion level.
*   **Control System:** Implement a central processing unit (CPU) responsible for coordinating the mirror array, micro-projectors, and diffuser panels. The CPU accepts input data (images, video, text, sensor data) and translates it into control signals for the hardware.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a suite of sensors:
    *   Ambient light sensor (exterior)
    *   Internal light sensor
    *   Motion sensor (detects movement within the enclosed space)
    *   Optional: Camera (for object recognition/tracking)
*   **Power:** Utilize a low-voltage DC power supply. Consider incorporating a rechargeable battery for portable operation.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **Ambient Light Augmentation:** Mirrors redirect ambient light, similar to the original patent, but with finer control.
2.  **Dynamic Illumination:** Micro-projectors beam light onto mirrors, which then scatter/direct it within the enclosed space. This enables creation of custom lighting schemes (e.g., color washes, patterns, animated effects).
3.  **Internal Projection:** Project images/video onto the interior walls via mirrors. Diffuser panels control the image’s brightness, contrast, and focus. The projected imagery can be static or dynamic.
4.  **Interactive Display:** Integrate the motion sensor to enable touch-less interaction with the projected imagery. The system responds to user gestures/movements.
5. **Data Overlay:** Overlay sensor data (e.g. temperature, humidity) onto the projected imagery, creating an augmented reality effect.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
loop:
    read sensor data (ambient light, motion, internal light)
    if motion detected:
        calculate interaction response
    if new data received:
        generate projection data (image/video/text)
    calculate mirror angles for each projector (based on projection data, sensor data)
    set mirror angles
    adjust diffuser panel transparency
    repeat
```

**Materials:**

*   Frame: Lightweight aluminum alloy
*   Sidewalls: Semi-transparent acrylic or polycarbonate with integrated diffuser panels.
*   Mirrors: High-reflectivity, low-distortion mirrors.
*   Micro-Projectors: DLP or LCoS micro-projectors.
*   Electronics: Miniaturized CPU, sensors, servo motors, power supply.
