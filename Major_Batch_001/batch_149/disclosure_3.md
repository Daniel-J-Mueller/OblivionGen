## Dynamic File Contextualization & Predictive Sharing

**Core Concept:** Extend file sharing beyond simple access controls & deadlines by layering contextual information *into* the shared file itself, dynamically updating based on recipient interaction and predicted needs.

**Specification:**

1.  **File Metadata Enrichment:** Upon initiating a share (via the existing messaging interface), the system analyzes the file content (text, images, code, etc.) using onboard AI. This analysis generates a structured metadata layer associated *with* the file.  This isn't just tags; it's semantic understanding – identifying key entities, concepts, tasks, questions likely to arise.

2.  **Recipient Profile Integration:** Each recipient has a profile within the system. This profile stores interaction history (previous shared files, search queries within the messaging app, role within the organization, project affiliations) and, crucially, *predicted information needs*. This prediction engine uses collaborative filtering and content-based recommendations.

3.  **Dynamic File Overlay:** A non-destructive "overlay" is created *on top* of the shared file. This overlay presents contextual information to the recipient, pulled from the enriched metadata *and* the recipient’s profile.

    *   **Example:** Sharing a code file. The overlay might highlight sections relevant to the recipient’s current project, display relevant documentation snippets, or proactively suggest debugging steps based on known code patterns and recipient skill level.
    *   **Display Modes:** User selectable: Minimal (just basic context), Standard (detailed explanations), Expert (developer-focused tooling).

4.  **Interactive Contextual Prompts:** The overlay isn't static. It presents interactive prompts.

    *   **"Do you need help with X?"** (where X is a task or concept from the file).
    *   **"Related documentation available"** (link to relevant resources).
    *   **"Known issues with this code section"** (display bug reports or workarounds).

5.  **Contextual Sharing Extension:** Allow the sender to *add* custom contextual information before sharing – notes, questions, specific instructions tied to sections of the file.  These are displayed within the overlay.

6.  **AI-Driven Overlay Updates:** The AI continuously analyzes recipient interaction with the file.  If a recipient spends a long time on a specific section, the overlay proactively provides more detailed explanations or related resources. If the recipient searches for information related to the file, the overlay surfaces relevant context.

**Pseudocode (Overlay Generation):**

```
function generateOverlay(file, recipient):
  metadata = analyzeFile(file)
  recipientProfile = getRecipientProfile(recipient)
  predictedNeeds = predictInformationNeeds(metadata, recipientProfile)
  overlay = createOverlay(metadata, predictedNeeds)
  addCustomContext(overlay, file.senderNotes)
  return overlay
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Server-side AI processing (NLP, machine learning).
*   Client-side overlay rendering engine (compatible with various file formats).
*   Secure data storage for recipient profiles.
*   API integration with messaging client.
*   Robust version control for overlays (to handle file updates).
