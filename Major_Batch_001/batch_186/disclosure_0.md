## Adaptive Transaction Shaping with Predictive Queueing

**Concept:** Extend the existing load testing framework to not just *react* to accumulating work, but to *predict* it, and proactively shape transaction types to optimize resource utilization *before* bottlenecks occur. This moves beyond simply increasing/decreasing transaction *rate* to influencing the *mix* of transactions being sent.

**Specifications:**

**1. Transaction Profile Definitions:**

*   A configuration file (JSON/YAML) will define transaction profiles. Each profile consists of:
    *   `name`: Unique identifier.
    *   `complexity`: Integer representing estimated resource consumption (CPU, memory, I/O). Scale 1-10.
    *   `dependencies`: List of other transaction profiles that must complete successfully before this one can begin.
    *   `weight`: Initial percentage allocation for this profile in the load test.
*   Example:

```json
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "ReadItem",
      "complexity": 2,
      "dependencies": [],
      "weight": 50
    },
    {
      "name": "WriteItem",
      "complexity": 7,
      "dependencies": ["ReadItem"],
      "weight": 20
    },
    {
      "name": "ComplexReport",
      "complexity": 10,
      "dependencies": ["ReadItem", "WriteItem"],
      "weight": 10
    },
    {
      "name": "BackgroundProcess",
      "complexity": 3,
      "dependencies": [],
      "weight": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Predictive Modeling Component:**

*   A time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) will be integrated.
*   Model Input: Historical work accumulation data (from the existing patent's work accumulation points – queues, workflows, etc.). Also, data regarding transaction profile complexity and dependencies.
*   Model Output: Predicted work accumulation at each point, *n* seconds into the future.
*   The model will be trained *during* the initial phase of the load test (a ‘learning phase’ of ~60-120 seconds).

**3. Transaction Shaping Algorithm:**

*   The core of the innovation.  This algorithm dynamically adjusts the transaction mix based on predictions.
*   Pseudocode:

```
function adjustTransactionMix(predictedWork, currentMix, targetUtilization):
  for each transactionProfile in transactionProfiles:
    predictedImpact = predictedWork * transactionProfile.complexity * transactionProfile.weight
    
    if predictedImpact > targetUtilization:
      decrease transactionProfile.weight by delta
    else if predictedImpact < targetUtilization:
      increase transactionProfile.weight by delta
    
  normalizeWeights() //Ensure weights sum to 100%
  return newMix
```

*   `targetUtilization` is a configurable parameter (e.g., 80% of capacity).
*   `delta` is a small adjustment value (e.g., 1%).

**4. Integration with Load Testing Framework:**

*   The predictive modeling component and transaction shaping algorithm will be integrated into the existing load test framework as a new module.
*   The framework will execute the load test using the dynamically adjusted transaction mix.
*   The framework will collect data on response times, error rates, and resource utilization.

**5.  ‘Chaos Injection’ for Model Robustness:**

*   Introduce controlled ‘chaos’ (e.g., simulated network latency, random transaction failures) during the learning phase to make the predictive model more robust to real-world conditions. This will prevent overly sensitive or optimistic predictions.

**Output Data:**

*   Historical data of transaction mix, predicted work accumulation, actual work accumulation, and system performance metrics.
*   A visualization tool to display the dynamic adjustment of the transaction mix and its impact on system performance.
