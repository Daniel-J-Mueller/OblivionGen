## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction for Personalized Audio Bubbles

**Concept:** Leverage multi-microphone array data and spatial audio processing to reconstruct a 3D acoustic map of the user's environment in real-time.  This map will not just identify noise sources, but *model* the reflections and diffusion of sound within the space, creating a personalized 'audio bubble' where audio is optimized for clarity and immersion while minimizing distractions. This goes beyond simple noise cancellation; it's about proactive soundscape *shaping*.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum 8-microphone circular array (radius ~15cm).  Microphones must have a frequency response spanning 20Hz – 20kHz with a signal-to-noise ratio >65dB.
    *   Dedicated edge TPU/NPU for real-time processing (minimum 8 TOPS).
    *   High-bandwidth audio output (minimum 24bit/96kHz capable) for headphone/earbud connectivity.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Beamforming & Sound Source Localization:** Advanced beamforming algorithms (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, MVDR) to identify and localize individual sound sources (speech, music, environmental noise) within a ~5m radius. Accuracy: +/- 5 degrees.
    *   **Acoustic Ray Tracing Engine:**  A lightweight, real-time ray tracing engine adapted for audio. This engine will model sound propagation, reflections (early & late), and diffusion based on environmental geometry (estimated via onboard cameras or pre-mapped spaces). Simplified room models will be sufficient to maintain real-time performance.
    *   **Personalized HRTF Database:**  A database of Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) customized to the user's unique head and ear anatomy (obtained via initial calibration or AI-driven reconstruction from camera data).
    *   **Adaptive Audio Processing Pipeline:** A pipeline that dynamically adjusts gain, equalization, and spatialization based on the reconstructed acoustic scene and user preferences.  Algorithms include:
        *   **Source Separation:**  AI-powered source separation to isolate desired audio streams (e.g., user's voice during a call) from background noise.
        *   **Dynamic Noise Shaping:** Noise cancellation algorithm that intelligently modifies the noise cancellation profile based on the identified noise sources and their spatial relationship to the user.
        *   **Spatial Audio Rendering:** Rendering of audio sources in 3D space using HRTF-based spatialization, creating a realistic and immersive audio experience.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Calibrate HRTF database based on user profile
Load pre-mapped environment data (if available) or initiate environment scanning

// Real-time Processing Loop
Capture audio data from microphone array
Perform beamforming and sound source localization
Build 3D acoustic map (identify sources, location, intensity)
If environment data unavailable, scan environment using onboard cameras/sensors
Run ray tracing engine to model sound propagation and reflections
Calculate desired audio output based on acoustic map and user preferences
Apply adaptive audio processing pipeline:
  Source separation
  Dynamic noise shaping
  Spatial audio rendering
Output audio to headphones/earbuds
```

*   **Novelty:** Existing noise cancellation solutions focus on *reducing* noise. This system *reconstructs* the acoustic environment and proactively *shapes* the soundscape to optimize the audio experience.  The integration of ray tracing and personalized HRTFs provides a level of realism and immersion that is not possible with traditional solutions. This creates a highly customizable and adaptive ‘audio bubble’ around the user.
*   **Potential Applications:**  Immersive VR/AR experiences, enhanced teleconferencing, personalized music listening, improved accessibility for hearing impaired individuals, creating quiet zones in noisy environments.
