## Autonomous Interior Mapping & Relocation System

**Concept:** Expand the intermediary device's awareness beyond access control to include persistent, detailed interior mapping and object relocation. The system creates a dynamic 3D model of the home interior, tracking the location of items and assisting with tasks like finding lost objects, monitoring inventory, or even aiding in emergency situations.

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Unit:** Existing intermediary device hardware repurposed/enhanced.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   LiDAR Module: Short-range LiDAR for accurate distance measurement and 3D environment mapping. (Range: 10m, Accuracy: +/- 2cm)
    *   RGB-D Camera: Captures color and depth data, enabling object recognition and scene understanding. (Resolution: 1920x1080, Depth Range: 0.5m - 8m)
    *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit): Provides orientation and motion data for precise localization and mapping.
    *   Array of Ultrasonic Sensors: Complement LiDAR/RGB-D for close-range obstacle detection.
*   **Processing Unit:** Onboard edge computing capable of real-time data processing, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and object recognition. (Processor: NVIDIA Jetson Nano or equivalent)
*   **Data Storage:** Internal SSD (512GB) for storing map data, object models, and historical data.
*   **Communication:** Wireless Fidelity (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac) for connection to home network and cloud services. Bluetooth 5.0 for connection to other smart devices.
*   **Power:** Existing power source + supplemental battery for extended operation during power outages.
*   **Software:**
    *   SLAM Algorithm: Robust SLAM algorithm (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS-Mono) for generating and updating the 3D map.
    *   Object Recognition Module: Deep learning-based object recognition module trained on a dataset of common household items.
    *   Object Tracking Module: Kalman filter-based object tracking module for maintaining the location of recognized objects.
    *   User Interface: Mobile app and web interface for visualizing the 3D map, managing objects, and configuring the system.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** Seamless integration with the existing access control features. The system can use the access control data to verify the identity of individuals within the home.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Mapping:** Upon installation, the system performs an initial scan of the home interior to create a base map.
2.  **Continuous Mapping & Tracking:** The system continuously scans the environment and updates the map as objects are moved or added.
3.  **Object Recognition:** The object recognition module identifies and labels common household items.
4.  **Object Tracking:** The object tracking module maintains the location of recognized objects over time.
5.  **User Interaction:** The user can view the 3D map on their mobile app or web interface. They can search for specific objects, track their location, and receive alerts if they are moved or misplaced.

**Pseudocode - Object Relocation Function:**

```
FUNCTION FindObject(objectName):
    // Access the 3D map data
    mapData = GetMapData()

    // Search for the object in the map data
    objectLocation = SearchObject(mapData, objectName)

    IF objectLocation != NULL:
        // Calculate the shortest path from the user's current location to the object's location
        path = CalculatePath(userLocation, objectLocation)

        // Display the path to the user
        DisplayPath(path)
        RETURN path
    ELSE:
        // Object not found
        DisplayMessage("Object not found")
        RETURN NULL
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Lost & Found:** Quickly locate misplaced items.
*   **Inventory Management:** Track the quantity and location of household supplies.
*   **Emergency Assistance:** Guide first responders to the location of injured individuals or hazards.
*   **Home Security:** Detect unauthorized movement of objects.
*   **Smart Home Automation:** Trigger automated actions based on the location of objects (e.g., turn on the lights when a person enters a room).
