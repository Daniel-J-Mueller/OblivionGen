## Adaptive Taxonomy Weighting via Temporal Decay & External Event Injection

**Concept:** Expand upon the core idea of identifying correlations within taxonomy nodes by dynamically weighting those correlations based on *time since last observed* and *injection of external, real-world event data*. This creates a ‘living’ taxonomy where relevance isn’t static but adapts to user behavior *and* broader context.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   `TaxonomyNode`: Existing structure (name, ID, parent, children). Add:
    *   `correlationWeight`: Float (0.0 - 1.0) – Represents the strength of observed correlations.
    *   `lastObserved`: Timestamp – Tracks the last time this node (or its children) were interacted with.
    *   `eventAssociations`: List of Event IDs – Associations with external events that impact this node's weight.
*   `Event`:
    *   `eventID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `eventType`: Categorical (e.g., ‘NewsStory’, ‘ProductLaunch’, ‘SeasonalSale’).
    *   `eventData`: Payload with relevant information.
    *   `taxonomyImpact`: Dictionary mapping `TaxonomyNodeID` to a weighting factor (positive or negative).

**II. Algorithms:**

1.  **Correlation Weight Decay:**
    *   Periodically (e.g., hourly) scan all `TaxonomyNode` instances.
    *   Calculate a decay factor: `decayFactor = e^(-λ * (currentTime - lastObserved))`
        *   `λ` (lambda) is a configurable decay constant (adjusts how quickly weights diminish).
    *   Apply the decay factor to the `correlationWeight`: `newCorrelationWeight = correlationWeight * decayFactor`

2.  **Event-Driven Weight Adjustment:**
    *   Listen for external `Event` occurrences.
    *   For each event, identify impacted `TaxonomyNode` instances based on `taxonomyImpact` mappings.
    *   Adjust the `correlationWeight` of those nodes:  `newCorrelationWeight = correlationWeight + (eventWeightingFactor * eventImpactValue)`
        *   `eventWeightingFactor`: Configurable constant influencing how much events affect weights.
        *   `eventImpactValue`: Value from `taxonomyImpact` indicating the magnitude and direction of the impact.

3.  **Adaptive Correlation Identification:**
    *   Existing correlation identification logic remains, but now utilizes the *adjusted* `correlationWeight` values. This ensures that correlations based on old or irrelevant data are less impactful.
    *   Introduce a ‘confidence threshold decay’ – thresholds used for correlation identification also decay over time, making it easier to establish new correlations based on recent data.

**III. Pseudocode (Event-Driven Weight Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
function handleEvent(event: Event) {
  foreach nodeID, impactValue in event.taxonomyImpact {
    node = getNodeByID(nodeID)
    if (node != null) {
      node.correlationWeight = node.correlationWeight + (eventWeightingFactor * impactValue)
      //Clamp correlationWeight between 0.0 and 1.0
      node.correlationWeight = clamp(node.correlationWeight, 0.0, 1.0)
    }
  }
}

function decayNodeWeights() {
  foreach node in allTaxonomyNodes {
    decayFactor = exp(-lambda * (currentTime - node.lastObserved))
    node.correlationWeight = node.correlationWeight * decayFactor
    node.correlationWeight = clamp(node.correlationWeight, 0.0, 1.0)
  }
}
```

**IV.  Implementation Notes:**

*   `lambda` and `eventWeightingFactor` should be configurable parameters, tunable based on data and performance.
*   Efficient data structures (e.g., hash maps) are crucial for quick node lookup and weight updates.
*   Consider using a message queue or event bus to handle external events asynchronously.
*   Implement monitoring to track the distribution of `correlationWeight` values and identify potential issues.
