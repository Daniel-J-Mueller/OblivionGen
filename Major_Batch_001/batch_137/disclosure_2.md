## Dynamic Recommendation "Mood" Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the diversity window concept to dynamically adjust recommendations not just based on similarity *between* items, but on a predicted “mood” of the user *at the time* of viewing, inferred from their recent interaction history. This creates a more personalized and engaging experience, going beyond simply avoiding repetition.

**Specs:**

*   **User Mood Inference Engine:**
    *   Input:  Recent user interaction data (views, purchases, dwell time, scrolling speed, click patterns, search queries - last 30 minutes prioritized).
    *   Process: Employ a time-series analysis model (LSTM or Transformer based) to predict a ‘mood vector’ - a multi-dimensional representation of the user’s current state (e.g., ‘exploratory’, ‘focused’, ‘relaxed’, ‘urgent’).  The dimensions are learned through training on a dataset correlating user behavior with labeled moods (potentially crowdsourced).
    *   Output:  Mood vector – representing user’s predicted mood.

*   **Recommendation “Palette” System:**
    *   Define a set of “Recommendation Palettes”.  Each palette represents a collection of item categories and associated stylistic parameters (e.g., “bright & playful”, “dark & mysterious”, “minimalist & functional”).
    *   Each palette is associated with a corresponding mood vector range.

*   **Dynamic Palette Selection:**
    *   Input: User’s predicted mood vector.
    *   Process: Determine the most appropriate Recommendation Palette by finding the palette whose associated mood vector range best matches the user’s current mood vector (using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance).
    *   Output:  Selected Recommendation Palette.

*   **Diversity Window Integration:**
    *   Modify the existing diversity window algorithm.  Instead of *only* considering item similarity, incorporate the selected Recommendation Palette.
    *   Within the diversity window, prioritize items that align with the selected palette.  Penalize items that strongly deviate from the palette’s stylistic parameters.  This introduces a 'style diversity' dimension alongside item diversity.

*   **Stylistic Parameter Database:**
    *   Each item in the catalog is tagged with stylistic parameters (e.g., color scheme, texture, complexity, theme). These parameters should be extractable using image/content analysis and manual curation.

**Pseudocode (Diversity Window Reordering):**

```
function reorder_recommendations(ranked_list, diversity_window_size, user_mood, stylistic_params_db):

  window_start = 0
  while window_start < len(ranked_list) - diversity_window_size:
    window_end = window_start + diversity_window_size
    window = ranked_list[window_start:window_end]

    # Calculate style alignment scores for each item in the window
    for item in window:
      style_alignment_score = calculate_style_alignment(item, user_mood, stylistic_params_db)
      item.style_alignment_score = style_alignment_score

    # Sort the window based on a combination of similarity and style alignment
    window.sort(key = lambda item: (item.similarity_score, -item.style_alignment_score))

    # Update the ranked list with the reordered window
    ranked_list[window_start:window_end] = window

    window_start += diversity_window_size

  return ranked_list
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Detailed user interaction logs (views, purchases, dwell time, scrolling speed, etc.).
*   Mood labeling dataset (user behavior correlated with labeled moods).
*   Stylistic parameter database for all items in the catalog.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Real-time mood adjustments based on facial expression analysis (if user grants permission).
*   Adaptive mood learning – the system learns the user's mood preferences over time.
*   Palette mixing – create hybrid palettes to cater to complex mood states.
