**Data Provenance & Temporal Reconstruction Service**

**Concept:** Extend the unmodifiable data container concept to include a complete, tamper-proof record of *all* interactions with the data – not just preventing modification, but recording *who* accessed *what*, *when*, and *how*. This builds a fully auditable data lineage.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A ‘Temporal Ledger’ service layered on top of the existing object storage.
*   **Data Structure:** Each data object within an unmodifiable container has an associated 'Provenance Chain'. This is an append-only log stored separately, but cryptographically linked to the data object itself.
*   **Event Types:** The Provenance Chain logs events like:
    *   `DATA_CREATED`: Timestamp, User ID, Originating IP, Hash of data.
    *   `ACCESS_READ`: Timestamp, User ID, IP Address, Data Range Accessed (byte offsets).
    *   `ACCESS_WRITE_ATTEMPT`: Timestamp, User ID, IP Address, Data Range, Reason for Denial (if applicable).
    *   `CONTAINER_CREATED`: Timestamp, User ID, Container Configuration.
    *   `CONTAINER_DELETED`: Timestamp, User ID.
*   **Cryptographic Linking:**
    *   Each event in the Provenance Chain is signed with the User ID’s private key.
    *   Each event contains a hash of the *previous* event in the chain, creating a secure, tamper-proof sequence.
    *   The first event for a data object is linked to the initial data object hash.
*   **Temporal Reconstruction API:**  Provides endpoints to:
    *   `GET_PROVENANCE_CHAIN(object_id)`:  Returns the complete Provenance Chain for a given object.
    *   `RECONSTRUCT_OBJECT(object_id, timestamp)`:  Returns the *state* of the object at a specific point in time, using the Provenance Chain to reconstruct it.  This could be used for regulatory compliance or to revert to a previous version.
*   **Access Control:** Access to the Provenance Chain itself is highly restricted, requiring elevated privileges. Standard users can only see records pertaining to their own actions.
*   **Storage:** Provenance Chains can be stored in a distributed ledger (e.g., blockchain) for even greater immutability and transparency, or in a highly-secure, append-only database.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Reconstruction API):**

```
function RECONSTRUCT_OBJECT(object_id, timestamp):
  // 1. Fetch the object's provenance chain from storage.
  provenance_chain = GET_PROVENANCE_CHAIN(object_id)

  // 2. Find the last event in the chain *before* the target timestamp.
  last_relevant_event = null
  for event in provenance_chain:
    if event.timestamp <= timestamp:
      last_relevant_event = event
    else:
      break

  // 3. If no relevant event is found, return the original object (or an error).
  if last_relevant_event == null:
    return GET_ORIGINAL_OBJECT(object_id) //Or error

  // 4. Reconstruct the object state based on events up to last_relevant_event
  //    (This may involve applying changes described in the events.)
  reconstructed_object = APPLY_EVENTS_TO_OBJECT(GET_ORIGINAL_OBJECT(object_id), events_before(last_relevant_event))

  return reconstructed_object
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Compliance & Auditing:** Demonstrate data integrity and adherence to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Forensic Analysis:** Investigate data breaches or unauthorized access.
*   **Version Control:** Revert to previous versions of data for testing or recovery.
*   **Data Lineage Tracking:** Understand the complete history of data transformations.
