## Aerial Vehicle Swarm Energy Distribution System

**Concept:** A distributed energy network for a swarm of aerial vehicles, leveraging inductive charging and dynamic power allocation. This moves beyond individual module swapping to a continuous, shared energy resource.

**Specifications:**

*   **Vehicle Integration:** Each aerial vehicle within the swarm is equipped with a standardized, high-efficiency inductive charging coil integrated into its lower surface. Coil dimensions: 20cm diameter, 5cm height. Material: Litz wire wound around a ferrite core.
*   **Charging Drone:** Designated “Energy Drone” within the swarm. Larger size (1.5x standard vehicle dimensions). Equipped with:
    *   High-capacity battery array (solid-state, 50kWh).
    *   Multiple (12) high-power inductive charging transmitters (aligned with standard vehicle coil size). Transmitter power output: adjustable 0-5kW per transmitter.
    *   Real-time vehicle positioning system (LiDAR/Computer Vision based) to accurately locate and align with recipient vehicles.
    *   Automated flight control system optimized for consistent, low-altitude hovering and precise positioning.
*   **Ground Infrastructure:** Network of strategically placed, high-capacity wireless power beacons. 
    *   Power Output: 100kW per beacon.
    *   Frequency: 60 kHz (optimized for efficiency and minimal interference).
    *   Coverage Area: 50m radius.
    *   Communication: Secure wireless link to swarm management system.
*   **Swarm Management System (Software):**
    *   Real-time monitoring of each vehicle’s battery level and energy needs.
    *   Dynamic power allocation algorithm: prioritizes critical vehicles (e.g., those performing essential tasks) and balances energy distribution across the swarm.
    *   Automated routing of Energy Drone to vehicles requiring charge.
    *   Integration with Ground Infrastructure: automatically directs Energy Drone to beacons for recharge.
    *   Fault Tolerance: redundancy built into the system to ensure continued operation even if some vehicles or infrastructure components fail.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Mesh Network: Vehicles communicate directly with each other, creating a robust and self-healing network.
    *   Data Exchange: Battery level, position, task status, and energy requests are transmitted wirelessly.
    *   Security: Encrypted communication channels to prevent unauthorized access and interference.

**Operational Sequence (Pseudocode):**

```
// Swarm Initialization
for each vehicle in swarm:
  vehicle.batteryLevel = 100%
  vehicle.taskStatus = "Idle"

// Continuous Monitoring Loop
while swarm is operational:
  for each vehicle in swarm:
    vehicle.batteryLevel = readBatteryLevel()
    if vehicle.batteryLevel < 20%:
      vehicle.requestEnergy()

  // Energy Drone Assignment
  if energy requests exist:
    energyDrone = findNearestEnergyDrone()
    routeEnergyDrone(energyDrone, requestingVehicle)

  // Energy Transfer
  energyDrone.alignWith(requestingVehicle)
  energyDrone.transferEnergy(requestingVehicle)

  // Ground Recharge (if necessary)
  if energyDrone.batteryLevel < 20%:
    routeEnergyDroneToNearestBeacon()
    energyDrone.recharge()

  // Task Management
  for each vehicle in swarm:
    if vehicle.taskStatus == "Completed":
      assignNewTask(vehicle)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static power module replacement to a dynamic, distributed energy network. The use of inductive charging allows for continuous power transfer without physical contact, increasing operational efficiency and reducing downtime. The swarm management system optimizes energy allocation, ensuring that critical tasks are prioritized and the swarm remains operational even in challenging environments. This is also a departure from the patent which is centered around manual replacement. The new system is autonomous.
