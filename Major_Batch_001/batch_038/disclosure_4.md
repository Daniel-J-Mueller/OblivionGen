## Adaptive Power Profile Generation via Transient Analysis

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on determining *if* a power source is sufficient. This expands to *characterizing* the power source's dynamic response and creating an adaptive power profile for the device, maximizing efficiency and preventing instability. The device will actively probe the power source’s ability to handle rapid current demands, and shape its own operation accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Transient Response Probe (TRP) Module:**

*   **Function:** Applies precisely defined current steps (ramps, square waves, sawtooths) to the power source while monitoring the voltage response. This is beyond a simple voltage threshold check.
*   **Current Step Parameters:**
    *   Amplitude: Adjustable from microamps to the device’s maximum current draw.
    *   Duration: Adjustable from microseconds to milliseconds.
    *   Slew Rate: Adjustable to control the rate of current change.
    *   Waveform: Selectable between step, ramp, sawtooth, and custom waveforms.
*   **Voltage Monitoring:** High-resolution, high-bandwidth ADC to capture voltage transients. Sample rate: minimum 1 MHz.
*   **Impedance Calculation:**  TRP calculates the dynamic impedance of the power source at various frequencies based on the current stimulus and voltage response.

**2. Power Profile Generator (PPG) Module:**

*   **Function:**  Analyzes the data from the TRP module and creates a custom power profile.
*   **Profile Parameters:**
    *   Maximum Sustainable Current:  Determines the maximum current the power source can deliver without causing voltage sag.
    *   Transient Response Limit:  Defines the maximum allowable voltage drop during a transient event.
    *   Frequency Response Curve: Maps the power source's ability to handle current demands at different frequencies.
    *   Optimal Switching Frequency:  Determines the switching frequency for DC-DC converters that maximizes efficiency given the power source characteristics.
*   **Profile Storage:** Non-volatile memory (e.g., flash) to store the custom power profile.

**3. Dynamic Power Management (DPM) Module:**

*   **Function:**  Controls the device’s power consumption based on the custom power profile.
*   **Features:**
    *   Adaptive Current Limiting: Dynamically adjusts the current limit based on the power profile.
    *   Frequency Scaling: Adjusts the operating frequency of various modules to optimize power consumption.
    *   Voltage Scaling: Adjusts the supply voltage to different modules.
    *   Selective Module Power-Down: Power down unused modules to reduce overall power consumption.
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    ```pseudocode
    function managePower(currentDemand, powerProfile) {
      if (currentDemand > powerProfile.maxSustainableCurrent) {
        reduceClockSpeed(allModules); // Scale down all modules
        disableNonEssentialModules();
        if (currentDemand still exceeds limit) {
          enterLowPowerMode(); // Last resort
        }
      } else {
        // Optimize for performance based on profile
        setOptimalClockSpeed(performanceCriticalModules);
        enableLowPowerFeatures(allModules);
      }
    }
    ```

**4. System Integration:**

*   **Boot Sequence:** The TRP module runs during boot to characterize the power source and generate the custom power profile.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** The DPM module continuously monitors the power source voltage and current.
*   **Profile Update:** The TRP module can periodically re-characterize the power source to adapt to changing conditions.



This approach shifts from simply *detecting* power capability to *actively learning* and *optimizing* power usage for a superior and adaptable user experience. It is particularly beneficial for devices that operate in diverse environments with varying power source qualities.
