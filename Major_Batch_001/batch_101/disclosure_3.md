**Modular, Adaptive Interior for Rigid Carrier – “The Nest”**

**Concept:** Expand the ‘nested’ concept beyond just a flexible bag. Create a rigid carrier with fully modular, interchangeable interior ‘pods’ for specific item types. This moves beyond simply *carrying* items to *organizing* and *protecting* them within the carrier.

**Specs:**

1.  **Carrier Shell:** Rigid outer shell (ABS, Polypropylene, or similar) with standardized internal mounting points – a grid system of slots and rails. Dimensions scalable (small, medium, large) but maintaining consistent mounting interface.

2.  **Pod Types:**
    *   **Bottle Pod:** Rigid, shaped pod with individual bottle slots and cushioning.
    *   **Produce Pod:** Ventilated pod with adjustable dividers.
    *   **Fragile Item Pod:** High-density foam pod with customizable inserts.
    *   **Cooler Pod:** Insulated pod with removable ice pack slot.
    *   **Dry Goods Pod:** Solid-walled pod for boxed/canned items.
    *   **Universal Pod:** Open-top pod with adjustable straps/dividers.

3.  **Mounting System:**
    *   Pods attach to the carrier shell via a locking rail/slot mechanism.
    *   Pods can be rearranged within the carrier.
    *   A 'quick-release' mechanism for easy pod removal/replacement.
    *   Pods are dimensioned to fit seamlessly within the carrier without gaps.

4.  **Handle System:**
    *   Rotating, telescoping handles with ergonomic grips.
    *   Integrated locking mechanism to secure handles in various positions.

5.  **Materials:**
    *   Carrier Shell: ABS, Polypropylene, Recycled Plastic
    *   Pods: Molded Plastic (various colors/translucencies)
    *   Mounting Hardware: Stainless Steel or Reinforced Polymer

**Pseudocode (Pod Attachment/Detachment):**

```
FUNCTION AttachPod(pod, carrier):
    // Align pod with carrier mounting points
    ALIGN(pod, carrier)

    // Engage locking mechanism (sliding lock or rotating cam)
    ENGAGE_LOCK(pod, carrier)

    // Confirm secure attachment
    DISPLAY "Pod Attached"

FUNCTION DetachPod(pod, carrier):
    // Disengage locking mechanism
    DISENGAGE_LOCK(pod, carrier)

    // Slide or lift pod from carrier
    RELEASE_POD(pod, carrier)

    // Confirm pod detached
    DISPLAY "Pod Detached"
```

**Adaptive Features:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Add weight sensors to each pod to provide total weight information.
*   **RFID Tagging:** Assign RFID tags to each pod for automated inventory management.
*   **App Integration:** Develop an app to track pod contents, weight, and location.
*   **Customizable Pods:** Offer a 3D printing service for custom pod designs.
*   **Modular External Attachment Points:** Standardized mounting points on the carrier shell for external accessories (cup holders, phone mounts).
