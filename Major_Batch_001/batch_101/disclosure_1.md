## Adaptive Trust Scoring with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the authorization framework with a dynamic trust score for each client resource, continuously adjusted based on behavioral biometrics data. This moves beyond static security roles and provides granular, real-time authorization decisions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Agent (BDCA):**

*   **Deployment:** Installed on the client resource (VM, server, etc.).  Operates transparently to the user/application.
*   **Data Points:** Collects the following (configurable):
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure – if available)
    *   Mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, trajectory)
    *   Scroll behavior (speed, patterns)
    *   Application launch sequences
    *   Network traffic patterns (timing, volume, destination diversity – aggregated and anonymized)
    *   System resource usage patterns (CPU, memory, disk I/O – aggregated and anonymized)
*   **Preprocessing:**  BDCA performs local preprocessing:
    *   Noise filtering
    *   Feature extraction (e.g., statistical measures, time-series analysis)
    *   Data anonymization (e.g., masking IP addresses, removing identifiable user data)
*   **Transmission:** Securely transmits processed feature vectors to the Trust Assessment Service (TAS) at regular intervals (configurable).  Use TLS 1.3 or higher.

**2. Trust Assessment Service (TAS):**

*   **Model Training:** Uses machine learning models (e.g., anomaly detection, classification) trained on historical behavioral data from authorized client resources.  Separate models per security role are recommended.
*   **Real-Time Scoring:**  Receives feature vectors from BDCAs.  Calculates a trust score (0-100) based on deviation from the established baseline for that security role.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Dynamically adjusts trust thresholds based on contextual factors:
    *   Time of day
    *   Geographic location (based on IP address)
    *   Sensitivity of the accessed resource
    *   Recent security events (e.g., detected attacks)
*   **Integration with Authorization Service:**  Communicates with the existing Authorization Service.  Provides the trust score as an additional factor in the authorization decision. The Authorization Service combines the trust score with security role permissions.
*   **Alerting:**  Generates alerts when the trust score falls below a predefined threshold, indicating potential compromise.

**3. Authorization Service Modification:**

*   **Trust Score Integration:** Modify the Authorization Service to accept the trust score from the TAS as input.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Implement a rule-based system that adjusts access permissions based on the trust score:
    *   High Trust Score (90-100): Grant full access based on security role.
    *   Medium Trust Score (70-89):  Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) or limit access to sensitive resources.
    *   Low Trust Score (Below 70): Deny access or require administrator approval.
*   **Session Revocation:**  If the trust score drops significantly during an active session, automatically revoke the session.

**4.  Secure Communication:**

*   All communication between BDCA, TAS, and Authorization Service must be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or higher.
*   Implement mutual authentication between components.
*   Regularly rotate cryptographic keys.

**Pseudocode (Trust Assessment Service):**

```
function assessTrust(featureVector, securityRole) {
  // Load trained model for securityRole
  model = loadModel(securityRole)

  // Predict deviation from baseline
  deviation = predict(model, featureVector)

  // Calculate trust score
  trustScore = 100 - (deviation * scalingFactor)  //scalingFactor is configurable

  //Apply contextual adjustments (e.g., time of day, location)
  trustScore = adjustForContext(trustScore)

  return trustScore
}

function adjustForContext(trustScore) {
    // Add contextual logic here. For example:
    if (timeOfDay == "night") {
        trustScore = trustScore - 5 // Reduce score slightly at night.
    }
    return trustScore;
}
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simple activation codes and roles. It establishes a continuous trust assessment layer that dynamically adapts to user behavior, making the system far more resilient to compromised credentials or insider threats. The focus on behavioral biometrics, combined with adaptive thresholds, provides a significantly stronger security posture.
