**Dynamic RAT Prioritization via Predictive Modeling**

**Specification:** A system and method for proactively prioritizing Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection based on predicted network performance and user behavior, extending beyond simple incoming call/data notification.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Data Collector:** Gathers user data including: app usage, location history, time of day, historical RAT performance (RSSI, RSRP, throughput), movement patterns (speed, direction).
*   **Network Performance Monitor:** Continuously scans available RATs, logging performance metrics in real-time.
*   **Predictive Model Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, long short-term memory) trained on the collected behavioral and network performance data.  The model predicts the *optimal* RAT for the next defined time interval (e.g., 5, 10, 30 seconds) based on anticipated user activity and network conditions.
*   **RAT Prioritization Controller:**  An embedded controller that dynamically adjusts the priority of available RATs based on the output of the Predictive Model Engine. This isn't just about switching *to* a RAT when a notification comes in, but about *preemptively* prioritizing it.
*   **Multi-RAT Interface:** Hardware/software interface capable of simultaneously monitoring multiple RATs and seamlessly switching between them.
*   **Local Data Store:** Non-volatile memory for storing user profiles, historical data, and model parameters.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
Initialize:
    Load user profile and model parameters.
    Start Behavioral Data Collector and Network Performance Monitor.

Loop:
    Collect behavioral data.
    Collect network performance data.
    Predict optimal RAT using Predictive Model Engine (Input: behavioral data, network data, current RAT).
    Update RAT prioritization list based on prediction.
    If current RAT is not the highest priority:
        Initiate seamless handover to the highest priority RAT.
    Repeat.
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems react to incoming signals (calls, data). This system *proactively* anticipates needs.  It's about creating a continuous, predictive optimization loop, not a simple switch triggered by a notification.  The use of predictive modeling, incorporating both user behavior *and* network performance, is a key differentiator. This system could anticipate, for instance, a user moving into an area with poor LTE coverage and preemptively switch to a 5G connection before the signal drops. Or anticipate a burst of data usage from a specific app and prepare the fastest available connection.
