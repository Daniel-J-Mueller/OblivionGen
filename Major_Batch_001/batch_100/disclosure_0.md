## Dynamic Network Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the dual-interface approach to enable a virtual desktop instance to dynamically adopt different 'network personas' – pre-configured network configurations and security profiles – based on user activity and application context. This goes beyond simply connecting/disconnecting the second interface; it's about *transforming* its behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Definition Module:**

*   **Function:** Allows administrators (or potentially, AI-driven policy engines) to define distinct network personas.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `Persona Name`:  Unique identifier (e.g., "Secure Banking", "Development Environment", "Public Browsing").
    *   `Network Configuration`:  IP address range, DNS servers, default gateway, VPN settings, proxy configurations.  Can be static or dynamically assigned via DHCP.
    *   `Firewall Rules`:  Allow/deny rules for inbound and outbound traffic, based on port, protocol, IP address, and application.
    *   `Security Profile`:  Encryption settings, authentication requirements (e.g., multi-factor authentication), data loss prevention (DLP) rules.
    *   `Application Trigger`:  List of applications (by executable name, process ID, or signature) that trigger activation of this persona.  Can be inclusive (persona activates *if* these apps are running) or exclusive (persona activates *only if* these apps are *not* running).
    *   `User/Group Restriction`:  Optionally restrict persona activation to specific users or groups.
    *   `Duration`:  Maximum time a persona can remain active.

**2.  Persona Activation Engine:**

*   **Function:** Monitors user activity and application context in real-time.  Determines which persona, if any, should be active.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Poll for running processes and active network connections.
    2.  Match running processes against `Application Trigger` lists in defined personas.
    3.  Prioritize personas based on a predefined weighting scheme (e.g., security-critical personas have higher priority).
    4.  If multiple personas match, select the highest-priority persona.
    5.  If no persona matches, revert to a default “Neutral” persona (minimal network access).
    6.  Dynamically configure the second network interface based on the selected persona's settings. This includes:
        *   IP address configuration
        *   Firewall rule application
        *   Security profile enforcement
        *   DNS server settings
        *   Proxy configuration

**3.  Network Interface Management Module:**

*   **Function:**  Abstracts the underlying network interface configuration and provides a consistent API for the Persona Activation Engine.
*   **Methods:**
    *   `ConfigureInterface(persona)`:  Applies the network configuration specified in the `persona` object.
    *   `GetInterfaceStatus()`:  Returns the current network configuration and status of the interface.
    *   `MonitorTraffic(callback)`:  Monitors network traffic on the interface and calls the provided `callback` function with traffic statistics. (This can be used for anomaly detection and security monitoring.)

**4.  Dynamic Persona Switching:**

*   The system should seamlessly switch between personas based on user activity.  For example:
    *   When the user launches a banking application, the system automatically activates the "Secure Banking" persona.
    *   When the user closes the banking application, the system reverts to the "Neutral" persona or the previously active persona.

**Pseudocode (Persona Activation Engine):**

```
function ActivatePersona() {
  runningProcesses = GetRunningProcesses();
  activePersona = null;
  highestPriority = -1;

  for each persona in PersonaDefinitions {
    if (PersonaMatchesActivity(persona, runningProcesses)) {
      if (persona.Priority > highestPriority) {
        activePersona = persona;
        highestPriority = persona.Priority;
      }
    }
  }

  if (activePersona != null) {
    NetworkInterfaceManager.ConfigureInterface(activePersona);
  } else {
    NetworkInterfaceManager.ConfigureInterface(DefaultNeutralPersona);
  }
}

function PersonaMatchesActivity(persona, runningProcesses) {
  if (persona.ApplicationTriggerType == "Inclusive") {
    for each app in persona.ApplicationTriggerList {
      if (IsAppRunning(app, runningProcesses)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  } else if (persona.ApplicationTriggerType == "Exclusive") {
    for each app in persona.ApplicationTriggerList {
      if (IsAppRunning(app, runningProcesses)) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
}

// Run ActivatePersona() periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds) or on application launch/close events.
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Driven Persona Selection:**  Use machine learning to predict the user's intent and proactively select the appropriate persona.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration:**  Integrate with threat intelligence feeds to dynamically adjust firewall rules and security settings based on known threats.
*   **Persona Chaining:**  Allow personas to be chained together, so that activating one persona automatically activates another.
*   **Context-Aware Security:** Consider location, time of day, and other contextual factors when selecting a persona.
