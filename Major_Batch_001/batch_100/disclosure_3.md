## Dynamic Namespace Sharding & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the namespace directory concept to incorporate predictive prefetching based on access patterns *and* dynamically shard namespaces across multiple storage bridge devices â€“ effectively creating a distributed, intelligent caching layer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Enhanced Namespace Directory:**

*   **Data Structures:**  Augment the existing namespace directory with the following:
    *   `AccessHistory[NamespaceID]`: A time-series data structure storing recent access timestamps and data sizes for each namespace.  Stores the last N access events.
    *   `PrefetchProbability[NamespaceID]`: A floating-point value representing the probability that data in a namespace will be accessed again soon, calculated based on `AccessHistory`.  Utilize an exponential decay function to prioritize recent accesses.
    *   `ShardLocation[NamespaceID]`:  An array identifying which storage bridge device(s) currently hold shards of this namespace.
*   **Namespace Sharding Algorithm:** Implement a dynamic sharding algorithm:
    *   **Initial Sharding:**  Upon initial namespace creation, distribute shards across available storage bridge devices using a consistent hashing scheme (e.g., Rendezvous Hashing).
    *   **Dynamic Re-sharding:**  Monitor namespace access patterns. If a namespace experiences significantly higher access frequency on one storage bridge device, initiate a re-shard operation, migrating data to balance load.  Re-sharding triggers should be configurable.
    *   **Shard Granularity:** Shard sizes are configurable but should be relatively small (e.g., 1GB) to facilitate fine-grained load balancing and prefetching.

**2. Predictive Prefetching Engine:**

*   **Prefetch Trigger:**  When a request is received for a namespace, the engine evaluates `PrefetchProbability`. If the probability exceeds a configurable threshold, a prefetch operation is initiated.
*   **Prefetch Scope:** Prefetching doesn't retrieve the entire namespace. Based on access history and access size, prefetch the next *N* sequential blocks within the namespace.  *N* is configurable.
*   **Prefetch Destination:** Prefetch data to the *local* cache of the storage bridge device handling the initial request.
*   **Prefetch Prioritization:**  If multiple prefetches are triggered concurrently, prioritize those for namespaces with the highest `PrefetchProbability` and shortest estimated transfer times.

**3. Inter-Bridge Communication Protocol:**

*   **Data Replication:** Implement a replication protocol for namespace shards. Use a write-through or write-back cache policy, configurable per namespace.
*   **Cache Coherence:**  Utilize a timestamp-based cache coherence mechanism to ensure data consistency across multiple storage bridge devices.
*   **Health Monitoring:** Implement a heartbeat protocol to monitor the health and availability of each storage bridge device.

**4.  Control Plane & Management Interface:**

*   **API:** Expose an API for administrators to:
    *   Configure sharding parameters (shard size, replication factor).
    *   Adjust prefetching thresholds.
    *   Monitor namespace access patterns.
    *   Initiate manual re-sharding operations.
*   **Metrics:** Collect and expose metrics related to:
    *   Namespace access latency.
    *   Prefetch hit rate.
    *   Storage bridge device load.
    *   Re-sharding frequency.



**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  namespaceID = request.namespaceID
  accessHistory = getAccessHistory(namespaceID)
  prefetchProbability = calculatePrefetchProbability(accessHistory)

  if prefetchProbability > prefetchThreshold:
    prefetchData(namespaceID)

  // Process request as usual
  ...

function calculatePrefetchProbability(accessHistory):
  // Implement exponential decay function
  //  Higher weight to recent accesses
  ...

function prefetchData(namespaceID):
  // Determine next N blocks based on access history
  nextBlocks = ...
  // Issue read request for nextBlocks to storage
  // Store prefetched data in local cache
  ...

```
