## Adaptive Key Sharding with Predictive Reconstruction

**Concept:** Enhance data durability and retrieval speed by proactively sharding keys *and* data, combined with a predictive system anticipating data loss *before* it occurs. This differs from standard replication/erasure coding by introducing a dynamic, predictive element to data placement and key management.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Key Shard Generator (KSG):** Module responsible for dynamically splitting keys into multiple shards. Shard count is determined by data importance (user-defined priority), historical data loss patterns for specific storage nodes, and predictive analytics (see section III).
*   **Data Shard Generator (DSG):** Module responsible for splitting data into multiple shards. Operates in conjunction with KSG; a single data shard is linked to a specific key shard.
*   **Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) Engine:** AI-driven engine constantly monitoring storage node health (disk I/O, temperature, error rates, network latency). PFA outputs risk scores for each node and predicts potential failures with a defined confidence level. It also learns historical access patterns and usage frequencies to influence data placement.
*   **Distributed Key-Value Store (DKVS):** Existing infrastructure for storing key-value pairs. Modified to accommodate sharded keys and data.
*   **Reconstruction Manager (RM):** Responsible for assembling data shards from different nodes during retrieval. Uses key shards to locate corresponding data shards.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Client sends data to the system.
    *   Data Importance Level (DIL) is assigned (user-defined, or automatically derived from data type/usage).
    *   KSG and DSG split the data and key based on DIL and PFA output. Higher DIL = more shards. PFA considers risk levels to determine sharding strategy (e.g., distribute shards across nodes with low predicted failure rates).
    *   Shards are distributed to different storage nodes.
    *   Mapping of shard locations to key/data shards is stored in DKVS, protected by redundancy.

2.  **Data Retrieval:**
    *   Client requests data using the original key.
    *   DKVS retrieves the key shards.
    *   RM uses key shards to locate corresponding data shards.
    *   RM retrieves data shards from different storage nodes.
    *   RM assembles the data shards into the original data.
    *   Data is returned to the client.

3.  **Proactive Reconstruction:**
    *   PFA detects an impending storage node failure (high confidence level).
    *   RM proactively retrieves data shards from the failing node.
    *   RM reconstructs the complete data object using remaining shards.
    *   RM stores the reconstructed data object on a healthy node *before* the original node fails.

**III. Pseudocode (PFA Engine - Simplified)**

```pseudocode
function predictNodeFailure(nodeID):
  // Inputs: nodeID (unique identifier for storage node)
  // Outputs: riskScore (0.0 - 1.0, higher = higher risk)

  // Collect Metrics:
  diskIORate = getDiskIORate(nodeID)
  temperature = getTemperature(nodeID)
  errorRate = getErrorRate(nodeID)
  networkLatency = getNetworkLatency(nodeID)

  // Historical Data:
  pastFailures = getPastFailures(nodeID)
  accessFrequency = getAccessFrequency(nodeID)

  // Weighted Sum (Adjust weights based on testing/data):
  riskScore = (0.3 * diskIORate) + (0.2 * temperature) + (0.2 * errorRate) + (0.1 * networkLatency) + (0.2 * pastFailures)

  // Normalize Score (0.0 - 1.0)
  riskScore = min(1.0, max(0.0, riskScore))

  return riskScore
```

**IV. Key Innovations:**

*   **Predictive Sharding:** Proactively adjusts sharding levels based on predicted node failures.
*   **Adaptive Granularity:** Dynamically changes the size of data/key shards based on risk and performance.
*   **Proactive Reconstruction:** Preemptively reconstructs data before failures occur, minimizing downtime and data loss.
*   **Data/Key Linkage:** Tight coupling between key and data shards simplifies retrieval and reconstruction.
