## Temporal Resource Weaving

**Concept:** Extend reversion capabilities beyond simple state restoration to *weave* together multiple historical states of a virtual computing environment, creating a composite, functioning system. Imagine merging configurations and data from different points in time, not just reverting *to* one.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Snapshotting:**

*   **Granularity:** Implement snapshotting at a per-resource level (VM, database, network configuration, etc.) with user-defined frequency.  Not just full image snapshots, but differential snapshots capturing only changes since the last capture.
*   **Metadata:** Each snapshot must be tagged with precise timestamps, user/process initiating the change, and a ‘semantic category’ (e.g., “application deployment,” “security update,” “performance tuning”).
*   **Storage:** Utilize tiered storage based on snapshot age and access frequency (fast SSD for recent snapshots, slower/cheaper storage for archival). Implement data compression and deduplication.

**2. Temporal Composition Engine:**

*   **Interface:** Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) and API for defining "Temporal Compositions."
*   **Rules:**  Allow users to define rules for selecting and merging snapshots. Rules can be based on:
    *   **Time Range:**  "Combine all states between date X and date Y."
    *   **Semantic Category:** “Combine application deployments from the last week, excluding security updates.”
    *   **Resource Specificity:** “Use the database configuration from snapshot X, but the web server configuration from snapshot Y.”
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** Define automated conflict resolution strategies (e.g., "last write wins," "merge based on timestamp," "prompt user").
*   **Virtualization Layer:** A dedicated virtualization layer isolates and manages the merged environment.  This layer translates requests to the appropriate snapshot.  Essentially a 'time-slicing' layer.

**3. Runtime Environment:**

*   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** The runtime environment dynamically allocates resources to the merged environment, drawing from the underlying snapshots.
*   **State Reconciliation:** Implement a state reconciliation engine to handle inconsistencies or conflicts that arise during runtime.
*   **Auditing & Traceability:**  Maintain a detailed audit log of all runtime operations, including the source snapshot for each resource.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Composition Creation):**

```
function CreateTemporalComposition(compositionName, ruleSet) {
  // ruleSet contains a list of rules:
  // {resourceType: "VM", timeRange: [timestamp1, timestamp2], snapshotSelectionStrategy: "latest"}
  // {resourceType: "Database", semanticCategory: "backup", snapshotSelectionStrategy: "closestTo"}

  snapshotSet = {}

  for each rule in ruleSet {
    resourceType = rule.resourceType
    snapshots = GetSnapshots(resourceType, rule) // Retrieves snapshots matching criteria
    bestSnapshot = SelectSnapshot(snapshots, rule.snapshotSelectionStrategy) // Chooses optimal snapshot
    snapshotSet[resourceType] = bestSnapshot
  }

  composition = CreateVirtualEnvironment(snapshotSet) // Assembles the environment using selected snapshots
  SaveComposition(composition, compositionName)
  return composition
}
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Debugging:**  Reconstruct past system states to diagnose and resolve complex issues.
*   **Performance Analysis:**  Compare system performance across different time periods.
*   **Disaster Recovery:**  Restore a system to a known good state from a specific point in time.
*   **Experimentation:**  Test new configurations and features without disrupting production systems.
*   **Compliance & Auditing:**  Provide a verifiable record of system changes for compliance purposes.
