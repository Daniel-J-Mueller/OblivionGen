## Dynamic Intent Sculpting for Proactive Recommendations

**Concept:** Expand upon the patent's “indication of intent” by introducing a system that doesn't just *react* to stated intent, but *sculpts* it in real-time through a layered, probabilistic recommendation engine.  Instead of simply finding items related to a search, this aims to gently nudge the user towards potentially *more* satisfying results they might not have initially considered, building a richer, more nuanced user profile concurrently.

**Specs:**

**1.  Intent Layering:**

*   **Base Intent:** Initial search query/stated preference (as per the patent).
*   **Implicit Intent:** Derived from user behavior: browsing history, dwell time on products, click-through rates, purchase history, social media activity (with user permission).  Represented as a weighted vector of item attributes (e.g., color, material, price range, style).
*   **Proactive Intent:** Calculated by the system based on:
    *   **Collaborative Filtering:**  Similar to the patent, identifies items favored by users with similar profiles.
    *   **Content-Based Filtering:**  Analyzes item attributes to suggest items with matching or complementary characteristics.
    *   **Serendipity Factor:**  Introduces a small degree of randomness to expose users to unexpected items that *might* be relevant, based on subtle correlations in the data.  This is controlled by a tunable parameter.
    *   **Trend Analysis:** Incorporates real-time trend data (e.g., popular items, seasonal variations) to suggest items that are currently gaining traction.

**2.  Dynamic Weighting & Sculpting:**

*   Each intent layer (Base, Implicit, Proactive) is assigned a weight.  These weights are *dynamic* and adjust in real-time based on user interaction.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  User actions (clicks, purchases, adding to cart, dismissing recommendations) provide feedback that modifies the intent weights. For example:
    *   If a user consistently ignores Proactive Intent recommendations, its weight decreases.
    *   If a user frequently purchases items suggested by Implicit Intent, its weight increases.
*   **“Sculpting” Algorithm:**  The system doesn’t simply present a list of recommendations.  It “sculpts” the user’s intent by subtly biasing the results towards items that align with the combined weighted intent layers. This is achieved by:
    *   **Re-ranking:**  Adjusting the order of search results based on the weighted intent.
    *   **Feature Highlighting:**  Emphasizing features of items that match the user’s inferred preferences.
    *   **Contextual Messaging:**  Providing personalized explanations for why a particular item is being recommended.

**3.  System Architecture:**

*   **Intent Engine:** Responsible for calculating and updating the weighted intent layers.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** Generates and ranks recommendations based on the weighted intent.
*   **User Profile Database:** Stores detailed user data, including purchase history, browsing behavior, and inferred preferences.
*   **Item Catalog:** Contains information about all available items, including attributes, descriptions, and images.
*   **Real-time Data Feed:**  Provides access to real-time trend data and user behavior.

**4.  Pseudocode (Intent Engine):**

```pseudocode
function calculateWeightedIntent(userProfile, itemCatalog, searchQuery, userActivity) {

  // Calculate Implicit Intent from userActivity (browsing, purchases)
  implicitIntent = calculateImplicitIntent(userActivity, itemCatalog)

  // Calculate Proactive Intent using collaborative, content-based, serendipity
  proactiveIntent = calculateProactiveIntent(userProfile, itemCatalog, searchQuery)

  // Initialize weights (tunable parameters)
  baseIntentWeight = 0.4
  implicitIntentWeight = 0.3
  proactiveIntentWeight = 0.3

  // Adjust weights based on user feedback (historical interactions)
  // ... (Logic to update weights based on clicks, purchases, dismissals) ...

  // Combine intents based on weights
  combinedIntent = (baseIntentWeight * baseIntent) +
                  (implicitIntentWeight * implicitIntent) +
                  (proactiveIntentWeight * proactiveIntent)

  return combinedIntent
}
```

**5.  Potential Extensions:**

*   **Emotional Intent Detection:**  Integrate sentiment analysis of user input (e.g., search queries, product reviews) to infer emotional state and tailor recommendations accordingly.
*   **Multi-Modal Intent:**  Incorporate data from multiple sources, such as images, videos, and voice commands, to create a more comprehensive understanding of user intent.
*   **Personalized Serendipity:**  Adjust the serendipity factor based on individual user preferences and personality traits.
