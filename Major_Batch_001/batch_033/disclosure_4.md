## Dynamic Intent Weaving for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive dialog management to *proactively* anticipate user needs based on ongoing intent analysis, creating a "woven" experience where the system anticipates follow-up actions *before* being explicitly asked. This isn't just about clarifying ambiguity, but about offering logical next steps.

**Specification:**

**1. Intent Stack & Decay:**

*   Maintain an "Intent Stack" – a data structure holding the N most recent identified intents (e.g., top 5). Each intent entry includes:
    *   Intent ID
    *   Confidence Score
    *   Timestamp
    *   Associated Entities/Values (e.g., item name, date, location)
    *   "Decay Rate" – a configurable parameter determining how quickly the intent's weight diminishes over time.  Higher decay for transient intents (e.g., "play a song"), lower decay for longer-term goals (e.g., "plan a trip").
*   Each time a new intent is identified, it's added to the stack. Intents are periodically re-evaluated, and their weights adjusted based on Decay Rate and time elapsed. Intents with consistently low weights are removed.

**2. Proactive Suggestion Engine:**

*   A dedicated module constantly analyzes the Intent Stack. It employs a rule-based system combined with a lightweight predictive model (e.g., a simple RNN) trained on a large dataset of user interaction logs.
*   The engine searches for "intent clusters" – combinations of intents that frequently lead to specific user goals.  Example: “Add item to list” + “Set reminder” often leads to "Buy groceries".
*   Based on the intent cluster and user context (time of day, location, calendar events), the engine generates proactive suggestions.

**3. Dynamic Suggestion Presentation:**

*   Suggestions are *not* presented as direct questions ("Do you want to add this to your list?"). Instead, they are subtly integrated into the user interface.
*   **Visual Cues:**  A dynamically updated row of "smart actions" appears below the main input field. These actions are visually distinct from standard suggestions, using a different color and icon.
*   **Adaptive Prioritization:**  The order of smart actions is based on a combination of the engine’s confidence score and a user preference model.
*   **Voice Prompts:**  If the user is in a voice-only interaction, the system delivers subtle prompts. Example:  "Just a reminder, you added milk to your shopping list."
*   **Non-Interruptive Mode:** Suggestions can be configured to be displayed in a non-interruptive mode, only appearing when the user pauses or appears to be thinking.

**4. Confidence Threshold & Learning:**

*   A configurable confidence threshold determines when a suggestion is displayed.
*   User interaction with suggestions (acceptance, rejection, modification) is used to refine the engine’s predictive model and personalize the experience.  A reinforcement learning approach could be used to optimize suggestion quality.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Suggestion Engine):**

```
function generate_suggestions(intent_stack, user_context):
  intent_clusters = find_relevant_clusters(intent_stack)
  for cluster in intent_clusters:
    predicted_action = predict_next_action(cluster, user_context)
    confidence = calculate_confidence(predicted_action, user_context)
    if confidence > confidence_threshold:
      suggestion = create_suggestion(predicted_action)
      add_suggestion(suggestion)
  return suggestions
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Grocery Shopping:**  Automatically suggest adding commonly paired items to the list ("You added bread, want to add butter?").
*   **Travel Planning:**  Propose booking a flight or hotel based on calendar events and past travel history.
*   **Smart Home Control:**  Suggest adjusting the thermostat or turning off lights based on time of day and user location.
