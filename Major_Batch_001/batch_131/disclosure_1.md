## Adaptive Radio Resource Allocation via Predictive Interference Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the interference mitigation of the provided patent by proactively *predicting* interference patterns based on learned usage and environmental data, and dynamically allocating radio resources (frequency bands, transmit power, modulation schemes) *before* interference occurs. This moves beyond reactive gain/power adjustments to *preventative* resource management.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-radio device with at least three radios (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a dedicated short-range radio for environmental sensing – potentially UWB).
    *   Environmental sensors: Microphone array, vibration sensor, potentially a simple RF spectrum analyzer.
    *   Dedicated Edge AI accelerator.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Data Collection Module:** Continuous monitoring of radio activity (transmit/receive times, frequencies, power levels) for all radios. Records environmental data from sensors.
    *   **Interference Prediction Model:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically an LSTM or GRU – trained on historical data (radio activity, environmental data).  The model predicts potential interference events – frequency bands likely to experience interference, intensity of interference, and time windows of predicted interference.  This model will be continuously updated with new data.
    *   **Resource Allocation Engine:**  Takes the output of the Interference Prediction Model and dynamically allocates radio resources. This includes:
        *   **Frequency Hopping:**  Instructs radios to switch frequencies proactively to avoid predicted interference.
        *   **Transmit Power Control:**  Adjusts transmit power levels to minimize interference to other devices *before* transmission.
        *   **Modulation Scheme Selection:** Chooses the most robust modulation scheme (e.g., QPSK, 16-QAM) based on predicted interference levels.
        *   **Radio Prioritization:** If resources are constrained, prioritizes radios based on application requirements (e.g., real-time streaming gets higher priority than background data transfer).
    *   **Calibration Module:**  Similar to the patent, performs initial calibration to measure isolation between radios.  This data is used to refine the Interference Prediction Model.
    *   **Adaptive Learning Module:** Reinforcement learning algorithm to further optimize the Resource Allocation Engine based on real-world performance. Rewards are given for successful data transmission with minimal interference, and penalties for failed transmissions or high interference.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Engine):**

```
function allocateResources():
  interferencePredictions = getInterferencePredictions()  // From the Prediction Model

  for each radio in radios:
    predictedInterference = interferencePredictions[radio]

    if predictedInterference > threshold:
      // Adjust resources to mitigate interference

      bestFrequency = findOptimalFrequency(radio, predictedInterference)
      setRadioFrequency(radio, bestFrequency)

      bestPowerLevel = calculateOptimalPowerLevel(radio, predictedInterference)
      setRadioPowerLevel(radio, bestPowerLevel)

      modulationScheme = selectRobustModulationScheme(predictedInterference)
      setRadioModulationScheme(radio, modulationScheme)
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Continuous data collection (radio activity, environmental data).
2.  Data fed into the Interference Prediction Model.
3.  Model generates interference predictions.
4.  Resource Allocation Engine uses predictions to dynamically allocate resources.
5.  Performance monitored and used to update the Interference Prediction Model via the Adaptive Learning Module.

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive interference mitigation to *proactive* resource allocation based on predicted interference, leveraging environmental sensing and machine learning.  It addresses the limitations of simply adjusting gain/power after interference has already begun, offering improved reliability and performance in crowded RF environments.
