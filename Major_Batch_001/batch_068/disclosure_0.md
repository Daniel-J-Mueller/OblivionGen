## Adaptive Resonance Sorting – Multi-Level Conveyor System Enhancement

**Concept:** Integrate a dynamic, resonant frequency system *within* the conveyor levels to sort objects not just by physical separation (as the base patent suggests), but by material properties based on resonant frequencies. This goes beyond sequential orientation; it allows for active material categorization *during* conveyance.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Conveyor Bed Modification:** Each conveyor segment (upper, subsequent, and any future levels) will incorporate an array of piezoelectric transducers embedded within the conveying surface. These transducers generate and detect subtle vibrations.

2.  **Frequency Sweep & Resonance Detection:** A microcontroller (integrated into each level’s control system) initiates a frequency sweep across a predetermined range.  As objects pass over the transducers, the system monitors for resonant frequencies – frequencies at which the object vibrates with increased amplitude.  Different materials will exhibit different resonant frequencies.

3.  **Material Database & Classification:**  A pre-populated database stores the resonant frequency signatures of known materials. The system compares the detected frequencies to this database to classify the object’s material.  Machine learning algorithms will refine classification accuracy over time.

4.  **Dynamic Divert Mechanisms:** Based on material classification, small, localized air jets (or miniature linear actuators) are activated to subtly divert the object onto a designated output lane *within* the same conveyor level, or to a different level entirely. These diverts will occur *before* any discharge openings are reached, ensuring precise sorting.

5.  **Feedback Loop & Calibration:**  Optical sensors (cameras) positioned downstream confirm the accuracy of the sorting. The system uses this feedback to automatically calibrate the frequency sweep range and the diverter activation thresholds.

6.  **Level Intercommunication:** Conveyor levels communicate via a central control system. This enables objects to "cascade" through the system, being re-classified and re-sorted at each level based on increasingly refined data.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// For each object passing over conveyor level 'n'
FOR each object IN objectQueue(level_n) {
    // Initiate frequency sweep
    frequencySweep(startFrequency, endFrequency);

    // Detect resonant frequencies
    resonantFrequencies = detectResonantFrequencies();

    // Classify material
    materialType = classifyMaterial(resonantFrequencies);

    // Determine output lane
    outputLane = determineOutputLane(materialType);

    // Activate diverter
    activateDiverter(outputLane);
}
```
