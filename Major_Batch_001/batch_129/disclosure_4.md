## Dynamic Content Sharding via Probabilistic Addressing

**Concept:** Extend the existing targeting mechanisms by introducing a probabilistic addressing layer *before* DNS resolution. This allows for dynamic content sharding based on real-time network conditions and attack vectors, offering a finer-grained defense and improved content delivery.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Entropy Source:** A hardware or software-based entropy source generating a stream of random numbers.
*   **Sharding Controller:** A central component responsible for managing the sharding process. It receives entropy from the Entropy Source, configures sharding parameters, and distributes these parameters to edge nodes.
*   **Edge Nodes:** The points of presence (POPs) that serve content. Each edge node implements the sharding logic based on parameters from the Sharding Controller.
*   **Client-Side Component:** A lightweight component integrated into client applications (browsers, mobile apps) to participate in the sharding process.

**2. Sharding Logic:**

*   **Initial Configuration:** Upon content deployment, the Sharding Controller assigns each content item a unique identifier (UID). It also pre-defines a set of possible sharding factors (e.g., number of shards, shard size).
*   **Dynamic Shard Assignment:**
    *   The Sharding Controller monitors network conditions (latency, packet loss, attack signatures).
    *   Based on these conditions, it dynamically adjusts the sharding parameters for each content item.
    *   It uses the entropy source to generate a random number for each client request.
    *   This random number, combined with the content UID, determines which shard the client should access.
*   **Shard Resolution:**
    *   Instead of directly resolving the content’s domain name, the client-side component sends a request to a Shard Resolver.
    *   The Shard Resolver uses the client's request parameters (IP address, User-Agent, etc.) and the Sharding Controller’s configuration to determine the optimal shard for the client.
    *   The Shard Resolver returns the IP address of the edge node hosting the requested shard.
*   **Content Delivery:** The client directly requests the content from the designated edge node.

**3. Attack Mitigation:**

*   **Traffic Diversion:** During a DDoS attack, the Sharding Controller can rapidly increase the number of shards and dynamically assign clients to different shards, effectively distributing the attack traffic.
*   **Adaptive Sharding:** If a specific shard is under attack, the Sharding Controller can reduce the number of clients assigned to that shard, shifting traffic to healthy shards.
*   **Entropy-Based Obfuscation:** The use of entropy in shard assignment makes it more difficult for attackers to predict which shards to target.

**4. Pseudocode (Sharding Controller):**

```
function update_sharding_parameters(content_uid, network_conditions) {
  // Calculate optimal number of shards based on network conditions
  num_shards = calculate_num_shards(network_conditions);

  // Assign shards to edge nodes based on load balancing and proximity
  shard_assignments = assign_shards_to_nodes(num_shards);

  // Store shard assignments in a distributed cache
  store_shard_assignments(content_uid, shard_assignments);
}

function get_shard_assignment(content_uid, client_ip) {
  // Retrieve shard assignments from cache
  shard_assignments = retrieve_shard_assignments(content_uid);

  // Generate a random number based on client IP and current time
  random_number = generate_random_number(client_ip, current_time);

  // Calculate the shard index based on the random number and number of shards
  shard_index = random_number % number_of_shards;

  // Return the edge node hosting the assigned shard
  return shard_assignments[shard_index];
}
```

**5. Considerations:**

*   Increased complexity in infrastructure management.
*   Potential for increased latency due to the shard resolution process.
*   Need for a robust distributed cache to store shard assignments.
*   Scalability of the Shard Resolver component.
*   Compatibility with existing content delivery networks (CDNs).
