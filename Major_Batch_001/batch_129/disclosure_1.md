## Dynamic Credential Delegation with Temporal Scoping

**Concept:** Extend the core credential management system to enable *temporary* delegation of credentials based on time-bound resource access needs, creating a ‘just-in-time’ access control layer on top of existing customer identities. This moves beyond simply activating/deactivating credentials for entire VM instances and allows fine-grained control over *when* credentials are valid for a given task.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Access Tokens (TATs):**

*   **Structure:** TATs are short-lived tokens derived from the core credentials. They encapsulate:
    *   `credential_id`: Link to the original customer credential.
    *   `resource_id`: Identifies the specific resource (e.g., storage bucket, database table) being accessed.
    *   `start_time`:  Timestamp indicating when the token becomes valid.
    *   `end_time`: Timestamp indicating when the token expires.
    *   `operation_type`: (Optional) Specifies allowed operations (e.g., read, write, execute).
    *   `signature`: Cryptographically signed to prevent tampering.

*   **Generation:** A new service - the “TAT Generator” - will be responsible for issuing TATs. It receives requests including the `credential_id`, `resource_id`, desired validity period, and operation type. It verifies the requesting entity (likely an orchestrator or application server) has permission to request TATs for that customer's credentials.

*   **Validation:**  Resource services will *require* TATs for authentication instead of direct credential verification. The resource service will:
    1.  Verify the signature on the TAT.
    2.  Check that the current time falls within the `start_time` and `end_time`.
    3.  (If present) Verify the requested `operation_type` is permitted by the TAT.
    4.  Validate the `credential_id` against the credentials map (ensuring it’s still active).

**2.  Orchestration Layer Integration:**

*   **API Extensions:** The credential management system needs new APIs for:
    *   `request_tat(credential_id, resource_id, duration, operation_type)`:  Requests a TAT from the TAT Generator. Returns the TAT if successful, or an error if not.
    *   `revoke_tat(tat_id)`:  Allows an orchestrator to proactively revoke a TAT before it expires (e.g., if a task fails).
*   **Automatic TAT Requesting:**  The orchestrator should be configured with policies defining when TATs are needed for specific resources and tasks. This allows it to automatically request TATs without manual intervention.

**3.  Credential Map Extension:**

*   The credentials map should include a flag indicating if a credential is eligible for TAT generation. This allows administrators to disable TATs for specific credentials if needed.
*   A TAT cache may be utilized to improve lookup times.

**Pseudocode (Orchestrator Workflow):**

```
function execute_task(task_details):
  resource_id = task_details.resource_id
  operation_type = task_details.operation_type

  tat = request_tat(customer_credential_id, resource_id, task_duration, operation_type)

  if tat == NULL:
    log_error("Failed to obtain TAT")
    return FAILURE

  try:
    access_resource(resource_id, tat) # Resource service validates TAT
    // Perform task
    return SUCCESS
  except Exception as e:
    log_error("Task failed: " + str(e))
    return FAILURE
  finally:
    //Optional: Revoke TAT if task completes/fails before expiry
    revoke_tat(tat.tat_id)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Attack Surface:**  Short-lived TATs minimize the impact of compromised credentials.
*   **Granular Access Control:**  TATs enable precise control over *when* and *how* resources are accessed.
*   **Automated Security:**  The orchestrator can automatically manage TATs, reducing manual intervention.
*   **Compliance:**  Provides a clear audit trail of resource access.
