## Adaptive Log Granularity & Predictive Fusion

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically adjusting log record granularity based on data change frequency *and* predicting future fusion opportunities.

**Rationale:** The existing patent focuses on reconciling differences *after* they occur and performing fusion/coalescing as a reactive measure. This builds on that by proactively shaping the log structure itself to *reduce* divergence and optimize future reconciliation.

**Components:**

1.  **Change Frequency Monitor:** Tracks the rate of change for each data page or section within the log-structured data store. Uses a rolling window to calculate change rates.  Pages with high change rates will be logged with *smaller* granularity (more frequent log records), while pages with low change rates can utilize *larger* granularity (less frequent records).

2.  **Predictive Fusion Engine:** Employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to *predict* likely adjacent changes to data pages.  If the engine predicts a high probability of an immediate subsequent change to an adjacent page, it *pre-fuses* the initial log record with a placeholder. This placeholder is then updated when the subsequent change occurs, effectively creating a single, fused record from the outset.

3.  **Granularity Adjustment Policy:** A configurable policy defining the relationship between change frequency and log granularity.  This allows administrators to tune the system's behavior based on workload characteristics. Examples:

    *   If change frequency > X per minute, granularity = Y bytes.
    *   If change frequency < Z per hour, granularity = W kilobytes.

4.  **Log Record Metadata:** Extend log record metadata to include:

    *   Granularity level used for this record.
    *   Prediction confidence level (from Predictive Fusion Engine).
    *   Placeholder flags (indicating pre-fused records).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Fusion Engine - simplified):**

```
function predict_next_change(data_page_id, current_timestamp):
  // Fetch historical change data for data_page_id
  historical_data = fetch_historical_changes(data_page_id)

  // Train time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM) using historical_data
  model = train_model(historical_data)

  // Predict next change timestamp and data
  prediction = model.predict(current_timestamp)

  // Calculate confidence level of prediction
  confidence = calculate_confidence(prediction)

  return prediction, confidence

function pre_fuse_log_record(log_record, data_page_id):
  // Call predict_next_change to get predicted changes
  next_change, confidence = predict_next_change(data_page_id)

  // If confidence exceeds threshold:
  if confidence > threshold:
    // Create a placeholder record for the predicted change
    placeholder_record = create_placeholder_record(next_change)

    // Merge the original log_record with the placeholder_record
    fused_record = merge_records(log_record, placeholder_record)

    // Mark the fused_record as pre-fused
    fused_record.pre_fused = true

    return fused_record
  else:
    return log_record
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  A change occurs to a data page.
2.  The Change Frequency Monitor updates the change rate for that page.
3.  The system determines the appropriate log granularity based on the current change rate and the Granularity Adjustment Policy.
4.  The Predictive Fusion Engine attempts to pre-fuse the log record with a placeholder for a predicted subsequent change.
5.  The (potentially fused) log record is written to the log-structured data store.
6.  If a pre-fused record is written, the system awaits the subsequent change to finalize the fusion.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced log size due to adaptive granularity.
*   Improved reconciliation performance by proactively fusing records.
*   Optimized storage utilization.
*   Greater flexibility in tuning the system for different workloads.
