## Adaptive Remediation Orchestration via Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the automated remediation system to *proactively* shift load *away* from computing devices predicted to require remediation, utilizing a predictive model based on historical metrics and current system load. This differs from reactive remediation; it's preventative, aiming to *avoid* impairment by preemptively distributing workload.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Load Balancer (PLB) – a new module integrated within the existing computing node infrastructure.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical Metrics: Error rates, resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O), latency – collected from all computing devices over time (as already exists within the patent).
    *   Real-time Metrics: Current resource utilization, request rates, and preliminary error indicators from each computing device.
    *   Remediation Logs: Records of past impairments and the remediations applied (as per claim 9-11).
*   **Model:**  A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) trained on historical data. The model predicts the probability of impairment for each computing device over a short time horizon (e.g., next 5-15 minutes). This incorporates both individual device history and correlated behavior across the platform.
*   **Load Shifting Mechanism:** An intelligent load balancer that dynamically distributes incoming requests.
    *   When the predictive model identifies a device with a high probability of impairment, the PLB reduces the number of new requests routed to that device.
    *   Requests are redistributed to healthy devices with available capacity.
    *   The redistribution prioritizes minimizing overall latency and maximizing throughput.
*   **Remediation Trigger Adjustment:** The system adjusts the thresholds that trigger remediation operations based on PLB activity. If the PLB consistently deflects load from a device *before* an impairment is detected, the threshold for that device is raised. This prevents unnecessary remediation attempts. Conversely, if the PLB fails to prevent an impairment, the threshold is lowered.
*   **Feedback Loop:** PLB activity, predicted vs. actual impairment rates, and remediation effectiveness are all logged and used to retrain the predictive model and refine the load balancing algorithms.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Each computing node runs this periodically (e.g., every minute)
function predict_impairment_probability(node_id) {
  // Fetch historical metrics for node_id
  history = get_historical_metrics(node_id);

  // Fetch real-time metrics for node_id
  realtime = get_realtime_metrics(node_id);

  // Run the time-series forecasting model
  probability = forecasting_model.predict(history, realtime);

  return probability;
}

function adjust_load_balancing(node_id, probability) {
  if (probability > threshold) {
    // Reduce the number of new requests routed to node_id
    load_balancer.reduce_load(node_id, reduction_factor);

    // Redistribute requests to healthy nodes
    load_balancer.redistribute_load(healthy_nodes);
  } else {
    // Restore normal load balancing for node_id
    load_balancer.restore_load(node_id);
  }
}

// Main loop
for each node in computing_nodes {
  probability = predict_impairment_probability(node.id);
  adjust_load_balancing(node.id, probability);
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond reactive remediation, proactively preventing impairments by strategically shifting load. The integration of predictive modeling and dynamic load balancing offers a more robust and efficient approach to maintaining system health. This isn't just about fixing problems; it's about *avoiding* them in the first place.
