## Dynamic Resource Shaping via Predictive Load

**Concept:** Extend the sub-account compartmentalization to proactively shape compute resources *before* demand spikes, leveraging predictive analytics based on historical usage patterns *within* the sub-account. This goes beyond simple provisioning; it anticipates need and pre-allocates/deallocates resources in a fluid manner.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Engine Module:**

*   **Input:** Time-series data of resource utilization (CPU, Memory, Storage, Network I/O) for *each* sub-account. This data is sampled at configurable intervals (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes). Historical data is stored for a configurable period (e.g., 30 days, 90 days).
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a combination of time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM neural networks).  The system automatically selects and tunes the best model for each sub-account based on cross-validation against historical data.
*   **Output:** Predicted resource demand for the next X minutes/hours (configurable).  Output includes:
    *   Base Load: Expected minimum resource utilization.
    *   Peak Load: Expected maximum resource utilization.
    *   Ramp-Up/Ramp-Down Rate: Rate of change in resource demand.
    *   Confidence Interval:  Probability that the prediction falls within a certain range.

**2. Dynamic Resource Manager Module:**

*   **Input:** Predicted resource demand from the Predictive Engine. Configurable policies defining acceptable risk levels (e.g., tolerance for under-provisioning vs. over-provisioning).  Available resource pool capacity.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Proactive Scaling:**  Based on predicted demand and configured policies, the Dynamic Resource Manager preemptively allocates/deallocates resources to/from the sub-account. 
    *   **Resource Shaping:** Instead of simply scaling up/down *entire* VMs/containers, resources are *shaped* by adjusting CPU limits, memory allocations, and IOPS. This allows for finer-grained control and reduces the overhead of VM/container creation/destruction.
    *   **Resource Borrowing:** If a sub-account has temporarily low demand, its unused resources can be *borrowed* by other sub-accounts experiencing higher demand, subject to defined policies and security constraints.  Borrowed resources are automatically returned when demand in the originating sub-account increases.
    *   **Real-Time Adjustment:** Continuously monitor actual resource utilization and adjust allocations in real-time based on deviations from predicted demand.  Employ a feedback loop to improve the accuracy of the predictive model.

**3. Sub-Account Policies:**

*   **Minimum/Maximum Resource Limits:** Configure minimum and maximum resource limits for each sub-account to prevent runaway costs or performance degradation.
*   **Priority Levels:** Assign priority levels to sub-accounts. Higher-priority sub-accounts receive preferential access to resources during periods of contention.
*   **Resource Reservation:** Reserve a specific amount of resources for critical sub-accounts, ensuring that they always have sufficient capacity.
*   **Auto-Suspend/Resume:** Automatically suspend sub-accounts when they are inactive for a specified period, and resume them when activity is detected.

**4. API Extensions:**

*   `PredictResourceDemand(subAccountId, timeHorizon)`:  Returns predicted resource demand for a given sub-account and time horizon.
*   `AdjustResourceAllocation(subAccountId, cpuLimit, memoryLimit, iops)`: Allows administrators to manually adjust resource allocations for a sub-account.
*   `GetResourceBorrowingStatus(subAccountId)`:  Returns information about resources borrowed from/lent to other sub-accounts.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Resource Manager):**

```
function manageResources(subAccountId):
  predictedDemand = PredictiveEngine.PredictResourceDemand(subAccountId, timeHorizon)
  currentAllocation = ResourceAllocator.GetCurrentAllocation(subAccountId)

  scalingFactor = (predictedDemand.PeakLoad - currentAllocation.CpuLimit) / currentAllocation.CpuLimit

  if scalingFactor > threshold:
    ResourceAllocator.ScaleUp(subAccountId, scalingFactor)
  elif scalingFactor < -threshold:
    ResourceAllocator.ScaleDown(subAccountId, scalingFactor)

  borrowedResources = ResourceBorrower.CheckBorrowingOpportunity(subAccountId)
  if borrowedResources > 0:
    ResourceBorrower.BorrowResources(subAccountId, borrowedResources)
```
