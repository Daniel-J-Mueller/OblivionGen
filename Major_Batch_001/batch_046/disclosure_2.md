## Adaptive Propeller Vanes with Integrated Microfluidic Cooling & Morphing Surfaces

**Concept:** Expand upon the embedded imaging within rotating propeller blades, not for stereo vision, but for dynamic thermal management and aerodynamic optimization via microfluidics and morphing surfaces.

**Specifications:**

*   **Blade Material:** Carbon fiber composite with embedded microchannels (approx. 0.5-1mm diameter) forming a closed-loop fluidic network. Channels are patterned to maximize surface area contact with blade exterior.
*   **Coolant:** Dielectric microfluid containing nanoparticles for enhanced thermal conductivity.
*   **Microfluidic Pump:** Miniature piezoelectric pump integrated into propeller hub. Controlled by flight computer. Flow rate adjustable based on blade temperature and rotational speed.
*   **Temperature Sensors:** Array of micro-thermocouples embedded within blade structure, communicating wirelessly to flight computer.
*   **Morphing Surface Actuators:** Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) micro-actuators integrated *beneath* the blade surface. Actuators arranged in a grid pattern.
*   **SMA Control:** Flight computer analyzes thermal data, aerodynamic load (calculated from flight parameters), and imaging data (see “Integrated Imaging” below) to control individual SMA actuator activation.
*   **Integrated Imaging:** Replace standard cameras with hyperspectral imagers. These imagers will analyze airflow over the blade surface, detecting localized turbulence, ice formation, or leading edge erosion. Data used to refine SMA control and microfluidic coolant flow.
*   **Power:** Wireless power transfer from central flight computer to blade-mounted sensors and actuators. Inductive coupling within propeller hub.
*   **Hub Integration:** Propeller hub incorporates:
    *   Microfluidic reservoir.
    *   Piezoelectric pump driver.
    *   Wireless power transmitter.
    *   Data communication module.

**Pseudocode (SMA Control Loop):**

```
LOOP:
  FOR EACH SMA Actuator:
    IF (TurbulenceDetected(ActuatorLocation) OR IceDetected(ActuatorLocation) OR ExcessiveHeat(ActuatorLocation)):
      Activate(ActuatorLocation, Intensity);  // Adjust blade surface curvature
    ELSE:
      Deactivate(ActuatorLocation);
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  AdjustCoolantFlowRate(AverageBladeTemperature);
ENDLOOP
```

**Function Definitions (Example):**

```
TurbulenceDetected(location):
  // Analyze hyperspectral image data for airflow anomalies at specified location.
  // Returns TRUE if turbulence exceeds threshold.
  RETURN (TurbulenceLevel > Threshold);

IceDetected(location):
  // Detect ice formation based on thermal signature and/or visual analysis.
  RETURN (IceDetected == TRUE);

ExcessiveHeat(location):
  // Compare temperature reading at location to safe operating threshold.
  RETURN (Temperature > Threshold);
```

**Innovation Details:**

This system moves beyond *observing* the environment with embedded cameras to actively *controlling* the aerodynamic environment around the propeller.  Dynamic blade morphing reduces drag, mitigates icing, and optimizes lift in real-time.  Microfluidic cooling maintains blade structural integrity and prevents thermal fatigue.  Hyperspectral imaging acts as an 'eye' for airflow anomalies, providing feedback for the control loop. It is a self-regulating, optimized system for propeller performance and longevity.
