## Adaptive Error Injection & Chaos Engineering for Hosted Programs

**Concept:** Extend the debugging system to *proactively* induce errors in monitored program instances, allowing for stress-testing, failure analysis, and the discovery of edge cases *before* they impact real users. This moves beyond passive monitoring to active probing of system resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Error Injection Profile Definition:**

*   **Profile Structure:** A JSON-based profile format defining error injection parameters.  Example:
    ```json
    {
      "profile_name": "NetworkLatencySpike",
      "target_instances": "10-20% of active instances",
      "injection_rate": "5 per minute",
      "error_type": "NetworkLatency",
      "parameters": {
        "latency_ms": "100-500",
        "packet_loss_probability": "0.01-0.05"
      },
      "duration": "15 minutes",
      "trigger": "Time-based", // Or, “CPU Load > 80%” etc.
      "severity": "Low" // Used for automated response
    }
    ```
*   **Error Types:** Supported error types: NetworkLatency, PacketLoss, CPUStarvation, MemoryCorruption (with controlled parameters), DiskI/O Delay, Invalid Input Data (with predefined payloads).
*   **Injection Targets:**  Instances can be targeted randomly, based on user profile, geographic location, or based on observed behavior (e.g., instances processing a specific transaction type).

**2. Chaos Engineering Engine Integration:**

*   **API Endpoints:** Expose API endpoints for creating, scheduling, and managing error injection profiles.
*   **Profile Scheduler:** Implement a scheduler that activates profiles at specified times or based on triggers.
*   **Error Injection Agents:** Deploy lightweight agents within each hosted program instance to intercept system calls and inject errors based on active profiles.  These agents should have minimal performance overhead.
*   **Instrumentation:** Agents automatically log the injection event, the affected instance, and any resulting system behavior (crashes, exceptions, performance degradation).

**3. Automated Response & Remediation:**

*   **Severity Levels:** Associate each error injection profile with a severity level (Low, Medium, High).
*   **Automated Actions:** Define automated actions triggered by detected errors, such as:
    *   Generating alerts.
    *   Rolling back problematic code changes.
    *   Scaling up resources.
    *   Restarting affected instances.
    *   Isolating compromised instances.
*   **Adaptive Injection:**  Dynamically adjust injection parameters (rate, duration, severity) based on observed system behavior. For example, if a system consistently recovers from a certain type of error, the injection rate can be increased.

**4. Debugging Integration:**

*   **Correlation:** Integrate error injection events with existing debugging data (logs, memory dumps, performance metrics).
*   **Reproducibility:**  Enable users to recreate specific error injection scenarios to facilitate debugging.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:**  Provide tools to help users identify the root cause of errors triggered by injection.

**Pseudocode (Error Injection Agent - simplified):**

```
On SystemCall(syscall_name, parameters):
  If active_profile != null And syscall_name in active_profile.target_syscalls:
    If random() < active_profile.injection_rate:
      If active_profile.error_type == "NetworkLatency":
        delay = random(active_profile.parameters.latency_ms_min, active_profile.parameters.latency_ms_max)
        SimulateNetworkDelay(delay)
      # Other error types...
      LogInjectionEvent(syscall_name, instance_id)
```
