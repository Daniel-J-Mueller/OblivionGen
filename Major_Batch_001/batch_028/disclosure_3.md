**Innovation Description:**

The system expands on the idea of panoramic image capture by introducing multi-spectral data acquisition to enable dynamic perspective correction and photorealistic relighting *within* the panorama.

1.  **Multi-Spectral Capture:** As the user pans the camera (similar to the reference patent), the system captures not only RGB and depth data but also polarization and (optionally) thermal information.

2.  **Material Classification:** The polarization data is used to classify materials within the scene.  Different materials reflect and polarize light in unique ways. A trained neural network identifies materials (e.g., glass, metal, wood, fabric) based on their polarization signature.  Thermal data can assist with identification, particularly for identifying heat sources or reflective surfaces.

3.  **Dynamic Perspective Correction (DPC):**  Instead of simply stitching images together based on feature matching, DPC uses the depth and material classification data to *reconstruct* the scene in 3D.  This allows for correcting perspective distortions caused by the camera's movement and the environment's geometry.  The system effectively 'unwraps' the scene as if viewed from a perfect, undistorted viewpoint.

4.  **Photorealistic Relighting:**  The material classification data is used to model how light interacts with different surfaces. The system can then simulate how the scene would look under different lighting conditions, effectively 'relighting' the panorama.  Users can interactively adjust the light source position, color, and intensity to create custom lighting effects.

**Pseudocode (Relighting Stage):**

```
function relightPanorama(panoramaImage, lightSourcePosition, lightSourceColor, lightSourceIntensity):
  // 1. Extract material map from panoramaImage
  materialMap = extractMaterialMap(panoramaImage)

  // 2. For each pixel in panoramaImage:
    pixelColor = getPixelColor(panoramaImage, x, y)
    material = materialMap[x, y]

    // 3. Calculate lighting contribution based on material properties and light source
    lightingContribution = calculateLighting(material, lightSourcePosition, lightSourceColor, lightSourceIntensity)

    // 4. Apply lighting contribution to pixel color
    newPixelColor = applyLightingToColor(pixelColor, lightingContribution)

    // 5. Set new pixel color in panoramaImage
    setPixelColor(panoramaImage, x, y, newPixelColor)

  // 6. Return relit panoramaImage
  return panoramaImage
```

**Novelty:** The combination of multi-spectral capture (polarization + optional thermal), material classification, and dynamic perspective correction offers a significantly more realistic and immersive panoramic viewing experience than traditional stitching methods.  The interactive relighting capabilities provide users with unprecedented control over the appearance of the scene.
