## Dynamic Multipath Group Creation & Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** The existing patent details load balancing *after* congestion is detected. This design proposes a system for *predictive* multipath group creation and dynamic adjustment based on observed traffic patterns and interface capabilities, moving beyond simple reactive re-routing. It’s about anticipating congestion *before* it impacts performance.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Traffic Analyzer (PTA) – Software module running alongside existing routing/congestion control.
*   **Data Input:** PTA receives real-time telemetry from network interfaces (bandwidth utilization, queue lengths, error rates) and historical traffic flow data (destination addresses, packet sizes, inter-arrival times). It also accesses interface capability data (max bandwidth, supported QoS features).
*   **Algorithm:** PTA employs a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM neural network) to predict future traffic load on each interface. It then calculates a ‘congestion risk score’ based on predicted load, interface capacity, and current utilization.  This score is continually updated.
*   **Dynamic Multipath Group Creation:**  When the congestion risk score for an interface exceeds a defined threshold, PTA initiates the creation of a new multipath group *before* actual congestion occurs. This involves identifying underutilized interfaces with sufficient capacity to absorb diverted traffic.
*   **Interface Affinity Mapping:**  The PTA maintains an “Interface Affinity Map” that dynamically assigns hash ranges to interfaces based on real-time capacity and predicted load.  This map is distinct from the existing static or reactive hash ranges.
*   **Traffic Steering:**  PTA interacts with the routing table to pre-program new routes utilizing the newly created multipath group and the Interface Affinity Map.  This happens *before* congestion, reducing latency and jitter.
*   **Proactive Route Adjustment:**  PTA continuously monitors the effectiveness of the new route and dynamically adjusts the Interface Affinity Map and traffic steering based on real-time feedback.
*   **Cost Function:** A cost function will be employed to select which interfaces become members of the new multipath group. The cost function factors in interface latency, bandwidth, and utilization.

**Pseudocode (PTA Module):**

```
Initialize:
    Load historical traffic data
    Load interface capabilities
    Set congestion threshold
    Initialize Interface Affinity Map

Loop:
    Collect real-time telemetry (bandwidth, queue length, errors)
    Predict future traffic load for each interface
    Calculate congestion risk score for each interface
    IF (risk score > threshold):
        Identify underutilized interfaces
        Calculate cost function for potential multipath group members
        Create new multipath group
        Update Interface Affinity Map with new hash ranges
        Add new route to routing table
    Update Interface Affinity Map based on real-time feedback
    Monitor route performance
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-speed network interfaces with accurate telemetry reporting.
*   Sufficient processing power to run the time-series forecasting algorithm and dynamically update routing tables.
*   Dedicated memory for storing historical traffic data and the Interface Affinity Map.

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond *reactive* load balancing to *proactive* congestion avoidance. The dynamic Interface Affinity Map, guided by a predictive algorithm, represents a significant departure from traditional static or simple reactive hash-based load balancing approaches. It also allows for finer-grained traffic steering based on real-time interface capabilities and predicted load. This system allows for expansion beyond ECMP/WCMP.
