## Dynamic Huddle Environments – Multi-Sensory Integration

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Module:** “Sensory Weaver” – a software module running on each participating device (first user device, second user devices).
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Devices must possess:
    *   Microphone array (minimum 4 mics for directionality).
    *   Ambient light sensor.
    *   Haptic feedback actuator (vibration motor).
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon support.
    *   Optional: Integrated or tethered aroma diffuser.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Modified peer-to-peer mesh network using BLE/Wi-Fi Direct, establishing direct device communication *without* relying on a central server for core functionality. Server access is supplementary for content/recommendation delivery.
*   **Data Streams:**
    *   Audio: Real-time ambient sound analysis and directional audio capture.
    *   Light: Ambient light level and color temperature.
    *   Proximity: BLE beacon signals indicate device proximity & relative positioning.
    *   Haptic:  User-defined haptic patterns.
    *   Aroma (optional): Scent profiles linked to recommendations.

**Functional Description:**

The “Sensory Weaver” module creates a shared “huddle environment” by synchronizing sensory feedback across devices.  It's more than just a visual/audio recommendation experience.  

1.  **Environment Capture:** Each device captures its ambient sound, light levels, and proximity to other devices.

2.  **Environment Modeling:** This data is used to build a simplified environmental model.  For example: “Dimly lit, moderate background noise, devices clustered around a coffee table”.

3.  **Sensory Mapping:**  The system maps recommendation types to corresponding sensory adjustments. 
    *   *Movie Recommendation (Action):* Increased vibration intensity, warmer light color, directional sound emphasizing bass.
    *   *Restaurant Recommendation (Italian):*  Subtle “garlic/herb” aroma diffusion (if hardware supports), warmer light, moderate ambient sound level.
    *   *Activity Recommendation (Hiking):*  Simulated wind sound (via directional speakers), cooler light color, subtle vibration mirroring footstep rhythm.

4.  **Synchronized Feedback:**  Sensory adjustments are *synchronized* across all participating devices to create a shared “feel” for the recommendation. All devices subtly adjust light, vibration, and sound to align with the recommendation's “atmosphere”.

5. **Influence Mapping:** Beyond just voting, the system analyzes *how* users react sensorially. Did a user increase the vibration intensity after a recommendation? Did they dim the lights further? This "sensory influence" is factored into the recommendation weighting, making the system even more personalized.

**Pseudocode (Sensory Weaver - Core Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    CAPTURE ambient audio, light level, proximity data
    ANALYZE data to determine current environment model
    RECEIVE recommendation data (item type, attributes)
    DETERMINE sensory mapping based on recommendation & environment
    CALCULATE sensory adjustment values (vibration intensity, light color, sound profile)
    APPLY adjustments to device’s output peripherals
    BROADCAST adjustment values to other devices in huddle
    RECEIVE adjustment values from other devices
    SYNCHRONIZE output based on received values (average/weighted average)
    MONITOR user sensory input (adjustments to device settings)
    UPDATE influence mapping based on user input
    REPEAT
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Emotional Analysis:** Integrate facial expression recognition (via device camera) to further refine the environmental model.
*   **Biofeedback Integration:** Use wearable sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) to dynamically adjust the sensory experience based on user emotional state.
*   **AR/VR Integration:** Overlay augmented/virtual reality elements onto the physical environment to enhance the immersive experience.
*   **AI-Driven Sensory Composition:** Use machine learning to create novel sensory mappings based on recommendation attributes and user preferences.
*   **Dynamic Aroma Generation**: Automated selection and blending of scent molecules, on-the-fly to match recommendation themes.
