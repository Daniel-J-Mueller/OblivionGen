## Dynamic Impression Weighting Based on User Engagement Signals

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust impression weighting within bid request forecasting, based on real-time user engagement signals. This expands beyond simple historical bid quantities and incorporates immediate feedback loops.

**Core Innovation:** The existing patent focuses on weighting historical data. This specification introduces a system that *actively* modifies impression weights during forecasting based on continuous user engagement metrics. Instead of static weighting, the system learns which impressions *actually* resonate with users, improving prediction accuracy and campaign ROI.

**System Components:**

1.  **Engagement Data Stream:** Collects real-time user engagement data including:
    *   Click-through rates (CTR)
    *   Dwell time on content (seconds)
    *   Scroll depth (percentage of content viewed)
    *   Video completion rate (percentage)
    *   Direct feedback (e.g., likes, shares, comments - if available)

2.  **Engagement Signal Processor:** Processes the raw engagement data, normalizing it and assigning weighted scores to each signal. The weighting is configurable and can be A/B tested for optimal performance.  Example:

    ```pseudocode
    function calculateEngagementScore(CTR, DwellTime, ScrollDepth, VideoCompletionRate):
      CTR_Weight = 0.3
      DwellTime_Weight = 0.4
      ScrollDepth_Weight = 0.2
      VideoCompletionRate_Weight = 0.1

      CTR_Score = CTR * CTR_Weight
      DwellTime_Score = DwellTime * DwellTime_Weight
      ScrollDepth_Score = ScrollDepth * ScrollDepth_Score
      VideoCompletionRate_Score = VideoCompletionRate * VideoCompletionRate_Weight

      EngagementScore = CTR_Score + DwellTime_Score + ScrollDepth_Score + VideoCompletionRate_Score
      return EngagementScore
    ```

3.  **Dynamic Weighting Engine:** Modifies impression weights based on the calculated engagement scores.  Weights are adjusted *during* the forecasting cycle, not just based on historical data.  This utilizes a feedback loop.

    ```pseudocode
    function adjustImpressionWeights(historicalWeight, engagementScore, learningRate):
      // Learning rate controls how quickly weights are adjusted
      weightAdjustment = learningRate * (engagementScore - averageEngagementScore)
      newWeight = historicalWeight + weightAdjustment

      // Ensure weights stay within reasonable bounds (e.g., 0 to 2)
      newWeight = clamp(newWeight, 0, 2)

      return newWeight
    ```

4.  **Forecasting Model Integration:** Integrates the dynamically adjusted impression weights into the existing forecasting model. This model then uses these updated weights to predict future bid request inventory and expected impressions.

5.  **A/B Testing Framework:** Continuously A/B tests different weighting configurations (engagement signal weights, learning rates) to optimize performance.

**Data Flow:**

1.  User interacts with content.
2.  Engagement data is captured and processed.
3.  Engagement scores are calculated.
4.  Impression weights are dynamically adjusted based on engagement scores.
5.  The forecasting model uses updated weights to predict future inventory.
6.  A/B testing framework evaluates and optimizes the weighting configuration.

**Novelty:**

*   **Real-time Feedback Loop:** Incorporates *immediate* user feedback into the forecasting process, unlike the patent which relies solely on historical data.
*   **Granular Weight Adjustment:** Adjusts impression weights based on specific engagement signals, allowing for finer-grained optimization.
*   **Adaptive Forecasting:** The forecasting model adapts to changing user behavior in real-time, improving prediction accuracy over time.
*   **Automated Optimization:** The A/B testing framework automates the process of finding the optimal weighting configuration.
