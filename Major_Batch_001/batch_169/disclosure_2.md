## Dynamic Handshake Policy Engine

**Concept:** Extend the handshake offload mechanism to incorporate a dynamic policy engine that governs *how* handshakes are performed, based on real-time client characteristics and threat intelligence. This goes beyond simply selecting a handshake server; it alters the handshake *process* itself.

**Specifications:**

*   **Policy Definition Language (PDL):** A declarative language for defining handshake policies. Policies can specify:
    *   Cipher suite prioritization (beyond standard TLS negotiation).
    *   Required certificate attributes (e.g., specific Certificate Authority, validity period).
    *   Client puzzle/challenge requirements (e.g., Proof-of-Work, CAPTCHA) â€“ tiered based on risk score.
    *   Rate limiting parameters (attempts per unit time).
    *   Handshake timeout values.
    *   Allowed/Disallowed TLS extensions.
    *   Integration with external threat intelligence feeds (blacklists, reputation scores).
*   **Real-time Client Profiling Module:** Collects data about the client during the initial connection attempt (before full handshake). This data includes:
    *   IP address & geolocation.
    *   User-Agent string.
    *   TCP/IP stack fingerprinting (passive OS detection).
    *   HTTP headers (if applicable).
    *   Initial request characteristics (e.g., request size, frequency).
*   **Risk Scoring Engine:** Combines client profile data with threat intelligence feeds and applies a weighted scoring algorithm to generate a risk score.
*   **Policy Selection Module:** Based on the risk score, selects the appropriate handshake policy from a pre-defined library.
*   **Handshake Orchestration Module:** Modifies the handshake process (via the handshake server) to enforce the selected policy. This may involve:
    *   Adjusting cipher suite order.
    *   Adding custom TLS extensions.
    *   Requesting additional authentication factors.
    *   Triggering client challenges.
*   **Policy Update Mechanism:** Allows policies to be updated dynamically without interrupting existing connections. Policies can be updated via a centralized management console or automated API.
*   **Logging and Auditing:** Comprehensive logging of all handshake events, including client profile data, risk score, selected policy, and any errors encountered.

**Pseudocode (Handshake Orchestration Module):**

```
function OrchestrateHandshake(clientConnection, clientProfile, riskScore) {
  policy = SelectPolicy(riskScore);

  if (policy.cipherSuitePrioritizationEnabled) {
    AdjustCipherSuiteOrder(clientConnection, policy.cipherSuiteOrder);
  }

  if (policy.requireClientChallenge) {
    challenge = GenerateClientChallenge(policy.challengeType);
    SendClientChallenge(clientConnection, challenge);
    WaitForClientResponse(clientConnection, challenge);
  }

  if (policy.requireExtendedAuthentication) {
     //Initiate MultiFactorAuth flow
  }
  
  //Proceed with standard TLS handshake
}

function SelectPolicy(riskScore) {
  //Logic to select policy based on riskScore
  if(riskScore > 90){
    return HighRiskPolicy;
  } else if (riskScore > 50){
    return MediumRiskPolicy;
  } else {
    return LowRiskPolicy;
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security by proactively adapting to evolving threats.
*   Reduced attack surface by tailoring handshakes to client risk.
*   Improved user experience by minimizing friction for legitimate users.
*   Increased operational agility through dynamic policy updates.
