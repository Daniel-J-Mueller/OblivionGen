## Adaptive Multi-Modal Contextual Routing

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple device interaction polling to incorporate real-time contextual data from *all* available sensors on the user's devices (and potentially external sources) to predict message relevance *before* delivery, then dynamically route based on predicted user state.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Acquisition Layer:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:**  Implement a background service on each user device capable of collecting data from:
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope: Motion/activity detection.
    *   Microphone: Ambient sound analysis (e.g., meeting, quiet environment).
    *   Location Services (GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth): Contextual location (home, work, gym).
    *   Screen State (On/Off, App in foreground): Current user activity.
    *   Network Connection (Wi-Fi, Cellular): Connectivity status.
    *   Bluetooth Proximity: Detect nearby devices (headphones, car system).
    *   Camera (Optional, User Permission Required): Scene recognition (e.g., indoors, outdoors, faces).
*   **Data Normalization & Feature Extraction:**  Standardize data formats and extract relevant features (e.g., activity type, sound level, location category).
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  All data collection requires explicit user consent and anonymization/encryption where possible.  Data retention policies are user-configurable.

**2. Contextual Prediction Engine:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer model to predict user "state" based on sensor data. State categories might include:
    *   "Focused Work": Low motion, quiet environment, work-related app in foreground.
    *   "Commuting":  High motion, transportation-related location, headphones connected.
    *   "Relaxing":  Low motion, quiet environment, entertainment app in foreground.
    *   "In Meeting":  Quiet environment, meeting-related app in foreground.
*   **Dynamic Model Updates:** Retrain the model periodically with new user data to improve accuracy. Federated learning techniques can be used to aggregate data from multiple users without compromising privacy.
*   **Relevance Scoring:**  Assign a relevance score to each message based on the predicted user state and message content.  (e.g., a work-related message receives a higher score when the user is in "Focused Work" state).

**3. Adaptive Routing Logic:**

*   **Multi-Device Priority:**  Instead of simply sending to the "most active" device, prioritize devices based on relevance score and predicted user engagement.
*   **Delivery Modalities:**  Dynamically adjust delivery modality based on user state:
    *   **Silent Delivery:** For low-priority messages when the user is in "Focused Work" state, deliver as a subtle notification (e.g., a small icon change).
    *   **Audible Delivery:** For high-priority messages when the user is in a relaxed state, deliver with sound and vibration.
    *   **Delayed Delivery:**  If the user is predicted to be unavailable (e.g., in a meeting), delay delivery until a more opportune time.
*   **Cross-Device Synchronization:**  Ensure that messages are synchronized across all of the user's devices, even if they are not delivered immediately.
*   **Routing Pseudocode:**

```
function routeMessage(message, userDevices, contextualData):
    userState = predictUserState(contextualData)
    relevanceScore = calculateRelevanceScore(message, userState)
    
    eligibleDevices = []
    for device in userDevices:
        deviceScore = device.interactionScore + relevanceScore + device.identityConfidence
        if deviceScore > threshold:
            eligibleDevices.append(device)

    if eligibleDevices is empty:
        log("No eligible devices found")
        return

    bestDevice = eligibleDevices.max(key=lambda device: device.score)

    if userState == "InMeeting":
        delayDelivery(message, bestDevice, delayTime)
    else:
        deliverMessage(message, bestDevice, deliveryModality)
```

**4.  Device Polling Adaptation:**

*   Transition from periodic polling to event-driven sensor data streams. Devices proactively push sensor data to the contextual prediction engine.
*   Reduce polling frequency to minimize battery drain.
