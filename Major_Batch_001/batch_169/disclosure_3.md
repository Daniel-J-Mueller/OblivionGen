## Adaptive Authentication Orchestration with Biometric Drift Compensation

**Concept:** Extend the failover mechanism by incorporating continuous biometric authentication drift compensation. Current systems rely on initial authentication and then potentially code-based linking for failover. This design proposes an ongoing, passively-monitored biometric validation layered *on top* of existing methods, adjusting security levels dynamically based on detected drift and utilizing federated learning to improve biometric model accuracy *across* user bases without directly sharing data.

**Specs:**

**1. Biometric Data Collection Module:**

*   **Input:** Continuous stream of biometric data (facial features, voice patterns, keystroke dynamics, gait analysis â€“ selectable by user/device capability). Data collection occurs passively during normal device operation.
*   **Processing:** Feature extraction (using on-device processing for privacy).  Feature vectors are timestamped and associated with a user session ID.
*   **Output:** Encrypted feature vector stream.

**2. Drift Detection Engine:**

*   **Input:** Encrypted feature vector stream, baseline biometric profile (established during initial authentication), drift threshold (configurable).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Calculate the Mahalanobis distance between the incoming feature vector and the baseline profile.
    *   Compare the distance to the drift threshold.
    *   Implement a rolling average of drift values to smooth noise.
    *   Categorize drift level:  'Nominal', 'Minor Deviation', 'Significant Deviation', 'Critical Deviation'.
*   **Output:** Drift Level indicator, Drift Score (numerical representation of deviation).

**3. Adaptive Security Orchestrator:**

*   **Input:** Drift Level, Current Authentication State (Native/Failover), Risk Profile (user-defined, device-defined, application-defined).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Nominal:** Maintain current authentication state.
    *   **Minor Deviation:** Increase logging and monitoring. Potentially trigger step-up authentication (e.g., PIN, pattern).
    *   **Significant Deviation:**  Initiate failover sequence (code-based linking).  Increase logging and monitoring.  Consider temporary account lockout.
    *   **Critical Deviation:**  Immediate account lockout.  Alert security administrators.
*   **Output:** Authentication State command (Maintain, Step-Up, Failover, Lockout), Logging directives, Alert notifications.

**4. Federated Learning Module:**

*   **Input:** Encrypted biometric feature gradients (calculated locally on each device), Global Model parameters (maintained centrally).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Each device calculates gradients based on its local biometric data.
    *   Gradients are encrypted and uploaded to a central server.
    *   The server aggregates gradients and updates the global model.
    *   Updated model parameters are distributed back to devices.
*   **Output:** Updated Biometric Baseline Profiles (for each device), Improved global model accuracy.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Differential privacy techniques applied to gradients to prevent data leakage.

**5.  Code-Based Linking Enhancement (Existing System Integration):**

*   If failover to code-based linking occurs due to biometric drift, the system will *also* request a live biometric scan *during* the code verification process.  This ensures that the user physically present is the legitimate owner.  This creates a layered security approach.
*   The code verification process is time-limited, and subsequent scans are required at progressively shorter intervals based on drift score.



**Pseudocode (Drift Detection Engine):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION CalculateMahalanobisDistance(featureVector, baselineProfile)
  // Calculate covariance matrix of baselineProfile
  covarianceMatrix = CalculateCovariance(baselineProfile)
  // Calculate inverse of covariance matrix
  inverseCovariance = InvertMatrix(covarianceMatrix)
  // Calculate difference between featureVector and baselineProfile
  difference = featureVector - baselineProfile
  // Calculate Mahalanobis distance
  distance = SquareRoot(Transpose(difference) * inverseCovariance * difference)
  RETURN distance
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION DetectBiometricDrift(featureVector, baselineProfile, driftThreshold)
  distance = CalculateMahalanobisDistance(featureVector, baselineProfile)
  IF distance > driftThreshold THEN
    RETURN "Significant Deviation"
  ELSE IF distance > (driftThreshold * 0.5) THEN
    RETURN "Minor Deviation"
  ELSE
    RETURN "Nominal"
  END IF
END FUNCTION
