## Delivery Area Beacon Network – Distributed Obstacle Mapping

**System Overview:**

A localized, mesh network of low-power, solar-powered beacons deployed within a delivery area (neighborhood, campus, etc.). These beacons supplement the UAV guidance system, providing hyper-local, real-time obstacle data *beyond* what the UAV’s onboard sensors can detect. This moves beyond simply identifying obstacles in the immediate flight path to creating a dynamic, collaborative understanding of the delivery environment.

**Beacon Specifications:**

*   **Dimensions:** 10cm x 10cm x 5cm (approximate)
*   **Power:** Solar panel (minimum 5W) with rechargeable battery backup (Lithium-ion, minimum 10Ah)
*   **Communication:** 802.15.4 (Zigbee or similar) mesh networking protocol.  Range: 30-50 meters per hop.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Low-resolution wide-angle camera (for basic shape detection – human, animal, vehicle, static obstacle) - 30fps
    *   Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor.
    *   Microphone array (for sound event detection - barking dog, children playing, vehicle approaching)
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction) – for refining UAV flight parameters.
*   **Processing:** Embedded ARM Cortex-M7 processor (or equivalent) for sensor data fusion and local data processing.
*   **Housing:** Weatherproof, UV-resistant plastic. Mountable on poles, fences, or trees.

**UAV Integration:**

1.  **Beacon Discovery:** Upon entering the delivery area, the UAV scans for active beacons.
2.  **Data Request:** The UAV requests a localized environmental map from the beacon network. This map includes:
    *   Static obstacle locations (trees, buildings, fences).
    *   Dynamic obstacle detections (people, animals, vehicles) – including estimated speed and trajectory.
    *   Wind conditions at ground level (critical for small UAVs).
3.  **Path Planning Adjustment:** The UAV’s path planning algorithm incorporates the beacon data to optimize the delivery route, avoiding obstacles and compensating for wind conditions.
4.  **Collaborative Mapping:**  The UAV contributes its own sensor data (from cameras, lidar, etc.) back to the beacon network, enriching the environmental map for other UAVs and future deliveries.
5.  **Beacon-Assisted Landing:** The beacon network can project augmented reality markers (visible through the UAV’s camera) to guide the UAV to a precise landing spot, even in low-light conditions.

**Pseudocode (UAV Side):**

```
function deliverPackage(packageID, destination) {
  // 1. Enter Delivery Area -> Scan for Beacons
  beaconList = scanForBeacons();

  // 2. Request Environmental Map
  environmentalMap = requestMap(beaconList);

  // 3. Adjust Path
  optimizedPath = pathPlanningAlgorithm(destination, environmentalMap);

  // 4. Fly Path
  flyPath(optimizedPath);

  // 5. Land & Deliver
  landAndDeliver(destination);

  // 6. Contribute Data
  contributeSensorData(beaconList, sensorData);
}

function contributeSensorData(beaconList, sensorData) {
  for each beacon in beaconList {
    sendData(beacon, sensorData);
  }
}
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Distributed Sensing:** Moves beyond centralized data sources (e.g., a single base station) to create a resilient and comprehensive understanding of the delivery environment.
*   **Collaborative Mapping:** Leverages the collective sensing capabilities of multiple UAVs to create a dynamic and evolving map.
*   **Hyper-Local Data:** Provides extremely precise data about obstacles and wind conditions, enabling safer and more efficient deliveries.
*   **Scalability:** The mesh network architecture allows for easy expansion and adaptation to different delivery areas.
