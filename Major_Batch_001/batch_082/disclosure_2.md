## Dynamic Thermal Zoning with Predictive Purge

**Concept:** Expand the regional control described in the patent to encompass *dynamic* thermal zones within each region, combined with a predictive purge system leveraging machine learning to anticipate thermal events *before* they necessitate a full purge.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Augmentation:**

*   **Micro-Sensor Network:** Deploy a dense network of micro-sensors (temperature, humidity, airflow) *within* each region. Sensor density: minimum 1 sensor per rack, ideally 4 (top, bottom, front, rear). Sensors transmit data wirelessly (e.g., Zigbee, BLE) to a regional data aggregator.
*   **Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) for All Fans:**  All supply and exhaust fans must be equipped with VFDs, allowing granular control of airflow rates.
*   **High-Resolution Thermal Cameras:**  Strategically placed high-resolution thermal cameras (IR) provide visual thermal mapping of each region.  These cameras feed data to the regional data aggregator, allowing visual confirmation of sensor data.
*   **Regional Data Aggregator (RDA):** A dedicated edge computing device per region to collect, process, and analyze sensor, camera, and VFD data.  This minimizes latency and bandwidth requirements.

**2. Software/Algorithm – Predictive Thermal Modeling (PTM):**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Implement a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) within the RDA. This model is trained on historical thermal data from each region.  Training data includes:
    *   Sensor readings (temperature, humidity, airflow)
    *   Rack power consumption (integrated with DCIM system)
    *   Ambient weather data (integrated with external weather API)
*   **Thermal Event Prediction:** The PTM predicts potential thermal events (e.g., hotspot formation, rack over-temperature) *before* they occur, based on current conditions and historical trends.  Prediction horizon: 5-15 minutes.
*   **Dynamic Thermal Zoning:** Based on PTM predictions, the RDA dynamically adjusts airflow to create virtual “thermal zones” within each region.  High-risk areas receive increased cooling, while low-risk areas receive reduced cooling.  This maximizes cooling efficiency and minimizes energy consumption.
*   **Predictive Purge Initiation:** If PTM predicts an unavoidable thermal event that requires a purge, it *preemptively* initiates a “soft purge”. This involves gradually increasing airflow and reducing rack power consumption *before* a full shutdown is necessary. This reduces the severity of the thermal event and minimizes downtime.

**3. Control Logic:**

```pseudocode
// Regional Data Aggregator (RDA) Control Loop

while (true) {

  // 1. Collect Data
  sensorData = readSensors()
  powerData = readPowerConsumption()
  weatherData = getWeatherForecast()

  // 2. Run Predictive Thermal Model (PTM)
  predictedThermalMap = PTM.predict(sensorData, powerData, weatherData)

  // 3. Dynamic Thermal Zoning
  for each rack in region {
    targetAirflow = calculateTargetAirflow(rack, predictedThermalMap)
    adjustVFD(rack, targetAirflow)
  }

  // 4. Thermal Event Detection & Soft Purge
  if (predictedThermalMap.hasCriticalHotspot()) {
    initiateSoftPurge(criticalHotspotRack)
  }

  // 5. Full Purge Trigger
  if (criticalTemperatureThresholdExceeded()) {
    triggerFullPurge()
    sendPurgeNotificationToMasterControlSystem()
  }

  sleep(10 seconds)
}
```

**4. Master Control System Integration:**

*   The master control system receives purge notifications from each RDA.
*   During a purge, the master control system limits controller output ranges in non-purging regions, as described in the original patent.
*   The master control system also receives real-time thermal maps from each RDA, providing a holistic view of the data center's thermal health.
*   The master control system analyzes historical purge data to identify patterns and improve purge strategies.

**5.  Material considerations:**
All sensor housing should be constructed of a thermally non-conductive material such as PEEK. All edge computing hardware should be passively cooled with custom heat sinks and a sealed chassis to prevent dust accumulation.
