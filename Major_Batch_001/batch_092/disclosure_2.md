## Dynamic Resource 'Shadowing' & Predictive Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the existing security notification system to proactively ‘shadow’ resource activity *before* a user flags a potential issue, and automatically implement mitigations based on predicted risk profiles.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadowing Engine:**

*   **Data Capture:** A system-level component intercepts all API calls relating to resource allocation, data access, and process execution for each client. This includes metadata like user ID, resource type, timestamps, and data transfer sizes.
*   **Baseline Creation:** Upon initial client connection, establish a ‘normal’ behavior baseline for resource usage. This baseline is a statistical model capturing typical patterns (CPU, memory, network I/O, data access locations).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Continuously compare live resource activity against the baseline. Employ statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, clustering, time-series analysis) to identify deviations exceeding predefined thresholds. Focus on *rate of change* rather than absolute values.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each anomaly based on:
    *   **Severity of Deviation:** Magnitude of the difference from the baseline.
    *   **Resource Type:**  Certain resource types (e.g., data storage, network access) have higher inherent risk.
    *   **Historical Data:**  Prior incidents associated with similar anomalies.
    *   **External Threat Intelligence:** Integration with threat feeds to identify known malicious patterns.

**2. Predictive Mitigation Engine:**

*   **Mitigation Profiles:**  Define a library of pre-configured mitigation actions, categorized by risk level and resource type. Examples:
    *   **Low Risk:** Logging, rate limiting, temporary access restriction.
    *   **Medium Risk:**  Resource isolation (e.g., containerization), data encryption, access key rotation.
    *   **High Risk:**  Resource shutdown, complete user lockout.
*   **Automatic Mitigation:** Based on the risk score, automatically trigger the appropriate mitigation action *before* user notification.  A ‘warm-standby’ approach: pre-allocate resources for isolation or rollback.
*   **User Notification (Enhanced):** When a mitigation is triggered, provide the user with:
    *   A detailed explanation of the anomaly and the mitigation action taken.
    *   Options to approve, reject, or modify the mitigation.
    *   A history of past anomalies and mitigations.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Utilize machine learning to refine the baseline models, risk scoring algorithms, and mitigation profiles based on user feedback and incident outcomes.

**3. Pseudocode (Mitigation Trigger):**

```
FUNCTION triggerMitigation(anomalyData):
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(anomalyData)
  IF riskScore > thresholdLow AND riskScore < thresholdHigh:
    mitigationProfile = selectMitigationProfile(riskScore, anomalyData.resourceType)
    performMitigation(mitigationProfile, anomalyData)
    logEvent("Mitigation triggered for user: " + anomalyData.userID + ", resource: " + anomalyData.resourceType)
    sendUserNotification(anomalyData, mitigationProfile)
  ELSE IF riskScore >= thresholdHigh:
    // Emergency shutdown - bypass user notification
    emergencyShutdown(anomalyData)
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION emergencyShutdown(anomalyData):
  // Shut down resources, revoke access, log event
  // No user interaction
END FUNCTION
```

**4.  Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance monitoring agents deployed on resource servers.
*   Centralized data processing and analytics engine (e.g., Spark, Hadoop).
*   Machine learning platform (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Secure communication channels between agents, analytics engine, and user interfaces.
