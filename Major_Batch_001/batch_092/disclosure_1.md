## Dynamic Micro-Preview Stitching & Generative Extension

**Concept:** Extend the micro-preview system beyond pre-edited content (trailers) to dynamically stitch together short, compelling previews *from the feature film itself* based on user preference, and then *generatively extend* those previews to fill desired durations.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Component: Scene Graph Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Full-resolution feature film (digital file).
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize computer vision and audio analysis to create a scene graph representing the film's content. Nodes represent individual scenes, tagged with attributes:
        *   **Visual Attributes:** Dominant colors, shot type (close-up, wide shot, etc.), presence of key objects/actors.
        *   **Audio Attributes:** Music genre, dialogue intensity, sound effects (explosions, laughter, etc.).
        *   **Emotional Tone:** Sentiment analysis of dialogue and music to determine scene mood (happy, sad, tense, etc.).
    *   Store the scene graph in a database optimized for rapid querying.

**2. Micro-Preview Generation Engine:**

*   **Input:** User preference data (from historical navigation/transaction data – as in the provided patent), desired micro-preview duration.
*   **Process:**
    *   Query the scene graph database based on user preferences.  Prioritize scenes matching preferred genres, actors, emotional tones, etc.
    *   Select a sequence of scenes that, when concatenated, approximate the desired duration.  Employ a "stitchability" score – favoring scenes with natural visual/audio transitions.
    *   Render the selected scenes into a preliminary micro-preview.
    *   **Generative Extension:** If the preliminary preview falls short of the desired duration:
        *   Analyze the last few seconds of the existing preview.
        *   Utilize a generative AI model (trained on a massive dataset of film footage) to create *new* footage that seamlessly extends the existing preview. The AI should be conditioned on:
            *   Visual style of the existing footage.
            *   Emotional tone of the existing footage.
            *   Narrative context (if discernible).
        *   Integrate the generated footage into the preview.

**3.  Dynamic Adjustment & User Feedback Loop:**

*   While the micro-preview is playing, track user behavior (pauses, rewinds, skips).
*   Use this feedback to refine the micro-preview generation algorithm in real-time.
*   Provide users with explicit controls to influence the preview creation process:
    *   "More Action" / "Less Action"
    *   "Focus on [Actor Name]"
    *   "Show Me Something Unexpected"

**Pseudocode (Micro-Preview Generation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateMicroPreview(userPreferences, desiredDuration):
  sceneGraph = LoadSceneGraph(featureFilm)
  relevantScenes = QuerySceneGraph(sceneGraph, userPreferences)
  selectedScenes = SelectScenes(relevantScenes, desiredDuration)
  preliminaryPreview = RenderScenes(selectedScenes)
  previewDuration = GetPreviewDuration(preliminaryPreview)

  IF previewDuration < desiredDuration:
    extensionDuration = desiredDuration - previewDuration
    generatedFootage = GenerateFootage(extensionDuration, preliminaryPreview)
    finalPreview = Concatenate(preliminaryPreview, generatedFootage)
  ELSE:
    finalPreview = preliminaryPreview

  RETURN finalPreview
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Scene Node:** {sceneID, visualAttributes, audioAttributes, emotionalTone, startTimestamp, endTimestamp}
*   **User Preference Profile:** {preferredGenres, preferredActors, preferredDirectors, dislikedGenres, dislikedActors}

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU for AI model training/inference.
*   Large-capacity storage for feature films and scene graph data.
*   Fast network connection for streaming video content.
