## Dynamic Package Mesh Networking & Predictive Delivery

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual tag-to-device communication to create a self-organizing mesh network *between* packages. This enables predictive delivery and localized anomaly detection.

**Specs:**

*   **Tag Hardware:**
    *   Ultra-Low Power (ULP) Bluetooth Mesh capable radio.
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope.
    *   Small haptic actuator (vibration motor).
    *   Passive RFID for initial identification/pairing.
    *   Battery life: >6 months (coin cell).
*   **Delivery Device (Handheld/Vehicle):**
    *   Bluetooth Mesh gateway/controller.
    *   High-precision GPS.
    *   Local processing unit.
    *   Display/Haptic Feedback.
*   **Cloud Backend:**
    *   Real-time location data storage.
    *   Machine learning model for predictive delivery.
    *   Anomaly detection algorithms.

**Operation:**

1.  **Network Formation:** Upon scanning, tags automatically form a mesh network, hopping signals between packages. The network dynamically routes data, optimizing for range and reliability.
2.  **Localized Positioning:**  Each tag estimates its relative position to neighboring tags based on signal strength (RSSI) and motion data (accelerometer/gyroscope). This creates a localized positioning system *independent* of GPS.
3.  **Data Aggregation & Routing:** Each tag transmits its estimated position and status data (e.g., "in transit", "stationary") to nearby tags, eventually reaching a designated “gateway” tag (determined dynamically based on proximity to the delivery device).  Multiple gateway tags can exist.
4.  **Delivery Device Integration:**  The delivery device scans for gateway tags and receives aggregated location and status data. The device displays a localized map of package locations relative to its own position.
5.  **Predictive Delivery:** The cloud backend utilizes historical data and real-time mesh network data to predict potential delivery issues (e.g., package left behind, incorrect sorting) *before* they occur.
6.  **Anomaly Detection:**  The system monitors for unusual behavior within the mesh network (e.g., a tag suddenly going offline, a package moving in an unexpected direction).  Alerts are sent to the delivery device.
7.  **Haptic Guidance:** The delivery device provides haptic feedback (vibration) indicating the optimal path to gather all packages. The intensity of the vibration increases as the device approaches a package.

**Pseudocode (Delivery Device):**

```
// Initialize Bluetooth Mesh connection
connectBluetoothMesh()

// Scan for gateway tags
gatewayTags = scanForGatewayTags()

// Get package locations from gatewayTags
packageLocations = getPackageLocations(gatewayTags)

// Display package locations on map
displayMap(packageLocations)

// Calculate optimal path
optimalPath = calculateOptimalPath(packageLocations, deviceLocation)

// Provide haptic guidance along optimal path
while (packageLocations.size() > 0) {
    nextPackage = optimalPath.getNextPackage()
    direction = calculateDirection(deviceLocation, nextPackage.location)
    vibrationIntensity = calculateVibrationIntensity(distanceToNextPackage)
    hapticFeedback(direction, vibrationIntensity)
    // ... continue until all packages are collected
}
```

**Novelty:** This shifts from simple tag-to-device tracking to a distributed, self-organizing network of packages. It adds a layer of redundancy and enables features like predictive delivery and localized anomaly detection, going beyond just confirming delivery. The haptic guidance adds a novel UX element.
