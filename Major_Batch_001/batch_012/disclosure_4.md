**Variable-Pressure Zone Planar Press with Dynamic Cushioning**

**Concept:** Expand upon the planar pressing concept by implementing a press with individually controllable pressure zones *and* dynamically adjustable compressible cushions. This allows for targeted pressure application and real-time defect correction during the pressing process, moving beyond uniform pressure and static cushioning.

**Specs:**

*   **Press Platform:** Planar press bed divided into a grid of individually controlled pneumatic actuators. Each actuator controls the pressure applied to a corresponding zone of the display stack. Grid resolution: minimum 1cm x 1cm, scalable to 0.5cm x 0.5cm.
*   **Cushion System:** Replace static compressible cushions with an array of small, independently controlled inflatable/deflatable chambers. These chambers form the interface between the press and the display stack. Chamber material: durable, chemically resistant elastomer. Chamber resolution matches the press platform grid.
*   **Sensor Integration:**
    *   **Pressure Mapping:** Integrate high-resolution pressure sensors beneath the chamber array to provide real-time pressure distribution feedback.
    *   **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** Incorporate an OCT sensor above the display stack during pressing to detect bubble formation, delamination, and adhesive layer thickness variations in real-time.
    *   **Strain Gauges:** Place strain gauges on the edges of the display stack to monitor stress distribution and prevent warping.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Algorithm:** Implement a closed-loop control algorithm that utilizes data from the pressure sensors, OCT sensor, and strain gauges to dynamically adjust the pressure applied by each actuator *and* the inflation level of each cushion chamber.
    *   **Defect Correction Modes:** Pre-program defect correction modes for common issues:
        *   **Bubble Removal:** Increase pressure locally over the bubble to collapse it, while simultaneously adjusting cushion height to prevent delamination.
        *   **Delamination Prevention:** Reduce pressure locally and increase cushion height in areas prone to delamination.
        *   **Adhesive Uniformity:** Dynamically adjust pressure across the stack to achieve a uniform adhesive layer thickness.
    *   **Data Logging:** Record all sensor data, actuator commands, and defect correction actions for process optimization and quality control.
*   **Heating System:** Integrated heating elements within the press bed, capable of precise temperature control (30-80°C).

**Pseudocode (Defect Correction – Bubble Removal):**

```
// Inputs:
//   bubble_coordinates (x, y) – Coordinates of the detected bubble.
//   pressure_map – Current pressure distribution across the press.
//   cushion_height_map – Current cushion height across the press.
//   max_pressure – Maximum allowable pressure.
//   max_cushion_deflation – Maximum cushion deflation.

FUNCTION correct_bubble(bubble_coordinates, pressure_map, cushion_height_map, max_pressure, max_cushion_deflation):
  // 1. Calculate pressure increase
  pressure_increase = MIN(max_pressure - pressure_map[bubble_coordinates], 0.1 MPa) //Limit pressure increase to 0.1MPa

  // 2. Calculate cushion deflation
  cushion_deflation = MIN(max_cushion_deflation, 0.05 m) //Limit cushion deflation to 5cm

  // 3. Apply pressure increase and cushion deflation to the specified zone
  pressure_map[bubble_coordinates] = pressure_map[bubble_coordinates] + pressure_increase
  cushion_height_map[bubble_coordinates] = cushion_height_map[bubble_coordinates] - cushion_deflation

  // 4. Monitor OCT data to verify bubble collapse
  IF bubble_still_present():
    //Repeat steps 3 & 4 with increased pressure/deflation
    correct_bubble(bubble_coordinates, pressure_map, cushion_height_map, max_pressure, max_cushion_deflation)

This system allows for *active* planar pressing, adapting to variations in the display stack and optimizing the pressing process in real-time.
