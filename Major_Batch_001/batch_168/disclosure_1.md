## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Personalized Presence Mapping

**Concept:** Expand on the user presence detection by creating dynamic acoustic zones within an environment and tying presence detection to personalized acoustic profiles. This allows for finer-grained presence detection and context-aware system behavior.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+) with beamforming capabilities.
    *   Low-power processor capable of running DNN models locally.
    *   Optional: Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio for supplementary localization data.
*   **Software - Core Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Zone Definition:**  User interface (app-based) to define acoustic zones within a space (e.g., "Living Room," "Kitchen," "Home Office").  Zones are defined spatially (via app or UWB mapping) and acoustically (by capturing a "zone fingerprint" - ambient noise profile).
    *   **Personal Acoustic Profiling:**  System learns individual user "acoustic signatures" â€“  not just speech, but subtle movement sounds, typing rhythms, even breathing patterns.  Captured during initial setup and ongoing learning.
    *   **Presence Mapping Engine:**
        *   **DNN Model 1 (Zone-Aware Presence):** Trained to identify human presence *within specific zones*. Input: Audio from each microphone, zone fingerprint, and potentially UWB data. Output: Probability of human presence in each zone.
        *   **DNN Model 2 (Personal Identification):** Trained to identify *which* user is present. Input: Audio from each microphone, user acoustic profiles. Output: Probability of each registered user being present.
        *   **Fusion Layer:** Combines outputs of DNN Model 1 & 2 for highly accurate presence mapping.
    *   **Contextual Action Trigger:** Based on presence map, triggers specific actions. Examples:
        *   Automatically adjust smart home settings (lighting, temperature) *per user*.
        *   Route calls/music to the zone where the user is located.
        *   Activate privacy modes when a user leaves a zone.
*   **Pseudocode (Presence Mapping Engine):**

```
// Input: Audio data from each microphone (audio_data[])
//        Zone fingerprints (zone_fingerprints[])
//        User acoustic profiles (user_profiles[])

// 1. Zone-Aware Presence Detection (DNN Model 1)
for each zone in zone_fingerprints:
    zone_audio = Filter audio_data for microphones in zone
    zone_presence_probability = DNN_Model_1(zone_audio, zone_fingerprint)
    zone_presence[zone] = zone_presence_probability

// 2. Personal Identification (DNN Model 2)
user_probabilities = {}
for each user in user_profiles:
    user_audio = Combine audio from all microphones
    user_probability = DNN_Model_2(user_audio, user_profile)
    user_probabilities[user] = user_probability

// 3. Fusion (combine zone & user data)
final_presence_map = {}
for each zone in zone_presence:
    for each user in user_probabilities:
        if zone_presence[zone] > threshold and user_probabilities[user] > threshold:
            final_presence_map[zone, user] = zone_presence[zone] * user_probabilities[user]

// Output: final_presence_map (dictionary of [zone, user] keys with presence probabilities)
```

*   **Refinement:** System continuously learns and refines acoustic profiles and zone fingerprints over time, improving accuracy.  Periodic "re-learning" cycles triggered by user activity or environmental changes.
*   **Privacy considerations:**  User data (acoustic profiles) stored locally and encrypted. Options for anonymizing or deleting data.
