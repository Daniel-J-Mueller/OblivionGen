## Dynamic Network Topology Reconstruction via Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the configuration propagation system to *proactively* rebuild network topologies based on predicted device failures, minimizing disruption and improving resilience. Instead of just reacting to changes, we’ll anticipate and pre-configure alternate paths.

**Specifications:**

**1. Failure Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with existing network monitoring systems to collect real-time data on device health metrics (CPU usage, memory utilization, interface errors, latency, packet loss). Also ingest historical failure data, vendor alerts, and potentially even external data sources (weather patterns impacting physical infrastructure).
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on the collected data. This model will predict the probability of failure for each network device within a specified time window (e.g., next hour, next 24 hours).  The model will output a "failure risk score" for each device.
*   **Thresholding:**  Define configurable thresholds for the failure risk score.  When a device’s score exceeds a threshold, the system initiates the topology reconstruction process.  Different thresholds can be defined for different classes of devices (e.g., core routers vs. edge switches).

**2. Topology Reconstruction Engine:**

*   **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to represent the network topology. Nodes represent network devices, and edges represent connections between them.  The database will store multiple versions of the topology, including the current active topology and proposed alternate topologies.
*   **Path Calculation Algorithm:** Implement a modified version of the Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate optimal alternate paths based on the predicted failure.  The algorithm will prioritize paths that minimize latency, packet loss, and utilize available bandwidth.  Consider incorporating Quality of Service (QoS) parameters into the path calculation.
*   **“Shadow” Topology Creation:** When a high failure risk is detected, create a “shadow” topology reflecting the proposed alternate paths.  This shadow topology is *not* immediately activated.

**3. Controlled Rollout & Verification:**

*   **Traffic Mirroring:** Redirect a small percentage of live traffic (e.g., 1-5%) to the shadow topology for real-time testing. This will allow us to verify the functionality and performance of the alternate paths without disrupting production traffic.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) on both the active and shadow topologies (latency, packet loss, throughput). If the performance of the shadow topology meets predefined criteria, proceed to the next step.
*   **Gradual Activation:** Incrementally increase the percentage of traffic routed to the shadow topology over a specified period (e.g., 5% per minute). This allows for a smooth transition and minimizes the risk of disruption.
*   **Automatic Failover:** If the predicted failure occurs, automatically and seamlessly switch all traffic to the pre-configured shadow topology.

**4. Configuration Propagation Integration:**

*   **Modified Command Instruction:** Extend the existing command instruction format to include information about the shadow topology and the activation schedule.
*   **Multi-Stage Propagation:** Implement a multi-stage propagation process. First, propagate the configuration for the shadow topology to all affected devices.  Then, propagate the activation schedule.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**  Implement a rollback mechanism to revert to the original topology if the predicted failure does not occur or if the shadow topology experiences issues.

**Pseudocode (Topology Reconstruction Engine):**

```
function reconstructTopology(device, failureRiskScore) {
  if (failureRiskScore > threshold) {
    shadowTopology = calculateAlternateTopology(device);
    propagateConfiguration(shadowTopology);
    mirrorTraffic(shadowTopology, percentage = 5);
    monitorPerformance(shadowTopology);
    if (performanceMeetsCriteria()) {
      increaseTraffic(shadowTopology, increment = 5, interval = 60);
    } else {
      revertToOriginalTopology();
    }
  }
}
```

This system goes beyond simply reacting to network changes. It aims to anticipate and proactively prepare for them, significantly enhancing network resilience and minimizing downtime.
