## Adaptive Failure Injection via Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive failure injection to *proactive* failure prediction and injection. Instead of simply inducing failures based on a schedule or random selection, the system learns normal operating patterns and predicts potential failure points *before* they manifest, then injects controlled failures to test resilience at those specific points. This moves beyond simply verifying recovery *from* a failure, to verifying the system’s ability to *anticipate* and *mitigate* impending failures.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Telemetry Collection:**
    *   Gather detailed telemetry from all computing devices participating in the distributed system. This includes:
        *   CPU utilization
        *   Memory usage
        *   Disk I/O
        *   Network latency & packet loss
        *   Application-level metrics (e.g., request rates, error counts, response times)
        *   System logs
    *   Telemetry should be time-stamped and correlated across devices.

2.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:**
    *   Employ machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, anomaly detection, recurrent neural networks) to establish baseline normal operating behavior for each metric.
    *   Models should be trained continuously with incoming telemetry data.
    *   The engine should calculate a “failure risk score” for each computing device and individual components based on deviations from baseline behavior.
    *   Risk scores should consider dependencies between components (e.g., a failing database impacting an application server).
    *   Models should identify potential "leading indicators" of failure (e.g., increasing disk latency preceding a disk failure).

3.  **Adaptive Failure Injection Controller:**
    *   Monitors the failure risk scores generated by the Predictive Modeling Engine.
    *   When a risk score exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the controller selects a target host device and determines the appropriate failure type to inject.
    *   Failure types are prioritized based on predicted impact and likelihood (e.g., a high-risk database server might receive a more aggressive failure injection than a low-risk application server).
    *   The controller dynamically adjusts the intensity and duration of the injected failure based on the system's response.  If the system recovers quickly, the failure intensity can be increased in subsequent tests.
    *   Injection types should include:
        *   CPU throttling
        *   Memory exhaustion
        *   Network packet loss/latency
        *   Disk I/O delays
        *   Service degradation/errors
    *   Integrate with existing failure injection mechanisms.

4.  **Recovery Validation Engine:**
    *   Monitors the system's response to the injected failure.
    *   Validates that recovery mechanisms (e.g., failover, replication, auto-scaling) are functioning as expected.
    *   Collects performance metrics during recovery (e.g., recovery time, data loss, impact on user experience).
    *   Generates reports detailing the results of the test.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Failure Injection Controller):**

```
function inject_failure():
  risk_scores = get_risk_scores()
  target_host = select_target_host(risk_scores)
  failure_type = determine_failure_type(target_host, risk_scores)
  intensity = calculate_intensity(target_host, risk_scores)

  inject_failure_on_host(target_host, failure_type, intensity)

  monitor_recovery(target_host)

  report_results()
```

**Novelty:** Current failure injection systems are largely reactive and rely on pre-defined schedules or random selection. This system introduces *proactive* failure injection based on predictive modeling, allowing for more targeted and realistic testing of system resilience.  The dynamic adjustment of failure intensity based on system response further enhances the realism and effectiveness of the testing.
