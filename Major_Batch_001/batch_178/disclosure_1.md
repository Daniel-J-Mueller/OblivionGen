## Dynamic Authentication Mesh via Biometric-Linked Ephemeral Keys

**Concept:** Establish a highly secure, continuously adapting authentication system leveraging biometric data, ephemeral keys, and a mesh network of trusted devices. This goes beyond static password-authenticated key exchange to create a 'living' security perimeter.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Client Device:** Standard computing device with biometric scanner (fingerprint, facial recognition, voice). Secure Element (SE) or Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for key storage.
*   **Server Device:** Robust server infrastructure with secure key management system.
*   **Mesh Nodes:** Low-power, Bluetooth/WiFi-enabled devices acting as authentication relays. These could be integrated into existing IoT infrastructure (smart speakers, security cameras, etc.).

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Biometric Enrollment Module:** Securely enrolls biometric data, creating a template stored *only* on the client device (never transmitted).
*   **Ephemeral Key Generator:** Generates a new, short-lived cryptographic key pair for each authentication attempt.
*   **Mesh Network Manager:** Establishes and maintains a secure mesh network between the client, server, and mesh nodes.
*   **Authentication Coordinator:** Orchestrates the authentication process, verifying biometric data, ephemeral key exchange, and mesh network integrity.

**3. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initiation:** Client requests authentication to server.
2.  **Biometric Verification:** Client performs biometric scan. If successful, a locally derived key is unlocked (or generated).
3.  **Mesh Node Discovery:** Client scans for nearby mesh nodes. 
4.  **Ephemeral Key Exchange (Client-Mesh):** Client establishes a secure, ephemeral key exchange with the *closest* mesh node. This key is unique to that session and node.
5.  **Relayed Key Exchange (Mesh-Server):** The mesh node relays a secure (encrypted) handshake to the server, using *its* established secure connection. The server does *not* directly communicate with the client until authentication is confirmed.
6.  **Server Verification:** The server validates the relayed handshake, confirming the integrity of the mesh network relay and the client's authentication.
7.  **Dynamic Trust Score:** Each mesh node maintains a "trust score" based on successful relay transmissions and network health. The system preferentially routes authentication requests through high-trust nodes.
8. **Session Key Establishment:** A session key is established between client and server for secure communication.

**4. Pseudocode (Client-Side - Simplified):**

```
function authenticate():
  biometricData = scanBiometrics()
  if biometricData valid:
    meshNodes = discoverNearbyMeshNodes()
    bestNode = selectBestMeshNode(meshNodes) // based on signal strength, trust score
    ephemeralKey = generateEphemeralKey()
    encryptedHandshake = encrypt(handshakeData, ephemeralKey)
    send(encryptedHandshake, bestNode)
    // Receive confirmation from server via bestNode
    if serverConfirmed:
      establishSessionKey()
      return true
    else:
      return false
  else:
    return false
```

**5. Novelty & Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Eliminates reliance on static passwords. Compromise of a single node doesnâ€™t necessarily compromise the entire system.
*   **Dynamic Adaptability:** Mesh network adapts to changing conditions and node failures.
*   **Biometric Integration:** Strengthens authentication by tying it to unique biometric data.
*   **Scalability:** Mesh network architecture scales easily to accommodate large numbers of devices.
*   **Defense-in-Depth:** Layered security approach, combining biometric authentication, ephemeral key exchange, and mesh network resilience.
