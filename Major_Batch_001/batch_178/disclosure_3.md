## Network Path Sonar - Active Router Fingerprinting

**Concept:** Extend latency-based detection to *actively* map router behaviors along potential covert paths by injecting deliberately perturbed packets and analyzing the resulting latency variations. This allows for a more granular understanding of router characteristics and the identification of routers exhibiting anomalous behavior suggestive of intentional redirection or covert channel activity.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** “Path Sonar” – a software module integrated into network devices (routers, firewalls) or deployed as a dedicated network monitoring appliance.
*   **Packet Perturbation Engine:**
    *   Generates duplicate packets destined for a known, monitored endpoint.
    *   Applies subtle variations to packet header fields (TTL, DSCP, IP/TCP flags, minimal payload alterations).  Variations are pseudo-random, with configurable ranges and seed values.
    *   Sends perturbed packets via multiple, potentially parallel paths (e.g., using ECMP).
*   **Latency Analysis Engine:**
    *   Measures round-trip time (RTT) for each packet variation.
    *   Calculates a “Behavioral Signature” for each router along the path. This signature is a vector of latency deviations caused by specific packet perturbations. Deviation is calculated as the difference between observed latency and a baseline latency (established using unperturbed packets).
    *   Employs a statistical anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify routers with signatures significantly deviating from the expected norm.
*   **Router Fingerprinting Database:**
    *   Maintains a database of Behavioral Signatures for known routers. This database is populated through initial profiling and continuous learning.
    *   Enables identification of unknown or rogue routers exhibiting suspicious behavior.
*   **Dynamic Path Adjustment:**
    *   Based on anomaly detection, Path Sonar can dynamically adjust routing paths to avoid suspicious routers.
    *   Provides real-time alerts to network administrators.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Anomaly Detection):**

```
// For each received response
calculate_latency(response)

// Get baseline latency for this destination
baseline_latency = get_baseline_latency(destination)

// Calculate deviation from baseline
deviation = calculate_latency(response) - baseline_latency

// Get router along path for this response
router = get_router_from_path(response)

// Get vector of behavioral signatures for this router from database
signature_vector = get_signature_vector(router)

// Calculate distance between observed deviation and signature_vector
distance = calculate_distance(deviation, signature_vector)

// If distance exceeds threshold
if (distance > threshold)
    flag_router_as_suspicious(router)
    log_event(router, deviation, distance)

// Update signature_vector with new deviation (learning)
update_signature_vector(router, deviation)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires sufficient processing power to perform real-time latency analysis.
*   Requires high-resolution timers for accurate latency measurements.
*   Network interface cards with hardware timestamping capabilities are beneficial.
