**Adaptive Network Persona System**

**Concept:** Extend the beacon’s role beyond simple authentication and policy enforcement to create and manage dynamic “network personas” for devices. These personas represent varying levels of trust and access tailored to the *context* of the network connection, not just the device itself.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Profiles:** Define a range of personas (e.g., "Guest," "Employee - Basic," "Employee - Privileged," "Admin"). Each persona has a defined set of:
    *   Access Control Lists (ACLs) – specific resources accessible.
    *   Encryption Policies – level of encryption for data in transit/at rest.
    *   Bandwidth Allocation – priority and limits.
    *   Application Restrictions – allowed/blocked applications.
    *   Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) Rules - sensitivity of data permitted to be transferred.
*   **Contextual Awareness Engine:** The beacon continuously gathers contextual information:
    *   Network Location (WiFi SSID, IP range, geo-location).
    *   Time of Day.
    *   Connected Devices (MAC addresses, device types).
    *   User Activity (application usage, data transfer patterns).
    *   Threat Intelligence Feeds (known malicious IPs, botnet activity).
*   **Dynamic Persona Assignment:** Based on the contextual information, the beacon dynamically assigns a persona to each connected device.  This is *not* static – personas can change in real-time.
*   **Persona Broker API:** A standardized API that applications can use to query the current persona of the connected device.  This allows applications to adapt their behavior accordingly (e.g., a file sharing app might limit upload speeds for "Guest" personas).
*   **Behavioral Analysis & Persona Adjustment:** The system learns from device behavior. Deviations from expected behavior (e.g., a "Guest" device attempting to access sensitive data) trigger adjustments to the assigned persona, potentially downgrading access or triggering alerts.
*   **Beacon-Driven Virtual Network Segmentation:**  The beacon enforces virtual network segmentation based on personas.  Devices with different personas are effectively isolated from each other, minimizing the impact of security breaches.

**Pseudocode (Beacon Logic):**

```
function processDeviceConnection(device):
  context = gatherContext(device)
  persona = determinePersona(context)
  applyPersonaPolicies(device, persona)
  monitorDeviceBehavior(device, persona)

function determinePersona(context):
  if context.location == "Public WiFi":
    return "Guest"
  elif context.user == "Employee" and context.time > 9 and context.time < 17:
    return "Employee - Basic"
  elif context.user == "Admin":
    return "Admin"
  else:
    return "Default"

function applyPersonaPolicies(device, persona):
  // Apply ACLs, encryption settings, bandwidth limits, etc.
  // based on the assigned persona
  device.acl = persona.acl
  device.encryption = persona.encryption
  device.bandwidth = persona.bandwidth

function monitorDeviceBehavior(device, persona):
  // Track device activity and compare it to expected behavior
  if device.activity deviates from persona.expected_behavior:
    downgradePersona(device, "Restricted")
    alertAdmin("Suspicious activity detected")
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Powered Persona Creation:** Use machine learning to automatically create and refine personas based on network traffic patterns and user behavior.
*   **Integration with Identity Providers:**  Link personas to user identities from existing identity providers (e.g., Active Directory).
*   **Gamified Security:**  Reward users for adhering to security policies associated with their personas.
