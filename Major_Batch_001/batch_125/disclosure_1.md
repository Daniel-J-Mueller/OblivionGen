## Dynamic Dimensionality Shards

**Concept:** Extend the hybrid storage approach to support datasets where the *number of dimensions* isn't fixed at ingestion. Allow dimensions to be added or removed dynamically, sharding data across different dimensional subsets.

**Specs:**

1.  **Dimensional Metadata Layer:** A metadata store maintaining a mapping between data shards and active dimensions. This layer tracks which dimensions are present in each shard.
2.  **Shard Creation Policy:** Define policies governing shard creation based on dimensionality. Options:
    *   **Fixed Dimensionality Shards:** Create shards with a predetermined maximum number of dimensions. When a dimension is added, new shards are created incorporating the new dimension, duplicating data as necessary.
    *   **Variable Dimensionality Shards:** Allow shards to grow in dimensionality up to a specified limit. This requires a flexible data structure within the shard to accommodate new dimensions.
    *   **Dimensionality-Aware Sharding:**  Analyze data distribution across existing dimensions and shard based on minimizing the impact of adding/removing a dimension on shard size/query performance.
3.  **Columnar Data Structure Extension:** Modify the columnar data structure to support sparse dimensions. Use bitmasks to indicate which dimensions are present in a row, reducing storage overhead for unused dimensions. Implement efficient bitwise operations for filtering and accessing relevant data.
4.  **Query Planner Adaptation:** Modify the query planner to leverage dimensional metadata and bitmasks.
    *   Determine the minimum set of shards required to satisfy a query based on the dimensions involved.
    *   Optimize query execution by filtering out irrelevant columns (dimensions) within each shard.
5.  **Data Migration Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism for migrating data between shards when dimensions are added or removed.
    *   **Splitting:** Split existing shards to accommodate new dimensions or reduce the dimensionality of others.
    *   **Merging:** Merge shards to consolidate data across dimensional subsets.
    *   **Replication:**  Replicate data across shards to support multiple dimensional views.

**Pseudocode (Shard Splitting):**

```
function split_shard(shard_id, new_dimension):
  // Create a new shard
  new_shard_id = create_new_shard()

  // Copy data from old shard to new shard, including the new dimension
  for each row in old_shard:
    new_row = row.copy()
    new_row.add_dimension(new_dimension)
    new_shard.add_row(new_row)

  // Update dimensional metadata
  add_dimension_to_shard(new_shard_id, new_dimension)

  // Optionally, migrate rows without the new dimension to the old shard

  return new_shard_id
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Sensor data with varying feature sets.
*   Evolving data models in scientific research.
*   Dynamic dashboards with customizable dimensions.
*   Machine learning feature stores where features are added and removed over time.
