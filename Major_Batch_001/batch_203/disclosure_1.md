## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predictive Load & User Behavior

**Concept:** Extend the prioritization-based scaling concept to *proactively* adjust resources not just on current load, but on *predicted* load derived from user behavior patterns and external data sources. This goes beyond reactive scaling to anticipatory resource management.

**Specs:**

**1. User Behavior Profiler (UBP):**

*   **Input:** Raw user activity logs (API calls, data access, UI interactions), time-series data.
*   **Processing:** Employ time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future user activity. Identify behavioral patterns, anomalies, and seasonality.  Categorize users into profiles (e.g., “Power User”, “Occasional Viewer”, “Batch Processor”).
*   **Output:**  Predicted load profiles for each user/user category, confidence intervals, and identified behavioral anomalies. These are expressed as predicted resource demand (CPU, memory, I/O, network).

**2. External Data Integrator (EDI):**

*   **Input:**  External data feeds (news events, social media trends, economic indicators, weather data, competitor activity).
*   **Processing:**  Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify events that may influence resource demand (e.g., a major news event driving website traffic).  Map external events to predicted resource impact (e.g., “Breaking News” event = +20% website traffic = +X% resource demand).
*   **Output:**  Predicted resource demand adjustments based on external events, with associated confidence levels.

**3. Predictive Resource Allocator (PRA):**

*   **Input:** Output from UBP, EDI, and current resource utilization metrics.  Existing scaling policies (from the original patent).
*   **Processing:**  Combine predicted load (UBP + EDI) with current resource utilization.  Weight predictions based on confidence levels.  Dynamically adjust scaling policies based on predictive load. Implement a "resource reservation" system – proactively allocate resources in anticipation of demand, rather than solely reacting to it. Incorporate a cost optimization algorithm – balance resource allocation with cost considerations (e.g., using cheaper resources during off-peak hours).  Introduce a "graceful degradation" strategy – if predicted demand exceeds available resources, prioritize critical services and gracefully degrade non-essential functionality.
*   **Output:** Modified scaling policies, resource allocation instructions, and alerts for potential resource constraints.

**Pseudocode (PRA Core Logic):**

```
function calculate_resource_allocation(current_utilization, predicted_load, scaling_policies):
  predicted_demand = current_utilization + predicted_load
  
  //Apply scaling policies to base demand
  adjusted_demand = apply_scaling_policies(predicted_demand, scaling_policies)

  //Resource Reservation: Reserve resources in advance
  reserved_resources = calculate_reservation(adjusted_demand, reservation_factor) // reservation_factor is a configurable parameter

  //Cost Optimization: select cost effective resources
  optimized_resources = select_cost_effective_resources(reserved_resources, cost_model)

  //Graceful Degradation: identify non essential functionality
  degraded_functionality = identify_degradable_functionality(optimized_resources, degradation_threshold)

  return optimized_resources, degraded_functionality
```

**4. Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**

*   Continuously monitor actual resource utilization and compare it to predicted values.
*   Use the discrepancy between prediction and reality to refine the prediction models (UBP & EDI) using machine learning techniques.
*   Dynamically adjust the weighting of predictions based on historical accuracy.

**Novelty:** This extends the existing prioritization framework by adding a predictive layer. It moves beyond reactive scaling to proactive resource management, optimizing resource allocation based on *anticipated* demand, and building learning mechanisms to improve accuracy over time.  The addition of cost optimization and graceful degradation provides a more robust and user-friendly system.
