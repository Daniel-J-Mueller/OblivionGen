**Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & Pre-Provisioning**

**Core Concept:** Leveraging machine learning to predict network topology changes *before* they occur, and proactively pre-provisioning dedicated paths based on these predictions. This builds on the patent’s concept of dynamic connectivity but shifts from *reacting* to changes to *anticipating* them.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Topology Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Data Sources:** Real-time network telemetry (latency, bandwidth usage, packet loss), historical network change logs (planned maintenance, failovers), external data feeds (weather, major events).
    *   **ML Model:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) variant. Trained on the combined data sources.  Output: Probability distribution of likely network topology changes (e.g., link failures, capacity bottlenecks) within a specified time window (e.g., next 15 minutes, next hour).  Confidence thresholds for triggering pre-provisioning.
    *   **Granularity:** Predict changes at the level of individual links/paths, data center interconnection points, and even at the router/switch port level.

2.  **Pre-Provisioning Manager:**
    *   **Input:** Probability distribution of likely network topology changes from the Topology Prediction Engine.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   If the predicted probability of a topology change exceeding a defined threshold (configurable per link/path/datacenter).
        *   Determine the *most likely* alternate path(s) to maintain connectivity. This is crucial and demands a rapidly adaptive graph-based routing algorithm.
        *   Initiate a pre-provisioning request for dedicated connectivity along the predicted alternate path(s).  Use the existing connectivity coordinator interface (from the patent).
        *   Monitor the actual network state. If the predicted change *doesn’t* occur, release the pre-provisioned resources after a defined timeout.

3.  **Resource Allocation Policy:**
    *   Define a budget for pre-provisioned resources (bandwidth, ports, etc.).
    *   Prioritize pre-provisioning for critical applications/services.  (Tie into application performance monitoring systems).
    *   Implement a cost-benefit analysis to determine which topology changes are worth pre-provisioning.

**Pseudocode (Pre-Provisioning Manager):**

```
FUNCTION preProvisionConnectivity(predictedTopologyChange, confidenceLevel)

    IF confidenceLevel > threshold THEN

        alternatePath = findBestAlternatePath(predictedTopologyChange)
        IF alternatePath != NULL THEN
            request = createConnectivityRequest(alternatePath)
            coordinatorResponse = connectivityCoordinator.requestConnectivity(request)
            IF coordinatorResponse.status == SUCCESS THEN
                provisionedResources[alternatePath] = coordinatorResponse.resourceID
                log("Pre-provisioned connectivity on path: " + alternatePath)
            ELSE
                log("Pre-provisioning request failed: " + coordinatorResponse.errorMessage)
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
    ENDIF

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION monitorNetworkState(actualNetworkState)

    FOR path IN provisionedResources:
        IF path NOT IN actualNetworkState:
            releaseResources(path)
            log("Released pre-provisioned resources on path: " + path)
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers for running the ML model and pre-provisioning manager.
*   Real-time network telemetry collection system.
*   Integration with existing network monitoring and management tools.
*   Scalable data storage for historical network data.
