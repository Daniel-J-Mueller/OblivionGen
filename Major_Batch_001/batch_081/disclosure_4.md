## Dynamic Focal Plane Adjustment for Panoramic Stitching

**Concept:** Extend the panoramic stitching process by dynamically adjusting the focal plane of each sensor *during* capture, not just before. This addresses depth-of-field limitations in wide-angle capture, resulting in sharper panoramic images, particularly for scenes with significant depth variation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Two (or more) image sensors with electronically adjustable focal planes (e.g., liquid lens technology, voice coil actuators controlling lens position).
    *   High-speed processing unit integrated with the control circuit capable of managing real-time focal plane adjustments and sensor data acquisition.
    *   Depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or Stereo Vision) integrated into the panoramic camera to provide real-time depth data of the scene.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Depth Map Acquisition:** The depth sensor continuously captures a depth map of the scene.
    2.  **Region of Interest (ROI) Analysis:** The control circuit divides the field of view of each sensor into multiple ROIs.
    3.  **ROI Depth Profiling:** For each ROI, the algorithm calculates the average depth or depth range.
    4.  **Dynamic Focal Plane Adjustment:** Based on the ROI depth profile, the control circuit adjusts the focal plane of each sensor *during* capture to optimize sharpness within each ROI. The adjustment happens on a frame-by-frame basis.
    5.  **Stitching with Per-ROI Sharpening:** The stitching algorithm takes into account the per-ROI focal plane adjustments. This can be done by applying a weighted sharpening filter to each region during the stitching process, or by utilizing a multi-resolution stitching approach.
    6.  **Transmission Frame Enhancement:** Include metadata in the transmission frame indicating the focal plane settings used for each region of the panoramic frame. This metadata can be used by the remote image processing system for further refinement.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Initialize depth sensor
Initialize image sensors (sensor1, sensor2)
Define ROI grid for each sensor

//Capture Loop
While (capturing) {
    //Get Depth Map
    depthMap = GetDepthMap()

    //For each Sensor (sensor1, sensor2)
    For Each (sensor) {
        //For Each ROI in sensor
        For Each (roi) {
            //Calculate average depth for roi
            averageDepth = CalculateAverageDepth(roi, depthMap)
            //Adjust Focal Plane based on averageDepth
            AdjustFocalPlane(sensor, averageDepth)
        }
        //Capture Frame
        frame = CaptureFrame(sensor)
        //Add frame to stitch buffer
    }

    //Stitch Frames
    panoramicFrame = StitchFrames(stitchBuffer)

    //Generate Transmission Frame
    transmissionFrame = GenerateTransmissionFrame(panoramicFrame, sensorSettings)

    //Send Transmission Frame
    SendTransmissionFrame(transmissionFrame)
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing panoramic stitching relies on fixed focal lengths. This dynamically optimizes sharpness *during* capture for improved image quality, particularly in complex scenes, and provides additional metadata for post-processing. This also allows for the capture of scenes which would otherwise be unusable due to depth of field limitations.
