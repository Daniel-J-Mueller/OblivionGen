## Adaptive Network ‘Shadowing’ via Beacon Mesh

**Concept:** Extend the beacon functionality beyond simple authentication and security policy enforcement to create a dynamic, localized network ‘shadow’ that provides enhanced privacy and security for user devices. This moves beyond verifying *a* network, to actively *creating* a secure layer *on top of* the existing network infrastructure.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Mesh Protocol:** Beacons communicate with each other via a low-latency, encrypted mesh network (Bluetooth Mesh, UWB, or similar) independent of the primary network.
*   **Dynamic VLAN Creation:** Upon successful authentication of a user device with a beacon, the beacon mesh dynamically assigns the device to a localized VLAN. This VLAN isolates the device's traffic from other devices on the network *even if* they are on the same subnet.
*   **Traffic Mirroring & Anomaly Detection:** Beacons passively mirror network traffic from authenticated devices. This mirrored traffic is analyzed locally within the mesh for anomalies (unusual traffic patterns, known malicious signatures, etc.).
*   **Localized Firewall Rules:**  Based on anomaly detection or pre-configured rules, the beacon mesh can dynamically apply localized firewall rules to the user device's traffic *without* requiring central network administrator intervention.  This can include blocking specific ports, redirecting traffic through a VPN, or simply logging suspicious activity.
*   **Beacon ‘Strength’ Signal:** User devices calculate a ‘beacon strength’ signal based on proximity and connectivity to multiple beacons in the mesh. This signal indicates the level of trust and security afforded by the network shadow. Displayed as a visual indicator on the user device.
*   **Ephemeral Network Identities:** Each session between a user device and the beacon mesh generates a unique, ephemeral network identity. This identity is used for all communication within the mesh, further enhancing privacy and preventing tracking.
*   **Device ‘Reputation’ System:**  A distributed reputation system is maintained within the beacon mesh.  Unknown or suspicious devices detected on the network are flagged, and their interactions with authenticated devices are monitored and potentially restricted.

**Pseudocode (User Device - Beacon Interaction):**

```
// User Device Boot/Network Scan
scanForBeacons()

// Beacon Found
if (beaconFound()) {
    authenticateWithBeacon(beacon)
    if (authenticationSuccessful()) {
        joinBeaconMeshNetwork(beacon)
        setSecurityState(secure)
        displayBeaconStrengthSignal()

        //Monitor Network Traffic
        monitorNetworkTraffic(beacon)
        detectAnomalies(beacon)
        enforceLocalizedFirewallRules(beacon)
    } else {
        setSecurityState(insecure)
        displayWarningMessage()
    }
} else {
    setSecurityState(insecure)
    displayWarningMessage()
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Beacons: Low-power processors, secure element for key storage, wireless communication module (Bluetooth Mesh, UWB).
*   User Devices: Compatible wireless communication module, software for beacon authentication and mesh integration.
