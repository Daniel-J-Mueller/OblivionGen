**Adaptive Sensory Contextualization for Browsing**

**Concept:** Extend persistent browsing contexts to incorporate and adapt to sensory data from the client device(s) – specifically, ambient light, sound levels, and even (optionally) basic biometric data (heart rate variability via camera). The server maintains a “sensory profile” alongside the traditional browsing context, influencing rendering and content prioritization.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensory Data Acquisition Module (Client-Side):**
    *   API access to ambient light sensor (lux).
    *   API access to microphone (decibel level – averaged/smoothed).
    *   *Optional:* Camera access for basic HRV estimation (requires user opt-in & clear privacy disclosures).
    *   Data is transmitted to the server as metadata alongside browsing requests, at a configurable frequency (e.g., every 5-10 seconds).  Transmission uses a lightweight protocol (e.g., WebSockets).  Data transmission is throttled based on network conditions.
2.  **Sensory Profile Server Component:**
    *   Stores sensory data (light level, sound level, HRV) associated with a browsing session ID.
    *   Implements a smoothing/filtering algorithm (e.g., exponential moving average) to reduce noise and provide a stable sensory representation.
    *   Allows configuration of “sensory rules” – mapping sensory conditions to rendering adjustments.
3.  **Rendering Adaptation Engine:**
    *   Receives sensory data from the Sensory Profile Server.
    *   Applies rendering adjustments based on configured sensory rules.  Examples:
        *   *Low Light:* Automatically switches website theme to dark mode, reduces brightness, increases contrast.
        *   *High Sound Level:* Highlights important notifications/alerts, potentially reduces animations/video autoplay to minimize distraction.
        *   *Elevated HRV (potential stress):* Simplifies page layout, removes non-essential elements, potentially offers calming content suggestions (e.g., guided meditations).
    *   Rendering adjustments are applied server-side, before sending the processed version to the client.
4.  **Context Sharing & Synchronization:**
    *   When a browsing session is transferred to a new client device (as per the original patent), the sensory profile *also* gets transferred.
    *   The new client device can optionally *contribute* its own sensory data to update/refine the profile.
    *   Conflict resolution: If sensory data from different devices is significantly different, prioritize data from the current active device.

**Pseudocode (Rendering Adaptation Engine):**

```
function AdaptRendering(processedVersion, sensoryData):
  lightLevel = sensoryData.lightLevel
  soundLevel = sensoryData.soundLevel
  hrv = sensoryData.hrv

  if lightLevel < 100:  // Low light
    processedVersion.theme = "dark"
    processedVersion.brightness = 0.7
    processedVersion.contrast = 1.2
  else:
    processedVersion.theme = "light"
    processedVersion.brightness = 1.0
    processedVersion.contrast = 1.0

  if soundLevel > 70:  // High sound level
    processedVersion.highlightNotifications = true
    processedVersion.autoplayVideos = false

  if hrv > 80:  // Elevated HRV
    processedVersion.simplifyLayout = true
    processedVersion.removeNonEssentialElements = true
    // Suggest calming content

  return processedVersion
```

**Data Structure (Sensory Profile):**

```
{
  sessionId: "unique_session_id",
  timestamp: "2024-10-27T10:00:00Z",
  lightLevel: 50,
  soundLevel: 60,
  hrv: 70,
  deviceInfo: {
    model: "iPhone 14",
    os: "iOS 17"
  }
}
```

**Privacy Considerations:**

*   Explicit user consent is required for collecting any biometric data (HRV).
*   Data is anonymized and aggregated where possible.
*   Users have the ability to disable sensory data collection at any time.
*   Data retention policies are clearly defined and communicated to users.
