## Dynamic Focal Plane Array for Panoramic Capture & De-Blur

**Specification:** Panoramic Camera System with Integrated Dynamic Focal Plane Array

**Core Innovation:** Rather than relying solely on post-processing de-blurring, actively manage motion blur *during* capture using a dynamically reconfigurable focal plane array.

**Components:**

*   **Multi-Aperture Camera Head:**  An array of miniature, high-speed cameras (minimum 9, ideally 16+), each with a dedicated lens and image sensor.  These are physically arranged in a hemispherical or near-hemispherical configuration.
*   **Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) Mirror Array:**  A corresponding array of individually controllable MEMS mirrors positioned *before* each camera lens. These mirrors will be the primary mechanism for controlling the effective focal plane.
*   **High-Speed Data Bus:**  A dedicated, low-latency data bus to transmit image data from each camera to the central processing unit.  Must support high frame rates (minimum 120fps, target 240fps+).
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  A high-precision IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope) to track camera motion in real-time. This is *critical* for predictive focal plane adjustment.
*   **Real-Time Processing Unit (RTPU):**  A dedicated, high-performance processor responsible for:
    *   Receiving IMU data.
    *   Predicting camera motion vectors.
    *   Calculating optimal mirror angles for each camera.
    *   Controlling the MEMS mirror array.
    *   Assembling the final panoramic image.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **IMU Data Acquisition:** The IMU continuously streams motion data to the RTPU.
2.  **Motion Prediction:** The RTPU uses a Kalman filter (or similar predictive algorithm) to extrapolate camera motion vectors for a short time window (e.g., 10-20ms). This window is determined by the camera's capture rate and expected speeds.
3.  **Focal Plane Mapping:** The RTPU calculates an optimal "focal plane map" based on the predicted motion. This map dictates the angle of each MEMS mirror. The goal is to redirect light from moving objects onto the corresponding image sensor, effectively "freezing" motion.  Objects moving rapidly across the array will receive corrective tilting from multiple mirrors.
4.  **MEMS Mirror Control:** The RTPU sends control signals to the MEMS mirror array, adjusting the angle of each mirror based on the focal plane map.
5.  **Simultaneous Capture:** All cameras capture images simultaneously.
6.  **Image Stitching & Blending:** The RTPU stitches the images from all cameras into a panoramic image. A blending algorithm is used to minimize artifacts and create a seamless panorama.
7.  **Refinement (Optional):** A post-processing de-blur algorithm can be applied as a final refinement step, but should be significantly less intensive than with traditional methods.

**Pseudocode (RTPU - Core Loop):**

```
while (true) {
  imuData = readIMUData();
  motionVectors = predictMotion(imuData);

  for (int i = 0; i < numCameras; i++) {
    mirrorAngle = calculateMirrorAngle(motionVectors, cameraPosition[i]);
    setMirrorAngle(mirrorAngle, i);
  }

  captureImages();
  panoramicImage = stitchImages();
  outputImage(panoramicImage);
}
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Active Motion Compensation:** Unlike post-processing, this system *prevents* motion blur during capture.
*   **Distributed Capture:** The multi-camera array provides redundancy and improves robustness to unexpected motion.
*   **Real-Time Performance:**  The system is designed for real-time operation, enabling live panoramic capture.
*   **Scalability:** The number of cameras and MEMS mirrors can be scaled to achieve higher resolution and wider field of view.

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-speed panoramic photography/videography
*   Autonomous vehicle vision systems
*   Surveillance and security cameras
*   Virtual reality/augmented reality capture
*   Scientific imaging (e.g., tracking fast-moving objects)
