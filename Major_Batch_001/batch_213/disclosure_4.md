## Adaptive Anomaly Profiling with Federated Learning

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A distributed, federated learning (FL) system overlaid on existing anomaly detection services.
*   **Data Sources:** Raw network traffic data (packet captures, flow logs), anomaly values generated by individual detection services, metadata about request sources/types (as per the patent).
*   **FL Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict *expected* anomaly values for a given network request based on historical data.  The LSTM can capture temporal dependencies in network behavior.
*   **Local Training:** Each anomaly detection service maintains a local copy of the LSTM model. It trains this model using its own observed data, generating local model updates (gradients).
*   **Central Aggregation:** A central server (or a distributed blockchain-based system) aggregates the local model updates from all participating anomaly detection services. Secure aggregation protocols (e.g., differential privacy) are used to protect the privacy of individual data contributions.
*   **Global Model Distribution:** The aggregated global model is distributed back to all anomaly detection services.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Each anomaly detection service calculates a 'confidence score' for its own anomaly values based on the difference between its predicted anomaly values (from the LSTM) and its observed anomaly values. Services with high confidence contribute more to the aggregation process.
*   **Concept Drift Detection:** Implement a mechanism to detect concept drift (changes in network behavior over time).  This can be achieved by monitoring the loss function of the LSTM model or by using statistical tests to compare the distributions of anomaly values over time. If drift is detected, the learning rate of the LSTM model is increased, or the model is retrained from scratch.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond static security profiles. The LSTM learns an evolving representation of "normal" network behavior *across* all detection services. This creates a more robust and adaptive system that is less susceptible to false positives and more effective at detecting novel attacks. By incorporating a confidence score and concept drift detection, the system can dynamically adjust its sensitivity and prioritize information from the most reliable sources.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// At each anomaly detection service:

// 1. Receive Network Request
request = receive_request()

// 2. Generate Anomaly Values
anomaly_values = generate_anomaly_values(request)

// 3. Predict Expected Anomaly Values using LSTM
predicted_anomaly_values = predict_anomaly_values(request, lstm_model)

// 4. Calculate Confidence Score
confidence_score = calculate_confidence_score(anomaly_values, predicted_anomaly_values)

// 5. Calculate Local Model Update (Gradients)
local_update = calculate_local_update(request, anomaly_values, lstm_model)

// 6. Send Local Update to Central Server

// At Central Server:

// 1. Receive Local Updates from All Services

// 2. Perform Secure Aggregation of Local Updates

// 3. Update Global LSTM Model

// 4. Distribute Updated Global LSTM Model to All Services

// Concept Drift Detection (at each service):

// 1. Monitor Loss Function of LSTM Model

// 2. If Loss Exceeds Threshold:
    // Increase Learning Rate
    // Or Retrain LSTM Model
