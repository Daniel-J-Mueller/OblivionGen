## Adaptive Spatial Audio Projection with Multi-Access Point Synchronization

**Concept:** Extend the concept of dynamically determining optimal audio delivery based on network throughput *beyond* simply enabling/disabling devices. Implement a system that leverages multiple access points (APs) to *project* spatially-aware audio to users, adapting the audio stream delivered to each device based on its real-time network conditions *and* its physical location relative to the audio source and other listeners.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multiple (N) 802.11ax (or later) Access Points. Each AP must support MU-MIMO and OFDMA.
    *   Audio devices (smartphones, speakers, headphones) with spatial audio rendering capabilities (HRTF processing).
    *   High-precision indoor positioning system (UWB, Bluetooth AoA/AoD, or visual positioning) integrated with the APs.
*   **Software – AP Side:**
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:** Processes the original audio source into multiple channels representing distinct spatial locations.
    *   **Network Condition Monitor:** Continuously assesses the throughput and latency to each connected audio device.
    *   **Positioning Data Integration:** Receives real-time location data for each audio device from the indoor positioning system.
    *   **Dynamic Channel Assignment:**  Allocates specific audio channels to each device based on its location and network conditions. Lower-throughput devices may receive downmixed or simplified audio streams.
    *   **Multi-AP Synchronization Module:**  Ensures precise time synchronization between all APs to maintain a consistent audio experience.  NTP or PTP protocols.
    *   **Beamforming Control:** APs utilize beamforming to direct audio signals towards the location of each device, reducing interference and improving signal quality.
*   **Software – Device Side:**
    *   **Audio Stream Receiver:** Receives the assigned audio stream from the AP.
    *   **HRTF Renderer:** Processes the received audio stream using head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create a 3D audio experience.
    *   **Location Reporting:**  Periodically reports its location to the APs.

**Pseudocode (AP Side - Dynamic Channel Assignment):**

```
function assign_audio_channels(audio_source, device_list):
  for each device in device_list:
    device_location = get_device_location(device)
    device_throughput = get_device_throughput(device)

    // Calculate relative distance and angle to audio source & other devices
    distance = calculate_distance(audio_source, device_location)
    angle = calculate_angle(audio_source, device_location)

    // Determine optimal audio channel and volume based on location/throughput
    channel = determine_optimal_channel(distance, angle, device_throughput)
    volume = adjust_volume_for_throughput(device_throughput)

    // Assign channel and volume to device
    assign_channel_to_device(device, channel)
    set_device_volume(device, volume)
end function

function determine_optimal_channel(distance, angle, throughput):
    if throughput < threshold_low:
        return mono_channel //Simple channel for low bandwidth
    else if throughput < threshold_medium:
        return stereo_channel //Stereo if medium
    else
        return full_spatial_channel //Spatial if high bandwidth
end function
```

**Innovation:** This builds on the patent's foundation of network-aware audio delivery, but moves beyond simple inclusion/exclusion.  It introduces spatial audio projection as a core feature, leveraging multi-AP coordination and real-time network data to create a dynamic, immersive audio experience that adapts to the user's location and network conditions. Lower bandwidth connections receive simplified streams, while high-bandwidth connections experience fully spatialized audio.
