## Adaptive Data Sharding via Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the restore/reconfiguration process to proactively shard/unshard data based on *predicted* load, not just requested configuration changes. This system monitors query patterns, data access frequencies, and historical load data to dynamically adjust the number and size of partitions *before* performance bottlenecks occur. It leverages machine learning to anticipate scaling needs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Query logs (timestamp, query type, data accessed).
    *   Historical load data (CPU, memory, I/O usage per partition).
    *   Data growth rates (estimated from historical data).
    *   Scheduled events (e.g., known marketing campaigns, report generation).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Time series analysis to identify trends in query volume and data access.
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, LSTM) trained to predict future load based on input data.
    *   Confidence intervals for load predictions.
*   **Output:**
    *   Predicted load per partition for a defined time horizon.
    *   Probability distribution of predicted load.
    *   Recommended number of partitions to optimize performance.
    *   Estimated data size per partition.

**2. Adaptive Sharding Manager:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Prediction Engine output.
    *   Current partition configuration.
    *   Resource availability (storage nodes).
    *   User-defined performance thresholds (e.g., maximum latency, throughput).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Evaluate predicted load against performance thresholds.
    *   Determine if sharding or unsharding is required.
    *   Generate a sharding/unsharding plan:
        *   Identify partitions to split or merge.
        *   Determine the optimal number of new partitions.
        *   Calculate data redistribution strategy (minimize data movement).
        *   Schedule the operation during low-traffic periods.
    *   Initiate data redistribution jobs.
*   **Output:**
    *   Sharding/Unsharding plan.
    *   Job status updates.

**3. Data Redistribution Service:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Sharding/Unsharding plan.
    *   Data to redistribute.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Read data from source partition.
    *   Apply sharding key/algorithm to determine target partition.
    *   Write data to target partition.
    *   Update metadata (partition mapping).
*   **Output:**
    *   Data successfully redistributed.

**4. Integration with Restore Process:**

*   When restoring a table, the Adaptive Sharding Manager can use the restore request (and the specified configuration parameters) as an initial seed for the prediction model. This allows the system to learn from user-defined scaling intentions.
*   The Adaptive Sharding Manager can override user-specified configuration parameters if the prediction model suggests a more optimal configuration.  User overrides should be logged.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Sharding Manager - Core Logic):**

```
function determine_sharding_strategy(prediction_data, current_config):
  predicted_load = prediction_data.get_predicted_load()
  current_partitions = current_config.get_partitions()

  if predicted_load > max_load_threshold:
    // Calculate number of new partitions needed
    new_partitions = calculate_new_partitions(predicted_load, current_partitions)

    // Create sharding plan
    sharding_plan = create_sharding_plan(new_partitions, current_partitions)

    return sharding_plan

  elif predicted_load < min_load_threshold:
    // Calculate number of partitions to merge
    partitions_to_merge = calculate_merge_candidates(current_partitions)

    // Create merging plan
    merging_plan = create_merging_plan(partitions_to_merge)

    return merging_plan

  else:
    return "No sharding/unsharding required"
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Scaling:**  Sharding/unsharding is triggered by *predicted* load, not just user requests.
*   **ML-Driven Optimization:** Machine learning models optimize the number and size of partitions.
*   **Self-Adjusting System:**  The system automatically adapts to changing workloads.
*   **Seamless Integration:**  The adaptive sharding process is integrated with the table restore process.
