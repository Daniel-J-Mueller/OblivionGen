**Dynamic Ecosystem Propagation – ‘Seed’ Systems**

**Concept:** Expand the rule-based virtual area generation beyond static object/terrain application to a system simulating ecological propagation. Instead of directly *placing* objects, the system defines ‘seeds’ with inherent growth rules and dependencies, allowing ecosystems to evolve organically within the defined terrain.

**Specifications:**

*   **Seed Definition:** Each seed contains:
    *   *Species ID:* Categorizes the seed (tree, bush, animal, etc.).
    *   *Growth Rules:* A set of conditional statements determining growth, reproduction, and behavior. These rules are sensitive to environmental factors (terrain type, moisture levels, time of day/year, proximity to other species).
    *   *Resource Requirements:* Defines resources needed for survival and reproduction (water, sunlight, specific terrain types, food sources - if applicable).
    *   *Propagation Method:*  Defines how the seed spreads (wind dispersal, animal transport, root expansion, etc.) – affects the spread rate and range.
    *   *Lifespan:* Defines maximum and minimum lifespans and decay characteristics.
*   **Terrain Dependency:** Terrain data isn't just a static backdrop. Seeds actively *read* terrain data to determine viability. A tree seed needs soil type X at depth Y. The system checks for that before allowing growth.
*   **Inter-Species Dependencies:** Introduce predator-prey relationships, symbiotic interactions (e.g., pollination), and competition for resources. Seeds can have rules like "Requires Species A within range B for survival" or "Competes with Species C for resource D."
*   **Time & Seasonality:** Integrate time/seasonality to drive growth cycles. Trees lose leaves in autumn, animals migrate, breeding seasons occur.
*   **User-Adjustable Parameters:** Allow designers to control:
    *   *Seed Density:* Controls initial seed distribution.
    *   *Growth Rate Multipliers:* Scales the speed of growth and propagation.
    *   *Environmental Stressors:* Introduce events like droughts, fires, or diseases to test ecosystem resilience.
*   **Simulation Engine:**
    *   *Discrete Time Steps:* The simulation advances in discrete steps (e.g., one step = one day).
    *   *Rule Evaluation:* At each step, the system evaluates the growth rules for each seed, considering current environmental conditions and interactions with other seeds.
    *   *Resource Management:* Track resource availability and allocate it to seeds based on their requirements and proximity.
    *   *Seed Spawning/Removal:* Spawn new seeds based on reproduction rates and remove seeds that die or decay.

**Pseudocode (simplified growth cycle):**

```
For each seed in ecosystem:
    Get current terrain data at seed location
    Get current weather data
    Check if terrain and weather meet seed's resource requirements
    If requirements met:
        Evaluate growth rules based on time of year, resource availability, proximity to other species
        If growth conditions favorable:
            Grow seed (increase size, maturity)
            Check if seed is ready to reproduce
            If ready to reproduce:
                Spawn new seed(s) based on propagation method and reproduction rate
    Else:
        Reduce seed health
        If health <= 0:
            Remove seed from ecosystem
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Hyper-realistic environmental simulation for games and VR.
*   AI-driven level design tools.
*   Ecological modeling and research.
*   Dynamic and unpredictable virtual worlds.
