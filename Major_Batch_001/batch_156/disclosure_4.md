## Modular Battery Thermal Regulation with Phase Change & Microfluidics

**Concept:** Integrate phase change material (PCM) microcapsules *within* the laminated structure alongside microfluidic channels. This creates a dynamic thermal regulation system – passive initially, actively cooled when needed.

**Specs:**

*   **Laminated Structure:** Layers of heat conductive material (aluminum nitride preferred) alternating with intumescent layers *and* layers containing PCM microcapsules dispersed in a thermally conductive polymer matrix. Microfluidic channels are etched *within* these PCM-containing layers, running perpendicular to the battery cell’s longest dimension.
*   **PCM Microcapsules:** Paraffin-based, optimized for melting point between 60-80°C. Encapsulation material must be compatible with battery electrolytes (preventing leakage/reaction). Density of microcapsules: 20-30% by volume.
*   **Microfluidic Channels:** Dimensions: 500µm diameter, 2mm spacing. Material: Electrically insulating polymer (e.g., PTFE). Channels connect to an external micro-pump/reservoir. Working fluid: Dielectric coolant (e.g., Novec).
*   **Intumescent Layer Integration:**  Intumescent layers remain functionally identical to the provided patent. They activate *after* PCM exhaustion *and* microfluidic channel failure as a final safety barrier.
*   **Electrical Isolation:** All layers are electrically isolated from the battery cells.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Miniature temperature sensors embedded within the PCM layer. Sensors communicate wirelessly to a battery management system (BMS).

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// BMS Monitors Cell Temperature
WHILE (Cell Temperature < 60°C) {
    // PCM absorbs heat, maintaining stable temperature
    // No active cooling required
}

IF (Cell Temperature > 60°C AND Cell Temperature < 80°C) {
    // Activate Micro-Pump
    // Circulate Dielectric Coolant through Microfluidic Channels
    // Monitor Coolant Temperature & Flow Rate
    // Adjust Pump Speed to Maintain Target Cell Temperature (e.g., 70°C)
}

IF (Cell Temperature > 80°C OR Microfluidic Channel Failure Detected) {
    // Activate Intumescent Layers
    // Shut Down Battery Module
    // Alert BMS
}

//Emergency Protocol: If intumescent layers fail, initiate a controlled discharge to reduce cell temperature.
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Channel geometry can be optimized for heat transfer (e.g., serpentine, finned).
*   PCM composition can be tailored for specific battery chemistries and operating conditions.
*   Integration of micro-heaters within the channels could enable active heating during cold weather operation.
*   Pressure sensors within channels to detect leaks.
*   Material selection is critical to ensure compatibility and long-term reliability.
