## Adaptive Spatial Audio Masking

**Concept:** Extend the frequency-band gain control demonstrated in the patent to create localized audio ‘masks’ in 3D space, effectively suppressing unwanted sounds *before* they reach the microphone, rather than just post-processing. This aims to improve clarity in noisy environments and potentially enable more robust voice control.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+) integrated into a wearable device (e.g., headset, collar, smart glasses). Array configuration: circular or tetrahedral.
    *   Bone conduction transducer for user’s own voice capture.
    *   Digital Signal Processor (DSP) with sufficient processing power for real-time beamforming and spectral analysis.
    *   Miniature speakers (2+) capable of directional audio output.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Source Localization:** Employ beamforming techniques on the microphone array to identify and locate dominant sound sources in the environment (speech, noise, etc.).
    2.  **Spectral Analysis (per source):** Analyze the frequency content of each identified sound source, similar to the patent’s approach.
    3.  **Masking Gain Calculation:** Calculate gain values *not just for suppression*, but to *generate* counter-phase audio signals tailored to *specific spatial locations*. The gain calculations should be based on:
        *   The spectral content of the target sound source.
        *   The distance and direction of the target sound source.
        *   The user's own voice (captured via bone conduction).
    4.  **Spatial Audio Generation:** Generate localized audio signals using the miniature speakers. These signals are designed to:
        *   Constructively interfere with unwanted noise at specific points in space, effectively ‘canceling’ it.
        *   Enhance the clarity of the user's own voice and desired speech sources.
        *   Create a localized "bubble" of clear audio around the user.
    5.  **Dynamic Adaptation:** Continuously monitor the acoustic environment and adjust the beamforming, gain calculations, and audio output in real-time.
    6.  **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):** Incorporate a robust VAD algorithm to distinguish between the user’s voice and ambient noise.
    7.  **User Profile:** Allow users to customize the masking parameters based on their preferences and the environment.

*   **Pseudocode (Masking Gain Calculation):**

```
// Input: Frequency band 'f', Source location 'source_loc', User location 'user_loc'
//        Current noise level 'noise_level'
function calculate_masking_gain(f, source_loc, user_loc, noise_level) {
    // Distance between source and user
    distance = calculate_distance(source_loc, user_loc);

    // Calculate attenuation based on distance
    attenuation = 1.0 / (distance * distance);

    // Calculate gain based on noise level
    gain = 1.0 - (noise_level / max_noise_level);

    // Apply frequency-specific gain
    frequency_gain = get_frequency_gain(f); //From patent-style spectral analysis
    total_gain = attenuation * gain * frequency_gain;

    //Ensure gain is not clipping
    if (total_gain > 1.0)
    {
        total_gain = 1.0
    }
    return total_gain;
}
```

*   **Output:** Directional audio signal(s) to be emitted by the miniature speakers, optimized to suppress noise and enhance desired audio sources.
