## Adaptive Aerodynamic Control Surfaces & Energy Harvesting

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply harvesting energy from free-spinning propellers during descent. Integrate micro-actuated, adaptive aerodynamic control surfaces *on* the propeller blades themselves, coupled with a resonant energy harvesting system. These surfaces would dynamically adjust airflow, maximizing energy capture *and* providing limited directional control even during complete power loss.

**Specs:**

*   **Blade Material:** Carbon fiber composite with embedded piezoelectric elements & microfluidic channels.
*   **Control Surface Type:**  Micro-actuated flaps (similar to morphing wing technology) integrated into each propeller blade, spanning approximately 20-30% of the blade length.
*   **Actuation:** Electroactive polymers (EAP) or shape memory alloys (SMA) embedded within the blade structure, controlled by a dedicated microcontroller.
*   **Sensor Suite:**  Miniature inertial measurement unit (IMU) integrated into the propeller hub. Measures angular velocity, acceleration, and orientation. Airflow sensors embedded within leading edges of blades.
*   **Energy Storage:**  Solid-state micro-battery array integrated into the propeller hub.  Target capacity: 100-150 mWh.
*   **Resonant Harvesting:** Incorporate tuned mass dampers within the propeller hub, designed to resonate at frequencies generated by blade oscillation due to airflow, converting mechanical vibration into electrical energy.
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    *   **Normal Operation:**  Micro-actuated control surfaces optimize blade pitch for maximum efficiency during powered flight.
    *   **Loss of Power/Descent:**
        1.  Detect loss of power via IMU/system sensors.
        2.  Activate free-spinning mode.
        3.  Control algorithm analyzes airflow and blade oscillation.
        4.  Adjust control surfaces to maximize airflow over blades, optimizing energy capture and blade speed.
        5.  Resonant harvesting system converts blade oscillation into electrical energy, charging the micro-battery.
        6.  Utilize stored energy to activate micro-thrusters (integrated into propeller hub) for limited directional control during descent.
        7.  Deploy protective elements (parachute, airbag) using harvested energy and/or a separate redundant system.
*   **Micro-Thruster Specs:** Miniature ion thrusters, providing approximately 50-100mN of thrust. Powered directly by the harvested energy.
*   **Deployment System:** Utilize a solenoid (powered by harvested energy) to release/deploy protective elements.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm - Descent Mode):**

```
while (power_lost == TRUE) {
    read_IMU_data();
    read_airflow_sensors();

    //Calculate optimal control surface deflection
    optimal_deflection = calculate_optimal_deflection(IMU_data, airflow_data);

    //Apply deflection to control surfaces
    actuate_control_surfaces(optimal_deflection);

    //Harvest energy from blade oscillation
    harvest_energy();

    //Monitor battery level
    if (battery_level < threshold) {
        activate_protective_elements();
    }

    //If possible, use harvested energy to activate micro-thrusters for limited control
    if (energy_available > micro_thruster_activation_threshold) {
        activate_micro_thrusters();
    }
}
```

**Innovation:** This expands beyond passive energy harvesting and introduces *active* aerodynamic control during descent, leveraging harvested energy for limited directional control and protective element deployment.  It moves beyond simply mitigating damage to potentially influencing the landing zone. It represents a hybrid passive/active control system, maximizing energy capture and providing a degree of maneuverability even in a complete power loss scenario.
