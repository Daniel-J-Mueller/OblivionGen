## Adaptive Key Sharding with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the request-supplied key concept by not only decrypting the key via an external entity, but by *sharding* that key into multiple components, distributing them geographically, and implementing a temporal decay function on each shard. This introduces an additional layer of security and resilience against compromise.

**Specification:**

**I. System Architecture**

*   **Key Sharding Service (KSS):** A distributed service responsible for receiving the encrypted key, generating shards, applying temporal decay, and managing shard distribution.
*   **Shard Storage Nodes (SSNs):** Geographically distributed nodes responsible for storing key shards. These nodes must employ secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Hardware Security Modules).
*   **Request Processing Entity (RPE):** Receives requests, communicates with the KSS to obtain decrypted data, and performs cryptographic operations.
*   **External Decryption Entity (EDE):** As in the original patent, receives encrypted key and provides decrypted key to KSS.

**II. Operational Flow**

1.  **Request Reception:** RPE receives a request including an encrypted cryptographic key and data specification.
2.  **Key Transfer to KSS:** RPE transmits the encrypted key to the KSS.
3.  **Decryption & Sharding:** KSS contacts the EDE to decrypt the key. Upon successful decryption, the KSS generates *n* shards from the decrypted key using a secure random number generator.
4.  **Shard Distribution:** Each shard is distributed to a different SSN. The SSNs are selected based on geographic diversity and availability.
5.  **Temporal Decay Application:** Each shard is assigned a decay rate and timestamp. The decay rate determines how quickly the shard’s value diminishes over time. Decay functions can include exponential decay or a step-wise reduction in entropy.
6.  **Shard Retrieval:** When the RPE requires the decrypted key, it contacts the KSS. The KSS requests each SSN to transmit its shard.
7.  **Shard Reassembly & Validation:** The KSS receives the shards, applies the temporal decay function to each shard, and reassembles the key. It validates the reassembled key’s integrity and entropy. If the key’s entropy falls below a threshold due to temporal decay, the RPE is notified, and the request is denied.
8.  **Cryptographic Operation & Key Destruction:** The RPE receives the reassembled key (if valid) and performs the requested cryptographic operation. The reassembled key is immediately destroyed after use.

**III. Pseudocode (KSS - Key Sharding Service)**

```
function receiveEncryptedKey(encryptedKey, requestId):
  decryptedKey = EDE.decrypt(encryptedKey)
  shards = generateShards(decryptedKey, numShards)
  for each shard in shards:
    ssn = selectSecureStorageNode()
    ssn.storeShard(shard, requestId, decayRate, timestamp)
end function

function retrieveKey(requestId):
  shards = []
  for i in range(numShards):
    ssn = selectSecureStorageNode(i)  //Ensure retrieval in correct order
    shard = ssn.retrieveShard(requestId)
    shards.append(shard)
  
  for shard in shards:
      shard = applyTemporalDecay(shard, timestamp)

  reassembledKey = combineShards(shards)
  
  if validateKey(reassembledKey):
    return reassembledKey
  else:
    return ERROR_INVALID_KEY
end function

function applyTemporalDecay(shard, timestamp):
    decayedShard = shard XOR (timestamp XOR decayRate) #Example - may be more complex
    return decayedShard
```

**IV. Security Considerations**

*   **Shard Entropy:** The number of shards and the entropy of each shard must be sufficient to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **SSN Security:** SSNs must be physically and logically secure.
*   **Temporal Decay Rate:** The decay rate must be carefully chosen to balance security and usability. Too slow, and the key remains vulnerable for too long. Too fast, and legitimate requests may be denied.
*   **Synchronization:** Accurate time synchronization across SSNs is crucial for the temporal decay function to work correctly.
*   **Shard Retrieval Order:** Maintaining the correct retrieval order of shards is essential for key reassembly. A sequence number or other identifier can be used to ensure proper order.
