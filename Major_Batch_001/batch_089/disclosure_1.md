## Adaptive Resonance Networked Battery Arrays

**Concept:** Utilize the resonant properties of battery housings not just for signal transmission, but as a networked communication and power distribution system within a larger device or array of devices.

**Specs:**

*   **Battery Modules:** Each battery utilizes a conductive housing tuned to a unique, but harmonically related, resonant frequency within the RF spectrum (e.g., 433MHz, 915MHz, 2.4GHz, 5.8GHz - frequency selection based on application). Housing material is high-conductivity aluminum alloy.
*   **Resonance Network:** Battery modules are physically arranged to create a distributed resonance network. Proximity and orientation are crucial for efficient energy and signal transfer. Modules are not directly wired for power delivery â€“ reliance is on inductive coupling via resonant frequencies.
*   **Controller Module:** A central controller manages the network, dynamically adjusting frequencies to optimize energy distribution and communication based on load and network conditions. It incorporates a spectrum analyzer to monitor network health and identify interference.
*   **Energy Harvesting:** Utilize ambient RF energy harvesting via the battery housing antennae. The harvested energy supplements power from the battery itself, extending operational life.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Develop a custom communication protocol based on frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation, leveraging the resonant frequencies for data transmission. Each battery module acts as both a transmitter and a receiver.
*   **Power Regulation:** Implement inductive power transfer (IPT) coils near each battery module, optimized for the specific resonant frequency, to step down or step up voltage as needed.
*   **Cascading & Scalability:** Design the system to support cascading multiple battery arrays for increased capacity and range. Each cascade module serves as a repeater for both power and data.
*   **Frequency Diversity & Anti-Jamming:** Implement frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) techniques to enhance robustness against interference and jamming.

**Pseudocode (Controller Module - Energy Distribution):**

```
// Initialize network map
networkMap = createNetworkMap();

// Monitor battery levels and load demands
while (true) {
  for each battery in networkMap {
    batteryLevel = readBatteryLevel(battery);
    loadDemand = readLoadDemand(battery);

    // Calculate energy surplus/deficit
    energyBalance = batteryLevel - loadDemand;

    if (energyBalance < 0) {
      // Battery needs energy - find neighbor with surplus
      neighbor = findNearestSurplusNeighbor(battery);
      if (neighbor != null) {
        // Initiate resonant energy transfer
        transferEnergy(neighbor, battery, energyDeficit);
      }
    } else if (energyBalance > 0) {
      // Battery has surplus energy - broadcast availability
      broadcastSurplusEnergy(battery, energySurplus);
    }
  }
  delay(100ms);
}

//Function to find the closest battery that has enough power for the current battery
function findNearestSurplusNeighbor(battery) {
    //Calculate the distance to each battery in the network
    //Check to see if each battery has enough power
    //Return the battery with the most power that is within range
}
```
