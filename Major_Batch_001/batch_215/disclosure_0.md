## Predictive Buffering & Dynamic Resolution Scaling

**Concept:** Leverage predictive analytics based on event detection to preemptively buffer video data *at varying resolutions* before transmission, optimizing bandwidth and minimizing latency.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing camera, memory, communication module, processor as described in provided patent.
    *   Dedicated hardware acceleration block for resolution scaling (optional, can be implemented in software).
    *   Increased memory capacity (scalable based on anticipated event complexity & duration).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Event Prediction Engine:*  Analyzes incoming video data for pre-defined event signatures (motion, facial recognition, object detection, sound analysis). Assigns a “predictive buffer request” score (0-100) based on the likelihood of an event triggering extended recording.
    *   *Dynamic Resolution Manager:*  Controls video encoding resolution based on the predictive buffer request score.  Maintains a resolution profile mapping (e.g., Score 0-30: 480p, 31-60: 720p, 61-90: 1080p, 91-100: 4K).
    *   *Hierarchical Buffering System:* Divides the memory into multiple buffers with varying priorities.
        *   *Priority 1 (Critical):* Small, high-resolution buffer for immediate pre-event capture.  Continually overwritten with the latest frames.
        *   *Priority 2 (Standard):* Medium-sized buffer for standard resolution recording.
        *   *Priority 3 (Archive):* Large, lower resolution buffer for extended recording/archival purposes.
    *   *Smart Streaming Manager:*  Manages the transmission of buffered data to the client device.  Prioritizes data from the critical buffer during event detection.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Set initial resolution to 720p.
Initialize Priority 1 buffer (size: 500ms video @ 1080p).
Initialize Priority 2 buffer (size: 10 seconds @ 720p).
Initialize Priority 3 buffer (size: 60 seconds @ 480p).

//Main Loop
While (device is active) {
  //Capture video frame
  frame = captureFrame();

  //Event Detection
  eventScore = eventPredictionEngine.detectEvent(frame);

  //Resolution Adjustment
  resolution = dynamicResolutionManager.adjustResolution(eventScore);

  //Frame Encoding
  encodedFrame = encodeFrame(frame, resolution);

  //Buffering
  priority1Buffer.addFrame(encodedFrame);
  priority2Buffer.addFrame(encodedFrame);
  priority3Buffer.addFrame(encodedFrame);

  //Streaming
  if (eventDetected) {
    streamManager.streamFrame(priority1Buffer.getFrame()); //Prioritize high-res capture.
  } else {
    streamManager.streamFrame(priority2Buffer.getFrame());
  }
}

//Event Prediction Engine (Simplified)
function detectEvent(frame) {
  motionDetected = detectMotion(frame);
  faceDetected = detectFace(frame);
  //... other event detection logic
  eventScore = calculateScore(motionDetected, faceDetected, ...);
  return eventScore;
}
```

**Enhancements:**

*   Adaptive buffering based on network conditions.
*   User-configurable event sensitivity.
*   Integration with cloud-based AI for more advanced event prediction.
*   Support for multiple camera streams.
*   Predictive *audio* buffering as well.
