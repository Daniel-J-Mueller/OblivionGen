## Multi-Axis Vectoring Propeller System

**Concept:** Expand upon the circumferential drive concept by implementing individual control over magnetic field strength to each electromagnet, allowing for vectoring thrust beyond simple rotational speed control. This enables direct manipulation of thrust direction in three dimensions *without* traditional control surfaces or gimbaled propellers.

**Specs:**

*   **Enclosure:** Maintain a substantially circular enclosure, constructed from a lightweight, high-strength composite material (carbon fiber reinforced polymer). Internal surface coated with a magnetic shielding material to minimize interference.
*   **Propeller Assembly:** Utilize a modular propeller blade design. Each blade will be segmented into 3-5 independently controlled sections. Each section will incorporate embedded permanent magnets.
*   **Electromagnets:** Replace the current 'plurality' with a dense array of individually addressable electromagnets positioned around the inner circumference of the enclosure. Each electromagnet will be capable of precisely controlled current modulation.  Minimum electromagnet density: 1 per 10 degrees of circumference.
*   **Controller:** A high-performance embedded system.
    *   Input: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), GPS, User Input (optional).
    *   Processing: Sophisticated control algorithms to calculate optimal electromagnet activation patterns for desired thrust vector.
    *   Output: Precise current control signals for each electromagnet.
*   **Power System:** High-density lithium-polymer battery pack. Wireless charging capability.
*   **Magnetic Field Shaping:** Utilize a series of ferrous cores strategically placed *between* electromagnets. These cores will focus and direct the magnetic field lines, increasing the efficiency of interaction with the propeller blade magnets.

**Pseudocode (Thrust Vector Control):**

```
// Define desired thrust vector (x, y, z)
vector3 desired_thrust;

// Read IMU data to determine current orientation
orientation current_orientation;

// Calculate required magnetic field distribution
magnetic_field_distribution = calculate_field_distribution(desired_thrust, current_orientation);

// For each electromagnet:
for (int i = 0; i < num_electromagnets; i++) {
    // Set current based on calculated magnetic field strength
    set_electromagnet_current(i, magnetic_field_distribution[i]);
}

// Adjust rotational speed for overall thrust magnitude
set_propeller_speed(desired_thrust_magnitude);
```

**Innovation Details:**

The core novelty lies in the ability to *shape* the magnetic field acting on the propeller assembly.  By precisely controlling the current to each electromagnet, the controller can create localized areas of high and low magnetic attraction/repulsion. This allows the propeller assembly to tilt and rotate *within* the enclosure, effectively vectoring thrust in any direction.  The segmented propeller blades ensure that thrust vectoring does not induce excessive vibration or instability. This creates a highly maneuverable, silent propulsion system for UAVs and potentially other applications.
