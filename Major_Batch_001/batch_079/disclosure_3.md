**Adaptive Acoustic Beamforming with Spatial Audio Reconstruction**

**Specification:**

**Goal:** To create a localized audio experience for a user even with dynamic speaker and microphone placement, leveraging the principles of adaptive filtering and spatial audio reconstruction.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Multi-Microphone Array:** A device containing at least four microphones, optimally arranged in a tetrahedral or similar 3D configuration. This array is designed to capture ambient audio.

2.  **Reference Signal Acquisition:** Utilizing the 'second device' audio signal described in the patent (the audio *being* output) as a primary reference.  Additionally, capture audio directly from the output speaker itself with a dedicated close-proximity microphone.

3.  **Adaptive Beamforming Engine:** An implementation of Delay-and-Sum beamforming combined with an adaptive filter (similar to the patentâ€™s FIR filter) for noise cancellation and signal enhancement. The beamforming will dynamically adjust its focus based on the identified sound source direction.

4.  **Sound Source Localization:** Employing Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and/or beam steering techniques to determine the direction of the primary sound source (the 'second device'). Utilize the adaptive filter coefficients as input to improve TDOA calculations.

5.  **Spatial Audio Reconstruction Engine:**  A module capable of reconstructing a 3D audio field.  This will utilize Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) personalized to the user (through calibration or generalized HRTF databases) to create a realistic spatial audio experience.

6.  **Dynamic HRTF Adaptation:** A feedback loop that continuously refines the HRTFs used by the Spatial Audio Reconstruction Engine. This will be achieved by analyzing the residual error between the reconstructed audio and the actual captured audio, and adjusting the HRTFs accordingly.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Microphone Array
Calibrate HRTF (User Profile or Generic)
Obtain Reference Signal (Second Device Output)

// Main Loop
For each audio frame:
    Capture audio from Microphone Array
    Obtain Reference Signal

    // Adaptive Beamforming
    Calculate Beamforming Weights based on Sound Source Localization
    Apply Beamforming Weights to Microphone Array Audio
    Subtract Reference Signal (Noise Cancellation)

    // Spatial Audio Reconstruction
    Apply HRTFs to Beamformed Audio
    Output Spatialized Audio

    // Dynamic HRTF Adaptation
    Calculate Residual Error (Difference between Output and Captured Audio)
    Adjust HRTFs based on Residual Error
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of 4 microphones with a sampling rate of 48kHz.
