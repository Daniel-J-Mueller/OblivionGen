**Adaptive Composite Image Generation & Style Transfer System**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Style-Aware Composite Generator
*   **Input:** Seed Image (base image – e.g., a t-shirt photo), Style Image (graphic to overlay), Composite Feature Signature Database (derived from existing authorized composite images – similar to the patent's feature signatures, but expanded to include stylistic elements)
*   **Output:** Generated composite image, Confidence Score (indicating the aesthetic quality and potential for authorization)

**Functionality:**

1.  **Style Extraction:** Analyze the Style Image using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract stylistic features (color palettes, textures, edge characteristics, artistic style classification). Store as a Style Vector.
2.  **Seed Image Analysis:** Analyze the Seed Image to determine optimal overlay regions (using edge detection, color segmentation, and object recognition). Generate a Segmentation Map defining these regions.
3.  **Style Transfer & Blending:**  Apply the Style Vector to the Segmentation Map of the Seed Image. Use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to transfer the style *seamlessly* onto the defined regions, generating a blended image. Implement multiple GANs trained on diverse style datasets (e.g., watercolor, graffiti, photorealistic).
4.  **Aesthetic Scoring:**  A dedicated aesthetic scoring network (trained on large datasets of visually appealing images) evaluates the generated composite. This network considers factors like color harmony, contrast, composition, and visual balance. Output a Confidence Score (0-100).
5.  **Feature Signature Generation:** Generate a composite feature signature for the *generated* image. This signature includes shape features (as in the original patent) *and* stylistic features (color palettes, texture metrics, style classification from the aesthetic scoring network).
6.  **Database Comparison & Refinement:** Compare the generated feature signature to the Composite Feature Signature Database. If a close match is found, the generated image is considered potentially "safe" (likely to be authorized). If not, the system iteratively refines the Style Transfer process (adjusting parameters within the GANs) and regenerates the image until a satisfactory match is achieved or a maximum iteration count is reached.
7.  **Authorization Prediction:** Based on the feature signature match *and* the aesthetic scoring Confidence Score, predict the likelihood of the generated image being authorized within the catalog system.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
function GenerateComposite(SeedImage, StyleImage):
  StyleVector = ExtractStyle(StyleImage)
  SegmentationMap = GenerateSegmentationMap(SeedImage)
  GeneratedImage = ApplyStyleTransfer(SeedImage, StyleVector, SegmentationMap)
  ConfidenceScore = AestheticScoring(GeneratedImage)
  FeatureSignature = GenerateCompositeFeatureSignature(GeneratedImage)
  Match = FindClosestMatch(FeatureSignature, Database)
  
  if Match != NULL and ConfidenceScore > Threshold:
    return GeneratedImage, "Authorized"
  else:
    AdjustStyleTransferParameters()
    if IterationCount < MaxIterations:
      IterationCount++
      return GenerateComposite(SeedImage, StyleImage)
    else:
      return GeneratedImage, "Review Required"

```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU (for CNN and GAN training/inference)
*   Large RAM capacity (for handling image data and model parameters)
*   Fast storage (SSD) for efficient data access.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated generation of custom product designs.
*   Rapid prototyping of visual content for marketing campaigns.
*   Creation of personalized user experiences.
*   Scalable content creation for e-commerce platforms.
