## Adaptive Haptic Experience Templates

**Concept:** Extend the experience template system to incorporate haptic feedback, adapting not just visual/auditory settings, but *physical* sensations a user feels. This moves beyond merely replicating an experience, and allows for creation of entirely new, multi-sensory "digital textures".

**Specifications:**

**1. Haptic Data Capture & Encoding:**

*   **Hardware Requirement:** Devices must incorporate advanced haptic actuators capable of nuanced force feedback, texture simulation, and potentially thermal/kinetic variations.
*   **Data Stream:** During interaction sequence capture, record actuator commands alongside UI/module state data and timing.  This creates a “Haptic Event Log.”
*   **Encoding:**  Haptic commands will be encoded using a standardized, modular format.  Parameters include:
    *   Actuator ID (specifies which actuator to control).
    *   Force/Vibration Amplitude (0-100%).
    *   Frequency (Hz) - for vibration patterns.
    *   Duration (ms).
    *   Waveform (Sine, Square, Triangle, Custom).
    *   Texture Profile (pre-defined or custom patterns for texture simulation).
*   **Resolution:** Capture haptic data at a minimum resolution of 60Hz to ensure smooth and realistic sensations.

**2. Experience Template Generation (Haptic Extension):**

*   **Template Structure:**  Existing experience templates are augmented with a “Haptic Layer.” This layer contains:
    *   A list of Haptic Event Log entries, synchronized with UI/module state changes.
    *   Actuator Calibration Data (specific to the target device).
*   **Interpolation:** Implement algorithms to interpolate between captured haptic events. This allows for smoother transitions and adaptation to different interaction speeds.
*   **Contextual Adaptation:**  Introduce a “Haptic Context Engine.” This engine analyzes the current application state and user activity to dynamically adjust haptic feedback intensity and patterns.  For example:
    *   Higher intensity haptic feedback for critical alerts.
    *   Subtle haptic textures for UI elements the user is actively interacting with.

**3. Device Implementation & Adaptation:**

*   **Actuator Mapping:**  A mapping system translates generic haptic commands to specific actuator controls on the target device. This ensures compatibility across different hardware configurations.
*   **Haptic Rendering Engine:**  A dedicated engine renders haptic events in real-time, driving the actuators based on the template data and actuator mapping.
*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to adjust haptic feedback intensity, patterns, and enabled actuators.
*   **Cross-Device Synchronization:**  When transferring experience templates, include actuator calibration data for the target device.
*   **Device-Specific Profiles:** Each device type will have a base profile for haptic feedback which can be adjusted based on user preference, or the experience template being used.

**4. Pseudocode Example (Haptic Rendering Engine):**

```pseudocode
function RenderHapticEvent(eventData, currentTime):
  actuatorID = eventData.actuatorID
  amplitude = eventData.amplitude
  frequency = eventData.frequency
  duration = eventData.duration
  waveform = eventData.waveform

  //Apply actuator calibration (device-specific)

  // Generate waveform based on parameters
  waveformSignal = GenerateWaveform(waveform, frequency, amplitude, duration)

  // Send signal to actuator
  SendSignalToActuator(actuatorID, waveformSignal)

  //Schedule next haptic event
  ScheduleNextEvent(eventData, currentTime)
```

**Novelty:** This extends the concept of experience templates from purely visual/auditory settings to include *physical* sensations, creating truly immersive and personalized digital experiences. It builds on the captured interaction sequence to enhance it with tactile and kinetic feedback. This system is not about just recreating an experience, but *enhancing* it through multi-sensory interaction.
