**Adaptive Resonance Field Mapping for Predictive Inventory Management**

**Concept:** Expand the current system's reactive object tracking into a proactive predictive inventory system leveraging a dynamically generated “resonance field” around the materials handling facility. This field isn't a literal electromagnetic field, but a computationally derived spatial probability map of object location *before* movement is detected.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Network:** Expand the current input device network to include low-power, wide-area network (LoRaWAN) enabled “echo” sensors distributed throughout the facility. These sensors don't need full vision; they detect basic RF signatures or slight air pressure changes indicating *potential* movement.
*   **Resonance Field Generation:**
    *   Establish a baseline “resonance field” representing object density and typical traffic patterns based on historical data. This is a multi-dimensional map – x, y, z coordinates, object type probability, and velocity prediction.
    *   Echo sensors feed data into a central processing unit (CPU).
    *   CPU executes an adaptive resonance algorithm. This algorithm compares incoming sensor data to the existing resonance field.
        *   If data *matches* the field, it reinforces the existing probabilities.
        *   If data *deviates*, it triggers a local field adjustment and initiates a predictive object tracking sequence.
*   **Predictive Tracking Sequence:**
    *   The system calculates a predicted object trajectory based on the deviation.
    *   Cameras are preemptively focused on the predicted path.  Instead of waiting for the primary input device to detect movement, cameras are actively tracking *potential* movement.
    *   This dramatically reduces latency and improves accuracy.
*   **Dynamic Camera Prioritization:**  A weighting algorithm prioritizes camera focus based on:
    *   Object type (high-value items receive higher priority).
    *   Predicted trajectory (objects heading towards critical areas receive higher priority).
    *   Resonance field confidence (areas with high confidence receive less priority).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ResonanceField` : Multi-dimensional array (x, y, z, object_type_probability, velocity_prediction).
    *   `EchoSensorData` :  (sensor_id, signal_strength, timestamp).
    *   `PredictedTrajectory` :  Array of (x, y, z) coordinates over a time horizon.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Create ResonanceField(facility_dimensions)
Populate ResonanceField with historical data

//Main Loop
For each EchoSensorData:
    sensor_id, signal_strength, timestamp = EchoSensorData
    location = GetSensorLocation(sensor_id)
    deviation = CalculateDeviation(location, ResonanceField)
    If deviation > threshold:
        predicted_trajectory = CalculateTrajectory(location, deviation)
        PrioritizeCamera(predicted_trajectory)
        ActivateCameras(predicted_trajectory)
        UpdateResonanceField(predicted_trajectory)
```

**Novelty:**  The existing patent focuses on reacting *to* movement. This system focuses on predicting movement *before* it happens, creating a more proactive and efficient inventory management solution.  The "resonance field" concept is a novel way to represent spatial probability and prioritize resource allocation. The algorithm is adaptable, utilizing edge sensors to assist the main sensors.
