## Adaptive Recommendation Weighting via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Augment RFM segmentation and correlation detection with real-time user biofeedback to dynamically adjust recommendation weights. Instead of static segment assignments, recommendations become hyper-personalized *during* a user session, responding to subconscious cues.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Integration:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor:** Non-invasive wearable device (wristband, earclip) measuring:
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) - indicates arousal/emotional engagement.
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - reflects cognitive load and stress.
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) - (Optional, higher complexity) - monitors brainwave activity related to attention and emotional response.
*   **Data Transmission:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication to the recommendation engine.
*   **Calibration Phase:** Initial user session to establish baseline biofeedback readings. 

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Preprocessor:**  
    *   Filters and cleans raw sensor data.
    *   Applies signal processing algorithms to extract meaningful features (e.g., average GSR level, HRV metrics).
    *   Normalizes data to user's baseline and adjusts for individual differences.
*   **Emotional State Estimator:**  
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Neural Network) trained to infer user's emotional state (e.g., interest, frustration, boredom) from preprocessed biofeedback features. 
    *   Outputs a confidence score for each inferred emotional state.
*   **Recommendation Weighting Module:** 
    *   Receives output from Emotional State Estimator and current RFM segment assignment.
    *   Applies dynamic weights to recommendation candidates based on inferred emotional state.
        *   High interest/engagement (high GSR, focused EEG):  Increase weight of items similar to those already engaged with or highly correlated with the current RFM segment.
        *   Frustration/Boredom (low GSR, erratic EEG): Decrease weight of items from the current RFM segment; increase weight of exploratory recommendations – items from different segments or with novel attributes.
        *   Neutral/Calm: Maintain RFM-based weights.
    *   Weight adjustment is proportional to the confidence score of the emotional state.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:**  Built-in mechanism to compare the performance of biofeedback-augmented recommendations against traditional RFM-based recommendations.  Metrics: click-through rate, conversion rate, session duration, user satisfaction (post-session survey).

**III. Pseudocode (Recommendation Weighting Module):**

```
function calculate_weighted_score(item, RFM_score, emotional_state, confidence_score):
    weight = 1.0  // Base weight

    if emotional_state == "interested":
        weight += (confidence_score * 0.2)  // Increase weight by up to 20%
    elif emotional_state == "frustrated":
        weight -= (confidence_score * 0.3)  // Decrease weight by up to 30%
    elif emotional_state == "bored":
        weight -= (confidence_score * 0.2) //Decrease weight by up to 20%

    weighted_score = RFM_score * weight

    return weighted_score
```

**IV. Data Flow:**

1.  User interacts with the catalog.
2.  Biofeedback sensor collects data.
3.  Biofeedback Preprocessor cleans and normalizes data.
4.  Emotional State Estimator infers user’s emotional state.
5.  Recommendation Weighting Module adjusts item scores based on emotional state and RFM segment.
6.  Recommendation engine selects and presents items.
7.  Data is logged for A/B testing and model improvement.

**V. Considerations:**

*   Privacy:  Obtain explicit user consent before collecting biofeedback data. Anonymize data whenever possible.
*   Sensor Accuracy: Choose sensors with high accuracy and reliability.
*   Computational Cost: Optimize algorithms for real-time performance.
*   User Experience:  Ensure the biofeedback integration is seamless and does not disrupt the user experience.
*   Adaptive Learning: Continuously refine the emotional state estimation model based on user feedback and A/B testing results.
