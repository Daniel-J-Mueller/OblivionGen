## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Glove with Bio-Signal Integration

**System Overview:** A glove incorporating microfluidic actuators for localized pressure simulation, combined with electromyography (EMG) and skin conductance sensors for real-time bio-signal acquisition. The system aims to enhance the realism of virtual interactions, particularly in training, rehabilitation, and remote manipulation scenarios.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Glove Structure:** Lightweight, flexible base material (e.g., Lycra/Spandex blend) with embedded sensor and actuator network. Modular design for customization and repair.
*   **Microfluidic Actuators:** An array of miniature, pneumatically driven chambers (approx. 5mm diameter) positioned on the palmar and dorsal surfaces of the fingers and palm. Each chamber is connected to a micro-pump system. Actuation pressure adjustable from 0-200 kPa.
*   **EMG Sensors:** Surface EMG sensors integrated into the glove fabric, positioned over key flexor and extensor muscles of the forearm and hand. Sampling rate: 1 kHz.
*   **Skin Conductance Sensors:** Two skin conductance sensors positioned on the palmar surface of the index and middle fingers. Sampling rate: 10 Hz.
*   **IMU:** A 9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) embedded in the back of the hand to track hand orientation and movement. Sampling rate: 100 Hz.
*   **Micro-Pump System:** Miniature, low-power micro-pumps (piezoelectric or diaphragm-based) controlled by a microcontroller. Individual pump control for each actuator chamber.
*   **Microcontroller:** ARM Cortex-M4 processor with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module for wireless communication.
*   **Power Supply:** Rechargeable lithium-polymer battery integrated into the wrist cuff. Estimated battery life: 4 hours.

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Bio-Signal Processing:**
    *   EMG signal filtering (bandpass 20-500 Hz) and rectification.
    *   Skin conductance signal baseline correction and normalization.
    *   Feature extraction (e.g., root mean square, waveform length) from both EMG and skin conductance signals.

2.  **Haptic Feedback Control Algorithm:**
    *   **Gesture Recognition:** A machine learning model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) trained to recognize a predefined set of hand gestures from the processed bio-signal data and IMU data.
    *   **Virtual Object Interaction Mapping:** Map virtual object properties (e.g., stiffness, texture, shape) to appropriate actuator activation patterns. For example, a hard object would trigger higher actuator pressures across a wider surface area.
    *   **Dynamic Pressure Control:** Implement a PID controller to maintain desired actuator pressures based on virtual object interaction forces and user grip strength (estimated from EMG signals).
    *   **Texture Simulation:** Use rapid, localized actuator activation patterns to simulate surface textures.

3.  **Calibration Routine:**
    *   An automated calibration procedure to establish baseline bio-signal levels and map actuator pressures to perceived tactile sensations.
    *   User-adjustable parameters to personalize the haptic feedback experience.
