## Dynamic Contextual Layering & Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Expand the 3D interface beyond visual representation by incorporating dynamically adjusted haptic feedback layered onto a physical surface, responding to the weighted interface elements.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Transparent Conductive Surface:** A display-integrated, transparent surface (e.g., specialized glass or polymer) capable of localized electrostatic charge control.  Area: Minimum 15” diagonal. Resolution: 100ppi minimum for haptic element control.
*   **Electrostatic Actuator Array:**  An array of micro-actuators positioned beneath the transparent surface.  Each actuator controls a localized electrostatic field. Density:  Corresponds to display pixel density. Range:  Variable electrostatic force (0-5N).
*   **Depth Sensor:**  Time-of-Flight or structured light sensor to determine user finger position *relative* to the transparent surface. Accuracy: <1mm.  Refresh Rate: 60Hz.
*   **Orientation/Position Sensor:** IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) integrated into the computing device to track device orientation and position in space.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated processing unit for real-time haptic rendering and sensor fusion. Minimum: Quad-core 2.0GHz processor.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **3D Interface Engine:**  Extends existing 2D/3D rendering pipeline to incorporate haptic data.
*   **Weight Mapping Algorithm:**  Algorithm that maps the ‘weight’ assigned to each interface element (as defined in the patent) to specific electrostatic force levels and localized surface textures.  Range:  Linear or non-linear mapping based on weight value.
*   **Haptic Rendering Engine:**  Translates weight-mapped force levels into actuator control signals.
*   **Sensor Fusion Module:**  Combines data from the depth sensor, orientation/position sensor, and potentially camera input to determine user interaction and adjust haptic feedback accordingly.
*   **Dynamic Texture Generation:** Algorithm to create subtle surface textures (e.g., micro-bumps, ridges) using localized electrostatic charge. Resolution: Adjustable (10-100ppi).
*   **API:** Software interface allowing developers to integrate haptic feedback into their applications.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Interface Analysis:** The 3D Interface Engine analyzes the webpage/application interface and determines the weight assigned to each element.
2.  **Weight Mapping:** The Weight Mapping Algorithm translates the weight values into corresponding electrostatic force levels and texture parameters.
3.  **Haptic Rendering:** The Haptic Rendering Engine generates actuator control signals based on the mapped values.
4.  **Sensor Input:** The Sensor Fusion Module receives input from the depth sensor, orientation/position sensor, and potentially camera input to determine user finger position and interaction.
5.  **Haptic Feedback:** The electrostatic actuator array generates localized electrostatic forces and textures on the transparent surface, providing haptic feedback to the user.  The force and texture parameters are dynamically adjusted based on user interaction and device orientation.
6.  **Layered Perception:**  Higher-weighted elements create a stronger haptic ‘push’ or more defined texture, causing them to feel ‘raised’ above lower-weighted elements.

**4.  Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (applicationRunning) {

    // Get Interface Data (weights, positions, etc.)
    interfaceData = getInterfaceData();

    // Get Sensor Data
    sensorData = getSensorData();

    // Calculate Haptic Feedback
    hapticFeedback = calculateHapticFeedback(interfaceData, sensorData);

    // Apply Haptic Feedback to Actuator Array
    applyHapticFeedback(hapticFeedback);

    // Update Display
    updateDisplay();
}

// Function: calculateHapticFeedback
function calculateHapticFeedback(interfaceData, sensorData) {
    // Iterate through interface elements
    for (element in interfaceData) {
        // Calculate haptic force based on weight
        force = element.weight * forceMultiplier;

        // Adjust force based on user interaction (e.g., proximity, touch)
        force = adjustForce(force, sensorData);

        // Calculate texture parameters
        texture = generateTexture(element.weight);

        // Store haptic data for element
        hapticData[element.id] = { force: force, texture: texture };
    }
    return hapticData;
}
```

**5. Potential Applications:**

*   **Accessibility:** Provide tactile feedback for visually impaired users.
*   **Gaming:** Enhance immersion by providing realistic tactile sensations.
*   **Productivity:** Improve efficiency by providing tactile confirmation of selections and actions.
*   **Data Visualization:** Allow users to ‘feel’ data patterns and trends.
