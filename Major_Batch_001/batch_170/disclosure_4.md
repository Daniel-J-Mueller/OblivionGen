**Dynamic Contextual ‘Echo’ Summaries**

**Concept:** Expand the idea of dynamic summaries to not just recap *before* resumption, but to create brief ‘echo’ summaries *during* consumption, triggered by significant emotional or plot shifts within the media. These aren't traditional summaries, but atmospheric, impressionistic ‘echoes’ of what just happened, designed to heighten immersion and recall.

**Specs:**

*   **Emotional/Plot Shift Detection:** Implement a real-time analysis module within the application. This module utilizes both audio analysis (tone, music cues) and content analysis (dialogue sentiment, keyword identification related to plot points – leveraging large language models). A threshold is defined for significant shifts.
*   **Echo Summary Generation:**  Upon detection of a significant shift:
    *   A short, 5-10 second ‘echo’ summary is dynamically generated. This isn't a straightforward recap, but a poetic distillation. Think of it as a haiku or a very short evocative description. The LLM should be instructed to prioritize emotional impact and key imagery over factual accuracy.
    *   The summary is displayed as a semi-transparent overlay on the media, or presented via haptic feedback (vibration pattern on a controller/device), *immediately* after the detected shift. The duration of the overlay/haptic feedback is adjustable.
*   **User Customization:** Users should be able to:
    *   Adjust the sensitivity of the shift detection.
    *   Choose the presentation method (overlay, haptic, or both).
    *   Adjust the length and ‘style’ of the echo summary (e.g., ‘poetic’, ‘dramatic’, ‘minimalist’).
    *   Disable the feature entirely.
*   **Data Collection & Refinement:** User interaction with echo summaries (dismissing, replaying, adjusting settings) provides data to refine the shift detection and summary generation algorithms.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (media_playing) {

    // Analyze Media - Audio & Content
    shift_detected = analyze_media(audio_data, content_data);

    if (shift_detected) {
        // Generate Echo Summary
        echo_summary = generate_echo_summary(content_data, user_style_preference);

        // Present Echo Summary
        present_echo_summary(echo_summary, user_presentation_preference);

        // Log User Interaction
        log_user_interaction(echo_summary);
    }
}

// Function: generate_echo_summary
function generate_echo_summary(content_data, user_style_preference) {
    // LLM prompt: “Summarize the last 10 seconds of content with an emphasis on emotional tone and imagery, in the style of [user_style_preference]”
    // LLM output is the echo summary
    return llm_output;
}

//Function: analyze_media
function analyze_media(audio_data, content_data){
    emotional_score = analyze_audio(audio_data)
    plot_score = analyze_content(content_data)

    if(emotional_score > threshold && plot_score > threshold){
        return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-User Sync:** For shared viewing experiences, synchronize echo summaries across multiple devices.
*   **Personalized Echoes:** Tailor echo summaries based on user’s viewing history and preferences.
*   **Integration with Smart Home Devices:** Trigger ambient lighting or sound effects to complement the echo summary.
