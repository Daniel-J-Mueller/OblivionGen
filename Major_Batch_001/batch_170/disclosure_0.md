## Adaptive Policy 'Shadowing' & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the self-learning access control beyond *reactive* policy modification to *proactive* shadowing and prediction of access needs, creating temporary, 'shadow' policies that can be rapidly deployed based on predicted behavior. This moves beyond simply correcting existing permission issues to anticipating future needs and pre-staging access.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiling Module:**
    *   Input: Usage history data (as per the patent), time-of-day, user location (optional, with consent), data sensitivity level of resource being accessed.
    *   Process: Employ time-series analysis and machine learning (LSTM networks are suggested) to create individual and group behavioral profiles. Profiles should capture:
        *   Access frequency to specific resources.
        *   Access patterns (e.g., sequential access to multiple resources).
        *   Temporal access patterns (e.g., access spikes during specific times).
    *   Output: Probability distribution of future access requests for each user/group. This is *not* a simple prediction of a single resource but a distribution across the entire resource landscape.

2.  **Shadow Policy Generator:**
    *   Input: Behavioral profile probability distribution, current effective permissions, resource sensitivity level, configurable risk tolerance.
    *   Process:
        *   For each user/group, generate a 'shadow policy' representing the *predicted* access needs for a defined time window (e.g., next hour, next day).  This policy *adds* permissions to the existing effective permissions, creating a temporary, broadened set.
        *   The degree to which permissions are added is governed by the risk tolerance setting. Higher risk tolerance = more aggressive permission addition.
        *   Permissions are added *probabilistically* based on the behavioral profile.  If the profile indicates a 70% probability of accessing resource 'X', a permission for 'X' is added to the shadow policy with a corresponding weight.
        *   Implement a 'decay' function to gradually reduce the weight of permissions in the shadow policy over time. This ensures that the policy doesn't remain overly broad indefinitely.
    *   Output: Shadow policy (a temporary set of effective permissions).

3.  **Access Request Interceptor & Policy Fusion Engine:**
    *   Input: User access request, current effective permissions, shadow policy.
    *   Process:
        *   Intercept incoming access requests *before* applying the standard access control checks.
        *   'Fuse' the current effective permissions with the shadow policy. This creates a temporary, combined policy for the duration of the request.
        *   Perform access control checks using the fused policy.
        *   Log all access requests, regardless of outcome, and the policies used (current + shadow).
    *   Output: Access granted/denied decision, logs.

4.  **Policy Feedback & Refinement Loop:**
    *   Process:
        *   Continuously monitor access request logs.
        *   Calculate a 'validation score' for the shadow policy based on the number of requests granted via permissions derived from the shadow policy versus the number of denied requests that *could have* been granted if the shadow policy had been fully incorporated into the effective permissions.
        *   Use the validation score to refine the behavioral profiling model and the shadow policy generation process. This creates a continuous learning loop.

**Pseudocode (Shadow Policy Generation):**

```python
def generate_shadow_policy(user_id, behavioral_profile, risk_tolerance, time_window):
  shadow_policy = {}
  for resource, probability in behavioral_profile.items():
    if probability > risk_tolerance:
      shadow_policy[resource] = probability * (1 - (time_window/max_time_window)) #decay
  return shadow_policy
```

**Novelty:** This is not simply about learning from past mistakes. Itâ€™s about *anticipating* future access needs and proactively preparing the access control environment. The probabilistic nature of the shadow policy and the continuous feedback loop create a dynamic and adaptive system that goes beyond traditional reactive access control.
