## Modular Terrain Adaptation System - 'Gecko-Stride'

**System Overview:** A mobile robotic platform utilizing dynamically configurable, bio-inspired 'micro-legs' integrated with the wedge-based lifting system described in patent 10144587. This system focuses on extreme terrain navigation and stabilization.

**Core Innovation:** Replacing or augmenting the standard rolling elements with independently actuated micro-leg arrays that conform to uneven surfaces, while still leveraging the wedge system for overall height adjustment and load leveling.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Micro-Leg Arrays:** Two arrays (one per side) comprising 25-100 individually actuated 'micro-legs'.
    *   Leg Material: Shape memory alloy (SMA) or piezoelectric actuators for fast, precise movement.
    *   Leg Dimensions: 5-15cm length, 2-5cm diameter.
    *   Footpad: High-friction, self-cleaning elastomer.
    *   Sensor Suite: Each leg equipped with a force sensor, inclinometer, and proximity sensor.
*   **Actuation System:**  Each micro-leg controlled by a dedicated micro-controller.  Power supplied via a flexible, high-current cable network integrated into the chassis.
*   **Chassis Integration:**  The wedge system will serve as the primary lift/lower mechanism, adjusting the overall height of the micro-leg arrays relative to the ground. The chassis will include integrated mounting points and reinforcement to handle the weight and forces of the arrays.
*   **Control System:**  A hierarchical control architecture:
    *   **Low-Level:** Individual leg control for force regulation, stance stabilization, and gait planning.
    *   **Mid-Level:** Array-level control for terrain mapping, obstacle avoidance, and posture control.
    *   **High-Level:** Path planning, task allocation, and system monitoring.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Terrain Mapping Algorithm:**  Real-time terrain mapping using data from the leg sensors and potentially onboard cameras.  Algorithm should generate a 3D point cloud representing the surface geometry.
*   **Gait Planning Algorithm:**  Algorithm to determine optimal leg movements for locomotion. Must consider terrain features, payload weight, and energy efficiency.  Exploration of bio-inspired gaits (e.g., dynamic walking, running) encouraged.
*   **Force Distribution Algorithm:**  Algorithm to distribute the payload weight evenly across the legs. Should account for uneven terrain and dynamic movements.
*   **Adaptive Control Loop:**  Real-time adjustment of leg positions and forces based on sensor feedback. Must handle disturbances and uncertainties.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
initialize_sensors()
initialize_actuators()
create_terrain_map()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    read_sensor_data()
    update_terrain_map()

    //Path Planning
    plan_path()

    //Gait Generation
    generate_gait(path)

    //Actuation
    for each leg in leg_array {
        set_leg_position(leg, gait_position)
        set_leg_force(leg, gait_force)
    }

    //Wedge Adjustment
    adjust_wedge_height(terrain_slope, payload_weight)
}
```

**Novelty & Potential:** The combination of bio-inspired micro-legs with the wedge-based lift system allows for significantly improved terrain adaptation and stability compared to traditional wheeled or tracked robots. The system could be used for:

*   Search and rescue operations
*   Inspection of pipelines and infrastructure
*   Autonomous farming and forestry
*   Planetary exploration.
