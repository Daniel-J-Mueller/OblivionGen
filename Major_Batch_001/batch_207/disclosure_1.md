## Dynamic Content Gating with Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting content access not solely based on payment tokens, but incorporating real-time behavioral biometric analysis of the user to enhance security and personalize access tiers.

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing payment-signifying token system by layering behavioral biometric data collection and analysis. This creates a multi-factor authentication and access control system, shifting from solely *what* the user has paid for, to *who* the user is in real-time, combined with their payment status.

**Components:**

*   **Browser-Side Data Collector:** Javascript module integrated with the content delivery website. Collects non-invasive behavioral data:
    *   Mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns).
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure â€“ if available via WebHID).
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, patterns).
    *   Touchscreen gestures (if applicable).
    *   Device orientation and motion sensor data (with user permission).
*   **Behavioral Biometric Engine (Server-Side):** A machine learning model trained on a dataset of user behavioral profiles. This engine analyzes incoming behavioral data, establishes a baseline for each user, and detects anomalies.
*   **Risk Score Generator:** Based on the anomaly detection, a risk score is generated, reflecting the likelihood of fraudulent activity or unauthorized access.
*   **Dynamic Access Control Module:** This module integrates with the existing payment-signifying token system. It adjusts content access based on a combination of payment status *and* the risk score.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Request:** Client requests content.
2.  **Payment Check:** System checks for a valid payment-signifying token (as in the original patent).
3.  **Behavioral Data Collection:** Browser-side collector starts gathering behavioral data.
4.  **Behavioral Analysis:** Data is sent to the server for analysis.
5.  **Risk Score Calculation:** The Biometric Engine calculates a risk score.
6.  **Dynamic Access Control:**
    *   **High Risk (Invalid Token or High Risk Score):** Content access denied. Further authentication required (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
    *   **Moderate Risk (Valid Token, Moderate Risk Score):** Content access granted with limited functionality (e.g., reduced resolution, limited features). A 'trust-building' period commences where behavioral data is further analyzed.
    *   **Low Risk (Valid Token, Low Risk Score):** Full content access granted.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side - Dynamic Access Control Module):**

```
function grantAccess(request, token, behavioralData) {

  paymentValid = verifyToken(token);
  riskScore = analyzeBehavioralData(behavioralData);

  if (!paymentValid) {
    return "Access Denied: Invalid Payment";
  }

  if (riskScore > thresholdHigh) {
    return "Access Denied: High Risk Detected";
  } else if (riskScore > thresholdModerate) {
    accessLevel = "Limited"; //Reduce quality, features, etc.
  } else {
    accessLevel = "Full";
  }

  //Return content with appropriate access level
  return serveContent(accessLevel);
}
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:** The Biometric Engine continuously learns and refines user profiles, improving accuracy over time.
*   **Device Fingerprinting:**  Combine behavioral biometrics with device fingerprinting to further enhance security.
*   **Gamified Trust Building:** Encourage users to engage in 'trust-building' activities (e.g., solving simple challenges) to lower their risk score.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Allow users to opt-out of behavioral data collection (with reduced functionality).
*   **Integration with existing IAM systems:** Integrate the behavioral biometric engine with existing Identity and Access Management (IAM) platforms.
