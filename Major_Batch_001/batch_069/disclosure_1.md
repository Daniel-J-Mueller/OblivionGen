## Dynamic Audio Scene Construction

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple mixing/attenuation of foreground/background audio. Construct a dynamic audio “scene” based on detected user activity, environmental context, and semantic understanding of the audio content itself. This isn’t just about layering sounds; it’s about *procedurally generating* an audio environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensory Input:** Integrate data from:
    *   Microphone array (directionality, sound event detection – speech, music, alarms, etc.)
    *   Camera (object recognition, people counting, activity recognition – walking, cooking, relaxing)
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, light level, humidity)
    *   Device motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope)
*   **Semantic Audio Analysis:** Utilize AI models to:
    *   Identify the *mood* and *genre* of playing audio.
    *   Detect key *themes* or *events* within the audio (e.g., a car chase in a movie, a tense moment in a podcast).
    *   Analyze speech content for keywords related to user intent or environmental context.
*   **Procedural Audio Engine:** Core component.  Takes sensory input and semantic analysis and procedurally generates additional audio layers. These layers should *not* be pre-recorded samples. They should be generated *in real-time* based on parameters. Example layers:
    *   **Ambient Soundscape:** Generate sounds appropriate for the detected environment. (e.g., birds chirping if “outdoors” is detected, cafe chatter if “cafe” is detected).  Intensity and complexity should scale with detected activity.
    *   **Emotional Resonance:** Generate subtle audio effects that reinforce the *emotional* content of the playing audio. (e.g., low-frequency rumble during a tense scene, shimmering reverb during a hopeful moment).
    *   **Interactive Sound Effects:** Trigger sound effects based on user actions or detected objects. (e.g., footsteps sound when the user is walking, a door creak when a door is detected by the camera).
    *   **Dynamic Echo/Reverb:** Adjust echo and reverb parameters based on the detected room size and surface materials (analyzed by the camera).
*   **Audio Scene Graph:** Represent the constructed audio scene as a graph. Nodes represent individual audio layers. Edges represent relationships between layers (e.g., one layer is “affected by” another, one layer is “dominant over” another). This allows for complex audio manipulations.
*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to define “audio scene profiles” based on their preferences and activities. (e.g., a “focus” profile that minimizes distractions, a “relaxation” profile that emphasizes ambient soundscapes).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function constructAudioScene(sensoryData, semanticData, userProfile):
  // 1. Analyze Sensory and Semantic Data
  environment = analyzeEnvironment(sensoryData)
  mood = analyzeMood(semanticData)
  activity = detectActivity(sensoryData)

  // 2. Create Base Audio Layers
  baseLayers = [
    createAmbientLayer(environment, activity),
    createMoodLayer(mood),
    createContentLayer(semanticData) // original audio content
  ]

  // 3. Apply User Profile
  modifiedLayers = applyUserProfile(baseLayers, userProfile)

  // 4. Build Audio Scene Graph
  sceneGraph = buildSceneGraph(modifiedLayers)

  // 5. Render Audio
  renderedAudio = renderSceneGraph(sceneGraph)

  return renderedAudio
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems focus on simple mixing/attenuation. This proposes a *procedural* approach, generating entire audio environments that adapt to the user and their surroundings. The Audio Scene Graph is a key innovation, enabling complex audio manipulations and dynamic scene creation.
