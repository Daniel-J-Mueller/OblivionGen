**Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Personalized Keyword Prioritization**

**Concept:** Extend the keyword detection system to create dynamically adjustable “acoustic zones” around a user, and prioritize keywords based on learned user context and activity.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4 microphones) integrated into a wearable device (e.g., earbuds, headset, glasses frame, clip-on device).
    *   Edge processing unit (low-power, dedicated neural network accelerator) within the wearable.
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication module.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Zone Definition:** Algorithm to dynamically create acoustic zones based on microphone array data and user head pose estimation (using IMU data in the wearable). The zone focuses on the user’s immediate speaking/listening space.
    *   **Keyword Library:** Expandable keyword library stored locally on the edge processing unit, and cloud-synced for updates.
    *   **Contextual Learning Module:** AI-powered module that learns user activities and contexts based on:
        *   Audio analysis (speech, ambient sounds).
        *   Wearable sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate).
        *   Connected device data (calendar, location, music playback).
    *   **Keyword Prioritization Engine:** Based on contextual learning, this engine assigns dynamic priorities to keywords.  For example:
        *   “Call Mom” - High priority when user is commuting.
        *   “Play Music” - High priority when user is exercising.
        *   “Set Timer” - High priority when user is cooking.
    *   **Adaptive Wakeword Detection:** The first wakeword detector now operates with keyword prioritization. Higher priority keywords have lower detection thresholds.
    *   **Directional Audio Processing:**  Algorithm to focus keyword detection on the user's primary sound source (e.g., their mouth), reducing false positives from ambient noise.
    *   **Privacy Layer:**  Local processing prioritized. Only anonymized usage data is uploaded for model improvement.
*   **Pseudocode (Keyword Detection):**

```
FUNCTION DetectKeyword(audioData, keywordList, contextData)
  // 1. Contextual Analysis
  context = AnalyzeContext(contextData)

  // 2. Prioritized Keyword List
  prioritizedKeywords = GeneratePrioritizedKeywordList(keywordList, context)

  // 3. Directional Audio Processing (Focus on user's mouth)
  focusedAudio = ProcessDirectionalAudio(audioData)

  // 4. Keyword Detection (with priority weighting)
  FOR each keyword IN prioritizedKeywords
    detectionScore = DetectKeywordInAudio(focusedAudio, keyword, keywordPriority)

    IF detectionScore > threshold
      RETURN keyword // Keyword detected

  RETURN null // No keyword detected
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION AnalyzeContext(contextData)
  // Analyze sensor data, calendar events, location, etc.
  // Determine user activity (e.g., commuting, cooking, working)
  RETURN activity
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION GeneratePrioritizedKeywordList(keywordList, activity)
  // Based on user activity, assign priorities to keywords.
  // Higher priority keywords have lower detection thresholds.
  RETURN prioritizedList
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Operation:** The system continuously monitors audio and sensor data. Based on the learned context, it prioritizes keywords and adjusts detection thresholds accordingly. The directional audio processing focuses on the user's primary sound source, improving accuracy. When a keyword is detected, the system triggers the appropriate action.  The system automatically adapts to changing environments and user activities.
