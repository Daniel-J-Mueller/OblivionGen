## Dynamic Audio Scene Generation

**Concept:** Extend the low-latency audio interface to proactively generate *entire audio scenes* based on partial user input and predictive modeling, not just individual words or phrases. The system anticipates a broader context and prepares ambient and supportive audio elements *before* the user fully articulates the request, enhancing immersion and perceived responsiveness.

**Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Contextual Scene Database:** A comprehensive library of audio scenes categorized by topic, emotion, environment (indoor/outdoor), and complexity. Each scene consists of multiple layered audio tracks (ambient sounds, music, sound effects). Scenes are tagged with probability distributions based on common user intents.

*   **Module 2: Intent Prediction Engine:** An AI model trained on user request data (speech & text) to predict not just the *topic* but the *overall intent* and likely *duration* of the request. It outputs a probability distribution over potential audio scenes.

*   **Module 3: Latent Scene Assembler:**  This module receives the scene probability distribution from Module 2. It dynamically assembles a "latent scene" â€“ a low-bandwidth, pre-rendered version of the most likely audio scenes, consisting of key audio tracks and mixing parameters. This is done *in parallel* with the speech recognition and NLU processes.

*   **Module 4:  Real-Time Audio Expansion:** As speech recognition progresses and the NLU provides more confident topic and intent data, this module takes the latent scene and expands it in real-time.  It adds layers of detail, applies dynamic mixing, and adjusts parameters (volume, panning, EQ) to create a rich, immersive audio experience. This process is also happening *in parallel* with further speech processing.

*   **Module 5:  Dynamic Transition Management:** A system to seamlessly transition between different latent scenes as the user's request evolves. This includes crossfading, sound effect bridging, and contextual music shifts.

**Pseudocode (Module 4 - Real-Time Audio Expansion):**

```
function expand_audio(latent_scene, nlu_data, speech_data):
  # latent_scene: Pre-rendered key audio tracks & mixing parameters
  # nlu_data: Natural Language Understanding output (topic, entities, sentiment)
  # speech_data: Ongoing speech recognition results

  # 1. Scene Selection & Parameter Adjustment
  selected_scene = choose_best_scene(latent_scene, nlu_data) # Select most likely scene based on topic/intent
  scene_parameters = adjust_parameters(scene_parameters, nlu_data, speech_data) # Modify volume, EQ, panning based on NLU & speech

  # 2. Layered Audio Addition
  add_ambient_layers(scene_parameters, nlu_data) # Add appropriate ambient sounds (e.g., rain, traffic)
  add_music_layer(scene_parameters, nlu_data, speech_data) # Add background music, adjusting tempo/mood

  # 3. Dynamic Effects
  apply_effects(scene_parameters, speech_data) # Add sound effects based on speech content (e.g., whooshing sounds for transitions)

  # 4. Mixing and Output
  mixed_audio = mix_audio_layers(scene_parameters)
  output_audio = apply_final_EQ_compression(mixed_audio)

  return output_audio
```
