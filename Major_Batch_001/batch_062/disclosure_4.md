## Adaptive Data Shadows & Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the taint propagation and cloaking concept to create 'Data Shadows' – reduced fidelity representations of sensitive data that evolve based on application behavior. Couple this with continuous behavioral profiling to proactively adjust cloaking levels *and* the information contained within the Data Shadow itself.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Shadow Generation & Evolution:**

*   **Initial Shadow:** Upon application request for sensitive data, generate a Data Shadow. This shadow's fidelity is determined by the application’s initial trust level (as per the provided patent).
*   **Dynamic Fidelity Adjustment:**  Monitor application use of the Data Shadow *and* the original sensitive data (if access is granted beyond the shadow).  Analyze patterns:
    *   **High Correlation:** If the application consistently uses the Data Shadow in ways that mirror how it *would* use the original data (inferred through permission requests and network activity), *increase* the shadow’s fidelity incrementally.  Add layers of detail.
    *   **Low Correlation/Anomalous Behavior:** If the application deviates from expected usage, *decrease* the shadow’s fidelity.  Introduce more noise, generalization, or abstraction. This isn't just about reducing accuracy, but actively altering the *type* of information. (See section 3 for alteration techniques).
*   **Shadow Versioning:** Maintain multiple versions of the Data Shadow. Each version corresponds to a specific point in the application’s behavioral timeline. This allows rollback to previous states if anomalous behavior is detected.

**2. Behavioral Profiling Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:** Gather data from multiple sources:
    *   Permission requests
    *   Network traffic (destination IPs, data volume)
    *   CPU/Memory usage patterns
    *   API calls (system and application)
    *   Data access patterns (which parts of the shadow/original data are accessed)
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) to identify deviations from the application’s baseline behavior. This includes:
    *   Unexpected network connections
    *   Sudden spikes in resource usage
    *   Access to data it doesn’t normally use
    *   Unusual API call sequences
*   **Behavioral Score:** Assign a behavioral score to the application based on its observed behavior. This score feeds into the cloaking level adjustment algorithm (see section 4).

**3. Data Alteration Techniques:**

Beyond simple reduction in precision, actively alter the nature of data in the Shadow:

*   **Geospatial Obfuscation:** Replace precise coordinates with centroids of larger regions (e.g., city blocks, zip codes). Implement a probabilistic radius expansion—the radius expands proportionally to detected anomalous behavior.
*   **Temporal Shifting:** Introduce random delays or offsets to timestamps. This can disrupt time-sensitive operations.
*   **Attribute Swapping:** Swap attribute values between similar data points. (e.g., swap ages between users in a demographic database) – controlled by a ‘similarity score’ to maintain plausibility.
*   **Semantic Generalization:** Replace specific data values with broader categories. (e.g., replace a specific product name with its category "electronics").
* **Differential Privacy Noise:** Add carefully calibrated noise to the data to obscure individual records while preserving overall statistical properties.

**4. Cloaking Level Adjustment Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Behavioral Score, Shadow Fidelity, Data Alteration Techniques applied.
*   **Algorithm:** A weighted algorithm that dynamically adjusts the cloaking level and the data alteration techniques.
    *   Higher Behavioral Score = Higher Cloaking Level = More Aggressive Data Alteration
    *   Lower Behavioral Score = Lower Cloaking Level = Less Aggressive Data Alteration
*   **Output:** Adjusted Cloaking Level, selected Data Alteration Techniques.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function adjust_cloaking(behavioral_score, shadow_fidelity, current_alterations):
  if behavioral_score > threshold_high:
    cloaking_level = max_cloaking
    alterations = aggressive_alterations()
  elif behavioral_score < threshold_low:
    cloaking_level = min_cloaking
    alterations = minimal_alterations()
  else:
    cloaking_level = current_cloaking
    alterations = current_alterations

  return cloaking_level, alterations
```

**System Components:**

*   **Shadow Generator Module:** Creates and manages Data Shadows.
*   **Behavioral Profiler Module:** Collects and analyzes application behavior.
*   **Cloaking Control Module:** Adjusts cloaking levels and data alteration techniques.
*   **Data Transformation Engine:** Applies data alteration techniques.
*   **Trust Database:** Stores application trust levels and behavioral history.
