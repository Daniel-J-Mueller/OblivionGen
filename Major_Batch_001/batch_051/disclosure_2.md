## Dynamic Fragment Request Orchestration with Predictive CDN Selection

**Concept:** Extend the CDN balancing system to not only distribute *overall* traffic, but to dynamically orchestrate *individual fragment requests* based on real-time, predictive analysis of CDN performance *specifically for that fragment*. This goes beyond simply choosing a CDN for a user session; it optimizes for each tiny piece of content.

**Specs:**

**1. Fragment Performance Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously monitor performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rate) for *each fragment* served from each CDN.  Store this data in a time-series database indexed by fragment ID, CDN, and time.
*   **Prediction Model:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, LSTM) to predict the expected performance of each fragment on each CDN *before* a request is made.  Inputs: historical fragment performance data, current CDN load, geographic proximity of CDN to user (determined via IP geolocation), time of day, and user device characteristics.
*   **Performance Score:** Generate a "Fragment Performance Score" for each CDN/fragment combination.  Higher score = predicted better performance.

**2. Real-time Request Interceptor & Orchestrator:**

*   **Intercept Mechanism:**  Sit between the viewer device and the manifest server.  Intercept requests for individual fragments.
*   **Dynamic CDN Selection:** For each fragment request:
    *   Query the Fragment Performance Profiling Module to get performance scores for all CDNs.
    *   Select the CDN with the highest performance score for that specific fragment.
    *   Rewrite the request to point to the selected CDN.
    *   Forward the rewritten request.
*   **A/B Testing & Feedback Loop:**  Continuously A/B test different CDN selection strategies (e.g., using different weighting factors in the performance score calculation) and use the results to refine the prediction model.

**3. Manifest Adaptation Module:**

*   **Manifest Augmentation:**  Augment the manifest file to include fragment-level CDN hints.  Instead of simply listing fragment URLs, the manifest will include a list of URLs, one per CDN, for each fragment, along with the predicted performance score.
*   **Client-Side Logic:** Implement client-side logic in the viewer application to:
    *   Read the CDN hints from the manifest.
    *   Prioritize fragment requests based on the performance scores.
    *   Handle CDN failures gracefully (e.g., by falling back to the next best CDN in the list).

**Pseudocode (Request Interceptor):**

```
function interceptFragmentRequest(request):
  fragmentId = request.fragmentId
  userId = request.userId

  performanceScores = getFragmentPerformanceScores(fragmentId) // Returns {cdnId: score}

  bestCdn = findCdnWithHighestScore(performanceScores)

  cdnUrl = getCdnUrlForFragment(fragmentId, bestCdn) // Lookup CDN URL from config

  rewriteRequest(request, cdnUrl)

  forwardRequest(request)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `FragmentPerformanceData`:  { fragmentId, cdnId, timestamp, latency, throughput, errors }
*   `PerformanceScore`: { cdnId: float }
*   Augmented Manifest: List of fragments, each with a list of CDN URLs and associated performance scores.
