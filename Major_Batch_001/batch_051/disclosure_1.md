## Adaptive Packet Prioritization with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Extend sequenced packet delivery with a dynamic prioritization system informed by predicted network congestion and application-level QoS requirements. This goes beyond simply *ordering* packets; it anticipates needs and prioritizes accordingly *before* congestion impacts delivery.

**Specification:**

**I. System Components:**

*   **Packet Sequencer & Prioritizer (PSP):**  Integrated into the source host’s virtualization layer (as suggested by the patent). Responsible for sequencing *and* assigning a dynamic priority value to each encapsulated packet.
*   **Network Prediction Engine (NPE):**  A distributed component collecting real-time network metrics (latency, bandwidth, loss) from multiple points along potential network paths. Uses machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting) to *predict* congestion on those paths. Could leverage sFlow/NetFlow data.
*   **Application QoS Profiler (AQP):**  Monitors resource usage (CPU, memory, network) of applications running on the source/destination hosts. Assigns QoS profiles (e.g., low latency, high bandwidth) to applications based on observed behavior.  APIs for manual override/configuration.
*   **Adaptive Buffer Manager (ABM):** Located on the destination host.  Dynamically adjusts buffer allocation and packet processing order based on sequenced packet data, predicted congestion, and application QoS profiles.

**II. Packet Structure Modification:**

Encapsulated packets will include the following additions:

*   **Sequence Number:** (As in the patent) - For core ordering.
*   **Priority Value:**  Integer value (0-100) indicating packet importance.
*   **QoS Profile Identifier:**  Code corresponding to application QoS profile.
*   **Predicted Congestion Score:** Score (0-100) from NPE reflecting predicted congestion on the primary path.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Packet Creation:** When a packet is generated, the PSP intercepts it.
2.  **QoS Profiling:** PSP consults AQP to determine the application’s QoS profile.
3.  **Congestion Prediction:** PSP queries the NPE for the predicted congestion score on the likely network path.
4.  **Priority Calculation:** PSP calculates a priority value using the following formula:

    `Priority = (QoS_Weight * QoS_Profile_Value) + (Congestion_Weight * (100 - Congestion_Score))`

    Where:

    *   `QoS_Weight` and `Congestion_Weight` are configurable parameters.
    *   `QoS_Profile_Value` is a value associated with the application’s QoS profile (e.g., 80 for high priority, 20 for low priority).
    *   `Congestion_Score` is the predicted congestion score (lower = better).

5.  **Encapsulation & Transmission:** The packet is encapsulated with the sequence number, priority value, and QoS profile identifier, and transmitted.
6.  **Adaptive Buffering:** On the destination host, the ABM receives the encapsulated packets.  
    *   Packets are initially buffered.
    *   ABM prioritizes packet processing based on:
        *   Sequence Number (ensuring correct order within priority groups).
        *   Priority Value (higher value = processed first).
        *   Dynamically adjusts buffer allocation. If predicted congestion is *increasing*, increase buffer size for packets with high priority.

**IV. Pseudocode (ABM - Packet Processing):**

```pseudocode
function process_packet(packet):
  sequence_number = packet.sequence_number
  priority = packet.priority
  congestion_score = packet.congestion_score

  // Buffer management (simplified)
  if congestion_score > threshold:
    increase_buffer_size(priority)

  // Prioritized queue
  insert packet into priority_queue based on priority and sequence_number

  // Process packets from priority_queue
  while priority_queue is not empty:
    next_packet = get_highest_priority_packet(priority_queue)
    process_packet_contents(next_packet) // Deliver to application
```

**V. Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   NPE should be a distributed system with redundancy.
*   AQP can be implemented as a microservice for scalability.
*   Communication between components uses asynchronous messaging.
