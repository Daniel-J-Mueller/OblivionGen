## Dynamic Packet Reconstruction & Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple packet sampling to reconstruct fragmented or obfuscated packets *in hardware* and analyze behavioral patterns within these reconstructed streams. The existing patent focuses on identifying flows and sampling. This builds on that by actually *reassembling* potentially incomplete data for deeper inspection.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Packet Fragment Buffer:** A high-speed, large-capacity buffer (SRAM or similar) capable of storing multiple packet fragments concurrently. Capacity scaled to expected fragmentation levels.
*   **Reassembly Engine:** A dedicated hardware module responsible for reassembling fragmented packets. This engine will include:
    *   **Header Parsing:** Identify fragment headers (IP flags, TCP sequence numbers, etc.).
    *   **Fragment Ordering:** Sort fragments based on sequence numbers and other relevant fields.
    *   **Gap Detection:** Identify missing fragments and implement timeout/discard mechanisms.
    *   **Checksum Verification:** Validate reassembled packet integrity.
*   **Obfuscation Detection/Reversal:**  Hardware logic to detect common obfuscation techniques (e.g., simple encryption, padding) and attempt reversal/decryption using a limited set of pre-programmed keys/algorithms.  (Consider a small, reprogrammable lookup table for keys).
*   **Behavioral Analysis Module:** A dedicated hardware block for real-time analysis of reconstructed packet streams. This module will implement:
    *   **Stateful Inspection:** Track connections and application protocols.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify deviations from established behavioral baselines.
    *   **Signature Matching:**  Detect known malicious patterns.
*   **Flow Control/Prioritization:** Mechanisms to prioritize reassembly and analysis based on flow characteristics (e.g., critical applications, suspicious activity).
*   **Interface:** Standard network interface (e.g., Ethernet, PCIe) for integration with existing network infrastructure.

**2. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// For each incoming packet:
  // 1. Check if packet is a fragment (based on flags).
  IF (isFragment(packet)) THEN
    // 2. Store packet in Fragment Buffer (indexed by Flow ID & Fragment ID).
    storeFragment(packet, Flow ID, Fragment ID);

    // 3. Check if all fragments for this flow are present.
    IF (areAllFragmentsPresent(Flow ID)) THEN
      // 4. Reassemble the complete packet.
      completePacket = reassemblePacket(Flow ID);

      // 5. Verify checksum.  If invalid, discard.
      IF (isValidChecksum(completePacket)) THEN
        // 6. Analyze the complete packet.
        analyzePacket(completePacket);
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ELSE
    // 7. Process as a complete packet (standard analysis).
    analyzePacket(packet);
  ENDIF

// Behavioral Analysis Module:
  // Tracks stateful connections.
  // Applies anomaly detection algorithms.
  // Performs signature matching against known threats.
  // Generates alerts for suspicious activity.

// Obfuscation Detection/Reversal:
  // Detects obfuscation attempts based on packet content and headers.
  // Attempts to reverse obfuscation using pre-programmed keys/algorithms.
  // If successful, analyze the deobfuscated packet.
```

**3.  Data Structures:**

*   **Flow Table:**  Stores information about active flows (Flow ID, Source/Destination IP/Port, Status).
*   **Fragment Buffer Table:** Maps Flow IDs to lists of fragment IDs and pointers to fragment data in the Fragment Buffer.
*   **Signature Database:** Stores known malicious signatures for pattern matching.

**4.  Scaling and Considerations:**

*   **Fragment Buffer Size:**  Dynamically adjustable based on network conditions and flow characteristics.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:**  Utilize dedicated hardware for computationally intensive tasks (checksum verification, signature matching, obfuscation reversal).
*   **Power Consumption:**  Optimize hardware design for low power operation.
*   **Integration with existing security infrastructure:** Support standard security protocols and data formats.
