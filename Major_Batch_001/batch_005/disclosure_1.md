## Adaptive Packet Fragmentation with Contextual Prioritization

**Concept:** Dynamically fragment packets *before* applying credential signatures, incorporating context-aware prioritization to optimize delivery and security. This addresses potential performance bottlenecks caused by large packets with appended signatures and allows for finer-grained control over prioritization *before* signature verification, potentially enhancing security.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Collection Module:**

*   **Input:** Network traffic stream, application metadata (if available), user/device identity (from existing authentication systems).
*   **Processing:** Analyze traffic characteristics (packet size, destination port, application type, user role). Implement a scoring system based on these characteristics. Higher scores indicate higher priority/sensitivity.
*   **Output:** Priority score assigned to each packet.

**2. Adaptive Fragmentation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Packet stream, priority score.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Determine Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) and Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) values.
    *   Based on priority score and MTU, dynamically adjust packet fragmentation strategy:
        *   **High Priority (score > threshold):** Fragment into *smaller* packets to minimize latency and potential dropped packets. Prioritize signature attachment to the *first* fragment, acting as a 'flag' for subsequent fragments.
        *   **Medium Priority:** Standard fragmentation based on MTU.
        *   **Low Priority:**  Larger fragment sizes permissible to reduce overhead.
    *   Implement a “fragment correlation ID” embedded within each fragment header. This ID links all fragments belonging to the same original packet.
*   **Output:** Fragmented packet stream with embedded correlation ID.

**3. Credential Signature Module (Modified):**

*   **Input:** Fragmented packet stream, priority score.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Apply the digital signature and identifier to the *first* fragment of each packet.
    *   Subsequent fragments carry only the fragment correlation ID for reconstruction. This significantly reduces signature overhead.
*   **Output:** Digitally signed fragmented packet stream.

**4. Reconstruction and Verification Engine:**

*   **Input:** Fragmented and signed packet stream.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Reassemble packets based on fragment correlation ID.
    *   Verify the digital signature *only* on the first fragment.
    *   If signature verification is successful, the entire packet is considered authorized.
    *   If signature verification fails, the entire packet is discarded.
*   **Output:** Authorized or discarded packet.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction and Verification Engine):**

```
function reconstruct_and_verify(packet_stream):
  fragments = []
  while packet_stream has data:
    fragment = get_next_fragment(packet_stream)
    fragments.append(fragment)
    if fragment.is_first_fragment():
      signature = fragment.get_signature()
      correlation_id = fragment.get_correlation_id()
      if verify_signature(signature):
        reassembled_packet = reassemble_packet(fragments, correlation_id)
        return reassembled_packet
      else:
        discard_packet()
        return null
    else:
      if fragment.get_correlation_id() != current_packet_correlation_id:
          discard_packet() # Mismatched fragments
          return null
```

**Innovation:**  This approach shifts the focus from securing entire large packets to securing *the initiation* of a fragmented stream.  It reduces signature processing overhead, improves latency, and allows for prioritization *before* signature verification. This is a proactive security measure, potentially preventing malicious packets from being fully processed.  It also allows for greater flexibility in network configuration, particularly in environments with varying MTU sizes.
