## Dynamic Inventory 'Sculpting' with Focused Acoustics

**Concept:** Leverage focused ultrasonic transducers to selectively manipulate inventory items within the holder, creating optimized packing densities or re-orienting items *without* full-scale robotic manipulation or vehicle movement. Think of it as ‘sonic sculpting’ of the inventory load.

**Specs:**

*   **Transducer Array:** A phased array of ultrasonic transducers integrated into the interior surfaces of the inventory holder. Minimum 64 elements, frequency range 20kHz – 80kHz.  Elements should be individually addressable and capable of beamforming.
*   **Sensor Fusion:**  Real-time sensor data feed from:
    *   **Depth Cameras (x2):**  Mounted within the holder, providing a 3D point cloud of the inventory.
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  Mounted on the holder, tracking orientation and motion.
    *   **Load Cells (x4):**  Integrated into the holder base, measuring weight distribution and shifts.
*   **Control System:**  A dedicated processing unit (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano) running a custom control algorithm.  Algorithm components:
    *   **3D Reconstruction:** Process depth camera data to build a real-time 3D model of the inventory.
    *   **Collision Detection:** Identify potential collisions between items during manipulation.
    *   **Acoustic Radiation Force Calculation:**  Determine the force required to move individual items based on their size, weight, and material properties.
    *   **Beamforming Control:**  Control the phase and amplitude of each transducer element to create focused acoustic beams.
*   **Material Considerations:** Inventory holder interior surfaces coated with a sonically reflective material (e.g., polished aluminum) to maximize acoustic energy concentration.
*   **Power Supply:** Dedicated high-efficiency power supply for transducers and control system.
*   **Software Interface:** API for integration with existing inventory management systems and vehicle control software.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Pack Optimization:** Algorithm analyzes inventory and strategically adjusts item positions to maximize space utilization.
    *   **Item Re-Orientation:**  Algorithm re-orients specific items to improve access or prevent damage during transport.
    *   **Gentle Jostling:** Small, targeted acoustic pulses to settle inventory after vehicle maneuvers or during initial load settling.
    *   **"Sonic Separation"**: Targeted acoustic energy to create localized repulsive forces between items, assisting in extraction of a single item from a densely packed configuration.

**Pseudocode (Pack Optimization):**

```
function optimize_pack(inventory_3d_model, holder_dimensions):
  // 1. Calculate current space utilization.
  current_utilization = calculate_space_utilization(inventory_3d_model, holder_dimensions)

  // 2. Identify areas of low density or inefficient packing.
  inefficient_areas = find_inefficient_areas(inventory_3d_model)

  // 3. Iterate through items in inefficient areas:
  for each item in inefficient_areas:
    // 4. Calculate potential new positions:
    potential_positions = calculate_potential_positions(item, inventory_3d_model, holder_dimensions)

    // 5. Evaluate each potential position based on:
    //    a. Space utilization improvement
    //    b. Collision avoidance
    //    c. Stability (center of gravity)
    best_position = evaluate_position(potential_positions)

    // 6. Generate acoustic manipulation plan (transducer activation sequence)
    manipulation_plan = generate_manipulation_plan(item, best_position)

    // 7. Execute manipulation plan (activate transducers)
    execute_manipulation_plan(manipulation_plan)
  return improved_inventory_3d_model
