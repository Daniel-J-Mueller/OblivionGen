## Dynamic Task Weaving & Predictive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend the item placement assistance to *proactively* weave together multiple tasks for a user based on predicted movement and item availability, optimizing workflow and minimizing travel time within the facility.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Core Module:** Existing item placement system (as described in patent) forms the base.
*   **Task Prediction Engine:** AI model trained on historical movement data (user paths, item pick/place rates, facility layout). Predicts the *next likely* item a user will need to interact with *after* completing their current task.
*   **Dynamic Route Planner:** Generates optimized routes incorporating multiple tasks based on the Task Prediction Engine’s output.  This is *not* just A-to-B routing, but a multi-stop itinerary.
*   **Heuristic Prioritization Module:** Scores potential task sequences based on urgency (due dates, order fulfillment priorities), item proximity, and predicted user efficiency.  This influences route planning.
*   **Augmented Reality Interface:** User wears AR glasses or uses a handheld AR device. The interface overlays directional guidance, item highlights, and task information onto the user’s view of the facility.
*   **Haptic Feedback System:** Vest or wristband provides directional cues via vibration patterns, complementing the visual AR guidance.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  User begins an item placement task. System initiates standard placement assistance (illumination, positioning guides).
2.  *Concurrently*, the Task Prediction Engine analyzes the user's current task, historical data, and real-time facility conditions. It identifies potential subsequent tasks (e.g., picking a related item, placing another item in a nearby location).
3.  The Heuristic Prioritization Module ranks the predicted tasks.
4.  The Dynamic Route Planner generates a route that incorporates the completed task *and* the highest-ranked predicted tasks, minimizing total travel distance.
5.  The AR Interface displays the combined route, highlighting the next destination and providing clear visual guidance. The interface also indicates *why* this task sequence has been suggested (e.g., "Next: Pick Item X to fulfill urgent order #123").
6.  As the user progresses, the system continuously re-evaluates the route based on real-time data (e.g., changes in order priority, item availability, user speed).
7.  Haptic feedback reinforces the visual guidance, providing subtle directional cues.

**3. Pseudocode (Route Planning Module):**

```pseudocode
function generateDynamicRoute(currentUser, currentTask, predictedTasks):
  route = [currentTask.destination] // Start with current task destination
  
  sortedTasks = sortTasksByPriority(predictedTasks) //Prioritize tasks
  
  for each task in sortedTasks:
    if task.location is within acceptableDistance(route.lastDestination):
      route.append(task.destination)
    else:
      //Consider a 'detour cost' based on distance and urgency
      detourCost = calculateDetourCost(route.lastDestination, task.location, task.urgency)
      if detourCost < acceptableDetourThreshold:
          route.append(task.destination)
  
  return optimizeRoute(route) //TSP or similar route optimization algorithm
```

**4.  Hardware Requirements:**

*   AR glasses/handheld AR device with robust tracking capabilities.
*   Haptic vest/wristband.
*   Real-time location tracking system (RFID, UWB, etc.).
*   High-bandwidth wireless network.
*   Edge computing infrastructure for real-time processing.

**5.  Potential Extensions:**

*   **Gamification:** Integrate rewards and challenges to incentivize efficient task completion.
*   **Collaborative Task Weaving:**  Dynamically assign tasks to multiple users based on proximity and skill sets.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:**  Identify potential equipment failures based on user movement patterns and usage data.
* **Digital Twin Integration:** Visualize the dynamic route within a digital twin of the facility for simulation and optimization.
