## Multi-Axis Thermal Gradient Mapping & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Expand beyond 2D in-plane thermal conductivity measurement to create a 3D reconstruction of anisotropic thermal properties within a sample. This leverages a phased array of micro-heaters & sensors, combined with computational tomography principles.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor/Heater Array:**
    *   Form Factor: 8x8 grid of micro-fabricated silicon heaters and temperature sensors. Total array size: 2cm x 2cm.
    *   Heater Specs: Each heater element: 200µm diameter, 100µm thick, resistive heating element (Platinum or Tungsten). Power output programmable from 0-100mW per element.
    *   Sensor Specs: Each sensor: Thermistor or RTD, 100µm diameter, integrated within the heater element’s silicon structure for precise temperature readings. Resolution: ±0.1°C.
    *   Spacing: 250µm between heater/sensor centers.
*   **Sample Stage:**
    *   Precision XYZ stage with 10µm resolution for scanning the sample beneath the sensor array.
    *   Vacuum chamber integration to minimize convective heat loss and maintain controlled atmosphere.
    *   Automated sample loading/unloading mechanism.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller with dedicated PWM channels for independent control of each heater element.
    *   High-speed data acquisition system (ADC) for simultaneous temperature readings from all sensors.
    *   Software interface for defining scan patterns, setting heater power levels, and visualizing data.
*   **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    FUNCTION ThermalReconstruction(scan_data, sample_geometry):
      // scan_data: Array of temperature readings from each sensor for each scan position
      // sample_geometry: 3D model of the sample (e.g., CAD import or scanned volume)

      // 1. Heat Diffusion Modeling:
      //    - Solve the heat equation numerically (Finite Element Analysis or Finite Difference Method)
      //    - Model heat flow based on applied heater power and measured temperatures.
      //    - Incorporate anisotropic thermal conductivity values as parameters in the model.
      // 2. Optimization Loop:
      //    FOR each voxel within sample_geometry:
      //      // Estimate initial anisotropic thermal conductivity tensor for the voxel.
      //      // Refine the tensor values using an optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent).
      //      // Iterate until the modeled temperature distribution matches the measured temperature distribution (within tolerance).
      //    END FOR

      // 3. 3D Reconstruction:
      //    - Output a 3D volume representing the anisotropic thermal conductivity tensor at each voxel.
      //    - Visualize the results using color mapping to represent different conductivity directions and magnitudes.
    ```

*   **Data Processing & Visualization:**
    *   Software package for 3D rendering and analysis of reconstructed thermal conductivity data.
    *   Interactive tools for exploring the 3D volume, slicing, and visualizing conductivity vectors.
    *   Export functionality for data in common 3D formats (e.g., VTK, STL).

**Application:** Characterizing thermal properties of complex multi-layer materials, identifying defects in composite structures, optimizing thermal management designs.
