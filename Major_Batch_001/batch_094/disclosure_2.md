## Dynamic Infrastructure Shadowing & Predictive Migration

**Concept:** Expand the failure probability calculations to include a “shadow” infrastructure – a parallel, albeit potentially scaled-down, replica of critical components. This allows for *predictive* migration of workloads *before* a failure occurs, leveraging the shadow infrastructure as a staging area.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadow Infrastructure Definition:**

*   **Granularity:** Define shadow infrastructure at multiple levels: full system replica, component-level (e.g., shadow power supply, shadow network switch), or even virtualized component replicas.
*   **Scaling:** Shadow infrastructure does *not* need to be 1:1 with primary. It can be scaled based on predicted load or criticality of services.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of both primary and shadow infrastructure health metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O, temperature, voltage, etc.).

**2. Predictive Failure Modeling:**

*   **Data Collection:** Collect historical failure data for all infrastructure components. Incorporate real-time telemetry data from sensors.
*   **Correlation Engine:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, time series forecasting) to identify patterns and predict potential failures. This model should go beyond simple mean time between failure (MTBF) and consider factors like workload spikes, environmental conditions, and component age.
*   **Failure Probability Thresholds:** Define adjustable thresholds for predicted failure probabilities. Higher thresholds trigger proactive migration.

**3. Workload Migration Process:**

*   **Migration Profiles:** Define migration profiles for different applications or services. These profiles specify migration steps, data synchronization methods, and rollback procedures.
*   **Pre-Migration Staging:** Before a predicted failure, workloads are partially or fully migrated to the shadow infrastructure. Data synchronization can be achieved through techniques like continuous replication, snapshotting, or block-level mirroring.
*   **Live Cutover:** Upon actual failure detection (or exceeding a predetermined confidence level for the predicted failure), a live cutover is performed to the shadow infrastructure. This minimizes downtime and service disruption.
*   **Automated Rollback:** In case of false positives or migration issues, an automated rollback mechanism restores workloads to the primary infrastructure.

**4. Dynamic Resource Allocation:**

*   **Resource Pooling:**  Implement a resource pooling mechanism that allows dynamic allocation of resources between primary and shadow infrastructure.
*   **Workload Balancing:**  Distribute workloads across both infrastructures to optimize resource utilization and improve overall system performance.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Adjust the size and capacity of the shadow infrastructure based on predicted demand and cost considerations.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Migration Process):**

```
function migrateWorkload(workload, shadowInfrastructure):
  // 1. Pre-Migration (Data Synchronization)
  syncData(workload.data, shadowInfrastructure.storage)

  // 2. Migrate Services (minimal downtime)
  migrateServices(workload.services, shadowInfrastructure.compute)

  // 3. Monitor for Primary Failure
  monitorPrimary(workload.primaryServer)

  // 4. If Primary Fails (or predicted confidence > threshold)
  if (primaryFailed() or predictedConfidence() > threshold):
    // 5. Cutover to Shadow
    cutover(workload, shadowInfrastructure)
  else:
    // 6. Rollback to Primary
    rollback(workload, primaryInfrastructure)

```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect data and prevent unauthorized access to both primary and shadow infrastructures.
*   **Network Configuration:** Design a network architecture that allows seamless communication and data transfer between primary and shadow infrastructures.
*   **Testing & Validation:** Rigorously test and validate the entire system to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.
