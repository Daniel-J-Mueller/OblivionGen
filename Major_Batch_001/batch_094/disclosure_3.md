## Dynamic Sensory Environment via Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend the color/visual response system to incorporate real-time biofeedback data from the user (heart rate, skin conductance, brainwave activity) to dynamically adjust not only color palettes but *all* sensory outputs – lighting, soundscapes, subtle haptic feedback – creating a deeply personalized and immersive experience. 

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensors:** Non-invasive sensors integrated into a wearable (headband, wristband, chair) capable of measuring:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) / Skin Conductance
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) - basic band analysis (Alpha, Beta, Theta, Delta)
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** Dedicated hardware or software module for real-time biofeedback data processing.
*   **Sensory Output Devices:**
    *   Addressable RGB LED array for ambient lighting.
    *   Spatial audio system (headphones or multi-speaker array).
    *   Haptic feedback actuators (integrated into chair or wearable).

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Biofeedback Data Acquisition Module:**  Collects raw sensor data. Noise filtering and artifact removal are critical.
*   **Feature Extraction Module:**  Processes raw data to extract relevant features (e.g., HRV metrics, EDA peak detection, EEG band power).
*   **Emotional State Estimation Module:**  Utilizes machine learning algorithms (trained on labeled biofeedback data) to estimate user’s emotional state (e.g., calm, excited, anxious, focused).  A multi-state model is preferred (not just 'positive'/'negative').
*   **Sensory Mapping Engine:**  The core of the system. Maps estimated emotional states to sensory outputs:
    *   **Color Palette Selection:** Based on emotional state (e.g., calm = cool blues/greens, excited = warm oranges/reds). Extends the existing patent's color palette search to factor in emotional context.
    *   **Soundscape Generation:** Dynamically generates or selects ambient soundscapes (nature sounds, music) that complement the color palette and emotional state.
    *   **Haptic Feedback Control:** Subtle vibrations or pressure changes (e.g., gentle pulses for relaxation, rhythmic patterns for focus).
*   **User Customization Module:**  Allows users to define preferred sensory mappings for different emotional states.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
LOOP:
    GET biofeedback data (HRV, EDA, EEG)
    PROCESS data to extract features
    ESTIMATE emotional state (e.g., calm, focused, anxious)
    
    IF emotional state == "calm":
        SET color palette to [blue, green, teal]
        PLAY soundscape "ocean waves"
        ACTIVATE haptic "gentle pulse"
    ELSE IF emotional state == "focused":
        SET color palette to [white, gray, light blue]
        PLAY soundscape "ambient electronic"
        ACTIVATE haptic "rhythmic vibration"
    ELSE IF emotional state == "anxious":
        SET color palette to [purple, dark blue, gray]
        PLAY soundscape "soft piano"
        ACTIVATE haptic "slow, rhythmic pressure"
    ELSE: 
        SET color palette to default
        PLAY soundscape "neutral ambience"
        DEACTIVATE haptic
    
    UPDATE lighting, audio, and haptic outputs based on selected parameters
    
    DELAY (0.1 seconds)
ENDLOOP
```

**4. Extensions & Novelty:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The system learns user preferences over time, refining sensory mappings to optimize the immersive experience.
*   **Media Content Synchronization:** Integrates with existing audio/video content, dynamically adjusting sensory outputs to complement the narrative and emotional tone. This is an expansion on the original patent's use with audiobooks.
*   **Gamification:**  Utilizes biofeedback data to create interactive experiences. For example, a user could 'control' a virtual environment through relaxation techniques, triggering color and sound changes.
*   **Therapeutic Applications:**  Potential for use in stress reduction, anxiety management, and cognitive training.
