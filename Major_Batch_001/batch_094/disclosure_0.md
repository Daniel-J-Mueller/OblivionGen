## Adaptive Card Environments – “Kinetic Stacks”

**Concept:** Expand the contextual awareness of cards beyond location/time to incorporate user *motion* and *environmental* data, creating “Kinetic Stacks” – dynamically adjusting card presentations based on user activity *and* surroundings. The core idea is to move beyond simple display/dismissal and create card arrangements that *react* to the user’s physical world.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Utilize the full suite of device sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, barometer, ambient light sensor, microphone (for sound event detection), and camera (for scene analysis).
*   **Data Fusion Engine:** A central module responsible for correlating sensor data streams. This needs to filter noise, handle data inconsistencies, and create a unified representation of user activity and environment.
*   **Kinetic Card Types:** Define card types that specifically leverage kinetic data. Examples:
    *   *Proximity Reminder:* Card appears when the user approaches a specific object (identified via camera scene analysis). The card could display information about the object (e.g., product details, historical data) or trigger an action (e.g., unlock a door).
    *   *Activity-Triggered Guidance:* Card provides contextual guidance based on user activity. (e.g., running – displays pace/distance, cycling – displays route information, cooking – displays recipe steps).
    *   *Environmental Awareness:* Card reacts to environmental changes (e.g., low light – suggests turning on flashlight, loud noise – suggests noise cancellation, temperature change – suggests adjusting clothing).
*   **Dynamic Stacking & Arrangement:** Instead of simply layering cards, the system should intelligently arrange them in a 3D space, using perspective and depth cues to prioritize information. Cards can ‘float’ above or behind each other, rotate to face the user, or expand/contract to reveal more/less detail.
*   **Gesture-Based Interaction:** Extend gesture support to include manipulation of the Kinetic Stack. The user should be able to:
    *   Swipe to reorder cards.
    *   Pinch to zoom in/out on a specific card.
    *   Rotate the stack to view cards from different angles.
    *   “Throw” cards to dismiss them or share them with others.

**Pseudocode (Data Fusion Engine):**

```
function processSensorData(accelerometerData, gyroscopeData, cameraData, barometerData, ambientLightData) {
  // Calculate user activity level (stationary, walking, running, etc.)
  activityLevel = calculateActivityLevel(accelerometerData, gyroscopeData);

  // Identify objects and scenes in the user's environment
  environmentData = analyzeCameraData(cameraData);

  // Determine the user's current context (location, time, activity, environment)
  context = createContext(locationData, timeData, activityLevel, environmentData, barometerData, ambientLightData);

  // Return the combined context data
  return context;
}

function createContext(locationData, timeData, activityLevel, environmentData, barometerData, ambientLightData) {
  context = {
    location: locationData,
    time: timeData,
    activity: activityLevel,
    environment: environmentData,
    pressure: barometerData,
    lightLevel: ambientLightData
  };
  return context;
}
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user is cooking. The system detects the user’s activity (cooking) through accelerometer/gyroscope data. Camera analysis identifies the ingredients on the counter. The system displays a “recipe card” with step-by-step instructions, ingredients list, and cooking time estimates. As the user moves around the kitchen, the recipe card dynamically adjusts its position and orientation to remain visible. If the user pauses, the system might proactively display a helpful tip or video tutorial. The barometric data could even provide a 'doneness' estimation based on changes in altitude.
