## Dynamic ACL 'Shadowing' and Predictive Risk Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the semantic difference analysis to create a 'shadow' ACL, actively monitoring network traffic *before* deploying a candidate ACL. Simultaneously, use machine learning to predict potential disruptions based on the shadow ACL's observations.

**Specification:**

**1. Shadow ACL Generation:**

*   Upon receiving a candidate ACL, do *not* immediately deploy.
*   Create a 'shadow' ACL configuration within a dedicated virtual network appliance (VNA). This VNA passively monitors traffic on a mirrored port or network tap.
*   The shadow ACL utilizes the *candidate* ACL ruleset.
*   All traffic is assessed against *both* the deployed ACL and the candidate (shadow) ACL.

**2. Discrepancy Logging & Feature Extraction:**

*   Log all instances where the shadow ACL would have made a *different* decision than the deployed ACL. This constitutes a 'discrepancy'.
*   For each discrepancy, extract the following features:
    *   Source IP/Port
    *   Destination IP/Port
    *   Protocol
    *   Action (Allow/Deny)
    *   Rule ID (from both deployed & candidate ACLs)
    *   Timestamp
    *   Traffic Volume (packets/bytes)
    *   Application Layer Data (if available - categorized)

**3. Predictive Risk Modeling:**

*   Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on historical network traffic data and discrepancy logs.
*   **Input Features:** Extracted features from discrepancy logs (listed above), historical traffic patterns, time of day, day of week, known application signatures.
*   **Output:** A 'Disruption Probability Score' (DPS) – a percentage representing the likelihood that deploying the candidate ACL will cause a service disruption.

**4. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment & Deployment Control:**

*   Establish a configurable DPS threshold.
*   If the DPS exceeds the threshold, deployment is automatically blocked, and an alert is generated.
*   Implement a ‘learning phase’ where the model continuously refines its predictions based on new discrepancy data and feedback from network administrators.
*   Allow manual override of the DPS threshold, but log all overrides with justification.

**5.  Automated Rollback:**

*   If deployment *is* allowed and anomalies are detected post-deployment (e.g., significant increase in blocked traffic, application errors), automatically rollback to the previous ACL configuration.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// On Candidate ACL Received
create_shadow_acl(candidate_acl)
start_traffic_monitoring(shadow_acl)

// While Monitoring
for each packet
  deployed_acl_decision = evaluate_packet(packet, deployed_acl)
  candidate_acl_decision = evaluate_packet(packet, candidate_acl)

  if deployed_acl_decision != candidate_acl_decision
    log_discrepancy(packet, deployed_acl_decision, candidate_acl_decision)
    extract_features(packet)
    update_ml_model(features)

calculate_dps()
if dps > threshold
  block_deployment()
  alert_administrator()
else
  allow_deployment()

// Post-Deployment Monitoring
if anomalies_detected()
  rollback_to_previous_acl()
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Virtual Network Appliance (VNA) with sufficient processing power and memory.
*   Network Tap or Port Mirroring capability.
*   Machine Learning Platform (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Data Storage for discrepancy logs and model training data.
*   Alerting and Monitoring System integration.
