## Adaptive Credential Trust Scoring & Dynamic Reset Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the credential reset process by incorporating a dynamic trust score for the account, informed by real-time behavioral biometrics and device context, and utilizing that score to intelligently orchestrate the reset method – moving *beyond* a static selection of formats.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Engine:**

*   **Input Data:**
    *   Device fingerprint (hardware/software identifiers).
    *   Geolocation (IP address, GPS if available).
    *   Typing cadence & pressure (analyzed during login attempts/form completion).
    *   Mouse/Touch movement patterns.
    *   Time of day/day of week.
    *   Network characteristics (ISP, connection type).
    *   Historical login patterns.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Utilize machine learning (anomaly detection algorithms – e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to establish a baseline behavioral profile for each account.
    *   Calculate a Trust Score (0-100) based on the deviation from the baseline profile. Higher score = higher confidence.
    *   Implement a decay function - Trust Score gradually decreases over time if activity ceases.
*   **Output:** A continuously updated Trust Score for each account.

**2. Dynamic Reset Orchestrator:**

*   **Input:** Account identifier, Trust Score, available credential reset formats (email, SMS, security questions, authenticator app, biometric confirmation).
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Tier 1 (Trust Score 80-100):** Prioritize low-friction methods.  Direct credential replacement via secure link (email/SMS). Authenticator app confirmation.
    *   **Tier 2 (Trust Score 50-79):**  Multi-factor approach. Security questions *combined* with email/SMS verification. Biometric confirmation via device camera.
    *   **Tier 3 (Trust Score 20-49):**  Stringent verification.  Knowledge-based authentication with multiple, complex questions. Mandatory phone call to a verified number. Visual challenge requiring image/video capture.
    *   **Tier 4 (Trust Score 0-19):** Account locked. Manual review required by a human agent.  High-risk activity flagged for security investigation.
*   **Output:** Selected credential reset format and instructions for the user.

**3.  Adaptive Question Generation:**

*   If Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) is required, dynamically generate questions based on publicly available data *and* account-specific transaction history.
*   Example: Instead of "What's your mother's maiden name?", ask "What was the amount of your last transaction with Merchant X?".
*   Utilize NLP to phrase questions in a less predictable manner.

**4. Communication Protocol:**

*   Extend the existing email/SMS communication channels to support a secure, encrypted message format for transmitting the reset instructions.
*   Implement a mechanism for the device to verify the authenticity of the reset message (e.g., digital signature).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Reset Orchestrator):**

```
function selectResetMethod(accountId, trustScore):
  if trustScore >= 80:
    method = "SecureLinkEmailSMS" // Priority: Low Friction
  else if trustScore >= 50:
    method = "KBA + SecureLinkEmailSMS" // Medium Friction
  else if trustScore >= 20:
    method = "DynamicKBA + VisualChallenge" // High Friction
  else:
    method = "AccountLock + ManualReview"
  return method
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced fraud and account takeover attempts.
*   Improved user experience (less friction for legitimate users).
*   Increased security without sacrificing usability.
*   Dynamic adaptation to evolving threat landscapes.
*   Ability to handle compromised credentials more effectively.
