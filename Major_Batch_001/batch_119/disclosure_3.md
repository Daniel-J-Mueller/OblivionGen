## Secure Data Sharding with Dynamic Key Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the multi-key security paradigm to a data sharding system where individual shards are encrypted with different, dynamically assigned keys. This drastically increases the complexity for an attacker, as compromise of one key does *not* reveal the entire dataset.  Furthermore, introduce a 'key orchestra' – a system that governs key rotation, access policies, and shard reconstruction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shard Creation & Encryption:**

*   **Input:** Raw data stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   Data is divided into N shards of approximately equal size.
    *   For each shard:
        *   A unique *shard key* is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
        *   The shard is encrypted using AES-256 (or equivalent) with the shard key.
        *   The shard key is *itself* encrypted under a *master key* and a *policy key*.  The master key is managed centrally. The policy key is determined by attributes of the data itself (e.g., sensitivity level, department ownership).
*   **Output:** N encrypted shards, each associated with a policy key identifier and a master-encrypted shard key.

**2. Key Orchestration Service:**

*   **Components:**
    *   *Master Key Manager:* Securely stores and manages the central master key.  Access restricted to a limited set of authorized services.
    *   *Policy Engine:* Evaluates data attributes and determines the appropriate policy key.  Supports dynamic policy updates.
    *   *Key Rotation Module:* Periodically rotates shard keys and policy keys.  Facilitates seamless key updates without data downtime.
    *   *Access Control Layer:* Enforces access control policies based on user identity, data attributes, and key permissions.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Key Generation:** Generates new shard keys and policy keys.
    *   **Key Encryption/Decryption:** Encrypts/decrypts shard keys under the master key and policy key.
    *   **Policy Evaluation:** Determines the appropriate policy key based on data attributes.
    *   **Access Control:** Grants/revokes access to encrypted shards based on user permissions.
    *   **Auditing:** Logs all key access and data operations.

**3. Data Reconstruction Process:**

*   **Input:** User request for specific data, user credentials.
*   **Process:**
    *   The Key Orchestration Service identifies the shards containing the requested data.
    *   For each shard:
        *   The Key Orchestration Service verifies user permissions.
        *   The Key Orchestration Service retrieves the encrypted shard key.
        *   The Key Orchestration Service decrypts the shard key using the master key and the appropriate policy key.
    *   The decrypted shards are assembled and decrypted using the corresponding shard keys.
*   **Output:** Plaintext data.

**4.  Pseudocode – Data Reconstruction:**

```pseudocode
function reconstructData(userID, dataRequest):
  shards = identifyShards(dataRequest)
  decryptedShards = []

  for shard in shards:
    policyKeyID = shard.policyKeyID
    encryptedShardKey = shard.encryptedShardKey

    //Verify permissions
    if not verifyUserPermissions(userID, policyKeyID):
      return "Access Denied"

    //Retrieve and decrypt shard key
    decryptedShardKey = decryptKey(encryptedShardKey, masterKey, policyKeyID)

    //Decrypt shard
    decryptedShard = decryptData(shard.data, decryptedShardKey)

    decryptedShards.append(decryptedShard)

  return assembleData(decryptedShards)
```

**5. Novel Aspects:**

*   **Dynamic Shard Key Assignment:**  Each shard has a unique key, enhancing security.
*   **Policy-Driven Key Management:**  Keys are tied to data policies, enabling granular access control.
*   **Orchestrated Key Rotation:** Automated key rotation minimizes the impact of key compromise.
*   **Integration of Key Management & Data Sharding:** Combines two powerful security techniques.
