## Dynamic Subspace Merging & Splitting

**Concept:** Extend the existing subspace system by allowing dynamic merging and splitting of subspaces *during* runtime based on object density and user interaction patterns. This allows for a more granular and responsive virtual environment, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing user experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Subspace Density Threshold:** Define a configurable threshold for object density within a subspace. When exceeded, the subspace automatically initiates a split.
*   **Subspace Inactivity Threshold:** Define a configurable threshold for user interaction within a subspace.  When fallen below, the subspace automatically initiates a merge with a neighboring subspace.
*   **Merge/Split Algorithm:** Employ a quadtree or octree-based algorithm for determining optimal merge/split boundaries.  Algorithm should prioritize minimizing disruption to registered objects and maintaining spatial coherence.
*   **Object Migration:**  During a merge or split, objects must be seamlessly migrated to the appropriate new or adjusted subspaces. This requires maintaining object references and updating registration information in real-time.
*   **User Interaction Override:** Allow users (or AI agents) to manually override the automatic merge/split process. This enables localized customization of subspace granularity.
*   **Prediction Module:** Implement a prediction module that anticipates future density/inactivity patterns based on historical data and user behavior. This allows for proactive merge/split operations, minimizing latency.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Define a robust communication protocol between subspace components to facilitate object migration and synchronization during merge/split operations.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Design a resource allocation system that dynamically adjusts computational resources allocated to each subspace based on its size, object density, and user activity.

**Pseudocode (Merge Operation):**

```
function mergeSubspaces(subspaceA, subspaceB):
  // Check if merge is valid (adjacent, compatible object types)
  if not isValidMerge(subspaceA, subspaceB):
    return false

  // Lock both subspaces to prevent concurrent modifications
  lockSubspace(subspaceA)
  lockSubspace(subspaceB)

  // Identify objects in both subspaces
  objectsA = getObjects(subspaceA)
  objectsB = getObjects(subspaceB)

  // Migrate objects from subspaceB to subspaceA
  for each object in objectsB:
    migrateObject(object, subspaceA)
    removeObject(object, subspaceB)

  // Update subspace boundaries to encompass both original subspaces
  updateSubspaceBoundary(subspaceA, subspaceB)

  // Deallocate resources associated with subspaceB
  deallocateSubspace(subspaceB)

  // Unlock subspaceA
  unlockSubspace(subspaceA)

  return true
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-driven subspace shaping:** Utilize machine learning to predict optimal subspace configurations based on user behavior and environment dynamics.
*   **Variable resolution subspaces:** Implement subspaces with variable levels of detail based on distance from the user, optimizing rendering performance.
*   **Subspace persistence:** Allow subspaces to persist across sessions, preserving user customizations and environment state.
*   **Integration with haptic feedback:** Dynamically adjust haptic feedback based on subspace boundaries, enhancing immersion.
