## Adaptive Detail Streaming with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the hybrid stream concept to not only handle provider failure but proactively anticipate bandwidth limitations and user visual focus to dynamically adjust streamed detail *before* connection degradation or perceived performance issues occur.  This isn't just fallback, it’s anticipatory adaptation.

**Specs:**

**1.  Visual Attention Mapping:**

*   **Input:** Video stream, user gaze tracking data (via webcam or VR/AR headset – optional, can default to center-screen focus), scene analysis data (object detection, semantic segmentation).
*   **Process:**
    *   Real-time analysis of the video stream to identify objects and regions of interest.
    *   User gaze tracking provides a “focus area” – a heatmap of visual attention. If no gaze tracking is available, a default algorithm centers the focus area based on dominant motion/objects.
    *   Combine scene analysis and user gaze to create a dynamic “attention map” – a weighted representation of visual importance across the frame. Higher weights indicate areas the user is likely to be looking at or interacting with.

**2. Detail Level Assignment:**

*   **Components:**  Each object (or region) in the frame will be assigned a 'Detail Level' (DL) ranging from 1-5. 
    *   DL1:  Extremely low poly, basic textures, suitable for very low bandwidth.
    *   DL2: Low poly, simplified textures.
    *   DL3: Moderate poly, balanced textures. (Default)
    *   DL4: High poly, detailed textures.
    *   DL5:  Maximum poly, photorealistic textures, advanced effects (e.g., ray tracing).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Initial assignment: DL3 for all objects.
    *   Dynamic adjustment based on:
        *   Attention Map: Objects within the focus area receive higher DLs (4 or 5).
        *   Bandwidth Estimation: System continuously monitors available bandwidth. If bandwidth drops, lower DLs are assigned to less critical objects.
        *   Object Distance/Size: Smaller/more distant objects receive lower DLs.
        *   Motion:  Fast-moving objects may temporarily receive lower DLs to reduce processing load.

**3.  Predictive Pre-Fetch & Streaming Protocol:**

*   **Protocol:** A modified HTTP/3-based streaming protocol optimized for variable-detail content.
*   **Pre-Fetch:**  Based on scene analysis and predicted user gaze direction (using a short-term prediction model), the system proactively requests the higher-detail versions of objects *before* the user focuses on them.  This reduces perceived latency when detail increases.
*   **Detail Switching:** Smooth transitions between detail levels are achieved by blending between different mesh and texture representations.  This avoids jarring visual artifacts.
*   **Content Packaging:** Content is pre-processed and packaged with multiple versions of each object at different detail levels.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side:**
    *   Attention Map Engine
    *   Detail Level Manager
    *   Streaming Client
    *   Rendering Engine
*   **Server-Side:**
    *   Content Packaging System
    *   Bandwidth Monitor
    *   Adaptive Streaming Server

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Detail Level Manager):**

```
function updateDetailLevels(frameData, attentionMap, bandwidth):
  for each object in frameData:
    baseDetailLevel = 3  // Default

    // Adjust based on attention map
    attentionWeight = attentionMap.getWeight(object.position)
    if attentionWeight > 0.7:
      detailLevel = 5
    else if attentionWeight > 0.3:
      detailLevel = 4

    // Adjust based on bandwidth
    if bandwidth < 5 Mbps:
      detailLevel = min(detailLevel, 2)
    else if bandwidth < 10 Mbps:
      detailLevel = min(detailLevel, 3)

    // Apply detail level to object
    object.setDetailLevel(detailLevel)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **AI-Powered Prediction:**  Train a machine learning model to predict user gaze direction based on scene content, past gaze patterns, and contextual information.
*   **Collaborative Streaming:**  Share detail level information between multiple viewers of the same content to optimize bandwidth usage.
*   **Dynamic LOD Generation:**  Implement an algorithm that can dynamically generate lower-detail versions of objects on-the-fly, reducing storage requirements.
