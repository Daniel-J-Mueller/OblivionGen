## Adaptive Network Mirage

**Concept:** Create a dynamic, virtualized network overlay that proactively *mirages* potential network disruptions before they occur, shifting traffic not in reaction to failures, but *anticipating* them. This system uses predictive analytics and AI to construct temporary, mirrored network paths, pre-emptively diverting traffic *before* actual issues arise.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Mirage Engine" - a centralized AI module responsible for predictive analysis and path computation.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time network telemetry (bandwidth utilization, latency, packet loss)
    *   Historical network performance data
    *   External factors (weather patterns, geopolitical events, scheduled maintenance) – API integration with relevant data feeds.
    *   Device health monitoring – SNMP, telemetry streams from network devices.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:**
    *   Utilize a hybrid approach combining time-series analysis (ARIMA, Prophet) with machine learning (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) to identify potential network bottlenecks or failures.
    *   Model each network link with a "risk score" based on predicted probability of disruption.
*   **Mirage Path Computation:**
    *   When a link's risk score exceeds a predefined threshold, the Mirage Engine calculates one or more alternative paths.
    *   Path computation considers multiple factors: cost (latency, bandwidth), capacity, and diversity (avoiding shared failure domains).
    *   The system doesn’t just find *a* path, but a *portfolio* of paths, weighted by their risk-reward profile.
*   **Traffic Shifting Mechanism:**
    *   Employ a combination of techniques:
        *   **SDN Controller Integration:** Leverage existing SDN infrastructure to dynamically adjust routing policies.
        *   **ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path Routing):** Distribute traffic across multiple paths simultaneously.
        *   **Segment Routing (SR):**  Program network devices with explicit path instructions.
    *   Implement "graceful ramp-up" and "ramp-down" procedures to minimize disruption during traffic shifts.
*   **Validation and Feedback Loop:**
    *   Continuously monitor the performance of both the primary and mirrored paths.
    *   Use real-time performance data to refine the prediction algorithms and path computation models.
    *   Implement an “A/B testing” framework to evaluate the effectiveness of different traffic shifting strategies.
*   **Interface:**
    *   Web-based dashboard for visualizing network topology, risk scores, and traffic flows.
    *   API for integration with existing network management systems.

**Pseudocode (Mirage Engine):**

```
function predict_network_disruptions(telemetry_data, historical_data, external_factors) {
  // Apply time-series analysis and machine learning models
  risk_scores = calculate_risk_scores(telemetry_data, historical_data, external_factors)
  return risk_scores
}

function calculate_alternative_paths(risk_scores, network_topology) {
  alternative_paths = []
  for each link with high risk_score {
    path_options = find_alternative_paths(network_topology, link)
    for each path in path_options {
      cost = calculate_path_cost(path)
      diversity = calculate_path_diversity(path)
      weighted_score = (cost_weight * cost) + (diversity_weight * diversity)
      alternative_paths.append((path, weighted_score))
    }
  }
  return alternative_paths
}

function shift_traffic(alternative_paths, current_traffic_flow) {
  // Determine optimal traffic distribution based on weighted scores
  traffic_distribution = calculate_traffic_distribution(alternative_paths)

  // Program SDN controller/network devices to adjust routing policies
  program_network_devices(traffic_distribution)

  // Monitor traffic flow and adjust distribution as needed
  monitor_and_adjust_traffic(traffic_distribution)
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
  risk_scores = predict_network_disruptions()
  alternative_paths = calculate_alternative_paths(risk_scores)
  shift_traffic(alternative_paths)
  sleep(monitoring_interval)
}
```

**Novelty:** This isn’t reactive traffic shifting, it's *proactive* network path creation based on *predicted* disruptions, utilizing a portfolio of paths and continuous learning. The system doesn't wait for a failure to occur; it anticipates and mitigates it before it impacts users.
