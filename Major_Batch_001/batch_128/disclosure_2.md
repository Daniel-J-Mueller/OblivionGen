**Dynamic POP Selection Based on Real-Time Energy Grid Load**

**Concept:** Extend the existing POP selection logic to incorporate real-time data from regional energy grids. Instead of *solely* optimizing for bandwidth cost and CDN load, prioritize POPs located in regions with lower current energy grid load or higher percentages of renewable energy sources. This creates a "green routing" layer, reducing the overall carbon footprint of content delivery.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   Interface with publicly available energy grid data sources (e.g., regional grid operators, EIA).
    *   Fetch real-time data on grid load, energy mix (renewable vs. fossil fuel), and potential congestion.
    *   Data should be updated at a configurable interval (e.g., 5-15 minutes).
2.  **Cost Function Modification:**
    *   Augment the existing cost function (currently based on bandwidth cost and CDN load) with an “Energy Impact Cost”.
    *   `Total Cost = Bandwidth Cost + CDN Load Cost + Energy Impact Cost`
    *   `Energy Impact Cost = Weight * (1 - Renewable Percentage) * Grid Load`
        *   `Weight`: A configurable parameter determining the relative importance of energy impact compared to other costs.
        *   `Renewable Percentage`: The percentage of renewable energy in the grid's current mix.
        *   `Grid Load`: A normalized value representing the current load on the grid (higher load = higher cost).
3.  **POP Ranking Algorithm:**
    *   Modify the existing POP ranking algorithm to incorporate the “Energy Impact Cost” into the overall score.
    *   POPs with lower “Energy Impact Costs” (i.e., located in regions with cleaner energy sources and lower grid load) will be ranked higher.
4.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to dynamically adjust the “Weight” parameter based on pre-defined policies or real-time conditions.
        *   Example: Increase the weight during peak energy demand hours or in regions with high pollution levels.
5.  **Geo-Fencing & Regional Prioritization:**
    *   Allow configuration of geo-fences and regional priorities.
        *   Example: Prioritize POPs in regions with government incentives for renewable energy use.
6.  **Reporting & Analytics:**
    *   Track and report on the energy impact of routing decisions.
        *   Metrics: Total energy saved, percentage of content delivered from renewable sources, carbon footprint reduction.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function select_pop(client_request):
  pops = get_available_pops()
  for pop in pops:
    bandwidth_cost = calculate_bandwidth_cost(pop)
    cdn_load_cost = calculate_cdn_load_cost(pop)
    grid_load = get_grid_load(pop.location)
    renewable_percentage = get_renewable_percentage(pop.location)
    energy_impact_cost = weight * (1 - renewable_percentage) * grid_load
    total_cost = bandwidth_cost + cdn_load_cost + energy_impact_cost
    pop.cost = total_cost
  sorted_pops = sort_pops_by_cost(sorted_pops)
  return sorted_pops[0]
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced carbon footprint of content delivery.
*   Support for sustainable energy initiatives.
*   Potential cost savings through optimized energy usage.
*   Enhanced brand reputation.
