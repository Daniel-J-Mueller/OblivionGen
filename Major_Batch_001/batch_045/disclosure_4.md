## Adaptive Shard Prioritization & Predictive Repair

**Concept:** Extend the existing auto-repair system by incorporating a predictive failure analysis component and a dynamic shard prioritization system. Instead of *reacting* to shard failures, proactively identify potentially failing shards and prioritize repair based on a combined risk assessment. This shifts the paradigm from purely reactive to preventative maintenance, minimizing service disruption.

**Specs:**

**1. Failure Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Monitor shard access patterns (read/write frequency, latency), storage device health metrics (SMART data), network connectivity statistics, and data center environmental factors (temperature, humidity, power consumption).
*   **Model:** Implement a time-series anomaly detection model (e.g., LSTM autoencoder, Prophet) trained on historical data to predict future shard failures.  This model will output a 'Failure Probability Score' for each shard.
*   **Thresholds:** Define configurable thresholds for the Failure Probability Score. Shards exceeding these thresholds are flagged as ‘potentially failing’.
*   **Alerting:** Integrate with an alerting system to notify operations teams of potentially failing shards *before* they actually fail.

**2. Dynamic Shard Prioritization:**

*   **Risk Score Calculation:** Combine the Failure Probability Score with a ‘Criticality Score’. The Criticality Score is determined by the data stored on the shard (e.g., number of active users dependent on the shard, frequency of data updates, data sensitivity)
    `Total Risk Score = (Failure Probability Score * Weight_Failure) + (Criticality Score * Weight_Criticality)`
    *   `Weight_Failure` and `Weight_Criticality` are configurable parameters.
*   **Repair Queue:** Maintain a prioritized repair queue based on the Total Risk Score. Shards with the highest score are repaired first.
*   **Repair Strategy Selection:** Based on the risk assessment, dynamically select the most appropriate repair strategy:
    *   **Proactive Repair:** If a shard has a high Total Risk Score and sufficient resources are available, initiate a repair *before* the shard fails. Recreate the shard on a healthy server.
    *   **Reactive Repair:** Repair failed shards based on the traditional approach.
    *   **Hybrid Repair:** If a shard is nearing failure (high Failure Probability Score), pre-stage the data recreation process. Once the shard fails, the process can complete quickly.

**3. Adaptive Thresholds:**

*   **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor repair success rates and adjust the Failure Probability Score thresholds and weighting factors to optimize the system’s performance.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Employ reinforcement learning to automatically tune the system parameters based on historical data and real-time feedback.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
for each shard in all_shards:
    failure_prob = predict_failure_probability(shard)
    criticality = calculate_criticality(shard)
    risk_score = (failure_prob * weight_failure) + (criticality * weight_criticality)
    shard.risk_score = risk_score

// Prioritize Repair Queue
sort shards by risk_score (descending)

for each shard in sorted_shards:
    if shard.status == 'failed' or shard.risk_score > threshold:
        repair_shard(shard)
        update_metadata(shard)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires a robust monitoring infrastructure to collect shard access patterns, storage device health metrics, and network connectivity statistics.
*   Machine learning models will require significant computing resources for training and inference. Consider using dedicated hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs).
*   Integration with existing data storage and management systems is crucial.
*   The system should be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing number of shards and data volumes.
