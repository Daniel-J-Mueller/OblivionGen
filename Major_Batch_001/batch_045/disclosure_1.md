## Dynamic Cipher Suite Composition via AI-Driven Mutation

**Concept:** Extend the pluggable cipher suite concept beyond simply *adding* pre-defined suites to *dynamically composing* new cipher suites from constituent cryptographic primitives, guided by an AI assessing threat landscapes and performance characteristics. 

**Specification:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Cryptographic Primitive Library:** A comprehensive, modular library of cryptographic functions (encryption algorithms, hashing functions, key exchange mechanisms, etc.). Each primitive is tagged with metadata: performance characteristics (throughput, latency), security strength (key size, resistance to known attacks), computational cost, and dependencies.
*   **AI Threat Assessment Engine:** A continuously learning AI model trained on global threat data (vulnerability reports, exploit databases, network traffic analysis).  The engine generates a "threat profile" reflecting current attack vectors and vulnerabilities.  This profile is expressed as weighted preferences for cryptographic properties (e.g., high resistance to side-channel attacks, preference for post-quantum cryptography).
*   **Cipher Suite Composer:** The core logic that uses the Threat Profile and Primitive Library to construct candidate cipher suites. It employs a genetic algorithm or similar optimization technique.
*   **Sandbox Validation Environment:** A highly secure, isolated environment for testing and validating newly composed cipher suites. This includes fuzzing, performance testing, and formal verification (where possible).

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Client/Server Negotiation:**  Initial TLS handshake establishes baseline cipher suite support. The client advertises its “pluggable capability” as ‘Dynamic Cipher Composition’.
2.  **Threat Profile Request:** The server requests a current Threat Profile from a central server or generates one locally based on observed traffic.
3.  **Composition Initiation:** The server instructs the client to initiate Dynamic Cipher Composition.
4.  **Candidate Generation:** The client's Cipher Suite Composer generates a population of candidate cipher suites, combining primitives from the library based on the Threat Profile.  Example:
    ```pseudocode
    function generate_candidate_suite(threat_profile, primitive_library):
      suite = {}
      suite.key_exchange = select_primitive(threat_profile.key_exchange_preferences, primitive_library.key_exchange)
      suite.encryption = select_primitive(threat_profile.encryption_preferences, primitive_library.encryption)
      suite.authentication = select_primitive(threat_profile.authentication_preferences, primitive_library.authentication)
      return suite
    ```
5.  **Sandbox Validation:** The client validates the candidate suite in its sandbox environment.  Metrics include:
    *   Performance (throughput, latency)
    *   Security (fuzzing results, formal verification)
    *   Compatibility (with existing protocols and systems)
6.  **Iteration & Optimization:** The client uses the validation results to refine the candidate suites, applying genetic algorithms (crossover, mutation) to create new generations.
7.  **Proposal & Negotiation:** The client proposes the optimized cipher suite to the server. The server validates the proposal (potentially in its own sandbox). If accepted, the session proceeds using the dynamically composed cipher suite.
8.  **Continuous Learning:** Validation results (both client and server) are fed back into the AI Threat Assessment Engine to improve the accuracy of future threat profiles and optimize the composition process.

**3. Data Structures:**

*   **Threat Profile:** A JSON object containing weighted preferences for cryptographic properties (e.g., `{"post_quantum_weight": 0.8, "side_channel_resistance": 0.9}`).
*   **Primitive Metadata:**  A JSON object describing each primitive (e.g., `{"name": "AES-256", "algorithm": "AES", "key_size": 256, "performance": {"throughput": 1000, "latency": 1}, "security": {"side_channel_resistance": 0.7}`).

**4. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Standardization:** A standardized interface for primitive metadata and threat profiles is crucial for interoperability.
*   **Trust Model:**  Establish a robust trust model for the AI Threat Assessment Engine and primitive library to prevent malicious manipulation.
*   **Resource Constraints:**  Optimize the composition process to minimize resource consumption on client devices.
