## Dynamic Occlusion Mapping with Biofeedback

**Concept:** Augment depth-based segmentation with real-time biofeedback data to improve object isolation, particularly in scenarios with complex occlusion or dynamic environments (e.g., a person moving while holding an object). The system anticipates occlusion *before* it fully occurs by monitoring physiological signals correlated with attention and anticipation.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Depth Sensor: Time-of-Flight or Structured Light (as in existing patent). Resolution: 720p minimum. Frame rate: 30fps minimum.
    *   Biofeedback Sensor: EEG headset with frontal lobe focus (attention/anticipation detection). Dry-electrode preferred for user comfort. Sampling rate: 250Hz minimum. Alternative: Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor measuring sympathetic arousal – hand/wrist placement.
    *   Eye-Tracking: Optional, but provides valuable data for gaze-contingent processing.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded system (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano) capable of real-time data processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    1.  **Depth Data Acquisition & Processing:** Standard depth map generation and cluster analysis as described in the source patent.
    2.  **Biofeedback Signal Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Real-time acquisition and filtering of EEG/GSR data. Feature extraction: Alpha/Theta band power (EEG), Skin Conductance Level (SCL) – (GSR).
    3.  **Predictive Occlusion Model:**
        *   A recurrent neural network (RNN) – LSTM or GRU architecture – trained to predict the probability of impending occlusion based on depth data and biofeedback features.
        *   Input: Depth map features (cluster size, average depth, variance) + Biofeedback features (Alpha/Theta power, SCL).
        *   Output: Occlusion probability map – a heatmap overlaid on the depth map, indicating regions likely to be occluded in the next few frames.
    4.  **Dynamic Segmentation Refinement:**
        *   The occlusion probability map is used to dynamically adjust the segmentation threshold.
        *   Regions with high occlusion probability receive a lower threshold, increasing the likelihood of including partially occluded pixels in the foreground.
        *   This creates a "soft" segmentation edge, reducing artifacts caused by abrupt occlusion.
    5.  **Kalman Filter Integration:** Use a Kalman filter to track the segmented object’s position and velocity. The biofeedback/occlusion prediction can influence the Kalman filter's process noise, making it more sensitive to potential disruptions.
*   **Output:**
    *   Refined segmented image or 3D point cloud of the object of interest.
    *   Visualization of the occlusion probability map.
    *   Real-time display of biofeedback signals.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Acquire Depth Map and Biofeedback Data
  depthMap = acquireDepthMap();
  biofeedbackData = acquireBiofeedbackData();

  // 2. Predict Occlusion Probability
  occlusionProbabilityMap = predictOcclusion(depthMap, biofeedbackData);

  // 3. Dynamic Segmentation
  segmentedImage = segmentImage(depthMap, occlusionProbabilityMap);

  // 4. Kalman Filter Tracking
  trackedObject = trackObject(segmentedImage);

  // 5. Output
  displayImage(segmentedImage);
  displayMap(occlusionProbabilityMap);
  displayData(biofeedbackData);
}

// Function: predictOcclusion(depthMap, biofeedbackData)
// Input: Depth Map, Biofeedback Data
// Output: Occlusion Probability Map
// Algorithm:
// 1. Extract Features from Depth Map
// 2. Extract Features from Biofeedback Data
// 3. Input Features to Trained RNN
// 4. Output Occlusion Probability Map
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **AR/VR:** Improved object tracking and scene understanding in dynamic environments.
*   **Robotics:** Robust object grasping and manipulation in cluttered scenes.
*   **Human-Computer Interaction:** Gesture recognition and intent prediction based on physiological signals.
*   **Medical Imaging:** Enhanced segmentation of anatomical structures in real-time surgical guidance.
