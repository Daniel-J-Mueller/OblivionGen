## Dynamic Operation Cost Profiling & Adaptive Authorization

**Concept:** Extend the tag-based authorization to incorporate real-time operational cost and system impact metrics, dynamically adjusting access permissions based on current system load and cost thresholds. This goes beyond semantic similarity and focuses on *runtime* behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Cost/Impact Monitor Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time system metrics – CPU usage, memory consumption, network bandwidth, I/O operations, monetary cost of cloud resources (if applicable).  Operation-specific metrics – execution time, number of database queries, API calls.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Assigns a ‘cost score’ to each operation. This score is a weighted sum of the real-time metrics, potentially utilizing machine learning to refine weights based on historical data.
    *   Defines configurable cost/impact thresholds.  These thresholds determine when operations are flagged as ‘high-cost’ or ‘high-impact’.
    *   Tracks cost/impact profiles for each tag. This becomes a historical record of how operations associated with a tag behave under varying load conditions.
*   **Output:**  Real-time cost score for each invoked operation, aggregated cost scores per tag, historical cost profiles.

**2. Adaptive Authorization Engine:**

*   **Input:** Security principal, operation request, operation's associated tag, current real-time cost score, historical cost profile for the tag, configurable system-wide cost/impact limits.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Baseline Check:** Verify initial authorization based on the tag and security principal, as described in the original patent.
    *   **Dynamic Cost Assessment:**
        *   Compare the operation’s real-time cost score to the system-wide cost/impact limits.
        *   If the score exceeds predefined thresholds, *temporarily* reduce the security principal’s access rights associated with that tag. This could involve limiting the number of concurrent requests, throttling the operation’s execution speed, or even blocking access entirely.
        *   Consider the historical cost profile of the tag.  If the tag generally exhibits high costs, apply a more conservative authorization policy.
    *   **Granularity:** Authorization can be adjusted at multiple levels: individual operation instance, user session, or even entire service.
*   **Output:**  Authorization decision (allowed/denied), adjusted access rights (if applicable), and reason for any access restriction.

**3.  User Interface/Management Console:**

*   **Features:**
    *   Visualization of real-time cost scores and historical cost profiles.
    *   Configuration of cost/impact thresholds.
    *   Customizable authorization policies for each tag.
    *   Auditing of authorization decisions and access restrictions.
    *   Alerting mechanism to notify administrators of high-cost operations or potential security risks.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Authorization Engine):**

```
function authorizeRequest(securityPrincipal, operation, tag):
    // Baseline Authorization
    if not isAuthorizedByTag(securityPrincipal, tag):
        return denyAuthorization("Unauthorized Tag")

    // Real-Time Cost Assessment
    realTimeCost = getRealTimeCost(operation)
    systemLimit = getSystemCostLimit()

    if realTimeCost > systemLimit:
        // Apply Temporary Restriction
        throttleRequest(operation) //Or Block/Reduce Concurrent Requests
        logRestriction(securityPrincipal, operation, "High Cost")
        return allowAuthorizationWithRestriction()

    //Consider Historical Profile
    historicalCost = getHistoricalCost(tag)
    if historicalCost > historicalThreshold:
        //Apply More Conservative Policy. Reduce concurrent request limits
        reduceConcurrentRequests(securityPrincipal, tag)
        logRestriction(securityPrincipal, operation, "Historical Cost")
        return allowAuthorizationWithRestriction()

    return allowAuthorization()
```

**Innovation:**  This approach moves beyond simply authorizing access based on *what* an operation does (semantic similarity) to authorizing access based on *how* an operation is behaving *right now*.  It adds a layer of runtime intelligence to the authorization process, enabling dynamic adaptation to changing system conditions and resource constraints. This creates a more robust, efficient, and cost-effective system.
