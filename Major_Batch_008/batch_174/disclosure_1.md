## Dynamic Content Stitching Based on Per-Tile Complexity

**Concept:** Instead of dynamically adjusting *encoding parameters* globally, leverage per-tile complexity analysis during encoding to dynamically stitch together encoded streams at varying resolutions/bitrates *within a single video*.  Complex tiles receive higher bitrate/resolution encoding, while simpler tiles receive lower. This allows for maximal bandwidth efficiency *and* perceived quality, focusing resources where they matter most to the viewer.

**Specs:**

1.  **Tile-Based Encoding:**  Divide each frame into a grid of tiles (e.g., 32x32, 64x64 â€“ configurable).
2.  **Complexity Analysis:**  During encoding, analyze each tile for spatial and temporal complexity. Metrics:
    *   **Motion Vector Variance:**  Higher variance = more motion, higher complexity.
    *   **Texture Variance:**  Higher variance = more detailed texture, higher complexity.
    *   **Edge Density:** More edges = higher complexity
    *   **Color Palette Size:** Larger palette = more complexity.
    *   *Combined Complexity Score:* Weighted sum of above metrics (weights configurable).
3.  **Encoding Profiles:** Predefined encoding profiles (bitrate, resolution, codec settings) corresponding to different complexity tiers (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
4.  **Dynamic Profile Selection:**  Based on the complexity score of each tile, select the appropriate encoding profile for that tile.
5.  **Encoded Tile Storage:** Store each encoded tile as a separate stream/container.  Metadata associating each tile with its encoding profile and original frame/tile coordinates is crucial.
6.  **Client-Side Stitching:** The client receives a manifest file listing all the encoded tiles and their metadata.  The client stitches the tiles together in the correct order to reconstruct the frame *before* decoding.
7.  **Adaptive Stitching:** Monitor network conditions. If bandwidth drops, lower the resolution/bitrate of *newly requested* tiles.  Stitch these lower-quality tiles alongside the previously received higher-quality tiles. This allows for a gradual degradation of quality, providing a smoother viewing experience.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Stitching):**

```
function stitchFrame(frameNumber, tileManifest) {
  // tileManifest contains metadata for each tile in the frame
  sortedTiles = sortTilesByCoordinates(tileManifest) // Ensure correct order
  decodedFrame = emptyFrame(frameWidth, frameHeight)

  for (tile in sortedTiles) {
    tileData = sortedTiles[tile]
    tileStreamURL = tileData.streamURL
    tileCoordinates = tileData.coordinates

    // Fetch tile stream
    tileStream = fetch(tileStreamURL)

    // Decode tile
    decodedTile = decode(tileStream, tileData.codec)

    // Composite decoded tile into the frame
    composite(decodedFrame, decodedTile, tileCoordinates)
  }

  return decodedFrame
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Driven Complexity Analysis:** Utilize a machine learning model to more accurately assess tile complexity, considering semantic content and visual importance.
*   **Region of Interest (ROI) Encoding:** Allow the user (or an AI) to define ROIs within the frame. Tiles within the ROI receive higher encoding priority.
*   **Layered Encoding (Scalable Video Coding):** Combine tile-based encoding with layered video coding for even greater flexibility and adaptability.
