## Dynamic Content Reconstruction via Semantic Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the selective highlighting/hiding to not just portions of *existing* content, but to actively *reconstruct* the content presentation based on user preference and semantic understanding. Imagine a text document, but instead of just highlighting phrases, the system can re-order paragraphs, summarize sections, or even generate connecting text to create a uniquely tailored reading experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Semantic Mapping Engine:**

*   **Input:** Content item (text, image, video, mixed media), Supplemental Information (terms, categories, relationships - similar to the existing patent), User Profile (preferences, reading level, interests).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Content Parsing:** Deconstruct the content into semantic units (sentences, paragraphs, scenes, objects).
    *   **Relationship Extraction:** Identify relationships between these units (cause/effect, supporting evidence, temporal order). This can leverage existing NLP models or be custom-trained.
    *   **Preference Matching:** Compare extracted semantic data with user profile data. Assign relevance scores to each semantic unit based on alignment.
    *   **Reconstruction Planning:** Generate a re-ordered or summarized content plan based on relevance scores, user-defined constraints (e.g., maximum length, desired focus), and relationship dependencies.
*   **Output:** Reconstruction Plan – A directed graph representing the desired content order and any required transformations (summarization, expansion, connection).

**2. Content Transformation Module:**

*   **Input:** Content Item, Reconstruction Plan.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Unit Retrieval:** Extract semantic units from the Content Item based on the Reconstruction Plan.
    *   **Transformation Application:** Apply transformations specified in the Reconstruction Plan (summarization, expansion, connection).  Connection could involve AI-generated transitional text, image insertion, or video clips.
    *   **Rendering:** Assemble the transformed units into a new content presentation.
*   **Output:** Reconstructed Content Item.

**3. User Interface & Control:**

*   **Interactive Semantic Map:** Visually display the relationships between semantic units within the content.  Users can:
    *   Drag and drop units to re-order them.
    *   Select units to expand or summarize them.
    *   Add or remove connections between units.
    *   Define new constraints (e.g., “focus on characters involved in conflict”).
*   **Real-time Reconstruction:** The UI dynamically updates the reconstructed content as the user interacts with the semantic map.
*   **“Style” Presets:** Allow users to apply pre-defined reconstruction styles (e.g., “Executive Summary”, “Detailed Analysis”, “Character Focus”).
*   **Save & Share Reconstruction Plans:** Users can save their custom reconstruction plans and share them with others.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Planning):**

```
function planReconstruction(content, userProfile):
  semanticUnits = extractSemanticUnits(content)
  relationships = extractRelationships(semanticUnits)
  relevanceScores = calculateRelevanceScores(semanticUnits, userProfile)

  sortedUnits = sortUnitsByRelevance(semanticUnits, relevanceScores)

  //Adjust order based on relationships
  for each unit in sortedUnits:
    considerDependencies(unit, relationships, sortedUnits)

  //Apply user constraints (length, focus)
  prunedUnits = applyConstraints(sortedUnits)

  reconstructionPlan = buildDirectedGraph(prunedUnits, relationships)
  return reconstructionPlan
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Tailor educational content to individual student needs and learning styles.
*   **News Aggregation:**  Present news stories from multiple sources, highlighting the information most relevant to the user.
*   **Document Summarization:**  Generate concise summaries of lengthy documents, focusing on key concepts and arguments.
*   **Personalized Storytelling:**  Create interactive narratives where the user can influence the plot and character development.
