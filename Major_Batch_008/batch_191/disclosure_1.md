## Dynamic Content ‘Resurrection’ via Predictive Budget Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the budget control system to proactively ‘resurrect’ content that performed well historically, even if current budget allocation would normally suppress it. This is achieved by modeling content performance decay and allocating a small ‘revival’ budget based on predicted future value.

**Specs:**

*   **Historical Performance Database:** Maintain a database logging key metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions) for each content item over a rolling window (e.g., 30 days). Include timestamps.
*   **Performance Decay Model:** Implement a decay function (exponential or similar) to estimate content ‘value’ over time. Inputs: last active timestamp, historical performance metrics, content category. Output: predicted future value.  This can be a simple weighted average of recent performance, with heavier weight on more recent data, coupled with a decay factor based on content age.
*   **Revival Budget Pool:** Allocate a small percentage of the total budget (e.g., 5-10%) to a 'revival' pool. This pool is separate from the regular budget allocated via the PID controller.
*   **Content Prioritization Algorithm:**
    1.  Identify inactive content (content not served in the last N days - configurable).
    2.  Calculate predicted future value for each inactive content item using the Performance Decay Model.
    3.  Sort inactive content by predicted future value (descending).
    4.  Allocate revival budget to the top-ranked content items, proportionally to their predicted future value, up to the limits of the revival budget pool.
*   **Hybrid Budget Allocation:** Combine the PID controller’s dynamic allocation with the static allocation from the revival budget. Content can receive budget from both sources.
*   **Thresholding & Minimum Allocation:** Implement a minimum budget allocation threshold to prevent excessively small allocations, and a maximum allocation cap to prevent the revival budget from overwhelming the PID-controlled budget.
*   **Reporting & Monitoring:** Track the performance of content allocated from the revival budget separately to assess its effectiveness. Monitor the overall impact on key metrics (e.g., total clicks, conversions).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Each time slice (e.g., every minute)
FOR EACH content item:
    IF content is inactive (not served in last N days):
        predicted_value = CalculatePredictedValue(content.historical_data)
    ENDIF

// Sort inactive content by predicted_value (descending)
sorted_content = Sort(inactive_content, predicted_value)

revival_budget_remaining = total_revival_budget

FOR EACH content in sorted_content:
    allocation = (content.predicted_value / Sum(predicted_values)) * revival_budget_remaining

    IF allocation > minimum_allocation AND allocation < maximum_allocation:
        content.budget += allocation
        revival_budget_remaining -= allocation
    ENDIF
ENDFOR

// PID controller allocates remaining budget as usual.
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond simply optimizing for *current* performance. It proactively seeks to recover value from potentially valuable content that has fallen out of rotation, increasing overall content effectiveness and potentially reducing the need for constant new content creation. This is a predictive system, acting before decay fully sets in.
