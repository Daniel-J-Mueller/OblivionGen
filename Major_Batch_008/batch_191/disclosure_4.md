## Dynamic Access Mask Composition

**Concept:** Extend the control security group functionality to allow for *composed* access masks, building permissions dynamically from multiple sources rather than static definitions.

**Specification:**

*   **Data Structure:** Introduce a "Permission Blueprint" object. This object contains:
    *   `BaseMask`: An integer representing the fundamental access rights.
    *   `ConditionalMasks`: A list of objects, each containing:
        *   `Condition`: A boolean expression evaluated against user/group attributes (e.g., `user.department == "Finance"`, `group.role == "Admin"`, `time_of_day > 9 && time_of_day < 17`).
        *   `Mask`: An integer representing the access rights granted *if* the condition is true.
        *   `Priority`: Integer determining evaluation order if multiple conditions overlap.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  When a user attempts to access a data instance:
    2.  Retrieve the associated Control Security Group(s).
    3.  For each Control Security Group:
        *   Retrieve the Permission Blueprints.
        *   Evaluate each Condition in the Blueprints.
        *   If the Condition is true, apply the corresponding Mask to a running "EffectiveMask".
    4.  Combine the EffectiveMask from all associated Control Security Groups.
    5.  Combine the resulting EffectiveMask with the Native Security Group's permissions (potentially using bitwise OR or other defined method).
    6.  Enforce the combined permission set.
*   **API Extensions:**
    *   `CreatePermissionBlueprint(BlueprintData)`: Creates a new Permission Blueprint.
    *   `UpdatePermissionBlueprint(BlueprintID, BlueprintData)`: Updates an existing Blueprint.
    *   `DeletePermissionBlueprint(BlueprintID)`: Deletes a Blueprint.
    *   `AssociateBlueprintWithGroup(GroupID, BlueprintID)`:  Links a Blueprint to a Control Security Group.
*   **Pseudocode (Access Evaluation):**

```
function evaluateAccess(user, dataInstance):
  nativePermissions = getDataInstanceNativePermissions(dataInstance)
  controlGroups = getControlGroupsForDataInstance(dataInstance)
  effectivePermissions = nativePermissions

  for group in controlGroups:
    blueprints = getBlueprintsForGroup(group)
    groupPermissions = 0

    for blueprint in blueprints:
      if evaluateCondition(blueprint.condition, user):
        groupPermissions |= blueprint.mask

    effectivePermissions |= groupPermissions

  return effectivePermissions
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Highly granular, context-aware access control.
*   Simplified management of complex permission schemes.
*   Dynamically adapts access based on user attributes and time.
*   Scalable to large numbers of users and data instances.
