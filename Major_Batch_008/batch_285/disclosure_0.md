## Dynamic Schema Stitching & Federated Query Expansion

**Concept:** Extend the partial migration system to not only migrate *data objects* but also *schema elements* (stored procedures, functions, views) across disparate database types *during* query execution. This creates a dynamic, federated query environment where the system transparently stitches together schema components from both the original and migrated databases to satisfy complex queries. Furthermore, dynamically expand queries with AI-assisted suggestions based on cross-database schema awareness.

**Specifications:**

**1. Schema Repository & Metadata Enrichment:**

*   Maintain a centralized schema repository detailing the structure and capabilities of both the source and target databases.
*   Augment schema metadata with AI-derived information. This includes:
    *   **Semantic Similarity Scores:**  Calculate the semantic similarity between schema elements (tables, columns, functions) in the source and target databases.  Use Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on database schemas and query logs.
    *   **Transformation Hints:** Generate suggested transformation rules for data type mapping and function calls between the databases.
    *   **Performance Estimates:** Predict query execution costs on both databases based on schema statistics and LLM-derived estimates.

**2. Query Decomposition & Rewriting:**

*   Upon receiving a query, the system decomposes it into subqueries based on data access patterns.
*   Analyze each subquery and determine which database(s) can best fulfill it. Utilize the enriched schema repository and performance estimates.
*   Rewrite subqueries to align with the target database's schema and query language. This includes:
    *   Data type conversions.
    *   Function call substitutions.
    *   Schema element aliasing.
*   Employ LLMs to suggest alternative query rewriting strategies, including query simplification and optimization techniques.

**3. Dynamic Schema Stitching:**

*   During query execution, dynamically stitch together schema elements from both databases.
*   Create virtual views or temporary tables that combine data from multiple sources.
*   Implement a schema resolution mechanism to handle naming conflicts and ambiguity.
*   Leverage AI-assisted schema inference to resolve incomplete or missing schema information.

**4. Federated Query Expansion with AI:**

*   After query decomposition, and *before* rewriting, analyze the query for potential expansion opportunities.
*   Using the semantic similarity scores from the Schema Repository, identify relevant schema elements in *both* databases that could enhance the query results.
*   Generate AI-powered suggestions for expanding the query to include these relevant elements. For example:
    *   “Consider joining with the `customer_preferences` table in the migrated database to personalize the results.”
    *   “You might improve accuracy by filtering on the `product_category` column in the source database.”
*   Present these suggestions to the user (or automatically apply them with appropriate safeguards).

**Pseudocode (Query Expansion):**

```
function expand_query(query, schema_repo):
  subqueries = decompose_query(query)
  expansion_candidates = []
  for subquery in subqueries:
    relevant_schemas = schema_repo.find_relevant_schemas(subquery)
    for schema in relevant_schemas:
      if schema.database != subquery.database: #Check if it is from a different database
        expansion_candidates.append((subquery, schema))

  suggestions = []
  for (subquery, schema) in expansion_candidates:
    suggestion = generate_expansion_suggestion(subquery, schema)
    suggestions.append(suggestion)

  return suggestions

function generate_expansion_suggestion(subquery, schema):
  suggestion_text = "Consider including the '" + schema.name + "' table from the " + schema.database + " database to enhance results."
  # (Optional) Generate a revised query with the expansion included
  return suggestion_text
```

**5.  Self-Learning & Optimization:**

*   Monitor query performance and identify bottlenecks.
*   Collect feedback from users on the quality of query results.
*   Utilize machine learning algorithms to optimize query rewriting strategies and schema stitching mechanisms.
*   Continuously refine the enriched schema repository and improve the accuracy of performance estimates.
