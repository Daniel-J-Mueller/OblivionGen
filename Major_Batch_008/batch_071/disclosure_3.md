## Adaptive Threat Landscape Visualization & Prediction

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core:** Real-time data ingestion pipeline (Kafka, RabbitMQ preferred) capable of handling high-velocity event streams.
*   **Data Storage:** Hybrid approach: Time-series database (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for raw event data, Graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) for relationship modeling.
*   **AI Models:**
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection on event vectors.
    *   **Graph Neural Network (GNN):**  Model trained on the graph database to predict threat propagation pathways.
    *   **Causal Inference Engine:**  Utilizes techniques like Bayesian Networks to determine causal relationships between events.
*   **Visualization Engine:**  Interactive 3D graph visualization.  Nodes represent event clusters, edges represent relationships (causal, correlated, temporal).

**Innovation Description:**

This system extends the idea of event clustering to incorporate a dynamic, predictive threat landscape visualization. Instead of simply identifying anomalous clusters, the system actively models *how* threats propagate based on observed relationships.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Event Ingestion:** Raw events are ingested and transformed into event vectors (as in the provided patent).
2.  **Anomaly Detection:** The VAE identifies anomalous event vectors, flagging potential threats.
3.  **Graph Construction:** Anomalous events are added as nodes to the graph database. Edges are created based on:
    *   **Temporal Proximity:** Events occurring close in time are linked.
    *   **Correlation:** Statistical correlation between event vectors.
    *   **Causal Inference:** The causal inference engine analyzes event sequences to establish potential causal relationships.
4.  **Threat Propagation Prediction:** The GNN is trained on the graph structure to predict how threats might propagate through the network. This could involve predicting which nodes (event clusters) are most likely to be affected next.
5.  **Interactive Visualization:** A 3D graph visualization allows security analysts to:
    *   Explore the threat landscape.
    *   Identify key threat propagation pathways.
    *   Investigate individual event clusters.
    *   Simulate the impact of potential mitigation strategies.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Step):**

```
// GNN Prediction Function
function predict_threat_propagation(graph, starting_node, depth) {
  // Initialize a queue with the starting node
  queue = [starting_node]
  visited = [starting_node]
  predicted_nodes = [starting_node]

  for (i = 0; i < depth; i++) {
    next_level = []
    for (node in queue) {
      neighbors = get_neighbors(graph, node)
      for (neighbor in neighbors) {
        if (not contains(visited, neighbor)) {
          visited.append(neighbor)
          predicted_nodes.append(neighbor)
          next_level.append(neighbor)
        }
      }
    }
    queue = next_level
  }
  return predicted_nodes
}

// get_neighbors function
function get_neighbors(graph, node) {
  // returns all neighbors of node within the graph.
}
```

**Novelty:**

This combines unsupervised anomaly detection with graph-based modeling and prediction. The 3D visualization provides an intuitive way to understand complex threat landscapes and proactively identify potential threats *before* they materialize.  The causal inference component adds a layer of understanding beyond simple correlation. This system isn't just *detecting* threats; it's *predicting* how they will evolve.
