## Dynamic Patch Provenance & Reputation System

**Concept:** Expand upon the patch application and signing process to establish a dynamic provenance and reputation system for patches and patch authors, allowing for granular trust control and automated risk assessment. Current systems verify *if* a patch is signed, this system assesses *who* signed it, *how often* they contribute quality patches, and what the community consensus is regarding their contributions.

**Specs:**

**1. Patch Author Profiles:**

*   Each patch author possesses a digitally signed profile stored on a distributed ledger (blockchain or similar).
*   Profile contains: Author’s public key, contact information (optional), contribution history, community ratings/reviews, and flags (e.g., "verified author," "security expert").
*   Contributions are digitally signed and timestamped.  A contribution is any successfully applied patch.
*   Ratings/reviews are weighted based on the reviewer’s reputation (see 'Reviewer Profiles').

**2. Reviewer Profiles:**

*   Reviewers (users who assess patches) also have digitally signed profiles.
*   Reviewer reputation is calculated based on the accuracy of their past reviews (e.g., how often their flagged patches are subsequently found to be problematic).  A consensus system will calculate reputation.
*   Reviewer reputation influences the weight of their ratings.

**3. Patch Metadata Extension:**

*   All patches include extended metadata referencing the author's profile on the distributed ledger.
*   Metadata includes: Patch version, target application version, dependencies, known issues (if any), and a "confidence score" calculated based on author reputation and community feedback.
*   This metadata is cryptographically linked to the patch content ensuring integrity.

**4. Policy Engine Integration:**

*   The existing patch policy engine is expanded to consider author reputation and patch confidence score.
*   Policies can be defined based on:
    *   Minimum author reputation threshold.
    *   Minimum patch confidence score.
    *   "Trusted author" lists (explicitly approved authors).
    *   "Blacklisted author" lists (authors whose patches are automatically rejected).
*   Granular policies can be applied to different applications or components.

**5. Automated Risk Assessment:**

*   Before applying a patch, the system automatically assesses the risk based on the policy engine and the patch metadata.
*   Risk levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) are displayed to the user.
*   High-risk patches require explicit approval from an administrator.

**6.  Provenance Tracking:**

*   Every patched executable retains a complete provenance record, including: Original executable hash, applied patch hashes, author profiles, timestamps, and risk assessment results.
*   This record is digitally signed and tamper-proof, allowing for complete traceability.

**Pseudocode (Patch Application Flow):**

```
function ApplyPatch(executable, patch):
  patchAuthorProfile = GetAuthorProfile(patch)
  patchConfidence = CalculatePatchConfidence(patchAuthorProfile, communityFeedback)

  if !IsPatchAllowedByPolicy(patch, patchAuthorProfile, patchConfidence):
    return "Patch rejected by policy"

  ApplyPatchToExecutable(executable, patch)
  RecordProvenance(executable, patch, patchAuthorProfile)
  SignPatchedExecutable(executable)
  return "Patch applied successfully"
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AuthorProfile`: { `publicKey`, `contactInfo`, `contributionHistory`, `communityRating`, `flags` }
*   `PatchMetadata`: { `authorProfileId`, `patchVersion`, `targetAppVersion`, `dependencies`, `knownIssues`, `confidenceScore` }
*   `ProvenanceRecord`: { `originalExecutableHash`, `appliedPatchHashes`, `authorProfileIds`, `timestamps`, `riskAssessmentResults`, `digitalSignature` }
