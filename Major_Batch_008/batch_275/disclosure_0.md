## Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & ‘What-If’ Scenario Modeling

**Specification:** A system extending the network visualization service to proactively predict network topology changes based on observed traffic patterns and historical data, coupled with a ‘What-If’ scenario modeling capability.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Traffic Anomaly Detection Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time network traffic data (bandwidth usage, connection frequency, packet size, protocol types) from the provider network.
    *   Process: Employs machine learning (time series analysis, anomaly detection algorithms – LSTM, ARIMA, etc.) to identify deviations from baseline traffic patterns. Defines ‘normal’ behavior using historical data. Flags potential issues or planned changes (e.g., increased traffic to a new service) before they manifest as outages.
    *   Output: Anomaly scores, predicted traffic volume changes, and flags indicating the *type* of predicted change (increase, decrease, new connection, etc.).

2.  **Topology Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Anomaly scores from the Traffic Anomaly Detection Module, current network topology data (as provided by the existing visualization service), historical network change data.
    *   Process: Utilizes a graph neural network (GNN) trained on historical network topology changes to predict how the network topology will likely evolve based on the detected anomalies. The GNN models relationships between network components (resource instances, connections) to extrapolate potential changes.  This prediction will have a confidence score attached.
    *   Output: Predicted future network topology (a graph representing resource instances and connections), confidence score for the prediction, and a timeline for predicted changes.

3.  **‘What-If’ Scenario Modeling Module:**
    *   Input: User-defined scenarios (e.g., "What if we double the traffic to service X?", "What if resource Y fails?", "What if we deploy a new application requiring Z bandwidth?"). These are inputted via the visualization service UI.
    *   Process:  Simulates the impact of the user-defined scenario on the predicted network topology. The simulation engine uses the GNN and traffic modeling techniques to extrapolate the consequences of the scenario.
    *   Output:  Visualized impact of the scenario on the network topology (displayed on the existing visualization service). This includes highlighted areas of potential congestion, resource bottlenecks, and recommendations for adjustments (e.g., scaling resources, adding new connections). This simulation will also display an estimated cost for the suggested changes.

4.  **Automated Remediation Recommendations:**
    *   Input: Predicted network changes (from Topology Prediction Engine) and ‘What-If’ scenario results.
    *   Process: Rule-based engine or reinforcement learning agent that generates automated remediation recommendations (e.g., automatically scaling resources, re-routing traffic, updating security group rules).
    *   Output: A list of recommended actions displayed on the visualization service UI, along with estimated impact and cost.

**Data Flow:**

1.  Real-time network traffic data is ingested by the Traffic Anomaly Detection Module.
2.  Anomalies are detected and fed into the Topology Prediction Engine.
3.  The Topology Prediction Engine generates a predicted future network topology.
4.  Users can define ‘What-If’ scenarios via the visualization service UI.
5.  The ‘What-If’ Scenario Modeling Module simulates the impact of the scenario and displays the results on the visualization service.
6.  The Automated Remediation Recommendations module generates and displays suggested actions.

**UI Integration:**

*   The existing visualization service UI is extended to display the predicted network topology (as an overlay on the current topology).
*   A new “Predictions” panel allows users to view anomaly scores, predicted changes, and confidence levels.
*   The “What-If” Scenario Modeling module is integrated into the UI as a dedicated panel.
*   Automated remediation recommendations are displayed as actionable alerts within the UI.
