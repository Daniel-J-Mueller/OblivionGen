## Adaptive Resonance Doorbell System

**Concept:** A doorbell system that learns and adapts to the acoustic and vibrational 'signature' of a home, differentiating between genuine doorbell presses, impacts, or even specific vocal commands, and proactively adjusting sensitivity or triggering pre-defined actions. This moves beyond simple press detection to contextual awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-sensitivity MEMS accelerometer integrated into the doorbell button housing.
    *   Directional microphone array (3-4 microphones) for sound source localization.
    *   Edge-based Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of running lightweight machine learning models.
    *   Wireless communication module (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) for integration with a central home automation system.
    *   Haptic feedback actuator for button confirmation.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Resonance Profile Creation:** Initial 'learning' phase where the system records ambient vibrations and sounds for a 24-48 hour period. This establishes a baseline 'resonance profile' of the home.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Real-time analysis of incoming vibration and sound data.  Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on the resonance profile. Deviation from the profile indicates a potential event.
    *   **Event Classification:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to classify events based on vibration and sound signatures (e.g., doorbell press, package drop, knocking, voice command).
    *   **Adaptive Sensitivity:** The system dynamically adjusts its sensitivity based on the environment. In noisy environments, it increases the threshold for event detection; in quiet environments, it lowers the threshold.
    *   **Predefined Actions:** User-configurable actions triggered by specific events. Examples:
        *   “Package Drop” – Begin recording video, send notification.
        *   “Knock” – Activate indoor chime, display camera feed.
        *   “Voice Command” – Unlock door, disarm security system.
    *   **Privacy Mode:** Physical switch to disable microphone and camera.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
create ResonanceProfile() //Record ambient vibrations & sounds
train RNN(ResonanceProfile) //Train recurrent neural network
train CNN(EventData) //Train convolutional neural network

//Main Loop
while(true){
    vibrationData = readAccelerometer()
    soundData = readMicrophone()

    anomalyScore = RNN.predict(vibrationData, soundData)

    if(anomalyScore > threshold){
        eventClass = CNN.predict(vibrationData, soundData)

        if(eventClass == "Doorbell"){
            activateChime()
            sendNotification("Doorbell pressed")
        } else if(eventClass == "PackageDrop"){
            startRecordingVideo()
            sendNotification("Package delivered")
        } else if(eventClass == "Knock"){
            displayCameraFeed()
            sendNotification("Someone is at the door")
        } else if (eventClass == "VoiceCommand"){
            executeVoiceCommand()
        }
    }
}
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Implementation of a federated learning approach to improve model accuracy across multiple households without compromising user privacy.
*   Integration with smart lighting systems to illuminate the entryway upon doorbell activation.
*   Support for multiple language voice commands.
*   Robustness to environmental noise and vibration.
