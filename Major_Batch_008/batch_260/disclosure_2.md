## Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment via Biometric Feedback

**Concept:** Augment the proof-of-work challenge difficulty not solely based on password risk and resource sensitivity, but *in real-time* based on user biometric data, specifically cognitive load. This creates a truly adaptive authentication experience – harder when the user is relaxed and focused, easier when they are stressed or distracted.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires integration with a readily available biometric sensor capable of measuring cognitive load. Acceptable sensors include:
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) headset (consumer grade acceptable, focusing on alpha/beta wave ratios).
    *   Pupil dilation/tracking via webcam.
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) monitor.
*   **Software Modules:**
    1.  **Biometric Data Acquisition:** Module to interface with the chosen biometric sensor and collect real-time data.  Data must be normalized and filtered to remove noise.
    2.  **Cognitive Load Assessment:** Algorithm to translate raw biometric data into a ‘cognitive load score’. This score should range from 0 (low load – user relaxed) to 100 (high load – user stressed/distracted).  Machine learning model (trained on user-specific data if possible) preferred for accurate assessment.
    3.  **Dynamic Adjustment Factor Generation:** This module combines the existing risk-based adjustment factor (derived from password complexity, resource sensitivity) *with* the cognitive load score. 
        *   `Final_Adjustment_Factor = Base_Adjustment_Factor * (1 + (Cognitive_Load_Score / 100))`
        *   This formula increases the adjustment factor (and thus challenge difficulty) as cognitive load decreases (user is more focused).
    4.  **Proof-of-Work Challenge Generator:**  Existing generator modified to accept the `Final_Adjustment_Factor` as input.  The generator dynamically adjusts the challenge complexity based on this factor.
    5.  **User Profiling (Optional):**  System tracks user biometric responses over time to build a personalized cognitive baseline. This baseline can be used to improve the accuracy of the cognitive load assessment.

*   **Pseudocode (Challenge Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateChallenge(Base_Adjustment_Factor, Cognitive_Load_Score)
    Final_Adjustment_Factor = Base_Adjustment_Factor * (1 + (Cognitive_Load_Score / 100))
    
    // Existing Proof-of-Work challenge generation logic, modified to use Final_Adjustment_Factor
    Challenge_Complexity = Scale(Final_Adjustment_Factor, Min_Complexity, Max_Complexity)
    
    Challenge = GenerateRandomChallenge(Complexity = Challenge_Complexity)
    
    RETURN Challenge
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **User Experience:**  Ideally, biometric data acquisition should be passive and unobtrusive.  The system should *not* provide feedback to the user about their biometric state.  The goal is to create an authentication experience that *feels* natural and adaptive, rather than intrusive or judgmental. The system could include a calibration phase where it learns how a user's biometrics change in normal, relaxed situations, as well as during a known cognitive load situation.
