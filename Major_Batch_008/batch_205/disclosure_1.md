## Dynamic Inventory Reservation & Predictive Bundling

**Concept:** Expand the reservation functionality to be *predictive* and bundle-focused, leveraging user behavior and external data (e.g., weather, events). This goes beyond simply holding an item; it anticipates future purchases and proactively reserves related items to create tailored bundles.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Real-time user browsing history (items viewed, time spent).
    *   Purchase history (items bought, frequency, value).
    *   Location data (if permission granted).
    *   External API integration: Weather data, local event schedules, social media trends (optional).
*   **Predictive Algorithm:**
    *   Machine learning model trained on historical data to identify purchase patterns and correlations.
    *   Weighted scoring system: Assigns scores to items based on probability of co-purchase, user preferences, external factors.
    *   Dynamic adjustment: Algorithm continuously refines predictions based on real-time data.
*   **Inventory Reservation System:**
    *   'Soft Reservation': System *predictively* reserves items with a limited duration. If the user doesn't complete the purchase, the reservation is released.
    *   Bundle Creation: System automatically creates suggested bundles based on predicted needs.
    *   Tiered Reservation:  Reservations have priority tiers. High-priority (e.g., frequent customers, large order value) reservations are less likely to be released.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   'Your Predicted Bundle': Dedicated section in the app/website displaying suggested bundles with reserved items.
    *   Reservation Expiration Notifications: Reminders about expiring reservations.
    *   Bundle Customization: Users can modify suggested bundles, adding or removing items.
*   **Pseudocode (Bundle Prediction):**

```
function predict_bundle(user_id, current_items_in_cart):
    user_history = get_user_purchase_history(user_id)
    browsing_history = get_user_browsing_history(user_id)
    contextual_data = get_contextual_data(user_location) // Weather, events

    candidate_items = find_candidate_items(user_history, browsing_history, contextual_data)

    scored_items = score_candidate_items(candidate_items, user_history, contextual_data)

    sorted_items = sort_items_by_score(scored_items)

    recommended_items = take_top_n_items(sorted_items, 5) // Recommend top 5 items

    create_bundle(recommended_items, current_items_in_cart)

    return bundle
```

*   **Communication Channel Integration:** Push notifications alerting the user to their personalized bundle and expiring reservations, prompting them to complete the purchase.
