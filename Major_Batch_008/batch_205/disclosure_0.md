**Adaptive Anomaly Detection via Predictive Log Synthesis**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the real-time log analysis service to *proactively* generate synthetic log data representing expected system behavior, and then compare observed logs against this synthesized baseline to identify anomalies with greater precision. This goes beyond simple thresholding or known pattern matching.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Predictive Log Synthesizer (PLS):** A machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network – LSTM or Transformer) trained on historical log data, system metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O), and external event data. The PLS generates synthetic log entries predicting what *should* happen under given conditions. This isn't just replaying logs; it's *predicting* future log entries.
*   **Baseline Log Store:** A time-series database storing the synthetic logs generated by the PLS.  These synthetic logs are time-stamped and indexed for efficient comparison.
*   **Deviation Analysis Engine (DAE):**  Compares incoming, real-time log data with the corresponding synthetic log data from the Baseline Log Store.  The DAE doesn't simply look for exact matches. It calculates a “deviation score” based on a combination of factors:
    *   Log entry absence (a predicted event didn’t occur).
    *   Unexpected log entries (an event occurred that wasn’t predicted).
    *   Parameter deviations (a log entry occurred with values significantly different from predicted values – e.g., a slow database query).
    *   Sequence deviations (an expected sequence of events didn’t occur).
*   **Adaptive Retraining Loop:**  Continuously monitors the deviation scores. If the deviation scores consistently fall within acceptable ranges, the PLS is considered accurate. If deviation scores are consistently high, the PLS is retrained using the recent logs to refine its predictive model.
*   **UI Integration:** The existing UI is extended to display deviation scores alongside the log and event data, highlighting anomalous events.  Users can configure sensitivity thresholds for deviation scores and define actions to be taken when anomalies are detected (e.g., alerts, automated remediation).

**III. Pseudocode - Deviation Analysis Engine (DAE):**

```pseudocode
function calculateDeviationScore(realLogEntry, predictedLogEntry):
  score = 0

  if predictedLogEntry is null:  // Event not predicted
    score += 100

  else:
    if realLogEntry.timestamp != predictedLogEntry.timestamp:
      score += 50

    else:
      // Compare key parameters (e.g., request duration, error codes)
      parameterDeviation = calculateParameterDeviation(realLogEntry, predictedLogEntry)
      score += parameterDeviation * 10

  return score

function calculateParameterDeviation(realLogEntry, predictedLogEntry):
  // Calculate the absolute or relative difference between key parameters
  // Normalize the differences to a scale of 0-1
  totalDeviation = 0
  for each parameter in parametersToCompare:
    difference = abs(realLogEntry.parameter - predictedLogEntry.parameter)
    normalizedDifference = min(1, difference / expectedRangeForParameter) //Limit the impact of each parameter
    totalDeviation += normalizedDifference

  return totalDeviation / numberOfParameters
```

**IV. Implementation Details:**

*   **Model Training:** The PLS can be trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Supervised learning can be used to predict specific events based on historical data, while unsupervised learning can be used to learn the underlying patterns in the log data.
*   **Data Storage:** The Baseline Log Store should be a time-series database optimized for fast read and write operations.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle large volumes of log data. This can be achieved by using a distributed architecture and parallel processing.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:**  Instead of static thresholds for deviation scores, employ a dynamic threshold based on the recent historical deviation scores. This adapts to changing system behavior.
