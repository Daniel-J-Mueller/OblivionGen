## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & 'Contextual Wake'

**Specification:** System for dynamically prioritizing and delivering notifications to voice interface devices based on predicted user need *before* explicit request, leveraging historical data and contextual awareness.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on delaying application launch *until* a trigger. This expands on that by *proactively* preparing the voice interface – not just delaying, but anticipating need and prefetching/preparing relevant data, then *waking* the device with a highly relevant notification.

**Components:**

*   **Contextual Data Aggregator:** Collects data streams:
    *   User Calendar (with permission)
    *   Location Services (with permission)
    *   Device Sensor Data (accelerometer, ambient light, etc.)
    *   Historical App Usage (pattern analysis)
    *   Web/App Activity (via permitted API access – e.g., if user recently booked a flight)
    *   Environmental Data (weather, traffic)
*   **Predictive Engine:**  AI/ML model trained to predict probable user needs based on aggregated contextual data. Outputs a "Need Score" and a ranked list of relevant applications.
*   **Prefetch & Prepare Module:** Based on the Need Score and ranked applications:
    *   Downloads necessary data (e.g., boarding pass, map directions, meeting agenda).
    *   Pre-renders UI elements for voice interaction.
    *   Initiates background processes (e.g., real-time traffic updates).
*   **Adaptive Notification Generator:** Creates notifications tailored to the predicted need.  Includes prioritized information and suggested voice commands.
*   **'Contextual Wake' System:** Instead of a standard audible alert, the device *partially* activates – screen dimly illuminates, a brief, highly relevant audio cue plays (e.g., “Traffic heavy on your commute,” or “Boarding pass ready for Flight 345”).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Engine):**

```
function predict_user_need(contextual_data, user_profile):
  // 1. Feature Extraction
  features = extract_features(contextual_data, user_profile)

  // 2. Need Score Calculation
  need_score = model.predict(features) // ML model output (0.0 - 1.0)

  // 3. Application Ranking
  if need_score > threshold:
    ranked_apps = rank_applications(features, user_profile) // Based on historical usage, context
  else:
    ranked_apps = []

  return need_score, ranked_apps
```

**Operation:**

1.  Contextual Data Aggregator continuously collects data.
2.  Predictive Engine analyzes data, generating a Need Score and ranking applications.
3.  If Need Score exceeds a threshold, the system initiates prefetching and prepares relevant data.
4.  When a relevant trigger event occurs (or proactively, based on confidence), the ‘Contextual Wake’ system partially activates the device, delivering a tailored notification.
5.  User can respond with voice commands, launching the application seamlessly.

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive notification delivery to *proactive* anticipation of user needs, minimizing latency and enhancing user experience.  The 'Contextual Wake' system offers a subtle, less disruptive notification method.
