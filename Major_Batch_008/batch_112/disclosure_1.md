## Dynamic Network Segmentation with Adaptive Cryptographic Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the existing cryptographic key distribution to enable *dynamic network segmentation* based on real-time risk assessment and adaptive cryptographic profiles.  Instead of just securing communication *within* a virtual network, actively *reconfigure* network boundaries and security levels based on observed behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Risk Assessment Engine (RAE):**

*   **Input:** Network traffic data (packet headers, payload metadata - without deep packet inspection for privacy), endpoint behavior (process execution, resource access), threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Function:**  Assigns a risk score to each endpoint and network segment.  Uses machine learning models trained on historical data and current threat landscapes.  Factors in endpoint reputation, observed anomalies, and correlation with known attack patterns.
*   **Output:** Real-time risk scores for endpoints and network segments.  Triggers segmentation and cryptographic profile adjustments based on pre-defined thresholds.

**2. Dynamic Segmentation Manager (DSM):**

*   **Input:** Risk scores from RAE, current network topology, existing virtual network definitions.
*   **Function:** Dynamically adjusts network segmentation by creating or modifying virtual networks or applying micro-segmentation rules. Can isolate compromised endpoints, restrict access to critical resources, or create temporary 'sandbox' environments.  Utilizes software-defined networking (SDN) principles.
*   **Output:** Updated network configuration (SDN rules, firewall policies, routing tables).

**3. Adaptive Cryptographic Profile Manager (ACPM):**

*   **Input:** Risk scores from RAE, network segment identity, existing cryptographic key database.
*   **Function:**  Selects or generates cryptographic profiles based on the risk level of the network segment. Profiles define:
    *   Encryption algorithms (AES, ChaCha20, etc.)
    *   Key lengths (128-bit, 256-bit, etc.)
    *   Key rotation frequency
    *   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) enabled/disabled
    *   Authentication methods (signatures, certificates, etc.)
*   **Output:**  Cryptographic profile identifiers.  Communicates these profiles to the host computing systems via a secure channel. The mapping server distributes keys associated with the profile.

**4. Host Computing System Modifications:**

*   Receives cryptographic profile identifier from ACPM.
*   Retrieves the corresponding cryptographic key from the mapping server.
*   Configures network interfaces and communication stacks to use the specified cryptographic settings.
*   Enforces access control policies based on the active cryptographic profile.

**Pseudocode - ACPM:**

```
function select_cryptographic_profile(risk_score, segment_id):
  if risk_score > 0.9:  // High Risk
    profile_id = "high_security"
    key_length = 256
    encryption_algorithm = "AES-256-GCM"
    pfs_enabled = True
  elif risk_score > 0.5: // Medium Risk
    profile_id = "medium_security"
    key_length = 128
    encryption_algorithm = "AES-128-GCM"
    pfs_enabled = True
  else: // Low Risk
    profile_id = "low_security"
    key_length = 128
    encryption_algorithm = "ChaCha20-Poly1305"
    pfs_enabled = False

  return profile_id, key_length, encryption_algorithm, pfs_enabled
```

**Integration with Existing System:**

*   The RAE, DSM, and ACPM operate as separate modules integrated with the existing mapping server.
*   The mapping server is extended to manage multiple cryptographic key sets, each associated with a specific profile.
*   The host computing systems are modified to request cryptographic keys based on the profile received from the ACPM.
*   A secure channel is established between the ACPM and the host computing systems to prevent tampering with the profile information.
