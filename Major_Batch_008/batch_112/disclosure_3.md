## Dynamic Patch Resolution & Attention Weighting

**Concept:** Instead of fixed patch sizes and equal weighting, dynamically adjust patch resolution based on local image complexity *and* apply attention weights derived from a secondary, lightweight neural network analyzing the patch content. This goes beyond simply mitigating overfitting; it aims to focus computational resources on the most informative regions of the input image.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** High-resolution image (512x512 minimum, supports higher).
*   **Preprocessing:** Image normalization, optional data augmentation (rotation, scaling, minor distortions).
*   **Complexity Map Generation:**
    *   Apply a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter across the entire input image.  This highlights edges and regions of high detail.
    *   Calculate a "complexity score" for each pixel based on the LoG response magnitude.
    *   Generate a complexity map – a grayscale image representing pixel-wise complexity.
*   **Dynamic Patch Resolution:**
    *   Divide the input image into an initial grid of large patches (e.g., 64x64).
    *   For each patch, calculate the average complexity score from the corresponding region of the complexity map.
    *   Based on the average complexity score, *adaptively* subdivide the patch.  Complexity thresholds determine the level of subdivision.
        *   Low complexity: Patch remains 64x64.
        *   Medium complexity: Patch divided into 32x32 sub-patches.
        *   High complexity: Patch divided into 16x16 or even 8x8 sub-patches.
*   **Attention Network:**
    *   A shallow CNN (2-3 convolutional layers, ReLU activations, max pooling) takes each sub-patch as input.
    *   The final layer outputs a single scalar value – the “attention weight” for that sub-patch.
    *   The attention network is trained jointly with the main embedding network (described below).
*   **Embedding Network:**
    *   A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) similar in structure to the existing patent's architecture, utilizing inverted residual blocks.
    *   Each sub-patch is fed into the DCNN *after* being multiplied by its corresponding attention weight.  This effectively scales the features learned from the patch based on its importance.
    *   The output of the DCNN is a feature vector representing the embedding for that patch.
    *   Concatenate the embedding vectors from all patches to form a global embedding vector for the entire image.
*   **Loss Function:**
    *   Standard classification/identification loss (e.g., cross-entropy).
    *   *Regularization Term:* Add a regularization term to the loss function that penalizes excessive patch subdivision. This encourages the network to use larger patches whenever possible, reducing computational cost.
*   **Training:**
    *   Train the entire system (attention network + embedding network) end-to-end using backpropagation.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** GPU acceleration is highly recommended for training and inference.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function generate_embedding(image):
  complexity_map = calculate_complexity_map(image)
  patches = generate_dynamic_patches(image, complexity_map)

  patch_embeddings = []
  for patch in patches:
    attention_weight = attention_network(patch)
    scaled_patch = patch * attention_weight
    embedding = embedding_network(scaled_patch)
    patch_embeddings.append(embedding)

  global_embedding = concatenate(patch_embeddings)
  return global_embedding
```
