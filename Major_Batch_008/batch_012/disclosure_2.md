**Adaptive Trust Scoring & Dynamic Proxy Chaining**

**Concept:** Extend the directory proxy concept by introducing adaptive trust scoring for remote directories and enabling dynamic proxy chaining based on real-time trust levels and resource availability. This creates a self-healing, highly resilient, and secure access network.

**Specifications:**

*   **Trust Score Engine:**
    *   Input: Historical access logs, real-time network health checks (latency, packet loss), security posture reports (vulnerability scans, intrusion detection), and reputation data (threat intelligence feeds) for each remote directory (second network).
    *   Calculation: Weighted scoring algorithm (configurable weights for each input factor) to generate a trust score for each remote directory.  The score will be a value between 0-100.
    *   Output:  Real-time trust score for each remote directory.

*   **Dynamic Proxy Chain Manager:**
    *   Input:  Request to access a resource, trust scores for all known remote directories, network topology data (available proxies, bandwidth), resource availability data (CPU, memory on remote directories).
    *   Logic:
        1.  If the primary remote directory trust score is above a defined threshold (e.g., 80), route the request directly.
        2.  If the primary trust score is below the threshold, identify alternative remote directories with acceptable trust scores and available resources.
        3.  Construct a proxy chain through these alternative directories (e.g., proxy -> directory A -> directory B -> target resource).  Chain length limited to a configurable maximum.
        4.  The chain manager should be able to re-route requests on the fly if a proxy or directory in the chain becomes unavailable or its trust score drops below a threshold.
    *   Output: Proxy chain configuration.

*   **Secure Communication Protocol:**
    *   All communication between proxies and remote directories will be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or higher.
    *   Mutual authentication using client certificates to verify the identity of both the proxy and the remote directory.
    *   Signed request payloads to prevent tampering.

*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Language: Python, Go, or Java.
    *   Framework: Kubernetes for orchestration and scalability.
    *   Data Store:  Time-series database (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB) for storing trust score history and network health metrics.
    *   API: RESTful API for managing proxy chains, configuring trust thresholds, and monitoring system health.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Proxy Chain Manager):**

```
function routeRequest(request):
  targetDirectory = request.targetDirectory
  trustScore = getTrustScore(targetDirectory)

  if trustScore >= TRUST_THRESHOLD:
    return directRoute(request)
  else:
    alternativeDirectories = findAlternativeDirectories(targetDirectory)
    if alternativeDirectories is empty:
      return error("No available alternative directories")

    bestDirectory = selectBestDirectory(alternativeDirectories) // Based on trust, availability

    chain = buildChain(bestDirectory)

    return proxyThroughChain(request, chain)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Machine Learning:** Implement a machine learning model to predict trust score fluctuations based on historical data and real-time events.
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Use a blockchain to maintain an immutable audit trail of all proxy chain configurations and trust score changes.
*   **Automated Remediation:**  Automatically trigger remediation actions (e.g., vulnerability patching, system reboot) based on trust score drops.
