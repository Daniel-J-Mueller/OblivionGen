## Dynamic Resolution Preview Generation

**Concept:** Instead of pre-generating a fixed-resolution preview file, the system dynamically generates preview images at multiple resolutions based on network conditions and client device capabilities *during* video streaming. This tackles the granularity issue in a more responsive and adaptive manner.

**Specs:**

*   **Resolution Tier Definitions:** Define a set of resolution tiers (e.g., 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512). Each tier represents a potential preview image quality.
*   **Bandwidth Estimation Module:** A module continuously estimates the available bandwidth between the server and the client.
*   **Client Capability Reporting:** The client reports its screen resolution, processing power, and preferred preview quality settings.
*   **Dynamic Preview Request Protocol:** A protocol for the client to request preview images at specific resolutions, triggered by seeking or pausing the video.
*   **On-Demand Frame Extraction & Encoding:**  The server extracts frames from the video, encodes them to the requested resolution, and transmits them to the client. Encoding format should be configurable (JPEG, WebP, etc.).
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** Start with a very low-resolution preview image (e.g., 32x32) and progressively enhance it with higher-resolution versions as bandwidth allows.
*   **Caching Mechanism:** Implement caching on both the server and client to reduce redundant frame extraction and encoding.
*   **AI-Assisted Frame Selection:**  Employ a lightweight AI model to select the most representative frames for preview generation, focusing on visually significant moments.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function handlePreviewRequest(client, timestamp):
  bandwidth = estimateBandwidth(client)
  clientCapabilities = getClientCapabilities(client)

  targetResolution = calculateTargetResolution(bandwidth, clientCapabilities)

  frame = extractFrame(video, timestamp)
  encodedFrame = encodeFrame(frame, targetResolution)

  sendEncodedFrame(client)
```

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function requestPreview(timestamp):
  sendPreviewRequest(timestamp)

function handlePreviewResponse(encodedFrame):
  displayEncodedFrame(encodedFrame)

function updatePreviewResolution(bandwidth):
  newResolution = calculateOptimalResolution(bandwidth)
  requestPreview(currentTimestamp)
```

**Innovation:**

This moves beyond a static, pre-computed preview to a dynamically generated one, adapting to real-time conditions. It addresses the limitations of the existing patent by providing a more fluid and responsive preview experience, and minimizes upfront storage/processing requirements. The AI-assisted frame selection adds another layer of optimization, ensuring that the most informative frames are used for preview generation.
