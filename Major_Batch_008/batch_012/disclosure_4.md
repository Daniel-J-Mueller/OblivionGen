## Dynamic Cavity Shaping via Microfluidic Actuation

**Concept:** Extend the fluid control system to *actively reshape* the cavity itself, creating dynamic lensing or variable optical path lengths. This builds on the precise fluid control already present in the patent, moving beyond simple fluid motion *within* a static cavity, to a system where the cavityâ€™s geometry is a controlled variable.

**Specs:**

*   **Cavity Material:** Compliant polymer (e.g., PDMS) bonded to rigid substrate (e.g., glass). The polymer forms the majority of the cavity walls.
*   **Actuation System:** An array of microfluidic channels integrated *within* the compliant polymer cavity walls. These channels, when filled with a secondary, immiscible fluid (different from the display fluids), exert localized pressure, deforming the cavity walls.
*   **Control System Integration:** The existing electrostatic fluid motion control system is expanded to include independent control over the microfluidic actuation channels. This requires additional electrodes and driving circuitry.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Capacitive or piezoresistive sensors embedded *within* the cavity walls to provide real-time feedback on cavity shape and deformation. This is vital for precise control and correction.
*   **Fluid Compatibility:** All fluids (display fluids, actuation fluid) must be chemically compatible with the cavity materials and sensors.
*   **Layered Design:** The cavity is constructed as a multi-layered structure. A rigid base layer provides structural support. An intermediate layer houses the microfluidic channels and sensors. A top layer forms the viewing window.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Define desired optical parameters (e.g., focal length, path length)

function adjustCavityShape(desired_parameter) {
  // Calculate required deformation based on desired parameter
  deformation_map = calculateDeformation(desired_parameter);

  // Determine fluid flow rates needed to achieve deformation
  flow_rates = calculateFlowRates(deformation_map);

  // Send flow rate commands to microfluidic pumps
  setPumpRates(flow_rates);

  // Monitor sensor feedback
  sensor_data = readSensors();

  // Compare sensor data to desired shape
  error = calculateError(sensor_data, desired_shape);

  // Implement feedback control loop (e.g., PID control) to minimize error
  adjustment = applyPID(error);

  // Apply adjustment to pump rates
  pump_rates = adjustPumpRates(pump_rates, adjustment);

  // Repeat loop until desired shape is achieved
  return pump_rates;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Variable Focus Displays:** Dynamically adjust the focal length of the display for improved 3D effects or to compensate for viewer distance.
*   **Tunable Optical Filters:** Alter the optical path length within the cavity to create tunable filters for specific wavelengths of light.
*   **Adaptive Contrast Enhancement:** Locally deform the cavity to manipulate light transmission and improve contrast in specific areas of the display.
*   **Micro-Lenses:** Create arrays of micro-lenses for beam steering or light concentration.
