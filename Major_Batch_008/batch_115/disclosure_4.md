## Dynamic Policy-Driven Image Composition

**Concept:** Extend the automated machine image build process to enable *dynamic* composition of images based on real-time risk assessments and application needs, rather than relying solely on static policy definitions. This shifts from pre-defined "compliant" images to images optimized for a *specific deployment context*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Risk Assessment Module:**

*   **Input:** Application metadata (function, data sensitivity, user base), deployment environment (network topology, access controls, geographic location), threat intelligence feeds (vulnerability databases, active exploits).
*   **Process:**  A risk engine analyzes the input data, assigning a risk score to the deployment.  This score factors in both inherent application vulnerabilities *and* the external threat landscape specific to the target environment.
*   **Output:** A risk profile containing weighted risk factors (e.g., vulnerability severity, exploitability, data sensitivity, network exposure).

**2. Component Selection Engine:**

*   **Input:** Risk profile (from Risk Assessment Module), application package dependencies, existing component repository (OS components, libraries, security tools), policy constraints (minimum required components, prohibited components).
*   **Process:** The engine evaluates available components based on their ability to mitigate identified risks *while* satisfying application dependencies and policy rules.  This involves a cost-benefit analysis â€“ for example, adding a resource-intensive intrusion detection system may be justified in a high-risk environment but not in a low-risk one.
*   **Output:** A curated list of OS components and security tools to be included in the machine image.  This list may include different versions or configurations of the same component based on the risk level.

**3. Dynamic Image Builder:**

*   **Input:** Curated component list (from Component Selection Engine), base OS image.
*   **Process:**  Builds the machine image using the specified components.  This could involve containerization, layering, or other techniques to optimize image size and performance.
*   **Output:** A customized machine image tailored to the specific deployment context.

**4. Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation:**

*   **Process:** Monitor the deployed application and environment for new threats or vulnerabilities.  Re-evaluate the risk profile and trigger a rebuild of the machine image with updated components if necessary.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function buildImage(applicationMetadata, deploymentEnvironment, threatIntelligence):
  riskProfile = assessRisk(applicationMetadata, deploymentEnvironment, threatIntelligence)
  componentList = selectComponents(riskProfile)
  baseImage = getBaseImage()
  customImage = buildImageFromComponents(baseImage, componentList)
  return customImage

function assessRisk(applicationMetadata, deploymentEnvironment, threatIntelligence):
  // Analyze data, calculate risk scores
  riskProfile = calculateRiskProfile(applicationMetadata, deploymentEnvironment, threatIntelligence)
  return riskProfile

function selectComponents(riskProfile):
  componentList = []
  // Iterate through available components
  for component in availableComponents:
    if component satisfies dependencies AND component adheres to policies AND component mitigates risks in riskProfile:
      componentList.append(component)
  return componentList

function buildImageFromComponents(baseImage, componentList):
  // Build image using components
  customImage = buildImage(baseImage, componentList)
  return customImage
```

**Example:**

A low-risk internal application might receive a minimal image with only essential components. A high-risk public-facing application might receive a hardened image with intrusion detection, advanced firewalls, and regular vulnerability scanning tools. This allows for a more flexible and adaptive security posture.
