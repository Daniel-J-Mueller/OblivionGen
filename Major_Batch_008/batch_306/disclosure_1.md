## Dynamic Schema Propagation & Reconciliation

**Concept:** Extend the handshake protocol to not only negotiate data *transfer* but also schema *evolution*. Current systems assume a relatively static schema. This design handles scenarios where transactional and analytical databases evolve schemas independently, and actively reconciles those differences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Schema Fingerprinting:**

*   Each database (transactional & analytical) periodically generates a “schema fingerprint” - a hash representing the complete table schema (column names, data types, constraints, etc.).  This fingerprint is versioned.
*   The handshake protocol is extended to include exchange of these schema fingerprints *before* data transfer negotiation.

**2. Schema Diffing & Resolution:**

*   Upon receiving a schema fingerprint, each database computes a “schema diff” against its own current schema. This diff identifies:
    *   Added columns
    *   Removed columns
    *   Modified column data types
    *   Constraint changes
*   A “Schema Resolution Engine” (SRE) mediates the diff.  The SRE employs a configurable policy:
    *   **Additive:**  Analytical DB adopts new columns from Transactional DB.  Missing columns are populated with NULLs.
    *   **Restrictive:** Analytical DB rejects schema changes from Transactional DB.  Error reported.
    *   **Transformative:** Analytical DB applies pre-defined transformation rules to accommodate schema changes (e.g., type coercion, column splitting/merging). Transformation metadata is stored alongside the schema.
    *   **Versioned Coexistence:**  Multiple schema versions are maintained in the analytical database. Data is tagged with the schema version it conforms to. This enables querying against different schema versions.

**3. Dynamic Data Transformation:**

*   During data transfer, the analytical database applies data transformations based on the reconciled schema.  This includes:
    *   Populating NULLs for added columns.
    *   Coercing data types as specified by the transformation rules.
    *   Filtering out data from removed columns.
*   Transformation logic is generated dynamically based on the stored transformation metadata.

**4. Change Data Capture (CDC) Schema Awareness:**

*   The CDC log includes schema version information alongside each change event.  This ensures that the analytical database can correctly interpret and apply changes, even when schema evolution has occurred.
*   CDC events are validated against the reconciled schema.  Invalid events are rejected or quarantined.

**5.  Data Lineage Tracking:**

*   The system tracks the schema version used for each data element in the analytical database, providing complete data lineage.

**Pseudocode (SRE Policy Application):**

```pseudocode
function applySchemaPolicy(transactionalSchema, analyticalSchema, policy):
  diff = computeSchemaDiff(transactionalSchema, analyticalSchema)

  if policy == "Additive":
    // Add new columns to analyticalSchema
    for each column in diff.addedColumns:
      analyticalSchema.addColumn(column)
  else if policy == "Restrictive":
    raise SchemaMismatchError("Schema mismatch detected")
  else if policy == "Transformative":
    for each column in diff.modifiedColumns:
      transformationRule = getTransformationRule(column.dataType, column.newDataType)
      analyticalSchema.modifyColumn(column, transformationRule)
  else if policy == "Versioned Coexistence":
    // Create new schema version
    newSchemaVersion = createSchemaVersion(transactionalSchema)
    // Tag incoming data with the new schema version

  return analyticalSchema
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `SchemaFingerprint`: {version: int, hash: string, schema: {columnDefinitions: []}}
*   `SchemaDiff`: {addedColumns: [], removedColumns: [], modifiedColumns: []}
*   `TransformationRule`: {sourceDataType: string, destinationDataType: string, conversionLogic: string}
