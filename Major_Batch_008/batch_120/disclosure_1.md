## Quantum Error Mitigation via Simulated Annealing of Result Weights

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing quantum computer pool (as per patent), classical compute cluster with GPU acceleration, high-bandwidth interconnect.
*   **Software:** Quantum control software, classical optimization library (e.g., SciPy, Optuna), data storage (object store preferred).

**Innovation Description:**

The patent describes weighting results from different quantum computers. This design expands on that idea by employing a simulated annealing algorithm *to determine* those weights, adapting in real-time based on a validation set. Instead of static or calibration-based weights, the system dynamically optimizes them.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Validation Set Creation:** Before a quantum computation request, a small, known-solution problem is submitted to the quantum computer pool. Results are collected and used as a validation set. The error between each quantum computer’s result and the known solution is recorded. This builds a 'fitness landscape' for each device.
2.  **Initial Weight Assignment:** Weights are initialized randomly, or using the calibration data already present in the system, assigning a starting 'temperature' to the annealing process.
3.  **Ensemble Result Generation:** The customer’s quantum algorithm is submitted.  Each quantum computer executes the algorithm.
4.  **Simulated Annealing Loop:**
    *   **Weighted Sum:**  An initial ensemble result is generated by summing the results from each quantum computer, weighted by the current weights.
    *   **Error Calculation:** The ensemble result is compared to a validation dataset derived from a subset of known solutions relevant to the customer's problem, calculating an error metric.
    *   **Weight Perturbation:** Weights are randomly perturbed (increased or decreased) with a probability determined by the ‘temperature’ parameter. Larger temperature values allow for larger weight changes.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**  If the perturbed weights result in a *lower* error, they are accepted. If the error *increases*, the new weights are accepted with a probability proportional to `exp(-delta_error / temperature)`. This allows the system to sometimes accept worse solutions to avoid getting stuck in local minima.
    *   **Temperature Reduction:**  The ‘temperature’ parameter is gradually reduced over time (cooling schedule). This decreases the probability of accepting worse solutions, driving the system towards an optimal weight configuration.
5.  **Final Result Output:** After the simulated annealing process converges (temperature is sufficiently low, weights stabilize), the final ensemble result, weighted by the optimized weights, is provided to the customer.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def quantum_ensemble_annealing(quantum_computers, algorithm, validation_set, initial_temperature, cooling_rate, num_iterations):
    weights = initialize_weights(len(quantum_computers))
    best_weights = weights
    best_error = float('inf')

    for iteration in range(num_iterations):
        results = []
        for qc in quantum_computers:
            results.append(qc.execute(algorithm))

        ensemble_result = weighted_sum(results, weights)
        error = calculate_error(ensemble_result, validation_set)

        if error < best_error:
            best_error = error
            best_weights = weights[:] #Copy weights

        new_weights = perturb_weights(weights, iteration)
        delta_error = calculate_error(weighted_sum(results, new_weights), validation_set) - error

        acceptance_probability = 1.0 if delta_error < 0 else math.exp(-delta_error / current_temperature)

        if random.random() < acceptance_probability:
            weights = new_weights

        current_temperature *= cooling_rate
    return weighted_sum(results, best_weights)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Accuracy:**  Dynamically adapting weights to minimize error, potentially leading to more accurate results.
*   **Robustness:** Less reliance on pre-calibration data, as the system learns from its own results.
*   **Adaptability:**  Can adjust to changing conditions in the quantum computer pool (e.g., drift in qubit performance).
*   **Automated Optimization:** The optimization process is automated, reducing the need for manual intervention.
