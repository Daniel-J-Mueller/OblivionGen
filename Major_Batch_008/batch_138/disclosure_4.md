## Adaptive Metric Granularity & Predictive Scaling

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust metric granularity *before* data is generated, coupled with a predictive scaling component for the event-driven compute service.

**Problem:** Current metric systems often collect a fixed set of metrics at a fixed granularity. This leads to either excessive data storage/processing for infrequently used metrics, or insufficient detail when investigating performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, scaling is *reactive* - resources are added *after* a threshold is crossed.

**Innovation:**  Introduce a 'Metric Profile' system controlled by a lightweight machine learning model. This model analyzes incoming event types and predicted load *before* function instances are launched. Based on this analysis, it dictates *which* metrics are collected, and *at what frequency*, for each function instance.  

**Components:**

1.  **Metric Profile Manager (MPM):** A central service maintaining pre-defined Metric Profiles (e.g., ‘Debug’, ‘Standard’, ‘Minimal’).  Each profile specifies:
    *   A list of metrics to collect.
    *   Sampling rate for each metric (e.g., collect ‘latency’ every event, ‘CPU usage’ every 100 events).
    *   Data retention policy.

2.  **Predictive Load Analyzer (PLA):**  A lightweight ML model (e.g., time-series forecasting, regression) trained on historical event data. PLA predicts the expected load (requests/second, data volume) for each event type.

3.  **Dynamic Metric Configurator (DMC):**  Sits *in front* of the event-driven compute service. 
    *   Receives event type information.
    *   Queries PLA for load prediction.
    *   Selects an appropriate Metric Profile based on load prediction (e.g., 'Minimal' for low load, 'Standard' for medium, 'Debug' for high/critical events).
    *   Injects metric configuration data into the execution environment *before* the function instance is launched.  This configuration dictates *which* metrics the function logs, and *how often*.

4.  **Execution Environment Adaptation:** The event-driven compute service is modified to:
    *   Receive metric configuration data.
    *   Configure the function instance’s logging mechanism accordingly.
    *   Only collect and transmit the configured metrics.

5.  **Proactive Scaling Component:** PLA doesn’t just predict load for metrics. Its output also feeds a proactive scaling system. *Before* a surge is detected, the system pre-allocates resources (function instances) based on the load prediction.

**Pseudocode (DMC):**

```
function configure_function(event_type):
  load_prediction = PLA.predict_load(event_type)

  if load_prediction < low_threshold:
    metric_profile = MPM.get_profile("Minimal")
  elif load_prediction < medium_threshold:
    metric_profile = MPM.get_profile("Standard")
  else:
    metric_profile = MPM.get_profile("Debug")

  metric_config = metric_profile.get_config()  // Returns list of metric names & sampling rates
  inject_metric_config(function_instance, metric_config)

  return function_instance
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Overhead:**  Collects only necessary metrics, minimizing storage and processing costs.
*   **Improved Visibility:**  Collects detailed metrics for critical events, enabling faster troubleshooting.
*   **Proactive Scaling:**  Reduces latency and improves user experience.
*   **Adaptability:**  The ML model can learn from historical data and adapt to changing workloads.
