## Dynamic Order Splitting & Predictive Consolidation

**Concept:** Extend the multi-channel order management system to *dynamically split* and *predictively consolidate* orders *before* they hit the aggregated queue, optimizing for delivery efficiency and minimizing costs. This goes beyond simply routing orders to different delivery channels; it actively restructures them based on real-time conditions and predictive modeling.

**Specifications:**

**1. Order Decomposition Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw order data from any connected ordering channel.
*   **Function:**  Analyze the order contents (items, quantities) and determine potential decomposition points.  Decomposition prioritizes items from the same vendor/preparation station within a merchant.
*   **Output:** A set of “sub-orders” representing logically separable parts of the original order. Example: A single order with pizza and salad might be split into “Pizza Sub-Order” and “Salad Sub-Order”.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function decompose_order(order):
  sub_orders = []
  items_by_vendor = group_items_by_vendor(order.items)
  for vendor, items in items_by_vendor:
    sub_order = create_sub_order(order, items, vendor)
    sub_orders.append(sub_order)
  return sub_orders
```

**2. Predictive Consolidation Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Decomposed sub-orders, real-time delivery channel data (availability, estimated times, costs), historical order data, geographical data (distance, traffic), and *predicted* future order volume.
*   **Function:** Determine the *optimal* grouping of sub-orders for delivery.  This isn't just about grouping orders going to the same address. It considers:
    *   **Delivery Channel Capacity:**  Which channels have available resources?
    *   **Preparation Time Synchronization:**  Can the preparation times of the sub-orders be aligned?  (e.g., pizza takes 20 minutes, salad takes 10.  Combine and slightly delay salad prep).
    *   **Route Optimization:**  Minimizing overall travel distance across all deliveries.
    *   **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjusting delivery fees based on consolidation potential. (Incentivize customers to order items that can be consolidated).
*   **Output:** A consolidated delivery plan assigning sub-orders to specific delivery channels and defining a prioritized delivery sequence.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function consolidate_sub_orders(sub_orders, delivery_channels, historical_data):
  best_plan = null
  lowest_cost = infinity

  for each possible combination of sub_order assignments to delivery_channels:
    cost = calculate_total_delivery_cost(combination, delivery_channels)
    if cost < lowest_cost:
      lowest_cost = cost
      best_plan = combination

  return best_plan
```

**3.  Dynamic Queue Adjustment:**

*   **Function:** The aggregated order queue is *not* simply a flat list.  It becomes a hierarchical structure reflecting the consolidated delivery plan.  Orders are grouped by assigned delivery channel and prioritized based on predicted delivery time.
*   **Implementation:** A tree-like data structure could be used.  Root nodes represent delivery channels; child nodes represent individual orders/sub-orders within that channel, sorted by priority.

**4.  Real-Time Optimization Loop:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitor delivery channel status, order preparation times, and traffic conditions.  Re-evaluate the consolidated delivery plan and make adjustments as needed.  This requires a robust event-driven architecture.
*   **Frequency:** Updates should occur at least every minute, and ideally in near real-time.

**5.  Merchant-Facing Interface:**

*   **Function:**  Provide merchants with visibility into the dynamic order splitting and consolidation process.  Allow them to set preferences (e.g., prioritize certain items or vendors).  Offer tools to manage preparation times and synchronize workflows.
