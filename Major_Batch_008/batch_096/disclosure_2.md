## Adaptive Iconography Based on User Emotional State

**Concept:** A display screen interface where icons dynamically morph and change appearance based on detected user emotional state, enhancing intuitive interaction and providing subtle feedback.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Real-time emotional state data derived from multimodal sensors (facial expression analysis via camera, voice tone analysis via microphone, physiological data via wearable - heart rate variability, skin conductance). Data processed via an onboard AI emotion recognition module. Output: a normalized "Emotional State Vector" (ESV).  ESV dimensions: valence (positive/negative), arousal (high/low), dominance (controlled/submissive).
*   **Icon Library:**  A base set of standard icons (e.g., messaging, calendar, settings).  Each icon will have multiple pre-designed "emotional variants" â€“ subtly altered visuals reflecting different ESV states.  Variants will modify shape, color, texture, and animation style.  (e.g., a calendar icon might become more vibrant and "open" with high valence/arousal, or become smaller/muted with low valence/arousal).
*   **Mapping Algorithm:** An algorithm maps the ESV to icon variant selection.  This mapping will *not* be direct 1:1.  Instead, it will use a weighted combination of ESV dimensions to influence icon transformation. 
    *   **Pseudocode:**
        ```
        function select_icon_variant(icon_id, emotional_state_vector) {
          valence = emotional_state_vector.valence;
          arousal = emotional_state_vector.arousal;
          dominance = emotional_state_vector.dominance;

          //Weighting factors (tunable)
          valence_weight = 0.6;
          arousal_weight = 0.3;
          dominance_weight = 0.1;

          //Calculate weighted emotional score
          emotional_score = (valence * valence_weight) + (arousal * arousal_weight) + (dominance * dominance_weight);

          //Determine variant index (based on score, mapped to a range of variant indices)
          variant_index = map(emotional_score, -1, 1, 0, num_variants[icon_id] - 1);

          return variants[icon_id][variant_index];
        }
        ```
*   **Animation & Transition:** Smooth animations will transition between icon variants, providing visual feedback and reducing jarring changes.  Animation duration and style are also influenced by the ESV (faster transitions with higher arousal, slower/more subtle transitions with lower arousal).
*   **Customization:** Users can adjust the sensitivity of the emotional state detection and the intensity of the icon transformations.  They can also create custom mappings between emotional states and icon behaviors.
*   **Hardware:** Standard display screen with integrated camera, microphone, and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity for wearable sensor data. Onboard processing unit for AI emotion recognition and icon transformation.
* **Expansion:** A "mood palette" which allows the user to select overall mood settings, and the system will adapt the iconography to that pre-defined state. This could allow for a calming 'night mode' or a more energized 'work mode'.
