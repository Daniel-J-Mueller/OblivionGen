## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping & Personalized Beamforming

**Concept:** Utilizing microphone array data, not simply for failure detection, but to dynamically create and refine an acoustic map of the user’s environment *and* personalize beamforming based on identified sound reflection patterns unique to the user and their typical spaces.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing multi-microphone array (as present in the referenced patent)
*   Dedicated low-power DSP or edge TPU for real-time acoustic map generation and beamforming calculations.
*   Non-volatile memory (e.g. flash) for storing user-specific acoustic maps and beamforming profiles (minimum 1MB).

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:**
    *   Utilizes a probabilistic approach (e.g., Kalman filtering, particle filtering) to model sound reflections within the environment.
    *   Input: Raw audio data from the microphone array.
    *   Process:
        1.  Identifies early reflections (within 50-100ms) of direct sound sources.
        2.  Estimates the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of both direct and reflected sounds.
        3.  Maps the spatial distribution of reflection points (walls, furniture, etc.).
        4.  Updates the acoustic map based on continuous audio input.
    *   Output: 3D acoustic map representation of the environment.

*   **Personalized Beamforming Module:**
    *   Input: 3D acoustic map, target sound source (e.g., user’s voice), user profile (optional).
    *   Process:
        1.  Analyzes the acoustic map to identify dominant reflection paths.
        2.  Calculates beamforming coefficients that *maximize* signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the target sound source, taking into account reflection characteristics.
        3.  Implements adaptive beamforming – continuously adjusts coefficients based on real-time audio feedback.
        4.  Includes a ‘reflection cancellation’ component – attempts to nullify the impact of strong, detrimental reflections.
    *   Output: Optimized beamforming weights for each microphone in the array.

*   **User Profile Management:**
    *   Allows users to create profiles.
    *   Stores user-specific acoustic map data (e.g., frequently used rooms).
    *   Adapts beamforming profiles based on user habits (e.g., preferred speaking volume, typical locations).
    *   May incorporate contextual information (e.g., time of day, activity) to further refine beamforming.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  The device continuously captures audio data using the microphone array.
2.  The Acoustic Mapping Engine generates and updates the 3D acoustic map.
3.  The Personalized Beamforming Module utilizes the map to calculate optimal beamforming coefficients.
4.  Adaptive beamforming is applied to the audio signal, maximizing SNR and minimizing interference.
5.  User-specific profiles are utilized to further refine beamforming based on learned habits and contextual information.
6.  System continually adapts and refines both acoustic map and beamforming configuration in real time.

**4. Pseudocode (Beamforming Coefficient Calculation):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION calculateBeamformingCoefficients(acousticMap, targetSoundSource, microphoneArrayGeometry):
  // 1. Identify reflection paths from targetSoundSource to each microphone
  reflectionPaths = findReflectionPaths(acousticMap, targetSoundSource, microphoneArrayGeometry)

  // 2. Calculate time delays for direct and reflected signals
  delays = calculateSignalDelays(reflectionPaths, microphonePositions)

  // 3. Calculate phase shifts based on delays and frequency
  phaseShifts = calculatePhaseShifts(delays, frequency)

  // 4. Calculate beamforming weights based on phase shifts and desired beam pattern
  weights = calculateWeights(phaseShifts, beamPattern)

  // 5. Normalize weights to ensure signal integrity
  normalizedWeights = normalizeWeights(weights)

  RETURN normalizedWeights
```

**5. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Integration with room mapping technologies:** Utilize data from visual sensors (cameras) to enhance acoustic map accuracy.
*   **Multi-user support:** Identify and track multiple sound sources within the environment, personalizing beamforming for each user.
*   **Noise cancellation:** Incorporate advanced noise cancellation algorithms to further improve audio quality.
*   **Machine learning:** Train a machine learning model to predict optimal beamforming coefficients based on environmental characteristics and user behavior.
