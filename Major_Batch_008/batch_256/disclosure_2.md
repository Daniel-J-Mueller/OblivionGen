**Adaptive Announcement Prioritization & Multi-Modal Feedback System**

**Concept:** Expanding on the idea of targeted announcements, this system adds a layer of *dynamic* prioritization based on user context *and* provides multi-modal feedback mechanisms – not just audio, but haptic and visual cues – to ensure announcements are effectively received and acknowledged.

**Specs:**

*   **Contextual Awareness Module:**
    *   Input: Device location (GPS, Bluetooth beacons, WiFi triangulation), accelerometer data (activity recognition – walking, driving, stationary), calendar data (meetings, appointments), active application data (e.g., currently in a video conference), biometric data (heart rate variability via wearable, indicating stress levels).
    *   Processing: A weighted algorithm assigns a “receptivity score” to each user based on the combined contextual data.  Higher scores indicate the user is more likely to be receptive to an announcement.  The algorithm is user-trainable – users can manually adjust weights or provide feedback ("I was busy then, don't interrupt me during meetings").
*   **Announcement Queue & Prioritization:**
    *   All announcements are placed in a queue. Each announcement is assigned an initial priority level (critical, high, normal, low) by the originating system.
    *   The contextual awareness module modifies this priority based on the receptivity scores of the intended recipients.  A critical announcement to a user with a low receptivity score might be temporarily downgraded to high or normal.
*   **Multi-Modal Output System:**
    *   Audio: Standard audio output, volume adjusted based on ambient noise levels and user preferences.
    *   Haptic:  Vibrations on wearable devices (smartwatches, phones) or localized haptic feedback on devices (e.g., a gentle pulse on the phone’s back). Vibration patterns differentiate announcement priority.
    *   Visual:
        *   Ambient Lighting: Smart lights change color or intensity to indicate an announcement.
        *   Screen Overlay:  Subtle visual cues on device screens (e.g., a border color change, a small icon) that don’t disrupt current activities.
        *   Augmented Reality (AR) Prompts:  If the user is wearing AR glasses/headset, announcements are displayed as floating notifications in their field of view.
*   **Acknowledgement System:**
    *   Automatic Acknowledgement: If the user interacts with the device (e.g., touches the screen, presses a button) shortly after the announcement, it’s automatically acknowledged.
    *   Voice Command Acknowledgement: Users can acknowledge announcements with a simple voice command ("Okay," "Got it").
    *   Gesture Acknowledgement: Users can acknowledge announcements with a predefined gesture (e.g., a wrist flick) detected by the device.
*   **Escalation Protocol:**
    *   If an announcement is not acknowledged within a predetermined time, the system escalates the output. This might involve increasing the volume, changing the vibration pattern, or displaying a more prominent visual cue.
    *   Critical announcements have a configurable escalation path (e.g., alert a designated contact if the announcement is ignored).
*   **Pseudocode (Announcement Processing):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessAnnouncement(announcement, recipientList)
  FOR EACH recipient IN recipientList
    receptivityScore = GetReceptivityScore(recipient)
    adjustedPriority = AdjustPriority(announcement.priority, receptivityScore)
    outputMode = DetermineOutputMode(adjustedPriority, recipient.preferences)
    SendAnnouncement(announcement, recipient, outputMode)
    acknowledgement = WaitForAcknowledgement(recipient)
    IF acknowledgement == FALSE THEN
      EscalateAnnouncement(announcement, recipient)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION GetReceptivityScore(recipient)
  //Collect data: location, activity, calendar, biometrics
  //Apply weighted algorithm
  RETURN receptivityScore
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Devices with multi-modal output capabilities (speakers, vibration motors, displays, ambient lighting support). Wearable devices for biometric data collection and haptic feedback.  AR/VR headsets (optional).
*   **Software Requirements:** Machine learning algorithms for receptivity score calculation and priority adjustment. Real-time communication protocols for sending announcements.  User interface for configuring preferences and providing feedback.
