**Dynamic Shipment Prioritization & Predictive Reassignment with Multi-Attribute Scoring**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A real-time shipment scoring engine integrated into the existing materials handling system.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Shipment attributes: Destination, carrier, service level (e.g., next-day, standard), declared value, special handling requirements (fragile, temperature-controlled).
    *   Inventory levels: Real-time visibility of all items in inventory and storage.
    *   Storage Area Constraints: Capacity, accessibility, and physical characteristics (temperature, humidity).
    *   Carrier Performance Data: Historical on-time delivery rates, damage claims, and cost per shipment.
    *   External Factors: Weather conditions, traffic patterns, and geopolitical events.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** A weighted scoring model that combines shipment attributes, inventory levels, storage constraints, carrier performance, and external factors. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on real-time data and machine learning algorithms.
*   **Predictive Reassignment Engine:** This engine uses the shipment scores to proactively identify potential reassignment opportunities. It predicts which shipments are most likely to be delayed or impacted by unforeseen events.
*   **Constraint Management Module:** Integrates the existing constraints (priority levels, shipping deadlines, storage durations) from the provided patent.
*   **User Interface:** A dashboard displaying real-time shipment scores, predicted delays, and recommended reassignment actions.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Data Collection:** The system collects data from various sources (warehouse management system, transportation management system, weather feeds, etc.).
2.  **Score Calculation:** The scoring algorithm calculates a score for each shipment based on its attributes and current conditions.
3.  **Prediction & Optimization:** The predictive reassignment engine analyzes the shipment scores and identifies potential delays or disruptions. It then optimizes reassignment strategies to minimize overall impact.
4.  **Reassignment Recommendation:** The system generates a recommendation to reassign units from lower-priority shipments to higher-priority shipments or to shipments with critical deadlines. The recommendation includes a cost-benefit analysis and potential risks.
5.  **Automated Execution:** With operator approval, the system automatically executes the reassignment, updating shipment models and storage area models.
6.  **Continuous Learning:** The system continuously learns from historical data and adjusts the scoring algorithm and reassignment strategies to improve accuracy and efficiency.

**Pseudocode (Core Reassignment Logic):**

```
FUNCTION ReassignUnits(ShipmentList, StorageAreaModel)

  FOR EACH shipment IN ShipmentList:
    shipment.score = CalculateShipmentScore(shipment)

  SORT ShipmentList BY shipment.score DESCENDING // Prioritize high-scoring shipments

  FOR EACH shipment IN ShipmentList:
    IF shipment.score > Threshold AND shipment.status = "Incomplete":
      // Find units available for reassignment
      availableUnits = FindAvailableUnits(StorageAreaModel, shipment.requiredItems)
      
      IF availableUnits.length > 0:
        // Iterate through lower-priority shipments
        FOR EACH lowerPriorityShipment IN GetLowerPriorityShipments():
          // Find units in lower-priority shipment that match required items
          unitsToReassign = FindUnitsToReassign(lowerPriorityShipment, shipment.requiredItems)

          IF unitsToReassign.length > 0:
            //Check Constraints (Prioritize, Deadline, Storage Duration) - Existing Constraint Logic From Patent
            IF CheckConstraints(unitsToReassign, lowerPriorityShipment, shipment):

              //Reassign Units
              ReassignUnitsFromShipment(unitsToReassign, lowerPriorityShipment, shipment)

              //Update Shipment and Storage Models
              UpdateModels(shipment, lowerPriorityShipment, unitsToReassign)

              //Log Reassignment
              LogReassignment(shipment, lowerPriorityShipment, unitsToReassign)

              BREAK //Move to next high-priority shipment
    END FOR
  END FUNCTION
