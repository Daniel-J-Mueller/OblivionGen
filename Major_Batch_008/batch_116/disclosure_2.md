## Card Holder - Integrated Biometric Lock & Modular Design

**Concept:** A card holder featuring a biometric lock (fingerprint scanner) integrated into the closure mechanism, combined with a modular system allowing for interchangeable "card modules" tailored to specific needs (e.g., credit cards, business cards, ID cards, transit passes).

**Specifications:**

*   **Form Factor:** Slim profile, similar dimensions to a standard cardholder (85mm x 55mm x 8mm when closed). Material: High-grade polycarbonate or aluminum alloy.

*   **Closure Mechanism:** A sliding cover incorporating a capacitive fingerprint scanner. Scanner area: 15mm x 10mm. Resolution: 500 DPI. Storage: Secure enclave for storing one user's biometric data (max 3 fingerprints).  Activation: Sliding cover unlocks only upon successful fingerprint verification.  Fallback: A 4-digit PIN code input via touch-sensitive buttons on the side as an alternative access method.

*   **Modular Card Modules:**
    *   **Dimensions:** Standard card size (85.60 mm Ã— 53.98 mm).
    *   **Material:**  ABS plastic with varying internal configurations.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Credit Card Module:** Holds up to 6 standard credit/debit cards.
        *   **Business Card Module:** Designed for vertical storage of up to 20 business cards.  Includes a small 'reveal' mechanism to present the top card.
        *   **ID/Transit Module:** Holds one ID card or transit pass.  Can be RFID-blocking when closed.
        *   **Custom Module:** Blank module for users to configure their own storage solution.
    *   **Connection:** Modules attach to the main body via a magnetic rail system. The rail will be recessed into the main body.

*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-polymer battery (100mAh). Charging via USB-C port (located on the side). Battery life: 30 lock/unlock cycles per charge.  Low-battery indicator (LED on the side).

*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.0 for optional smartphone integration.  Functionality:
    *   Remote locking/unlocking.
    *   Battery level monitoring.
    *   Access log (records time/date of unlocks).
    *   Lost card mode (remotely disables biometric access).

*   **Security:**
    *   AES-256 encryption for biometric data and Bluetooth communication.
    *   Tamper detection: Internal accelerometer detects forced opening attempts and triggers an audible alarm.

**Pseudocode (Module Attachment/Detection):**

```
FUNCTION detectModule()
    SCAN for magnetic signature on rail
    IF signature detected:
        IDENTIFY module type based on signature
        DISPLAY module type on integrated OLED screen (optional)
    ELSE:
        DISPLAY "No module detected"
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION attachModule()
    DETECT module approaching rail
    ALIGN module with rail
    ENGAGE magnetic lock
    VERIFY secure attachment
    IF attachment failed:
        DISPLAY error message
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION detachModule()
    INITIATE release mechanism (small button on side)
    DISENGAGE magnetic lock
    ALLOW user to remove module
ENDFUNCTION
```
