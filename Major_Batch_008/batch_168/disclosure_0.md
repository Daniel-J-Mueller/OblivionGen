## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction for Personalized Echo Cancellation

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:**

Instead of solely focusing on loudspeaker *position*, reconstruct the entire acoustic scene surrounding the voice-controlled device and user. This allows for dynamic, highly personalized echo cancellation that accounts for all sound sources – not just the loudspeaker.

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Minimum of 8, optimally 16+ high-quality microphones distributed around the device perimeter, and potentially integrated into wearable accessories (earbuds, glasses) for extended scene capture.
*   **High-Performance Processor:** Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of real-time acoustic scene analysis and spatial audio processing.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Integrated IMU to track device and user head movement for accurate spatial audio mapping.
*   **Optional: Depth Sensor:** Time-of-Flight (ToF) or structured light sensor for improved 3D scene understanding and object detection.

**III. Software Components:**

1.  **Acoustic Scene Analyzer:**
    *   **Input:** Raw audio data from the microphone array.
    *   **Process:** Utilize advanced signal processing techniques (beamforming, sound event detection, source localization) and machine learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers) to:
        *   Identify and classify all sound sources in the environment (speech, music, ambient noise, specific object sounds).
        *   Estimate the 3D position and trajectory of each sound source.
        *   Create a dynamic acoustic map of the surrounding space.
    *   **Output:**  A probabilistic representation of the acoustic scene, including source positions, classifications, and estimated sound pressure levels.

2.  **Personalized Echo Cancellation Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Acoustic scene map from the Acoustic Scene Analyzer, response audio data, microphone audio data.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Identify the loudspeaker as a sound source within the acoustic scene.
        *   Model the acoustic propagation path between the loudspeaker and each microphone, considering reflections, diffraction, and absorption.
        *   Adaptively filter the incoming microphone signal to remove the echo component based on the modeled propagation path, *while preserving other desired sounds* (e.g., user speech, other nearby conversations).
        *   Prioritize echo cancellation based on user preferences and context (e.g., aggressive cancellation during voice commands, more subtle cancellation during music playback).

3.  **User Profile & Learning Module:**
    *   **Input:** User voice commands, acoustic scene data, user feedback (explicit ratings or implicit behavioral cues).
    *   **Process:**
        *   Build a personalized acoustic profile for each user, capturing their typical listening environment, preferred audio settings, and voice characteristics.
        *   Continuously learn and adapt the echo cancellation model based on user feedback and behavioral data.
        *   Implement a ‘comfort level’ setting allowing users to tune the aggressiveness of echo cancellation.

**IV. Pseudocode - Echo Cancellation Core**

```pseudocode
function perform_echo_cancellation(mic_data, response_data, acoustic_scene) {
    // 1. Extract loudspeaker position and characteristics from acoustic_scene
    loudspeaker_position = acoustic_scene.get_loudspeaker_position()
    loudspeaker_characteristics = acoustic_scene.get_loudspeaker_characteristics()

    // 2. Model acoustic propagation path between loudspeaker and microphones
    propagation_path = model_propagation_path(loudspeaker_position, microphones, acoustic_scene)

    // 3. Estimate the echo component in the microphone signal
    estimated_echo = predict_echo(response_data, propagation_path)

    // 4. Subtract the estimated echo from the microphone signal
    cleaned_mic_data = mic_data - estimated_echo

    // 5. Apply adaptive filtering and noise reduction (optional)
    cleaned_mic_data = adaptive_filter(cleaned_mic_data, user_preferences)

    return cleaned_mic_data
}
```

**V. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Acoustic ‘Painting’:** Allow users to ‘paint’ specific areas of the acoustic scene to prioritize or exclude from echo cancellation.
*   **Virtual Acoustic Zones:** Create virtual zones within the acoustic scene to define different echo cancellation settings.
*   **Collaboration Mode:** Seamlessly integrate with other voice-controlled devices and smart home systems to create a unified acoustic experience.
*   **Predictive Echo Cancellation:** Utilize machine learning to predict future echo patterns and proactively cancel them.
