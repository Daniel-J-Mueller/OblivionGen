## Adaptive Query Decomposition & Parallel Execution

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of testing different command sequences. Instead of *just* comparing full sequences, decompose queries into granular sub-queries and dynamically parallelize their execution based on real-time database load and resource availability. This creates a self-optimizing query engine that isn't limited by pre-defined execution plans.

**Specifications:**

**1. Query Decomposition Module:**

*   **Input:** SQL query string.
*   **Process:**
    *   Parse the SQL query into a dependency graph of sub-queries (e.g., joins, filters, aggregations).  Utilize a recursive descent parser to handle complex queries.
    *   Identify independent sub-queries that can be executed in parallel.  Maintain dependency information between sub-queries.
    *   Generate multiple possible execution paths for each sub-query (e.g., different index usage, join orders).
*   **Output:**  Directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the query decomposition and potential execution paths.  Each node in the DAG represents a sub-query, and edges represent dependencies.  Each node also contains a list of possible execution strategies.

**2. Resource Monitor & Load Balancer:**

*   **Input:** Real-time database server metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, active connections).
*   **Process:**
    *   Continuously monitor database server resource utilization.
    *   Dynamically adjust the number of parallel sub-queries based on available resources.  Implement a sliding window average to smooth out transient spikes.
    *   Prioritize sub-queries based on their estimated cost and impact on the overall query result.
*   **Output:**  A dynamic "parallelism threshold" – the maximum number of sub-queries that can be executed concurrently.

**3. Adaptive Execution Engine:**

*   **Input:**  DAG from the Query Decomposition Module, Parallelism Threshold from the Resource Monitor, Database Connection.
*   **Process:**
    *   Iteratively select sub-queries for execution, respecting the Parallelism Threshold and dependency constraints.
    *   For each sub-query, select the execution strategy based on a cost-based estimator (similar to traditional query optimizers), but dynamically adjusted based on recent performance data.  Maintain a cache of recent execution times for different strategies.
    *   Execute sub-queries in parallel using a thread pool.
    *   Collect results from completed sub-queries and assemble the final result set.
*   **Output:**  Final result set.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Execution Engine):**

```
function executeQuery(query):
  dag = decomposeQuery(query)
  parallelismThreshold = getResourceMonitor().getParallelismThreshold()
  activeSubqueries = []
  completedSubqueries = []

  while (activeSubqueries.size() < parallelismThreshold and dag.hasUnvisitedNodes()):
    node = dag.getReadyNode() // Node with all dependencies satisfied
    if node != null:
      strategy = node.selectBestStrategy()
      subqueryTask = createTask(node, strategy)
      activeSubqueries.add(subqueryTask)
      subqueryTask.execute()

  while (activeSubqueries.size() > 0):
    task = activeSubqueries.remove(0)
    if task.isCompleted():
      completedSubqueries.add(task)
    else:
      activeSubqueries.add(task) // Re-add to wait

  result = assembleResults(completedSubqueries)
  return result
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **DAG Node:**  Contains sub-query SQL, list of potential execution strategies, dependency list, completion status.
*   **Execution Strategy:**  Contains execution plan (index usage, join order, etc.), estimated cost, recent execution time.
*   **SubqueryTask:** Represents a single subquery to be executed; tracks status and result.

**Novelty:**  This differs from simply testing entire command sequences by operating at a *much* finer granularity. It’s a proactive, self-tuning system that adapts to changing database conditions *during* query execution.  The dynamic parallelism and real-time strategy selection provide a significant performance advantage in high-load environments. It’s effectively a query engine that rewrites itself on the fly.
