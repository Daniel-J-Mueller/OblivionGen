## Dynamic Stream Complexity Scaling with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the hybrid stream approach by incorporating predictive analysis of network conditions *and* client device resource availability (GPU, CPU, memory) to dynamically scale the complexity of both client and content provider streams *before* quality degradation occurs. This isn’t just about switching streams, but intelligently adjusting the fidelity *within* each stream.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Client Node:**
    *   Resource Monitor: Continuously assesses CPU, GPU, and memory utilization.
    *   Network Predictor: Employs machine learning to forecast network bandwidth and latency based on historical data and real-time monitoring.  Model should incorporate time-of-day, location (derived from IP/GPS), and known network congestion patterns.
    *   Complexity Request Generator:  Based on Resource Monitor and Network Predictor data, generates requests for adjusted stream complexity levels.  Complexity levels are defined as a tiered system (Low, Medium, High) for both client and provider streams.
    *   Hybrid Stream Composer:  Combines client and provider stream data, prioritizing features based on complexity levels.
*   **Content Provider Node:**
    *   Complexity Management Module: Receives complexity requests from clients.  Maintains multiple versions of game assets at varying fidelity levels (LoD – Level of Detail).
    *   Stream Generator: Dynamically generates content provider streams based on requested complexity level and current game state.
    *   State Synchronization Module:  As in the base patent, exchanges state information with the client, but also includes complexity level metadata.

**II. Stream Complexity Levels:**

| Level   | Client Stream                               | Provider Stream                            | Bandwidth (estimated) | GPU Load (estimated) |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------- |
| Low     | Basic Geometry, Low-Resolution Textures    | Static Backgrounds, Minimal VFX           | 1 Mbps                | Low                  |
| Medium  | Medium Geometry, Medium-Resolution Textures | Dynamic Backgrounds, Moderate VFX         | 3 Mbps                | Medium               |
| High    | High Geometry, High-Resolution Textures     | Detailed Backgrounds, Complex VFX        | 8 Mbps                | High                 |

**III.  Algorithmic Pseudocode (Client Node - Complexity Request Generator):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateComplexityRequest():
    // Get current resource utilization
    cpuLoad = GetCPUUtilization()
    gpuLoad = GetGPUUtilization()
    memoryUsage = GetMemoryUsage()

    // Get predicted network bandwidth and latency
    predictedBandwidth = PredictNetworkBandwidth()
    predictedLatency = PredictNetworkLatency()

    // Define thresholds (tunable parameters)
    cpuThresholdHigh = 0.8
    gpuThresholdHigh = 0.7
    memoryThresholdHigh = 0.9
    bandwidthThresholdLow = 2 Mbps
    latencyThresholdHigh = 100ms

    // Determine base complexity level
    IF predictedBandwidth < bandwidthThresholdLow OR predictedLatency > latencyThresholdHigh THEN
        complexityLevel = "Low"
    ELSE
        complexityLevel = "Medium"

    // Adjust based on client resources
    IF cpuLoad > cpuThresholdHigh OR gpuLoad > gpuThresholdHigh OR memoryUsage > memoryThresholdHigh THEN
        complexityLevel = "Low" // Force lower complexity

    // Transmit request to content provider
    SendComplexityRequest(complexityLevel)
END FUNCTION
```

**IV. Stream Prioritization Logic (Hybrid Stream Composer):**

*   **Critical Features:**  Gameplay-essential elements (player character, immediate threats) always rendered at highest available fidelity (prioritizing provider stream for complex details).
*   **Secondary Features:**  Environmental details, background elements dynamically scaled based on complexity levels.
*   **Adaptive LoD:**  Object detail dynamically adjusted based on distance and viewing angle.

**V.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Per-Object Complexity:** Enable individual object complexity levels, allowing for fine-grained control over resource allocation.
*   **Predictive LoD Caching:** Cache lower-detail models to reduce loading times and improve performance during complexity transitions.
*   **AI-Driven Optimization:** Employ reinforcement learning to optimize complexity levels based on user behavior and network conditions.
