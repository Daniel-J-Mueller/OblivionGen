## Adaptive Video Fragment Requesting & Predictive Analysis

**Concept:** Expanding on the video fragment requesting mechanism, implement a system that *predicts* potentially relevant fragments *before* they are fully available, initiating analysis on partial data and refining it as more data arrives. This moves beyond reactive analysis to a proactive, near-real-time system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Module:** Predictive Fragment Handler (PFH) - operates within the Computer Vision Service.
*   **Data Input:**  Video stream metadata (frame rate, resolution, encoding), initial request parameters (unique label, target label), historical analysis data (if available – see ‘Learning & Adaptation’ below).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Temporal Segmentation:** Divide the incoming video stream into variable-length segments based on motion detection and scene changes.  Initial segment length dynamically adjusted based on frame rate & estimated event density.
    *   **Relevance Scoring:**  Assign a relevance score to each segment *before* it is fully transmitted, based on:
        *   **Motion Vectors:**  High motion in areas likely to contain the target label increases the score.
        *   **Color Histograms:**  If the target label has a known dominant color, segments with similar color distributions receive a higher score.
        *   **Audio Analysis:**  If the target label is associated with specific sounds (e.g., a dog barking), audio peaks trigger score increases.
        *   **Historical Data:** If the system has analyzed similar video streams before, it can predict the likelihood of the target label appearing in specific segments based on past patterns.
    *   **Prioritized Requesting:** The PFH requests video fragments from the Stream Processing Service based on relevance scores. Higher-scoring segments are prioritized, allowing the Computer Vision Service to begin analysis on the most promising data first.
    *   **Adaptive Fragment Size:** Fragment size isn’t fixed.  Based on motion complexity and relevance score, the PFH can request smaller fragments for rapidly changing scenes or larger fragments for static scenes.
*   **Learning & Adaptation:**
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** A reinforcement learning agent monitors the accuracy of label detection and adjusts the relevance scoring algorithm over time.  Incorrect detections penalize the agent, while correct detections reward it.
    *   **Contextual Memory:**  The system stores a limited history of analyzed video segments, allowing it to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of the target label appearing in subsequent segments.
*   **API Extensions:**
    *   `requestPredictiveFragment(streamID, label, quality)`:  Initiates predictive fragment requesting. `quality` parameter controls the trade-off between responsiveness and accuracy.
    *   `setLearningRate(rate)`:  Adjusts the learning rate of the reinforcement learning agent.
*   **Pseudocode (PFH core logic):**

```pseudocode
function processFrame(frame, streamID, label):
  calculateMotionVectors(frame)
  calculateColorHistogram(frame)
  calculateAudioFeatures(frame)

  relevanceScore = calculateRelevanceScore(motionVectors, colorHistogram, audioFeatures, historicalData)

  if relevanceScore > threshold:
    requestFragment(streamID, frameTimestamp, fragmentDuration, quality)
    startAnalysis(fragment)
  else:
    discardFrame()
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased computational resources for the Computer Vision Service to handle parallel analysis of multiple fragments.
*   High-bandwidth network connection between the Stream Processing Service and the Computer Vision Service.
