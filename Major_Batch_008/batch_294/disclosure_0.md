## Dynamic Contextual Highlighting & 'Flow State' Reading

**Concept:** Extend the search/proximity matching from the patent to dynamically alter display characteristics (highlighting, font size, background color) *during* reading based on real-time contextual relevance to user-defined keywords/concepts – fostering a 'flow state' and improving information absorption.

**Specs:**

1.  **User Profile & Keyword/Concept Input:**
    *   Application allows users to define “focus areas” – keywords, phrases, or abstract concepts (using NLP to interpret conceptual meaning).
    *   User can assign weighting/priority to each focus area.
    *   Profiles can be saved and loaded.

2.  **Real-time Text Analysis & Scoring:**
    *   As the user reads, the system continuously analyzes the displayed text.
    *   For each sentence/paragraph, a “relevance score” is calculated based on the presence and weighting of focus area keywords/concepts.  NLP will be utilized for stemming, synonym detection, and contextual understanding.
    *   Score is not simply keyword count, but a weighted sum accounting for:
        *   Keyword frequency.
        *   Keyword proximity (distance between keywords).
        *   Conceptual similarity (using word embeddings/semantic analysis).
        *   Sentence/paragraph structure (keywords in topic sentences receive higher weight).

3.  **Dynamic Display Adaptation:**
    *   Display characteristics (highlighting color, intensity, background color, font size/weight) are dynamically adjusted based on the relevance score:
        *   Low score: Minimal highlighting/subtle background.
        *   Medium score:  Moderate highlighting, slightly altered background.
        *   High score:  Bold highlighting, distinct background color, potentially increased font size/weight.
    *   Adaptation should be *gradual* and *subtle* to avoid distraction. Use a smoothing algorithm (e.g., exponential moving average) to prevent abrupt changes.
    *   User adjustable sensitivity settings to control the responsiveness of the adaptation.

4.  **'Flow State' Calibration:**
    *   System monitors user reading pace (words/minute) and comprehension (through optional embedded quizzes).
    *   Adjusts the sensitivity of the display adaptation based on user performance and pace.  If reading pace slows or comprehension decreases, reduce the intensity of highlighting to prevent overstimulation.

5.  **'Concept Graph' Visualization (Optional):**
    *   System builds a dynamic 'concept graph' based on the identified keywords/concepts and their relationships within the text.
    *   User can access a visual representation of this graph to see how different concepts are connected, providing a higher-level overview of the content.

**Pseudocode (Core Scoring Logic):**

```
function calculate_relevance_score(sentence, focus_areas):
  score = 0
  for focus_area in focus_areas:
    keywords = focus_area.keywords
    keyword_count = 0
    proximity_sum = 0
    for keyword in keywords:
      keyword_count += count_occurrences(keyword, sentence)
      # Calculate average proximity to other keywords
      proximity_sum += calculate_average_proximity(keyword, sentence, keywords)

    score += (keyword_count * focus_area.weight) + (proximity_sum * focus_area.weight)
  return score
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Handheld electronic reading device with sufficient processing power and memory.
*   Natural Language Processing (NLP) library for keyword extraction, semantic analysis, and proximity calculations.
*   User interface for defining focus areas and adjusting sensitivity settings.
*   Smooth rendering engine for dynamic display adaptation.
