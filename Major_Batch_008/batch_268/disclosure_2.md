**Adaptive DRX Cycle Granularity Based on User Behavior Prediction**

**Specification:**

**1. Introduction**

This specification details a system for dynamically adjusting the granularity of Discontinuous Reception (DRX) cycles – going beyond simple rate selection – based on predicted user behavior. The existing patent focuses on signal condition influencing *rates*. This expands on that by predicting *when* a device will likely be active or inactive, and altering DRX cycle *length* accordingly, even within a single DRX cycle.

**2. System Components**

*   **Behavioral Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Markov Model) trained on user application usage patterns, location data (with user consent), and time-of-day information. This engine outputs a probability distribution indicating the likelihood of user activity (data transmission/reception) over short time intervals (e.g., 500ms – 1s).
*   **DRX Cycle Granularity Controller:** This module receives the activity probability distribution from the Behavioral Prediction Engine. It then dynamically adjusts the DRX cycle length and retransmission timer settings based on this probability.
*   **Real-time Monitoring Module:** Constantly monitors actual user activity (packet arrival/departure) to refine the Behavioral Prediction Engine's accuracy in real time, utilizing reinforcement learning techniques.
*   **Radio Resource Management Integration:** This component ensures that DRX adjustments do not interfere with network-level resource allocation and maintains Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.

**3. Operational Procedure**

1.  **Initial Calibration:** Upon device activation, the Behavioral Prediction Engine begins collecting data on user behavior. A default DRX cycle length is used initially.
2.  **Prediction & Adjustment:** The Behavioral Prediction Engine generates a probability distribution of user activity for the next DRX cycle.
3.  **Granularity Control:**
    *   **High Probability ( >70%):** DRX cycle length is shortened. This prioritizes immediate responsiveness.  The retransmission timer is also shortened. We go to a small cycle, even down to a single slot for rapid wake-up.
    *   **Medium Probability (30% - 70%):** DRX cycle length remains at the default value.
    *   **Low Probability ( <30%):** DRX cycle length is extended.  Multiple DRX cycles are potentially 'collapsed' into a single, longer sleep period.
4.  **Real-Time Learning:** The Real-time Monitoring Module compares predicted activity with actual activity. The difference is used to adjust the Behavioral Prediction Engine’s parameters using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to improve future predictions.
5.  **Network Synchronization:** The DRX adjustments are communicated to the base station (eNodeB) to ensure seamless handover and resource allocation.

**4. Pseudocode**

```
// Variables
current_drx_cycle_length = DEFAULT_DRX_CYCLE_LENGTH
activity_probability = 0.0
predicted_activity_pattern = []
actual_activity_pattern = []
q_table = initialize_q_table()

// Main Loop
while (device_is_on) {
    // Predict Activity
    predicted_activity_pattern = predict_activity(user_history, location, time)
    activity_probability = average(predicted_activity_pattern)

    // Adjust DRX Cycle Length
    if (activity_probability > 0.7) {
        current_drx_cycle_length = MIN_DRX_CYCLE_LENGTH
    } else if (activity_probability < 0.3) {
        current_drx_cycle_length = MAX_DRX_CYCLE_LENGTH
    } else {
        current_drx_cycle_length = DEFAULT_DRX_CYCLE_LENGTH
    }

    // Monitor Activity
    actual_activity_pattern = monitor_activity()

    // Reinforcement Learning Update
    reward = calculate_reward(predicted_activity_pattern, actual_activity_pattern)
    update_q_table(q_table, reward)

    // Apply DRX settings
    set_drx_cycle_length(current_drx_cycle_length)
}

```

**5.  Potential Benefits**

*   **Reduced Power Consumption:** By accurately predicting user inactivity, the device can spend more time in a low-power sleep mode.
*   **Improved Responsiveness:** By shortening the DRX cycle during periods of expected activity, the device can respond to incoming data more quickly.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** A more responsive and energy-efficient device translates to a better overall user experience.
*   **Network Efficiency:** By optimizing DRX cycles, the system can reduce the load on the network.
