## Dynamic Workload Partitioning via Predictive Thread Migration

**Specification:** Implement a system for predictive thread migration based on real-time workload analysis and inter-thread dependencies. The goal is to preemptively move threads between execution units (potentially across multiple GPUs or even servers) *before* bottlenecks occur, maximizing parallel execution efficiency.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Workload Profiler:** Continuously monitors resource utilization (GPU memory, compute units, interconnect bandwidth) for each active thread.  Tracks not just *current* usage but also rate of change – is a thread’s memory footprint growing rapidly? Is compute demand spiking?
2.  **Dependency Graph Builder:** Automatically constructs a directed graph representing inter-thread dependencies.  If thread A needs data processed by thread B, an edge is created from A to B. This graph is updated dynamically as execution progresses.
3.  **Predictive Migration Engine:** Uses a machine learning model (trained offline on a diverse workload) to predict potential bottlenecks based on data from the Workload Profiler and Dependency Graph Builder. The model outputs a “migration score” for each thread.  Higher scores indicate a greater probability of becoming a bottleneck.  Factors considered:
    *   Current resource utilization
    *   Rate of change of resource utilization
    *   Number of dependent threads
    *   Critical path length in the dependency graph
4.  **Resource Manager:**  A system responsible for allocating resources and managing thread placement. The Predictive Migration Engine provides “migration requests” to the Resource Manager.
5.  **Thread Migration Handler:** Implements the actual thread migration process. This requires careful handling of data dependencies and synchronization to avoid race conditions. The handler uses a combination of techniques:
    *   **Data Copy/Transfer:**  Data required by the migrating thread is transferred to the target execution unit.
    *   **State Synchronization:**  Thread state (registers, local memory) is copied or replicated.
    *   **Context Switching:**  The thread is switched to execute on the target unit.
6. **Adaptive Learning:** The predictive model is continually refined based on observed performance. If a predicted migration fails to alleviate a bottleneck, the model is adjusted to improve future predictions.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Migration Engine):**

```
function predict_migrations(workload_profile, dependency_graph):
  migration_candidates = []
  for thread in active_threads:
    migration_score = calculate_migration_score(thread, workload_profile, dependency_graph)
    if migration_score > threshold:
      migration_candidates.append(thread)

  # Sort candidates based on migration score (highest first)
  migration_candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x.migration_score, reverse=True)
  return migration_candidates

function calculate_migration_score(thread, workload_profile, dependency_graph):
  resource_utilization = workload_profile.get_resource_usage(thread)
  rate_of_change = workload_profile.get_rate_of_change(thread)
  num_dependencies = dependency_graph.get_num_dependencies(thread)
  critical_path_length = dependency_graph.get_critical_path_length(thread)

  # Weighted sum (weights can be tuned)
  score = (0.4 * resource_utilization) + (0.3 * rate_of_change) + (0.2 * num_dependencies) + (0.1 * critical_path_length)

  return score
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond static thread assignment. The predictive nature allows preemptive mitigation of bottlenecks, increasing the overall throughput of the system. By dynamically adjusting thread placement based on predicted workload demands, it aims to improve resource utilization and reduce latency. It is also designed to adapt to unpredictable workload patterns.
