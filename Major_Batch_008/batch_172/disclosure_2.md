## Dynamic Anomaly Contextualization via Multi-Metric Relationship Mapping

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on forecasting and anomaly *detection* based on historical data of a single metric. This expands on that by dynamically identifying and leveraging relationships *between* multiple monitored metrics to create a contextualized understanding of "normal" behavior, drastically improving anomaly detection accuracy and reducing false positives. It shifts from predicting a single metric to predicting the *relationship* between metrics.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion Module:**  Capable of ingesting real-time data streams for a configurable set of metrics (server response time, CPU utilization, network latency, transaction rates, error counts, etc.). Metrics are time-stamped and normalized.
*   **Relationship Discovery Engine:**
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Continuously analyzes historical data to identify statistically significant correlations between metrics. Uses techniques like Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation, and mutual information.
    *   **Causal Inference:**  Employes algorithms (e.g., Granger causality, PC algorithm) to attempt to establish causal relationships between metrics, beyond simple correlation.  Not strictly required, but enhances accuracy.
    *   **Dynamic Graph Construction:** Represents metric relationships as a directed graph. Nodes are metrics; edges represent the strength and type (correlation, causality) of the relationship.  Edge weights are dynamically updated based on real-time data.
*   **Relationship Forecasting Module:**
    *   **Vector Autoregression (VAR):**  Uses VAR models to forecast the *relationships* between metrics, rather than individual metrics.  This requires historical data of the relationships themselves (e.g., the correlation coefficient over time).
    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNN):**  A more advanced approach.  Treats the metric relationship graph as a network and uses GNNs to learn complex patterns and predict how relationships will evolve. This allows for modeling non-linear relationships.
*   **Anomaly Scoring Engine:**
    *   **Relationship Deviation:**  Calculates the deviation between the predicted relationships (from the VAR or GNN model) and the observed relationships in real-time.
    *   **Contextual Anomaly Score:**  Combines the relationship deviation with individual metric deviations (using the existing patentâ€™s anomaly detection techniques).  The combined score reflects the severity of the anomaly *in context* of the overall system behavior.
    *   **Adaptive Thresholds:**  Dynamically adjusts anomaly thresholds based on the historical distribution of anomaly scores and the current system load.
*   **Alerting and Remediation Module:**
    *   Generates alerts when the contextual anomaly score exceeds a predefined threshold.
    *   Triggers automated remediation actions (e.g., load balancing, server restart) based on the identified anomaly and its context.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Scoring Engine):**

```
// Inputs:
//   observed_metrics: Vector of current metric values
//   predicted_relationships: Matrix of predicted relationship strengths
//   historical_relationships: Matrix of historical relationship strengths
//   metric_deviations: Vector of individual metric deviations (from existing patent)
//   threshold: Anomaly threshold

function calculate_contextual_anomaly_score(observed_metrics, predicted_relationships, historical_relationships, metric_deviations, threshold):
  // 1. Calculate relationship deviation
  relationship_deviation = sum(abs(predicted_relationships - historical_relationships)) / number_of_relationships

  // 2. Calculate weighted average of metric and relationship deviations
  //    Weights can be adjusted based on the importance of each factor
  metric_weight = 0.6
  relationship_weight = 0.4

  combined_deviation = (metric_weight * average(metric_deviations)) + (relationship_weight * relationship_deviation)

  // 3. Normalize combined deviation
  normalized_deviation = (combined_deviation - min(historical_combined_deviations)) / (max(historical_combined_deviations) - min(historical_combined_deviations))

  // 4. Determine anomaly score
  anomaly_score = normalized_deviation

  // 5. Trigger alert if anomaly score exceeds threshold
  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    generate_alert()

  return anomaly_score
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems typically focus on forecasting and detecting anomalies in individual metrics. This innovation shifts the focus to forecasting and analyzing the *relationships* between metrics, providing a more holistic and accurate view of system health. This allows for the detection of subtle anomalies that might be missed by traditional methods.
