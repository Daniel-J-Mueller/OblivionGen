## Adaptive Sparsity with Momentum-Based Quantization

**Concept:** Extend the selective gradient transmission by introducing adaptive sparsity levels *per parameter* based on a moving average of gradient magnitude, coupled with a momentum-based quantization scheme. This aims to reduce communication overhead even further while potentially accelerating convergence by focusing on the most impactful parameter updates.

**Specifications:**

**1. Parameter-Specific Sparsity Control:**

*   **Moving Average Calculation:** Each parameter maintains a moving average of its recent gradient magnitudes (`MA_Grad[i]`). This average is updated after each gradient computation:
    `MA_Grad[i] = α * |Gradient[i]| + (1 - α) * MA_Grad[i]` where `α` is a smoothing factor (e.g., 0.9).

*   **Sparsity Threshold Calculation:** A global sparsity target (`SparsityTarget`) is defined.  For each parameter, a sparsity threshold (`Threshold[i]`) is calculated:
    `Threshold[i] = Percentile(MA_Grad, SparsityTarget)`
    where `Percentile` returns the value below which `SparsityTarget` percent of the `MA_Grad` values fall. This ensures a consistent overall sparsity level while adapting to parameter-specific importance.

*   **Gradient Masking:**  Before transmission, gradients below their respective thresholds are masked:
    `MaskedGradient[i] = Gradient[i] if Gradient[i] >= Threshold[i] else 0`

**2. Momentum-Based Quantization:**

*   **Quantization Momentum:** Each parameter maintains a "quantization momentum" value (`QM[i]`).
*   **Quantization with Momentum:** Instead of directly quantizing the masked gradient, a weighted average of the masked gradient and the previous quantized value is used:
    `QuantizedGradient[i] = β * MaskedGradient[i] + (1 - β) * QM[i]` where `β` is a momentum factor (e.g., 0.7).
*   **Update Quantization Momentum:** After quantization, the momentum is updated:
    `QM[i] = QuantizedGradient[i]`
*   **Further Quantization:** Apply standard quantization techniques (e.g., 8-bit integer quantization) to `QuantizedGradient[i]`.

**3. System Integration:**

*   **Computing Device:** Each device calculates its gradients, applies the parameter-specific sparsity control, and then performs the momentum-based quantization. The quantized, masked gradients are transmitted.
*   **Synchronization:** Receiving devices apply the received quantized gradients to update their model parameters.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A lightweight communication protocol should be used to transmit the sparse, quantized gradients efficiently. Consider using a compressed sparse row (CSR) or similar format.
*   **Adaptive Learning Rate:** Integrate with an adaptive learning rate scheduler (e.g., Adam) to further optimize convergence.



**Pseudocode (Computing Device):**

```
// Initialization
MA_Grad = array of moving averages (initialized to 0)
QM = array of quantization momentums (initialized to 0)
SparsityTarget = 0.9  // Example: target 90% sparsity

// Per-iteration:
For each parameter i:
    Compute Gradient[i]

    // Update Moving Average
    MA_Grad[i] = α * abs(Gradient[i]) + (1 - α) * MA_Grad[i]

    // Calculate Threshold
    Threshold[i] = Percentile(MA_Grad, SparsityTarget)

    // Apply Sparsity
    If abs(Gradient[i]) < Threshold[i]:
        Gradient[i] = 0

    // Momentum-Based Quantization
    QuantizedGradient[i] = β * Gradient[i] + (1 - β) * QM[i]
    QM[i] = QuantizedGradient[i]

    // Apply Quantization (e.g., 8-bit integer quantization)
    QuantizedGradient[i] = Quantize(QuantizedGradient[i])

Transmit QuantizedGradient[i]
