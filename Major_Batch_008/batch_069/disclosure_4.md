## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Embedding for Latency Prediction

**Concept:** Integrate acoustic scene embedding directly into the latency prediction model. The core idea is that the *environment* the speech is occurring in significantly impacts processing difficulty, and thus latency. A noisy restaurant requires more processing than a quiet room. This system moves beyond purely signal-based difficulty assessments to include contextual awareness.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Acoustic Scene Classifier:**
    *   Input: Raw audio stream (concurrent with ASR input).
    *   Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of labelled acoustic scenes (e.g., “quiet office,” “busy street,” “restaurant,” “car interior”).  Pre-trained models available, fine-tuning essential.
    *   Output: A vector representing the probability distribution across the defined acoustic scene classes. This is the *acoustic scene embedding*.
2.  **Latency Prediction Model:**
    *   Input: 
        *   Acoustic Scene Embedding (from step 1).
        *   Signal-based features (as per original patent - SNR, difficulty estimates).
        *   Current processing rate (frames processed / time elapsed).
        *   Endpoint prediction (estimated remaining audio duration).
    *   Model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – LSTM or GRU preferred.  RNNs excel at temporal data and capturing the relationship between features over time.
    *   Output: Predicted latency for the *next* segment of audio (e.g., next 100ms). This is a rolling prediction.
3.  **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment:**
    *   Input: Predicted latency.
    *   Logic:  Based on the predicted latency, adjust ASR processing parameters (graph pruning, weightings, numerical precision) as described in the source patent.
    *   Adaptive Thresholds: Thresholds for latency adjustment should *also* be learned and adjusted dynamically based on a cost function that balances accuracy with speed.

**Pseudocode (Latency Prediction Model – Core):**

```
function predict_latency(acoustic_embedding, signal_features, processing_rate, endpoint_prediction):
    # Concatenate inputs
    combined_input = concatenate([acoustic_embedding, signal_features, processing_rate, endpoint_prediction])

    # Pass through RNN (LSTM/GRU)
    rnn_output = RNN(combined_input)

    # Fully connected layer to predict latency
    latency_prediction = FC(rnn_output)

    return latency_prediction
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing ASR processing hardware.
*   Dedicated processing unit for acoustic scene classification (GPU preferred for parallel processing).  Could be integrated into existing hardware if resources permit.
*   Sufficient memory to store model weights and intermediate data.

**Training Data:**

*   Large dataset of audio recordings labelled with acoustic scene categories.
*   Corresponding ASR processing data (processing times, parameters used, etc.).
*   Data augmentation techniques (adding noise, changing reverb, etc.) to improve model robustness.

**Novelty:**  The existing patent focuses on signal characteristics and processing rate. This system introduces *contextual awareness* by incorporating acoustic scene embedding, providing a richer feature set for latency prediction.  It moves beyond a purely reactive system to one that anticipates potential processing difficulties based on the environment.  This is *proactive* latency reduction.
