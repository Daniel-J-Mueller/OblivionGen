## Modular Crossbar Lighting & Data System

**Concept:** Expand the crossbar functionality beyond weighing modules to incorporate adjustable, modular lighting *and* high-bandwidth data transfer, creating a dynamic, configurable infrastructure for facilities.

**Specifications:**

**1. Crossbar Core - Enhanced:**

*   **Material:** Aluminum alloy, black anodized.
*   **Dimensions:** Maintains compatibility with existing bracket systems.  Width customizable in 5cm increments (minimum 30cm, maximum 120cm)
*   **Internal Channels:** Three parallel channels running the length of the crossbar.
    *   Channel 1: Power & Weighing Module Data (existing functionality, backward compatible).
    *   Channel 2: High-Bandwidth Data – Fiber optic cabling pre-installed. Connectors: SFP+ at both ends.
    *   Channel 3: Power & Lighting Control – Separate, isolated power supply (24V DC).  DMX control lines embedded.
*   **Engagement Slots:** Modified to accommodate both existing weighing module rails *and* a new ‘L-track’ system (see section 3). Spacing standardized at 2cm intervals.
*   **Power Input:** Dual redundant power supplies (120/240V AC) with automatic failover.

**2. Modular Lighting Units:**

*   **Form Factor:**  Small, rectangular modules (10cm x 5cm x 3cm).
*   **Light Source:**  Addressable RGBW LEDs (individually controllable color and intensity).
*   **Mounting:**  L-track compatible mounting bracket.  Magnetic quick-release mechanism.
*   **Connectivity:**  Power and DMX control provided via L-track connection.
*   **Variants:**
    *   Spotlight (narrow beam)
    *   Floodlight (wide beam)
    *   Strip Light (linear illumination)
    *   Sensor Module (integrated proximity/motion sensor – connects via L-track data lines)

**3. L-Track System:**

*   **Profile:**  Low-profile aluminum track with a standardized slot.
*   **Functionality:**  Provides mechanical mounting, electrical power, and data connectivity for modular lighting and sensor units.
*   **Compatibility:** Integrates seamlessly with crossbar engagement slots.
*   **Electrical Contacts:** Continuous copper strip within the track, providing 24V DC and DMX control.
*   **Data Lines:**  Dedicated data lines running the length of the track for high-speed data transfer (e.g., for camera feeds, environmental sensors).

**4. Control System:**

*   **Software:** Cloud-based platform with a user-friendly interface.
*   **Features:**
    *   Remote control of lighting intensity and color.
    *   Creation of lighting scenes and schedules.
    *   Real-time data visualization from sensors.
    *   Alerting and reporting.
    *   API for integration with other systems.
*   **Communication:**  Wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) and wired (Ethernet) connectivity.

**Pseudocode (Lighting Control):**

```
// Function to set lighting scene
function setScene(sceneName) {
  // Retrieve scene data from cloud
  sceneData = getSceneData(sceneName);

  // Iterate through lighting modules
  for each module in lightingModules {
    // Set module brightness and color based on scene data
    module.setBrightness(sceneData.brightness);
    module.setColor(sceneData.color);
  }
}

// Function to respond to sensor data
function onSensorData(sensorId, data) {
  if (sensorId == "motion_sensor_1") {
    if (data == "detected") {
      // Activate lighting scene "alert"
      setScene("alert");
    } else {
      // Return to default lighting scene
      setScene("default");
    }
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Warehouses: Dynamic lighting for picking and packing, improved safety.
*   Retail: Customizable displays, targeted advertising.
*   Manufacturing: Visual inspection, quality control.
*   Agriculture: Controlled environment lighting for plant growth.
