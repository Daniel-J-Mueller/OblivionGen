## Adaptive Rate Limiting with Predictive Burst Handling

**Specification:** A system augmenting existing rate limiters with predictive burst handling, designed to mitigate short-term, high-volume traffic spikes *before* they impact system resources. This focuses on proactively adjusting rate limits based on observed traffic patterns, rather than reactively throttling.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Traffic Pattern Analyzer (TPA):** Continuously monitors incoming request rates, calculating rolling averages and standard deviations.  Key metrics:
    *   `baseline_rate`:  Long-term average request rate.
    *   `current_rate`:  Short-term (e.g., 5-second) average request rate.
    *   `rate_deviation`:  Standard deviation of request rates over a sliding window.
    *   `spike_threshold`: A configurable multiple of `rate_deviation` added to `baseline_rate`, defining a potential spike.

2.  **Predictive Rate Adjuster (PRA):**  Dynamically adjusts the rate limit for each source network (identified via IP address) based on the TPA’s output.

3.  **Augmented Rate Limiter (ARL):**  Replaces the traditional rate limiter with one receiving dynamically adjusted limits from the PRA. Operates identically to the original rate limiter, but accepts a variable `max_requests` parameter.

**Pseudocode (PRA):**

```
function adjust_rate_limit(ip_address):
  data = get_traffic_data(ip_address) // From TPA

  baseline_rate = data.baseline_rate
  current_rate = data.current_rate
  rate_deviation = data.rate_deviation
  spike_threshold = rate_deviation * configurable_multiplier

  if current_rate > baseline_rate + spike_threshold:
    predicted_rate = current_rate * (1 + configurable_prediction_factor) // Predict a short-term increase
    max_requests = min(predicted_rate, max_configurable_limit) // Cap the limit
  else:
    max_requests = baseline_rate * (1 + configurable_smoothing_factor)  // Smooth the limit

  set_rate_limit(ip_address, max_requests)
```

**System Architecture:**

1.  All incoming requests pass through the TPA.
2.  TPA calculates traffic metrics and sends them to the PRA.
3.  PRA calculates the adjusted rate limit for the request’s source IP.
4.  PRA passes the adjusted `max_requests` parameter to the ARL.
5.  ARL functions as the traditional rate limiter, using the dynamic `max_requests`.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Structures:** Time series databases (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) are ideal for storing traffic metrics.  Efficient queue structures can facilitate real-time data processing.
*   **Configurability:** All thresholds and factors (e.g., `configurable_multiplier`, `configurable_prediction_factor`, `configurable_smoothing_factor`) must be configurable via a central administration interface.
*   **Scalability:** The TPA and PRA should be horizontally scalable to handle high traffic volumes. Consider using a distributed message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for communication between components.
*   **Vectorization:** The calculation of `max_requests` can be vectorized to efficiently process multiple IP addresses simultaneously.
