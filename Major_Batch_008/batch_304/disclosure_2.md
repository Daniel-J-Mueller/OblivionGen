## Haptic Audio Mapping System

**Concept:** Expand beyond visual effects and map audio characteristics to localized haptic feedback. Instead of lights changing, localized vibrations or pressure changes provide a more immersive and nuanced experience, particularly for accessibility or situations where visual distractions are undesirable.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Haptic Array: A flexible array of micro-actuators (e.g., piezoelectric, shape memory alloy) embedded in a wearable surface (vest, chair, wristband). Resolution: minimum 64 actuators, ideally 256+. Actuation range: 0-100% force/vibration intensity.
    *   Audio Processing Unit (APU): Dedicated low-latency processor integrated with the device.
    *   Microphone Array: For ambient audio capture and directional sound analysis (optional, enhances spatial mapping).
    *   Wireless Communication: Bluetooth 5.0 or Wi-Fi 6 for data transfer and control.
*   **Software:**
    *   Audio Analysis Module: Real-time audio processing to extract key features:
        *   Frequency Spectrum:  Identify dominant frequencies and their amplitudes.
        *   Amplitude Peaks: Detect transient peaks and their intensity.
        *   Directional Audio Analysis: Using microphone array, determine the spatial origin of sounds.
        *   Keyword Detection: Leverage existing keyword detection capabilities from the referenced patent.
    *   Haptic Mapping Algorithm:  The core of the system. Maps audio features to haptic actuator control.
        *   Frequency-to-Location Mapping: Assign specific frequency ranges to specific actuators or actuator clusters on the haptic array.  Higher frequencies activate actuators closer to the userâ€™s center, lower frequencies activate actuators further out.
        *   Amplitude-to-Intensity Mapping: Map the amplitude of a given frequency to the intensity of the corresponding actuator.
        *   Directional Mapping:  If directional audio analysis is available, map sound source location to actuator position.  Sound from the left activates actuators on the left side of the array, and vice versa.
        *   Keyword-Triggered Haptics: When a keyword is detected, trigger a pre-defined haptic pattern (e.g., a pulse, a ripple, a localized vibration) to provide an alert or emphasis.
    *   User Profile Management: Allow users to customize haptic mapping preferences and sensitivity levels.
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Algorithm):**

```
function mapAudioToHaptics(audioData, userProfile) {
  frequencySpectrum = analyzeFrequency(audioData);
  directionalData = analyzeDirection(audioData); // Optional

  for each frequencyBand in frequencySpectrum {
    dominantFrequency = findDominantFrequency(frequencyBand);
    amplitude = getAmplitude(frequencyBand);

    // Determine actuator location based on frequency (simplified example)
    actuatorIndex = mapFrequencyToActuator(dominantFrequency);

    // Adjust intensity based on amplitude and user profile
    intensity = amplitude * userProfile.sensitivity;
    intensity = clamp(intensity, 0, 100);

    //If directional data is available, adjust the intensity based on its direction
    if (directionalData != null)
    {
        intensity = adjustIntensityBasedOnDirection(intensity, directionalData, actuatorIndex);
    }

    // Set actuator intensity
    setActuatorIntensity(actuatorIndex, intensity);
  }

  //Keyword mapping
  keyword = detectKeyword(audioData);
  if (keyword != null)
  {
      triggerHapticPattern(keyword);
  }
}
```

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Gaming: Feel the impact of explosions, the direction of enemy fire, or the texture of surfaces.
    *   Accessibility: Provide auditory information for visually impaired users.
    *   Virtual/Augmented Reality: Enhance immersion and provide tactile feedback in virtual environments.
    *   Music Production: Feel the nuances of sound in real-time.
    *   Meditation/Wellness:  Use rhythmic vibrations to promote relaxation and mindfulness.
