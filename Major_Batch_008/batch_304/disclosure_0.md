## Dynamic Inventory Re-Allocation Based on Predicted Order Profiles

**System Components:**

*   **Order Profile Predictor:** AI module analyzing historical order data, seasonality, trending products, and external factors (weather, events) to predict future order profiles â€“ specifically, the probability of items being ordered *together*. Output: Probability matrix of co-occurrence for all SKUs.
*   **Real-Time Inventory Mapping:** A constantly updated digital twin of the materials handling facility, tracking inventory location at a granular level (down to specific shelf/bin).
*   **Automated Re-Allocation System:** Robotic system (AGVs, conveyors, robotic arms) capable of physically moving inventory within the facility.
*   **Dimension Scanning System:** High-speed 3D scanners at receive stations and within inventory zones to verify and update item dimensions in the system.
*   **Custom Container Request Module:** Communicates with custom container forming devices.

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Real-time order data, inventory levels, item dimensions, and predicted order profiles are continuously fed into the system.
2.  **Co-Occurrence Analysis:** The Order Profile Predictor analyzes predicted order profiles, identifying item pairs with high co-occurrence probability.
3.  **Proximity Scoring:** The system assigns a "proximity score" to each item based on its co-occurrence with other items. Higher scores indicate items frequently ordered together.
4.  **Dynamic Re-Allocation:** The system identifies items with high proximity scores that are currently located far apart in the facility. It then initiates automated re-allocation to bring these items closer together.
5.  **Custom Container Pre-Formation:** If the predicted order profile suggests a high probability of an item being ordered with a specific second item, the system *pre-forms* a custom container designed to hold both items. This container is then staged near the inventory location of the first item.
6.  **Pick & Pack Optimization:** When an order is received, the system prioritizes picking items that are already paired in pre-formed custom containers. This significantly reduces pick time and minimizes the need for manual packing.
7.  **Inventory Balancing:** The system monitors inventory levels in different zones and dynamically adjusts re-allocation to prevent bottlenecks and ensure optimal throughput.
8.  **Dimension Verification:** Upon receiving items at the receive station, the dimension scanning system will verify the dimensions in our system.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - runs continuously

function mainLoop() {

  // 1. Data Ingestion
  orderData = getLatestOrderData();
  inventoryData = getLatestInventoryData();
  dimensionData = getLatestDimensionData();

  // 2. Calculate Proximity Scores
  proximityScores = calculateProximityScores(orderData);

  // 3. Identify Items for Re-Allocation
  itemsToReallocate = findItemsForReallocation(proximityScores, inventoryData);

  // 4. Create Re-Allocation Plan
  reallocationPlan = createReallocationPlan(itemsToReallocate, inventoryData);

  // 5. Initiate Re-Allocation
  executeReallocationPlan(reallocationPlan);

  // 6. Pre-Form Custom Containers (based on high-probability item pairs)
  containerRequests = generateContainerRequests(orderData, dimensionData);
  formCustomContainers(containerRequests);
}

// Functions (examples)

function calculateProximityScores(orderData) {
  // Analyze orderData to determine co-occurrence probabilities
  // Output: Dictionary mapping item pairs to proximity scores
}

function findItemsForReallocation(proximityScores, inventoryData) {
  // Identify item pairs with high proximity scores that are far apart
  // Output: List of items to be reallocated
}

function createReallocationPlan(itemsToReallocate, inventoryData) {
  // Generate an optimized plan for moving items, considering constraints
  // Output: List of move requests
}

function executeReallocationPlan(reallocationPlan) {
  // Initiate the automated movement of items based on the plan
}
```

**Innovation Focus:** Proactive inventory arrangement based on *predicted* demand, rather than reactive response to current orders.  This aims to minimize walking distances, reduce pick times, and streamline the fulfillment process. The pre-formation of custom containers is key.
