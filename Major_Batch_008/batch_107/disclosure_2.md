## Multi-Modal Emotional State Triggered Dialogue Branching

**Concept:** Expand beyond user profiles to incorporate real-time emotional state analysis from audio *and* video input to dynamically alter dialogue paths and content delivery. The goal is to create a truly adaptive conversational experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Audio stream (speech).
    *   Video stream (facial expressions, body language).
    *   Existing dialogue session ID.
*   **Modules:**
    *   **Audio Analysis Module:** Performs speech-to-text conversion *and* emotional tone/sentiment analysis (frustration, excitement, sadness, etc.). Leverages pre-trained models, customizable per content source. Output: Sentiment score (0-1), Emotion classification (list).
    *   **Video Analysis Module:**  Utilizes computer vision to detect facial expressions (anger, joy, surprise, fear, disgust, neutral), head pose, and body language (e.g., fidgeting, leaning forward). Output: Emotion classifications (list), Confidence scores for each classification.
    *   **Emotional Fusion Engine:** Combines outputs from Audio and Video Analysis Modules, weighting each based on signal quality and reliability.  Uses a Bayesian network or similar probabilistic model to infer a dominant emotional state. Output: Dominant Emotional State (e.g., 'Highly Frustrated', 'Generally Positive', 'Neutral'), Confidence Score.
    *   **Dialogue Branching Manager:**  Maintains a hierarchical dialogue flow with multiple branches contingent on the inferred emotional state.  This manager references a "Emotional Dialogue Graph" (EDG).  EDG defines pre-scripted alternative responses, content adjustments, or even session hand-offs based on emotional thresholds.
    *   **Content Adaptation Module:** Adjusts content delivery based on emotional state. Examples: simplifying language for a frustrated user, offering celebratory visuals for an excited user, pausing a tutorial for a confused user.
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  Receive audio and video streams.
    2.  Audio Analysis Module processes audio, generating sentiment & emotion data.
    3.  Video Analysis Module processes video, generating emotion data.
    4.  Emotional Fusion Engine combines the data, inferring the dominant emotional state.
    5.  Dialogue Branching Manager consults the EDG to determine the appropriate dialogue branch based on the emotional state and current session context.
    6.  Content Adaptation Module modifies content delivery as needed.
    7.  Generate and send output data to the device.
*   **Pseudocode (Dialogue Branching Manager):**

    ```
    function select_dialogue_branch(current_node_id, emotional_state, confidence_score)
        if confidence_score > threshold_confidence:
            if emotional_state == "Highly Frustrated":
                next_node_id = get_frustration_branch(current_node_id)
            elif emotional_state == "Generally Positive":
                next_node_id = get_positive_branch(current_node_id)
            elif emotional_state == "Neutral":
                next_node_id = get_neutral_branch(current_node_id)
            else:
                next_node_id = get_default_branch(current_node_id)
        else:
            next_node_id = get_default_branch(current_node_id)
        return next_node_id
    ```

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Emotional Dialogue Graph (EDG):**  A directed graph where nodes represent dialogue states and edges represent transitions based on emotional state.
    *   **Emotion Classifications:**  Data structure holding emotion labels (anger, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, neutral), confidence scores, and timestamps.

*   **Considerations:**
    *   Privacy:  Ensure user consent for video analysis.
    *   Accuracy:  Develop robust emotion recognition algorithms that work across diverse demographics and lighting conditions.
    *   Latency: Minimize processing time to maintain a natural conversational flow.
    *   Customization: Allow content sources to define custom emotional thresholds and dialogue branches.
