## Modular, Interlocking Container System with Active Height Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand beyond a simple collapsible container to a modular system of containers that can interlock for transport and storage, and *actively* adjust height via integrated pneumatic actuators to optimize space utilization in warehouses or transport vehicles.

**System Components:**

*   **Core Container Module:** Based on the provided patent’s collapsible framework, but reinforced for heavier loads and stacking. L-shaped sidewalls, hinged end walls, and a bottom wall are standard. However, materials would be higher grade polymers or lightweight alloys.
*   **Vertical Actuation System:** Each corner of the container module incorporates a pneumatic actuator (cylinder) housed within a reinforced corner post. These actuators connect to telescoping corner posts, allowing the container’s height to be adjusted. A centralized control system (see below) manages these actuators.
*   **Interlocking Mechanism:** Sidewalls feature integrated, retractable locking pins that engage with corresponding receivers on adjacent containers. These pins provide structural stability when containers are stacked or transported as a unit.
*   **Centralized Control System:** A small, onboard microcontroller (MCU) manages the pneumatic actuators and locking pins. The MCU communicates wirelessly (Bluetooth/WiFi) with a central warehouse management system (WMS) or a handheld scanner for manual control.
*   **Pressure Source/Reservoir:** A small, integrated compressed air reservoir provides power for the pneumatic actuators.  This reservoir can be recharged via a standard power supply or a dedicated charging station. An external compressed air line option would be available.
*   **Load Sensors:** Integrated load cells in the container base provide weight data to the MCU, allowing for automated height adjustments based on load weight and predetermined parameters.

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Height Adjustment Range:** 50% - 100% of maximum height. (e.g. Max height = 1m, adjustment range = 0.5m – 1m)
2.  **Actuation Speed:**  0-10cm/second (adjustable via WMS).
3.  **Load Capacity:** 100kg - 500kg (scalable based on module size and materials).
4.  **Communication Protocol:** WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 5.0.
5.  **Power Supply:** 12V DC, 5A.
6.  **Materials:**  High-density polyethylene (HDPE) or aluminum alloy for the container body. Stainless steel for the pneumatic actuators and locking pins.

**Pseudocode (Height Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
// Input: targetHeight (desired container height in cm)
// Input: currentHeight (current container height in cm)
// Input: maxLoad (maximum load capacity in kg)
// Input: currentLoad (current load in kg)

function adjustHeight(targetHeight, currentHeight, maxLoad, currentLoad) {

    if (currentLoad > maxLoad) {
        displayError("Overload condition! Reduce load before adjusting height.")
        return
    }

    if (targetHeight > 100 || targetHeight < 50) {
        displayError("Invalid target height. Must be between 50 and 100 cm.")
        return
    }

    heightDifference = targetHeight - currentHeight

    // Calculate actuator extension/retraction required for each corner
    extensionAmount = heightDifference / 4  // Assuming equal distribution across 4 corners

    // Send command to each pneumatic actuator to extend/retract by extensionAmount
    for each actuator in actuatorList {
        actuator.extendRetract(extensionAmount)
    }

    //Update currentHeight variable
    currentHeight = targetHeight
}

```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Automated Stacking/Unstacking:** Integrate with robotic systems for fully automated warehouse operations.
*   **Temperature/Humidity Sensors:** Incorporate sensors to monitor environmental conditions inside the container.
*   **RFID Tagging:** Integrate RFID tags for tracking and inventory management.
*   **Transparent/Translucent Modules:**  Offer modules with transparent or translucent panels for easy visual inspection of contents.
