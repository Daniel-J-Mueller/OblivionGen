## Adaptive Network Topology Mirroring

**Concept:** A system for dynamically mirroring network topology based on observed state change rates and heuristic analysis, creating a ‘shadow’ network for advanced diagnostics, security anomaly detection, and predictive failure analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   *Mirror Controller:* Centralized system, or distributed across edge devices, responsible for initiating and managing mirror creation/deletion.
    *   *State Observation Module:*  Resides on each edge device. Monitors state changes (configuration, traffic patterns, performance metrics).
    *   *Heuristic Engine:* Implemented within the Mirror Controller. Analyzes observed state change rates and patterns.
    *   *Shadow Network:* A virtual or physically separate network mirroring the primary network topology.  Can be implemented using software-defined networking (SDN) or dedicated hardware.
    *   *Traffic Replication Module:* Responsible for duplicating specific network traffic to the Shadow Network.  Selective replication based on heuristic analysis.

*   **Operation:**
    1.  Edge devices' State Observation Modules report state change rates to the Mirror Controller.
    2.  The Heuristic Engine analyzes these rates. High rates, unusual patterns, or anomalies trigger mirror creation requests.  Heuristics incorporate client identity (as per the provided patent), configuration type, and historical data.
    3.  The Mirror Controller initiates mirror creation:
        *   A ‘shadow’ topology mirroring the relevant portion of the primary network is spun up (virtual or physical).
        *   The Traffic Replication Module is configured to selectively copy traffic based on predefined rules and heuristic analysis. (e.g., traffic to/from a potentially compromised host, traffic associated with a critical service, or traffic exhibiting anomalous behavior).
    4.  The Shadow Network operates independently, allowing for:
        *   *Real-time diagnostics:* Analysis of mirrored traffic without impacting the production network.
        *   *Security anomaly detection:*  Identification of malicious activity that might go unnoticed in the production network.
        *   *Predictive failure analysis:* Modeling potential network failures based on observed trends in the Shadow Network.
        *   *Configuration testing:* Testing configuration changes in a safe, isolated environment before deploying them to the production network.
    5.  Based on continued heuristic analysis, mirrors are dynamically adjusted or deleted when the triggering conditions subside.

*   **Pseudocode (Mirror Controller):**

```
FUNCTION AnalyzeStateChanges(stateChangeData)
  IF stateChangeRate(stateChangeData) > threshold AND clientIdentity(stateChangeData) IN suspiciousClients THEN
    mirrorID = CreateMirror(stateChangeData.affectedDevice)
    ConfigureTrafficReplication(mirrorID, stateChangeData)
  ENDIF

  IF stateChangeData.configurationType == "criticalService" THEN
    mirrorID = CreateMirror(stateChangeData.affectedDevice)
    ConfigureTrafficReplication(mirrorID, stateChangeData)
  ENDIF

  IF historicalRateOfChange(stateChangeData.affectedDevice) > historicalThreshold THEN
    mirrorID = CreateMirror(stateChangeData.affectedDevice)
    ConfigureTrafficReplication(mirrorID, stateChangeData)
  ENDIF

  IF mirrorExists(stateChangeData.affectedDevice) AND stateChangeRate(stateChangeData) < safeThreshold THEN
    DeleteMirror(stateChangeData.affectedDevice)
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
