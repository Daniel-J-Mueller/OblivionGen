## Dynamic Input Profile Generation & Predictive Switching

**Concept:** Leverage the delayed input analysis from the patent not just for *identifying* input types, but for dynamically building and predicting user input profiles. This moves beyond simple device identification toward understanding *how* a user interacts with different devices, optimizing workflows and anticipating needs.

**Specs:**

**1. Profile Data Structure:**

```
ProfileEntry = {
    DeviceType: ENUM (Keyboard, Scanner, RFID, Touchscreen, Voice),
    InputPattern: [CharacterSequence, TimestampDelta], // Sequence of characters/data + time between inputs
    CommandProbabilityMap: {Command: Probability}, //Likelihood of specific commands based on input sequence
    ErrorRate: Float, //Measure of input errors (e.g., misreads, typos)
    User: UserID //Unique user identifier
}

UserProfile = {
    UserID: UserID,
    DeviceProfiles: [ProfileEntry]
}
```

**2. Data Acquisition & Processing Module:**

*   **Input Monitoring:** Intercepts all input streams (keyboard, scanner, etc.).
*   **Timing Analysis:** Records timestamps for each character/data element received.
*   **Sequence Capture:**  Stores input sequences of configurable length (e.g., last 10 characters, last 5 scans).
*   **Error Detection:** Implements basic error detection (e.g., checksum verification for scans, spellcheck for keyboard input).
*   **Profile Update:** Regularly updates `ProfileEntry` data for each device used by the user, adjusting `CommandProbabilityMap` and `ErrorRate` based on recent input. Historical data is maintained for long-term analysis.

**3. Predictive Switching Algorithm:**

*   **Real-time Analysis:** As input is received, the algorithm analyzes the current input sequence and compares it to stored `ProfileEntry` data.
*   **Probability Scoring:** Calculates a probability score for each potential device type based on the similarity of the current input sequence to the stored profiles.
*   **Thresholding:** If the probability score for a device type exceeds a configurable threshold, the system proactively switches to that device's expected input mode.
*   **Confidence Level:**  A 'confidence level' is assigned to the prediction. Low confidence predictions trigger a visual prompt to the user (e.g., "Did you mean to scan?") before switching modes.
*   **Example:** User starts typing "123". The system predicts keyboard input. After "1234", the user pauses, then a scanner beeps. The system quickly switches to scan mode because the pause + scan event strongly indicates a barcode input, overriding the initial keyboard prediction.

**4. Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**

*   Monitors the accuracy of predictions.
*   Adjusts the probability threshold dynamically based on user behavior and environmental factors (e.g., ambient noise, network latency).
*   Uses machine learning to identify patterns that improve prediction accuracy over time.

**5. System Components:**

*   **Input Interceptor:** Low-level driver/service that captures all input streams.
*   **Profile Database:** Stores `UserProfile` data.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Implements the predictive switching algorithm.
*   **UI/UX Module:** Provides visual prompts and allows users to override predictions.



This system isn't just about *identifying* the input device, itâ€™s about *anticipating* what the user *intends* to do with it, creating a more fluid and efficient user experience.
