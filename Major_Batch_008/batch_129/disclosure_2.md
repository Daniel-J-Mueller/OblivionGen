## Dynamic Persona Stitching for Multi-Modal Interaction Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the latent feature generation to incorporate *real-time* multi-modal data streams (audio, video, text) and dynamically "stitch" these streams into a cohesive, evolving persona representation. This allows for prediction of user interaction *beyond* historical data, incorporating immediate context and intention.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Input Layer:**
    *   Audio: Microphone input, processed via spectrogram analysis and feature extraction (MFCCs, pitch, energy).
    *   Video: Camera input, processed via facial expression recognition, object detection, and pose estimation.
    *   Text: Voice-to-text transcription of spoken input, or direct text input.
    *   Historical Data: Existing user interaction data (as described in the provided patent).

2.  **Temporal Fusion Network (TFN):**
    *   Input: Processed outputs from each modality in (1).
    *   Architecture:  A recurrent neural network (LSTM or GRU) with attention mechanisms. Each modality has a dedicated recurrent layer.  Attention weights determine the relative importance of each modality at each time step.
    *   Output: A time-series of modality-fused latent vectors.

3.  **Persona Stitching Module:**
    *   Input: Time-series of fused latent vectors from (2) *and* the existing user signature (from the original patent).
    *   Process: A separate neural network (Transformer architecture preferred) responsible for dynamically combining the historical user signature with the incoming real-time data.  This network learns to prioritize aspects of the current context while maintaining a core understanding of the user’s long-term preferences. It generates a continuously updated "current persona vector".

4.  **Interaction Prediction Layer:**
    *   Input:  Current persona vector (from 3).
    *   Process:  A standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or similar classifier.  Predicts the likelihood of various user interactions (view, purchase, click, etc.) for a given set of content.

5.  **System Architecture:**
    *   Hardware: Dedicated edge computing device (e.g., smartphone, smart speaker) or cloud-based server.
    *   Software:  Deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch), real-time signal processing libraries, communication protocols (e.g., WebSockets).

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Initialization
user_signature = load_user_signature(user_id) # From historical data
tfn = initialize_temporal_fusion_network()
persona_stitcher = initialize_persona_stitcher()
interaction_predictor = initialize_interaction_predictor()

# Real-time Loop
while True:
    audio_data = capture_audio()
    video_data = capture_video()
    text_data = capture_text()

    audio_features = process_audio(audio_data)
    video_features = process_video(video_data)
    text_features = process_text(text_data)

    fused_latent_vector = tfn.process(audio_features, video_features, text_features)
    current_persona_vector = persona_stitcher.combine(user_signature, fused_latent_vector)
    
    #Get current content options
    content_options = get_content_options()

    predicted_interactions = interaction_predictor.predict(current_persona_vector, content_options)

    recommendations = select_top_recommendations(predicted_interactions)

    display_recommendations(recommendations)

    update_user_signature(current_persona_vector) #Periodically update for long term preference changes
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Hyper-personalized recommendations that adapt to the user’s immediate emotional state.
*   Proactive content delivery based on predicted user needs.
*   Context-aware advertising that is more relevant and engaging.
*   Assistive technologies that can anticipate user intentions.
