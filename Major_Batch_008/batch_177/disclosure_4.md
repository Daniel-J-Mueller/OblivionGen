## Adaptive Power Allocation via Predictive Subsystem Load

**Concept:** Expand upon the fault detection and power disconnection scheme to *proactively* manage power allocation based on predicted subsystem load, optimizing for efficiency and extending operational duration, particularly for unmanned vehicles.  Instead of solely reacting to faults, the system anticipates needs and adjusts power delivery *before* issues arise.

**Specs:**

*   **Subsystem Load Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time telemetry data from all vehicle subsystems (current draw, voltage, temperature, operating mode, sensor data, flight control commands). Historical operational data (log of subsystem load under various conditions). Environmental data (wind speed, temperature, altitude).
    *   Process: Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) – to model the temporal dependencies in subsystem load. Training dataset: Extensive logs of vehicle operation, labelled with operational parameters and subsystem load.  RNN outputs a predicted load profile for each subsystem over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 5, 10, 15 seconds).
    *   Output: Predicted current draw and voltage requirements for each subsystem over the prediction horizon. Confidence intervals associated with each prediction.
*   **Dynamic Power Allocation Controller:**
    *   Input: Predicted subsystem load profiles (from the Subsystem Load Prediction Module). Current system power availability (battery state of charge, generator output, etc.).  Subsystem priority levels (user-defined or pre-programmed).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Power Budgeting:** Calculate a total predicted power demand based on the predicted load profiles.
        2.  **Constraint Evaluation:** Compare the total predicted demand with available power. If demand exceeds availability, initiate power rationing.
        3.  **Priority-Based Allocation:** Allocate power to subsystems based on their priority levels. Higher-priority subsystems receive full power allocation. Lower-priority subsystems receive reduced allocation or are temporarily powered down.
        4.  **Predictive Power Shifting:** If a subsystem is predicted to experience a surge in demand, preemptively reduce power to lower-priority subsystems to ensure sufficient power is available.
        5.  **Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling (DVFS):** For compatible subsystems, adjust operating voltage and frequency to reduce power consumption without significantly impacting performance.
    *   Output: Control signals to power supply controllers, instructing them to adjust power delivery to individual subsystems.
*   **Fault Prediction Integration:**
    *   Integrate the existing fault detection logic into the Dynamic Power Allocation Controller.  If a fault is predicted, prioritize critical subsystems and initiate emergency procedures (e.g., controlled landing).
*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   High-resolution current and voltage sensors for each subsystem.
    *   Real-time data acquisition system.
    *   Embedded processing unit (GPU/FPGA) for running the RNN and Dynamic Power Allocation Controller.
    *   Programmable power supply controllers.
*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Power Allocation Controller):**

```
function allocatePower(predictedLoads, availablePower, subsystemPriorities):
  totalPredictedDemand = sum(predictedLoads)

  if totalPredictedDemand > availablePower:
    // Power rationing required
    sortedSubsystems = sortSubsystemsByPriority(subsystemPriorities)

    powerAllocated = 0
    for subsystem in sortedSubsystems:
      if powerAllocated < availablePower:
        allocation = min(predictedLoads[subsystem], availablePower - powerAllocated)
        setSubsystemPower(subsystem, allocation)
        powerAllocated += allocation
      else:
        setSubsystemPower(subsystem, 0) // Power down

  else:
    // Sufficient power available
    for subsystem in subsystems:
      setSubsystemPower(subsystem, predictedLoads[subsystem])

  //Check for faults
  if (anyFaultDetected()):
    prioritizeCriticalSystems()
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive fault isolation to *proactive* power management. By predicting subsystem load and dynamically allocating power, it can significantly improve efficiency, extend operational duration, and enhance overall system reliability.  The combination of RNN-based load prediction, priority-based allocation, and DVFS offers a comprehensive solution for intelligent power management in unmanned vehicles and other power-constrained applications.
