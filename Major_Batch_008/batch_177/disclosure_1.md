## Dynamic Encryption Granularity & Behavioral Profiling

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting encryption granularity *within* data fields, coupled with behavioral profiling to predict sensitive data even *before* itâ€™s submitted.

**Core Concept:** Move beyond field-level encryption.  Instead, analyze the *content* within a field to determine precisely which portions require encryption, minimizing data exposure and optimizing performance.  Combine this with a predictive model that anticipates likely sensitive data based on user behavior and context.

**Components:**

*   **Granular Encryption Engine:** Operates on individual data elements within a field (e.g., specific digits of a credit card number, keywords within a text field). This isn't character-by-character, but semantic-aware segmentation.
*   **Behavioral Prediction Model:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on anonymized user session data, including input patterns, navigation history, and interaction types. This model predicts the probability that a given input field will contain sensitive information *before* the data is submitted.
*   **Sensitivity Scoring System:**  Assigns a sensitivity score to each data element based on the Behavioral Prediction Model, pre-defined rules (e.g., regex matching for PII), and contextual information (e.g., form field labels).
*   **Dynamic Encryption Policy:**  A rule engine that applies encryption based on the sensitivity score.  Rules could be tiered (e.g., score > 0.8: fully encrypt; 0.5-0.8: partially encrypt; <0.5: no encryption).
*   **Adaptive Learning Loop:**  Continuously refine the Behavioral Prediction Model based on user feedback and data audits.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Encryption Process):**

```
function encryptData(data, fieldName, userId) {
  sensitivityMap = analyzeDataForSensitivity(data, fieldName, userId);

  encryptedData = "";
  for (i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    element = data[i];
    sensitivityScore = sensitivityMap[i];

    if (sensitivityScore > 0.8) {
      encryptedData += encrypt(element); // Full Encryption
    } else if (sensitivityScore > 0.5) {
      encryptedData += mask(element); // Partial Encryption/Masking
    } else {
      encryptedData += element; // No Encryption
    }
  }

  return encryptedData;
}

function analyzeDataForSensitivity(data, fieldName, userId) {
  // 1. Behavioral Prediction: Predict sensitivity based on user behavior & context
  predictedSensitivity = predictSensitivity(data, fieldName, userId);

  // 2. Rule-Based Analysis: Apply predefined rules (regex, keywords)
  ruleBasedSensitivity = analyzeRules(data);

  // 3. Combine Predictions & Rules for a sensitivity score for each element.
  elementSensitivity = combineScores(elementSensitivity, ruleBasedSensitivity);

  return elementSensitivity;
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User inputs data.
2.  Data is passed to the `analyzeDataForSensitivity` function.
3.  Behavioral Prediction Model and Rule-Based Analysis are applied.
4.  Sensitivity scores are calculated for each data element.
5.  Dynamic Encryption Policy determines the encryption level.
6.  Data is encrypted/masked accordingly.
7.  Encrypted data is transmitted/stored.
8.  User feedback is used to refine the Behavioral Prediction Model.



**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple field-level encryption by dynamically adapting the encryption granularity based on predicted sensitivity and data content. The behavioral prediction component adds a proactive layer of security, identifying potentially sensitive data before it's even submitted. It anticipates, rather than reacts.
