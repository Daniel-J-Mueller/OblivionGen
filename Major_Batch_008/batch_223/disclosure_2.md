## Dynamic Hierarchy Weighting via Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the automated hierarchy detection by incorporating predictive modeling to dynamically weight hierarchy levels based on anticipated query patterns and real-time data influence.  Instead of a static hierarchy, the system builds a 'probability cloud' around possible hierarchy traversals, adjusting computation priority and pre-aggregation to optimize responsiveness.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Input:** Transactional data, real-time data streams (user location, device info, etc.), historical query logs.
*   **Feature Extraction:**
    *   **Hierarchy Features:**  Dimension/level correlations (as in the base patent). Frequency of co-occurrence, conditional probabilities (P(Level | Dimension)).
    *   **Query Features:**  Aggregation types (SUM, AVG, COUNT), filtering criteria, dimensions/levels used in queries, query execution time.
    *   **Real-time Features:** User segments (demographics, behavior), geographical regions, time of day, device types.
*   **Data Storage:** Feature vectors stored in a time-series database optimized for fast retrieval and updates.

**2. Predictive Model Training:**

*   **Model Type:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – suitable for sequential data (query logs, time-series features).  Alternatively, a Transformer model could be employed.
*   **Training Data:** Historical query logs, paired with corresponding feature vectors and observed query execution times.
*   **Output:**  Probability distribution over possible hierarchy traversals (paths through the n-dimensional cube).  Higher probability indicates a more likely query path.
*   **Retraining Schedule:**  Model retrained periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) based on new data.  Online learning techniques can also be incorporated for continuous adaptation.

**3. Dynamic Hierarchy Management:**

*   **Hierarchy Weighting:**  Multiply the weight of each hierarchy level by the predicted probability of traversing that level, based on the output of the predictive model.
*   **Pre-Aggregation:**  Pre-aggregate data along the highest-weighted hierarchy paths to minimize query latency.
*   **Computation Prioritization:** Prioritize computation of data points associated with the highest-weighted hierarchy paths.  Implement a queuing system to manage data point processing.
*   **Adaptive Sampling:** For lower-weighted paths, employ adaptive sampling techniques to reduce computational overhead without significantly impacting accuracy.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:**  Adjust hierarchy weights and computation priorities in real-time based on incoming data streams (user location, device info).

**4. Pseudocode for Computation Prioritization:**

```
// HierarchyNode represents a level in the hierarchy
class HierarchyNode {
    dimension;
    level;
    weight; // Dynamic weight based on predictive model
    dataPoint; // Pointer to the aggregated data
    priorityQueuePosition;
}

// Priority Queue implementation (e.g., using a heap)
PriorityQueue<HierarchyNode> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Double.compare(b.weight, a.weight));

// When new data arrives
function processData(data) {
    // Iterate through relevant HierarchyNodes
    for (node in nodes) {
        // Update node's dataPoint based on data
        node.dataPoint = update(node.dataPoint, data);

        // Re-insert into PriorityQueue based on updated weight
        queue.remove(node);
        queue.add(node);
    }
}

// Function to retrieve the next data point to compute
function getNextDataPoint() {
    return queue.poll(); // Returns the highest weighted node
}
```

**5.  System Architecture:**

*   **Data Ingestion Layer:** Collects transactional data, real-time data streams, and historical query logs.
*   **Feature Engineering Layer:** Extracts relevant features from the ingested data.
*   **Predictive Modeling Layer:** Trains and maintains the predictive model.
*   **Hierarchy Management Layer:** Dynamically weights hierarchy levels and prioritizes computation.
*   **Data Storage Layer:** Stores feature vectors, predictive model outputs, and aggregated data.
*   **Query Processing Layer:** Executes queries against the dynamically managed hierarchy.
