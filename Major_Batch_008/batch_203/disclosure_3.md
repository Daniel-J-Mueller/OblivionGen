## Adaptive Storage Consumer Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the reservation/permission system to include dynamic, profile-based access control linked to workload characteristics. Instead of static permissions, access is granted based on real-time monitoring of the storage consumer's behavior.

**Specification:**

**1. Profile Definition:**

*   A ‘Profile Manager’ component is introduced.
*   Profiles are defined with criteria based on:
    *   IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) - Min/Max thresholds.
    *   Throughput (MB/s) - Min/Max thresholds.
    *   Access Pattern (Random/Sequential read/write ratios).
    *   Data Sensitivity Level (High/Medium/Low - used for encryption/access control).
    *   Application Tag (identifier for the workload running on the consumer).
*   Each profile specifies associated permissions (Read, Write, Execute, etc.) and potentially QoS (Quality of Service) settings.

**2. Real-Time Monitoring Agent:**

*   Each compute instance (storage consumer) runs a ‘Monitoring Agent’.
*   The Agent continuously monitors workload characteristics (IOPS, Throughput, Access Pattern).
*   It sends this data to a ‘Profile Evaluator’ component.

**3. Profile Evaluator:**

*   This component resides on the storage server.
*   It receives workload data from the Monitoring Agents.
*   It evaluates the received data against defined profiles.
*   Based on the matching profile, it dynamically adjusts access permissions for the consumer.
*   Supports multiple profiles per consumer, prioritizing them based on defined rules.

**4. Dynamic Permission Adjustment:**

*   If workload characteristics fall outside of the current profile’s thresholds, the Profile Evaluator triggers a permission change.
*   This could involve:
    *   Reducing write access.
    *   Throttling IOPS.
    *   Increasing read-only access.
    *   Alerting administrators.

**5.  Integration with Reservation System:**

*   Existing reservation records are augmented with a ‘Profile ID’ field.
*   The Profile ID links the reservation to a specific profile.
*   The system defaults to the defined profile permissions if no profile is specified.

**Pseudocode - Profile Evaluator:**

```
function EvaluateProfile(workloadData, reservationRecord):
  profileID = reservationRecord.profileID
  if profileID == null:
    return reservationRecord.permissions //Use default permissions

  profile = GetProfile(profileID)

  if IsWorkloadMatchingProfile(workloadData, profile):
    return profile.permissions
  else:
    // Handle mismatched profile (e.g., revert to default permissions or trigger alert)
    return GetDefaultPermissions()
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Profile`: {`profileID`, `name`, `IOPS_min`, `IOPS_max`, `throughput_min`, `throughput_max`, `access_pattern`, `permissions`}
*   `WorkloadData`: {`IOPS`, `throughput`, `read_ratio`, `write_ratio`}
*   `ReservationRecord`: {`reservationID`, `consumerID`, `profileID`, `permissions`}
