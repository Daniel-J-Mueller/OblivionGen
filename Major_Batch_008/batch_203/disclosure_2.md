## Dynamic Data Provenance & Attestation Layer

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand function execution to not only *transform* data, but also to build a cryptographically verifiable provenance chain *alongside* the data itself. This creates an auditable record of every modification, function applied, and the context under which it occurred.  

**Specifications:**

1.  **Provenance Metadata Structure:** Define a standardized metadata structure to accompany each data object (or chunk of a data object). This structure will include:
    *   `creation_timestamp`:  When the object was initially created.
    *   `object_hash`:  Cryptographic hash of the original object.
    *   `transformation_history`: A list of `TransformationEvent` objects.

2.  **TransformationEvent Structure:**
    *   `event_id`: Unique identifier for the event.
    *   `function_id`: Identifier for the function executed.
    *   `function_version`: Version of the function.
    *   `execution_timestamp`: When the function was executed.
    *   `context_data_hash`:  Hash of the context data used during execution (source IP, location, access rights etc.).
    *   `input_hash`: Hash of the data *before* transformation.
    *   `output_hash`: Hash of the data *after* transformation.
    *   `digital_signature`: Digital signature of the event data, signed using a private key associated with the function owner/operator.

3.  **Modified I/O Pipeline:**
    *   **Request Interception:**  Intercept incoming I/O requests (GET, PUT, etc.).
    *   **Function Determination:** Determine if a function should be applied based on the request, object ownership, and defined policies.
    *   **Data Extraction:** Extract the relevant portion of the data object.
    *   **Provenance Snapshot:**  Create a "before" snapshot by hashing the extracted data.
    *   **Function Execution:** Execute the chosen function on the data.
    *   **Provenance Event Creation:** Create a `TransformationEvent` object, populate it with the relevant data, and digitally sign it.
    *   **Data Update/Storage:** Update the data object (or store the transformed version) *alongside* the `TransformationEvent` in the data store.  The metadata structure is stored alongside the data, allowing for efficient retrieval.
    *   **Response Generation:** Generate the response to the client, based on the transformed data.

4. **Attestation Service:**  Implement an Attestation Service that can verify the integrity of the provenance chain.
    *   **Chain Validation:**  The Attestation Service can validate the entire chain of `TransformationEvent`s for a given data object. It checks the digital signatures, verifies the hashes, and ensures that the chain is unbroken.
    *   **Context Verification:**  The service can verify the context data associated with each event.  This allows auditors to determine if the transformations were performed under authorized conditions.
    *   **API Endpoint:**  Expose an API endpoint that clients and auditors can use to request attestation reports.

5.  **Pseudocode (I/O Pipeline Modification)**

```
function handle_io_request(request):
  data = get_data_from_request(request)
  
  if is_function_applicable(request, data):
    function_id = determine_function(request, data)
    
    // Capture 'before' state
    before_hash = hash_data(data)
    
    transformed_data = execute_function(function_id, data, request.context)
    
    // Capture 'after' state
    after_hash = hash_data(transformed_data)

    transformation_event = create_transformation_event(
        function_id,
        request.context,
        before_hash,
        after_hash
    )
    
    sign_transformation_event(transformation_event, function_owner_private_key)
    
    store_data(transformed_data, transformation_event) // Store together
    
    return transformed_data
  else:
    return data
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Compliance & Auditing:** Easily demonstrate compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Data Lineage Tracking:** Understand the complete history of data transformations.
*   **Fraud Detection:** Identify unauthorized modifications to data.
*   **Secure Data Sharing:** Enable secure data sharing with verifiable data integrity.
