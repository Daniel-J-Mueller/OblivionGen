## Dynamic Volumetric Glare Field Generation

**Concept:** Extend glare correction beyond pixel-level adjustments by creating a dynamic, volumetric field representing glare intensity and direction. This allows for more realistic glare simulation and correction, accounting for light diffusion and scattering within the environment, rather than simply darkening individual pixels.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Depth sensor (ToF or structured light):  Capture a real-time depth map of the environment up to 5 meters. Resolution: 640x480 minimum. Update rate: 30Hz minimum.
    *   RGB Camera: High dynamic range camera for accurate color and luminance capture. Resolution: 1920x1080 minimum. Update rate: 60Hz minimum.
    *   IMU:  Inertial Measurement Unit for precise device orientation tracking.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of real-time 3D rendering and complex calculations. Minimum processing power: 10 TOPS.
*   **Volumetric Field Representation:** Utilize a sparse voxel octree (SVO) to represent the 3D environment and store glare intensity values within each voxel. Voxel size: Dynamically adjusted based on distance from the device, ranging from 1cm to 50cm.
*   **Glare Source Identification & Tracking:**
    *   Utilize computer vision algorithms (e.g., SSD, YOLO) to identify and track light sources within the RGB camera's field of view.
    *   Combine RGB camera data with depth sensor data to determine the 3D position and intensity of each light source.
*   **Ray Marching:** Implement a ray marching algorithm that casts rays from each display pixel through the SVO.
    *   For each ray, accumulate glare intensity values along its path.
    *   Calculate a glare contribution factor based on the accumulated intensity.
*   **Display Correction:**
    *   Apply a dynamic glare effect to display pixels based on the calculated glare contribution factor.
    *   Instead of simply darkening pixels, simulate light scattering by subtly altering the color and brightness of neighboring pixels.
    *   Implement a “bloom” effect to simulate the scattering of light around bright objects.
*   **Head Tracking Integration:** Integrate head tracking data from the device’s sensors to dynamically adjust the glare correction based on the user’s viewing angle.
*   **Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
Create Sparse Voxel Octree (SVO)
Initialize RGB Camera, Depth Sensor, IMU

// Main Loop
While (Device is Running)
    // Sensor Data Acquisition
    RGB Image = Capture RGB Image
    Depth Map = Capture Depth Map
    Device Orientation = Read IMU Data

    // Light Source Detection
    LightSources = Detect Light Sources (RGB Image, Depth Map)

    // Update SVO
    For Each LightSource
        Update SVO with LightSource Position, Intensity

    // Ray Marching
    For Each Display Pixel
        Ray = Create Ray from Display Pixel
        GlareIntensity = 0
        For Each Voxel Along Ray
            GlareIntensity += Voxel.Intensity
        End For

    // Display Correction
    PixelColor = CalculatePixelColor(GlareIntensity)
    Display PixelColor
End While
```

*   **Output:**  A dynamic, realistic glare effect that improves the user’s visual experience by accurately simulating light interaction within the environment.  The volumetric approach allows for more nuanced glare correction than pixel-level adjustments, creating a more immersive and comfortable viewing experience.
