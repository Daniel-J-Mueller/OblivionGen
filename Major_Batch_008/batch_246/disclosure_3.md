## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** Augment the device's understanding of its acoustic environment not just by *detecting* sounds, but by *composing* a layered representation of the ongoing acoustic scene. This enables proactive audio processing and contextual awareness beyond simple trigger expression detection.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array Configuration:** Utilize a circular or spherical microphone array (minimum 6 microphones) to enable 360-degree sound source localization and beamforming.
*   **Acoustic Feature Extraction:** Extract a broad range of acoustic features from the microphone array data including:
    *   Spectral centroid, bandwidth, roll-off.
    *   Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
    *   Sound Event Detection (SED) probabilities for a large library of sounds (e.g., speech, music, environmental sounds).
    *   Spatial cues – Interaural Time Difference (ITD), Interaural Level Difference (ILD).
    *   Reverberation characteristics (RT60 estimate).
*   **Scene Layer Composition:**  Develop an algorithm to decompose the acoustic scene into distinct “layers” based on the extracted features. Layers represent dominant sound sources or acoustic characteristics. Example layers:
    *   *Speech Layer:* Contains identified speech signals and associated spatial information.
    *   *Music Layer:*  Identifies and isolates music sources.
    *   *Environmental Layer:*  Captures ambient sounds like traffic, HVAC, or background noise.
    *   *Reverberation Layer:* Models the room's acoustic characteristics.
*   **Dynamic Layer Weighting:** Assign dynamic weights to each layer based on its prominence and relevance.  The weighting algorithm should be adaptive, learning over time to prioritize layers based on user behavior and context.  (e.g., during a phone call, the Speech Layer receives higher weight.)
*   **Acoustic Scene Graph:** Represent the composed acoustic scene as a graph data structure. Nodes represent layers, and edges represent relationships between layers (e.g., “Speech Layer is dominant over Environmental Layer”).
*   **Predictive Audio Processing:** Use the Acoustic Scene Graph to predict upcoming audio events and optimize processing accordingly. 
    *   Noise cancellation should focus on layers *not* containing speech.
    *   Beamforming can dynamically adjust to track the location of the speaker.
    *   Audio enhancement algorithms can be tailored to specific layers.
*   **User-Defined Scene Profiles:** Allow users to create and customize scene profiles. For example, a user could create a "Focus" profile that emphasizes speech and suppresses distractions, or a "Relaxation" profile that highlights music and ambient sounds.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Train machine learning models on the Acoustic Scene Graph data to:
    *   Automatically identify and classify acoustic scenes (e.g., "office", "home", "car").
    *   Predict user intent based on the acoustic environment.
    *   Personalize audio processing settings.

**Pseudocode (Layer Weighting Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_layer_weights(acoustic_features, user_profile):
  layer_weights = {}

  // Base weights based on feature prominence
  speech_weight = calculate_speech_prominence(acoustic_features)
  music_weight = calculate_music_prominence(acoustic_features)
  environment_weight = calculate_environment_prominence(acoustic_features)

  layer_weights["Speech"] = speech_weight
  layer_weights["Music"] = music_weight
  layer_weights["Environment"] = environment_weight

  // Apply user profile adjustments
  if user_profile == "Focus":
    layer_weights["Speech"] *= 1.5
    layer_weights["Environment"] *= 0.5
  elif user_profile == "Relaxation":
    layer_weights["Music"] *= 1.5
    layer_weights["Environment"] *= 1.0

  // Normalize weights to sum to 1.0
  total_weight = sum(layer_weights.values())
  for layer in layer_weights:
    layer_weights[layer] /= total_weight

  return layer_weights
