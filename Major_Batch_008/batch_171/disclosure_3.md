## Secure Device Attestation via Blockchain-Anchored Hardware Roots of Trust

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Device incorporates a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) generating a unique, device-specific secret. A secure element (SE) or Trusted Platform Module (TPM) houses the PUF and performs cryptographic operations.
*   **Blockchain:** Permissioned blockchain network managed by the device manufacturer and authorized service providers.  Each device manufacturer controls a node.
*   **Root of Trust Establishment:**
    1.  During manufacturing, the PUF's response is used to derive a cryptographic key.
    2.  A device identity (serial number, MAC address, etc.) and the derived key are registered on the blockchain in a “genesis transaction”. This establishes the initial Root of Trust.
    3.  A digitally signed attestation from the manufacturer (using a private key associated with their blockchain node) is included in the genesis transaction, verifying the hardware’s authenticity.
*   **Runtime Attestation:**
    1.  The device generates a challenge (nonce) from a trusted source (e.g., a remote server).
    2.  The secure element uses the PUF to derive a key, signs the challenge with this key, and transmits the signature.
    3.  The verifying party retrieves the device's genesis transaction from the blockchain, extracting the initial key.
    4.  The verifying party re-computes the expected signature using the initial key and the challenge.
    5.  Comparison of the received and re-computed signatures validates the device's identity and hardware integrity.
*   **Attribute Updates:**
    1.  Authorized service providers can update device attributes (e.g., software version, security policies) by creating new transactions on the blockchain.
    2.  These transactions are digitally signed by the service provider and the manufacturer.
    3.  The device periodically retrieves updated attributes from the blockchain, ensuring it operates with the latest policies.
*   **Revocation:**
    1.  If a device is compromised or decommissioned, its identity is blacklisted on the blockchain.
    2.  Verifying parties check the blockchain before accepting attestations from the device.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Attestation Verification):**

```
function verify_attestation(device_id, signature, challenge):
  // Retrieve genesis transaction from blockchain
  genesis_transaction = blockchain.get_transaction(device_id)

  if genesis_transaction is null:
    return false // Device not registered

  // Extract initial key from genesis transaction
  initial_key = genesis_transaction.get_initial_key()

  // Re-compute expected signature
  expected_signature = crypto.sign(challenge, initial_key)

  // Compare signatures
  if crypto.verify(expected_signature, signature, initial_key):
    return true
  else:
    return false
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond centralized trust models to a distributed, blockchain-based approach for device attestation.  It leverages hardware roots of trust (PUF) and combines them with the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology. This makes it more resistant to spoofing, tampering, and centralized points of failure. The ability to update attributes via blockchain transactions allows for flexible and dynamic policy enforcement.
