## Dynamic Query Expansion via Knowledge Graph Traversal

**Concept:** Augment user verbal queries with related concepts sourced from a dynamically updated knowledge graph, enriching search results beyond simple keyword matching. This addresses ambiguity and uncovers latent user needs.

**Specs:**

1.  **Knowledge Graph Construction:**
    *   Data Sources: Utilize a combination of public knowledge graphs (Wikidata, DBpedia), e-commerce product catalogs, user behavioral data (purchase history, browsing patterns), and social media trends.
    *   Node Types: Define node types for products, features, brands, categories, user preferences, and contextual factors (location, time of day).
    *   Edge Types: Establish relationships between nodes (e.g., “is_a”, “has_feature”, “related_to”, “purchased_with”, “influenced_by”).
    *   Update Frequency: Implement a continuous update mechanism using real-time data streams and periodic graph refreshes.

2.  **Query Interpretation & Graph Traversal:**
    *   Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Employ NLU techniques to extract key entities and intents from the verbal query.
    *   Entity Linking: Link identified entities to corresponding nodes in the knowledge graph.
    *   Intent Classification: Determine the user's primary intent (e.g., purchase, information seeking, comparison).
    *   Graph Traversal Algorithm: Implement a multi-path traversal algorithm to explore related concepts within a defined radius of the initial entity nodes. Explore multiple 'hops' based on edge types relevant to the identified intent. 
    *   Contextual Weighting: Assign weights to graph edges based on contextual factors (user location, time of day, historical preferences).

3.  **Query Expansion & Result Generation:**
    *   Expansion Criteria: Define criteria for selecting expanded query terms based on traversal path length, edge weight, and relevance to the original query.
    *   Hybrid Search: Combine expanded query terms with the original query in a hybrid search algorithm that leverages multiple data repositories (product catalogs, external databases).
    *   Ranking & Filtering: Rank search results based on a combination of relevance scores, product attributes, and user preferences. Apply filtering rules to exclude irrelevant or undesirable products.
    *   Explanation Module: Provide users with explanations for why certain products were recommended, highlighting the expanded query terms and traversal paths that led to their inclusion.

**Pseudocode (Query Expansion):**

```
function expandQuery(verbalQuery, knowledgeGraph, userContext):
  entities = extractEntities(verbalQuery)
  intent = classifyIntent(verbalQuery)
  startNodes = findNodes(entities, knowledgeGraph)
  
  traversalPaths = performMultiPathTraversal(startNodes, knowledgeGraph, intent, userContext, maxDepth=3)
  
  expandedTerms = extractTermsFromPaths(traversalPaths)
  
  combinedQuery = originalQuery + " OR " + expandedTerms
  
  return combinedQuery
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simple keyword expansion by utilizing a dynamic knowledge graph and adaptive traversal algorithms, catering to complex user needs and uncovering previously unknown product options. The explanation module builds user trust and transparency. This creates a more ‘intelligent’ recommendation engine.
