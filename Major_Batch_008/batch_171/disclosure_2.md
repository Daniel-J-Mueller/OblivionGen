## Predictive Log Rotation & Tiered Archival

**Concept:** Instead of reactively deleting logs based on space thresholds, predict log growth and proactively rotate/archive logs based on usage patterns and content analysis. Implement tiered archival based on predicted access frequency and data sensitivity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Analysis Module:**

*   **Data Input:** Raw log data stream, historical log retention statistics (size, age, access frequency), application/service metadata (importance, usage patterns).
*   **Algorithm:** Time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future log volume.  Content analysis using NLP to identify log entries containing critical errors vs. informational messages.  Machine learning model trained on historical access patterns to predict future log access frequency.
*   **Output:** Predicted log volume for the next X hours/days.  Log entry classification (critical, error, warning, info, debug). Predicted access frequency for each log entry category.

**2. Log Rotation & Tiering Engine:**

*   **Rotation Policy:** Dynamically adjusts log rotation frequency based on predicted volume. Logs with high predicted volume rotate more frequently.
*   **Tiered Storage:**
    *   **Tier 1 (Fast Storage - SSD/NVMe):** Recent logs (last X hours/days) with high predicted access frequency. Critical/error logs always reside here.
    *   **Tier 2 (Medium Storage - HDD/Cloud Storage):** Logs older than Tier 1, moderate predicted access frequency.
    *   **Tier 3 (Archive Storage - Glacier/Tape):** Logs older than Tier 2, low predicted access frequency.  Optionally encrypted.
*   **Data Movement:** Automated background process migrates logs between tiers based on predicted access frequency and retention policies.

**3. Smart Deletion Policy:**

*   **Retention Policies:** Configurable retention periods for each log tier.
*   **Deletion Criteria:** Logs exceeding retention periods are deleted. Optionally, a ‘sample’ of logs can be retained for auditing/analysis purposes.  Deletion prioritizes logs with the lowest predicted value (as determined by content and access history).

**Pseudocode (Log Rotation Logic):**

```
function rotate_logs(current_time):
  predicted_volume = PredictiveAnalysisModule.predict_volume(current_time)
  rotation_interval = calculate_rotation_interval(predicted_volume) // Higher volume = shorter interval
  
  logs_to_rotate = LogStorage.get_logs_older_than(rotation_interval)
  
  for log in logs_to_rotate:
    tier = determine_log_tier(log)
    LogStorage.move_log_to_tier(log, tier)
    
  cleanup_deleted_logs()
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Integration with Existing Logging Frameworks:** Support for common logging libraries (Log4j, SLF4J, etc.).
*   **API for Custom Policies:** Allow administrators to define custom rotation and archival policies.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Monitor log patterns for anomalies that might indicate system issues.  (This leverages the historical analysis already present).
*   **Federated Logging:** Ability to aggregate logs from multiple sources into a central repository.
*   **Secure Deletion:** Implement secure deletion mechanisms to ensure data is irretrievable.
