## Adaptive Haptic Zones – Computing Device

**Concept:** Expand the gaze-tracking and power-saving principles to incorporate localized haptic feedback zones on a device’s surface, dynamically adjusting intensity and texture based on gaze direction and predicted user intent. This creates a more intuitive and energy-efficient interface.

**Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Layer:** Integrate a matrix of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar) beneath the device’s primary touch surface (screen, trackpad, casing). Resolution: minimum 100 actuators/square inch. Actuator range: Variable texture simulation (bumps, ridges, smoothness) and variable force (0-500mN).
*   **Gaze Tracking Integration:** Utilize the existing gaze-tracking system (from the source patent) to determine the user’s focal point on the screen or in the surrounding environment.  Accuracy: < 1 degree of visual angle. Update rate: > 60Hz.
*   **Predictive Intent Engine:** Employ a machine learning model trained on user interaction data (touch patterns, gaze patterns, application usage).  This model predicts the user’s likely next action.  Training Data:  Device usage logs, application APIs, user profile information.
*   **Dynamic Zone Mapping:** Divide the device surface into a series of overlapping “haptic zones”. These zones correspond to UI elements (buttons, sliders, scrollbars) or areas of potential interaction.
*   **Haptic Response Profiles:** Define a library of haptic response profiles for different UI elements and interaction types. Examples:
    *   “Button Press”:  Short, sharp pulse.
    *   “Slider Adjustment”:  Varying texture simulating resistance.
    *   “Scrollbar Drag”:  Gentle vibration synchronized with scrolling.
*   **Gaze-Triggered Pre-Activation:** When the user’s gaze dwells on a UI element for a predetermined time (e.g., 200ms), activate the corresponding haptic zone with a subtle texture or vibration. This provides anticipatory feedback and reduces perceived latency.
*   **Intent-Based Haptic Enhancement:** Based on the predictive intent engine, proactively enhance haptic feedback for likely actions. For example, if the user is predicted to tap a button, pre-activate the haptic zone with a more pronounced texture.
*   **Adaptive Power Management:** Dynamically adjust the power consumption of the haptic layer by:
    *   Deactivating haptic zones in areas where the user is not looking.
    *   Reducing the intensity of haptic feedback for less critical UI elements.
    *   Utilizing low-power haptic actuators.
*   **Software API:** Provide a software API for developers to create custom haptic responses and integrate them into their applications.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Include a calibration routine to personalize the haptic feedback based on the user’s preferences and sensitivity.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Zone Management):**

```
// Main Loop

while (device is on) {
  gazeData = getGazeDirection();
  predictedIntent = getPredictedIntent();

  // Determine active haptic zones
  activeZones = determineActiveZones(gazeData, predictedIntent);

  // Update haptic layer
  for each (zone in activeZones) {
    setHapticFeedback(zone, getHapticProfile(zone));
  }

  // Power Management
  deactivateInactiveZones(); // Turns off haptic feedback in zones where the user isn't looking
}

// Function: determineActiveZones(gazeData, predictedIntent)
// Returns a list of haptic zones to activate

function determineActiveZones(gazeData, predictedIntent) {
  activeZones = [];
  // Check for zones within gaze area
  for each (zone in allZones) {
    if (isZoneWithinGazeArea(zone, gazeData)) {
      activeZones.push(zone);
    }
  }

  // Add zones based on predicted intent (e.g. pre-activate button)
  if (predictedIntent != null) {
    if (predictedIntent.action == "tap") {
      activeZones.push(predictedIntent.targetZone);
    }
  }

  return activeZones;
}
