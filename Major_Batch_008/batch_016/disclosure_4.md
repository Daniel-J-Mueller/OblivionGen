## Dynamic Interference Mapping & Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Extend dynamic routing beyond simple signal strength/airtime calculations to incorporate *real-time* interference mapping and *predictive* routing based on learned usage patterns and environmental changes. The system actively builds a "heat map" of interference sources within the wireless environment, and uses this information to preemptively select the optimal communication path *before* congestion impacts performance.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Media Device (Transmitter/Receiver): Existing wireless capabilities (2.4GHz, 5GHz, potentially 6GHz). Additional spectrum analyzer module for passive interference detection.
    *   Tablet Device (Receiver): Existing wireless capabilities.
    *   Network Access Point: Standard AP functionality.
    *   Dedicated "Beacon" Nodes (optional): Low-power devices deployed strategically to aid in interference mapping.  Could be integrated into existing smart home devices.

*   **Software Modules (Media Device):**
    *   **Interference Scanner:** Continuously scans the radio spectrum (2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz) for signals.  Identifies sources of interference (other Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth devices, microwaves, etc.) and estimates their strength and location.  Uses Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) techniques (with multiple antennas) to refine source localization.
    *   **Usage Pattern Learner:** Tracks historical data on communication patterns between the media device and the tablet. Records timestamps, data transfer rates, application types, and the chosen communication path.  Employs machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to predict future communication needs.
    *   **Predictive Routing Engine:** Combines interference map data, usage pattern predictions, and current signal conditions to select the optimal communication path.  Implements a cost function that balances airtime, signal strength, interference levels, and predicted future congestion.
    *   **Dynamic Channel Selection:**  Negotiates channel selection with both the tablet and the access point, leveraging channel bonding and dynamic frequency selection (DFS) to minimize interference.

*   **Software Modules (Tablet Device):**
    *   **Signal Reporter:** Provides the media device with real-time signal strength measurements for all available wireless links.
    *   **Channel Feedback:** Reports channel quality metrics (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, error vector magnitude) to the media device.

*   **Software Modules (Access Point):**
    *   **QoS Policy Enforcement:** Prioritizes traffic based on application type or user preference.
    *   **AP-Assisted Interference Mitigation:**  Provides the media device with information on nearby access points and their channel utilization.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Routing Engine):**

```
function select_route(current_time):
  interference_map = get_interference_map()
  usage_prediction = get_usage_prediction(current_time)
  
  route_costs = {}
  
  # Direct Link (Media Device -> Tablet)
  direct_cost = calculate_cost(
      signal_strength = get_signal_strength(direct_link),
      airtime = calculate_airtime(direct_link),
      interference = interference_map.get_interference(direct_link_frequency),
      predicted_congestion = usage_prediction.get_congestion(direct_link_frequency, current_time)
  )
  route_costs["direct"] = direct_cost
  
  # Indirect Link (Media Device -> AP -> Tablet)
  indirect_cost = calculate_cost(
      signal_strength_device_ap = get_signal_strength(device_ap_link),
      signal_strength_ap_tablet = get_signal_strength(ap_tablet_link),
      airtime_device_ap = calculate_airtime(device_ap_link),
      airtime_ap_tablet = calculate_airtime(ap_tablet_link),
      interference_device_ap = interference_map.get_interference(device_ap_frequency),
      interference_ap_tablet = interference_map.get_interference(ap_tablet_frequency),
      predicted_congestion_device_ap = usage_prediction.get_congestion(device_ap_frequency, current_time),
      predicted_congestion_ap_tablet = usage_prediction.get_congestion(ap_tablet_frequency, current_time)
  )
  route_costs["indirect"] = indirect_cost

  best_route = min(route_costs, key=route_costs.get) # select route with lowest cost
  
  return best_route
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond reactive routing based on *current* conditions to *proactive* routing based on *predicted* conditions, creating a more resilient and efficient wireless experience. The addition of detailed interference mapping provides a richer dataset for optimizing routing decisions. This is not simply airtime/signal strength calculation. It's a full spectrum analysis combined with usage pattern prediction.
