## Dynamic Meeting Space Morphing

**Concept:** Implement physically reconfigurable meeting spaces – rooms that can dynamically alter their size, layout, and functionality based on meeting needs, as determined by the scheduling system. This goes beyond simply booking a room; it actively *changes* the room.

**Specs:**

*   **Modular Room Components:** Walls, floors, ceilings, furniture (tables, chairs, displays) are constructed from lightweight, modular components. These components are robotically actuated.
*   **Robotic Actuation System:**  A network of ceiling-mounted and floor-based robots (small, agile, and capable of lifting/manipulating modular components) controlled by the scheduling system.  Robots operate safely around people.
*   **Sensor Network:**  Real-time monitoring of room occupancy via cameras/sensors. This data informs robot operation and ensures safety.
*   **Scheduling System Integration:** The existing scheduling system (as described in the patent) is extended to include:
    *   **Room Morphing Profiles:** Predefined configurations for different meeting types (e.g., "small huddle," "large presentation," "workshop with breakout groups").  Users select a profile when booking.
    *   **Morphing Time Buffer:**  A buffer added to meeting schedules to allow time for the room to morph between configurations.
    *   **Collision Avoidance:**  Real-time collision avoidance algorithms to prevent robots from interfering with meeting participants.
*   **User Interface Extension:**  A UI element allowing users to preview the room configuration before booking.
*   **Power & Data Distribution:** Wireless power and data distribution to modular components.

**Pseudocode (Scheduling System Integration):**

```
function scheduleMeeting(request):
  room = findAvailableRoom(request.time, request.attributes)
  if room == null:
    return "No rooms available"

  morphingProfile = request.morphingProfile //User selection, or default
  morphingTime = getMorphingTime(morphingProfile)

  startTime = request.time.start
  endTime = request.time.end

  //Check for overlap with morphing time
  if (meeting overlaps with morphing time):
    return "Scheduling conflict - morphing time required"

  //Send morph request to robotic actuation system
  sendMorphRequest(room, morphingProfile, startTime - morphingTime)

  //Update room availability schedule
  updateRoomSchedule(room, startTime, endTime)

  return "Meeting scheduled successfully"
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Soundproofing:** Modular wall components designed for soundproofing.
*   **Lighting:** Modular lighting systems integrated into ceiling components.
*   **Acoustics:**  Adaptive acoustic panels to optimize sound quality in different configurations.
*   **Safety Protocols:**  Robust safety protocols to prevent accidents during room morphing.  Emergency stop mechanisms.
*   **AI Optimization:** Employ an AI to learn optimal room configurations based on meeting data and user feedback.  Predictive morphing – pre-morphing rooms based on upcoming schedules.
