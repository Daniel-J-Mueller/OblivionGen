## Dynamic Persona Blending & Predictive Habit Stacking

**Core Concept:** Extend the multi-persona profile concept by enabling *dynamic* blending of personas based on real-time behavioral data *and* proactively "stacking" predicted future habits into the blended persona for optimized recommendations & automated actions.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Existing User Profile Data (historical data, preferences, recommended products – as per patent).
    *   Real-Time Behavioral Data: Location (precise & movement patterns), App/Web Activity, Device Sensor Data (accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light, microphone – with explicit user consent & privacy controls), Purchase History, Social Media Interactions (optional, with consent).
    *   External Data Sources: Weather, Traffic, Local Events, News Feeds (optional, with consent).
*   **Persona Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   A Bayesian Network or similar probabilistic model dynamically assigns weights to each persona based on real-time data.
    *   Example: User is at a gym (location) -> "Fitness Enthusiast" persona weight increases. User is browsing work-related websites (app activity) -> "Professional" persona weight increases.
    *   Algorithm incorporates a “decay” factor – if behavior deviates from a persona for a period, the weight decreases.
*   **Habit Prediction Engine:**
    *   A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on user's historical data to predict likely future actions/habits.
    *   Considers time-of-day, location, day-of-week, and recent behavior.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over potential future actions (e.g., "likely to order coffee in 30 minutes," "likely to start a workout within the hour," "likely to browse travel websites tonight").
*   **Proactive Persona Augmentation:**
    *   The predicted habits (with associated probabilities) are *temporarily* incorporated into the blended persona, influencing recommendations & automated actions.
    *   Example: If the engine predicts a high probability of coffee purchase, the "Coffee Lover" persona gains temporary weight. System proactively suggests nearby coffee shops, displays loyalty rewards, or initiates a mobile order.
*   **Automated Action Triggers:**
    *   Based on the blended persona and predicted habits, automated actions can be triggered (with explicit user control & opt-in).
    *   Example: Adjust smart home settings (lighting, temperature) based on predicted activity. Play music tailored to predicted mood. Suggest relevant content.
*   **User Control & Transparency:**
    *   Users have full visibility into the blended persona weights & predicted habits.
    *   Users can manually adjust persona weights or override predicted actions.
    *   Detailed privacy controls to manage data sharing & consent.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialize User Profiles (as per patent)
profiles = [fitness, professional, foodie, traveler]

// Real-time Data Input
location = get_location()
activity = get_app_activity()

// Calculate Persona Weights (Bayesian Network)
weights = calculate_persona_weights(profiles, location, activity)

// Predict Future Habits (RNN)
predicted_habits = predict_habits(user_history, weights, location, activity)

// Augment Persona Weights with Predicted Habits
augmented_weights = blend_weights(weights, predicted_habits)

// Generate Recommendations & Trigger Actions
recommendations = generate_recommendations(augmented_weights)
actions = trigger_actions(augmented_weights)

// Display Recommendations & Execute Actions
display_recommendations(recommendations)
execute_actions(actions)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Social Persona Blending:** Incorporate data from social connections (with consent) to create blended personas that reflect shared interests.
*   **Contextual Persona Priming:**  Use external data (weather, events) to proactively prime personas.
*   **Adaptive Habit Stacking:** Continuously refine the habit prediction engine based on user feedback & behavior.
