## Adaptive Interference Cancellation via Phased Array Beamforming

**Concept:** Extend the transmit power throttling concept by actively *cancelling* interference on the lower priority connection through phased array beamforming, rather than simply reducing power. This allows maintaining data rates on the lower priority link while minimizing impact on the higher priority link, creating a more robust and efficient multi-radio environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Antenna System:** User device must incorporate at least two antennas â€“ one dedicated to the higher priority connection and one to the lower priority connection, though ideally a phased array with 4+ elements for both.
*   **High-Speed Processor:** Dedicated processing capability (DSP, FPGA, or a dedicated core on the main processor) for real-time signal processing. Minimum 1GHz clock speed.
*   **RF Front-End:**  RF components (mixers, amplifiers, filters) capable of operating across the frequency bands of both wireless connections simultaneously.
*   **ADC/DAC:** High-resolution (12-bit or greater) analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters to handle the signal processing.

**2. Software/Algorithm Requirements:**

*   **Interference Detection:** Algorithm to identify interference from the higher priority connection impacting the lower priority connection. This will likely require spectrum analysis and signal strength measurements.
*   **Beamforming Weight Calculation:**  Algorithm to dynamically calculate beamforming weights for the phased array antennas on the lower priority connection. The weights are adjusted to null out the interference signal from the higher priority connection. This should account for:
    *   Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation of the interfering signal.
    *   Signal strength of the interfering signal.
    *   Desired signal direction for the lower priority connection.
*   **Real-time Signal Processing Pipeline:** Implementation of the beamforming algorithm in real-time. This should minimize latency to ensure effective interference cancellation.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Incorporate a learning algorithm (e.g., Least Mean Squares) to continuously refine the beamforming weights based on observed interference levels.
*   **Prioritization Logic:** Maintain the existing application-based prioritization from the patent, informing the beamforming algorithm about which connection requires more resources.
*   **Power Control Feedback:**  Implement a feedback loop to adjust transmit power on both connections based on beamforming performance. If beamforming is effective, transmit power on the lower priority connection can be increased.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Define priority_connection (e.g., cellular)
Define lower_priority_connection (e.g., Wi-Fi)
Initialize phased array antennas for both connections

// Main Loop
While (device active) {
    // 1. Detect Interference
    interference_level = measure_interference(lower_priority_connection, priority_connection)

    // 2. If Interference Exceeds Threshold
    if (interference_level > threshold) {
        // 3. Calculate Beamforming Weights
        weights = calculate_beamforming_weights(interference_source_angle, desired_signal_direction)

        // 4. Apply Beamforming
        apply_beamforming(weights, lower_priority_connection)
    } else {
        // 5. No Interference - use default transmit power
        set_transmit_power(lower_priority_connection, default_power)
    }

    // 6. Monitor Signal Quality & Adjust
    signal_quality = measure_signal_quality(lower_priority_connection)
    if (signal_quality < acceptable_level) {
        increase_transmit_power(lower_priority_connection, incremental_power)
    }

    // 7. Application Priority Check
    priority_level = get_application_priority()
    if (priority_level == HIGH) {
        //Prioritize higher priority connection
    }

}
```

**4.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Multi-User Interference Mitigation:** Extend the algorithm to cancel interference from multiple sources.
*   **Cooperative Beamforming:** Coordinate beamforming with other nearby devices to further improve interference cancellation.
*   **Dynamic Antenna Selection:**  Dynamically select the optimal antennas for each connection based on signal conditions.
