## Dynamic Data Store Operation Composition via Orchestration Graphs

**Specification:**

This system extends the concept of function objects to allow for *composed* data store operations, orchestrated via a directed graph. Instead of a single function object extending a native operation, a user can define a *sequence* of function objects, potentially branching and merging, to create a complex data transformation pipeline.

**Components:**

*   **Orchestration Graph Definition Language (OGDL):** A declarative language to define the orchestration graph.  OGDL nodes represent either native data store operations *or* user-defined function objects. Edges represent data flow. Nodes can have input and output schemas defined.
*   **Graph Compiler:**  A service that takes an OGDL definition and compiles it into an executable orchestration plan. This plan determines the execution order, data routing, and resource allocation.
*   **Orchestration Engine:** The runtime component responsible for executing the orchestration plan. It manages the execution of individual nodes, handles data transfer, and manages state.
*   **Function Object Repository:** A store for user-defined function objects, analogous to the existing system.  Function objects are versioned.
*   **Data Store Adapters:** Adapters to interface with various data store technologies, enabling the orchestration engine to execute native operations on different systems.

**Workflow:**

1.  A user defines an orchestration graph using OGDL, specifying the desired data transformation pipeline. The graph specifies input data, data flow, function objects and native operations.
2.  The user submits the OGDL definition to the Graph Compiler.
3.  The Graph Compiler validates the OGDL definition, resolves dependencies, and generates an orchestration plan.  The plan includes resource allocation (e.g., computing nodes) and data routing information.
4.  The orchestration plan is submitted to the Orchestration Engine.
5.  The Orchestration Engine executes the plan, invoking function objects and native data store operations as needed.
6.  Data flows between nodes according to the orchestration plan.
7.  The Orchestration Engine returns the final result to the user.

**Pseudocode (OGDL example):**

```ogdl
graph "Customer Enrichment" {
  input "customer_id" (type: string);

  node "Get Customer Data" (operation: "read_customer", data_store: "mysql_db") {
    input "customer_id";
    output "customer_record";
  }

  node "Geolocate IP" (function: "ip_to_geo", version: "1.2") {
    input "ip_address";
    output "location";
  }

  node "Get Weather" (function: "get_weather", version: "2.0") {
    input "latitude", "longitude";
    output "weather_data";
  }

  node "Enrich Customer Record" (function: "enrich_record", version: "1.0") {
    input "customer_record", "location", "weather_data";
    output "enriched_record";
  }

  edge "Get Customer Data" -> "Enrich Customer Record";
  edge "Geolocate IP" -> "Enrich Customer Record";
  edge "Get Weather" -> "Enrich Customer Record";

  #IP is derived from Customer Record
  edge "Get Customer Data" -> "Geolocate IP";
  #Latitude/Longitude are derived from Geolocate IP
  edge "Geolocate IP" -> "Get Weather";
}
```

**Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   The Orchestration Engine can be distributed across multiple computing nodes.
*   Each node in the orchestration graph can be executed on a separate computing node.
*   The system supports automatic retries and fault tolerance mechanisms.  Failed nodes can be automatically restarted or re-routed.

**Benefits:**

*   **Increased Flexibility:**  Allows users to create complex data transformation pipelines without writing code.
*   **Improved Reusability:** Function objects can be reused across multiple orchestration graphs.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:**  The distributed architecture enables horizontal scaling.
*   **Simplified Maintenance:** Changes to data transformation logic can be made without modifying the underlying data store.
