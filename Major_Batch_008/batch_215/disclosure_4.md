## Dynamic Color Mood Generation & Projection

**Concept:** Extend color name/palette association beyond static image analysis to *proactive* environmental mood shaping via projected light. The system would analyze image content *and* contextual data (time of day, weather, user biometrics) to dynamically generate not just color *names*, but color palettes designed to evoke specific moods, then project those palettes onto surrounding surfaces.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensor Suite:**
   *   High-resolution camera (existing in patent)
   *   Ambient light sensor
   *   Microphone (audio analysis for contextual cues - e.g., music genre)
   *   Optional: Wearable biometric sensor integration (heart rate, skin conductance - for personalized mood mapping)

**2. Core Processing Unit:**
   *   **Image Analysis Module:** (existing patent functionality - color palette generation)
   *   **Contextual Data Integration Module:**  Processes input from ambient light, microphone, biometric sensors.  Assigns weighting factors to each data point.  (e.g., rainy day = higher weighting for blues/greys; upbeat music = higher weighting for warmer tones).
   *   **Mood Mapping Engine:** A database linking contextual data combinations to pre-defined "mood profiles" (e.g., “Relaxation,” “Focus,” “Energy,” “Romance”). Each mood profile contains a target color palette *range* – not a fixed palette.
   *   **Dynamic Palette Generator:**  Combines the image-derived palette with the mood-profile target range.  Utilizes AI to intelligently blend the palettes, prioritizing colors that align with *both* the image content and the desired mood.  Generates a final, nuanced palette for projection.
   *   **Projection Control Module:** Manages the projection system (described below). Adjusts color intensity, hue, and saturation in real-time based on the dynamic palette.

**3. Projection System:**
   *   Multiple low-profile, wide-angle projectors (integrated into room fixtures or furniture).
   *   Projectors utilize adaptive projection mapping to account for surface textures and angles.
   *   Automated calibration system to ensure seamless color blending across surfaces.
   *   Optional: Integration with smart lighting systems (Hue, etc.) for complementary illumination.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Palette Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateDynamicPalette(image, ambient_light, audio, biometric_data)

  // 1. Extract initial palette from image (existing patent functionality)
  initial_palette = AnalyzeImage(image)

  // 2. Determine dominant mood based on contextual data
  mood = DetermineMood(ambient_light, audio, biometric_data)

  // 3. Retrieve target color range for the determined mood
  target_range = GetMoodColorRange(mood)

  // 4. Blend initial palette with target color range using AI (e.g., generative adversarial network)
  //    - The AI is trained on a dataset of images, moods, and preferred color combinations.
  //    - The AI adjusts the initial palette to align with the target range, prioritizing colors
  //      that are both visually appealing and emotionally appropriate.
  dynamic_palette = BlendPalettes(initial_palette, target_range, AI_Model)

  // 5. Return the dynamic palette
  RETURN dynamic_palette

END FUNCTION
```

**Innovation:**

This system goes beyond simple color identification and naming. It *actively shapes* the user’s environment to evoke specific emotional responses, creating a truly immersive and personalized experience.  The AI-powered palette blending ensures that the generated colors are both aesthetically pleasing and emotionally resonant, going beyond simple mood lighting and offering a dynamic, context-aware environmental experience. The biometrics feed allows for hyper-personalization, adapting the environmental experience to the user’s real-time physiological state.
