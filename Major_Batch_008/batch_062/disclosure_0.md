## Dynamic Entropy Sharding with Predictive Pre-Deletion

**Concept:** Extend the existing tiered storage and key management system by introducing a dynamic sharding scheme based on data entropy and predictive pre-deletion based on usage patterns.  Instead of fixed tiers, data is sharded across storage mediums (Flash, HDD, Optical) *and* potentially ephemeral, ultra-fast storage (e.g., persistent memory) based on a calculated 'entropy score' representing the complexity and uniqueness of the data.  This is coupled with a predictive pre-deletion system that identifies and removes redundant or low-value shards *before* a formal deletion request.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:** Data block (variable size, configurable).
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate Shannon entropy (or similar complexity metric) for the data block.
    *   Consider data type – images, text, video, etc. – and apply weighting factors to the entropy calculation to prioritize more complex data.
    *   Output: Entropy Score (floating-point value).

**2. Dynamic Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Entropy Score, Storage Medium Capabilities (latency, cost, capacity), Usage Frequency (historical data).
*   **Process:**
    *   Establish a mapping table defining storage medium allocation based on entropy thresholds.  (Example: Entropy < 0.5 -> HDD, 0.5 < Entropy < 0.8 -> Flash, Entropy > 0.8 -> Persistent Memory/High-Performance Flash).
    *   Shard the data block into multiple segments.
    *   Allocate each segment to a storage medium based on the mapping table and storage availability.
    *   Record shard location and metadata (shard ID, storage medium, entropy score) in the index.

**3. Predictive Pre-Deletion Engine:**

*   **Input:** Access logs, Usage patterns, Data retention policies, Redundancy levels (number of shards).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze access logs to identify data blocks that haven’t been accessed within a configurable timeframe.
    *   Identify redundant shards – shards containing identical data based on checksum or content comparison.
    *   Apply data retention policies to determine if data is eligible for deletion.
    *   Prioritize deletion of low-entropy, redundant shards.
    *   Initiate asynchronous deletion of eligible shards. *Important: Do not immediately remove metadata, mark for eventual consistency.*

**4. Index Modifications:**

*   The existing index needs to be extended to include:
    *   Shard ID
    *   Storage Medium Location
    *   Entropy Score
    *   Redundancy Level (number of identical shards)
    *   Deletion Flag (used for marking shards for asynchronous deletion).

**5. Key Management Adaptations:**

*   Each shard receives a unique encryption key.
*   The index stores the mapping between shard ID and encryption key.
*   Deletion flag removal triggers key invalidation *after* shard removal is confirmed.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Pre-Deletion Engine):**

```
function PredictivePreDeletion() {
  accessLogs = GetAccessLogs();
  retentionPolicies = GetRetentionPolicies();
  redundancyThreshold = 3; //Configurable

  for each dataBlock in dataStore {
    if (dataBlock.lastAccessed > retentionPolicies.maxAge) {
      for each shard in dataBlock.shards {
        if (shard.redundancyCount > redundancyThreshold) {
          shard.deletionFlag = true;
          shard.redundancyCount--; //Decrement redundancy
          LogDeletionRequest(shard.id);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

function LogDeletionRequest(shardId) {
  // Asynchronous task to physically delete the shard
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Optimized Storage Utilization:**  Dynamically allocate storage based on data complexity and usage.
*   **Improved Performance:**  Store frequently accessed, high-entropy data on faster storage mediums.
*   **Reduced Storage Costs:** Proactively remove redundant and unused data.
*   **Enhanced Data Security:** More granular key management per shard.
