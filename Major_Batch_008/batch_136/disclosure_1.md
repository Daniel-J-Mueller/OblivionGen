## Proximity-Based Collaborative Task Assignment

**Concept:** Expand the “crossing paths” notification system into a proactive task assignment platform leveraging real-time proximity data. Instead of *just* notifying users they are near contacts, the system actively suggests or facilitates collaborative tasks based on shared skills, needs, and schedules.

**Specifications:**

*   **Skill/Need Profiles:** Users define skill sets (e.g., “photography”, “plumbing”, “language - Spanish”) *and* needs (e.g., “need help moving furniture”, “looking for a Spanish conversation partner”, “need a photographer for an event”).
*   **Task Creation/Request:** Users can post “Tasks” – requests for help requiring specific skills.  Tasks include location (geofenced), time window, skill requirements, and an optional “reward” (monetary or reciprocal).
*   **Proximity-Triggered Matching:**  When users are within a defined radius of each other (adjustable by the user), the system searches for skill/need overlaps.
*   **Automated Suggestion/Notification:**
    *   If User A needs a skill User B possesses, User A receives a notification: “User B is nearby and has the skills to help with your task: [Task Name].  Would you like to connect?”
    *   If User B has a skill that matches a nearby user's need, User B receives a notification: “User A nearby needs help with [Task Name]. You have the required skills.  Accept to connect?”
*   **Dynamic Scheduling:**  Integration with user calendars to suggest mutually available times for task completion. The system proposes meeting times *before* connection is established.
*   **Reputation System:** Ratings and reviews for completed tasks, fostering trust and encouraging quality work.
*   **Geofencing & Safety Features:** Optional safety features, such as location sharing with trusted contacts during task completion.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION find_potential_matches(user_location, user_skills, user_needs, radius):
  nearby_users = find_users_within_radius(user_location, radius)

  potential_matches = []

  FOR each nearby_user IN nearby_users:
    IF nearby_user.skills CONTAINS ANY OF user_needs:
      potential_matches.append(nearby_user)
    ENDIF

    IF user_skills CONTAINS ANY OF nearby_user.needs:
      potential_matches.append(nearby_user)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  RETURN potential_matches
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION suggest_task_collaboration(user, potential_match, task):
  IF user.needs CONTAINS task.required_skill AND potential_match.skills CONTAINS task.required_skill:
    SEND notification to user: "Potential match nearby for task: [Task Name]. User: [Potential Match Name] has the skills."
    SEND notification to potential_match: "User [User Name] needs help with [Task Name] and you have the required skills."
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

```

**Data Structures:**

*   `User`: {`user_id`, `location`, `skills` (list), `needs` (list), `calendar`, `reputation` }
*   `Task`: {`task_id`, `creator_id`, `location`, `required_skill`, `time_window`, `reward` }
