## Adaptive Computational Layer Re-Mapping

**Concept:** Dynamically re-map computational layers to different physical memory locations based on detected soft error rates. The goal is to isolate and mitigate the impact of failing memory regions by shifting computations away from them, rather than halting or simply flagging errors.

**Specs:**

*   **Error Rate Monitoring:** Hardware-level counters track soft error occurrences per memory bank/region. These counters are integrated within the memory controller.
*   **Layer Dependency Graph:** A data structure maintained by the system representing the dependencies between computational layers. This graph is populated during program initialization/compilation. Nodes are layers, edges represent data flow.
*   **Re-Mapping Engine:** A dedicated hardware block or firmware module responsible for analyzing error rates and re-mapping layers.
*   **Dynamic Layer Migration:** The ability to migrate a computational layer's data and execution context to a new memory location *without* halting the entire computation. This requires careful management of data dependencies and pointers.
*   **Confidence Level Adjustment:** Integrate error rate data and layer migration history into the confidence level calculation. Layers executed in regions with high error rates, even after migration, contribute to a lower confidence score.

**Pseudocode (Re-Mapping Engine):**

```
function remap_layers(error_rate_data, layer_dependency_graph):
  // error_rate_data: Array of error rates per memory bank
  // layer_dependency_graph: Graph representing layer dependencies

  for each memory_bank in error_rate_data:
    if memory_bank.error_rate > threshold:
      // Identify layers currently mapped to this bank
      layers_to_move = find_layers_in_bank(memory_bank)

      for each layer in layers_to_move:
        // Find a suitable replacement bank with low error rate
        replacement_bank = find_best_replacement_bank(layer.memory_requirements)

        if replacement_bank != null:
          // Migrate layer to replacement_bank
          migrate_layer(layer, replacement_bank)

          // Update layer dependency graph with new location
          update_dependency_graph(layer, replacement_bank)

          // Log migration event for confidence level calculation
          log_migration(layer, replacement_bank)
        else:
          // Unable to find replacement bank - flag layer for reduced confidence
          reduce_confidence(layer)
```

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Memory Controller with Error Rate Counters:** Integrated within the memory controller to provide real-time error rate data.
*   **Re-Mapping Engine:** A dedicated hardware block, potentially implemented as an FPGA module, for fast layer migration.
*   **Dependency Graph Accelerator:** Hardware support for efficient traversal and update of the layer dependency graph.

**Software Components:**

*   **Layer Dependency Graph Builder:** Tool to generate the layer dependency graph from program binaries.
*   **Migration Manager:** Firmware module to coordinate layer migration and data transfer.
*   **Confidence Level Calculator:** Algorithm to integrate error rate data, migration history, and other factors into the confidence level calculation.
