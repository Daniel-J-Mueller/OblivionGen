## Dynamic Workspace Persona Integration

**Concept:** Extend the controller device's awareness beyond peripheral configuration to encompass user “personas” and dynamically adjust workspace environments to suit those personas. This goes beyond simple user credentials; it’s about inferring *intent* and proactively shaping the workspace.

**Specs:**

1.  **Persona Profiles:**
    *   Data Structure: JSON format, containing:
        *   `persona_id`: Unique identifier (UUID).
        *   `name`: Human-readable persona name (e.g., “Focused Work”, “Creative Brainstorm”, “Presentation Mode”).
        *   `peripheral_presets`: Dictionary mapping peripheral IDs to desired configurations (brightness, volume, display settings, application launches, etc.).
        *   `environmental_controls`: Dictionary of desired environmental settings (lighting color/intensity, temperature, soundscape, even robotic arm/device positioning - see #4).
        *   `trigger_conditions`: Array of conditions that activate this persona (time of day, calendar events, detected activity - see #2).
        *   `priority`: Integer representing the persona’s priority (higher values override lower ones).

2.  **Contextual Awareness Engine:**
    *   Input Sources:
        *   User Calendar (via API integration – Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.).
        *   User Activity (via webcam/microphone analysis – identifying focus, collaboration, presentation).  AI module to interpret activity.
        *   Time of Day/Location (GPS data if available).
        *   Manual User Selection (via app/interface).
    *   Logic: Rule-based engine that evaluates incoming data against `trigger_conditions` in persona profiles.  Algorithm prioritizes and selects the most applicable persona.  Thresholds can be set to avoid rapid switching.

3.  **Dynamic Peripheral Control:**
    *   Controller Device Modification: Extend existing configuration storage to include persona-specific settings for each peripheral.
    *   Configuration Application: When a persona is activated, the controller device applies the corresponding settings to each peripheral, overriding any manual user adjustments (with optional user override functionality).
    *   Peripheral Communication: Utilizing existing communication channels (WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee), the controller sends configuration commands to peripherals.

4.  **Robotic/Automated Device Integration:**
    *   API Interface: Define a standardized API for controlling robotic arms, automated blinds, smart furniture, etc.
    *   Environmental Control Mapping:  Link `environmental_controls` in persona profiles to API commands for robotic devices (e.g., “Presentation Mode” – robotic arm positions projector, adjusts lighting).
    *   Safety Protocols: Implement robust safety checks and override mechanisms to prevent accidents.

**Pseudocode (Persona Activation):**

```
function activate_persona(persona_id, user_id):
  persona = get_persona_profile(persona_id)
  user_data = get_user_context(user_id)

  //Apply configuration adjustments to peripherals
  for each peripheral in user_data.peripherals:
    if peripheral.configuration in persona.peripheral_presets:
      apply_configuration(peripheral, persona.peripheral_presets[peripheral.id])

  // Apply environmental changes to automation devices
  for each device in user_data.automation_devices:
    if device.setting in persona.environmental_controls:
      send_command(device, persona.environmental_controls[device.setting])
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** User data collection must be transparent and adhere to privacy regulations.
*   **Scalability:** System should support a large number of users, personas, and peripherals.
*   **Security:** Protect against unauthorized access and modification of persona profiles.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Employ machine learning to personalize personas based on user behavior and preferences over time.
