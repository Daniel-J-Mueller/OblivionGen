## Dynamic Privacy Zones & Predictive Consent

**Concept:** Expand the consent mechanism beyond simple area/time approval to include *predictive* privacy zones and layered consent, allowing users to define dynamic zones where data sharing is automatically adjusted based on context and predicted activity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Inputs:**

*   **Location Data:** Continuous GPS/location data from the electronic device.
*   **Activity Recognition:** Utilize device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone) and onboard AI/ML to recognize user activities (walking, driving, stationary, meeting, sleeping).
*   **Calendar Integration:** Optional access to user calendar to understand scheduled events (meetings, appointments).
*   **Environmental Data:** Access to external data sources (weather, traffic) to understand environmental context.

**2. Dynamic Privacy Zone Definition:**

*   **User Interface:** An app allows users to define ‘Privacy Zones’ which are *not* simple geographical boundaries. Zones are defined by:
    *   **Activity:** E.g., “When I’m in a ‘Meeting’ activity.”
    *   **Context:** E.g., "When it's raining and I'm walking".
    *   **Location:** (Optional) Traditional geographical boundary as a fallback/constraint.
    *   **Temporal Parameters:** Time of day, day of the week.
*   **Zone Behaviors:**  For each zone, the user defines a sharing behavior:
    *   **Full Block:** No data shared.
    *   **Reduced Resolution:** Image/video data is downsampled or anonymized.
    *   **Metadata Only:** Only metadata (timestamp, location, activity type) is shared.
    *   **Conditional Share:** Data shared *only* with pre-approved parties.
    *   **Automatic Consent Override:**  A specific preset behavior takes effect (e.g. always share with emergency services).

**3. Predictive Consent Engine:**

*   **AI Model:**  A trained machine learning model predicts the user’s likely activity and location *before* the event happens. This prediction is based on historical data, calendar events, and real-time sensor inputs.
*   **Consent Application:**  Based on the predicted activity/location, the system applies the appropriate privacy zone behavior *before* data is captured.  This preemptively adjusts data sharing settings.
*   **Transparency & Override:**  The user receives notifications about predicted privacy zone applications and has the ability to manually override them.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **On-Device Processing:**  Initial activity recognition and prediction performed on the device to minimize latency and preserve privacy.
*   **Cloud Synchronization:**  Privacy zone definitions and historical data synchronized to the cloud for model training and improved prediction accuracy.
*   **API Integration:**  Open API allows integration with third-party applications and services.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Device startup
LoadPrivacyZones()

// Main Loop
while(true) {
  GetCurrentLocation()
  GetActivity()
  GetCalendarEvents()

  PredictedActivity = PredictActivity(HistoricalData, CurrentLocation, Activity, CalendarEvents)
  ApplicablePrivacyZone = FindApplicablePrivacyZone(PredictedActivity, CurrentLocation)

  If (ApplicablePrivacyZone != null) {
    ApplyPrivacyZoneSettings(ApplicablePrivacyZone)
  }

  CaptureData() // Image/video/sensor data
  SendData() // Send data according to privacy zone settings
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond static consent to a proactive, predictive system. By anticipating user activities and automatically adjusting data sharing settings, it enhances privacy *before* data is captured, not just after a request is made. This also allows for a granular, context-aware approach to privacy, going beyond simple location/time-based restrictions.
