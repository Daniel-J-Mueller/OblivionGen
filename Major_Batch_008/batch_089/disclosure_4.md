## Adaptive Message Decay & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the 'time-sensitive message data' aspect. Instead of *just* updating data at a specific point, introduce a system where message data intrinsically *decays* based on its age and predicted relevance, triggering automatic, tiered reconstruction requests.

**Specifications:**

*   **Message Structure Enhancement:** Each message includes:
    *   `data`: The core message payload.
    *   `decay_function`:  A function (serialized or identified by ID) defining how data accuracy degrades over time.  Examples: linear decay, exponential decay, step-function decay.
    *   `reconstruction_tiers`: A list of prioritized data source requests. Each tier contains:
        *   `source_id`: Identifier of the external data source.
        *   `reconstruction_cost`:  A numerical value representing the 'cost' (latency, bandwidth, computational effort) of requesting data from this source.
        *    `quality_threshold`: A minimum acceptable accuracy level for reconstructed data.
*   **Broker Modifications:**
    *   **Age Tracking:** Broker tracks the 'age' of each message since it entered the queue.
    *   **Decay Application:** Broker periodically applies the `decay_function` to the message `data`, reducing its accuracy score.
    *   **Reconstruction Trigger:** When the accuracy score falls below a pre-defined threshold *or* a message reaches the front of the queue, reconstruction is initiated.
    *   **Tiered Reconstruction Logic:**
        1.  Broker iterates through `reconstruction_tiers` in priority order.
        2.  For each tier, it checks if the source is available and if requesting data would meet the `quality_threshold`.
        3.  If a suitable source is found, a data request is issued.
        4.  If all tiers fail, the message is published with its decayed data and a flag indicating low accuracy.
*   **Data Source Interface:**  Data sources must support a ‘request’ API with parameters for requested data and accuracy requirements.
*   **Caching Optimization:**  Cache reconstructed data associated with specific decay functions and data sources for reuse, reducing reconstruction costs.

**Pseudocode (Broker Side – Reconstruction Trigger):**

```
function reconstruct_message(message):
    accuracy = calculate_current_accuracy(message.data, message.age, message.decay_function)

    if accuracy < MINIMUM_ACCEPTABLE_ACCURACY:
        for tier in message.reconstruction_tiers:
            try:
                updated_data = request_data_from_source(tier.source_id, message.data, tier.quality_threshold)
                message.data = updated_data
                break  # Stop after successful reconstruction
            except DataSourceUnavailableError:
                continue # Try next tier
        
        if message.data is still decayed:
            set_low_accuracy_flag(message)
    
    return message
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Real-time IoT Sensor Data:** Reconstruct sensor readings based on predicted drift, using less frequent, higher-accuracy calibration data.
*   **Financial Market Data:**  Adjust stock prices based on volatility models and historical data, providing more robust information.
*   **Location Tracking:**  Estimate vehicle locations based on movement patterns and infrequent GPS updates.
