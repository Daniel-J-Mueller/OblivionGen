## Dynamic Feature Weighting Based on Session Context

**Specification:** A system for adjusting the relevance of item features in search refinement tools based on real-time user session data and predictive modeling.

**Core Innovation:** This extends the existing dictionary of item features by introducing a dynamic weighting system. Instead of static ranking based solely on query frequency, feature weights are modulated based on inferred user intent *within the current session*. 

**System Components:**

1.  **Session Context Analyzer:** Tracks user behavior during a search session - clicks, dwell time on product pages, additions to cart, past purchases (if available & authorized). This generates a session-specific “intent vector”.
2.  **Predictive Model (Feature Relevance Estimator):** A machine learning model (e.g., a neural network) trained to predict the relevance of each item feature *given* the current session’s intent vector. Training data consists of historical session data paired with user actions (e.g., a user selecting a feature leading to a purchase indicates high relevance).
3.  **Dynamic Feature Weighting Engine:**  Applies the predictive model’s output to adjust the weights of features in the existing dictionary. Higher predicted relevance results in a higher weight.
4.  **Refinement Tool Generator:** Uses weighted features to prioritize and display options in the search refinement tool.  Features with higher weights are presented more prominently.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateRefinementTool(userQuery, sessionData)

  // 1. Get existing feature dictionary
  featureDictionary = GetFeatureDictionary()

  // 2. Analyze session data to create intent vector
  intentVector = AnalyzeSessionData(sessionData)

  // 3. Predict feature relevance scores using the model
  relevanceScores = PredictFeatureRelevance(intentVector)

  // 4. Apply relevance scores as weights to features
  weightedFeatures = ApplyWeights(featureDictionary, relevanceScores)

  // 5. Sort weighted features by weight (descending)

  // 6. Select top N features for display in refinement tool

  // 7. Generate and return refinement tool UI with sorted features

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION PredictFeatureRelevance(intentVector)

  // Load trained machine learning model

  // Input: intentVector
  // Output: Array of relevance scores (one per feature)

  // Use model to predict relevance score for each feature

  RETURN relevanceScores

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ApplyWeights(featureDictionary, relevanceScores)

  // Iterate through feature dictionary
  // For each feature, multiply its existing weight by the corresponding relevance score

  RETURN weightedFeatures

END FUNCTION
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user searches for "running shoes." Initially, features like "cushioning," "stability," and "trail running" are weighted based on overall frequency. However, if the user clicks on several trail running shoes and spends a significant time viewing shoes with waterproof features, the system detects an intent toward trail running in wet conditions. The weights for "waterproof," "aggressive tread," and "ankle support" increase, prioritizing those options in the refinement tool even if they were less frequent overall.
