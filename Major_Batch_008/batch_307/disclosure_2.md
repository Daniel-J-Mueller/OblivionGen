## Dynamic DNS Blackholing via Reputation Scoring

**System Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Reputation Database:** A globally distributed, key-value store. Keys are client IP addresses (or partial IPs). Values are dynamically updated reputation scores ranging from 0-100. Initial score is 70.
*   **Component 2: Real-time Traffic Analyzer:** Monitors DNS query traffic. Captures query IP, requested domain, query timestamp, and response latency.
*   **Component 3: Anomaly Detection Engine:** Employs machine learning (specifically, time-series anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest or ARIMA) to identify unusual DNS query patterns. Patterns include:
    *   High query rate from a single IP.
    *   Queries for newly registered domains (NXDOMAIN checks).
    *   Queries for domains flagged as malicious (threat intelligence feeds).
    *   Sudden spikes in query latency.
*   **Component 4: Reputation Update Engine:** Based on anomaly detection results, updates reputation scores.
    *   Minor anomalies: Decrement score by 1-5.
    *   Moderate anomalies: Decrement score by 6-10.
    *   Severe anomalies (confirmed malicious activity): Blackhole IP (score = 0) for a configurable duration.
*   **Component 5: Dynamic DNS Resolver:**  Intercepts DNS queries. Before resolving, checks the reputation score of the query IP.
    *   Score > 50: Resolve normally.
    *   Score 20-50: Introduce artificial latency (e.g., 100-500ms) to throttle requests.
    *   Score < 20: Redirect to a "sinkhole" server displaying a warning page.
*   **Component 6: Feedback Loop:** Monitors sinkhole server access and user behavior (e.g., clicking through to legitimate sites vs. abandoning the session). Uses this data to refine anomaly detection algorithms and reputation scoring.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic DNS Resolver):**

```
function resolveDNS(query, queryIP):
  reputationScore = getReputationScore(queryIP)

  if reputationScore > 50:
    response = performStandardDNSResolution(query)
    return response

  else if reputationScore >= 20:
    // Introduce artificial latency
    sleep(random(100, 500)) // milliseconds
    response = performStandardDNSResolution(query)
    return response

  else:
    // Redirect to sinkhole
    sinkholeIP = getSinkholeIP()
    response = createDNSResponse(query, sinkholeIP)
    return response
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Client sends DNS query.
2.  Dynamic DNS Resolver intercepts the query.
3.  Resolver retrieves reputation score for client IP.
4.  Based on score, Resolver either resolves normally, adds latency, or redirects to sinkhole.
5.  Anomaly Detection Engine continuously monitors traffic and updates reputation scores.
6.  Feedback Loop refines anomaly detection and scoring.
