## Adaptive Resolution Frequency Mapping for Predictive Maintenance

**Specification:** A system employing frequency distribution analysis, not of direct sensor readings, but of *derivatives* of sensor readings, predicting component failure based on rate-of-change distribution shifts. This moves beyond simple thresholding and statistical anomaly detection.

**Core Concept:** Track not *what* a sensor reads, but *how quickly* itâ€™s changing. Component degradation often manifests as altered rates of change *before* absolute values exceed acceptable limits. 

**System Components:**

1.  **Sensor Array:** Any relevant sensor suite (vibration, temperature, pressure, current, etc.) providing continuous data streams.
2.  **Derivative Engine:** A real-time calculation module computing the first and potentially second derivatives of each sensor reading. Smoothing filters (e.g., Savitzky-Golay) are applied to minimize noise.
3.  **Adaptive Resolution Frequency Mapper (ARFM):** The core innovation. This replaces the static, exponentially-varying ranges of the original patent with dynamically adjusted bins.
    *   **Initial Mapping:**  Starts with a coarse-grained frequency map of derivative values.
    *   **Dynamic Bin Adjustment:**  Continuously monitors the distribution. When a bin experiences a significant shift in frequency (above a threshold), the ARFM *splits* that bin into two finer-grained bins. Conversely, bins with consistently low frequency are merged into broader ranges. This focuses resolution on areas of changing behavior.
    *   **Non-Exponential Binning:** Bins do *not* need to be exponentially spaced. The algorithm can employ any binning strategy (linear, logarithmic, adaptive) based on the data characteristics.
    *   **Rate of Change of Frequency Tracking:**  Monitor the *rate of change* of bin frequencies.  Rapid shifts in frequency distribution indicate accelerating degradation.
4.  **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical data correlating derivative frequency distribution patterns with component failures.  The model ingests the output of the ARFM and provides probabilistic predictions of remaining useful life (RUL).
5.  **Alerting System:** Triggers alerts based on RUL predictions or when significant anomalies are detected in the derivative frequency distributions.

**Pseudocode (ARFM Bin Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
// Input: Stream of derivative values, initial frequency map
// Output: Updated frequency map

function adjust_bins(derivative_stream, frequency_map):
    for each derivative_value in derivative_stream:
        bin_index = find_bin(derivative_value, frequency_map)
        frequency_map[bin_index].count++

    for each bin in frequency_map:
        // Check for significant frequency shift
        if bin.count > threshold:
            // Split bin into two finer-grained bins
            split_bin(bin)
        else if bin.count < low_threshold:
            // Merge bin with neighboring bin
            merge_bin(bin)

    return frequency_map
```

**Novelty:**

*   **Focus on Derivatives:** Shifting the analysis from absolute values to rates of change provides an earlier warning of component degradation.
*   **Dynamic Resolution:**  The adaptive binning algorithm concentrates resolution on areas of changing behavior, improving sensitivity and accuracy.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:**  Training a predictive model on the dynamic frequency distributions enables more accurate RUL predictions.
