## Dynamic Wireless Ecosystem Projection & Negotiation

**Concept:** Expand the user-facing presentation beyond simple ranked lists of plans and devices. Create a projected “wireless ecosystem” visual, representing the user’s data usage patterns *and* potential future needs, then allow dynamic negotiation of service & device features to optimize this projection.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Projection Module:**

*   **Input:** Geographic location, current wireless plan details, self-reported user preferences (device type, features, budget, usage habits), *historical* data usage (if permission granted & available), *predictive* data usage (derived from app usage, location history, and user-defined events – e.g., “I’ll be streaming video during my commute”).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Create a “digital twin” representation of the user’s wireless ecosystem - a time-series graph visualising predicted data consumption across various applications/services (streaming, gaming, video conferencing, social media, etc.).
    *   Model the impact of different network conditions (5G, LTE, Wi-Fi) on the digital twin, highlighting potential bottlenecks or performance degradation.
    *   Project future data needs based on usage trends and user-defined goals (e.g., "I'm planning a road trip and need reliable navigation").
*   **Output:** A dynamic, interactive visual representation of the projected wireless ecosystem, displayed on a user device.

**2. Negotiation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Projected wireless ecosystem data, available service plans & device specs from carriers, user-defined priorities (cost, speed, reliability, battery life).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Identify potential "friction points" in the projected ecosystem (e.g., predicted data consumption exceeding plan limits, slow speeds during critical usage periods).
    *   Generate a range of “negotiation options” – combinations of service plan upgrades, device feature adjustments (e.g., enabling/disabling data-intensive features), and temporary data boosts.
    *   Implement a “what-if” simulator allowing users to experiment with different options and see their impact on the projected ecosystem.
    *   Automate negotiation with carriers on behalf of the user, based on pre-defined rules and user preferences.
*   **Output:** A list of recommended negotiation options, ranked by their potential to optimize the user’s wireless ecosystem.

**3. Dynamic Feature Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:** Selected negotiation option, user device capabilities, current network conditions.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Automatically adjust device settings to optimize performance and data usage (e.g., reduce video resolution, disable background app refresh, switch to a different network band).
    *   Implement a “smart caching” mechanism to proactively download content during off-peak hours.
    *   Provide real-time feedback to the user on data usage and performance.
*   **Output:** A seamless, optimized wireless experience.

**Pseudocode (Negotiation Engine - simplified):**

```
function negotiate(userPreferences, availablePlans, userEcosystemProjection):
  potentialSolutions = []

  for each plan in availablePlans:
    for each device in availableDevices:
      solution = {
        "plan": plan,
        "device": device,
        "cost": plan.cost + device.cost,
        "performanceScore": calculatePerformanceScore(device, plan, userEcosystemProjection),
        "riskScore": calculateRiskScore(plan, userEcosystemProjection)
      }
      potentialSolutions.append(solution)

  #Sort solutions by weighted sum of performance & risk.
  sortedSolutions = sortSolutions(potentialSolutions, userPreferences)

  return sortedSolutions
```

**Novelty:**

This expands beyond merely *presenting* options to actively modeling the user’s wireless “life” and proactively *negotiating* a solution that best fits their needs. It’s about moving from a static comparison to a dynamic optimization process.  It leverages predictive modeling and automated negotiation to enhance user experience and optimize cost.
