## Multi-User Sleep Stage Harmonization System

**Concept:** Extend millimeter wave sleep monitoring beyond individual data capture to a system capable of harmonizing sleep stages across multiple individuals in proximity, facilitating shared dream experiences or coordinated therapeutic interventions.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Millimeter wave emitter/receiver arrays (as in base patent) – *minimum* of 3 per monitored individual. One array directed upwards (detecting movement/respiration during supine positions), one directed downwards (detecting movement/respiration during prone positions), and one directed laterally (detecting subtle body shifts/proximity to other monitored individuals).
    *   High-bandwidth, low-latency communication module (e.g., 60GHz Wi-Fi, UWB) for each device.
    *   Localized processing unit (Raspberry Pi class) per device for pre-processing radar data and establishing a mesh network.
    *   Central processing server with significant computational resources (GPU cluster) for data fusion and stage harmonization.
    *   Optional: Bone conduction headphones integrated into sleep mask for subtle auditory/tactile cues.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Radar Data Processing Pipeline:** Noise filtering, signal amplification, feature extraction (respiration rate, heart rate variability, body movement, sleep posture). Advanced signal processing to identify subtle shifts in body state indicative of REM sleep, deep sleep, etc.
    *   **Sleep Stage Classification Model:** Deep learning model trained on multi-modal sleep data (radar, EEG, EOG – optional integration). Output: Probability distribution across sleep stages (Wake, REM, N1, N2, N3).
    *   **Proximity Detection Algorithm:** Utilizes radar reflections to determine distance and orientation of individuals. Differentiates between static objects and living beings.
    *   **Stage Harmonization Algorithm:** Core innovation.
        1.  **Synchronization:** Aligns sleep stage data across all monitored individuals. Corrects for individual variations in sleep onset/offset. Utilizes a consensus-based approach, weighting stage classifications based on data quality and individual characteristics.
        2.  **Coherence Metric:** Calculates a "sleep coherence" score for each individual pair, representing the degree to which their sleep stages are aligned.
        3.  **Shared Experience Trigger:** When coherence exceeds a defined threshold *and* individuals are in a shared sleep stage (e.g., REM), a "shared experience" is triggered.
        4.  **Stimulus Delivery:** (Optional) Subtle auditory/tactile cues delivered via bone conduction headphones to reinforce shared sleep stage and potentially influence dream content (e.g., introducing a shared theme).
    *   **Data Logging & Analytics:** Stores radar data, sleep stage classifications, coherence metrics, and stimulus delivery logs. Enables analysis of sleep patterns, coherence trends, and the effectiveness of shared experience interventions.

**Pseudocode (Stage Harmonization Algorithm):**

```
function harmonizeSleepStages(individualDataArray):
  synchronizedData = alignSleepStages(individualDataArray)
  for each individual A in synchronizedData:
    for each individual B in synchronizedData (where A != B):
      coherenceScore = calculateCoherence(A.sleepStageProbabilities, B.sleepStageProbabilities)
      if coherenceScore > threshold AND A.sleepStage == B.sleepStage:
        triggerSharedExperience(A, B)
  return synchronizedData
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Couples Therapy:** Facilitate deeper emotional connection by identifying and reinforcing moments of shared sleep experience.
*   **Group Therapy:** Create a shared dream space for individuals with trauma or anxiety.
*   **Lucid Dream Induction:** Utilize coordinated stimulus delivery to increase the likelihood of lucid dreaming.
*   **Sleep Research:** Investigate the neural mechanisms of social sleep and shared dreaming.
*   **Entertainment:** Develop immersive dream experiences for multiple users.
