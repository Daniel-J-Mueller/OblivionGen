## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Service Call Cascades

**Concept:** Extend the weighted resource throttling to *proactively* allocate resources based on predicted service call dependencies – or "cascades". Instead of reacting to resource consumption *during* a call, predict which calls are likely to follow, and pre-allocate resources accordingly. This moves beyond simple throttling to dynamic, anticipatory resource management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Cascade Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Service call metadata (call type, initiating user/system, associated data payload size estimates, historical data of call sequences, time of day, day of week, seasonal effects).
*   **Mechanism:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, Markov model) trained on historical service call data to predict the probability of subsequent service calls given an initial call. The model should be continuously updated with new data. Include a ‘confidence score’ with each prediction.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of likely subsequent service calls, each with a probability score and estimated resource requirements (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O).

**2. Predictive Resource Allocator:**

*   **Input:** Cascade Prediction Engine output, current resource availability, weighted resource consumption data (as in the base patent), configurable prioritization rules (e.g., critical services get priority).
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Based on the predicted cascade and prioritization rules, calculate a “future resource footprint” for the current service call.
    *   Reserve resources for the predicted cascade *before* executing the initial service call.  The amount reserved should be proportional to the predicted resource requirements and the confidence score. Use a tiered reservation system - High confidence = firm reservation, low confidence = soft reservation (can be reclaimed if needed).
    *   Monitor resource utilization during the cascade. If actual utilization differs significantly from the prediction, adjust resource allocation dynamically.
*   **Output:** Resource allocation schedule.

**3.  Resource Reservation Manager:**

*   **Input:** Resource Reservation requests, current resource availability,  resource release notifications.
*   **Mechanism:**  Manages resource reservations and releases.  Implements a system for reclaiming soft reservations if they are not utilized within a specified timeframe.  Provides metrics on reservation success rates and resource utilization efficiency.
*   **Output:** Confirmed/Denied reservation notifications, resource availability status.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Resource Allocator):**

```
function allocate_resources(initial_call) {
  predicted_cascade = cascade_prediction_engine(initial_call)
  future_resource_footprint = calculate_resource_footprint(predicted_cascade)
  
  if (sufficient_resources_available(future_resource_footprint)) {
    reserve_resources(future_resource_footprint)
    execute_initial_call(initial_call)
  } else {
    // Implement queuing/deferral strategy or request resource scaling
    queue_call(initial_call)
  }
}

function calculate_resource_footprint(cascade) {
  footprint = {}
  for each call in cascade {
    footprint.cpu += call.estimated_cpu
    footprint.memory += call.estimated_memory
    footprint.network += call.estimated_network
    //... other resources
  }
  return footprint
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Call Metadata:**  {call_type, user_id, data_size, estimated_cpu, estimated_memory, estimated_network, ...}
*   **Cascade Prediction:**  [ {call_type, probability}, {call_type, probability}, ...]
*   **Resource Footprint:** {cpu: amount, memory: amount, network: amount, ...}
