## Adaptive Keyword Sensitivity Based on Audio Context

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust keyword detection sensitivity *during* audio processing, not just before/after playback, based on analysis of the audioâ€™s semantic content *before* it's outputted. This extends the concept of temporarily disabling detection, to a system which finely tunes detection thresholds.

**Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Semantic Analysis Module (SAM): An AI model (e.g., transformer-based) trained to classify audio segments based on contextual meaning. Categories could include: "Narrative", "Command", "Question", "Music", "Ambient Noise", "Speech-to-Text output".
    *   Keyword Detection Module (KDM): Existing keyword/wakeword detection system.
    *   Sensitivity Adjustment Module (SAM): Receives classifications from SAM and adjusts KDM's sensitivity threshold.
    *   Audio Pipeline: Receives audio input, passes through SAM, KDM, and outputs audio.

*   **Operation:**
    1.  Audio input is received by the Audio Pipeline.
    2.  Before output, segments of audio (e.g. 1-5 seconds) are sent to SAM for semantic analysis.
    3.  SAM classifies the audio segment and provides a classification tag.
    4.  The Sensitivity Adjustment Module maps the classification tag to a sensitivity level for KDM.  Example Mapping:
        *   "Narrative": KDM Sensitivity = Low (Minimize false positives in storytelling)
        *   "Command": KDM Sensitivity = High (Prioritize responsiveness to user requests)
        *   "Question": KDM Sensitivity = Medium-High (Prioritize recognizing question-related keywords)
        *   "Music": KDM Sensitivity = Very Low (Almost completely disable - reduce false positives)
        *   "Speech-to-Text output": KDM Sensitivity = Very Low (reduce false positives - prevent recursive activation)
    5.  KDM operates with the adjusted sensitivity.
    6.  Audio segment is output.
    7.  Repeat steps 2-6 for each segment.

*   **Pseudocode (Sensitivity Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjustSensitivity(classificationTag) {
  switch (classificationTag) {
    case "Narrative":
      sensitivityLevel = 0.1; // Low sensitivity
      break;
    case "Command":
      sensitivityLevel = 0.9; // High sensitivity
      break;
    case "Question":
      sensitivityLevel = 0.7; // Medium-High sensitivity
      break;
    case "Music":
      sensitivityLevel = 0.01; // Very Low sensitivity
      break;
    case "Speech-to-Text output":
      sensitivityLevel = 0.01; // Very Low sensitivity
      break;
    default:
      sensitivityLevel = 0.5; // Default medium sensitivity
  }
  return sensitivityLevel;
}

// In the main audio processing loop:
classificationTag = SAM.classify(audioSegment);
sensitivityLevel = adjustSensitivity(classificationTag);
KDM.setSensitivity(sensitivityLevel);
```

*   **Hardware/Software Considerations:**
    *   SAM requires significant processing power, potentially necessitating a dedicated AI accelerator.
    *   Low-latency audio processing is crucial. The SAM analysis must be completed quickly enough to avoid audible delays.
    *   The classification tags and sensitivity levels should be configurable and adaptable based on user preferences or environmental factors.
    *   Training data for the SAM should include a wide range of audio content and user interactions.
    *   A cloud-based SAM could reduce local processing load, but introduce latency and privacy concerns.
