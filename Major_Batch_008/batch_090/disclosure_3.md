## Dynamic Attack Surface Mapping with Simulated Propagation

**Concept:** Expand threat model generation beyond static graph analysis to incorporate simulated attack propagation. Instead of just *identifying* potential risks based on relationships, actively *simulate* how an attack would move through the system, revealing hidden vulnerabilities and quantifying risk exposure.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Attack Surface Simulator (ASS) - a module integrated with the existing threat model generator.
*   **Input:** The resource graph generated by the core system (nodes representing resources, edges representing relationships).  Configuration parameters defining attacker capabilities (e.g., maximum hop count, allowed exploit types).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Attack Vector Selection:**  ASS randomly selects a source node (representing a potentially compromised resource) or accepts a user-defined starting point.
    2.  **Propagation Simulation:**
        *   Starting from the source node, ASS explores adjacent nodes based on the relationships defined in the graph.
        *   For each potential move, a probability score is calculated based on:
            *   **Relationship Type:**  (e.g., a network connection is more easily exploited than a data flow)
            *   **Resource Vulnerability:** (assessed from vulnerability scans or pre-defined profiles; a node with known vulnerabilities has a higher probability)
            *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** (presence of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc. lowers probability)
        *   A weighted random number is generated and compared to the probability score. If the number is less, the attack "propagates" to the adjacent node.
        *   This process repeats for a configurable number of hops or until the attack reaches a dead end or meets a pre-defined stopping criterion.
    3.  **Risk Quantification:**  During the simulation, ASS tracks:
        *   **Reached Nodes:** The number and type of resources reached by the simulated attack.
        *   **Propagation Path:**  The sequence of nodes traversed, identifying critical paths.
        *   **Total Risk Score:** A cumulative score based on the value of reached resources and the probability of successful propagation.
    4.  **Dynamic Threat Model Update:**  The simulation results are fed back into the threat model, highlighting:
        *   **Critical Vulnerabilities:** Resources that are frequently reached in multiple simulations.
        *   **Weakest Links:** Relationships that consistently allow attack propagation.
        *   **Attack Surface Reduction Opportunities:**  Areas where removing or modifying relationships can significantly reduce risk.
*   **Output:** A dynamically updated threat model that includes:
    *   Risk scores for individual resources and relationships.
    *   Visualizations of attack propagation paths.
    *   Recommendations for mitigating identified vulnerabilities.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function simulate_attack(graph, source_node, max_hops, attacker_capabilities):
  attack_path = [source_node]
  current_node = source_node
  hops = 0

  while hops < max_hops:
    neighbors = get_neighbors(graph, current_node)
    
    if neighbors is empty:
      break

    potential_next_nodes = []
    for neighbor in neighbors:
      propagation_probability = calculate_propagation_probability(neighbor, current_node, attacker_capabilities)
      if random_number() < propagation_probability:
        potential_next_nodes.append(neighbor)
    
    if potential_next_nodes is empty:
      break
    
    next_node = random.choice(potential_next_nodes)
    attack_path.append(next_node)
    current_node = next_node
    hops += 1

  return attack_path
```
