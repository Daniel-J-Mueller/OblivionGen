## Dynamic Tag Inheritance & Contextual Policy Application

**Concept:** Extend the freeform tagging system with dynamic tag inheritance based on resource relationships and contextual policy application triggered by real-time events *outside* the core access control system. This creates a self-modifying security perimeter.

**Specification:**

**1. Resource Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Structure:** A directed graph representing relationships between computing resources. Nodes are resources (VMs, databases, applications, etc.). Edges represent relationships (e.g., "depends on," "contains," "communicates with").
*   **Relationship Discovery:** Automated discovery of resource relationships via:
    *   Network traffic analysis.
    *   Configuration file parsing.
    *   API introspection.
    *   User-defined relationships.
*   **Graph Persistence:**  A graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) stores the resource graph.

**2. Tag Inheritance Rules:**

*   **Rule Definition Language:** A DSL to define tag inheritance rules.  Example:
    ```
    IF resource_type == "database" AND parent.tag == "sensitive_data" THEN add_tag("encrypted")
    IF resource_type == "VM" AND network_group == "web_servers" THEN add_tag("public_facing")
    IF resource_type == "application" AND depends_on("database") AND database.tag == "PII" THEN add_tag("data_access_restricted")
    ```
*   **Rule Engine:** A dedicated component that evaluates inheritance rules against the resource graph.  Rules are applied recursively.
*   **Tag Propagation:** Upon rule evaluation, new tags are dynamically added to resource metadata.

**3.  External Event Integration:**

*   **Event Sources:**  Integration with external event sources (SIEM, threat intelligence feeds, performance monitoring systems, geo-location services).
*   **Event-Policy Mapping:** Define mappings between external events and policy modifications. Example:
    ```
    IF event == "high_severity_vulnerability_detected" AND resource.tag == "critical_service" THEN add_tag("under_attack")
    IF event == "geo_location_change" AND geo_location == "unauthorized_region" THEN add_tag("blocked_access")
    IF event == "performance_degradation" AND resource.tag == "production_service" THEN add_tag("scaling_required")
    ```
*   **Policy Modification:** Upon event trigger, tags are dynamically added or removed based on defined mappings.

**4.  Policy Evaluation Enhancements:**

*   **Contextual Attributes:**  The access control policy language is extended to incorporate contextual attributes derived from tags, external events, and resource metadata (e.g., time of day, user location, risk score). Example:
    ```
    ALLOW access IF user.role == "admin" OR (resource.tag == "public_data" AND time_of_day BETWEEN 09:00 AND 17:00)
    DENY access IF resource.tag == "under_attack"
    ```

**Pseudocode (Policy Evaluation):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(user, resource, operation, context):
  policies = getRelevantPolicies(user, resource, operation)
  for policy in policies:
    if policy.condition evaluates to true based on user, resource, operation, and context:
      return policy.action // ALLOW or DENY
  return DENY // Default deny if no matching policy
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Use a reactive programming model to propagate tag changes and policy updates efficiently.
*   Implement a caching layer to reduce the overhead of policy evaluation.
*   Provide a UI for defining tag inheritance rules and event-policy mappings.
*   Consider using a distributed consensus algorithm to maintain consistency of the resource graph and tag metadata.
