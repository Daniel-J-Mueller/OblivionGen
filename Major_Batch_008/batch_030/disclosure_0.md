## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Granularity

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple early reflection filtering to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene in real-time, focusing on granular temporal control over individual sound components. This goes beyond simply suppressing reflections; it aims to model and manipulate the sonic environment itself.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Microphone Array:** Minimum 8-microphone array (expandable to 16+). Microphones should be high SNR, broadband (20Hz-20kHz). Spatial arrangement should prioritize both horizontal and vertical separation for robust 3D localization.

2.  **Real-time Ray Tracing Engine:** Integrate a lightweight, real-time ray tracing engine optimized for audio. This engine doesn't render visuals, only calculates propagation paths for sound based on identified surfaces. Data source for room geometry comes from on-device SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) or user input (e.g., room dimensions). Ray tracing calculations occur at 20ms intervals, synchronized with audio processing.

3.  **Sound Source Decomposition:** Implement a source separation algorithm (e.g., Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Deep Clustering) to decompose the incoming audio signal into individual sound components (voices, instruments, ambient sounds). This happens *before* ray tracing.

4.  **Temporal Granularity Control:**  Introduce ‘Temporal Zones’. These are short, overlapping time slices (e.g., 50ms duration with 25ms overlap) across the incoming audio. Each Temporal Zone contains the decomposed sound components.

5.  **Ray Tracing per Temporal Zone:**  For *each* Temporal Zone, run the ray tracing engine on the decomposed sound components. This creates a map of simulated reflections, diffractions, and transmissions.  The resulting ‘sonic fingerprint’ for that Temporal Zone is a set of delayed and attenuated versions of the original sound components.

6.  **Dynamic Mixing:**  Introduce a dynamic mixing engine that blends the original audio with the simulated reflections from the ray tracing engine. Crucially, this mixing is controlled *per Temporal Zone*.  This allows for granular control over the perceived acoustic environment. The mixing parameters can be adjusted in real-time based on user preferences or automated analysis of the acoustic scene.

7.  **Acoustic 'Painting' Interface:** Develop a user interface that allows users to ‘paint’ the acoustic environment. This involves selecting surfaces in the reconstructed 3D space and assigning acoustic properties (absorption, reflection, diffraction). Changes made in the interface are immediately reflected in the ray tracing engine and audible in the processed audio.

8.  **Parameter Control:**
    *   **Reverb Tail Length:** User adjustable from 0ms to 5s.
    *   **Reflection Density:** Control the number of reflections calculated per ray.
    *   **Surface Material Library:** A library of pre-defined acoustic materials (wood, glass, carpet, etc.).
    *   **Temporal Zone Resolution:** Control the length and overlap of the Temporal Zones.
    *   **Source Separation Algorithm Selection:** Choose between different source separation algorithms based on performance and accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Core Processing Loop):**

```
FOR each Temporal Zone:
    Decompose audio into individual sound sources
    FOR each sound source:
        Run ray tracing engine to calculate simulated reflections
        Mix original sound source with simulated reflections
    END FOR
END FOR

Output mixed audio
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems primarily focus on *suppressing* reflections. This design aims to *reconstruct* the entire acoustic scene, allowing for real-time manipulation and control. The Temporal Zone approach introduces a granular level of control not found in traditional reverb or spatialization algorithms.  The ‘acoustic painting’ interface provides a unique and intuitive way for users to shape their sonic environment.
