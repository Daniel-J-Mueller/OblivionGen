## Temporal Data Shadowing for Predictive Consistency

**Concept:** Extend the version history concept to create ‘shadow’ versions of data, proactively generated based on predicted transaction patterns. This allows for read operations to consistently access data *as it will be* after likely concurrent transactions, minimizing read-write conflicts and improving predictive consistency.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Transaction Model (PTM):**

*   **Data Structure:** A probabilistic model (e.g., Markov chain, Bayesian network) maintained per table/object.
*   **Input:** Transaction logs, read/write patterns, user behavior data.
*   **Output:** Probabilistic prediction of future transactions - the likelihood of writes to specific data items within a defined time window.

**2. Shadow Version Generation:**

*   **Trigger:**  Based on PTM output exceeding a predefined confidence threshold (e.g., 80% likelihood of write).
*   **Mechanism:** Before a predicted write transaction fully commits, a 'shadow' version of the affected data is created. This shadow version incorporates the *predicted* changes.
*   **Storage:** Shadow versions are stored alongside the committed versions, tagged with the prediction confidence level and predicted commit timestamp.

**3. Read Operation Handling:**

*   **Version Selection:** When a read request arrives:
    *   First, check for an *uncommitted* version associated with the current transaction. If found, use it.
    *   Next, query the version history for committed versions.
    *   Then, query for *shadow* versions.
    *   If a shadow version exists with a predicted commit timestamp *earlier* than the current read request's timestamp (or estimated completion time), use the shadow version *instead* of the committed version.

**4. Conflict Resolution and Validation:**

*   **Write Validation:**  When an actual write transaction commits:
    *   Verify that the data it modified hasn't been altered since the shadow version was created.
    *   If the data *has* been altered, invalidate the shadow version and revert to the latest committed version.
*   **Shadow Version Purge:** Regularly purge shadow versions that have been invalidated or exceeded a maximum age.

**Pseudocode (Read Operation):**

```
function readData(table, key, transactionID, readTimestamp):
  // 1. Check for uncommitted version
  uncommittedVersion = getUncommittedVersion(table, key, transactionID)
  if uncommittedVersion != null:
    return uncommittedVersion.data

  // 2. Check committed versions
  committedVersion = getLatestCommittedVersion(table, key)
  if committedVersion != null:
    // 3. Check shadow versions
    shadowVersion = getShadowVersion(table, key, shadowVersion.predictedCommitTimestamp < readTimestamp)
    if shadowVersion != null:
      return shadowVersion.data
    else:
      return committedVersion.data
  else:
    //Data not found
    return null
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `TransactionLog`:  Stores transaction details (ID, start time, read/write operations).
*   `VersionHistory`: Stores all committed and shadow versions of data. Each version includes:
    *   `data`
    *   `commitTimestamp` (or `predictedCommitTimestamp`)
    *   `versionType` (committed/shadow)
    *   `confidenceLevel` (for shadow versions)
*   `PTM`: Probabilistic Transaction Model per table/object.
