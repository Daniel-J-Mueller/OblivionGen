## Secure Data 'Shadowing' with Decentralized Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the trusted execution environment (TEE) paradigm to incorporate a decentralized, blockchain-based attestation layer for enhanced data security and auditability, enabling 'shadowing' of sensitive data alongside its operational use.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on secure *examination* of data within a TEE. This expands that to continuous, verifiable data integrity *throughout* its lifecycle, not just during specific checks. It addresses concerns about potential TEE compromise or malicious insider activity.

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):** Existing implementation as described in the source patent.
    *   **Shadow Ledger:** A permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) acting as a secure, immutable record of data hashes and access events.
    *   **TEE Agent:** Software running within the TEE responsible for hashing data, recording hashes on the Shadow Ledger, and managing access control policies.
    *   **Verifiers:** Entities (internal/external auditors, compliance officers) capable of independently verifying data integrity against the Shadow Ledger.

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Data enters the system.
    2.  The TEE Agent calculates a cryptographic hash (SHA-256 or similar) of the data.
    3.  The TEE Agent records the hash, a timestamp, and relevant metadata (data owner, access permissions) on the Shadow Ledger as a 'data anchor'.
    4.  Sensitive data processing occurs within the TEE.
    5.  Whenever data is modified, a *new* hash is calculated and a new data anchor is created, linked to the previous anchor, forming a chain of custody.
    6.  Verifiers can request a data integrity report.
    7.  The system retrieves the entire chain of data anchors from the Shadow Ledger.
    8.  Verifiers can independently recalculate the hashes of the current data and compare them against the anchors. Any mismatch indicates data tampering.

*   **Pseudocode (TEE Agent):**

```
function record_data_anchor(data, metadata):
  hash = SHA256(data)
  transaction = {
    "hash": hash,
    "timestamp": current_timestamp(),
    "metadata": metadata
  }
  submit_transaction_to_shadow_ledger(transaction)

function verify_data_integrity(data, expected_hash_chain):
  calculated_hash = SHA256(data)
  if calculated_hash == expected_hash_chain[0]:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

*   **Key Enhancements:**
    *   **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of data changes and automatic alerting of any discrepancies.
    *   **Non-Repudiation:** Immutable audit trail provides evidence of data access and modifications.
    *   **Decentralized Trust:** Reduces reliance on a single trusted entity. The blockchain provides a shared, verifiable source of truth.
    *   **Selective Disclosure:** Access to the Shadow Ledger can be controlled, allowing organizations to share audit trails with regulators or partners without revealing the underlying data.
    *   **Automated Compliance:** Simplifies regulatory audits and reporting.

*   **Hardware Considerations:** The system can leverage existing TEE technologies (Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone). Blockchain nodes can be deployed on dedicated hardware or virtual machines.

*   **Security Considerations:** The security of the system depends on the robustness of the TEE and the blockchain implementation. Secure key management and access control are critical.
