## Dynamic Property Graph Sharding with Predictive Indexing

**Concept:** Extend the indexed property graph concept by dynamically sharding the graph across multiple nodes based on *predicted* query patterns, and proactively building indices *before* queries arrive. This moves beyond reactive indexing to a proactive, scalable system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Query Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Stream of incoming graph queries (captured through API logs, query history, etc.).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future query patterns – specifically, which properties will be frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, or aggregations.
    *   Maintain a “heat map” of property access frequency, weighted by query importance (e.g., user priority, application criticality).
    *   Detect emerging query patterns – identify properties that are increasing in access frequency and predict future demand.
*   **Output:** Prioritized list of properties to shard and index, along with estimated query load per property.

**2. Dynamic Graph Sharding:**

*   **Sharding Key:** Primary sharding key is determined by the predicted query patterns. Properties identified by the Query Prediction Engine as high-demand are designated as sharding keys.
*   **Sharding Algorithm:** Consistent hashing is employed to distribute graph data across multiple nodes. Each node is responsible for a range of sharding key values.
*   **Data Migration:** Implement a background process for migrating data based on changing sharding keys. This should minimize downtime and maintain data consistency. Use a distributed transaction protocol (e.g., Two-Phase Commit) to ensure data integrity during migration.
*   **Metadata Management:** Maintain a central metadata store that maps sharding keys to physical node locations. This allows queries to be routed efficiently to the correct nodes.

**3. Predictive Indexing:**

*   **Index Creation:**  Based on predictions from the Query Prediction Engine, proactively create indices on properties *before* queries arrive.
*   **Index Types:** Support a variety of index types (B-tree, hash, spatial) based on property data type and anticipated query patterns.
*   **Index Maintenance:** Implement a background process for rebuilding and optimizing indices based on changing data distributions and query patterns.
*   **Bloom Filters:** Utilize Bloom filters to quickly determine if a node contains data relevant to a query, reducing network traffic and latency.

**4. Query Execution:**

*   **Query Planner:** The query planner analyzes the query, identifies the relevant sharding keys, and generates an execution plan.
*   **Distributed Query Execution:** The query is decomposed into subqueries that are executed in parallel on the appropriate nodes.
*   **Data Aggregation:** Results from the subqueries are aggregated and returned to the client.

**Pseudocode (Query Planner):**

```
function planQuery(query):
  shardingKeys = identifyShardingKeys(query)
  nodes = lookupNodes(shardingKeys)
  subqueries = decomposeQuery(query, nodes)
  executionPlan = createExecutionPlan(subqueries, nodes)
  return executionPlan
```
