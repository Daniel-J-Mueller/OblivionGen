## Adaptive Packet Prioritization via Learned Network State

**Concept:** Extend selective sequencing to dynamically prioritize packets *within* a flow, based on real-time network condition learning, rather than simply enforcing order. This allows for intelligent adaptation to congestion, loss, and latency, improving application responsiveness.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Network State Learner (NSL)**
    *   Input: Per-flow network statistics (RTT, packet loss, jitter) gathered from both source and destination endpoints.
    *   Mechanism:  A lightweight, distributed reinforcement learning (RL) agent deployed on edge devices/proxies. Uses a Q-learning or SARSA algorithm.
    *   State Space:  Quantized RTT, packet loss rate, jitter, and available bandwidth.
    *   Action Space:  Priority levels assigned to packets (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
    *   Reward Function: Based on application-level acknowledgements (ACKs) received. Higher ACK rate and lower latency = higher reward.
    *   Output:  Priority level for each packet.
*   **Component 2: Packet Prioritization Module (PPM)**
    *   Input:  Packets, priority level from NSL.
    *   Mechanism:  Modifies packet headers (e.g., DSCP, ECN) to reflect priority.  May also employ queuing disciplines (e.g., Weighted Fair Queuing) at network nodes.
    *   Output:  Prioritized packets.
*   **Component 3: Adaptive Sequencing/Reassembly (ASR)**
    *   Input:  Prioritized packets, sequence numbers.
    *   Mechanism:  ASR component allows for out-of-order delivery of high-priority packets, while ensuring eventual in-order delivery of lower-priority packets.  It leverages sequence numbers for reassembly and duplication detection.
    *   Output: Packets delivered to application layer

**Pseudocode (PPM):**

```
function prioritizePacket(packet, priorityLevel):
  if priorityLevel == "High":
    setDSCP(packet, EF) // Expedited Forwarding
    setECN(packet, Enable)
  elif priorityLevel == "Medium":
    setDSCP(packet, AF41) // Assured Forwarding
    setECN(packet, Enable)
  else: // Low
    setDSCP(packet, Default)
    setECN(packet, Disable)
  return packet
```

**Flow Diagram:**

```
[Application Data] --> [NSL] --> [PPM] --> [Network] --> [Network] --> [ASR] --> [Application]
                                 |                      |
                                 |                      <--Feedback (ACKs, Latency)--|
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Path Awareness:** Incorporate path diversity information into the NSL to select optimal paths for different priority levels.
*   **Flow Isolation:** Use flow identifiers to ensure prioritization is applied only to relevant packets.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adapt priority thresholds based on network load and application requirements.
*   **Predictive Prioritization:**  Utilize machine learning to predict future network conditions and proactively adjust packet priorities.
