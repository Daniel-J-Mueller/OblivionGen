## Dynamic Authentication Profiles

**Concept:** Implement a system that learns user authentication preferences and dynamically adjusts authentication requirements based on observed behavior and contextual factors. This goes beyond simply enabling/disabling automatic authentication; it creates a *profile* of acceptable risk for each user.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Profile Creation:**

*   **Behavioral Metrics:** Track:
    *   Frequency of bids/transactions
    *   Typical bid amounts
    *   Time of day/week of activity
    *   Device types used (desktop, mobile, etc.)
    *   Network location (general – country/region)
    *   Speed of transaction completion (time between item view and bid)
*   **User-Defined Risk Tolerance:** Allow users to set a baseline risk level (low, medium, high). This acts as an initial weight for the system.
*   **Profile Storage:** Store user profiles (behavioral data, risk tolerance) in a dedicated database, indexed by user ID. Update profiles with each transaction.
*   **Risk Score Calculation:** Assign a "Risk Score" to each transaction based on:
    *   Deviation from typical behavior (e.g., unusual bid amount, time of day)
    *   Current risk tolerance setting
    *   External factors (e.g., flagged item, known fraudulent user)
    *   Formula: `Risk Score = (Behavioral Deviation * Weight1) + (Risk Tolerance * Weight2) + (External Factor * Weight3)`. Weights are tunable parameters.

**2. Dynamic Authentication Levels:**

*   **Level 1: No Authentication:** For low-risk transactions (Risk Score < Threshold1), automatically process the bid without any further authentication.
*   **Level 2: Passive Authentication:** For medium-risk transactions (Threshold1 <= Risk Score < Threshold2), implement "passive" authentication:
    *   Device fingerprinting
    *   Geolocation verification (approximate)
    *   Behavioral biometrics (typing speed, mouse movements – optional)
    *   If passive authentication succeeds, proceed. If it fails, escalate to Level 3.
*   **Level 3: Challenge Authentication:** For high-risk transactions (Risk Score >= Threshold2):
    *   Two-factor authentication (2FA) – SMS, authenticator app, email
    *   Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) – security questions
    *   Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition) – optional
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Dynamically adjust `Threshold1` and `Threshold2` based on overall system fraud rates and user feedback.

**3. System Architecture & Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Transaction Processing Flow
function processTransaction(user_id, bid_amount, item_id) {
  user_profile = getUserProfile(user_id)
  risk_score = calculateRiskScore(user_profile, bid_amount, item_id)

  if (risk_score < Threshold1) {
    // Level 1: No Authentication
    placeBid(bid_amount, item_id, user_id)
    updateUserProfile(user_id, "Success")
  } else if (risk_score < Threshold2) {
    // Level 2: Passive Authentication
    if (passiveAuthenticationSuccessful()) {
      placeBid(bid_amount, item_id, user_id)
      updateUserProfile(user_id, "Passive Success")
    } else {
      // Escalate to Level 3
      challengeAuthentication()
    }
  } else {
    // Level 3: Challenge Authentication
    challengeAuthentication()
  }
}

function challengeAuthentication() {
  // Implement 2FA, KBA, or biometric authentication
  // If authentication succeeds, place the bid. Otherwise, flag the transaction for review.
}
```

**4.  Alerting & Anomaly Detection:**

*   Implement a real-time anomaly detection system that monitors risk scores and flags suspicious activity.
*   Send alerts to administrators when risk scores exceed a predefined threshold.
