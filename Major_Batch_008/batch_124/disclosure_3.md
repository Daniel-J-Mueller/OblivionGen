## Predictive Anomaly Detection with Multi-Sensor Fusion & Generative Counterfactuals

**System Overview:** This system expands upon the existing video analysis by incorporating data from diverse sensor networks (audio, environmental – temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality), and utilizes generative AI to create “counterfactual” video sequences. The goal is to anticipate anomalous events *before* they fully manifest in the video feed, and to provide contextual understanding exceeding simple anomaly detection.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Sensor Fusion Module:**
    *   **Inputs:** Video streams (from existing system), Audio feeds, Environmental sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality), potentially metadata from connected devices (e.g., access control systems, vehicle detection).
    *   **Processing:**  Time-series data from all sources are synchronized and processed using a Kalman Filter or similar state estimation technique. A weighted average determines the contribution of each sensor to a combined "risk score". Weights are dynamically adjusted based on sensor reliability and historical performance.
    *   **Output:** A multi-dimensional "environmental state vector" representing the current conditions at the monitored site, and a dynamic risk score.

2.  **Generative Counterfactual Engine:**
    *   **Model:** A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on historical video and sensor data. The model learns the "normal" distribution of events at the monitored site.
    *   **Functionality:** Given the current environmental state vector, the engine generates multiple plausible "counterfactual" video sequences representing what *should* be happening given those conditions.  These sequences are not predictions of what *will* happen, but representations of expected normality.
    *   **Output:** A set of counterfactual video sequences.

3.  **Anomaly Detection & Prediction Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time video feed, Counterfactual video sequences, Environmental state vector.
    *   **Processing:** A learned similarity metric (e.g., Structural Similarity Index – SSIM, Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity – LPIPS) compares the real-time video with the generated counterfactuals.  Significant divergence indicates an anomaly.
        *   A "time-to-impact" estimate is calculated based on the *rate* of divergence between the real-time video and the counterfactuals.
    *   **Output:** Anomaly detection alert, Severity score, Time-to-impact estimate, and a visual overlay highlighting the anomalous region in the video feed.

**Pseudocode for Anomaly Detection:**

```
function detect_anomaly(realtime_video, counterfactuals, environmental_state):
  similarity_scores = []
  for counterfactual in counterfactuals:
    similarity_score = calculate_similarity(realtime_video, counterfactual) // e.g. LPIPS
    similarity_scores.append(similarity_score)

  average_similarity = mean(similarity_scores)

  if average_similarity < threshold:
    anomaly_detected = True
    severity = 1 - average_similarity // Scale to 0-1
    time_to_impact = calculate_divergence_rate(similarity_scores) // Measures how quickly scores are decreasing
  else:
    anomaly_detected = False
    severity = 0
    time_to_impact = 0

  return anomaly_detected, severity, time_to_impact
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Historical video streams.
*   Sensor data (time-series).
*   Generated counterfactual video sequences (stored as latent vectors to conserve space).
*   Model weights for the VAE/GAN and similarity metrics.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Predictive maintenance:** Detect subtle changes in equipment behavior *before* failure.
*   **Security:** Anticipate potential security breaches based on unusual activity patterns.
*   **Public safety:** Identify and respond to emergency situations faster.
*   **Industrial process control:** Optimize production processes by identifying and correcting anomalies in real-time.
