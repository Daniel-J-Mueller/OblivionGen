## Dynamic Key Shard Distribution & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the key rotation concept to a *sharded* key system, distributing key components across multiple, geographically diverse storage locations.  This isn’t just about rotating the *whole* key, but rotating *parts* of it, increasing resilience and security.  

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Sharding Module:**

*   **Input:** Cryptographic key (symmetric or asymmetric).  Key length configurable.
*   **Process:** 
    *   Divide the key into *n* shards (configurable).  Shards should be of roughly equal size.
    *   Employ a secure secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir’s Secret Sharing) to create these shards.  The scheme parameters (threshold *t*, number of shards *n*) are configurable.  *t* represents the minimum number of shards required to reconstruct the original key.
    *   Encrypt each shard individually using a unique key derived from a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
    *   Distribute the encrypted shards to geographically diverse storage locations (cloud regions, on-premise data centers, etc.).  Storage locations are configurable.
*   **Output:** List of encrypted key shards with associated storage locations.

**2. Key Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Input:** Request for the key (e.g., from an encryption/decryption service). Identification of the required key name.
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify the storage locations of the key shards based on the key name.
    *   Retrieve *t* or more encrypted key shards from the storage locations.
    *   Authenticate the retrieved shards (verify digital signatures, timestamp checks, etc.).
    *   Decrypt the retrieved shards using the appropriate HSM-derived keys.
    *   Apply the secret sharing reconstruction algorithm to combine the decrypted shards into the original key.
*   **Output:** Reconstructed cryptographic key.

**3. Rotation & Shard Refresh:**

*   **Trigger:** Time-based rotation schedule or manual request.
*   **Process:**
    *   Generate new cryptographic key material.
    *   Shard the new key material (as per Key Sharding Module).
    *   Encrypt and distribute the new shards.
    *   *Gradually* replace the existing shards with the new ones.  This is critical for minimal disruption. A rolling update approach is preferred.
    *   Maintain both old and new shards for a defined period (rotation window) to support decryption of older ciphertext.
    *   Delete old shards after the rotation window expires.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Rotation period (configurable)
    *   Rotation window (configurable)
    *   Number of shards (*n*)
    *   Threshold (*t*)

**4. Failure Handling:**

*   **Shard Unavailability:** If a shard is unavailable, attempt to retrieve it from another replica or storage location.  If a sufficient number of shards are still available (*t* or more), proceed with key reconstruction.
*   **HSM Failure:** Redundant HSMs should be used to ensure high availability.
*   **Network Issues:** Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
FUNCTION reconstructKey(keyName)
  storageLocations = getKeyShardLocations(keyName)
  retrievedShards = []
  FOR location IN storageLocations
    TRY
      shard = retrieveShard(location)
      retrievedShards.append(shard)
    EXCEPT
      //Log error, retry mechanism
      PASS

  IF length(retrievedShards) < threshold
    RETURN error("Insufficient shards available")

  decryptedShards = []
  FOR shard IN retrievedShards
    decryptedShard = decryptShard(shard, hsmKey) //Use HSM for decryption
    decryptedShards.append(decryptedShard)

  reconstructedKey = reconstructSecret(decryptedShards, secretSharingAlgorithm)
  RETURN reconstructedKey
END FUNCTION
```

**Innovation:** This isn't simply about rotating a key; it’s about dynamically distributing its *components* and managing their lifecycle. The rolling shard replacement minimizes downtime during rotation, and the sharded approach inherently increases resilience against compromise.  The ability to configure *n* and *t* provides a flexible security/availability trade-off.
