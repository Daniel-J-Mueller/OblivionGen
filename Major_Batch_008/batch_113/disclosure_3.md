## Dynamic Index Sharding & Federated Querying

**Concept:** Extend the index object concept to facilitate horizontally scalable graph data storage and querying across multiple storage nodes. This creates a ‘sharded’ index layer on top of a distributed graph.

**Specs:**

**1. Index Sharding Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Graph data structure, desired number of shards (N).
*   **Process:**
    *   Assign a hash value to each data object based on a designated attribute (e.g., object ID, a frequently queried property).
    *   Calculate the shard ID for each data object: `shardID = hash(object.id) % N`.
    *   Each index object is associated with a specific shard.
    *   The index object stores links *only* to data objects residing within its assigned shard.
*   **Output:** Shard assignment map (object ID -> shard ID), Index object assignments (index name -> shard ID).

**2. Federated Query Planner:**

*   **Input:** Query (including predicate), Index object name.
*   **Process:**
    *   Determine the shard ID associated with the specified index object.
    *   Identify all shards potentially containing data relevant to the query (based on the predicate and graph structure). This requires a ‘global graph metadata’ store which knows the graph’s topology across shards.
    *   Construct a distributed query plan:
        *   Each shard executes the query against its local data, filtering based on the predicate and utilizing the local index object.
        *   A central ‘result aggregator’ node collects partial results from each shard.
        *   The aggregator combines and filters the partial results to produce the final query result.
*   **Output:** Distributed query plan (shard assignments, query fragments, aggregation logic).

**3.  Dynamic Index Migration:**

*   **Input:** Shard load metrics (CPU, memory, I/O), query performance metrics.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor shard load and query performance.
    *   If a shard becomes overloaded or query performance degrades, identify an underutilized shard.
    *   Initiate an index migration process:
        *   Replicate the index object and associated data to the target shard.
        *   Update the global graph metadata store to reflect the new index location.
        *   Redirect future queries to the new index location.
*   **Output:** Updated graph metadata, Migrated index object.

**4. Pseudocode: Federated Query Execution**

```
function federatedQuery(query, indexName):
  indexShard = getShardForIndex(indexName)
  relevantShards = findRelevantShards(query) // Uses global graph metadata

  parallel:
    for shard in relevantShards:
      shardResult = shard.executeQuery(query, indexName)
      return shardResult to aggregator

  aggregator.combineResults(all shardResults)
  return aggregator.finalResult
```

**Innovation Focus:**  Moving beyond single-node indexing to a distributed, scalable indexing solution for massive graph datasets.  Enabling querying across geographically dispersed graph data while maintaining performance and availability.  Dynamic rebalancing of indexes based on workload.
