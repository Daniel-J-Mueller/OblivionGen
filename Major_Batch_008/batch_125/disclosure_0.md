## Adaptive GPU Thread Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of application threads mapped to GPU execution threads based on workload characteristics and performance monitoring. The existing patent focuses on 1:1 mapping. This expands on that by making it *adaptive*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Workload Profiler Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitor application thread behavior (CPU usage, memory access patterns, instruction mix, blocking call frequency).
*   **Metrics:** CPU cycles per command, memory bandwidth utilization, cache miss rate, duration of blocking calls.
*   **Output:**  A "workload signature" for each application thread, characterizing its resource demands and execution pattern.  This signature is a vector of normalized metric values.

**2. Granularity Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Input:** Workload signatures from the Workload Profiler Module, current thread mapping configuration, performance metrics (GPU utilization, frame rates, latency).
*   **Logic:** Implements a decision tree or reinforcement learning model to determine optimal granularity.  Options:
    *   **Coarse-grained:** Multiple application threads mapped to a single GPU thread.  Useful for threads with low resource contention and high synchronization overhead.
    *   **Fine-grained:** 1:1 mapping as in the original patent.  Suitable for computationally intensive threads with limited dependencies.
    *   **Dynamic Splitting/Merging:**  GPU execution threads are dynamically created or destroyed based on application thread load.
*   **Output:**  A new thread mapping configuration that specifies how application threads are assigned to GPU execution threads.

**3. Thread Mapping Manager:**

*   **Input:**  Thread mapping configuration from the Granularity Adjustment Engine, application thread IDs, GPU execution thread IDs.
*   **Function:**  Handles the assignment of application threads to GPU execution threads.  This could involve:
    *   Creating new GPU execution threads.
    *   Terminating existing GPU execution threads.
    *   Modifying thread priorities.
    *   Adjusting thread affinity.

**4. Communication Protocol:**

*   Mechanism for the Computing Device to inform the GPU Server of the thread mapping configuration.
*   Utilizes a lightweight messaging protocol (e.g., gRPC, ZeroMQ) to minimize communication overhead.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Adjustment Engine):**

```
function adjustGranularity(workloadSignatures, gpuMetrics):
  for each threadID in workloadSignatures:
    signature = workloadSignatures[threadID]
    if signature.cpuUsage < threshold1 and signature.memoryBandwidth < threshold2:
      granularity = COARSE_GRAINED
    elif gpuMetrics.utilization > threshold3 and signature.blockingCalls > threshold4:
      granularity = COARSE_GRAINED
    else:
      granularity = FINE_GRAINED

    # Update thread mapping configuration
    updateThreadMapping(threadID, granularity)

  return threadMappingConfiguration
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Granularity Adjustment:** Use machine learning to predict future workload characteristics and proactively adjust thread granularity.
*   **Heterogeneous Thread Mapping:**  Map different types of application threads to different types of GPU execution threads (e.g., prioritize threads requiring high precision on GPU threads with double-precision support).
*   **Resource Reservation:** Reserve specific GPU execution threads for critical application threads to ensure consistent performance.
