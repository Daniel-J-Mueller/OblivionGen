## Adaptive Sensory Augmentation System

**Concept:** Extend the virtual browsing experience beyond visual representation by incorporating haptic and auditory feedback tied to item rankings and proximity within the virtual environment. Create a system that subtly 'guides' the user towards higher-ranked items based on sensed movement and orientation, creating an intuitive, multi-sensory navigation experience.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Mobile Device (with camera, motion sensors - gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer).
    *   Haptic Feedback Vest/Gloves: Array of vibrotactile actuators distributed across the torso/hands. Resolution: 5cm spacing. Frequency range: 20-200Hz. Amplitude control.
    *   Bone Conduction Headphones: For directional audio cues without obstructing ambient sound.
    *   Optional: Low-power radar for precise positioning in complex environments.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Environment Mapping Module:** Builds a 3D map of the physical environment using the mobile device camera and sensors (SLAM).
    *   **Item Ranking & Association:** Receives item data with associated rankings (as in the source patent).  Dynamically adjusts rankings based on user interaction.
    *   **Sensory Mapping Engine:** Translates item ranking and proximity to haptic and auditory signals. 
        *   Higher ranked items: Stronger, more defined haptic pulses. Higher frequency/volume audio cues.
        *   Proximity: Haptic pulse intensity/audio volume increases as the user 'moves towards' an item in the virtual space.
        *   Directional Audio: Uses bone conduction headphones to create the illusion that sounds originate from the virtual item's location in the environment.
    *   **Motion Prediction Algorithm:** Analyzes user movement to predict intended direction, allowing for proactive sensory cues.
    *   **Adaptive Learning Module:** Learns user preferences and adjusts sensory mappings accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Sensory Mapping Engine):**

```
function generate_sensory_output(item_ranking, item_distance, user_orientation, prediction):
    // Normalize values
    normalized_ranking = scale(item_ranking, 0, 1)
    normalized_distance = scale(item_distance, max_distance, 0) //Inverted
    
    //Haptic Output
    haptic_intensity = normalized_ranking * normalized_distance * base_haptic_strength
    haptic_frequency = base_haptic_frequency + (normalized_ranking * frequency_range)
    
    //Audio Output
    audio_volume = normalized_ranking * base_audio_volume
    audio_direction = calculate_direction(item_location, user_orientation, prediction)
    
    //Apply Outputs
    activate_haptic_actuator(haptic_intensity, haptic_frequency)
    play_audio_cue(audio_volume, audio_direction)
end function
```

**Operational Scenario:**

A user browses a virtual catalog of furniture. Higher-ranked sofas generate stronger haptic pulses on the left side of the haptic vest.  As the user turns their head (detected by the mobile device sensors), the haptic feedback dynamically shifts to align with the virtual sofa's location. Simultaneously, a subtle audio cue emanates from the bone conduction headphones, seemingly originating from the sofa's position in the room. The system learns that the user consistently focuses on leather sofas, and subtly amplifies the sensory cues for those items in future browsing sessions.
