## Dynamic Attribute Weighting via User Interaction Heatmaps

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple attribute ratings to create a dynamic weighting system for attributes based on aggregated user interaction *within* reviews. This system learns which aspects of an item users focus on most, even if they don't explicitly rate them.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Capture & Processing:**

*   **Review Text Analysis:**  All user-submitted review text (the "attribute review text" mentioned in Claim 1) is processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Specifically, techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and keyword/phrase extraction are employed.
*   **Interaction Heatmap Generation:**  For each review, generate a "heatmap" visualizing the frequency and density of mentions related to each attribute within the text.  Higher frequency/density = greater user focus on that attribute *within that specific review*.  This heatmap is *not* a simple count; it’s a spatial representation of focus.  Example: a review discussing a phone's camera might show a "hotspot" around mentions of "low-light performance" and "image stabilization".
*   **Aggregation:** Aggregate individual review heatmaps for each item. This creates a composite “focus map” showing average user attention towards each attribute for that item.  Smoothing algorithms (e.g., Gaussian blur) should be applied to reduce noise.
*   **Weight Assignment:** Normalize the aggregated focus map values to create attribute weights. Higher weight = more user focus. These weights dynamically adjust over time as new reviews are submitted.

**2. System Architecture:**

*   **Module 1: Review Text Processor:** (Python/NLP libraries - SpaCy, NLTK) - Responsible for cleaning, parsing, and analyzing review text. Outputs tagged keywords and phrases linked to known attributes.
*   **Module 2: Heatmap Generator:** (Python/Image Processing Libraries – OpenCV, Pillow) – Creates visual heatmaps based on keyword density and proximity within the review text.
*   **Module 3: Aggregation Engine:** (Database – PostgreSQL/MongoDB) – Stores individual review heatmaps and calculates aggregated focus maps.
*   **Module 4: Weight Assignment Module:** (Python/Statistical Libraries - NumPy, SciPy) - Normalizes aggregated focus map values and assigns dynamic attribute weights.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** This system integrates with the existing architecture described in the patent (Claims 1, 4, 18) by adding a layer of dynamic weight calculation that influences how attributes are displayed and prioritized to users.

**3. User Interface (UI) Implications:**

*   **Dynamic Attribute Presentation:** The UI should dynamically re-order and visually emphasize attributes based on their calculated weights. Attributes with higher weights appear at the top of the list and might be displayed with larger fonts or more prominent visual cues.
*   **Interactive Focus Maps:** Allow users to view the aggregated focus map for an item. Clicking on an area of the map highlights the relevant text within the reviews that contributed to that area's intensity. This provides transparency and context.
*   **Personalized Weighting:** Potentially allow users to customize attribute weights based on their individual preferences.

**4. Pseudocode (Weight Calculation):**

```
function calculate_attribute_weights(item_id):
  reviews = get_reviews_for_item(item_id)
  attribute_focus_scores = {} // Initialize scores for each attribute
  for review in reviews:
    heatmap = generate_heatmap(review.text)
    for attribute in known_attributes:
      attribute_focus_scores[attribute] += calculate_heatmap_intensity(heatmap, attribute)

  // Normalize scores
  total_score = sum(attribute_focus_scores.values())
  attribute_weights = {}
  for attribute, score in attribute_focus_scores.items():
    attribute_weights[attribute] = score / total_score

  return attribute_weights
```

**5. Expansion Potential:**

*   **Sentiment Analysis Integration:** Combine focus map intensity with sentiment analysis.  A high-intensity area with negative sentiment signals a potential problem area for the item.
*   **Comparative Analysis:**  Compare attribute weights across different items to identify strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**  Use historical weight data to predict future attribute importance.
