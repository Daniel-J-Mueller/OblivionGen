## Dynamic Data Sheet 'Views' with Temporal Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend the parent/child data sheet relationship to encompass temporal data, creating dynamically generated "views" of data anchored to specific points in time. Imagine not just linking cells *between* sheets, but creating sheets that represent the data *as it was* at a defined moment.

**Specs:**

*   **Temporal Anchor:** Each parent sheet can define one or more "Temporal Anchors." These are essentially timestamps or defined events.
*   **View Generation:** A user can request a "View" of a parent sheet *as of* a specific Temporal Anchor. This generates a new, read-only child sheet.
*   **Data Replication & Delta Tracking:** When a View is created, the relevant data from the parent sheet (as it existed at the specified Temporal Anchor) is replicated to the child sheet.  The system then tracks changes in the parent sheet *after* that anchor point.
*   **Differential Display:**  The child sheet displays data as it was at the anchor point.  A visual cue (e.g., highlighting, color-coding, a separate “Delta” pane) indicates cells that have changed in the parent sheet *since* the anchor point. The Delta pane would display the old and new values.
*   **'Play' Functionality:** A user can 'play' forward or backward through defined Temporal Anchors, automatically generating new Views and showcasing the changes.  This creates a dynamic visualization of data evolution.
*   **'What If' Analysis:**  Users can create temporary "branches" from a Temporal Anchor, modifying the child sheet and observing the potential impact on other linked sheets.  These branches are isolated and do not affect the primary parent sheet or other Views.
*   **Formula Propagation:** Formulas in the child sheet should resolve based on the data *as it existed at the Temporal Anchor*. Changes in the parent sheet should *not* retroactively alter the results in the child sheet unless specifically enabled for 'What If' analysis.

**Pseudocode (View Generation):**

```
function GenerateView(ParentSheet, AnchorTimestamp):
  ChildSheet = new Sheet()
  DataSnapshot = GetParentSheetDataAtTimestamp(ParentSheet, AnchorTimestamp)
  CopyDataToSheet(DataSnapshot, ChildSheet)
  SetSheetReadOnly(ChildSheet)
  TrackChangesInParentSheet(ParentSheet, AnchorTimestamp) // For Delta Display
  Return ChildSheet
```

**Pseudocode (Delta Display):**

```
function DisplayDelta(ParentSheet, ChildSheet, AnchorTimestamp):
  For each cell in ChildSheet:
    ParentValue = GetParentSheetValueAtTimestamp(ParentSheet, AnchorTimestamp, cell.coordinates)
    CurrentValue = ParentSheet.getValue(cell.coordinates)
    If ParentValue != CurrentValue:
      HighlightCell(cell, DeltaHighlightColor) // Visual Cue
      DisplayOldValue(cell, ParentValue)  // Optional: Display old value in tooltip or Delta pane
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Financial Auditing:**  Generate views of financial data as of specific reporting dates.
*   **Project Management:**  Track project progress at defined milestones.
*   **Scientific Research:**  Reproduce experimental conditions and data sets at specific points in time.
*   **Version Control for Data:**  Beyond simple snapshots, this allows for interactive exploration of data evolution.
