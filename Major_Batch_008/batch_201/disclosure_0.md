## Adaptive Beacon Choreography for Dynamic Mesh Networking

**Concept:** Expand the beaconing system into a dynamic mesh network choreography. Instead of simple device discovery, devices negotiate roles and responsibilities within a temporary, self-organizing network based on beacon content and response.

**Specifications:**

**1. Beacon Payload Extension:**

*   **Role Declaration:** Add a field to the beacon indicating the device’s preferred/available roles (e.g., data collector, data aggregator, gateway, edge processor). Roles are defined by functional capability - determined by hardware and software.
*   **Resource Advertisement:** Include a field advertising available resources (e.g., processing power, battery life, bandwidth, sensor types). Quantifiable metrics are preferred.
*   **Dependency Declaration:** A field to declare required resources or roles from other devices for a specific function. Example: "Requires 'data aggregator' with > 100mW power and temperature sensor".
*   **Proximity Weighting:** Embed a field indicating the desired proximity to other devices fulfilling certain criteria. This influences network topology.

**2. Response Beaconing:**

*   Devices receiving a beacon analyze the declared dependencies.
*   If a device can fulfill a dependency, it broadcasts a “Response Beacon” containing:
    *   Confirmation of dependency fulfillment.
    *   Its own resource advertisement (as above).
    *   A “Connection Request” – a unique ID for establishing a direct connection.
    *   A “Hop Count” – initialized to 1, incrementing for each relayed response.

**3. Network Formation Logic:**

*   The initiating device (broadcasting the original beacon) receives response beacons.
*   It evaluates responses based on:
    *   Resource availability.
    *   Proximity (estimated from signal strength).
    *   Hop Count (prioritize lower hop counts).
*   It selects optimal response(s) and initiates a direct connection using the Connection Request ID.
*   A temporary, peer-to-peer network is established.

**4. Dynamic Role Negotiation:**

*   Once connected, devices negotiate roles and data exchange protocols.
*   Roles are not static. Devices can switch roles based on resource availability and network needs.

**5. Network Dissolution:**

*   If a device loses power or moves out of range, the network automatically reconfigures.
*   The initiating device monitors network health and initiates new beacon broadcasts if necessary.

**Pseudocode (Initiating Device):**

```
function broadcastBeacon():
    createBeacon()
    beacon.role = "data collector"
    beacon.resources = {cpu: 0.5, battery: 80, sensorType: "temperature"}
    beacon.dependency = "data aggregator with > 100mW"
    broadcast(beacon)

function receiveResponseBeacon(response):
    if response.canFulfill(dependency):
        evaluateResponse(response)
        if bestResponse(response):
            connect(response.connectionRequestID)
            establishDataExchange()

function evaluateResponse(response):
    score = calculateScore(response.resources, proximity)
    storeResponse(response, score)

function calculateScore(resources, proximity):
    // Calculate a score based on resource availability and proximity.
    // Weight factors can be adjusted to optimize network performance.
    score = (resourceMatchWeight * resourceMatch) + (proximityWeight * proximity)
    return score
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Low-power transceiver module.
*   Sufficient processing power for network formation logic.
*   Sensing capabilities (optional, depending on application).

**Potential Applications:**

*   Environmental monitoring.
*   Smart agriculture.
*   Industrial automation.
*   Emergency response.
