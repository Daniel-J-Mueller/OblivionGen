## Dynamic Interference Mapping with Drone Swarms

**Concept:** Utilize a swarm of drones equipped with specialized RF sensors to create a real-time, dynamically updating map of wireless interference across a geographical area. This map will not just identify interference sources, but *predict* interference propagation based on environmental factors (buildings, trees, weather) and moving objects (vehicles, people). 

**Hardware Specs (Per Drone):**

*   **RF Sensor Suite:** Broadband RF receiver (2.4GHz - 6GHz, expandable), directional antenna (beamforming capable), spectrum analyzer.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** LiDAR, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure sensors.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for onboard data processing and preliminary analysis.
*   **Communication:** Secure, low-latency mesh network communication (Wi-Fi 6E or similar) between drones and a central server.
*   **GPS/IMU:** High-precision GPS with integrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for accurate positioning and orientation.
*   **Power:** Extended battery life (minimum 45 minutes flight time) with quick-swap capability.
*   **Form Factor:** Quadcopter, lightweight and agile, capable of operating in moderate wind conditions.

**Software/Algorithm Specs:**

1.  **Drone Swarm Coordination:**
    *   Distributed consensus algorithm for swarm formation, path planning, and data collection.
    *   Dynamic task allocation based on real-time interference conditions.
    *   Obstacle avoidance and collision prevention protocols.

2.  **RF Data Processing:**
    *   Real-time spectrum analysis to identify frequency bands experiencing interference.
    *   Direction-finding algorithms to pinpoint the source of interference.
    *   Signal strength measurements to assess the severity of interference.

3.  **Environmental Data Integration:**
    *   LiDAR data to create 3D models of the environment and identify potential signal obstructions.
    *   Temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure data to model signal propagation characteristics.
    *   Weather data integration (from external sources) to predict signal fade and multipath effects.

4.  **Interference Map Generation:**
    *   Fusion of RF and environmental data to create a dynamically updating interference map.
    *   Map representation: Hexagonal grid-based system for efficient data storage and retrieval.
    *   Data visualization: Color-coded heatmaps indicating interference intensity.
    *   Predictive modeling: Machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks) to predict future interference patterns based on historical data and environmental factors.

5.  **Central Server Components:**
    *   Data ingestion and storage: Scalable database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) to handle high-volume data streams.
    *   Data processing and analysis: Cloud-based compute cluster for large-scale data processing.
    *   Map visualization and reporting: Web-based dashboard for visualizing interference maps and generating reports.
    *   API endpoints: Secure API endpoints for accessing interference data and integrating with other systems.

**Pseudocode (Interference Prediction Module):**

```
FUNCTION predict_interference(historical_data, environmental_data, current_rf_data):
  // historical_data: Time series of RF readings and environmental data
  // environmental_data: LiDAR scans, weather data, building maps
  // current_rf_data: Real-time RF readings from drone swarm

  // 1. Feature Extraction
  features = extract_features(historical_data, environmental_data, current_rf_data)

  // 2. Model Training (offline)
  // Train a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, GRU, Convolutional Neural Network)
  // to predict interference levels based on extracted features
  model = train_model(training_data)

  // 3. Interference Prediction
  predicted_interference = model.predict(features)

  // 4. Map Update
  update_interference_map(predicted_interference)

  RETURN predicted_interference
```
