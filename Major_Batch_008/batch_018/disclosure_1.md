## Predictive Link Error Isolation with AI-Driven Telemetry Fusion

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive error detection to *predictive* error isolation. Leverage AI to fuse telemetry data from multiple network layers – not just link errors, but also device CPU/memory utilization, temperature, and even ambient environmental factors (if available) – to anticipate link failures *before* they impact traffic.

**Specs:**

*   **Telemetry Collection Agent (TCA):** Deployed on each network device. Collects:
    *   SNMP data (as in the existing patent) – `ifInErrors`, `ifOutErrors`, interface utilization, etc.
    *   System resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
    *   Device temperature sensors.
    *   (Optional) Ambient environmental data (temperature, humidity) via IoT sensors.
    *   Data is time-stamped and tagged with device ID, interface ID, and data type.
*   **Centralized Telemetry Fusion Engine (TFE):**
    *   Receives telemetry data from all TCAs.
    *   Data normalization and cleaning.
    *   Feature engineering: Calculate derived metrics (e.g., rate of change of error counts, correlation between temperature and errors, predictive metrics via time-series analysis).
*   **AI/ML Model (Predictive Error Engine):**
    *   Trained on historical telemetry data to identify patterns preceding link failures.
    *   Model Type: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – is well-suited for time-series data.
    *   Input: Time-series of telemetry features.
    *   Output: Probability of link failure within a defined time window (e.g., next hour, next day).
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  Rather than static error thresholds, the AI dynamically adjusts thresholds based on learned device behavior and environmental factors.
*   **Proactive Remediation Engine:**
    *   Based on predicted failure probabilities:
        *   **Traffic Re-Routing:** Dynamically reroute traffic away from predicted failing links.
        *   **Pre-emptive Link Shutdown:**  If failure is highly probable, proactively shut down the link to prevent data corruption.
        *   **Automated Ticket Creation:**  Generate trouble tickets with detailed diagnostics (predicted failure cause, affected devices, recommended actions).
*   **Visualization Dashboard:**  Display network health, predicted failure probabilities, and recommended actions.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Error Engine):**

```
function predict_link_failure(device_id, interface_id, telemetry_data):
  // telemetry_data: Time-series of telemetry features
  // LSTM Model: trained on historical data
  predicted_probability = LSTM_Model.predict(telemetry_data)
  
  if predicted_probability > failure_threshold:
    return "High probability of link failure"
  else:
    return "Low probability of link failure"
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond reactive error detection to *proactive* prevention. The fusion of diverse telemetry data and the use of AI/ML allows for anticipating failures before they impact network performance.  The dynamic threshold adjustment and automated remediation capabilities further enhance network resilience. This is *not* merely improving the existing patent's error location; it is adding a predictive layer on top of it.
