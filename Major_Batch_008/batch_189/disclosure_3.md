## Modular Conveyor System with Dynamic Gap Adjustment

**Concept:** A conveyor system utilizing independently controlled, short-length conveyor modules that can dynamically adjust the gap between them. This allows for handling payloads of varying sizes and shapes *without* halting the entire system. Inspired by the V-shaped/recess concept, this expands beyond fixed angles to actively reshape the transport surface.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** 30cm x 60cm x 10cm (length x width x height). Standardized footprint for interchangeability.
*   **Module Drive:** Each module contains a brushless DC motor driving a single, continuous belt.  Max speed: 1 m/s.
*   **Gap Adjustment Mechanism:** Linear actuators (ball screw type) integrated into the sides of each module. Range: 0 - 5cm. Resolution: 0.1cm. Controlled by a central system.
*   **Module Interconnection:** Modules connect via a rigid frame with integrated power and communication lines.  Quick-release latches for rapid assembly/disassembly.
*   **Surface Material:** Low-friction, wear-resistant polyurethane belt. Modular belt design for easy replacement of damaged sections.
*   **Central Control System:**  PLC-based controller with integrated HMI.  Supports pre-programmed sequences, real-time adjustments, and integration with external sensors (e.g., object detection, weight sensors).
*   **Sensor Integration:** Each module equipped with proximity sensors to detect the presence/absence of a payload and to assist with gap adjustment. Optional weight sensors for payload identification and sorting.
*   **Power Requirements:** 24V DC.  Modular power distribution system to simplify installation and maintenance.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Define ModuleArray[N] // Array of N modules
For each module in ModuleArray
  Initialize linear actuators to minimum gap
  Initialize belt drive
  Connect to central control system
End For

//Payload Handling Sequence
Function HandlePayload(PayloadWidth, PayloadLength)
  //1. Detect Arrival of Payload
  WaitForPayloadArrival()

  //2. Dynamic Gap Adjustment
  For each module in ModuleArray
    Set LinearActuatorPosition(ModuleWidth = PayloadWidth + 2cm) //Ensure sufficient clearance
  End For

  //3. Convey Payload
  ActivateBeltDrives(Speed = 0.5 m/s)

  //4. Payload Departure & Reset
  WaitForPayloadDeparture()
  For each module in ModuleArray
    Set LinearActuatorPosition(ModuleWidth = StandardWidth) //Return to default position
  End For
End Function

//Sensor Calibration Routine
Function CalibrateSensors()
  //Run through sensor array, recording readings.
  //Establish minimum/maximum values.
  //Apply smoothing filter.
End Function
```

**Innovation Detail:**

The core innovation is the active, independent adjustment of gaps *between* conveyor modules. This is more than just a variable-speed system; it's a *reshapeable* transport surface. This allows the system to handle irregularly shaped objects, dynamically route payloads, and even create temporary “diverters” without physical components.  

**Potential Applications:**

*   Sorting systems for e-commerce fulfillment
*   Automated assembly lines for products with varying configurations
*   Flexible packaging systems for items of different sizes
*   Customizable material handling solutions for complex manufacturing processes.
