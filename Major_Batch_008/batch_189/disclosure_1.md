**Dynamic Component Mesh Generation**

**Concept:** Expand the component grouping concept to facilitate the creation of procedural, dynamically generated ‘component meshes’. These meshes aren’t visual, but represent relationships *between* components, enabling emergent gameplay properties and vastly simplifying complex system construction.

**Specs:**

*   **Component Mesh Definition:** A new data structure – the ‘Component Mesh’ – stores directed graphs of component connections.  Nodes represent components (as defined in the base patent), edges represent dependencies or interactions.  Edge weight can denote strength of interaction or data flow rate.
*   **Mesh Editor Interface:** A visual editor allowing designers to construct Component Meshes. Drag-and-drop components onto the canvas, create connections (edges) between them.  The editor should support:
    *   Different connection types (e.g., ‘data feed’, ‘trigger’, ‘influence’).
    *   Edge weight adjustment.
    *   Visual representation of data flow (e.g., color-coding edges based on data type).
*   **Behavior Scripting within Mesh:**  Attach simple behavior scripts (visual scripting or code snippets) *to edges* within the Component Mesh. These scripts define *how* data flows or interacts across the connection. Example: “If data X > threshold, activate component Y.”
*   **Mesh Instantiation & Execution:** During gameplay, the Component Mesh is instantiated as a runtime graph. Components are created, connections are established, and edge-attached scripts execute, driving component interactions.
*   **Dynamic Mesh Modification:** Allow the Component Mesh to be modified *during* gameplay. This could be triggered by in-game events, AI decisions, or player actions. Modifications would re-establish connections and re-execute relevant scripts.
*   **Mesh Template Library:** A library of pre-built Component Meshes for common gameplay systems (e.g., ‘enemy AI’, ‘resource gathering’, ‘dialogue system’).
*   **Data Serialization:** Component Mesh data must be serializable to allow for easy storage, loading, and sharing.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Mesh Execution):**

```
ComponentMesh mesh = LoadMesh("EnemyAI_Template");
GameObject enemy = InstantiateEnemy();
mesh.AssociateEntity(enemy); // Attach the mesh to the enemy

foreach (ComponentNode node in mesh.Nodes) {
  GameObject componentInstance = InstantiateComponent(node.ComponentType);
  node.Instance = componentInstance;
}

foreach (Edge edge in mesh.Edges) {
  Component source = edge.Source.Instance;
  Component destination = edge.Destination.Instance;
  Script script = edge.Script;

  // Execute script with source and destination as inputs
  script.Execute(source, destination);
}

//Game Loop
while (running) {
  foreach (Edge edge in mesh.Edges) {
    edge.Script.Update(); //Allow dynamic runtime behavior
  }
}
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond static component grouping to create *dynamic systems* defined by relationships.  It provides a high-level abstraction for complex interactions, reducing the need for hand-coded logic and enabling emergent gameplay. It's essentially "programming with connections" instead of code.
