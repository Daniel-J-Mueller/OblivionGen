## Dynamic Bookmark "Layers" & Contextual Expansion

**Concept:** Extend the existing bookmarking system by allowing users to create and manage multiple "layers" of bookmarks, each representing a specific context or purpose.  Furthermore, allow these bookmark layers to dynamically expand *beyond* simple URLs to include contextual data and interactive elements.

**Specs:**

**1. Bookmark Layer Management:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A `BookmarkLayer` object containing:
    *   `layer_id`: Unique identifier for the layer.
    *   `layer_name`: User-defined name for the layer (e.g., "Travel Planning - Italy", "Research - AI Ethics", "Recipes - Vegan").
    *   `layer_description`:  Optional, user-defined description.
    *   `visibility`:  Boolean flag controlling layer visibility.
    *   `bookmark_list`:  Ordered list of `Bookmark` objects.

*   **User Interface:**
    *   A dedicated "Layers" panel within the browser/application.
    *   Ability to create, rename, delete, and reorder layers.
    *   Toggle visibility of individual layers.
    *   Layer import/export functionality (JSON format).

**2. Enhanced Bookmark Object:**

*   Expand the existing `Bookmark` object to include:
    *   `bookmark_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `url`: Standard URL.
    *   `title`: Page title.
    *   `description`: User-defined description.
    *   `tags`: List of user-defined tags.
    *   `context_data`:  A JSON blob capable of storing arbitrary data *associated* with the bookmark.  Examples:
        *   For a travel bookmark:  "hotel_name", "flight_number", "booking_reference".
        *   For a research bookmark:  "paper_author", "publication_date", "key_concepts".
        *   For a recipe bookmark: "prep_time", "cook_time", "ingredients".
    *   `interaction_type`: Enum: `LINK`, `EMBED`, `QUERY`.
        *   `LINK`: Standard URL link.
        *   `EMBED`:  URL points to a resource that can be embedded directly within the expanded bookmark view (e.g., a YouTube video, a Figma design).
        *   `QUERY`:  URL represents a search query. Clicking the bookmark triggers a pre-populated search in a designated service (e.g., Google Scholar, Amazon).

**3. Dynamic Bookmark Rendering:**

*   When a user selects a bookmark layer, the system dynamically renders the bookmarks within that layer.
*   Rendering logic varies based on `interaction_type`.
    *   `LINK`: Standard hyperlink.
    *   `EMBED`:  Embed the resource using an appropriate iFrame or API.
    *   `QUERY`: Generate a link that executes the pre-defined search query.
*   Contextual data from `context_data` is displayed alongside the bookmark (e.g., in a tooltip or expandable panel).

**4. "Smart Layer" Generation (AI Assisted):**

*   Implement an AI-powered feature to automatically generate new layers based on user browsing history and patterns.
*   Algorithm:
    1.  Analyze user browsing data over a defined period.
    2.  Identify clusters of URLs related to a common theme (e.g., using semantic analysis of page content).
    3.  Prompt the user to confirm the theme and create a new layer.
    4.  Populate the layer with relevant bookmarks.

**Pseudocode (Smart Layer Generation):**

```python
def generate_smart_layer(user_history):
  clusters = analyze_browsing_history(user_history)
  for cluster in clusters:
    theme = extract_theme(cluster)
    confirmation = prompt_user("Create a new layer for theme: " + theme + "?")
    if confirmation:
      layer_id = create_layer(theme)
      for url in cluster:
        add_bookmark_to_layer(url, layer_id)
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Project Management:  Layer for research, design assets, meeting notes, etc.
*   Travel Planning: Layer for flights, hotels, activities, restaurants.
*   Personal Finance: Layer for budgeting, investment tracking, bills.
*   Academic Research: Layer for papers, articles, datasets, conferences.
