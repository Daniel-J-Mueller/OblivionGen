## Multi-Spectral Temporal Analysis for Material Identification & Distance

**Concept:** Expand the time-of-flight principle to incorporate multi-spectral light emission and capture, not just for distance, but for *material composition* at a distance. This allows for both accurate distance measurement *and* identification of the surface material properties.

**Specs:**

*   **Light Emitters:** Array of N LEDs emitting at distinct wavelengths across the visible and near-infrared spectrum (e.g., 450nm, 520nm, 610nm, 730nm, 850nm).  Each wavelength is pulsed with a precisely controlled frequency and duty cycle.  LEDs are addressable for sequential or simultaneous emission.
*   **Light Sensor:**  Linear or 2D array of photodetectors with spectral filtering capabilities (e.g., using interference filters or a prism/grating spectrometer).  Each detector is coupled to a storage element (capacitor or analog memory).
*   **Timing & Control:**  High-precision timer/counter module to synchronize LED emission and detector capture.  Microcontroller to manage sequencing, timing, and data acquisition.
*   **Storage:**  Array of storage elements (capacitors or analog memory) mirroring the detector array.  Each element stores the energy captured during a defined time interval for each wavelength. A dedicated storage element is utilized for ambient light capture.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) to read the voltage/charge stored in each storage element. High-speed data bus to transfer data to the processing unit.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Embedded processor (e.g., ARM Cortex-M7) or FPGA for real-time signal processing and data analysis.
*   **Calibration:**  Utilize a known reflectance standard to calibrate the system and establish a spectral library for material identification.

**Operation:**

1.  **Ambient Light Capture:**  Before any emission, capture ambient light levels across all wavelengths and store in dedicated storage elements.
2.  **Sequential Emission:**  Cycle through each wavelength in the LED array.
3.  **Time-of-Flight Capture:** For each wavelength:
    *   Emit a pulse of light.
    *   Begin capturing reflected light using the detector array and storage elements.
    *   Capture energy during a series of time intervals (e.g., T1, T2, T3, T4) defined by the expected distance range. T1 is the shortest interval, and T4 is the longest.
    *   Multiple measurement cycles are performed to improve signal-to-noise ratio.
4.  **Data Processing:**
    *   Subtract the ambient light contribution from the captured signals.
    *   Calculate the ratio of energy captured during different time intervals for each wavelength (similar to the provided patent, but for *multiple* wavelengths).
    *   Employ a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Neural Network) trained on a spectral library to identify the material based on the characteristic reflectance signature across all wavelengths.
    *   Calculate the distance using the time-of-flight data for one or more wavelengths, combined with the machine learning material identification confidence.
5.  **Output:** Provide both distance and material identification.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Constants
NUM_WAVELENGTHS = 5
NUM_TIME_INTERVALS = 4
AMBIENT_CAPTURE_TIME = 100ms
PULSE_CAPTURE_TIME = 500ms

// Data Structures
wavelengthData[NUM_WAVELENGTHS][NUM_TIME_INTERVALS] = 0 //Stores captured light energy

//Initialization
captureAmbientLight()

// Main Loop
for each wavelength in wavelengths:
    emitPulse(wavelength)
    for each timeInterval in timeIntervals:
        captureLight(wavelength, timeInterval)
        wavelengthData[wavelength][timeInterval] = lightCaptured

    // Calculate ratios (similar to provided patent)
    ratio1 = wavelengthData[wavelength][0] / wavelengthData[wavelength][1]
    ratio2 = wavelengthData[wavelength][2] / wavelengthData[wavelength][3]

    // Material Identification (ML Algorithm)
    materialID = identifyMaterial(ratio1, ratio2, wavelength)

    // Distance Calculation (Time of Flight)
    distance = calculateDistance(wavelength, timeOfFlight)

    // Output Results
    print("Wavelength:", wavelength, "Material:", materialID, "Distance:", distance)
