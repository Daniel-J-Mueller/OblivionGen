## Adaptive Content Partitioning via Predictive Proxying

**Concept:** Extend the proxy's function beyond simple URL-based routing to *predict* content security requirements based on user behavior and dynamically adjust routing. This moves beyond static separation of 'secured' vs 'unsecured' portions to a fluid, personalized experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profiler Module:**

*   **Input:** User agent string, request history (URLs accessed, timestamps), geographical location (optional, user-permissioned), time of day.
*   **Processing:** Machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained to predict the likelihood of a content request requiring high security (e.g., payment processing, PII access) vs. general browsing.  Model continuously updated with new user behavior data.
*   **Output:** Security score (0.0 - 1.0) representing the predicted security requirement of the request.

**2. Dynamic Routing Engine:**

*   **Input:** Incoming request, URL, Security Score from Behavioral Profiler.
*   **Processing:**
    *   If Security Score > Threshold (configurable): Route request to the trusted network/application behind the firewall, as in the base patent.
    *   Else If Security Score < Threshold: Route request to the customer-managed application on the untrusted network.
    *   **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the accuracy of security predictions (e.g., by observing user actions like entering payment details after a request) and dynamically adjust the security score threshold to minimize false positives and false negatives.
*   **Output:** Routed request.

**3. Content Tagging & Metadata Enhancement:**

*   **Process:** When content is served from either network, the proxy *tags* the content with metadata indicating which network it originated from and the Security Score used for routing. This data is included in HTTP headers or as a hidden element within the page itself.
*   **Purpose:**  Allows for monitoring and analysis of routing decisions, further refining the Behavioral Profiler model, and providing insights into user behavior.

**4.  Multi-Factor Authentication Integration (Optional):**

*   **Process:** If the Security Score is high, the Dynamic Routing Engine can trigger a multi-factor authentication challenge *before* routing the request to the trusted network. This adds an extra layer of security for sensitive transactions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processRequest(request):
  securityScore = BehavioralProfiler.predict(request)
  threshold = AdaptiveThreshold.getCurrent()

  if securityScore > threshold:
    # High security required
    if MFA_Enabled:
      if MFA_Successful(request):
        routedRequest = routeToTrustedNetwork(request)
      else:
        # MFA Failed - Block or Redirect
        return errorResponse("MFA Failed")
    else:
      routedRequest = routeToTrustedNetwork(request)
  else:
    # Low security - Route to untrusted network
    routedRequest = routeToUntrustedNetwork(request)

  addMetadata(routedRequest, "originNetwork", getNetwork(routedRequest))
  addMetadata(routedRequest, "securityScore", securityScore)

  return routedRequest
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   The Behavioral Profiler module could be implemented as a separate microservice using a machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   The Adaptive Threshold Adjustment algorithm could utilize Bayesian optimization or reinforcement learning.
*   The proxy application would need to be able to handle increased computational load from the Behavioral Profiler and Adaptive Threshold modules.
*   Data storage for user behavior profiles and model training data.
