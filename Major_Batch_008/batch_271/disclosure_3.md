## Adaptive Behavioral Biometrics via Micro-Navigation Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the browser history authentication concept to a continuous behavioral biometric system, focusing on *how* a user navigates within a site, rather than simply *that* they visited specific pages. This moves beyond simple presence detection to active, ongoing authentication.

**Specs:**

1.  **Micro-Navigation Tracking:** Implement Javascript code embedded within the web application to monitor user interactions beyond page loads. Track the following:
    *   **Scroll Depth:** Percentage of page scrolled at specific intervals (e.g., every 2 seconds).
    *   **Mouse Movement:** X/Y coordinates of mouse movements, velocity, acceleration. Differentiate between deliberate movements (clicking, dragging) and idle movements.
    *   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Timestamp and duration of keystrokes within form fields (excluding passwords â€“ focus on general typing rhythm).
    *   **Element Interaction:** Tracking of specific element clicks/hovers (e.g. buttons, links, dropdowns) and the time between interactions.
    *   **Touch Events:** (For mobile/touchscreen users) track swipe direction, velocity, and touch pressure.
2.  **Baseline Profile Creation:**  Upon initial login or during a dedicated "learning phase", collect data from the above interactions to establish a baseline behavioral profile for each user.  This profile is stored server-side as a multi-dimensional vector.
3.  **Real-time Anomaly Detection:**  As the user interacts with the application, continuously collect the interaction data described above. Compare the current interaction data to the user's baseline profile using anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).  
4.  **Risk Scoring:**  Assign a risk score based on the degree of deviation from the baseline profile.  Higher deviation = higher risk score.
5.  **Adaptive Authentication:**
    *   **Low Risk:** User activity aligns closely with the baseline profile. No additional authentication steps required.
    *   **Medium Risk:** Trigger a subtle challenge (e.g., simple CAPTCHA, security question).
    *   **High Risk:** Trigger a more robust authentication method (e.g., multi-factor authentication, biometric verification).  Potentially log out the session.
6. **Data Storage:** Store data in a time-series database for efficient analysis and retrieval.
7. **Server-Side Pseudocode (Risk Calculation):**

```
function calculateRiskScore(currentInteractionData, userBaselineProfile) {
  // Calculate distance/deviation between current interaction data and baseline profile
  deviationScore = calculateDeviation(currentInteractionData, userBaselineProfile);

  // Normalize deviation score to a range of 0-100
  normalizedDeviation = map(deviationScore, minDeviation, maxDeviation, 0, 100);

  // Apply weighting factors to different interaction types (e.g., mouse movement = 30%, keystroke dynamics = 20%)
  weightedDeviation = (0.3 * mouseMovementDeviation) + (0.2 * keystrokeDynamicsDeviation) + ...

  // Risk score calculation (example)
  riskScore = weightedDeviation * 0.7 + outlierDetectionScore * 0.3;

  return riskScore;
}

function outlierDetection(interactionData) {
  // Use Isolation Forest or similar algorithm to detect outliers in interaction data
  outlierScore = ...;
  return outlierScore;
}

function map(value, in_min, in_max, out_min, out_max) {
  return (value - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min;
}
```

8.  **Privacy Considerations:**  Data should be anonymized/pseudonymized whenever possible. Users should be informed about the data collection practices and have the option to opt-out (with reduced functionality).  Data retention policies should be clearly defined and enforced.
