## Delegated Action Chains with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Expand delegation beyond simple permission grants to allow for chained actions with time-limited validity, enabling complex, automated tasks performed *on behalf* of a user, but with built-in safety mechanisms.

**Specification:**

**1. Action Definition Language (ADL):**

*   A structured language (JSON or YAML) to define ‘Actions’. Each Action comprises:
    *   `action_id`: Unique identifier for the action.
    *   `action_type`: Categorization (e.g., "data_export", "report_generation", "system_update").
    *   `parameters`: Input data for the action (e.g., date range for export, report format).
    *   `target_resource`: Specifies the resource the action affects (e.g., database table, file path, API endpoint).
    *   `execution_constraints`:  Limits on execution (e.g., maximum duration, data volume).
    *   `next_action`: `action_id` of the subsequent action in the chain (can be null).
*   ADL allows actions to be composable, creating a ‘delegation workflow’.

**2. Temporal Decay Mechanism:**

*   Each Action within a Delegation Profile has a ‘decay rate’ (e.g., percentage reduction in validity per hour).
*   A ‘validity timestamp’ is associated with each Action.
*   During execution, the system checks the current validity based on the elapsed time since the validity timestamp and the decay rate.
*   If validity falls below a threshold, the action is aborted, and an audit log is generated.

**3. Delegation Profile Extension:**

*   Delegation Profiles are extended to include:
    *   A list of approved ADL Action definitions.
    *   A default decay rate for all Actions within the profile.
    *   Override settings for individual Action decay rates.
*   The validation policy verifies not only the security principal but also the allowed Action definitions and decay settings.

**4. Execution Flow:**

1.  A Security Principal requests execution of a Delegation Profile.
2.  The system retrieves the profile and verifies authorization.
3.  The first Action in the chain is selected.
4.  Validity check is performed. If invalid, execution halts.
5.  Action is executed.
6.  If successful, the system proceeds to the next Action (specified in `next_action`).
7.  Steps 4-6 are repeated until the chain is complete or an error occurs.
8.  All actions and validity checks are logged for auditing.

**Pseudocode (Execution Loop):**

```
function execute_delegation_chain(profile, principal):
    current_action = profile.first_action
    while current_action != null:
        if is_action_valid(current_action, profile.decay_rate):
            result = execute_action(current_action)
            log_action_execution(current_action, result)
            current_action = current_action.next_action
        else:
            log_invalid_action(current_action)
            return FAILURE

    return SUCCESS

function is_action_valid(action, decay_rate):
    elapsed_time = current_time - action.validity_timestamp
    remaining_validity = action.initial_validity * (1 - (elapsed_time / 3600) * decay_rate) # 3600 seconds in an hour
    return remaining_validity > threshold
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Automated data backup with decreasing permissions over time.
*   Temporary access for software updates, revoking privileges after completion.
*   Controlled data sharing with time-limited access rights.
*   Dynamic permission escalation with automated rollback mechanisms.
