## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction & Interactive Product Placement

**Concept:** Extend the image-linking technology to facilitate *augmented reality experiences* directly within existing images and videos. Instead of merely linking *to* product detail pages, dynamically reconstruct a 3D scene from the 2D source material and allow users to *place* virtual products within that reconstructed environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Scene Depth Estimation Module:** Utilize AI-driven depth estimation algorithms (monocular depth estimation, neural radiance fields) to create a basic 3D representation of the scene depicted in the original image/video. This isn't full photogrammetry, but a sufficient approximation for product placement.
*   **Object Segmentation & Masking:** Identify and segment objects within the scene to create "placement zones" – areas where virtual products can be realistically positioned.  Masking prevents virtual objects from clipping through existing elements.
*   **Product Catalog Integration:**  Access a database of 3D product models (format agnostic – OBJ, glTF, USDZ) via API.  Include metadata: dimensions, materials, lighting properties.
*   **Real-time Rendering Engine:**  A lightweight rendering engine optimized for mobile and web, capable of realistically rendering virtual products within the reconstructed scene.  Shadow casting, ambient occlusion, and basic physics simulation are required.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Product Browser:**  A visual interface to browse and select products from the catalog.
    *   **Placement Controls:**  Intuitive controls for positioning, scaling, and rotating virtual products within the scene (touch/mouse input).
    *   **AR Preview:**  A live preview of the augmented scene, potentially integrating with device cameras for a mixed reality experience.
*   **Data Pipeline:**
    1.  Image/Video Input.
    2.  Depth Estimation & Object Segmentation.
    3.  Product Selection (User Input).
    4.  3D Model Retrieval & Transformation.
    5.  Scene Rendering & AR Preview.
*   **Backend Infrastructure:**
    *   Cloud-based storage for 3D models and scene data.
    *   API endpoints for product catalog access and rendering requests.
    *   Scalable processing capacity for depth estimation and rendering.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Rendering Loop):**

```
function renderScene(image, selectedProducts) {

  depthMap = estimateDepth(image);
  objectMasks = segmentObjects(image);

  for each product in selectedProducts {
    productModel = retrieveModel(product.id);
    transformedModel = applyTransform(productModel, product.position, product.rotation, product.scale);
    renderModel(transformedModel, depthMap, objectMasks);
  }

  displayAugmentedImage();
}
```

**Novelty:** The system *doesn’t* just link to products; it dynamically *integrates* them into the original visual content, allowing users to virtually “try out” products within a realistically reconstructed environment.  This extends the core linking concept from a simple navigation tool to an immersive shopping experience.  Existing AR product placement apps typically require a clean surface or dedicated tracking markers. This system functions directly on existing images/videos, unlocking a vast library of potential AR content.
