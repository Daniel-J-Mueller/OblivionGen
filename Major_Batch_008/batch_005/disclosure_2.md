## Dynamic Document Persona System

**Concept:** Extend collaborative document editing by assigning 'personas' to sections of a document. These personas dictate not only formatting and content suggestions (similar to existing style guides) but also *behavioral* aspects of how that section interacts with other sections and collaborators. 

**Specification:**

**I. Persona Definition:**

*   **Data Structure:** A Persona is defined by a JSON object containing:
    *   `name`: String – Human-readable name for the persona (e.g., “Legal Reviewer”, “Marketing Copywriter”, “Technical Illustrator”).
    *   `formattingRules`: Array – Rules for font, size, color, layout, etc. (compatible with existing document formatting standards).
    *   `contentSuggestions`: Array – Suggested phrases, keywords, and data points relevant to the section's topic.
    *   `collaborationRules`: Object – Defines how this section interacts with other sections and collaborators:
        *   `accessControl`: Enum (Read, Write, Comment, Restricted) – Specifies who can modify the section.
        *   `notificationTriggers`: Array – Events that trigger notifications to specific collaborators (e.g., “major content change”, “unresolved comment”).
        *   `autoMergeConflicts`: Boolean – Whether to attempt automatic merging of conflicting edits.
        *   `versioningPolicy`: Enum (Always, Manual, Never) – Specifies how frequently the section is versioned.
        *    `AI_Assistance_Profile`: String – Identifier for an AI profile to provide specialized assistance (e.g., "Legal_FactChecker", "Marketing_ToneAnalyzer").
*   **Persona Library:** A central repository to store and manage pre-defined and custom personas.

**II. Document Integration:**

*   **Section Assignment:** Users can assign personas to individual sections or blocks of content within a document.
*   **Dynamic Styling & Suggestions:** The system automatically applies the formatting rules and content suggestions associated with the assigned persona.
*   **Behavioral Enforcement:** The system enforces the collaboration rules defined by the persona (e.g., preventing unauthorized edits, triggering notifications).

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Document Editor Module:** Core editor interface with persona assignment tools.
2.  **Persona Management Module:** Stores, manages, and allows creation of new personas.
3.  **Collaboration Engine:** Enforces collaboration rules, manages access control, and triggers notifications.
4.  **AI Integration Module:** Interfaces with external AI services based on the `AI_Assistance_Profile` defined in the persona.
5.  **Conflict Resolution Module:** Handles conflicting edits based on the `autoMergeConflicts` setting.

**IV. Pseudocode (Collaboration Engine):**

```
function handleEdit(section, user, changes) {
  persona = getPersona(section);
  if (user.role != persona.accessControl) {
    displayErrorMessage("Insufficient permissions");
    return;
  }
  
  if (conflictsExist(section, changes)) {
    if (persona.autoMergeConflicts) {
      attemptMerge(section, changes);
    } else {
      displayConflictResolutionDialog(section, changes);
    }
  }
  
  applyChanges(section, changes);
  
  triggerNotifications(persona.notificationTriggers, user, changes);
}

function triggerNotifications(triggers, user, changes) {
  for each trigger in triggers {
    if (trigger.event == "major content change" && changes.length > 100) {
      sendNotification(trigger.recipient, "Major content change detected in section.");
    }
  }
}
```

**V. Extension Possibilities:**

*   **AI-Driven Persona Creation:** Automatically generate personas based on document content and user roles.
*   **Dynamic Persona Adjustment:** Adapt personas based on real-time collaboration patterns and user feedback.
*   **Persona Marketplace:** Allow users to share and sell custom personas.
