## Dynamic Temporal Attention for Enhanced Video Prediction

**Concept:** Instead of solely relying on concatenated frames for temporal processing, introduce a dynamic attention mechanism that prioritizes relevant temporal features for each frame during enhancement. This allows the system to focus on motion, changes, and key visual elements, leading to more coherent and realistic video enhancement, particularly for fast-moving scenes or when dealing with compressed/low-bandwidth input.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Temporal Feature Extraction:**
    *   Input: Sequence of lower-resolution frames (F1, F2, ... Fn).
    *   Process: Each frame undergoes feature extraction using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate feature maps (EF1, EF2, ... EFn).
    *   Output: Sequence of feature maps representing temporal features.

2.  **Dynamic Attention Module:**
    *   Input: Sequence of feature maps (EF1, EF2, ... EFn).
    *   Process:
        *   **Self-Attention Layer:** Apply a self-attention mechanism to each feature map to capture intra-frame dependencies.
        *   **Temporal Attention Layer:**  This is the core.  A learned weighting function determines the importance of each previous frame's features for the current frame. This weighting is *dynamic*, meaning it changes based on the content of the current frame. 
            *   Calculate similarity scores between the current frameâ€™s features and the features of all previous frames using a dot product or cosine similarity.
            *   Apply a softmax function to the similarity scores to obtain attention weights.
            *   Perform a weighted sum of the features from previous frames using the attention weights.
        *   **Gating Mechanism:** Introduce a gating mechanism to control the influence of the temporally attended features.  The gate learns to balance the temporally attended features with the original features from the current frame.
    *   Output: Enhanced feature maps with incorporated temporal context.

3.  **Enhancement Network:**
    *   Input: Enhanced feature maps from the Dynamic Attention Module.
    *   Process: Utilize a generator network (similar to the GAN architecture in the provided patent) to upsample the enhanced feature maps and generate a high-resolution enhanced frame.  This network can employ residual connections and skip connections to improve performance and prevent vanishing gradients.
    *   Output: Enhanced high-resolution frame.

4.  **Training:**
    *   Loss Function: Combine a perceptual loss (based on features extracted from a pre-trained CNN, like VGG) with an adversarial loss (from the GAN discriminator) to ensure both realism and perceptual quality. Include a temporal consistency loss that penalizes abrupt changes between frames.
    *   Dataset: Train on a large-scale video dataset with diverse content and resolutions.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Attention Module):**

```
function DynamicAttention(feature_maps):
  attended_features = []
  for i in range(len(feature_maps)):
    current_frame_features = feature_maps[i]
    
    #Calculate attention weights
    similarity_scores = []
    for j in range(i):
        similarity_scores.append(dot_product(current_frame_features, feature_maps[j]))

    attention_weights = softmax(similarity_scores)

    #Weighted sum of past features
    temporal_context = 0
    for j in range(len(attention_weights)):
      temporal_context += attention_weights[j] * feature_maps[j]
    
    # Gating mechanism
    gate = sigmoid(linear_transform(concatenate(current_frame_features, temporal_context)))
    
    attended_features.append(gate * temporal_context + (1-gate) * current_frame_features)
  
  return attended_features
```

**Novelty:**  This approach differs from the patent's temporal processing by introducing a dynamic attention mechanism that learns to prioritize relevant temporal features based on the current frame's content.  The gating mechanism further enhances control over the influence of temporal context. This promises more accurate and visually pleasing video enhancement, particularly for complex scenes.
