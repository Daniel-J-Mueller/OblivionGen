## Dynamic Router Personality Modules

**Concept:** Expand the modular configuration approach to encompass 'personality' profiles for routers – not just *what* they do, but *how* they do it. These personalities dictate behavior beyond basic configuration, impacting traffic prioritization, security responses, and even logging verbosity based on detected network conditions and learned patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Personality Module Structure:**

*   **Module Format:** Standardized archive containing:
    *   `personality.json`:  Defines the personality's name, description, activation triggers, and associated behavior scripts.
    *   `behavior_scripts/`: Directory containing Python (or similar) scripts defining reactive behaviors.
    *   `resource_profiles/`: Defines resource allocation (CPU, memory, bandwidth) for each behavior.
*   **Personality Traits:** Defined in `personality.json`. Examples:
    *   `AggressiveSecurity`: High intrusion detection sensitivity, immediate blocking of suspicious traffic.
    *   `LowLatencyGaming`: Prioritizes UDP traffic, minimizes queueing delays.
    *   `HighThroughputDataCenter`: Optimizes for bulk data transfer, emphasizes bandwidth utilization.
    *   `VerboseLogging`:  Detailed logging of all network events.
    *   `MinimalFootprint`:  Reduces resource consumption for low-power environments.

**2. Router Personality Manager (RPM):**

*   **RPM Component:** Software module residing on the router. Responsible for:
    *   Loading and managing personality modules.
    *   Monitoring network conditions (latency, jitter, packet loss, security threats, application types).
    *   Evaluating activation triggers defined in personality modules.
    *   Dynamically activating/deactivating personality modules based on real-time conditions.
    *   Resource allocation to active personality modules.
*   **Activation Triggers:** Conditions that trigger personality activation. Examples:
    *   `application_type == "gaming"`
    *   `security_threat_level > 7`
    *   `average_latency > 100ms`
    *   `bandwidth_utilization > 90%`
    *   `time_of_day == "peak_hours"`

**3.  Behavior Script Execution:**

*   **Sandboxed Execution:** Behavior scripts run in a secure sandbox environment to prevent malicious code from compromising the router.
*   **API Access:**  Scripts have access to a limited API allowing them to:
    *   Monitor network statistics.
    *   Modify QoS settings.
    *   Adjust firewall rules.
    *   Trigger alerts.
    *   Log events.
*   **Priority Levels:** Each script has a priority level to resolve conflicts when multiple scripts attempt to modify the same settings.

**4.  Dynamic Learning and Adaptation:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning Module:**  Integrate a reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal personality configurations based on network performance metrics.
*   **Feedback Loop:** The agent receives feedback (rewards/penalties) based on the impact of activated personalities on network performance (latency, throughput, security).
*   **Adaptive Configuration:**  The agent adjusts activation triggers and script parameters to optimize network performance over time.

**Pseudocode (RPM – simplified):**

```
function load_personality_module(module_path):
  load module from path
  parse personality.json
  return personality object

function evaluate_triggers(personality, network_state):
  for trigger in personality.triggers:
    if trigger.condition(network_state):
      return True
  return False

function apply_personality(personality):
  for script in personality.scripts:
    execute script in sandbox

function main_loop():
  while True:
    network_state = get_network_state()
    for personality in loaded_personalities:
      if evaluate_triggers(personality, network_state):
        apply_personality(personality)
    sleep(1)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personality Marketplace:** Allow users to create and share custom personality modules.
*   **Automated Personality Generation:** Use AI to generate personality modules based on specified network requirements.
*   **Multi-Personality Support:** Allow multiple personalities to be active simultaneously, each influencing different aspects of router behavior.
