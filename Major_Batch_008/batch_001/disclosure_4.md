## Predictive Duplicate Shipment Prevention & Proactive Route Adjustment

**System Overview:** This system extends the duplicate shipment detection patent by adding a predictive component and integrates with real-time routing data to *prevent* duplicate shipments before they occur, not just detect them after the fact. It leverages machine learning to identify high-risk scenarios and dynamically adjusts shipping routes/processes.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Historical Data Ingestion:**  The system ingests historical shipment data (similar to the provided patent), including destination identifiers, item identifiers, shipment timestamps, routing data (origin, destination, intermediate stops), carrier information, and confirmed duplicate shipment events.
2.  **Real-Time Data Stream:**  A continuous stream of incoming shipment data, including the same fields as the historical data, is captured as packages enter the system.
3.  **Predictive Model (Risk Scoring):** A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on the historical data. This model predicts a “duplicate shipment risk score” for each incoming shipment *before* it leaves the initial processing station.  Features used for prediction include:
    *   Destination identifier (customer/address)
    *   Item identifier(s)
    *   Time of day/day of week
    *   Recent shipment history to that destination (volume, frequency)
    *   Carrier used
    *   Origin facility
    *   Route segment (initial hops)
4.  **Dynamic Route Adjustment Engine:** Based on the risk score:
    *   **Low Risk (Score < Threshold 1):** Shipment proceeds as normal.
    *   **Medium Risk (Threshold 1 <= Score < Threshold 2):** 
        *   Initiate a secondary scan of the package contents at the next processing station to verify against the original order.
        *   Flag the shipment in the system for increased monitoring.
        *   Temporarily adjust the routing algorithm to avoid the same route segment as a recent shipment to the same destination, if possible.
    *   **High Risk (Score >= Threshold 2):**
        *   Immediately halt shipment.
        *   Alert a human operator to investigate the potential duplicate.
        *   Initiate a full order verification process.
5.  **Feedback Loop:**  Confirmed duplicate shipments (identified by the system or through manual investigation) are fed back into the predictive model to continuously improve its accuracy.
6.  **Alerting System:**  Configurable alerts for high-risk shipments, unexpected route changes, and model performance degradation.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Route Adjustment Engine):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustRoute(shipment, riskScore, currentRoute)

  IF riskScore < Threshold1 THEN
    RETURN currentRoute  // No adjustment needed
  ELSE IF riskScore >= Threshold1 AND riskScore < Threshold2 THEN
    // Attempt to find alternative route avoiding recent identical routes
    alternativeRoute = FindAlternativeRoute(currentRoute, shipment.destination, shipment.lastRouteSegment)
    IF alternativeRoute != NULL THEN
      RETURN alternativeRoute
    ELSE
      RETURN currentRoute // Fallback to original route if alternative not found
    ENDIF
  ELSE // riskScore >= Threshold2
    // Halt shipment, alert operator
    HaltShipment(shipment)
    AlertOperator(shipment)
    RETURN NULL // Indicates shipment is halted
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION FindAlternativeRoute(currentRoute, destination, lastRouteSegment)
    // Query routing engine for alternative routes to destination
    // Filter out routes that include lastRouteSegment
    // Return best available alternative route (based on cost, time, etc.)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION HaltShipment(shipment)
    // Mark shipment as halted in system
    // Send signal to physical handling system to stop shipment
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION AlertOperator(shipment)
    // Send notification to operator with shipment details and reason for alert
END FUNCTION

```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Historical Shipment Data (as described in the patent)
*   Real-Time Shipment Data
*   Routing Data (network topology, costs, availability)
*   Confirmed Duplicate Shipment Events (labels for training the predictive model)

**Expected Benefits:**

*   Reduced duplicate shipments and associated costs
*   Improved customer satisfaction
*   Proactive identification of potential shipping issues
*   Enhanced operational efficiency
*   Data-driven optimization of shipping processes
