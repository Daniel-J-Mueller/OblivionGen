## Adaptive Prediction for Pre-Fetch Caching

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic encoding profile adjustment to proactively pre-fetch and cache video segments *before* they are requested, leveraging predicted viewer behavior. Instead of simply reacting to current viewership metrics, the system will *anticipate* viewing patterns and prepare accordingly.

**Specifications:**

*   **Behavioral Data Collection:** Beyond viewer quantity and platform, collect granular data on viewing *patterns*. This includes:
    *   **Segment Request History:** Track which segments users request, in sequence.
    *   **Pause/Rewind/Fast-Forward Actions:** Analyze user interactions to identify points of interest or disinterest.
    *   **Skip Patterns:** Track segments commonly skipped, and by which user segments.
    *   **Time of Day/Week Viewing Trends:** Identify peak viewing times and preferred content.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Implement a prediction engine (potentially a recurrent neural network or Long Short-Term Memory network) trained on the behavioral data. The engine will predict:
    *   **Next Segment Request Probability:** For each user (or user segment), predict the probability of requesting each available segment.
    *   **Segment Dwell Time:** Estimate how long a user will likely view a given segment before pausing, rewinding, or skipping.
*   **Pre-Fetch Cache Management:**
    *   **Dynamic Cache Sizing:** Allocate cache space dynamically based on predicted demand. Segments with high predicted request probability will receive higher priority.
    *   **Tiered Caching:** Implement a tiered caching system (e.g., RAM, SSD, HDD) based on segment request probability. Frequently requested segments will be stored in faster storage.
    *   **Eviction Policy:** Implement an eviction policy that considers both request probability *and* segment dwell time. Segments with low probability and short dwell time will be evicted first.
*   **Encoding Profile Integration:**  Combine the prediction system with the existing encoding profile adjustment.  If the prediction engine forecasts a large influx of viewers, preemptively switch to higher-quality encoding profiles for the predicted segments.
*   **Client-Side Integration:** The client application will receive pre-fetched segments and buffer them intelligently. The application will also transmit user behavior data back to the server for continuous learning and improvement of the prediction model.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine â€“ Simplified):**

```
// Input: User ID, Viewing History, Current Segment
// Output: Probability Distribution over Next Segments

function predictNextSegment(userID, viewingHistory, currentSegment) {

    // 1. Load User Profile (Viewing History, Preferences)
    userProfile = loadUserProfile(userID);

    // 2. Identify Similar Users (Based on Viewing History)
    similarUsers = findSimilarUsers(userProfile);

    // 3. Aggregate Viewing Patterns from Similar Users
    aggregatedPatterns = aggregateViewingPatterns(similarUsers);

    // 4. Calculate Probability Distribution
    probabilityDistribution = calculateProbabilityDistribution(aggregatedPatterns);

    // 5. Incorporate Content Metadata (Genre, Tags, etc.)
    probabilityDistribution = adjustDistributionWithMetadata(probabilityDistribution);

    // 6. Return Probability Distribution
    return probabilityDistribution;
}
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Architecture:** Implement a distributed architecture to handle a large number of users and video segments.
*   **Caching Layers:** Utilize multiple caching layers (e.g., CDN, edge servers) to reduce latency and improve scalability.
*   **Model Optimization:** Optimize the prediction model for speed and efficiency.
*   **Data Partitioning:** Partition the data across multiple servers to improve scalability and performance.
