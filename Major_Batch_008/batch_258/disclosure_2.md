## Adaptive Appliance Profiles & Predictive Maintenance

**Concept:** Expanding beyond simple re-ordering, the system could learn *how* an appliance is used, predict potential failures based on usage patterns, and proactively schedule maintenance or component replacement *before* breakdown. This goes beyond just ‘is the coffee pot on’ to ‘is the coffee pot’s heating element degrading based on power draw fluctuations?’.

**System Specs:**

*   **Enhanced Data Acquisition:** The wall outlet/device needs a higher sampling rate for voltage/current data. Minimum 10 samples/second, ideally 60. Include transient event capture (spikes/drops) beyond average power draw.
*   **On-Device Edge Processing:** Implement a small microcontroller (ESP32 equivalent) within the outlet to perform basic signal processing (FFT, moving averages, peak detection) on the electrical data *before* transmission. Reduces bandwidth needs and latency.
*   **Appliance Signature Library:** A cloud-based database containing ‘normal’ usage profiles for various appliance types (coffee pot, toaster, vacuum cleaner, etc.). These profiles are defined by statistical models of voltage/current waveforms (mean, standard deviation, frequency components).  Profiles are expandable and learnable.
*   **Anomaly Detection Algorithm:** A machine learning model (e.g., Autoencoder, Isolation Forest) running in the cloud to compare the real-time electrical signature of an appliance to its expected profile.  Flags anomalies as ‘potential issue’.
*   **Degradation Modeling:**  Track anomaly frequency and severity over time.  Develop models for component degradation (e.g., heating element resistance increases, motor winding insulation breakdown).
*   **Proactive Maintenance Scheduling:** Based on degradation models, predict time to failure for key components.  Automatically schedule maintenance (e.g., order replacement heating element, schedule service appointment).
*   **User Interface (App):**  Displays appliance health status, predicted time to failure for components, maintenance recommendations, and options for scheduling service or ordering replacements.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Secure, low-power wireless protocol (e.g., Zigbee, Thread) for communication between the outlet and the cloud.

**Pseudocode (Outlet Firmware - Simplified):**

```
loop:
    read_voltage_current()
    timestamp = get_current_time()
    data_buffer.append((timestamp, voltage, current))

    if len(data_buffer) > SAMPLE_WINDOW:
        # Perform basic signal processing (e.g., calculate average power)
        average_power = calculate_average_power(data_buffer)

        # Send data to cloud (securely)
        send_data_to_cloud(average_power)

        data_buffer.clear()
    
    sleep(0.0166666) #~60 Hz sampling
```

**Cloud-Side Logic (Simplified):**

```python
def analyze_data(device_id, power_data):
    # 1. Identify appliance type (based on initial signature or user input)
    appliance_type = get_appliance_type(device_id)
    
    # 2. Load expected usage profile for the appliance
    expected_profile = load_profile(appliance_type)
    
    # 3. Compare real-time data to expected profile
    anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(power_data, expected_profile)
    
    # 4. Update appliance health status and degradation model
    update_health_status(device_id, anomaly_score)
    update_degradation_model(device_id, anomaly_score)
    
    # 5. If necessary, trigger maintenance recommendations or order replacements
    if degradation_model_predicts_failure(device_id):
        schedule_maintenance(device_id)
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple re-ordering by introducing predictive maintenance and component-level health monitoring. Existing systems focus on quantity remaining, not appliance *condition*. This enables a shift from reactive repair to proactive maintenance, reducing downtime and extending appliance lifespan.
