## Dynamic Policy Shadowing with Simulated User Cohorts

**Concept:** Extend the provisional policy evaluation system to include simulated user cohorts interacting with the policies in a pre-production environment. This allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of policy impact *before* live deployment, moving beyond simple request/response evaluations.

**Specs:**

**1. Cohort Definition Module:**

*   **Input:** User persona data (demographics, access patterns, typical request profiles).  This data could be sourced from anonymized production logs, market research, or defined by policy administrators.
*   **Process:**  Generates simulated user cohorts (e.g., “Power Users,” “Read-Only Analysts,” “New Employees”).  Each cohort is defined by a probability distribution of request types and frequencies.
*   **Output:**  A library of simulated user cohorts, each represented as a probabilistic model of user behavior.

**2. Policy Shadowing Engine:**

*   **Input:** Active policy, provisional policy, simulated user cohort.
*   **Process:**
    *   For a defined period (e.g., 24 hours of simulated activity), the engine generates requests based on the chosen cohort's behavior.
    *   Each request is evaluated *concurrently* against both the active and provisional policies.
    *   The engine records key metrics:
        *   Authorization decisions (allowed/denied).
        *   Latency for policy evaluation.
        *   Resource consumption (simulated).
        *   User experience metrics (e.g., task completion rate – simulated).
*   **Output:** A detailed report comparing the performance and impact of the active and provisional policies across the simulated user cohort. Metrics should be visualized for easy comparison.

**3.  Risk Scoring & Rollback Mechanism:**

*   **Input:**  Shadowing report, pre-defined risk thresholds.
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculates a risk score for the provisional policy based on the shadowing results (e.g., increased denial rates, significant latency increases, negative impact on simulated user experience).
    *   If the risk score exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the provisional policy is flagged for review.
    *   Includes an automated rollback mechanism: If a critical risk threshold is met, the system can automatically revert to the active policy *before* live deployment.
*   **Output:**  Risk assessment report, automated rollback action (if necessary).

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Define User Cohort
class UserCohort:
    def __init__(self, persona, request_distribution):
        self.persona = persona
        self.request_distribution = request_distribution # Probability distribution of request types

    def generate_request(self):
        # Sample a request type from the request_distribution
        request_type = sample(self.request_distribution)
        # Generate request details based on request_type
        request_details = generate_details(request_type)
        return request_details
