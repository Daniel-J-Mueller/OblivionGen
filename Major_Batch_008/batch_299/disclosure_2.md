## Key-Based Data Provenance & Dynamic Watermarking

**Concept:** Leverage cryptographic key metadata (inspired by the logging/mutability properties in the provided patent) to embed provenance information *directly within* encrypted data. This goes beyond simple audit logs; the data itself carries verifiable proof of its origin, transformations, and authorized usage.  Expand the concept of mutability to include dynamic watermarking – changing the watermark itself based on authorized access and usage conditions.

**Specs:**

**1. Key Generation & Metadata Extension:**

*   **Provenance Profile:**  During key generation, incorporate a "Provenance Profile" alongside logging/mutability values. This profile defines:
    *   **Originator ID:**  Unique identifier of the data's creator.
    *   **Transformation Chain:**  Allowed sequences of transformations (e.g., compression, resizing, format conversion). Each transformation is defined by a cryptographic hash of the transformation function itself.
    *   **Access Conditions:**  Requirements for authorized access (e.g., specific user roles, time windows, geographical location).
    *   **Watermark Seed:** Initial seed for a dynamic watermark generator.
    *   **Mutability Rules:** Granular control over what aspects of the provenance profile are modifiable and by whom.
*   **Key Format:** Extend existing key formats (e.g., PKCS#8) to accommodate the Provenance Profile.
*   **Key Management System (KMS) Integration:** KMS must support generating, storing, and enforcing the Provenance Profile.

**2. Encryption & Watermarking Process:**

*   **Data Encryption:**  Encrypt data using the generated key.
*   **Watermark Generation:**  Simultaneously, generate a dynamic watermark based on:
    *   The Watermark Seed from the Provenance Profile.
    *   The current access context (user, time, location). This context is cryptographically bound to the watermark.
    *   A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) seeded by the key itself.
*   **Watermark Embedding:**  Embed the watermark directly into the encrypted data stream. Methods include:
    *   **Bit Plane Complexity Segmentation (BPCS):**  Modify least significant bits within the encrypted data.
    *   **Encryption Parameter Modulation:**  Slightly adjust encryption parameters (e.g., IV, salt) to encode watermark information. This approach is particularly suited for symmetric encryption.
*   **Provenance Tag:** Create a digital signature (using the key) that encapsulates the Provenance Profile, current transformations applied, and the watermark hash. Attach this tag to the encrypted data.

**3. Data Access & Verification:**

*   **Access Control:**  Before decryption, verify that the user/system meets the Access Conditions specified in the Provenance Profile.
*   **Provenance Verification:**  Verify the digital signature of the Provenance Tag to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
*   **Watermark Extraction & Validation:** Extract the watermark from the decrypted data.  Validate that:
    *   The watermark is consistent with the user’s access context.
    *   The watermark hash matches the hash in the Provenance Tag.
    *   No unauthorized transformations have been applied (by comparing the transformation chain in the Provenance Profile with the actual transformations performed).

**Pseudocode (Access Control & Verification):**

```
function verifyData(encryptedData, provenanceTag, userContext):
  key = extractKeyFromProvenanceTag(provenanceTag)
  provenanceProfile = extractProvenanceProfileFromProvenanceTag(provenanceTag)

  if not userMeetsAccessConditions(userContext, provenanceProfile.accessConditions):
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  if not verifySignature(encryptedData, provenanceTag, key):
    return DATA_TAMPERED

  watermark = extractWatermark(encryptedData)
  expectedWatermark = generateWatermark(provenanceProfile.watermarkSeed, userContext)

  if not compareWatermarks(watermark, expectedWatermark):
    return WATERMARK_INVALID

  # Check Transformation Chain (Implementation detail)
  # ...

  return DATA_VALID
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Digital Rights Management (DRM):**  Control access to copyrighted content with fine-grained permissions and traceable usage.
*   **Secure Data Sharing:**  Enable secure collaboration with verifiable provenance and limited data access.
*   **Supply Chain Integrity:**  Track the origin and transformations of sensitive materials.
*   **Medical Records:**  Ensure the authenticity and privacy of patient data.
