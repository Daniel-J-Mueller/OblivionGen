## Dynamic Register Masking & Predictive Fault Isolation

**Concept:** Leverage the notification system to *actively* mask off failing or unstable register blocks within the integrated circuit *before* a complete failure occurs, and predict potential issues based on notification patterns.  This moves beyond simple health monitoring to proactive circuit stabilization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Register Block Mapping & Mask Database:**

*   The microcontroller maintains a database mapping each register to a “block” (a logical grouping – e.g., a functional unit, a memory controller).
*   Each block has associated mask bits.  Setting a mask bit disables write access to all registers within that block.
*   The database is configurable via the remote management server. Initial configuration can be based on known weak points of the IC design.

**2. Notification Pattern Analysis Module:**

*   Runs on the microcontroller.
*   Receives notification messages (error, event, performance data).
*   Implements a rolling window (configurable length) for notification analysis.
*   Tracks frequency of notifications associated with specific blocks (determined by register mapping).
*   Employs a configurable weighting system for different notification types (e.g., error notifications have higher weight).
*   Calculates a “block health score” based on weighted notification frequency within the rolling window.

**3. Dynamic Masking Engine:**

*   Monitors block health scores.
*   If a block health score falls below a configurable threshold, the Dynamic Masking Engine automatically sets the corresponding mask bits in the Register Block Mapping.  This effectively disables write access to the potentially failing block.
*   The change is logged in a notification message and communicated to the remote management server.
*   A "cooldown" period is configurable.  After a set time with no further problematic notifications, the mask can be automatically removed (or require server approval).

**4. Predictive Fault Isolation (PFI) Module:**

*   Runs on the remote management server (or a dedicated analysis node).
*   Receives historical notification data and masking event logs from multiple ICs.
*   Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series analysis, anomaly detection) to identify patterns that *precede* masking events.
*   Generates predictive alerts: “IC X is exhibiting patterns similar to those observed before block Y failed in IC Z. Consider preemptively masking block Y.”

**Pseudocode (Microcontroller – Dynamic Masking Engine):**

```
// Configurable parameters
THRESHOLD = 0.7  // Block health score threshold
COOLDOWN_PERIOD = 60 // Seconds

// Data structures
blockHealthScores[BLOCK_COUNT]  // Array of scores
maskBits[BLOCK_COUNT] // Array of mask bits

function updateBlockHealth(blockId, notificationType, weight) {
  blockHealthScores[blockId] += weight
}

function processNotification(notificationMessage) {
  blockId = notificationMessage.getBlockId()
  notificationType = notificationMessage.getType()
  weight = getNotificationWeight(notificationType)
  updateBlockHealth(blockId, notificationType, weight)
}

function checkAndMask() {
  for (i = 0; i < BLOCK_COUNT; i++) {
    if (blockHealthScores[i] < THRESHOLD && !maskBits[i]) {
      // Mask the block
      setRegisterBlockMask(i, TRUE)
      maskBits[i] = TRUE
      logMaskingEvent(i)
      sendNotificationToRemoteServer(i, "Block masked due to low health score")
    }
  }
}

function cooldownCheck() {
  // Check if masked blocks have been stable for COOLDOWN_PERIOD
  // If stable, potentially remove mask (with server approval)
}

loop:
  processNotification(nextNotification())
  checkAndMask()
  cooldownCheck()
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased system stability and uptime.
*   Reduced risk of catastrophic failures.
*   Proactive identification and mitigation of potential issues.
*   Improved diagnostic capabilities.
*   Data for optimizing IC design and manufacturing processes.
