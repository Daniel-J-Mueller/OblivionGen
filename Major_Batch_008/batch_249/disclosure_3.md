## Dynamic Key Rotation with Temporal Access Windows

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically rotating table encryption keys, not just on master key revocation, but on a scheduled basis or in response to detected anomalous access patterns. Couple this with *temporal access windows* – allowing decryption only during specific, pre-defined timeframes.

**Components:**

*   **Key Rotation Engine:** A service responsible for generating new table encryption keys. This engine utilizes a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG).
*   **Temporal Access Manager:** Controls decryption access based on time windows. Stores window definitions (start time, end time) associated with each table.
*   **Encrypted Data Blocks:** Tables are segmented into encrypted data blocks. Each block is encrypted with a specific version of the table encryption key. Metadata associated with each block indicates the key version used for encryption and the valid temporal window.
*   **Access Proxy:** Intercepts all data access requests. Verifies that the current time falls within the valid temporal window for the requested data block *before* attempting decryption. If outside the window, access is denied.
*   **Key Version History:**  A secure, append-only log recording all key versions generated and their associated timeframes.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Encryption:** When a table is first created, a table encryption key is generated and used to encrypt the data.  The initial key version and a default temporal window are recorded.
2.  **Key Rotation:**  The Key Rotation Engine periodically (or on-demand) generates new table encryption keys. 
    *   New data blocks are encrypted with the new key.
    *   Old data blocks are *not* re-encrypted immediately. Instead, the key version history is updated to indicate that both the old and new keys are valid for the table.
3.  **Access Request:**
    *   The Access Proxy intercepts a data access request.
    *   It retrieves the relevant data block's metadata.
    *   It checks the current time against the valid temporal window(s) associated with the block's key version(s).
    *   If the current time is within a valid window, the Access Proxy retrieves the correct key version and initiates decryption.
    *   If no valid window exists, access is denied.
4.  **Key Purging:** After a configurable grace period, old key versions are purged. The system must ensure no data blocks still rely on the purged key before deletion.  This purging process *must* be auditable.
5. **Anomaly Detection Integration**: Integrate with a system which detects anomalous access patterns. Upon detection, shorten temporal access windows, or even encrypt all blocks with a new key immediately.

**Pseudocode (Access Proxy – Simplified):**

```
function handleDataAccessRequest(dataBlock):
    metadata = dataBlock.getMetadata()
    validKeyVersions = metadata.getKeyVersions()
    
    for keyVersion in validKeyVersions:
        temporalWindow = keyVersion.getTemporalWindow()
        currentTime = getCurrentTime()
        
        if currentTime >= temporalWindow.startTime and currentTime <= temporalWindow.endTime:
            key = getKeyFromSecureStorage(keyVersion.keyId)
            decryptedData = decryptData(dataBlock.encryptedData, key)
            return decryptedData
    
    log("Access Denied: No valid temporal window found")
    return AccessDeniedError
```

**Rationale:** This approach provides several benefits:

*   **Enhanced Security:**  Even if a key is compromised, the attacker has a limited time window to exploit it.
*   **Reduced Re-Encryption Overhead:**  Not all data needs to be re-encrypted with every key rotation.
*   **Fine-Grained Access Control:**  Temporal windows allow for time-based access restrictions.
* **Dynamic Adaptation**: Responds to threats in real-time, adjusting access windows as needed.
