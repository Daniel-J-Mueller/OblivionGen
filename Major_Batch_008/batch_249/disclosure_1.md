## Autonomous Workspace Reconfiguration System

**Core Concept:** Extend the fiducial-based navigation system to enable *dynamic* workspace reconfiguration via mobile robotic platforms, not just item transport. This goes beyond simply moving items *within* a fixed space; it's about *changing* the space itself.

**Specifications:**

*   **Platform:** A fleet of small, mobile robotic platforms (designated “Nodes”). Each Node is approximately 30cm x 30cm x 15cm and capable of supporting a payload of 5kg.
*   **Connectivity:** Nodes communicate wirelessly using a mesh network.  Each Node acts as a repeater, extending network coverage across the workspace.
*   **Actuation:** Each Node has four independently controlled wheels for omnidirectional movement, and a magnetic/mechanical locking mechanism on its top surface. This locking mechanism can securely attach to standardized "Workspace Elements".
*   **Workspace Elements:** Modular components designed to be attached to Nodes. These include:
    *   Work surfaces (small desktops, shelving)
    *   Lighting fixtures
    *   Small displays
    *   Dividers/Screens
    *   Power/Data conduits
*   **Fiducial System Integration:** The existing fiducial grid serves as the foundational navigation and localization system.  However, new fiducial types are added:
    *   **Configuration Fiducials:**  These designate *target locations* for Workspace Elements.  They indicate both position *and* orientation.
    *   **Element ID Fiducials:**  Each Workspace Element has a unique ID encoded within a fiducial.  This allows the system to track element types and configurations.
*   **Central Control System (CCS):** A software platform responsible for:
    *   Receiving configuration requests (e.g., "Create a two-person workstation near window A").
    *   Path planning for Nodes.
    *   Allocation of Workspace Elements to Nodes.
    *   Collision avoidance.
    *   Real-time monitoring of Node positions and Element configurations.
*   **User Interface (UI):** A drag-and-drop interface allowing users to visually design workspace layouts. The UI translates layouts into configuration requests for the CCS.

**Pseudocode (CCS - Configuration Request Handling):**

```
function HandleConfigRequest(layoutRequest):
  // layoutRequest contains desired workspace configuration
  
  // 1. Parse layoutRequest to identify required Workspace Elements and their target locations
  requiredElements = ExtractElements(layoutRequest)
  targetLocations = ExtractLocations(layoutRequest)

  // 2. Determine available Nodes
  availableNodes = GetAvailableNodes()

  // 3. Allocate Workspace Elements to Nodes
  allocationPlan = AllocateElements(requiredElements, availableNodes)

  // 4. Calculate optimal paths for each Node to its target location
  paths = CalculatePaths(allocationPlan, targetLocations)

  // 5. Issue movement commands to Nodes
  for each (node, path) in paths:
    SendMovementCommand(node, path)

  // 6. Monitor Node progress and handle collisions
  MonitorNodeProgress(paths)
  HandleCollisions()
```

**Novelty/Differentiation:** This system moves beyond simple material handling to enable truly *dynamic* workspaces. Instead of just transporting items, it allows the workspace itself to be reconfigured on-demand, adapting to changing needs and workflows. The integration of fiducial-based navigation with modular elements and a central control system creates a flexible, intelligent, and responsive workspace environment. It isn’t about robots *in* a workspace, it’s robots *as* the workspace.
