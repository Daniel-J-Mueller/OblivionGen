## Dynamic Data Structure Weighting for Outlier Scores

**Concept:** Extend the outlier detection system by dynamically weighting the contribution of different data structures (like random cut trees) to the final outlier score based on their recent predictive performance. This adapts to evolving data streams and provides more accurate outlier detection.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Structure Pool:** Maintain a pool of *N* random cut trees (or other relevant data structures). These trees will be used for outlier scoring.
2.  **Scoring Phase:** For each incoming data record:
    *   Compute an outlier score from each tree in the pool (using existing methods – e.g., potential insertion location).
    *   Combine these individual scores into a weighted average to produce a final outlier score for the record.
3.  **Weighting Mechanism:**
    *   Assign each tree an initial weight (e.g., 1/N).
    *   Periodically (or after a certain number of records), evaluate the performance of each tree. Performance can be measured in several ways:
        *   **Consistency:** How often does a tree flag the *same* record as an outlier as other trees?
        *   **False Positive Rate:** How often does a tree incorrectly flag a normal record as an outlier? (Requires ground truth or labeling, potentially via human review or a secondary validation system).
        *   **Prediction Accuracy:** (If ground truth is available).
    *   Adjust the weight of each tree based on its performance. Use a learning rate to prevent drastic weight changes.
        *   `weight_new = weight_old + learning_rate * (performance_metric - average_performance)`
        *   Normalize the weights after each update to ensure they sum to 1.
4.  **Tree Replacement:** Implement a mechanism to periodically replace poorly performing trees with new, randomly initialized trees. This ensures the pool adapts to long-term changes in the data stream.
    *   Track a “staleness” metric for each tree (e.g., time since last significant contribution to outlier detection).
    *   Replace trees with high staleness.
5.  **Adaptive Learning Rate:** Dynamically adjust the learning rate based on the stability of the data stream.
    *   Monitor the variance of outlier scores.
    *   Reduce the learning rate if the variance is high (indicating a rapidly changing data stream).
    *   Increase the learning rate if the variance is low (indicating a stable data stream).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
N = Number of trees in pool
trees = Array of N random cut trees
weights = Array of N weights (initialized to 1/N)
learning_rate = Initial learning rate
staleness_threshold = Threshold for tree replacement

// For each incoming record:
scores = Array of outlier scores (one from each tree)
final_score = Weighted average of scores using weights

// Periodically:
Evaluate performance of each tree (consistency, false positive rate, etc.)
For each tree:
    performance = Evaluate performance
    weights[tree] = weights[tree] + learning_rate * (performance - average_performance)
Normalize weights
For each tree:
    If tree.staleness > staleness_threshold:
        Replace tree with new random cut tree
        Reset staleness

// Adaptive Learning Rate
Calculate variance of outlier scores
If variance > threshold:
    Reduce learning_rate
Else:
    Increase learning_rate
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   This system will require more computational resources than a single random cut tree implementation. Consider parallelization and efficient data structures.
*   The learning rate and staleness threshold are tunable parameters that need to be optimized for the specific data stream.
*   Monitoring the performance of the system (e.g., outlier detection accuracy, computational cost) is crucial for ensuring it is effective.
