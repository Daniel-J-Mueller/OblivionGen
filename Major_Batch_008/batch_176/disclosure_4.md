## Adaptive Workload Sharding with Predictive Latency

**Concept:** Extend the commit latency monitoring to *proactively* shard workloads across database partitions *before* latency thresholds are breached, based on predicted future latency. This shifts from reactive postponement to proactive distribution, reducing overall system stress and improving responsiveness.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Latency Engine:**

*   **Data Input:** Historical commit latency data for each database partition (as in the base patent). Additionally, ingest workload characteristics (e.g., transaction type, data size, user activity patterns) and system resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).
*   **Model:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict commit latency for each partition over a short horizon (e.g., 5-15 seconds). The model should be retrained frequently (e.g., every minute) with the latest data.
*   **Output:** Predicted commit latency for each partition, along with a confidence interval.

**2. Dynamic Workload Sharding Module:**

*   **Work Item Categorization:** Classify incoming work items based on resource requirements and dependencies (similar to Claim 2).
*   **Partition Selection:** Instead of assigning work items to a 'default' partition, use the predicted latency data to select the partition with the *lowest predicted latency* for that particular work item category. Consider the confidence interval â€“ prioritize partitions with lower uncertainty.
*   **Sharding Strategy:**
    *   **Weighted Randomization:** Assign a probability weight to each partition based on its predicted latency and confidence. Work items are assigned randomly, but with a bias towards lower-latency partitions.
    *   **Consistent Hashing:** Employ consistent hashing to map work item categories to database partitions. The hash function can be dynamically adjusted based on predicted latency.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor actual commit latency after assignment. If actual latency deviates significantly from the prediction, adjust the sharding strategy and retrain the predictive model.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Latency Monitoring Service:** (Existing from the base patent) Collects and stores commit latency data.
*   **Predictive Latency Engine:** Runs continuously, consuming data from the Latency Monitoring Service and generating latency predictions.
*   **Dynamic Workload Sharding Module:** Intercepts incoming work items, consults the Predictive Latency Engine, and assigns work items to appropriate database partitions.
*   **Work Item Queue:** A distributed queue that handles the routing of work items to the assigned database partitions.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Workload Sharding Module):**

```
function assign_work_item(work_item):
  category = categorize_work_item(work_item)
  predicted_latencies = get_predicted_latencies(category) // Returns list of (partition_id, predicted_latency, confidence)
  
  // Filter out partitions exceeding a hard latency limit (safety net)
  valid_partitions = filter(valid_partitions, lambda p: p.predicted_latency < MAX_LATENCY)

  if not valid_partitions:
    // If all partitions are overloaded, fallback to random assignment or postponement
    assign_randomly(work_item)
    return

  // Calculate weights based on predicted latency and confidence
  weights = [1 / (p.predicted_latency * (1 + p.confidence)) for p in valid_partitions]
  total_weight = sum(weights)
  probabilities = [w / total_weight for w in weights]
  
  // Select partition based on weighted random choice
  selected_partition = weighted_choice(probabilities)

  route_work_item(work_item, selected_partition)

```

**4.  Configuration Parameters:**

*   `MAX_LATENCY`:  Absolute maximum acceptable latency for any partition.
*   `PREDICTION_HORIZON`:  Length of the prediction horizon for the Predictive Latency Engine.
*   `RETRAINING_INTERVAL`:  Frequency of retraining the Predictive Latency Engine.
*   `SHARDING_WEIGHT_FACTOR`:  Parameter to control the influence of latency on the sharding decision.
