## Adaptive Hardware Root of Trust with Dynamic Bus Isolation

**Concept:** Extend the bus snooping approach to establish a dynamically configurable hardware root of trust. Instead of *only* detecting anomalies, proactively isolate compromised components by physically disconnecting them from critical buses. This isn't about halting processors – it’s about surgically removing faulty parts *while the system continues operation*, albeit in a degraded but secure state.

**Specifications:**

*   **Root of Trust Module (RTM):** A physically separate, tamper-resistant hardware module connected to all critical buses (PCIe, memory bus, etc.). This is the central authority.
*   **Bus Tap Network:** Implement a dense network of non-intrusive bus taps at strategic points on all critical buses.  These taps don’t interrupt signal flow normally.
*   **Dynamic Isolation Switches:**  Implement high-speed, electronically controlled physical switches in series with each bus tap. These switches are controlled by the RTM. Think of them as micro-scale circuit breakers for buses.  Each switch corresponds to a specific device or bus segment.
*   **RTM Firmware:**
    *   **Baseline Establishment:** On boot, the RTM establishes a known-good baseline of bus activity for each device.  This could involve monitoring data transfer rates, transaction types, and data patterns.
    *   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** A sophisticated anomaly detection engine running on the RTM. This engine analyzes bus traffic in real-time, looking for deviations from the established baseline. It uses a combination of signature-based and behavioral analysis.
    *   **Isolation Policy Engine:** Defines rules for isolating compromised components.  Rules can be based on anomaly severity, device type, or other criteria.  Isolation can range from throttling bandwidth to complete disconnection.
    *   **Self-Healing/Reconfiguration:** The RTM monitors the health of the isolation switches themselves. It includes redundant switches and automatic failover mechanisms.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A secure, authenticated communication channel between the RTM, the hypervisor (if present), and potentially external management systems.
*   **Event Logging & Reporting:** Detailed logging of all anomaly detections and isolation events. Reports can be generated for security analysis and auditing.

**Pseudocode (RTM Firmware - Anomaly Detection & Isolation):**

```
// Initialize baseline for each device connected to the bus
for each device in devices:
  establish_baseline(device)

while (system running):
  for each bus_transaction in bus:
    device = get_device_from_transaction(bus_transaction)
    anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(bus_transaction, device.baseline)
    if anomaly_score > threshold:
      // Potential compromise detected
      isolation_policy = get_isolation_policy(device, anomaly_score)
      if isolation_policy == "isolate":
        activate_isolation_switch(device)  // Physically disconnect the device
        log_event("Device isolated: " + device.name)
      else if isolation_policy == "throttle":
        set_bandwidth_limit(device, throttled_bandwidth)
        log_event("Device throttled: " + device.name)
  // Periodic health check of isolation switches
  check_switch_health()
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond detection and response. It provides a *proactive*, *physical* layer of security. It allows the system to continue functioning even in the face of compromise, by surgically removing the infected parts. This differs from halting processors which represents total system failure. It's a true "segment and conquer" approach to security.
