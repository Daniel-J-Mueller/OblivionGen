## Dynamic Key Segmentation for Multi-Dimensional Data

**Concept:** Extend the partial key hashing concept to allow for *dynamic* segmentation of the key itself based on data type and cardinality. Instead of a fixed portion or delimiter, the hash function intelligently analyzes the key components and prioritizes the most discriminating portions for hashing, effectively creating a multi-dimensional hash space.

**Specification:**

**1. Key Structure & Metadata:**

*   Keys are structured as a series of `<field_name>:<field_value>` pairs.  Example: `user_id:12345,product_id:67890,timestamp:20241027100000`.
*   Each `field_name` is associated with metadata stored centrally (or distributed via a consistent hashing scheme separate from the data keys). This metadata includes:
    *   `data_type`: (integer, string, date, etc.)
    *   `cardinality`: (estimated number of unique values for this field)
    *   `weight`: (initial weighting, modifiable via system learning, representing relative importance for hashing – default 1.0)

**2. Dynamic Hash Function:**

*   Input: Full key string, field metadata.
*   Process:
    1.  Parse key into `<field_name>:<field_value>` pairs.
    2.  For each pair:
        *   Retrieve field metadata.
        *   Calculate a "discrimination score" for the field: `discrimination_score = cardinality * weight`.
    3.  Sort fields by `discrimination_score` in descending order.
    4.  Select the top ‘N’ fields (N is a configurable parameter) for hashing.
    5.  Concatenate the values of the selected fields.
    6.  Apply a standard hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to the concatenated string.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def dynamic_hash(key_string, metadata_lookup, N):
    fields = key_string.split(',')
    field_scores = []

    for field in fields:
        name, value = field.split(':')
        metadata = metadata_lookup.get(name)
        if metadata:
            score = metadata['cardinality'] * metadata['weight']
            field_scores.append((name, score))

    field_scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    selected_fields = [field[0] for field in field_scores[:N]]

    concat_value = ""
    for field in selected_fields:
        for f in fields:
            n, v = f.split(":")
            if n == field:
                concat_value += v
                break
    
    hash_value = hash(concat_value) # or SHA-256 etc.

    return hash_value
```

**3. Metadata Learning & Adaptation:**

*   Implement a feedback loop to automatically adjust field weights.
*   Monitor hash collisions. If collisions are high for a particular field, *decrease* its weight. If collisions are low, *increase* its weight.
*   Periodically re-calculate cardinality estimates based on observed data.

**4. System Integration:**

*   Centralized Metadata Store: Manage field metadata.  Ensure high availability and consistency.
*   Hashing Service:  Encapsulate the dynamic hashing logic.  Provide an API for data storage nodes to generate hash values.
*   Data Storage Nodes:  Store data and keymap information, using the hash values generated by the hashing service.



This approach allows the system to automatically adapt to changing data distributions and optimize hash space utilization.  By prioritizing the most discriminating key fields, it minimizes collisions and improves data retrieval performance.
