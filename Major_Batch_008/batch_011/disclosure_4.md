## Adaptive Acoustic Stencil

**Concept:** Utilizing phased microphone arrays and real-time waveform analysis, create a localized “acoustic stencil” – a dynamically shaped zone of silence or modified sound – around a user’s head or a designated area. This builds *on* the latency/waveform comparison described in the patent, but shifts the goal from simple wake-word detection to *active* sound manipulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum 8, ideally 16+ MEMS microphones arranged in a hemispherical or spherical array integrated into a wearable (headband, collar, hat) or a static device (desk lamp, ceiling fixture).
    *   High-speed digital signal processor (DSP) with dedicated hardware for FFT, beamforming, and waveform manipulation.
    *   Multiple miniature, wide-bandwidth speakers distributed around the array to emit counter-phase audio signals.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to track head/device orientation for accurate beamforming and stencil adaptation.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    1.  **Baseline Capture:** Initial system calibration involving capturing a "silent" baseline of ambient sound using the microphone array. This establishes a profile of the environment.
    2.  **Head/Zone Tracking:** IMU data used to establish and maintain a 3D model of the user’s head (or defined zone). This model is dynamic, adapting to movements.
    3.  **Acoustic Mapping:** Real-time analysis of incoming audio waveforms via the microphone array. FFT performed to decompose sounds into frequency components. Beamforming techniques pinpoint the direction and distance of sound sources.
    4.  **Stencil Generation:** The core algorithm.
        *   Based on acoustic mapping data, identify sound sources falling *within* the designated stencil area (around the head/zone).
        *   Calculate the inverse waveform for those identified sounds. The latency comparison aspect of the source patent is *crucial* here – it allows accurate phase inversion even with complex audio.
        *   Emit the inverse waveform via the distributed speakers, aiming to cancel out the identified sounds *within* the stencil.
        *   Algorithm dynamically adjusts speaker volume and direction to optimize cancellation across the stencil area, compensating for head movement and changing soundscapes.
    5.  **Adaptive Filtering:** A secondary filter to address residual noise or artifacts resulting from the cancellation process.
    6.  **Customization Profiles:** User-defined profiles for stencil shape, cancellation intensity, and sound filtering. Profiles can be tailored to specific environments (noisy office, quiet library).
    7. **Sound 'Shaping':** Beyond just silencing, the system can *shape* sound, for example, attenuating high frequencies to reduce harshness, or emphasizing certain frequencies for improved clarity.

*   **Pseudocode (Stencil Generation):**

```
function generate_stencil(audio_data, head_position, ambient_profile):
  sound_sources = identify_sound_sources(audio_data, head_position) // Beamforming, FFT
  for each source in sound_sources:
    if source.position within head_zone:
      latency = calculate_latency(source.wave_form, ambient_profile) // Waveform comparison (like patent)
      inverse_wave = invert_wave_form(source.wave_form, latency)
      emit_sound(inverse_wave, source.position)
  apply_adaptive_filter()
  return
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Enhanced focus and concentration in noisy environments.
    *   Private communication zones (creating a “bubble” of silence).
    *   Improved audio conferencing and voice calls.
    *   Augmented reality applications (localized soundscapes).
    *   Noise cancellation for individuals with sensory sensitivities.
