## Dynamic Item ‘Completeness’ Scoring & Collaborative ‘Data Quests’

**Concept:** Expand the system’s data deficit identification beyond static thresholds. Introduce a dynamic scoring system reflecting item ‘completeness’ based on user contribution *velocity* and *diversity*, then gamify data contribution through collaborative ‘Data Quests.’

**Specs:**

**1. Completeness Score Engine:**

*   **Input:** Item ID, User ID, Data Type (accessory photo, tag, manual, etc.), Timestamp of submission.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Initial Score:**  Each item starts with a base 'Completeness Score' of 0.
    *   **Contribution Weighting:** Each Data Type has a configurable ‘Weight’ (e.g., Accessory Photo = 0.2, User Tag = 0.1, Manual = 0.5).
    *   **Velocity Factor:** Score increases based on the *rate* of contribution for a given data type over time.  Recent contributions have higher impact. Use an exponential decay function. `Velocity_Score = Σ (Weight * e^(-Δt))` where Δt is the time since the contribution and the summation is over all contributions for that item and datatype.
    *   **Diversity Factor:**  Introduce a penalty for redundant contributions. If multiple users submit nearly identical tags/photos, the score increment is reduced.  Calculate similarity using image/text analysis.
    *   **User Reputation Factor:**  Higher reputation users (based on past accuracy/usefulness ratings – leveraging existing system elements) contribute more to the score.
    *   **Completeness Score = Base Score + Σ(Velocity_Score * User_Reputation)**.  Sum across all data types.
*   **Output:**  Dynamic 'Completeness Score' for each item.

**2. Data Quest System:**

*   **Quest Generation:**
    *   The system automatically identifies items with low ‘Completeness Scores’ (falling below dynamically adjusted thresholds based on category/popularity).
    *   Create ‘Data Quests’ focused on these items.  Quests are categorized by data type needed (e.g., “Operation: Accessory Photos – Item X needs 3 new accessory photos”).
    *   Adjust quest difficulty/reward based on data type rarity and submission requirements.
*   **Collaborative Quests:**
    *   Allow users to form ‘Teams’ or participate individually.
    *   Real-time progress tracking for each quest.  Visual display of contributions.
    *   ‘Contribution Locking’ – First valid submission of a specific data type ‘locks’ that portion of the quest, preventing redundant submissions.
*   **Reward System:**
    *   Points, badges, leaderboard rankings.
    *   Exclusive discounts, early access to products.
    *   ‘Data Contributor’ status – Recognition for high-quality contributions.
*   **AI-Assisted Validation:**
    *   Integrate AI image/text analysis to automatically flag potentially low-quality/duplicate submissions for manual review.

**3. User Interface Enhancements:**

*   **‘Completeness Meter’:**  Display a visual ‘Completeness Meter’ on each item’s product page, indicating how complete the data is.
*   **‘Data Quest’ Hub:** Dedicated section within the user interface for browsing/joining active ‘Data Quests’.
*   **Personalized Quest Recommendations:** Recommend quests based on user’s past contributions and interests.
*   **‘Team’ Collaboration Tools:** In-app communication and progress tracking for ‘Data Quest’ teams.
