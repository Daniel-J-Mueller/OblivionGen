## Dynamic Resource Allocation via Predictive Modeling & Federated Learning

**System Specification:** A distributed system leveraging predictive modeling and federated learning to proactively allocate resources *before* requests are made, optimizing cluster performance beyond reactive adjustments.

**Core Concept:** Shift from reacting to resource requests to *predicting* them and pre-allocating resources based on learned user/application behavior.

**Components:**

*   **Edge Agents:**  Lightweight agents on each computing device (cluster member) responsible for local data collection and model inference.
*   **Federated Learning Coordinator:** A central server facilitating federated learning. It aggregates model updates from Edge Agents *without* directly accessing raw data.
*   **Predictive Models:**  Time-series forecasting models (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) trained to predict resource demands for each device or application. Separate models per application type and user profile.
*   **Resource Broker:** Responsible for pre-allocating resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, cache space) based on Predictive Model outputs. It dynamically adjusts allocations based on model confidence intervals and available cluster capacity.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Continuous monitoring of actual resource usage vs. predictions. Discrepancies are fed back into the Federated Learning system to refine models.

**Operation:**

1.  **Data Collection:** Edge Agents collect time-series data: CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, application activity, user interaction patterns (e.g., app launch times, data access patterns). Data is locally preprocessed (e.g., smoothing, feature extraction).
2.  **Model Training (Federated):** Edge Agents train local Predictive Models using the collected data.
3.  **Model Aggregation:** Edge Agents send model *updates* (gradients, weights) to the Federated Learning Coordinator.  The Coordinator aggregates these updates using a secure aggregation protocol (e.g., FedAvg) to create a global model.
4.  **Model Distribution:** The global model is distributed back to Edge Agents.
5.  **Prediction & Pre-Allocation:** Edge Agents use the global model to predict future resource demand.  The Resource Broker pre-allocates resources accordingly.
6.  **Monitoring & Feedback:** Actual resource usage is monitored. Discrepancies are used to refine the Predictive Models in the next round of Federated Learning.

**Pseudocode (Edge Agent - Prediction & Pre-Allocation):**

```
// Variables
local_resource_data // Collected resource usage data
global_model // Received from Federated Learning Coordinator
prediction_horizon = 60 // Seconds
confidence_level = 0.95

// Function: predict_resource_demand
function predict_resource_demand(local_resource_data, global_model, prediction_horizon):
  // Use global_model to forecast resource needs for the next 'prediction_horizon' seconds
  predicted_demand = global_model.predict(local_resource_data, prediction_horizon)
  return predicted_demand

// Function: pre_allocate_resources
function pre_allocate_resources(predicted_demand, confidence_level):
  // Determine resource allocation based on prediction and confidence level
  allocated_cpu = predicted_demand.cpu * (1 + confidence_level)
  allocated_memory = predicted_demand.memory * (1 + confidence_level)
  // Request allocation from Resource Broker
  ResourceBroker.allocate(cpu=allocated_cpu, memory=allocated_memory)

// Main Loop
while True:
  resource_data = collect_resource_data()
  predicted_demand = predict_resource_demand(resource_data, global_model)
  pre_allocate_resources(predicted_demand)
  sleep(1)
```

**Novelty:**  The combination of federated learning for personalized prediction *and* proactive resource pre-allocation based on probabilistic forecasting moves beyond reactive cluster management.  This is more than just predicting *if* a resource will be needed, it's about anticipating *how much* and preparing in advance, maximizing cluster efficiency and minimizing latency.  The use of confidence intervals in pre-allocation allows for dynamic adjustments based on prediction accuracy.
