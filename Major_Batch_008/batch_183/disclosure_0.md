## Dynamic Sketch Composition for Federated Learning Privacy

**Concept:** Extend the sketch-based joining approach to facilitate privacy-preserving federated learning. Instead of pre-computed, static sketches, leverage dynamic sketch composition where sketches are built incrementally *during* the federated learning process, incorporating differential privacy mechanisms at each step.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sketch Architecture:** Employ a multi-layered sketch.
    *   **Base Layer:**  A Bloom filter or Count-Min Sketch representing the initial dataset distribution at each participating node.
    *   **Differential Privacy Layer:**  Adds noise (Laplacian or Gaussian) to the base layer sketch, parameterized by a privacy budget (ε, δ). This layer is recomputed with each training iteration.
    *   **Aggregation Layer:** Facilitates secure aggregation of the differentially private sketches from multiple nodes. This can utilize secure multi-party computation (SMPC) protocols.
    *   **Query Layer:** Allows querying the aggregated sketch to estimate intersection sizes or perform range queries on the combined data, with quantifiable privacy loss.

2.  **Federated Learning Integration:**

    *   **Local Training:** Each node trains a local model on its private dataset.
    *   **Sketch Creation & Update:**  After each training iteration (or epoch), each node:
        *   Updates its local dataset sketch based on the current model parameters. (e.g., the sketch represents the distribution of features used in the model).
        *   Applies differential privacy noise to the sketch.
    *   **Secure Aggregation:** Nodes securely aggregate the differentially private sketches using SMPC.  The aggregation protocol must preserve the privacy of individual sketches while allowing accurate estimation of intersection sizes.
    *   **Global Model Update:**  The aggregated sketch is used to estimate the overlap in feature distributions across different datasets. This information is used to adjust the global model parameters (e.g., weighting factors) to improve generalization performance.

3. **Data Structure & Algorithms:**
    *   **Sketch:** A modified Count-Min Sketch, optimized for secure aggregation and differential privacy.  Hash functions within the Count-Min Sketch must be carefully selected to minimize collisions and preserve privacy.
    *   **Aggregation Protocol:** A secure summation protocol based on secret sharing. Each node shares its sketch values as secret shares with other nodes. The shares are aggregated to compute the sum without revealing individual sketch values.
    *   **Privacy Accounting:**  Implement a rigorous privacy accounting mechanism (e.g., Moments Accountant) to track the cumulative privacy loss over multiple training iterations. The privacy budget (ε, δ) should be dynamically adjusted based on the observed privacy loss.

4. **Pseudocode (Sketch Update & Aggregation):**

```python
# Node i's Sketch Update
def update_sketch(local_data, model_parameters, privacy_budget):
    sketch = create_base_sketch(local_data)  # Bloom Filter or Count-Min
    noisy_sketch = add_differential_privacy(sketch, privacy_budget)
    return noisy_sketch

# Secure Aggregation Protocol
def secure_aggregate_sketches(noisy_sketches):
    shares = secret_share(noisy_sketches)  # Each node creates shares
    aggregated_shares = securely_sum(shares) # SMPC based summation
    aggregated_sketch = reconstruct(aggregated_shares)
    return aggregated_sketch

# Global Model Update
def update_global_model(global_model, aggregated_sketch):
    overlap_estimate = estimate_overlap(aggregated_sketch)
    adjust_weights(global_model, overlap_estimate)
    return global_model
```

5. **Enhancements:**
    *   **Adaptive Privacy Budget:** Dynamically adjust the privacy budget (ε, δ) based on the sensitivity of the data and the desired level of privacy.
    *   **Sketch Compression:** Employ sketch compression techniques to reduce the communication overhead during secure aggregation.
    *   **Hierarchical Aggregation:**  Use a hierarchical aggregation protocol to reduce the communication complexity for large-scale federated learning scenarios.
    *   **Integration with Homomorphic Encryption:**  Combine sketch-based joining with homomorphic encryption to further enhance privacy.
