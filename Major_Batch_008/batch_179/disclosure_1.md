## Propulsion Apparatus with Variable Geometry Propeller Rim

**Concept:** Adapt the circumferentially-driven propulsion system to incorporate a propeller rim capable of dynamically altering its effective diameter and airfoil profile during operation. This allows for optimized thrust and efficiency across varying flight conditions (takeoff, cruise, landing, maneuvering) and potentially enables vectored thrust without conventional control surfaces.

**Specs:**

*   **Propeller Rim Segments:** The propeller rim will be constructed from multiple independent, arcuate segments (minimum 8, ideally 12-16) arranged to form a complete circle. Each segment will be individually controllable.
*   **Segment Actuation:** Each segment will be actuated by a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric or electromagnetic) capable of extending or retracting the segment’s radial position. The actuators will be integrated *within* the segments to minimize drag and protect them from airflow.
*   **Segment Airfoil Control:** Each segment will feature small, integrated micro-flaps or similar airfoil control surfaces on its leading and trailing edges. These will be actuated by miniature servo motors.
*   **Rim Material:** Segments constructed from a lightweight composite material (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) with embedded strain gauges for real-time deformation monitoring.
*   **Magnetic Coupling:** Maintain the existing permanent magnet/electromagnet arrangement for primary rotation. Integrate Hall effect sensors into each segment to monitor its position relative to the electromagnets.
*   **Controller Integration:** The existing controller will be augmented with a dedicated “Rim Control Module.” This module will receive data from the Hall effect sensors and strain gauges, calculate optimal segment positions and airfoil configurations based on flight parameters (speed, altitude, angle of attack, desired thrust), and send control signals to the segment actuators and airfoil servos.
*   **Power Delivery:** Utilize a slip ring mechanism or wireless power transfer to provide power to the segment actuators and servos during rotation.
*   **Enclosure Adaptation:** Modify the enclosure to accommodate the actuation mechanisms and provide clearance for segment movement. The enclosure will require strategically placed openings or slots to allow segment expansion/contraction.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   `RimControlModule.calculateSegmentPositions(flightParameters)`: Determines the ideal position and airfoil configuration for each segment.
    *   `Segment.setActuationLevel(actuationLevel)`: Controls the radial position of a segment.
    *   `Segment.setAirfoilConfiguration(configuration)`: Adjusts the airfoil control surfaces.
    *   `SensorData.getSegmentPosition(segmentID)`: Returns the current position of a segment.
    *   `SensorData.getSegmentStrain(segmentID)`: Returns the strain data for a segment.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Cruise Mode:** Segments extended to maximize diameter and efficiency. Airfoil configurations optimized for low drag.
    *   **Takeoff/Landing Mode:** Segments extended and airfoil configurations optimized for high thrust at low speeds.
    *   **Maneuvering Mode:** Segments retracted on one side and extended on the other to create differential thrust and enable turning without traditional control surfaces.
    *   **Emergency Mode:** Segments fully retracted for minimal drag in the event of a motor failure.
