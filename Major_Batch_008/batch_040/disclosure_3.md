## Dynamic Component Modeling & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Expand the interactive component review system to incorporate a dynamic 3D model of the product, and leverage user review data alongside sensor data (if available) to predict potential component failures.

**System Specs:**

1.  **3D Model Integration:** Replace the 2D image with a fully interactive 3D model of the product.  This model isn't static; it updates based on user interaction and data streams. The model should be capable of sectioning, rotating, and zooming to expose internal components.

2.  **Sensor Data Input:** Allow integration with external sensor data.  This could include data from usage (e.g., runtime hours, cycles), environmental conditions (temperature, humidity), or embedded sensors within the product itself (strain gauges, accelerometers).

3.  **User Review Aggregation & Weighting:**  The system needs to aggregate existing user review data *and* weight it based on reviewer credibility. Credibility could be determined by:
    *   Number of reviews submitted.
    *   Consistency of reviews (agreement with other reviews).
    *   Verification of product ownership.
    *   Expert designation (verified professional in the field).

4.  **Failure Prediction Algorithm:**  The core of the system is a machine learning algorithm that combines:
    *   Historical failure data (from manufacturer, repair logs).
    *   Current sensor data.
    *   Weighted user review data (focus on negative reviews describing failures/weaknesses).
    *   Component stress modeling (based on material properties and operating conditions).
    
    Algorithm type: Bayesian Network or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).  RNNs are better at handling time-series sensor data. Bayesian Networks are better for incorporating expert knowledge and uncertainty.

5.  **Interactive Visualization:**
    *   **Heatmaps:** Overlay heatmaps onto the 3D model, visualizing predicted stress levels on individual components.
    *   **Failure Probability Display:** Display a numerical probability of failure for each component within a specified time period.
    *   **"What-If" Scenarios:** Allow users to simulate changes in usage conditions (e.g., increased load, extreme temperature) to see the impact on component reliability.
    *   **Proactive Maintenance Recommendations:**  Based on the failure prediction, generate recommendations for preventative maintenance or component replacement.

6.  **Augmented Reality (AR) Integration:**  Allow users to view the 3D model and failure predictions overlaid onto the physical product using an AR-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, AR glasses).

**Pseudocode (Failure Prediction):**

```
FUNCTION predict_failure(product, component, sensor_data, review_data):

  # Load historical failure data for component
  historical_data = load_historical_data(component)

  # Calculate stress levels based on sensor data & material properties
  stress_level = calculate_stress(sensor_data)

  # Calculate review score based on weighted review data
  review_score = calculate_review_score(review_data)

  # Combine factors using machine learning model
  failure_probability = ml_model.predict(stress_level, review_score, historical_data)

  RETURN failure_probability
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Detailed 3D models of the product and its components.
*   Historical failure data (failure rates, failure modes).
*   Material properties of each component.
*   Sensor data streams (if available).
*   User review data (text, ratings).

**Potential Applications:**

*   Proactive maintenance scheduling.
*   Early detection of potential product defects.
*   Improved product design and reliability.
*   Personalized maintenance recommendations for users.
