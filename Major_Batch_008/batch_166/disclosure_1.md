## Adaptive Acoustic Beamforming with Environmental Mapping

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond single-device noise suppression to create a localized, adaptive acoustic environment using a network of motile devices. Instead of *just* suppressing noise, proactively shape the soundscape.

**System Specs:**

*   **Device Network:** Deploy multiple autonomous motile devices (similar to the provided patent’s base device) equipped with microphone arrays, processors, and wireless communication capabilities. Each device functions as an acoustic node.
*   **3D Environmental Mapping:** Each device creates a 3D map of its immediate surroundings using onboard sensors (LiDAR, cameras, ultrasonic). This map includes surfaces, obstacles, and potential sound reflectors/diffractors.
*   **Acoustic Ray Tracing:** Implement an acoustic ray tracing algorithm on each device. This algorithm simulates how sound waves propagate through the mapped environment. Input is sound sources (speech, noise) detected by the microphone array.
*   **Beamforming Control:**  Each device can dynamically adjust its beamforming parameters (direction, focus, amplitude) to:
    *   **Focus on desired sound sources:** Enhance speech clarity by steering beams towards the speaker.
    *   **Nullify noise sources:** Create null points in the soundscape to suppress unwanted noise.
    *   **Redirect sound:** Reflect or refract sound waves to create desired acoustic effects (e.g., focusing sound in a specific area, creating a ‘quiet zone’).
*   **Networked Coordination:** Devices communicate wirelessly to share:
    *   Environmental maps: Build a more complete and accurate representation of the space.
    *   Sound source locations: Identify and track speakers and noise sources.
    *   Beamforming strategies: Coordinate beamforming patterns to maximize effectiveness and avoid interference.
*   **AI-Powered Optimization:** Use reinforcement learning to train a central AI model to optimize the overall system performance. The AI model receives feedback from the devices (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, speech intelligibility) and adjusts the beamforming strategies accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Device Process
Loop:
    Capture Audio & Environmental Data
    Run Acoustic Ray Tracing Simulation
    Calculate Optimal Beamforming Parameters (based on simulation & AI model)
    Adjust Beamforming Hardware
    Transmit Data (audio, environmental, beamforming state) to Central AI
    Receive Updated Beamforming Strategies from Central AI
End Loop

// Central AI Process
Loop:
    Receive Data from all Devices
    Aggregate Data to create Global Environmental Map
    Run Optimization Algorithm (Reinforcement Learning) to calculate optimal beamforming strategies for each device
    Transmit Updated Strategies to Devices
End Loop
```

**Refinements/Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Acoustic Profiles:** Allow users to define their preferred acoustic environment (e.g., “enhance speech,” “suppress background noise,” “create a quiet zone”).
*   **Dynamic Adaptation to Movement:** Seamlessly adjust beamforming patterns as devices and users move within the environment.
*   **Integration with Virtual/Augmented Reality:** Create immersive audio experiences by precisely controlling the soundscape.
*   **Acoustic ‘Sculpting’:**  Enable users to ‘shape’ the soundscape by manually adjusting beamforming parameters.
