## Dynamic Translation Granularity & Contextual Prioritization

**Concept:** Expand beyond content item-level translation to a granular, phrase-level approach coupled with real-time contextual prioritization. This moves beyond simply replacing lower-quality translations with higher-quality ones, and focuses on presenting *relevant* translations first, even if incomplete, improving perceived responsiveness and user experience.

**Specs:**

**1.  Phrase-Level Segmentation & Transmission:**

    *   Input: Raw content (text, HTML, etc.)
    *   Process:
        *   Utilize a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine to segment content into phrases (defined as clauses, noun phrases, verb phrases – aiming for meaningful units, not just arbitrary character counts).
        *   Transmit each phrase *individually* to multiple MT services (similar to the existing patent’s approach).
        *   Each MT service returns a translation *and* a confidence score/latency estimate for that specific phrase.
    *   Output: Array of translation objects: `{phrase: "...", service: "...", translation: "...", confidence: 0.8, latency: 120ms}`

**2. Contextual Prioritization Engine:**

    *   Input: Array of translation objects (from step 1), Current User Context (defined by: browser viewport, scroll position, user gaze tracking data (if available), previous user interactions), Content Hierarchy (DOM tree structure).
    *   Process:
        *   **Relevance Scoring:** Assign a relevance score to each phrase based on its position in the content hierarchy and its proximity to the user’s current viewport/gaze. Phrases within the visible area and closer to the top of the page receive higher scores.
        *   **Confidence Weighting:**  Combine relevance score with translation confidence score to determine presentation priority.
        *   **Dynamic Thresholds:**  Establish dynamic confidence thresholds based on the user's connection speed, device capabilities, and content complexity. Lower thresholds are acceptable for faster rendering on slower connections.
    *   Output: Sorted array of translation objects based on prioritized score.

**3.  Progressive Rendering & Adaptive Quality:**

    *   Process:
        *   As translation objects are received, render them *incrementally* into the UI, following the prioritized order. Do *not* wait for all phrases to be translated.
        *   If a translation service is consistently slow or unreliable for a specific language pair, dynamically lower its weighting in the prioritization engine.
        *   If the user begins interacting with a section of the page (e.g., scrolling, clicking), *immediately* prioritize translations for that section, even if other phrases are still pending.
        *   If a high-quality translation arrives for a phrase already rendered with a low-quality translation, replace the existing translation *seamlessly*, ideally with a visual cue indicating the improvement.

**4.  Cache Optimization:**

    *   Cache translated phrases (with associated quality metrics) at multiple levels: client-side (browser cache), server-side (CDN).
    *   Utilize a “bloom filter” or similar probabilistic data structure to quickly determine if a phrase has already been translated.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Prioritization Engine):**

```
function prioritizeTranslation(translationObjects, userContext, contentHierarchy):
  for each translationObject in translationObjects:
    relevanceScore = calculateRelevance(translationObject, userContext, contentHierarchy)
    priorityScore = relevanceScore * translationObject.confidence

  sortedTranslations = sort(translationObjects, by: priorityScore, descending: true)
  return sortedTranslations

function calculateRelevance(translationObject, userContext, contentHierarchy):
  // Calculate distance from phrase to user's viewport/gaze
  distance = calculateDistance(translationObject, userContext)

  // Calculate depth in content hierarchy (lower depth = higher relevance)
  depth = getContentDepth(translationObject, contentHierarchy)

  // Combine distance and depth into a relevance score (e.g., weighted average)
  relevance = (0.7 * (1 / distance)) + (0.3 * (1 / depth))
  return relevance
```

This system moves beyond simple translation replacement to a proactive, context-aware rendering approach, focusing on delivering *useful* translations to the user as quickly as possible. It necessitates more complex processing but offers a potentially superior user experience, particularly in scenarios with slow network connections or large documents.
