## Acoustic Metamaterial Battery Housing

**Concept:** Integrate an acoustic metamaterial into the battery housing to precisely control ultrasonic wave propagation, enhancing the accuracy and resolution of state-of-charge and state-of-health estimations. 

**Specifications:**

*   **Housing Material:** A composite structure consisting of a polymer matrix (e.g., epoxy) infused with periodic arrangements of sub-wavelength acoustic resonators (e.g., Helmholtz resonators, coiled space resonators).
*   **Resonator Geometry:**  Tunable based on battery cell chemistry and size.  Initial prototypes will explore unit cells of 5mm x 5mm x 3mm, with resonator dimensions varying to achieve targeted acoustic bandgaps.  Resonators will be designed with microfluidic channels filled with a fluid (e.g., water/glycerol mix) to allow for dynamic tuning of resonant frequencies via pressure adjustments.
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Piezoelectric transducers (ultrasonic emitters/receivers) embedded within the metamaterial housing, positioned to maximize interaction with the acoustic field within the battery cell stack. Transducers will be arranged in a phased array configuration for beam steering and focusing.
*   **Control System Integration:**  The battery management system (BMS) will be extended to include a metamaterial control module. This module will:
    *   Dynamically adjust the fluid pressure within the microfluidic channels to tune the metamaterial's resonant frequencies and optimize acoustic wave propagation.
    *   Control the phased array transducers to steer and focus ultrasonic beams.
    *   Process the received ultrasonic signals (time of flight, amplitude, frequency) using advanced signal processing algorithms (e.g., synthetic aperture focusing, beamforming).
*   **Waveform Selection:**  Employ chirped ultrasonic pulses with a bandwidth of 1-10 MHz.  This will enable high-resolution time-of-flight measurements and enhance sensitivity to subtle changes in battery cell characteristics.
*   **Data Fusion:** Integrate ultrasonic data with existing BMS data (voltage, current, temperature) using a Kalman filter or other data fusion technique.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  `INIT`: Define battery housing geometry and resonator arrangement. Set initial acoustic parameters.
    2.  `SCAN`:  Iterate through each battery cell.
    3.  `EMIT`:  Activate phased array to emit chirped ultrasonic pulse towards cell.
    4.  `RECEIVE`: Capture reflected signal via phased array.
    5.  `PROCESS`:
        *   `TOF = CalculateTimeOfFlight(signal)`
        *   `AMP = CalculateAmplitude(signal)`
        *   `FREQ = CalculateFrequencyShift(signal)`
        *   `RES = CalculateResonanceChanges(signal, RES_BASELINE)`
    6.  `ANALYZE`:
        *   `SIZE = DetectSizeChange(TOF, SIZE_BASELINE)`
        *   `SHAPE = DetectShapeDeformation(AMP, SHAPE_BASELINE)`
        *   `VOID = DetectVoidPresence(FREQ, FREQ_BASELINE)`
        *   `CHARGE = EstimateChargeState(SIZE, SHAPE, VOID)`
    7.  `UPDATE`:
        *   `RES_BASELINE = UpdateBaseline(RES)`
        *   `SIZE_BASELINE = UpdateBaseline(SIZE)`
        *   `SHAPE_BASELINE = UpdateBaseline(SHAPE)`
        *   `FREQ_BASELINE = UpdateBaseline(FREQ)`
    8.  `LOOP`: Return to step 2.

*   **Calibration:** Establish baseline acoustic profiles for each battery cell during manufacturing. These baselines will be used to detect changes in cell characteristics over time.
