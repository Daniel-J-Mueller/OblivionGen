## Dynamic Data Type Indexing & Query Optimization

**Concept:** Extend the indexing scheme to dynamically adapt based on *observed* data types within columns, and proactively optimize query execution plans based on those observed types. The core idea is to move beyond static data type awareness during index creation to a system that learns and adapts.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Type Profiler Module:**

*   **Function:** Monitors data inserted/updated into each table column.
*   **Implementation:** Runs as a background process. Uses sampling (e.g., first 1000 rows, random sampling) to determine the dominant data types (integer, float, string, date, boolean) present in each column.  Dynamically updates a "Data Type Profile" stored alongside the index metadata.
*   **Output:**  Data Type Profile â€“ a weighted distribution of data types for each column.  Example: `Column X: {Integer: 0.7, String: 0.2, Null: 0.1}`
*   **Trigger:** Activated on data load or significant data update events.  Configuration parameter for sampling frequency.

**2. Adaptive Index Builder:**

*   **Input:** Data Type Profile, Table Column Definition.
*   **Function:**  Selects the *most efficient* index type *based on* the Data Type Profile.  Supports these index types:
    *   **Hashed Index:**  Optimized for equality comparisons on columns with a high percentage of unique values (e.g., primary keys).
    *   **B-Tree Index:**  General-purpose index suitable for range queries and sorted data.
    *   **Bitmap Index:**  Efficient for columns with low cardinality (few distinct values) and boolean flags.
    *   **Hybrid Index:** Combines multiple index types for a single column. For example, a Bitmap index for common boolean values with a B-Tree for range queries.
*   **Implementation:** Uses a scoring function to evaluate each index type based on the Data Type Profile and column statistics (e.g., number of distinct values). The index type with the highest score is selected.  Configuration parameter for weighting factors in the scoring function.
*   **Output:**  A specialized index structure tailored to the column's data characteristics.

**3. Query Plan Optimizer:**

*   **Input:** SQL Query, Data Type Profiles, Index Metadata.
*   **Function:**  Dynamically adjusts the query execution plan based on observed data types *at runtime*.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Type-Aware Operator Selection:**  For example, if a column is known to contain only integers, the optimizer can avoid type coercion during comparisons.
    *   **Index Selection:**  Choose the most appropriate index based on the data types involved in the query.
    *   **Join Optimization:**  Use hash joins when comparing integer columns and merge joins for sorted columns.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function optimizeQuery(query, dataProfiles, indexMetadata) {
  // 1. Analyze the query and identify the columns involved.
  columns = extractColumns(query);

  // 2. Retrieve data type profiles for each column.
  for (column in columns) {
    dataTypeProfile = dataProfiles[column];
  }

  // 3. Select the best index for each column based on the data type profile.
  for (column in columns) {
    index = selectIndex(column, dataTypeProfile, indexMetadata);
  }

  // 4. Rewrite the query to use the selected indices.
  rewrittenQuery = rewriteQueryWithIndices(query, indices);

  // 5. Generate an optimized execution plan.
  executionPlan = generateExecutionPlan(rewrittenQuery);

  return executionPlan;
}
```

**4. Continuous Monitoring & Re-Indexing:**

*   **Function:** Monitors data drift (changes in data distribution) over time.
*   **Implementation:**  Periodically recalculates the Data Type Profile.  If significant data drift is detected, triggers automatic re-indexing with the new profile.  Configuration parameter for drift threshold and re-indexing frequency.

**5. Data Type Hinting:**

*   Allow users to provide hints about expected data types for specific columns, overriding the automatic profiling.  This can be useful for columns with initially sparse data or where the automatic profiling is inaccurate.

This system aims to improve query performance by dynamically adapting to the characteristics of the data, rather than relying on static assumptions. It provides a more flexible and efficient indexing scheme for spreadsheet-based data stores.
