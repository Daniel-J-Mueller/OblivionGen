## Adaptive Granularity TLB with Predictive Invalidation

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on precise TLB invalidation using an IPA translation buffer. This design expands on that, introducing a TLB that dynamically adjusts its granularity – shifting between large and small page mappings – *based on access patterns*, and proactively invalidates entries *before* a TLB miss occurs, based on predicted memory access.

**Specs:**

*   **TLB Architecture:** The TLB will contain entries capable of storing mappings for both standard (e.g., 4KB) and large (e.g., 2MB, 1GB) pages. Each entry will include a ‘Granularity Flag’ indicating the page size.
*   **Hardware Performance Counters:** Integrate dedicated hardware performance counters to monitor:
    *   TLB miss rates for specific memory regions.
    *   Frequency of access to different page sizes.
    *   Temporal locality of memory access (how often the same page is accessed within a short time window).
*   **Granularity Manager:** A dedicated hardware module responsible for:
    *   Monitoring the hardware performance counters.
    *   Dynamically adjusting the page size used for specific memory regions based on access patterns. If a region experiences high TLB miss rates with small pages *and* exhibits strong temporal locality, the Granularity Manager will switch to large pages.
    *   Maintaining a ‘Prediction Table’ which stores predicted future memory accesses based on historical patterns.
*   **Predictive Invalidation Engine:** This module operates in parallel with the TLB and utilizes the Prediction Table.
    *   It proactively identifies pages predicted to be accessed *before* an actual access request occurs.
    *   It prefetches TLB entries for those predicted pages into a ‘Shadow TLB’ – a small, fast buffer.
    *   If a prediction is incorrect, the Shadow TLB entry is discarded without impacting the main TLB.
*   **IPA Translation Buffer Extension:** Extend the existing IPA translation buffer to include a ‘Prediction Valid’ bit per entry. This bit indicates whether a prediction has been made for the corresponding IPA and if the associated prediction is still valid.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Invalidation Engine):**

```
// Initialization
PredictionTable = Empty Table
ShadowTLB = Empty TLB

// On Memory Access Request
If IPA in PredictionTable and PredictionTable[IPA].Valid:
    Fetch TLB entry from ShadowTLB using IPA
    Return TLB entry
Else:
    // Perform standard TLB lookup (as in existing patent)
    // ...

    // Update Prediction Table
    PredictionTable[IPA] = {
        Valid: True,
        PredictedNextAccess: EstimateNextAccess(IPA, HistoricalAccessData), // Machine learning algorithm
        TLBEntry: CurrentTLBEntry
    }
    
    //Prefetch TLB Entry to ShadowTLB
    Add TLBEntry to ShadowTLB
    
End If

//Background Process (periodic)
For each entry in PredictionTable:
    If PredictedNextAccess is past AND entry not recently accessed:
        PredictionTable[entry].Valid = False
        Remove entry from ShadowTLB
End For
```

**Innovation:** This design moves beyond reactive TLB invalidation to *proactive* prefetching and invalidation. By adapting page granularity and predicting future accesses, it reduces TLB misses and improves overall system performance.  The combination of dynamic granularity and predictive invalidation is novel, enabling a more intelligent and responsive memory management system.  The use of machine learning in `EstimateNextAccess` adds another layer of adaptability.
