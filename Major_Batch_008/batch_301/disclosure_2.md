## Autonomous Robotic Swarm for Dynamic Inventory Auditing & Anomaly Detection

**System Overview:** A distributed system employing a swarm of small, autonomous robots equipped with multi-spectral imaging, weight sensors, and RF tag readers. These robots operate continuously within a warehouse or materials handling facility, providing a real-time, dynamic inventory audit and anomaly detection capability exceeding the scope of static scans or human patrols.

**Hardware Specifications (per Robot):**

*   **Dimensions:** 15cm x 15cm x 10cm
*   **Locomotion:** Four-wheeled drive, omnidirectional movement.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   RGB-D camera (high resolution depth sensing).
    *   Multi-spectral camera (visible, near-infrared, thermal).
    *   Precision weight sensor (0.1g resolution, integrated into chassis).
    *   UHF RFID tag reader/writer.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - accelerometer, gyroscope.
*   **Processing:** Edge TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for onboard AI inference.
*   **Communication:** Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable solid-state battery (2 hours operational time). Wireless charging dock compatibility.
*   **Materials:** Lightweight carbon fiber composite chassis.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Swarm Coordination:** A central server manages the robot swarm, assigning tasks and resolving collision avoidance.  Utilizes a decentralized, behavior-based approach. Each robot operates autonomously but communicates its state and intentions to nearby robots via ad-hoc mesh networking.
2.  **Perception Module:**
    *   **Object Detection & Classification:** Deep learning models (YOLOv8, SSD) trained on warehouse item datasets. Identifies and classifies items based on visual appearance.
    *   **Weight Estimation:**  Combines weight sensor data with visual estimations to refine accuracy.
    *   **RFID Tag Reading:** Reads and logs RFID tag data for item tracking.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**
        *   **Visual Anomaly Detection:**  Utilizes autoencoders to identify deviations from expected item appearances (damage, missing components).
        *   **Weight Discrepancy Detection:** Compares measured weight against expected weight range for each item.
        *   **Location Mismatch Detection:** Verifies item location against the inventory database.
3.  **Mapping & Localization:** SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm using visual and IMU data. Creates a dynamic 3D map of the facility.
4.  **Inventory Database Integration:** Real-time data synchronization with the existing inventory management system.
5.  **User Interface:** Web-based dashboard for monitoring swarm activity, reviewing inventory data, and receiving anomaly alerts.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** The swarm is deployed within the facility and initializes its map using SLAM.
2.  **Continuous Audit:** Robots navigate the facility autonomously, scanning items using their sensors.
3.  **Data Collection & Processing:** Sensor data is processed onboard the robot using AI models.
4.  **Anomaly Detection:** Any detected anomalies are flagged and reported to the central server.
5.  **Alerting & Reporting:** The central server generates alerts and reports based on anomaly data.  Includes visual evidence (images) and sensor readings.
6.  **Dynamic Re-mapping:** Robots adapt to changes in the facility layout by continuously updating the map.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
FOR EACH item DETECTED:
    item_id = item_detection_model(image_data)
    IF item_id IS NOT NULL:
        expected_weight = inventory_database.get_weight(item_id)
        measured_weight = weight_sensor.read()
        weight_difference = ABS(measured_weight - expected_weight)
        IF weight_difference > weight_threshold:
            anomaly_report.add_anomaly(item_id, "Weight Discrepancy", measured_weight, expected_weight)
        expected_location = inventory_database.get_location(item_id)
        current_location = SLAM.get_location()
        IF distance(current_location, expected_location) > location_threshold:
            anomaly_report.add_anomaly(item_id, "Location Mismatch", current_location, expected_location)
        image_features = feature_extraction_model(image_data)
        expected_features = inventory_database.get_image_features(item_id)
        feature_difference = cosine_similarity(image_features, expected_features)
        IF feature_difference < feature_threshold:
            anomaly_report.add_anomaly(item_id, "Visual Anomaly", image_data)
    ELSE:
        anomaly_report.add_anomaly("Unknown Object", image_data)

SEND anomaly_report TO central_server
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Robot Collaboration:**  Robots can collaborate to inspect large or difficult-to-reach items.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Analyzing historical anomaly data to predict potential equipment failures.
*   **Integration with Augmented Reality:**  Providing AR overlays to highlight anomalies for human operators.
*   **Dynamic Path Planning:**  Adapting robot paths based on real-time traffic and obstacles.
