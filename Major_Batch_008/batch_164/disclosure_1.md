## Modular Wing Payload System

**Concept:** Adapt the reconfigurable wing design to incorporate fully modular payload bays *within* each wing segment. These bays would not be for static weight distribution, but active, reconfigurable payload deployments during flight.

**Specs:**

*   **Wing Segment Construction:** Each wing segment (as described in the patent) is internally divided into 3-5 individually sealed, pressurized payload bays. Bays are accessed via flush-mounted, remotely operated hatches.
*   **Bay Dimensions:**  Standardized bay sizes (e.g., 20cm x 20cm x 30cm) to accommodate diverse payloads.  Internal mounting rails & power connections within each bay.
*   **Payload Types:** Designed for micro-satellite deployment, sensor arrays (LiDAR, hyperspectral imaging), emergency supply drops (small medical kits, communication devices), targeted advertising (projectors/displays), or even small-scale environmental remediation (seed dispersal).
*   **Actuation System:** Each bay includes a small linear actuator to extend/retract the payload outside the wing, along with a rotational actuator for directional control.  Actuators are powered via wing-integrated power distribution.
*   **Wing Rotation & Payload Release Synchronization:** The flight control system integrates wing rotation with payload bay actuation. In horizontal flight, bays remain retracted.  During descent/maneuvering, bays can extend for deployment.  A "staggered deployment" mode allows for sequential release of multiple payloads.
*   **Aerodynamic Fairings:**  Flush-fitting, retractable aerodynamic fairings cover each bay when retracted, minimizing drag.
*   **Wing Segment Interconnects:**  Data & power interconnects between wing segments allow for inter-payload communication and shared resources.
*   **Control System Integration:**
    *   `PayloadManager Class:` Handles payload allocation, activation, monitoring, and deployment sequencing.
    *   `BayStatus Struct:`  Contains bay ID, payload type, activation status, position (extended/retracted), angle, power consumption, and sensor data.
    *   `deployPayload(bayID, targetCoordinates) Function:`  Calculates optimal deployment trajectory, extends bay, adjusts angle, and releases payload.
    *   `monitorPayload(bayID) Function:`  Returns BayStatus data.
*   **Materials:** Lightweight composites (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) for wing structure.  Sealed, pressure-resistant polymer for bay enclosures.
*   **Power:**  Dedicated high-capacity battery pack integrated into the wing structure.  Regenerative braking to recapture energy during flight.
*   **Safety Features:**  Redundant actuation systems.  Emergency payload jettison mechanism.  Automatic bay sealing in case of breach.
