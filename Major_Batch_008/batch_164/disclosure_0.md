## Dynamic Tactile Overlay System

**Concept:** Integrate microfluidic channels within the protective sheet to create dynamically changing tactile feedback on the display surface. This builds on the idea of the protective sheet being a primary user interface element (claims 10, 11) but moves beyond simple touch sensing.

**Specs:**

*   **Protective Sheet Material:** Multi-layer flexible substrate. Base layer: PET or similar for structural integrity. Intermediate layer: Embedded microfluidic channels (approx. 0.5-1mm channel width, varying depth for different ‘bump’ heights). Top Layer: Transparent elastomer (e.g., silicone) forming the tactile surface.
*   **Microfluidic System:**
    *   **Fluid:** Non-conductive, viscous fluid (e.g., mineral oil with viscosity enhancers) within the channels.
    *   **Actuation:** Miniature piezoelectric pumps or electro-osmotic pumps integrated within the device chassis connected to the microfluidic channels. Individual channel control via device processor.
    *   **Channel Density:** Variable, targeting 10-20 channels per square centimeter. Denser in areas corresponding to frequently used UI elements (e.g., virtual buttons, scroll bars).
*   **Software Control:**
    *   **Tactile Mapping:** Software library to map UI elements to specific microfluidic channels.
    *   **Dynamic Profiles:** Pre-set tactile profiles for different applications (e.g., “keyboard” with raised key feedback, “gaming” with vibration/texture changes).
    *   **Haptic API:** Expose an API for developers to create custom haptic experiences.
*   **Integration with Display:**
    *   Display stack: Substrate, first display element, second display element, microfluidic/elastomer protective sheet.
    *   Edge seal must accommodate fluid pathways and pump connections.
    *   Flexible printed circuits (as per claim 5) will route power and control signals to the pumps.
*   **Optional Enhancements:**
    *   **Temperature Control:** Integrate micro-heaters/coolers alongside the microfluidic channels to create localized temperature variations for enhanced feedback.
    *   **Electrowetting:** Replace or supplement the microfluidic channels with electrowetting elements for faster response times and more nuanced tactile effects.

**Pseudocode (Basic Pump Control):**

```
function activateTactile(channelID, intensity) {
  // intensity is a value between 0 and 100
  pumpSpeed = map(intensity, 0, 100, 0, MAX_PUMP_SPEED);
  activatePump(channelID, pumpSpeed);
}

function deactivateTactile(channelID) {
  activatePump(channelID, 0); // Stop the pump
}

function map(value, in_min, in_max, out_min, out_max) {
  // Linear mapping function
  return (value - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min;
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Channel layout and pump control must be optimized to minimize latency and create a realistic tactile experience.
*   Fluid selection is critical; it must be compatible with the materials used in the protective sheet and have appropriate viscosity and dielectric properties.
*   Power consumption of the pumps will be a key consideration.
*   Durability and long-term reliability of the microfluidic channels are essential.
