## Adaptive Rendering Component Isolation & Migration

**Concept:** Extend the idea of replacing failed rendering components with a system that *proactively* isolates potentially problematic components into separate processes (or even remote compute instances) and dynamically migrates them as needed based on observed stability. This is about preemptive fault tolerance, not just recovery.

**Specification:**

**1. Component Categorization & Profiling:**

*   **Categories:** Define rendering component categories based on inherent risk (e.g., components interfacing with external APIs, components utilizing complex calculations, components known to have historically caused issues).
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each component instance at initialization. Factors influencing the score:
    *   Component category risk.
    *   Historical crash rate of that component type.
    *   Resource consumption (CPU, memory).
    *   External dependency count.
*   **Profiling Data:**  Collect runtime profiling data on each component: CPU usage, memory allocation patterns, external API call frequency/success rates.  This data feeds into a dynamic risk assessment.

**2. Isolation Mechanisms:**

*   **Process Isolation:**  High-risk components are launched in separate OS processes.  Communication occurs via inter-process communication (IPC) – message queues, shared memory, etc.
*   **Remote Compute Option:**  For extremely critical or resource-intensive components, provision a remote compute instance (e.g., a lightweight container in a cloud environment). Component logic runs remotely; data is streamed over a network connection.
*   **“Shadow” Instances:**  For certain components, maintain a “shadow” instance running in parallel. The shadow instance receives the same data but doesn't directly render. Its purpose is to act as a canary – detect errors or crashes before the primary instance is affected.

**3. Dynamic Migration & Load Balancing:**

*   **Health Monitoring:**  Continuous monitoring of component health (CPU/memory usage, error rates, responsiveness).
*   **Migration Triggers:** Define thresholds that trigger migration:
    *   High CPU/memory usage exceeding a defined limit.
    *   Error rate exceeding a defined limit.
    *   Responsiveness degradation (e.g., rendering frame time exceeds a threshold).
    *   Shadow instance detection of errors.
*   **Migration Process:**
    *   **New Instance Creation:**  Spin up a new instance of the failing component – either in a separate process on the same machine or on a remote compute instance.
    *   **State Transfer:** Transfer the necessary state (data, rendering context) to the new instance.  Minimize data transfer overhead (e.g., using efficient serialization/deserialization).
    *   **Switchover:** Redirect rendering requests to the new instance.
    *   **Old Instance Termination:**  Gracefully terminate the old instance.
*   **Load Balancing:** Distribute rendering requests across multiple instances of the same component to improve performance and fault tolerance.

**4.  Adaptive Risk Adjustment:**

*   **Historical Data Analysis:** Track the performance and stability of each component over time.
*   **Dynamic Risk Scoring:** Adjust the risk score of each component based on historical data.  A component that consistently performs well will have its risk score lowered, while a component with a history of crashes will have its risk score increased.
*   **Automated Policy Updates:**  Automatically adjust isolation and migration policies based on dynamic risk scores.  For example, a high-risk component might be automatically migrated to a remote compute instance, while a low-risk component might be allowed to run in the same process as the browser application.

**Pseudocode (Migration Trigger):**

```
function check_component_health(component):
    health_data = get_component_health_data(component)
    cpu_usage = health_data.cpu_usage
    memory_usage = health_data.memory_usage
    error_rate = health_data.error_rate

    if cpu_usage > CPU_THRESHOLD or memory_usage > MEMORY_THRESHOLD or error_rate > ERROR_THRESHOLD:
        migrate_component(component)
        return True
    return False
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ComponentMetadata`: Stores risk score, isolation level, migration history.
*   `HealthData`: Stores CPU usage, memory usage, error rate, rendering performance metrics.
