## Adaptive Data Shadowing with Predictive Restoration

**Concept:** Extend the backup/restore system to proactively “shadow” data blocks based on predicted failure probabilities, moving beyond reactive restoration. This anticipates data loss rather than responding to it.

**Specifications:**

*   **Failure Probability Engine:** A component that continuously monitors cluster node health (disk I/O, CPU load, network latency, error logs, etc.) and employs machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, Bayesian networks) to predict the probability of failure for each node and, consequently, the data blocks stored on it.  Models are retrained dynamically based on observed data and historical failure patterns.
*   **Shadowing Tier:** A secondary storage tier (could be the existing key-value store, or a new, faster tier) dedicated to storing “shadow” copies of data blocks. Shadowing is *proportional* to predicted failure probability – blocks on nodes with a higher predicted failure rate are shadowed more frequently or maintained as multiple copies.
*   **Shadowing Policy:** Configurable policies determine:
    *   *Shadowing Threshold:* The minimum predicted failure probability that triggers shadowing.
    *   *Shadowing Frequency:* How often a block is shadowed (e.g., every hour, every day).
    *   *Shadowing Depth:* The number of shadow copies maintained.
    *   *Tiered Shadowing:* Use different tiers of storage for shadows based on failure probability (e.g., high-probability blocks on SSDs, lower-probability on HDDs).
*   **Intelligent Switchover:**  When a node or disk fails:
    *   The system *automatically* switches over to the most recent shadow copy of the affected data blocks.  This bypasses the full restoration process, minimizing downtime.
    *   A background process initiates a full restore from the key-value store *concurrently* with serving data from the shadow copy, ensuring data consistency and the eventual replacement of the shadow with a primary/secondary copy.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  The system continuously monitors the performance of the shadowing process (e.g., time to switchover, shadow copy consistency) and adjusts the shadowing policy dynamically to optimize for availability and cost.

**Pseudocode (Switchover Logic):**

```
function handleNodeFailure(node):
  for block in blocksOnNode(node):
    failureProbability = getFailureProbability(block)
    if failureProbability > shadowingThreshold:
      shadowCopy = getLatestShadowCopy(block)
      serveDataFrom(shadowCopy)  // Instant switchover

      // Concurrent background restore
      startRestoreProcess(block)

    else:
      // Use standard restoration from key-value store
      startRestoreProcess(block)

function startRestoreProcess(block):
  restoreFromKeyValueStore(block)
  updatePrimarySecondaryCopies(block)

```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Geographic Distribution:**  Extend the shadowing tier to span multiple geographic locations for disaster recovery.
*   **Data Compression & Deduplication:** Optimize storage costs within the shadowing tier.
*   **Predictive Prefetching:**  Anticipate data access patterns and proactively prefetch shadow copies to improve read performance.
*   **Integration with existing monitoring systems:** Leverage existing cluster monitoring tools to feed data into the failure probability engine.
