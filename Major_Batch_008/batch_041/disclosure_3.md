## Device Harmony - Predictive Environmental State Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend device state prediction beyond individual device actions to proactively adjust *environmental* states (lighting, temperature, audio) based on predicted device usage and user behavior, creating a harmonious and anticipatory environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Fusion Module:** Integrate data from a variety of sources:
    *   Device usage patterns (from the patent – key input)
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, light, humidity, air quality)
    *   User location (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation)
    *   Calendar/scheduling data
    *   External data sources (weather, traffic)
*   **Behavioral State Engine:** A hierarchical state machine representing typical user behaviors within a defined space.  States are defined by combinations of device usage, location, time of day, and environmental factors. Example states: “Working at Desk”, “Relaxing in Living Room”, “Preparing Dinner”, “Leaving Home”.
*   **Predictive Adjustment Algorithm:** 
    1.  **State Probability Calculation:** Utilize the patent's prediction engine (ratio of reference device states) to calculate the probability of the Behavioral State Engine transitioning to a new state.
    2.  **Environmental Profile Lookup:** Each Behavioral State has an associated “Environmental Profile” – preferred settings for lighting, temperature, audio, etc.
    3.  **Proactive Adjustment:**  Based on state probability, *gradually* adjust environmental settings *before* the state is fully realized.  Adjustments are weighted by the probability – higher probability = faster/more significant adjustment.
    4.  **User Override:**  Allow users to easily override automated adjustments. System learns from overrides to refine future predictions.
*   **Device Control Interface:**  Abstracted API to control a wide range of smart home devices (lights, thermostats, speakers, blinds, etc.).
*   **Machine Learning Module:**
    *   Reinforcement Learning: Optimize adjustment parameters (speed, magnitude, weighting) based on user feedback (overrides, explicit ratings).
    *   Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual device usage or environmental conditions that may indicate a need for a different adjustment strategy.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Gather Data
    deviceUsageData = getDeviceUsageData()
    environmentalData = getEnvironmentalData()
    userData = getUserData()

    // 2. Predict Next Behavioral State
    predictedState = predictBehavioralState(deviceUsageData, environmentalData, userData)

    // 3. Get Environmental Profile for Predicted State
    environmentalProfile = getEnvironmentalProfile(predictedState)

    // 4. Calculate Adjustment Parameters
    adjustmentSpeed = predictedState.probability * adjustmentScaleFactor
    adjustmentMagnitude = environmentalProfile.targetValues - currentEnvironmentalValues

    // 5. Apply Adjustments (Gradually)
    applyEnvironmentalAdjustments(adjustmentMagnitude, adjustmentSpeed)

    // 6. Monitor User Feedback (Overrides)
    if (userOverrideDetected()) {
        learnFromOverride()
    }
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Central hub with sufficient processing power to run the prediction algorithms and control the connected devices.
*   Integration with existing smart home ecosystems (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home).
*   Secure communication protocols to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
