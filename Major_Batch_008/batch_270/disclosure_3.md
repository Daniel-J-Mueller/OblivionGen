**Dynamic Content Re-composition via AI-Driven Semantic Segmentation & Generative Fill**

**Concept:** Extend the anomaly detection and editing capabilities to not just remove or redub sections, but *intelligently re-compose* content by filling gaps or altering visuals/audio based on semantic understanding and generative AI.

**Specs:**

1.  **Semantic Segmentation Module:**
    *   Input: Video/Audio content stream.
    *   Process: Employ a deep learning model (e.g., Mask R-CNN, DETR, Segment Anything Model) to identify and segment objects, scenes, and audio events within the content. Output a dynamic scene graph representing the content’s structure.
    *   Output: Scene graph with object classifications, bounding boxes (visuals), and event labels (audio).

2.  **Anomaly Correlation & Impact Assessment:**
    *   Input: Anomaly flags (from patent) + Semantic Scene Graph.
    *   Process: Correlate anomaly timestamps with semantic segments. Assess the impact of each anomaly on the scene's narrative/aesthetic coherence.  Weight anomalies based on their severity and impact score.
    *   Output: Anomaly impact report – detailing affected segments, severity, and suggested resolution strategies.

3.  **Generative Fill Engine:**
    *   Input: Anomaly impact report + Semantic Scene Graph + Access to a generative AI model (e.g. Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, or a custom trained model).
    *   Process:
        *   **Visual Anomalies:** If a segment is removed, the engine uses surrounding visual context (from the scene graph) to generate a plausible fill. Prompt the AI with “Generate a scene consistent with [surrounding scene description] to fill the gap at timecode [anomaly timecode].”
        *   **Audio Anomalies:** If audio is removed, the engine synthesizes replacement audio based on the surrounding audio context. Analyze the surrounding audio to determine the appropriate soundscape (music, speech, SFX), then generate replacement audio with similar characteristics.
        *   **Content Adaptation:** Use contextual data to *alter* anomalies in ways which improve user experience. I.e. a face is obscured, and the AI algorithm re-renders that face as a cartoon, or renders it as a completely different person.
    *   Output: Re-composed video/audio stream with anomalies intelligently filled or altered.

4.  **User Interface Integration:**
    *   Display anomaly impact report to user.
    *   Present multiple generative fill/alteration options (generated by the engine) for each anomaly.
    *   Allow user to preview and select preferred solution.
    *   Enable manual adjustment of generative parameters (e.g., style, realism).

**Pseudocode (Generative Fill Engine):**

```
function generate_fill(anomaly_data, scene_graph, generative_model):
    anomaly_type = anomaly_data.type
    anomaly_timecode = anomaly_data.timecode
    context_segments = get_surrounding_segments(scene_graph, anomaly_timecode)

    if anomaly_type == "visual":
        prompt = "Generate a scene consistent with " + describe_segments(context_segments) + " to fill the gap at timecode " + anomaly_timecode
        generated_frame = generative_model.generate_image(prompt)
        return generated_frame

    elif anomaly_type == "audio":
        context_audio = extract_audio_features(context_segments)
        replacement_audio = generative_model.generate_audio(context_audio)
        return replacement_audio

    else:
        return None
```

**Novelty:**

The patent focuses on *detecting* and *removing/redubbing* anomalies. This design goes further by using AI to *reconstruct* or *alter* the content to seamlessly address anomalies, creating a more fluid and polished final product. It moves beyond correction to intelligent content adaptation.
