## Dynamic Module Promotion Based on Predicted Failure Impact

**Concept:** Extend the code coverage-based promotion system to incorporate predictive analytics determining the potential *impact* of a module failure *before* promotion. Instead of solely relying on coverage thresholds, assess risk.

**Specification:**

**1. Failure Impact Prediction Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical failure data (logs, bug reports) categorized by module.
    *   Module dependencies (graph representing inter-module connections).
    *   Module criticality (user-defined or automatically inferred based on usage frequency and impact on core functionality).
    *   Code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, lines of code).
    *   Real-time system load and performance data.
*   **Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., Bayesian Network, Random Forest) trained to predict the probability and severity of a failure within a module, given the above data.  Severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Negligible.
*   **Output:** For each module, a “Failure Impact Score” (FIS) – a combined probability/severity metric.  Range: 0.0 (negligible risk) to 1.0 (critical risk).

**2. Dynamic Promotion Criteria:**

*   **Baseline Criteria:** Maintain existing code coverage thresholds for promotion.
*   **FIS Adjustment:** Adjust the required code coverage based on the FIS.  Higher FIS requires *higher* code coverage for promotion.
    *   Example:
        *   FIS < 0.2: Standard coverage threshold.
        *   0.2 <= FIS < 0.5: Coverage threshold + 10%.
        *   0.5 <= FIS < 0.8: Coverage threshold + 20%.
        *   FIS >= 0.8: Promotion blocked – requires manual review & further testing.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If a promoted module exhibits failures in production, automatically rollback to the previous stable version. This rollback should trigger re-evaluation of the FIS and increased testing requirements for future promotions.

**3. System Architecture Components:**

*   **FIS Calculation Service:**  Responsible for receiving module data, calculating the FIS, and providing the score to the Promotion Management Component.
*   **Promotion Management Component (Enhanced):**
    *   Receives code coverage metrics *and* FIS from the FIS Calculation Service.
    *   Applies dynamic promotion criteria.
    *   Initiates rollback procedures if necessary.
*   **Real-time Monitoring Agent:** Collects system load, performance metrics, and module usage data, feeding it to the FIS Calculation Service.

**4. Pseudocode (Promotion Decision Logic):**

```
FUNCTION determinePromotionStatus(module, codeCoverage, FIS):
  baseCoverageThreshold = getConfig("baseCoverageThreshold")

  IF FIS < 0.2:
    requiredCoverage = baseCoverageThreshold
  ELSE IF FIS < 0.5:
    requiredCoverage = baseCoverageThreshold * 1.10
  ELSE IF FIS < 0.8:
    requiredCoverage = baseCoverageThreshold * 1.20
  ELSE:
    RETURN "Promotion Blocked - Manual Review Required"

  IF codeCoverage >= requiredCoverage:
    RETURN "Promote"
  ELSE:
    RETURN "Insufficient Coverage"
```

**5. Data Structures:**

*   `ModuleData`:  Represents module metadata (name, dependencies, criticality).
*   `FISResult`:  Contains the calculated Failure Impact Score for a module.
*   `PromotionRequest`:  Combines module data, code coverage, and FIS for promotion evaluation.
