## Dynamic Multi-Modal Abandonment Prediction

**Concept:** Expand beyond interface position as a primary driver of abandonment scores. Incorporate real-time analysis of user *modal* behavior (eye-tracking, mouse movement, touch input, audio cues) to predict abandonment *before* the user physically leaves the content. This enables proactive content adjustments.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time streams from:
        *   Eye-tracker: Pupil dilation, fixation points, saccade velocity.
        *   Mouse/Touch: Velocity, acceleration, dwell time on elements, scrolling behavior.
        *   Microphone: Ambient noise levels, potentially short-form vocalizations (sighs, hesitations).
    *   Processing: Time-series analysis, feature extraction (mean, standard deviation, rate of change for each sensor stream).  Sensor data synchronized and aligned.
    *   Output:  A "Frustration Vector" – a numerical representation of the user's engagement level based on fused sensor data.

2.  **Abandonment Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Frustration Vector, Content Metadata (category, topic, keywords), User Profile (past engagement, preferences), Interface Position.
    *   Model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.  LSTM excels at processing sequential data (time-series sensor input).
    *   Training Data:  Large dataset of user sessions, labeled with abandonment events.  Data augmented with synthetic sensor data to improve robustness.
    *   Output:  Abandonment Probability – a value between 0 and 1 indicating the likelihood of abandonment within a short time window (e.g., 5 seconds).

3.  **Proactive Content Adjustment Module:**
    *   Input: Abandonment Probability, Current Content Being Displayed, User Preferences.
    *   Logic:
        *   If Abandonment Probability > Threshold (tunable parameter):
            *   Content Swapping: Immediately replace the current content with a different item from the feed, prioritized by predicted engagement.
            *   Content Modification:  Dynamically adjust the presentation of the current content (e.g., increase font size, highlight key information, play a short, engaging animation).
            *   Content Pausing: Temporarily pause any autoplaying video or audio to regain user attention.
        *   Decision making logic also factors user preferences to avoid presenting unwanted content.
    *   Output:  Command to Content Delivery System to modify the displayed content.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Content Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjustContent(abandonmentProbability, currentContent, userPreferences):
  threshold = 0.7  // Tunable parameter
  if abandonmentProbability > threshold:
    // Determine replacement content based on predicted engagement.
    replacementContent = getHighestEngagementContent(userPreferences)

    // Perform content swap or modification
    if replacementContent != null:
      swapContent(currentContent, replacementContent)
    else:
      modifyContent(currentContent)  //Increase font size, etc.
```

**Novelty:**  Most abandonment prediction systems rely heavily on historical click-through rates and interface position. This system incorporates real-time, multi-modal sensor data to anticipate abandonment *before* it happens, allowing for proactive content adjustments to re-engage the user. This goes beyond simply optimizing the ranking of content; it dynamically adapts the user experience based on real-time signals of frustration or disinterest.
