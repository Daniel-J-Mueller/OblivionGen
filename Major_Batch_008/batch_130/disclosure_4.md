**Dynamic Recipe Composition via Generative AI & Real-Time Feedback**

**Specification:** A system augmenting the existing recipe execution framework with a generative AI module capable of composing and modifying recipes on-the-fly, guided by real-time performance metrics and user feedback.

**Components:**

1.  **Recipe Composition Engine (RCE):** A generative AI model (Transformer-based, fine-tuned on a corpus of existing recipes and API specifications) responsible for creating, modifying, and optimizing recipes.
2.  **Real-Time Performance Monitor (RPM):**  Collects metrics during recipe execution (latency, resource utilization, error rates) for each operation.
3.  **Feedback Integration Module (FIM):**  Captures user feedback (explicit ratings, implicit behavior like retry rates, abandonment) related to the outcome of a recipe execution.
4.  **Recipe Repository (RR):** Stores all recipes (original, AI-generated, modified) along with associated performance data and user feedback.
5.  **A/B Testing Framework (ATF):** Facilitates the deployment of multiple recipe versions (original vs. AI-generated) to different user segments for comparative analysis.

**Workflow:**

1.  A user request triggers the retrieval of an initial recipe from the RR.
2.  Before execution, the RCE analyzes the recipe, predicting potential performance bottlenecks based on historical data and API specifications.
3.  The RCE generates alternative recipe segments (operation sequences) optimized for performance or resource efficiency.
4.  The ATF deploys multiple recipe versions (original & AI-generated) to different user groups.
5.  The RPM continuously monitors the performance of each recipe version during execution.
6.  The FIM collects user feedback related to the outcome of each recipe execution.
7.  A reinforcement learning loop uses the performance data and user feedback to further refine the RCE’s recipe generation capabilities.
8.  The system dynamically adapts recipes in real-time, optimizing for individual user needs and environmental conditions.

**Pseudocode (RCE – Recipe Generation):**

```
function generate_recipe_segment(input_data, api_specifications, performance_metrics, user_feedback):
  // Prompt engineering: Construct a prompt for the generative model.
  prompt = "Given input data: " + input_data + ", API specifications: " + api_specifications + ", and performance metrics: " + performance_metrics + ", generate an optimized sequence of operations to achieve the desired outcome."

  // Generate the recipe segment using the generative model.
  recipe_segment = generative_model.generate(prompt)

  // Validate the generated recipe segment against the API specifications.
  if validate(recipe_segment, api_specifications):
    return recipe_segment
  else:
    // If validation fails, regenerate the recipe segment with adjusted parameters.
    return generate_recipe_segment(input_data, api_specifications, performance_metrics, user_feedback)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Recipe:** `{recipe_id: string, operations: [Operation], metadata: {creation_date: date, author: string}}`
*   **Operation:** `{operation_id: string, service_api: string, input_parameters: [string], output_format: string}`
*   **PerformanceMetrics:** `{latency: float, resource_utilization: float, error_rate: float}`
*   **UserFeedback:** `{rating: int, comments: string}`

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond static recipe execution by incorporating generative AI and real-time feedback to dynamically adapt recipes on-the-fly. This enables optimization for individual user needs, environmental conditions, and evolving API landscapes.
