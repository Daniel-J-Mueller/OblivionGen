## Automated Network Topology Discovery & Dynamic Configuration Blueprinting

**Specification:** A system for dynamically discovering network topologies, generating configuration blueprints based on discovered devices and their relationships, and automating configuration deployment.

**Core Components:**

*   **Topology Scanner:** A passive and active network scanner utilizing protocols like LLDP, CDP, BGP peering information, and ICMP to build a real-time graph of network devices and their interconnections. Supports multiple VLANs, VRFs and overlay technologies. Output is a directed, weighted graph representing the network topology.
*   **Device Fingerprinter:**  A module that identifies device types, models, and operating system versions through a combination of techniques: SNMP queries, TCP/UDP banner grabbing, and potentially, machine learning-based analysis of network traffic patterns.
*   **Intent Engine:**  Accepts high-level *intent* descriptions (e.g., “Establish a secure connection between sales and accounting departments,” “Prioritize VoIP traffic across the WAN”) and translates them into specific device configurations.  Uses a rule-based system combined with a knowledge base of best practices and vendor-specific configurations.
*   **Configuration Blueprint Generator:** Based on the discovered topology, device fingerprints, and intent specifications, this module automatically generates device-specific configuration blueprints. The blueprints include: Interface configurations, Routing protocols, Access Control Lists, Quality of Service settings, Security policies. Output is in a standardized format (e.g., YAML, JSON).
*   **Automated Deployment Engine:** Uses a combination of protocols (e.g., NETCONF, RESTCONF, SSH) to push the generated configuration blueprints to the network devices. Incorporates rollback mechanisms and conflict detection.

**Pseudocode - Intent Engine:**

```
FUNCTION process_intent(intent_description):
  topology = get_network_topology()
  devices = topology.get_devices()
  relevant_devices = filter_devices_by_intent(devices, intent_description)

  FOR device IN relevant_devices:
    device_type = device.get_type()
    operating_system = device.get_os()

    configuration_rules = get_configuration_rules(device_type, operating_system, intent_description)

    device_configuration = apply_configuration_rules(configuration_rules, device)

    add_configuration_to_deployment_queue(device, device_configuration)

  RETURN deployment_queue
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Network Graph:**  Nodes represent network devices. Edges represent physical or logical connections. Edge weights indicate bandwidth, latency, or other relevant metrics.
*   **Device Profile:** Stores information about each device: Type, Model, OS Version, Current Configuration, Capabilities, Supported Protocols.
*   **Configuration Blueprint:** A structured representation of the desired configuration for a specific device.  Includes configuration parameters, validation rules, and rollback instructions.

**Innovation Focus:**  This system aims to move beyond simple configuration management to *proactive* network automation.  By dynamically discovering the network topology and understanding device capabilities, it can automatically generate and deploy configurations based on high-level intent, reducing manual effort and improving network agility.  The ability to adapt to changing network conditions and automatically optimize configurations is a key differentiator. The system should be capable of operating in brownfield environments (existing networks) and greenfield environments (new deployments) with minimal manual intervention.
