## Adaptive Region Masking & Semantic Change Detection

**Concept:** Extend the region-based frame rate detection by incorporating semantic understanding of the video content *within* the selected region. Rather than simply measuring pixel changes, analyze *what* is changing, and prioritize regions exhibiting meaningful semantic shifts. This allows for more robust FPS estimation even with complex video content or low-motion scenes.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Video stream, initial region of interest (ROI) coordinates.
*   **Modules:**
    *   **Semantic Segmentation Module:** Employ a pre-trained (or fine-tuned) semantic segmentation model (e.g., DeepLab, Mask R-CNN) to identify objects and regions within the ROI (cars, people, text, background). Output: Pixel-level classification map.
    *   **Motion Vector Analysis Module:** Track motion vectors within the ROI. Utilize optical flow or block matching algorithms. Output: Motion vector field.
    *   **Change Significance Filter:** Assign a "change significance" score to each semantic segment based on:
        *   **Pixel Change Density:** Number of changed pixels within the segment.
        *   **Motion Vector Magnitude:** Average magnitude of motion vectors within the segment.
        *   **Semantic Class:** Certain semantic classes (e.g., fast-moving objects like cars) receive higher weighting.
    *   **Adaptive Region Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the ROI based on change significance:
        *   **Expansion:** If high-significance regions are detected near the boundary of the current ROI, expand the ROI to encompass them.
        *   **Contraction:** If low-significance regions dominate the ROI, contract it to focus on areas with meaningful changes.
        *   **Region Splitting/Merging:** Split the ROI into smaller regions if multiple high-significance areas are distant. Merge adjacent low-significance regions.
*   **FPS Estimation:** Calculate FPS based on the rate of significant changes within the dynamically adjusted ROI. Utilize a rolling average to smooth out fluctuations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
videoStream = getInputVideoStream()
initialROI = getInitialROI()
semanticSegmentationModel = loadSemanticSegmentationModel()
fpsHistory = []

while (videoStream.hasNextFrame()) {
    frame = videoStream.getNextFrame()
    segmentationMap = semanticSegmentationModel.segment(frame)
    
    significantChanges = []
    for (segment in segmentationMap) {
        pixelChangeDensity = calculatePixelChangeDensity(segment)
        motionVectorMagnitude = calculateMotionVectorMagnitude(segment)
        
        changeSignificance = pixelChangeDensity * motionVectorMagnitude * segment.semanticClassWeight
        if (changeSignificance > threshold) {
            significantChanges.append(segment)
        }
    }
    
    if (significantChanges.isEmpty()) {
        // No significant change, reduce ROI size or move to a new region
        roiSize = max(0, roiSize - reductionFactor)
    } else {
        // Adjust ROI based on significant changes
        roi = calculateBoundingBox(significantChanges)
        roiSize = max(roiSize, roi.size())
        
        // Calculate FPS based on rate of significant changes
        timeDiff = getCurrentTime() - lastChangeTime
        fps = 1.0 / timeDiff
        fpsHistory.append(fps)
        lastChangeTime = getCurrentTime()
    }
    
    // Smooth FPS history
    smoothedFps = calculateRollingAverage(fpsHistory, windowSize)
}
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Attention Mechanisms:** Incorporate attention mechanisms within the semantic segmentation module to focus on areas likely to exhibit changes.
*   **Multi-Resolution Analysis:** Analyze the video at multiple resolutions to detect subtle changes that might be missed at a single resolution.
*   **Contextual Reasoning:**  Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the temporal context of the video and predict future changes.
*   **Active Learning:** Dynamically update the semantic segmentation model based on the observed video content, improving its accuracy and performance.
