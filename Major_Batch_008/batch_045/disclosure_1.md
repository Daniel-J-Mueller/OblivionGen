## Decentralized Key Rotation & Policy Enforcement via Zero-Knowledge Proofs

**Concept:** Extend the patent's key holder concept into a fully decentralized system leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for key rotation and policy enforcement without revealing sensitive key material or policy details.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Requestor:** The entity initiating a request for a cryptographic operation.
*   **Policy Authority (PA):**  Multiple distributed entities collectively defining and managing access policies. No single PA holds the complete policy.
*   **Key Holders (KH):** Distributed entities holding shares of the private key. No single KH possesses the full key.
*   **Verifier:** A system component that verifies proofs and authorizes operations.

**2. Key Management:**

*   **Shamir Secret Sharing:** The private key is split into *n* shares using Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing scheme. Each KH holds one share. A threshold *t* (t < n) shares are required to reconstruct the key.
*   **Key Rotation:**  Periodic (or event-triggered) key rotation occurs without service interruption. New key shares are generated and distributed.  Old shares are archived (with appropriate security measures).

**3. Policy Definition & Enforcement:**

*   **Policy Fragments:** Access policies are broken down into fragments.  Each PA controls a subset of these fragments. Fragments are represented as boolean expressions.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Circuit:** A ZKP circuit is constructed that takes the request data, policy fragments provided by PAs, and a commitment to the operation as input.
*   **Proof Generation:** The Requestor (or Verifier) generates a ZKP demonstrating that:
    *   They possess the necessary permissions based on the combined policy fragments.
    *   The operation they are requesting is valid.
    *   They can perform the cryptographic operation without revealing sensitive data.
*   **Verification:** The Verifier checks the validity of the ZKP. If valid, the request is authorized.
*   **Decryption Delegation:** If the operation requires decryption, the Verifier uses a distributed decryption protocol (e.g., using the shares held by KHs) to perform the operation without revealing the full key.

**4. Pseudocode (Proof Generation & Verification):**

```
// Proof Generation (Requestor/Verifier)
function generate_proof(request_data, policy_fragments, commitment):
    // Construct ZKP circuit with request_data, policy_fragments, and commitment
    circuit = build_zkp_circuit(request_data, policy_fragments, commitment)
    
    // Generate proof using a ZKP library (e.g., libsnark, circom)
    proof = generate_zkp(circuit)
    
    return proof

// Verification (Verifier)
function verify_proof(proof, request_data, policy_fragments):
    // Verify the proof using the ZKP library
    is_valid = verify_zkp(proof, request_data, policy_fragments)
    
    return is_valid
```

**5.  Cryptographic Primitives:**

*   **ZKP Library:** libsnark, circom, or similar.
*   **Shamir Secret Sharing:** Standard implementation.
*   **Hashing:** SHA-256 or similar.
*   **Symmetric/Asymmetric Encryption:** AES, RSA, or ECC.

**6.  Scalability & Availability:**

*   **Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT):**  Use a DLT (e.g., blockchain) to manage policy fragments and key shares.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:**  Implement a robust consensus mechanism to ensure data integrity and availability.
*   **Load Balancing:**  Distribute workload across multiple Verifiers.



This system enhances security, privacy, and scalability compared to the original patent by decentralizing key management and policy enforcement. The use of ZKPs ensures that sensitive data remains confidential, while the distributed architecture provides high availability and fault tolerance.
