## Dynamic Skill-Based Matchmaking with AI-Driven Player Archetyping

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** AI-powered Player Archetype Engine.
*   **Data Inputs:** Real-time gameplay data (actions per minute, accuracy, objective focus, resource management, team communication metrics), player-declared preferences (role preference, playstyle), historical match data (win rate, K/D ratio, preferred maps/modes).
*   **Archetype Generation:**  The engine dynamically clusters players into archetypes *during* gameplay, not just pre-match. Archetypes are fluid and adapt based on evolving player behavior. Example archetypes: "Aggressive Frontline," "Tactical Support," "Objective Controller," "Roaming Harasser," "Resource Guardian." Archetypes are represented as vector embeddings capturing multi-dimensional playstyle characteristics.
*   **Matchmaking Algorithm:**  A dynamic, weighted scoring system that prioritizes archetype diversity *within* a match, in addition to skill level.  Higher scores for matches with balanced archetype representation. Algorithm continually learns from match outcomes to refine weighting factors.
*   **"Chaos Factor" Parameter:** A tunable parameter that introduces controlled randomness into archetype pairing. Higher values increase the likelihood of unconventional archetype combinations, fostering unique match dynamics. Lower values favor more predictable, balanced matches.
*   **Real-Time Archetype Adjustment:** Engine monitors player behavior *during* the match and subtly adjusts archetype assignments in real-time if their behavior deviates significantly from their initial archetype.
*   **Communication Integration:** System integrates with in-game communication channels (voice, text) to provide archetype-aware communication prompts and suggestions.  Example: “Aggressive Frontline: Push the objective!” or “Tactical Support: Provide cover for the team.”
*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database for storing player behavior data. Vector database for storing archetype embeddings. Relational database for storing match history and player profiles.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Player Action Event Handler
function onPlayerAction(playerID, actionType, actionData):
  captureActionData(playerID, actionType, actionData)
  updatePlayerBehaviorVector(playerID)
  recalculatePlayerArchetype(playerID)

// Matchmaking Request Handler
function onMatchmakingRequest(playerID, skillLevel):
  playerArchetype = getPlayerArchetype(playerID)
  match = findOptimalMatch(playerID, skillLevel, playerArchetype)
  if matchFound:
    assignPlayersToMatch(playerID, match)
    return matchID
  else:
    //Expand search criteria or queue player
    return null

//Finds an optimal match for a given player, balancing skill and archetype diversity
function findOptimalMatch(playerID, skillLevel, playerArchetype):
  potentialMatches = queryMatchmakingPool(skillLevel)
  bestMatch = null
  bestMatchScore = -1

  for match in potentialMatches:
    if match.isFull():
      continue

    archetypeDiversityScore = calculateArchetypeDiversity(match.players, playerArchetype)
    totalScore = (skillMatchScore * weightSkill) + (archetypeDiversityScore * weightArchetype)

    if totalScore > bestMatchScore:
      bestMatchScore = totalScore
      bestMatch = match

  return bestMatch

//Calculates archetype diversity for a potential match.
function calculateArchetypeDiversity(matchPlayers, newPlayerArchetype):
  archetypeVectorList = []
  for player in matchPlayers:
    archetypeVectorList.append(getPlayerArchetypeVector(player))
  
  //Calculate cosine similarity between the new player's archetype and all existing archetypes
  similarityScores = calculateCosineSimilarity(newPlayerArchetype, archetypeVectorList)

  //Calculate a diversity score based on the variance of the similarity scores.
  //Higher variance indicates greater archetype diversity.
  diversityScore = variance(similarityScores)
  return diversityScore
```

**Innovation Details:**

This system moves beyond static skill-based matchmaking by introducing dynamic archetype assignment. By continuously analyzing player behavior and adapting archetype assignments, the system can create more engaging and unpredictable matches. The “Chaos Factor” allows for controlled experimentation with unconventional archetype combinations, potentially uncovering new meta-game strategies and enhancing long-term player engagement. The system’s integration with in-game communication channels further enhances the player experience by providing archetype-aware guidance and fostering more cohesive team play.
