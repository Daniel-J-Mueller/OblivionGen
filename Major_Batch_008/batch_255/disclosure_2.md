## Dynamic Trust Network with Ephemeral Credentials

**Concept:** Expand the authentication framework to incorporate a dynamic trust network where devices aren't solely authenticated *by* a third-party service, but *through* a network of trusted peers, utilizing short-lived, dynamically generated credentials. This moves beyond a centralized authority to a more resilient and privacy-focused system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Peer Discovery & Trust Establishment:**

*   **Protocol:**  A beacon-based discovery protocol over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or similar short-range wireless. Devices broadcast minimal identifying information (public key fragment) and a trust score.
*   **Trust Score:**  Calculated based on several factors:
    *   **Direct Interactions:** History of successful authentications with the requesting device.
    *   **Indirect Attestation:** Trust scores relayed by other trusted peers. (A peer can vouch for another).
    *   **Reputation Service:** Optional integration with a decentralized reputation system (blockchain-based) to prevent Sybil attacks and malicious attestation.
*   **Trust Threshold:**  A configurable threshold for acceptable peer trust before initiating authentication.

**2. Authentication Flow:**

*   **Initiation:** Device A (requester) discovers nearby peers (Device B, C, etc.) and their trust scores.
*   **Peer Selection:** Device A selects peers exceeding the trust threshold.
*   **Ephemeral Credential Generation:** Device A requests an ephemeral credential (short-lived token) from the selected peers.  Peers generate a unique credential signed with their private key, bound to the requesting device's identifier (and a timestamp).  This credential isn't an authentication token for the third-party service *directly*, but proof of association with trusted peers.
*   **Credential Aggregation:** Device A aggregates these ephemeral credentials (signed proofs from peers).
*   **Third-Party Service Interaction:** Device A presents the aggregated credentials *alongside* the unique identifier (from the existing patent) to the third-party service.
*   **Verification:** The third-party service *verifies the signatures on the aggregated credentials* using the public keys of the attesting peers. It then cross-references the peers against a known "trust anchor" list (a list of peers the service explicitly trusts).
*   **Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment:** The third-party service adjusts the overall trust score of Device A based on the combined trust of the attesting peers *and* the validity of the credentials. This dynamic score influences the level of access granted.

**3. Key Management & Rotation:**

*   **Peer Keys:**  Each peer generates its own asymmetric key pair. Public keys are distributed via the discovery protocol.
*   **Credential Lifespan:** Ephemeral credentials have a very short lifespan (e.g., 30 seconds - 2 minutes) to minimize the impact of compromise.
*   **Key Rotation:** Peers regularly rotate their key pairs (e.g., daily or weekly) and broadcast the updated public key.
*   **Secure Storage:** Peer private keys must be stored securely (e.g., using a hardware security module or secure enclave).

**4.  Pseudocode (Authentication Flow - Device A Perspective):**

```
function authenticateWithThirdParty():
  peers = discoverNearbyPeers()
  trustedPeers = filterPeersByTrustThreshold(peers)

  credentials = []
  for peer in trustedPeers:
    credential = requestEphemeralCredential(peer)
    credentials.append(credential)

  uniqueIdentifier = obtainUniqueIdentifier()

  request = {
    "uniqueIdentifier": uniqueIdentifier,
    "credentials": credentials
  }

  response = sendRequestToThirdParty(request)

  if response.success:
    serviceAuthenticationToken = response.token
    return serviceAuthenticationToken
  else:
    return null
```

**5.  Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Resilience:** Decentralized authentication reduces the risk of a single point of failure.
*   **Enhanced Privacy:** Minimizes reliance on a central authority for authentication data.
*   **Improved Security:** Short-lived credentials and dynamic trust scores reduce the impact of credential compromise.
*   **Scalability:** The peer-to-peer network can scale more easily than a centralized system.
