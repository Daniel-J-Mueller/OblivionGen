## Adaptive Granularity Usage Tracking

**Concept:** Extend the partitioned batch processing to dynamically adjust the granularity of usage tracking based on real-time data patterns and predicted consumer needs. Instead of fixed application/instance-level aggregation, the system will dynamically create and tear down temporary aggregation dimensions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dynamic Dimension Creation Module:**

   *   **Input:** Stream of session events.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Continuously monitor session event streams for emerging patterns (e.g., a surge in usage of a specific feature within an application, correlated usage across different applications by the same user).
        *   Employ a machine learning model (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection) to identify significant usage patterns deserving of dedicated tracking dimensions.
        *   Upon detection of a pattern, dynamically create a new “dimension” for tracking – essentially a temporary application identifier. This includes allocating storage for aggregated metrics related to this dimension.
        *   Propagate the new dimension identifier to session event nodes.
   *   **Output:**  New dimension identifiers and associated storage allocations.

**2.  Multi-Level Partitioning:**

   *   Session event nodes partition updates not just by application identifier, but also by these dynamically created dimension identifiers.
   *   This results in a hierarchical partitioning scheme. The primary partition key remains the application identifier, with secondary partitioning based on dimension identifiers.

**3.  Adaptive Update Nodes:**

   *   Application usage update nodes are dynamically provisioned/de-provisioned based on the number of active dimension identifiers.
   *   Each update node is responsible for a specific partition (application + dimension).
   *   Nodes can be scaled horizontally to handle load.

**4.  Dimension Lifecycle Management:**

   *   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the usage volume of each dimension.
   *   **De-provisioning:**  If a dimension’s usage falls below a certain threshold for a defined period, the dimension is automatically de-provisioned. This involves releasing associated storage and removing the dimension from the partitioning scheme.
   *   **Archival:**  Historical data associated with de-provisioned dimensions can be archived for long-term analysis.

**5. Consumer Interface Extension:**

   *   The consumer interface allows users to query aggregated metrics across application identifiers *and* these dynamic dimension identifiers.
   *   This enables highly granular and customized usage analysis.
   *   The interface also provides tools for defining dimension creation/de-provisioning thresholds.

**Pseudocode (Dimension Creation):**

```
function detect_new_dimension(session_events):
  patterns = analyze_session_events(session_events) // ML model for pattern detection
  if new_pattern_found(patterns):
    dimension_id = generate_unique_id()
    allocate_storage(dimension_id)
    propagate_dimension_id(dimension_id)
    return dimension_id
  else:
    return null
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DimensionMetadata`: {`dimension_id`, `creation_timestamp`, `last_usage_timestamp`, `storage_allocated`, `usage_volume`}
*   `SessionEvent`: {`application_id`, `dimension_id`, `user_id`, `event_type`, `timestamp`}
