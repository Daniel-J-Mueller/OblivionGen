## Adaptive Acoustic Environments – Personalized Soundscapes

**Concept:** Extend the device targeting and content awareness to create dynamically adjusting acoustic environments within a space. The system learns user preferences and environmental factors to synthesize and layer sounds, creating immersive and personalized soundscapes. This goes beyond simply playing content on a device; it *becomes* the ambient audio of a room.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate the existing system with:
    *   Ambient microphones (array for spatial audio capture).
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, light levels).
    *   Occupancy sensors (detecting number and approximate location of people).
*   **Sound Database:** A curated library of high-quality sound elements (individual sounds, loops, atmospheric textures) categorized by:
    *   Type (nature, urban, music, ambient).
    *   Mood (calm, energetic, focused).
    *   Spatial characteristics (distance, direction).
*   **User Preference Profile:** Each user has a profile stored in the cloud, detailing:
    *   Preferred sound types and moods.
    *   Acoustic sensitivity levels.
    *   Time-of-day sound preferences (e.g., calming sounds in the evening).
    *   Association of soundscapes with activities (e.g., “focus” mode triggers specific sounds).
*   **Spatial Audio Engine:** A real-time audio processing engine capable of:
    *   Synthesizing complex soundscapes from individual sound elements.
    *   Rendering audio in 3D space, taking into account room acoustics and listener position.
    *   Dynamically adjusting sound levels and equalization based on environmental factors.
*   **Task Data Expansion:** Augment existing task data to include:
    *   Soundscape profiles (pre-defined or user-created).
    *   Spatial audio parameters (e.g., sound source positions, reverberation settings).
    *   Mapping of activities to soundscapes (e.g., "movie night" triggers a cinematic soundscape).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Load User Profile
Load Environmental Data
Load Task Data

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {

    // Capture Environmental Data
    EnvironmentalData = GetEnvironmentalData()

    // Determine Current Activity (based on voice commands, sensors, etc.)
    Activity = DetermineActivity()

    // Select Soundscape (based on Activity, User Profile, Environmental Data)
    Soundscape = SelectSoundscape(Activity, UserProfile, EnvironmentalData)

    // Generate Soundscape (mix sound elements, apply spatial audio effects)
    GeneratedSoundscape = GenerateSoundscape(Soundscape)

    // Output Soundscape to Devices (speakers in room)
    OutputSoundscape(GeneratedSoundscape)

    // Adapt and Learn (monitor user feedback, adjust soundscape parameters)
    AdaptAndLearn()
}
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user says, “Start focus mode.”

1.  The system identifies "focus mode" as the activity.
2.  It retrieves the user's preferred “focus” soundscape (e.g., gentle rain and ambient music).
3.  The spatial audio engine generates a soundscape that simulates a calming rainy environment.
4.  If occupancy sensors detect someone entering the room, the soundscape adjusts to maintain a consistent acoustic experience. If noise levels increase, the system subtly increases the volume or adds masking sounds.
5.  Over time, the system learns the user's preferences and adjusts the soundscape accordingly.
