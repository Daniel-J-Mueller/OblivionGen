## Personalized Avatar Skill Acquisition & Dynamic Roleplay

**Core Concept:** Extend the avatar system to allow customers to *teach* the avatar new skills during support interactions. These skills are then retained and can be leveraged in future sessions, offering a truly personalized and proactive support experience. Further, introduce dynamic roleplay scenarios *within* the support session, guided by the customer's stated needs and the avatar's evolving skill set.

**System Specs:**

*   **Skill Repository:** A cloud-based database storing modular "skill packages." These packages consist of:
    *   **Dialogue Trees:** Pre-written conversational pathways for specific tasks.
    *   **Animation Sets:** Corresponding avatar animations for each dialogue node.
    *   **API Integrations:** Connections to external services (e.g., account management, order tracking).
    *   **Skill Metadata:** Tags indicating skill applicability, complexity, and associated customer needs.
*   **Skill Acquisition Module:**
    *   **Interaction Monitoring:** Analyzes customer interactions (voice/text) for explicit skill requests ("Can you show me how to...?", "I wish you could...").  Also, infers needs based on problem description & attempted solutions.
    *   **Skill Proposal:** Presents potential skill packages to the customer for approval ("Would you like me to learn how to reset your password via voice command?").
    *   **Guided Training:** Leads the customer through a short "training session" â€“ the customer demonstrates the desired action, the avatar attempts to replicate, and feedback is provided.  Uses reinforcement learning to refine avatar performance.
*   **Dynamic Roleplay Engine:**
    *   **Scenario Generation:**  Based on customer need, constructs a simplified "roleplay" scenario. Example: Customer wants to understand a new feature. Scenario: Avatar guides customer through a simulated usage of the feature.
    *   **Branching Narrative:** The scenario dynamically adapts based on customer responses and actions, creating a personalized learning experience.
    *   **Skill Integration:** Leverages acquired skills within the roleplay scenario to demonstrate their utility and reinforce learning.
*   **Avatar Personalization Profile:**
    *   Stores customer-specific skill sets, preferred learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), communication preferences, and interaction history.
    *   This profile drives avatar behavior and ensures a consistent, personalized experience across all support sessions.

**Pseudocode - Skill Acquisition:**

```
FUNCTION AcquireSkill(CustomerID, SkillID)
  IF SkillNotAlreadyOwned(CustomerID, SkillID) THEN
    DisplayPrompt("Would you like to learn Skill " + SkillID + "?")
    IF CustomerAccepts() THEN
      InitiateTrainingSession(CustomerID, SkillID)
      WHILE TrainingIncomplete(CustomerID, SkillID) DO
        CustomerPerformsAction()
        AvatarAttemptsAction()
        ProvideFeedback(AvatarPerformance)
        RecordTrainingData(CustomerID, SkillID, Feedback)
      END WHILE
      StoreSkill(CustomerID, SkillID)
      DisplayConfirmation("Skill Learned!")
    ELSE
      DisplayRejectionMessage()
    END IF
  ELSE
    DisplayOwnershipMessage()
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Pseudocode - Dynamic Roleplay:**

```
FUNCTION InitiateRoleplay(CustomerID, ProblemDescription)
  Scenario = GenerateScenario(ProblemDescription)
  Avatar.LoadScenario(Scenario)
  WHILE RoleplayIncomplete() DO
    Avatar.PresentDialogue()
    Customer.Respond()
    Avatar.ProcessResponse()
    IF SkillNeeded() THEN
      InvokeSkill(SkillID)
    END IF
    UpdateScenario(CustomerResponse)
  END WHILE
  DisplayRoleplaySummary()
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Requirements:**  Standard customer computing device, cloud server infrastructure for skill repository and processing.

**Software Requirements:**  Speech recognition/synthesis, natural language processing, animation engine, reinforcement learning algorithms.
