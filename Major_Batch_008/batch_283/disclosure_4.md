## Dynamic Data Provenance & Synthetic Data Generation

**Concept:** Extend the data discovery/consumption service to not only *find* data, but actively generate synthetic datasets based on user-defined parameters and provenance tracking of existing data. This builds on the ‘validation’ aspect mentioned in claim 3, but goes far beyond it.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Provenance Engine:**  A module integrated with the existing persistent data store. It tracks the origin, transformations, and lineage of all datasets listed. Metadata includes: source, schema, applied transformations (e.g., cleansing, aggregation), user who performed transformations, timestamp, and any associated confidence scores.
*   **Synthetic Data Generator (SDG):** A configurable engine capable of producing synthetic datasets mirroring the statistical properties and schema of existing datasets.  Leverages techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or Differential Privacy mechanisms.
*   **Parameter Interface:**  A user interface (integrated with the front end module) allowing users to define parameters for synthetic data generation. Parameters include:
    *   **Data Volume:**  Desired size of the synthetic dataset.
    *   **Statistical Fidelity:** Level of similarity to the source dataset (e.g., correlation between variables).
    *   **Privacy Level:**  Level of noise/generalization to protect sensitive data.  (Differential privacy parameter epsilon)
    *   **Schema Constraints:**  Ability to modify or extend the original schema (e.g., add calculated fields).
    *   **Provenance Seeds:**  Option to inject specific provenance characteristics into the synthetic data. (e.g. “simulate data coming from source X with a 90% confidence score”)
*   **Data Quality Evaluator:** A module that assesses the quality of generated synthetic data, comparing it to the source data based on statistical metrics and schema compliance.
*   **Secure Enclave Integration:** Leverage secure enclaves to perform data generation and quality evaluation without exposing underlying data.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **User Request:** User submits a request via the front end module for a synthetic dataset based on an existing listing.
2.  **Parameter Definition:** User defines generation parameters using the parameter interface.
3.  **Provenance Retrieval:** The system retrieves provenance metadata associated with the selected dataset listing.
4.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** The SDG generates synthetic data based on the parameters and provenance information.  The provenance metadata guides the generation process, ensuring realistic data patterns and correlations.
5.  **Quality Evaluation:** The Data Quality Evaluator assesses the quality of the generated data.
6.  **Secure Transfer:** The synthetic dataset is securely transferred to the selected resource (as in the existing patent) for processing.

**III. Pseudocode (SDG Core):**

```
function generateSyntheticData(sourceDataset, parameters):
    provenance = getProvenance(sourceDataset)
    model = selectModel(parameters.modelType, provenance) //GAN, VAE, etc.
    trainModel(model, sourceDataset, provenance)
    syntheticDataset = generateData(model, parameters.dataVolume)
    applySchemaConstraints(syntheticDataset, parameters.schemaConstraints)
    return syntheticDataset
```

**IV. Novelty & Potential:**

This moves beyond simple data discovery/consumption to *active data creation*.  It addresses the growing need for synthetic data for testing, development, and data augmentation without compromising privacy or introducing bias.  The integration of provenance tracking ensures that synthetic data is realistic and aligned with the original data's characteristics. The configuration file would dictate model types, training parameters, and privacy constraints. This would allow for dynamic adaptation of synthetic data based on resource needs and risk tolerance.
