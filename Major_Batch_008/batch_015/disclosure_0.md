## Dynamic Page Role Prediction with Cross-Document Style Analysis

**Concept:** Extend page classification beyond content & location by incorporating stylistic feature analysis *across* multiple documents to predict page roles even in unconventional document structures. Current systems seem heavily reliant on *sequential* location and internal content. What if a document breaks that mold? Or what if we want to classify pages across *many* documents based on subtle stylistic commonalities?

**Specs:**

**1. Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Page image.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Visual Feature Extraction:** Utilize a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) to extract high-level visual features from the page image. These features should capture elements like font styles, layout, image placement, and overall visual complexity.
    *   **Textual Feature Extraction:** Employ Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from the page image. Analyze the extracted text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to determine document structure indicators (headings, lists, paragraphs) and content type (narrative, code, table).
    *   **Stylometric Feature Extraction:** Quantify stylistic elements:
        *   Font Family Distribution: Calculate the frequency of different font families used on the page.
        *   Font Size Variance: Measure the range of font sizes used.
        *   Line Spacing Distribution: Calculate the frequency of different line spacing values.
        *   Image Density: Calculate the proportion of the page occupied by images.
        *   Color Palette: Extract the dominant colors used on the page.
*   **Output:** Feature vector representing visual, textual, and stylometric features.

**2. Cross-Document Style Database:**

*   **Data Structure:** A searchable database of feature vectors representing pages from a large corpus of documents (books, articles, reports, etc.). Each entry includes the feature vector and a ground truth label indicating the page role (front cover, copyright page, table of contents, etc.).
*   **Indexing:** Implement a similarity search index (e.g., FAISS, Annoy) to enable efficient retrieval of pages with similar stylistic features.
*   **Dynamic Updating:** Continuously update the database with new documents and page role annotations.

**3. Page Role Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Feature vector of the input page image.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Similarity Search:** Use the similarity search index to retrieve the *k* most similar pages from the cross-document style database.
    *   **Weighted Voting:** Assign a weight to each retrieved page based on its similarity score. Calculate a weighted average of the page role labels of the retrieved pages.
    *   **Confidence Thresholding:**  If the weighted average confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, assign the predicted page role to the input page.  Otherwise, flag the page for manual review or further analysis.
*   **Output:** Predicted page role and associated confidence score.

**4. Refinement & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Manual Review Interface:** Provide a user interface for manually reviewing and correcting predicted page roles.
*   **Active Learning:**  Implement an active learning strategy to select the most informative pages for manual annotation, reducing the overall annotation effort.
*   **Model Retraining:** Periodically retrain the models using the updated training data, improving prediction accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_page_role(page_image):
    features = extract_features(page_image)
    similar_pages = search_database(features, k=5)
    weighted_votes = calculate_weighted_votes(similar_pages)
    predicted_role = determine_predicted_role(weighted_votes)
    confidence = calculate_confidence(weighted_votes)

    if confidence > threshold:
        return predicted_role, confidence
    else:
        return "Uncertain", confidence
```

**Innovation:**  The system moves beyond relying solely on sequential location and content analysis, allowing for more robust classification, *especially* in unusual or damaged documents where location cues are unreliable. The cross-document style database enables generalization and adaptation to diverse document types and styles, expanding the applicability of automated page classification. It essentially learns what "looks like" a table of contents, even if it doesn't appear where it 'should'.
