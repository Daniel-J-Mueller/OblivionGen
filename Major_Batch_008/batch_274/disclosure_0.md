## Broadcast-Based Dynamic Key Exchange & Attestation

**Concept:** Leverage the broadcast channel concept to establish a continuously rotating, dynamically generated key exchange *before* authentication data is transmitted, and *before* a user even requests it. This moves authentication from a request/response model to a proactive, continuous attestation system.

**Specs:**

**1. Beacon Generation & Broadcast (Server-Side):**

*   **Frequency:** Every `T` seconds (configurable - e.g., 5-30 seconds).
*   **Beacon Data:**
    *   `Beacon ID`: Unique identifier for this beacon cycle.
    *   `Cryptographic Seed`: A randomly generated seed.
    *   `HMAC`: Hash-based message authentication code, calculated using a pre-shared key (PSK) known only to the server and authorized devices, over the `Beacon ID` and `Cryptographic Seed`.
*   **Broadcast Channel:** Utilizing existing broadcast methods (radio, television, networked, etc.), but expanding the possible methods.
*   **Transmission:** Broadcast the data payload, along with metadata identifying it as a “Dynamic Key Exchange Beacon.”

**2. Device Listener & Key Derivation (Client-Side):**

*   **Passive Listening:** Devices continuously listen for “Dynamic Key Exchange Beacons” on specified channels.
*   **Beacon Validation:** Upon reception:
    *   Verify the HMAC using the pre-shared key (PSK).  Failure indicates tampering or an invalid beacon.
    *   Extract `Beacon ID` and `Cryptographic Seed`.
*   **Key Derivation:** 
    *   Using the `Cryptographic Seed` and device-specific entropy (e.g., a unique device ID, hardware random number generator output), derive a session key.  A robust Key Derivation Function (KDF) like HKDF is recommended.
    *   Derive a short-lived ‘Attestation Token’ using the session key, device ID, and current timestamp.

**3. Proactive Attestation (Client-Side):**

*   **Periodic Broadcast:** Every `S` seconds (configurable, e.g., 2-10 seconds), the device broadcasts its `Attestation Token` on a designated, narrow-band radio frequency (LoRaWAN, Sigfox, or similar low-power, long-range technology). *This is independent of any user request*.
*   **Token Format:**  `Attestation Token` =  `HMAC(Session Key, Device ID, Timestamp)`
*   **Purpose:** This broadcast serves as a continuous, verifiable assertion of device presence and legitimate access to derived cryptographic material.

**4. Server-Side Monitoring & Correlation:**

*   **Receiver Network:** A distributed network of receivers listens for `Attestation Tokens` on the designated frequency.
*   **Token Verification:** Upon reception:
    *   Identify the device ID.
    *   Attempt to re-derive the session key using the broadcast `Beacon ID` from the last broadcast cycle and the device's known entropy.
    *   Verify the `Attestation Token` using the re-derived session key.
*   **Proactive Trust Establishment:** Successful verification establishes trust *without* any user interaction. The server maintains a real-time map of trusted devices and their associated session keys.

**5. Authentication on Demand (If Required):**

*   If a higher level of assurance is needed (e.g., for a high-value transaction), leverage the established session key for secure communication and subsequent authentication protocols (TLS, digital signatures, etc.). No key exchange is necessary; trust is already established.



**Pseudocode (Device - Client Side):**

```
// Configuration: PSK, Listening Channels, Broadcast Frequency, S, T

LOOP:
    // 1. Listen for Beacons
    Beacon = ReceiveBeacon(ListeningChannels)
    IF Beacon.HMAC != CalculateHMAC(PSK, Beacon.BeaconID, Beacon.Seed) THEN
        // Invalid Beacon - Discard
        CONTINUE
    ENDIF

    // 2. Derive Session Key & Attestation Token
    SessionKey = KDF(Beacon.Seed, DeviceID, Entropy)
    Timestamp = CurrentTime()
    AttestationToken = HMAC(SessionKey, DeviceID, Timestamp)

    // 3. Periodic Broadcast of Attestation Token
    LOOP (every S seconds)
        Broadcast(AttestationToken, BroadcastFrequency)
    ENDLOOP
ENDLOOP
