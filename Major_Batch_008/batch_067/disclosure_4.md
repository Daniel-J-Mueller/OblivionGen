## Dynamic Source Map Stitching & Execution

**Concept:** Extend the proxy to not just *deliver* source maps, but actively *stitch* them together with the transformed code *during* execution, creating a runtime environment optimized for debugging. This moves beyond static source map delivery to a dynamic, interactive debugging experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** "Runtime Stitcher" - A module integrated into the proxy.
*   **Input:** Transformed code, source map(s), debugging application request.
*   **Output:** Dynamically assembled, debuggable code package.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Source Map Dependency Resolution:** Analyze source maps for further source map dependencies (e.g., modular code, libraries). Recursively fetch missing source maps.
    2.  **Code/Map Segmentation:** Divide both transformed code and source maps into logical segments/chunks based on function boundaries or code regions.
    3.  **Runtime Assembly:**  Instead of delivering a monolithic combined file, deliver these segments to the debugging application incrementally *as needed* during execution.  The debugging application would request segments based on the current execution context (e.g., function call stack).
    4.  **Execution Context Binding:**  The proxy maintains a binding between execution context (function address, line number) and corresponding code/map segment IDs.
    5.  **Segment Cache:** Implement a local cache within the proxy to reduce network latency for frequently accessed segments.
    6.  **Protocol Extension:** Extend the HTTP/WebSocket protocol to support segment requests and context binding information.

**Pseudocode (Proxy Side):**

```
function handleDebugRequest(request):
    transformedCode = fetchTransformedCode(request.codeSource)
    sourceMaps = fetchSourceMaps(request.codeVersion)

    segmentedCode, segmentedMaps = segmentCodeAndMaps(transformedCode, sourceMaps)

    return segmentedCode, segmentedMaps
```

```
function segmentCodeAndMaps(code, maps):
    // Logic to divide code and maps into chunks based on function boundaries
    // Returns two data structures: segmentedCode, segmentedMaps
    // Each segment has a unique ID
    ...
```

**Debugging Application Side:**

1.  Initial request for entry point segment.
2.  When the application encounters a function call in a different segment:
    *   Send a "segment request" to the proxy, specifying the segment ID.
    *   The proxy returns the corresponding code and map segment.
    *   The debugging application loads the segment and continues execution.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Initial Load Time:** The debugging application only loads the necessary code segments initially.
*   **Improved Responsiveness:**  On-demand segment loading minimizes latency during debugging sessions.
*   **Enhanced Debugging Experience:**  Dynamic loading enables more interactive and fluid debugging.
*   **Support for Complex Codebases:**  Handles large and modular codebases effectively.
*   **Potential for Remote Debugging:** The proxy could serve as a bridge for debugging applications running on different machines or platforms.
