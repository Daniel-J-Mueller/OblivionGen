## Adaptive Acoustic Event Library with Contextual Embedding

**Specification:** A system to dynamically build and refine an acoustic event library, coupled with a contextual embedding layer for improved detection accuracy and generalization.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *detecting* predefined acoustic events. This specification outlines a system that *learns* acoustic events based on user interaction and environmental context, generating a personalized and evolving event library.

**Components:**

1.  **Acoustic Data Ingestion:** Continuous audio stream input from a device (e.g., smart speaker, phone).
2.  **Novelty Detection Module:** An unsupervised learning component (e.g., autoencoder, one-class SVM) to identify sounds significantly different from known acoustic events. This module flags potential *new* acoustic events.
3.  **Interactive Labeling Interface:**  A user interface allowing users to quickly label flagged sounds (e.g., “Dog Bark,” “Car Horn,” “Breaking Glass,” “Unknown”).  Labels can be broad or specific.
4.  **Acoustic Event Embedding Layer:**  Each labelled acoustic event is converted into a high-dimensional embedding vector. This embedding captures the spectral and temporal characteristics of the event. A contrastive learning approach will be utilized, maximizing the distance between different event embeddings and minimizing the distance between similar event embeddings.
5.  **Contextual Embedding Layer:**  This component analyzes the surrounding audio and environmental data (e.g., time of day, location, detected speech content, other detected sounds) and creates a contextual embedding vector. This vector represents the environment in which the sound occurred.
6.  **Combined Embedding Space:** The acoustic event embedding and the contextual embedding are concatenated or combined using a learned weighting scheme. This creates a richer, context-aware representation of the acoustic event.
7.  **Dynamic Library:** The combined embeddings are stored in a dynamic acoustic event library. This library is continuously updated as new events are labeled and the system learns.
8.  **Detection Module:** Uses a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity) to compare the embedding of an incoming audio frame to the embeddings in the dynamic library. Detection is based on the closest matching event, weighted by the similarity score and contextual relevance.
9. **Active Learning Loop**: The system will actively request user confirmation on low-confidence detections, allowing refinement of the library and improvement of the detection model.

**Pseudocode (Detection Phase):**

```
function detect_event(audio_frame, context_data):
    # Extract acoustic features from audio_frame
    acoustic_features = extract_features(audio_frame)

    # Create acoustic event embedding
    acoustic_embedding = embedding_model.predict(acoustic_features)

    # Create contextual embedding
    context_embedding = context_model.predict(context_data)

    # Combine embeddings (e.g., concatenation)
    combined_embedding = concatenate(acoustic_embedding, context_embedding)

    # Calculate similarity to events in the library
    similarities = calculate_cosine_similarity(combined_embedding, event_library_embeddings)

    # Get the most similar event
    best_event_index = argmax(similarities)
    best_event = event_library[best_event_index]
    confidence = similarities[best_event_index]

    if confidence < threshold:
       request_user_confirmation(audio_frame, best_event) #Active Learning

    return best_event, confidence
```

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Standard audio processing hardware (microphones, DSPs).  Edge deployment possible with optimized models.
*   **Software:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, audio processing libraries (librosa, PyAudio).
*   **Data Requirements:** Initial training data for embedding models. Continuous audio data for learning and refinement.
*   **Scalability:** The system is designed to scale with the size of the acoustic event library and the volume of audio data. Distributed processing can be used to handle large datasets.
