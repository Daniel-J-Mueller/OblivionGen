## Adaptive Acoustic Projection Surfaces

**Concept:** Expand the projection surface functionality beyond visual display by integrating acoustic projection capabilities. Instead of *just* projecting images, the surfaces become directional sound sources, creating localized audio experiences tied to projected visuals or independent audio cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Surface Material:** Develop a composite material for the projection surfaces integrating micro-speaker arrays (piezoelectric or MEMS based) within a transparent or semi-transparent matrix.  The material must retain dimensional stability and optical clarity.  Target material thickness: 1-2mm.
*   **Speaker Array Density:** Target 50-100 micro-speakers per square foot of projection surface. Speakers should operate in a frequency range of 200Hz - 15kHz.
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Existing fiducial tracking & object positioning sensors are used to dynamically focus audio beams. This will require software modification to map 3D space coordinates to specific speaker array activation patterns.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge computing module (integrated within the presentation device) capable of:
    *   Real-time audio processing (beamforming, equalization, spatialization).
    *   Sensor data ingestion and synchronization.
    *   Communication with the image projector for synchronized visual/audio presentation.
    *   Wireless communication for remote control and updates.
*   **Power Supply:** Low-voltage DC power delivery to the projection surfaces via thin-film conductors embedded in the composite material.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Automated calibration process to map speaker array elements to the projected image and spatial coordinates. This involves emitting test tones and using the sensors to measure sound pressure levels at various points.

**Pseudocode (Audio Beamforming):**

```
function generate_audio_beam(target_x, target_y, target_z, audio_data):
  // audio_data: array of audio samples
  // target_x, target_y, target_z: 3D coordinates of the desired audio focus point

  // 1. Calculate the direction vector from each speaker to the target point
  for each speaker in speaker_array:
    direction_vector = (target_x - speaker.x, target_y - speaker.y, target_z - speaker.z)
    normalize(direction_vector) // Unit vector

  // 2. Calculate time delays for each speaker
  for each speaker in speaker_array:
    distance = magnitude(direction_vector)
    delay_samples = distance * sample_rate / sound_speed

  // 3. Apply time delays to the audio data for each speaker
  delayed_audio = []
  for each speaker in speaker_array:
    shifted_audio = shift_array(audio_data, delay_samples)
    delayed_audio.append(shifted_audio)

  // 4.  Amplify/attenuate signals to adjust beam intensity.  (Optional)

  // 5. Output the delayed and amplified signals to the speaker array.
  output_to_speaker_array(delayed_audio)
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Interactive Retail:** Project item information alongside localized audio descriptions or promotional messages.
*   **Immersive Gaming/Entertainment:** Create directional sound effects that enhance the visual experience.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide localized audio cues for visually impaired users.
*   **Dynamic Signage:** Combine visuals with localized audio alerts or announcements.
*   **Holographic audio effects:** combine visuals with a very localized beam of sound which 'attaches' to the visual to provide a stronger sense of presence.
