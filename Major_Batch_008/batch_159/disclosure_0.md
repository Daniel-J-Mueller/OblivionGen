## Adaptive Bioluminescent Doorbell

**Concept:** A doorbell system that utilizes genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria housed within a transparent, weatherproof casing. The intensity and color of the bioluminescence *changes* based on detected visitor characteristics â€“ creating a dynamic, visually informative doorbell.

**Specifications:**

*   **Housing:**
    *   Material: UV-stabilized, clear polycarbonate or acrylic. Weatherproof sealed design.
    *   Dimensions: Approximately 10cm x 10cm x 5cm (adjustable via modular design).
    *   Internal Structure: Contains a network of microfluidic channels to distribute nutrient solution to bacterial colonies.
    *   Power: Wireless charging or low-voltage DC power supply.
*   **Bacterial Culture:**
    *   Species: *Vibrio fischeri* (or similar, genetically modifiable species).
    *   Genetic Modification: Engineered to respond to specific stimuli detected by sensors (see Sensor Suite).  This would involve modulating the *lux* operon.
    *   Nutrient Solution:  Optimized growth medium circulated via microfluidic pump.  Includes compounds for sustained bioluminescence.  Self-replenishing system (see below).
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Microphone: Detects speech patterns/volume to discern urgency.
    *   Thermal Camera:  Detects body temperature/heat signature.
    *   Miniature Camera: Facial recognition/identification (optional, user-selectable).
    *   Proximity Sensor: Detects approach distance.
*   **Bioluminescence Control Logic:**
    *   Urgency (Microphone):  Rapidly pulsing, bright red bioluminescence.
    *   Known Visitor (Facial Recognition):  Soft, green glow.  Customizable color per user profile.
    *   Unknown Visitor:  Slowly pulsing blue glow.
    *   High Body Temperature (Thermal Camera):  Bright orange/yellow glow (potentially indicating illness - configurable).
    *   Proximity: Increasing bioluminescence intensity as visitor approaches.
*   **Self-Replenishing Nutrient System:**
    *   Small reservoir of concentrated nutrient solution.
    *   Microfluidic pump regulated by a timer and sensor data (bacterial density).
    *   UV sterilization system to prevent contamination.
*   **Communication:**
    *   Wi-Fi connectivity for user configuration and software updates.
    *   Integration with smart home ecosystems (e.g., Alexa, Google Home).

**Pseudocode (Bioluminescence Control):**

```
function updateBioluminescence(urgencyLevel, knownVisitor, bodyTemperature, proximity) {

  baseColor = "blue" //Default

  if (knownVisitor == true) {
    baseColor = getUserPreferredColor()
  }

  if (urgencyLevel > threshold) {
    baseColor = "red"
    pulseRate = fast
  }

  if (bodyTemperature > feverThreshold) {
    baseColor = "orange"
  }

  intensity = map(proximity, 0, maxProximity, 0, 100)  //Scale intensity to proximity

  setBioluminescence(baseColor, intensity, pulseRate)
}

//Main loop
while (true) {
  urgency = getUrgencyLevel()
  known = isKnownVisitor()
  temp = getBodyTemperature()
  prox = getProximity()

  updateBioluminescence(urgency, known, temp, prox)
  delay(100ms)
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Air purification system integrated into the housing.
*   Haptic feedback (vibration) to indicate visitor presence.
*   Customizable bioluminescence patterns.
*   Nutrient replenishment via atmospheric moisture absorption (advanced research).
