## Dynamic Skill Component Fusion

**Concept:** Extend the tiered rule-based skill component selection with a dynamic fusion mechanism. Instead of *selecting* a single skill component, the system orchestrates a *fusion* of multiple components, blending their outputs based on confidence scores and input characteristics. This allows for more nuanced and complex responses.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Skill Component Output Vectors:** Each skill component must output a vector of "confidence scores" alongside its primary output. These scores represent the componentâ€™s certainty regarding various aspects of its response (e.g., intent recognition, entity extraction, sentiment analysis).
2.  **Fusion Engine:** A new "Fusion Engine" module is introduced. This engine receives the primary outputs and confidence vectors from multiple skill components.
3.  **Contextual Weighting:** The Fusion Engine calculates weights for each component's output based on:
    *   **Input Characteristics:** Analysis of the natural language input (e.g., complexity, ambiguity, domain-specific keywords) to identify relevant component strengths.
    *   **Confidence Scores:** Higher confidence scores translate to stronger weights.
    *   **Tiered Rule Override:** The existing tiered rules act as initial filters, but the Fusion Engine can *override* these rules if other components provide sufficiently strong, corroborating evidence.
4.  **Weighted Averaging/Blending:** The Fusion Engine employs a weighted averaging or blending algorithm to combine the component outputs. The algorithm should be configurable to optimize for different types of responses (e.g., simple fact retrieval, complex reasoning, creative generation).
5.  **Output Vector & Metadata:** The Fusion Engine outputs a combined response along with a "metadata vector" that describes the contribution of each skill component. This allows for debugging and performance analysis.
6.  **Dynamic Fusion Graph:** Implement a "Dynamic Fusion Graph" that represents the relationships between skill components. The graph is updated in real-time based on performance data, allowing the system to learn which components work well together for different types of inputs.

**Pseudocode (Fusion Engine):**

```
function fuse_components(input_data, component_outputs, tiered_rules):
  filtered_outputs = apply_tiered_rules(component_outputs, tiered_rules)

  for output in filtered_outputs:
    output.weight = calculate_weight(output, input_data)

  total_weight = sum(output.weight for output in filtered_outputs)

  if total_weight == 0:
    return "Unable to process input"

  weighted_sum = [0] * len(filtered_outputs[0].output) # Assuming outputs are vectors

  for output in filtered_outputs:
    for i in range(len(output.output)):
      weighted_sum[i] += output.output[i] * (output.weight / total_weight)

  return weighted_sum, generate_metadata(filtered_outputs)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Train the Fusion Engine using reinforcement learning to optimize the weighting algorithm.
*   **Component Collaboration:** Allow skill components to directly communicate with each other and share information.
*   **Explainable AI:** Develop methods for explaining how the Fusion Engine arrived at its final response.
