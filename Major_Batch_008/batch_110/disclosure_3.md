## Dynamic Access 'Shadowing' & Predictive Revocation

**Concept:** Extend the existing access control system to not only regulate *current* access, but to dynamically 'shadow' user behavior, predict potential access misuse, and proactively revoke/restrict access *before* a breach occurs. This moves beyond reactive security to a predictive model.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiling Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time data streams of user actions: assets accessed, data modified, communication patterns (internal & external), time of access, location (if permissible).
    *   Process: Employ machine learning (anomaly detection, time-series analysis) to establish a ‘normal’ behavioral profile for each user, and for groups of users with similar roles.  This profile will be multi-dimensional, encompassing *what* they access, *when*, *how*, and *from where*.  Baseline data to be automatically collected over a configurable period (e.g., 30 days).
    *   Output:  A continuously updated “Behavioral Risk Score” for each user, quantifying deviation from their established baseline.

2.  **'Shadow Access' Log:**
    *   Function: In addition to the standard access logs, create a 'shadow' log capturing *potential* access attempts. This is achieved by intercepting access requests *before* full authorization, logging the request details (asset, intended action, user, timestamp, location), then proceeding with the authorization process.
    *   Data Storage:  Dedicated, secure storage with configurable retention policies.
    *   Purpose: Enables forensic analysis and replay of potential misuse scenarios.

3.  **Predictive Revocation Engine:**
    *   Input:  Behavioral Risk Score, Shadow Access Log data, predefined risk thresholds, and access control policies.
    *   Process:
        *   Continuously monitor Behavioral Risk Scores.
        *   Identify patterns in Shadow Access Logs indicative of potential misuse (e.g., repeated attempts to access restricted assets, access from unusual locations, accessing data outside normal working hours).
        *   Correlate Shadow Access Log events with Behavioral Risk Scores.
        *   If Risk Score exceeds a threshold *or* a suspicious pattern is detected, trigger a tiered response:
            *   **Tier 1 (Alert):**  Log an alert and notify security personnel.
            *   **Tier 2 (Restrict):** Temporarily restrict access to sensitive assets (e.g., require multi-factor authentication, limit data export volume).
            *   **Tier 3 (Revoke):** Automatically revoke access to specific assets or the entire system.
    *   Output:  Automated access control adjustments and security alerts.

4.  **Adaptive Thresholds & Machine Learning Feedback Loop:**
    *   Implement a system to dynamically adjust risk thresholds based on:
        *   False positive/negative rates.
        *   Changes in user behavior (e.g., new role, project assignment).
        *   Emerging threat intelligence.
    *   Utilize machine learning to refine the Behavioral Risk Score model and improve prediction accuracy.  Feedback from security personnel (confirmation of false positives/negatives) will be incorporated into the model.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Revocation Engine):**

```
function predictRevoke(user, asset, action):
  riskScore = getUserRiskScore(user)
  shadowLogEntry = getShadowLogEntry(user, asset, action)

  if riskScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD or shadowLogEntry.suspicious:
    if shadowLogEntry.suspicious == "repeated_access_denied":
      revokeAccess(user, asset)
    else if shadowLogEntry.suspicious == "unusual_location":
      restrictAccess(user, asset, requireMFA)
    else:
      restrictAccess(user, asset, limitExportVolume)
      logAlert(user, asset, "Potential misuse detected")
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond simply reacting to access violations to proactively predicting and preventing them by combining behavioral profiling, 'shadow' logging, and adaptive risk thresholds.  This system learns and evolves to anticipate threats before they materialize.
