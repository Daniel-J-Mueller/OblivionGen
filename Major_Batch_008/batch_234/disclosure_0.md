## Morphing Propeller Geometry via Embedded Shape Memory Alloys

**System Overview:** A propeller system employing embedded shape memory alloys (SMAs) within both fixed and collapsible blades to dynamically alter blade geometry in response to flight conditions and motor speed. This allows for optimization of lift, thrust, and efficiency across a wider operational envelope than traditional fixed-pitch propellers.

**Component Specifications:**

*   **Blade Core Material:** Carbon fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite. Lightweight and provides structural integrity.
*   **SMA Network:**  Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) alloy wires woven into a lattice structure *within* the blade core, both fixed and collapsible sections.  Wire diameter: 0.25mm. Spacing: 5mm. This creates a flexible, yet controllable internal structure.
*   **Electrical System:**  Low-voltage (12V) DC power distribution system embedded within the propeller hub. Individual control lines for each SMA network section within each blade.
*   **Temperature Sensors:** Miniature thermocouples integrated into each blade to monitor blade temperature and provide feedback for precise SMA activation.
*   **Microcontroller:** A dedicated microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) within the propeller hub to process sensor data, execute control algorithms, and manage power distribution to the SMAs.
*   **Collapsible Blade Mechanism:** Retains the basic pivot mechanism described in the reference patent but integrates the SMA network into the collapsible tip *and* the fixed root.
* **Aerodynamic Surface:** A thin, durable polymer coating (e.g., polyurethane) encapsulates the SMA network and carbon fiber core, creating a smooth aerodynamic surface.

**Operational Modes & Control Algorithm:**

1.  **Lift Mode (Low Speed/Vertical Takeoff/Landing):**
    *   SMA activation in both fixed and collapsible blades causes a slight *increase* in blade camber. This maximizes lift generation at lower speeds.
    *   Collapsible blades fully extend and lock in position, forming a larger rotor disk area.
    *   Control Algorithm: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control loop adjusts SMA current based on desired lift force and measured propeller RPM.

2.  **Thrust Mode (High Speed/Forward Flight):**
    *   SMA activation *decreases* blade camber, reducing drag and increasing thrust efficiency.
    *   Collapsible blades partially retract, reducing rotor disk area and minimizing induced drag. The degree of retraction is dynamically adjusted based on airspeed and desired thrust.
    *   Control Algorithm: Feedforward control based on airspeed and desired thrust, combined with PID feedback for precise thrust control.

3.  **Maneuvering Mode:**
    *   Independent SMA activation in individual blades to create asymmetric lift and thrust, enabling rapid maneuvering and agile flight.
    *   Control Algorithm:  Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm optimizes SMA activation patterns to achieve desired roll, pitch, and yaw rates.

4. **Emergency Brake Mode:** SMA activation creates a large degree of drag, rapidly reducing speed.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
// Global Variables
desiredThrust = 0.0
currentRPM = 0.0
airspeed = 0.0

// Function: Control Loop
loop:
    // Read Sensor Data
    currentRPM = readRPM()
    airspeed = readAirspeed()

    // Calculate Control Parameters
    thrustError = desiredThrust - calculateThrust(currentRPM, airspeed)

    // Calculate SMA Activation Levels
    smaActivation = calculateSMAActivation(thrustError, airspeed)

    // Apply SMA Activation Levels
    setSMAActivation(smaActivation)

    // Wait for next iteration
    delay(10ms)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Thermal Management:** Heat generated by SMA activation must be efficiently dissipated to prevent overheating and maintain performance.  Consider integrating microfluidic cooling channels within the blades.
*   **Fatigue Resistance:**  SMA materials are susceptible to fatigue failure under repeated cycling.  Careful material selection and design optimization are critical.
*   **Power Consumption:** SMA activation requires significant power. Optimize control algorithms and implement energy harvesting techniques to minimize power consumption.
*   **Blade Balancing:** Precise balancing of the propeller blades is crucial to minimize vibration and ensure smooth operation.
* **AI Driven Optimization:** AI may be employed to create complex and dynamic blade morphing patterns for maximizing efficiency and/or handling complex flight maneuvers.
