## Dynamic Presence-Triggered Augmented Reality Overlays

**Concept:** Leverage the presence information to dynamically trigger localized Augmented Reality (AR) experiences for users. This goes beyond simple service initiation; it creates contextual AR interactions based on location, availability, and potentially even predicted intent.

**Specs:**

*   **AR Overlay Engine:** A dedicated AR rendering engine optimized for rapid deployment of lightweight AR scenes. Supports common AR platforms (ARKit, ARCore, etc.).
*   **Presence Data Integration Module:** Module accepting presence data streams (location, availability, velocity, inferred activity) from the core presence system. This module prioritizes data fidelity and low latency.
*   **Contextual Rule Engine:**  A rule-based system that defines AR experience triggers based on the combined presence data and predefined location/POI data. Rules are structured as: `IF [Presence Condition] AND [Location Condition] THEN [AR Experience]`.  Example: `IF [User is walking] AND [Location is near coffee shop] THEN [Display AR Coffee Cup Icon with Directions]`.
*   **AR Asset Repository:**  A scalable repository storing pre-built AR assets (3D models, animations, sound effects, UI elements). Assets are tagged with metadata for efficient retrieval based on rule engine requests.
*   **User Preference Management:** Allows users to customize the types of AR experiences they receive (e.g., block advertisements, prioritize informational overlays).
*   **Privacy Controls:**  Robust privacy controls to ensure users are fully aware of data usage and can opt-out of AR experiences at any time.

**Pseudocode (Rule Engine):**

```
FUNCTION EvaluateRule(presenceData, locationData, rule):
  IF rule.presenceCondition.Matches(presenceData) AND rule.locationCondition.Matches(locationData):
    RETURN rule.arExperience
  ELSE:
    RETURN null

FUNCTION ProcessPresenceData(presenceData, locationData):
  rules = GetRelevantRules(locationData) //Fetch rules based on location
  FOR each rule in rules:
    experience = EvaluateRule(presenceData, locationData, rule)
    IF experience != null:
      TriggerARExperience(experience)
      BREAK //Trigger only the first matching experience
```

**Novelty:** This isn't simply about *initiating* a service based on presence. It's about creating an *interactive AR layer* that responds in real-time to a userâ€™s presence and surroundings.  The key is the dynamic and contextual nature of the AR experiences.  

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Retail:** AR product demos triggered as a user approaches a store.
*   **Navigation:** Dynamic AR arrows and guides overlaid on the real world.
*   **Event Discovery:** AR markers displaying event details when a user is near a venue.
*   **Social Interaction:** AR avatars or messages triggered when a user is near friends.
*   **Accessibility:** AR cues for visually impaired users based on location and surroundings.
