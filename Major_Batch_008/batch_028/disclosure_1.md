**Lock Screen Contextual Music Generation**

**Core Concept:** Dynamically generate short, ambient musical loops tailored to the user's immediate context as displayed on the lock screen. These loops aren’t *played* until the screen is woken, but are *prepared* in the background, creating a subtle anticipatory element.

**Specs:**

*   **Input Data:**
    *   Lock screen content (notifications, time, date, widgets).
    *   User's calendar data (upcoming meetings, events).
    *   Location data (general area, not precise tracking).
    *   Time of day.
    *   Weather data.
    *   Application usage patterns (recent apps, frequently used apps).
    *   User-defined ‘mood’ presets (e.g., ‘Focus’, ‘Relax’, ‘Energize’).
*   **Music Generation Engine:**
    *   Utilize a lightweight, generative music algorithm (e.g., Markov chain, LSTM network trained on ambient music).  The model should be optimized for speed and minimal resource usage.
    *   Parameter mapping:  Develop a system to translate input data into musical parameters (tempo, key, instrumentation, harmonic complexity).
        *   Example: A rapidly approaching meeting translates to a faster tempo and more dissonant harmony.  Calm weather and a ‘Relax’ mood translate to a slower tempo, major key, and soothing instrumentation (e.g., piano, strings).
        *   Priority given to calendar and location.
    *   Loop length: Generated loops should be short (3-8 seconds) and seamlessly loopable.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Background process: A dedicated background process monitors input data and generates loops as needed.
    *   Pre-caching: Store a small library of generated loops in memory for quick access.
    *   Screen wake trigger: When the screen is woken, play the most recently generated loop.
    *   User Control:
        *   Enable/Disable feature.
        *   Mood preset selection.
        *   Volume control.
        *   Option to specify preferred musical genres.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateLockScreenMusic() {
  data = collectContextData(); // Get calendar, location, weather, app usage, mood

  musicParams = mapDataToMusic(data); // Translate data to musical parameters

  loop = generateMusicLoop(musicParams); // Generate a short musical loop

  cacheLoop(loop); // Store loop for quick access

  return loop;
}

function mapDataToMusic(data) {
    // Rules to translate inputs into music parameters
    // Examples:
    if (data.calendar.nextEvent < 30 minutes) {
        tempo = 120;
        key = "minor";
    } else {
        tempo = 80;
        key = "major";
    }

    //etc...
}

function generateMusicLoop(params) {
  // Use generative music algorithm to create a loop
  // Based on params (tempo, key, instruments, etc.)
}
```

**Novelty:** This differs from existing lock screen features by *proactively* generating custom music based on context, rather than simply playing pre-selected tracks or responding to notifications. It adds a layer of subtle personalization and anticipation. The emphasis is on *generation*, not just *playback*.
