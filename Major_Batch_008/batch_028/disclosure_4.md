## Autonomous Route Anomaly Resolution System (ARARS)

**Concept:** Extending static route detection into proactive, automated remediation by leveraging software-defined networking (SDN) and predictive analytics. The core idea is to not just *detect* misconfigured routes, but to dynamically adjust network paths to mitigate their impact *before* significant disruption occurs, and simultaneously learn from these events to improve future routing decisions.

**System Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   **Route Anomaly Detector (RAD):**  (Based on existing patent's detection mechanism) - Monitors BGP advertisements and traffic flows.  Outputs "Anomaly Score" – a value representing the likelihood of a static route violation.
    *   **Predictive Route Analyzer (PRA):**  A machine learning module trained on historical routing data, network topology, and traffic patterns.  Predicts potential routing issues (e.g., link saturation, congestion) based on the Anomaly Score and other metrics.  Output: “Risk Score” indicating the probability of a service degradation.
    *   **Dynamic Path Optimizer (DPO):** An SDN controller that dynamically adjusts routing paths based on the Risk Score. It leverages pre-defined “mitigation policies” (e.g., reroute traffic through alternate links, apply quality of service (QoS) rules) to minimize the impact of potential routing issues.
    *   **Learning Engine (LE):**  A module that analyzes the effectiveness of mitigation policies and updates the predictive models used by the PRA.  It uses reinforcement learning to optimize routing decisions over time.
    *   **Telemetry Collector (TC):** Collects real-time network telemetry data (e.g., latency, throughput, packet loss) to provide feedback to the LE and PRA.

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  TC collects network telemetry and passes it to PRA and LE.
    2.  RAD detects potential static routes and assigns an Anomaly Score.
    3.  PRA combines the Anomaly Score with historical data and current network conditions to calculate a Risk Score.
    4.  If the Risk Score exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the DPO activates a mitigation policy.
    5.  The LE analyzes the effectiveness of the mitigation policy and updates the PRA’s predictive models.
    6.  The process repeats continuously, enabling the system to adapt to changing network conditions and improve routing decisions over time.

*   **Pseudocode (DPO Mitigation Policy Activation):**

```
FUNCTION ActivateMitigationPolicy(RiskScore, AffectedPrefixes)
    IF RiskScore > Threshold THEN
        FOR each prefix IN AffectedPrefixes DO
            // Determine optimal mitigation policy based on prefix and network topology
            policy = SelectMitigationPolicy(prefix)

            // Apply the policy using SDN controller
            IF policy == "Reroute" THEN
                // Modify flow tables to redirect traffic through alternate path
                ModifyFlowTables(prefix, AlternatePath)
            ELSE IF policy == "QoS" THEN
                // Apply QoS rules to prioritize traffic for the affected prefix
                ApplyQoSRules(prefix, PriorityLevel)
            ELSE
                // Log the unknown policy
                Log("Unknown mitigation policy: " + policy)
            ENDIF
        ENDFOR
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `RoutingTableEntry`: {prefix, AS_path, next_hop, metrics}
    *   `TrafficFlow`: {source_IP, destination_IP, protocol, port, bytes, packets}
    *   `MitigationPolicy`: {policy_name, affected_prefixes, action, parameters}
    *   `RiskAssessment`: {AnomalyScore, RiskScore, AffectedPrefixes, MitigationPolicy}
*   **Scalability Considerations:**
    *   Distributed architecture with multiple RAD, PRA, and DPO instances.
    *   Use of a centralized database for storing historical data and policies.
    *   Implementation of caching mechanisms to reduce latency.

*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Integration with network orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenStack).
    *   Support for multi-domain routing (e.g., BGP peering with multiple autonomous systems).
    *   Use of artificial intelligence to automatically generate mitigation policies.
