## Decentralized Session Key Orchestration via Blockchain

**Concept:** Extend the short-term credential system by anchoring session key generation and revocation within a permissioned blockchain. This introduces transparency, auditability, and enhanced security against key compromise.

**Specs:**

1.  **Blockchain Selection:** Utilize a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) optimized for throughput and privacy. Public blockchains are unsuitable due to data exposure concerns.

2.  **Key Generation Smart Contract:** Deploy a smart contract responsible for generating and managing session key pairs (public/private).
    *   Input: Account identifier, allowed access policies.
    *   Process: Generate a unique private/public key pair using a secure random number generator (hardware-based RNG preferred). Store the *hash* of the private key on the blockchain. The private key itself *never* resides on the blockchain.
    *   Output: Public key, transaction ID confirming key registration.

3.  **Session Token Format:** Modify the session token to include:
    *   Public Session Key
    *   Blockchain Transaction ID (linking to key registration)
    *   Timestamp of Key Creation
    *   Digital Signature (using a root key controlled by the security service)

4.  **Resource Access Validation:**
    *   Upon receiving a request with a session token, the resource server:
        *   Verifies the digital signature on the token.
        *   Queries the blockchain using the Transaction ID to confirm the public key's validity and timestamp.
        *   Validates access permissions based on the retrieved information and defined access policies.

5.  **Revocation Mechanism:**
    *   In case of key compromise or session termination, the security service publishes a revocation transaction to the blockchain. This transaction includes the hash of the compromised private key.
    *   Resource servers periodically synchronize with the blockchain to retrieve the latest revocation list.
    *   Any session token presenting a revoked key is immediately invalidated.

6.  **Account Key Rotation:**
    *   Implement a mechanism for periodic account key rotation, triggering new key generation and updating the blockchain record.

**Pseudocode (Resource Server Validation):**

```
function validateRequest(sessionToken, requestData):
  signatureValid = verifySignature(sessionToken, requestData)
  if not signatureValid:
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  transactionId = extractTransactionId(sessionToken)
  publicKey = extractPublicKey(sessionToken)
  
  blockchainValid = verifyKeyOnBlockchain(transactionId, publicKey)
  if not blockchainValid:
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  revoked = isKeyRevoked(publicKey)
  if revoked:
    return ACCESS_DENIED
  
  accessAllowed = checkAccessPermissions(publicKey, requestData)
  if not accessAllowed:
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  return ACCESS_GRANTED
```

**Novelty:** Anchoring session key lifecycle management to a blockchain introduces a level of transparency, auditability, and tamper-resistance not present in traditional centralized systems. This reduces trust assumptions and mitigates the risks associated with key compromise. The dynamic revocation list, updated through blockchain transactions, provides a robust and automated mechanism for invalidating compromised credentials.
