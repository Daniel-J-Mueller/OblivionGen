## Adaptive Persona Generation from Behavioral Co-Occurrence

**Concept:** Leverage the core idea of co-occurring actions to *dynamically* generate and refine user personas, moving beyond static demographic segmentation. This allows for real-time adjustments to user modeling and more granular personalization.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Ingestion & Processing:**

1.  **Action Stream:** Continuous ingestion of user actions within the network application (page views, clicks, purchases, content interactions, etc.). Timestamped and user-identified.
2.  **Co-Occurrence Matrix:**  Generate a matrix representing the frequency of co-occurrence of all action pairs within a defined time window (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).  This is the foundation, similar to the original patent, but extended.  `CoOccurrence(ActionA, ActionB, User, TimeWindow)` returns the count.
3.  **Persona Seed Identification:**  Initial persona “seeds” are defined. These aren’t strict profiles, but high-level archetypes (e.g., “Price Sensitive Shopper”, “Tech Enthusiast”, “Content Consumer”).  Each seed is associated with a *weighted* list of initial actions.  `Seed(PersonaID) -> [ (Action1, Weight1), (Action2, Weight2), ... ]`. Weights represent the initial likelihood of the action belonging to that persona.
4.  **Action-Persona Affinity Calculation:** For each user action, calculate an affinity score to each persona seed. This is done by summing the weights of actions associated with that persona, present in the user’s action history within the current time window.  `Affinity(Action, PersonaID, User, TimeWindow) = Σ Weight(ActionX) where ActionX is in User’s history within TimeWindow AND (ActionX, Weight) in Seed(PersonaID)`.

**II. Dynamic Persona Generation & Refinement:**

1.  **Persona Activation Threshold:**  Each persona has an activation threshold. If a user’s cumulative affinity score for a persona exceeds this threshold, the persona is “activated” for that user.
2.  **Persona Weight Adjustment (Reinforcement Learning):**  This is the core of dynamic refinement.  For each activated persona, monitor subsequent user behavior.  If the user performs actions strongly associated with that persona (high weight in the seed), increase the persona’s weight for that user. If they perform actions *not* associated with the persona, decrease the weight. Use a simple reinforcement learning mechanism (e.g., Q-learning) to adjust weights.
    *   `Q(PersonaID, User) = Q(PersonaID, User) + LearningRate * (Reward - EstimatedReward)`
    *   `Reward = 1 if User performs Action strongly associated with PersonaID, 0 otherwise.`
    *   `EstimatedReward = CurrentWeight(PersonaID, User)`
3.  **Persona Splitting & Merging:**
    *   **Splitting:** If a persona's weight distribution for actions becomes highly divergent (measured by standard deviation of action weights), *split* the persona into two new personas. This addresses the fact that individuals aren’t monolithic.
    *   **Merging:** If two personas have very similar action weight distributions and low activation rates, *merge* them. This avoids unnecessary fragmentation.
4.  **Real-time Persona Profile:** A dynamic, individualized persona profile is maintained for each user. This profile is a weighted distribution of personas, reflecting their current behavior.

**III. System Architecture**

1.  **Action Stream Processor:**  Responsible for ingesting, cleaning, and timestamping user actions.
2.  **Co-Occurrence Engine:** Calculates the co-occurrence matrix.  Utilize distributed processing for scalability.
3.  **Persona Engine:**  Implements the persona generation, refinement, splitting, and merging logic.  This is the core computational unit.
4.  **Persona Store:** Stores the dynamic persona profiles.  A key-value store is appropriate for fast retrieval.
5.  **API Endpoint:** Provides access to the persona profiles for other applications (recommendation engines, personalization systems, targeted advertising).

**Pseudocode (Persona Engine - Weight Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
function adjustPersonaWeight(user, personaID, action):
  reward = 0
  if action is strongly associated with personaID:
    reward = 1

  learningRate = 0.1  // Tune this parameter
  currentWeight = getWeight(user, personaID)
  estimatedReward = currentWeight
  newWeight = currentWeight + learningRate * (reward - estimatedReward)
  setWeight(user, personaID, newWeight)
end function
```

This system allows for continuous learning and adaptation to user behavior, going beyond static segmentation and enabling more accurate and effective personalization. It’s about building a dynamic model of user intent, not just categorizing them.
