## Adaptive Resonance Cleaning System - Aerial Vehicle Pitot Tube Integration

**Concept:** Leverage the principle of resonant vibration cleaning, but extend it beyond passive brushes to an *active* system that dynamically adjusts frequencies based on real-time contamination levels *within* the pitot tube itself. This shifts from a preventative measure to a responsive cleaning protocol.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Micro-Sensor Array:** Integrate a miniature array of MEMS-based vibration sensors *inside* the pitot tube, near the opening and at several points along its length. These sensors detect changes in airflow characteristics caused by contaminant buildup (ice, insects, dust). Data transmitted wirelessly.
*   **Piezoelectric Actuator Ring:**  A small ring of piezoelectric actuators is fitted *around* the exterior of the pitot tube, near the opening. These actuators generate precisely controlled vibrations.
*   **Signal Processing Unit (SPU):** Located within the aircraft avionics, the SPU receives data from the vibration sensors and controls the piezoelectric actuators. The SPU employs a feedback loop to optimize vibration frequencies and amplitudes.
*   **Frequency Mapping Database:** The SPU contains a pre-loaded database of resonant frequencies for various contaminant types (ice, dust, insects) and pitot tube geometries. The database is updated via machine learning based on collected sensor data.
*   **Adaptive Algorithm:** 

    ```pseudocode
    FUNCTION CleanPitotTube()
        // 1. Read sensor data
        sensorData = ReadPitotTubeSensors()

        // 2. Analyze data for contamination signature
        contaminationType, severity = AnalyzeContamination(sensorData)

        // 3. Select initial vibration frequency from database
        frequency = GetInitialFrequency(contaminationType, severity)

        // 4. Feedback Loop:
        WHILE severity > threshold:
            // a. Activate piezoelectric actuators at 'frequency'
            ActivatePiezo(frequency)

            // b. Read updated sensor data
            updatedSensorData = ReadPitotTubeSensors()

            // c. Calculate updated severity
            updatedSeverity = AnalyzeContamination(updatedSensorData)

            // d. Adjust frequency (using algorithm - see below)
            frequency = AdjustFrequency(frequency, updatedSeverity)

        END WHILE
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION AdjustFrequency(currentFrequency, severity)
        IF severity > previousSeverity THEN
            // Increase frequency slightly
            frequency = currentFrequency + increment
        ELSE IF severity < previousSeverity THEN
            // Decrease frequency slightly
            frequency = currentFrequency - increment
        END IF
        previousSeverity = severity
        RETURN frequency
    END FUNCTION
    ```
*   **Power Supply:**  Integrate with existing aircraft power systems.  Low power consumption is critical.
*   **Materials:** Piezoelectric actuators: Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) or similar. Sensor array: Silicon MEMS. Housing: Lightweight titanium alloy.



**Operational Notes:**

The system operates automatically, triggered by initial airflow anomalies. The SPU continuously monitors sensor data and adjusts the vibration frequency to maximize cleaning efficiency.  The feedback loop ensures that the system adapts to changing contamination levels and maintains optimal performance.  This moves beyond simply *preventing* buildup to *actively removing* it in-flight, maintaining accurate airspeed readings, and improving flight safety.
