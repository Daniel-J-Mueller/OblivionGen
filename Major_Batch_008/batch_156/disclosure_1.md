## Dynamic Documentation ‘Skins’ & Personalization

**Concept:** Extend the publication format adaptability to include fully customizable ‘skins’ for documentation, driven by user roles, preferences, and accessibility needs. These skins aren't merely visual changes (CSS) but deep structural modifications facilitated by the storage format described in the patent.

**Specs:**

*   **Skin Definition Language (SDL):** A declarative language defining the structure, content prioritization, and visual presentation of documentation. SDL will build *on top of* the existing storage format, not replace it.  Think of it as a "filter" applied during the conversion to publication formats. SDL will specify:
    *   Content blocks to include/exclude based on user role (e.g., ‘admin’, ‘developer’, ‘end-user’).
    *   Content re-ordering to prioritize information relevant to the user.
    *   Interactive elements (e.g., embedded quizzes, troubleshooting guides) to be added.
    *   Accessibility settings (e.g., font sizes, color contrasts, screen reader compatibility).
*   **Skin Repository:** A central repository (could be cloud-based) storing a library of pre-built skins for different user profiles and scenarios. Users can also create and share their own skins.
*   **Dynamic Skin Application:** During the conversion of documents from storage format to publication format, the system will:
    1.  Identify the requesting user.
    2.  Determine the appropriate skin based on user role, preferences, and accessibility needs.
    3.  Apply the SDL rules to the document content, dynamically restructuring and re-presenting the information.
*   **Skin ‘Layering’:**  Allow multiple SDL ‘layers’ to be applied to a document.  For example:
    *   A base ‘corporate branding’ skin defining overall visual style.
    *   A user role-specific skin prioritizing content for that role.
    *   A user preference skin customizing fonts and colors.
*   **Real-time Skin Preview:**  Within the documentation system’s UI, allow users to preview how a document will look with different skins applied *before* publishing.
*   **Skin Diff/Version Control:** Track changes to skins over time, allowing for rollback and collaboration.  Support a visual ‘diff’ of two skins to highlight changes.

**Pseudocode (Skin Application Process):**

```
function applySkin(document, user) {
  skin = determineSkin(user); // Select appropriate skin
  skinRules = loadSkinRules(skin); // Load SDL rules for the skin
  modifiedDocument = applyRules(document, skinRules); // Apply rules to document
  publicationFormat = convertToPublicationFormat(modifiedDocument, user.device); // Convert to format for user's device
  return publicationFormat;
}

function applyRules(document, rules) {
  // Iterate through rules
  for each rule in rules {
    if (rule.type == "include") {
      // Include specific content block
    } else if (rule.type == "exclude") {
      // Exclude specific content block
    } else if (rule.type == "reorder") {
      // Reorder content blocks
    } else if (rule.type == "addInteractiveElement") {
      // Add interactive element
    }
    //etc.
  }
  return modifiedDocument;
}
```

**Further Extensions:**

*   **AI-Driven Skin Generation:**  Use AI to automatically generate customized skins based on user behavior and documentation usage patterns.
*   **Skin Marketplace:** Allow users to buy and sell custom skins.
*   **Cross-Documentation Skinning:**  Apply a single skin across multiple documentation sets for a consistent user experience.
