## Secure Data 'Dusting' - Mobile Endpoint Data Sanitization & Transfer

**Concept:** Extend the physical media transfer concept to enable secure, granular data sanitization *at the source* (mobile endpoint – phone, laptop, etc.) *before* physical media transfer, combined with a continuous, low-bandwidth 'dusting' of critical data to the portable media. This creates a layered security and rapid recovery solution.

**Specifications:**

**1. Mobile Agent (Software - Client Side):**

*   **Data Classification Engine:** Real-time scanning & classification of data based on user-defined policies (PII, confidential, public, etc.). Utilizes machine learning for improved accuracy.
*   **Sanitization Module:** Securely overwrites or deletes data based on classification and policy. Supports multiple sanitization standards (DoD 5220.22-M, NIST 800-88).
*   **'Dusting' Engine:** Continuously (or scheduled) copies small, critical data chunks (encryption keys, authentication tokens, critical records) to the portable storage device. This happens in the background, minimizing impact on device performance.  Data is encrypted before writing.
*   **Policy Management:** Allows users (or administrators) to define data classification rules, sanitization policies, and 'dusting' frequencies.
*   **Tamper Detection:** Monitors the mobile agent for unauthorized modifications.
*   **Secure Communication:** All communication with the server/portable media is encrypted.

**2. Portable Storage Device Integration:**

*   **Secure Enclave:**  Integrated hardware security module (HSM) to store encryption keys and perform cryptographic operations.
*   **Write-Protected Area:**  A designated area on the device that stores critical system files and the secure enclave’s key.
*   **Data Encryption:** All data written to the device is encrypted using AES-256 or a similar algorithm.
*   **Tamper-Evident Packaging:** Physical security features to detect unauthorized access.

**3. Server-Side Component:**

*   **Policy Enforcement:** Validates and enforces data handling policies.
*   **Remote Wipe:** Ability to remotely wipe the portable storage device if lost or stolen.
*   **Data Recovery:** Enables secure data recovery from the portable storage device if needed.
*   **Auditing & Logging:** Tracks all data handling activities for compliance purposes.
*   **Key Management:** Manages the encryption keys used to protect the data.

**Pseudocode (Dusting Engine):**

```
// Configuration Variables
dustingInterval = 600 seconds (10 minutes)
dustingChunkSize = 1MB
priorityDataTypes = ["encryptionKeys", "authenticationTokens", "criticalRecords"]

// Main Loop (Runs in Background)
while (true) {
    sleep(dustingInterval)

    // Identify Priority Data
    priorityData = findDataOfType(priorityDataTypes)

    // Create Dusting Chunk
    chunk = createChunk(priorityData, chunkMaxSize = dustingChunkSize)

    // Encrypt Chunk
    encryptedChunk = encrypt(chunk, key)

    // Write to Portable Storage
    writeToPortableStorage(encryptedChunk)

    // Log Activity
    log("Dusting completed. Chunk size: " + size(encryptedChunk))
}
```

**Workflow:**

1.  User initiates data transfer/sanitization process.
2.  Mobile agent scans data and classifies it based on policy.
3.  Sensitive data is securely overwritten/deleted.
4.  Critical data is continuously 'dusted' to the portable storage device.
5.  The portable storage device is shipped to the data storage service.
6.  Data is ingested and stored securely.

**Novelty:** Combines data sanitization with a continuous 'dusting' of critical data. This offers a multi-layered approach to security and rapid recovery. It expands the physical media transfer concept beyond bulk data transfer. The 'dusting' offers near-real-time backups of vital information, offering protection from catastrophic data loss and significantly reducing recovery time.
