## Ambient User Persona & Predictive Communication Hub

**Concept:** An extension of the communal/personal mode switching, leveraging ambient sensing to create dynamically adjusting user personas and proactively initiate communication based on predicted needs/intent.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Ambient Persona Engine" (APE) – a software module integrating multi-modal sensor input (audio, video, environmental – temperature, lighting, proximity), user behavioral data (historical communication patterns, application usage, calendar events), and contextual awareness (location, time of day).
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution microphone array (for voice activity detection, speaker diarization, emotion analysis).
    *   Low-resolution wide-angle camera (for people counting, gesture recognition, object detection – e.g., identifying a laptop, whiteboard).
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, light, air quality) – integrated with device or external sensors.
    *   Proximity sensors (Bluetooth beacons, UWB) – for identifying nearby devices/people.
*   **Persona Generation:**
    *   APE continuously analyzes sensor data to construct a dynamic user persona profile. This profile isn't just a static identifier but a probabilistic representation of the user’s current state (e.g., “focused work,” “casual conversation,” “presentation mode,” “relaxed downtime”).
    *   Persona states are updated in real-time based on observed behavior. For example: detecting keyboard typing + focused camera view = "focused work"; detecting multiple voices + whiteboard presence = "brainstorming session."
*   **Predictive Communication:**
    *   Based on the current persona, APE predicts likely communication needs.
    *   Example: User in "focused work" persona – APE silences notifications, dims screen, and informs connected devices (smart speakers, headphones) to prioritize Do Not Disturb.
    *   Example: User in "brainstorming session" persona – APE automatically initiates a shared whiteboard session on a connected display, suggests relevant documents, and prompts participants to join a video call.
    *   Example: User detected leaving home – APE offers to initiate a hands-free call to a predefined contact (e.g., family member) or send a location update.
*   **Adaptive Communication Routing:**
    *   APE analyzes communication requests (calls, messages, notifications) and routes them based on the current persona.
    *   Example: Incoming work call during "relaxed downtime" persona – APE offers to forward the call to voicemail or schedule a callback.
    *   Example: Urgent message from a family member during "focused work" – APE bypasses Do Not Disturb and delivers the message with a high-priority notification.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All sensor data processing is performed locally on the device whenever possible.
    *   Users have full control over which sensors are enabled and what data is collected.
    *   Data is anonymized and aggregated to improve the accuracy of the persona engine.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   APE is implemented as a modular software component that can be integrated into existing devices (smartphones, tablets, smart speakers, smart displays).
    *   The persona engine is trained using a large dataset of user behavior data.
    *   The system uses machine learning algorithms to predict user needs and intent.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    sensorData = getSensorData();
    userBehavior = getUserBehavior();
    context = getContext();

    persona = generatePersona(sensorData, userBehavior, context);
    predictedNeeds = predictNeeds(persona);

    routeCommunications(predictedNeeds);
    adjustDeviceSettings(predictedNeeds);
}

//Persona Generation
function generatePersona(sensorData, userBehavior, context) {
  //Analyze data
  if (sensorData.microphone.activity && sensorData.camera.peopleCount > 1) {
    persona = "brainstorming";
  } else if (sensorData.keyboard.typing && sensorData.camera.focused) {
    persona = "focused work";
  } else {
    persona = "default";
  }
  return persona;
}
