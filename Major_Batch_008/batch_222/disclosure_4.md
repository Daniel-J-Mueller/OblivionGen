## Dynamic Power Allocation via Predictive Load Modeling

**Specification:** Implement a system for *proactive* power allocation within a server rack, leveraging machine learning to predict power draw *before* components request it. This moves beyond simply preventing overload â€“ it *optimizes* power delivery for efficiency and responsiveness.

**Components:**

*   **Rack Power Interface (RPI):** A module installed within the server rack, monitoring power draw of individual components (servers, network cards, storage devices) via high-resolution current sensors.
*   **Predictive Load Model (PLM):** A machine learning model, trained on historical power usage data, workload patterns, and component specifications.  This model runs on a dedicated processor within the RPI or a central data center server.  Model types to consider: LSTM recurrent neural networks, time series forecasting, or gradient boosting.
*   **Power Distribution Unit (PDU) Interface:** Direct communication link to the PDU controlling power delivery to the rack. Enables granular control over individual outlet voltages/currents.
*   **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):** Embedded software running on the RPI, prioritizing real-time data acquisition and control.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** The RPI continuously monitors the power draw of each component within the rack, collecting data points at a frequency of at least 1 kHz.  This data is timestamped and stored locally for short-term analysis and for training the PLM.
2.  **Predictive Modeling:** The PLM uses historical data and current workload patterns to *predict* the future power draw of each component over a sliding window (e.g., the next 5 seconds).  Inputs to the model include:
    *   Current power draw of each component.
    *   CPU utilization, memory usage, network traffic of servers.
    *   Storage I/O rates.
    *   Time of day, day of week, known workload schedules.
    *   Component specifications (maximum power draw, efficiency curves).
3.  **Proactive Power Allocation:** Based on the PLM's predictions, the RPI sends commands to the PDU to *pre-allocate* power to components. This means increasing the voltage/current delivered to components *before* they actually request it. The system will pre-emptively set PSU output to the anticipated levels.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The RPI continuously monitors the actual power draw of components and compares it to the PLM's predictions.  If there is a significant discrepancy, the system adjusts the power allocation accordingly.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** Data from the actual power draw and any discrepancies is fed back into the PLM to improve its accuracy over time. The machine learning model retrains during off-peak hours to adapt to changing workloads and component characteristics.

**Pseudocode (Simplified PLM Update):**

```
// Data Acquisition
FOR each component IN rack:
    current_power = read_power_sensor(component)
    data_points.append((timestamp, current_power))

// Prediction
predicted_power = PLM.predict(data_points)

// Power Allocation
FOR each component IN rack:
    pdu.set_output(component, predicted_power[component])

// Monitoring & Adjustment
actual_power = read_power_sensor(component)
error = actual_power - predicted_power[component]
IF abs(error) > threshold:
    pdu.adjust_output(component, error)
    // Log error for model retraining
    log_error(error)

// Model Retraining (Off-Peak Hours)
IF time == off_peak:
    PLM.retrain(logged_errors)
```

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency: Pre-allocation eliminates the delay associated with responding to power requests.
*   Improved efficiency: Optimizes power delivery to match actual demand.
*   Enhanced stability: Prevents power spikes and brownouts.
*   Predictive maintenance: Detects failing components based on anomalous power draw patterns.
