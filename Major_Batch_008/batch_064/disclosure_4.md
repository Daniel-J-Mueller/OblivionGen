## Dynamic Illumination & Haptic Feedback E-Reader Cover

**Concept:** Integrate a micro-projector and haptic feedback system into an e-reader cover, allowing for projected supplemental information *onto* the book’s pages and localized tactile responses linked to on-screen content.

**Specifications:**

*   **Cover Material:** Multi-layered composite – rigid outer shell (polycarbonate), inner shock-absorbing layer (TPU), and integrated flexible circuit layer.
*   **Micro-Projector:** Pico-projector module (0.5cm x 2cm x 1cm) embedded in the cover spine. Resolution: 640x480. Brightness adjustable up to 30 lumens. Focus adjustable via a micro-dial on the cover. Power draw: 1W max.
*   **Projection System:** A series of micro-lenses and a diffuser layer positioned at the projection window to spread light evenly across the open book pages. Alignment mechanism (micro-adjusters) to ensure accurate projection onto the page.
*   **Haptic Engine:** An array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar) embedded within the cover, aligned with typical reading areas. Each actuator provides localized vibration or pressure. Array resolution: 10x15 actuators.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Page Detection: Optical sensors to detect page turns automatically.
    *   Orientation Sensor: Accelerometer/Gyroscope to determine reading orientation.
    *   Proximity Sensor: To activate/deactivate projection when the cover is open/closed.
*   **Power:** Power sourced from e-reader via physical-electrical coupling (existing hook implementation). Additional small internal battery for backup and extended runtime. Wireless charging capability.
*   **Control System:** Bluetooth connectivity to e-reader. Custom application for content control. User-adjustable parameters: projection brightness, haptic intensity, content source.
*   **Content Integration:**
    *   Dictionary Lookup: Projected definitions appear near the selected word.
    *   Character Profiles: Projected character information (names, relationships) linked to character mentions.
    *   Map Display: Projected maps relevant to the story’s setting.
    *   Haptic Feedback:
        *   Button presses: Simulated tactile “clicks” for on-screen button interactions.
        *   Texture Simulation: Varying vibration patterns to simulate textures described in the text.
        *   Emotional Cues: Subtle vibrations to enhance emotional impact of scenes.

**Pseudocode – Content Engine:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessText(text, pageNumber)
    // Analyze text for keywords (definitions, character names, locations)
    keywords = AnalyzeText(text)

    // For each keyword
    FOR EACH keyword IN keywords
        IF keyword.type == "definition"
            // Project definition near keyword location on page
            ProjectContent(keyword.definition, keyword.location, pageNumber)
        ELSE IF keyword.type == "character"
            // If character profile exists
            IF CharacterProfileExists(keyword.name)
                // Project character profile link
                ProjectContent(CharacterProfileLink(keyword.name), keyword.location, pageNumber)
            END IF
        ELSE IF keyword.type == "location"
            // If map exists for location
            IF MapExists(keyword.location)
                // Project map link
                ProjectContent(MapLink(keyword.location), keyword.location, pageNumber)
            END IF
        END IF

        // Trigger haptic feedback
        TriggerHapticFeedback(keyword.type, keyword.intensity)
    END FOR
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION TriggerHapticFeedback(type, intensity)
    // Based on type, select appropriate haptic pattern
    IF type == "button_press"
        // Apply short, sharp vibration
        Vibrate(frequency=200Hz, duration=50ms, intensity=intensity)
    ELSE IF type == "texture_simulation"
        // Apply varying vibration pattern
        ApplyTexturePattern(pattern, intensity)
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Future Considerations:**

*   Integration with AI-powered text analysis for real-time content projection and haptic feedback.
*   Adaptive projection – adjusting brightness and focus based on ambient lighting conditions.
*   Personalized content – allowing users to customize the projected information and haptic feedback.
*   Biometric integration for reader-specific data and feedback.
