# 11599813

## Adaptive Workflow Component Library

**Specification:** A system for dynamically composing machine learning workflows from a library of pre-built, parameterized components. This library operates *within* the existing system described in patent 11599813, but adds a layer of modularity and adaptability not currently present.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Component Registry:** A central repository storing individual ML workflow components. Each component is defined by:
    *   **Functionality:** (e.g., data cleaning, feature engineering, model training â€“ specific algorithm selectable, model evaluation, data drift detection)
    *   **Input Schema:** Defined data types and expected formats.
    *   **Output Schema:** Defined data types and expected formats.
    *   **Parameters:** Configurable settings (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength, evaluation metrics, data source connection).
    *   **Resource Requirements:** CPU, memory, GPU needs.
    *   **Dependencies:** Links to other components or external libraries.
    *   **Version Control:** Tracks component revisions and allows rollback.

2.  **Workflow Composition Engine:** An algorithm that dynamically assembles workflows based on user-defined goals and constraints.
    *   **Goal Input:** User specifies a high-level objective (e.g., "predict customer churn with high accuracy," "identify fraudulent transactions in real-time").
    *   **Constraint Input:** User specifies resource limitations (e.g., maximum cost, latency requirements).
    *   **Search Algorithm:** Employs a search strategy (e.g., genetic algorithm, reinforcement learning) to explore the component registry and identify optimal workflow configurations.
    *   **Validation Module:** Tests the assembled workflow using a validation dataset to ensure it meets performance criteria.

3.  **Runtime Environment:** Executes the assembled workflow using the provisioned computing resources.
    *   **Orchestration Layer:** Manages the execution of individual components and their dependencies.
    *   **Monitoring & Logging:** Tracks workflow performance and logs relevant data for debugging and analysis.
    *   **Auto-Scaling:** Dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on workload demands.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Composition Engine):**

```
FUNCTION ComposeWorkflow(goal, constraints, componentRegistry):
  // Initialize a population of candidate workflows (randomly assembled).
  population = InitializePopulation(componentRegistry)

  WHILE NOT TerminationConditionMet():
    // Evaluate the fitness of each workflow in the population.
    FOR EACH workflow IN population:
      fitness = EvaluateFitness(workflow, goal, constraints)
      AssignFitness(workflow, fitness)

    // Select the best workflows from the population.
    selectedWorkflows = SelectWorkflows(population)

    // Create new workflows through crossover and mutation.
    newWorkflows = CrossoverAndMutate(selectedWorkflows, componentRegistry)

    // Replace the old population with the new population.
    population = newWorkflows

  // Return the best workflow from the final population.
  RETURN GetBestWorkflow(population)

FUNCTION EvaluateFitness(workflow, goal, constraints):
  // Execute the workflow on a validation dataset.
  results = ExecuteWorkflow(workflow, validationDataset)

  // Calculate a fitness score based on the results and constraints.
  fitness = CalculateFitness(results, goal, constraints)

  RETURN fitness
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond *predefined* workflows, allowing for dynamic, adaptive workflows tailored to specific goals and constraints. The component library provides a modular building block approach, enabling rapid experimentation and optimization.  The system learns which components best achieve specific objectives, and automatically composes those components to achieve a new given objective. This reduces the need for manual workflow design and allows the system to adapt to changing data patterns and business requirements. The potential exists to introduce an automated component creation system, effectively building new components from data based on the patterns it recognizes.
