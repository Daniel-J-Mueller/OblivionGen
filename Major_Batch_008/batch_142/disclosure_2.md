## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted User Intent

**Concept:** Extend reload event analysis to *predict* likely user intent *before* a full reload is initiated, and dynamically adjust resource allocation to pre-fetch data or components, reducing perceived latency and improving responsiveness.

**Specs:**

1.  **Intent Modeling Module:**
    *   Input: Client data object (from the existing patent), user history (stored server-side), contextual data (time of day, location if available, etc.).
    *   Process: Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, transformer) trained on user behavior patterns. The model predicts the probability of different user intents (e.g., viewing a specific section, completing a form, initiating a search).
    *   Output: Probability distribution over potential user intents.

2.  **Resource Allocation Manager:**
    *   Input: Probability distribution from Intent Modeling Module, current web resource state, server resource availability.
    *   Process: Based on the probabilities, prioritize resource allocation. For intents with high probability, pre-fetch data, render components in the background, or optimize database queries. This can include pre-loading images, scripts, or API responses.
    *   Output: Resource allocation plan (list of resources to pre-fetch, rendering priorities, query optimizations).

3.  **Client-Side Integration:**
    *   Modified detection script:  In addition to capturing reload event data, the script transmits intent predictions (from the client-side model - a simplified version of the server model). This allows for immediate client-side responsiveness if the prediction is accurate.
    *   Adaptive rendering: The client-side application utilizes the resource allocation plan to render components progressively. Components predicted to be needed are prioritized.

4.  **Server-Side Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor the accuracy of intent predictions.
    *   Adjust the machine learning model based on observed user behavior.
    *   Dynamically adjust resource allocation policies based on server load and user demand.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side - Resource Allocation Manager):**

```
function allocateResources(clientData, userHistory, contextualData):
  intentProbabilities = IntentModelingModule.predictIntent(clientData, userHistory, contextualData)

  resourcePlan = {}
  for intent, probability in intentProbabilities:
    if probability > threshold:  // e.g., 0.7
      resources = GetResourcesForIntent(intent)  // Function to retrieve needed assets
      resourcePlan[intent] = resources

  // Optimize resource requests based on server load
  optimizedPlan = ResourceOptimizer.optimize(resourcePlan, serverLoad)

  return optimizedPlan
```

**Innovation:**  Moves beyond *reacting* to reloads to *anticipating* user needs.  This shifts the focus from damage control (reducing reload latency) to proactive enhancement of the user experience. The system doesn't just analyze *what* happened, it predicts *what will happen next*.
