## Dynamic Barrier Weighting & Predictive Route Adjustment

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on static barriers and cost allocation *after* polygons are generated. This expands on that by introducing dynamic barrier weighting based on real-time conditions (weather, traffic, events) *during* polygon generation and, critically, implementing a predictive adjustment of routes *before* deviations occur.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion Module:**

*   **Input:** Standard geospatial vector data, barrier data (Shapefiles, GeoJSON), *real-time* data feeds (traffic APIs – Google, Waze, TomTom; weather APIs; event calendars – concerts, sporting events, protests; social media data – reports of accidents or closures).
*   **Processing:**  Data normalization and conversion to a common geospatial format.  Real-time data is categorized and assigned a ‘Barrier Influence Score’ (BIS). BIS values range from 0-1, with 0 indicating no influence and 1 indicating complete impassability.  BIS is calculated based on data source reliability, severity of the condition (e.g., accident severity, flood depth), and temporal decay (impact diminishes over time).

**2. Dynamic Polygon Generation Module:**

*   **Algorithm:** Modified cost allocation algorithm incorporating BIS.  Instead of static barrier costs, polygon creation prioritizes minimizing overall travel *risk* (weighted cost) instead of purely distance or time. This means polygons will naturally ‘bend’ around areas with high BIS, even if it increases the direct distance.
*   **Variable Barrier Cost:** Barrier cost is no longer fixed. It’s dynamically calculated as: `BarrierCost = BaseCost * (1 + BIS)`.  BaseCost represents the inherent difficulty of crossing the barrier (highway = lower cost, mountain = higher cost).
*   **Polygon Refinement:**  After initial polygon creation, a refinement stage optimizes polygon shapes to minimize the total weighted cost of travel within and between polygons.

**3. Predictive Route Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Historical Data Integration:**  Integrates historical delivery data with real-time data. Identifies recurring patterns of congestion or delays in specific areas.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Employs a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future traffic conditions and potential disruptions.
*   **Proactive Route Modification:** *Before* a delivery vehicle encounters a known or predicted disruption, the engine calculates alternative routes that minimize expected travel time and risk.
*   **Route Buffer:** Creates a ‘buffer zone’ around predicted disruptions, rerouting vehicles proactively to avoid potential congestion.

**4. Route Communication & Visualization:**

*   **API Integration:** Provides APIs for integration with existing delivery management systems and driver mobile apps.
*   **Real-time Route Updates:** Pushes updated route instructions to driver devices in real-time.
*   **Visualization Dashboard:** Provides a web-based dashboard for visualizing predicted disruptions, alternative routes, and overall delivery network performance.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Route Adjustment Engine):**

```
FUNCTION PredictRoute(vehicleID, currentPolygon, destinationPolygon):
  // 1. Fetch historical data for route between current and destination polygon
  historicalData = FetchHistoricalData(currentPolygon, destinationPolygon)

  // 2. Fetch real-time data for route
  realTimeData = FetchRealTimeData(currentPolygon, destinationPolygon)

  // 3. Predict future traffic conditions based on historical and real-time data
  predictedTraffic = PredictTraffic(historicalData, realTimeData)

  // 4. Calculate baseline route using existing polygons and predicted traffic
  baselineRoute = CalculateRoute(currentPolygon, destinationPolygon, predictedTraffic)

  // 5. Generate alternative routes considering potential disruptions
  alternativeRoutes = GenerateAlternativeRoutes(currentPolygon, destinationPolygon, predictedTraffic)

  // 6. Evaluate alternative routes based on cost, risk, and reliability
  bestRoute = EvaluateRoutes(alternativeRoutes, predictedTraffic)

  // 7. Return the best route
  RETURN bestRoute
```
