## Digital Asset 'Ghost' Ownership & Behavioral Triggered Access

**Concept:** Extend the shared secret access idea to encompass behavioral biometrics and a tiered 'ghost' ownership system allowing for automated asset distribution based on pre-defined life events *and* ongoing behavioral validation. This isn't just about *who* has the shares, but *how* they behave.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Creation:**

*   **Data Collection:** Implement passive data collection (with user consent, obviously) of behavioral biometrics. This includes:
    *   Typing rhythm (keystroke dynamics)
    *   Mouse movement patterns
    *   Scrolling speed and patterns
    *   Device usage times and locations (geofencing)
    *   App usage patterns (what apps are used, when, and for how long)
*   **Profile Storage:** Securely store these profiles, encrypted and linked to the individual recipient’s share.  Utilize a federated learning approach to improve accuracy without centralizing the raw data.
*   **Baseline Establishment:** Establish a baseline behavioral profile for each recipient over a defined period. This acts as the ‘normal’ behavior to compare against.
*   **Deviation Thresholds:** Configure adjustable deviation thresholds. Small deviations are ignored, moderate deviations trigger alerts, and significant deviations indicate potential compromise or incapacitation.

**2. Tiered Ghost Ownership:**

*   **Primary Owner:** The original asset owner. Retains ultimate control but defines the tiers and triggers.
*   **Tier 1 (Immediate Access):** Recipients with shares *and* validated behavioral profiles. Access granted upon triggering event (death, incapacitation) *and* successful behavioral verification.
*   **Tier 2 (Conditional Access):** Recipients with shares. Access granted after a delay period (e.g., 30 days) *if* Tier 1 recipients haven’t established consistent access or have shown behavioral anomalies. Acts as a safety net.
*   **Tier 3 (Long-Term Access):** Recipients with shares. Access granted only after a prolonged period (e.g., 1 year) without access by Tier 1 or Tier 2. Used for estate planning or distant beneficiaries.

**3. Triggering Events & Automated Execution:**

*   **Event Sources:** Integrate with various data sources to detect triggering events:
    *   Death certificates (via APIs)
    *   Incapacitation declarations (medical records, legal notices)
    *   Extended periods of inactivity (no device usage)
    *   Financial transaction failures (suggesting incapacitation)
*   **Automated Workflow:** Upon detecting a triggering event:
    1.  System initiates access request for Tier 1 recipients.
    2.  Behavioral verification is performed.
    3.  If verified, access is granted.
    4.  If not verified, system escalates to Tier 2 after a delay.
    5.  Process continues until a verified recipient gains access or Tier 3 is reached.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION handleTriggerEvent(event):
  IF event == "death" OR event == "incapacitation" OR event == "inactivity":
    FOR EACH recipient IN recipientList:
      IF recipient.tier == 1:
        IF verifyBehavior(recipient):
          grantAccess(recipient)
          exit
        ELSE:
          logAnomaly(recipient)
      ELSE IF recipient.tier == 2:
        delay(30 days)
        IF verifyBehavior(recipient):
          grantAccess(recipient)
          exit
        ELSE:
          logAnomaly(recipient)
      ELSE: #Tier 3
        delay(365 days)
        grantAccess(recipient)
        exit

FUNCTION verifyBehavior(recipient):
  currentBehavior = analyzeBehavior()
  IF similarity(currentBehavior, recipient.baseline) > threshold:
    return TRUE
  ELSE:
    return FALSE
```

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   **Behavioral Spoofing:** Implement anti-spoofing measures to detect and prevent malicious attempts to mimic valid behavior.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt all sensitive data, including behavioral profiles and shares.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Require multi-factor authentication for all access requests.
*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
