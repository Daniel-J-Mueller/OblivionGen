## Dynamic Browse Tree Personalization via Predicted Journey Mapping

**Concept:** Instead of simply elevating popular categories, proactively predict a user’s likely browsing *journey* within the tree and dynamically restructure the visible portions of the browse tree to reflect that anticipated path. This goes beyond simple category elevation; it’s about pre-emptive organization.

**Specs:**

1.  **Journey Prediction Engine:** 
    *   Input: User profile (demographics, purchase history, explicitly stated preferences), real-time browsing behavior (current session), aggregate behavioral data (similar users, trending items).
    *   Process: Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical browse tree navigation data. The LSTM will predict the *sequence* of categories a user is most likely to visit.  This isn’t just “they liked X, so they’ll go to Y”, it's “based on their pattern of exploring related items, they’ll likely navigate X -> Z -> W.”
    *   Output: A probability-ranked list of category sequences representing predicted browsing journeys.  Each sequence is weighted based on prediction confidence.

2.  **Dynamic Tree Restructuring Module:**
    *   Input: Predicted journey sequences (from Journey Prediction Engine), current browse tree structure, user's current location within the tree.
    *   Process: 
        *   **Node Prioritization:**  Categories within the top-ranked journey sequences receive a “priority score”.
        *   **Visibility Adjustment:**  The visible portion of the browse tree (the categories displayed to the user) is dynamically adjusted.  Categories with higher priority scores are:
            *   **Re-ordered:** Moved closer to the top level of the displayed tree.
            *   **Expanded:** Subcategories are automatically expanded, revealing more options.
            *   **Highlighted:** Visually distinguished from other categories (e.g., different color, bold text).
        *   **Collapsing Irrelevant Branches:** Branches of the browse tree that are consistently predicted as *not* being part of the user’s journey are collapsed by default, reducing cognitive load.
    *   Output: A dynamically restructured, user-personalized browse tree.

3.  **A/B Testing & Reinforcement Learning:**
    *   Implement A/B testing to compare the performance of the dynamic browse tree against a traditional static tree (or the existing popularity-based elevation system). Metrics: conversion rate, time to purchase, average order value, bounce rate.
    *   Integrate a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent observes user interactions with the dynamic tree (e.g., clicks, purchases, time spent on pages) and adjusts the weighting of factors used by the Journey Prediction Engine and the Dynamic Tree Restructuring Module. This allows the system to continuously learn and optimize the personalization process.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Tree Restructuring Module):**

```
function restructureTree(currentTree, predictedJourneys, userLocation):
  priorityScores = {}
  for journey in predictedJourneys:
    for category in journey:
      if category in priorityScores:
        priorityScores[category] += journey.confidenceScore / journey.length
      else:
        priorityScores[category] = journey.confidenceScore / journey.length

  visibleCategories = getVisibleCategories(currentTree, userLocation) 

  for category in visibleCategories:
    category.priority = priorityScores.get(category, 0)

  sortedCategories = sortCategoriesByPriority(visibleCategories)

  expandedCategories = expandTopN(sortedCategories, 3) //Expand top 3 categories

  return sortedCategories, expandedCategories
```

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond simply highlighting popular categories. It actively anticipates user intent and *restructures* the browse tree to guide the user towards their likely desired outcome. The use of LSTMs for journey prediction and reinforcement learning for continuous optimization are key differentiating factors.
