## Adaptive Multi-Speaker Beamforming with Personalized HRTF Compensation

**Concept:** Extend the drift/skew compensation to a multi-speaker environment, not just for timing correction, but for *spatial* audio correction. Leverage the drift/skew analysis to dynamically adjust beamforming weights *and* compensate for individual listener Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) without explicit measurement.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-channel microphone array (minimum 4 channels), networked audio devices (speakers), temperature sensor (optional, for clock drift modeling), individual listener tracking (camera/depth sensor - identifies listener position/orientation). Edge processing capable devices for each speaker.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Drift/Skew Analysis Module:** (Based on patent’s core – analyzes sample rate variations between master device and each speaker.)
    *   **HRTF Profiling Module:**  (Utilizes drift/skew data and listener tracking to *estimate* a personalized HRTF.)
    *   **Beamforming Control Module:** (Dynamically adjusts beamforming weights for each speaker based on estimated HRTF and listener position.)
    *   **Communication Protocol:** (Low-latency, bi-directional communication between master device, speakers, and listener tracking system.)

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Calibration:** System establishes baseline drift/skew for each speaker.
2.  **Listener Tracking:**  Camera/depth sensor tracks listener position and orientation.
3.  **Drift/Skew Monitoring:**  Continuous monitoring of sample rate variations (as in the original patent) for each speaker.
4.  **HRTF Estimation:**
    *   The drift/skew data, specifically the *variation* in drift over time, is correlated with known acoustic characteristics of HRTF spectral notches (specifically, interaural time and level differences).
    *   Assumption:  Slight timing errors introduced by drift/skew manifest as alterations in perceived spatial cues – mimicking the effects of differing head shapes and ear canal geometries.
    *   A machine learning model (trained on a dataset of HRTFs and simulated drift/skew patterns) maps the drift/skew profile to an estimated HRTF for the listener.
5.  **Beamforming Weight Adjustment:**
    *   The estimated HRTF is used to calculate optimal beamforming weights for each speaker.
    *   Beamforming algorithm focuses sound towards the listener's ears, accounting for their individual HRTF characteristics.
6.  **Dynamic Compensation:** System continuously monitors drift/skew and listener position, adapting beamforming weights in real-time. Temperature data (optional) further refines clock drift modeling.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Weight Adjustment):**

```
// Inputs:
//   listener_position: (x, y, z) coordinates
//   listener_orientation: (pitch, yaw) angles
//   estimated_HRTF: HRTF data for the listener
//   speaker_positions: List of (x, y, z) coordinates for each speaker

function adjust_beamforming_weights(listener_position, listener_orientation, estimated_HRTF, speaker_positions) {

  for each speaker in speaker_positions {

    // Calculate distance and angle between listener and speaker
    distance = calculate_distance(listener_position, speaker.position)
    angle = calculate_angle(listener_position, speaker.position, listener_orientation)

    // Calculate ideal sound pressure level (SPL) at listener's ears based on distance
    ideal_SPL = calculate_SPL(distance)

    // Apply HRTF compensation to adjust SPL and phase based on angle and HRTF data
    compensated_SPL = apply_HRTF(angle, compensated_SPL, estimated_HRTF)

    // Calculate beamforming weight based on compensated SPL
    weight = calculate_weight(compensated_SPL)

    // Apply weight to speaker's output
    speaker.set_weight(weight)
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive audio experiences (gaming, VR/AR)
*   Personalized audio in public spaces (museums, concerts)
*   Assistive listening devices for individuals with hearing impairments.
*   Multi-room audio systems with enhanced spatial positioning.
