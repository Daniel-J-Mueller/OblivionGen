## Dynamic Data Partitioning with Drift-Aware Pseudo-Random Number Generators

**Concept:** Extend the consistent filtering concept to proactively manage data drift within training and evaluation sets. Instead of *just* ensuring reproducibility, we’ll use the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state as a control mechanism for dynamically partitioning the dataset based on detected feature drift.

**Specification:**

**1. Drift Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Streaming data, feature vectors.
*   **Process:** Continuously monitor feature distributions using techniques like Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, Population Stability Index (PSI), or Kullback-Leibler divergence.  Calculate drift scores for each feature.
*   **Output:**  Drift scores per feature, aggregated drift score for the entire dataset, and a ‘drift flag’ indicating whether drift exceeds a defined threshold.

**2. PRNG State Modification Logic:**

*   **Input:**  Aggregated drift score, PRNG state (seed or current state), configuration parameters (drift sensitivity, partitioning granularity).
*   **Process:**
    *   If the drift flag is set (drift exceeds threshold):
        *   Calculate a ‘partition offset’ based on the drift score and configuration parameters. This offset determines how the PRNG state is modified.  Higher drift scores lead to larger offsets.
        *   Modify the PRNG state by adding the partition offset. This ensures that subsequent random number generation produces a different data partition.  The offset can be applied to the seed or directly to the internal state of the PRNG.
    *   If no significant drift is detected, the PRNG state remains unchanged.
*   **Output:** Modified PRNG state.

**3. Data Partitioning Layer:**

*   **Input:**  Modified PRNG state, Input Dataset, Partitioning Granularity (e.g., chunk size).
*   **Process:**
    *   Use the modified PRNG state to generate a sequence of random numbers.
    *   Apply these random numbers to the input dataset to create training and evaluation partitions. The granularity parameter controls the size of the partitions.
*   **Output:** Training Set, Evaluation Set.

**4. Consistency Metadata:**

*   Include the *initial* PRNG state (seed) *and* the history of drift scores and PRNG state modifications within the consistency metadata. This allows for perfect reproducibility of data partitions.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
class DynamicDataPartitioner:
    def __init__(self, drift_threshold, partition_granularity, prng_type='mersenne'):
        self.drift_threshold = drift_threshold
        self.partition_granularity = partition_granularity
        self.prng = PRNG(prng_type) # Initialize PRNG
        self.drift_history = []
        self.prng_state_history = []

    def partition_data(self, data, features):
        drift_score = self.detect_drift(data, features)
        self.drift_history.append(drift_score)

        if drift_score > self.drift_threshold:
            partition_offset = calculate_offset(drift_score) #Implementation dependent
            self.prng.seed(self.prng.state + partition_offset)
            self.prng_state_history.append(self.prng.state)

        else:
            self.prng_state_history.append(self.prng.state)

        train_set, eval_set = self.create_partitions(data)
        return train_set, eval_set

    def detect_drift(self, data, features):
        # Implement drift detection logic (e.g., KS test)
        return drift_score

    def create_partitions(self, data):
        # Use PRNG state to generate random indices for partitioning
        # Based on the partition_granularity
        return train_set, eval_set

    def save_consistency_metadata(self):
        # Save initial seed, drift history, and PRNG state history
        metadata = {
            'initial_seed': self.initial_seed,
            'drift_history': self.drift_history,
            'prng_state_history': self.prng_state_history
        }
        return metadata
```

**Innovation:**  This system moves beyond simply ensuring consistent data selection to *adapting* the selection process in response to data drift. This is particularly crucial for continuously evolving datasets where static partitions can quickly become stale.  The inclusion of PRNG state history allows for full auditability and reproducibility of dynamic partitioning decisions.
