## Dynamic Event Payload Enrichment

**Concept:** Extend the server-specified filtering to not just *select* events, but also *enrich* them with contextual data *before* transmission to the client. This moves beyond simple filtering to proactive data preparation, reducing client-side processing and enabling more sophisticated real-time applications.

**Specifications:**

**1. Enrichment Data Sources:**

*   **Internal Data Stores:** The system connects to various internal data sources (databases, caches, APIs) holding contextual data related to events. Examples include user profiles, product catalogs, location data, real-time analytics.
*   **External Data Sources:**  Integration with external APIs and data feeds (weather, traffic, social media) to add even richer context.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:**  Administrators define *enrichment profiles* that specify which data sources to use and how to map event attributes to enrichment data.

**2. Enrichment Rule Definition:**

*   **Server-Side Rule Engine:** A rule engine hosted on the server processes incoming events and applies enrichment rules. Rules are defined using a declarative language (e.g., JSON, YAML) or a visual editor.
*   **Rule Components:**
    *   *Event Attribute Selectors:* Identify attributes in the incoming event.
    *   *Data Source Connectors:* Specify the data source to query.
    *   *Lookup Keys:* Define how to map event attributes to keys for querying the data source.
    *   *Data Transformation:*  Allow data transformation (e.g., formatting, unit conversion) before adding it to the event.
    *   *Conditional Enrichment:*  Apply enrichment only if certain conditions are met.

**3.  Event Processing Pipeline:**

1.  **Event Reception:** The server receives an event from a source (e.g., mutation event).
2.  **Filtering:** The server applies the server-specified filter.
3.  **Enrichment Execution:** For events passing the filter:
    *   The rule engine evaluates the defined enrichment rules.
    *   The rule engine queries the specified data sources using the lookup keys.
    *   The rule engine transforms the retrieved data.
    *   The transformed data is added to the event payload as new attributes.
4.  **Transmission:** The enriched event is transmitted to the client.

**4.  API Extensions:**

*   **Enrichment Profile Management API:** Allows administrators to create, update, and delete enrichment profiles.
*   **Subscription Request API:**  Clients can specify an enrichment profile ID in their subscription request. If no profile is specified, a default profile is used.

**5.  Pseudocode:**

```
// Server-side function for processing subscription events
function processSubscriptionEvent(event, subscription, enrichmentProfileId) {

    // Apply server-specified filter
    if (!filterEvent(event, subscription.filter)) {
        return null; // Event does not match the filter
    }

    // Load enrichment profile
    enrichmentProfile = loadEnrichmentProfile(enrichmentProfileId);

    // Apply enrichment rules
    enrichedEvent = enrichEvent(event, enrichmentProfile);

    return enrichedEvent;
}

function enrichEvent(event, enrichmentProfile) {
    for (rule in enrichmentProfile.rules) {
        dataSource = rule.dataSource;
        lookupKey = rule.lookupKey;
        transformation = rule.transformation;

        data = queryDataSource(dataSource, lookupKey);

        transformedData = applyTransformation(data, transformation);

        event[rule.targetField] = transformedData;
    }

    return event;
}
```

**Example Use Case:**

A real-time stock ticker application. The server can enrich stock price events with company logos, news headlines, and analyst ratings, all fetched from external data sources, reducing the client's load and providing a richer user experience.
