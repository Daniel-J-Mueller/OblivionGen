## Adaptive Resolution Mapping for Foveated VR Rendering

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the resolution of VR image data not based on a fixed foveated region, but on predicted perceptual aliasing artifacts *before* compression, informed by the projection space and expected head/eye movement.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on low-pass filtering based on distance within the projection space. This inspires a move *beyond* static filtering and towards pre-emptive, adaptive resolution scaling to minimize noticeable aliasing *before* encoding, maximizing compression efficiency and perceived visual fidelity.  Current foveated rendering often relies on tracking gaze *during* rendering. This proposes anticipating aliasing *before* it becomes visible.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Projection Space Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: VR content frame (image data representing a view of the virtual environment).  Projection space definition (cube, tetrahedron, cylinder, etc.). Expected head/eye movement prediction (vector or probability distribution).
    *   Process:  
        *   Decompose the VR frame into projection space segments (faces of a cube, sections of a cylinder, etc.).
        *   For each segment, predict the area of the segment projected onto the playback display, *taking into account* predicted head/eye movement.  This uses a transformation matrix based on predicted movement.
        *   Calculate a “compression factor” for each segment: `Compression Factor = Playback Area / Projection Area`. Segments with high compression factors will exhibit greater aliasing.

2.  **Aliasing Prediction Module:**
    *   Input:  Compression Factor for each segment.  Segment geometry data.
    *   Process:
        *   Apply a perceptual aliasing model (e.g., Nyquist frequency analysis, or a learned model trained on aliasing artifacts).
        *   Determine a “minimum acceptable resolution” for each segment to avoid visually significant aliasing, based on the perceptual aliasing model.  This is the resolution needed to prevent artifacts from becoming perceptible.

3.  **Adaptive Resolution Scaling Module:**
    *   Input: Original image data, Minimum Acceptable Resolution for each segment.
    *   Process:
        *   For each segment, downscale the image data (e.g., using a bilinear or bicubic filter) to a resolution that matches the calculated Minimum Acceptable Resolution.  Areas with lower Minimum Acceptable Resolution receive greater downscaling.

4.  **Encoding Module:**
    *   Input: Scaled image data, Projection Space definition.
    *   Process:
        *   Encode the scaled image data using a standard video codec.
        *   Transmit projection space metadata alongside the encoded data to enable correct reconstruction on the client device.

5.  **Client-Side Reconstruction Module:**
    *   Input: Encoded data, Projection Space metadata.
    *   Process:
        *   Decode the encoded data.
        *   Upscale the image data according to the projection space metadata.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic – Aliasing Prediction):**

```
function predict_aliasing(segment_geometry, compression_factor):
  // segment_geometry: Data describing the shape and size of the segment
  // compression_factor: Ratio of projected area to original area

  nyquist_frequency = calculate_nyquist_frequency(segment_geometry)
  required_sampling_rate = nyquist_frequency * 2  // Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem

  //Estimate pixel density in the projection plane
  pixel_density = calculate_pixel_density(segment_geometry)

  //Calculate scaled pixel density
  scaled_pixel_density = pixel_density / compression_factor

  if scaled_pixel_density < required_sampling_rate:
     aliasing_risk = HIGH
     min_resolution = calculate_min_resolution(required_sampling_rate, scaled_pixel_density)
  else:
     aliasing_risk = LOW
     min_resolution = original_resolution

  return min_resolution, aliasing_risk
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Temporal Filtering:** Incorporate temporal filtering to reduce aliasing artifacts that may still occur due to limited frame rates.
*   **Learned Models:** Replace the perceptual aliasing model with a learned model trained on a dataset of aliasing artifacts and human perceptual judgments.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor head/eye movements and dynamically adjust the resolution scaling in real-time.
*   **Luma/Chroma Separation:** Apply different resolution scaling to the luma and chroma components of the image data. Chroma information can often be downscaled more aggressively without noticeable visual impact.
