## Dynamic Feature Synthesis within Query Execution

**Concept:** Extend the data preparation stage within the query engine to *synthesize* new features on-the-fly, based on the specified machine learning modelâ€™s requirements and the characteristics of the input data. This goes beyond simple transformations (scaling, format changes) to creating entirely new data points derived from existing ones, enhancing model accuracy without necessitating pre-processing steps.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Feature Synthesis Engine:** A module integrated within the query engine. It receives the query statement, machine learning model definition, and input data schema.
2.  **Model-Driven Feature Generation:** The engine analyzes the ML model (e.g., using introspection or a provided feature importance map) to identify potentially useful feature combinations or transformations. It prioritizes features that are likely to significantly impact model performance.
3.  **Data Profile Analysis:** The engine profiles the input data (data types, distributions, missing values) to dynamically determine appropriate synthesis techniques.
4.  **Synthesis Operator Library:** A collection of operators for feature synthesis including:
    *   **Polynomial Feature Expansion:** Creating higher-order polynomial features from existing ones (e.g., x1, x2 -> x1^2, x2^2, x1\*x2).
    *   **Ratio/Difference Calculation:** Creating features based on ratios or differences between existing features.
    *   **Conditional Aggregation:** Performing aggregations (sum, average, count) based on conditions applied to existing features.
    *   **Time-Series Feature Extraction:** (If applicable) Extracting features from time-series data (e.g., rolling averages, standard deviations, trends).
    *   **Interaction Term Generation:** Creating features that represent interactions between different features (e.g. multiplying two features together).
5.  **Cost-Based Optimization:**  The query optimizer evaluates the cost of synthesizing different features (CPU, memory, I/O) and selects the most efficient combination for a given query.  The cost model considers both the complexity of the synthesis operations and the potential impact on model accuracy.
6.  **Dynamic Feature Selection:** A mechanism to dynamically select which synthesized features to actually include in the final data set, based on real-time performance metrics (e.g., feature importance scores calculated during model training or prediction).
7.  **Integration with Query Plan:** The feature synthesis operations are incorporated into the query plan as distinct operators, allowing for parallel execution and efficient data flow.

**Pseudocode (Query Plan Snippet):**

```
// Original Query Plan:
SELECT * FROM data_table WHERE condition;
// Apply ML Model

// Modified Query Plan with Feature Synthesis:
SELECT
    *,
    // Synthesized Features
    (feature1 * feature2) AS interaction_term,
    (AVG(feature3) OVER (PARTITION BY category)) AS category_avg
FROM data_table
WHERE condition;
// Apply ML Model
```

**Example Scenario:**

Suppose a fraud detection model requires interaction features between transaction amount and user age.  Instead of pre-calculating these features, the query engine dynamically calculates them during query execution, based on the data retrieved from the transaction table. The synthesis engine analyzes the model and automatically generates the necessary operators and adds them to the query plan.  This reduces data storage requirements and allows for more flexible analysis, as new features can be synthesized on-demand.
