## Adaptive Data Tiering with Predictive Partition Migration

**Concept:** Extend the partitioning and data distribution concept to incorporate a predictive tiering system, proactively migrating partitions *before* resource saturation occurs, based on query patterns and anticipated load. This builds on the existing partition splitting, but adds a layer of intelligent pre-emptive action.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Tiering Manager (PTM). This is a new service operating alongside the existing data storage service.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Query Logs: Real-time access to query patterns (frequency, data accessed, time of day).
    *   Resource Monitoring: Current resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O) of each storage node.
    *   Historical Load Data: Long-term storage of resource utilization and query data.
    *   Metadata: Table schemas, partition sizes, key ranges.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Load Prediction:** Utilize time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or a simple moving average) on historical load data, combined with current query patterns, to predict resource utilization for each storage node over a configurable time horizon (e.g., next 30 minutes, 1 hour).
    2.  **Hot/Cold Partition Identification:** Based on query frequency and access patterns, identify partitions exhibiting “hot” (frequently accessed) and “cold” (infrequently accessed) characteristics.  A sliding window approach should be employed to adapt to changing access patterns.
    3.  **Migration Candidate Selection:** Select partitions for migration based on the following criteria:
        *   Predicted resource saturation on the current node.
        *   Partition access patterns (hot/cold).
        *   Data locality (attempt to minimize data movement).
        *   Node capacity (select a destination node with sufficient available resources).
    4.  **Migration Triggering:**  Initiate partition migration *before* predicted resource saturation occurs, providing a buffer to absorb load spikes. The timing of migration should be configurable.
    5.  **Migration Process:**
        *   Create a replica of the partition on the destination node.
        *   Synchronize data from the source to the destination.
        *   Update routing tables to direct queries to the destination node.
        *   Remove the original partition from the source node.

*   **Pseudocode (PTM Core):**

```
function predict_load(historical_data, current_query_patterns):
  // Time-series forecasting algorithm
  predicted_load = forecast(historical_data, current_query_patterns)
  return predicted_load

function identify_hot_cold_partitions(query_logs):
  hot_partitions = []
  cold_partitions = []
  for partition in partitions:
    access_frequency = calculate_access_frequency(partition, query_logs)
    if access_frequency > threshold:
      hot_partitions.append(partition)
    else:
      cold_partitions.append(partition)
  return hot_partitions, cold_partitions

function select_migration_candidates(predicted_load, hot_partitions, cold_partitions, node_capacities):
  candidates = []
  for partition in hot_partitions:
    source_node = partition.node
    if predicted_load[source_node] > saturation_threshold:
      destination_node = find_best_destination(node_capacities, partition)
      if destination_node:
        candidates.append((partition, destination_node))
  return candidates

function migrate_partition(partition, destination_node):
  // Create replica, synchronize data, update routing tables, remove original
  create_replica(partition, destination_node)
  synchronize_data(partition, destination_node)
  update_routing_tables(partition, destination_node)
  remove_original(partition)

function main():
  historical_data = load_historical_data()
  current_query_patterns = get_current_query_patterns()

  while True:
    predicted_load = predict_load(historical_data, current_query_patterns)
    hot_partitions, cold_partitions = identify_hot_cold_partitions(current_query_patterns)
    migration_candidates = select_migration_candidates(predicted_load, hot_partitions, cold_partitions, node_capacities)

    for candidate in migration_candidates:
      migrate_partition(candidate[0], candidate[1])

    sleep(monitoring_interval)
```

*   **API Extensions:**
    *   `get_partition_stats(partition_id)`: Returns resource utilization and access statistics for a given partition.
    *   `trigger_migration(partition_id, destination_node)`:  Manually trigger migration of a partition. (For testing/administrative purposes).

*   **Deployment Considerations:**
    *   The PTM can be deployed as a separate service or integrated into an existing monitoring/management system.
    *   Monitoring and alerting mechanisms should be implemented to track the performance of the PTM and identify any issues.
