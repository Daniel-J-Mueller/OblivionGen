# D940372

## Adaptive Bioluminescence Step Light

**Concept:** Integrate genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria into the step light housing, creating a self-illuminating, dynamically adjusting light source. The light intensity would respond to foot traffic and ambient light levels, mimicking natural biological rhythms.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing Material:** Translucent, bio-compatible polymer (e.g., a modified PLA) allowing light transmission while supporting bacterial growth. Internal structure designed for optimal nutrient delivery and waste removal.
*   **Bacterial Strain:** *Vibrio fischeri* or similar, genetically engineered for enhanced light output and responsiveness to pressure and light. Gene regulation circuit designed to increase luminescence with pressure (footstep) and decrease with high ambient light.
*   **Nutrient Delivery System:** Microfluidic network within the housing, delivering a liquid nutrient solution to the bacterial colony. Replenishment cycle controlled by a timer/sensor (monthly/bimonthly). Nutrient reservoir integrated into the base of the step light.
*   **Waste Removal:** Porous housing material allowing gas exchange. Periodic flushing of the microfluidic network with fresh nutrient solution to remove metabolic waste.
*   **Pressure Sensor:** Piezoelectric sensor integrated into the step light surface, detecting foot traffic. Signal transmitted to a microcontroller.
*   **Light Sensor:** Ambient light sensor integrated into the housing, providing feedback to the microcontroller.
*   **Microcontroller:**  Arduino Nano or similar.  Algorithm:
    *   If Pressure Sensor > Threshold: Increase bioluminescence intensity by X% for Y seconds.
    *   If Ambient Light Sensor > Threshold: Decrease bioluminescence intensity to Z%.
    *   Implement a natural 'breathing' pattern, subtly modulating light intensity even without foot traffic for aesthetic appeal.
*   **Power Source:** Small solar panel integrated into the top of the housing, providing power for the microcontroller and microfluidic pump. Backup rechargeable battery.
*   **Dimensions:** Maintain a footprint similar to the existing D940372 design. Housing height adjustable to accommodate nutrient reservoir size.
*   **Maintenance:**  Automated system for delivering nutrients, with visual indicator of low levels. Housing designed for easy cleaning and sterilization. Replace bacteria colony every 6-12 months.

**Pseudocode (Microcontroller):**

```
LOOP:
    pressure = readPressureSensor()
    ambientLight = readAmbientLightSensor()

    IF pressure > PRESSURE_THRESHOLD:
        increaseBioluminescence(BIOLUMINESCENCE_INCREASE_AMOUNT, BIOLUMINESCENCE_DURATION)

    IF ambientLight > AMBIENT_LIGHT_THRESHOLD:
        setBioluminescence(MINIMUM_BIOLUMINESCENCE_LEVEL)

    // Breathing Pattern
    currentTime = getCurrentTime()
    breathCycle = currentTime % BREATH_CYCLE_DURATION
    breathIntensity = calculateBreathIntensity(breathCycle)
    setBioluminescence(BASE_BIOLUMINESCENCE_LEVEL + breathIntensity)

    DELAY(100ms)
