## Dynamic Feature Negotiation with Client ‘Profiles’ & Predictive Disablement

**Core Concept:** Expand the selective feature announcement beyond simple incompatibility to *proactive* feature negotiation based on predicted client behavior and resource availability. Instead of just disabling features for known incompatible clients, predictively adjust feature sets *before* association based on learned ‘profiles’.

**Specs:**

**1. Client Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   MAC address.
    *   Probe request data (supported protocols, capabilities).
    *   Association history (past feature usage, signal strength, roaming patterns).
    *   Network load (real-time bandwidth usage, AP congestion).
    *   Time of day / Location (inferred or provided – e.g., if the client is frequently at a known location with limited bandwidth).
*   **Profile Creation:** The module will categorize clients into “Profiles” (e.g., “High-Bandwidth Streamer”, “Low-Power IoT Device”, “Basic Web Browser”, “Frequent Roamer”).  This categorization will be dynamic, shifting as client behavior changes.  Machine learning algorithms (e.g., k-means clustering, Bayesian networks) will be used to automatically create and refine these profiles.
*   **Profile Storage:** Profiles will be stored in a distributed database, accessible by all APs in the mesh network.  Data will be anonymized/pseudonymized to comply with privacy regulations.

**2. Predictive Feature Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:** Client Profile, Network Load, AP Configuration (available features, resource limits).
*   **Algorithm:** Based on the input, the module will predict the client's likely resource usage and the impact on the network. This prediction will incorporate historical data and real-time conditions.
*   **Feature Set Generation:** The module will dynamically generate a “Feature Set” for the client, tailored to its predicted needs and network constraints. This set may include:
    *   Enabling/Disabling specific features (e.g., Fast BSS Transition, MU-MIMO, beamforming).
    *   Adjusting feature parameters (e.g., reducing the frequency of beacon intervals, limiting the number of concurrent connections).
    *   Prioritizing certain types of traffic (e.g., QoS for video streaming).

**3. Enhanced Beacon/Probe Exchange:**

*   **Beacon Modification:** The AP will broadcast beacons containing information about the *available* feature sets, categorized by profile type.
*   **Probe Request Augmentation:** Client probe requests will include a "Profile Identifier" (a hash of the client's MAC address and a few key capabilities), allowing the AP to quickly retrieve the corresponding feature set.
*   **Negotiation:** The AP will respond with a probe response that explicitly lists the features *enabled* for that client, based on the negotiated feature set.

**4.  Resource Management Integration:**

*   The system will integrate with the network's resource management system, allowing the AP to dynamically adjust feature sets based on overall network load and available resources.
*   If the network is congested, the system may temporarily disable certain features for all clients, or reduce the priority of non-critical traffic.

**Pseudocode (AP side):**

```
OnReceiveProbeRequest(probeRequest):
  clientMac = probeRequest.macAddress
  clientProfile = GetClientProfile(clientMac)

  if clientProfile is null:
    // Create a new profile based on the probe request
    clientProfile = CreateClientProfile(probeRequest)

  featureSet = GenerateFeatureSet(clientProfile, networkLoad)

  probeResponse = CreateProbeResponse(featureSet)
  SendProbeResponse(probeResponse)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved network performance and capacity.
*   Optimized user experience (tailored to individual client needs).
*   Reduced interference and congestion.
*   Enhanced scalability and flexibility.
*   Proactive adaptation to changing network conditions.
