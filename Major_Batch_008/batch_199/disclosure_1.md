## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Event Detection

**Concept:** Leverage proximity-based model selection (as outlined in the provided patent) to build a dynamic, real-time acoustic scene reconstruction. Rather than *just* detecting an event, the system creates a layered audio “map” indicating the likely source and intensity of sounds within a defined space. This map then facilitates *predictive* event detection - anticipating what *might* happen based on established acoustic patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 4 microphones, expandable) distributed across a defined space (e.g., room, office).  Each microphone connected to an edge computing device (Raspberry Pi 4 or similar) with sufficient processing power for initial signal processing. Central server for data aggregation and advanced analysis.
*   **Software – Core Modules:**
    *   **Proximity Engine:** (Builds on patent’s premise)  Dynamically assigns acoustic-event-detection models to individual microphones based on detected audio-output device proximity *and* learned spatial relationships.
    *   **Acoustic Source Localization (ASL):**  Utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and beamforming techniques to pinpoint sound sources within the monitored space. Leverages microphone array data.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Builder:**  Aggregates ASL data and event detections to create a layered “acoustic scene map.” This map represents sound source locations, intensities, and event types in a 3D space.  Data is stored in a graph database (Neo4j recommended) for efficient querying and relationship analysis.
    *   **Pattern Learning Module:**  Employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to learn temporal patterns in the acoustic scene map.  The RNN is trained on historical data to predict future events.
    *   **Predictive Event Engine:**  Based on the learned patterns, this module generates probabilistic predictions of future acoustic events.  Includes a confidence score for each prediction.
    *   **Model Calibration:** System incorporates a 'calibration phase', where sounds from known output devices (speakers, printers, phones) are recorded by various input devices (microphones). This data trains the associated models, and associates device signatures with specific locations.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Microphones continuously capture audio.
    2.  Edge computing devices perform initial signal processing (noise reduction, feature extraction).
    3.  Proximity Engine assigns appropriate acoustic-event-detection models to each microphone based on learned proximity data and detected audio-output devices.
    4.  ASL module localizes sound sources.
    5.  Acoustic Scene Builder creates and updates the layered acoustic scene map.
    6.  Pattern Learning Module trains the RNN on historical acoustic scene data.
    7.  Predictive Event Engine generates probabilistic predictions of future events.
    8.  Predictions are outputted via API for integration with other systems (smart home, security systems, etc.).
*   **Pseudocode (Predictive Event Engine):**

```
function predictNextEvent(acousticSceneMap, trainedRNN, timeWindow):
  // timeWindow = duration of past acoustic scene data to consider
  pastSceneData = getSceneDataFrom(acousticSceneMap, currentTime - timeWindow)
  predictedOutput = trainedRNN.predict(pastSceneData)
  nextEvent = decodePredictedOutput(predictedOutput)
  confidenceScore = calculateConfidenceScore(predictedOutput)
  return {event: nextEvent, confidence: confidenceScore}
end function
```

*   **Expansion:** This system could integrate with visual data (cameras) to create a multimodal predictive environment.  It could also incorporate contextual data (calendar events, user location) to improve prediction accuracy.
