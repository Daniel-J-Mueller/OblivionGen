## Dynamic Light Field Projection for Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Leverage the light emitter control described in the patent to project dynamic light fields onto real-world surfaces, creating localized, interactive augmented reality experiences *without* the need for headsets or special glasses.  Instead of simply activating/deactivating emitters, precisely control the intensity and direction of each emitter to sculpt light into 3D shapes and animations visible in the air.

**Specs:**

*   **Emitter Array:** High-density array of micro-LED or laser-based light emitters. Minimum 1000 emitters per square foot. Individual emitter control with at least 16-bit grayscale and positional control (aiming angle -30 to +30 degrees in X and Y).
*   **Depth Mapping:** Integrated depth sensor (ToF or structured light) to create a real-time 3D map of the surrounding environment.  Resolution: 640x480 at 5m range. Accuracy: +/- 2cm.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated onboard processor with GPU capable of real-time light field rendering and emitter control. Minimum: NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX or equivalent.
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   **Light Field Renderer:** Algorithm to convert 3D models or animations into light field data, calculating the intensity and direction for each emitter. Utilize ray tracing and light transport simulation.
    *   **Environmental Calibration:**  Algorithm to map the 3D environment data to the emitter array, correcting for surface angles and reflectivity.
    *   **Gesture Recognition:** Integrate hand/body tracking via camera or additional sensors to allow user interaction with the projected light field.
    *   **API:** Open API for developers to create custom light field applications.
*   **Communication:** Wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2) for software updates and remote control.

**Operation:**

1.  The depth sensor scans the environment, creating a 3D map.
2.  The software renders the desired light field based on the 3D model or animation.
3.  The rendering engine calculates the optimal intensity and direction for each emitter to create the desired visual effect.
4.  The processing unit sends commands to the emitter array, controlling the intensity and direction of each emitter.
5.  The emitter array projects the light field onto the real-world surface, creating a localized, interactive AR experience.

**Pseudocode (Light Field Rendering Engine):**

```
function renderLightField(3DModel, EnvironmentMap):
  lightFieldData = {}
  for each vertex in 3DModel:
    worldPosition = transform(vertex, modelMatrix)
    screenPosition = project(worldPosition, cameraMatrix)

    // Find closest surface point in EnvironmentMap
    closestPoint = findClosestPoint(screenPosition, EnvironmentMap)
    surfaceNormal = getSurfaceNormal(closestPoint)

    // Calculate light direction
    lightDirection = normalize(lightSource - worldPosition)

    // Calculate intensity based on light direction and surface normal
    intensity = dot(lightDirection, surfaceNormal) * lightColor

    // Store emitter data
    emitterID = getEmitterID(screenPosition) // Maps 2D screen position to physical emitter
    lightFieldData[emitterID] = {
      intensity: intensity,
      direction: calculateEmitterDirection(screenPosition, closestPoint)
    }

  return lightFieldData
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Interactive displays on any surface.
*   Holographic projections without special glasses.
*   Localized gaming experiences.
*   Dynamic ambient lighting.
*   Haptic feedback via sculpted light.
