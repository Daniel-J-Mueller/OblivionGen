## Adaptive Segment Stitching for Immersive Experiences

**Concept:** Extend the failover system to not merely *switch* between streams, but to intelligently *stitch* segments from both streams *concurrently* to create a richer, more resilient, and potentially immersive viewing experience. Imagine a live concert where a primary camera feed has a momentary obstruction, and the system seamlessly cuts to a drone shot *within* the same segment timeframe, maintaining the flow without a full-segment switch. This extends to incorporating auxiliary data streams - think 360Â° views, positional audio, or sensor data - alongside the primary video feeds.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Synchronization:**

*   **Multi-Stream Ingestion:** System accepts N video streams (primary, backup(s), auxiliary), alongside synchronized metadata streams (IMU data, positional audio cues, etc.).
*   **Timestamping:** All segments are rigorously timestamped at the source, using a high-resolution clock (NTP synchronized).  Metadata streams *must* be tied to these timestamps.
*   **Segment Buffering:** Each stream has a buffer capable of holding X seconds of encoded segments. 

**2.  Stitching Engine:**

*   **Segment Analysis:** Before buffering, each segment undergoes a quick analysis (basic scene detection, color histogram comparison) to establish similarity scores with adjacent segments *from any source*.
*   **Similarity Matrix:**  A dynamic similarity matrix is maintained, comparing segments across all streams. This matrix drives stitching decisions.
*   **Stitching Points:** Intelligent stitching points are identified *within* segments, not just at segment boundaries. This requires sub-segment (frame-level) analysis.
*   **Seamless Transition Logic:** Implement transition effects (crossfade, wipe, cut) based on similarity scores and metadata cues (e.g., a camera pan might naturally transition to a drone shot).
*    **Priority-based stitching**: Stitching occurs in order of priority, e.g. the primary stream takes precedence unless a fault is detected. Stitching *attempts* to seamlessly blend the feed even if there is no fault.

**3. Playlist Generation & Delivery:**

*   **Dynamic Playlist:** The playlist is constructed *on-the-fly*, incorporating stitched segments.
*   **Segment Metadata:** Playlist entries include not just segment location but also stitching metadata (transition type, blending parameters, source stream ID).
*   **Client-Side Stitching Assistance:** The client receives stitching metadata and may perform minor blending/effects for a smoother experience. (Optional: Client could perform the stitching itself if sufficient processing power is available).
*   **Adaptive Quality Selection**:  The system adapts segment quality based on bandwidth conditions and client capabilities.

**Pseudocode (Playlist Generation):**

```
FUNCTION generate_playlist(request):
    playlist = []
    current_time = request.start_time
    
    WHILE current_time < request.end_time:
        // Find best segment across all streams for current_time
        best_segment = find_best_segment(current_time)

        // If best_segment is from a different stream than the last segment:
        IF best_segment.stream_id != last_segment.stream_id:
            // Calculate transition parameters based on similarity and metadata
            transition = calculate_transition(last_segment, best_segment)

            // Add transition information to playlist entry
            playlist_entry = {
                "segment_location": best_segment.location,
                "stream_id": best_segment.stream_id,
                "transition": transition
            }
        ELSE:
            // Standard segment entry
            playlist_entry = {
                "segment_location": best_segment.location,
                "stream_id": best_segment.stream_id
            }
        
        // Add entry to playlist
        playlist.append(playlist_entry)
        
        // Update current_time
        current_time += best_segment.duration
        
    RETURN playlist
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Driven Stitching:** Use machine learning to predict optimal stitching points and transitions based on content analysis.
*   **Personalized Stitching:** Adapt stitching logic based on user preferences and viewing history.
*   **Interactive Stitching:** Allow viewers to choose between different camera angles or perspectives in real-time.
