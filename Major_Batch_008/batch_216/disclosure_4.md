## Dynamic Key Shard Distribution & Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Expand upon the multi-key cryptographic approach by introducing dynamic key shard distribution, coupled with temporal access control policies enforced at the HSM level. Instead of static key parts, we dynamically generate and distribute key shards to a broader network of trusted entities, increasing resilience and granularity of control.

**Specification:**

**1. Shard Generation & Distribution Service (SGDS):**

   *   **Function:** Responsible for generating, distributing, and revoking key shards. Operates independently of the HSM but interfaces with it for key material establishment.
   *   **Input:**  A master secret (potentially itself sharded & distributed).  Policy definition (access control rules, time windows).  Identity of intended key owner.
   *   **Output:**  Encrypted key shards distributed to designated trust anchors. Revocation lists. Policy updates.

**2. Trust Anchor Network (TAN):**

   *   **Composition:**  A network of trusted entities (e.g., geographically diverse data centers, key custodians, designated personnel).
   *   **Role:**  Securely store and manage assigned key shards. Respond to shard requests from the HSM. Enforce revocation policies.

**3. HSM Adaptations:**

   *   **Shard Request Module:**  Initiates requests for key shards from the TAN.  Supports secure communication protocols (TLS, authenticated encryption).
   *   **Shard Assembly Engine:**  Receives key shards, verifies their authenticity (digital signatures, MACs), and assembles the complete key.
   *   **Temporal Policy Enforcer:** Checks if the current time falls within the authorized access window defined by the policy.  Refuses to perform cryptographic operations if the policy is violated.
   *   **Dynamic Key Rotation:** Facilitates automated key rotation based on predefined schedules or triggered events (e.g., suspected compromise).  Leverages the shard distribution system to seamlessly transition to new key material.
   *   **Quorum-Based Key Reconstruction:** Implement a threshold cryptography scheme. A minimum number of shards must be provided for key reconstruction before cryptographic operations proceed. This enhances security by requiring collaboration among trust anchors.

**4. Policy Definition (JSON Format Example):**

```json
{
  "key_id": "unique_key_identifier",
  "access_control": [
    {
      "entity": "user1@example.com",
      "permissions": ["decrypt", "encrypt"],
      "start_time": "2024-10-27T00:00:00Z",
      "end_time": "2024-10-28T00:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "entity": "service_x",
      "permissions": ["sign"],
      "start_time": "2024-10-27T12:00:00Z",
      "end_time": "2025-10-27T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "quorum_threshold": 3,
  "total_shards": 5
}
```

**Pseudocode (HSM Core Logic):**

```
function perform_cryptographic_operation(data, operation_type):
    policy = get_policy(key_id)
    if not is_authorized(policy, current_time):
        log_denial("Access denied due to temporal policy")
        return ERROR

    shards = request_shards(policy.total_shards)
    if len(shards) < policy.quorum_threshold:
        log_denial("Insufficient shards received")
        return ERROR

    key = reconstruct_key(shards)

    result = perform_operation(key, data, operation_type)

    return result
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   **Secure Communication:**  Establish secure channels between the HSM, SGDS, and TAN using robust encryption protocols.
*   **Scalability:**  Design the system to handle a large number of keys, shards, and trust anchors.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
*   **Auditing:**  Maintain comprehensive audit logs of all key access and cryptographic operations.
*   **Key Derivation:** Explore using deterministic key derivation functions (KDFs) to generate shards from a master secret, minimizing storage requirements.
