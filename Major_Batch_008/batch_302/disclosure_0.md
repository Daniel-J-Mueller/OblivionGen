## Adaptive Interrupt Granularity Based on System Load

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust interrupt handling granularity – from coalesced/moderated to individual, immediate interrupts – based on real-time system load metrics. This aims to strike a balance between minimizing latency for critical events and reducing overhead during periods of low activity.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Load Monitoring Module:**

*   **Input:** CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic (bandwidth and packet rate).
*   **Processing:**  Implement a weighted average algorithm to calculate a 'System Load Score'. Weights should be configurable to prioritize certain metrics (e.g., higher weight on CPU for compute-intensive tasks, higher weight on network for network-bound tasks).  Apply hysteresis to prevent rapid switching between interrupt modes.
*   **Output:**  System Load Score (numerical value, range 0-100).  Interrupt Mode Recommendation (Individual, Coalesced, Moderated).

**2. Interrupt Handling Manager:**

*   **Input:** System Load Score, Interrupt Mode Recommendation, Incoming Interrupt Requests.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Individual Mode (Low Load – Score < 30):** Process each interrupt request immediately without any coalescing or moderation.
    *   **Coalesced Mode (Medium Load – Score 30-70):** Implement a timer-based coalescing mechanism.  Collect interrupt requests for a configurable time window (e.g., 1-10ms).  Generate a single, consolidated interrupt request at the end of the window.
    *   **Moderated Mode (High Load – Score > 70):**  Utilize a moderation queue.  Incoming interrupt requests are added to the queue. A dedicated moderation thread processes requests from the queue at a controlled rate, preventing overload.  The rate should be dynamically adjusted based on the System Load Score.
*   **Output:** Processed interrupt requests to the appropriate device driver or handler.

**3. Configuration & Tuning:**

*   **Configurable Parameters:**
    *   System Load Score thresholds for each interrupt mode (Individual, Coalesced, Moderated).
    *   Coalescing time window duration.
    *   Moderation queue size.
    *   Moderation rate adjustment algorithm (e.g., proportional control).
    *   Weights for individual system load metrics.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Implement an adaptive learning algorithm (e.g., reinforcement learning) to fine-tune configuration parameters based on system performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput, CPU utilization).

**Pseudocode (Interrupt Handling Manager):**

```
function HandleInterrupt(interruptRequest):
    systemLoadScore = GetSystemLoadScore()

    if systemLoadScore < 30:  // Individual Mode
        ProcessInterruptImmediately(interruptRequest)
    else if systemLoadScore < 70:  // Coalesced Mode
        AddInterruptToCoalescingBuffer(interruptRequest)
        if CoalescingBufferFullOrTimeout():
            ProcessCoalescedInterrupts()
    else:  // Moderated Mode
        AddInterruptToModerationQueue(interruptRequest)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Interrupt controller capable of supporting dynamic interrupt prioritization and moderation.
*   Sufficient memory bandwidth to handle coalesced interrupt requests.
*   Dedicated hardware acceleration for moderation queue management (optional).
