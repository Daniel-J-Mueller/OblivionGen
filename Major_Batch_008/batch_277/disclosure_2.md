## Adaptive Network Topology Reconstruction via Distributed Packet Shadowing

**Concept:** Leverage the existing TCP connection state monitoring to *reconstruct* a real-time, dynamic map of the network topology, identifying not just connectivity, but *effective* path quality based on observed packet behavior. This goes beyond simple traceroute-style mapping by building a probabilistic model of path performance informed by live traffic.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** ‘Shadow Packet Injector’ (SPI) – A lightweight module deployed alongside existing monitors (claims 1, 4, 13).
*   **Function:** SPI periodically injects small, uniquely identifiable ‘shadow packets’ alongside regular user traffic, mimicking the source/destination of existing connections. These are not *intended* to reach their destination – they are probes.
*   **Data Collection:** SPI monitors the return path of shadow packets. The key metric isn't *arrival*, but *where* they're observed. We're looking for 'echoes' – packets bouncing back from intermediate nodes.
*   **Topology Mapping Algorithm:**
    *   Maintain a probabilistic graph representing the network topology. Nodes are network devices (routers, switches, firewalls – identified via claim 7). Edges represent possible paths.
    *   Each edge has a ‘confidence score’ based on the frequency and quality of observed shadow packet echoes along that path.
    *   Algorithm pseudocode:

        ```
        function update_topology(shadow_packet_echo):
          source = shadow_packet_echo.source
          hop = shadow_packet_echo.hop //The node that echoed the packet
          if not node_exists(hop):
            add_node(hop)
          if not edge_exists(source, hop):
            add_edge(source, hop, confidence=0.1)
          increase_edge_confidence(source, hop, 0.05)
          //Apply decay to all edge confidences to prevent stale data
          decay_all_edge_confidences(0.01)
        ```
*   **Integration with Health Manager (claims 4, 10):**
    *   Health Manager receives the reconstructed topology map.
    *   Analysis includes identifying congested paths (low confidence scores, high echo latency), potential bottlenecks, and failing devices.
    *   Topology data is presented via API (claim 10) – allows visualization and integration with network management tools.
*   **Adaptive Monitoring (claims 11, 12):**
    *   SPI activation is dynamic. It's selectively enabled for specific customers or network segments based on observed performance issues.
    *   SPI injection rate is adaptive – increases during peak hours or when anomalies are detected.
*   **Remediation Integration (claim 9):**
    *   Automated remediation actions based on topology analysis – rerouting traffic around congested paths, scaling resources at bottleneck devices.
* **Packet Shadowing Techniques:**
    *   **TTL manipulation**: Use different TTL values to probe various network hops
    *   **Fragmented Packets**: Send fragmented packets and monitor which fragments return from which hops
    *   **Destination Address Modification**: Modify the destination IP address to force specific routing paths

This system moves beyond reactive health monitoring (detecting problems after they occur) to *proactive* network topology reconstruction and predictive problem identification. It’s a dynamic, self-learning map of the network, informed by real traffic and capable of guiding automated remediation actions.
