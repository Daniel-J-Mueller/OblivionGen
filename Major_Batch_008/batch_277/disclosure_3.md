## Dynamic Prosody Shaping via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial muscle activity) from the user into the TTS engine's prosody generation. The goal is to dynamically shape the synthesized speech to more closely mirror the user’s emotional and physiological state, creating a more engaging and natural listening experience.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor Suite:** Non-invasive sensors for:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – ECG or PPG-based.
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) / Skin Conductance.
    *   Facial Electromyography (fEMG) - Detects subtle muscle movements associated with emotion (e.g., zygomaticus major for smiling, corrugator supercilii for frowning).
*   **Wireless Communication Module:** Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for transmitting biofeedback data to the TTS processing unit.
*   **Headset/Wearable Integration:** Sensors integrated into a comfortable headset or wearable device.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Data Acquisition & Processing Module:**
    *   Real-time acquisition of raw sensor data.
    *   Noise filtering and artifact removal.
    *   Feature extraction (e.g., HRV metrics – RMSSD, SDNN; EDA peak amplitude/frequency; fEMG amplitude/frequency).
    *   Normalization and scaling of features.
*   **Prosody Mapping Engine:**
    *   A machine learning model (e.g., neural network) trained to map biofeedback features to prosodic parameters.
    *   **Prosodic Parameters:**
        *   **Speech Rate:** Words per minute.
        *   **Pitch Range:** Maximum and minimum fundamental frequency.
        *   **Pitch Variation:** Standard deviation of fundamental frequency.
        *   **Intensity:** Loudness of speech.
        *   **Pauses:** Duration and frequency of pauses.
    *   **Mapping Strategies:**
        *   **Direct Mapping:** Biofeedback features directly control prosodic parameters.
        *   **Emotional State Inference:** Biofeedback features used to infer emotional state (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, anxiety) and adjust prosody accordingly.  A pre-trained emotion recognition model is needed.
        *   **Personalized Prosody:** The mapping model is personalized to the user based on their baseline biofeedback data and preferred prosodic styles.
*   **TTS Integration Module:**
    *   Interface with existing TTS engine.
    *   Modifies prosodic parameters before speech synthesis.
    *   Supports dynamic adjustment of prosody during playback.
*   **Calibration Routine:**
    *   A guided process for establishing baseline biofeedback data for each user.
    *   Includes exercises designed to elicit specific emotional states (e.g., recalling happy memories, visualizing stressful situations).
    *   Generates a personalized prosody profile for each user.

**III. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Acquire Biofeedback Data
  bioData = getBiofeedbackData();

  // 2. Process Biofeedback Data
  features = processBiofeedbackData(bioData);

  // 3. Determine Prosodic Adjustments
  prosodicAdjustments = mapFeaturesToProsody(features, userProfile);

  // 4. Modify TTS Parameters
  ttsEngine.setProsody(prosodicAdjustments);

  // 5. Synthesize/Continue Speech
  ttsEngine.synthesize(inputText);
}
```

**IV.  Novel Aspects:**

*   **Real-time, dynamic prosody shaping** – unlike existing TTS systems, which typically use static or pre-defined prosodic patterns.
*   **Integration of multiple biofeedback modalities** – providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the user’s emotional and physiological state.
*   **Personalized prosody profiles** – adapting to the user’s individual preferences and baseline biofeedback data.
*   **Potential applications:** immersive storytelling, therapeutic interventions (e.g., anxiety reduction, speech therapy), assistive communication for individuals with emotional or cognitive impairments.
