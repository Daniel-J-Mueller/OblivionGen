## Dynamic Column Reflow with Semantic Awareness

**Specification:** A system for intelligent, dynamic reflow of text within zoomed-in columns of image-based documents, extending beyond simple line-breaking to preserve semantic meaning and visual hierarchy.

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely reflowing text based on word boundaries and available column width, the system analyzes the *content* of each line to determine optimal reflow points that minimize disruption of phrases, clauses, and visual groupings (e.g., bulleted lists, code blocks, tables).

**System Components:**

1.  **Semantic Analyzer:** 
    *   Input: Line of text within a column.
    *   Process: Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition) to identify key semantic units (phrases, clauses, lists, etc.). Assigns a 'semantic cohesion score' to potential reflow points based on the disruption to these units. 
    *   Output: List of potential reflow points, each with a semantic cohesion score.

2.  **Visual Hierarchy Detector:**
    *   Input: Line of text + surrounding context (if available).
    *   Process: Detects visual cues indicating hierarchical relationships (indentation, bullet points, numbering, different font sizes/styles). Assigns a ‘visual importance score’ to each segment of text. 
    *   Output: Visual importance score for each segment of text.

3.  **Reflow Engine:**
    *   Input: Line of text, semantic cohesion scores, visual importance scores, target column width.
    *   Process: Selects the optimal reflow point by maximizing a combined score based on:
        *   Semantic cohesion (higher is better)
        *   Visual importance (preserve visual grouping)
        *   Line length (minimize excessive whitespace).
    *   Output: Reflowed line of text.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function reflowLine(line, columnWidth):
  semanticScores = analyzeSemanticCohesion(line)
  visualScores = analyzeVisualHierarchy(line)
  bestReflowPoint = 0
  bestScore = -Infinity

  for i in range(1, len(line)):
    segment1 = line[:i]
    segment2 = line[i:]

    semanticScore = semanticScores[i]
    visualScore = visualScores[i]

    score = semanticScore + visualScore - abs(len(segment1) - columnWidth/2) // *Penalty for deviation from ideal length*

    if score > bestScore:
      bestScore = score
      bestReflowPoint = i

  return line[:bestReflowPoint] + "\n" + line[bestReflowPoint:]
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Language Support:** Initially support English, expanding to other languages with NLP resources.
*   **Integration:** Integrate with existing column zoom functionality.
*   **User Control:** Allow users to adjust weighting between semantic cohesion and visual importance to customize the reflow behavior.
*   **Advanced Features:** Explore the use of machine learning to learn user preferences for reflow behavior. Potentially use generative AI to re-write/shorten sentences to fit better.
