## Dynamic Spreadsheet "Lens" System

**Concept:** Extend the personalized spreadsheet filtering described in the patent to enable users to define and share custom "Lenses" - reusable configurations of filters, calculations, and visualizations applied to a base spreadsheet. These Lenses would act as a dynamic, user-defined view, without modifying the underlying data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Lens Definition Interface:**

*   **Visual Builder:** A drag-and-drop interface allowing users to chain together filtering, calculation, and visualization components.
*   **Component Library:**
    *   **Filters:**  Standard filtering (e.g., "Show rows where Status = 'In Progress'"), but also advanced filters based on regular expressions, date ranges, or custom scripts (e.g., Python snippets).
    *   **Calculations:**  Creation of new columns based on formulas, including statistical functions, financial calculations, or custom scripts.
    *   **Visualizations:**  Integration of basic charting types (bar, line, pie) with the ability to customize colors, labels, and axes.  Support for conditional formatting to highlight specific data points.
    *   **Data Connectors:** Ability to pull in external data (e.g. from APIs, other spreadsheets) to enrich the view.
*   **Parameterization:**  Allow users to define input parameters for the Lens.  For example, a Lens displaying sales data could have a parameter for "Region" or "Date Range."
*   **Lens Metadata:**  Fields for Lens name, description, creator, and tags.

**2. Lens Sharing & Collaboration:**

*   **Lens Library:** A centralized repository for storing and sharing Lenses within an organization or community.
*   **Permission Control:**  Granular permissions to control who can view, edit, or use a Lens.
*   **Lens Versioning:**  Track changes to a Lens over time and revert to previous versions.
*   **Lens Marketplace:**  Potential for a public marketplace where users can share and sell their custom Lenses.
*   **Collaboration features:** Allow multiple users to concurrently edit and test a Lens.

**3.  Runtime Engine & Data Handling:**

*   **Virtual Data Layer:** When a user applies a Lens to a spreadsheet, the system creates a virtual data layer. This layer applies the filters, calculations, and visualizations defined in the Lens to the base spreadsheet data *without* modifying the original data.
*   **Incremental Updates:**  The system should efficiently update the virtual data layer when the base spreadsheet data changes.  Only the affected rows or columns need to be recalculated.
*   **Data Caching:**  Cache the results of calculations and visualizations to improve performance.
*   **Data Source Flexibility:**  Support for multiple data sources beyond standard spreadsheets, including databases, APIs, and cloud storage.

**4.  Lens Application Interface:**

*   **"Apply Lens" Button:** A button within the spreadsheet editor that allows users to select and apply a Lens to the current spreadsheet.
*   **Parameter Input:**  If the selected Lens has input parameters, the system should prompt the user to enter values for those parameters.
*   **Dynamic View:**  The spreadsheet editor should display the filtered, calculated, and visualized data from the virtual data layer.
*   **"Lens Settings" Panel:** A panel that allows users to adjust the parameters of the applied Lens and view its metadata.

**Pseudocode (Lens Application):**

```
function applyLens(spreadsheet, lens, parameters) {
  virtualData = spreadsheet.clone() // Create a copy of the spreadsheet
  filters = lens.getFilters()
  for (filter in filters) {
    virtualData = virtualData.applyFilter(filter)
  }
  calculations = lens.getCalculations()
  for (calculation in calculations) {
    virtualData = virtualData.addCalculatedColumn(calculation, parameters)
  }
  visualization = lens.getVisualization()
  displayData = virtualData.applyVisualization(visualization)
  renderData(displayData)
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Powered Lens Creation:** Use machine learning to suggest Lenses based on the data in the spreadsheet and the user's goals.
*   **Real-Time Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to view and interact with the same Lens simultaneously.
*   **Integration with Business Intelligence Tools:** Export the results of a Lens to BI platforms for further analysis.
