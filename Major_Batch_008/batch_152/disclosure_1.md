## Autonomous Device Swarm Coordination via Projected AR Guidance

**Concept:** Expand beyond single device control to a system where multiple autonomously motile devices operate in concert, guided by augmented reality projections visible *to the user* and interpreted by the devices. This allows for complex tasks requiring coordinated movement and manipulation.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Motile Device (xN):** Each device maintains core functionality as described in the base patent (camera, processor, locomotion). Add:
    *   **IR Emitter Array:**  Low-power infrared LEDs arranged in a pattern for AR projection recognition.
    *   **Short-Range UWB Radio:** For precise inter-device communication and localization.
*   **User Device:** Existing functionality. Add:
    *   **Depth Sensor:** (e.g., Time-of-Flight)  Captures a 3D representation of the environment.
    *   **High-Resolution Projector:** Projects AR guidance onto surfaces within the environment.  Capable of projecting visible light patterns.
*   **Base Station (Optional):**  For initial environment mapping and device calibration (can be user device).

**II. Software Architecture:**

*   **Environmental Mapping Module:** Utilizes depth sensor data to create a real-time 3D map of the operating environment.  Map data is shared between all devices.
*   **AR Guidance Projection Module (User Device):**
    *   Accepts high-level task commands from the user (e.g., "clear the table," "inspect the perimeter").
    *   Translates task commands into a series of projected AR waypoints and guidance cues (lines, arrows, zones). These projections are *not* interpreted as commands by the devices directly – they serve as visual guides.
    *   Tracks user gaze/pointing to indicate target objects/areas.
*   **Device Perception & Path Planning Module:**
    *   Each device utilizes its camera and onboard processing to identify the AR projections within its field of view.
    *   Devices *interpret the position and orientation of the AR projections* as guidance cues.  The closer a device is to a projection, the stronger the ‘pull’ towards that position.
    *   Utilizes UWB data from other devices to maintain relative positioning and avoid collisions.
    *   Path planning is reactive – devices dynamically adjust their paths based on the positions of AR projections and other devices.
*   **Swarm Coordination Algorithm:**  (Pseudocode)

```
    For Each Device:
        While Task Not Complete:
            Sense AR Projections within Field of View
            Calculate Attraction Vector to Nearest Projection
            Sense Other Devices (UWB)
            Calculate Repulsion Vector from Other Devices
            Combine Attraction & Repulsion Vectors to Determine Movement Direction
            Adjust Speed Based on Distance to Projection & Obstacles
            Execute Movement
            Update Position in Environmental Map
```

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  User initiates a task via the user device.
2.  The AR Guidance Projection Module projects waypoints and guidance cues onto the environment.
3.  Each motile device perceives the AR projections within its field of view and utilizes them as guidance cues.
4.  Devices coordinate with each other to avoid collisions and efficiently complete the task.
5.  The user monitors progress via the user device’s camera feed.

**IV. Potential Applications:**

*   **Automated Cleaning/Maintenance:**  Devices could work together to clean large areas or perform complex maintenance tasks.
*   **Search and Rescue:**  Devices could explore hazardous environments and locate victims.
*   **Collaborative Manipulation:**  Devices could work together to manipulate large or heavy objects.
*   **Interactive Installations:** Create dynamic, responsive environments that react to user interaction.
