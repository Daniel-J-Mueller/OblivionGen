## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Echo Cancellation

**Concept:** Leverage visual data not just for *detecting* speech, but for reconstructing the acoustic environment and *predictively* adjusting echo cancellation. This goes beyond simply identifying a speaker; it aims to model the room’s acoustic properties in real-time based on observed changes.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution RGB-D camera (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect). Provides both color and depth information.
    *   Multi-microphone array (existing in current system – utilized for beamforming and initial AEC).
    *   Dedicated processing unit (GPU or specialized AI accelerator) for real-time scene understanding and prediction.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Scene Understanding Module:**  Processes RGB-D data to create a 3D reconstruction of the environment. Identifies surfaces, objects (furniture, walls, windows), and their material properties (estimated from visual texture and depth).  Uses a pre-trained semantic segmentation model fine-tuned for common indoor environments.
    *   **Acoustic Material Estimation:**  Assigns acoustic properties (absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient) to identified surfaces. This is a lookup table based on visual material identification, supplemented by a machine learning model trained on a dataset of material characteristics. (e.g., drywall = high reflection, carpet = high absorption).  Uncertainty quantification is critical here.
    *   **Ray Tracing/Acoustic Simulation:**  Employs a simplified ray tracing algorithm or a fast acoustic simulation engine (e.g., using the Image Source Method) to predict sound propagation paths within the reconstructed environment. This creates a dynamic “acoustic map” of the room.
    *   **Predictive Echo Cancellation:**
        *   **Echo Path Prediction:**  Based on the acoustic map and detected speaker position, predict the dominant echo paths. This is a dynamic model that adapts to changes in the environment (e.g., a door opening, someone moving).
        *   **Filter Adaptation:**  Proactively adjust the adaptive filter of the acoustic echo canceller *before* the echo arrives, based on the predicted echo path. This minimizes latency and improves cancellation accuracy.
        *   **Confidence Scoring:** Maintain a confidence score for the predicted echo path. If the score is low (e.g., due to uncertainty in the scene reconstruction), fall back to traditional AEC methods.
*   **Pseudocode (Predictive Filter Adaptation):**

```pseudocode
// Input: Camera data, Microphone array data, Current AEC filter state
// Output: Updated AEC filter state

function PredictiveAEC(cameraData, micData, currentFilter):
  scene = SceneUnderstanding(cameraData)
  acousticMap = CreateAcousticMap(scene)
  predictedEchoPaths = PredictEchoPaths(acousticMap, speakerPosition)
  
  confidence = CalculateConfidence(predictedEchoPaths)
  
  if confidence > threshold:
    predictedFilter = GenerateFilterFromPaths(predictedEchoPaths)
    newFilter = BlendFilters(currentFilter, predictedFilter, blendingFactor) //Blending factor dynamically adjusted
  else:
    newFilter = StandardAECAdaptation(micData, currentFilter)
    
  return newFilter
```

*   **Dynamic Calibration Routine:**  If significant changes are detected in the scene (e.g., furniture rearrangement), trigger a short calibration sequence where the system plays test tones and measures the resulting acoustic response to refine the acoustic map.

*   **Data Storage:**  Store learned acoustic properties of common objects and materials in a database for faster scene understanding in future sessions.

This approach aims to move beyond reactive echo cancellation to *proactive* echo cancellation, anticipating and mitigating echoes before they become a problem. It also allows the system to adapt to dynamic environments more effectively.
