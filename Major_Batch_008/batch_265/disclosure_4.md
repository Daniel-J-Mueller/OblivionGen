## Dynamic Spatial Audio Mapping with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Expand the visual audio indicator to incorporate spatial audio simulation *and* haptic feedback, creating a fully immersive experience. This isn’t simply visualizing volume, but recreating the *direction* and perceived *distance* of sound sources in a 3D space.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of micro-haptic actuators embedded in a wearable device (wristband, glove, or headband). Resolution: minimum 20 actuators.
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4 mics) integrated into the user device to capture spatial audio cues.
    *   High-fidelity audio output capable of simulating binaural sound.
*   **Software – Spatial Audio Processing Module:**
    1.  **Input:** Raw audio data from the microphone array.
    2.  **Processing:**
        *   Beamforming: Analyze the microphone array input to determine the direction of arrival (DOA) of sound sources.
        *   Distance Estimation: Employ time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) or other techniques to estimate the distance to the sound source.  Utilize camera data (if available) to refine distance estimation via object recognition and depth perception.
        *   Sound Source Classification: AI model to classify sound types (speech, music, environmental sounds).
    3.  **Output:** 3D sound source coordinates (X, Y, Z) and sound classification.
*   **Software – Haptic Feedback Module:**
    1.  **Input:** 3D sound source coordinates, sound classification, and volume data from the Spatial Audio Processing Module.
    2.  **Mapping:**
        *   Directional Mapping: Map sound source direction to actuator activation on the wearable device. Actuators closer to the perceived sound direction are activated with higher intensity.
        *   Distance Mapping: Map sound source distance to actuator intensity. Closer sounds trigger stronger actuator vibrations.
        *   Sound Classification Mapping: Different sound types trigger different vibration patterns (e.g., speech = subtle pulsing, music = rhythmic vibrations, emergency alerts = strong, attention-grabbing vibrations).
    3.  **Actuator Control:** Send commands to the haptic actuators to create the desired vibration patterns.
*   **Software – Visual Indicator Integration:**
    1.  Integrate the 3D sound source coordinates into the existing visual audio indicator system.
    2.  Display a spatial representation of the sound source(s) on the screen.
    3.  The visual indicator’s width corresponds to the volume, but its position on the screen reflects the perceived spatial location.
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Module):**

```
function generate_haptic_feedback(sound_source_coordinates, sound_classification, volume):
  direction_x, direction_y, distance = sound_source_coordinates
  
  # Normalize direction and distance for actuator mapping
  normalized_direction_x = map(direction_x, -1, 1, 0, 1) # Assuming -1 to 1 range
  normalized_distance = map(distance, 0, 10, 0, 1) # Example range
  
  # Determine vibration intensity
  intensity = volume * normalized_distance
  
  # Select vibration pattern based on sound classification
  if sound_classification == "speech":
    pattern = "subtle_pulse"
  elif sound_classification == "music":
    pattern = "rhythmic_vibration"
  else:
    pattern = "default_vibration"
  
  # Activate actuators based on direction and intensity
  for actuator_index in range(num_actuators):
    actuator_position = calculate_actuator_position(actuator_index)
    distance_to_actuator = calculate_distance(actuator_position, normalized_direction_x, normalized_direction_y)

    if distance_to_actuator < threshold:
      set_actuator_vibration(actuator_index, intensity, pattern)
```

**Innovation:**  This goes beyond visualizing sound; it *simulates* sound, engaging multiple senses. This could be transformative for accessibility (helping individuals with hearing impairments experience sound), immersive gaming/VR, and telepresence applications.  The combination of spatial audio, haptic feedback, and a visual indicator creates a holistic and deeply engaging sensory experience.
