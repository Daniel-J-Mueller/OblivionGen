## Dynamic Deployment Canaries with Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the automated rollback functionality by introducing *predictive* rollback based on simulated deployment outcomes. Rather than solely reacting to observed metric breaches, proactively assess deployment risk *before* full rollout.

**Specifications:**

**1. Simulation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Deployment configuration (policies, resource allocation), historical performance data (metrics, logs), simulated user load profiles (based on production patterns), a model of the application's dependencies (APIs, databases), and the *proposed* changes (new revision).
*   **Process:**
    *   Create a sandboxed environment mirroring production.
    *   Run multiple simulations with varying load and edge case scenarios.
    *   Use the application dependency model to anticipate potential bottlenecks and failure points.
    *   Employ machine learning to *predict* metric values (latency, error rates, resource utilization) based on simulation outcomes. The ML model should be continuously trained on production data.
*   **Output:** A "risk score" for the deployment, along with predicted metric ranges and identified potential failure points.

**2. Canary Tiering & Adaptive Rollout:**

*   Introduce tiered canary deployments.  Instead of a simple "on/off" rollout, the system will manage multiple canary tiers, each receiving a progressively larger percentage of traffic.
*   The initial canary tier receives a very small percentage of traffic (e.g., 0.1%).
*   The system continuously monitors metrics *and* compares them to the predicted ranges from the simulation engine.
*   **Adaptive Rollout Logic:**
    *   **Green Path:** If observed metrics are within predicted ranges, *and* the risk score remains low, the system automatically increases the traffic to the next canary tier.
    *   **Yellow Path (Warning):** If observed metrics start to deviate from predictions, but remain within acceptable limits, the system pauses the rollout, logs a warning, and increases monitoring frequency.
    *   **Red Path (Critical):** If observed metrics breach acceptable limits, the system *immediately* initiates rollback to the previous stable revision.

**3. Rollback Enhancements:**

*   **Granular Rollback:** Allow rollback to specific *parts* of the deployment, rather than the entire system.  For example, if a change in a specific microservice is causing issues, only that service can be rolled back.
*   **Rollback with Mitigation:** If the rollback process detects an issue (e.g., database corruption), automatically trigger mitigation steps (e.g., database restore from backup).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Rollout Logic):**

```
function adaptiveRollout(observedMetrics, predictedMetrics, riskScore):
  if riskScore > threshold_high:
    rollback()
    return

  if observedMetrics deviate significantly from predictedMetrics:
    logWarning("Metric Deviation Detected")
    increaseMonitoringFrequency()
    return

  if observedMetrics are within acceptable range AND riskScore is low:
    increaseTrafficToNextCanaryTier()

  return
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DeploymentConfiguration`:  Contains information about the deployment, including policies, resource allocation, and application dependencies.
*   `SimulationResult`: Contains the results of a simulation, including predicted metric values and identified failure points.
*   `CanaryTier`: Represents a tier of the canary deployment, including the percentage of traffic it receives and the current status of the deployment.
