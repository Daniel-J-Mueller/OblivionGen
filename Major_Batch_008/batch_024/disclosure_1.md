**Dynamic Spectrum Allocation via Wavelength Shifting & Multi-Fiber Switching**

**Concept:** Extend the 'logical cut' functionality beyond simply appearing disconnected. Instead, leverage wavelength shifting and a dynamically configurable multi-fiber network to actively *re-route* optical signals around degraded fiber segments *and* optimize spectrum usage.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-Fiber Optical Switch (MFOS):  An optical switch capable of routing signals across *multiple* fiber pathways, not just two redundant paths. Minimum 8 input/output ports, scalable to 32+.
    *   Wavelength Conversion Modules (WCM): Integrated modules at each MFOS port, capable of shifting optical signals across a defined spectrum (e.g., C-band, L-band).  Granularity: 50 GHz channels.  Low latency (<1ms shift time).
    *   Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA): Real-time monitoring of wavelengths on each fiber input/output, providing power level and channel occupancy data.
    *   High-Speed Control Unit (HSCU):  FPGA-based processor responsible for real-time analysis of OSA data, decision-making, and control of MFOS and WCM.
    *   Fiber Monitoring System: Power taps & photodiodes on *all* fiber segments, feeding data into the HSCU.
    *   Variable Optical Attenuators (VOA): Integrated with each MFOS port, for precise power level control.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Algorithm (DSAA): Core algorithm executed on the HSCU.  Operates as follows:
        1.  **Fiber Health Monitoring:** Continuously monitor power levels on all fiber segments.  Identify degraded segments (power below threshold, high error rate).
        2.  **Spectrum Mapping:** Create a real-time map of wavelength occupancy on each fiber.
        3.  **Route Calculation:** When a degraded segment is detected, the algorithm calculates alternative routes through the MFOS, considering:
            *   Fiber health
            *   Wavelength availability (avoiding collisions)
            *   Latency (minimize signal delay)
            *   Load balancing (distribute traffic evenly)
        4.  **Wavelength Shifting:**  If necessary, shift the wavelength of the signal to an available channel on the new route.
        5.  **Switch Configuration:** Configure the MFOS to route the signal along the new path.
        6.  **Power Adjustment:**  Adjust the VOA to optimize signal power on the new route.
        7.  **Continuous Optimization:**  Periodically re-evaluate routes and wavelengths to adapt to changing network conditions.
    *   Failure Prediction Module: Using historical data and real-time monitoring, predict potential fiber failures before they occur.  Proactively re-route traffic to prevent service disruptions.
    *   Remote Management Interface:  Web-based interface for monitoring network performance, configuring parameters, and managing the system.

*   **Pseudocode (DSAA - Simplified):**

```
function DynamicSpectrumAllocation() {
  while (true) {
    FiberHealth = MonitorFiberHealth();
    SpectrumMap = CreateSpectrumMap();
    DegradedFiber = DetectDegradedFiber(FiberHealth);

    if (DegradedFiber) {
      AlternativeRoutes = CalculateAlternativeRoutes(DegradedFiber, SpectrumMap);
      BestRoute = SelectBestRoute(AlternativeRoutes);

      ShiftWavelength(BestRoute);
      ConfigureMFOS(BestRoute);
      AdjustVOA(BestRoute);
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond simply *appearing* cut to *actively* managing fiber failures and optimizing network performance. It utilizes wavelength shifting and a multi-fiber switch to create a self-healing and dynamically configurable optical network. The predictive failure module adds a proactive element, further enhancing reliability and minimizing service disruptions. The integration of wavelength management allows for greater spectral efficiency and capacity.
