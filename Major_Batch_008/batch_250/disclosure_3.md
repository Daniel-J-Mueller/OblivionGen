## Dynamic Emotional Palette Generation & Associated Content Delivery

**Core Concept:** Extend color-based recommendation beyond static palettes to *dynamically* generate palettes reflecting emotional states detected from user-provided media (images, audio, video) and then deliver content aligned with that generated emotional palette.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** User-provided media (image, audio, video – multi-modal input preferred).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Visual Analysis:** Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) pre-trained on large datasets of images labeled with emotional attributes (e.g., valence, arousal, dominance). Output: Emotion vector representing the dominant emotions in the visual content.
    *   **Audio Analysis:** Employ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – specifically LSTMs – trained on audio datasets labeled with emotional content (e.g., speech prosody, music genre). Output: Emotion vector representing the dominant emotions in the audio content.
    *   **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Combine visual and audio emotion vectors using a weighted averaging or more complex fusion technique (e.g., attention mechanisms). Output: Combined emotion vector representing the overall emotional state of the input media.
*   **Output:** A numerical representation of the dominant emotional state (e.g., a vector in a 3D emotional space representing valence, arousal, and dominance).

**2. Palette Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Emotion Vector (from Emotional Analysis Module).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Mapping Function:** Employ a non-linear mapping function (e.g., a neural network or a polynomial function) to translate the emotion vector into RGB color values. This mapping function is trained on a dataset of emotion-color associations (e.g., 'sadness' maps to blue/gray, 'joy' maps to yellow/orange, etc.).  The function should be configurable to allow for different aesthetic preferences.
    *   **Palette Expansion:** Generate a full color palette (e.g., 5-7 colors) by subtly varying the base colors derived from the emotion vector. This ensures visual harmony and allows for broader content matching. Algorithmic approaches like color harmony rules (complementary, analogous, triadic) should be incorporated.
*   **Output:** A dynamically generated color palette (RGB values for each color).

**3. Content Recommendation & Delivery Module:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic Color Palette.  User Profile (preferences, history).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Content Database:** A database of images, videos, articles, music, etc., each tagged with its dominant colors (using computer vision techniques) *and* associated emotional attributes (using NLP and sentiment analysis).
    *   **Color Matching:** Calculate the color distance (e.g., using Delta E CIELAB) between the dynamic color palette and the color profiles of content items in the database.
    *   **Emotional Alignment:**  Filter content items to prioritize those with emotional attributes aligned with the *input media's* emotion vector.
    *   **Hybrid Ranking:** Combine color matching scores and emotional alignment scores to generate a ranked list of recommended content. User profile data is incorporated to personalize the recommendations.
*   **Output:** A curated stream of content (images, videos, articles, music) presented to the user, tailored to the emotional state detected from their input media.

**4. User Interface (UI):**

*   **Real-time Visualization:** Display the dynamically generated color palette alongside the presented content, providing visual feedback to the user.
*   **Emotional Feedback:**  Provide textual descriptions of the detected emotional state (e.g., "This image evokes feelings of calmness and serenity").
*   **Palette Customization:**  Allow users to manually adjust the color palette, overriding the automated generation process if desired.
*   **Input Methods**: Allow image upload, URL import, audio recording, and live video feed integration.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function generate_emotional_palette(input_media):
  emotion_vector = analyze_emotion(input_media)
  palette = map_emotion_to_color(emotion_vector)
  expand_palette(palette)
  return palette

function recommend_content(user_profile, palette):
  content_list = query_content_database(palette, user_profile)
  ranked_content = sort_content(content_list)
  return ranked_content

```

**Novelty:** This expands upon simple color-based recommendations by *dynamically* generating palettes from user-supplied media and incorporating emotional analysis. This allows for a more nuanced and personalized content experience, reacting to the user's emotional state in real-time. The system doesn't just match colors; it understands the *feeling* behind them.
