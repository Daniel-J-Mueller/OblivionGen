## Adaptive Expiration Based on User Behavior Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the expiration data modification beyond simple request counts/time elapsed and incorporate user-specific behavior profiles to tailor cache residence times. This aims to preemptively cache content *before* a user requests it, based on predicted need, and aggressively expire content for users with demonstrably changing preferences.

**Specs:**

1.  **User Profiling Module:**
    *   Tracks user requests across all cache tiers.
    *   Builds a dynamic preference profile based on content type, frequency, time of day, location (if permitted), and device type.
    *   Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) to predict future content requests.
    *   Assigns a "preference score" to each content type for each user.

2.  **Expiration Data Modification Logic:**

    ```pseudocode
    function modifyExpirationData(resource, cacheComponent, userProfile):
        baseExpiration = determineBaseExpiration(cacheComponent.level) // Hierarchy-based expiration

        userPreferenceScore = userProfile.getPreferenceScore(resource.contentType)

        if userPreferenceScore > 0.8: // High preference - aggressive caching
            expirationMultiplier = 0.5  // Reduce expiration by 50%
        elif userPreferenceScore > 0.5: // Moderate preference
            expirationMultiplier = 0.8
        else: // Low/No preference - aggressive expiration
            expirationMultiplier = 1.2 // Increase expiration

        newExpiration = baseExpiration * expirationMultiplier

        // Clamp newExpiration within acceptable range
        newExpiration = clamp(newExpiration, minExpiration, maxExpiration)

        resource.expirationData = newExpiration
        return resource
    ```

3.  **Cache Hierarchy Integration:**
    *   User profile data is transmitted to the lowest-level cache server accessed by the user.
    *   The lowest-level cache server utilizes the `modifyExpirationData` function to adjust the expiration time of each resource.
    *   Expiration data is propagated *up* the cache hierarchy. Higher-level caches maintain the user-adjusted expiration times, creating a personalized caching layer.

4.  **Dynamic Profile Updates:**
    *   User profiles are updated in real-time based on ongoing request patterns.
    *   A "decay factor" is applied to older request data to reflect changing preferences.
    *   If a user's behavior deviates significantly from their established profile, a "reset" mechanism can trigger a fresh profile reconstruction.

5.  **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   User data is anonymized and aggregated wherever possible.
    *   Users have the option to opt-out of personalized caching.
    *   Data retention policies adhere to privacy regulations.
