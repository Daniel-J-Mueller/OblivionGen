## Dynamic Acoustic Feature Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on dynamically generating parameters for probability density functions based on preceding frames. This idea expands on that concept by *dynamically weighting* different acoustic features used *within* those probability density functions based on the current utterance context. Instead of simply modeling the distribution of feature vectors, we model *which* features are most important at any given moment, and adjust the probability density function accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Acoustic Feature Set:** 
    *   Define a comprehensive set of acoustic features beyond typical MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients). Include:
        *   Formant frequencies & bandwidths
        *   Spectral tilt
        *   Energy ratios in different frequency bands
        *   Voice quality measures (jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio).
    *   Each feature will be normalized and scaled for consistent input to the reinforcement learning agent.

**2. Reinforcement Learning Agent:**
    *   **State:** The state observed by the RL agent will consist of:
        *   The current frame's acoustic feature vector.
        *   A history of previous *n* frames’ acoustic feature vectors.
        *   The current decoding graph state (as per the existing patent).
        *   A representation of the utterance’s prosodic features (pitch, energy, duration) up to the current frame.
    *   **Action:** The action the agent takes is a set of weights – one for each acoustic feature in the defined set. These weights will determine the contribution of each feature to the probability density function.
    *   **Reward:** The reward function is critical. It should be a combination of:
        *   **Recognition Accuracy:** A measure of how well the speech recognition system is performing *after* applying the feature weights.
        *   **Decoding Graph Confidence:**  The confidence scores associated with the top-scoring states in the decoding graph. Higher confidence = higher reward.
        *   **Regularization Term:** A penalty for extreme feature weights (to encourage stability and prevent overfitting).
    *   **Algorithm:** Utilize a Deep Q-Network (DQN) or a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for training the agent.

**3. Probability Density Function Modification:**

*   Instead of directly generating parameters (mean, variance) for a PDF based on preceding frames, the system will:
    1.  Obtain the base parameters (mean, variance) for each acoustic feature from a pre-trained Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) or other suitable statistical model.
    2.  Multiply each base parameter by the corresponding weight generated by the RL agent.
    3.  Use the weighted parameters to construct the final probability density function for the current frame.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Training Phase:

FOR epoch IN range(num_epochs):
    FOR frame IN utterance:
        state = get_state(frame, history, decoding_graph_state, prosodic_features)
        action = RL_agent.select_action(state) // Returns a vector of feature weights
        
        // Modify PDF parameters based on weights
        weighted_parameters = base_parameters * action
        pdf = create_pdf(weighted_parameters)
        
        score = calculate_score(pdf, current_frame)
        reward = calculate_reward(score, decoding_graph_confidence)
        
        RL_agent.update(state, action, reward)

// Recognition Phase:

FOR frame IN audio_data:
    state = get_state(frame, history, decoding_graph_state, prosodic_features)
    action = RL_agent.select_action(state)
    weighted_parameters = base_parameters * action
    pdf = create_pdf(weighted_parameters)
    score = calculate_score(pdf, current_frame)
    // Use score to update decoding graph (as in original patent)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   GPU for training the RL agent.
*   Large dataset of labeled speech data for training.
*   Speech recognition engine.
*   Deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Implementation of GMM or other suitable statistical model.
