## Personalized Environmental Resonance

**Concept:** Augment presence detection with environmental data to create a personalized “resonance profile” for each user, influencing localized environmental controls (lighting, temperature, audio) proactively, *before* explicit commands are given. This moves beyond simple presence detection to anticipatory environmental adaptation.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Each device (microphone, camera, potentially wearable sensors) collects:
    *   Audio data (beyond wake word detection - ambient soundscape analysis)
    *   Visual data (room layout, object identification, activity recognition)
    *   Environmental data (temperature, humidity, light levels, air quality – from device or connected sensors)
    *   User biometrics (heart rate, skin conductance - optional, from wearables)
*   **Resonance Profile Creation:**
    *   Machine learning model (trained on user interaction data, environmental sensor data, and explicit user preferences).
    *   The model learns correlations between:
        *   User presence (confirmed via audio/visual ID)
        *   Time of day
        *   Environmental conditions
        *   User activity (inferred from visual and audio data)
        *   User preferences (explicitly set or inferred from past behavior)
    *   Output: A multi-dimensional “resonance profile” for each user – a vector representing preferred environmental settings for various contexts.
*   **Proactive Environmental Control:**
    *   When a user is detected (presence confirmed via speaker ID) and their resonance profile is loaded:
        *   The system adjusts environmental controls (lighting, temperature, audio) *before* any explicit command is given, based on the predicted preferred settings in the resonance profile.
        *   Control adjustments are gradual and subtle, to avoid jarring the user.
    *   Ongoing learning: The system monitors user reactions to environmental changes (e.g., does the user manually adjust the temperature?), and refines the resonance profile accordingly.
*   **Contextual Blending:**
    *   If multiple users are present, the system blends their resonance profiles based on proximity and potential shared preferences.
    *   User override: Any user can manually override the automated environmental controls.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On device boot:
load_user_profiles()

// On presence detection:
function on_user_detected(user_id, device_id):
  user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
  current_environment = get_current_environment(device_id)
  predicted_environment = predict_preferred_environment(user_profile, current_environment)
  apply_environmental_changes(predicted_environment)

// Background Process
function refine_user_profile(user_id, environmental_changes, user_response):
  // Monitor user response to environmental changes
  // Update resonance profile based on user feedback
  update_user_profile(user_id, new_profile)
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive presence-based control to proactive, personalized environmental adaptation. Utilizes a learned “resonance profile” for each user, incorporating a wider range of environmental and behavioral data. It aims to create an invisible, anticipatory system that adapts to the user's needs without requiring explicit commands.
