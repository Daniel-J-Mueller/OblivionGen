## Dynamic Data Feed - "Affinity Echo" - Personalised Data Source Integration

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic data feed beyond a single social network or purchase history. Create a system that proactively identifies and integrates *multiple* data sources reflecting a user's broader affinities – not just purchase/social data, but also public datasets reflecting hobbies, interests, professional affiliations, and even location-based activities – and then generates a feed based on *echoes* of these affinities from other users.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Source Identification & Affinity Profiling Module:**

*   **Input:** User account identifier.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Explicit Data:** Access existing purchase history, social network connections (as per patent).
    *   **Implicit Data:**  API connections to publicly available datasets (e.g., Meetup.com for hobby groups, LinkedIn for professional affiliations, OpenStreetMap for frequented locations, Goodreads for reading lists, Letterboxd for film watching). Utilize web scraping techniques where APIs are unavailable.  Respect privacy restrictions (data anonymization/aggregation when required).
    *   **Affinity Scoring:** Develop an algorithm to assign a weighted score to each data point based on its relevance and frequency.  Example: attending weekly photography meetups = high weight for "photography" affinity; single purchase of a photography book = low weight.
    *   **Affinity Profile:** Construct a user affinity profile – a vector representation of the user’s interests and activities.
*   **Output:** User Affinity Profile (vector).

**2. "Echo" Network Construction Module:**

*   **Input:** User Affinity Profile (vector), Database of other user profiles.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Similarity Calculation:** Calculate the similarity between the input user's affinity profile and every other user profile in the database. Utilize cosine similarity or other relevant metrics.
    *   **Network Construction:** Build a network graph where nodes represent users and edges represent the strength of affinity similarity.
    *   **Neighborhood Identification:** For a given user, identify the ‘n’ most similar users (neighbors) – users with the highest affinity similarity score.
*   **Output:** Network of users and their affinity scores.

**3. Dynamic Feed Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Network of users, User account identifier.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Content Aggregation:** Aggregate content (reviews, ratings, wish list items, social posts, publicly available content) from the user's neighbors.
    *   **Content Filtering:** Filter content based on relevance to the user's affinity profile (utilize keyword matching, topic modelling, semantic analysis).
    *   **Personalized Ranking:** Rank content based on a combination of:
        *   Affinity similarity between the source user and the target user.
        *   Content relevance to the target user’s affinity profile.
        *   Content freshness/recency.
    *   **Dynamic Feed Construction:** Create a dynamic feed by presenting the ranked content in a scrollable format.
*   **Output:** Dynamic data feed presented to the user.

**4.  "Serendipity Boost" Module:**

*   **Process:** Introduce a small percentage of content from users *outside* the immediate neighborhood – users with weak or indirect connections.  This is to encourage discovery and serendipity.
*   **Output:** Modified Dynamic Data Feed with "Serendipity Boost" content.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateDynamicFeed(userID):
    userProfile = getAffinityProfile(userID)
    neighborNetwork = buildNeighborNetwork(userProfile)
    feedContent = aggregateContent(neighborNetwork)
    rankedContent = rankContent(feedContent, userProfile)
    serendipityContent = addSerendipityBoost(rankedContent)
    return displayDynamicFeed(serendipityContent)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Real-time Updates:** Update the feed in real-time as new content becomes available from neighbors.
*   **Explainable Recommendations:** Provide explanations for why certain content is being recommended (e.g., “Recommended because a user with similar interests to you reviewed this item”).
*   **Privacy Controls:** Allow users to control which data sources are used to build their affinity profile and who can see their activity.
*   **Cross-Platform Integration:** Integrate with a wide range of data sources and platforms (e.g., social media, e-commerce sites, news outlets).
