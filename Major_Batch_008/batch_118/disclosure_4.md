## Adaptive Tactile Housing - Specification

**Concept:** Integrate microfluidic channels within the second injection molded layer to create dynamically adjustable tactile surfaces. This allows for customizable grip, texture, and even haptic feedback directly on the device exterior.

**Materials:**

*   **First Mold Layer:** Reinforced Polycarbonate with >40% continuous-strand glass fiber. (As per patent reference â€“ provides structural rigidity)
*   **Second Mold Layer:** Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) with <10% chopped-strand glass fiber. (Provides flexibility and allows for microfluidic channel integration)
*   **Microfluidic Channels:** Etched into TPU during manufacturing. Channel dimensions: width 0.2-0.5mm, depth 0.1-0.3mm.
*   **Working Fluid:** Non-conductive, dielectric fluid (e.g., silicone oil) with controlled viscosity.
*   **Micro-Pump/Valve System:** Miniature piezoelectric pump and valve array integrated *within* the device chassis (leveraging existing mounting plate/screw boss structure).

**Manufacturing Process:**

1.  Standard injection molding of First Mold Layer onto metal chassis.
2.  Microfluidic channels are etched into the TPU material *before* Second Mold Layer injection molding. Etching techniques: laser ablation, micro-milling, or chemical etching.
3.  Second Mold Layer is overmolded onto First Mold Layer, encapsulating the microfluidic channel network.
4.  Micro-pump/valve system is assembled and connected to the microfluidic channels.
5.  Working fluid is injected into the channel network.

**Functional Specification:**

*   **Tactile Zones:** Divide the device exterior into programmable tactile zones. Each zone corresponds to a section of the microfluidic channel network.
*   **Channel Control:**  Individual micro-valves control fluid flow into each tactile zone. 
*   **Pressure Modulation:** The micro-pump modulates fluid pressure within the channels. Increased pressure causes a localized bulge in the TPU, creating a raised texture. Decreased pressure returns the surface to its original state.
*   **Software Interface:**  A software interface allows users to customize the tactile experience. Options include:
    *   Pre-defined grip patterns.
    *   Customizable texture creation.
    *   Haptic feedback integration (e.g., localized bumps for notifications).
    *   Adaptive grip based on device orientation and user activity.
*   **Power Management:**  Minimize power consumption by employing pulse-width modulation (PWM) for pump/valve control. Utilize low-power microcontrollers.

**Pseudocode (Channel Control Logic):**

```
function set_tactile_zone(zone_id, texture_pattern, pressure_level):
  // texture_pattern: array of pressure values for each micro-channel in the zone
  // pressure_level: overall intensity scaling factor (0.0 - 1.0)

  for each channel in zone_id:
    target_pressure = texture_pattern[channel] * pressure_level

    // Calculate valve opening duration to achieve target_pressure
    valve_duration = calculate_valve_duration(target_pressure)

    // Open valve for calculated duration
    open_valve(channel, valve_duration)
end function
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced grip for mobile gaming.
*   Improved accessibility for users with limited dexterity.
*   Interactive notifications and alerts.
*   Customizable device aesthetics.
*   Biometric authentication (pressure mapping).
