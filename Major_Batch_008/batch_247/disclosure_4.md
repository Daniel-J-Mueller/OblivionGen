## Adaptive Capability Broker with Predictive Resource Allocation

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Capability Broker (CB) - Software service operating within the localized network (can reside on a POP or dedicated device).
*   **Device Profiles:** Each device maintains a dynamic profile including:
    *   Hardware specifications (sensors, compute, bandwidth).
    *   Software capabilities (applications, APIs).
    *   Resource availability (CPU, memory, battery).
    *   Historical usage patterns.
    *   Predicted future needs (based on user behavior/scheduled tasks).
*   **Capability Request Protocol:** Standardized protocol for devices to request capabilities.  Requests include:
    *   Desired capability (e.g., image processing, audio analysis).
    *   Data format requirements.
    *   Latency/throughput expectations.
    *   Security/privacy constraints.
*   **Resource Prediction Engine:**  AI/ML model residing within the CB.
    *   Trains on historical device usage data.
    *   Predicts future resource needs for each device.
    *   Anticipates capability requests before they are made.
*   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** CB allocates resources proactively.
    *   Pre-allocates devices with necessary resources.
    *   Adjusts resource allocation based on real-time demand.
*   **Capability Synthesis:**  CB can combine capabilities from multiple devices.
    *   Orchestrates data flow between devices.
    *   Performs data aggregation and processing.
*   **Security Framework:** Robust authentication and authorization mechanism.
    *   Data encryption and secure communication channels.
    *   Privacy-preserving data sharing.

**Innovation Description:**

The system extends the patent's concept by moving beyond reactive capability sharing to *predictive* resource allocation. Instead of waiting for a device to request a capability, the system anticipates needs and proactively prepares resources.

**Pseudocode (CB Core Logic):**

```
// Initialization
Load Device Profiles
Train Resource Prediction Engine

// Main Loop
While (Network Active) {
    // Predict Resource Needs
    predicted_needs = ResourcePredictionEngine.predict()

    // Proactive Resource Allocation
    For Each (device, needs) in predicted_needs {
        If (resources available) {
            allocate(device, needs)
        } Else {
            // Request additional resources (e.g., from cloud)
            request_resources(needs)
        }
    }

    // Handle Capability Requests
    While (requests available) {
        request = get_request()
        device = request.source
        capability = request.capability

        // Check if capability is already pre-allocated
        If (pre_allocated(device, capability)) {
            // Fulfill request immediately
            fulfill_request(request)
        } Else {
            // Find suitable device
            provider = find_provider(capability)
            If (provider != null) {
                allocate(provider, capability)
                fulfill_request(request)
            } Else {
                // Handle request failure (e.g., queue, notify user)
                handle_failure(request)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system isnâ€™t just about sharing; it's about *anticipating* and *preparing*. It adds a layer of intelligence that optimizes resource utilization and minimizes latency. This is accomplished through a predictive engine that leverages historical data and machine learning. The capability synthesis element allows for more complex workflows to be orchestrated across multiple devices.
