## Dynamic Query 'Shadowing' and Predictive Cancellation

**Core Concept:** Extend the predictive modeling beyond simply estimating execution time. Instead, *actively* 'shadow' a query’s early execution with a continuously updated predictive model, and use discrepancies between the prediction and actual execution to proactively cancel or dynamically adjust the query. This moves beyond post-hoc termination to *prevent* wasted resources.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Query Execution:**

*   Upon receiving a query, initiate two parallel execution paths:
    *   **Primary Execution:** The standard query execution on the data storage system.
    *   **Shadow Execution:** A lightweight, resource-limited execution mirroring the initial stages of the primary execution. This focuses on the initial data access patterns and operator activations – essentially a 'fast path' approximation of the query.
*   The Shadow Execution uses a significantly smaller subset of data (sampling) and a simplified execution plan. The goal is speed, *not* accuracy.

**2. Adaptive Predictive Model:**

*   The existing linear regression model (from the patent) forms the *base* prediction.
*   Continuously feed data from *both* Primary and Shadow Execution into the model.  Specifically:
    *   **Primary Execution Data:** Actual resource consumption (CPU, I/O, memory) at fixed intervals.
    *   **Shadow Execution Data:** Resource consumption and progress metrics (e.g., number of rows processed, stages completed).
*   Employ a Kalman Filter or similar recursive Bayesian estimation technique to dynamically *update* the predicted execution time and resource consumption. The Kalman Filter excels at integrating noisy, real-time data with a prior model.
*   Include ‘drift’ parameters in the model to account for changing system conditions (e.g., increased load, temporary network latency).

**3. Discrepancy Detection & Action:**

*   Calculate the discrepancy between the predicted resource consumption and the actual resource consumption (from Primary Execution) at fixed intervals.
*   Define a discrepancy threshold. This threshold is dynamic and adjusted based on:
    *   Historical query performance.
    *   System load.
    *   Query complexity (estimated from its parse tree).
*   If the discrepancy exceeds the threshold:
    *   **Stage-Level Cancellation:**  If the discrepancy is localized to a specific stage of the query plan, attempt to cancel *only* that stage and reschedule it with different parameters (e.g., different data partitioning).
    *   **Query Cancellation:** If the discrepancy is widespread, cancel the entire query.
    *   **Dynamic Resource Adjustment:** (Advanced) If possible, dynamically adjust resource allocation to the query (e.g., increase memory allocation, assign more CPU cores).

**4. Cost Modeling Enhancement:**

*   Introduce a ‘penalty’ factor into the cost model based on the number of times a query has been cancelled or dynamically adjusted. This discourages execution plans that are prone to instability.
*   Capture ‘interruption cost’ – the overhead associated with cancelling a query stage or the entire query.

**Pseudocode (Discrepancy Detection & Action):**

```
function handle_query(query):
  primary_execution = start_execution(query)
  shadow_execution = start_shadow_execution(query)
  model = initialize_model()

  while (query is still executing):
    primary_resource_usage = get_resource_usage(primary_execution)
    shadow_resource_usage = get_resource_usage(shadow_execution)

    predicted_resource_usage = model.predict(query, shadow_resource_usage)

    discrepancy = abs(predicted_resource_usage - primary_resource_usage)

    if discrepancy > dynamic_threshold():
      if is_localized_discrepancy(discrepancy):
        cancel_stage(discrepancy)
        reschedule_stage()
      else:
        cancel_query()
        break

    model.update(query, shadow_resource_usage, primary_resource_usage)

  end_execution(primary_execution)
  end_execution(shadow_execution)
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Efficient Shadow Execution: Minimize the overhead of Shadow Execution by carefully selecting data samples and simplifying the execution plan.
*   Real-Time Monitoring: Accurate and low-latency monitoring of resource consumption is crucial.
*   Adaptive Thresholding: The dynamic discrepancy threshold must be carefully tuned to avoid false positives and false negatives.
*   Query Plan Awareness: The system needs to be aware of the query plan to enable stage-level cancellation.
