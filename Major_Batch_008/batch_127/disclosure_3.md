## Seed Delegation for Distributed AI Model Training

**Concept:** Leverage the seed tree/hash tree structure not for signature delegation, but for distributing and verifying parameters of a large AI model during federated/distributed training. Each leaf node represents a shard of the model parameters, secured by its position in the tree.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Central Coordinator:**  Manages the master seed, tree creation, and parameter distribution.  Acts as the central point of truth for the model.
*   **Edge Nodes (Trainers):**  Participate in training. Receive a seed value, derive model parameter shards, perform local training, and return updated shards.
*   **Verification Nodes:** Independently verify the integrity of received model shards using the hash tree structure.  Can be a subset of the Edge Nodes or dedicated infrastructure.

**2.  Seed Tree & Parameter Mapping:**

*   The Central Coordinator generates a master seed.
*   A seed tree is created.  The depth and fanout of the tree determine the number of parameter shards. (e.g., Fanout=4, Depth=3 yields 64 shards).
*   Each leaf node of the seed tree is mapped to a specific shard of the AI model parameters. The seed value at that leaf node is used to *derive* the initial parameter values for that shard. This derivation could involve a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded with the leaf node value.
*   The root seed is distributed to all Edge Nodes.  Each Edge Node then traverses the seed tree to *derive* the leaf node value corresponding to its assigned shards (determined by a pre-agreed upon mapping).

**3. Training Protocol:**

1.  **Initialization:** Central Coordinator generates the master seed and seed tree. Edge Nodes receive the root seed.
2.  **Shard Derivation:**  Each Edge Node derives its assigned leaf node values from the root seed and seed tree. These values are used to initialize its corresponding model parameter shards.
3.  **Local Training:**  Edge Nodes perform local training on their shards using their local datasets.
4.  **Shard Update & Hashing:** After training, each Edge Node computes a cryptographic hash of its *updated* shards.
5.  **Hash Tree Construction:** Edge Nodes send their shard hashes to the Central Coordinator. The Central Coordinator builds a hash tree using these hashes, forming the root hash.
6.  **Verification:** The Central Coordinator sends the root hash to Verification Nodes. Verification Nodes can independently reconstruct portions of the hash tree to verify the integrity of specific shards.

**4. Pseudocode (Central Coordinator - Key Functions):**

```python
def generate_seed_tree(master_seed, depth, fanout):
    # Implements the seed tree generation algorithm.
    # Returns a data structure representing the tree.
    pass

def distribute_root_seed(root_seed, edge_nodes):
    # Sends the root seed to all Edge Nodes
    pass

def construct_master_hash_tree(shard_hashes):
    # Builds the master hash tree from received shard hashes
    # Returns the root hash
    pass

def verify_shard_integrity(shard_hash, expected_hash):
    # Compares received shard hash with expected hash from master tree
    return shard_hash == expected_hash

```

**5. Enhancements:**

*   **Differential Privacy Integration:** Introduce noise during shard hash calculation to ensure differential privacy.
*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:**  Implement mechanisms to detect and mitigate malicious Edge Nodes providing incorrect shard hashes.
*   **Dynamic Tree Adjustment:** Allow the tree depth and fanout to be adjusted dynamically based on resource availability and network conditions.
*   **Homomorphic Encryption:** Explore using homomorphic encryption to allow training on encrypted shards, further enhancing privacy.
