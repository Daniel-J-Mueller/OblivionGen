## Dynamic Bid Request ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive Underdelivery Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to proactively ‘shadow’ bid requests *before* underdelivery is observed, creating a predictive model for potential issues. This moves beyond reactive troubleshooting to preventative optimization.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadow Request Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Underdelivered content item properties (as in the base patent).
    *   Process:
        *   Generate *multiple* (N, configurable) slightly modified bid requests based on the original content item properties.  Modifications are governed by a ‘mutation matrix’ (see item 4).
        *   Each shadow bid request is submitted *concurrently* with the primary bid request.
    *   Output: N shadow bid requests, primary bid request.

2.  **Parallel Bid Processing Engine:**
    *   Input: Primary bid request, N shadow bid requests.
    *   Process:  Submit all requests to the content server simultaneously. Capture all responses (candidate sets, selection status, associated data). This necessitates infrastructure to handle potentially increased load.
    *   Output: Complete response data for all requests.

3.  **Comparative Analysis & Feature Extraction:**
    *   Input: Response data from Parallel Bid Processing Engine.
    *   Process:
        *   Compare candidate sets across all requests.  Identify features that correlate with the underdelivered content item being selected or unselected in *any* of the shadow requests.  For example: bid price deltas, targeting parameter mismatches, creative format incompatibility.
        *   Calculate a ‘shadow selection score’ for the underdelivered content item based on its presence/absence in shadow candidate sets.
        *   Extract ‘delta features’ – the differences in content server response *caused* by the mutations in the shadow requests.
    *   Output: Shadow selection score, delta features.

4.  **Mutation Matrix Configuration:**
    *   Data Structure: A configurable table defining parameters to mutate in bid requests.
    *   Parameters:
        *   Targeting Parameter (e.g., age, gender, interests) – Randomly adjust within acceptable ranges.
        *   Bid Price – Add/subtract a percentage (configurable).
        *   Creative Format – Cycle through supported formats (if applicable).
        *   Geographic Location – Slightly shift target location.
    *   Configuration: Allows A/B testing of mutation strategies to optimize predictive power.
    *   Storage: A database table storing parameters and values for various mutation types.

5.  **Predictive Underdelivery Model:**
    *   Algorithm:  Machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on historical shadow request data and subsequent actual underdelivery events.
    *   Input: Shadow selection score, delta features.
    *   Output: Probability of actual underdelivery.  Higher probability triggers proactive adjustments (see item 6).

6.  **Proactive Adjustment Engine:**
    *   Trigger: Probability of underdelivery exceeds a configurable threshold.
    *   Actions:
        *   Automatically adjust content item properties (e.g., increase bid price, refine targeting).
        *   Notify relevant teams (e.g., ad operations) for review.
        *   Adjust the Mutation Matrix to focus on more effective mutation strategies.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function analyzeUnderdelivery(contentItem):
  primaryRequest = generateBidRequest(contentItem)
  shadowRequests = generateShadowRequests(contentItem, mutationMatrix)
  responses = submitRequests(primaryRequest, shadowRequests)
  shadowScore, deltaFeatures = analyzeResponses(responses)
  underdeliveryProbability = predictUnderdelivery(shadowScore, deltaFeatures)

  if underdeliveryProbability > threshold:
    adjustContentItem(contentItem)
    notifyTeam()
    updateMutationMatrix()
```
