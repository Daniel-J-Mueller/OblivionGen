## Adaptive Mesh Beaconing & Dynamic Channel Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the relay/bridging functionality to proactively manage channel congestion and optimize mesh network performance by introducing adaptive beaconing and dynamic channel allocation based on real-time interference and bandwidth usage.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Relay Device:** Existing relay device capabilities (as per the patent) + dedicated radio interface for monitoring/scanning adjacent channels. This can be the same radio used for communication, with time-slicing, or a second dedicated chip.
*   **Client Devices:** Standard Wi-Fi capable devices.
*   **Network Router:** Standard Wi-Fi capable router.

**2. Software Components (Relay Device):**

*   **Channel Scanner:** Continuously scans for available Wi-Fi channels, measuring signal strength (RSSI), noise levels, and detected access points (BSSIDs).
*   **Interference Map:**  Maintains a dynamic map of channel congestion, prioritizing channels with minimal interference.  This map is built by the Channel Scanner.
*   **Beaconing Manager:** Responsible for controlling the beaconing frequency and content of the relay device.
*   **Dynamic Channel Allocator:**  Analyzes the Interference Map and Beaconing Manager data to determine optimal channels for mesh links.
*   **Link Quality Monitor:** Estimates the quality of links between the relay and client devices, using metrics like signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and packet loss.
*   **Policy Engine:** Defines rules for channel selection based on factors like link quality, interference, and device capabilities.

**3.  Communication Protocol/Pseudocode:**

```
// Relay Device - Core Loop

while (true) {
    scanChannels(); // Update Interference Map
    monitorLinkQuality();

    if (interferenceHigh() || linkQualityLow()) {
        optimalChannel = findOptimalChannel();

        // Signal client devices to switch to optimalChannel via beacon updates
        updateBeacon(optimalChannel);

        //Update routing policies to prefer optimal channel
        updateRoutingPolicies(optimalChannel);
    }
}

// Function: scanChannels()
// Scans Wi-Fi channels and updates the Interference Map.

function scanChannels() {
    for each channel in [1, 6, 11, ... ] { // Iterate through available channels
        scanForAPs(channel);
        recordSignalStrength(channel);
        recordNoiseLevel(channel);
    }
    // Build Interference Map based on recorded data
}

//Function: updateBeacon(channel)
//Modifies the beaconing frequency/content to signal channel change

function updateBeacon(channel){
    beaconPayload = {
        channel: channel,
        timestamp: getCurrentTimestamp()
    };
    transmitBeacon(beaconPayload);
}

// Function: findOptimalChannel()
// Analyzes the Interference Map and returns the optimal channel.

function findOptimalChannel() {
    // Prioritize channels with lowest interference and highest signal strength.
    bestChannel = null;
    lowestInterference = Infinity;

    for each channel in InterferenceMap {
        if (InterferenceMap[channel].interference < lowestInterference) {
            lowestInterference = InterferenceMap[channel].interference;
            bestChannel = channel;
        }
    }
    return bestChannel;
}

// Function: updateRoutingPolicies(channel)
//Modifies routing policies to reflect the updated channel.
function updateRoutingPolicies(channel){
    policy = {
        channel: channel
    };
    updateRoutingTable(policy);
}
```

**4.  Operational Flow:**

1.  The Relay Device continuously scans for available Wi-Fi channels and builds an Interference Map.
2.  The Relay Device monitors link quality with client devices.
3.  If interference levels are high or link quality is low, the Relay Device calculates the optimal channel using the Interference Map and link quality data.
4.  The Relay Device broadcasts a beacon signal to client devices, instructing them to switch to the optimal channel.
5.  Client devices switch to the new channel.
6.  The relay updates its routing policies to prioritize the new channel for communication with client devices.

**5. Considerations:**

*   **Beaconing Overhead:** Optimize beaconing frequency to minimize overhead while ensuring timely channel switching.
*   **Client Device Compatibility:**  Ensure client devices support channel switching based on beacon signals.
*   **Security:** Secure beacon signals to prevent malicious devices from disrupting the mesh network.
*   **Channel Bonding:** Explore the possibility of using channel bonding to increase bandwidth on selected channels.
