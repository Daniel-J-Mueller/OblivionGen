## Receptacle-Integrated Energy Harvesting & Wireless Data Transmission

**System Overview:** This design expands upon the LIM-driven materials handling system by integrating energy harvesting capabilities *within* the receptacles themselves, alongside a short-range wireless data transmission system. The core idea is to use the electromagnetic field generated by the LIMs not just for propulsion, but also to power onboard sensors and transmit data regarding the receptacle’s contents, condition, or location.

**I. Receptacle Modification – Energy Harvesting Unit (EHU)**

*   **Component:**  A multi-layer, flexible PCB integrated into the base of the receptacle (where the conductive element already exists).
*   **Layer 1 (Primary):**  Conductive element (as per existing patent) – Serves as both propulsion interaction and antenna base.
*   **Layer 2 (Rectenna Array):** A dense array of miniature rectifying antennas (rectennas) tuned to the frequency of the LIM’s electromagnetic field.  These convert the RF energy into DC power.  Array density and tuning are crucial for maximizing energy capture.
*   **Layer 3 (Power Management):** A low-power DC-DC converter and energy storage element (supercapacitor or small solid-state battery). This stabilizes the harvested power and provides a consistent voltage for onboard systems.  Includes overcharge/discharge protection.
*   **Layer 4 (Sensor Interface):**  Connectors and circuitry for interfacing with various sensors (see Section II).

**II. Sensor Suite (Optional, Modular)**

*   **Weight Sensor:** Strain gauge-based sensor integrated into the receptacle base to provide accurate weight readings.
*   **Temperature/Humidity Sensor:**  Small digital sensor for monitoring environmental conditions.
*   **Object/Content Identification:** RFID tag or miniature barcode scanner integrated into the receptacle for identifying the contents.
*   **Impact Sensor:** Accelerometer to detect impacts or mishandling.
*   **Connectivity:** All sensors connect to a low-power microcontroller.

**III. Wireless Data Transmission**

*   **Protocol:**  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Zigbee for short-range communication.
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power microcontroller (e.g., ARM Cortex-M0) handles sensor data acquisition, processing, and transmission.
*   **Transmission Trigger:**  Data transmission is triggered by one of the following:
    *   Receptacle reaching a designated “read point” (using strategically placed BLE beacons).
    *   Significant change in sensor readings (e.g., impact detected).
    *   Periodic transmission (configurable).
*   **Data Packet:**  Data packet includes: Receptacle ID, Weight, Temperature, Humidity, Content ID (if available), Impact Flag, Timestamp.

**IV. System Integration & Control**

*   **Read Points:**  BLE beacons strategically placed along the materials handling track.  These beacons act as receivers for data transmitted by the receptacles.
*   **Central Data Hub:** A central server collects data from the read points and stores it in a database.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:**  Software application provides real-time monitoring of receptacle location, contents, and condition.  Alerts can be generated for anomalies (e.g., impact detected, temperature out of range).

**Pseudocode (Microcontroller - Data Transmission):**

```
// Initialize sensors, BLE, and power management
initialize_sensors()
initialize_ble()
initialize_power_management()

while (true) {
  read_weight_sensor()
  read_temperature_sensor()
  read_humidity_sensor()
  read_content_id()
  detect_impact()

  // Check for trigger conditions (read point, anomaly, periodic)
  if (near_read_point() || anomaly_detected() || periodic_transmission_due()) {
    construct_data_packet()
    transmit_data_packet()
    // Reduce transmission frequency to conserve power
    delay(transmission_interval)
  }
  // Enter low-power sleep mode
  sleep()
}
```

**Materials:**

*   Flexible PCB with conductive traces and components.
*   High-efficiency rectenna elements.
*   Low-power microcontroller.
*   Miniature sensors.
*   Energy storage elements (supercapacitor or solid-state battery).
*   Durable, lightweight enclosure for components.
