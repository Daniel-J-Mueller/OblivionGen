## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction via Distributed Microphone Arrays & Temporal Echo Mapping

**Concept:** Expand upon the propagation delay time determination in the provided patent by not merely cancelling echoes, but *reconstructing* the acoustic scene. This is achieved via a distributed network of microphones, each capturing slightly differing temporal and spectral information due to propagation delays.  The system doesnâ€™t focus on *removing* reflections, but analyzing them to build a 3D map of the environment, identifying sound sources and surfaces.

**Specifications:**

*   **Microphone Network:**  A minimum of 4, ideally 8-16, wireless microphones deployed within the target space. Microphones transmit raw audio data to a central processing unit (CPU).  Microphones need to have precise timestamping capabilities (within 10 microseconds).
*   **Propagation Delay Mapping:**
    *   The CPU utilizes a modified version of the cross-correlation/normalized LMS analysis detailed in the patent to determine precise propagation delay times *between* each microphone pair, as well as from presumed/known sound sources.
    *   Instead of a single delay time, a *temporal echo map* is generated. This map represents the arrival times of sound at each microphone, accounting for direct sound and reflections from various surfaces.
    *   Data structure:  A directed graph where nodes represent microphones, and edge weights are propagation delay times.
*   **Scene Reconstruction Algorithm:**
    *   Utilize ray tracing based on the temporal echo map.
    *   Algorithm Steps:
        1.  Identify direct sound sources (through triangulation).
        2.  Analyze reflection patterns from the echo map.
        3.  Estimate surface properties (material, size, orientation) by matching observed reflection patterns with ray tracing simulations.
        4.  Build a 3D point cloud representation of the environment, including identified sound sources and surfaces.
*   **Temporal Resolution Enhancement:**
    *   Leverage compressed sensing techniques to enhance the temporal resolution of the reconstructed scene. 
    *   Pseudo-code:
        ```
        function enhance_resolution(echo_map, sampling_rate, desired_resolution):
            sparse_matrix = create_sparse_matrix(echo_map)
            reconstructed_signal = compressed_sensing_algorithm(sparse_matrix, sampling_rate, desired_resolution)
            return reconstructed_signal
        ```
*   **Adaptive Filtering Enhancement:**
    *   Integrate a spatial filtering stage to refine the reconstructed scene by leveraging the spatial distribution of the microphones.
    *   Pseudo-code:
        ```
        function spatial_filter(reconstructed_scene, microphone_positions):
            filtered_scene = apply_beamforming(reconstructed_scene, microphone_positions)
            return filtered_scene
        ```
*   **Output:**  A dynamic, 3D model of the acoustic environment, updated in real-time. This model can be used for:
    *   Virtual/Augmented Reality applications
    *   Sound source localization and tracking
    *   Acoustic analysis and design

    *   Real-time audio processing libraries
