## Dynamic Content Isolation & ‘Sandboxed Rendering’

**Concept:** Extend the policy-driven split-browser architecture to isolate *dynamic* content rendering within the server-side browser engine, effectively creating ‘sandboxed rendering’ for untrusted or potentially malicious web components, even *after* initial policy application. This goes beyond simply blocking content; it allows rendering *with* limitations, but in complete isolation.

**Specification:**

1.  **Content Classification Engine:** Integrate a real-time content classification engine within the server-side browser engine. This engine analyzes rendered content (DOM, scripts, network requests) for characteristics indicating potentially risky behavior (e.g., frequent redirects, script obfuscation, attempts to access sensitive APIs).

2.  **Dynamic Policy Adjustment:** Implement a system for dynamic policy adjustment *during* rendering.  The content classification engine feeds information to a policy manager, which can modify rendering parameters on-the-fly. For example:
    *   Disable JavaScript execution for a specific iframe.
    *   Restrict network access to a limited set of domains.
    *   Strip out specific DOM elements.
    *   Limit CPU/memory usage for a given rendering process.

3.  **Render Isolation Layers:** Introduce multiple ‘render isolation layers’ within the server-side browser engine. Each layer operates as a separate rendering context. Content identified as potentially risky is rendered in a lower-priority, isolated layer.  This prevents it from interfering with the main rendering process or accessing sensitive data.

4.  **Visual Compositing:** Implement a visual compositing system that combines the outputs of the different render isolation layers.  The client browser receives a single, composited image or set of graphics commands.  This hides the underlying isolation from the user.

5.  **API Interception & Redirection:** Intercept API calls made by the isolated content and redirect them to a secure proxy or mock implementation. This prevents access to sensitive system resources or user data. For instance, `window.location` could be intercepted and directed to a safe URL, or `localStorage` access could be denied.

**Pseudocode (Policy Application Flow):**

```
function renderPage(request, user) {
  // 1. Determine user policies
  policies = getPoliciesForUser(user);

  // 2. Initial Policy Application
  applyInitialPolicies(request, policies);

  // 3. Render Content (Server-Side)
  renderedContent = serverBrowser.render(request);

  // 4. Content Classification & Dynamic Policy Adjustment
  while (renderingInProgress(renderedContent)) {
    classificationResult = contentClassificationEngine.classify(renderedContent);
    if (classificationResult.isRisky) {
      dynamicPolicies = createDynamicPolicies(classificationResult);
      applyDynamicPolicies(renderedContent, dynamicPolicies);
    }
  }

  // 5. Visual Compositing
  compositedOutput = visualCompositor.compose(renderedContent);

  // 6. Transmit to Client
  transmitToClient(compositedOutput);
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server with significant CPU and memory resources.
*   Server-side browser engine capable of multi-process rendering.
*   Real-time content classification engine (machine learning based).
*   Secure proxy server for API interception.
*   Efficient visual compositing library.
*   Networking bandwidth for transmitting rendered output.
