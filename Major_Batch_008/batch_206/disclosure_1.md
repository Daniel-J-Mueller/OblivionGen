## Dynamic Morphing Dock - "Chrysalis"

**Concept:** A device dock that physically reconfigures its shape to optimally accommodate a diverse range of devices, not just phones and tablets, but also wearables, small cameras, and even specialized peripherals. Inspired by the metamorphic nature of a chrysalis, the dock dynamically adjusts its internal structure to cradle and connect with various devices.

**Core Technology:** Shape-memory alloy (SMA) actuators combined with a network of small, interlocking modules. These modules are housed within a flexible, durable outer shell (possibly a woven polymer or reinforced silicone). 

**Specs & Implementation:**

1.  **Modular Grid:**
    *   Internal structure composed of a 5x5 grid of individually addressable modules (25 total).
    *   Each module: 2cm x 2cm x 1cm.
    *   Modules connect via magnetic ball-and-socket joints allowing multi-axis movement.
    *   Module Material: Lightweight polymer reinforced with carbon fiber.
2.  **SMA Actuators:**
    *   Each module contains 4 micro-SMA actuators positioned at each corner.
    *   Actuators control the angle of each joint, enabling precise module positioning.
    *   Actuation Range: +/- 15 degrees per axis.
    *   Activation Voltage: 5V DC.
3.  **Device Recognition System:**
    *   Integrated micro-cameras and proximity sensors scan the device placed on the dock.
    *   AI-powered image recognition identifies the device type and connection requirements (USB-C, Lightning, Wireless Charging).
4.  **Control System:**
    *   Embedded microcontroller (ESP32 or similar) manages device recognition, actuator control, and power delivery.
    *   Software Algorithm:  
        ```pseudocode
        FUNCTION configureDock(deviceType):
          SWITCH deviceType:
            CASE "iPhone 14":
              setModulePositions([
                [0,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,0,0], [1,1,0], // Example positions
                [0,0,-1], [0,1,-1], [1,0,-1], [1,1,-1]
              ])
              activateWirelessCharging()
            CASE "Samsung Galaxy S23":
              setModulePositions([…])
              activateWirelessCharging()
            CASE "Apple Watch Series 8":
              setModulePositions([…])
              activateWirelessCharging()
            CASE "GoPro Hero 11":
              setModulePositions([…])
              activateUSBDataTransfer()
            DEFAULT:
              displayError("Device not recognized")
          END SWITCH
        END FUNCTION
        ```
5.  **Power & Connectivity:**
    *   Universal USB-C port for external power.
    *   Integrated wireless charging coils.
    *   Internal USB 3.0 hub for data transfer.
6.  **Outer Shell:**
    *   Flexible, durable silicone or woven polymer.
    *   Textured surface for grip and aesthetic appeal.
    *   RGB lighting for customizable visual feedback.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  User places device on the dock.
2.  Device recognition system identifies the device.
3.  Control system calculates optimal module configuration.
4.  SMA actuators reposition the modules to cradle the device securely.
5.  Dock activates appropriate power/data connection.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Universal charging and syncing station.
*   Display stand for various devices.
*   Portable workstation for creators and professionals.
*   Interactive art installation with dynamic form factor.
