**Adaptive Projection Mapping with Haptic Feedback**

**Concept:** Expand the system’s ability to interact with detected items by incorporating localized haptic feedback delivered via focused ultrasound, synchronized with projected visuals. This creates the illusion of physically interacting with virtual elements overlaid onto real-world objects.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing components: Depth sensor, color camera, projector.
    *   Added: Phased Ultrasound Array – Small, high-frequency phased array transducer capable of creating focused ultrasound beams.  Mounted adjacent to the projector lens or integrated into the projector housing. Resolution: Minimum 100 discrete ultrasound emitters. Frequency Range: 40kHz - 80kHz.
    *   Haptic Driver: Dedicated processing unit to manage ultrasound beamforming, timing, and intensity. Synchronization with projector and depth sensor data streams.
*   **Software:**
    *   Depth Data Processing: Real-time analysis of depth data to identify surface normals and material properties (estimated via color data) of detected items. This feeds into haptic rendering parameters.
    *   Haptic Rendering Engine: Translates projected visuals into corresponding haptic sensations. Algorithm considers:
        *   Visual Geometry: Sharp edges, curves, and textures are rendered as localized pressure variations.
        *   Material Properties: Simulated “hardness” or “softness” through intensity and duration of ultrasound pulses.
        *   Interaction Events: Trigger haptic feedback upon user interaction (e.g., virtual button press, object manipulation).
    *   Synchronization Module: Ensures precise timing between projector visuals, depth sensor data, and haptic feedback delivery. Latency target: < 10ms.
    *   Calibration Routine: Automated procedure to map ultrasound beam positions to projected visual elements. Considers lens distortion and projector geometry.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  Depth sensor captures scene geometry.
    2.  Color camera captures texture and material information.
    3.  Software identifies items and their surface properties.
    4.  Projector displays visuals onto the scene.
    5.  Haptic Rendering Engine calculates ultrasound parameters based on projected visuals and surface properties.
    6.  Haptic Driver controls the phased ultrasound array to create focused pressure waves on the user’s skin corresponding to the visual elements.
    7.  User perceives the illusion of touching and interacting with the projected visuals.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Rendering Engine):**

```
function renderHaptic(projectedPixel, surfaceNormal, materialProperty):
  // projectedPixel: 2D coordinates of the pixel being projected
  // surfaceNormal: Normal vector of the surface at that pixel
  // materialProperty: Estimated hardness/softness of the surface

  // Convert projectedPixel to 3D world coordinates using depth data

  // Calculate ultrasound beam parameters:
  intensity = baseIntensity * materialProperty // Harder surfaces = higher intensity
  duration = baseDuration * (1 - materialProperty) // Softer surfaces = longer duration
  frequency = baseFrequency + (dotProduct(surfaceNormal, lightSourceDirection) * frequencyOffset)

  // Create ultrasound beam command for Haptic Driver
  command = {
    x: worldX,
    y: worldY,
    z: worldZ,
    intensity: intensity,
    duration: duration,
    frequency: frequency
  }

  return command
end function
```

**Possible Applications:**

*   Interactive displays on any surface.
*   Virtual buttons and controls overlaid onto physical objects.
*   Realistic simulation of textures and materials.
*   Enhanced user interfaces for augmented reality applications.
*   Assistive technology for visually impaired users.
