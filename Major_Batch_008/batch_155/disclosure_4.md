## Adaptive Mutation Queuing with Predictive Conflict Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the conflict resolution mechanism to incorporate a proactive queuing system that learns mutation patterns and *predicts* potential conflicts *before* they occur, enabling pre-emptive resolution or intelligent queuing strategies.

**Specification:**

**I. System Architecture:**

1.  **Mutation Queue:** A distributed, in-memory queue (Redis, Memcached) associated with each data proxy instance. Mutations are initially placed in this queue upon receipt from the client.
2.  **Conflict Prediction Module:** A machine learning model (trained on historical mutation data and conflict resolutions) integrated with the data proxy. This module analyzes incoming mutations and assigns a "Conflict Probability Score" based on feature extraction (e.g., mutated fields, user identity, time of day, data store state).
3.  **Priority Assignment:** Mutations are assigned a priority based on the Conflict Probability Score. Higher scores indicate a greater likelihood of conflict and therefore higher priority.
4.  **Intelligent Dispatcher:**  A component that controls the order in which mutations are sent to the data access resolver. It prioritizes mutations based on the assigned priority and dynamically adjusts the dispatch rate to prevent overload and minimize conflict occurrence.
5.  **Conflict Resolution History Database:** A persistent database (PostgreSQL, Cassandra) to store detailed information about each conflict: mutation details, conflict type, resolution method, and associated metadata.  This database serves as the training data for the Conflict Prediction Module.
6.  **Adaptive Learning Loop:** The system continuously retrains the Conflict Prediction Module using the Conflict Resolution History Database, improving prediction accuracy over time.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  Client sends mutation to data proxy.
2.  Data proxy receives mutation and places it in the Mutation Queue.
3.  Conflict Prediction Module analyzes the mutation and calculates the Conflict Probability Score.
4.  Data proxy assigns a priority to the mutation based on the Conflict Probability Score.
5.  Intelligent Dispatcher selects the next mutation to send to the data access resolver based on priority and system load.
6.  Data access resolver processes the mutation.
7.  If a conflict occurs, the existing conflict resolution functions are invoked.
8.  Conflict details are stored in the Conflict Resolution History Database.
9.  Adaptive Learning Loop retrains the Conflict Prediction Module using the latest data.

**III. Pseudocode (Intelligent Dispatcher):**

```
function dispatch_mutation(mutation_queue):
  while mutation_queue is not empty:
    mutation = mutation_queue.peek()  // Get mutation with highest priority
    system_load = calculate_system_load() // Assess current system load

    if system_load < threshold:
      mutation = mutation_queue.dequeue()
      send_mutation_to_resolver(mutation)
    else:
      // Implement backoff strategy or adjust dispatch rate
      wait(backoff_time)

function calculate_system_load():
  // Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
  // Return a normalized load value (0-1)

function send_mutation_to_resolver(mutation):
  // Send mutation to data access resolver
  // Log processing time and success/failure status
```

**IV.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Collaborative Filtering:** Leverage data from multiple data proxies to improve conflict prediction accuracy.
*   **Simulated Conflict Resolution:**  Before sending a mutation, simulate the potential conflict resolution process to estimate the impact and optimize the resolution strategy.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  Adjust the dispatch threshold based on real-time system performance and historical data.
*   **Pre-emptive Data Locking:**  If a high probability of conflict is predicted, attempt to acquire a lock on the affected data before sending the mutation.
*   **"Shadow Writes"**: For low priority mutations, perform a "shadow write" to a staging area to assess potential conflicts without impacting live data.
