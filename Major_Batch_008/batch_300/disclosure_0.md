## Dynamic Stowage "Neighborhoods" & Predictive Relocation

**Concept:** Expand the system beyond individual bin compatibility to create dynamic "stowage neighborhoods" based on co-occurrence data *and* predictively relocate items to optimize future picking efficiency.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Neighborhood Formation:**

1.  **Co-occurrence Matrix:** Continuously log every instance of items being picked *together* within a defined time window (e.g., all items in a single order, items picked within 5 minutes of each other). This creates a weighted co-occurrence matrix indicating item affinities.
2.  **Neighborhood Assignment:**  Utilize a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) on the co-occurrence matrix. Each cluster represents a "stowage neighborhood."  Items within a neighborhood are those frequently picked together.
3.  **Physical Neighborhood Mapping:**  Assign each neighborhood to a defined physical area within the storage facility.  The algorithm should consider facility layout, picking path optimization, and available space.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system *continuously* recalculates the co-occurrence matrix and adjusts neighborhood assignments based on real-time picking data.  This ensures that neighborhoods reflect current demand patterns.

**II. Predictive Relocation Algorithm:**

1.  **Demand Forecasting:** Integrate with demand forecasting systems to predict future picking volumes for each item.
2.  **Relocation Score:** Calculate a "relocation score" for each item based on:
    *   **Demand Change:**  The predicted change in picking volume.
    *   **Neighborhood Affinity:** How strongly the item is associated with its current neighborhood.
    *   **Proximity Cost:** The cost of moving the item (distance, time, energy).
    *   **Picking Path Impact:** A simulation of how relocation would impact overall picking path length.
3.  **Automated Relocation:** Based on pre-defined thresholds, automatically trigger relocation requests for items with high relocation scores. Utilize robotic systems for execution.
4.  **"Shadow Stows":**  Before physically moving an item, temporarily “shadow stow” it in the destination bin in the system. Monitor picking performance of the shadowed stow to validate the relocation decision *before* executing the move.

**III. System Integration:**

1.  **Enhanced Scanning Device:** Integrate with the existing scanning devices to capture not just item ID, but also pick timestamps and order information.
2.  **Centralized Optimization Engine:**  Develop a centralized engine that runs the co-occurrence matrix calculation, neighborhood assignment, relocation score calculation, and robotic task scheduling.
3.  **Real-time Visualization:**  Provide a real-time visualization dashboard displaying neighborhood assignments, relocation scores, and system performance metrics.
4.  **Robotics API:** Develop a robust API to communicate with robotic systems responsible for item relocation.

**Pseudocode (Relocation Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateRelocationScore(item, currentNeighborhood, destinationNeighborhood):

  demandChange = predictDemandChange(item)
  neighborhoodAffinity = calculateNeighborhoodAffinity(item, currentNeighborhood, destinationNeighborhood)
  proximityCost = calculateProximityCost(item, currentNeighborhood, destinationNeighborhood)
  pickingPathImpact = simulatePickingPathImpact(item, currentNeighborhood, destinationNeighborhood)

  relocationScore = (demandChange * weightDemand) + (neighborhoodAffinity * weightAffinity) - (proximityCost * weightCost) + (pickingPathImpact * weightImpact)

  return relocationScore
```
