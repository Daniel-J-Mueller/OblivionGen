## Dynamic Query Partitioning via Quantile-Driven Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Leverage approximate quantile summaries not just for cardinality *estimation*, but for *dynamic partitioning* of queries across heterogeneous compute resources. The existing patent focuses on informing query plan selection; this expands it to actively shaping *where* the query executes, adapting to real-time resource availability and cost.

**Specification:**

1.  **Resource Pool Definition:** Define a heterogeneous pool of compute resources (CPUs, GPUs, specialized hardware) with associated cost metrics (per hour, per operation) and performance characteristics (e.g., throughput, latency).  Each resource will be tagged with performance profiles related to different types of query operations (e.g., filtering, aggregation, joins).

2.  **Quantile-Based Operation Weighting:**  Extend the approximate quantile summary to include not just value distributions, but also estimated operational 'weighting'.  For example, if a quantile represents the bottom 25% of values for a column, and analysis shows that filtering on that range consistently requires 60% of CPU and 40% of GPU, this is stored alongside the quantile boundaries.

3.  **Query Decomposition Engine:**  A component that decomposes incoming queries into sub-queries based on quantile ranges.  For example, a query `WHERE column > 10` might be split into:
    *   Sub-query 1: `WHERE column <= Q1` (Q1 is the 25th percentile)
    *   Sub-query 2: `WHERE Q1 < column <= Q2`
    *   Sub-query 3: `WHERE column > Q2`

4.  **Resource Allocation Algorithm:**
    ```pseudocode
    function allocate_resources(query_subqueries, resource_pool, quantile_profiles):
        for subquery in query_subqueries:
            best_resource = null
            min_cost = infinity
            for resource in resource_pool:
                cost = estimate_cost(subquery, resource, quantile_profiles)
                if cost < min_cost:
                    min_cost = cost
                    best_resource = resource
            assign subquery to best_resource
        return resource_assignments
    ```

5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Monitor query performance on assigned resources. If actual performance deviates significantly from estimates, re-evaluate resource assignments *during* query execution. This requires a mechanism to migrate sub-queries between resources with minimal disruption.

6.  **Cost Model:**  The `estimate_cost` function within the resource allocation algorithm will consider:
    *   Sub-query cardinality (derived from quantile summaries).
    *   Resource cost per operation.
    *   Resource performance profile for the types of operations within the sub-query (filtering, aggregation, joins).
    *   Data transfer costs between resources (if any).

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simple query plan optimization by adding a layer of *physical* optimization â€“ actively choosing *where* to run different parts of the query to minimize cost and maximize performance.  It utilizes the existing quantile summaries not just for estimation but as a core driver of resource allocation logic.  The dynamic adjustment component allows the system to adapt to changing resource availability and query characteristics in real-time.
