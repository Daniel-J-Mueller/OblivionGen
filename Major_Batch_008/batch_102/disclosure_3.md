## Dynamic Narrative Weaving with Generative AI

**Concept:** Extend the real-time video exploration (RVE) system to dynamically alter the narrative *within* the generated virtual world based on user interaction *and* external data feeds. Instead of solely manipulating objects or opening doors, the system becomes a collaborative storytelling engine.

**Specifications:**

**1. Narrative Database & AI Director:**

*   **Narrative Fragments:** A database of short, pre-written narrative fragments (sentences, paragraphs, dialogues) categorized by themes, emotional tone, and potential branching points.  These are not full stories, but building blocks.
*   **AI Director Module:** A core AI module responsible for selecting and weaving together narrative fragments based on:
    *   **User Interaction:**  What the user is doing in the RVE environment (e.g., examining an object, moving to a location, interacting with a virtual character).
    *   **External Data Feeds:** Real-world data streams (news, weather, social media trends – configurable), treated as “environmental factors” influencing the narrative.
    *   **World State:** A representation of the current state of the virtual world (object positions, character relationships, past user actions).
*   **Branching Logic:** The AI Director doesn't follow a pre-defined story; it *creates* the story on the fly. Each narrative fragment selection presents multiple branching possibilities, influencing the subsequent fragment choice.

**2. Implementation Details:**

*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration:**  The selected narrative fragments are converted to speech and delivered to the user via in-world characters or an ambient narrator.  Multiple voices should be available.
*   **Visual Cue Generation:**  The AI Director also triggers visual cues within the environment to reinforce the narrative (e.g., a flickering light, a change in weather, the appearance of a new object).
*   **Dynamic Character Behavior:**  The AI Director can modify the behavior of virtual characters to reflect the evolving narrative.
*   **User Agency:**  Provide the user with limited agency over the narrative direction.  For example, offering multiple dialogue options that steer the AI Director toward different branches.

**3. Pseudocode (AI Director Module):**

```
function SelectNarrativeFragment(user_action, external_data, world_state):
  // 1. Filter potential fragments based on current context
  potential_fragments = FilterFragments(user_action, external_data, world_state)

  // 2. Evaluate fragments based on relevance, emotional tone, and branching potential
  scored_fragments = ScoreFragments(potential_fragments)

  // 3. Select the highest-scoring fragment
  selected_fragment = ChooseFragment(scored_fragments)

  // 4. Update world state based on the selected fragment
  UpdateWorldState(selected_fragment)

  // 5. Generate visual cues and character actions
  GenerateCues(selected_fragment)

  return selected_fragment
```

**4. Example Scenario:**

User is exploring a virtual forest.  External data feed indicates a sudden drop in temperature and a high probability of rain.  The AI Director selects a fragment describing a growing sense of unease and the sound of distant thunder.  A visual cue shows the sky darkening and leaves beginning to fall. A virtual character warns the user about an approaching storm.  The user can choose to seek shelter or continue exploring, influencing the subsequent narrative.
