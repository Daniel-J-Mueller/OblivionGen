## Adaptive Zone Size & Motion Prediction

**Concept:** Expand upon the zone-based motion estimation by dynamically adjusting zone sizes *and* incorporating predictive modeling of camera motion to further refine stabilization and enhancement.

**Specifications:**

**I. Dynamic Zone Partitioning Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw video frames.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Scene Complexity Analysis:** Per-frame analysis to determine local scene complexity (e.g., edge density, texture variation). Utilizes a combination of Sobel edge detection, Laplacian variance calculations, and potentially a pre-trained convolutional neural network for feature extraction.
    2.  **Adaptive Grid Generation:** Based on the scene complexity analysis, generate a non-uniform grid dividing each frame into zones. High complexity areas (e.g., detailed textures, moving objects) get smaller zones. Low complexity areas (e.g., sky, solid walls) get larger zones. A minimum zone size constraint exists to prevent excessive fragmentation.  Grid is generated using a Voronoi diagram seeded with points derived from the complexity analysis (more points = smaller zones).
    3.  **Zone Adjustment Rate:**  A parameter controlling the responsiveness of zone size changes per frame.  Higher rates allow faster adaptation to dynamic scenes, but may introduce instability.
*   **Output:**  Dynamic zone map for each frame.

**II. Motion Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Inter-frame motion vectors (from standard zone-based estimation), historical motion data (past N frames), dynamic zone map.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Motion Vector Filtering:**  Apply a robust outlier rejection algorithm (e.g., RANSAC) to motion vectors *within each zone* to remove erroneous data points.
    2.  **Motion Trajectory Modeling:**  For each zone, model the motion trajectory as a polynomial function (degree adjustable) based on historical motion vectors.  Kalman filtering can be employed to smooth the trajectory and predict future motion.  Separate models for horizontal and vertical motion.
    3.  **Global Motion Refinement:**  Combine the zone-specific motion predictions with a global motion model (e.g., affine transformation) to estimate the overall camera motion.  Weight the zone contributions based on zone size and motion confidence.
*   **Output:** Predicted motion vectors for each zone, refined global motion estimation.

**III. Enhanced Stabilization & Enhancement Pipeline:**

*   **Input:** Raw video frames, predicted motion vectors, refined global motion estimation.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Motion Compensation:**  Warp frames based on the refined global motion estimation to stabilize the video.  Utilize a high-quality interpolation algorithm (e.g., bicubic spline) to minimize artifacts.
    2.  **Zone-Specific Enhancement:** Apply different enhancement algorithms to different zones based on their motion characteristics and content. For example:
        *   **High-motion zones:**  Apply deblurring and noise reduction aggressively.
        *   **Low-motion zones:**  Focus on color correction and contrast enhancement.
    3.  **Seamless Blending:** Blend the enhanced zones seamlessly to create a final stabilized and enhanced video. Utilize feathering and blending modes to minimize visible transitions.

**Pseudocode (Motion Prediction):**

```pseudocode
function predict_motion(zone_motion_history, global_motion_history):
  # Filter outlier motion vectors in zone_motion_history
  filtered_motion = remove_outliers(zone_motion_history)

  # Fit polynomial to filtered motion (horizontal & vertical)
  poly_model_x = fit_polynomial(filtered_motion.x_vectors, degree=3)
  poly_model_y = fit_polynomial(filtered_motion.y_vectors, degree=3)

  # Predict future motion using polynomial models
  predicted_motion_x = poly_model_x.predict(time=current_time + 1)
  predicted_motion_y = poly_model_y.predict(time=current_time + 1)

  # Apply Kalman Filter to smooth predictions (optional)
  smoothed_motion_x = kalman_filter(predicted_motion_x)
  smoothed_motion_y = kalman_filter(predicted_motion_y)

  return smoothed_motion_x, smoothed_motion_y
```

**Potential Improvements:**

*   Integration of deep learning for scene complexity analysis and motion prediction.
*   Adaptive selection of enhancement algorithms based on scene content.
*   Real-time implementation using GPU acceleration.
*   Support for stereoscopic video.
