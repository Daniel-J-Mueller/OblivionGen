## Adaptive RF Environment Mapping & Beamforming

**Core Concept:** Leverage the active interference cancellation (AIC) system's sensitivity to impedance changes to *map* the RF environment in real-time, building a dynamic model of reflectors and absorbers. Use this model to proactively adjust beamforming parameters *before* interference occurs, achieving significantly better signal quality and reduced power consumption.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Additions:**
    *   **High-Resolution Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) Array:** A small, integrated AoA array (4-8 elements) positioned near the WLAN/PAN antennas. This provides initial coarse-grained directionality data.
    *   **Micro-Vibration Actuators:**  Small piezoelectric actuators integrated into the antenna housing to allow minute, controlled physical adjustments to antenna orientation.
    *   **Extended Memory:**  Increased on-chip memory for storing the RF environment map.

*   **Software/Firmware Components:**

    *   **RF Environment Mapping Algorithm:**
        1.  **Initial Scan:**  Initiate a slow, sweeping scan of the AIC system’s impedance response across a defined frequency range. This establishes a baseline "RF fingerprint" of the surrounding environment.
        2.  **Impedance Delta Analysis:** Monitor continuous impedance changes detected by the power detector circuit (as in the provided patent).  Associate *any* impedance change with a potential shift in the RF environment.
        3.  **Ray Tracing Integration:** Employ a simplified ray-tracing algorithm. Incoming signals are assumed to be direct paths, reflections from major surfaces, and absorption. Each detected impedance change becomes an input to update a probabilistic RF map.
        4.  **AoA Correlation:** Correlate the impedance changes with the directionality data from the AoA array. This helps to pinpoint the *source* of the environmental shift.
        5.  **Dynamic Map Updates:** Continuously update the RF environment map with new data. The map stores information about the amplitude and phase of reflected signals.

    *   **Predictive Beamforming Algorithm:**
        1.  **Map-Based Prediction:** Utilize the RF environment map to predict potential interference sources *before* they become problematic.
        2.  **Adaptive Beam Steering:** Based on the predicted interference, dynamically adjust the beamforming weights for both the WLAN and PAN antennas. The goal is to steer the beams *away* from interference sources or to constructively combine signals to mitigate interference.
        3.  **Micro-Adjustment Feedback Loop:**  Utilize the micro-vibration actuators to make *extremely* fine adjustments to antenna orientation. These adjustments are guided by the predictive beamforming algorithm and are optimized to maximize signal quality and minimize interference. Monitor the AIC system’s performance (impedance changes) to confirm the effectiveness of the adjustments.
        4.  **Power Optimization:** Reduce transmission power when the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is high, further extending battery life.

*   **Pseudocode (Predictive Beamforming):**

    ```
    // Initialize RF Environment Map
    map = create_rf_map()

    // Main Loop
    while (true) {

        // Update RF Environment Map
        map = update_rf_map(impedance_data, aoa_data, map)

        // Predict potential interference
        predicted_interference = predict_interference(map)

        // Calculate optimal beamforming weights
        weights = calculate_beamforming_weights(predicted_interference)

        // Apply beamforming weights
        apply_beamforming_weights(weights)

        // Adjust antenna orientation (micro-vibration)
        adjust_antenna_orientation(weights)

        // Monitor AIC performance and iterate
    }
    ```

**Novelty:** This system isn’t simply canceling interference reactively. It's using the AIC system as a *sensor* to build a dynamic model of the RF environment and proactively adjust beamforming parameters *before* interference becomes a problem. The integration of micro-vibration actuators enables extremely fine-grained antenna control, maximizing performance.  It takes the 'reactive' AIC and transforms it into a 'predictive' system.
