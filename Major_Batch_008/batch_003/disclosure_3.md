## Adaptive Pixel Block Prediction & Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the idea of identifying and selectively re-encoding pixel blocks to incorporate *predictive* lossless re-encoding based on inter-frame motion *and* intra-frame correlations, propagating lossless encoding across regions exhibiting high consistency.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Motion Estimation Unit:** Standard optical flow or block-matching algorithm. Outputs motion vectors for each pixel block.  Key addition: Estimates *confidence* of the motion vector (how reliable the match is).
*   **Intra-Frame Correlation Analyzer:**  Analyzes pixel values within a block and its immediate neighbors (4 or 8 connected). Outputs a ‘consistency score’ representing the similarity within the block and its neighbors.  Uses a metric combining standard deviation of pixel values and a normalized cross-correlation score with neighboring blocks.
*   **Lossless Encoding Trigger:**  Combines the motion confidence, intra-frame consistency, and lossy/lossless flag (from the original patent) to *predict* whether a block will benefit from lossless re-encoding *before* a significant difference accumulates.
*   **Propagation Engine:** If a block is re-encoded losslessly, the Propagation Engine assesses adjacent blocks. If they meet a minimum consistency threshold with the re-encoded block *and* are currently lossy compressed, they are flagged for lossless re-encoding in subsequent frames. The “propagation distance” (how many blocks away) is configurable.
*   **Re-encoding Manager:** Handles the actual lossless re-encoding of blocks based on the triggers from the Lossless Encoding Trigger and Propagation Engine.

**II. Data Structures:**

*   `PixelBlock`: Structure containing pixel data, lossy/lossless flag, motion vector, motion confidence, consistency score, and a ‘propagation counter’ (used by the Propagation Engine).
*   `FrameBuffer`: Array of `PixelBlock` structures representing the image frame.
*   `PropagationMap`: 2D array parallel to the `FrameBuffer`, storing the ‘propagation counter’ for each block.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
FOR each PixelBlock in FrameBuffer:
    Calculate motion vector and motion confidence.
    Calculate consistency score.

    IF (PixelBlock.lossy AND (motion confidence > threshold1 AND consistency score > threshold2)) OR (PixelBlock.propagationCounter > 0):
        Re-encode PixelBlock losslessly.
        PixelBlock.lossy = FALSE
        PixelBlock.propagationCounter = 0

        // Propagate lossless encoding
        FOR each neighbor of PixelBlock:
            IF neighbor.lossy AND neighbor.consistencyScore > threshold3:
                neighbor.propagationCounter = propagationDelay
```

**IV. Parameters (Configurable):**

*   `propagationDelay`: Number of frames to delay lossless re-encoding of propagated blocks.
*   `threshold1`, `threshold2`, `threshold3`: Threshold values for motion confidence and consistency scores.
*   `propagationDistance`: Maximum number of blocks to propagate lossless encoding.

**V.  Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Dynamically adjust the thresholds based on scene complexity and frame rate.
*   **Region of Interest (ROI):** Prioritize lossless re-encoding in important areas of the image (e.g., faces).
*   **Hierarchical Propagation:**  Propagate lossless encoding at multiple scales (e.g., block level, macroblock level).
*   **Predictive Motion Vector Refinement:** Use the consistency score to refine motion vectors before estimating motion.
*   **Edge Aware Propagation:** Give preferential treatment to the propagation of lossless encoding to edges.
