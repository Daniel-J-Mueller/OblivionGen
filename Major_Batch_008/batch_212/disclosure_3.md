## Adaptive Key Derivation via Biometric Drift

**Specification:** A system that dynamically adjusts cryptographic key derivation functions (KDFs) based on biometric data drift observed during user authentication attempts.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on rate limiting cryptographic operations. This system expands on that concept by tying key strength *directly* to a continuously assessed user ‘trust’ level, derived from biometric authentication. It moves beyond simple rate limits to a more granular, real-time security posture.

**Components:**

1.  **Biometric Authentication Module:** Captures and analyzes biometric data (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint, keystroke dynamics, etc.).
2.  **Drift Detection Engine:** Monitors biometric data for deviations from a baseline established during initial enrollment. Drift is quantified as a ‘drift score’. Higher scores indicate increasing discrepancies. This uses a Kalman Filter or similar time-series analysis.
3.  **Adaptive KDF Controller:** Receives the drift score and dynamically adjusts parameters of the KDF (e.g., Argon2, scrypt, PBKDF2).  Adjustments include:
    *   **Iteration Count:**  Increases with higher drift scores, increasing computational cost.
    *   **Memory Cost:**  Increases with higher drift scores, increasing memory usage.
    *   **Parallelism:**  Adjusted to manage computational load while maintaining security.
4.  **Key Management Service:** Integrates with existing key management infrastructure to generate and distribute keys derived with the adaptive KDF.
5.  **Baseline Calibration Module:**  Establishes and periodically updates the baseline biometric profile.  This involves a moving average of successful authentication attempts.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive KDF Controller):**

```
function deriveKey(user_id, password, salt):
  drift_score = getDriftScore(user_id)
  
  if drift_score < 0.2:  // Low Drift - High Trust
    iterations = 10000
    memory_cost = 64MB
    parallelism = 4
  else if drift_score < 0.5:  // Moderate Drift - Medium Trust
    iterations = 20000
    memory_cost = 128MB
    parallelism = 8
  else:  // High Drift - Low Trust
    iterations = 50000
    memory_cost = 256MB
    parallelism = 16
    
  key = deriveKeyWithKDF(password, salt, iterations, memory_cost, parallelism)
  return key
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **User Profile:** {user\_id, baseline\_biometric\_data, drift\_score}
*   **KDF Parameters:** {iterations, memory\_cost, parallelism}

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The drift score can be a composite of multiple biometric modalities.
*   The thresholds for drift scores can be dynamically adjusted based on system-wide risk assessments.
*   Regular recalibration of baseline biometric data is crucial to maintain accuracy.
*   Consider hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs) to mitigate performance impact from increased KDF parameters.
*   The system should log all adjustments to KDF parameters for auditing and forensic analysis.

**Novelty:**  Current key derivation techniques are largely static. This system introduces a *dynamic* element, tying key strength to the *real-time* trustworthiness of the user, as assessed through biometric analysis.  It moves beyond rate limiting to a proactive security posture that adapts to changing user behavior.
