## Adaptive Network Handover via Multi-PAN & Predictive Association

**System Overview:**

A system designed to seamlessly hand over network connections for headless devices *before* signal degradation necessitates it, utilizing a combination of multiple Personal Area Networks (PANs) and predictive network association based on device movement patterns. This goes beyond simply offloading captive portal interaction – it aims for continuous, proactive network connectivity.

**Core Components:**

*   **Headless Device (HD):** The device lacking a display, initiating the process.
*   **Multi-PAN Hub (MPH):** A central device (could be integrated into a router or a dedicated unit) supporting multiple simultaneous PAN connections (Bluetooth, Zigbee, UWB). Acts as the bridge between HD and wider networks.
*   **User Device (UD):** A smartphone, tablet, or laptop used for initial setup and potentially for advanced control.
*   **Network Mapping Database (NMDB):** A cloud-based database storing information about known Wi-Fi networks (SSID, signal strength, captive portal requirements, historical usage patterns).
*   **Movement Prediction Engine (MPE):**  An AI-powered engine analyzing historical location data (from UD or HD, if GPS is available) to predict future movement and anticipate network handover needs.

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Initial Setup & Profiling:**
    *   UD establishes a Bluetooth connection with MPH.
    *   UD configures HD to connect to MPH via a preferred PAN protocol.
    *   MPH scans for available Wi-Fi networks and populates the NMDB with relevant information.
    *   MPH/MPE begins passively collecting location data (UD or HD) to establish baseline movement patterns.
2.  **Proactive Network Handover:**
    *   MPE analyzes historical movement data and predicts potential network disconnections (e.g., moving out of Wi-Fi range).
    *   Based on predicted movement, MPE queries the NMDB for suitable alternative networks.
    *   MPH proactively establishes a connection with the predicted best alternative network *before* the current connection degrades.
    *   HD’s network traffic is seamlessly migrated to the new network.  A 'soft handover' is preferred, allowing for continued connectivity.
3.  **Captive Portal Management (Enhanced):**
    *   If the new network requires captive portal interaction, MPH relays this information to UD via a secure channel.
    *   UD presents the captive portal to the user.
    *   Upon successful authentication, UD relays the credentials to MPH, which then authenticates with the new network on behalf of HD.
4.  **Dynamic PAN Protocol Selection:**
    *   MPH monitors the performance of different PAN protocols (Bluetooth, Zigbee, UWB) and dynamically switches to the optimal protocol based on signal strength, interference, and latency.
5.  **Network Quality Monitoring:**
    *   MPH continuously monitors the quality of the network connection (signal strength, latency, packet loss) and triggers a handover if the quality falls below a predefined threshold.

**Pseudocode (MPH – Core Handover Logic):**

```
loop:
    currentNetwork = getCurrentNetwork()
    predictedLocation = MPE.predictLocation()
    alternativeNetworks = NMDB.getNetworksNear(predictedLocation)
    
    if currentNetwork.signalStrength < threshold OR
       currentNetwork.latency > maxLatency:
        
        bestAlternative = selectBestNetwork(alternativeNetworks, currentNetwork)
        
        if bestAlternative != null:
            
            if bestAlternative.requiresCaptivePortal:
                requestCaptivePortalInteraction(UD)
                waitForCaptivePortalCredentials(UD)
            
            connectToNetwork(bestAlternative)
            migrateTraffic(currentNetwork, bestAlternative)
            disconnectFromNetwork(currentNetwork)
            
            currentNetwork = bestNetwork
    
    updateNetworkStatistics(currentNetwork)
    sleep(monitoringInterval)
```
