**Dynamic Subtitle Layering & Contextual Audio Cue Integration**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple subtitle activation/deactivation triggered by ambient noise. Introduce a dynamic layering system for subtitles, and integrate contextual audio cues alongside them, creating a richer, more immersive experience, particularly for complex or rapidly changing audio/visual content.

**Specs:**

*   **Subtitle Layers:** Define up to three distinct subtitle layers:
    *   *Primary Subtitles:* Standard dialogue/narrative transcription (as in the base patent).
    *   *Contextual Subtitles:* Subtitles providing additional information – sound effects descriptions (e.g., “door creaks”), music cues (“ominous violin”), or location/time stamps.
    *   *Accessibility Subtitles:*  Enhanced subtitles for visually impaired or hearing-impaired users – containing descriptive audio information and visual cues.

*   **Audio Cue Integration:** Generate short, contextual audio cues (sound effects, musical stings) synchronized with visual events *and* the displayed subtitles. These cues should be subtle but enhance understanding and immersion. (e.g., displaying “glass shatters” with a corresponding glass shattering sound).

*   **Dynamic Layer Control:** Implement an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the visibility of each subtitle layer based on:
    *   **Ambient Noise Level:** As in the base patent – higher noise activates primary subtitles.
    *   **Audio Complexity:** Analyze the audio track – a rapid sequence of sounds or overlapping dialogue activates contextual subtitles to clarify events.
    *   **Visual Complexity:** Detect rapidly changing scenes or a high density of visual elements – activating contextual subtitles to provide additional explanation.
    *   **User Preference:** Allow the user to prioritize or disable specific layers.

*   **AI-Driven Content Analysis:** Utilize AI to analyze the video and audio content to automatically identify relevant events and generate appropriate contextual subtitles and audio cues. This includes:
    *   **Sound Event Detection:** Identify specific sounds (e.g., speech, music, sound effects).
    *   **Scene Change Detection:**  Identify rapid changes in the visual scene.
    *   **Object Recognition:** Identify key objects or characters in the scene.

*   **Hardware Integration:**  Support integration with multi-channel audio systems to deliver directional audio cues synchronized with the subtitles.



**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
define SubtitleLayer: Primary, Contextual, Accessibility
define NoiseThreshold: 60dB
define ComplexityThreshold: 7 (scale 1-10)
define UserPreferences: [Layer Visibility, Volume Level]

//Main Loop
while (VideoPlaying) {

    //Sensor Data
    AmbientNoise = GetAmbientNoiseLevel()
    AudioComplexity = AnalyzeAudioComplexity()
    VisualComplexity = AnalyzeVisualComplexity()

    //User Preferences
    ApplyUserPreferences()

    //Layer Control Logic
    if (AmbientNoise > NoiseThreshold OR AudioComplexity > ComplexityThreshold OR VisualComplexity > ComplexityThreshold) {
        ShowSubtitleLayer(Primary)
        if(AudioComplexity > 7){
            ShowSubtitleLayer(Contextual)
            PlayAudioCue(AssociatedWithContextualSubtitle)
        }
        if(VisualComplexity > 7){
            ShowSubtitleLayer(Accessibility)
        }
    } else {
        HideAllSubtitleLayers()
    }
}

//AI Integration Function
function AnalyzeVideoContent(VideoFile){
    //Use AI to detect key events, objects, and sounds
    //Generate corresponding contextual subtitles and audio cues
}
