## Adaptive Data Format Negotiation with Dynamic Query Decomposition

**Concept:** Extend the system to dynamically negotiate data formats *during* query execution and decompose queries based on format compatibility. This goes beyond simply routing to a specialized engine; it proactively alters query plans based on real-time format assessment.

**Specification:**

**1. Format Probe Module:**

*   **Function:**  A module integrated into the first query engine responsible for probing the data format of both the primary database table and the nested data *before* full query plan generation. This is not a static assessment, but an active one, potentially involving sampling or metadata exchange.
*   **Input:**  Query, database table metadata, nested data location.
*   **Output:**  Confirmed data formats for both data sources, a compatibility score reflecting how easily the two formats can be joined/processed together.

**2. Dynamic Query Decomposition Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Analyzes the compatibility score. If low, decomposes the original query into a series of sub-queries, each optimized for a specific data format. This is more granular than simply delegating the nested data query.  It creates a pipeline of transformations.
*   **Input:** Original Query, Compatibility Score, Data Formats.
*   **Output:** A directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the series of sub-queries and transformations needed to produce the final result.

**3. Transformation Modules:**

*   **Function:**  A library of modules capable of converting data between various formats. These modules would be dynamically inserted into the DAG generated by the Dynamic Query Decomposition Engine.
*   **Types:**
    *   *Format Conversion:*  Transforms data from one format to another (e.g., JSON to Parquet).
    *   *Schema Mapping:*  Maps fields between different schemas.
    *   *Data Enrichment:* Adds or modifies data based on the target schema.

**4. Execution Orchestrator:**

*   **Function:**  Executes the DAG generated by the Dynamic Query Decomposition Engine. This orchestrator manages the flow of data between the various transformation modules and query engines.
*   **Features:**
    *   *Parallel Execution:* Executes independent sub-queries in parallel.
    *   *Data Buffering:* Buffers data between transformation modules to optimize performance.
    *   *Error Handling:* Handles errors that occur during query execution.

**Pseudocode for Dynamic Query Decomposition:**

```
function decomposeQuery(query, tableFormat, nestedDataFormat):
    compatibilityScore = formatProbe(tableFormat, nestedDataFormat)

    if compatibilityScore < threshold:
        // Decompose query
        dag = createDAG()
        
        // Step 1: Extract nested data
        extractNestedQuery = createQueryForNestedData(query)
        dag.addNode(extractNestedQuery)
        
        // Step 2: Transform nested data
        transformationQuery = createTransformationQuery(extractNestedQuery, tableFormat)
        dag.addNode(transformationQuery)
        dag.addEdge(extractNestedQuery, transformationQuery)
        
        // Step 3: Join transformed data with main table
        joinQuery = createJoinQuery(query, transformationQuery)
        dag.addNode(joinQuery)
        dag.addEdge(transformationQuery, joinQuery)
        
        return dag
    else:
        // Simple delegation to second query engine
        return createDelegationQuery(query)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved performance for queries involving disparate data formats.
*   Increased flexibility in handling evolving data landscapes.
*   Reduced reliance on pre-defined data pipelines.
*   Adaptability to new data formats without requiring code changes.
