## Solar-Powered, Self-Cleaning Display Cover with Dynamic Tinting

**System Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Integrated Solar Panel Array:**
    *   Type: Thin-film perovskite solar cells.
    *   Location: Embedded within the outer surface of the protective cover, maximizing surface area for light capture.
    *   Output: 5V DC, capable of powering internal components (see below) and trickle-charging a small internal battery (LiFePO4 chemistry, 1000mAh capacity).
*   **Component 2: Electrochromic Tinting Layer:**
    *   Material: Polymer-based electrochromic material, allowing for adjustable opacity.
    *   Control: Governed by an internal microcontroller (ESP32-S3) which receives data from ambient light sensors (see Component 4) and user input (via a wireless connection).
    *   Function: Dynamically adjust display visibility based on sunlight intensity and user preference. Reduces glare, improves contrast, and minimizes heat absorption.
*   **Component 3: Micro-Fluidic Self-Cleaning System:**
    *   Reservoir: Small internal reservoir holding distilled water with a trace amount of surfactant. Replenished via a sealed access port.
    *   Nozzles: Array of micro-nozzles embedded within the inner surface of the cover, directed towards the display.
    *   Pump: Miniature peristaltic pump controlled by the microcontroller.
    *   Operation: Activated on a timed schedule or triggered by dust/debris detection (see Component 4). The pump distributes a fine mist of cleaning solution across the display surface, then retracts and uses a squeegee mechanism to remove excess fluid.
*   **Component 4: Sensor Suite:**
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: Measures external light intensity to adjust electrochromic tinting and trigger cleaning cycles.
    *   Dust/Debris Sensor: Optical sensor to detect particulate matter on the display surface, initiating cleaning.
    *   Temperature Sensor: Monitors display temperature to prevent overheating and adjust cleaning frequency.
    *   Proximity Sensor: Detects user presence to activate the display and adjust tinting.
*   **Component 5: Wireless Communication Module:**
    *   Protocol: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
    *   Function: Allows users to control tinting levels, cleaning schedules, and receive system status updates via a smartphone app.
*    **Component 6: Haptic Feedback System**
    *   Miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) embedded within the cover.
    *   Function: Provides tactile feedback to the user indicating cleaning cycle start/stop, low reservoir alerts, or system errors.
*   **Component 7: Cover Actuation**
    *   Linear actuators, controlled by the microcontroller.
    *   Function: Smoothly move the cover between open and closed positions, ensuring gentle contact with the display.
