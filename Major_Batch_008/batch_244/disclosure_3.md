## Dynamic Schema Projection & Materialized Views for Federated NoSQL

**Specification:** A system enabling clients to request specific data projections from federated NoSQL sources, materialized into distributed, dynamically-sized views optimized for read-only access. This differs from the existing patent by focusing on *client-defined projections* and *dynamic materialization* rather than simply presenting an existing schema.

**Core Components:**

*   **Projection Definition Language (PDL):** A declarative language allowing clients to specify the desired data fields, transformations (e.g., filtering, aggregation), and relationships across multiple NoSQL data sources. PDL would be JSON-based for ease of use and parsing.
*   **Projection Compiler:** Transforms PDL into an execution plan optimized for the underlying NoSQL data sources. This compilation step incorporates cost analysis, considering data source capabilities, network latency, and estimated data volumes.
*   **Materialization Engine:** Responsible for executing the compiled projection plan, extracting data from the NoSQL sources, and storing the results in a distributed, in-memory cache.
*   **Dynamic View Manager:** Monitors client access patterns and dynamically adjusts the size and distribution of the materialized views to optimize performance. This includes splitting, merging, and replicating views as needed.
*   **SQL Gateway (Optional):**  Provides a SQL interface to access the materialized views. Translation of SQL queries to optimized access paths within the materialized view layer.

**Data Flow:**

1.  Client submits a PDL projection definition.
2.  Projection Compiler generates an optimized execution plan.
3.  Materialization Engine executes the plan and populates the distributed cache with the materialized view.
4.  Client queries the materialized view via a dedicated API or SQL Gateway.
5.  Dynamic View Manager monitors access patterns and adjusts the view's size/distribution accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic View Manager):**

```
function monitor_access_patterns(view_id, access_log) {
  // Analyze access log for frequently accessed data subsets
  frequent_subsets = identify_frequent_subsets(access_log);

  // If frequent subsets exist and are significantly smaller than the total view size:
  if (frequent_subsets.size > 0 && frequent_subsets.size < view_size * threshold) {
    split_view(view_id, frequent_subsets);  // Create new, smaller views for each subset
  } else if (view_access_count < threshold) {
    // If view is infrequently accessed, shrink or delete
    shrink_view(view_id);
  }
}

function split_view(view_id, subsets) {
  // Create new views for each subset
  for (subset in subsets) {
    create_view(subset, view_id); //Associate new view with original
  }
}

function create_view(subset, original_view_id) {
  //Extract data from original view according to subset criteria
  //Store in new in-memory cache instance
  //Register new view with access API.
}
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Client-Driven Schema:** The schema isn't pre-defined, but dynamically constructed based on client requests.
*   **Dynamic Materialization:** Materialized views are created and adjusted on-demand, minimizing resource consumption.
*   **Granular Caching:** Enables fine-grained caching of specific data projections, optimized for read-only workloads.
*   **Federated NoSQL Support:** Designed to work seamlessly with diverse NoSQL data sources.
*   **Reduced Latency:** By pre-computing and caching specific data projections, read latency is significantly reduced.
