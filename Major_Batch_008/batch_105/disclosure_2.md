## Dynamic Parameter Scaling for Predictive Caching

**Concept:** Extend the normalization concept to *proactively* influence service responses beyond simply retrieving more detailed data. Instead of just modifying parameters to *get* more information, dynamically scale parameters based on predicted future requests to *shape* the response and maximize cache utility. This is intended to allow caching of a broader range of 'derived' results.

**Specs:**

1.  **Request Interception Module:**
    *   Function: Intercept incoming requests *before* they reach the service.
    *   Input: Raw request with all parameters.
    *   Output: Modified request with dynamically adjusted parameters.
    *   Logic: Utilizes a predictive model (see #3) to forecast potential future requests.  Based on these forecasts, parameters of the current request are adjusted to nudge the service towards generating a response that will be useful for multiple future requests.

2.  **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Raw request, predictive model output (forecasted requests), cache hit rate metrics.
    *   Output: Modified request.
    *   Logic:
        *   Identify parameters that, when varied, significantly impact the service's response.
        *   Calculate the potential benefit (increased cache hits) of scaling these parameters in specific directions.
        *   Scale the parameters to maximize potential cache hits, while adhering to pre-defined constraints (e.g., parameter must remain within a reasonable range).
        *   Example: If the service calculates a tax amount based on price and quantity, and the predictive model indicates a high probability of subsequent requests with similar prices but varying quantities, the algorithm might slightly *increase* the price in the current request to generate a more precise (and therefore cacheable) tax rate that can be applied to a wider range of quantities.

3.  **Predictive Model:**
    *   Type: Machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, long short-term memory network)
    *   Training Data: Historical request logs, service response logs, contextual data (e.g., time of day, user location).
    *   Output: Probability distribution over future requests, identifying likely parameter values.
    *   Function: Predicts the distribution of parameters in future requests based on current and historical data.

4.  **Cache Key Generation:**
    *   Logic: The cache key is generated from the *modified* request parameters, *not* the original request parameters. This ensures that the cache is populated with responses to the normalized requests.

5.  **Response Normalization/Denormalization Module:**
    *   Function: Handle any necessary adjustments to the service's response to account for the parameter modifications.
    *   Example: If the price parameter was increased in the request, the tax amount in the response may need to be scaled down to reflect the original price.

6.  **A/B Testing & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Implementation: Continuously A/B test different parameter adjustment algorithms and predictive models to optimize cache hit rates and overall system performance.
    *   Metrics: Cache hit rate, response time, service load.
    *   Algorithm: Utilize reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the parameter adjustment algorithms based on performance feedback.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Parameter Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_parameters(request, predictive_model, cache_hit_rate_metrics):
  modified_request = request.copy()
  
  forecasted_requests = predictive_model.predict(request)
  
  for parameter in request.parameters:
    potential_benefits = calculate_cache_hit_benefit(parameter, forecasted_requests, cache_hit_rate_metrics)
    
    if potential_benefits > threshold:
      modified_request.set_parameter(parameter, calculate_optimal_value(parameter, forecasted_requests))
  
  return modified_request
```
