## Dynamic Mirror Array for Volumetric Displays

**Concept:** Extend the micro-mirror array concept into three dimensions to create true volumetric displays, moving beyond the limitations of 2D projection onto a surface.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Architecture:** A cubic lattice of independently controlled micro-mirrors. Each mirror is a MEMS-fabricated convex micro-mirror, similar to those described in the reference patent, but with full 6-degrees-of-freedom control (tilt, roll, and positional adjustment along x, y, and z axes).
*   **Mirror Dimensions:** 200μm diameter, 50μm thickness. Mirror pitch (distance between mirror centers) is 400μm.
*   **Array Size:** Initial prototype: 64x64x64 mirrors (4cm x 4cm x 4cm volume). Scalable to larger dimensions (e.g. 256x256x256) with appropriate control electronics.
*   **Light Source:** High-brightness, narrow-beam laser diodes (RGB) coupled to fiber optics. Each laser is dedicated to a specific color channel.
*   **Control System:** A distributed network of microcontrollers, each responsible for controlling a subset of the mirrors. Communication via a high-speed serial interface.
*   **Rendering Engine:** A software pipeline that converts 3D models into a mirror control map.  The map specifies the tilt, roll, and position of each mirror to create the desired image. Algorithm prioritizes specular reflection for bright, sharp image points.
*   **Power:** Each mirror requires individual addressing and control. Low-power MEMS technology is crucial. Individual mirror power consumption < 10mW.
*   **Material:** Mirrors constructed from silicon or other MEMS-compatible materials. Substrate material selected for thermal stability and compatibility with MEMS fabrication processes.

**Pseudocode (Rendering Pipeline):**

```
function render_frame(3D_model, viewpoint):
    # Step 1: Ray Tracing
    rays = trace_rays(3D_model, viewpoint)

    # Step 2: Intersection with Mirror Array
    mirror_hits = []
    for ray in rays:
        hit = find_closest_mirror_intersection(ray, mirror_array)
        if hit:
            mirror_hits.append(hit)

    # Step 3: Mirror Control Map Generation
    control_map = {}
    for hit in mirror_hits:
        mirror_id = hit.mirror_id
        # Calculate tilt and roll angles to reflect ray towards viewer
        tilt_angle, roll_angle = calculate_angles(hit.ray_direction, hit.mirror_normal)
        control_map[mirror_id] = (tilt_angle, roll_angle)

    # Step 4: Send Control Map to Mirror Array Controller
    send_control_map(control_map)
```

**Innovation:** Unlike existing displays that project light *onto* a surface, this system *creates* the image in space by manipulating the reflection of light from individual mirrors. The volumetric nature of the display eliminates parallax and allows for viewing from any angle. The combination of precise mirror control and high-brightness light sources will result in a stunningly realistic and immersive visual experience. The hexagonal arrangement described in the reference patent continues to be utilized, but in all three dimensions.
