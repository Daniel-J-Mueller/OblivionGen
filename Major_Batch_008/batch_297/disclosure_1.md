## Dynamic Subgraph Merging & Speculative Execution

**Concept:** Extend static allocation by incorporating runtime merging of subgraphs based on data dependencies and predicted execution paths. This allows for more granular resource utilization and potential performance gains through speculative execution.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Dependency Graph Construction:**

*   **Input:** Neural network graph (layers & operations), current input tensor data.
*   **Process:** Analyze input data to identify potential data dependencies between subgraphs. Specifically, identify scenarios where the output of one subgraph can directly feed into another, even if not explicitly defined in the original network graph.
*   **Output:** Dependency Graph – a data structure representing potential data flows *between* statically allocated subgraphs. Nodes represent subgraphs, edges represent data dependency likelihood (scored based on input data characteristics).

**2. Speculative Subgraph Merger:**

*   **Input:** Dependency Graph, current resource availability (cache space, processing unit load), a “merge threshold” (configurable parameter balancing resource usage vs. potential gain).
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify subgraph pairs with high dependency scores (above the merge threshold).
    *   Assess the feasibility of merging these subgraphs without exceeding resource limitations. Consider:
        *   Cache capacity – can the combined weights and intermediate data fit?
        *   Processing unit availability – is there a unit capable of handling the combined workload?
    *   If feasible, *speculatively* merge the subgraphs’ execution plans. This involves:
        *   Rewriting the execution graph to treat the merged subgraphs as a single unit.
        *   Allocating the necessary resources (cache space, processing unit).
*   **Output:** Modified Execution Graph (potentially with merged subgraphs), Resource Allocation Map.

**3. Dynamic Execution & Rollback:**

*   **Input:** Modified Execution Graph, Input Tensor Data.
*   **Process:** Execute the network according to the modified graph. Monitor execution for any discrepancies or errors caused by the speculative merge.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If an error is detected (e.g., incorrect output due to the merge), immediately revert to the original execution plan (unmerge the subgraphs) and resume execution from the point of divergence. This requires maintaining a snapshot of the original execution state.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Track the success rate of speculative merges. Adjust the merge threshold dynamically based on observed performance.

**4. Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Cache Partitioning:** Implement flexible cache partitioning to allow dynamic allocation of space for merged subgraphs.
*   **Fast Context Switching:** Support rapid context switching between the original and merged execution plans for rollback.
*   **Resource Monitoring:**  Provide hardware-level resource monitoring capabilities to track cache usage, processing unit load, and execution performance.

**Pseudocode (Speculative Subgraph Merger):**

```
function mergeSubgraphs(dependencyGraph, resourceAvailability, mergeThreshold):
  for each subgraphPair in dependencyGraph:
    if subgraphPair.dependencyScore > mergeThreshold:
      if canMerge(subgraphPair, resourceAvailability):
        mergeSubgraphPair(subgraphPair)
        updateExecutionGraph(subgraphPair)
        updateResourceAllocation(subgraphPair)
      else:
        // Log resource conflict - consider adjusting merge threshold
        continue
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond static allocation by introducing a runtime adaptation layer. While static allocation optimizes for known configurations, this system *learns* to dynamically adjust execution plans based on data characteristics, potentially unlocking significant performance gains through opportunistic merging and speculative execution. The rollback mechanism ensures that speculative merges don't compromise overall system stability.
