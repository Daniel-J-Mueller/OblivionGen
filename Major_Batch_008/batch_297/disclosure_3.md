## Secure Resource Orchestration via Decentralized Identity & Action Tokens

**System Overview:** A system augmenting the core patent's functionality by incorporating a decentralized identity (DID) layer and action tokens to facilitate granular control and auditable resource generation within a secured network. This moves beyond simple approval/rejection to a system of verifiable credentials and delegated action authority.

**Core Components:**

*   **Decentralized Identity (DID) Provider:** A service (potentially blockchain-based) for issuing and managing DIDs for both external users and internal cleared users.
*   **Verifiable Credential (VC) Issuer:**  A component issuing VCs attesting to the external user's authorization level (e.g., "Allowed to Request Report Generation", "Approved for Data Access - Tier 2").
*   **Action Token Generator:** Creates unique, digitally signed tokens representing specific, permitted actions. Tokens contain metadata like resource type, data access limits, execution time window, and associated VC requirements.
*   **Secure Gateway:** The interface between the external network and the secured network. Validates presented VCs and action tokens before forwarding requests.
*   **Internal Resource Orchestrator:** A component within the secured network responsible for executing approved actions based on token parameters.  Logs all actions and results securely.

**Workflow:**

1.  **External User Request:** The user initiates a resource generation request, specifying desired actions.  Instead of a resource *file*, the request includes a DID and potentially relevant VCs.
2.  **Token Generation & Request Packaging:**  The system analyzes the request and user's VCs. Based on these, it generates a set of *action tokens* corresponding to the requested actions, incorporating appropriate security constraints.  These tokens, along with the original request, are packaged.
3.  **Secure Gateway Validation:** The packaged request arrives at the Secure Gateway. The Gateway verifies the user’s DID, confirms the validity of the presented VCs, and *cryptographically validates each action token*. Invalid tokens result in immediate rejection.
4.  **Internal Orchestration:** Validated requests and tokens are forwarded to the Internal Resource Orchestrator. The Orchestrator executes actions based on the token parameters.  Critically, the Orchestrator *does not rely on a cleared user’s manual approval*.  The tokens themselves authorize the actions.
5.  **Auditing & Results:** All executed actions and their results are logged, linked to the user's DID and the associated tokens, creating a fully auditable trail. Results are packaged and returned to the external user.

**Pseudocode (Secure Gateway - Token Validation):**

```
function validate_token(token, user_did):
  try:
    signature = token.signature
    payload = token.payload
    public_key = get_public_key_from_did(user_did)
    is_valid = verify_signature(payload, signature, public_key)

    if not is_valid:
      log("Invalid signature for token")
      return false

    # Check if token is expired
    if token.expiry_timestamp < current_timestamp:
        log("Token has expired")
        return false
    
    # Additional checks based on token payload (e.g., resource limits)
    if token.resource_type != allowed_resource_type:
        log("Invalid Resource Type")
        return false
    
    return true
  except Exception as e:
    log("Token validation error: " + str(e))
    return false
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond basic approval/rejection to a proactive, policy-driven approach using verifiable credentials and action tokens.  It minimizes manual intervention, enhances security through cryptographic validation, and provides a robust audit trail for compliance and accountability.  The focus is on *delegating authority* via tokens rather than requiring constant human oversight. This could enable significantly more complex and automated resource generation workflows.
