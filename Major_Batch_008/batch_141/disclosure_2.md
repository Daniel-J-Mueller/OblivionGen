## Adaptive Haptic Network Profiles

**Concept:** Extend user experience indicators beyond visual and auditory cues to incorporate nuanced haptic feedback, personalized based on application usage *and* predicted user activity. This moves beyond simply indicating network quality; it proactively shapes the user's tactile perception of connectivity.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Engine Integration:** Device must include a high-fidelity haptic engine capable of generating complex patterns (texture simulation, localized vibrations, force feedback).
*   **Network Performance Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of key network metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss, bandwidth) – similar to the provided patent, but extended.
*   **Application-Specific Profiles:** A library of pre-defined haptic profiles associated with common applications (streaming video, online gaming, video conferencing, web browsing). These profiles dictate the *type* of haptic feedback delivered.
*   **Predictive Analytics Module:** A machine learning model trained on user behavior (time of day, location, app usage history, calendar events) to *predict* upcoming network demands.
*   **Dynamic Profile Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts the haptic profile based on *both* current network conditions *and* predicted user activity.
*   **Haptic “Layers”:** Multiple haptic layers to convey different types of information:
    *   **Base Layer:** A subtle, constant texture indicating overall network connection.
    *   **Performance Layer:** Variations in intensity/frequency to reflect network performance (e.g., increasing vibration with increasing latency).
    *   **Predictive Layer:** Pre-emptive haptic cues signaling anticipated network changes (e.g., a brief pulse before a video call starts to indicate bandwidth allocation).
*   **User Customization:** Users can adjust the intensity and type of haptic feedback, or create custom profiles.
*   **API for Developers:** An API allowing developers to integrate application-specific haptic feedback into their apps.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (device is on) {
  networkMetrics = getNetworkMetrics()
  userActivity = getUserActivity()
  predictedActivity = predictUserActivity(userActivity)

  // Determine optimal haptic profile
  hapticProfile = selectHapticProfile(networkMetrics, predictedActivity, currentApp)

  // Apply haptic feedback
  applyHapticFeedback(hapticProfile)
}

// Function: selectHapticProfile
function selectHapticProfile(networkMetrics, predictedActivity, currentApp) {
  if (currentApp == "Video Streaming") {
    if (networkMetrics.latency > threshold) {
      return "BufferingTexture"  // Simulate a texture like static
    } else {
      return "SmoothFlow"       // Constant gentle vibration
    }
  } else if (predictedActivity == "IncomingCall") {
    return "RingPulse"          // Short, repeating pulse
  } else {
    // Default: Basic connection feedback
    return "StableGrip"
  }
}
```

**Example Scenarios:**

*   **Gaming:** High latency triggers a more textured, “rough” vibration, providing tactile feedback about lag.
*   **Video Conferencing:** Predictive layer provides a subtle pulse before a call, preparing the user for increased bandwidth usage.
*   **Streaming Video:** Fluctuating network quality translates to changing haptic intensity, alerting the user to potential buffering.
*   **Web Browsing:** A constant, subtle "grip" vibration indicates a stable connection, while interruptions signal network issues.
