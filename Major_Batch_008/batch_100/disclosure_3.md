## Adaptive Simulation Fidelity Based on Code Coverage Hotspots

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** “Fidelity Manager” – A module integrated into the existing simulation environment.
*   **Input:** Code coverage data generated by the system (as per the patent), simulation runtime parameters (CPU/GPU load, memory usage), and a “fidelity budget” (configurable resource allocation for simulation detail).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `CoverageMap`: A hierarchical map of code coverage data, linking source code elements (functions, lines, branches) to simulation entities (objects, processes, environmental factors).  Stores coverage percentages and “hotspot” identifiers.
    *   `FidelityProfile`: Defines the level of detail for specific simulation entities.  Values represent complexity levels (e.g., low, medium, high) impacting computational cost.  Includes parameters like polygon count, physics engine accuracy, AI complexity, sensor fidelity.
    *   `HotspotList`:  A prioritized list of code sections with low coverage (identified by the Fidelity Manager).

**Process:**

1.  **Coverage Analysis:** At runtime, the Fidelity Manager continuously monitors code coverage data.
2.  **Hotspot Identification:**  The system identifies “hotspots” – code sections with coverage below a predefined threshold. The threshold is configurable and can be dynamically adjusted based on the fidelity budget.  Hotspot severity is weighted by the criticality of the code (defined a priori or learned through simulation data).
3.  **Fidelity Adjustment:** Based on the hotspot list and fidelity budget, the Fidelity Manager dynamically adjusts the fidelity of related simulation entities.
    *   **Increase Fidelity:** If a hotspot relates to a critical simulation entity, the system *increases* fidelity (e.g., more detailed modeling of aerodynamics, higher-resolution textures, more complex AI behavior).
    *   **Decrease Fidelity:** If a hotspot relates to a non-critical entity, the system *decreases* fidelity (e.g., simplified physics, lower polygon counts, basic AI).
4.  **Resource Balancing:** The Fidelity Manager continuously monitors resource usage (CPU, GPU, memory). If resource limits are approached, the system further adjusts fidelity levels to maintain simulation stability.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The simulation generates new code coverage data, which is fed back into the Fidelity Manager, creating a continuous optimization loop.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
CoverageMap = initializeCoverageMap(sourceCode)
FidelityProfile = initializeFidelityProfile(defaultFidelity)
HotspotList = []
fidelityBudget = getConfigurableFidelityBudget()

//Main Simulation Loop
while (simulationRunning) {
    //1. Obtain code coverage data
    coverageData = getCodeCoverageData()
    updateCoverageMap(coverageData, CoverageMap)

    //2. Identify Hotspots
    HotspotList = identifyHotspots(CoverageMap, coverageThreshold)

    //3. Adjust Fidelity
    adjustFidelity(HotspotList, FidelityProfile, fidelityBudget)

    //4. Apply Fidelity Profile to Simulation
    applyFidelityProfile(FidelityProfile, simulationEnvironment)

    //5. Monitor Resources
    resourceUsage = monitorResourceUsage()

    //6. Adjust Fidelity based on Resources (if needed)
    if (resourceUsage > maxResourceUsage) {
        reduceFidelityForCriticality(HotspotList, resourceUsage)
    }

}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing simulation platform with code coverage instrumentation (as described in the patent).
*   Sufficient processing power (CPU/GPU) to handle dynamic fidelity adjustments.
*   Sufficient memory to store code coverage data and fidelity profiles.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Autonomous vehicle testing (prioritize coverage of critical driving scenarios).
*   Robotics (optimize simulation for specific robot tasks).
*   Flight simulation (focus on realistic modeling of critical flight conditions).
*   Training simulations (adapt fidelity to trainee skill level).
