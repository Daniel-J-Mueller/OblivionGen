## Dynamic Workspace Zoning with Predictive Collision Avoidance

**Concept:** Expand the time-of-flight localization system to not just react to worker presence, but *predict* worker movement and dynamically adjust workspace zones for robotic units, creating a fluid and responsive safety system.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

1.  **Enhanced Reference Radio Network:** Increase density of reference radios, focusing on high-traffic areas and potential blind spots. Radios should support both UWB and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.
2.  **Worker-Worn Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  Each worker wears a small, lightweight IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) integrated with the portable radio. This provides real-time data on worker velocity, acceleration, and orientation.
3.  **Robotic Unit Processing Unit:** Dedicated processing unit on each robotic unit capable of receiving localization data, IMU data, and executing predictive algorithms.
4.  **Workspace Mapping System:** Detailed 3D map of the workspace, including static obstacles and dynamic zones (e.g., designated walkways, loading areas).  This is maintained and updated via a central server or through robotic unit-collected data.

**II. Software & Algorithms:**

1.  **Sensor Fusion:** Algorithm to combine time-of-flight localization data with IMU data to create a highly accurate and responsive representation of worker position *and* movement. Kalman filtering or similar techniques are recommended.
2.  **Trajectory Prediction:**  Employ a short-term trajectory prediction model based on worker velocity, acceleration, and historical movement patterns. This model predicts the worker’s likely path over the next 1-3 seconds.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks could be used for complex movement patterns.
3.  **Dynamic Zone Creation:** Based on the predicted worker trajectory, the system dynamically creates “exclusion zones” around the worker, extending beyond the immediate bounding area. These zones are not fixed circles; they are elongated or shaped to reflect the predicted movement path.
4.  **Collision Probability Calculation:** Calculate the probability of collision between the robotic unit and the dynamic exclusion zone. This considers the robotic unit’s speed, trajectory, and maneuverability.
5.  **Adaptive Path Planning:** If the collision probability exceeds a threshold, the robotic unit's path planning algorithm is triggered to generate a new path that avoids the exclusion zone. This path planning can involve slowing down, stopping, or detouring around the predicted worker location.
6.  **Hierarchical Zoning:** Implement a hierarchical zoning system.
    *   *Level 1 (Immediate):* Standard circular bounding areas based on time-of-flight.  Triggers immediate slowdown or stop.
    *   *Level 2 (Predictive):* Dynamic exclusion zones based on trajectory prediction. Triggers path replanning and detour.
    *   *Level 3 (Proactive):*  System analyzes historical worker patterns and proactively adjusts robotic unit routes to minimize potential conflicts.

**III. Pseudocode (Collision Avoidance Module):**

```
// Inputs:  RoboticUnitState, WorkerState (position, velocity, acceleration), WorkspaceMap
// Outputs:  NewRoboticUnitTrajectory (if collision predicted) or RoboticUnitState

function AvoidCollision(RoboticUnitState, WorkerState, WorkspaceMap) {

    // 1. Sensor Fusion - Combine ToF and IMU data for accurate worker state
    FusedWorkerState = SensorFusion(WorkerState);

    // 2. Trajectory Prediction
    PredictedWorkerTrajectory = PredictTrajectory(FusedWorkerState);

    // 3. Calculate Dynamic Exclusion Zone
    ExclusionZone = CreateExclusionZone(PredictedWorkerTrajectory, SafetyMargin);

    // 4. Check for Collision Probability
    CollisionProbability = CalculateCollisionProbability(RoboticUnitState, ExclusionZone, WorkspaceMap);

    if (CollisionProbability > CollisionThreshold) {
        // 5. Adaptive Path Planning
        NewRoboticUnitTrajectory = PathPlanning(RoboticUnitState, ExclusionZone, WorkspaceMap);
        return NewRoboticUnitTrajectory;
    } else {
        return RoboticUnitState; // Continue on current path
    }
}
```

**IV. Communication Protocol:**

*   Robotic units and reference radios use a secure, low-latency wireless communication protocol (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4).
*   Data is transmitted in real-time to a central controller for analysis and coordination.

**V. Safety Considerations:**

*   Redundant safety systems, such as emergency stop buttons and physical barriers, should be implemented.
*   The system should be regularly tested and calibrated to ensure accuracy and reliability.
*   All workers should be trained on the proper use of the system and safety procedures.
