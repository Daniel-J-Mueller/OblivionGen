## Adaptive Network Presence Validation & Dynamic Policy Enforcement

**Concept:** Extend the network locality detection beyond simple "reachable/unreachable" to a continuous, adaptive validation of a device's *expected* network context. Instead of simply blocking access upon detecting an external connection, leverage the information to dynamically adjust security policies *before* a potential breach, and potentially offer graduated responses.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Network Context Profiler (NCP):** Runs on the internal network, passively learning expected network behavior for each device. This includes:
    *   Typical external IP addresses (if any – e.g., VPN usage).
    *   DNS resolution patterns.
    *   Communication frequency to internal and external resources.
    *   Standard ports and protocols used.
    *   Geographic location data derived from IP addresses (optional, based on policy).
    *   A ‘trust score’ is generated per device, representing the deviation from the baseline.
*   **Component 2: Real-time Deviation Analyzer (RDA):** Monitors network traffic for discrepancies from the NCP baseline. This happens *before* any access control decision is made. It analyses:
    *   Source IP address.
    *   DNS resolution (is the resolved IP address what’s expected?).
    *   Port and protocol used.
    *   Communication frequency.
    *   Geographic location (if enabled).
*   **Component 3: Dynamic Policy Engine (DPE):**  Reacts to RDA alerts based on configurable policies. Rather than a binary "block/allow", it employs graduated responses. Examples:
    *   **Low Deviation:** Log the event.
    *   **Medium Deviation:** Trigger multi-factor authentication. Require a device attestation. Initiate a passive security scan.
    *   **High Deviation:** Block access. Revoke credentials. Isolate the device.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Secure, encrypted communication channel between NCP, RDA, and DPE. Utilizes mutual authentication.

**Pseudocode (RDA):**

```
function analyzeTraffic(packet):
  device_id = extractDeviceId(packet)
  profile = getProfile(device_id) // From NCP
  
  ip_address = extractSourceIP(packet)
  dns_resolved_ip = resolveDNS(packet) // Get IP the client actually connected to

  deviation_score = 0

  if (ip_address != profile.expected_ip):
    deviation_score += 20

  if (dns_resolved_ip != profile.expected_dns_ip):
    deviation_score += 30

  if (packet.port != profile.expected_port):
    deviation_score += 10

  if (packet.frequency > profile.expected_frequency):
    deviation_score += 15

  // Add geolocation deviation if enabled

  if (deviation_score > 50):
    triggerPolicy(device_id, "HIGH_DEVIATION")
  elif (deviation_score > 20):
    triggerPolicy(device_id, "MEDIUM_DEVIATION")
  else:
    logEvent(device_id, "NORMAL_TRAFFIC")
```

**Novelty:**

The existing patent focuses on blocking access upon *detection* of an external connection. This system focuses on *predicting* deviations from expected behavior and responding *before* a potential breach, offering a more nuanced and adaptive security posture. It's about understanding the "norm" and detecting subtle anomalies, not just "internal/external" status. The graduated response system avoids unnecessarily disrupting legitimate activity.
