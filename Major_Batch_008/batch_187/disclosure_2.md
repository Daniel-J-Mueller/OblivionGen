**Automated Textile Defect Prediction & Pre-emptive Cutting Path Adjustment**

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** High-resolution multi-spectral textile imaging system (visible, near-infrared) integrated *above* the textile cutter bed.  Dedicated GPU processing unit. Robotic arm capable of minor cutter head adjustments.
*   **Software:**  AI/ML model trained on a vast dataset of textile defects (stains, weave imperfections, color variations, etc.). Real-time image processing pipeline. Path planning algorithm.  Cutter control interface.
*   **Integration:** System integrates directly with the existing image capture and cutter control systems outlined in the referenced patent.

**Functional Description:**

1.  **Pre-Cut Scan:** *Before* any cutting operations begin, the high-resolution imaging system scans the entire textile sheet.  Multi-spectral imaging captures data beyond visual appearance, identifying subtle defects invisible to the naked eye.
2.  **Defect Prediction:**  The AI/ML model analyzes the scanned image, predicting potential defect areas *before* cutting commences.  Model outputs a "defect probability map" overlaid on the textile image. This is not merely detecting *existing* defects, but *predicting* where defects are likely to emerge based on weave patterns, fiber density variations, and subtle color shifts.
3.  **Dynamic Path Adjustment:** The path planning algorithm receives the defect probability map and the intended cut paths (derived from the aggregated template). It dynamically adjusts the cut paths to *avoid* predicted defect zones. Adjustments may include:
    *   Minor re-positioning of panels.
    *   Slight rotation of panels.
    *   Implementation of "buffer zones" around predicted defects.
    *   Intelligent panel selection – if multiple panels are suitable, the algorithm prioritizes those with minimal predicted defects.
4.  **Real-Time Monitoring & Correction:** During the cutting process, the imaging system continuously monitors the cut area. If unexpected defects *emerge* or predicted defects deviate from the model's prediction, the system triggers a minor cutter head adjustment (e.g., slightly altering the angle or speed of the cut) to compensate.
5.  **Data Logging & Model Refinement:** All scan data, path adjustments, and real-time corrections are logged. This data is used to continuously retrain and refine the AI/ML model, improving its predictive accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Path Adjustment):**

```
// Input:  aggregatedTemplate, defectProbabilityMap
// Output: adjustedCutPaths

function adjustCutPaths(aggregatedTemplate, defectProbabilityMap) {
  adjustedCutPaths = aggregatedTemplate.cutPaths

  for each panel in aggregatedTemplate.panels {
    for each cutPath in panel.cutPaths {
      //Check if cut path is inside of defect zone
      if (cutPath intersects defectProbabilityMap.highProbabilityZone) {
        //Attempt to shift cut path slightly
        shiftedCutPath = shiftCutPath(cutPath, shiftDirection, shiftAmount)
        //If shift doesn’t resolve conflict, attempt rotation
        if(shiftedCutPath still intersects defectProbabilityMap.highProbabilityZone){
            rotatedCutPath = rotateCutPath(cutPath, rotationAngle)
        }
        //If still unresolved, flag for manual review
        if (rotatedCutPath still intersects defectProbabilityMap.highProbabilityZone){
            flagForManualReview(cutPath)
        } else {
            cutPath = rotatedCutPath
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return adjustedCutPaths
}
```
