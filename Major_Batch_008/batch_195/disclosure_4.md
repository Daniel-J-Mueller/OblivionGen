## Dynamic Region Generation & Predictive Subscription

**Concept:** Expand the hierarchical region system to dynamically generate regions *based on predicted traffic density* and proactively subscribe agents based on predicted trajectories. This goes beyond static regions to create a fluid, responsive airspace management system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Engine:**

*   **Input:** Real-time aerial vehicle (AV) data (position, velocity, heading, planned route), historical traffic data, weather patterns, scheduled events (e.g., concerts, sporting events), and No-Fly Zone data.
*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict AV density in various geographical areas over a defined time horizon (e.g., 15-60 minutes). Output will be a ‘Traffic Density Map’ with probabilities assigned to each grid cell.
*   **Dynamic Region Generation:** Based on the Traffic Density Map, regions are dynamically generated.  High-density areas automatically trigger the creation of smaller, more granular sub-regions. Low-density areas may be merged into larger regions, or temporarily deactivated.  Region boundaries should be irregular, conforming to the predicted density gradients rather than fixed geometrical shapes.

**2. Predictive Subscription System:**

*   **Trajectory Analysis:** Each AV's planned trajectory is analyzed.
*   **Region Prediction:** Based on the trajectory, the system predicts the regions the AV will enter over the next *x* minutes (adjustable parameter).
*   **Proactive Subscription:**  *Before* the AV enters a predicted region, it is automatically subscribed to that region’s notification list. This is in addition to existing static subscriptions.  A ‘confidence score’ is associated with the prediction; lower scores result in lower subscription priority.
*   **Dynamic Unsubscription:** When an AV exits a region, it is automatically unsubscribed.  Subscriptions also have a 'time to live', after which they expire to prevent stale data.

**3. Notification Prioritization:**

*   **Tiered System:** Notifications are assigned a priority level based on urgency and relevance.
*   **Subscription Score:** Each agent’s subscription is assigned a ‘subscription score’ based on:
    *   Confidence of trajectory prediction
    *   Agent type (e.g., emergency services receive higher priority)
    *   User-defined preferences
*   **Filtering:** Agents receive notifications based on their priority level and subscription score. Low-priority notifications are delayed or suppressed.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Central Prediction Server:**  Hosts the predictive engine and manages the Traffic Density Map.
*   **Regional Notification Managers:** Responsible for managing subscriptions and sending notifications within specific geographical areas.
*   **Agent Communication Module:** Facilitates communication between agents and the system.
*   **Data Storage:**  Stores historical traffic data, flight plans, weather information, and subscription data.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Subscription):**

```
function predict_regions(flight_plan):
  regions = []
  for segment in flight_plan:
    predicted_density = get_predicted_density(segment.location)
    if predicted_density > threshold:
      region = create_region(segment.location)
      regions.append(region)
  return regions

function subscribe_to_regions(agent, regions):
  for region in regions:
    subscribe(agent, region)

function on_flight_plan_update(agent, new_flight_plan):
  predicted_regions = predict_regions(new_flight_plan)
  subscribe_to_regions(agent, predicted_regions)
```
