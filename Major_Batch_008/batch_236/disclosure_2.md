## Dynamic Data Provenance & Predictive Conflict Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the configuration data system to not only manage update times and control actions, but also to track a detailed provenance graph of data modifications *and* proactively predict potential conflicts before they occur, offering resolution options to the user.

**Specs:**

**1. Provenance Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent data record versions and edges represent modifications.  Each edge will store:
    *   User/Device ID initiating the change.
    *   Timestamp of the modification.
    *   Type of modification (create, update, delete).
    *   Specific fields modified.
    *   Configuration data in effect at the time of modification.
*   **Storage:**  The provenance graph is stored on the server, associated with each data record.  Optimized for fast traversal and querying.  Consider a graph database solution (e.g., Neo4j) or a specialized in-memory graph structure.
*   **Graph Updates:**  Every data modification, regardless of success or failure, triggers a graph update.  Even rejected modifications are logged, providing a complete audit trail.

**2. Predictive Conflict Resolution:**

*   **Conflict Detection Algorithm:**  A background process periodically analyzes the provenance graph for potential conflicts.  Conflicts are identified when multiple devices/users have modified the *same* data fields in *incompatible* ways.  Incompatibility is determined based on:
    *   **Modification Type:**  Deleting a field conflicts with updating it.
    *   **Data Type:**  Attempting to assign a string to an integer field.
    *   **Business Rules:**  Predefined rules specify which modifications are incompatible (e.g., changing a ‘status’ field from ‘approved’ to ‘pending’ after a certain date).
*   **Resolution Option Generation:**  When a potential conflict is detected, the system generates a set of resolution options:
    *   **Last-Write-Wins:**  The most recent modification is applied, overwriting earlier ones.
    *   **Merge:**  Attempt to merge the conflicting changes automatically (applicable to certain data types and modifications).
    *   **User Prompt:**  Present the conflicting changes to the user(s) involved and allow them to choose which one to apply or to manually merge the changes.
    *   **Version Control:**  Create a new version of the data record, preserving both conflicting changes.
*   **Proactive Conflict Notification:** The client device receives an alert regarding the potential conflict *before* submitting the modification. The alert displays the conflicting changes and presents the resolution options.

**3. Configuration Data Augmentation:**

*   **Conflict Resolution Preference:** Add a new parameter to the client configuration data specifying the preferred conflict resolution strategy.
*   **Conflict Sensitivity:** Add a parameter to indicate the sensitivity of a data record. Highly sensitive records may trigger more aggressive conflict resolution strategies or require manual intervention.
*   **Data Field Specificity:**  Extend configuration data to allow specifying different conflict resolution strategies for *individual* data fields within a record.

**4. Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function submitModification(dataRecord, modifications):
  // 1. Fetch latest configuration data
  config = getServerConfig()

  // 2. Predict potential conflicts based on modifications and provenance graph (fetched from server)
  conflicts = predictConflicts(dataRecord, modifications, config)

  // 3. If conflicts detected:
  if (conflicts.length > 0):
    // a. Present conflict resolution options to the user
    resolutionOption = getUserResolution(conflicts)

    // b. Apply resolution option (e.g., merge, overwrite, cancel)
    applyResolution(dataRecord, modifications, resolutionOption)

  // 4. Submit modifications to server
  sendToServer(dataRecord, modifications)
```

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Assisted Resolution:** Use machine learning to automatically suggest optimal resolution options based on historical conflict data.
*   **Blockchain Integration:**  Store the provenance graph on a blockchain for enhanced security and immutability.
*   **Real-Time Collaboration:**  Enable multiple users to collaborate on a data record simultaneously, with the system proactively detecting and resolving conflicts in real-time.
