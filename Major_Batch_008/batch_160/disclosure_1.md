## Adaptive Container Orchestration with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Core Concept:** Extend the container deployment system with a predictive resource allocation engine that dynamically adjusts container resource limits *before* testing even begins, based on historical test data, code complexity metrics, and anticipated workload. This aims to optimize test execution speed, minimize resource waste, and proactively identify potential performance bottlenecks before deployment.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Historical Test Data Aggregator:**
    *   Collects data from previous container test runs: CPU usage, memory allocation, disk I/O, network latency, test pass/fail rates, test execution time.
    *   Data is stored in a time-series database (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB) categorized by software version, test suite, and client device profile.
    *   Implements data anonymization techniques for privacy compliance.

*   **Component 2: Code Complexity Analyzer:**
    *   Integrates with the CI/CD pipeline to analyze source code changes (static analysis).
    *   Calculates code complexity metrics: cyclomatic complexity, Halstead volume, lines of code, number of dependencies.
    *   Outputs a complexity score representing the potential resource demands of the new code.

*   **Component 3: Predictive Resource Allocation Engine:**
    *   Uses a machine learning model (e.g., regression, neural network) trained on historical test data and code complexity scores.
    *   Takes as input: software version, test suite, client device profile, code complexity score.
    *   Outputs: predicted CPU limit, predicted memory limit, predicted disk I/O limit, predicted network bandwidth.

*   **Component 4: Container Orchestration Manager:**
    *   Modifies container deployment configurations based on the predicted resource limits.
    *   Dynamically adjusts container resource limits *before* test execution begins.
    *   Monitors container resource usage during test execution.
    *   Feeds real-time resource usage data back to the Predictive Resource Allocation Engine for model retraining and refinement.
    *   If observed resource usage deviates significantly from predicted values, triggers alerts and initiates adaptive resource adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Resource Allocation Engine):**

```
function predict_resources(software_version, test_suite, client_profile, complexity_score):
  # Load trained ML model
  model = load_model("resource_prediction_model")

  # Prepare input features
  features = [software_version, test_suite, client_profile, complexity_score]

  # Make prediction
  prediction = model.predict(features)

  # Extract resource limits from prediction
  cpu_limit = prediction[0]
  memory_limit = prediction[1]
  disk_io_limit = prediction[2]
  network_bandwidth = prediction[3]

  return cpu_limit, memory_limit, disk_io_limit, network_bandwidth
```

**Deployment Scenario:**

1.  A new software version is committed to the CI/CD pipeline.
2.  The Code Complexity Analyzer calculates the complexity score.
3.  The Predictive Resource Allocation Engine predicts the resource limits.
4.  The Container Orchestration Manager configures the containers with the predicted resource limits.
5.  The tests are executed in the containers.
6.  The Container Orchestration Manager monitors resource usage and provides feedback to the Predictive Resource Allocation Engine.
