**Adaptive Session Trust Scoring**

**Concept:** Expand upon the transitive restriction concept by introducing a dynamic trust score for session tokens, factoring in not just source address, but also behavioral biometrics and device fingerprinting. This enables fine-grained access control that adapts to changing risk profiles *during* a session, rather than being static.

**Specs:**

*   **Component: Session Trust Engine (STE)** â€“ A microservice responsible for calculating and maintaining the trust score for each active session token.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   **Initial Trust Score:** Assigned at session creation. Baseline value.
    *   **Source IP Address:**  As per the patent, but used for initial scoring, not absolute restriction.
    *   **Device Fingerprint:** Browser/OS details, plugins, installed fonts, etc. Collected on initial handshake.
    *   **Behavioral Biometrics:**  Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure), mouse movements (speed, acceleration), scrolling patterns. Collected continuously *during* the session.
    *   **API Call Patterns:** Frequency, sequence, and type of API calls made using the token.
    *   **Geographic Location:** (Optional, with user consent) Derived from IP address or device GPS.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** A weighted scoring system. Weights are configurable and can be adjusted based on security policy.  Example:
    *   Source IP Address (10%)
    *   Device Fingerprint (20%)
    *   Keystroke Dynamics (30%)
    *   API Call Patterns (30%)
    *   Geographic Location (10%)
*   **Trust Thresholds:** Configurable thresholds to trigger actions:
    *   **High Trust:**  Normal operation.
    *   **Medium Trust:**  Challenge user with MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
    *   **Low Trust:**  Terminate session.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/trust/score`:  Returns the current trust score for a given token. (Internal use only)
    *   `/trust/verify`:  API endpoint integrated into all service calls. This endpoint:
        1.  Receives the session token and request details.
        2.  Queries the STE for the trust score.
        3.  If the score is below the threshold, triggers MFA or session termination.
        4.  Otherwise, allows the request to proceed.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** STE utilizes machine learning algorithms to continuously improve the accuracy of the trust score based on observed patterns and feedback.
*   **Real-time Monitoring & Alerting:**  Dashboard to visualize trust scores and identify suspicious activity. Alerting system to notify security personnel of potential threats.

**Pseudocode ( `/trust/verify` endpoint):**

```
function verifyRequest(sessionToken, requestDetails):
  trustScore = SessionTrustEngine.getTrustScore(sessionToken)
  if trustScore < MFA_THRESHOLD:
    triggerMFA(sessionToken)
    return "MFA Required"
  else if trustScore < TERMINATION_THRESHOLD:
    terminateSession(sessionToken)
    return "Session Terminated"
  else:
    // Allow request to proceed
    return "Request Approved"
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond static source address restrictions by introducing a dynamic, behavioral-based trust scoring system. It provides a more nuanced and adaptive security model, reducing false positives and improving overall security posture.  The continuous monitoring and machine learning components further enhance its effectiveness over time.
