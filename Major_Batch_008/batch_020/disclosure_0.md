## Secure Enclave Attestation via Biological Signal Integration

**Specification:** A system augmenting secure enclave operation with real-time physiological data as an additional attestation factor, increasing security against sophisticated attacks and enabling dynamic trust assessment.

**Components:**

*   **Secure Co-Processor (SCP):** As described in the provided patent, this manages secure operations and enclave integrity.
*   **Biometric Sensor Array:** A non-invasive array of sensors (e.g., ECG, EEG, GSR/EDA) integrated with the host system – potentially within the keyboard/mouse or as a wearable peripheral.
*   **Signal Processing Unit (SPU):** Dedicated hardware or software module responsible for real-time acquisition, filtering, and feature extraction from biometric signals.
*   **Dynamic Trust Evaluator (DTE):**  A module within the SCP responsible for comparing current biometric data signatures with established baseline signatures.
*   **Baseline Signature Database:** Secure storage for individual user’s established biometric signatures, encrypted and protected by the SCP.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding Module (ATM):**  A component within the DTE adjusting sensitivity thresholds based on environmental factors and user behavior patterns.

**Operation:**

1.  **Enrollment Phase:**  During initial setup, the user undergoes a biometric data capture session. The SPU captures signals while the user performs a standardized set of actions.  The DTE establishes a baseline biometric signature profile.  This profile is stored in the Baseline Signature Database, encrypted with a key accessible only to the SCP.

2.  **Runtime Attestation:** When a secure operation is initiated (as per the provided patent), the following steps are added:

    *   **Biometric Data Acquisition:** The SPU begins capturing biometric data from the user.
    *   **Feature Extraction:** The SPU extracts relevant features from the raw signals (e.g., heart rate variability, EEG alpha/theta band power, skin conductance response).
    *   **Signature Comparison:** The DTE compares the extracted features against the user’s established baseline signature.  It calculates a 'trust score' based on the similarity between the current and baseline data.
    *   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The ATM dynamically adjusts the trust score threshold based on environmental factors (e.g., stress, fatigue) and observed user behavior patterns (e.g., typing speed, mouse movements).
    *   **Secure Operation Enablement:** If the trust score exceeds the adjusted threshold, the SCP proceeds with the secure operation. If the score falls below the threshold, the operation is aborted, and an alert is generated.

**Pseudocode (DTE Module):**

```
function EvaluateTrust(currentFeatures, baselineSignature, environmentalFactors, userBehavior):
    trustScore = CalculateSimilarity(currentFeatures, baselineSignature)

    // Adjust threshold based on context
    thresholdAdjustment = CalculateContextualAdjustment(environmentalFactors, userBehavior)
    adjustedThreshold = baseThreshold - thresholdAdjustment

    if trustScore > adjustedThreshold:
        return True // Operation permitted
    else:
        return False // Operation aborted
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Spoofing:** The system must be resilient to attempts to spoof biometric signals. Advanced signal processing techniques (e.g., liveness detection) and encryption of data in transit and at rest will be employed.
*   **Privacy:** Biometric data must be handled with the utmost care to protect user privacy. Data will be anonymized and encrypted, and users will have control over their data.
*   **Signal Integrity:**  Robust error detection and correction mechanisms will be implemented to ensure the integrity of biometric signals.
