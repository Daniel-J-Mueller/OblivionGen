**Adaptive Query Expansion via Knowledge Graph Traversal**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Knowledge Graph (KG) – Populated with entities extracted from data sets *and* external sources (Wikipedia, specialized databases).  Relationships between entities are crucial.
*   **Query Input:** Natural Language Query (NLQ) - as in the provided patent.
*   **Initial Entity Linking:** Utilize the NER model from the patent to identify potential entities within the NLQ.
*   **KG Traversal Module:** This is the novel component.
    *   Upon identifying entities, initiate a traversal of the KG *starting* from those entities.
    *   Traversal is guided by the *semantic type* of the entity (e.g., if "Sales" is identified, prioritize relationships like "reports to", "influences", "affected by").
    *   Traversal depth is adjustable, controlled by a ‘relevance threshold’ parameter.  Higher threshold = deeper search, more potential expansion.
    *   Expansion Candidates: Each node encountered during traversal represents a potential "expansion candidate".
*   **Relevance Scoring:** Expansion candidates are scored based on:
    *   Path length from the initial entity.
    *   Type of relationship along the path.
    *   External data source confidence (if applicable).
*   **Query Expansion:**  Top-N scored expansion candidates are incorporated into the original NLQ.  This can be achieved via:
    *   Adding the expansion candidate as a direct filter (e.g., "Sales in California").
    *   Generating a new, related sub-query.
*   **Hybrid Query Execution:** The original NLQ and expanded queries are executed in parallel.  Results are merged and ranked based on a combined relevance score (original query score + expanded query score).
*   **Feedback Loop:** User interactions (e.g., selecting specific results, providing explicit feedback) are used to refine the relevance scoring model and traversal parameters.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function expand_query(nl_query, knowledge_graph, traversal_depth, relevance_threshold):
  entities = NER_model(nl_query)
  expansion_candidates = []
  for entity in entities:
    candidate_nodes = knowledge_graph.traverse(entity, traversal_depth)
    for node in candidate_nodes:
      relevance_score = calculate_relevance(node, entity, knowledge_graph)
      if relevance_score > relevance_threshold:
        expansion_candidates.append((node, relevance_score))

  expanded_queries = []
  for candidate, score in expansion_candidates:
    expanded_query = generate_query_from_candidate(nl_query, candidate)
    expanded_queries.append(expanded_query)

  return expanded_queries
```

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond simple keyword expansion by leveraging a knowledge graph to understand the *relationships* between entities in the query. The adaptive traversal allows the system to dynamically explore related concepts, even if those concepts are not explicitly mentioned in the original query. The feedback loop ensures that the expansion process becomes more accurate over time. This will allow the system to return more comprehensive and relevant results, particularly for complex or ambiguous queries. This differs from the patent's focus on fuzzy matching and type embedding, as it *proactively* expands the query space based on semantic understanding. It does not rely on the user to provide hints, it discovers context.
