## Adaptive Event Sequence Visualization & Prediction - 'ChronoLens'

**Concept:** Expand the existing event sequence tracking to incorporate probabilistic prediction of future events, visualized through an augmented reality 'lens' overlaying real-world network infrastructure. This isn’t just about *seeing* what happened, but *anticipating* what *will* happen.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Ingestion & Processing:**

*   **Event Enrichment:** Augment existing event records with contextual data: Geographic location (determined by network element location), asset criticality (business impact of failure), maintenance schedules, environmental factors (temperature, humidity – if available from network element sensors).
*   **Probabilistic Modeling:**  Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical event sequences. The model predicts the probability of various event types occurring within a defined timeframe. Input to the model: enriched event records, time-series data from network elements (CPU load, memory usage, network latency), external data feeds (weather reports, security threat intelligence).  Output: Probability distribution over possible future event types.
*   **Causal Inference Engine:** Integrate a causal inference engine (e.g., Bayesian Network) to model dependencies between network elements and identify root causes of events. This allows for more accurate prediction and proactive mitigation.

**II. Augmented Reality Visualization – ‘ChronoLens’:**

*   **Hardware:** AR headset (HoloLens 2 or equivalent).
*   **Real-Time Infrastructure Overlay:**  Display a 3D model of the network infrastructure in the AR headset, overlaid on the physical environment.
*   **Event Visualization:**
    *   **Past Events:** Display historical event records as time-stamped visual cues on the corresponding network elements (e.g., a flickering light indicating a past outage). Color-coding based on severity (red = critical, yellow = warning, green = informational).
    *   **Predicted Events:**  Project probabilistic “heatmaps” onto network elements, indicating the likelihood of future events.  The intensity of the heatmap corresponds to the probability score.  Visual representation of predicted event types (e.g., a crack appearing on a server rack to indicate a predicted hardware failure).
    *   **Causal Chains:**  Visually highlight the causal chains leading to predicted events, showing the dependencies between network elements.
*   **Interactive Exploration:**
    *   **Time Travel:** Allow the user to rewind and fast-forward time to explore historical event sequences and predicted future scenarios.
    *   **“What-If” Analysis:** Enable the user to simulate the impact of different mitigation strategies (e.g., restarting a server, applying a software patch) on predicted future events.
    *   **Data Drilldown:** Allow the user to drill down into individual event records and view detailed information.
*   **Spatial Audio Integration:** Use spatial audio cues to draw the user’s attention to critical events or predicted failures.

**III. System Architecture:**

*   **Event Collector:** Collects event data from network elements (using existing mechanisms – syslog, SNMP, APIs).
*   **Event Processing Engine:** Enriches, normalizes, and preprocesses event data.
*   **Probabilistic Modeling Server:** Hosts the LSTM model and performs probabilistic prediction.
*   **Causal Inference Server:** Runs the Bayesian Network and identifies causal relationships.
*   **AR Rendering Server:** Renders the AR visualization and streams it to the AR headset.
*   **User Interface:** AR headset.

**IV. Pseudocode (AR Rendering Server):**

```
function render_scene(event_data, prediction_data, network_model) {
  // Load 3D network model
  network_model = load_network_model()

  // Render past events
  for each event in event_data {
    element = find_element_in_model(event.element_id)
    add_event_visual_cue(element, event.timestamp, event.severity)
  }

  // Render predicted events
  for each prediction in prediction_data {
    element = find_element_in_model(prediction.element_id)
    heatmap_intensity = prediction.probability
    add_heatmap(element, prediction.event_type, heatmap_intensity)
  }

  // Render causal chains (if applicable)
  if (causal_chain_exists) {
    for each link in causal_chain {
      draw_line(link.source_element, link.destination_element)
    }
  }

  // Display scene in AR headset
  display_scene()
}
```

**Novelty:** This isn't simply a better visualization of existing data. The probabilistic prediction, combined with the AR overlay, creates a proactive, immersive experience that allows network engineers to anticipate and prevent failures before they occur. The integration of causal inference further enhances the system’s ability to identify and address root causes.
