## Adaptive Threat Modeling via Simulated User Behavior

**Concept:** Augment the existing graph-based threat analysis with a dynamic simulation layer representing typical (and atypical) user behavior. This allows for proactive identification of anomalies *before* they manifest as detectable events, and allows the system to predict potential compromise pathways.

**Specifications:**

**1. User Behavior Profiles (UBPs):**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with existing identity and access management (IAM) systems, security information and event management (SIEM) logs, and potentially even passively observed user activity (e.g., keystroke dynamics, mouse movements – anonymized and aggregated).
*   **Profile Creation:** Utilize machine learning (clustering, anomaly detection) to create UBP’s representing common user roles and actions.  UBPs will consist of:
    *   `role`: (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Finance Manager", "Help Desk Technician")
    *   `typical_actions`: (List of frequently performed actions with associated resource access – weighted by frequency)
    *   `access_patterns`: (Temporal access patterns – when are certain resources typically accessed?)
    *   `deviation_threshold`: (Acceptable deviation from normal behavior before triggering a flag)
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Continuously update UBPs based on observed behavior, accounting for seasonal variations, project cycles, and individual user learning.

**2. Simulated User Engine:**

*   **Simulation Framework:**  A rule-based and probabilistic engine that simulates user actions based on UBP's.
*   **Path Generation:**  Given a starting point (e.g., user login) and a goal (e.g., access a specific data record), the engine generates multiple plausible execution paths based on UBP's. Each path consists of a sequence of actions (e.g., application launch, file access, network connection).
*   **Parallel Execution:** Execute multiple simulated paths concurrently to explore a wider range of potential attack vectors.
*   **Integration with Event Graph:** During simulation, each action generates a 'virtual event' which is temporarily overlaid onto the existing event graph. This allows the system to assess the impact of the simulated path *before* it occurs in reality.

**3. Anomaly Prediction & Risk Scoring:**

*   **Virtual Event Analysis:**  Analyze the ‘virtual event’ overlay on the event graph. Look for:
    *   Unexpected connections between resources.
    *   Access to sensitive data outside of normal access patterns.
    *   Deviation from expected execution paths.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each simulated path based on the severity of the identified anomalies and the sensitivity of the resources involved.
*   **Proactive Alerting:**  Alert security teams to high-risk simulated paths *before* they are executed by real users.
*    **Dynamic Policy Adjustments:** Automatically adjust security policies (e.g., multi-factor authentication requirements, access control rules) based on the identified risks.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
def simulate_user_behavior(user_id, start_event, goal_event, num_simulations):
  for i in range(num_simulations):
    ubp = get_user_behavior_profile(user_id)
    path = generate_simulated_path(ubp, start_event, goal_event)
    virtual_events = []
    for action in path:
      virtual_events.append(create_virtual_event(action))
    
    overlay_graph(virtual_events)
    risk_score = analyze_virtual_events(virtual_events)
    if risk_score > threshold:
      generate_alert(risk_score, path)
    remove_overlay()

def analyze_virtual_events(events):
  # Check for unexpected connections, access patterns, etc.
  # Assign risk score based on severity of anomalies
  return risk_score

```

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond reactive threat analysis by proactively simulating user behavior to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack paths *before* they are exploited. The integration of UBP’s and the virtual event overlay on the existing event graph provide a powerful mechanism for predictive threat modeling and risk mitigation.
