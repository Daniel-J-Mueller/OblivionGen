## Personalized ASR Contextual Blending

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive language/grammar model approach to dynamically blend ASR contexts based on real-time inferred user intent *beyond* simple vocabulary expansion. This moves beyond "what words are likely" to "what *type* of communication is happening", influencing the ASR's weighting of grammar and vocabulary.

**Specs:**

*   **Contextual Inference Module:**  A lightweight neural network (e.g., a small Transformer model) runs concurrently with the ASR. It analyzes incoming audio features *before* full transcription, looking for indicators of communication style:
    *   **Input:** Raw audio features (MFCCs, spectrograms), potentially combined with basic prosodic features (pitch, energy).
    *   **Output:** A vector representing a "contextual profile."  Example dimensions: “Instructional” (giving directions), “Informational” (reporting facts), “Conversational” (casual chat), “Questioning” (seeking information), "Emotional" (high/low valence). This is a continuous vector – not discrete categories.
*   **Contextual Grammar/Language Model Library:**  A curated collection of grammar and language models, each tuned for specific communication contexts.  Examples:
    *   “Navigation Grammar”: Prioritizes place names, directional terms, street names, and imperative verbs.
    *   “Technical Reporting Grammar”:  Prioritizes specialized vocabulary, precise terminology, and formal sentence structure.
    *   “Casual Conversation Model”:  Emphasizes common phrases, slang, and looser grammatical rules.
*   **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:** This algorithm blends the outputs of multiple language/grammar models based on the contextual profile.  A simple linear combination is a starting point, but more sophisticated methods (e.g., attention mechanisms) could be explored.

    ```pseudocode
    function blend_models(context_vector, model_library):
        # context_vector: Output from Contextual Inference Module
        # model_library: Dictionary of language/grammar models

        # Calculate weights for each model based on context_vector
        weights = calculate_weights(context_vector, model_library)

        # Combine model outputs using weights
        blended_output = 0
        for model, weight in model_library.items():
            blended_output += weight * model.predict()

        return blended_output
    ```

*   **Real-time Adaptation Loop:** The contextual inference module runs continuously, updating the weighting algorithm and dynamically adjusting the ASR’s behavior.

**Refinement:**

1.  **User-Specific Context Profiles:**  The system learns individual user communication patterns, creating personalized context profiles.
2.  **Multi-Modal Integration:** Incorporate visual data (e.g., camera feed) to enhance contextual understanding. (Is the user looking at a map? A product? A person?)
3.  **Emotional Tone Detection:** Analyze audio prosody to detect emotional state and adjust language model weighting accordingly. (More empathetic phrasing in response to a distressed user.)
4.  **FST Integration:** Utilize FSTs to efficiently represent the blended language models and optimize ASR performance. (This ties back to the patent's FST mention, but expands it significantly.)
