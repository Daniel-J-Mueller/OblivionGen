## Adaptive Shim Grid for ULD Securing

**Concept:** A dynamically adjustable shim grid system integrated *within* the decking itself, designed to accommodate ULDs of varying heights and minor deck irregularities, eliminating the need for separate, manually placed shims.

**Specs:**

*   **Decking Integration:** Decking comprised of a modular grid of individually height-adjustable “cells”. Cell size: 30cm x 30cm (adjustable).
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Each cell incorporates a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric or micro-servo driven) with a travel range of 5-10mm. Control is achieved via a central processing unit.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Each cell is equipped with a proximity sensor (infrared or ultrasonic) to detect the underside of the ULD and a force sensor to measure the load distribution.
*   **Control System:** A central processing unit (CPU) utilizes sensor data to dynamically adjust cell heights, creating a perfectly level and secure support surface for the ULD.
*   **Power System:** Low-voltage DC power distribution network integrated within the decking structure.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Wireless communication (Bluetooth or Zigbee) for data transmission and system control.
*   **Material Composition:** Decking cells constructed from a high-strength, lightweight composite material (carbon fiber reinforced polymer).
*   **Software Algorithm:**
    1.  **Initialization:** System scans decking area to identify ULD footprint.
    2.  **Height Mapping:** Sensors determine underside profile of ULD and existing deck irregularities.
    3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Actuators adjust cell heights in real-time to create a level and secure support surface.
    4.  **Load Balancing:** Force sensors monitor load distribution and make minor adjustments to optimize weight distribution.
    5.  **Error Detection:** System identifies and flags any malfunctioning cells.
    6.  **Manual Override:** Emergency manual override for each cell.
*   **Cell Design:**
    *   Each cell contains a spring-loaded central actuator and a corresponding plate.
    *   Actuator extends or retracts based on CPU commands.
    *   Plate provides a stable contact surface for the ULD.
*   **Apertures/Channels:** Embedded channels within the decking structure allow for actuator wiring and communication lines to be routed neatly.
*   **Durability:** Designed to withstand repeated loading and unloading cycles and exposure to harsh environmental conditions.
*   **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** In the event of a power failure, a mechanical locking mechanism engages to hold the cells in their last known position.



**Operation:**

1.  A ULD is positioned on the adaptive decking.
2.  Sensors detect the underside profile of the ULD and deck irregularities.
3.  The CPU calculates the necessary height adjustments for each cell.
4.  Actuators raise or lower cells to create a level and secure support surface.
5.  Force sensors continuously monitor load distribution and make minor adjustments.
6.  The system automatically compensates for any shifts or movements of the ULD.
