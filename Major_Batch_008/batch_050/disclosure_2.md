## Dynamic Prosody Cloning for Personalized TTS

**Concept:** Extend emphasized speech generation beyond simple tagging or duration adjustments by dynamically cloning the prosody (rhythm, intonation, stress) of a user's own speech to emphasize specific words or phrases in TTS output. This creates highly personalized and natural-sounding emphasis.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Modeling:**

1.  **User Speech Samples:** Acquire a corpus of short speech samples (1-5 seconds) from each user. These samples should ideally cover a range of emotional expression (neutral, happy, surprised, etc.).
2.  **Prosody Feature Extraction:** Extract a comprehensive set of prosodic features from the user speech samples. These include:
    *   Fundamental Frequency (F0) contours (pitch)
    *   Intensity/Energy contours (loudness)
    *   Speech Rate (syllables per second)
    *   Pause duration and placement
    *   Voice Quality (jitter, shimmer)
3.  **Prosody Modeling:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Model, Hidden Markov Model, Neural Network) to create a personalized prosody profile for each user.  This profile captures the characteristic prosodic patterns of that user. The model should be capable of generating prosodic features given a text input.
4.  **Emphasis Mapping:** Create an “emphasis map” associating different levels of emphasis with specific prosodic feature variations.  For example:
    *   Low Emphasis: Baseline prosody profile.
    *   Medium Emphasis: Increased F0 range, slightly faster speech rate.
    *   High Emphasis: Significant F0 peak, pronounced pauses before/after the emphasized word, increased intensity.

**II. TTS Processing Pipeline:**

1.  **Text Input & Tagging:** Receive text input with emphasis tags (e.g., SSML).  Tags should indicate the desired level of emphasis for specific words or phrases.
2.  **Base TTS Synthesis:** Generate a preliminary TTS output using a standard TTS engine.
3.  **Prosody Modification:**
    *   Retrieve the user's personalized prosody profile.
    *   For each emphasized word/phrase:
        *   Determine the corresponding emphasis level from the tag.
        *   Modify the preliminary TTS audio by applying the prosodic features associated with that emphasis level, as defined in the emphasis map. This could involve dynamic time stretching, pitch shifting, and amplitude scaling.
4.  **Audio Smoothing:** Apply audio smoothing techniques to blend the modified segments seamlessly into the surrounding audio, ensuring natural-sounding transitions.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
function GenerateEmphasizedSpeech(text, userProfile, emphasisTags):
  baseAudio = GenerateBaseTTSAudio(text)
  for each tag in emphasisTags:
    word = tag.word
    emphasisLevel = tag.level

    wordStartTime = FindWordStartTime(baseAudio, word)
    wordEndTime = FindWordEndTime(baseAudio, word)

    prosodicFeatures = GetProsodicFeaturesForEmphasisLevel(userProfile, emphasisLevel)

    modifiedAudioSegment = ApplyProsodicFeatures(baseAudioSegment, wordStartTime, wordEndTime, prosodicFeatures)

    baseAudio = ReplaceAudioSegment(baseAudio, wordStartTime, wordEndTime, modifiedAudioSegment)

  return baseAudio
```

**IV. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-quality microphone for recording user speech samples.
*   Powerful processor for training machine learning models and real-time audio processing.
*   TTS Engine (e.g., Tacotron 2, WaveGlow).
*   Machine Learning Framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Audio processing libraries (e.g., Librosa, PyAudio).
