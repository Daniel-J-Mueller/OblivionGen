## Dynamic Error Prediction & Preemptive Routing

**System Overview:**

This system extends the error identification capabilities of the existing cut-through network monitoring system by *predicting* error propagation *before* it manifests as widespread packet loss. It achieves this through a combination of real-time error data analysis, machine learning-based prediction, and dynamic, preemptive routing adjustments.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Enhanced Network Switches:** Existing switches are augmented with increased processing power and memory for on-board error analysis and route calculation.
*   **Dedicated Prediction Server:** A server cluster dedicated to running the prediction models and coordinating routing changes.
*   **High-Speed Interconnect:** A low-latency, high-bandwidth network connecting the enhanced switches and the prediction server.

**Software Components:**

*   **Real-Time Error Aggregation Module:** Runs on each switch, aggregating error counts (CRC, parity, etc.) for inbound/outbound ports, at sub-second intervals. This data is timestamped and transmitted to the Prediction Server.
*   **Prediction Engine:** The core of the system. This module utilizes machine learning models (Recurrent Neural Networks, specifically LSTMs) trained on historical error data and network topology. It analyzes incoming error streams, identifies patterns indicative of potential error propagation, and *predicts* which links are likely to experience increased error rates within a short time window (e.g., next 5 seconds). The models must adaptively weight the influence of different error types.
*   **Dynamic Routing Controller:** Based on the predictions from the Prediction Engine, this module calculates alternative routes for critical traffic flows to bypass potentially problematic links. It communicates these routing changes to the enhanced network switches.  The algorithm prioritizes minimal disruption to existing traffic flows while maximizing resilience.
*   **Topology Database:**  Maintains a detailed, up-to-date map of the network topology, including link capacities, utilization, and switch capabilities. This is crucial for accurate route calculation.  The database is automatically updated using Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) or similar mechanisms.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitors the performance of preemptively adjusted routes. If a predicted error does *not* materialize, the system reverts to the original routing and adjusts the prediction model to improve accuracy. If the prediction is correct, the model is reinforced.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine - Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Data Structures
struct ErrorRecord {
  timestamp: long;
  switchID: int;
  portID: int;
  errorType: enum; // CRC, Parity, etc.
  errorCount: int;
};

// Prediction Model (LSTM) - Pre-trained on historical data

function predictErrorPropagation(errorRecords[], topologyData) {

  // 1. Prepare Input: Aggregate error data per switch/port over a sliding window
  aggregatedData = aggregateErrors(errorRecords, slidingWindowSize);

  // 2. LSTM Prediction: Feed aggregated data into the pre-trained LSTM model
  predictedErrorRates = LSTM_Model.predict(aggregatedErrorRates); // Returns error rate per link

  // 3. Risk Assessment: Identify links with predicted error rates exceeding a threshold
  highRiskLinks = [];
  for each link in topologyData {
    if (predictedErrorRates[link] > errorThreshold) {
      highRiskLinks.add(link);
    }
  }
  return highRiskLinks;
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  Enhanced switches continuously collect and transmit real-time error data to the Prediction Server.
2.  The Prediction Engine analyzes the incoming error data, identifies potential error propagation patterns, and predicts which links are likely to experience increased error rates.
3.  The Dynamic Routing Controller calculates alternative routes for critical traffic flows to bypass the predicted problematic links.
4.  The Dynamic Routing Controller instructs the enhanced switches to adjust their forwarding tables accordingly.
5.  The system continuously monitors the performance of the adjusted routes and adjusts the prediction models to improve accuracy.

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simply *identifying* errors; it *predicts* their propagation and proactively adjusts the network to mitigate the impact. This approach offers significant advantages in terms of network resilience, performance, and user experience. The combination of real-time error analysis, machine learning-based prediction, and dynamic routing is a novel approach to network error management.
