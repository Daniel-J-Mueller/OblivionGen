## Dynamic Request Shadowing & Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend incremental deployment beyond simply increasing request percentages. Implement a “shadowing” system where a small percentage of requests are *duplicated* and sent to both the old and new versions *simultaneously*, regardless of the primary routing. The results are compared in real-time.  This allows for *proactive* identification of subtle differences and failures *before* a user experiences them, and enables predictive rollback.

**Specifications:**

**1. Request Duplication Module:**

*   **Function:** Intercepts a configurable percentage of incoming requests (e.g., 1-5%).
*   **Mechanism:** Creates a duplicate request packet.
*   **Routing:** Sends the original request to the currently scheduled version (based on existing incremental deployment logic). Sends the duplicate request to the alternative version.
*   **Correlation ID:** Assigns a unique Correlation ID to both the original and duplicate requests. This ID is crucial for comparing responses.

**2. Response Comparison Engine:**

*   **Input:** Receives responses from both the primary and shadow requests (identified by Correlation ID).
*   **Comparison Metrics:**
    *   **Functional Equivalence:** Compares key data fields within the response (e.g., return codes, relevant data values). Implement a configurable tolerance level for minor discrepancies.
    *   **Performance Metrics:** Measures response times for both requests.
    *   **Error Detection:** Flags any errors or exceptions reported by either version.
*   **Scoring System:** Assigns a “health score” to the shadow deployment based on comparison results. Factors include functional equivalence, performance difference, and error rate.

**3. Predictive Rollback Mechanism:**

*   **Thresholds:** Configurable thresholds for the health score.  If the score falls below a threshold, the system automatically:
    *   **Increases routing weight to the stable version.**
    *   **Sends an alert to operations.**
    *   **Optionally, initiates a full rollback to the previous version.**
*   **Rollback Granularity:** Support rollback to specific versions or configurations.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:**  Implement machine learning to dynamically adjust thresholds based on historical data and request patterns.

**4.  Data Storage & Analysis:**

*   **Log all shadow request/response data.**
*   **Aggregate health score data over time.**
*   **Provide dashboards for monitoring system health and identifying potential issues.**
*   **Utilize data to optimize incremental deployment schedules and minimize risk.**

**Pseudocode (Simplified Rollback Logic):**

```
function handleShadowResponse(correlationId, primaryResponse, shadowResponse) {
  healthScore = calculateHealthScore(primaryResponse, shadowResponse);

  if (healthScore < rollbackThreshold) {
    increaseRoutingWeightToStableVersion();
    sendAlert("Shadow deployment failing - initiating rollback");

    if (healthScore < criticalRollbackThreshold) {
      rollbackToPreviousVersion();
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This differs from the provided patent by adding a layer of *proactive* validation *before* user impact, rather than *reacting* to failures after they occur. The 'shadowing' technique allows for the detection of subtle discrepancies that might not be immediately apparent in standard incremental deployment, improving stability and reducing risk.  The system goes beyond simply monitoring success rates; it actively compares results to ensure functional equivalence.
