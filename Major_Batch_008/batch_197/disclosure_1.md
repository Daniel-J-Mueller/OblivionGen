## Dynamic Interest Weighting via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Enhance user interest profiles by incorporating real-time biofeedback data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial expression analysis) to dynamically adjust interest weighting during route planning.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Integrate with wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers) & device cameras. Collect data streams of:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - indicator of emotional engagement & stress.
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) / Skin Conductance - measures arousal & excitement.
    *   Facial Expression Analysis - identifies emotional state (joy, surprise, boredom, etc.) via camera input.
*   **Real-time Data Processing:** Implement a lightweight, on-device processing pipeline to filter, normalize, and extract relevant features from biofeedback streams.  Emphasis on low latency.
*   **Interest Weighting Model:**
    *   Maintain a base interest profile (as described in the patent) reflecting long-term user preferences.
    *   Implement a dynamic weighting algorithm that adjusts interest scores based on real-time biofeedback.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   `InterestScore = BaseScore + BiofeedbackModifier`
        *   `BiofeedbackModifier =  w1 * HRV_Score + w2 * EDA_Score + w3 * FacialExpression_Score`
            *   `HRV_Score`:  Scale HRV metrics (e.g., RMSSD) to a 0-1 range.  Higher scores = increased engagement.
            *   `EDA_Score`: Scale EDA metrics (e.g., number of skin conductance responses) to a 0-1 range.  Higher scores = increased arousal.
            *   `FacialExpression_Score`:  Assign scores based on detected facial expressions (e.g., joy = 1, neutral = 0.5, boredom = 0).
            *   `w1`, `w2`, `w3` = User-configurable weights to prioritize different biofeedback signals.  Initial values determined via a calibration process.
*   **Calibration Process:**
    *   Present the user with a series of stimuli (images, videos, audio clips) related to different interests.
    *   Record biofeedback data while the user views the stimuli.
    *   Use machine learning (e.g., regression) to learn the optimal weights `w1`, `w2`, `w3` for each user, maximizing the correlation between biofeedback responses and self-reported interest levels.
*   **Route Planning Integration:** Integrate the dynamic interest weighting model into the route planning algorithm.  Prioritize POIs with higher weighted interest scores.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  User consent required for collecting and processing biofeedback data.  Data anonymization and encryption implemented. Option to disable biofeedback data collection at any time.
*   **UI/UX:**
    *   Provide visual feedback to the user indicating the system is adapting to their real-time emotional state.
    *   Allow the user to manually adjust interest weights and biofeedback sensitivity.
    *   Provide explanations of how the system is using their biofeedback data to personalize the route.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function calculateInterestScore(baseScore, hrvScore, edaScore, facialExpressionScore, w1, w2, w3):
  biofeedbackModifier = (w1 * hrvScore) + (w2 * edaScore) + (w3 * facialExpressionScore)
  interestScore = baseScore + biofeedbackModifier
  return interestScore

function planRoute(user, destination, offRouteInfo):
  interests = determineUserInterests(user)
  for interest in interests:
    interest.baseScore = getBaseInterestScore(user, interest)
    biofeedbackData = getRealtimeBiofeedbackData(user)
    hrvScore = processHRV(biofeedbackData)
    edaScore = processEDA(biofeedbackData)
    facialExpressionScore = processFacialExpression(biofeedbackData)
    interest.interestScore = calculateInterestScore(interest.baseScore, hrvScore, edaScore, facialExpressionScore, user.w1, user.w2, user.w3)
  
  poiList = findPoisWithinBoundary(user, offRouteInfo)
  rankedPois = rankPoisByInterestScore(poiList)
  generateRoute(destination, rankedPois)
