## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Visual Acuity Monitoring

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of monitoring vision changes but shifts the primary output from visual recommendations to haptic feedback. The core idea is to translate changes in visual acuity into nuanced haptic patterns delivered via a wearable device (wristband, glove, or similar). This caters to users with visual impairments or those who prefer non-visual alerts.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Depth/Range Sensor:** Integrated into the display device or a nearby peripheral (e.g., a smart speaker). Similar to those in the original patent, for distance and head tilt data.
*   **High-Density Haptic Actuator Array:** A wearable device containing numerous small actuators capable of producing localized vibrations, textures, or pressure changes. Resolution of at least 100 actuators per ~10cm^2 is desirable.
*   **Microcontroller/Processor:** Onboard the wearable, processing data from the depth sensor and translating acuity changes into haptic commands.
*   **Wireless Communication Module:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication with the display device and potentially a smartphone app for customization.
*   **Optional: Eye-Tracking Camera:**  A low-power camera integrated into the display to refine the detection of acuity changes and provide additional data.

**Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Baseline Calibration:** The system first establishes a baseline of the user's typical viewing distance, head tilt, and (optionally) pupil dilation.
2.  **Real-time Data Acquisition:** The depth sensor and (if present) eye-tracking camera continuously capture data on the user's position relative to the display.
3.  **Acuity Change Detection:** Algorithms analyze the data for subtle shifts in viewing distance or head tilt that indicate a change in visual acuity. This is correlated with the baseline calibration data.  Significant deviations from the baseline trigger an alert.
4.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:** The system maps the degree of acuity change to a specific haptic pattern. 
    *   **Graded Intensity:** A simple vibration that increases in intensity with the severity of the change.
    *   **Texture Mapping:** Creation of temporary "textures" on the skin using the actuator array, where changes in visual clarity translate to changes in the texture. (e.g., a smooth texture indicates good vision, while a rough texture indicates decreased clarity).
    *   **Directional Cues:** Using the array to create the sensation of movement or direction, potentially indicating where the user should adjust their focus.
5.  **Personalization & Learning:** The system learns the user's preferences over time, adapting the haptic patterns to be more intuitive and less disruptive. A smartphone app allows users to customize the patterns and sensitivity.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(acuityChangeScore):
    if acuityChangeScore < minorThreshold:
        // Minimal change - subtle vibration
        setHapticIntensity(0.1)
        setHapticPattern( "gentlePulse")
    else if acuityChangeScore < moderateThreshold:
        // Moderate change - stronger vibration with texture
        setHapticIntensity(0.5)
        setHapticPattern("wave")
    else:
        // Significant change - complex pattern to draw attention
        setHapticIntensity(1.0)
        setHapticPattern("complexRumble")
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Assisting visually impaired users with navigation and object recognition.
*   Providing early warnings of vision deterioration to individuals at risk of eye diseases.
*   Creating immersive feedback mechanisms for virtual and augmented reality applications.
*   Enhancing accessibility for users with diverse visual needs.
