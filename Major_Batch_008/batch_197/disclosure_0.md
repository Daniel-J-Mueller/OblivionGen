## Adaptive Data Tiering Based on Predictive Access Patterns

**Specification:** Implement a predictive data tiering system that dynamically migrates data blocks within the storage sleds – and potentially *between* storage units – based on predicted access patterns. This goes beyond simple LRU or frequency-based tiering.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Access Pattern Predictor (APP):** A machine learning model trained on historical I/O traces. This model predicts future access probabilities for each data block. Inputs include:
    *   Time-based access history (hourly, daily, weekly seasonality).
    *   Application-specific access patterns (identified via metadata or heuristics).
    *   User behavior analysis (if applicable).

2.  **Tiered Storage Hierarchy within Sleds:** Divide each storage sled into multiple tiers – e.g., NVMe (fastest, smallest), SSD, HDD (slowest, largest). Each tier has a different cost and performance profile.

3.  **Dynamic Migration Engine (DME):** Responsible for migrating data blocks between tiers based on the APP's predictions. This engine operates in the background without disrupting ongoing I/O.

4. **Proactive Prefetching:** DME prefetches data blocks that the APP predicts will be accessed soon, storing them in the faster tiers.

**Pseudocode (DME):**

```
// Main loop
while (true) {
  // Get predicted access probabilities from APP
  access_probabilities = APP.get_probabilities();

  // Identify blocks with significantly changing probabilities
  blocks_to_migrate = find_blocks_with_significant_change(access_probabilities);

  for (block in blocks_to_migrate) {
    // Determine optimal tier based on predicted access probability
    target_tier = determine_optimal_tier(block.access_probability);

    // If current tier != target tier
    if (block.current_tier != target_tier) {
      // Initiate data migration
      migrate_data(block, target_tier);
    }
  }

  // Run background data compaction/defragmentation (optional)
  perform_compaction();

  sleep(migration_interval); // e.g., 5 seconds
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Data Block Metadata:** Each data block has associated metadata:
    *   `block_id` (unique identifier).
    *   `current_tier`.
    *   `access_timestamp` (last access time).
    *   `predicted_access_probability`.
*   **Tier Configuration:** Defines the characteristics of each tier (speed, capacity, cost).

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond reactive tiering to *proactive* tiering, anticipating data access needs before they occur.  The use of machine learning allows the system to adapt to changing workloads and user behaviors automatically, optimizing storage performance and cost.  Furthermore, the tiered hierarchy *within* the sleds offers fine-grained control over data placement, maximizing the utilization of different storage media.  The predictive prefetching aspect minimizes latency for frequently accessed data, enhancing the overall user experience.
