## Dynamic Fabric Mesh Steering

**Concept:** Extend the steering route concept beyond a simple primary/secondary switch to a dynamically adjustable mesh of paths within the network fabric. Instead of just two options, multiple paths are pre-calculated and maintained, each with an associated cost/metric. The steering route doesn’t *switch* to a single alternate, but *distributes* traffic across multiple paths based on real-time conditions and policy.

**Specs:**

*   **Path Calculation Engine:** A distributed engine running on network devices to continuously calculate multiple viable paths for each prefix. This utilizes a modified Dijkstra or OSPF algorithm allowing for multiple shortest paths to be retained. Factors influencing cost include: latency, bandwidth utilization, congestion, device load, and pre-defined policy (e.g., favor paths through certain data centers).

*   **Path Table:** Each network device maintains a "Path Table" for each prefix, listing multiple next hops (ports/interfaces) along with their associated costs. This table is updated dynamically by the Path Calculation Engine.  Data structure:  `{prefix: [{next_hop: port_id, cost: integer}, {next_hop: port_id, cost: integer}, ...]}`

*   **Steering Policy Engine:** A centralized or distributed engine that defines policies for traffic distribution. Policies can be based on:
    *   Prefix (destination)
    *   Source address/group
    *   Application type (identified via Deep Packet Inspection or DSCP marking)
    *   Time of day
    *   Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
    *   Real-time network conditions

*   **Traffic Distribution Algorithm:**  Based on the steering policy and real-time conditions, a traffic distribution algorithm determines the percentage of traffic to send via each path. Algorithms could include:
    *   Weighted Round Robin: Traffic distributed proportionally to path cost (lower cost = higher weight).
    *   Least Congested Path: Dynamically routes traffic to the path with the lowest current congestion.
    *   SLA-Based Steering: Prioritizes paths that meet SLA requirements for specific applications or prefixes.
    *   Hashing: Traffic is distributed using a hash function that maps prefixes to different paths.

*   **Steering Route Protocol Extension:** An extension to existing routing protocols (BGP, OSPF, IS-IS) to advertise path information and steering policies.  This extension would include:
    *   Path Metric: The cost/metric associated with each path.
    *   Steering Policy ID:  An identifier for the applicable steering policy.
    *   Policy Parameters:  Parameters specific to the steering policy (e.g., weighting factors, congestion thresholds).

*   **Monitoring and Analytics:** Comprehensive monitoring of path utilization, congestion, and latency to optimize steering policies and identify potential bottlenecks.  Data is fed back into the Path Calculation Engine to refine cost calculations.



**Pseudocode (Network Device - Packet Forwarding):**

```
function forwardPacket(packet):
    prefix = extractDestinationPrefix(packet)
    pathTable = getPathTable(prefix)

    if pathTable is empty:
        // Default forwarding behavior
        forwardPacketToDefaultGateway(packet)
        return

    totalCost = 0
    for path in pathTable:
        totalCost += path.cost

    selectedPath = selectPath(pathTable, totalCost) // Implementation details below

    forwardPacketToPort(packet, selectedPath.next_hop)

function selectPath(pathTable, totalCost):
    randomValue = generateRandomNumber(0, totalCost)
    cumulativeCost = 0
    for path in pathTable:
        cumulativeCost += path.cost
        if randomValue <= cumulativeCost:
            return path
    return pathTable.last() // Fallback – should be rare
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond simple failover to intelligent, dynamic traffic distribution across multiple paths. Enables finer-grained control over network traffic, improved resource utilization, and enhanced resilience.  Supports complex policies and real-time optimization.
