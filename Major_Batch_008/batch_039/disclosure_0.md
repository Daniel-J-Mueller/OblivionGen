## Dynamic Predictive Pre-fetching with User-Specific Coherence Zones

**Concept:** Extend the tiered storage system by proactively pre-fetching video segments *not* based solely on viewing history, but on a predicted coherence zone. This zone represents segments likely to be viewed *next*, determined by a blend of collaborative filtering, content analysis, and user-specific ‘attention’ modeling.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `CoherenceZone`: Represents a time window of video segments (e.g., 10-60 seconds) predicted to be viewed sequentially. Contains:
        *   `segmentIDs`: List of segment IDs within the zone.
        *   `confidenceScore`: Probability the user will view this zone.
        *   `priority`: Integer indicating fetch urgency (derived from confidence & segment access latency).
    *   `UserAttentionModel`: A vector representing the user's viewing patterns - dwell time on segments, fast-forward/rewind frequency, scene changes skipped, and audio engagement. Updated continuously.
*   **Modules:**
    *   `PredictionEngine`:
        *   Input: `UserAttentionModel`, video content metadata (scene detection, key events), collaborative filtering data (viewing patterns of similar users).
        *   Output: `CoherenceZone` objects with associated scores and priorities. Algorithm:
            1.  Collaborative filtering suggests likely next segments.
            2.  Content analysis identifies scenes with high ‘engagement potential’ (fast action, dialogue peaks).
            3.  `UserAttentionModel` weights these suggestions based on the user's preferences (e.g., if they skip action scenes, lower weight).
            4.  Output prioritized `CoherenceZone` list.
    *   `PrefetchManager`:
        *   Input: `CoherenceZone` list, storage tier latencies.
        *   Function: Dynamically schedules pre-fetches based on:
            *   `priority` of `CoherenceZone`.
            *   Latency of each storage tier.  High priority zones fetched to fastest tier (even if costly), lower priority to cheaper, slower tiers.
            *   Available bandwidth & storage capacity.
            *   Prefetching is *speculative*.
    *   `Cache Coherence Module`:
        *   Monitors viewing patterns.
        *   If a pre-fetched segment *isn’t* viewed within a defined timeframe, it's evicted from faster tiers and moved to slower tiers or deleted, freeing up space.
        *   Adjusts prediction model parameters based on pre-fetch success/failure rates.

*   **Pseudocode (PrefetchManager):**

```
function schedulePrefetches(CoherenceZoneList):
  for each zone in CoherenceZoneList:
    if zone.confidenceScore > threshold:
      targetTier = determineBestTier(zone.priority, storageTierLatencies)
      for each segmentID in zone.segmentIDs:
        if segmentID not in cachedSegments:
          prefetchSegment(segmentID, targetTier)
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:** Requires efficient storage access, high bandwidth, and a dedicated processor for the PredictionEngine.
*   **Potential Benefits:** Reduced buffering, improved QoE, personalized streaming experience, decreased overall bandwidth usage (by predicting needs).
