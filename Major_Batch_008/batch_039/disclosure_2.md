## Dynamic Availability Propagation with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the reactive availability updates to incorporate predictive buffering based on historical demand and supply chain data. This proactively caches availability information for bundled items, minimizing latency and improving responsiveness, especially during high-demand events.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time availability feeds (individual items), historical sales data (bundled items), supply chain schedules (lead times, expected deliveries), promotional calendars.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Normalize data formats.
    *   Calculate weighted moving averages of demand for each bundled item. Weights prioritize recent data.
    *   Forecast demand for the next *n* time intervals (e.g., 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours) using time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet).
    *   Determine supply chain buffer levels based on lead times and demand forecasts.

**2. Predictive Availability Cache (PAC):**

*   **Structure:** Multi-layered cache:
    *   *Tier 1 (Fast):* In-memory cache storing current availability for frequently accessed bundles.  TTL based on volatility of constituent items.
    *   *Tier 2 (Medium):*  Disk-based cache storing predicted availability for bundles based on the forecasting model.
    *   *Tier 3 (Slow):*  Long-term storage for historical availability data used for model training and analysis.
*   **Population:**  The PAC is populated by:
    *   Real-time updates from the existing availability update system (initial fill & correction).
    *   Demand forecasts & supply chain schedules, predicting availability for future time intervals.
*   **Key:** Bundle ID, Time Interval (for predicted availability).

**3. Availability Query Engine:**

*   **Input:** Bundle ID, Requested Time Interval (optional - defaults to current time).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Check Tier 1 (Fast) for current availability.  If found, return.
    2.  If not found, check Tier 2 (Medium) for predicted availability within the requested time interval. If found, return.
    3.  If not found in Tier 2, trigger a recalculation based on current individual item availability and return the result.
    4.  If recalculation fails, log an error and return a "unavailable" status.

**4.  Dynamic Buffer Adjustment:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor actual demand against predicted demand.
*   **Adjustment:**  If discrepancies exceed a threshold, automatically adjust the weights in the forecasting model to improve accuracy.  Also adjust supply chain buffer levels.
*   **Algorithm:** Implement a feedback loop using reinforcement learning to optimize buffer levels based on minimizing stockouts and overstocking.

**5.  Asynchronous Messaging Integration:**

*   Extend the existing asynchronous messaging system to include:
    *   *Predictive Availability Updates:*  Broadcast predicted availability changes to downstream systems.
    *   *Buffer Level Adjustments:*  Notify supply chain management systems of changes to buffer levels.
    *   *Forecasting Model Updates:* Broadcast changes to weighting for forecasting.



**Pseudocode (Availability Query Engine):**

```
function getAvailability(bundleId, timeInterval):
  // Tier 1: Fast Cache
  availability = checkCache(bundleId)
  if availability != null:
    return availability

  // Tier 2: Medium Cache (Predicted)
  predictedAvailability = checkPredictedCache(bundleId, timeInterval)
  if predictedAvailability != null:
    return predictedAvailability

  // Recalculate from individual items
  availability = calculateAvailability(bundleId)

  if availability == null:
    logError("Availability calculation failed")
    return "unavailable"

  return availability

```
