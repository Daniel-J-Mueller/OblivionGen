## Adaptive Haptic Feedback for Item Identification

**System Overview:**

This system augments the video-based item identification process with localized haptic feedback delivered through wearable devices (gloves, wristbands) worn by the associate. It aims to accelerate identification and improve accuracy, especially in visually cluttered environments or when dealing with items of similar appearance.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Camera System:** Existing video feed infrastructure.
*   **Wearable Haptic Device:** Lightweight gloves or wristbands with an array of micro-actuators capable of delivering localized tactile stimulation. Resolution of at least 1cm spacing.
*   **Processing Unit:** Existing server infrastructure, or edge-computing device.

**Software Components:**

*   **Object Segmentation & Depth Mapping Module:** Processes video feed to identify potential items and generate a depth map of the scene.
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:**  Assigns unique haptic patterns (vibration intensity, frequency, texture) to each identified item based on its physical properties (size, shape, material â€“ estimated through visual analysis).
*   **User Interface Integration:**  Modifies the existing UI to incorporate real-time haptic control and feedback.  The UI will display a low-resolution 'haptic map' overlaying the video feed, indicating which items are currently being stimulated.
*   **Calibration Module:** Allows associates to personalize the haptic feedback intensity and patterns based on their preferences and sensitivity.

**Workflow:**

1.  The system receives video data of the environment.
2.  The Object Segmentation & Depth Mapping Module identifies potential items and generates a depth map.
3.  The Haptic Mapping Algorithm assigns a unique haptic pattern to each identified item.
4.  The system sends signals to the wearable haptic device to activate the corresponding actuators, delivering localized tactile stimulation to the associate's hand/wrist.
5.  As the associate focuses on a specific item in the video feed, the corresponding haptic pattern is intensified, providing confirmatory feedback.
6.  The associate selects the item in the UI. The system records the selection and associated haptic feedback data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
calibrateHapticDevice()
loadHapticPatterns() // Database of pre-defined patterns

// Real-time processing loop
while (videoFeedAvailable) {
  frame = getVideoFrame()
  items = detectItems(frame)
  depthMap = generateDepthMap(frame)

  for each (item in items) {
    hapticPattern = getHapticPattern(item, depthMap) // Based on size, shape, material
    activateHapticActuator(hapticPattern, item.location) // Activate corresponding actuator
  }

  // UI Event: User focusing on an item
  if (userFocusDetected(item)) {
    increaseHapticIntensity(item) // Amplify feedback
  }

  //UI Event: User selects an item
  if (userSelectionDetected(item)) {
     recordSelection(item)
  }
}

// Function: getHapticPattern(item, depthMap)
// Parameters: item object, depth map
// Returns: Haptic pattern object
// Logic:
//   - Extract size, shape, and estimated material from item object
//   - Lookup corresponding haptic pattern from database
//   - Adjust pattern based on distance to camera (from depth map)
//     - Closer items = higher intensity/frequency
//     - Further items = lower intensity/frequency
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Haptic Mapping:** The system could learn and adapt haptic patterns based on associate feedback and object identification history.
*   **Multi-Modal Feedback:** Integrate auditory cues (e.g., subtle beeps or tones) to complement the haptic feedback.
*   **Haptic Search:** Allow associates to "scan" for specific items by moving their hand/wrist across the scene. The system would amplify the haptic feedback for matching items.
*   **Remote Assistance:** Allow remote experts to remotely control the haptic feedback to guide associates during complex item identification tasks.
