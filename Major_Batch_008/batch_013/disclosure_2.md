## Adaptive Trust Beacon Network

**Concept:** Expand the single-device trust indication to a network of interconnected devices, forming a localized "trust web". This leverages the collective trust assessment of multiple devices to provide a more robust and dynamic security posture.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Beacon Devices:**

*   **Hardware:** Small, low-power devices (approx. 3x3x1cm) containing:
    *   Secure Element (TPM or equivalent) for root of trust.
    *   Short-range wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee, or UWB).
    *   Multi-color LED for visual trust indication.
    *   Microphone for passive audio analysis (environmental trust cues).
    *   Optional: Small haptic feedback module.
*   **Firmware:**
    *   Secure boot process.
    *   Trust evaluation module:  Analyzes trustworthiness based on:
        *   Local application integrity checks (similar to the patent, leveraging TPM).
        *   Network trust scores received from neighboring beacons.
        *   Passive audio analysis: Detects anomalies in ambient sound (e.g., forced entry, unusual activity).
        *   User-defined trust policies (configurable via companion app).
    *   Communication Protocol:  Mesh network protocol for beacon-to-beacon communication. Secure authentication and encryption.
    *   Power Management:  Battery powered with low-power sleep modes. Wireless charging support.
*   **Deployment:** Beacons are strategically placed within a defined area (e.g., office, home, vehicle).

**2. Central Trust Manager (CTM):**

*   **Hardware:**  A dedicated device (or software running on an existing device - PC, server, smartphone) responsible for managing the beacon network.
*   **Software:**
    *   Network discovery and management:  Automatically detects and configures beacons.
    *   Trust aggregation:  Collects trust scores from all beacons and calculates an overall trust level for the environment.
    *   Policy enforcement:  Allows administrators to define trust policies and enforce them across the network.
    *   Alerting:  Sends alerts (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) when trust levels fall below a threshold.
    *   API:  Provides an API for integration with other security systems.

**3. Trust Score Calculation (Pseudocode):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(beaconData, networkData):
  localTrustScore = evaluateLocalIntegrity(beaconData.runningPrograms, beaconData.systemFiles) // Based on TPM checks
  networkTrustScore = 0
  for each neighbor in networkData.neighbors:
    networkTrustScore += neighbor.trustScore / networkData.numNeighbors // Average trust of neighbors
  environmentalTrustScore = analyzeAmbientAudio(beaconData.audioData) // Detect anomalies
  userDefinedPolicyScore = evaluatePolicyCompliance(beaconData.runningPrograms, userDefinedPolicies)
  finalTrustScore = (localTrustScore * 0.4) + (networkTrustScore * 0.3) + (environmentalTrustScore * 0.1) + (userDefinedPolicyScore * 0.2)
  return finalTrustScore
```

**4. Interaction Model:**

*   **Visual Indication:** Beacons illuminate with different colors to indicate trust levels (Green = High Trust, Yellow = Moderate Trust, Red = Low Trust).  Color pulsing frequency can indicate severity.
*   **Haptic Feedback:**  Low-level vibrations can provide subtle alerts.
*   **Companion App:**  Allows users to:
    *   View detailed trust information for each beacon.
    *   Configure trust policies.
    *   Receive alerts.
    *   Manage the beacon network.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Secure Office Environments:** Monitor the integrity of devices and detect potential threats.
*   **Smart Homes:**  Protect against unauthorized access and ensure the security of connected devices.
*   **Connected Vehicles:**  Secure the vehicleâ€™s systems and protect against cyberattacks.
*   **Critical Infrastructure:**  Monitor the integrity of control systems and prevent disruptions.
