## Automated Bag Folding & Stacking System – ‘Origami-Box’

**Concept:** Expand the bag protector concept to include automated bag folding and stacking *within* the protector itself, creating a self-contained, ready-to-ship unit. This moves beyond simply *protecting* a bag to actively preparing it for final delivery.

**System Specs:**

*   **Protector Material:** Rigid, recyclable plastic or reinforced cardboard. Internal surface coated with low-friction material.
*   **Dimensions:** Scalable to accommodate various bag sizes (grocery, retail, etc.). Standardized outer dimensions for efficient palletization.
*   **Internal Mechanism:**
    *   **Folding Plates:** Two opposing internal plates, actuated by a small electric motor. These plates move inward to fold the bag’s handles/tops inward.
    *   **Compression Plate:** A vertically moving plate to compress the bag’s contents (lightly) to minimize volume.
    *   **Sensor Suite:**
        *   **Bag Presence Sensor:** Infrared or capacitive sensor to detect a bag within the protector.
        *   **Content Weight Sensor:** Integrated load cell to estimate package weight.
        *   **Fold Completion Sensor:** Detects when the folding plates have reached their maximum inward position.
    *   **Microcontroller:** Arduino or similar, controlling the motor, sensors, and a small display/status LED.
    *   **Power:** Rechargeable battery (USB-C) or disposable battery option.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  User inserts bag into the protector.
    2.  Bag Presence Sensor detects the bag.
    3.  Microcontroller activates the folding plates.
    4.  Folding plates move inward, folding the bag’s top/handles.
    5.  Compression plate lowers, gently compressing the contents.
    6.  Fold Completion Sensor confirms the folding process.
    7.  Status LED indicates completion (green) or error (red).
*   **Box Integration:**
    *   Standardized box designed to accept multiple ‘Origami-Boxes’ in a pre-defined pattern.
    *   Boxes have interlocking features to provide stability during shipping.
*   **Pseudocode (Microcontroller):**

```
// Initialization
sensor_init()
motor_init()
display_init()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    if (bag_present()) {
        display_message("Bag detected")
        fold_bag()
        compress_bag()
        display_message("Process complete")
        wait_for_next_bag()
    } else {
        display_message("Insert bag")
    }
}

// Function: fold_bag()
motor_activate(folding_plates, inward, speed)
wait_until(fold_complete_sensor)
motor_deactivate(folding_plates)

// Function: compress_bag()
motor_activate(compression_plate, downward, slow_speed)
wait(short_delay)
motor_activate(compression_plate, upward, slow_speed)

```

**Innovation:**

This system transforms the passive bag protector into an active packaging unit. It improves efficiency in fulfillment centers, reduces shipping volume, and enhances the presentation of delivered goods. It's a move towards automated, smart packaging.
