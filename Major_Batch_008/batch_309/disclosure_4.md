## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Profiling for Keyword Spotting

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple user statistics and contextual information to create dynamically updating acoustic scene profiles, influencing detection thresholds and ASR weighting. The system will learn and adapt to the *environment* the user is in, not just the user themselves.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Microphone array (minimum 4 microphones) for direction-of-arrival estimation and noise field analysis.
*   Edge TPU or equivalent for on-device acoustic scene classification.
*   Standard audio processing hardware (codec, amplifier, ADC).

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Classifier:** A deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN) trained on a large dataset of acoustic scenes (home, office, car, street, etc.).  Model outputs a probability distribution over a predefined set of acoustic scenes.
*   **Noise Field Analyzer:**  Analyzes the microphone array data to estimate the spatial distribution of noise sources. This provides information about the type and direction of noise. Utilizes beamforming and source localization techniques.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Module:**  This module receives the output of the Acoustic Scene Classifier and Noise Field Analyzer. Based on this information, it adjusts the detection thresholds and ASR weighting factors.
*   **Keyword Spotting Engine:** The existing keyword spotting engine from the base patent.
*   **ASR Engine:** The existing ASR engine from the base patent.
*   **User Profile Manager:** Maintains user-specific preferences and historical data.
*   **Contextual Data Integrator:** Integrates data from other sensors (e.g., GPS, accelerometer) to further refine the acoustic scene profile.

**3. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Environmental Analysis:** The microphone array continuously captures audio data. The Acoustic Scene Classifier identifies the most likely acoustic scene. The Noise Field Analyzer characterizes the noise environment.
2.  **Profile Creation:** A dynamic acoustic scene profile is created by combining the output of the Acoustic Scene Classifier, Noise Field Analyzer, User Profile Manager, and Contextual Data Integrator.
3.  **Threshold & Weighting Adjustment:** Based on the dynamic acoustic scene profile:
    *   The detection thresholds for the Keyword Spotting Engine are adjusted.  For example, in a noisy environment, the threshold may be raised.
    *   The weighting factors for the ASR Engine are adjusted. Certain acoustic features may be emphasized or de-emphasized based on the identified acoustic scene.
4.  **Keyword Detection & ASR:** The Keyword Spotting Engine and ASR Engine operate with the adjusted parameters.
5.  **Profile Learning:**  The system continuously learns from user interactions and environmental data to refine the acoustic scene profiles.  Reinforcement learning can be used to optimize the threshold and weighting parameters.

**4. Pseudocode (Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjust_thresholds(acoustic_scene, noise_field, user_profile, contextual_data):
  # Define base thresholds (from original patent)
  base_threshold = get_base_threshold(user_profile)

  # Apply scene-specific adjustments
  if acoustic_scene == "home":
    threshold_adjustment = 0.1
  elif acoustic_scene == "office":
    threshold_adjustment = 0.2
  elif acoustic_scene == "car":
    threshold_adjustment = 0.3
  else:
    threshold_adjustment = 0.0

  # Apply noise-level adjustments (from Noise Field Analyzer)
  noise_level = get_noise_level(noise_field)
  noise_adjustment = noise_level * 0.05  # Example scaling

  # Apply user preferences (from User Profile Manager)
  user_sensitivity = get_user_sensitivity(user_profile)
  sensitivity_adjustment = user_sensitivity * 0.02

  # Calculate new threshold
  new_threshold = base_threshold + threshold_adjustment + noise_adjustment + sensitivity_adjustment

  # Constrain threshold to acceptable range
  new_threshold = max(0.0, min(1.0, new_threshold))

  return new_threshold
```

**5. Future Considerations:**

*   Federated learning to share acoustic scene profiles across users without compromising privacy.
*   Active learning to intelligently request user feedback to improve acoustic scene classification.
*   Integration with smart home devices to predict acoustic scenes based on device usage.
*   Implement a dynamic cost function which takes into account context to avoid unnecessary false positives.
