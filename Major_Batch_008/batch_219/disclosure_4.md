## Adaptive Spatial Audio Beaconing

**Concept:** Utilizing the wireless earbud network as a dynamic spatial audio beaconing system for localized augmented reality experiences or precise indoor positioning. Building on the existing signal quality monitoring, the system will actively *shape* the audio experience to broadcast positional data.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Earbuds (primary & secondary) equipped with miniature, low-power ultrasonic transducers *in addition* to standard audio drivers.
    *   User device with compatible ultrasonic receiver (smartphone, AR glasses, dedicated receiver).
    *   Calibration suite – software on user device for initial spatial mapping & earbud positioning.

*   **Software – Earbud Firmware:**
    *   **Beacon Mode Selection:** Earbuds can be switched into "Beacon Mode" via user device app.
    *   **Spatial Encoding:** Algorithm that translates positional data (X, Y, Z coordinates, orientation) into a complex ultrasonic waveform, modulating amplitude/frequency.  This waveform will be overlaid *subsonically* onto the regular audio stream.
    *   **Signal Quality Feedback Loop:** Integrates existing signal quality data (RSSI, PER) to dynamically adjust beacon power & encoding scheme.  Low signal strength triggers a more robust, but lower data rate encoding.
    *   **Peer-to-Peer Relay:** If one earbud’s signal is obstructed, the system can leverage the other earbud (and potentially others in range) as a relay to re-broadcast the beacon.
    *   **Dynamic Frequency Allocation:** Multiple earbud networks in proximity will use a dynamic frequency allocation scheme to avoid interference.

*   **Software – User Device App/SDK:**
    *   **Beacon Decoding:** Algorithm to decode the ultrasonic waveform embedded in the audio stream.
    *   **Spatial Mapping:** Uses decoded positional data to create a real-time 3D map of the environment.
    *   **AR Integration:**  SDK for developers to integrate the spatial mapping data into AR applications.
    *   **Localization Engine:** Core module to calculate accurate positional data from multiple earbud beacons.

*   **Operation:**

    1.  User initiates Beacon Mode via app.
    2.  Earbuds begin broadcasting ultrasonic beacons overlaid onto their audio stream.
    3.  User device receives both audio and ultrasonic signals.
    4.  Decoding algorithm extracts positional data.
    5.  Localization engine refines position using data from both earbuds (and potentially relays).
    6.  AR applications utilize the spatial data to create immersive experiences.

    **Pseudocode (Localization Engine):**

    ```
    function calculatePosition(beaconData1, beaconData2) {
        // beaconData1 & beaconData2 contain decoded position & signal strength
        // Use trilateration or other localization algorithms
        distance1 = calculateDistance(beacon1.position, userDevice.position)
        distance2 = calculateDistance(beacon2.position, userDevice.position)

        // Weight distances based on signal strength (stronger signal = higher weight)
        weightedDistance1 = distance1 * (beacon1.signalStrength / (beacon1.signalStrength + beacon2.signalStrength))
        weightedDistance2 = distance2 * (beacon2.signalStrength / (beacon1.signalStrength + beacon2.signalStrength))

        // Combine weighted distances to estimate user device position
        estimatedPosition = (weightedDistance1 * beacon1.position + weightedDistance2 * beacon2.position) / (weightedDistance1 + weightedDistance2)

        return estimatedPosition
    }
    ```

*   **Potential Applications:**

    *   **Immersive AR gaming:**  Precise location tracking for AR characters and objects.
    *   **Indoor navigation:**  Turn-by-turn directions within buildings.
    *   **Asset tracking:**  Locating items within a warehouse or factory.
    *   **Gesture control:**  Using earbud location to detect hand gestures.
