## Adaptive Keyword Expansion via Contextual Embeddings

**Concept:** Extend keyword spotting beyond literal matches by dynamically expanding the keyword search space based on contextual understanding of the audio stream. This system utilizes pre-trained language models to generate semantically similar phrases ("keyword expansions") *on the fly*, and incorporates these expansions into the keyword spotting process.

**Specs:**

1.  **Contextual Embedding Generator:**
    *   Input: Audio segment (e.g., 2-5 seconds) preceding the current analysis window.
    *   Process:
        *   Speech-to-text conversion of the input audio segment.
        *   Embedding generation using a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, Wav2Vec 2.0 fine-tuned on a large corpus of speech data).
        *   Query generation: Utilize the embedding to query a vector database containing known keywords and associated semantic expansions.
        *   Expansion selection: Return a weighted list of keyword expansions ranked by semantic similarity and a confidence score. (e.g. "turn on" -> "activate", "switch on", "begin").
    *   Output: A dynamic list of keyword expansions, each associated with a confidence score.

2.  **Hybrid Keyword Spotting Engine:**
    *   Input: Feature vectors from the current audio analysis window, the defined keyword, and the dynamic list of keyword expansions from the Contextual Embedding Generator.
    *   Process:
        *   Parallel keyword scoring: Simultaneously evaluate the likelihood of the feature vectors matching the original keyword *and* each of the keyword expansions. Utilize HMMs or other scoring methods as in the reference patent, but apply them to all targets.
        *   Weighted score aggregation: Combine the individual scores for the keyword and expansions, weighting each expansionâ€™s score by its confidence from the Contextual Embedding Generator.
        *   Adaptive Thresholding: Dynamically adjust the detection threshold based on the combined score distribution.  Higher confidence expansions can contribute to a lower overall threshold, increasing sensitivity.
    *   Output: Detection signal indicating a potential keyword match, along with confidence scores for the original keyword and its expansions.

3.  **Feedback Loop & Refinement:**
    *   Monitor detection accuracy over time.
    *   Use confirmed keyword detections to refine the Contextual Embedding Generator.  Reinforce embeddings of successful expansions.
    *   Adjust weighting parameters in the Weighted Score Aggregation based on observed performance.

**Pseudocode (Hybrid Keyword Spotting Engine):**

```
function detectKeyword(featureVectors, keyword, keywordExpansions):
  keywordScore = score(featureVectors, keyword)
  expansionScores = []
  for expansion in keywordExpansions:
    expansionScore = score(featureVectors, expansion) * expansion.confidence
    expansionScores.append(expansionScore)

  combinedScore = keywordScore + sum(expansionScores)
  
  threshold = dynamicThreshold() // Function based on score distribution
  
  if combinedScore > threshold:
    return true, combinedScore
  else:
    return false, combinedScore
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance CPU/GPU for embedding generation and scoring.
*   Large RAM for storing vector databases and language models.
*   Dedicated accelerator for vector similarity search.
