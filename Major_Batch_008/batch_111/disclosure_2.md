## Dynamic Category Weighting via User Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the categorization service to dynamically adjust category weights based on real-time user interaction *after* initial categorization. This moves beyond static relevance scoring to a learning system responsive to user behavior.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Initial Categorization:** The existing patent's categorization process is used as a baseline. An item is categorized with a primary and secondary category (as described in the patent).

2.  **Post-Categorization Interaction Tracking:**
    *   **Click-Through Data:** Track user clicks on items within specific categories. Higher click-through rates within a category signal increased user interest.
    *   **"Not Interested" Feedback:** Implement a "Not Interested" button/feature.  This explicitly signals a miscategorization or irrelevant category.
    *   **"Similar Items" Requests:**  Track requests for “similar items” after viewing a categorized item. The categories of those similar items become positive signals.
    *   **Purchase Data:** Purchases within a category represent strong positive signals.
    *   **Time Spent Viewing:** Track the amount of time a user spends viewing items within a given category.

3.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    // Variables:
    // item: The item being categorized
    // primaryCategory: Initial primary category assigned
    // secondaryCategory: Initial secondary category assigned
    // interactionData:  Collected user interaction data (clicks, "Not Interested", purchases, etc.)
    // categoryWeights:  A dictionary storing weights for each category (initialized based on initial categorization relevance)
    // learningRate: A parameter controlling the speed of weight adjustment

    function adjustCategoryWeights(item, primaryCategory, secondaryCategory, interactionData, categoryWeights, learningRate):
      // Calculate score adjustments based on interaction data

      clickScoreAdjustment = calculateClickScore(interactionData, primaryCategory, secondaryCategory)
      notInterestedScoreAdjustment = calculateNotInterestedScore(interactionData, primaryCategory, secondaryCategory)
      purchaseScoreAdjustment = calculatePurchaseScore(interactionData, primaryCategory, secondaryCategory)
      timeSpentScoreAdjustment = calculateTimeSpentScore(interactionData, primaryCategory, secondaryCategory)

      // Update Category Weights
      categoryWeights[primaryCategory] += learningRate * (clickScoreAdjustment + purchaseScoreAdjustment + timeSpentScoreAdjustment - notInterestedScoreAdjustment)
      categoryWeights[secondaryCategory] += learningRate * (clickScoreAdjustment + purchaseScoreAdjustment + timeSpentScoreAdjustment - notInterestedScoreAdjustment)

      // Normalize Category Weights (to ensure they sum to 1)
      totalWeight = sum(categoryWeights.values())
      for category in categoryWeights:
          categoryWeights[category] /= totalWeight

      return categoryWeights
    ```

4.  **Recategorization Trigger:** Implement a threshold for category weight changes. If a category’s weight increases or decreases significantly (exceeding a predefined threshold), trigger a recategorization process using the updated weights. This could involve re-evaluating relevance against the category hierarchy, potentially promoting a secondary category to primary, or introducing new candidate categories.

5. **User Profile Integration:** Store individual user interaction data to personalize category weights. This creates a user-specific categorization profile, improving relevance over time.

6.  **A/B Testing Framework:** Implement an A/B testing framework to continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the dynamic weighting algorithm and optimize the learning rate, thresholds, and other parameters.
