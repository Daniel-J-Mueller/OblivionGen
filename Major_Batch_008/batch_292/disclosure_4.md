## Adaptive Multi-Modal Emotional Response System

**Concept:** Enhance dialog management by integrating real-time emotional analysis of user speech and dynamically adjusting system responses not just in *content*, but also in multi-modal presentation style—specifically, synthesizing facial expressions on a virtual avatar displayed alongside audio output.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Modules:**

*   **Emotional Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Audio stream (user utterance).
    *   Processing:
        *   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) – Convert audio to text.
        *   Sentiment Analysis – Determine emotional tone (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral).  Utilize a multi-layered model incorporating lexical analysis, prosodic features (pitch, tone, rhythm), and potentially facial expression analysis if a camera is present.
        *   Emotion Intensity Score: Assign a numerical value representing the strength of the detected emotion (0-100).
    *   Output: Emotion label, intensity score.

*   **Avatar Control Module:**
    *   Input: Emotion label, intensity score.
    *   Processing:
        *   Facial Expression Synthesis:  Employ a parametric facial animation system (e.g., blendshapes) to generate a corresponding facial expression on a 3D avatar.  Map emotion labels and intensity scores to specific blendshape weights.  Include micro-expressions for realism.
        *   Lip Sync:  Synchronize avatar lip movements with the synthesized speech output.
        *   Gaze Control:  Adjust avatar gaze direction to simulate attention and engagement.
        *   Head Pose: Subtle head movements and tilts to reflect emotional state.
    *   Output: Avatar animation data.

*   **Multi-Modal Output Manager:**
    *   Input: Text response (from dialog manager), avatar animation data.
    *   Processing:
        *   Text-to-Speech (TTS): Synthesize audio from text response.  Modulate TTS parameters (pitch, speed, intonation) based on detected user emotion.
        *   Avatar Rendering: Render the 3D avatar with the generated animation.
        *   Synchronized Output:  Synchronize audio and visual output.
    *   Output: Audio stream, video stream (avatar).

**II. System Architecture:**

```
[User Audio] --> [Emotional Analysis Module] --> [Emotion Label, Intensity]
                                                      |
                                                      V
[Dialog Manager] --> [Text Response] --> [Multi-Modal Output Manager] --> [Audio Stream, Video Stream (Avatar)] --> [User]
```

**III. Pseudocode (Multi-Modal Output Manager):**

```
function generate_response(text_response, emotion_label, intensity_score):
  audio_params = adjust_tts_params(emotion_label, intensity_score)
  audio_stream = tts(text_response, audio_params)

  avatar_animation = generate_avatar_animation(emotion_label, intensity_score)

  synchronized_output = combine(audio_stream, avatar_animation)
  return synchronized_output

function generate_avatar_animation(emotion_label, intensity_score):
  blendshape_weights = map_emotion_to_blendshapes(emotion_label, intensity_score)
  apply_blendshapes(avatar_model, blendshape_weights)
  update_gaze_direction(avatar_model, user_focus)
  return animated_avatar_model
```

**IV. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Microphone for capturing user audio.
*   Processing unit with sufficient resources for running ASR, sentiment analysis, TTS, and 3D rendering.
*   Display for rendering the avatar.
*   Optional: Camera for capturing user facial expressions (to augment emotion analysis).

**V. Novelty:**

Existing systems typically focus on *what* is said, not *how* it is said in a multi-modal way. This concept aims to dynamically tailor the system's visual *presentation* to mirror and respond to the user's emotional state, creating a more empathetic and engaging interaction.  The synchronization of audio modulation with visual presentation is key.
