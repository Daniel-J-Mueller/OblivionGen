## Dynamic Secret Fragmentation & Distribution

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of storing secondary secrets in disparate memory locations by *fragmenting* secrets and distributing those fragments across multiple physically separate storage mediums, including potentially ephemeral sources. This isnâ€™t just about redundancy, but about actively hindering complete secret reconstruction even with full system compromise.

**Specification:**

**1. Secret Fragmentation Module:**

*   **Input:** A primary session secret (e.g., 256-bit AES key).
*   **Process:**
    *   Split the primary secret into *n* fragments. Fragment size is configurable, but ideally small enough to be individually meaningless.
    *   Apply a strong, pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded with a unique session ID and a derived key (HKDF) to determine the distribution scheme.
    *   Each fragment is then encrypted with a unique, ephemeral key derived from the PRNG output.
*   **Output:** A set of *n* encrypted fragments.

**2. Distribution Manager:**

*   **Storage Mediums:**
    *   Volatile RAM (traditional)
    *   RAM Disk (as in the patent)
    *   NVRAM/Flash Memory (persistent, low-latency)
    *   Network-attached ephemeral storage (e.g., temporary cloud buckets with short TTLs)
    *   CPU Registers (for ultra-short-term, performance-critical fragments)
*   **Distribution Logic:**
    *   The Distribution Manager, guided by the PRNG output, assigns each fragment to a storage medium.
    *   The assignment scheme can prioritize:
        *   **Diversity:** Spreading fragments across as many different mediums as possible.
        *   **Performance:** Placing frequently accessed fragments on faster mediums.
        *   **Ephemerality:** Using short-lived mediums to minimize long-term attack surface.
*   **Redundancy:** The number of fragments *n* is greater than the number of required fragments to reconstruct the secret (e.g., a (k,n) threshold scheme).

**3. Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Trigger:** Activation of the secondary secret, or a security event.
*   **Process:**
    *   The Reconstruction Module identifies the storage locations of the required fragments.
    *   Retrieves the fragments.
    *   Decrypts the fragments using derived keys (based on session ID and shared secret).
    *   Reassembles the original secret.
*   **Quorum:** A minimum number of fragments must be successfully reconstructed to proceed. If quorum is not met, the session is terminated.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Module):**

```
function reconstruct_secret(session_id, shared_secret, fragment_locations):
  required_fragments = k // Threshold
  reconstructed_fragments = []

  for location in fragment_locations:
    try:
      fragment = read_fragment(location)
      decrypted_fragment = decrypt(fragment, derive_key(session_id, shared_secret))
      reconstructed_fragments.append(decrypted_fragment)
    except:
      // Log error, fragment unavailable
      continue

  if len(reconstructed_fragments) >= required_fragments:
    secret = assemble_secret(reconstructed_fragments)
    return secret
  else:
    // Quorum not met, terminate session
    terminate_session()
    return null
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple redundancy by introducing dynamic fragmentation and distribution to disparate mediums. The ephemeral storage component dramatically increases the difficulty of long-term key compromise.  The use of a threshold scheme ensures availability even with partial storage failure or compromise.
