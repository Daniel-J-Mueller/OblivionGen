## Dynamic Retail Environment Projection System

**Concept:** Augment the portable device’s display functionality by projecting interactive elements *onto* the physical retail environment, triggered by machine-readable code interaction.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Portable Device: Existing device with electronic display, GPS, and wireless transceiver (as in the provided patent).
    *   Micro-Projector Module:  Integrated, low-power micro-projector capable of projecting onto surfaces within a 1-3 meter range.  Must support keystone correction and focus adjustment via software. Resolution: 720p minimum.  Brightness: Adjustable, 10-50 lumens.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: Integrated sensor to dynamically adjust projector brightness and contrast.
    *   Depth Sensor: Short-range depth sensor (ToF or structured light) to map the immediate surrounding environment for accurate projection alignment and occlusion handling.
*   **Software:**
    *   Environment Mapping: Upon device activation (or user request), the depth sensor generates a real-time 3D mesh of the surrounding environment. This mesh is used for projection mapping.
    *   Code-Triggered Projection: The device monitors for code scans (from either the device display or an external scanner). Each code is associated with a specific projection "layer" or "experience."
    *   Projection Layers: Projection layers are pre-designed visual augmentations of the retail environment. Examples include:
        *   Product Information Overlays:  Projecting detailed specs, reviews, or comparison data onto the physical product.
        *   Interactive Guides: Projecting step-by-step assembly instructions directly onto the parts being assembled.
        *   Virtual Try-On: Projecting virtual clothing or accessories onto the user’s reflection (using the device’s camera and the projected surface as a combined display).
        *   Navigation Aids: Projecting directional arrows onto the floor to guide users to specific items.
    *   Dynamic Content Server Integration:  The device connects to a central server that delivers updated projection content based on product catalogs, user preferences, and real-time promotions.
    *   User Input Handling:  The device utilizes touch input (on the screen) and gesture recognition (via the camera) to allow users to interact with the projected content.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified Projection Layer Activation):**

```
FUNCTION ActivateProjectionLayer(ScannedCode)
  // Retrieve associated Projection Layer ID from code lookup table
  ProjectionLayerID = LookupCode(ScannedCode)

  IF ProjectionLayerID != NULL THEN
    // Load Projection Layer Data from server
    ProjectionData = DownloadProjectionData(ProjectionLayerID)

    // Align Projection Data to detected environment mesh
    AlignedData = ProjectEnvironment(ProjectionData, EnvironmentMesh)

    // Activate Micro-Projector
    ActivateProjector()

    // Display AlignedData on projected surface
    DisplayProjection(AlignedData)
  ELSE
    DisplayErrorMessage("Invalid Code")
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Operational Flow:**
    1.  User activates the app on the portable device.
    2.  Device scans the environment to create a 3D mesh.
    3.  User scans a product barcode or QR code.
    4.  The device transmits the code to a server.
    5.  The server returns the associated projection layer data.
    6.  The device projects the data onto the relevant surface.
    7.  User interacts with the projected content using the device’s touchscreen or gestures.
    8.  Purchase is initiated (leveraging existing machine-readable code infrastructure).
