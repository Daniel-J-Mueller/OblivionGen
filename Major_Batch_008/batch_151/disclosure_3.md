## Dynamic Peripheral Power Allocation based on Hibernation History

**Concept:** The patent details a system for managing device hibernation to extend the life of non-volatile memory. This inspires a system for *dynamically* allocating power to peripherals based on a device’s hibernation/sleep history, aiming to balance power savings with peripheral responsiveness. The system learns usage patterns *around* sleep states and pre-emptively adjusts peripheral power.

**Specification:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Power Management Unit (PMU):** Enhanced PMU capable of granular power control over individual peripherals.
*   **Usage Monitor:** Dedicated hardware or software component to track peripheral usage frequency & duration.
*   **Non-Volatile Memory (NVM):** Used to store historical usage data and learned power profiles.
*   **Predictive Algorithm Engine (PAE):**  A dedicated processing unit (or software component leveraging existing CPU/GPU) responsible for running the predictive algorithms.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Usage Data Collector:** Logs peripheral activation times, durations, and associated context (e.g., application running). Data is timestamped.
*   **Hibernation/Sleep Event Logger:**  Records all hibernation/sleep entry and exit events. Captures duration of sleep.
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** (See Algorithm Details Below).
*   **Power Allocation Controller:**  Adjusts power levels to peripherals based on the Predictive Algorithm output.

**3. Algorithm Details (Predictive Algorithm):**

*   **Data Collection Phase:** For an initial ‘learning’ period (e.g., 1 week), collect data on peripheral usage immediately before *and* after hibernation/sleep cycles.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Calculate the following features for each peripheral:
    *   `ActivationFrequency`: How often is the peripheral activated within a defined time window (e.g., 1 hour)?
    *   `ActivationDuration`: Average duration of peripheral activation.
    *   `SleepRecoveryTime`: Time elapsed between waking from sleep and first peripheral activation.
    *   `HibernationProximityActivationRate`: Activation rate of the peripheral within a short time window *before* entering hibernation.
*   **Model Training:** Train a simple machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree) to predict the probability of peripheral activation within a short time window after waking from sleep, based on the extracted features. This model is stored in NVM.
*   **Dynamic Power Allocation:**
    1.  Upon waking from sleep, the Predictive Algorithm calculates the predicted activation probability for each peripheral.
    2.  Based on the probability, the Power Allocation Controller adjusts the power state:
        *   **High Probability (e.g., > 0.7):**  Peripheral remains in a fully powered or low-power ‘ready’ state.
        *   **Medium Probability (e.g., 0.3 - 0.7):** Peripheral enters a deeper sleep state with a fast wake-up time.
        *   **Low Probability (e.g., < 0.3):** Peripheral is completely powered off.
    3.  The system continuously monitors peripheral activation after waking from sleep and updates the model weights using online learning techniques.

**4. Pseudocode (Power Allocation Controller):**

```
FOR each Peripheral in Device:
    probability = PredictiveAlgorithm(Peripheral.UsageData)
    IF probability > 0.7:
        Peripheral.PowerState = "Ready"
    ELSE IF probability >= 0.3 AND probability <= 0.7:
        Peripheral.PowerState = "FastSleep"
    ELSE:
        Peripheral.PowerState = "Off"

//Continuous Monitoring and Learning:
ON Peripheral Activation:
    Update PredictiveAlgorithm model with new usage data
```

**5. Considerations:**

*   **Peripheral Categories:**  Different peripherals may require different power states and wake-up times. The system should support customization.
*   **User Override:** Allow users to manually override the power allocation settings.
*   **Thermal Management:**  Consider the thermal implications of dynamically adjusting peripheral power.
*   **Energy Budget:** Integrate with a system-level energy management framework to ensure that the dynamic power allocation does not exceed the device’s energy budget.
