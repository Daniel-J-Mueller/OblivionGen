## Dynamic Resource Prioritization via Client-Reported Network Conditions

**Specification:** Implement a system that allows client devices to proactively report their current network conditions (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) to the CDN. This data is used to dynamically adjust resource prioritization and delivery strategies *before* a request is fully processed.

**Components:**

*   **Client SDK:** A lightweight SDK embedded in client applications.
*   **Network Condition Reporter:**  Part of the Client SDK. Periodically (configurable interval, e.g., 5-10 seconds) measures and reports network conditions.  Data reported includes:
    *   Download Bandwidth (kbps)
    *   Upload Bandwidth (kbps)
    *   Round Trip Time (RTT) – average latency to a known CDN endpoint.
    *   Packet Loss (%) – estimated based on TCP acknowledgements or ICMP probes (configurable).
    *   Connection Type (WiFi, Cellular, Ethernet)
*   **CDN Edge Server – Network Condition Ingestion Module:** Receives network condition reports from clients.  Stores a rolling history of network conditions associated with each client IP address (or client ID, if available). Uses a time-to-live (TTL) to expire stale data.
*   **Resource Prioritization Engine:** Resides on the CDN edge server.  Queries the Network Condition Ingestion Module to retrieve the latest network conditions for the client initiating the request.
*   **Dynamic Resource Adjustment Policies:** Configurable rules that define how network conditions impact resource delivery. Examples:
    *   **Low Bandwidth:** Serve lower-resolution images/videos, compress content more aggressively, prioritize text content.
    *   **High Latency:** Prefetch critical resources, reduce the number of HTTP requests, use HTTP/3.
    *   **High Packet Loss:** Use a more robust content encoding scheme (e.g., FEC – Forward Error Correction), retransmit failed requests more aggressively.
*   **Real-time Resource Adaptation:** CDN dynamically selects which content to deliver based on the prioritized rules.

**Pseudocode (Resource Prioritization Engine):**

```
function prioritizeResource(request, clientIP):
  networkConditions = getNetworkConditions(clientIP)
  if networkConditions == null:
    // Use default settings
    return getDefaultResource(request)

  bandwidth = networkConditions.bandwidth
  latency = networkConditions.latency
  packetLoss = networkConditions.packetLoss

  if bandwidth < 500kbps:
    resource = selectLowResolutionImage(request.resourceID)
  elif latency > 200ms:
    prefetchCriticalResources(request.resourceID)
    resource = request.resourceID //Use requested resource, but prefetch dependencies
  elif packetLoss > 5%:
    resource = applyFEC(request.resourceID) // Apply Forward Error Correction
  else:
    resource = request.resourceID // Serve requested resource

  return resource
```

**Data Store:**

*   Key: Client IP Address (or Client ID)
*   Value:  JSON object containing network condition data (bandwidth, latency, packet loss, connection type, timestamp)

**Benefits:**

*   Proactive adaptation to network conditions, resulting in a better user experience.
*   Reduced buffering and faster page load times.
*   Improved content delivery efficiency by serving the appropriate content for each client's network.
*   Increased client satisfaction and engagement.
