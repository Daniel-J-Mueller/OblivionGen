## Dynamic Service Shadowing & Predictive Debugging

**Concept:** Extend the debug-requested mechanism to not only *capture* data during debugging but to *proactively* shadow service executions, building a predictive model of expected behavior. This allows for identifying anomalies *before* they become critical errors, and even preemptively debugging based on predicted issues.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Mode Activation:**

*   Introduce a new debug request parameter: `shadow-mode`.
*   When `shadow-mode` is activated, the service provider initiates a parallel, “shadow” execution of the service request *without* immediately returning a response to the client.
*   The shadow execution utilizes the same logic as the primary execution but writes all intermediate data (inputs, outputs, internal state changes) to a dedicated “shadow store”.
*   Primary execution continues normally, providing the client with the expected response.

**2. Shadow Store & Data Collection:**

*   The shadow store is a time-series database optimized for high-volume, low-latency writes.
*   Data collected in the shadow store includes:
    *   API call inputs/outputs.
    *   Internal function call timings.
    *   Memory allocations/deallocations.
    *   CPU utilization per function.
    *   External service call timings.
*   Each data point is tagged with:
    *   Unique call ID (from the original request).
    *   Service name.
    *   Timestamp.
    *   Server/instance ID.

**3. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   A separate engine processes the data from the shadow store.
*   Utilizes time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future values of key metrics (e.g., response time, memory usage).
*   Establishes baseline behavior for each service based on historical shadow data.
*   Defines anomaly thresholds based on deviations from the baseline.

**4. Anomaly Detection & Preemptive Debugging:**

*   The predictive modeling engine continuously monitors incoming shadow data for anomalies.
*   When an anomaly is detected:
    *   An alert is triggered.
    *   The system automatically initiates a “focused debugging session” based on the anomaly.
        *   This may involve:
            *   Activating detailed logging for the affected service.
            *   Capturing core dumps.
            *   Spawning a dedicated debugger instance.
*   Optionally, the system can “rollback” the service request to a known-good state.

**5. Adaptive Shadowing:**

*   Implement a feedback loop to adapt the shadowing process.
*   If the predictive model consistently identifies false positives, reduce the granularity of data collection.
*   If the model fails to detect critical issues, increase the granularity.
*   Consider prioritizing shadowing for specific services or endpoints based on historical failure rates.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(serviceName, metricName, currentValue, predictedValue, threshold):
  deviation = abs(currentValue - predictedValue)
  if deviation > threshold:
    anomalyDetected = true
    log("Anomaly detected: " + serviceName + " - " + metricName + " - Current: " + currentValue + " - Predicted: " + predictedValue)
    triggerDebugSession(serviceName)
  else:
    anomalyDetected = false
  return anomalyDetected
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-throughput time-series database.
*   Sufficient memory and processing power to run the predictive modeling engine.
*   Dedicated network bandwidth for shadow data transfer.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Integration with existing service monitoring and logging infrastructure.
*   Machine learning libraries for time-series forecasting.
*   API for triggering debugging sessions.
