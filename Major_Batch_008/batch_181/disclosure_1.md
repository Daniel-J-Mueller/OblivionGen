## Dynamic Column Masking & Behavioral Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the granular access control beyond tables/views/schemas to *behavioral* access control at the column level, coupled with dynamic column masking based on user role *and* session activity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Generation:**

*   **Data Source:** Integrate with existing audit logs (query history, data modification timestamps, user login patterns) and potentially real-time session monitoring.
*   **Profile Attributes:** Generate user/group profiles based on:
    *   Frequency of access to specific columns.
    *   Types of queries executed (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, aggregations).
    *   Time of day access occurs.
    *   Data sensitivity tags assigned to columns (defined by data owners).
*   **Profile Storage:** Profiles stored as JSON documents, indexed for rapid retrieval.  Example:

    ```json
    {
        "user_id": "12345",
        "group": "analysts",
        "column_access_history": {
            "orders.order_id": { "access_count": 100, "last_accessed": "2024-10-27T14:00:00Z", "query_types": ["SELECT", "JOIN"] },
            "customers.credit_card": { "access_count": 0, "last_accessed": null, "query_types": [] }
        },
        "data_sensitivity_overrides": {
            "customers.credit_card": "masked",
            "orders.order_total": "redacted if accessed outside business hours"
        }
    }
    ```

**2. Dynamic Column Masking Engine:**

*   **Integration Point:** Intercept database queries *before* execution.
*   **Masking Strategies:** Support multiple masking strategies:
    *   **Full Masking:** Replace data with a fixed value (e.g., ‘XXXXX’).
    *   **Partial Masking:** Display only a portion of the data (e.g., last four digits of a credit card).
    *   **Redaction:** Remove the column entirely from the result set.
    *   **Substitution:** Replace sensitive data with a synthetic but representative value.
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypt column values, decryptable only by authorized users.
*   **Policy Evaluation:**  Determine masking strategy based on:
    *   User/Group Profile (from Behavioral Profile Generation).
    *   Column Sensitivity Tag.
    *   Time of Day.
    *   Query Type (preventing access to sensitive columns in certain query types like ‘DELETE’).
*   **Query Modification:**  Modify the original query to apply the masking strategy.  This could involve rewriting the SQL or utilizing database-specific masking features.

**3. Adaptive Access Control API:**

*   **`check_access(user_id, table_name, column_name, query_type)`:** Returns a boolean indicating whether the user has access to the column for the specified query type.
*   **`get_masking_strategy(user_id, table_name, column_name, query_type)`:** Returns the appropriate masking strategy for the column, based on the user's profile and data sensitivity.
*   **`update_profile(user_id, table_name, column_name, query_type)`:** Updates the user's access profile based on their activity.

**Pseudocode (Query Interception & Masking):**

```
function intercept_query(query, user_id):
  parse_query(query)
  for each column in query.columns:
    masking_strategy = get_masking_strategy(user_id, query.table, column.name, query.type)
    if masking_strategy != "none":
      apply_masking(query, column, masking_strategy)
  return modified_query
```

**Innovation:**  This moves beyond static role-based access control to a system that *learns* user behavior and adapts access control policies accordingly. It protects sensitive data not just based on *who* you are, but *how* you are accessing it. This offers a dynamic layer of security and minimizes data exposure based on real-time user context.  Furthermore, the dynamic nature addresses the issue of 'stale' role definitions which become inaccurate over time.
