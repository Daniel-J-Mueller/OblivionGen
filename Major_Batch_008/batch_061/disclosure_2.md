## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalization

**Concept:** Expand the directional audio processing beyond echo cancellation to actively *reconstruct* the acoustic scene, personalized to the user's hearing profile and preferences. The system will analyze incoming audio not just to isolate speech, but to model the environment – identifying materials, distances, and sound reflections – then synthesize a customized auditory experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Microphone Array: Minimum 8 element array, high SNR, wide frequency response (20Hz – 20kHz).
    *   Processing Unit: Dedicated DSP or FPGA for real-time processing.  Capable of running complex beamforming algorithms and acoustic modeling.
    *   Head Tracking: Integrated head tracking system (IMU/camera) to dynamically adjust the acoustic reconstruction based on user head orientation.
    *   Bone Conduction Transducers: Integrated bone conduction transducers for supplemental, personalized sound delivery, especially beneficial for users with some hearing loss.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Advanced Beamforming:**  Beyond simple directional filtering. Employ spherical microphone arrays and algorithms like deconvolution-based beamforming for high-resolution sound source localization and separation.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Modeling:**
        *   **Material Identification:** Machine learning model (trained on acoustic signatures) to identify materials in the environment (wood, glass, carpet, etc.).
        *   **Room Impulse Response (RIR) Estimation:**  Algorithm to estimate the RIR for different locations within the room.
        *   **Sound Reflection Mapping:** Create a dynamic map of sound reflections based on material identification and RIR estimation.
    *   **Personalized Audio Synthesis:**
        *   **Hearing Profile Integration:**  User-defined or audiometrically-measured hearing profile (frequency response, threshold levels).
        *   **Customizable Auditory Rendering:** Algorithms to render the synthesized audio based on the hearing profile and user preferences (e.g., emphasize certain frequencies, reduce reverberation, enhance spatial cues).
        *   **Binaural Rendering:**  Use head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) personalized to the user to create a realistic 3D audio experience.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:** System learns the user’s preferences and the acoustic characteristics of their environment over time.  Machine learning models continuously refine the acoustic scene model and audio synthesis algorithms.
