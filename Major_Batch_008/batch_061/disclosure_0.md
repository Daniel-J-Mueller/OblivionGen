## Dynamic Action Graph Generation & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the video analysis to not just *identify* actions, but to build a probabilistic dynamic graph of possible future actions based on observed sequences. This allows for predictive search – finding videos not just *similar* to what’s been seen, but likely to *continue* from it.

**Specs:**

1.  **Action Unit Definition:** Define a library of "Action Units" – discrete, fundamental movements or interactions (e.g., "grasping", "walking towards", "looking at"). These are the building blocks of more complex actions.
2.  **Temporal Segmentation:**  Video frames are segmented into Action Unit instances. Utilize the existing shape/angle detection but expand it to track deformation *over time*, defining velocity and acceleration vectors for each identified shape.
3.  **Dynamic Graph Construction:** A directed graph is created where:
    *   Nodes represent Action Units.
    *   Edges represent the probability of transitioning from one Action Unit to another, learned from a large training dataset. Edge weight = P(Action Unit B | Action Unit A).
4.  **Sequence Embedding:**  Observed video sequences are converted into paths through the dynamic graph. The path represents the sequence of Action Units detected.
5.  **Future Action Prediction:**  Given an observed path, predict future actions by:
    *   Traversing the graph from the end of the observed path.
    *   Calculating the probability of reaching each node (Action Unit) within a specified time horizon.
    *   Rank potential future actions based on probability.
6.  **Probabilistic Search Query:**  A search query isn’t just a video, but a *probability distribution* over future actions.
7.  **Video Scoring:** Videos are scored based on how well their Action Unit sequences match the predicted probability distribution. Higher probability actions that occur in a retrieved video yield a higher score.
8.  **Adaptive Learning:** The dynamic graph is continuously updated as new videos are processed, refining the probabilities of action transitions.

**Pseudocode (Search Function):**

```
function search(referenceVideo, timeHorizon) {
  // 1. Analyze referenceVideo to extract Action Unit sequence
  referenceSequence = analyzeVideo(referenceVideo)

  // 2. Traverse dynamic graph from end of referenceSequence
  futureActionProbabilities = traverseGraph(referenceSequence, timeHorizon)

  // 3.  Retrieve candidate videos from library
  candidateVideos = retrieveVideos()

  // 4. Score each candidate video
  for each candidateVideo in candidateVideos {
    candidateSequence = analyzeVideo(candidateVideo)
    score = 0
    for each action in candidateSequence {
      if (action exists in futureActionProbabilities) {
        score += futureActionProbabilities[action]
      }
    }
    candidateVideo.score = score
  }

  // 5. Sort candidate videos by score
  sortedVideos = sort(candidateVideos, score)

  return sortedVideos
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance GPUs for real-time video analysis and graph traversal.
*   Large RAM for storing the dynamic graph and video data.
*   Fast storage for efficient data access.

**Potential Downstream Applications:**

*   Proactive content recommendation.
*   Automated video editing.
*   Robotics and autonomous systems.
*   Predictive surveillance.
