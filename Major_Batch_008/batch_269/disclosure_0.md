## Haptic Echo Cancellation & Directional Sound Sculpting

**Concept:** Integrate haptic feedback with the voice assistant's echo cancellation and directional sound features to create a localized, immersive audio experience and improve speech recognition accuracy in noisy environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Haptic Transducers:** Array of miniature, high-frequency haptic transducers integrated into the housing's exterior, specifically around the base and top sections. These are not for 'touch' but for subtle vibration modulation of the air.
*   **Air Cavities:** A network of precisely engineered air cavities within the housing, connected to both the speaker system and the haptic transducers. These cavities allow for controlled air pressure modulation.
*   **Microphone Array Enhancement:** Existing microphone array supplemented with a short-range ultrasonic microphone to better define the acoustic space directly around the device.
*   **Processing Unit Augmentation:** Dedicated processing core for real-time haptic and acoustic data processing.

**2. Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

*   **Echo Cancellation Enhancement:** Existing echo cancellation algorithms modified to incorporate haptic feedback.
    *   When an echo is detected, the algorithm triggers the haptic transducers to create a localized, counter-phase vibration in the air around the device. This creates a destructive interference pattern that *physically* cancels a portion of the echo before it reaches the microphones.
    *   Intensity of haptic feedback is dynamically adjusted based on echo amplitude and frequency.
*   **Directional Sound Sculpting:** Algorithm to shape the sound field emanating from the speaker(s).
    *   The algorithm uses the air cavities and speaker array to create localized 'sweet spots' of high audio fidelity.
    *   The cavities act as acoustic lenses, focusing sound waves in specific directions.
    *   Haptic transducers modulate air pressure within the cavities to fine-tune the sound field, creating a more immersive and directional audio experience.
*   **Acoustic Space Mapping:** Algorithm that uses data from the ultrasonic microphone to create a real-time map of the acoustic environment around the device. This map is used to optimize both echo cancellation and directional sound sculpting.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** System learns user preferences and adapts the haptic and acoustic parameters to provide a personalized audio experience.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
mapAcousticSpace() // Create initial map of acoustic environment
setHapticBaseline() // Establish baseline haptic feedback level

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    audioData = receiveAudioData()
    echoElement = identifyEcho(audioData)
    backgroundNoise = identifyBackgroundNoise(audioData)
    doubleTalk = identifyDoubleTalk(audioData)

    isolatedAudioData = cancelNoise(audioData, echoElement, backgroundNoise, doubleTalk)

    // Haptic Feedback Integration
    hapticIntensity = calculateHapticIntensity(echoElement)
    triggerHapticFeedback(hapticIntensity)

    // Directional Sound Sculpting
    sweetSpotCoordinates = determineSweetSpot(userPosition)
    adjustAcousticLenses(sweetSpotCoordinates)
    outputAudio(isolatedAudioData)
}
```

**4. Housing Considerations:**

*   Material: Use a rigid, non-resonant material to minimize unwanted vibrations.
*   Air Cavity Integration: Design the housing to seamlessly integrate the air cavity network.
*   Haptic Transducer Placement: Carefully position the haptic transducers to maximize their effectiveness.
*   Acoustic Transparency: Optimize the housing's shape and materials to ensure optimal sound transmission.
