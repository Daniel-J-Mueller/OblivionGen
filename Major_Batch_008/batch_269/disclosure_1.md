## Adaptive Data Lineage & Predictive Schema Evolution

**Concept:** Augment the data store optimization with a dynamic data lineage tracking system and a predictive schema evolution engine.  The goal is to not just *react* to performance issues, but *anticipate* them based on data flow and usage patterns, proactively adjusting the data store structure *before* performance degradation occurs.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Lineage Capture Module:**

*   **Function:**  Monitor and record the complete lifecycle of data within the data store. This includes:
    *   Data source (ingestion point)
    *   Transformations applied (SQL, ETL processes, etc.)
    *   Data dependencies (tables/columns used in calculations)
    *   Data consumers (reports, applications, users)
*   **Implementation:** Employ a graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) to represent data lineage. Each node represents a data element (table, column, process) and edges represent relationships (e.g., "uses", "transforms", "depends on").
*   **Data Capture Methods:**
    *   **SQL Parsing:** Intercept and parse SQL queries to identify data dependencies.
    *   **ETL Metadata:** Extract lineage information from ETL tool metadata.
    *   **API Monitoring:** Track data access patterns through APIs.

**2. Predictive Schema Evolution Engine:**

*   **Function:** Analyze data lineage and usage patterns to predict future performance bottlenecks and recommend schema changes.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Usage-Based Prediction:**  Identify frequently accessed columns and predict potential performance gains from indexing, partitioning, or distributing them appropriately.  (High-frequency columns should be more readily accessible.)
    *   **Dependency Analysis:**  Analyze data dependencies to identify critical path queries. Optimize the schema for these queries by pre-joining tables or creating materialized views.
    *   **Data Type Prediction:**  Track data type changes over time.  Suggest data type modifications to improve storage efficiency or query performance. (e.g., changing a VARCHAR to a smaller type if the maximum length is consistently smaller).
    *   **Data Skew Detection:** Identify skewed data distributions within columns used for partitioning or clustering.  Recommend alternative partitioning strategies to improve query parallelism.
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a predictive model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) on historical data lineage and performance metrics.  The model should learn to predict performance degradation based on changes in data flow and usage patterns.

**3. Proactive Optimization Controller:**

*   **Function:** Automate the implementation of recommended schema changes.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The Predictive Schema Evolution Engine generates a recommended schema change.
    2.  The Proactive Optimization Controller simulates the impact of the change using a shadow data store.
    3.  If the simulation indicates performance improvement, the controller schedules the change for implementation during a maintenance window.
    4.  The controller executes the schema change and monitors performance to ensure expected gains.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Predictive Model):**

```
function predict_performance_degradation(data_lineage, usage_patterns, current_schema):
  // Extract features from data lineage and usage patterns:
  feature_vector = extract_features(data_lineage, usage_patterns)

  // Load trained machine learning model
  model = load_model("performance_prediction_model.pkl")

  // Predict performance degradation
  predicted_degradation = model.predict(feature_vector)

  // If degradation is predicted, generate schema recommendations
  if predicted_degradation > threshold:
    recommendations = generate_schema_recommendations(data_lineage, usage_patterns, current_schema)
    return recommendations
  else:
    return None
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Lineage Graph:**  Graph database representing data flow and dependencies.
*   **Feature Vector:**  Array of numerical features extracted from lineage graph and usage patterns.
*   **Schema Recommendation:**  Structured data containing recommended schema changes (e.g., "add index to column X", "change data type of column Y").
