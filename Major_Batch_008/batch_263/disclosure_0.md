## Dynamic Media "Constellations"

**Concept:** Extend the recommendation engine beyond simple related items to create navigable “constellations” of media, visualizing connections between artists, genres, moods, historical periods, and even fan-created content.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structure: Media Graph**

*   **Nodes:** Each media item (song, album, video, artist, genre, mood tag, historical period, user playlist, fan fiction excerpt - anything relevant) is a node in a graph database (Neo4j preferred).
*   **Edges:** Edges represent relationships between nodes.  Relationship types are weighted (strength of connection). Example relationship types:
    *   “PerformedBy” (Song -> Artist) - Weight: Album sales, streaming counts
    *   “InfluencedBy” (Artist A -> Artist B) - Weight: Critical acclaim, follower counts, musical similarity scores (via audio analysis)
    *   “SimilarMood” (Song A -> Song B) - Weight: AI mood detection scores, user tagging
    *   “Co-occurrence” (Song A -> Playlist X) – Weight: Number of playlists containing both items.
    *   “FanConnection” (Song A -> FanFiction Y) - Weight:  View counts, ratings, sentiment analysis of comments.
*   **Metadata:** Each node stores standard metadata *plus* derived data:
    *   Engagement metrics (plays, likes, shares)
    *   Sentiment analysis scores (from reviews, comments)
    *   AI-derived “vibe”/mood vectors
    *   Historical context data (year released, relevant events)

**2. UI/UX – “Constellation View”**

*   **Central Node:** User selects a starting media item (e.g., a song). This becomes the central node in the constellation view.
*   **Dynamic Layout:** Related nodes radiate outwards from the central node.  The distance from the center represents the strength of the relationship (closer = stronger).
*   **Visual Cues:**
    *   Node size: Represents popularity/engagement
    *   Edge thickness/color: Represents the strength/type of relationship.
    *   Node color: Categorization (e.g., genre, artist type).
*   **Interactive Navigation:**
    *   Users can drag nodes to reposition the constellation.
    *   Clicking a node highlights all connections to that node.
    *   Double-clicking a node sets it as the new central node.
    *   Filtering: Users can filter by relationship type, genre, mood, era, etc.
*   **“Serendipity” Mode:**  A button that randomly adjusts the constellation layout, highlighting unexpected connections.

**3. Algorithm – Constellation Generation**

1.  **Seed Node:** User selects a seed media item.
2.  **Neighbor Retrieval:** Retrieve a set of direct neighbors (nodes connected by a single edge) from the graph database.
3.  **Expansion:** Recursively expand the graph, adding neighbors of neighbors, limiting the depth based on user preference or computational constraints.
4.  **Weighting & Layout:**  Assign weights to edges based on relationship strength.  Use a force-directed graph layout algorithm (e.g., ForceAtlas2) to arrange nodes visually, respecting edge weights.
5.  **Personalization:**  Incorporate user listening history and preferences to prioritize certain connections.  (e.g., prioritize artists the user frequently listens to).

**4. Pseudocode – Core Algorithm**

```
FUNCTION generate_constellation(seed_node, depth, user_preferences)
  neighbors = get_neighbors(seed_node, depth)
  weighted_edges = calculate_edge_weights(neighbors)
  layout = force_directed_layout(weighted_edges)
  personalized_layout = apply_user_preferences(layout, user_preferences)
  RETURN personalized_layout
```

**5.  Advanced Features**

*   **Collaborative Constellations:** Users can share their constellations with friends and contribute to a collective “knowledge graph” of musical connections.
*   **AI-Generated Pathways:** Algorithmically discover “hidden pathways” between seemingly unrelated artists or genres, offering novel recommendations.
*   **Temporal Visualization:**  Allow users to visualize how musical connections have evolved over time.  (e.g., track the influence of one artist on another across decades).
*   **Fan-Driven Content Integration:** Incorporate fan-created playlists, reviews, and artwork into the constellation view, creating a more dynamic and engaging experience.
