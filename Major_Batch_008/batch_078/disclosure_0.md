## Dynamic Payment Allocation & Predictive Funding

**Core Concept:** Expand the payment allocation functionality to *predictively* source funds across multiple payment methods *before* authorization, optimizing for rewards, minimizing fees, and avoiding declined transactions. This goes beyond simply *selecting* a payment type at authorization – it actively *funds* chosen methods in anticipation of the transaction.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Predictive Funding Engine (PFE):** A background process running on the user's device/server.
    *   **Input:** User’s linked payment accounts (credit, debit, bank accounts, crypto wallets, etc.), transaction details (amount, merchant), user preferences (reward optimization, fee avoidance), historical transaction data, real-time account balances, predictive models for account availability (e.g., predicting when a credit line will replenish).
    *   **Process:** PFE evaluates potential funding combinations for the transaction. It considers:
        *   Reward points accrual for each payment method.
        *   Transaction fees (if any) associated with each method.
        *   Available balance/credit line for each method.
        *   Predicted future balance/credit line (using historical data & known replenishment schedules).
        *   User-defined rules (e.g., "always use rewards card for grocery stores," "avoid foreign transaction fees").
    *   **Output:** Optimal funding plan – specifies which accounts to draw funds from and the amount allocated to each.

2.  **Automated Account Transfers:**  Based on the optimal funding plan:
    *   PFE initiates automated transfers *before* the authorization request is sent.
    *   Transfers occur between linked accounts to ensure sufficient funds are available in the chosen payment methods.  Examples:
        *   Transfer funds from a savings account to a credit card to cover the transaction and maximize rewards.
        *   Transfer funds from a secondary checking account to a primary checking account.
        *   Automatically sell a small amount of cryptocurrency to fund the transaction.
    *   These transfers happen in the background, ideally without requiring user interaction.

3.  **Dynamic Authorization Request:**
    *   The authorization request sent to the merchant is adjusted based on the automated funding.
    *   The request includes an indicator that the payment is being funded dynamically.
    *   The merchant may need minimal changes to their existing authorization process.

4.  **User Interface (Optional):**
    *   A dashboard allowing users to view the automated funding process.
    *   The ability to override the automated funding plan if desired.
    *   A historical log of automated transfers.

**Pseudocode (PFE Core Logic):**

```
function findOptimalFundingPlan(transactionAmount, userPreferences, accountData) {
  potentialPlans = []
  for each account in accountData {
    plan = {
      account: account,
      amount: transactionAmount
    }
    potentialPlans.add(plan)
  }
  
  // Evaluate all combinations of accounts
  for each combination in generateCombinations(accountData) {
      totalAmount = 0
      for each account in combination {
          totalAmount += account.balance
      }
      if (totalAmount >= transactionAmount) {
          plan = {
              accounts: combination,
              amount: transactionAmount
          }
          evaluatePlan(plan, userPreferences)
      }
  }

  // Select the plan with the highest score (based on rewards, fees, etc.)
  return bestPlan
}

function evaluatePlan(plan, userPreferences) {
  score = 0
  for each account in plan.accounts {
    score += calculateRewardPoints(account, plan.amount)
    score -= calculateTransactionFees(account, plan.amount)
  }
  plan.score = score
  return plan
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply *choosing* a payment method at the time of authorization. It proactively manages funds across multiple accounts to optimize the payment process *before* the authorization request is even sent. This anticipates potential issues (insufficient funds, declined transactions) and solves them proactively.
