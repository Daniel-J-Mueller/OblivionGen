## Adaptive Content ‘Sculpting’ via Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Expand the rotational/tilt input paradigm beyond simple page/section navigation to allow *direct manipulation* of content elements on screen, utilizing haptic feedback to create a “sculpting” experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Device incorporates advanced haptic engine capable of localized texture and resistance simulation across entire screen area. High-resolution accelerometer and gyroscope are *required*. Optional: integrated depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or similar) for enhanced 3D interaction.
*   **Software – Core Interaction:**
    *   Initial state: Display a ‘content canvas’ – a visual representation of data (images, text blocks, 3D models, etc.). The canvas is initially ‘flat’ – standard 2D presentation.
    *   **Tilt/Rotation Input:**  As the device is tilted/rotated around a primary axis (defined by system initialization), the content canvas reacts *physically*. 
        *   Small tilts/rotations (e.g., +/- 5 degrees): Cause subtle ‘lifting’ or ‘sinking’ of content elements. Haptic feedback simulates the texture and resistance of the ‘lifted’ or ‘sunk’ element. Think of it like gently pushing or pulling on clay.
        *   Larger tilts/rotations (e.g., +/- 15 degrees+): Allow for more dramatic manipulation.  Individual elements can be ‘pulled forward’ to become emphasized, or ‘pushed back’ to become minimized. 
        *   Rotation *around* a perpendicular axis: Enables ‘layering’ and ‘unlayering’ of content. Rotating the device can bring elements ‘to the front’ or ‘send them to the back’.
    *   **Haptic Engine Control:** 
        *   Each content element has assigned haptic properties (texture, density, resistance). These properties are adjustable.
        *   Haptic feedback intensity is proportional to the degree of tilt/rotation *and* the ‘depth’ of the element on the canvas.
        *   “Collision” detection: If the user attempts to ‘overlap’ elements in an impossible way, haptic feedback provides strong resistance.
    *   **Contextual Actions:**
        *   Double-tap on a ‘sculpted’ element: Opens a contextual menu for further editing/interaction.
        *   Swipe gesture across the canvas: ‘Smooths’ out the sculpted surface, returning elements to their default positions.
        *   ‘Capture’ function: Creates a static snapshot of the current sculpted arrangement.

*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Haptic Engine
Initialize Accelerometer/Gyroscope
Load Content Canvas

// Main Loop
While (Device is Active)
    Read Accelerometer/Gyroscope data
    Calculate Tilt/Rotation angles
    For Each Content Element
        Calculate ‘depth’ based on Tilt/Rotation and element properties
        Update Haptic feedback (Texture, Resistance) based on ‘depth’
        Render Content Element with updated Z-coordinate
    Detect Gestures (Double-tap, Swipe)
    Process Gestures
End While
```

*   **Potential Applications:** 
    *   Data visualization: Sculpting data points to reveal hidden relationships.
    *   Image/Video editing: Directly manipulating layers and effects.
    *   3D modeling: Intuitive and tactile sculpting of 3D objects.
    *   Interactive storytelling: Manipulating the environment and characters in a story.
