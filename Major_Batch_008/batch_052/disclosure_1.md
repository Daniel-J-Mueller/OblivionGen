## Adaptive Environmental Resonance System

**Concept:** A system utilizing the bridge device as a central node for localized environmental adjustments based on detected activity and user preference, going beyond simple lighting control to influence other networked devices.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** The existing ‘bridge’ device acts as the hub.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Expands beyond motion sensors to include:
    *   Ambient Sound Level Sensor (integrated or connected)
    *   Air Quality Sensor (VOCs, CO2)
    *   Temperature/Humidity Sensor
*   **Actuator Control:** Networked control of:
    *   Smart Blinds/Curtains
    *   Smart HVAC Systems (individual vents)
    *   Aromatherapy Diffusers
    *   Localized Sound Systems (small, directional speakers)
*   **User Profiles & Learning:**
    *   User-defined “Scenes” beyond lighting – e.g., “Focus,” “Relax,” “Energize.”
    *   AI-driven learning of user preferences based on time of day, detected activity, and manual adjustments.
*   **Resonance Algorithm:**
    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        FUNCTION GenerateResonance(ActivityData, UserProfile, TimeOfDay)
            // ActivityData: Motion, Sound Level, Air Quality
            // UserProfile: Preferred Temperature, Lighting, Aromatherapy, Sound
            // TimeOfDay: Current Time

            //Calculate a ‘Resonance Score’ for each device based on inputs
            TemperatureScore = (UserProfile.PreferredTemperature - CurrentTemperature) * ActivityWeight
            LightingScore = (UserProfile.PreferredLighting - CurrentLighting) * ActivityWeight
            AromaScore = (UserProfile.PreferredAroma - CurrentAroma) * ActivityWeight
            SoundScore = (UserProfile.PreferredSound - CurrentSound) * ActivityWeight

            // Apply weighting based on detected activity (e.g., high motion = prioritize lighting, low motion = prioritize aromatherapy)
            IF MotionDetected > Threshold THEN
                ActivityWeight = 0.7 //Prioritize lighting
            ELSE
                ActivityWeight = 0.3 //Prioritize aroma
            ENDIF

            //Adjust device settings based on score.
            AdjustTemperature(TemperatureScore)
            AdjustLighting(LightingScore)
            AdjustAroma(AromaScore)
            AdjustSound(SoundScore)
        END FUNCTION
        ```
*   **Communication Protocol:** Utilizes existing bridge’s communication interfaces. Expands to include Zigbee/Z-Wave for broader device compatibility.
*   **Power Management:** Low-power modes for sensors and actuators.
*   **Data Storage:** Local storage on bridge for user profiles and learning data. Cloud backup optional.

**Operational Scenario:**

User enters a room. Bridge detects motion and sound levels. AI, based on user profile and time of day, initiates a ‘Focus’ scene:

*   Blinds partially close to reduce glare.
*   HVAC adjusts temperature to optimal level.
*   Aromatherapy diffuser releases a stimulating scent.
*   Directional speakers play ambient focus music.

System learns from user adjustments, refining the ‘Focus’ scene over time.
