## Dynamic Content Access Keys (DC-Keys)

**Concept:** Extend the payment-for-content model to a granular level, allowing users to *trade* access to portions of content for micro-payments or in-content actions (e.g., solving a puzzle, watching a short ad). This moves beyond simple paywalls to a more interactive and personalized access system.

**Specs:**

*   **Key Generation:** The content server generates DC-Keys representing specific sections (paragraphs, images, video segments, code blocks, interactive elements) of a larger content piece. Each key has associated metadata:
    *   `key_id`: Unique identifier for the content section.
    *   `content_type`: Type of content (text, image, video, interactive).
    *   `price`: Micro-payment cost (can be zero for promotional sections).
    *   `unlock_condition`:  Conditions for unlocking (payment, ad view, puzzle solve, social share).
    *   `expiration`: Time-to-live for the key (can be indefinite).
    *   `dependency_list`: List of other `key_id`s which must be unlocked prior.
*   **Client-Side Integration:** The browser (or plugin) intercepts content requests. When a section requires a key, it:
    1.  Requests the `key_id` from the server (along with user context â€“ subscription level, ad preferences).
    2.  Presents the unlock condition to the user.
    3.  Upon fulfillment, requests the key from the server.
    4.  Receives the key.
    5.  Decrypts/renders the content section using the key.
*   **Key Exchange:**  Use a time-limited, digitally signed key (using standard asymmetric cryptography).  The server signs the key with its private key, ensuring authenticity. The client verifies the signature. The signed key is delivered alongside the content section metadata.
*   **Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function requestContentSection(sectionId) {
  // Get section metadata from server (including key requirements)
  metadata = getServerMetadata(sectionId);

  if (metadata.requiresKey) {
    // Check if user has key
    if (hasKey(metadata.keyId)) {
      // Decrypt/Render content
      renderContent(sectionId, decrypt(content, key));
    } else {
      // Present unlock condition
      unlockCondition = getUnlockCondition(metadata);
      // Wait for user fulfillment
      await userFulfillment(unlockCondition);
      // Request key from server
      key = requestKey(metadata.keyId);
      // Store key (with expiration)
      storeKey(key);
      // Render content
      renderContent(sectionId, decrypt(content, key));
    }
  } else {
    renderContent(sectionId, content);
  }
}

function requestKey(keyId) {
    //Send request to server for key
    response = server.getKey(keyId);
    return response.key;
}
```

*   **Server-Side Adaptation:** The content management system (CMS) must be adapted to support DC-Key generation and assignment to content sections.  This includes an API for key requests and management.
*   **Scope of Access:**  Keys can be scoped to individual users (based on user ID) or devices (based on device ID) for enhanced security and personalization.
*   **"Key Bundles":** Support the purchase of bundles of keys covering a larger section of content, providing a discount and simplifying the access process.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust key prices dynamically based on demand, content popularity, or user preferences.
