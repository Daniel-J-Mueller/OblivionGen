## Adaptive Predictive Burst – “Chrono-Sculpt”

**Concept:** Leveraging the time-series data captured during image acquisition – not just *before* and *after* a flash, but the *entire* capture sequence – to build a dynamically adjusting predictive burst mode, offering a sculpted final image based on inferred user intent.

**Specs:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **High-Speed Buffer:** A dedicated, volatile memory block (minimum 2GB) capable of receiving and storing a continuous stream of image data at the device’s maximum frame rate.
*   **Real-Time Processing Unit:** A co-processor (DSP or dedicated neural engine) for on-device analysis of image sequences.  Must be capable of executing lightweight ML models.
*   **Gyroscope/Accelerometer Integration:** Access to device motion sensors for improved prediction of intended subject and stabilization.

**II. Software Architecture:**

1.  **Capture Initiation:** Upon user trigger (shutter button press, voice command), initiate continuous capture and buffering of image data.
2.  **Temporal Analysis Engine:**  A real-time analysis module processing the buffered data.
    *   **Motion Vector Calculation:** Track the movement of objects within the captured frames. Identify primary subject(s) based on motion prominence and scale.
    *   **Illumination Prediction:** Analyze pre-flash luminance levels.  Predict the impact of the flash on different areas of the scene.
    *   **Scene Complexity Mapping:** Estimate the entropy (information content) of each frame, identifying areas of high detail and potential noise.
3.  **Predictive Burst Algorithm:**
    *   **Dynamic Windowing:** Based on motion vectors and scene complexity, the system dynamically adjusts the “burst window” – the number of frames captured *before* and *after* the flash. High motion or complexity expands the window; static scenes compress it.
    *   **Chrono-Weighting:**  Assign weights to each frame in the burst window based on its predicted contribution to the final image. Frames closest to optimal flash exposure receive higher weights.
    *   **AI-Assisted Frame Selection:** A lightweight, on-device ML model (trained on a large dataset of images and user preferences) evaluates each frame, predicting its aesthetic quality and relevance to the user's intent.
4.  **Image Sculpting & Fusion:**
    *   **Adaptive HDR:**  Based on the Chrono-Weighting and AI scores, the system intelligently merges frames to create an HDR image with optimal dynamic range and reduced noise.
    *   **Motion De-Blurring:** Apply motion compensation algorithms to minimize blur in moving subjects, using motion vector data.
    *   **Artistic Style Transfer (Optional):** Allow users to apply subtle artistic filters based on the selected burst, enhancing the final image.
5.  **User Feedback Loop:**
    *   **“Sculpt” Editing:** Provide a post-capture interface where users can interactively adjust the Chrono-Weighting and AI scores, refining the final image.
    *   **Preference Learning:**  Track user edits and incorporate this feedback into the AI model, improving future predictions.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Core):**

```
function CaptureBurst(trigger_event):
    start_capture()
    while (capture_active):
        frame = get_next_frame()
        motion_vectors = calculate_motion(frame)
        luminance = calculate_luminance(frame)
        add_frame_to_buffer(frame, motion_vectors, luminance)
        if (flash_triggered):
            process_buffer()
            break

function process_buffer():
    for frame in buffer:
        weight = calculate_chrono_weight(frame.motion, frame.luminance)
        ai_score = evaluate_frame_quality(frame)
        frame.final_weight = weight * ai_score

    merged_image = create_hdr_image(buffer, final_weights)
    deblurred_image = apply_motion_compensation(merged_image, motion_vectors)
    present_image_to_user(deblurred_image)
```

**Novelty:**  This differs from the referenced patent by moving beyond a simple pre/post-flash capture.  It leverages the *entire* capture sequence, using AI-driven analysis and dynamic weighting to create a “sculpted” image optimized for both technical quality and aesthetic appeal. It’s less about selecting *from* a burst, and more about *creating* an optimal image *during* the burst.
