## Adaptive Keyboard Macro Profiles via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Expand the login manager functionality to dynamically adjust keyboard macro profiles based on real-time user biofeedback – specifically, galvanic skin response (GSR) and potentially heart rate variability (HRV). This moves beyond simply *storing* credentials and macros, to *adapting* the user interface based on cognitive load and stress levels.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Integration:**

*   **GSR Sensor:** Integrate a GSR sensor (small contact pads on the keyboard frame or integrated into palm rests) to measure skin conductance – an indicator of emotional arousal and cognitive load.
*   **Optional HRV Sensor:**  Explore integration with wearable devices providing HRV data via Bluetooth. (This is secondary to GSR, but adds refinement.)
*   **Microcontroller:** Embedded microcontroller within the keyboard to process sensor data and communicate with the host computer.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Data Acquisition Module:**  Software driver to acquire raw sensor data from the microcontroller.
*   **Signal Processing Module:**  Algorithm to filter and process raw sensor data, extracting meaningful metrics (e.g., average GSR level, GSR spikes, HRV coherence).
*   **Cognitive Load Assessment Module:**  Algorithm to estimate user cognitive load based on processed sensor data.  This could involve setting thresholds for GSR/HRV levels representing low, medium, and high load. Machine learning could be employed to refine this assessment over time.
*   **Macro Profile Manager:** Expands existing login manager functionality. This component maintains a library of keyboard macro profiles optimized for different cognitive load states. Examples:
    *   **Low Load:** Standard macro set for efficient typing.
    *   **Medium Load:** Macros for frequently used functions, code snippets, or commands to reduce mental effort.
    *   **High Load:** Simplified macro set, focusing on essential commands, with larger key activation areas or auto-completion features.  Potential for disabling complex macros altogether.
*   **Dynamic Profile Switching:**  Algorithm to automatically switch between macro profiles based on the cognitive load assessment. This should be smooth and non-disruptive to the user experience.  User-adjustable sensitivity settings.
*   **Learning & Adaptation:**  Implementation of a machine learning model to learn user preferences and tailor macro profiles over time.  This could involve tracking which macros are used most frequently under different load conditions.

**3. Pseudocode (Dynamic Profile Switching):**

```
// Initialize: Load macro profiles, establish baseline GSR/HRV levels
// Continuously:

Read GSR/HRV data
Process data to determine current cognitive load level (Low, Medium, High)
IF (current_cognitive_load != previous_cognitive_load) THEN
  IF (current_cognitive_load == "Low") THEN
    Activate "Standard" macro profile
  ELSE IF (current_cognitive_load == "Medium") THEN
    Activate "Extended" macro profile
  ELSE IF (current_cognitive_load == "High") THEN
    Activate "Simplified" macro profile
  END IF
  previous_cognitive_load = current_cognitive_load
END IF
```

**4. User Interface:**

*   **Visual Indicator:**  Small LED indicator on the keyboard displaying the currently active macro profile (e.g., green = Standard, yellow = Extended, red = Simplified).
*   **Configuration Panel:**  Software application allowing users to:
    *   Adjust sensitivity settings for cognitive load detection.
    *   Customize macro profiles for each load state.
    *   View real-time biofeedback data.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Software Development:** Dynamically adjust code completion and snippet macros based on developer concentration.
*   **Data Entry:** Simplify input macros during periods of fatigue or stress.
*   **Gaming:** Optimize key bindings and macro sequences for peak performance.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide customized keyboard layouts and macros for users with cognitive impairments.
