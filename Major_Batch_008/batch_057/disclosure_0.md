## Adaptive Kernel Fusion with Generative Scene Priors

**Concept:** Expand the kernel selection process beyond a ranked list to a *fusion* of kernels, weighted by a generative model that predicts scene characteristics impacting deblurring. This moves from "choose the best" to "blend the most appropriate" kernels.

**Specs:**

**I. Scene Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw input image.
*   **Process:** Train a generative adversarial network (GAN) – specifically a conditional GAN (cGAN) – to estimate scene parameters. The GAN will be trained on a massive dataset of images with ground truth scene data (depth maps, material classifications, lighting estimations).
*   **Output:** A vector of scene parameters:
    *   Depth Map Estimate (low resolution).
    *   Material Classification (e.g., glass, metal, fabric, foliage) – one-hot encoded.
    *   Lighting Estimation (directional light vector, ambient intensity).
    *   Motion Blur Estimation (angle/velocity, length).
*   **Training Data:** Synthetic dataset augmented with real-world images, incorporating diverse blur patterns.

**II. Kernel Library:**

*   Expanded beyond simple parameters (SNR, diameter). Include kernels designed for specific blur types (Gaussian, motion, out-of-focus, spherical aberration).
*   Each kernel associated with a feature vector describing its optimal application scenarios (e.g., "high frequency detail, low SNR, motion blur angle 0-45 degrees").

**III. Kernel Fusion Engine:**

*   **Input:** Scene parameter vector (from Scene Analysis Module), Kernel Library.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Similarity Scoring:** Calculate a similarity score between the scene parameter vector and the feature vectors of each kernel in the library. (Cosine similarity preferred).
    2.  **Weighting:** Normalize the similarity scores to create kernel weights.
    3.  **Kernel Blending:** Apply a weighted average of the kernels to the input image.
        *   `Output Image = Σ (Kernel_i * Weight_i) * Input Image`
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function fuse_kernels(input_image, scene_params, kernel_library):
  weights = []
  for kernel in kernel_library:
    similarity = cosine_similarity(scene_params, kernel.feature_vector)
    weights.append(softmax(similarity))

  output_image = 0
  for i in range(len(kernel_library)):
    output_image += weights[i] * apply_kernel(input_image, kernel_library[i])

  return output_image
```

**IV. Adaptive Feedback Loop:**

*   **Mechanism:** Integrate a perceptual metric (e.g., Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity - LPIPS) to evaluate the quality of the deblurred image.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Monitor LPIPS score on a rolling window of processed images.
    2.  Adjust the weighting parameters of the Kernel Fusion Engine based on the LPIPS score.  (Reinforcement Learning – Proximal Policy Optimization – PPO – could be used).
    3.  Dynamically refine the generative model based on observed performance.

**V. Hardware Requirements:**

*   GPU acceleration essential for both the GAN and kernel convolution operations.
*   Large memory capacity for handling the GAN model and large image datasets.
*   Dedicated hardware accelerator for LPIPS calculation would speed up the feedback loop.
