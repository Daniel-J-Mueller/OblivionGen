## Data Object ‘Shadowing’ and Predictive Caching

**Specification:** Implement a ‘shadowing’ system for data objects alongside the existing keymap/versioning. This creates a predictive cache based on user access patterns, anticipating future requests *before* they occur.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** A continuously running process monitoring all requests for data objects. This module builds a statistical model of user access – frequency, time-of-day, common sequences, etc.
*   **Shadow Cache:**  A dedicated cache space separate from the primary keymap cache. This stores 'shadow copies' of data objects predicted to be requested soon. Shadow copies are *reduced fidelity* – only the data most frequently accessed within the object is stored.
*   **Fidelity Controller:** Manages the fidelity of shadow copies. Adjusts which data segments are stored based on predicted access and available cache space. Uses techniques like Least Recently Used (LRU) on data *within* the object, not just the object itself.
*   **Request Interceptor:** Sits in front of the primary keymap lookup.  Checks if a requested object is present in the Shadow Cache. If found, it serves the reduced-fidelity data *immediately*. 
*   **Background Full-Fidelity Fetch:**  If a Shadow Cache hit occurs, a background process automatically initiates a full-fidelity fetch of the object from persistent storage. This ensures the user receives the complete data if they require it.
*   **Cache Eviction Policy:** Shadow Cache eviction prioritizes objects with low prediction scores and/or those that have had a full-fidelity fetch completed recently.

**Pseudocode (Request Interceptor):**

```
function handleRequest(userKey, versionIdentifier):
  shadowObject = ShadowCache.lookup(userKey)

  if (shadowObject != null):
    // Shadow hit
    serve(shadowObject.reducedData)
    startBackgroundFetch(userKey) // Fetch full object in background
    return

  // No shadow hit, proceed to normal keymap lookup
  keymapInfo = KeymapCoordinator.lookup(userKey)

  if (keymapInfo != null):
    // Keymap hit
    fullObject = PersistentStorage.fetch(keymapInfo.locator)
    serve(fullObject)
    ShadowCache.store(userKey, fullObject) // Store for future access
    return
  else:
    // Keymap miss
    respondWithError("Object not found")
    return
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Access Pattern Record:** `{userKey: string, timestamp: datetime, accessSequence: array<string>, frequency: integer}`
*   **Shadow Object:** `{userKey: string, reducedData: byte[], fidelityLevel: integer, lastAccess: datetime}`

**Novelty:** Existing caching focuses on *after* the request. This system aims to reduce latency by *anticipating* requests using statistical modeling, trading fidelity for speed. The fidelity controller and tiered data structures are also unique.  This isn’t simply a ‘read-ahead’ cache – it’s a proactive system that adapts to user behavior.
