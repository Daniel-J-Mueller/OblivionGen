## Adaptive Network Reputation Scoring & Dynamic Subnet Isolation

**Concept:** Extend the subnet-based treatment approach by incorporating a dynamic, reputation-based scoring system *within* subnets. Instead of treating entire subnets uniformly, isolate and treat only the problematic *portions* of a subnet based on continuously updated reputation scores assigned to individual addresses. This moves beyond blanket application of treatments and towards granular, self-healing network security.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Score Calculation Module:**

*   **Inputs:** Network activity data (as per existing patent), historical treatment data, external threat intelligence feeds (e.g., known malicious IPs, botnet C&C servers).
*   **Process:**
    *   Assign an initial reputation score to each network address (e.g., 500/1000).
    *   Monitor network activity and update the score based on:
        *   Positive Indicators: Successful connections, valid traffic patterns (+5-20 points).
        *   Negative Indicators: Failed authentication attempts, malformed requests, sending requests to known malicious destinations, high traffic volume (suspected DDoS) (-10-50 points).
        *   External Threat Intelligence: Matches against known bad actors (-50-100 points).
        *   Time Decay: Scores decay over time to reflect changing network conditions.
*   **Output:** Continuously updated reputation score for each network address.

**2. Dynamic Subnet Segmentation Module:**

*   **Input:** Reputation scores for all network addresses within a monitored subnet. Configurable thresholds for "Good," "Neutral," and "Bad" reputation ranges.
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide the subnet into dynamic segments based on reputation scores.
    *   **Good Segment:** Addresses with high reputation scores (e.g., >750).  Allow unrestricted access.
    *   **Neutral Segment:** Addresses with moderate reputation scores (e.g., 500-750). Monitor more closely, potentially implement rate limiting.
    *   **Bad Segment:** Addresses with low reputation scores (e.g., <500). Isolate from the network. Redirect traffic to a sandbox for analysis, or block entirely.
*   **Output:** Dynamic subnet segmentation map, listing addresses in each segment.

**3.  Automated Treatment Enforcement Module:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic subnet segmentation map, configurable treatment policies (e.g., block, rate limit, redirect, challenge-response).
*   **Process:**
    *   Apply appropriate treatment policies to each segment based on its reputation.
    *   Utilize existing network infrastructure (firewalls, routers) to enforce treatments.
    *   Log all treatment actions for auditing and analysis.
*   **Output:**  Enforced network treatments.

**4.  Adaptive Threshold Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:** Network activity data, overall network health metrics, false positive/negative rates.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor the effectiveness of the reputation scoring system.
    *   Dynamically adjust the reputation score thresholds to optimize performance.
    *   Use machine learning to identify patterns and improve accuracy.
*   **Output:** Adjusted reputation score thresholds.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
For Each Network Address in Subnet:
  ReputationScore = CalculateReputationScore(NetworkAddress, NetworkActivityData)

  If ReputationScore > GoodThreshold:
    Segment = "Good"
  Else If ReputationScore > NeutralThreshold:
    Segment = "Neutral"
  Else:
    Segment = "Bad"

  ApplyTreatment(NetworkAddress, Segment)

AdjustThresholdsBasedOnNetworkHealth()
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server with sufficient CPU and memory to handle real-time analysis.
*   Network monitoring tools to capture network activity data.
*   Integration with existing network infrastructure (firewalls, routers).
*   Machine learning libraries for adaptive threshold adjustment.
*   Data store for storing reputation scores and treatment logs.
