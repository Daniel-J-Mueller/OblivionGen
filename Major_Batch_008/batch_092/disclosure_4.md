## Dynamic Granularity TTS with Predictive Chunking

**Concept:** This system moves beyond simply prioritizing early portions of TTS requests. It dynamically adjusts the granularity of synthesis – moving from character/phoneme level to word/phrase level – *based on predicted user engagement* and available computational resources. The core idea is to pre-fetch and synthesize larger chunks of speech *before* they’re explicitly requested, betting on continued user attention.

**Specifications:**

**1. Engagement Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** User interaction data (e.g., scrolling speed, dwell time, interaction with displayed content, historical engagement patterns).  Application context (e.g. navigating a map, reading an article, controlling a device).
*   **Process:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to predict the probability of continued engagement with the current TTS output. Outputs a "engagement score" (0.0 - 1.0).
*   **Output:** Engagement score, updated at a configurable frequency (e.g., every 50-100ms).

**2. Dynamic Granularity Controller:**

*   **Input:** Engagement Score, available computational resources (CPU/GPU load, network bandwidth), remaining text length.
*   **Process:** 
    *   Based on Engagement Score:
        *   **High Engagement (0.75-1.0):**  Prioritize synthesis of larger chunks (phrases, sentences) for predictive buffering.  Utilize faster, potentially less natural synthesis methods for these predictive chunks.
        *   **Medium Engagement (0.4-0.75):** Maintain a balance between predictive buffering and traditional granular synthesis.
        *   **Low Engagement (0.0-0.4):**  Focus on synthesizing only the immediately requested text. Reduce or eliminate predictive buffering.
    *   Based on available resources: Dynamically adjust the size of predictive chunks and the synthesis quality.
*   **Output:**  "Synthesis Granularity Level" (e.g., Character, Phoneme, Syllable, Word, Phrase, Sentence), “Synthesis Quality Level” (e.g. Fastest, Balanced, Highest Quality).

**3. Hybrid Synthesis Pipeline:**

*   **Components:**
    *   **Fast Synthesis Module:**  Utilizes a lightweight, statistical parametric speech synthesis model (e.g., Tacotron 2, FastSpeech 2) optimized for speed. This module is used for generating predictive chunks with lower quality.
    *   **High-Quality Synthesis Module:** Employs a more complex, neural vocoder-based synthesis model (e.g., WaveGlow, HiFi-GAN) optimized for naturalness. This module is used for synthesizing immediately requested text and refining predictive chunks.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Dynamic Granularity Controller determines the appropriate Synthesis Granularity Level and Synthesis Quality Level.
    2.  Fast Synthesis Module generates predictive chunks based on the Synthesis Granularity Level and Synthesis Quality Level.
    3.  High-Quality Synthesis Module synthesizes the immediately requested text and refines the predictive chunks using a "blend" approach - combining the fast synthesis output with refined audio generated using the high-quality model.
    4.  Output audio stream is delivered to the user.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop

while (text_available) {

    engagement_score = engagement_prediction_module.predict()
    granularity_level, quality_level = dynamic_granularity_controller.determine_levels(engagement_score, resources)

    current_text_chunk = get_next_text_chunk(granularity_level)

    if (engagement_score > 0.75) {
        //Prefetch and Synthesize Future Chunks
        future_chunks = get_future_text_chunks(granularity_level, prefetch_count)
        fast_synthesis_output = fast_synthesis_module.synthesize(future_chunks)

    }

    high_quality_output = high_quality_synthesis_module.synthesize(current_text_chunk)
    //Blend if Prefetch

    output_stream.append(output)

}
```

**System Considerations:**

*   **Prefetch Count:** The number of future chunks to prefetch based on engagement score.
*   **Blend Ratio:** Adjust the ratio of fast synthesis output to high-quality output in the blended audio stream.
*   **Resource Management:** Dynamically allocate resources between the Fast and High-Quality Synthesis Modules.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Employ reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of the system (prefetch count, blend ratio, resource allocation) based on user feedback and engagement metrics.
