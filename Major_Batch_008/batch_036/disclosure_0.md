## Adaptive Catalog Cohesion – Multi-Modal Signal Fusion

**Concept:** Extend the core embedding-based item association to incorporate real-time behavioral signals and external knowledge graphs to dynamically refine item groupings and identify emergent inconsistencies *before* they manifest as catalog errors. This moves beyond static embedding comparisons to a continuously evolving understanding of item relationships.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Signal Sources:**

*   **Core Item Data:** Existing item data (title, description, attributes) – from the provided patent.
*   **Behavioral Signals:**
    *   **Clickstream Data:** User clicks, dwell time, scroll depth on item pages.
    *   **Purchase History:** Transactional data, including co-purchased items.
    *   **Search Queries:** User search terms related to items.
    *   **Add-to-Cart Events:** Items added to shopping carts (even if the purchase isn’t completed).
    *   **Returns/Refunds:** Items returned with associated reason codes.
*   **External Knowledge Graphs:**
    *   **Wikidata/DBpedia:**  Entity relationships and attributes.
    *   **Product Ontologies:** Standardized product classifications.
    *   **Social Media Trends:**  Real-time mentions and sentiment analysis.

**2. Multi-Modal Embedding Generation:**

*   **Separate Embedding Models:** Train dedicated embedding models for each signal type (text, behavioral, knowledge graph).
*   **Fusion Layer:**  Develop a fusion layer (e.g., attention mechanism, concatenation, element-wise addition) to combine the individual embeddings into a unified representation. This layer must dynamically weight the contribution of each modality based on signal strength and relevance.
*   **Temporal Considerations:** Incorporate time-series data into the embedding generation process. For example, use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers to capture the evolution of user behavior and item relationships over time.

**3. Dynamic Clustering & Cohesion Scoring:**

*   **Online Clustering:** Utilize an online clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, OPTICS) to continuously update item groupings based on the fused embeddings. This allows for the detection of emerging inconsistencies and the adaptation to changing item relationships.
*   **Cohesion Score:**  Develop a cohesion score to quantify the strength of the relationship between items within a cluster. This score should incorporate:
    *   **Embedding Similarity:** Cosine similarity between item embeddings.
    *   **Behavioral Co-occurrence:** Frequency of co-purchases, co-views, or co-clicks.
    *   **Knowledge Graph Alignment:**  Strength of the relationship between item entities in the knowledge graph.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify items with low cohesion scores or significant deviations from expected behavior. These anomalies may indicate inconsistencies or errors in the catalog.

**4.  Adaptive Catalog Repair:**

*   **Automated Feedback Loops:**  Implement automated feedback loops to repair inconsistencies in the catalog. For example:
    *   **Attribute Updates:**  Suggest attribute updates based on knowledge graph alignment and behavioral data.
    *   **Relationship Adjustments:**  Recommend adjustments to item relationships based on clustering and cohesion scores.
    *   **Flagging for Manual Review:**  Flag items with high uncertainty for manual review by catalog managers.
*   **A/B Testing:** Conduct A/B tests to evaluate the effectiveness of catalog repair strategies.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
# For each item in catalog
item_embedding = generate_embedding(item_data, behavioral_signals, knowledge_graph)
# Cluster items based on embeddings
clusters = online_clustering(item_embeddings)
# Calculate cohesion score for each cluster
cohesion_scores = calculate_cohesion(clusters, item_embeddings)
# Identify anomalies based on cohesion scores
anomalies = detect_anomalies(cohesion_scores, threshold)
# Apply automated repair strategies to anomalies
repair_catalog(anomalies)
```
