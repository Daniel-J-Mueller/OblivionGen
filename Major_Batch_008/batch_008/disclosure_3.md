## Dynamic Request Shaping via Predictive Client Modeling

**Concept:** Shift from reactive throttling to proactive request *shaping* by building predictive models of individual client/profile request patterns and anticipating potential overload *before* it occurs. This goes beyond simply limiting requests; it dynamically adjusts accepted request *types* based on predicted service capacity.

**Specs:**

*   **Client Profiling Module:**
    *   Data Inputs: Request history (timestamp, request type/category, data volume, success/failure flags), client-reported workload (if available - e.g., “heavy processing,” “display only”), client device characteristics (CPU, memory, network).
    *   Modeling: Employ time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future request rates and volumes *per client*.  Model each client independently, with regular re-training (e.g., daily).
    *   Output: Per-client predicted request rate (requests/second), predicted data volume (MB/second), confidence intervals for predictions.
*   **Service Capacity Estimator:**
    *   Data Inputs: Real-time CPU utilization, memory usage, network bandwidth, I/O rates. Historical performance data. Downstream service throttling signals.
    *   Modeling: Machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict remaining service capacity (requests/second, data volume/second) based on current system state. Continuously updated.
*   **Request Shaping Engine:**
    *   Inputs: Predicted client request rates/volumes, predicted service capacity, request categorization (defined by service – e.g., “read,” “write,” “compute intensive”).
    *   Logic:
        1.  For each incoming request:
            *   Identify the client.
            *   Retrieve the client’s predicted request profile.
            *   Categorize the request.
        2.  Assess the combined impact of *pending* requests + the new request on predicted service capacity.
        3.  If predicted overload:
            *   Dynamically adjust request acceptance priority. Prioritize requests from clients with lower predicted load.
            *   Instead of outright denial, *degrade* lower-priority requests:
                *   Reduce data precision (e.g., compress images).
                *   Defer non-critical processing (e.g., delay logging).
                *   Redirect requests to read-only replicas.
        4.  Continuously monitor the effectiveness of request shaping and adjust models accordingly.
*   **Data Store:** Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) to store client request history, predicted profiles, and service capacity data.
*   **API:**  Expose an API for service integration and configuration.

**Pseudocode (Request Shaping Engine):**

```
function processRequest(request):
  client = request.getClient()
  clientProfile = getClientProfile(client)
  requestCategory = request.getCategory()

  predictedClientLoad = clientProfile.predictLoad()
  currentServiceLoad = getServiceLoad()

  if (currentServiceLoad + predictedClientLoad > serviceCapacity):
    priority = calculatePriority(requestCategory, clientProfile)
    if (priority < minimumAcceptablePriority):
      degradeRequest(request, priority) //Reduce precision, defer processing, etc.
    else:
      rejectRequest(request)
  else:
    processRequestNormally(request)
```

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond simple throttling by *predictively shaping* requests, offering a more granular and intelligent way to manage service load. It's not just about limiting *how many* requests are accepted, but *what kind* of requests, optimizing for overall service availability and responsiveness. The degradation approach is a significant shift, allowing the system to handle more requests overall, albeit with reduced fidelity for some.
