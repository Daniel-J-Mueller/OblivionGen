## Adaptive Mesh Beaconing with Predictive Handover

**Concept:** Enhance mesh network stability and reduce handover latency by implementing adaptive beaconing frequencies based on predicted node movement and link quality, coupled with a proactive handover mechanism.

**Specifications:**

**1. Node Profiling & Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Each mesh node continuously monitors:
    *   Signal strength (RSSI) to neighboring nodes.
    *   Link quality indicators (LQI, packet loss rate).
    *   Node velocity (estimated via Doppler shift of received signals, or external sensor data if available â€“ e.g., mobile device accelerometer).
    *   Historical movement patterns (store a short-term history of node location/velocity).
*   **Movement Prediction:** Implement a Kalman filter or similar predictive algorithm to estimate future node location and velocity based on collected data. This prediction horizon should be configurable (e.g., 1-5 seconds).
*   **Link Quality Prediction:** Predict future link quality to neighboring nodes based on predicted node location and potential obstructions (if map data is available).
*   **Beaconing Rate Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust beaconing frequency based on the following factors:
    *   **Node Velocity:** Higher velocity = higher beaconing frequency.
    *   **Predicted Link Degradation:** If predicted link quality falls below a threshold, increase beaconing frequency.
    *   **Network Congestion:**  Reduce beaconing frequency if network congestion is high (to avoid exacerbating the problem).

**2. Proactive Handover Mechanism:**

*   **Neighbor Scanning:** Nodes continuously scan for potential handover targets (neighbors with stronger predicted link quality).
*   **Handover Trigger:** Initiate handover *before* link quality to the current node degrades significantly.  Handover is triggered if:
    *   Predicted link quality to a neighbor exceeds a threshold.
    *   Predicted link quality to the current node falls below a threshold.
    *   Predicted node movement indicates that a handover to a neighbor will result in a better connection.
*   **Seamless Handover:** Implement a fast handover protocol (e.g., pre-authentication, pre-shared keys) to minimize handover latency and packet loss.
*   **Handover Validation:** After handover, validate the connection to the new node. If the connection is poor, revert to the previous node or initiate a scan for alternative targets.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Beaconing Protocol:** Extend the existing beaconing protocol to include:
    *   Predicted node location.
    *   Predicted node velocity.
    *   Recommended beaconing frequency for neighboring nodes.
*   **Routing Protocol:** Modify the routing protocol to consider predicted node movement and link quality when selecting the best path.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `NodeProfile`: Stores historical data, predicted location/velocity, and recommended beaconing frequency.
    *   `LinkPrediction`: Stores predicted link quality and potential obstructions.

**Pseudocode (Node Handover Logic):**

```
// Inside node's main loop

// 1. Gather data
node_profile = collect_node_data()
link_predictions = predict_link_quality()

// 2. Check for handover trigger
if (should_handover(node_profile, link_predictions)):
    best_neighbor = select_best_neighbor(link_predictions)
    if (best_neighbor != current_node):
        initiate_handover(best_neighbor)
        validate_connection()
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced handover latency and packet loss.
*   Improved network stability and reliability.
*   Enhanced user experience in mobile mesh networks.
*   More efficient use of network resources.
