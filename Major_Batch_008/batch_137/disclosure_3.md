## Dynamic Feature Drift Injection for Model Robustness

**Concept:** Extend the replay request generation to *actively* inject feature drift based on statistical analysis of historical request data. Instead of simply varying parameters, deliberately alter feature distributions to simulate real-world model degradation scenarios.

**Specification:**

1.  **Historical Data Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Request log (as in the patent).
    *   Function: Analyze feature distributions for each request type. Calculate key statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) for each feature. Track changes in these measures over time windows (e.g., daily, weekly).  Identify features exhibiting significant drift (defined by a threshold on percentage change in statistical measures).
2.  **Drift Injection Profile Generator:**
    *   Input: Drift analysis results, desired severity level (low, medium, high), and feature list.
    *   Function: Create a “drift injection profile” for each replay request batch. This profile specifies which features to modify, the type of modification (e.g., shift mean, increase variance, introduce noise), and the magnitude of the modification.  The severity level dictates the overall intensity of the drift.
3.  **Replay Request Modifier:**
    *   Input: Historical request, drift injection profile.
    *   Function:  Modify the historical request based on the drift injection profile. This can involve:
        *   **Mean Shifting:**  Adding a value to the feature.
        *   **Variance Scaling:** Multiplying the feature by a scaling factor.
        *   **Noise Injection:** Adding random noise (Gaussian, uniform, etc.) to the feature.
        *   **Distribution Transformation:**  Transforming the feature distribution (e.g., from Gaussian to skewed Gaussian).
4.  **Evaluation Integration:** 
    *   Feed the modified requests to both production and experimental models.
    *   Analyze the difference in output, focusing on the impact of the injected drift on model performance.  This can provide insights into model robustness and sensitivity to feature drift.

**Pseudocode (Replay Request Modifier):**

```python
def modify_request(request, drift_profile):
  modified_request = request.copy() # Avoid modifying original
  for feature, drift_params in drift_profile.items():
    if feature in modified_request:
      drift_type = drift_params['type']
      magnitude = drift_params['magnitude']
      
      if drift_type == 'mean_shift':
        modified_request[feature] += magnitude
      elif drift_type == 'variance_scale':
        modified_request[feature] *= magnitude
      elif drift_type == 'noise_injection':
        noise = random.gauss(0, magnitude) # Gaussian noise
        modified_request[feature] += noise
      #Add other drift types as needed.
  return modified_request
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Robustness Testing:**  Simulate real-world drift scenarios before they impact production models.
*   **Targeted Model Improvement:** Identify features that are most sensitive to drift and focus model improvement efforts on those areas.
*   **Adaptive Monitoring:**  Use drift injection to create a “synthetic drift benchmark” for continuous model monitoring.
*   **Automated Drift Detection:** Train a drift detection model on synthetic drifted data to improve its accuracy and generalization ability.
