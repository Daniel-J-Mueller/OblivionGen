## Account Data 'Ghosting' & Predictive Logout

**Concept:** Extend automatic account data removal on logout to include a 'ghosting' phase, proactively mitigating session hijacking risks *before* a formal logout is initiated, and predicting logout intent.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Logout Engine:**

   *   **Input:** User activity data (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, app switching, network activity, time since last interaction).
   *   **Processing:** A machine learning model trained on user behavior patterns, distinguishing between normal activity, potential inactivity indicating intent to step away, and anomalous behavior.
   *   **Output:** A confidence score representing the probability of imminent logout/inactivity. Threshold adjustable per user/site.

**2. Ghosting Protocol:**

   *   **Activation:** Triggered when Predictive Logout Engine exceeds a defined confidence threshold *before* a formal logout request.
   *   **Phase 1: Session State Reduction:** Begin gradually reducing sensitive session state data stored client-side (tokens, cookies, cached credentials). This isnâ€™t immediate removal, but a phased reduction.
   *   **Phase 2: Network Beaconing:**  Send low-frequency "keep-alive" packets with decreasing data payloads to the authentication management service.  These packets serve to verify continued active connectivity, but also subtly 'warn' the server of potentially impending inactivity.
   *   **Phase 3:  Credential 'Blurring' (Optional):**  Employ a client-side encryption/obfuscation scheme on remaining sensitive data, using a rapidly changing key derived from user activity. This creates a moving target for potential attackers, making stolen data quickly useless. This is optional due to performance overhead.

**3.  Client-Side Integration:**

   *   **Authentication Client Modification:** Integrate the Predictive Logout Engine and Ghosting Protocol into the existing authentication client.
   *   **Configuration:** Allow users to customize Ghosting Protocol intensity (speed of data reduction/blurring) and sensitivity.
   *   **Adaptive Learning:** The Predictive Logout Engine should continuously learn from user behavior, improving its accuracy over time.

**4. Server-Side Support:**

   *   **Beacon Monitoring:** The authentication management service should monitor incoming beacons. A sudden cessation of beacons, coupled with no formal logout request, triggers an alert and potential forced logout.
   *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement server-side anomaly detection to identify unusual session activity patterns, further enhancing security.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Logout Engine - Simplified):**

```
function predictLogout(userData) {
  // Extract features from userData (keystrokes, mouse movements, etc.)
  features = extractFeatures(userData);

  // Load trained ML model
  model = loadModel("logout_prediction_model");

  // Predict logout probability
  probability = model.predict(features);

  return probability;
}

function activateGhosting(probability, threshold) {
  if (probability > threshold) {
    startGhostingProtocol();
  }
}
```
