## Dynamic Recommendation 'Worlds'

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply listing recommendations on a page. Create miniature, navigable “worlds” tailored to the user’s current selection and profile, visually representing the recommendations.

**Specification:**

1.  **World Generation Engine:** A system that dynamically generates a 3D (or 2.5D isometric) environment based on the selected item and user data. The environment’s aesthetic and content are determined by a combination of:
    *   **Item Category:** (e.g., a "cozy cabin" for books, a "futuristic cityscape" for tech, a "tropical beach" for swimwear).
    *   **User Preferences:** (e.g., color schemes, architectural styles, preferred brands).
    *   **Recommendation Algorithm Output:** The core logic remains, but the *presentation* is transformed.

2.  **Recommendation Placement:** Recommended items are visually represented *within* the world as interactive objects. 
    *   **Proximity:** Items strongly recommended by an algorithm are positioned closer to the user's initial selection/viewpoint.
    *   **Visual Cueing:** Items relevant to specific algorithms have unique visual characteristics (e.g., glowing for "customers also bought," themed for a specific user interest).
    *   **Scale & Importance:** Item size/prominence within the world correlates with the strength of the recommendation.

3.  **Navigation & Interaction:**
    *   **First/Third Person View:** Allow the user to navigate the world using standard controls.
    *   **Object Inspection:**  Selecting an item displays details (price, reviews, etc.).
    *   **"Add to Cart" within World:** Allow direct purchase from within the environment.

4.  **Adaptive World Complexity:**
    *   **Profile Data:** More comprehensive user profiles generate more detailed and personalized worlds.
    *   **Hardware Constraints:**  Scale world complexity based on user device capabilities (e.g., lower poly count on mobile).

**Pseudocode (World Generation - simplified):**

```
function generateWorld(selectedItem, userProfile, recommendationData):
  worldTheme = determineTheme(selectedItem.category, userProfile.preferences)
  world = createWorld(worldTheme)

  for each recommendation in recommendationData:
    object = createObject(recommendation.item, recommendation.algorithm)
    object.position = calculatePosition(recommendation.strength, world.center)
    world.addObject(object)

  return world
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **AR Integration:**  Project the "world" onto the user's physical environment using augmented reality.
*   **Social Worlds:** Allow users to explore recommendation worlds created by others.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce challenges or rewards for exploring and interacting with the world.
