## Dynamic Skill Tagging & Predictive Agent Augmentation

**Concept:** Expand beyond static agent skillsets by implementing a dynamic skill tagging system driven by real-time call analysis and augmented by AI-predicted skill emergence. This allows for more granular call routing *and* proactive skill development for agents.

**Specifications:**

**I. Real-time Call Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Live audio stream from incoming call. Transcribed text (generated via ASR).  Metadata: Caller ID, time of day, originating location, basic IVR selections.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Keyword/Intent Extraction:** NLP model identifies keywords, phrases, and customer intent.  Beyond basic topic modeling; focused on *specific* problem areas and emotional tone.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Continuous sentiment scoring throughout the call. Flag extreme negative sentiment for escalation prioritization.
    *   **Skill Inference:**  Based on keywords, intent, and sentiment, the system *infers* skills being utilized *by the caller* requiring agent response.  Example: Caller uses technical jargon relating to a specific API – system tags “API Troubleshooting – [API Name]” as a required skill.
*   **Output:** Dynamic Skill Tag List – a real-time list of skills required for the current call.  Confidence score assigned to each tag.

**II. Agent Skill Profile – Dynamic & Predictive:**

*   **Baseline:** Each agent has a standard skill profile (as currently exists).
*   **Real-time Skill Tracking:**  Monitor agent actions during calls.  (What solutions they utilize, what knowledge base articles they access, what steps they take to resolve issues).  Automatically update skill profile *during* the call.
*   **Predictive Skill Modeling:** AI model analyzes agent call history, skill profile, and the evolving skill requirements of incoming calls.
    *   **Skill Gap Analysis:**  Identifies skills the agent *will likely need* based on incoming call trends.
    *   **Proactive Training Recommendation:** System recommends micro-learning modules or knowledge base articles *during* downtime to address skill gaps *before* they impact call handling.
    *   **Skill Emergence Detection:**  Detects when an agent demonstrates proficiency in a new skill area (through successful call resolutions). Automatically adds the skill to their profile and potentially flags them for specialization.

**III. Intelligent Routing Engine – Enhanced by Dynamic Skills:**

*   **Prioritization:**  Routing engine prioritizes calls based on:
    *   Caller Priority (VIP status, SLA agreements).
    *   Call Urgency (sentiment analysis).
    *   Agent Availability.
    *   **Dynamic Skill Match:**  Prioritizes agents possessing *all* the dynamically identified skills required for the call *and* a high confidence level in their proficiency.
*   **Skill Weighting:**  Allows administrators to assign weights to different skills based on business priorities. (e.g., “API Troubleshooting – [API Name]” might be weighted higher than “Basic Customer Service”).
*   **“Skill Bridge” Routing:** If no agent perfectly matches all required skills, the system can route the call to an agent possessing the *most* relevant skills, providing real-time access to knowledge base articles or “expert assist” tools to bridge the skill gap.

**Pseudocode (Routing Engine):**

```
FUNCTION RouteCall(Call):
  SkillList = AnalyzeCall(Call)
  AvailableAgents = GetAvailableAgents()
  BestAgent = NULL
  HighestSkillMatchScore = 0

  FOR Agent IN AvailableAgents:
    SkillMatchScore = CalculateSkillMatchScore(Agent, SkillList)
    IF SkillMatchScore > HighestSkillMatchScore:
      HighestSkillMatchScore = SkillMatchScore
      BestAgent = Agent

  IF BestAgent == NULL:
    // No perfect match, find best approximate
    BestApproximateAgent = FindBestApproximateAgent(SkillList)
    IF BestApproximateAgent != NULL:
      RouteCallToAgent(BestApproximateAgent, SkillList)
    ELSE:
      // Queue call
      QueueCall(Call)
  ELSE:
    RouteCallToAgent(BestAgent, SkillList)

END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers for real-time processing.
*   Speech-to-text (ASR) engine.
*   Natural Language Processing (NLP) models.
*   Machine Learning (ML) platform for predictive modeling.
*   Integration with existing call center infrastructure (ACD, CRM, knowledge base).
*   Real-time data streaming capabilities.
