## Dynamic Neural Network Partitioning for Distributed Edge Processing

**Concept:** Leverage the core idea of skipping layers based on frame similarity to dynamically partition a neural network across multiple edge devices. Instead of just skipping layers *within* a single device, *move* layer processing to other available edge nodes based on computational load and inter-device bandwidth.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Edge Node Network:** A mesh network of edge devices (e.g., smartphones, embedded systems, dedicated processing units). Each node has a processor, memory, and network interface.
*   **Master Node:** A designated node (or rotating designation) responsible for initial frame analysis and partitioning decision-making.
*   **Partitioning Agent:** Software component running on the Master Node, responsible for analyzing frame similarity, estimating computational load, and generating a processing plan.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A low-latency, high-bandwidth communication protocol for transferring intermediate results (e.g., tensor tables, feature maps) between edge nodes. (Consider leveraging existing protocols like gRPC with protocol buffers or a custom UDP-based solution).

**2. Processing Pipeline:**

1.  **Initial Frame Analysis (Master Node):** The first frame (or keyframe) is processed by a subset of the neural network on the Master Node to generate a base tensor table.
2.  **Similarity Assessment:** Subsequent frames are compared to the base tensor table. A similarity metric (e.g., structural similarity index, cosine similarity) is calculated.
3.  **Partitioning Decision:** Based on the similarity metric and estimated computational load of each edge node, the Partitioning Agent determines which layers of the neural network to execute on each node.
    *   **High Similarity:** If the current frame is highly similar to the base frame, a larger portion of the network (including later layers) might be skipped on *all* nodes, or even entirely offloaded to the Master node.
    *   **Low Similarity:**  If the current frame differs significantly, the network is partitioned across more nodes, distributing the computational load. More layers are executed on a broader set of edge devices.
4.  **Layer Execution & Inter-Node Communication:**
    *   Each edge node executes its assigned layers on the current frame.
    *   Intermediate results (e.g., feature maps, tensor tables) are transmitted to the next node in the processing pipeline according to the partitioning plan.
    *   The Master Node aggregates the final results.

**3. Dynamic Load Balancing:**

*   **Node Status Monitoring:** Each edge node periodically reports its CPU/GPU load, memory usage, and network bandwidth to the Master Node.
*   **Partitioning Plan Adjustment:** The Partitioning Agent dynamically adjusts the partitioning plan based on node status reports. If a node is overloaded, its assigned layers are redistributed to other available nodes.
*   **Predictive Load Balancing:** Employ a simple predictive model (e.g., moving average) to anticipate future load fluctuations and proactively adjust the partitioning plan.

**4. Pseudocode (Partitioning Agent):**

```
function partitionNetwork(frame, baseTensorTable, nodeStatus):
  similarity = calculateSimilarity(frame, baseTensorTable)

  if similarity > threshold:
    // Skip layers on all nodes
    partitionPlan = generateSkipPlan(nodeStatus)
  else:
    // Partition network across nodes
    partitionPlan = generateDistributedPlan(frame, nodeStatus)

  // Adjust plan based on node load
  partitionPlan = adjustForLoad(partitionPlan, nodeStatus)

  return partitionPlan
```

**5. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge devices should have sufficient processing power and memory to execute their assigned layers.
*   High-bandwidth, low-latency network connectivity between edge devices is crucial.
*   Consider using hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) on edge devices to speed up layer execution.
*   Consider utilizing specialized network hardware, such as 5G or Wi-Fi 6, to enhance communication performance.

**6. Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time video analytics on drones or robots.
*   Augmented reality applications with low latency.
*   Smart surveillance systems with distributed processing.
*   Self-driving cars with edge-based perception.
