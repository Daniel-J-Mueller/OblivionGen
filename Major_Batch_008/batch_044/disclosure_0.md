## Automated Patch Canary Deployment with User-Defined Risk Profiles

**Specification:** A system enabling users to define risk profiles for patch deployment, triggering automated canary deployments to subsets of their VMs, and providing real-time performance & stability monitoring with automated rollback capabilities.

**Core Concept:** Expand the user control over patch deployment beyond simple approval/denial to encompass *how* patches are rolled out. Introduce the concept of user-defined ‘Risk Profiles’ and automated canary testing.

**Components:**

*   **Risk Profile Editor:** A UI component allowing users to define risk profiles. These profiles consist of:
    *   *Canary Size:* Percentage of VMs to receive the patch initially (e.g., 5%, 10%, 25%).
    *   *Rollout Speed:* Rate at which the patch is rolled out to additional VMs after initial canary phase (e.g., 10% per hour, 25% per day).
    *   *Stability Metrics:*  User-selectable metrics to monitor during rollout (CPU usage, memory utilization, network latency, application response time, error rates, custom application-specific metrics via API).  Thresholds for acceptable performance are defined per metric.
    *   *Rollback Trigger:*  Conditions under which the rollout is automatically paused or rolled back (e.g., any single metric exceeds defined threshold, multiple metrics exceed thresholds, specific error codes detected).
    *   *VM Tagging/Grouping:* Ability to apply different Risk Profiles to different groups of VMs based on tags (e.g., ‘production’, ‘staging’, ‘database’, ‘web-servers’).

*   **Patch Deployment Engine:** Modified from existing system. Receives approved patches and associated Risk Profiles.
    1.  Identifies VMs matching the Risk Profile’s tags.
    2.  Selects a random subset of VMs as the ‘canary’ group based on the defined ‘Canary Size’.
    3.  Deploys the patch to the canary group.
    4.  Initiates real-time monitoring of the defined ‘Stability Metrics’ on the canary group.
    5.  If all metrics remain within acceptable thresholds for a defined period (e.g., 1 hour), the rollout proceeds to the next VM subset at the defined ‘Rollout Speed’.
    6.  If *any* metric exceeds the threshold, the rollout is *immediately* paused, and an alert is generated.  Based on user configuration, a full rollback to the pre-patch state can be automatically initiated.
    7.  Logs all deployment events, metric data, and rollback actions for auditing and analysis.

*   **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:** Displays the status of all ongoing patch deployments, including:
    *   Current rollout stage (canary, partial, complete).
    *   Number of VMs patched and remaining.
    *   Real-time graphs of the monitored ‘Stability Metrics’.
    *   Alerts and warnings related to metric violations.
    *   Rollback status (if applicable).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Patch Deployment Engine):**

```
function deployPatch(patch, riskProfile, vmGroup) {
  canarySize = riskProfile.canarySize
  rolloutSpeed = riskProfile.rolloutSpeed
  stabilityMetrics = riskProfile.stabilityMetrics
  rollbackTrigger = riskProfile.rollbackTrigger

  canaryVMs = selectRandomVMs(vmGroup, canarySize)
  deployPatchToVMs(canaryVMs, patch)

  monitoringResults = monitorVMs(canaryVMs, stabilityMetrics)

  if (monitoringResults.anyMetricExceedsThreshold(rollbackTrigger)) {
    rollbackPatch(canaryVMs, patch)
    alert("Rollback triggered due to metric violation")
    return
  }

  remainingVMs = vmGroup - canaryVMs
  for (i = 0; i < remainingVMs.length; i += rolloutSpeed) {
    batchOfVMs = remainingVMs.slice(i, i + rolloutSpeed)
    deployPatchToVMs(batchOfVMs, patch)
    monitoringResults = monitorVMs(batchOfVMs, stabilityMetrics)
    if (monitoringResults.anyMetricExceedsThreshold(rollbackTrigger)) {
      rollbackPatch(batchOfVMs, patch)
      alert("Rollback triggered due to metric violation")
      return
    }
  }

  alert("Patch deployment completed successfully")
}
```

**Novelty:** Extends patch management from a passive approval/denial model to a proactive, risk-based deployment process.  Automates canary testing and rollback, minimizing the impact of potentially problematic patches. Introduces a level of user control over *how* patches are deployed, tailored to the specific risk tolerance of their applications and infrastructure.
