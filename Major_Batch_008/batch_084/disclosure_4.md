**Adaptive Projection Mapping for Dynamic Environments**

**Concept:** Expand the projection system to dynamically adjust the projected representation not only to the item’s dimensions and distance, but also to *changes* within the projection environment. This goes beyond static surfaces – imagine projecting onto moving objects, or environments with unpredictable obstructions.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a multi-modal sensor array:
    *   **LiDAR:** Real-time depth mapping of the projection environment. Range: 0.5m - 10m. Accuracy: +/- 5mm. Update rate: 30Hz.
    *   **High-Speed Camera:** RGB-D camera capable of capturing visual data and depth information. Resolution: 1920x1080. Frame rate: 60fps.
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Track movement and orientation of the projection device.
*   **Projection System:**
    *   **Micro-Projector Array:** Utilize multiple micro-projectors for increased brightness and coverage area. Resolution: 1280x720 per projector. Lumens: 50 per projector.
    *   **MEMS Mirror System:** Precise control over light beam direction and focus for each projector. Range of motion: +/- 30 degrees. Accuracy: +/- 0.1 degrees.
    *   **Polarization Filters:** Reduce glare and improve contrast, especially on non-ideal surfaces.
*   **Processing Unit:**
    *   **Edge Computing Device:** High-performance processor for real-time data processing and image rendering.
    *   **GPU:** Dedicated graphics processing unit for accelerated image rendering and processing.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    1.  **Environmental Mapping:** LiDAR and camera data are fused to create a dynamic 3D map of the projection environment.
    2.  **Object Tracking:** Identify and track moving objects within the environment.
    3.  **Projection Warping:** Algorithms dynamically warp the projected image to compensate for environmental changes and maintain accurate representation of the item. Key functions:
        *   **Perspective Correction:** Corrects distortion caused by viewing angles.
        *   **Keystone Correction:** Adjusts for trapezoidal distortion.
        *   **Occlusion Handling:** Seamlessly blends projections around obstacles.
        *   **Motion Compensation:** Tracks moving objects and adjusts projections accordingly.
    4.  **Adaptive Brightness Control:** Adjusts projection brightness based on ambient lighting conditions and surface reflectivity.
    5.  **User Interface:** Simple interface to calibrate the system and define the projection area.

**Pseudocode (Projection Warping):**

```
function warp_projection(item_representation, environment_map, object_positions):
  # Transform item representation to 3D space
  item_3d = transform_to_3d(item_representation)

  # Calculate projection matrix based on environment map and object positions
  projection_matrix = calculate_projection_matrix(environment_map, object_positions)

  # Apply projection matrix to item 3D representation
  warped_item = apply_matrix(projection_matrix, item_3d)

  # Render warped item onto projection surface
  render_image(warped_item)

  return rendered_image
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Dynamic Retail Environments:** Project item representations onto moving displays or changing store layouts.
*   **Augmented Reality Experiences:** Project interactive representations onto real-world objects or surfaces.
*   **Robotics and Manufacturing:** Guide robots and workers with projected instructions and visualizations.
*   **Interactive Entertainment:** Create immersive gaming and entertainment experiences.
