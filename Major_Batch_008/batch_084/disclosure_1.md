## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System - 'SkinSense'

**Concept:** Expand beyond purely visual input detection via camera obscuration to integrate localized haptic feedback, creating a more nuanced and intuitive interaction system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of micro-actuators embedded within the device's housing, concentrated around areas a user’s hands are likely to interact with (edges, back surface).  Actuator density: 20 actuators per 10cm<sup>2</sup>. Actuator type: Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) for rapid, localized temperature change & subtle physical deformation.
    *   High-resolution pressure sensors integrated *under* the device’s surface, corresponding 1:1 to the actuator array. Sensor range: 0.1-50 kPa.
    *   Existing camera array (as per the original patent) maintained for initial input detection.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Input Stage:** Camera system detects hand obscuration as described in the original patent.
    *   **Haptic Mapping:** Based on the detected obscuration sequence, the system activates the corresponding actuators *before* the intended application response.  
        *   Example: If the obscuration sequence corresponds to ‘page turn’, actuators on the edge of the device corresponding to the ‘turning’ side activate a slight warming/expansion sensation *just before* the page visually turns.
    *   **Pressure Feedback Loop:**  Pressure sensors detect the user’s touch/grip. This data is used to:
        *   Dynamically adjust actuator force – subtle vibrations for notification, stronger resistance for menu selection.
        *   Distinguish between intentional actions & accidental obstructions.
    *   **AI-Driven Pattern Learning:**
        *   System learns user-specific grip patterns and preferences via machine learning.
        *   AI adjusts haptic feedback intensity & patterns to optimize user experience.
    *   **API for Developer Integration:**  Allows app developers to create custom haptic feedback patterns tied to specific in-app actions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input Detection (Existing Patent Logic)
sequence = detectHandObscurationSequence()

// Haptic Mapping
hapticPattern = getHapticPattern(sequence)

// Pressure Sensor Check (Prevent False Positives)
if (pressureSensorData > threshold) {
  activateHapticPattern(hapticPattern)
}

// AI-Driven Adaptation
userGripPattern = analyzeGripPattern(pressureSensorData)
adjustedHapticPattern = adaptHapticPattern(hapticPattern, userGripPattern)
activateHapticPattern(adjustedHapticPattern)
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond purely visual input to create a multi-sensory interaction. By coupling camera-based gesture recognition with localized haptic feedback, the system provides a more intuitive and immersive user experience. The AI-driven pattern learning and developer API further enhance the system's adaptability and potential for customization.  The intent is to build a 'sixth sense' style input for devices that will become increasingly useful as the resolution of modern displays increases.
