## Adaptive Vendor Scorecard with Predictive Disruption Modeling

**System Overview:** A dynamic vendor scoring system integrated with a predictive disruption model. This goes beyond defect rates to assess a vendor’s *resilience* and potential to cause supply chain interruptions.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Real-Time Data Ingestion:**
    *   Data Sources: Integrates with existing defect history (as per the patent), publicly available data (weather, political instability, economic indicators), vendor’s own production data (if accessible via API), social media sentiment analysis (monitoring news about the vendor and their region).
    *   Data Types: Numerical (defect rates, production volume, lead times), Categorical (vendor location, industry sector, risk profile), Textual (news articles, social media posts).

2.  **Dynamic Scoring Engine:**
    *   Weighting Factors:  Defect rates are *one* component.  Crucially, weighting dynamically adjusts based on:
        *   Scarcity of the product.
        *   Lead time for replacement sourcing.
        *   Vendor’s geographic and geopolitical risk.
        *   Vendor’s financial health (estimated via public data).
        *   Historical responsiveness to issues.
    *   Scoring Methodology: A weighted sum model, with algorithmically adjusted weights.  Weights are updated weekly based on incoming data.
    *   Scoring Bands: Vendors assigned to risk bands (Low, Medium, High, Critical). Thresholds for band assignment are also dynamically adjusted.

3.  **Predictive Disruption Model:**
    *   Algorithm: A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM neural network) trained on historical disruption data (natural disasters, political events, factory fires, etc.).
    *   Input Data:  Real-time data from data ingestion, vendor scores, historical disruption data.
    *   Output:  Probability of disruption for each vendor over the next 30/60/90 days.  Specifically, predictions of potential production delays, volume reductions, or quality issues.

4.  **Automated Remedial Actions:**
    *   Tiered Response: Remedial actions triggered based on vendor risk band *and* disruption probability.
    *   Examples:
        *   **Low Risk/Low Probability:** Routine monitoring.
        *   **Medium Risk/Medium Probability:** Increased inspection frequency, proactive communication with vendor.
        *   **High Risk/High Probability:** Diversification of sourcing, pre-emptive stocking of critical components, automated PO generation for alternate suppliers.
        *   **Critical Risk/High Probability:**  Immediate activation of contingency plans, potential suspension of POs, full supply chain audit.
    *   Automated PO Generation: Integrated with procurement system to automatically generate and send POs to alternate suppliers when disruption probability exceeds a threshold.

**Pseudocode (Remedial Action Logic):**

```
FUNCTION DetermineRemedialAction(vendor_score, disruption_probability)

  IF vendor_score == "Critical" AND disruption_probability > 0.8 THEN
    action = "Activate Contingency Plan"
    SuspendPOs(vendor)
    InitiateSupplyChainAudit(vendor)
  ELSE IF vendor_score == "High" AND disruption_probability > 0.7 THEN
    action = "Increased Inspection & Diversification"
    IncreaseInspectionFrequency(vendor)
    DiversifySourcing(vendor)
  ELSE IF vendor_score == "Medium" AND disruption_probability > 0.5 THEN
    action = "Proactive Communication"
    CommunicateWithVendor(vendor)
  ELSE
    action = "Routine Monitoring"

  RETURN action
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Schema (Simplified):**

*   **Vendor Table:** VendorID, VendorName, Location, RiskProfile, FinancialHealth
*   **Defect Table:** DefectID, VendorID, ProductID, DefectType, Date, Quantity
*   **Disruption Table:** DisruptionID, VendorID, Date, Type, Severity, Impact
*   **Prediction Table:** VendorID, Date, DisruptionProbability, PredictedImpact

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability: System must handle large volumes of data from multiple sources.
*   Real-Time Processing:  Data ingestion and prediction models require low latency.
*   Integration: Seamless integration with existing procurement and supply chain management systems.
*   API Access:  Expose APIs for external access to vendor scores and predictions.
