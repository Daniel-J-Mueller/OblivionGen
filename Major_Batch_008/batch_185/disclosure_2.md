**Automated Product Recommendation via Affective Computing & Dynamic Shelf Adjustment**

**System Overview:** This system layers affective computing – analysis of customer emotional state – with robotic shelf adjustment to dynamically curate product displays based on inferred customer preferences *in-situ*. It builds on the sensor data already collected, but moves beyond simple item selection to proactively *influence* selection.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-modal Sensor Array:** Integrated into facility infrastructure. Includes:
    *   High-resolution RGB-D cameras tracking customer movement, pose, and facial expressions.
    *   Microphone array for voice tone and keyword analysis.
    *   Thermal sensors to detect subtle physiological changes (e.g., increased skin temperature indicating interest/hesitation).
    *   Existing shelf-based weight sensors (from original patent).
*   **Robotic Shelf Units:** Modular shelving capable of vertical and horizontal adjustment via automated actuators. Each shelf segment is independently controllable.
*   **Edge Computing Cluster:**  Localized processing to minimize latency. Handles real-time sensor data fusion, affective state inference, and shelf adjustment commands.
*   **Central Server:**  Stores customer profiles (if opted-in), aggregated data, and learning models.

**Software Components:**

*   **Affective State Inference Engine:** A deep learning model trained on multi-modal data (visual, auditory, thermal) to infer customer emotional state (e.g., happy, curious, frustrated, disinterested). Outputs a probability distribution over emotional states.
*   **Preference Mapping Module:** Correlates inferred emotional states with product categories and specific items.  Uses historical data and real-time feedback to refine mappings.
*   **Dynamic Shelf Adjustment Algorithm:**  Based on inferred preferences, this algorithm determines optimal shelf configurations.  It prioritizes items likely to appeal to the current customer.  Key considerations:
    *   *Vertical Positioning:*  High-value items are placed at eye level.
    *   *Horizontal Proximity:*  Complementary items are grouped together.
    *   *Highlighting:*  Robotic arms can physically push items forward for increased visibility.
*   **Data Logging & Analytics:**  Captures sensor data, inferred emotional states, shelf adjustments, and purchase history for continuous model improvement.

**Pseudocode (Shelf Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustShelf(customerID, sensorData)

    // 1. Infer Emotional State
    emotionalState = InferEmotionalState(sensorData)

    // 2. Retrieve Preference Profile (if available)
    IF customerID EXISTS in database THEN
        preferenceProfile = LoadPreferenceProfile(customerID)
    ELSE
        preferenceProfile = CreateDefaultProfile() //Based on broad demographics

    // 3. Determine Relevant Product Categories & Items
    relevantCategories = DetermineRelevantCategories(emotionalState, preferenceProfile)
    relevantItems = GetItemsInRelevantCategories(relevantCategories)

    // 4. Calculate Shelf Priority Scores
    FOR each item IN relevantItems:
        priorityScore = (EmotionalRelevance * ItemPopularity * PreferenceWeight)

    // 5. Adjust Shelf Configuration
    FOR each shelfSegment:
        bestItem = Item with highest priorityScore
        Move bestItem to shelfSegment
        Highlight bestItem (push forward)

    //6. Log Adjustment and Customer Behavior

END FUNCTION
```

**Operational Scenario:**

1.  Customer enters facility, is identified (via existing systems).
2.  Multi-modal sensor array begins tracking customer.
3.  Affective State Inference Engine analyzes customer's facial expressions, voice tone, and body language.
4.  Dynamic Shelf Adjustment Algorithm calculates optimal shelf configuration based on inferred emotional state and preferences.
5.  Robotic shelf units autonomously adjust to display prioritized items.
6.  System monitors customer behavior (dwell time, item selection) to refine models in real-time.
