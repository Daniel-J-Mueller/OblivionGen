## Adaptive Data Tiering with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the backup/analytical separation by introducing an adaptive data tiering system *within* the backup storage itself, coupled with predictive prefetching based on query patterns. This moves beyond simple backup for analytics to a dynamic, multi-tiered analytical data store.

**Specifications:**

**1. Tiered Storage:**

*   **Tier 1 (Hot):**  NVMe/SSD –  Stores the most recently accessed/queried partitions/data segments.  Designed for sub-second query response times.  Size configurable, dynamically adjusted.
*   **Tier 2 (Warm):**  High-density SSD – Stores frequently accessed partitions/data segments. Latency in the single-digit second range.  Larger capacity than Tier 1.
*   **Tier 3 (Cold):** Object Storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob) – Stores infrequently accessed/archival data. Higher latency but lowest cost.  Unlimited scalability.

**2. Partitioning & Metadata:**

*   The non-relational database is partitioned based on a configurable key (time, user ID, etc.).
*   Metadata tracking access frequency, query patterns, and data age for *each partition*. This metadata is stored separately and updated constantly.
*   Metadata includes “Bloom Filter” summaries of partition contents for efficient query filtering.

**3. Predictive Prefetching Engine:**

*   Monitors query logs and identifies repeating query patterns.
*   Uses a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to predict which partitions will be needed for future queries.
*   Asynchronously prefetches those partitions from lower tiers to higher tiers *before* the queries arrive.
*   Prefetching prioritizes partitions with high predicted usage and low current tier.
*   The ML model is retrained periodically to adapt to changing query patterns.
*   A 'confidence score' is attached to each prediction to control aggressive prefetching.

**4. Data Movement Policy:**

*   Automated data movement based on access frequency and age.
*   Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Least Recently Used (LRU) policies are combined with age-based promotion/demotion.
*   A configurable "grace period" before data is demoted to lower tiers.
*   Data is compacted and optimized during tier demotion (similar to the existing compaction strategies in the patent).

**5. Query Routing & Optimization:**

*   The query engine intelligently routes queries to the appropriate tier based on partition location and data freshness requirements.
*   Query optimizer leverages Bloom Filters to quickly filter out irrelevant partitions.
*   Caching layer in front of each tier for further performance optimization.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```
function predict_next_partitions(query_log, ml_model):
  # Input: query_log (list of recent queries), ml_model (trained model)
  # Output: list of predicted partition IDs

  input_features = extract_features_from_query_log(query_log)
  predicted_partitions = ml_model.predict(input_features)
  return predicted_partitions

function prefetch_partitions(partition_ids, tier_map):
  # tier_map: mapping of tier to storage location
  for partition_id in partition_ids:
    current_tier = get_partition_tier(partition_id)
    if current_tier != "Tier 1":  # Assuming Tier 1 is the fastest
      move_partition_to_tier(partition_id, "Tier 1")

function main_loop():
  query_log = get_recent_queries()
  predicted_partitions = predict_next_partitions(query_log, ml_model)
  prefetch_partitions(predicted_partitions, tier_map)
```

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced query latency.
*   Optimized storage costs.
*   Improved scalability.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing workloads.
