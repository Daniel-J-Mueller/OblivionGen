## Dynamic Bundle Composition based on Real-Time User Context

**Concept:** Extend the bundle recommendation system to dynamically compose bundles *during* a user session, responding not just to the initially selected item, but to *all* real-time user interactions and external contextual data. This goes beyond suggesting pre-defined bundles; it *builds* them on the fly.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Data Ingestion Module:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   User interactions: Page views, clicks, search queries *within* the current session.
    *   Device data: Device type, OS, location (coarse-grained, opt-in).
    *   Time-of-day.
    *   External Data (API access required):
        *   Weather: Current conditions and forecast.
        *   Local Events: Concerts, sports games, conferences (location-based).
        *   Social Media Trends (filtered): Relevant trending topics (opt-in, anonymized).
*   **Processing:** Normalize and weight all inputs. High weight for explicit user actions, lower weight for external data.  Implement a decay function for older interactions, focusing on recent behavior.
*   **Output:** A context vector representing the user's current state.

**2. Dynamic Bundle Builder:**

*   **Input:** Context vector, initial selected item, Associations Dataset (from the original patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Item Scoring:**  Score all items in the catalog based on:
        *   Relevance to the initial item (using Associations Dataset).
        *   Relevance to the context vector (using item attributes and keyword matching).  For example, "rainy day" in the context vector might boost the score of umbrellas, waterproof jackets, or streaming service subscriptions. "Concert nearby" might boost ticket sales or portable chargers.
    *   **Bundle Formulation:**  Employ a greedy algorithm to build bundles:
        1.  Start with the initially selected item.
        2.  Iteratively add the highest-scoring item that:
            *   Doesnâ€™t create a redundant bundle (penalize items already similar to those in the bundle).
            *   Maintains a desired bundle price range (configurable).
            *   Addresses a potential "need gap" in the bundle (e.g., if the user selects a phone, add a charger, case, and screen protector).
    *   **Bundle Diversification:** Introduce a diversification factor to prevent bundles from becoming overly homogenous.  Reward bundles with items from different categories.
*   **Output:**  A ranked list of dynamic bundle recommendations, updated in real-time.

**3. Real-Time Update Mechanism:**

*   **Trigger:** Every user interaction (page view, click, search).
*   **Process:** Re-ingest the updated context vector into the Dynamic Bundle Builder. Re-score items and re-formulate bundles.
*   **UI Update:** Display the updated bundle recommendations to the user without requiring a full page refresh.

**4. A/B Testing Framework:**

*   Track key metrics: Bundle click-through rate, bundle purchase rate, average order value.
*   Experiment with different weighting factors for contextual data.
*   Test different bundle formulation algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Bundle Builder - simplified):**

```
function buildDynamicBundle(contextVector, selectedItem, associationsDataset):
  bundle = [selectedItem]
  candidateItems = allItems - bundle

  while candidateItems is not empty:
    scoredItems = []
    for item in candidateItems:
      relevanceScore = calculateRelevance(item, selectedItem, associationsDataset)
      contextScore = calculateContextScore(item, contextVector)
      totalScore = relevanceScore + contextScore
      scoredItems.append((item, totalScore))

    scoredItems.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    bestItem = scoredItems[0][0]

    if isRedundant(bestItem, bundle) or exceedsPriceLimit(bundle + [bestItem]):
      break

    bundle.append(bestItem)
    candidateItems.remove(bestItem)

  return bundle
```
