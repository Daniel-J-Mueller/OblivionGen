## Dynamic History Partitioning with Adaptive Granularity

**Concept:** Expand the history buffer’s utility by dynamically partitioning it into variable-sized segments, each optimized for different data characteristics. This allows for more targeted compression based on local data patterns, exceeding the limitations of a uniform-depth read.

**Specifications:**

**1. Partitioning Engine:**

*   **Input:** Incoming data stream, configuration parameters (total buffer size, minimum/maximum partition size, adaptation rate).
*   **Process:** Analyze incoming data in real-time to identify distinct data ‘blocks’ based on entropy, frequency distribution, or other relevant metrics.
*   **Output:** A partition map defining the size and starting address of each partition within the history buffer. The map is updated dynamically based on incoming data characteristics.

**2. Adaptive Granularity Controller:**

*   **Input:** Partition map, compression performance metrics (compression ratio, speed), configuration parameters (adaptation sensitivity, smoothing factor).
*   **Process:** Monitor compression performance for each partition. Adjust partition sizes and boundaries based on performance. Prioritize partitions with high compressibility by allocating more buffer space. Implement a smoothing factor to prevent excessive oscillations.
*   **Output:** Updated partition map.

**3. Read Pointer Management:**

*   **Input:** Partition map, read pointer value, depth value (expressed as a percentage of the *current* partition size).
*   **Process:** Calculate the absolute buffer address based on the current partition and the depth value. The read pointer effectively 'wraps' within the current partition. When the depth value is reached, the partition boundary is crossed, and the pointer resets to the beginning of the next partition.
*   **Output:** Absolute buffer address for data retrieval.

**4. Data Structures:**

*   **Partition Map:** Array of structures, each containing:
    *   `start_address`: Integer representing the starting address of the partition.
    *   `size`: Integer representing the size of the partition.
    *   `data_type`: Enum representing the type of data stored in the partition (e.g., text, image, audio).
*   **Read Pointer Structure:**
    *   `partition_index`: Integer representing the current partition.
    *   `offset`: Integer representing the offset within the current partition.

**Pseudocode (Read Pointer Management):**

```
function get_buffer_address(partition_index, offset):
  partition = partition_map[partition_index]
  absolute_address = partition.start_address + offset
  return absolute_address

function increment_read_pointer(current_pointer, depth, partition_map):
  current_partition_index = current_pointer.partition_index
  current_offset = current_pointer.offset

  if current_offset < depth:
    current_pointer.offset += 1
    return current_pointer

  else:
    current_pointer.partition_index += 1
    current_pointer.offset = 0

    if current_pointer.partition_index >= len(partition_map):
      current_pointer.partition_index = 0

    return current_pointer
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The partitioning engine could leverage machine learning techniques to predict optimal partition boundaries.
*   A hardware implementation would benefit from dedicated memory controllers for each partition to enable parallel data access.
*   The depth value could be dynamically adjusted based on the characteristics of the current partition.
