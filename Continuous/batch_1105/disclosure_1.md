## Adaptive Granularity Component Loading

**Specification:** Develop a system that dynamically adjusts the granularity of component loading based on user interaction *predictability*. This builds on the concept of deferred loading but introduces a predictive element.

**Core Concept:** Instead of simply deferring all control code, the system analyzes user interaction patterns *during* initial view rendering.  High-predictability interactions (e.g., simple button presses in a known sequence) trigger pre-fetching of associated code in the background *before* the interaction occurs. Low-predictability interactions (e.g., free-form text input, complex gestures) still trigger on-demand loading, but with prioritized delivery based on real-time system load.

**Components:**

*   **Interaction Predictor:** An algorithm (potentially machine learning-based) that analyzes user actions during the initial view rendering. This component identifies common interaction patterns and assigns a "predictability score" to potential subsequent interactions.  Initial training data can be based on aggregated user behavior data.
*   **Prefetch Manager:** Responsible for proactively fetching control code based on the predictability scores.  It maintains a priority queue of code modules to fetch, prioritizing those with the highest scores and lowest estimated loading times.  A caching layer is critical here.
*   **Adaptive Loader:**  Manages both pre-fetched and on-demand code loading.  It intelligently handles asynchronous requests and ensures that the UI remains responsive even when loading code.  This component can also implement a "graceful degradation" strategy, prioritizing essential code modules over less critical ones if the system is under heavy load.
*   **Event Queuing System:** An efficient queuing mechanism to handle user interactions, prioritizing those tied to pre-fetched components.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// During initial view rendering
InteractionPredictor.analyze(userActions);
predictedInteractions = InteractionPredictor.getPredictedInteractions();

// Prefetch loop (runs in background)
for each interaction in predictedInteractions:
    if (InteractionPredictor.getPredictabilityScore(interaction) > threshold) {
        PrefetchManager.prefetchCode(interaction.codeModule);
    }

// Event Handler
onUserInteraction(event) {
    if (PrefetchManager.isCodePrefetched(event.codeModule)) {
        // Execute pre-fetched code directly
        executeCode(event.codeModule);
    } else {
        // Request code on-demand
        AdaptiveLoader.requestCode(event.codeModule);
    }
}
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Code Modules:** Components should be packaged as independent code modules with well-defined interfaces.
*   **Caching:** A robust caching layer is essential to minimize loading times and network traffic.
*   **Prioritization:** The Adaptive Loader should prioritize code requests based on factors such as user urgency, system load, and code module size.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement graceful error handling to prevent UI freezes or crashes in case of code loading failures.
*   **Network Optimization:** Use techniques such as code compression and caching to minimize network bandwidth usage.
