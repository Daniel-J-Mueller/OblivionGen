## Adaptive Test Case Mutation & Parallel Execution

**Concept:** Dynamically mutate test cases *during* execution on worker nodes, exploring edge cases revealed by real-time system behavior. This dramatically expands test coverage beyond pre-defined cases, while leveraging parallel execution for speed.

**Specs:**

**1. Mutation Engine (Worker Node Component):**

*   **Input:** Original test case, real-time system telemetry (CPU load, memory usage, network latency, API response times – streamed from the tested application/system), mutation ruleset.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze telemetry.
    *   Based on telemetry & mutation ruleset, generate variations of the test case. Examples:
        *   Increased/decreased input data size.
        *   Modified request timing (jitter injection).
        *   Altered parameter values (within defined ranges).
        *   Randomized order of operations.
    *   Prioritize mutations: Assign a 'mutation score' based on telemetry anomalies – mutations addressing likely failure points receive higher priority.
    *   Execute mutations.
*   **Output:**  Original test result + results of mutated test cases + telemetry data from mutation execution.

**2. Centralized Mutation Ruleset Manager:**

*   **Function:**  Stores, updates, and distributes mutation rulesets to worker nodes.
*   **Ruleset Format:**  JSON or similar, defining mutation strategies, parameter ranges, and prioritization logic.  Example:
    ```json
    {
      "mutation_name": "InputSizeVariation",
      "target_parameter": "data_payload",
      "variation_type": "range",
      "min_value": 100,
      "max_value": 1000,
      "step_size": 100,
      "trigger_condition": "CPU_load > 80%"
    }
    ```
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Allows for A/B testing of different mutation rulesets, and real-time updates based on overall system performance.

**3. Parallel Execution Framework:**

*   **Client/Orchestration Layer:**
    *   Divides the original test case into sub-tasks.
    *   Distributes these sub-tasks (including the original and mutated variations) across available worker nodes.
    *   Manages task dependencies and synchronization.
*   **Worker Node Implementation:**
    *   Receives sub-tasks from the orchestration layer.
    *   Executes the assigned tasks, including running the mutation engine (if applicable).
    *   Streams results and telemetry back to the central aggregator.

**Pseudocode (Client Orchestration Layer):**

```
function run_test(test_case):
  sub_tasks = divide_test_case(test_case)
  mutation_tasks = []
  for sub_task in sub_tasks:
    mutation_tasks.append(sub_task)
    #Dynamically create a task to run the subtask with mutation.
    mutation_tasks.append(create_mutation_task(sub_task))

  #Distribute the tasks across worker nodes.
  results = distribute_tasks(mutation_tasks)

  #Aggregate and analyze the results.
  aggregated_results = aggregate_results(results)

  return aggregated_results
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static test case design by actively mutating tests *during* execution, based on real-time system behavior. This creates a dynamically evolving test suite, increasing coverage and revealing subtle bugs that static tests would miss. The integration with parallel execution maximizes efficiency. It’s a self-improving test framework.
