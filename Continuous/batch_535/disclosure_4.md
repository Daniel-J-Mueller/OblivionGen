**Adaptive Credential Orchestration via Biometric-Tied Temporal Keys**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Expand beyond static stored domain names and security credentials by implementing a system where credentials aren't *stored* long-term, but dynamically generated and validated using a combination of biometric authentication, temporal keys, and reverse DNS lookup confirmation.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Biometric Sensor Interface:** Integrated with the client computing device (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint – selectable by user/administrator).
*   **Temporal Key Generator (TKGen):**  Software component generating short-lived, cryptographically secure keys. Keys have a configurable lifespan (e.g., 60 seconds – adjustable).
*   **Credential Orchestrator (CO):** The central control module, responsible for request handling, biometric verification, key generation, credential assembly, and communication with the network site.
*   **Secure Element/Enclave:** Hardware-based security module to protect the private key used for TKGen and store sensitive biometric templates.
*   **Reverse DNS Validator (RDV):** Module performing reverse DNS lookups as in the provided patent, but used as *one* component in a multi-factor verification.
*   **Network Site Interface (NSI):** Component that allows the system to communicate with and authenticate to network sites.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Network Site Request:** A user attempts to access a network site.
2.  **Authentication Trigger:** The system intercepts the connection attempt.
3.  **Biometric Verification:** The CO prompts the user for biometric authentication.
4.  **Key Generation:** Upon successful biometric verification, the TKGen generates a unique, short-lived temporal key.
5.  **Credential Assembly:**  The CO assembles a credential based on:
    *   The temporal key.
    *   A hash of the network site's domain name.
    *   A current timestamp.
    *   A pre-shared secret key (if configured for the site).
6.  **Reverse DNS Confirmation:** The RDV performs a reverse DNS lookup on the network site's IP address. This result is *included* in the assembled credential, but does *not* serve as the sole basis for authentication.
7.  **Credential Transmission:** The assembled credential is transmitted to the network site via the NSI.
8.  **Network Site Validation:** The network site performs the following validation steps:
    *   Verify the timestamp is within an acceptable window.
    *   Decrypt the credential using the pre-shared secret (if applicable).
    *   Confirm the hash of the domain name matches the expected value.
    *   Verify the temporal key is valid (using a pre-shared encryption key).
    *   Confirm the reverse DNS result matches a known value.
9.  **Session Establishment:** If all validations succeed, a secure session is established.

**IV. Pseudocode (CO - Credential Orchestrator):**

```pseudocode
function handleNetworkRequest(networkSiteDomain, networkSiteIP):
    if isBiometricAuthEnabled():
        if verifyBiometricAuthentication():
            temporalKey = generateTemporalKey()
            domainHash = hashDomainName(networkSiteDomain)
            timestamp = getCurrentTimestamp()
            reverseDNSResult = performReverseDNSLookup(networkSiteIP)
            credential = assembleCredential(temporalKey, domainHash, timestamp, reverseDNSResult)
            transmitCredential(credential)
        else:
            displayAuthenticationError()
    else:
        // Fallback to existing authentication methods
        // (e.g., password-based authentication)
        displayAuthenticationError()

function assembleCredential(temporalKey, domainHash, timestamp, reverseDNSResult):
    // Combine the values into a single credential string/object
    // using a secure hashing and encryption algorithm
    credential = hashAndEncrypt(temporalKey + domainHash + timestamp + reverseDNSResult)
    return credential
```

**V. Considerations:**

*   **Temporal Key Lifespan:** The lifespan of the temporal key must be carefully balanced between security and usability. Shorter lifespans increase security but require more frequent authentication.
*   **Pre-Shared Secrets:** Utilizing pre-shared secrets adds an extra layer of security, but requires secure key exchange mechanisms.
*   **Biometric Security:**  The security of the biometric authentication system is paramount. Secure storage and processing of biometric templates are essential.
*   **Offline Operation:**  Consider how the system will handle offline operation or network connectivity issues. Potentially store a limited number of pre-generated temporal keys for short-term use.
*   **Hardware Enclave:** Utilize a hardware enclave (e.g., Trusted Platform Module) to protect sensitive keys and biometric templates.
