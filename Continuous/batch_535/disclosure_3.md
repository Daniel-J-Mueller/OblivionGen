## Adaptive Policy Shaping via Predictive Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the existing policy recommendation system to *proactively* shape policies based on predicted future permission usage, rather than solely reacting to past or current usage. This anticipates need and minimizes disruption for the identity.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Historical permission usage data for the identity, aggregated anonymized data from similar identities (defined by role, department, access patterns etc.), real-time contextual data (time of day, location (if permitted), project involvement).
    *   Process: Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM neural network, Prophet) to predict the probability of permission usage within defined time horizons (e.g., next hour, next day, next week). Model must account for seasonality and trends.
    *   Output: Probability distribution for each permission, indicating the likelihood of usage within each time horizon.

2.  **Dynamic Policy Construction:**
    *   Input: Predicted permission usage probabilities, existing available policies, current attached policies to the identity.
    *   Process:
        *   Algorithm to assemble a 'predicted need' policy subset based on permissions exceeding a defined probability threshold.
        *   Comparison of ‘predicted need’ subset with current attached policies. Identify gaps (missing permissions) and overlaps (unnecessary permissions).
        *   Construct a proposed policy adjustment:
            *   Add policies to cover missing permissions. Prioritize policies granting the *minimum* necessary permissions to satisfy the predicted need.
            *   Remove policies granting permissions with consistently low predicted usage probabilities.
    *   Output: A proposed policy adjustment set – a list of policies to add and/or remove.

3.  **User Interface Integration:**
    *   Present proposed policy adjustments to an administrator/policy owner with a confidence score based on the prediction accuracy.
    *   Allow administrator to review and approve/reject proposed adjustments.
    *   Option to schedule automatic policy adjustments based on predefined confidence thresholds.
    *   Visual display of predicted permission usage and the impact of proposed adjustments. (e.g., A heatmap showing predicted permission usage over time, highlighting the effect of adding/removing policies).

4. **Policy Granularity & Modularization:**
    *   Policies should be designed with a high degree of granularity. Instead of broad "read access to project X," policies should be "read access to file Y within project X."
    *   Implement a modular policy structure, where policies are composed of smaller permission units. This allows for fine-grained adjustments without requiring the creation of entirely new policies.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_and_adjust_policy(identity):
    predicted_permissions = BehavioralPredictionEngine.predict(identity)
    current_policy = PolicyManager.get_current_policy(identity)

    needed_permissions = []
    for permission, probability in predicted_permissions:
        if probability > THRESHOLD_VALUE:
            needed_permissions.append(permission)

    missing_permissions = needed_permissions - current_policy.permissions
    unnecessary_permissions = current_policy.permissions - needed_permissions

    proposed_additions = PolicyManager.find_policies_for_permissions(missing_permissions)
    proposed_removals = PolicyManager.find_policies_for_permissions(unnecessary_permissions)

    return proposed_additions, proposed_removals
```
