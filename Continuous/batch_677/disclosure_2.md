## Dynamic Product Scene Generation

**Concept:** Expand the concept of displaying product graphics with contextual overlays ("callouts") to creating *fully dynamic scenes* surrounding the product, generated procedurally based on customer data and product attributes. The core idea is to move beyond static images and overlays to interactive, 3D-like environments.

**Specs:**

1.  **Scene Database:**  A database containing modular 3D assets (furniture, props, backgrounds, lighting presets) categorized by style (modern, rustic, minimalist, etc.).  Assets would have associated metadata: style tags, compatibility tags (e.g., “works well with ‘leather’ tagged products”), and cost (rendering complexity).

2.  **Customer Profile Integration:**  The system accesses the customer’s profile to determine:
    *   **Style Preference:**  (explicitly stated or inferred from purchase history/browsing behavior).  This dictates the style tags used for scene asset selection.
    *   **Location:**  Geographic location to influence ambient lighting (time of day, weather) and potentially include localized props/backgrounds.
    *   **Demographics:**  (Age, gender, etc.) to subtly influence scene styling (e.g., a ‘teen’ profile might lean towards more vibrant colors).

3.  **Product Attribute Extraction:**  The system analyzes product data to identify key attributes:
    *   **Material:** (wood, metal, fabric, etc.) – influences material selection for surrounding props.
    *   **Color Palette:** –  guides color choices for the scene.
    *   **Function:** (e.g., “sofa,” “table lamp,” “running shoe”) – dictates the type of environment (living room, office, outdoor trail).

4.  **Procedural Scene Generation Engine:**
    *   **Layout Algorithm:**  Based on the product function, the algorithm determines a basic room/environment layout.
    *   **Asset Selection:**  The engine selects assets from the Scene Database based on customer preferences, product attributes, and a ‘coherence score’ (to ensure assets visually fit together).
    *   **Lighting & Rendering:**  Dynamic lighting is applied based on the customer’s location and time of day. The scene is rendered using a real-time rendering engine (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine) or a pre-rendered image sequence.
    *   **Interactive Elements:** Allow customers to ‘walk around’ the scene, adjust lighting, or swap out props (within pre-defined constraints) to personalize the view.

5.  **Callout Integration:**  Existing callout functionality is retained.  Callouts are now displayed *within* the dynamically generated scene, attached to the appropriate product features.

**Pseudocode (Scene Generation):**

```
function GenerateProductScene(customerProfile, productData):
  styleTags = GetStyleTags(customerProfile)
  environmentType = DetermineEnvironmentType(productData)
  sceneLayout = CreateSceneLayout(environmentType)

  assets = SelectAssets(styleTags, productData, sceneLayout)

  for each asset in assets:
    PlaceAssetInScene(asset, sceneLayout)

  lighting = CreateLighting(customerProfile.location, customerProfile.timeOfDay)
  ApplyLighting(lighting)

  RenderScene()
  return Scene
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply displaying products with overlays to creating *immersive, personalized environments* around them. It dynamically generates a scene tailored to the individual customer, enhancing engagement and providing a more realistic product visualization. It's a shift from product display to *product experience*.
