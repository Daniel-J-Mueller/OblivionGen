## Adaptive RF Mesh with Predictive Disconnect

**Concept:** Expand on the disconnection detection to proactively *shift* network traffic *before* a disconnection occurs, utilizing predicted failure points within a wireless mesh network. This isn’t just about reacting to a broken link, but preemptively routing around *potential* breaks.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Designation:** Each wireless device is designated as either a ‘core’ node, ‘edge’ node, or ‘relay’ node. Core nodes have stable power and backhaul. Edge nodes are user-facing. Relay nodes provide intermediate connectivity.
*   **Multi-Path RSSI Tracking:** Beyond the standard RSSI measurements, each node maintains a running history of RSSI values for *multiple* potential paths to reach core nodes. This isn't just A->B, but A->C->D->Core, A->E->F->Core, etc.
*   **Predictive Failure Algorithm:** Implement a time-series analysis (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA) on RSSI data for each path. The algorithm calculates a "path stability score" representing the likelihood of a path remaining viable within a short timeframe (e.g., next 5-10 seconds).  Key parameters include rate of RSSI decline, variance in RSSI, and historical failure rate of that specific path.
*   **Dynamic Path Weighting:** Paths are assigned weights based on their stability scores. Higher stability = higher weight.
*   **Traffic Shifting Protocol:** When the stability score of a primary path drops below a threshold, traffic is *gradually* shifted to alternative paths with higher weights *before* the primary path fails completely.  This is done using a weighted round-robin or similar method.  The shift happens over several transmission cycles to avoid disruption.
*   **Beaconing & Neighborhood Awareness:** Nodes regularly beacon their stability scores and available paths to their neighbors. This allows for distributed decision-making and faster adaptation to network changes.
*   **Failure Confirmation & Path Pruning:** If a path *does* fail, the information is propagated throughout the network. The failed path is removed from consideration, and the stability scores of alternative paths are recalculated.
*   **Adaptive Beacon Rate:** Nodes adjust their beaconing rate based on network instability. Higher instability = more frequent beaconing.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Long-term RSSI data is used to train a machine learning model that can predict potential failure points with greater accuracy. This model can refine the path weighting algorithm and provide early warnings of network issues.

**Pseudocode (Traffic Shifting):**

```
// Node: Current Node
// PrimaryPath: Current Primary Path to Core Node
// AlternativePaths: List of Alternative Paths to Core Node

function ShiftTraffic() {

  if (PrimaryPath.StabilityScore < Threshold) {

    // Calculate weights for alternative paths based on their stability scores
    for each AlternativePath in AlternativePaths {
      AlternativePath.Weight = AlternativePath.StabilityScore
    }

    // Normalize weights to sum to 1
    TotalWeight = sum(AlternativePath.Weight)
    for each AlternativePath in AlternativePaths {
      AlternativePath.Weight = AlternativePath.Weight / TotalWeight
    }

    // Distribute traffic across alternative paths based on their weights
    for each Packet to Send {
      RandomNumber = generateRandomNumber(0, 1)
      CumulativeWeight = 0
      for each AlternativePath in AlternativePaths {
        CumulativeWeight += AlternativePath.Weight
        if (RandomNumber < CumulativeWeight) {
          Send Packet via AlternativePath
          break
        }
      }
    }

    //Gradually reduce traffic on PrimaryPath
    ReduceTrafficOnPrimaryPath(Percentage)
  }
}

```
