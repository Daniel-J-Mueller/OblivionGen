## Dynamic Interest-Based Persona Creation & Predictive Query Expansion

**Concept:** Leverage trending interest data, combined with user search history *beyond* the immediate query, to construct a dynamic user persona, then proactively expand the current query with related, anticipated interests *before* presenting results. This goes beyond simple recommendation; it anticipates *what the user will ask next* and integrates it into the current search experience.

**Specifications:**

**I. Persona Construction Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Current search query (from patent 9218392).
    *   User search history (last 30-90 days, configurable).
    *   User-provided profile data (if available – age range, location, explicitly stated interests).
    *   Trending interest data (from patent 9218392 – identified via executed search queries).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Interest Vector Creation:** Each interest (derived from search history and trending data) is represented as a vector of keywords and associated weights. Weights are determined by frequency of occurrence, recency, and user engagement (click-through rates, dwell time).
    *   **Persona Clustering:**  User search history is analyzed using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify dominant interest groups.  This creates a multi-faceted persona with varying degrees of affinity for each interest group.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The persona is continuously updated with each new search query, adjusting interest weights and cluster affinities in real-time.
*   **Output:** A dynamic user persona represented as a weighted vector of interest clusters.

**II. Predictive Query Expansion Module:**

*   **Input:** Current search query & Dynamic User Persona
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Interest Mapping:** Map the current search query keywords to the user’s dominant interest clusters.
    2.  **Anticipatory Keyword Generation:**  Based on the mapped interests and trending data, generate a set of anticipatory keywords – terms the user is *likely* to search for next, based on their profile. Use a language model (e.g., transformer-based) to predict related terms, prioritizing those aligned with the user’s current search context and historical interests.
    3.  **Query Augmentation:**  Subtly augment the original search query with the anticipatory keywords. This is *not* a boolean OR expansion. Instead, the system should treat the augmented query as a set of "soft constraints" that influence the ranking of search results.
*   **Output:**  An augmented search query with subtly enhanced relevance to the user's predicted interests.

**III. Ranking & Presentation Module:**

*   **Algorithm:** A hybrid ranking algorithm that combines:
    *   Traditional keyword matching.
    *   Semantic similarity (using word embeddings).
    *   A “persona boost” – results that align with the user’s predicted interests receive a higher ranking.
*   **Presentation:**
    *   Standard search results.
    *   A "Related Interests" section displaying the anticipatory keywords and corresponding search suggestions. This allows the user to explicitly explore the predicted interests.
    *   "Smart Snippets" - Short summaries of search results highlighting aspects relevant to the user’s predicted interests.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Persona Construction Module
function buildPersona(userSearchHistory, trendingData, userProfile) {
  interestVectors = createInterestVectors(userSearchHistory, trendingData);
  personaClusters = clusterInterestVectors(interestVectors, userProfile);
  return personaClusters;
}

// Predictive Query Expansion Module
function expandQuery(currentQuery, personaClusters, trendingData) {
  mappedInterests = mapQueryToInterests(currentQuery, personaClusters);
  predictedKeywords = generatePredictedKeywords(mappedInterests, trendingData);
  augmentedQuery = createAugmentedQuery(currentQuery, predictedKeywords);
  return augmentedQuery;
}

// Ranking & Presentation Module
function rankResults(augmentedQuery, searchResults, personaClusters) {
  rankedResults = applyHybridRankingAlgorithm(augmentedQuery, searchResults, personaClusters);
  return rankedResults;
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Modal Persona:** Incorporate data from other sources, such as social media activity, purchase history, and location data, to create a more comprehensive user persona.
*   **Personalized Language Models:** Train a personalized language model for each user to improve the accuracy of predicted keywords.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously refine the persona construction and query expansion algorithms based on user feedback and engagement.
