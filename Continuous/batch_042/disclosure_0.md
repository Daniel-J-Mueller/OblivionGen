## Pixel-Selective Backlight Modulation

**Concept:** Implement a secondary, micro-LED layer *behind* the primary display, with each micro-LED directly corresponding to a pixel (or subpixel) in the primary display. This allows for dynamic, per-pixel backlight control, exceeding the contrast capabilities of traditional backlights and enabling true blacks and extreme highlights.

**Specs:**

*   **Micro-LED Array:**  High-density (e.g., >1000 PPI) micro-LED array positioned directly behind the primary display panel. Each micro-LED is individually addressable.
*   **Addressing Scheme:**  Active matrix addressing, similar to the primary display. A separate backplane layer manages the micro-LEDs.
*   **Control Algorithm:**  A real-time algorithm processes the video signal and determines the optimal brightness level for each micro-LED. 
    *   **Black Level Control:**  Micro-LED is fully off for true black.
    *   **Highlight Boost:** Micro-LED brightness can exceed the primary displayâ€™s maximum brightness for highlights.
    *   **Grayscale Enhancement:** Micro-LED brightness can supplement or modulate the grayscale value of the primary display, increasing dynamic range.
*   **Optical Stack:** 
    *   **Diffuser Layer:** A thin diffuser layer between the micro-LED array and the primary display to distribute light evenly.
    *   **Polarizer/Analyzer:** Polarizing films to minimize reflections and maximize contrast.
*   **Power Management:**  Individual power regulation for each micro-LED (or groups of micro-LEDs) to optimize efficiency.
*   **Data Interface:** High-bandwidth, low-latency data interface to transmit control signals to the micro-LED array.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// For each pixel (x, y)
{
  // Read pixel color value from video signal: (R, G, B)
  // Read current brightness level of the corresponding primary display pixel

  // Calculate target brightness for the micro-LED based on:
  //   1. Pixel color values (R, G, B)
  //   2. Primary display pixel brightness
  //   3. Desired contrast ratio
  //   4. Ambient light conditions

  // If pixel is dark (low R, G, B values)
  //   Turn off micro-LED
  // Else
  //   Set micro-LED brightness to calculated target value

  // Apply dynamic range compression/expansion algorithm
  //   (to maximize perceived contrast)
}
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Subpixel Control:**  Address each micro-LED *array* (e.g., red, green, blue subpixels) individually for even finer control over color and brightness.
*   **Ambient Light Compensation:**  Use ambient light sensors to dynamically adjust micro-LED brightness and contrast.
*   **Local Dimming Enhancement:**  Instead of full off, allow micro-LEDs to dim to extremely low levels to create a more subtle and nuanced black.
*   **HDR Mapping:**  Implement an advanced HDR mapping algorithm to maximize dynamic range and color accuracy.
