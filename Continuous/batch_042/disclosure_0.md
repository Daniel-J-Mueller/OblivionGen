## Dynamic Proof-of-Work Difficulty Adjustment via Client Reputation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the difficulty of the proof-of-work (PoW) task based on a client’s established reputation, assessed through a decentralized ledger.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of a static PoW difficulty, the system assigns a baseline difficulty, then modulates it up or down based on the client's 'trust score'.  Clients with consistently successful authorizations and no flagged behaviors receive reduced PoW difficulty. Those with failed attempts or suspected malicious activity face increased difficulty, potentially escalating to complete denial of service.

**Components:**

*   **Reputation Ledger:**  A distributed ledger (blockchain-based preferred, but not mandatory) storing each client’s authorization history, including timestamps, successful/failed PoW completions, and any flagged anomalies.  Clients are identified by a public key.
*   **Authorization Server:**  The service handling SPA requests.  It interacts with the Reputation Ledger.
*   **Client Agent:** Software on the client device responsible for generating and submitting the PoW solution, and for updating the client's reputation (via transactions on the ledger).
*   **Anomaly Detection Module:**  Analyzes authorization requests and PoW solutions for suspicious patterns (e.g., consistently submitting invalid solutions, rapid-fire requests from multiple IPs). Flags anomalies to the Authorization Server and potentially updates the client's reputation.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Client Initialization:** Upon first access, a client is assigned a neutral reputation score (e.g., 50/100). The client generates a key pair and registers the public key with the system (potentially requiring a small initial stake or proof-of-identity).
2.  **SPA Request:** The client receives a request for authorization.
3.  **Difficulty Calculation:** The Authorization Server queries the Reputation Ledger to retrieve the client’s current reputation score. It calculates the PoW difficulty based on a formula:

    `Difficulty = BaseDifficulty * (1 + (ReputationScore / 100) * DifficultyModifier)`

    *   `BaseDifficulty`:  A globally configured baseline difficulty.
    *   `ReputationScore`: The client's score from the Reputation Ledger (0-100).
    *   `DifficultyModifier`:  A configurable value controlling the sensitivity of the difficulty adjustment.
4.  **PoW Generation:** The client receives the adjusted difficulty and generates a valid PoW solution.
5.  **Verification & Authentication:** The Authorization Server verifies the PoW solution and authenticates the SPA request (as per the original patent).
6.  **Reputation Update:**

    *   **Success:** If the PoW verification and authentication succeed, the client’s reputation score is *increased* by a small amount. This is recorded on the Reputation Ledger.
    *   **Failure:** If either verification or authentication fails, the client’s reputation score is *decreased*. Repeated failures may result in the client being temporarily or permanently blocked.
    *   **Anomaly Flag:** If the Anomaly Detection Module flags a request, the client’s reputation is significantly reduced.

**Pseudocode (Authorization Server - Difficulty Calculation):**

```
function calculateDifficulty(clientID):
  reputation = getReputation(clientID) // Query Reputation Ledger
  difficulty = BaseDifficulty * (1 + (reputation / 100) * DifficultyModifier)
  return difficulty
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Resource Consumption:**  Trusted clients perform less computationally intensive PoW, reducing overall system load.
*   **Improved Security:**  Increased difficulty for suspected malicious actors deters attacks.
*   **Decentralized Trust:**  The Reputation Ledger provides a transparent and auditable trust system.
*   **Sybil Resistance:**  Makes it more expensive for attackers to create multiple fake clients.
