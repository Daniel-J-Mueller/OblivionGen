## Dynamic Spectrum Allocation via Predictive Interference Mapping

**Core Concept:** Extend the DFS channel assessment beyond reactive avoidance of radar, and proactively *shape* spectrum usage based on predicted interference landscapes, incorporating machine learning to anticipate interference *before* it happens. This goes beyond simply choosing the "least busy" channel; it aims to *create* less busy channels.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Tri-band (2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz) capable radios on the device.
    *   Dedicated, low-power processor core for running the interference prediction model.
    *   High-precision Time-of-Arrival (ToA) or Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) module for localization of interfering signals (optional, for enhanced accuracy).

*   **Software/Firmware Components:**
    *   **Interference Mapping Module:** Continuously scans the spectrum, identifying signal sources (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, microwave, etc.). Records signal strength, frequency, and estimated location using triangulation or signal fingerprinting.
    *   **Predictive Interference Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, GRU, or Transformer) trained on historical interference data, location data, time of day, day of week, and potentially external data sources (e.g., weather, local events).  The model predicts future interference levels for each frequency band.
    *   **Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Algorithm:**  This algorithm uses the predictions from the interference model to select the optimal channel for both the primary connection (to the existing AP) and the secondary AP created on the device. It prioritizes channels with the lowest predicted interference *and* considers the potential impact of its own transmissions on other devices.
    *   **Adaptive Transmission Power Control:** Adjusts the transmission power of both radios based on the predicted interference and the distance to the receiving device.  Lower power is used when possible to minimize interference with other devices.
    *   **Cooperative Interference Avoidance:** Enables devices to share interference data with each other (via a secure protocol). This creates a "swarm intelligence" effect, allowing devices to collectively avoid interference and optimize spectrum usage.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Algorithm):**

```
// Input: List of available channels, interference predictions for each channel, current channel

function selectOptimalChannel(availableChannels, interferencePredictions, currentChannel):

    // Weighting factors (tunable)
    weightInterference = 0.7
    weightCurrentChannelProximity = 0.3

    bestChannel = currentChannel
    bestScore = -Infinity

    for each channel in availableChannels:
        // Calculate a score based on interference prediction and proximity to current channel
        interferenceScore = 1 - interferencePredictions[channel] // Lower interference = higher score
        proximityScore = 1 - abs(channel - currentChannel) // Closer channel = higher score

        totalScore = (weightInterference * interferenceScore) + (weightCurrentChannelProximity * proximityScore)

        if totalScore > bestScore:
            bestScore = totalScore
            bestChannel = channel

    return bestChannel
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond *reacting* to interference and actively *shapes* the spectrum landscape. The predictive model allows for proactive channel selection, minimizing interference and maximizing throughput.  The cooperative aspect creates a more efficient and resilient network. This isn’t just about DFS; it’s about intelligent spectrum management.
