## Adaptive Huffman Tree Pruning for Dynamic Datasets

**Concept:** This design focuses on dynamically restructuring the Huffman tree *during* encoding and decoding to optimize for changing data distributions in streaming or dynamic datasets. The existing patent centers on controlled tree building, but doesn't address continuous adaptation *after* initial construction. This allows for far more efficient compression of constantly evolving data.

**Specs:**

1.  **Node Weighting & Decay:** Each leaf node in the Huffman tree will have an associated weight representing the frequency of its symbol. This is standard. *However*, this weight will be subject to *exponential decay* over time.  The decay rate is a configurable parameter (α, 0 < α < 1).  If a symbol isn’t encountered for a certain period, its weight will diminish, potentially moving it lower in the tree or even pruning it entirely.

2.  **Pruning Threshold:** A configurable threshold (β) determines when a node (and its subtree) can be pruned.  If a node’s weight falls below β, the subtree is removed, and its symbols are re-allocated based on current frequency. This mechanism frees up space in the tree, but requires careful management to avoid information loss.

3.  **Re-Allocation Strategy:** When a subtree is pruned, its symbols need to be re-integrated into the tree.  Several strategies can be implemented:
    *   **Immediate Re-Insertion:** Symbols are immediately re-inserted into the tree based on their current frequency. This is simple but can cause instability.
    *   **Deferred Re-Insertion:** Symbols are added to a buffer and re-inserted periodically (e.g., every N symbols). This smooths out fluctuations but introduces latency.
    *   **Hybrid Approach:** A combination of immediate and deferred re-insertion based on symbol frequency.  High-frequency symbols are re-inserted immediately, while low-frequency symbols are deferred.

4.  **Tree Re-Balancing:**  After pruning and re-allocation, the tree may become unbalanced. A periodic re-balancing operation is required to maintain optimal performance. This involves swapping nodes to minimize the tree height and improve codeword length distribution.

5.  **Encoder/Decoder Synchronization:** A crucial aspect is ensuring that the encoder and decoder remain synchronized. This requires transmitting metadata alongside the compressed data, indicating which nodes have been pruned and how symbols have been re-allocated. This metadata should be minimized to avoid overhead.

**Pseudocode (Encoder):**

```
function encode(symbol):
  node = find_node(symbol)
  if node is null:
    // Symbol not in tree, add it
    add_new_node(symbol)
    node = find_node(symbol)
  
  transmit_codeword(node.codeword)
  
  update_node_weight(node)
  
  decay_all_weights(α) //Apply exponential decay
  
  prune_tree(β) //Remove nodes below threshold
  
  rebalance_tree()
  
  return
```

**Pseudocode (Decoder):**

```
function decode():
  codeword = receive_codeword()
  
  node = find_node_by_codeword(codeword)
  
  symbol = node.symbol
  
  update_node_weight(node)
  
  decay_all_weights(α)
  
  prune_tree(β)
  
  rebalance_tree()

  return symbol
```

**Metadata:**

*   Pruned Node List: IDs of pruned nodes.
*   Re-Allocation Map: Mapping of symbols to new node IDs after re-allocation.
*   Configuration Parameters: α, β, rebalancing frequency.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Adaptive Decay Rate: Dynamically adjust the decay rate α based on data volatility.
*   Context-Aware Pruning: Prune nodes based on the surrounding data context.
*   Parallel Tree Management: Implement parallel algorithms for pruning and rebalancing to improve performance.
