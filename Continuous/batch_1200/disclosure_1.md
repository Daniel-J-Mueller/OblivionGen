## Adaptive Environmental Mapping & Projection

**Concept:** Expand the device's spatial awareness beyond simple object location to incorporate dynamic environmental mapping and projected augmented reality overlays, triggered by detected device proximity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Spectral Sensor Array:** Integrate a sensor array beyond standard RGB cameras. Include:
    *   Depth Sensor (ToF or Structured Light): For accurate distance measurements.
    *   Infrared Sensor: For heat signature detection and low-light operation.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: To dynamically adjust projection brightness.
*   **Micro-Projector:** Low-power, high-resolution micro-projector capable of projecting onto various surfaces. Ideally, utilize a laser-scanning micro-projector to adapt to non-planar surfaces.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated onboard processor capable of real-time image processing, spatial mapping, and projection control. Minimum specifications: Octa-core processor, 16GB RAM, dedicated GPU.
*   **Wide-Angle Lens:** Enhance the field of view for more comprehensive environmental capture.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  For precise device orientation and movement tracking.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Environmental Mapping Module:**
    *   Utilize Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms to create a 3D model of the surrounding environment.
    *   Employ sensor fusion to integrate data from the camera, depth sensor, infrared sensor, and IMU for a more accurate and robust map.
    *   Dynamic Map Updating:  Continuously update the map based on device movement and sensor input.
*   **Device Detection & Tracking Module:** (Leveraging existing patent's device detection)
    *   Extend device detection to identify device *type* (e.g., smartphone, laptop, speaker).
    *   Track device movement and orientation in real-time.
    *   Predict device trajectory based on movement history.
*   **Contextual Projection Module:**
    *   Database of projection templates: Pre-designed AR overlays for different device types and contexts. Examples:
        *   Smartphone: Projection of a larger virtual keyboard onto a nearby surface.
        *   Laptop: Projection of a secondary virtual display onto a wall.
        *   Speaker: Projection of a visual equalizer or album art onto the surrounding environment.
    *   Dynamic Content Generation:  Algorithmically generate AR content based on device data and environmental context.
    *   Projection Mapping Engine: Software to accurately map the projected image onto the target surface, accounting for surface geometry and ambient lighting.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Control panel to select projection templates and customize AR content.
    *   Gesture control for adjusting projection parameters (brightness, size, position).

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
LOOP:
    Capture Image Data (Camera, Depth Sensor, Infrared Sensor)
    Update Environmental Map (SLAM Algorithm)
    Detect Devices in Image
    FOR EACH Device:
        Determine Device Type
        Determine Device Location & Orientation
        IF Device is within Projection Range:
            Retrieve Relevant Projection Template
            Generate AR Content (based on device data & context)
            Map AR Content onto Target Surface (Projection Mapping Engine)
            Project AR Content
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
ENDLOOP
```

**4.  Expansion & Differentiation:**

*   **Multi-Device Collaboration:** Enable multiple devices to share environmental maps and coordinate AR projections.
*   **Semantic Understanding:** Integrate AI-powered object recognition to understand the environment and generate contextually relevant AR content. (e.g., projecting instructions onto a device being assembled).
*   **Privacy Controls:** Implement mechanisms to prevent unwanted projections and protect user privacy.  (e.g., user-defined projection zones).
*   **Adaptive Brightness & Color:** Adjust projection brightness and color based on ambient lighting conditions and surface color.
