## Dynamic Review Weighting & "Evolving Persona" System

**Concept:** Expand the idea of comparative review prompting to create a dynamically weighted review system and a user “evolving persona” profile. The system doesn't just *ask* about similar items, it *learns* how a user’s preferences shift over time and uses that data to refine both product recommendations *and* how it solicits reviews.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Data Structures:**

*   `UserPersona`:
    *   `UserID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `ReviewHistory`: List of all reviews submitted, timestamped.
    *   `PreferenceVectors`: A series of weighted vectors representing user preferences for different product attributes (e.g., “comfort”, “durability”, “style”, “price”). These vectors are updated dynamically (see section 3).
    *   `VolatilityScore`: A metric representing how frequently a user changes their opinions on similar items. (High volatility = frequent changes, potentially indicating indecisiveness or evolving needs).
*   `ItemAttributeVector`:  Each item in the catalog is represented by a vector of attributes with associated weights.

**2. Review Solicitation Engine:**

*   **Similarity Detection:** As in the original patent, identify similar items based on attribute vectors.
*   **Volatility-Adjusted Prompting:** Before prompting a review for Item A, calculate the user’s `VolatilityScore` based on past reviews of similar items.
    *   **Low Volatility:** Present a standard review form.
    *   **High Volatility:**
        *   Display the user’s previous reviews of similar items *prominently*.
        *   Include a prompt: “Based on your past reviews, your preferences may be evolving.  Is there anything that has changed about your needs or priorities regarding this type of item?” (Free text field).
        *   Present a comparative slider interface: “How does this item compare to [Previous Item] in terms of [Key Attribute]?” (e.g., comfort, value).
*   **"Blind Spot" Detection:**  Identify attributes where a user *hasn’t* provided specific feedback in previous reviews of similar items.  Prioritize prompts for these attributes.  (e.g., “We noticed you haven’t commented on the battery life of similar products. Could you share your thoughts?”).

**3. Preference Vector Updates:**

*   **Review Parsing:**  Use NLP to extract attribute-specific sentiment from each review.
*   **Vector Adjustment:**  Adjust the `PreferenceVectors` based on the sentiment scores. 
    *   Positive Sentiment: Increase the weight of the corresponding attribute.
    *   Negative Sentiment: Decrease the weight of the corresponding attribute.
    *   **Decay Factor:** Implement a decay factor to give more weight to recent reviews.
*   **"Opinion Shift" Detection:** Monitor changes in `PreferenceVectors` over time. Significant shifts trigger an alert to the review solicitation engine, indicating that the user’s preferences may have evolved.

**4. Recommendation Engine Integration:**

*   Use the updated `PreferenceVectors` to refine product recommendations.
*   Prioritize items that align with the user’s current preferences.
*   Provide explanations for recommendations: "We recommend this item because it’s highly rated for [Attribute] which you’ve indicated is important."

**Pseudocode (Review Solicitation):**

```
FUNCTION SolicitReview(UserID, ItemA):
    similarItems = FindSimilarItems(ItemA)
    volatilityScore = CalculateVolatility(UserID, similarItems)

    IF volatilityScore > Threshold:
        displayPreviousReviews(UserID, similarItems)
        promptForEvolvingNeeds()
        displayComparativeSlider(UserID, similarItems)
    ELSE:
        displayStandardReviewForm()

    blindSpotAttributes = FindBlindSpotAttributes(UserID, similarItems)
    promptForBlindSpotAttributes(blindSpotAttributes)
```

**Potential Downstream Applications:**

*   **Personalized Advertising:**  Tailor ads based on evolving preferences.
*   **Predictive Analytics:**  Forecast future purchases based on preference shifts.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust prices based on user-specific demand.
