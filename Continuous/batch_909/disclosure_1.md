## Adaptive Computation Granularity with Dynamic Task Splitting

**Concept:** Extend the heterogeneous computation system to dynamically adjust the granularity of tasks distributed to worker nodes *during* execution, based on real-time performance metrics and resource availability. This isn't about pre-defining different computational specifications, but *splitting and re-combining* specifications on the fly.

**Specification:**

**1. Task Decomposition Engine (TDE):**  A component residing on the master node.

   *   **Input:** Initial computational specification, current worker node status (CPU, memory, network latency), execution time of previous task iterations (if applicable).
   *   **Process:**  Analyzes the computational specification and, based on worker node status, dynamically splits the task into smaller sub-tasks.  Splitting is guided by data dependencies within the computation â€“ it must maintain a valid execution order.  The TDE utilizes a cost model to estimate the execution time of each sub-task on each worker node.  This cost model incorporates CPU/GPU characteristics, memory bandwidth, and network latency.
   *   **Output:**  A directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the sub-tasks and their dependencies.  Each node in the DAG is annotated with the target worker node ID.

**2. Dynamic Task Scheduler (DTS):**  A modified scheduler running on the master node.

   *   **Input:** DAG from TDE, worker node status updates, real-time execution metrics (latency, throughput).
   *   **Process:**  Assigns sub-tasks to worker nodes according to the DAG and worker node availability.  *Crucially*, the DTS continuously monitors execution metrics.  If a worker node is overloaded or experiences high latency, the DTS can *re-decompose* sub-tasks and re-assign them to other available workers.  This re-decomposition is performed by invoking the TDE with the partially completed task and updated worker status. The scheduler also implements a prioritization system, giving preference to sub-tasks critical for the final result.
   *   **Output:**  A continuously updated task schedule.

**3. Task Result Aggregation Enhancement:**

   *   Modify the aggregator node to handle *partial* results.  Instead of waiting for all sub-tasks to complete, the aggregator combines partial results as they become available. This requires the computational specifications to define how partial results can be meaningfully combined.

**Pseudocode (DTS core logic):**

```pseudocode
function scheduleTasks(DAG, workerStatus):
  taskQueue = initializeTaskQueue(DAG)
  while taskQueue is not empty:
    task = getNextReadyTask(taskQueue) // Task with all dependencies met
    bestWorker = findBestWorker(task, workerStatus)
    sendTaskToWorker(task, bestWorker)
    updateWorkerStatus(bestWorker)
    receiveResult(bestWorker)

    if workerStatus[bestWorker].load > threshold or latency > threshold:
        reDecomposeTask(task)
        reScheduleTasks(DAG, workerStatus)
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on distributing *predefined* specifications. This design dynamically modifies the granularity of computation during execution, adapting to changing system conditions and maximizing resource utilization.  The re-decomposition logic, triggered by real-time performance monitoring, is a key differentiator. The ability to handle partial results further enhances responsiveness.
