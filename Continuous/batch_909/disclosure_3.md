## Dynamic Dictionary Sharding & Federated Learning Integration

**Concept:** Extend the augmented dictionary concept beyond single-node application and integrate it with federated learning to build and maintain highly specialized, decentralized feature sets.

**Specification:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Global Dictionary Manager (GDM):** A central component responsible for initial dictionary creation & version control. It doesn’t *store* data, only metadata.
*   **Local Dictionary Shards (LDS):** Each data node (columnar database instance) maintains a *shard* of the global dictionary.  Shards are assigned based on data locality & anticipated feature usage (see 'Shard Assignment Algorithm').
*   **Federated Learning Coordinator (FLC):** Orchestrates the federated learning process for dictionary updates.
*   **AI Service Interface:**  Standard interface for requesting featurized data.

**2. Shard Assignment Algorithm:**

*   **Initial Assignment:** GDM assigns initial shards to nodes based on data distribution. Key columns (e.g., those frequently used in AI models) are assigned to nodes where the majority of that data resides.
*   **Dynamic Re-Sharding:**
    *   Monitor feature request patterns (from AI Service Interface).
    *   Identify ‘hot’ features (frequently requested).
    *   If a ‘hot’ feature’s data is distributed across many nodes, re-shard the dictionary – move the relevant entries to a single node or a smaller cluster.
    *   Re-sharding triggered by a threshold (e.g., >50% of requests require cross-node data access for a specific feature).

**3. Federated Learning Workflow:**

*   **Local Training:** Each node trains a local model (e.g., a simple neural network) to predict optimal augmented dictionary values for its shard, based on its local data & current feature configurations.  Model input is the raw data, and output is the predicted augmented value.
*   **Model Aggregation:** FLC collects the local models from each node. It aggregates these models using federated averaging or a more sophisticated algorithm (e.g., FedProx).
*   **Dictionary Update:** The aggregated model is used to update the augmented dictionary values on each node. Each node applies the aggregated model to its shard, generating new augmented values.
*   **Version Control:** The GDM tracks dictionary versions and ensures consistency across the system.  Rollback mechanisms are implemented for failed updates.

**4. Data Flow:**

1.  AI Service requests featurized data.
2.  Request routed to the appropriate node(s) based on the data location & dictionary shard assignments.
3.  Node applies the augmented dictionary values to the data.
4.  Featurized data returned to the AI Service.
5.  (Background) Federated learning process continuously updates the augmented dictionary values.

**5. Pseudocode (FLC - Simplified):**

```python
def federated_learning_round(feature_configuration):
    local_models = []
    for node in nodes:
        local_model = node.train_local_model(feature_configuration)
        local_models.append(local_model)

    aggregated_model = aggregate_models(local_models)

    for node in nodes:
        node.update_dictionary(aggregated_model)

    update_global_metadata(aggregated_model)
```

**6. Data Structures:**

*   **Dictionary Shard:** `Key: Value, Metadata (e.g., last updated timestamp, node ID)`
*   **Feature Configuration:** `Feature Name: Transformation Parameters`
*   **Global Metadata:** `Feature Name: Shard Location, Dictionary Version`

**7. Considerations:**

*   **Communication Overhead:** Minimize data transfer during federated learning. Use model compression techniques.
*   **Data Privacy:** Implement differential privacy or other privacy-preserving mechanisms.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Design the system to handle node failures.
*   **Scalability:** Ensure the system can scale to handle large datasets and a large number of nodes.
