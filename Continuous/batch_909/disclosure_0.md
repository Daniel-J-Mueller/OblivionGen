**Dynamic CDN Prioritization via User Device Resource Negotiation**

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This system expands on dynamic CDN balancing by incorporating real-time negotiation of resource availability *directly with the user’s device* before selecting a CDN for media fragment delivery. The goal is to move beyond simply balancing load *across* CDNs to actively matching CDN capabilities with *individual user device limitations*, optimizing playback quality within those constraints.

**II. Components:**

*   **Resource Probe Module (RPM):**  A lightweight client-side module integrated into the media player.  The RPM periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds, or triggered by network conditions) probes the device for:
    *   CPU utilization
    *   Available memory
    *   Network bandwidth (up/down)
    *   Battery level (mobile devices)
    *   Screen resolution/density
    *   Decoding capabilities (codec support, hardware acceleration status)
*   **Negotiation Server (NS):** A server-side component responsible for receiving resource information from the RPM, analyzing it, and generating a prioritized CDN list tailored to that specific device.
*   **CDN Profile Database:** A database containing detailed profiles for each CDN, including:
    *   Geographic location
    *   Bandwidth capacity
    *   Codec support
    *   Caching efficiency
    *   Historical performance data (latency, error rates)
    *   *Cost per bit delivered* (critical for optimization)
*   **Manifest Modifier:**  A component that intercepts the manifest data (e.g., HLS, DASH) and reorders the available fragments according to the prioritized CDN list.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **Device Probe:**  The RPM initiates a resource probe and transmits the collected data to the NS.
2.  **Resource Analysis:** The NS analyzes the device resource profile.  This analysis determines the device's *playback capacity* – a metric representing the maximum bitrate/resolution it can reliably handle.  The analysis also identifies any specific limitations (e.g., limited CPU, slow network).
3.  **CDN Scoring:** The NS scores each CDN based on:
    *   **Proximity:** Distance to the user (lower latency).
    *   **Capacity:** Current load and available bandwidth.
    *   **Codec Compatibility:**  Support for codecs required by the media content.
    *   **Cost:**  Cost per bit delivered.
    *   **Device Compatibility Score:** A new metric calculated based on matching CDN characteristics to the user’s device capabilities.  For example, if the device has limited CPU, CDNs offering lower-complexity codecs (e.g., VP9 Profile 0) will receive a higher score.
4.  **Prioritized CDN List Generation:** The NS generates a prioritized list of CDNs based on the calculated scores. This list is dynamically updated as network conditions or CDN load changes.
5.  **Manifest Modification:** The Manifest Modifier intercepts the manifest data and reorders the fragment URLs to prioritize delivery from the CDNs at the top of the list.
6.  **Fragment Request:** The media player requests fragments from the CDNs in the prioritized order.
7.  **Feedback Loop:** The media player reports playback statistics (buffering events, errors) back to the NS. This data is used to refine the CDN scoring algorithm and improve future prioritization.

**IV. Pseudocode (NS – CDN Scoring):**

```
function calculate_cdn_score(cdn, device_profile):
  proximity_score = calculate_proximity_score(cdn, device_location)
  capacity_score = calculate_capacity_score(cdn)
  compatibility_score = calculate_compatibility_score(cdn, device_profile)
  cost_score = calculate_cost_score(cdn)

  #Weighting factors (adjustable)
  proximity_weight = 0.3
  compatibility_weight = 0.4
  cost_weight = 0.1
  capacity_weight = 0.2

  total_score = (proximity_score * proximity_weight) + (compatibility_score * compatibility_weight) + (cost_score * cost_weight) + (capacity_score * capacity_weight)

  return total_score

function calculate_compatibility_score(cdn, device_profile):
  codec_support = check_codec_support(cdn, device_profile)  //Returns a score based on supported codecs
  cpu_score = calculate_cpu_score(cdn, device_profile) //Based on CPU usage of codecs offered
  memory_score = calculate_memory_score(cdn, device_profile)

  compatibility_score = (codec_support * 0.5) + (cpu_score * 0.3) + (memory_score * 0.2)
  return compatibility_score
```

**V.  Innovation:**

This system transcends simple CDN load balancing by actively factoring in *individual device limitations* into the CDN selection process. This minimizes buffering, improves playback quality, and reduces bandwidth consumption. By prioritizing CDNs offering codecs tailored to a device's CPU and memory, the system ensures a smoother and more efficient media experience.  The real-time device negotiation and feedback loop enable continuous optimization and adaptation to changing conditions.
