## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Distributed Phased Array

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual microphone testing to create a real-time, spatially-resolved acoustic map of an environment using a dense network of calibrated microphones. This moves from *testing* microphones to *utilizing* them as nodes in a distributed acoustic imaging system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Node Hardware:**
    *   Microphone: High-sensitivity, low-noise MEMS microphone (similar to those tested in the provided patent).
    *   ADC: 24-bit ADC with at least 96 kHz sampling rate.
    *   Processing Unit: ARM Cortex-M7 processor with dedicated DSP instructions.
    *   Communication: Wireless communication module (Wi-Fi 6/Bluetooth 5.2) for data transmission and synchronization.
    *   Power: Battery powered with wireless charging capability.
    *   Enclosure: Compact, weatherproof enclosure.
*   **Network Topology:**
    *   Scalable: Designed to support hundreds or thousands of nodes.
    *   Mesh Network: Nodes communicate directly with each other, forming a robust and self-healing network.
    *   Synchronization: Nodes synchronize using a time-over-air protocol (e.g., IEEE 1588) to ensure accurate timing information.  Precision target: +/- 10 nanoseconds.
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    1.  **Calibration:**  Each node is calibrated *in situ* using a known sound source to determine its acoustic transfer function.  Leverage the test tone generation methods from the reference patent for this initial calibration, automating the process through network communication.
    2.  **Beamforming:** Each node performs basic beamforming to steer its sensitivity in multiple directions.
    3.  **Data Fusion:**  A central server receives raw beamformed data from all nodes.
    4.  **Acoustic Scene Reconstruction:** The server performs advanced signal processing techniques (e.g., Delay-and-Sum beamforming, MUSIC algorithm, sparse array reconstruction) to reconstruct a 3D acoustic map of the environment. This map represents the amplitude and direction of sound sources within the monitored area.
*   **Software:**
    *   Node Firmware: Real-time operating system (RTOS) for efficient data acquisition and processing.
    *   Server Software: Cloud-based platform for data storage, processing, and visualization.
    *   API: Open API for integration with other applications and services.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Reconstruction):**

```
// Input: Raw beamformed data from all nodes
// Output: 3D acoustic map

function reconstructAcousticMap(raw_data):
  // 1. Calibration Data Load
  load calibration_data for each node

  // 2. Data Alignment & Synchronization
  align data streams based on synchronization timestamps

  // 3. Geometric Modeling of Node Network
  create 3D model of node positions

  // 4. Iterative Reconstruction Algorithm:
  for each grid point in 3D space:
    sum_signal = 0
    for each node:
      distance = calculate distance from node to grid point
      phase_delay = (distance / speed_of_sound) * 2 * PI
      signal_contribution = node.signal * exp(-j * phase_delay) // j is the imaginary unit
      sum_signal += signal_contribution

    acoustic_amplitude = abs(sum_signal)
    acoustic_map[grid_point] = acoustic_amplitude

  // 5. Noise Reduction & Filtering (e.g., spectral subtraction)
  apply noise reduction algorithms to acoustic_map

  // 6. Visualization & Output
  return acoustic_map
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Environmental monitoring (noise mapping, wildlife tracking).
*   Security and surveillance (intrusion detection, gunshot localization).
*   Industrial applications (machine health monitoring, leak detection).
*   Virtual/augmented reality (immersive audio experiences).
