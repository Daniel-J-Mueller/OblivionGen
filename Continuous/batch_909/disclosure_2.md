## Dynamic Proximity-Based Communication Prioritization

**Concept:** Enhance message prioritization by incorporating real-time proximity data between the user and senders/recipients, going beyond simple account association. This adds a layer of 'immediacy' to message handling.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Device with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) capability (smartphone, smartwatch, dedicated beacon).
*   Compatible BLE/UWB beacons deployed in key locations (home, office, common areas).
*   Existing speech-processing system as outlined in the base patent.

**2. Data Collection & Processing:**

*   **Proximity Sensing:** Device continuously scans for BLE/UWB beacons. Signal strength/time-of-flight data determines proximity to known locations and potential other users (with permission).
*   **Proximity Profile Creation:** A user profile stores known locations (home, work) and associated individuals (family, colleagues). The system learns frequent co-location patterns.
*   **Dynamic Priority Scoring:**  Message priority is calculated using a weighted score:
    *   User Account Weight (base patent priority)
    *   Group Account Weight (base patent priority)
    *   Sender Priority (base patent priority)
    *   Proximity Weight:
        *   High (sender within the same room/close proximity): +3
        *   Medium (sender within building/general area): +1
        *   Low (sender remote): 0
    *   Immediacy Bonus: If a sender's proximity *changes* rapidly (approaching user), apply a temporary +2 bonus.
*   **Time Decay:**  Proximity weight decays over time if no new proximity updates are received.

**3. System Integration & Workflow:**

1.  Device receives a request for message playback.
2.  System identifies user and group accounts.
3.  System performs proximity scan.
4.  System retrieves proximity profiles and current proximity data.
5.  System calculates dynamic priority score for each message.
6.  Messages are sorted based on priority score.
7.  Acoustic features are generated and messages are played back in prioritized order.

**4. Pseudocode (Priority Calculation):**

```
function calculate_message_priority(message) {
    priority = 0;

    // Base patent priorities
    if (message.is_user_account) { priority += 5; }
    if (message.is_group_account) { priority += 2; }
    priority += message.sender_priority;

    // Proximity-based scoring
    proximity = get_sender_proximity(message.sender_id);

    if (proximity == "high") { priority += 3; }
    else if (proximity == "medium") { priority += 1; }

    // Immediacy Bonus
    if (sender_proximity_changed_rapidly(message.sender_id)) {
        priority += 2;
    }

    return priority;
}
```

**5. Further Considerations:**

*   Privacy:  Location data must be handled securely and with user consent.  Anonymization techniques should be employed where possible.
*   Battery Life:  Continuous proximity scanning can be power-intensive.  Optimize scanning frequency and use BLE/UWB efficiently.
*   Contextual Awareness: Combine proximity data with other contextual information (calendar events, meeting schedules) to refine priority scoring.
*   User Customization: Allow users to customize proximity-based priority settings (e.g., prioritize messages from family members regardless of location).
