## Adaptive Contextual Action Profiles

**Concept:** Extend intent re-ranking by creating and dynamically adjusting “action profiles” associated with users *and* environments. These profiles go beyond simple slot matching, factoring in long-term user behavior, predicted needs, and environmental factors to proactively suggest or even initiate actions.

**Specs:**

1.  **Contextual Data Aggregation:**
    *   **User History:** Track user interactions (utterances, confirmations, cancellations, edits) over extended periods. Store this data as a probabilistic model representing preferred actions for given intents.
    *   **Environmental Sensors:** Integrate data from device-embedded sensors (cameras, microphones, proximity sensors, accelerometers) and external sources (smart home systems, calendar entries, location data).
    *   **Temporal Analysis:**  Analyze data based on time of day, day of week, seasonality, and recurring patterns.

2.  **Action Profile Creation & Management:**
    *   **Profile Types:**
        *   *User Profile:* Individual preferences and behaviors.
        *   *Location Profile:*  Common actions/preferences for specific locations (home, work, gym).
        *   *Situational Profile:*  Actions triggered by specific situations (e.g., "commute," "cooking," "meeting").
    *   **Profile Weighting:**  Assign weights to different data sources (user history, location, situation) to determine their influence on action selection.  Weights can be learned through reinforcement learning.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update profiles based on user feedback (explicit confirmations/cancellations, implicit behavior like edits or long delays).

3.  **Enhanced Intent Re-ranking:**
    *   **Action Hypothesis Generation:**  Based on the initial intent hypotheses *and* the active action profiles, generate a set of “action hypotheses” – potential actions the user might want to take.
    *   **Profile-Based Scoring:** Score each action hypothesis based on its alignment with the active action profiles. This score is combined with the original intent score to create a composite score.
    *   **Proactive Action Suggestion:** If the composite score for an action hypothesis exceeds a certain threshold, proactively suggest the action to the user (e.g., "Looks like you're heading to work. Would you like me to start playing your commute playlist?").
    *   **Automated Action Initiation:** For highly confident action hypotheses (e.g., turning on lights when entering a room at night), automatically initiate the action without explicit confirmation. Include a clear opt-out mechanism.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function reRankIntents(utterance, intentHypotheses, contextData):
  activeProfiles = getActiveProfiles(contextData)

  for intent in intentHypotheses:
    actionHypotheses = generateActionHypotheses(intent, activeProfiles)
    for action in actionHypotheses:
      profileScore = calculateProfileScore(action, activeProfiles)
      compositeScore = intent.score + profileScore * weightingFactor
      action.score = compositeScore

  # Sort action hypotheses by composite score
  sortedActions = sort(actionHypotheses)

  return sortedActions
```

**Example:**

User: "Play some music"

*Initial Intent Hypotheses:*  PlayMusic (0.8), OpenSpotify (0.6)

*Context Data:*  Time: 8:00 AM, Location: Home, User History: Regularly listens to upbeat music during morning routine.

*Active Profiles:*  Home Profile (high weight), Morning Routine Profile (high weight).

*Generated Action Hypotheses:* PlayUpbeatMusic, PlayNewsPodcast.

*Profile-Based Scoring:* PlayUpbeatMusic receives a high score due to alignment with Home and Morning Routine Profiles. PlayNewsPodcast receives a low score.

*Re-ranked Intents:* PlayUpbeatMusic (0.9), PlayMusic (0.8), OpenSpotify (0.6).

*Proactive Suggestion:* "Good morning! Would you like me to play your morning playlist?"
