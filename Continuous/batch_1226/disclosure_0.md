## Adaptive Entropy Source Calibration via Dynamic Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Leverage the BIST infrastructure to *continuously* calibrate entropy sources within the RNG, dynamically allocating computational resources to problematic sources to maintain a consistent entropy rate. This moves beyond static fault testing to proactive entropy quality management.

**Specs:**

*   **Entropy Source Array:** RNG core comprises ‘N’ independent entropy sources (ES). These could be ring oscillators, chaotic circuits, or physical noise sources.
*   **Entropy Rate Monitor (ERM):** Dedicated hardware module. Continuously monitors the output of each ES using statistical tests (Dieharder, NIST suite). Outputs a ‘Quality Metric’ (QM) for each ES – a value between 0-1, representing estimated entropy rate.
*   **Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) Controller:** Finite State Machine (FSM) driven logic. Receives QM data from ERM.
*   **BIST Integration:** The existing BIST controller is repurposed as a ‘Calibration Engine’. It does not *just* test for faults; it actively *corrects* for performance degradation.
*   **Calibration Algorithm:**
    1.  **QM Thresholds:** Define pre-set QM thresholds (High, Medium, Low).
    2.  **Resource Assignment:** Based on QM:
        *   **High QM:** Minimal BIST cycles – basic health check.
        *   **Medium QM:** Increased BIST cycles – more in-depth testing, potential minor recalibration (e.g., adjusting bias currents in analog circuits).
        *   **Low QM:** Maximum BIST cycles – extensive testing, significant recalibration (e.g., switching to a redundant entropy source, or applying adaptive filtering).  If recalibration fails, the ES is temporarily disabled and resources shifted to healthy sources.
    3.  **Adaptive Filtering:**  Implement real-time filtering algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter) to reduce bias and correlation in entropy source output, based on BIST data.
*   **Hardware Implementation:**
    *   **Calibration Engine:** Modified BIST controller.
    *   **ERM:** FPGA-based statistical analyzer.
    *   **Data Bus:** High-speed data bus connecting ERM, DRA Controller, and Entropy Source Array.
*   **Pseudocode (DRA Controller):**

```
// Initialization
set QM_Threshold_High = 0.8
set QM_Threshold_Low = 0.4

loop:
    for each Entropy Source (ES) in Entropy Source Array:
        QM = ERM.get_Quality_Metric(ES)

        if QM > QM_Threshold_High:
            run_Basic_BIST_Check(ES)
        else if QM < QM_Threshold_Low:
            run_Extensive_BIST_Check(ES)
            if BIST_fails(ES):
                disable_Entropy_Source(ES)
                allocate_resources_to_healthy_sources()
            else:
                apply_adaptive_filtering(ES)
        else:
            // Medium QM – continue monitoring
            continue
    end loop
```

**Innovation:**  Traditional BIST is a ‘go/no-go’ test performed at manufacturing or on-demand. This system turns it into a continuous, adaptive entropy management system. It proactively addresses entropy source degradation *before* it impacts RNG output quality, enhancing security and reliability.  It transitions from fault detection to performance optimization within the RNG itself.
