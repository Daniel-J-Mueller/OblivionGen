## Acoustic Scene Completion with Generative Temporal Attention

**Concept:** Expand beyond acoustic *event* detection to acoustic *scene* completion. Leverage the self-supervised learning framework to not only detect *what* sounds are present, but to *predict* the likely acoustic future of a scene, creating a synthesized, extended audio experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** A Temporal Attention Generative Network (TAGN). This network builds upon the existing encoder-decoder structure but adds a generative component focused on temporal coherence.

*   **Input:** Raw audio data (e.g., PCM) or pre-processed log filterbank energies (LFBE).

*   **Encoder:** A convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), similar to the patent's described encoder.  Key addition:  A ‘context vector’ output at each time step, representing the encoded scene state.

*   **Decoder:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention mechanism. This decoder receives the context vector *and* a ‘latent scene representation’ (described below) and attempts to reconstruct (and *extend*) the audio signal.

*   **Latent Scene Representation:** A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained to compress and decompress the context vectors generated by the encoder. This VAE learns a probabilistic distribution over potential scene states, allowing for the generation of diverse scene extensions.

*   **Generative Process:** The decoder, guided by the latent scene representation, generates predicted audio frames. A key element is a ‘temporal attention’ mechanism that focuses on the most relevant past frames when generating future frames. This ensures temporal coherence and realistic sound propagation.

*   **Self-Supervised Training:**
    1.  **Input Augmentation:** Create augmented audio segments from existing recordings (time-stretching, pitch-shifting, noise addition).
    2.  **Encoder-Decoder Training:** Train the encoder and decoder to reconstruct the original audio segment from the augmented segment, using the VAE as a bottleneck.  The loss function includes reconstruction error *and* a KL divergence term to encourage the VAE to learn a meaningful latent space.
    3.  **Predictive Loss:**  Add a predictive loss term that penalizes the difference between the predicted audio frames and the actual subsequent audio frames. This encourages the network to learn to predict the future of the acoustic scene.

*   **Federated Learning Adaptation:**  The encoder weights are updated via federated learning as described in the patent. The decoder and VAE remain centrally trained for stability.  Edge devices contribute to the encoder's understanding of diverse acoustic environments.

*   **Output:**  Extended audio stream representing the completed acoustic scene. The system dynamically extends the input audio, generating a more immersive and engaging experience.

**Pseudocode (Core Generative Loop):**

```python
# For each time step t:
encoder_output = encoder(audio_frame_t)  # Get context vector
latent_vector = VAE_encoder(encoder_output) # Compress to latent space
decoder_input = (encoder_output, latent_vector)
predicted_frame = decoder(decoder_input)
# Apply temporal attention to predicted_frame (details omitted for brevity)
output_audio_frame = predicted_frame # or a combination of predicted and actual
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Audio Experiences:** Create extended, dynamic soundscapes for virtual reality and augmented reality applications.
*   **Environmental Sound Augmentation:**  Enhance the realism of recordings by adding predicted sounds based on the current acoustic context.
*   **Audio Restoration:**  Fill in missing segments of damaged audio recordings.
*   **Acoustic Event Anticipation:** Predict potential acoustic events based on the current scene context.
