## Adaptive Proxy with Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Expand the proxy functionality to not just enforce *what* resources are accessible, but *how* they are accessed, based on learned user behavior. This adds a layer of proactive security and user experience enhancement.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Creation:**

*   **Data Collection:** Proxy logs network traffic details: URLs accessed, data transfer sizes, access frequency, time of day, user agent, geographic location (derived from IP), and potentially, preliminary content type analysis (e.g., image, document, executable).
*   **Profile Storage:** Data is stored in a time-series database optimized for quick retrieval and analysis (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB). Profiles are keyed by user/account and potentially by device.
*   **Baseline Establishment:**  Initial ‘normal’ behavior is established over a training period (e.g., 2 weeks). Statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) are calculated for each data point.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  A real-time anomaly detection engine monitors incoming traffic.  Deviations from the established baseline trigger a risk score calculation.  Factors contributing to risk:
    *   **Access Frequency:**  Sudden increase or decrease in requests to a specific resource.
    *   **Data Volume:**  Unusual data transfer sizes (downloads/uploads).
    *   **Time of Access:**  Accessing resources outside of normal working hours.
    *   **Geographic Location:** Access from an unexpected location.
    *   **Content Type:** Attempts to download executable files when this is unusual for the user.

**2. Adaptive Proxy Rules:**

*   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score (0-100) based on anomaly detection and the weight of various contributing factors.
*   **Dynamic Rule Generation:** Based on the risk score, dynamically apply proxy rules *beyond* the static access control lists. Examples:
    *   **Low Risk (0-30):** No changes to normal access.
    *   **Medium Risk (31-70):**
        *   **Step-Up Authentication:** Prompt for multi-factor authentication (MFA) before granting access.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Temporarily limit the request rate to the resource.
        *   **Content Inspection:** Perform deeper content inspection for malicious code.
    *   **High Risk (71-100):**
        *   **Block Access:**  Completely block access to the resource.
        *   **Alert Administrator:**  Notify security administrators of potential security breach.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Proxy Component:** Existing proxy functionality (from the patent) handles initial authentication and static access control.
*   **Behavioral Analysis Engine:** A separate microservice responsible for data collection, baseline establishment, anomaly detection, and risk scoring. Written in Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas) or R.
*   **Rule Engine:** A component that receives the risk score and dynamically generates proxy rules.  Can be implemented as a rule-based system or a machine learning model.
*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for behavioral data.
*   **API Communication:** REST APIs for communication between components.

**4. Pseudocode (Rule Engine):**

```
function apply_proxy_rules(risk_score, request):
  if risk_score <= 30:
    return "Allow"
  else if risk_score <= 70:
    if request.requires_mfa():
      prompt_for_mfa(request)
    apply_rate_limiting(request)
    inspect_content(request)
    return "Allow"
  else:
    block_request(request)
    send_alert(request)
    return "Deny"
```

**5. Future Considerations:**

*   **Federated Learning:** Train behavioral models across multiple organizations without sharing raw data.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:**  Dynamically adjust the weights of anomaly detection factors based on feedback from security incidents.
*   **User Feedback Loop:**  Allow users to flag false positives or false negatives, improving the accuracy of the behavioral models.
