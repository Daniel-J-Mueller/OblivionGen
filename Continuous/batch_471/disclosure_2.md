## Adaptive Artifact Delta Streaming

**Concept:** Extend the proxy repository concept to facilitate *streaming* of only the *differences* between artifact versions, adapting the stream to network conditions and client capabilities. This moves beyond simple version comparison & deployment, and introduces real-time, granular update capabilities.

**Specs:**

**1. Delta Artifact Generation Service:**

*   **Input:** Complete software artifact (e.g., compiled binary, configuration file).
*   **Process:**
    *   Performs a binary or semantic diff against the *previous* version of the artifact stored in a master repository.
    *   Generates a "delta package" containing *only* the changes. Delta package format is optimized for size and efficient application.  (Consider formats like xdelta3 or a custom format designed for specific artifact types).
    *   Stores the delta package, along with metadata (artifact ID, version, dependencies) in the master repository.
*   **Output:** Delta package and metadata.

**2. Proxy Repository Enhancement:**

*   Stores delta packages *in addition* to (or instead of, configurable) complete artifacts.
*   Maintains a mapping between artifact ID/version and available delta packages.
*   Implements a "delta stream" endpoint.

**3. Client-Side Update Agent:**

*   **Initialization:** Queries the proxy for the latest artifact version.
*   **Delta Stream Request:** Requests a delta stream for the target artifact.
*   **Adaptive Streaming:**
    *   Receives delta packages in chunks.
    *   Dynamically adjusts the chunk size based on network bandwidth, latency, and client CPU load.
    *   Implements a forward error correction (FEC) scheme to handle packet loss.
*   **Delta Application:**
    *   Applies the received delta packages to the *existing* artifact on the target machine.
    *   Performs integrity checks to ensure correct application.
*   **Full Artifact Fallback:** If delta application fails or a full artifact is requested, downloads the complete artifact from the proxy.

**4. Deployment Service Integration:**

*   The deployment service receives a request to update an application.
*   The service queries the proxy for available delta streams.
*   The service instructs the client-side update agent to initiate a delta stream.
*   The deployment service monitors the update process and provides status updates.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Update Agent - Delta Stream Handling):**

```
function handleDeltaStream(artifactID, version):
  latestVersion = getLatestVersionFromProxy(artifactID)
  if latestVersion > currentVersion:
    streamURL = getDeltaStreamURL(artifactID, currentVersion, latestVersion)
    startStreaming(streamURL)

function startStreaming(streamURL):
  while stream is active:
    chunk = receiveChunk(stream)
    if chunk is valid:
      applyChunk(chunk)
      acknowledgeChunk(stream)
      adjustChunkSize(networkConditions, cpuLoad)
    else:
      requestResend()
      if retries exceed limit:
        downloadFullArtifact()
        break
```

**Innovations:**

*   **Granular Updates:** Only the changes are transmitted, reducing bandwidth consumption and update times.
*   **Adaptive Streaming:**  Optimizes update performance based on network conditions and client capabilities.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** FEC and full artifact fallback provide resilience to network issues.
*   **Potential for "Live" Updates:**  Could enable near real-time updates with very small delta packages.  Imagine patching a security vulnerability in milliseconds.
