## Dynamic Skill Chaining & Anticipatory Processing

**Concept:** Expand the device-specific skill processing by implementing a system that *chains* skills together based on probabilistic user intent and *anticipates* necessary skill activations before a complete utterance is received. This goes beyond prioritization; it's about creating a fluid, predictive interaction model.

**Specs:**

**1. Skill Graph Database:**

*   **Data Structure:** A directed graph where nodes represent skills (device-specific and general) and edges represent probabilistic transition probabilities between skills. Transition probabilities are learned from user interaction data.
*   **Attributes:** Each skill node includes:
    *   Skill ID
    *   Skill Type (Device-Specific, General)
    *   Activation Cost (processing time/resource usage)
    *   Confidence Threshold (minimum confidence score for activation)
    *   Input Parameters (data types/formats expected)
    *   Output Parameters (data types/formats produced)
*   **Learning Mechanism:** The graph is updated via reinforcement learning, rewarding successful skill chains and penalizing failures.

**2. Predictive NLU Module:**

*   **Incremental Processing:** NLU processes input *as it's received* (e.g., speech or text), not after the complete utterance.
*   **Partial Intent Recognition:** Identifies *possible* intents based on partial input, assigning probabilities to each.
*   **Skill Activation Prediction:** Based on the predicted intents and the Skill Graph, identifies the most likely next skill to activate.
*   **Pre-emptive Resource Allocation:** Allocates resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to the predicted skill *before* the complete utterance is received, minimizing latency.

**3. Dynamic Skill Chaining Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function process_user_input(user_input, current_skill_context):
  // 1. Initial NLU and Skill Prediction
  partial_intent, confidence = incremental_nlu(user_input)
  predicted_next_skill = predict_next_skill(partial_intent, current_skill_context)

  // 2. Pre-emptive Resource Allocation
  allocate_resources(predicted_next_skill)

  // 3. Continue processing user input
  if user input is complete:
    // Final NLU & Skill Confirmation
    final_intent, final_confidence = final_nlu(user_input)
    confirmed_skill = confirm_skill(final_intent, final_confidence)

    // Skill Execution & Context Update
    execute_skill(confirmed_skill, user_input)
    current_skill_context = update_context(confirmed_skill, user_input)
  else:
    // Continue incremental processing
    process_user_input(user_input + next_input_chunk, current_skill_context)
```

**4. Contextual Awareness & Skill Adaptation:**

*   **User Profile Integration:** Incorporate user preferences, history, and device usage patterns into the Skill Graph.
*   **Environmental Sensor Data:** Utilize sensor data (location, time, ambient noise, etc.) to refine skill predictions.
*   **Skill Parameter Adaptation:** Dynamically adjust skill parameters based on context and user behavior.  For example, a music skill might adjust volume based on ambient noise levels.

**5. Failure Handling & Rollback Mechanism:**

*   **Confidence Threshold Monitoring:** Continuously monitor confidence levels throughout the skill chain.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If confidence drops below a certain threshold, automatically rollback to a previous state and re-evaluate the skill chain.
*   **Error Reporting & Learning:** Log errors and use them to refine the Skill Graph and improve future predictions.
