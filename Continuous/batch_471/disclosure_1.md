## Doorbell as a Dynamic Projection Surface

**Concept:** Transform the doorbell into a dynamic projection surface, utilizing the doorbell’s housing as a canvas for contextual information and customizable aesthetics.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing Material:** Translucent, durable polymer – frosted acrylic or similar. The housing *must* be weatherproof and capable of diffusing projected light evenly. The material should have a high light transmission rate while minimizing glare.
*   **Projector Unit:** Miniature, low-power laser or LED projector integrated *within* the doorbell housing, angled to project onto the surface of the housing itself. Resolution: minimum 720p, ideally 1080p. Lumens: Adjustable, 10-100 lumens. Automatic brightness adjustment based on ambient light.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Motion Sensor: PIR sensor with adjustable sensitivity and range.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: Measures external light levels for projection brightness control.
    *   Camera: Low-resolution camera (VGA or 720p) for basic visitor detection and optional facial recognition.
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n) for communication with a central hub/app. Bluetooth for initial setup/pairing.
*   **Power:** Battery powered (rechargeable) or wired to existing doorbell wiring. Battery life: Minimum 3 months on a single charge.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   App control for customization of projected visuals.
    *   Pre-loaded animations/visuals: Greetings, welcome messages, decorative patterns.
    *   API access for third-party integration (weather data, news feeds, social media).
    *   Automatic update functionality for firmware and visual content.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Default State:** When idle, the doorbell displays a subtle, customizable animation or pattern on its surface.
2.  **Motion Detection:** Upon motion detection, the display changes to indicate activity. Options:
    *   "Welcome" message
    *   Animated icon indicating someone is at the door
    *   Live camera feed preview (if equipped)
3.  **Ring Activation:** When the doorbell button is pressed, the display highlights the button area and initiates a notification on a connected device. A unique animated ring pattern plays.
4.  **Visitor Identification (Optional):** If facial recognition is enabled, the doorbell displays the visitor’s name or a custom nickname on the housing surface.
5.  **Contextual Information:** The display can show relevant information, such as weather forecasts, time, or calendar events. This data is pulled from the internet via Wi-Fi.

**Pseudocode (Display Logic):**

```
// State: IDLE, MOTION_DETECTED, RINGING, VISITOR_IDENTIFIED

loop:
    if (state == IDLE) {
        displayAnimation(defaultAnimation);
    } else if (state == MOTION_DETECTED) {
        displayAnimation(motionAnimation);
    } else if (state == RINGING) {
        displayAnimation(ringAnimation);
        sendNotification();
    } else if (state == VISITOR_IDENTIFIED) {
        displayVisitorName(visitorName);
    }
```

**Refinements:**

*   Haptic feedback on the doorbell button to confirm activation.
*   Integration with smart home systems (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant).
*   Modular design for easy customization and upgrades.
*   Advanced image projection techniques to create a 3D effect.
*   Energy harvesting to extend battery life.
