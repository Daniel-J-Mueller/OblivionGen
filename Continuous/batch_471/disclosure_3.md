## Adaptive Environmental Sonification for Pre-Fall Risk Assessment

**Concept:** Expand fall *detection* into fall *prediction* by leveraging environmental sonification correlated to subtle changes in gait, balance, and spatial awareness. This moves beyond reactive alerts to proactive interventions.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from the existing camera system with:
    *   Microphone array (minimum 4 directional microphones)
    *   Low-power radar module (for gait and movement tracking, even in low light/occlusion)
    *   Pressure sensors embedded in flooring (optional – high cost, but high accuracy for balance assessment).
*   **Gait/Balance Signature Creation:**
    *   Establish a baseline “normal” gait/balance signature for each user via initial learning phase (minimum 7 days of data collection). This signature will be a multi-dimensional vector encompassing:
        *   Step frequency & length.
        *   Center of gravity sway (estimated from radar/camera).
        *   Foot pressure distribution (from floor sensors or estimated from camera image analysis).
        *   Micro-movements/hesitations (detected from high-resolution radar/camera).
        *   Subtle audio cues (changes in footstep sound, slight vocalizations, etc.)
*   **Environmental Sonification Engine:**
    *   The system will dynamically generate subtle, localized soundscapes based on deviations from the user’s established baseline.
    *   Soundscapes will *not* be alarming, but designed to subtly encourage corrective actions. Examples:
        *   Slight increase in ambient music tempo if the system detects a slowing gait.
        *   Localized “flow” sounds (water, wind) if the system detects imbalance.
        *   Directional audio cues to guide the user towards stable surfaces.
    *   The sonification engine must be highly customizable based on user preference and environment.
*   **Risk Level Assignment:**
    *   A real-time risk level (Low, Medium, High) will be assigned based on the magnitude and duration of deviations from the baseline.
    *   Risk level will modulate the intensity and complexity of the sonification.
*   **Proactive Intervention Protocol:**
    *   **Low Risk:** Subtle sonification only.
    *   **Medium Risk:**  Sonification + gentle haptic feedback (if wearable is available) + optional visual cue (e.g., slight color change in ambient lighting).
    *   **High Risk:** Sonification + haptic feedback + visual cue + alert sent to designated caregiver/emergency services (with optional video feed).
*   **Data Logging & Machine Learning:** All sensor data and intervention events will be logged for ongoing machine learning to improve the accuracy of the baseline signatures and the effectiveness of the interventions.
*   **Pseudocode for Risk Assessment:**

```
function assessRisk(sensorData) {
    deviation = calculateDeviation(sensorData, baselineSignature);
    if (deviation < threshold1) {
        riskLevel = "Low";
    } else if (deviation < threshold2) {
        riskLevel = "Medium";
    } else {
        riskLevel = "High";
    }
    return riskLevel;
}

function calculateDeviation(sensorData, baselineSignature) {
    //Calculate the differences between sensor data and baseline.
    //Use weighted scoring to prioritize critical factors (e.g., center of gravity).
    //Return a combined deviation score.
}
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond *detecting* falls to *anticipating* them through environmental feedback. Uses subtle audio cues, rather than jarring alarms, to promote self-correction and prevent falls before they happen. Combines multiple sensor modalities for a more robust and accurate assessment.
