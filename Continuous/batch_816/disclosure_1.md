## Dynamic Content Stitching for Personalized Delivery

**Concept:** Extend the scheduled delivery system to dynamically stitch together content fragments *during* delivery, tailoring the experience based on real-time user context and network conditions. Instead of delivering pre-assembled ‘items’, deliver building blocks and assemble the final content on the device.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Content Fragmentation:**  The server system must be capable of fragmenting content (articles, videos, software updates, etc.) into smaller, independent units. Metadata associated with each fragment will define dependencies and rendering order.
2.  **Contextual Awareness:** The server must gather real-time user context, including:
    *   Network bandwidth/latency
    *   Device processing power
    *   User location (for localized content)
    *   Current app usage/activity (to infer user intent)
    *   Time of day/user habit patterns
3.  **Dynamic Assembly Algorithm:** Implement a server-side algorithm that selects and prioritizes content fragments based on the gathered context.
    *   The algorithm should aim to deliver a “good enough” experience rapidly, even under poor network conditions (progressive rendering).
    *   It should optimize for content relevance, minimizing perceived latency.
    *   The algorithm should adapt to changing conditions during the delivery process.
4.  **Delivery Queue Modification:** The existing delivery queue system needs to be modified to handle fragmented content. Each fragment will be treated as an independent deliverable with its own priority and dependencies.
5.  **Client-Side Rendering Engine:** The mobile device requires a rendering engine capable of:
    *   Receiving and caching fragmented content.
    *   Resolving dependencies between fragments.
    *   Rendering content progressively as fragments arrive.
    *   Handling errors and missing fragments gracefully.
6.  **Priority Levels:**
    *   **Critical Fragments:** Required for initial content display (e.g., headlines, key images).
    *   **Important Fragments:** Enhances the experience (e.g., detailed text, secondary images).
    *   **Optional Fragments:** Adds supplementary content (e.g., related articles, advertisements).

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function assembleDelivery(user, itemSet, context) {
  fragmentList = []
  for (item in itemSet) {
    fragments = item.getFragments()
    fragmentList.append(fragments)
  }

  prioritizedFragments = prioritize(fragmentList, context)
  deliveryQueue = createDeliveryQueue(prioritizedFragments)

  return deliveryQueue
}

function prioritize(fragmentList, context) {
  // Assign priority based on fragment type, network conditions,
  // user context, etc.
  // Higher priority = delivered first.

  scoredFragments = []
  for (fragment in fragmentList) {
    score = calculatePriorityScore(fragment, context)
    scoredFragments.append((fragment, score))
  }

  sortedFragments = sortByScore(scoredFragments) // Descending

  return sortedFragments
}
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **News Delivery:** Deliver headlines and key images immediately, followed by the full article text as bandwidth allows.
*   **Video Streaming:** Deliver low-resolution video first, progressively upgrading to higher resolutions.
*   **Software Updates:** Deliver critical security patches immediately, followed by non-essential features.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:**  Deliver recommended content fragments based on real-time user activity.
