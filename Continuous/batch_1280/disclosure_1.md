## Dynamic Authentication 'Echo' System

**Concept:** Expand the QR code authentication method into a continuous, passively verified authentication 'echo'. Instead of a single-point authentication event, leverage persistent, low-energy signals to continuously verify device and user legitimacy.

**Specs:**

1.  **Signal Generation:** First authenticated device (initial source) generates a unique, rapidly changing (e.g., every 5-10 seconds) low-energy Bluetooth beacon signal. This signal *isn't* for pairing, but a 'heartbeat' containing a cryptographically signed timestamp and a portion of the original unique identifier.
2.  **'Echo' Capture & Verification:** Secondary devices (targets) passively listen for these beacon signals. Upon reception, the device captures the signal, verifies the cryptographic signature (using a public key associated with the user account/initial device), and confirms the timestamp falls within an acceptable window.
3.  **Proximity & Multi-Hop Verification:**  The system allows for 'multi-hop' authentication. If the secondary device is *not* within direct Bluetooth range of the original device, it can relay the received signal (after verification) to other nearby devices, forming a 'chain' of authentication back to the source. Each hop requires a small processing cost and adds a layer of trust.
4.  **'Trust Score' Calculation:** Each device maintains a 'trust score' for the user and initial device. This score is influenced by:
    *   Signal strength
    *   Frequency of signal reception
    *   Number of hops (lower is better)
    *   Deviation of timestamps (indicates potential man-in-the-middle attacks)
5.  **Dynamic Access Control:** Access to sensitive resources is granted based on the 'trust score'. A low score might trigger additional authentication factors (e.g., biometric scan, PIN) or restrict access entirely.
6.  **Secure Signal Relay:** Signal relays must utilize a secure, authenticated channel to prevent malicious actors from injecting false signals. A lightweight encryption protocol can be used to protect the signal integrity.

**Pseudocode (Secondary Device - Authentication Attempt):**

```
function attemptAccess(resource):
    trustScore = calculateTrustScore()

    if trustScore > threshold:
        grantAccess(resource)
    else:
        requestAdditionalAuthentication()

function calculateTrustScore():
    // Listen for beacon signals for 'scanDuration'
    signals = listenForBeacons(scanDuration)

    if signals.length == 0:
        return 0

    // Calculate score based on signal strength, frequency, hops, timestamp deviation
    score = 0
    for signal in signals:
        score += signal.strength * weightStrength
        score += signal.frequency * weightFrequency
        score += signal.hops * weightHops
        score += (1 - signal.timestampDeviation) * weightTimestamp

    return score

```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Home Security:** Seamlessly authenticate users within the home without requiring constant logins.
*   **Access Control Systems:** Grant access to buildings or restricted areas based on proximity and verified identity.
*   **Secure Device Pairing:** Simplify device pairing by leveraging continuous authentication.
*   **Automotive Security:** Authenticate drivers and passengers within a vehicle.
