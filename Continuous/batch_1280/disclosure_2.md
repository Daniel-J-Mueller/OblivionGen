## Dynamic Action Prediction & Pre-emptive Command Generation

**Core Concept:** Extend the systemâ€™s ability to learn user intent *before* explicit selection, predicting likely actions and pre-generating commands for faster response times and a more fluid user experience. This shifts from reactive control to proactive assistance.

**System Specs:**

*   **Prediction Engine:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on user interaction data (prompt selections, command sequences, observed actions, time between actions) to predict the next likely action given the current state. This engine runs locally on the media controller device.
*   **Confidence Threshold:** A configurable parameter defining the minimum prediction confidence required to trigger pre-emptive command generation.
*   **Pre-emptive Command Queue:** A buffer to store pre-generated commands based on high-confidence predictions. Commands are timestamped and invalidated if the predicted action doesn't occur within a defined time window.
*   **Action Context Module:** Tracks context including time of day, recent device activity (what's been playing, volume level), and user profile settings to refine action predictions.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Provide subtle haptic feedback on the user interface indicating predicted actions.  A stronger vibration suggests higher confidence.
*   **Command Validation System:** Continuously monitors the media device's actual state. If a predicted action is invalidated (user chooses a different action, device state changes unexpectedly), the system resets prediction weighting for that user/device combination.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - runs continuously on media controller

function process_input(input_data) {
  // 1. Receive input from UI/IR receiver/HDMI
  // 2. Update Action Context Module (time, device state, user profile)
  // 3. Run RNN Prediction Engine (based on context and input)
  predicted_action = RNN.predict(context, input)
  confidence = RNN.confidence(predicted_action)

  if (confidence > Confidence_Threshold) {
    // Generate predicted command
    predicted_command = Command_Generator(predicted_action)
    // Add to pre-emptive command queue (timestamped)
    Queue.add(predicted_command, current_time)
  }

  // Process actual user selection/input
  actual_action = get_user_selected_action(input)
  actual_command = Command_Generator(actual_action)

  // If predicted action was correct (within a time window)
  if (predicted_action == actual_action && Queue.peek().command == actual_command) {
    // Remove predicted command from queue
    Queue.remove_first()
    // Reward RNN (increase weight for this prediction)
    RNN.reward(predicted_action)
  } else {
    // Reset RNN weighting for this context
    RNN.reset_weighting()
  }

  // Send actual command to media device
  send_command(actual_command)
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased processing power for the RNN and prediction engine.
*   Sufficient memory to store RNN weights and the pre-emptive command queue.
*   Haptic feedback actuator integrated into the user interface.
