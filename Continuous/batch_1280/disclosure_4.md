## Microfluidic Patterning with Dynamic Wettability Control

**Concept:** Leverage the principles of electrowetting as described in the provided patent, but move *beyond* simply creating layered structures. Instead, use a microfluidic system integrated with dynamically adjustable wettability surfaces to create transient, 3D micro-structures *within* the liquid layers themselves. This moves the focus from static layer creation to dynamic fluid manipulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Substrate:** A patterned substrate composed of individually addressable micro-electrodes embedded within a dielectric layer. The electrode pattern defines regions where wettability can be locally controlled. The material should be transparent to allow for optical monitoring.
*   **Microfluidic Channels:** A network of microfluidic channels etched into a top layer, positioned *above* the patterned substrate. These channels act as inlets/outlets for the first and second liquids. Channel dimensions: Width: 50-200 µm, Depth: 20-50 µm.
*   **Liquids:** First liquid: A low-viscosity oil. Second liquid: An aqueous solution with conductive additives (e.g., KCl).  Both liquids must be immiscible.
*   **Electrode Control System:** A programmable voltage source capable of independently controlling the voltage applied to each micro-electrode. Resolution: 1 mV, Update rate: 1 kHz.
*   **Optical Monitoring System:** A high-speed camera and microscope objective for real-time observation of the micro-structure formation. Resolution: 1 µm, Frame rate: 30 fps.
*   **Software Control:** Software to define electrode activation patterns, voltage profiles, and fluid flow rates. Capabilities: (1) Generation of complex electrode activation sequences. (2) Real-time feedback control based on optical monitoring. (3) Import/Export of design parameters.

**Operation:**

1.  The first liquid (oil) is introduced into the microfluidic channels, forming a continuous layer on top of the patterned substrate.
2.  The second liquid (aqueous solution) is injected into the channels, creating droplets or streams *within* the oil layer.
3.  By selectively activating micro-electrodes, the wettability of specific regions on the substrate is altered. This causes localized changes in the interfacial tension between the oil and aqueous solution, *actively deforming* the droplets/streams.
4.  Complex 3D micro-structures can be created by coordinating electrode activation with fluid flow. The structures are transient, existing only as long as the electrode pattern and fluid flow are maintained.
5.  The optical monitoring system provides real-time feedback, allowing for dynamic adjustment of the electrode pattern and fluid flow to achieve precise control over the structure formation.

**Pseudocode for Structure Generation:**

```
// Define target structure (e.g., helix, sphere, cube)
Structure targetStructure;

// Initialize electrode pattern
ElectrodePattern electrodePattern;

// Initialize fluid flow parameters
FlowParameters flowParams;

// Main loop
while (structure not complete) {
    // Calculate required electrode activation pattern based on target structure
    electrodePattern = CalculateElectrodePattern(targetStructure);

    // Apply calculated electrode pattern to substrate
    ApplyElectrodePattern(electrodePattern);

    // Adjust fluid flow parameters
    flowParams = AdjustFlowParameters(targetStructure);

    // Update fluid flow
    UpdateFluidFlow(flowParams);

    // Capture image from optical monitoring system
    image = CaptureImage();

    // Analyze image to determine structure progress
    progress = AnalyzeImage(image);

    // Adjust parameters based on progress
    AdjustParameters(progress);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Micro-reactors with dynamically adjustable channel geometries.
*   Micro-manipulation of cells and particles.
*   Dynamic displays and optical devices.
*   Lab-on-a-chip devices for real-time analysis.
