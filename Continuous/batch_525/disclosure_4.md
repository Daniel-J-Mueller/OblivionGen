## Adaptive Quorum via Predictive Failure Analysis

**Specification:** Implement a system to dynamically adjust the 'pre-determined number of replicas' (quorum size) used in the failover protocol based on *predicted* failure rates of individual computing nodes. This expands upon the existing failover quorum concept by moving from a static threshold to a probabilistic one.

**Components:**

1.  **Node Health Monitor:** A daemon process running on each computing node. Collects and reports metrics including:
    *   CPU utilization
    *   Memory usage
    *   Disk I/O
    *   Network latency
    *   Hardware error logs (SMART data, etc.)
2.  **Centralized Prediction Engine:** A service running on a dedicated node (or distributed across multiple nodes for scalability). This engine receives health metrics from all Node Health Monitors.  It utilizes machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, time series analysis) to predict the probability of failure for each node within a defined time window (e.g., next hour, next day). The model must be retrainable and adaptable to changing system conditions.
3.  **Dynamic Quorum Manager:** A component integrated with the existing replica group management. It receives the failure probability predictions from the Prediction Engine.  It calculates a *weighted quorum size* for each replica group. Nodes with higher predicted failure probabilities receive lower 'weights' in the quorum calculation.
4.  **Weighting Function:** A configurable function to determine how failure probability influences a node’s weight in the quorum. Example: `weight = 1.0 - (predicted_failure_probability ^ exponent)`.  The ‘exponent’ parameter allows tuning of the sensitivity to failure predictions.
5.  **Quorum Calculation:** The Dynamic Quorum Manager calculates the minimum number of nodes needed in the quorum based on the weighted sum of node weights. For example, if a replica group has 5 nodes with weights 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4, and the required quorum threshold is 0.9, the system will prioritize including the higher-weighted nodes first.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Quorum Calculation):**

```
function calculate_quorum(replica_group, quorum_threshold):
  node_weights = get_node_weights(replica_group) // Fetch from Prediction Engine
  sorted_nodes = sort_nodes_by_weight(node_weights, descending=True)
  quorum_size = 0
  cumulative_weight = 0.0
  for node in sorted_nodes:
    cumulative_weight += node.weight
    quorum_size += 1
    if cumulative_weight >= quorum_threshold:
      break
  return quorum_size
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  Node Health Monitors continuously collect metrics.
2.  Metrics are transmitted to the Centralized Prediction Engine.
3.  Prediction Engine calculates failure probabilities.
4.  Dynamic Quorum Manager retrieves failure probabilities.
5.  For each replica group, the Dynamic Quorum Manager calculates the weighted quorum size.
6.  During failover, the system prioritizes including nodes with higher weights in the quorum.
7.  The Prediction Engine continuously retrains its models based on historical data and system events.

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The Centralized Prediction Engine may require distributed processing and scalable storage to handle a large number of nodes.
*   Communication between Node Health Monitors and the Prediction Engine should be optimized to minimize overhead.
*   The weighting function and quorum calculation should be computationally efficient to avoid impacting performance.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved system resilience by proactively adapting to potential failures.
*   Reduced impact of node failures on service availability.
*   Optimized resource utilization by prioritizing healthy nodes.
*   Enhanced ability to maintain quorum even in the face of multiple concurrent failures.
