## Dynamic Contextual Link Resolution & Sensory Integration

**Concept:** Expand dynamic link correction to incorporate real-time sensory data from the mobile device to further personalize and optimize affiliate links – moving beyond device *metadata* to actively sampled environmental & user data.

**Specification:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Mobile Device with:
    *   GPS
    *   Microphone
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope
    *   Ambient Light Sensor
    *   (Optional) Barometer
*   Secure Enclave or Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for data processing & privacy.
*   Network connectivity (WiFi/Cellular)

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Sensory Data Aggregator:**  A background service that continuously samples data from the sensors (GPS coordinates, ambient sound level, movement/activity, light levels, altitude).  Data is pre-processed (noise filtering, smoothing) & timestamped.
*   **Context Engine:**  This component receives sensory data from the Aggregator, plus app usage data (e.g., currently viewed content, time of day).  It analyzes this combined data to determine the user's *context* (e.g., "commuting on a bus", "relaxing at home", "actively exercising").  Machine Learning models (trained on anonymized data) will power context detection.
*   **Dynamic Link Resolver (DLR):**  Modified from the existing patent's DLR. Now receives *context data* from the Context Engine in addition to affiliate/device identifiers.
*   **Affiliate Link Database (ALDB):**  Expanded to include context-aware link variations.  Links are no longer just associated with devices; they are associated with *contexts*.
*   **Privacy Manager:** Enforces user privacy preferences.  Sensory data is anonymized before being used.  Users can control which sensors are used and opt-out of context-aware linking entirely.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  User accesses content within the application.
2.  An affiliate link is encountered.
3.  The Sensory Data Aggregator collects relevant sensor data.
4.  The Context Engine analyzes the data and determines the user's current context.
5.  The DLR queries the ALDB, requesting the optimal affiliate link based on:
    *   Affiliate Identifier
    *   Device Identifier
    *   User Context (as determined by the Context Engine)
6.  The ALDB returns the appropriate affiliate link.
7.  The DLR replaces the original affiliate link with the context-aware link.
8.  The user accesses the affiliate website via the updated link.

**IV. Pseudocode (DLR Modification):**

```
function resolveAffiliateLink(affiliateLink, deviceId, contextData) {

  // Query the Affiliate Link Database
  linkVariation = ALDB.getLink(affiliateLink, deviceId, contextData);

  if (linkVariation != null) {
    // Use the context-aware link variation
    return linkVariation;
  } else {
    // Fallback to default link correction (original patent behavior)
    return correctAffiliateLink(affiliateLink, deviceId);
  }
}
```

**V. Example Contexts & Link Variations:**

*   **Context:** "Commuting on a bus"
    *   **Link Variation:**  Affiliate link for audiobooks or podcasts.
*   **Context:** "Exercising outdoors"
    *   **Link Variation:** Affiliate link for sports equipment or fitness tracking apps.
*   **Context:** "Relaxing at home"
    *   **Link Variation:** Affiliate link for streaming services or home entertainment products.
*   **Context:** “High ambient noise”
    *   **Link Variation:** Affiliate link for noise cancelling headphones.

**VI.  Security & Privacy Considerations:**

*   All sensory data processing must occur on-device within the Secure Enclave or TEE.
*   Raw sensor data must *never* be transmitted off-device. Only aggregated context data is used.
*   Users must be provided with clear and transparent control over their data.
*   Anonymization and differential privacy techniques should be employed to protect user privacy.
