## Haptic Timer Feedback System

**Concept:** Augment the visual timer display with localized haptic feedback, creating a 'sensory clock' for enhanced accessibility and awareness.

**Specifications:**

*   **Device Integration:** System designed for integration with existing voice-controlled devices and associated timer displays (as outlined in the provided patent). It assumes the presence of a wearable device (wristband, smart glove, etc.) with multiple, individually addressable haptic actuators.
*   **Actuator Mapping:** The wearable will feature a circular array of miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) corresponding to minutes. Each LRA represents a minute on the timer.
*   **Haptic Intensity & Pattern:**
    *   **Timer Progression:** As the timer counts down, actuators will sequentially activate, creating a 'wave' of haptic feedback moving around the wearable. The intensity of each actuatorâ€™s vibration will correspond to the remaining time. (e.g. Strongest vibration at the beginning of the timer, fading to minimal vibration as time elapses).
    *   **Multiple Timers:**  For concurrent timers, each timer will be assigned a unique vibration pattern *and* position on the wearable. (e.g. Timer 1: short pulses, upper wrist. Timer 2: long, sustained vibration, lower wrist).
    *   **Proximity Awareness:** Device will monitor device proximity. Timer pulses will alter in intensity depending on how far away the user is from the origin device, reinforcing the awareness of the timer. 
*   **User Customization:**
    *   **Actuator Mapping:** User will have the option to customize the actuator mapping for optimal comfort and awareness. 
    *   **Vibration Patterns:** Users can select from a library of pre-defined vibration patterns or create custom patterns.
    *   **Intensity Control:** Adjustable vibration intensity for each timer.
*   **Software Implementation:**
    *   **API Integration:** SDK provided for seamless integration with existing voice-controlled device ecosystems.
    *   **Timer Data Parsing:**  Software module responsible for parsing timer data from the voice-controlled device and translating it into appropriate haptic signals.
    *   **Haptic Signal Generation:** Algorithm for generating precise haptic signals based on timer data and user preferences.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Signal Generation):**

```
function generateHapticSignal(timerData, userPreferences):
  timerDuration = timerData.duration
  remainingTime = timerData.remainingTime
  timerID = timerData.id

  // Retrieve user preferences for this timer
  preferredPattern = userPreferences.pattern[timerID]
  preferredIntensity = userPreferences.intensity[timerID]

  // Calculate actuator activation time based on remaining time
  activationTime = (timerDuration - remainingTime) / timerDuration 

  // Select actuators to activate (circular arrangement)
  activatedActuators = [activationTime * actuatorCount] 

  // Generate haptic signal for each actuator
  for each actuator in activatedActuators:
    signal = createHapticPulse(intensity: preferredIntensity, pattern: preferredPattern)
    sendSignalToActuator(actuator: actuator, signal: signal)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Integration with Ambient Lighting:** Synchronization of haptic feedback with ambient lighting cues for a more immersive experience.
*   **Biofeedback Integration:** Incorporate biofeedback sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) to adapt the haptic feedback to the user's emotional state.
*   **Accessibility Features:** Adjustable vibration frequencies and patterns for users with sensory sensitivities.
