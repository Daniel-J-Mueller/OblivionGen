## Dynamic Feature Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** The patent describes utilizing static features (holidays, promotions, etc.) to train a forecasting model. This innovation proposes a system where the *weights* assigned to these features are dynamically adjusted by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent *during* the forecasting process. This allows the model to adapt to changing market conditions and improve accuracy in real-time without requiring complete retraining.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Forecasting Core:**  The existing statistical model from the patent (multi-stage analysis, latent functions, approximate Bayesian inference) remains the core forecasting engine.
*   **Feature Weighting Agent:** An RL agent (e.g., using a Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm) that controls the weights assigned to each input feature.
*   **Environment:**  The forecasting process itself acts as the environment.  The environment receives weighted feature inputs, generates a forecast, and provides a reward signal based on forecast accuracy.
*   **Reward Function:** The reward function is critical. Itâ€™s a combination of:
    *   **Forecast Error:**  A negative reward proportional to the difference between the predicted demand and actual demand (e.g., Mean Absolute Percentage Error - MAPE).
    *   **Stability Penalty:** A small negative reward for large changes in feature weights between consecutive time steps. This encourages the agent to maintain stable weights and avoid erratic behavior.
    *   **Inventory Cost Penalty:**  A term to reflect the costs associated with overstocking or understocking inventory. This makes the agent sensitive to inventory-related losses.
*   **State Representation:** The state presented to the RL agent includes:
    *   Current values of all input features.
    *   Recent history of demand (e.g., the last 7 days).
    *   Current inventory level.
    *   Current feature weights.

**2. Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```
Initialize:
    - Forecasting Model (from patent)
    - RL Agent (e.g., PPO)
    - Initialize Feature Weights randomly

Loop for each time step:
    1. Observe State:
        - Get current feature values, demand history, inventory level, feature weights
    2. RL Agent Action:
        - Agent selects adjustments to Feature Weights based on current State
    3. Apply Weight Adjustments:
        - Modify Feature Weights
    4. Forecasting:
        - Forecasting Model generates Demand Forecast using weighted features
    5. Observe Reward:
        - Calculate Reward based on Forecast Accuracy, Stability, and Inventory Cost
    6. RL Agent Update:
        - Agent updates its policy based on the observed Reward and State transition
```

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Feature Scaling:**  All input features must be scaled to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) before being used by the RL agent.
*   **Weight Constraints:**  Impose constraints on the feature weights to prevent them from becoming too large or negative.
*   **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Implement an exploration strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to encourage the RL agent to explore different weight combinations.
*   **Parallelization:**  The RL agent training process can be parallelized to speed up the learning process.  Multiple agents can explore different weight combinations concurrently.
*   **Model Deployment:**  The trained RL agent (policy network) is deployed alongside the forecasting model.  In real-time, the agent adjusts the feature weights based on the current state, and the forecasting model generates the demand forecast.



This system allows the forecasting model to *learn* which features are most important under different circumstances, improving forecast accuracy and reducing inventory costs.  It provides a dynamic, adaptive forecasting solution that is more robust to changing market conditions.
