## Electronic Device - Modular Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Integrate a modular, dynamically reconfigurable haptic feedback system *within* the device casing, allowing for localized tactile sensations across the entire surface. Instead of relying on vibration motors, utilize an array of micro-pneumatic actuators and shape memory alloy (SMA) elements.

**Specs:**

*   **Actuator Grid:** A dense grid of individually addressable micro-pneumatic actuators (approx. 1mm diameter) and SMA ‘pins’ embedded beneath the device's outer casing. Density: 50 actuators/cm².
*   **Pneumatic System:** Miniature, on-board air pump and microfluidic channels delivering precise air pressure to each actuator. Pressure range: 0-20 kPa. Control resolution: 0.1 kPa.
*   **SMA Elements:** SMA pins capable of minute expansions/contractions, creating localized protrusions/indentations. Activation voltage: 5V, Response time: 10ms.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Capacitive proximity sensors positioned above each actuator/SMA element, detecting user touch and providing feedback loop data. Resolution: 0.1mm.
*   **Software Control:** Software layer enabling mapping of on-screen elements to specific actuator/SMA combinations.
    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        function map_element_to_haptics(element_id, haptic_pattern):
            //Retrieve actuator coordinates associated with element_id
            actuator_list = get_actuators_for_element(element_id)

            //Apply haptic pattern to actuators
            for each actuator in actuator_list:
                set_actuator_pressure(actuator, haptic_pattern.pressure)
                set_actuator_extension(actuator, haptic_pattern.extension)
        ```
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** System capable of switching between different haptic profiles (texture simulation, edge detection, virtual buttons) via software control.
*   **Casing Material:** Flexible polymer outer casing allowing for subtle deformation by actuators.  Durometer: 70A.
*   **Power Requirements:**  5V DC, <500mA.
*   **Actuator addressing:** Utilize a multiplexed addressable grid allowing individual control of each actuator using a minimal number of control lines.

**Innovation Detail:** This isn’t just vibration. It’s about creating nuanced tactile experiences across the entire device surface. Imagine “feeling” the edges of an icon, receiving directional cues through subtle pressure changes, or experiencing textures on a virtual object. The modular nature allows for customization and repair – damaged actuators can be individually replaced. The system will facilitate entirely new UI/UX paradigms.
