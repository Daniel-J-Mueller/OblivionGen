## Adaptive Scene Blending & Anticipation

**Concept:** Expand scene control beyond discrete state changes to *blended* transitions and *anticipatory* adjustments based on user behavior & environmental data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Profiling Module:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from:
    *   Voice control system (utterance history, time of day, detected emotion – analyzed via speech).
    *   Environmental sensors (light level, temperature, humidity, motion detection).
    *   Device usage patterns (historical data on device activation times, durations, and sequences).
    *   Calendar integration (scheduled events).
*   **Behavioral Profiling:** Employ machine learning (specifically recurrent neural networks – RNNs) to create a dynamic user profile predicting likely device requests based on accumulated data.  This is *not* a simple rule-based system; the goal is to learn complex correlations. The RNN must be capable of long-term dependency learning.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Map sensor data, time of day, and calendar events to contextual categories (e.g., “morning routine”, “movie night”, “work from home”).

**2. Blended Transition Engine:**

*   **State Representation:**  Represent device states as vectors within a multi-dimensional space.  This allows for interpolation between states. For example, light brightness and color temperature are dimensions.  Volume and equalization settings for audio are dimensions.
*   **Transition Curves:** Define a library of transition curves (e.g., linear, exponential, sinusoidal, Bezier) to control how devices move between states.  Curves are parameterized by duration and easing functions.
*   **Scene Composition:** Scenes are no longer defined as static state assignments but as *sequences* of blended transitions. A scene can specify a starting state, a target state, a transition curve, and a duration.

**3. Anticipatory Adjustment Module:**

*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Based on the behavioral profile and current context, predict the user's next likely device request (e.g., if the user typically turns on a lamp after turning off the TV, pre-dim the lamp).
*   **Proactive Adjustment:**  Subtly adjust device states *before* the user issues a command. For example, slightly increase the volume of the TV if the user is predicted to watch a movie.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Continuously refine the prediction algorithm based on user feedback (explicit commands, device overrides). If the user frequently overrides a proactive adjustment, the algorithm should lower the probability of that adjustment in the future.

**4.  Voice Command Interface Enhancements:**

*   **Contextual Interpretation:**  Voice commands are interpreted based on the current context and user profile. For example, "Dim the lights" might dim the lights to a different level depending on whether the user is watching a movie or reading a book.
*   **Implicit Commands:** Support implicit commands based on user behavior. For example, if the user walks into a room, automatically turn on the lights based on the current time of day and ambient light level.
*   **"Mood" Based Scenes**: A user can say "set a cozy mood", and the system adjusts all controllable elements according to a predefined 'cozy' profile or dynamically learns from historical data.

**Pseudocode (Anticipatory Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION predict_next_device_request(user_profile, context, current_device_states):
  // Analyze user_profile and context to identify likely next requests
  predicted_requests = MachineLearningModel.predict(user_profile, context)
  // Rank requests based on probability
  ranked_requests = sort(predicted_requests, by: probability)
  RETURN ranked_requests[0]  // Return the most likely request

FUNCTION apply_proactive_adjustment(predicted_request, current_device_states):
  // Determine the target device and desired state
  target_device = predicted_request.device
  target_state = predicted_request.state

  // Calculate the adjustment needed
  adjustment = target_state - current_device_states[target_device]

  // Apply the adjustment gradually over a short duration
  animate_device_change(target_device, adjustment, duration: 0.5 seconds, easing: "smooth")
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a central hub with sufficient processing power to run the machine learning models and manage device communication.
*   Reliable wireless network connectivity is essential for communicating with devices and accessing cloud-based services.
*   Integration with a wide range of smart home devices.
