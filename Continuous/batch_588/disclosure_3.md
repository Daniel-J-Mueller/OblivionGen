## Decentralized Reputation System for IoT Device Communication

**Concept:** Expand the threat detection framework to incorporate a decentralized reputation system for IoT devices, leveraging blockchain technology to establish trust and dynamically adjust communication permissions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Reputation Scoring:**

*   **IoT Agent:** Each IoT device will run a lightweight agent. This agent monitors network traffic *to and from* the device, recording communication events (source IP/Device ID, destination IP/Device ID, timestamp, data volume, protocol).
*   **Local Reputation Database:** Each IoT device maintains a local, encrypted database of reputation scores for other devices it has communicated with. Initial scores are neutral.
*   **Score Updates:** After each communication event, the IoT agent updates the reputation score of the communicating device based on a scoring algorithm (see Section 2).
*   **Data Aggregation:** Periodically (e.g., every 24 hours), the IoT agent aggregates its communication data and submits it to a regional "Edge Node" (see Section 3).

**2. Scoring Algorithm:**

*   **Base Score:** All devices start with a base reputation score (e.g., 50).
*   **Positive Indicators:**
    *   Successful, expected communication (e.g., device regularly checks in with a known server). +5 points.
    *   Low latency, high throughput communication. +1-3 points (scaled).
    *   Communication matching pre-defined "good" patterns (e.g., standard protocol usage). +2 points.
*   **Negative Indicators:**
    *   Failed communication attempts. -2 points.
    *   High latency, low throughput communication. -1-3 points (scaled).
    *   Communication matching known malicious patterns (signature-based detection). -10 points.
    *   Unexpected or unusual communication patterns (anomaly detection). -5 points.
    *   Reports from other devices indicating malicious activity. -10 points.
*   **Decay:** Reputation scores decay over time to account for changing behavior.

**3. Edge Nodes & Blockchain Integration:**

*   **Edge Nodes:** Regional Edge Nodes are responsible for collecting reputation data from nearby IoT devices.
*   **Data Validation:** Edge Nodes validate the received data for consistency and prevent malicious reputation manipulation.
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Edge Nodes commit aggregated, validated reputation data to a private, permissioned blockchain.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:**  A Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism ensures data integrity and prevents single points of failure.
*   **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts on the blockchain manage reputation scores, access control policies, and dispute resolution.

**4. Dynamic Access Control:**

*   **Policy Definition:** Network administrators define access control policies based on reputation scores. (e.g. "Devices with a reputation score below 20 are blocked.").
*   **Real-time Enforcement:** IoT devices consult the blockchain (via Edge Nodes) before establishing communication with other devices.
*   **Adaptive Trust:** Communication permissions are dynamically adjusted based on real-time reputation scores.
*   **Zero Trust Architecture:** This system facilitates a zero-trust network architecture, where trust is never assumed, and every communication attempt is verified.

**5. Dispute Resolution:**

*   **Reporting Mechanism:** Users can report suspected malicious activity or incorrect reputation scores.
*   **Evidence Submission:** Users can submit evidence (e.g., network logs, screenshots) to support their claims.
*   **Community Review:** A decentralized review process allows community members to assess the evidence and vote on the validity of the claim.
*   **Smart Contract Enforcement:**  Smart contracts automatically update reputation scores based on the outcome of the review process.



**Pseudocode (IoT Agent - Communication Attempt):**

```
function attemptCommunication(destinationDeviceID):
  reputationScore = getReputationScore(destinationDeviceID)
  accessGranted = checkAccessPolicy(reputationScore)

  if accessGranted:
    establishConnection(destinationDeviceID)
    updateReputationScore(destinationDeviceID, success)
  else:
    logBlockedAttempt(destinationDeviceID)
    reportSuspiciousActivity(destinationDeviceID)

function updateReputationScore(deviceID, communicationResult):
    // Apply scoring algorithm based on communicationResult
    // Submit updated data to Edge Node
```

This system would not simply detect malicious actors, but *proactively prevent* communication with potentially compromised devices, fostering a more secure and resilient IoT ecosystem.
