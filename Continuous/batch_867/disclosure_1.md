## Dynamic Data Masking with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the hashing/mapping concept to incorporate real-time behavioral biometrics as an additional layer of security *and* a dynamic masking mechanism. Instead of solely relying on a static hash of PII, integrate keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, or even subtle physiological signals (captured via wearable tech) into the data mapping process. This creates a ‘behavioral hash’ that’s unique to the user *at the time of access*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time behavioral data stream (keystroke timings, mouse trajectory, accelerometer data, etc.).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Data cleaning & normalization.
    *   Feature extraction (e.g., key press duration variance, average mouse speed, acceleration spikes).
    *   Generation of a ‘behavioral feature vector’.
*   **Output:** Normalized behavioral feature vector.

**2. Hybrid Hash Generation Module:**

*   **Input:**
    *   PII (e.g., Customer ID).
    *   Behavioral Feature Vector.
    *   Authorization Level (parameter for data masking granularity).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Concatenate PII and Behavioral Feature Vector.
    *   Apply a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to the combined data.
    *   Apply a masking function based on the Authorization Level. This could involve:
        *   Truncating the hash.
        *   Replacing portions of the hash with null values.
        *   Applying a bitwise operation.
*   **Output:** Masked Hybrid Hash Value.

**3. Data Store & Query System:**

*   **Data Store:** Utilize a NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra) to store data indexed by the Masked Hybrid Hash Value. Store the actual PII separately in an encrypted form with access control tied to administrative roles.
*   **Query Process:**
    1.  User initiates request for data.
    2.  System captures real-time behavioral data.
    3.  Hybrid Hash Generation Module generates a Masked Hybrid Hash Value.
    4.  Query the NoSQL database using the Masked Hybrid Hash Value.
    5.  If a match is found, retrieve the corresponding encrypted PII.
    6.  Decrypt the PII and return it to the user (subject to authorization checks).

**4. Dynamic Masking Rules Engine:**

*   Configurable rules engine that allows administrators to define:
    *   Which behavioral features are used in hash generation.
    *   The level of masking applied based on user roles, data sensitivity, and context (e.g., time of day, location).
    *   Thresholds for behavioral anomaly detection (to flag potentially fraudulent access attempts).

**Pseudocode (Hybrid Hash Generation Module):**

```
function generateHybridHash(pii, behavioralVector, authorizationLevel) {
    combinedData = pii + serialize(behavioralVector);
    hashValue = SHA256(combinedData);

    if (authorizationLevel == "Low") {
        maskedHash = substring(hashValue, 0, 16); // Truncate to 16 characters
    } else if (authorizationLevel == "Medium") {
        // Replace middle 8 characters with "X"
        maskedHash = substring(hashValue, 0, 8) + "XXXXXXXX" + substring(hashValue, 16);
    } else {
        maskedHash = hashValue; // No masking
    }

    return maskedHash;
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond static hashing to a dynamic system.  The behavioral biometrics component adds a layer of authentication *and* allows for dynamic data masking.  The level of data revealed can be adjusted based on the user’s behavior and authorization level. If the behavior deviates, access is denied or a different level of data is presented. This has implications for data privacy, security, and personalized user experiences.
