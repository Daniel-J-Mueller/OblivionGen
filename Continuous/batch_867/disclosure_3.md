## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Voice Control

**Concept:** Extend voice control beyond audio/visual outputs by integrating localized haptic feedback correlated to voice command confirmations, error states, and contextual UI elements. This will allow for “blind” operation and richer, more intuitive interaction with the device and connected systems.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Engine:** Array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or micro-motors) embedded within the device housing and/or detachable wearable components (wristband, finger cots). Minimum 32 actuators for granular control.
*   **Proximity/Touch Sensors:** Capacitive or ultrasonic sensors integrated with haptic actuators to detect user proximity and intentional touch.
*   **Voice Profile Integration:** User voice profiles will be associated with personalized haptic response curves. System learns user preferences for intensity, frequency, and patterns.
*   **Contextual Mapping Engine:** A software module that dynamically maps voice commands and system states to specific haptic feedback patterns. 
    *   **Confirmation:** Short, localized pulse on the actuator closest to the user’s dominant hand.
    *   **Error:** Rapid, escalating vibration pattern to indicate invalid command or system failure. Pattern changes based on error type (network, permission, etc.).
    *   **UI Element Focus:**  As the user verbally navigates a menu or list, actuators corresponding to the selected item will subtly vibrate.
    *   **Data Visualization:** Complex data points (volume levels, progress bars, sensor readings) can be represented by varying the intensity and frequency of haptic feedback on a designated area of the device or wearable.
*   **API Integration:** Open API for developers to create custom haptic experiences for their applications.
*   **Power Management:** Low-power haptic actuators and intelligent power management to minimize battery drain.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Bluetooth 5.0 or WiFi 6 for seamless integration with wearables and other devices.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Mapping Engine):**

```
function mapVoiceCommandToHaptics(voiceCommand, systemState, userProfile) {
  if (voiceCommand == "volume up") {
    intensity = calculateIntensity(systemState.volumeLevel, userProfile.volumeSensitivity)
    triggerHapticPulse(location = "rightSide", intensity = intensity, duration = 0.1)
  } else if (voiceCommand == "play music") {
    location = determineMusicPlayerLocation(systemState)
    triggerHapticPattern(location, pattern = "ripple", intensity = 0.5, duration = 0.2)
  } else if (systemState.error == "network_failure") {
    triggerHapticPattern(location = "deviceBase", pattern = "urgent", intensity = 0.8, duration = 0.5)
  } else if (systemState.uiFocus == "item_3") {
    triggerHapticPulse(location = "item_3_proximity", intensity = 0.3, duration = 0.1)
  } else {
    // Default: Gentle confirmation pulse
    triggerHapticPulse(location = "deviceTop", intensity = 0.2, duration = 0.05)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This extends voice control beyond purely auditory/visual outputs, adding a tactile dimension. This is particularly beneficial for accessibility, allowing visually impaired users to fully operate the device, and enhances the overall user experience by providing subtle, intuitive feedback. The adaptive mapping engine allows for a highly personalized and contextual haptic experience.
