**Dynamic Forum Weighting via Sentiment Analysis & User Roles**

**Concept:** Extend the existing forum creation/weighting system by incorporating real-time sentiment analysis of forum posts *and* weighting contributions based on verified user roles (e.g., "expert," "moderator," "verified buyer"). This creates a dynamically adjusted forum hierarchy – highly positive/constructive discussions from verified experts receive significantly boosted visibility & weight, potentially surfacing them *above* search results.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sentiment Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: All new forum posts.
    *   Process: Utilize a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (or train a custom one) to assign a sentiment score (-1.0 to +1.0) to each post.
    *   Output: Sentiment score appended to the post data.

2.  **User Role Verification System:**
    *   Integration with existing user authentication.
    *   Admin interface for assigning/verifying user roles (“expert,” “moderator,” “verified buyer”).  Criteria for assignment customizable.
    *   Role data appended to user profile.

3.  **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   Input:  Post sentiment score, User role, existing variation aggregate score (from the patent).
    *   Process:
        *   Base Weight: Initial weight assigned to a variation (as per the original patent).
        *   Sentiment Multiplier: `Sentiment Multiplier = 1 + (abs(Sentiment Score) * 0.5)` (Ensures even negative sentiment *increases* weight, albeit less).
        *   Role Multiplier:
            *   “Expert”: 2.0
            *   “Moderator”: 1.5
            *   “Verified Buyer”: 1.2
            *   Default: 1.0
        *   Aggregated Weight: `Aggregated Weight = Base Weight * Sentiment Multiplier * Role Multiplier`
        *   Variation Aggregate Score Update: The `Aggregated Weight` is added to the corresponding variation's aggregate score.

4.  **Forum Hierarchy Adjustment:**
    *   Periodically (e.g., every hour), re-sort the forum list based on the updated Variation Aggregate Scores.
    *   Display the highest-scoring forums prominently – potentially *above* standard search results, with clear indication of “Community Insights” or similar.
    *   Implement a “Trending Topics” section showcasing rapidly increasing forum scores.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculateAggregatedWeight(baseWeight, sentimentScore, userRole) {
  sentimentMultiplier = 1 + (abs(sentimentScore) * 0.5)

  switch (userRole) {
    case "expert":
      roleMultiplier = 2.0
      break
    case "moderator":
      roleMultiplier = 1.5
      break
    case "verified_buyer":
      roleMultiplier = 1.2
      break
    default:
      roleMultiplier = 1.0
  }

  aggregatedWeight = baseWeight * sentimentMultiplier * roleMultiplier
  return aggregatedWeight
}

// Inside forum post processing:
postSentiment = analyzeSentiment(postText)
userRole = getUserRole(userId)
baseVariationWeight = getBaseVariationWeight(variation)
aggregatedWeight = calculateAggregatedWeight(baseVariationWeight, postSentiment, userRole)

//Update the variation aggregate score with the aggregatedWeight
updateVariationAggregateScore(variation, aggregatedWeight)
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Sentiment Multiplier and Role Multipliers are tunable parameters.
*   Consider implementing a decay function for older forum posts to prevent stale information from dominating the rankings.
*   User roles could be expanded to include other categories (e.g., "product developer," "industry analyst").
*   UI elements to visually indicate the “quality” of a forum (based on aggregated sentiment scores).
