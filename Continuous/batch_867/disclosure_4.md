## Dynamic Resource Allocation based on Service Dependency Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the existing inter-region connectivity system to dynamically allocate resources (compute, bandwidth, storage) *within* each region based on real-time dependencies between subscribed services.  Currently, the patent focuses on establishing connectivity *between* services. This expands that to intelligently manage resources *supporting* those services.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Mapping Database:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Graph database. Nodes represent services. Edges represent dependencies (e.g., Service A requires data from Service B, Service C relies on compute from Service D).  Edge weights reflect dependency strength (critical, high, medium, low) and expected resource consumption.
*   **Population:** Automated discovery & manual overrides.  System probes service APIs to infer dependencies.  Operators can define/modify dependencies.
*   **Updates:** Real-time monitoring of service performance (latency, throughput, errors). Dependency weights adjust based on observed impact.

**2. Resource Allocation Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Dependency map, current service demand (requests/second, data transfer rates), available resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth, storage) in each region.
*   **Algorithm:**  Prioritized allocation based on dependency strength.  Critical dependencies receive highest priority.  Algorithm attempts to maximize resource utilization *while maintaining* service performance targets.
*   **Allocation Strategy:**
    *   **Static Allocation:**  Pre-allocate resources based on expected peak demand.
    *   **Dynamic Allocation:**  Scale resources up or down based on real-time demand. Uses predictive modeling based on historical data.
    *   **Resource Borrowing:**  Temporarily "borrow" resources from less critical services.

**3. API Extensions:**

*   **`getServiceDependencies(serviceID)`:** Returns a list of dependent services and their resource requirements.
*   **`allocateResources(serviceID, resourceType, amount)`:**  Requests allocation of specific resources.
*   **`releaseResources(serviceID, resourceType, amount)`:** Releases allocated resources.
*   **`getRegionalResourceAvailability(regionID, resourceType)`:** Returns available resources in a specific region.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Centralized Controller:** Manages dependency map, resource allocation engine, and API.
*   **Regional Agents:** Monitor resource utilization, enforce allocation policies, and report metrics to the controller.
*   **Integration:** Connects to existing resource management systems (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenStack).

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Engine):**

```pseudocode
function allocateResources(serviceID, resourceType, amount):
  dependencyMap = getDependencyMap(serviceID)
  criticalDependencies = filter(dependencyMap, dependency.strength == "critical")

  for dependency in criticalDependencies:
    requiredResources = dependency.resourceRequirements
    if availableResources(dependency.region, requiredResources) < requiredResources:
      // Attempt to scale resources
      scaleResources(dependency.region, requiredResources)
      if availableResources(dependency.region, requiredResources) < requiredResources:
        // Resource allocation failed
        return ERROR_RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE

  // Allocate resources to serviceID
  allocate(serviceID, resourceType, amount)
  return SUCCESS
```

**Innovation:** This isn't simply about connecting services, it's about proactively managing the resources *supporting* those services, leading to improved performance, efficiency, and resilience. It moves from reactive connectivity to proactive resource orchestration.
