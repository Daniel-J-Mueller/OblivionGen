## Adaptive Packet Fragmentation & Reassembly with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on hierarchical routing based on destination address subsets. This inspires a system for *proactive* network adaptation based on predicted bandwidth constraints *before* packet loss occurs, utilizing intelligent fragmentation and buffering. Instead of *reacting* to congestion, the system anticipates and preemptively adjusts.

**Specs:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Proactive Bandwidth Prediction Module (PBPM):**  Resides at each router level (1, 2, & 3 in the patent’s architecture).  PBPM utilizes machine learning models trained on historical network traffic data, real-time queue lengths, and link capacities. It predicts upcoming bandwidth bottlenecks *before* they manifest as packet loss.  Outputs a “Bandwidth Availability Factor” (BAF) for each outbound link.  BAF ranges from 0.0 (completely congested) to 1.0 (fully available).
*   **Adaptive Fragmentation Engine (AFE):**  Located at the originating router (or first-hop router). Receives packets and BAF data from the PBPM for the destination path.  Based on the BAF, AFE dynamically fragments packets into smaller segments.  The goal is to ensure each segment’s size is small enough to reliably traverse the predicted bottleneck links.
*   **Predictive Buffer Management (PBM):**  Implemented at each router. PBM pre-allocates buffer space based on the incoming packet size *and* the predicted number of fragments.  This prevents buffer overflows even with highly fragmented packets.  PBM maintains a “Fragment Completion Table” (FCT) to track the arrival of fragments belonging to a single packet.
*   **Reassembly Engine:** Located at the destination router. Upon receiving all fragments (as tracked by the FCT), the reassembly engine reconstructs the original packet.

**2. Data Structures:**

*   **Fragment Header:** Added to each fragmented packet. Contains:
    *   Packet ID: Unique identifier for the original packet.
    *   Fragment Number: Sequence number indicating the fragment’s position within the original packet.
    *   Total Fragments: Total number of fragments in the original packet.
    *   Original Packet Length: Length of the original, unfragmented packet.
*   **Fragment Completion Table (FCT):**  A hash table mapping Packet ID to a record containing:
    *   Total Fragments Expected: The expected number of fragments.
    *   Fragments Received: A counter for fragments received.
    *   Fragment Buffer: A buffer to store incoming fragments in the correct order.

**3. Algorithm (Simplified Pseudocode - AFE - Adaptive Fragmentation Engine):**

```pseudocode
function fragmentPacket(packet, destinationPath):
  destinationBAF = getBandwidthAvailabilityFactors(destinationPath)
  maxSegmentSize = calculateMaxSegmentSize(destinationBAF) // Based on lowest BAF
  
  if packet.size > maxSegmentSize:
    fragments = []
    start = 0
    fragmentNumber = 0
    
    while start < packet.size:
      end = min(start + maxSegmentSize, packet.size)
      fragment = packet.slice(start, end)
      
      fragmentHeader = createFragmentHeader(packet.id, fragmentNumber, totalFragments(packet), packet.size)
      fragment = prependHeader(fragment, fragmentHeader)
      
      fragments.append(fragment)
      
      start = end
      fragmentNumber += 1
      
    return fragments
  else:
    return [packet] // No fragmentation needed
```

**4. Operational Flow:**

1.  Originating router receives packet.
2.  AFE calculates BAF along the destination path.
3.  If fragmentation is required, AFE splits the packet into fragments and adds fragment headers.
4.  Fragments are transmitted.
5.  Intermediate routers utilize PBM to pre-allocate buffers based on predicted fragment counts.
6.  Destination router receives fragments.
7.  Reassembly engine reconstructs the original packet based on the fragment headers and FCT.

**5. Considerations:**

*   The accuracy of the PBPM is crucial for system performance.
*   Overhead introduced by fragment headers should be minimized.
*   The system should be robust to fragment loss (e.g., using retransmission mechanisms).
*   Integration with existing Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms can further improve performance.
