## Dynamic Audio Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the digital fingerprinting and similarity matching to enable reconstruction of the *scene* captured within an audio file. Rather than simply identifying *if* an audio file matches content, we infer *where* and *how* it was recorded, providing contextual metadata.

**Specs:**

1.  **Environmental Feature Extraction:**  Develop a feature extraction module that analyzes audio segments *beyond* fingerprinting. This module analyzes reverb, echoes, ambient noise (traffic, birdsong, machinery), and spatial audio cues (if present).  Acoustic modeling will be employed to estimate room size, material properties, and dominant sound sources. 
2.  **Scene Database:** Create a database of acoustic ‘scenes’. Each scene entry contains:
    *   Acoustic signature (vector of reverb characteristics, ambient noise profiles, source profiles).
    *   Geographic location data (latitude, longitude, altitude).
    *   Semantic labels (e.g., "busy street," "forest," "indoor concert hall," "office").
    *   Associated visual data (panoramic images or 3D models of the scene).
3.  **Scene Matching Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm to compare the extracted features from an input audio segment to the scene database. This will use a multi-metric similarity score incorporating:
    *   Spectral similarity (current fingerprinting).
    *   Reverb matching (estimates room acoustics).
    *   Ambient noise correlation.
    *   Spatial audio analysis (if applicable).
4.  **Probabilistic Scene Inference:**  Rather than a hard match, the system outputs a *probability distribution* over the possible scenes. This acknowledges ambiguity and uncertainty in the inference.  Bayesian networks could be employed for this.
5.  **Metadata Enrichment:** Add inferred scene metadata (location, environment type, likely recording conditions) to the audio file.
6.  **Dynamic Scene Map Generation:** Implement a 'scene map' that visualizes the distribution of audio recordings across geographic locations and environment types. This could be a web-based application with interactive features.

**Pseudocode (Scene Matching):**

```
function match_scene(audio_segment):
  features = extract_features(audio_segment) // spectral, reverb, noise
  
  probabilities = {}
  for scene in scene_database:
    similarity_score = calculate_similarity(features, scene.features)
    probabilities[scene] = similarity_score
  
  //Normalize Probabilities
  total_score = sum(probabilities.values())
  for scene in probabilities:
    probabilities[scene] /= total_score

  return probabilities //Dict of Scene:Probability

function calculate_similarity(features1, features2):
  spectral_similarity = cosine_similarity(features1.spectral, features2.spectral)
  reverb_similarity = euclidean_distance(features1.reverb, features2.reverb)
  noise_similarity = cosine_similarity(features1.noise, features2.noise)

  //Weighted Sum – Weights Tunable
  total_similarity = (0.6 * spectral_similarity) + (0.2 * (1/reverb_similarity)) + (0.2 * noise_similarity)
  return total_similarity
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Content Discovery:** Users can search for audio recordings based on location or environment type.
*   **Automated Audio Tagging:** Automatically categorize audio recordings based on inferred scene.
*   **Forensic Audio Analysis:**  Help establish the location and recording conditions of audio evidence.
*   **Immersive Audio Experiences:**  Generate realistic soundscapes based on inferred environment.
