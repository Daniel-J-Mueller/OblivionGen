## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction via Distributed Microphone Arrays & Holographic Beamforming

**Concept:** Expand upon the ray-based acoustic modeling to not just *estimate* the Room Impulse Response (RIR), but to actively *reconstruct* a 3D acoustic hologram of the sound source within the environment. This goes beyond simple localization to create a dynamic, visualizable representation of the sound field.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Distributed Microphone Array: Multiple devices (phones, dedicated sensors) equipped with high-quality microphones deployed throughout a space. Minimum 3 devices, ideally 5-10 for larger areas. Device-to-device communication via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Wi-Fi.
    *   Edge Computing Units: Each device/array node contains a low-power processor (e.g., ARM Cortex-A53) for pre-processing and initial signal analysis.
    *   Central Server: High-performance server for data aggregation, holographic reconstruction, and visualization.
*   **Software:**
    *   Acoustic Ray Tracing Module: Refined ray tracing engine incorporating material properties (absorption, reflection) and geometric details of the environment. Initial environment map can be crowdsourced (user uploads photos/floorplans) or created through SLAM.
    *   Distributed Beamforming Algorithm:  Holographic beamforming (HB) applied to the data received from the distributed microphone array.  HB allows for focusing on multiple sound sources simultaneously and reconstructing the full sound field. 
    *   RIR Estimation & Refinement: Use the existing ray-based RIR estimation as a starting point, and then refine it based on the HB reconstruction. This allows for overcoming limitations of ray tracing in complex environments.
    *   3D Acoustic Hologram Rendering Engine:  Visualizes the reconstructed sound field as a 3D hologram, showing the location, intensity, and direction of sound sources. Color-coding indicates different frequency bands.
    *   Dynamic Environment Mapping:  The system continuously updates the environment map based on user input and sensor data. This allows for adapting to changing acoustic conditions (e.g., doors opening, furniture moving).
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

    ```
    // Initialization
    Create Environment Map (User input, SLAM)
    Define Device Locations in Environment Map
    Initialize Ray Tracing Engine
    Initialize Holographic Beamforming Engine

    // Real-time Processing Loop
    For Each Device:
        Capture Audio Data
        Perform Noise Reduction
        Transmit Audio Data & Device Location to Central Server

    On Central Server:
        Aggregate Audio Data from All Devices
        Estimate Initial RIR using Ray Tracing (based on environment map)
        Perform Holographic Beamforming (using RIR as initialization)
        Refine RIR based on HB results (iterative process)
        Generate 3D Acoustic Hologram Visualization
        Transmit Hologram to User Display
    ```

*   **Novelty:**  Existing acoustic modeling focuses on RIR estimation for audio processing. This system *visualizes* the sound field, allowing users to “see” the sound, which has applications in security (detecting hidden sound sources), augmented reality (enhancing sound localization), and architectural acoustics (analyzing room acoustics).
*   **Potential Refinements:**
    *   Incorporate machine learning to automatically identify and classify sound sources (speech, music, alarms).
    *   Develop a gesture-based interface for interacting with the acoustic hologram.
    *   Integrate the system with virtual/augmented reality headsets for immersive sound visualization.
