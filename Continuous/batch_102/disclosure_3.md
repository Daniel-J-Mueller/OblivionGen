**Variable Geometry Ducted Fan System with Bio-Inspired Articulating Vanes**

**Concept:** Extend the idea of connected propeller tips to a fully ducted fan system where the duct itself isn’t static, but actively reshapes its geometry *in response* to flight conditions, mimicking the way a fish’s fin or a bird’s wing adjusts. This moves beyond simple pitch control to true 3D airflow manipulation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Duct Construction:** Segmented, flexible duct composed of overlapping ‘scales’ – similar to an armadillo’s plating – constructed from a shape-memory alloy (SMA) and a lightweight polymer composite. Each scale is independently controllable.
*   **Actuation:** Each scale is actuated by miniature linear actuators (piezoelectric or micro-servo) controlled by a central flight control computer. Actuation range: +/- 15 degrees relative to the duct centerline.
*   **Fan Blades:** Variable pitch fan blades, independently controllable via swashplate mechanism. Blade count: 6-8. Material: Carbon fiber composite.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Sensor Array: IMU, airspeed sensor, pressure sensors distributed along the duct interior, strain gauges on the duct scales.
    *   Algorithm: Neural network trained to optimize duct shape and blade pitch based on flight conditions (speed, altitude, angle of attack, turbulence). Focus is on maximizing thrust-to-power ratio and minimizing noise.
    *   Control Modes:
        *   Cruise: Optimized for efficiency. Duct shapes to minimize drag and turbulence.
        *   Maneuver: Aggressive shaping for maximum turning radius and responsiveness.
        *   Hover: Precise control of airflow for stable hovering.
        *   Emergency: Rapid reconfiguration of duct to maintain control in adverse conditions (e.g., wind gusts).
*   **Duct Geometry:**
    *   Initial Configuration: Elliptical cross-section.
    *   Variable Geometry:
        *   Contraction/Expansion: Duct diameter can be varied along its length to accelerate or decelerate airflow.
        *   Asymmetric Shaping: Duct can be deformed asymmetrically to induce yaw or roll.
        *   Variable Camber: Sections of the duct can be cambered to create lift or direct airflow.
*   **Power Requirements:** Dedicated power supply for actuators. Integrated regenerative braking to recapture energy from actuator movements.
*   **Material Properties:** SMA selected for high actuation force and rapid response time. Polymer composite chosen for lightweight and high strength. All materials rated for wide temperature range.
*   **Scalability:** Modular design allows for varying duct length and diameter to suit different UAV sizes and payloads.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
loop:
    read sensor data (IMU, airspeed, pressure, strain)
    process data (Kalman filter to estimate flight state)
    predict optimal duct shape and blade pitch (neural network)
    calculate actuator commands
    send commands to actuators
    monitor actuator performance
    if error detected:
        apply corrective action
    end if
    delay (10 ms)
    goto loop
```

**Innovation:** The system isn't just *controlling* airflow; it's *sculpting* it, mimicking biological systems for superior aerodynamic performance. The duct isn’t a passive component but an active, intelligent surface that adapts to the environment.
