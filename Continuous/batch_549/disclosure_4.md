## Dynamic Digital Item 'Shadowing' for A/B Testing and Feature Rollout

**Concept:** Extend the core ingestion process to create and manage “shadow” versions of digital items – functionally identical copies with subtle instrumentation for real-time A/B testing and gradual feature rollout *without* requiring app resubmission or user updates.

**Specs:**

*   **Ingestion Extension:** Modify the ingestion pipeline to not only accept a digital item but also to optionally define ‘shadow’ configurations. These configurations define instrumentation points (code hooks) and alternative server endpoints.
*   **Instrumentation Framework:** A lightweight, embedded instrumentation library added during the ingestion process. This library captures telemetry data (performance metrics, usage patterns, error rates) based on predefined configuration within the shadow profile.
*   **Traffic Splitting:** Implement a server-side traffic-splitting mechanism. This allows a small percentage of users (defined by configurable criteria – device type, location, user group, etc.) to be directed to the shadowed version of the digital item.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** The shadow configuration (instrumentation points, server endpoints, traffic split percentage) must be dynamically configurable *without* app resubmission. A dedicated control panel/API is needed for managing these configurations.
*   **Real-time Telemetry Dashboard:** A visual dashboard displaying real-time telemetry data captured from the shadowed digital item. Key metrics should be highlighted, and alerts should be configurable for anomalies.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** A one-click rollback mechanism to instantly revert all traffic to the original digital item in case of critical issues with the shadowed version.
*   **Shadow Profile Storage:** A dedicated storage system for shadow profiles, including the original digital item, the instrumentation configuration, and the traffic splitting rules.

**Pseudocode (Ingestion Process Modification):**

```
function ingestDigitalItem(item, shadowConfig) {
  // 1. Validate item
  // 2. If shadowConfig is provided:
  //    a. Create a copy of the digital item
  //    b. Inject instrumentation library into the copy
  //    c. Modify server endpoints within the copy based on shadowConfig
  //    d. Store the original item and the modified shadow item in the Shadow Profile Storage
  //    e. Apply the traffic splitting rules for the shadow item
  // 3. Add the (potentially modified) digital item to the distribution catalog
}

function applyShadowConfig(item, shadowConfig) {
  //Logic for applying instrumentation and server endpoint changes
}

function trafficSplit(user, shadowConfig){
  //Logic to determine if user should receive shadow version
}
```

**Possible Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Shadowing:** Tailor shadow configurations to individual users based on their behavior or preferences.
*   **Automated A/B Testing:** Integrate with an A/B testing framework to automatically optimize shadow configurations based on performance metrics.
*   **Predictive Shadowing:** Use machine learning to predict potential issues with new features and proactively create shadow versions to test them.
