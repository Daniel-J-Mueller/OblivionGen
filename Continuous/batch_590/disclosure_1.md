## Dynamic Key Shards & Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical key system by fragmenting keys into 'shards' distributed across multiple entities, combined with a system for temporally-bound access rights defined *within* the key itself. This moves beyond simple hierarchical decryption to a dynamic, collaborative, and time-limited access model.

**Specifications:**

*   **Key Shard Generation:** Root key generates a set of ‘n’ key shards. Shards are not complete keys, but cryptographic portions necessary to *reconstruct* the key.  Shard generation utilizes a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir’s Secret Sharing).
*   **Shard Distribution:** Shards are distributed to authorized entities (users, devices, services). Each entity holds *only* their assigned shard(s).
*   **Temporal Access Control (TAC) Encoding:** Each shard contains embedded TAC metadata. This metadata defines:
    *   `Activation Time`: The earliest time the shard is valid for key reconstruction.
    *   `Expiration Time`: The latest time the shard is valid. After this, the shard is unusable.
    *   `Usage Flags`:  Define permissible actions with the reconstructed key (e.g., decrypt only, decrypt & modify, audit access).
*   **Key Reconstruction Protocol:**  To reconstruct the key:
    1.  A requesting entity initiates a ‘Key Reconstruction Request’.
    2.  Authorized shard holders respond with their shards *only if*:
        *   The current time is within the shard’s `Activation Time` and `Expiration Time`.
        *   The requested operation aligns with the shard’s `Usage Flags`.
    3.  A ‘Reconstruction Coordinator’ aggregates valid shards.  If sufficient valid shards are collected, the key is reconstructed using a defined combination algorithm.
    4.  The reconstructed key is used for the authorized operation.
*   **Audit Logging:** All shard requests, validations, and key reconstructions are logged with timestamp, requesting entity ID, shard holder ID, and operation details.
*   **Revocation Mechanism:** A ‘Key Revocation Authority’ can invalidate a shard *before* its natural expiration, rendering it useless. This triggers a notification to shard holders. Revocation events are logged.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction Coordinator):**

```
FUNCTION ReconstructKey(requestingEntityID, operationType):
    keyShards = []
    shardResponses = SendShardRequests(requestingEntityID, operationType) // Broadcast requests to all shard holders

    FOREACH response IN shardResponses:
        IF response.isValid AND (CurrentTime >= response.shard.ActivationTime AND CurrentTime <= response.shard.ExpirationTime) AND (operationType IN response.shard.UsageFlags):
            keyShards.append(response.shard)

    IF len(keyShards) >= Threshold: // Threshold determined by Secret Sharing scheme
        reconstructedKey = CombineShards(keyShards)
        LogEvent("Key Reconstruction Successful", requestingEntityID, reconstructedKey)
        RETURN reconstructedKey
    ELSE:
        LogEvent("Key Reconstruction Failed - Insufficient Shards", requestingEntityID)
        RETURN NULL
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **Secure Enclave/TPM:** Shard storage and key reconstruction processes should occur within a secure enclave (e.g., Intel SGX) or utilize a TPM to protect shards from compromise.
*   **Distributed Ledger (Optional):**  Shard ownership and revocation events can be recorded on a distributed ledger to ensure transparency and immutability.
*   **API Integration:** Standardized APIs for shard requests, validations, and key reconstruction.
*   **Scalability:** System must be designed to handle a large number of shards and shard holders.
