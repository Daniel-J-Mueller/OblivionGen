## Adaptive RF Spectrum Mapping with Bioacoustic Correlation

**Concept:** Combine RF interference detection with ambient sound analysis to create a dynamic, localized spectrum map. This map isn’t just about *what* interferes, but *where* the interference originates *in relation to* environmental sounds. This allows for far more intelligent channel selection and interference mitigation, especially in dense urban or indoor environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing RF interference detection circuit (as described in the provided patent) – serves as baseline.
    *   MEMS microphone array (4-8 microphones) – high sensitivity, low noise.
    *   Dedicated audio processing unit (DSP) – handles real-time audio analysis.
    *   Geolocation module (GPS/Indoor Positioning System) – for mapping.
    *   High-speed data bus connecting all modules.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **RF Interference Detection Module:** (Existing functionality, optimized for low latency) - Measures RF power levels and calculates congestion metrics. Outputs RF 'heatmaps' as data arrays.
    *   **Bioacoustic Analysis Module:**
        *   **Sound Event Detection (SED):** Identify and classify environmental sounds – traffic, human speech, machinery, birdsong, etc. – using machine learning models.
        *   **Sound Source Localization (SSL):** Estimate the direction of arrival (DoA) of detected sound sources using time difference of arrival (TDoA) and beamforming techniques.
        *   **Correlation Engine:** This is the core innovation. Correlate RF interference 'hotspots' with localized sound sources. For example: *“High RF interference at 2.4 GHz coincides with the location of a known microwave oven.”* or *“Increased interference on Channel 6 occurs when a specific vehicle passes a certain point.”*
    *   **Dynamic Spectrum Map:** A visualized representation of the correlated RF and acoustic data. The map displays:
        *   RF interference levels (color-coded heatmap).
        *   Sound source locations (icons).
        *   Correlation links between RF hotspots and sound sources (lines/visual cues).
        *   Time-series data for RF and acoustic levels.
    *   **Adaptive Channel Selection Algorithm:** Uses the dynamic spectrum map to choose the least interfered channel. Prioritizes channels that are spatially separated from known interference sources (e.g., avoids channels where interference coincides with a microwave oven).
*   **Pseudocode (Adaptive Channel Selection):**

```
function selectChannel(spectrumMap, interferenceThreshold):
  availableChannels = allChannels()
  filteredChannels = []

  for channel in availableChannels:
    isInterfered = False
    for interferenceSource in spectrumMap.interferenceSources:
      if interferenceSource.channel == channel and interferenceSource.power > interferenceThreshold:
        isInterfered = True
        break

    if not isInterfered:
      filteredChannels.append(channel)

  if filteredChannels is empty:
    return bestAvailableChannel() // Fallback to standard algorithm

  return filteredChannels[0] // Select the first available channel
```

*   **Data Output:**
    *   Real-time dynamic spectrum map data (for visualization).
    *   Correlation logs (for analysis and machine learning).
    *   Channel selection recommendations.

**Innovation:** This system goes beyond simply detecting RF interference. It *understands* the environment, learns from it, and proactively avoids interference by leveraging readily available acoustic information. The ability to correlate RF disturbances with real-world events opens up possibilities for targeted interference mitigation and improved wireless performance.
