## Dynamic Resolution Event Stitching

**Concept:** Extend the performance monitoring capabilities beyond individual functional block analysis by *stitching* event occurrences across multiple, dynamically adjusted time windows and functional blocks, creating a system-level activity trace. This goes beyond simply triggering other monitors – it aims to reconstruct a timeline of events *across* the system, relating seemingly disparate activities.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A “Stitch Controller” module. This operates in parallel with existing hardware performance monitors (like those described in the provided patent).
*   **Resolution Map:** A dynamically configurable table residing in fast memory (SRAM). This map associates functional blocks with specific time window resolutions. Lower resolutions for infrequent events, higher resolutions for critical paths. The Stitch Controller can adjust this map in real-time based on system load or pre-defined profiles.
*   **Event Forwarding:**  Each hardware performance monitor, upon detecting an event *within* its defined time window, doesn't just signal a threshold breach. It forwards:
    *   Timestamp (relative to a system-wide clock)
    *   Event Type Identifier
    *   Functional Block ID
    *   Event Count (for the current window)
    *   Time Window Resolution (from the Resolution Map)
*   **Stitch Controller Operation:**
    1.  Receives event data from all monitored functional blocks.
    2.  Normalizes timestamps based on the system clock.
    3.  Reconstructs a global event timeline, compensating for differing time window resolutions. This is achieved by interpolating event occurrences to a uniform, high-resolution timescale.
    4.  Implements event correlation logic.  This could be simple proximity-based matching, or more complex pattern recognition algorithms.
    5.  Provides an output stream of correlated events, tagged with timestamps, event types, and originating functional blocks.  This stream can be used for debugging, performance analysis, or system-level tracing.
*   **Data Buffering:** A circular buffer (implemented in fast memory) stores the reconstructed event timeline.  The buffer size is configurable.
*   **Triggering:** The Stitch Controller can trigger external events (e.g., start a system-level debugger, initiate a hardware capture) based on specific event correlations or patterns.

**Pseudocode (Stitch Controller):**

```
// Configuration: ResolutionMap, BufferSize

ON EventReceived(eventData):
    normalizedTimestamp = eventData.timestamp * (ResolutionMap[eventData.blockID] / BaseResolution)
    AddEventToBuffer(normalizedTimestamp, eventData.type, eventData.blockID)
    
    //Event correlation logic (simplified)
    recentEvents = GetRecentEvents(normalizedTimestamp - CorrelationWindow)
    IF EventCorrelationDetected(recentEvents, eventData):
        TriggerExternalEvent()

//Function to correlate events.
Function EventCorrelationDetected(recentEvents, currentEvent):
    FOR EACH event IN recentEvents:
        IF event.type == currentEvent.type AND event.blockID != currentEvent.blockID:
            RETURN TRUE
    RETURN FALSE
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Quickly identify the sequence of events leading to system errors or performance bottlenecks.
*   **Security Auditing:** Track the flow of data and control signals across the system to detect malicious activity.
*   **System Optimization:**  Identify critical paths and optimize resource allocation.
