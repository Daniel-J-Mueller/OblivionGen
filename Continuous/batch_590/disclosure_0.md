## Dynamic Environmental Mesh for Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *reacting* to environmental conditions. Create a dynamic, learned mesh of the user's typical environments, predicting resource needs *before* a task begins, rather than adjusting mid-task. This utilizes a persistent, localized map built from sensor data and user behavior, combined with predictive algorithms.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution depth sensor (ToF or structured light) - for environment mapping.
    *   Ambient light sensor - for current lighting conditions.
    *   Microphone array – for acoustic environment profiling (reverberation, noise levels).
    *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) – to track device/user movement and orientation.
    *   Optional: Bluetooth beacon detection for indoor localization refinement.
*   **Data Storage:**  Localized persistent storage (e.g., onboard flash or SD card) for environment mesh data.
*   **Environment Mesh Representation:**
    *   Octree-based volumetric map.  Each node stores:
        *   Average ambient light level.
        *   Average acoustic profile (spectral centroid, energy).
        *   Surface normal data (from depth sensor).
        *   Occupancy probability (is this space occupied?).
        *   Frequency of user presence (how often is this space visited?).
        *   Task History (what tasks are typically performed in this space?).
*   **Predictive Algorithm:**
    *   Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on historical data (environment mesh + task performance).
    *   Input: Current environment mesh node.
    *   Output: Predicted resource requirements (number of cameras, illumination levels, processing power) for common tasks.
*   **Resource Allocation Module:**
    *   Prioritizes resource allocation based on predictive algorithm output.
    *   Can proactively allocate resources *before* a task is initiated.
    *   Dynamically adjusts resource allocation during task execution based on real-time performance monitoring (as in the original patent).
*   **Task Profiling:**
    *   Each task is assigned a resource profile.
    *   Resource profile includes:
        *   Minimum resource requirements.
        *   Maximum resource requirements.
        *   Performance metrics (FPS, latency, accuracy).
*   **Learning & Adaptation:**
    *   Continuously updates environment mesh and task profiles based on user behavior.
    *   Employs reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation strategies.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Create EnvironmentMesh()
Load EnvironmentMesh from persistent storage (if available)

// Main Loop
While (Device is powered on) {
    CaptureSensorData()
    UpdateEnvironmentMesh(SensorData)
    DetermineCurrentLocation(EnvironmentMesh)
    PredictResourceRequirements(CurrentLocation, TaskType)
    AllocateResources(PredictedRequirements)
    MonitorTaskPerformance()
    AdaptResourceAllocation(PerformanceMetrics)
    Save EnvironmentMesh to persistent storage (periodically)
}

Function PredictResourceRequirements(Location, TaskType):
    Retrieve TaskProfile(TaskType)
    Retrieve LocationData(Location)
    Combine TaskProfile and LocationData
    Apply Predictive Algorithm (HMM or RNN)
    Return Predicted Resource Requirements
```

**Novelty:** Existing approaches focus on *reactive* resource allocation. This design proactively anticipates resource needs based on a learned model of the user’s environment and typical behaviors. The dynamic mesh provides a more granular understanding of the environment, allowing for more accurate predictions. This isn't simply about detecting light levels, but understanding *where* those light levels are within a 3D space and how that impacts task performance.
