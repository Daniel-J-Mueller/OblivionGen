## Dynamic Role Chains with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the existing token-based access control to allow for dynamically constructed "role chains" with time-limited validity for each link in the chain. This enables temporary, escalated privileges based on contextual factors, automatically reverting to base permissions after a defined period. 

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **RoleChain:** A linked list of `RoleToken` objects.
*   **RoleToken:** Contains:
    *   `role_id`: Identifier for the assumed role.
    *   `expiration_timestamp`: Absolute timestamp after which the role is automatically revoked.
    *   `context_tags`: Key-value pairs representing the conditions under which the role is valid (e.g., `location: "building A"`, `time_of_day: "9-5"`, `device_type: "mobile"`).
    *   `parent_token_id`:  ID of the preceding `RoleToken` in the chain (or null for the initial token).
    *   `signature`: Cryptographic signature ensuring token integrity.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Request:** A requestor obtains an initial `RoleToken` via the existing authentication mechanism. This token defines their base permissions.
2.  **Chain Extension Request:** The requestor requests access requiring a higher privilege (represented by a new role).
3.  **Contextual Validation:** The system evaluates the requestor’s context (location, time, device, etc.) against the `context_tags` associated with the target role.
4.  **Chain Link Creation:** If the context matches and the request is authorized, a new `RoleToken` is created, linked to the preceding token in the chain. The new token's `expiration_timestamp` is set based on a policy (e.g., 15 minutes, until end of shift).
5.  **Token Exchange:** The requestor presents the entire `RoleChain` to access resources.
6.  **Verification & Validation:** The resource server verifies:
    *   The digital signatures of all tokens in the chain.
    *   The continuity of the chain (each token has a valid `parent_token_id`).
    *   That the current time is before the `expiration_timestamp` of each token.
    *   That the requestor’s current context matches the `context_tags` of each relevant token.
7.  **Automatic Revocation:** A background process periodically checks for expired tokens and automatically revokes associated permissions.  Expired tokens are removed from the chain.

**3. Pseudocode (Token Verification):**

```
function verify_role_chain(role_chain, request_context):
  current_token = role_chain.head
  while current_token != null:
    if not verify_signature(current_token):
      return false // Invalid signature

    if current_time > current_token.expiration_timestamp:
      return false // Token expired

    if not context_matches(request_context, current_token.context_tags):
      return false // Context mismatch

    current_token = current_token.next

  return true // Chain valid
```

**4.  Implementation Notes:**

*   The system should use a robust key management system for signing and verifying tokens.
*   Contextual information should be securely obtained and verified.
*   The background revocation process should be efficient and scalable.
*   Consider a mechanism for the requestor to explicitly terminate a role chain before its natural expiration.
*   Logging and auditing are critical for security and compliance.

**5. Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Just-in-time access for sensitive data:** Grant temporary access to a database based on the user's location and time of day.
*   **Escalated privileges for emergency situations:** Allow a technician to temporarily bypass security controls during a critical outage.
*   **Dynamic access control for IoT devices:** Grant temporary access to a device based on its location and sensor readings.
