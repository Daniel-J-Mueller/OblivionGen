## Modular Bio-Acoustic Resonance Scanner

**Concept:** A wearable device that uses focused ultrasound and bio-acoustic resonance to non-invasively map internal organ health. Inspired by the idea of a ‘monitoring device’ but diverging into a diagnostic application far beyond simple tracking.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Flexible, segmented band worn around the torso (chest/upper abdomen). Segments are approx. 5cm x 5cm, connected by flexible, conductive polymer. Total of 12 segments.
*   **Transducers:** Each segment houses a miniature, phased-array ultrasonic transducer. Frequency range: 2-15 MHz, adjustable per segment.  Each transducer is capable of both emission and reception.
*   **Resonance Mapping Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Raw ultrasonic echo data from each transducer.
    *   Process:
        1.  **Frequency Sweep:** Each transducer sequentially sweeps through its frequency range, emitting short ultrasound pulses.
        2.  **Echo Analysis:** Received echoes are analyzed for resonance frequencies – frequencies at which echo amplitude is significantly amplified, indicating natural mechanical resonance of underlying tissue.
        3.  **Spatial Mapping:** Resonance frequencies are mapped to the corresponding location on the torso based on transducer position.  Creates a 3D ‘resonance map’ of internal organs.
        4.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Algorithm compares the resonance map to a baseline ‘healthy’ resonance map (created from a large database of scans).  Deviations indicate potential tissue anomalies (e.g., tumors, inflammation, fibrosis). Utilizes machine learning for improved accuracy.
    *   Output: Visual representation of the resonance map, highlighting areas of anomaly.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging via induction. Battery life: 8 hours continuous scanning.
*   **Data Transmission:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a paired smartphone or tablet for data display and analysis.
*   **Materials:** Biocompatible flexible polymer housing. Conductive polymer for interconnects.  Ultrasonic transducers encapsulated in a waterproof, biocompatible gel.
*   **Software Interface:** Mobile app with:
    *   Real-time resonance map display
    *   Anomaly highlighting & labeling
    *   Data logging & trend analysis
    *   Secure data storage & cloud upload
    *   Integration with electronic health records (EHR) - optional.
*   **Calibration:** Requires initial calibration scan performed by a medical professional to establish a baseline resonance map for the individual.
*   **Safety:**  Ultrasound intensity is automatically limited to safe levels based on tissue type and depth.  Real-time monitoring of ultrasound output.
*   **Refinement:** Add haptic feedback to the device to indicate areas of high resonance or anomaly.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (device is powered on) {
  for each segment in segments {
    segment.frequencySweep(startFrequency, endFrequency, stepSize)
    echoData = segment.receiveEchoes()
    resonanceFrequency = analyzeEchoes(echoData)
    mapResonance(segment.position, resonanceFrequency)
  }
  detectAnomalies()
  displayResonanceMap()
}

// analyzeEchoes function
function analyzeEchoes(echoData) {
  // Perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on echo data
  fftResult = FFT(echoData)

  // Find peaks in the FFT result (representing resonance frequencies)
  peaks = findPeaks(fftResult)

  // Return the strongest peak (representing the resonance frequency)
  return peaks[0]
}

// detectAnomalies function
function detectAnomalies() {
  // Compare current resonance map to baseline map
  deviation = calculateDeviation(currentMap, baselineMap)

  // Highlight areas of significant deviation
  highlightAreas(deviation)
}
