## Dynamic Workspace Acoustic Mapping & Alert System

**Concept:** Extend the visual mapping capabilities to include real-time acoustic mapping, creating a multi-sensory digital twin of the workspace. This system prioritizes identifying and localizing anomalous sounds – beyond simple obstruction detection – to proactively address safety hazards, equipment malfunctions, or unusual activity.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Array of low-latency, high-sensitivity microphones distributed throughout the workspace, integrated with existing fixed and on-demand sensor platforms (UAVs, mobile drive units, robotic manipulators).
    *   Each microphone equipped with a directional beamforming capability.
    *   Environmental noise cancellation algorithms applied at the sensor level.
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    *   **Acoustic Data Stream:** Each microphone continuously streams raw audio data to a central processing unit.
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Real-time feature extraction from the audio stream using techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and spectral analysis.
    *   **Sound Event Detection (SED):** Trained machine learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks) to identify predefined sound events:
        *   Emergency alarms (fire, chemical spill)
        *   Equipment malfunctions (leaks, grinding, erratic operation)
        *   Impact sounds (collisions, dropped objects)
        *   Human vocalizations (shouting, distress calls)
        *   Unusual noises outside expected parameters (novel sound events)
    *   **Source Localization:** Triangulation and time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) algorithms to pinpoint the location of detected sound sources within the workspace using the microphone array data.
*   **Digital Map Integration:**
    *   The system superimposes acoustic data – sound source locations, sound event types, sound intensity – onto the existing digital map.
    *   Real-time visualization of acoustic events on the map interface.
    *   Heatmaps to indicate areas with high sound intensity.
*   **Alerting & Response System:**
    *   **Severity Levels:** Assign severity levels to detected sound events (e.g., low, medium, high, critical).
    *   **Automated Alerts:** Trigger alerts based on severity level and pre-defined thresholds. Alerts delivered via visual interface, audio notifications, and integrated communication systems.
    *   **Automated Response:**
        *   **Autonomous Navigation:** Deploy on-demand sensors (UAVs, mobile units) to investigate the source of the alert.
        *   **Live Audio/Video Feed:** Stream live audio/video from the investigating sensor to a central monitoring station.
        *   **Remote Control Override:** Enable remote control of investigating sensors for targeted investigation.
        *   **Automated Safety Actions:** (If applicable and pre-programmed) Initiate automated safety actions such as shutting down equipment, activating emergency lighting, or initiating evacuation protocols.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   The system continuously learns from new acoustic data to improve sound event detection accuracy and reduce false positives.
    *   Machine learning models retrained periodically using newly labeled data.
*   **Pseudocode for Anomaly Detection:**

```
FUNCTION DetectAcousticAnomaly(audioStream, trainedModel)
    features = ExtractFeatures(audioStream)
    prediction = trainedModel.predict(features)
    anomalyScore = prediction.anomalyScore

    IF anomalyScore > threshold THEN
        RETURN TRUE // Anomaly detected
    ELSE
        RETURN FALSE // No anomaly detected
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION UpdateModel(newAudioData, labeledData)
    combinedData = newAudioData + labeledData
    retrainedModel = TrainModel(combinedData)
    RETURN retrainedModel
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** High-performance computing servers, dedicated network infrastructure for real-time data streaming, robust sensor platforms (UAVs, mobile drive units), high-quality microphones.
*   **Software Requirements:** Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch), audio processing libraries, map visualization software, communication protocols.

This system extends the workspace digital twin beyond visual data, creating a more comprehensive and proactive safety and operational awareness tool. It addresses potential issues *before* they escalate into major incidents.
