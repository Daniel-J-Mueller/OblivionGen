## Virtual Network ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Security

**Concept:** Expand the internal network scanning capabilities to proactively *simulate* network activity, creating a “shadow” network mirroring the live environment. This allows for predictive security analysis and ‘what-if’ scenario testing *without* impacting the production environment.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadow Network Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Virtual Network configuration data (IP ranges, subnets, security group rules, common application ports/protocols - obtained from the existing scanning system or network management tools).
*   **Process:**
    *   Creates a virtualized replica of the target network topology, including virtual machines (VMs) or containers mirroring the services within the live network.  These 'shadow' instances require minimal resources – primarily serving as endpoint/listener destinations.
    *   Configures network routing to direct simulated traffic to the shadow network.
    *   Establishes a bidirectional data mirroring pipeline - allowing monitoring of live network traffic *and* injection of simulated traffic.
*   **Output:** A fully functional, isolated shadow network environment.

**2. Simulated Traffic Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   User-defined traffic profiles (e.g., "typical web application load," "database query patterns," "potential DDoS attack").  These can be custom profiles or pre-built templates.
    *   Live network traffic data (analyzed for patterns and anomalies).
    *   Security threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Process:**
    *   Generates realistic network traffic mimicking the defined profiles or replicating observed live traffic.
    *   Injects the traffic into the shadow network.
    *   Simulates application-layer interactions (e.g., HTTP requests, database queries) to assess application behavior under load.
*   **Output:**  A continuous stream of simulated network traffic directed to the shadow network.

**3.  Predictive Security Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Shadow network traffic data.
    *   Security logs from shadow network VMs/containers.
    *   Anomaly detection algorithms.
    *   Security event correlation rules.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitors the shadow network for suspicious activity (e.g., unusual traffic patterns, unauthorized access attempts).
    *   Applies machine learning models to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Correlates security events to prioritize threats.
    *   Generates predictive security alerts.
*   **Output:**  Security reports, vulnerability assessments, and proactive security recommendations.

**4.  ‘What-If’ Scenario Testing Interface:**

*   **Input:** User-defined security policies, network configurations, or attack simulations.
*   **Process:**
    *   Applies the specified scenarios to the shadow network.
    *   Monitors the impact of the changes on network performance and security.
    *   Provides a visual representation of the test results.
*   **Output:**  Test reports, performance metrics, and security vulnerability assessments.



**Pseudocode (Predictive Security Analysis Module):**

```
FUNCTION AnalyzeShadowNetwork(trafficData, securityLogs):
    anomalies = DetectAnomalies(trafficData)
    vulnerabilities = IdentifyVulnerabilities(securityLogs)
    correlatedEvents = CorrelateEvents(anomalies, vulnerabilities)
    threatScore = CalculateThreatScore(correlatedEvents)

    IF threatScore > threshold:
        GenerateSecurityAlert(correlatedEvents)

    RETURN threatScore
```
