## Dynamic Router Personality Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the modular configuration system to incorporate “personality profiles” for routers, enabling adaptive behavior based on network conditions and predicted traffic patterns. Rather than solely reacting to environmental parameters at install/runtime, the router actively *learns* and anticipates needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Personality Profile Definition:** Profiles are JSON-based files containing weighted parameters influencing configuration module selection and execution. Parameters include:
    *   `Traffic_Pattern_Bias`: (0.0-1.0) Preference for prioritizing bandwidth, latency, security, or cost.
    *   `Application_Sensitivity`: (List of application names/identifiers with sensitivity levels: High, Medium, Low).
    *   `Security_Posture`: (Aggressive, Balanced, Permissive).
    *   `Geographical_Influence`: (Regional traffic expectations).
    *   `Historical_Performance`: (Metrics from previous operation periods).
*   **AI-Driven Profile Generation:**  A centralized AI engine analyzes network-wide data (traffic flows, security threats, application performance) to generate and refine personality profiles. Profiles are not static; they dynamically adjust over time.
*   **Profile Distribution:** Profiles are distributed to routers via a modified OSPF protocol, utilizing a new “Personality Profile Advertisement” LSA type. LSAs contain a hash of the profile data and a pointer to a central repository for retrieval.
*   **Router Controller Integration:** The router controller maintains a local database of downloaded profiles. It uses a scoring algorithm (based on the profile parameters and current network state) to select the most appropriate profile.
*   **Dynamic Module Loading/Unloading:** Based on the selected profile, the controller loads/unloads configuration modules dynamically. This isn’t just installation, but runtime swapping of modules to optimize performance. Modules can also be 'shadowed' - pre-loaded but inactive, ready for quick activation.
*   **Self-Learning Mechanism:** Routers continuously monitor their performance and adjust their profile scoring weights through a reinforcement learning algorithm. Successful configurations are rewarded, while ineffective ones are penalized, leading to optimization over time.
*   **"Chaos Engineering" Module:** A dedicated configuration module simulates network disruptions and dynamically adjusts the router's profile to test resilience and identify potential weaknesses.

**Pseudocode (Router Controller):**

```
function select_profile(current_network_state, available_profiles):
  best_profile = null
  best_score = -1

  for profile in available_profiles:
    score = calculate_profile_score(profile, current_network_state)
    if score > best_score:
      best_score = score
      best_profile = profile

  return best_profile

function calculate_profile_score(profile, current_network_state):
  score = 0
  // Weight factors based on current network state
  traffic_weight = current_network_state.traffic_load
  security_weight = current_network_state.security_threat_level

  // Calculate score based on profile parameters and weights
  score += profile.traffic_pattern_bias * traffic_weight
  score += profile.security_posture * security_weight

  // Add historical performance data (reward/penalty)
  score += profile.historical_performance_score

  return score

function apply_profile(selected_profile):
  // Load/unload configuration modules based on profile parameters
  for module in selected_profile.modules:
    if module.enabled:
      load_module(module)
    else:
      unload_module(module)
