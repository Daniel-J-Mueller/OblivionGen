## Dynamic Power Allocation via RF Harvesting & Beamforming

**Concept:** Extend the shelf/slot-level power-pooling concept by incorporating ambient RF energy harvesting *and* directed energy transfer (beamforming) to dynamically augment or even *replace* traditional power supply reliance for low-power components. This creates a more resilient, adaptable, and potentially self-sustaining power infrastructure within the rack.

**Specs:**

*   **RF Harvesting Modules:** Each shelf/slot-mountable electrical system will integrate a wideband RF harvesting module. This module will capture ambient RF signals (WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, broadcast) and convert them to DC power. Module specifications:
    *   Frequency Range: 700 MHz – 6 GHz
    *   Minimum Harvested Power: 50mW @ -20dBm signal strength
    *   Output Voltage: 3.3V, 5V (selectable)
    *   Integrated MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) circuit
*   **Beamforming Transmitter Array:**  A central (or distributed) array of beamforming transmitters will be positioned within the rack. These transmitters will operate in the ISM band (e.g., 915 MHz, 2.4 GHz) and transmit focused RF energy towards designated shelves/slots. Transmitter specifications:
    *   Operating Frequency: 915 MHz (configurable)
    *   Transmit Power: Adjustable, 0-10W
    *   Beamforming Algorithm: Digital beamforming with adaptive steering based on shelf/slot demand.
    *   Communication Protocol:  Dedicated low-bandwidth communication channel (e.g., Zigbee) to receive power requests from shelves/slots.
*   **Power Management Controller (PMC):** Each shelf/slot-mountable system will have a PMC. The PMC’s function is to intelligently blend power from three sources:
    *   Traditional Power Supply: Existing PSU connection.
    *   RF Harvesting Module: Power harvested from ambient RF signals.
    *   Beamformed RF Power: Power received from the beamforming transmitter array.
    *   **PMC Logic**:
        *   Prioritize Beamformed RF power to reduce PSU load.
        *   Use RF Harvesting as a supplementary source and for failover.
        *   Implement dynamic voltage scaling for connected computing devices.
        *   Monitor power availability from all sources and adjust power allocation accordingly.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Shelf/slot-mountable systems communicate power demands and status to a central rack controller via a dedicated bus (e.g., I2C, SPI).  Rack controller manages beamforming transmitter array and monitors overall rack power usage.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Rack Controller Software: Manages beamforming array, monitors power usage, and optimizes power allocation.
    *   Shelf/Slot Firmware: Implements power management logic and communicates with rack controller.

**Pseudocode (Shelf/Slot PMC):**

```
// Variables
float ambient_rf_power = 0;
float beamformed_rf_power = 0;
float psu_power = 0;
float total_power_demand = 0;

// Function: Read Power Levels
function read_power_levels() {
  ambient_rf_power = read_rf_harvesting_module();
  beamformed_rf_power = read_beamforming_receiver();
  psu_power = read_psu_output();
}

// Function: Calculate Total Power Demand
function calculate_power_demand() {
  // Sum power consumption of all connected devices
  total_power_demand = sum_device_power_consumption();
}

// Function: Allocate Power
function allocate_power() {
  read_power_levels();
  calculate_power_demand();

  // Prioritize Beamformed RF Power
  if (beamformed_rf_power < total_power_demand) {
    // Use Ambient RF Power
    if (ambient_rf_power < (total_power_demand - beamformed_rf_power)) {
        // Draw remaining power from PSU
        psu_power = total_power_demand - beamformed_rf_power - ambient_rf_power;
    } else {
        // Use only RF sources
        psu_power = 0;
    }
  } else {
    psu_power = 0; // Use only beamformed power
  }

  // Apply Dynamic Voltage Scaling to Devices
  for (device in connected_devices) {
    device.set_voltage(calculate_optimal_voltage(device, available_power));
  }
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  allocate_power();
  delay(100ms);
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced PSU Load & Energy Costs:**  Significant reduction in reliance on traditional power supplies.
*   **Increased Rack Resilience:** Ability to maintain operation even with PSU failures (dependent on RF availability).
*   **Self-Sustaining Operation:** Potential for self-powered racks in RF-rich environments.
*   **Dynamic Power Management:** Intelligent power allocation for optimal efficiency.
