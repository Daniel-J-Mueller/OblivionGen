## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning System

**Concept:** Expand the wireless speaker's functionality beyond simple visitor alerts to create a dynamic, localized sound system for the entire home, leveraging the repeater and direct wireless communication capabilities.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Wireless Speaker Unit:** (Existing base from patent) – Incorporate a multi-microphone array (4-8 mics) for sound source localization and noise cancellation. Add a high-quality, full-range speaker driver with a frequency response of 50Hz-20kHz.
*   **Acoustic Sensor Nodes:** Small, battery-powered wireless nodes containing a single microphone and a low-power radio (Bluetooth Low Energy/Zigbee). Designed to be placed strategically throughout the home. Range: 10-15 meters.
*   **Central Processing Unit (Hub):** Existing home automation hub (SmartThings, Home Assistant compatible) or dedicated unit. Handles sensor data processing, zone management, and audio routing.
*   **Software/Firmware:**  Embedded software on the wireless speaker and sensor nodes.  Hub-side application for zone configuration, audio source selection, and user control.

**Functionality & Workflow:**

1.  **Sensor Network Establishment:** Acoustic sensor nodes are deployed throughout the home. They constantly listen for sounds and transmit signal strength/time-of-flight data to the central hub via a mesh network.  The wireless speaker acts as a primary gateway/repeater for this mesh network, extending range.
2.  **Acoustic Mapping & Zone Creation:** The central hub processes data from the sensor nodes to build a real-time acoustic map of the home.  Users define zones via a mobile app (e.g., Living Room, Kitchen, Bedroom). Zone boundaries are determined by sensor data and user input.
3.  **Sound Source Localization:** When a sound event occurs (e.g., speech, music, alarm), the sensor nodes triangulate the source's location based on time-of-flight and signal strength.
4.  **Adaptive Audio Routing:** The central hub intelligently routes audio to the appropriate zones.
    *   **Speech Enhancement:** If speech is detected, audio is prioritized to the zone where the speaker is located, with reduced volume in other zones.
    *   **Music Streaming:** Music can be streamed to specific zones or the entire home. The system automatically adjusts volume levels based on ambient noise in each zone.
    *   **Alert Prioritization:** Critical alerts (e.g., smoke alarm) are broadcast to all zones with maximum volume.
5.  **Direct Wireless Integration:** The wireless speaker utilizes its direct wireless communication module to connect directly to a user’s smartphone. This enables voice control and personalized audio settings.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Volume Control):**

```
// Function: AdjustVolume(Zone, AmbientNoiseLevel)

Input: Zone (string), AmbientNoiseLevel (dB)

// Retrieve desired volume level for the zone
DesiredVolume = GetZoneVolume(Zone)

// Calculate adjusted volume based on ambient noise
AdjustedVolume = DesiredVolume + (AmbientNoiseLevel * GainFactor)

// Limit adjusted volume to maximum allowable level
AdjustedVolume = min(AdjustedVolume, MaxVolume)

// Set speaker volume for the zone
SetSpeakerVolume(Zone, AdjustedVolume)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Noise Cancellation Zones:** Create zones where noise is actively cancelled using multiple speakers and microphones.
*   **Personalized Audio Profiles:** Allow users to create personalized audio profiles that automatically adjust sound settings based on their preferences.
*   **Integration with Smart Home Ecosystem:** Integrate with other smart home devices (e.g., lighting, thermostats) to create immersive experiences.
*   **Security Applications:** Utilize the microphone array for intrusion detection and voice recognition.
