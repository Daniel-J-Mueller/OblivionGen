## Dynamic Narrative Stitching from Multi-Angle Media

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of automated network page generation to create interactive, multi-perspective narratives from available media. Instead of simply extracting keyframes for a static page, the system will dynamically stitch together short video clips from *multiple* source angles (if available) to build a concise, engaging storyline.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Digital video file (as in the provided patent)
    *   Multiple video streams *synchronized* to the primary video (e.g., director's cut, behind-the-scenes footage, alternate camera angles, user-generated content). The synchronization is crucial – ideally a common timestamp system.
    *   Metadata describing the video streams (camera position, subject focus, content type – “action,” “interview,” “establishing shot,” etc.).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Scene Detection:**  Apply scene detection algorithms to *all* input video streams simultaneously.  Identify scene boundaries based on visual cuts, audio changes, and metadata.
    2.  **Keyframe/Key-Segment Extraction (Modified):** Instead of looking for title/slogan regions, identify *actionable* moments within each scene.  Define "actionable" based on:
        *   Object detection (e.g., a character performing a specific action).
        *   Facial expression analysis (e.g., displaying strong emotion).
        *   Audio event detection (e.g., a gunshot, a dramatic musical cue).
        *   Motion detection (significant changes in the visual field).
    3.  **Perspective Scoring:**  For each actionable moment, assign a "perspective score" to each available video stream. Factors influencing the score:
        *   **Proximity to Action:** How close is the camera to the action?
        *   **Framing:** Is the action well-framed?
        *   **Emotional Impact:** Does the perspective enhance the emotional impact of the moment (e.g., a close-up on a character's face)?
        *   **Content Type:** Prioritize certain content types (e.g., a director’s commentary during a critical scene).
    4.  **Dynamic Stitching:**  Algorithmically assemble a cohesive narrative by selecting the highest-scoring segment from each perspective for each actionable moment.  Use smooth transitions (crossfades, wipes) between segments.  The length of each segment is constrained (e.g., 3-5 seconds) to maintain a fast pace.
    5.  **User Customization (Optional):** Allow users to choose preferred perspectives (e.g., "Director's Cut," "Behind-the-Scenes," "Action Focus").

*   **Output:**
    *   A dynamically generated video montage presenting a multi-faceted narrative.
    *   Interactive elements: Allow users to pause, rewind, and switch between perspectives.
    *   Automated generation of captions and metadata for each segment.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Algorithm):**

```
function stitch_narrative(primary_video, secondary_videos):
  scenes = detect_scenes(primary_video, secondary_videos)
  montage = []

  for scene in scenes:
    actionable_moments = find_actionable_moments(scene)

    for moment in actionable_moments:
      best_segments = []
      for video in [primary_video] + secondary_videos:
        segment = extract_segment(video, moment)
        score = calculate_perspective_score(segment, moment)
        best_segments.append((segment, score))

      best_segments.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)  # Sort by score
      montage.append(best_segments[0][0]) # Add highest scoring segment

  return montage
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced movie trailers.
*   Interactive documentaries.
*   Dynamic sports highlight reels.
*   Immersive training simulations.
*   Personalized video summaries.
