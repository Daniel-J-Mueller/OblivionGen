## Adaptive Query Pruning with Learned Cardinality Estimates

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting query pruning thresholds based on learned cardinality estimations for histogram buckets.

**Core Concept:** The provided patent focuses on using histograms and probabilistic data structures to *avoid* reading data blocks. This builds on that by making the decisions about *which* blocks to avoid more intelligent through machine learning. Instead of static thresholds for pruning, we adaptively tune them based on observed query patterns and data distribution shifts.

**Components:**

1.  **Cardinality Estimation Module:** A machine learning model (e.g., a gradient boosted tree or a neural network) trained to predict the number of rows within each histogram bucket, given the query predicates and recent query history. Features would include:
    *   Query predicates (e.g., `WHERE column > 10`)
    *   Histogram bucket ID
    *   Recent query frequency for that bucket
    *   Data block metadata (e.g., block size, modification time)
2.  **Dynamic Pruning Engine:** This module integrates with the existing query planner. It receives the cardinality estimates from the Estimation Module and adjusts the pruning thresholds accordingly. The thresholds determine how many rows *must* be present in a bucket for the data block to be considered for reading.
3.  **Feedback Loop:** A mechanism to continuously refine the Cardinality Estimation Module. After a query is executed, the actual number of rows returned from each data block is compared to the predicted cardinality. This difference is used as training data to update the model.
4.  **Metadata Store:** Stores the cardinality estimation model, historical query data, and data block metadata.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Query Received:** The query planner receives a query with predicates on a column using the histogram.
2.  **Cardinality Estimation:** For each histogram bucket relevant to the query predicates, the Cardinality Estimation Module predicts the number of rows likely to be present in the corresponding data blocks.
3.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The Dynamic Pruning Engine calculates a pruning threshold for each bucket based on the predicted cardinality, a configurable confidence level, and the cost of reading the data block.  A higher confidence level will require more evidence (higher cardinality estimate) before pruning.
4.  **Pruning Decision:** The query planner uses the adjusted pruning thresholds to determine which data blocks should be read. Blocks with estimated cardinality below the threshold are pruned.
5.  **Query Execution:** The query executes against the remaining data blocks.
6.  **Feedback Collection:** The actual number of rows returned from each data block is recorded.
7.  **Model Update:** The Cardinality Estimation Module is updated with the new feedback data to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Pruning Engine):**

```
function prune_data_blocks(query, histogram, data_block_metadata):
  relevant_buckets = determine_relevant_buckets(query, histogram)
  for bucket in relevant_buckets:
    estimated_cardinality = cardinality_estimation_module.predict(query, bucket)
    pruning_threshold = calculate_pruning_threshold(estimated_cardinality, confidence_level, data_block_cost)
    if estimated_cardinality < pruning_threshold:
      mark_data_block_as_pruned(data_block_metadata, bucket)
  return filtered_data_block_metadata
```

**Innovation:**  Moving beyond static pruning to a dynamic, learning-based system. This allows the system to adapt to changing data distributions, query patterns, and data skew, resulting in improved query performance and reduced I/O. It addresses the limitations of fixed thresholds by learning from historical data and making more informed pruning decisions.
