## Dynamic Fragment Pre-fetching & Predictive Resolution Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic video fragment restructuring to proactively pre-fetch fragments based on predicted user interaction *and* dynamically scale the resolution of pre-fetched fragments based on network conditions *and* predicted viewing focus within the frame.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Pre-fetching Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data (e.g., swipe speed, gaze tracking, predicted scroll direction), network bandwidth, current playback speed, fragment dependency graph.
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on user interaction patterns to predict the next N fragments likely to be requested.  The RNN receives swipe velocity, gaze direction, and historical fragment request data as inputs.
    *   Assign a "prefetch priority score" to each predicted fragment. Factors contributing to the score:
        *   RNN prediction confidence.
        *   Fragment size (smaller fragments prioritized to reduce latency).
        *   Dependency graph distance (fragments with fewer dependencies prioritized).
    *   Maintain a prefetch queue, ordered by priority score.
    *   Initiate background downloads of fragments from the queue, balancing prefetch rate with available bandwidth.  Use a congestion control algorithm (e.g., BBR) to avoid network saturation.
*   **Output:** List of fragments to pre-fetch.

**2. Adaptive Resolution Scaling Module:**

*   **Input:** Network bandwidth, predicted user gaze location within the frame (from gaze tracking hardware/software), fragment dependency graph, current playback resolution, pre-fetched fragment data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide each pre-fetched fragment into regions of interest (ROIs). The central ROI will be centered around the predicted gaze location.
    *   Calculate a "resolution budget" based on available bandwidth and a target overall frame rate.
    *   Allocate resolution to each ROI dynamically. The central ROI receives the highest resolution, with resolution decreasing radially outwards.  Use a priority scheme â€“ prioritize essential visual elements (e.g., faces, text) within each ROI.
    *   Encode and store multiple versions of each pre-fetched fragment, each corresponding to a different resolution allocation scheme.
    *   During playback, select the appropriate fragment version based on the current resolution budget and predicted gaze location.
*   **Output:** Selected fragment version with dynamically scaled resolution.

**3. Fragment Dependency Graph Integration:**

*   The system leverages the fragment dependency graph from the original patent, utilizing it to make informed decisions about which fragments to pre-fetch and which to prioritize during adaptive resolution scaling.
*   Fragments with strong dependencies are prioritized to ensure smooth playback.
*   Fragments with minimal dependencies are dropped during low-bandwidth scenarios without causing significant visual artifacts.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Resolution Scaling):**

```
function scale_resolution(fragment, bandwidth, gaze_location):
  // Divide fragment into ROIs based on gaze_location
  rois = divide_into_rois(fragment, gaze_location)

  // Calculate resolution budget based on bandwidth
  resolution_budget = calculate_budget(bandwidth)

  // Allocate resolution to each ROI
  roi_resolutions = allocate_resolution(rois, resolution_budget)

  // Select fragment version with allocated resolutions
  selected_fragment = select_version(fragment, roi_resolutions)

  return selected_fragment
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-bandwidth network connection.
*   Gaze tracking hardware/software (optional, but enhances performance).
*   Powerful processing unit for encoding/decoding and dynamic scaling.
*   Sufficient memory for storing multiple fragment versions.
*   RNN training data (user interaction patterns).
