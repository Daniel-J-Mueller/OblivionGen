## Secure Data Shuttle with Dynamic Segmentation & Attestation

**Concept:** Expand the “shippable storage device” paradigm into a system where data isn't just encrypted *on* the device, but dynamically segmented *across* multiple physically separate, tamper-evident modules within the device itself, each with independent attestation. This creates a far more robust security profile.

**Specification:**

**Hardware Modules:**

*   **Core Module (CM):** Houses the primary processor, TPM 2.0, initial bootloader, and a secure enclave.  Responsible for device attestation and key management.
*   **Data Modules (DM x N):**  N physically separate storage modules (e.g., SSDs, NVMe drives) within the device enclosure. Each DM has its own dedicated microcontroller, crypto engine, and tamper-evident packaging.  Data is distributed *across* these modules.
*   **Interconnect:** High-speed, secure interconnect (e.g., PCIe) between the CM and each DM. The CM controls access to all DMs.

**Software Components:**

*   **Segmentation Engine (SE):** Runs on the CM. Responsible for:
    *   Receiving data from the client (over network initially, then from the CM’s internal storage buffer).
    *   Splitting data into N segments.
    *   Encrypting each segment with a unique segment key.
    *   Distributing segments to the DMs via the interconnect.
*   **DM Controller (DMC):** Runs on each DM’s microcontroller. Responsible for:
    *   Receiving segments from the CM.
    *   Storing segments securely.
    *   Performing local attestation to prove data integrity and its own authenticity.
*   **Attestation Manager (AM):** Runs on the CM.  Collects attestation reports from each DMC, verifies their validity, and reports a consolidated device attestation to the service provider.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):** Implemented in both SE and AM. Derives segment keys from a master key securely exchanged with the service provider.
* **Tamper Detection Module (TDM):** Distributed across each DM. Continuously monitors for physical tampering. Raises alerts through DMC to AM.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Provisioning:** Service provider provisions a "Secure Data Shuttle" device. A master key is securely exchanged (out-of-band).
2.  **Client Data Preparation:** The client encrypts data with a client key. This adds a layer of client control, separate from the system's encryption. This encrypted data is sent over the network to the CM's storage buffer.
3.  **Segmentation & Distribution:**
    *   The SE receives the client-encrypted data.
    *   It generates N unique segment keys using the KDF, derived from the master key.
    *   It splits the client-encrypted data into N segments.
    *   Each segment is encrypted with its unique segment key.
    *   The encrypted segments are distributed to the DMs via the interconnect.
4.  **DM Storage & Attestation:**
    *   Each DMC receives a segment.
    *   The DMC stores the segment securely.
    *   The DMC performs local attestation, generating a report confirming data integrity and its own authenticity.
5.  **Consolidated Attestation:** The AM collects attestation reports from all DMs. It verifies the reports and generates a consolidated device attestation report.
6.  **Data Shuttle Shipment:** The physical data shuttle is shipped to the service provider.
7.  **Service Provider Verification:**
    *   The service provider receives the data shuttle.
    *   It verifies the consolidated attestation report.
    *   It requests the DMs to provide their encrypted segments.
    *   The service provider decrypts the segments using the keys derived from the master key, then decrypts the client-encrypted data with the client key.
    *   Data integrity is verified through checksum comparison and attestation report analysis.

**Pseudocode (Segmentation Engine):**

```
function segment_and_distribute(client_encrypted_data, master_key, num_data_modules):
  segment_size = length(client_encrypted_data) / num_data_modules
  segments = []
  for i = 0 to num_data_modules - 1:
    segment = extract_segment(client_encrypted_data, i * segment_size, segment_size)
    segment_key = KDF(master_key + i) //Derive unique key for segment
    encrypted_segment = encrypt(segment, segment_key)
    segments.append(encrypted_segment)
    send_to_dm(segments[i], i) //Send to DM via Interconnect
  return
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Erasure Coding:** Implement erasure coding across the DMs to provide data redundancy and fault tolerance.
*   **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Integration:** Leverage the TPM on each DM to securely store and manage segment keys.
*   **Physical Security Sensors:** Integrate tamper-evident sensors and intrusion detection systems into the data shuttle enclosure.

This design moves beyond simply encrypting data on a portable device, and focuses on distributing risk and maximizing security through physical separation and independent attestation of data components.
