## Dynamic Preference Decay & Contextual Blending

**Concept:** Enhance recommendation accuracy by modeling not only *what* a user likes, but *how strongly* they like it *right now*, factoring in both time-based decay *and* immediate contextual signals. This moves beyond simple recency weighting and creates a more nuanced understanding of user intent.

**Specifications:**

1.  **User Preference Vector:** Each user maintains a vector representing their affinity for each item in the catalog. This isn't a static score, but a function of several factors.

2.  **Time Decay Function:** A configurable decay function (e.g., exponential, logarithmic) reduces the weight of past interactions (purchases, ratings, views) over time. The decay rate is user-specific and item-category specific – some categories (e.g., fashion) have faster decay rates than others (e.g., tools).

    *   `preference_score = base_score * exp(-decay_rate * time_since_interaction)`

3.  **Contextual Signal Integration:** Real-time contextual data is incorporated to *modulate* the preference vector. Contextual signals include:

    *   **Location:** User’s current location (if available). Influence preferences based on regional trends or local inventory.
    *   **Time of Day:** Different products are relevant at different times (e.g., coffee in the morning, movies at night).
    *   **Weather:** Weather conditions can significantly impact product choices (e.g., umbrellas on rainy days, sunscreen on sunny days).
    *   **Social Signals:** (Optional, with user consent) Aggregate social trends related to items.

4.  **Contextual Modulation Function:** A function that multiplies the preference score by a contextual weight.

    *   `contextual_weight = f(location, time_of_day, weather, social_signals)`
    *   `final_preference_score = preference_score * contextual_weight`

5.  **Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm:**

    *   **Step 1: Preference Calculation:** For each item, calculate the `final_preference_score` based on the time decay, user history, and real-time contextual signals.
    *   **Step 2: Neighborhood Selection:** Identify a neighborhood of items with high `final_preference_scores`.
    *   **Step 3: Ranking & Filtering:** Rank the neighborhood based on a combined score (preference score, item popularity, diversity) and filter out irrelevant items.
    *   **Step 4: Presentation:** Present the top-ranked items to the user.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_recommendations(user, items):
  user_preferences = user.get_preferences()
  current_context = get_current_context(user)

  recommendation_scores = {}

  for item in items:
    base_score = user_preferences.get(item, 0)  // Default to 0 if item not seen

    time_since_interaction = calculate_time_since_interaction(user, item)
    decay_rate = get_decay_rate(item.category)  // Category-specific decay

    preference_score = base_score * exp(-decay_rate * time_since_interaction)

    contextual_weight = calculate_contextual_weight(current_context, item)

    final_score = preference_score * contextual_weight

    recommendation_scores[item] = final_score

  sorted_recommendations = sort(recommendation_scores, descending=True)

  return sorted_recommendations
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   User transaction history (purchases, ratings, views)
*   Item metadata (category, price, description)
*   Real-time contextual data (location, time of day, weather, social signals)
*   Configurable decay rates per item category
*   Contextual weight mapping function

**Potential Benefits:**

*   More accurate and relevant recommendations
*   Increased user engagement and conversion rates
*   Improved ability to anticipate user needs
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing user preferences and external factors.
