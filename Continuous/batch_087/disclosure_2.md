## Dynamic API 'Shadowing' and Predictive Authorization

**Concept:** Extend the metadata-driven authorization described in the patent to include a system that proactively ‘shadows’ API calls and predicts potential authorization failures *before* they occur, using machine learning. This moves authorization from a purely reactive gatekeeper to a predictive system that improves performance and user experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow API Endpoint Creation:**

*   Upon deployment of any API endpoint, a corresponding ‘shadow’ endpoint is automatically created. This shadow endpoint mirrors the original but does not perform the core business logic.
*   All incoming requests are *duplicated* and sent to both the primary endpoint and the shadow endpoint.
*   The shadow endpoint’s sole purpose is to analyze the request metadata and predict authorization status.

**2. Request Feature Extraction:**

*   The shadow endpoint extracts features from the incoming request, including:
    *   Client ID
    *   API Endpoint
    *   Request Parameters (values are hashed/anonymized to protect data)
    *   Time of day
    *   Geographic Location (based on IP address – anonymized)
    *   Request frequency from the client
*   These features are combined into a vector representation for machine learning.

**3. Predictive Authorization Model:**

*   A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) is trained on historical request data, including successful and failed authorization attempts.
*   The model predicts the probability of authorization failure for each incoming request based on the extracted features.
*   Model training is continuous, adapting to evolving usage patterns.

**4. Early Rejection & Client Notification:**

*   If the predictive model determines a high probability of authorization failure (above a configurable threshold), the request is *immediately* rejected *before* reaching the primary endpoint.
*   A tailored error message is sent to the client, explaining the reason for rejection (e.g., “Insufficient permissions for this action”). This could also include guidance on how to rectify the situation.

**5. Dynamic Permission Assignment:**

*   When a client attempts an action that would normally be blocked but has a *low* predictive failure probability (suggesting an edge case or temporary issue), a system can dynamically assign permissions for a limited time.
*   This requires a separate approval workflow (e.g., email notification to an administrator).

**6. Pseudocode (Shadow Endpoint):**

```
function processShadowRequest(request) {
  features = extractFeatures(request)
  prediction = mlModel.predict(features)

  if (prediction.failureProbability > threshold) {
    log("Rejected request due to predicted authorization failure")
    return {
      status: "error",
      message: "Insufficient permissions"
    }
  } else {
    // Optionally: Log successful prediction
    return {
      status: "success"
    }
  }
}

function extractFeatures(request) {
    // Extract client ID, API endpoint, request parameters (hashed), time, location, frequency
    // Return a feature vector
}
```

**7. Data Pipeline:**

*   Real-time request data (including authorization results) is streamed to a data lake.
*   Data is preprocessed, cleaned, and transformed into a format suitable for model training.
*   A machine learning pipeline automatically retrains the predictive model on a regular basis.

**8. Integration with Existing Authorization System:**

*   The predictive authorization system operates in parallel with the existing metadata-driven authorization system described in the patent.
*   The predictive system *augments* the existing system, providing an additional layer of protection and improving performance.

This system shifts the focus from reactive enforcement to proactive prediction, enhancing both security and user experience.  It creates a more intelligent and adaptive API authorization framework.
