## Dynamic Workflow Sharding via Predictive Resource Demand

**Concept:** Extend the affinity-based routing to incorporate *predictive* resource demand. Instead of simply routing based on existing affinities (data locality, capability), proactively *shard* the workflow *before* execution, distributing tasks not just to nodes *with* resources, but to nodes *predicted* to have sufficient resources *when* the task needs them. This mitigates contention and improves overall throughput, particularly for long-running or complex workflows.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Demand Model (PDM):**

*   **Input:** Workflow definition (task dependencies, estimated execution time, resource requirements – CPU, memory, GPU, network bandwidth), historical execution data (resource usage per task type on each node, workflow completion times, node utilization), real-time node monitoring data (current CPU/memory/GPU/network load).
*   **Model:**  A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) trained on historical execution data and continuously updated with real-time node monitoring data.  The model predicts future resource demand for each node at specific time intervals.  Multiple models may be required, one for each resource type.
*   **Output:** A resource demand profile for each node over the workflow’s expected execution timeframe.  This profile indicates the predicted availability of each resource.

**2. Workflow Sharder:**

*   **Input:** Workflow definition, PDM output (resource demand profiles for all nodes).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Analyze task dependencies.
    2.  For each task, identify potential execution nodes based on required resources.
    3.  Using the PDM output, calculate a ‘contention score’ for each potential node. This score represents the predicted likelihood of resource contention at the task’s estimated execution time.
    4.  Assign tasks to nodes with the *lowest* contention scores, prioritizing nodes with sufficient resources.  This may involve re-ordering task execution within dependency constraints to further minimize contention.
    5.  Generate a sharded workflow definition specifying the assigned node for each task.

**3. Dynamic Resharding Module:**

*   **Trigger:** Monitor node health and resource availability during workflow execution. Detect deviations from the PDM predictions (e.g., node failure, unexpected load spikes).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Identify tasks currently executing or scheduled to execute on the affected node.
    2.  Using the sharded workflow definition and PDM output, identify alternative execution nodes with sufficient resources and low contention.
    3.  Re-route tasks to the alternative nodes, updating the sharded workflow definition accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Resharding):**

```
function dynamicResharding(nodeFailureEvent):
  affectedTasks = findTasksOnNode(nodeFailureEvent.nodeId)
  for task in affectedTasks:
    alternativeNodes = findAlternativeNodes(task.resourceRequirements, PDM.getFutureResourceAvailability())
    if alternativeNodes.size() > 0:
      bestNode = selectBestNode(alternativeNodes, PDM) // Prioritize nodes with lowest contention
      updateShardedWorkflow(task, bestNode)
      reRouteTask(task, bestNode)
    else:
      log("No suitable alternative node found for task: " + task.taskId)
      // Handle failure – potentially retry, pause workflow, or escalate

function selectBestNode(nodes, PDM):
  // Calculate a score based on predicted contention
  for node in nodes:
    contentionScore = PDM.getPredictedContention(node, task.estimatedExecutionTime)
    node.score = contentionScore
  // Return node with lowest contention score
  return nodes.sortBy(score).first()
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Task:**  `taskId`, `resourceRequirements` (CPU, memory, GPU, network), `estimatedExecutionTime`, `dependencies`, `assignedNode`
*   **Node:** `nodeId`, `resourceCapacity` (CPU, memory, GPU, network), `currentLoad` (CPU, memory, GPU, network), `healthStatus`
*   **PDM Output:** Time-series data representing predicted resource availability for each node.
