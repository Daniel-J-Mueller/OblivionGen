## Adaptive Mesh Network Interference Cancellation via Phased Array Beamforming

**Concept:** Leverage directional antennas and phased array beamforming within the wireless mesh network to actively cancel detected radar interference *before* it impacts data transmission, rather than reacting after detection via DFS.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **WAP Node Modification:** Existing WAP nodes will be retrofitted or designed with multi-element antenna arrays (minimum 4 elements per radio) capable of phased array beamforming. These arrays will support both transmit and receive functionality.
*   **Dedicated Interference Processing Unit (IPU):** Each WAP node will include an IPU – a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP) or FPGA – optimized for real-time beamforming calculations and interference cancellation algorithms.
*   **High-Precision Time Synchronization:**  Network-wide time synchronization (sub-microsecond accuracy) using PTP (Precision Time Protocol) or similar protocol to ensure coherent beamforming across nodes.

**2. Software/Algorithm Requirements:**

*   **Interference Mapping:**  The system will build a dynamic map of radar interference sources. This is achieved via:
    *   **Initial Calibration:**  A calibration phase where nodes passively scan for radar signals and estimate their direction-of-arrival (DoA) using beamforming techniques.
    *   **Continuous Monitoring:** Ongoing, low-power monitoring of the RF spectrum for new or changing interference sources.
*   **Beamforming Algorithm:** An adaptive beamforming algorithm to dynamically adjust the phase and amplitude of signals transmitted by the antenna array. The algorithm will:
    *   **Null Steering:**  Create nulls in the radiation pattern towards detected radar interference sources.
    *   **Beam Maximization:**  Simultaneously maximize signal strength towards intended recipients.
    *   **Algorithm Type:**  Employ a Least Mean Squares (LMS) or Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm for adaptive beamforming.
*   **Mesh Network Coordination:**  A distributed coordination protocol where neighboring WAP nodes share interference source information and beamforming parameters to collaboratively cancel interference across the mesh network.
*   **Dynamic Channel Allocation:** Integrate beamforming with DFS to intelligently allocate channels, prioritizing those least affected by interference, *even before* a radar signal is fully processed.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// At each WAP node:

// 1. Spectrum Scan & Interference Detection
scan_spectrum()
interference_sources = detect_interference()

// 2. Beamforming Calculation
beamforming_weights = calculate_beamforming_weights(interference_sources)

// 3. Signal Transmission
transmit_signal(beamforming_weights)

// 4. Neighbor Communication (Periodic)
share_interference_data(neighbors)
receive_interference_data(neighbors)
update_interference_map(shared_data)
```

**3. Operational Modes:**

*   **Proactive Interference Cancellation:** System actively cancels interference before it impacts data transmission. This is the primary operating mode.
*   **Fallback to Traditional DFS:** If beamforming performance degrades (e.g., due to antenna failure or excessive interference), the system automatically falls back to traditional DFS mechanisms.
*   **Self-Calibration:**  Periodic self-calibration to maintain beamforming accuracy and compensate for environmental changes.

**4. Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced false radar detections.
*   Increased network capacity and throughput.
*   Improved network reliability and stability.
*   Greater resilience to interference.
*   Potential for operation in more challenging RF environments.
