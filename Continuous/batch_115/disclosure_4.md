## Adaptive Lens Simulation & Predictive Modeling System

**System Overview:** A real-time system that combines captured lens data with ray-tracing simulations to *predict* lens performance under various conditions *before* physical capture. The core innovation is a dynamically updating simulation environment informed by real-world lens tests, creating a "digital twin" of the lens.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **High-Resolution Test Bench:** Automated stage for precisely positioning targets and lenses.
*   **Spectroradiometer:** For accurate measurement of light sources and spectral properties.
*   **High-Speed Data Acquisition:** Captures data from sensors in real-time.
*   **GPU Cluster:** Dedicated for ray-tracing simulations.
*   **Networked Storage:** High-capacity storage for test data and simulation results.

**Software Components:**

*   **Data Ingestion Module:** Processes raw data from the test bench, calibrates sensors, and generates initial lens parameter estimates.
*   **Lens Parameter Optimization:** Employs Bayesian optimization to refine lens parameters (e.g., surface curvatures, refractive indices) based on measured data.
*   **Ray-Tracing Engine:** A physically accurate ray-tracing engine capable of simulating light propagation through complex lens systems.
*   **Simulation Control Module:** Defines simulation scenarios (e.g., different lighting conditions, object distances, wavelengths).
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:** Uses machine learning models (e.g., neural networks) trained on simulation data to predict lens performance metrics (sharpness, chromatic aberration, distortion, falloff) for new scenarios.
*   **Interactive Visualization Interface:** Displays simulation results and predicted performance metrics in an intuitive and interactive manner.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** A lens is placed on the test bench, and a series of images are captured under controlled conditions.
2.  **Parameter Estimation:** The Data Ingestion Module processes the images and estimates initial values for the lens parameters.
3.  **Simulation Calibration:** The Ray-Tracing Engine is used to generate simulated images based on the estimated lens parameters. The simulation parameters are adjusted to match the captured images.
4.  **Predictive Model Training:** The Predictive Modeling Engine is trained on a large dataset of simulation results.
5.  **Performance Prediction:**  For a new scenario (e.g., different lighting, object distance), the Predictive Modeling Engine predicts the lens performance metrics.
6.  **Interactive Visualization:** The Interactive Visualization Interface displays the predicted performance metrics and allows users to explore the lens's behavior under various conditions.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Modeling Engine):**

```python
def predict_performance(lens_id, focal_length, aperture, lighting_conditions, object_distance):
  """
  Predicts lens performance metrics for a given scenario.

  Args:
    lens_id: Unique identifier of the lens.
    focal_length: Focal length setting (mm).
    aperture: Aperture setting (f-stop).
    lighting_conditions: Dictionary describing lighting (e.g., color temperature, intensity).
    object_distance: Distance to the object (m).

  Returns:
    Dictionary containing predicted performance metrics (sharpness, chromatic aberration, distortion, falloff).
  """

  # Load pre-trained machine learning model
  model = load_model(f"models/{lens_id}.h5")

  # Create input vector
  input_vector = [focal_length, aperture, lighting_conditions['color_temperature'], lighting_conditions['intensity'], object_distance]

  # Make prediction
  prediction = model.predict([input_vector])

  # Map prediction to performance metrics
  sharpness = prediction[0][0]
  chromatic_aberration = prediction[0][1]
  distortion = prediction[0][2]
  falloff = prediction[0][3]

  return {
      "sharpness": sharpness,
      "chromatic_aberration": chromatic_aberration,
      "distortion": distortion,
      "falloff": falloff
  }
```

**Novelty:** This system is distinct because it *combines* real-world testing, physically accurate simulation, and machine learning prediction in a closed-loop system.  The constant refinement of the "digital twin" allows for increasingly accurate predictions, even for scenarios that have not been physically tested. It moves beyond simple characterization to predictive performance analysis.
