## Dynamic Shard Assignment based on Consumer Heuristics

**Concept:** Extend the logical queue/physical queue architecture with a dynamic sharding mechanism. Instead of fixed logical queues associated with consumers, allow consumers to *request* shards (subsets of the primary queue) based on content they are interested in *and* their current processing capacity. This shifts from a push-based to a pull-based system, further optimizing resource allocation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shard Definition:** A shard is a contiguous block of messages within the primary queue, identified by a start and end offset.
*   **Consumer Profiles:** Each consumer maintains a profile outlining:
    *   **Content Filters:**  Regular expressions or other criteria defining the messages the consumer is interested in.
    *   **Processing Capacity:** A metric representing the consumer's ability to process messages (e.g., messages/second, CPU utilization). This is dynamically updated.
    *   **Shard Affinity:** A preference for certain shards based on content or proximity to previously held shards.
*   **Shard Manager Component:** A new component responsible for:
    *   **Shard Creation:** Splitting the primary queue into shards based on content characteristics and demand.
    *   **Shard Assignment:** Assigning shards to consumers based on their profiles and current availability.
    *   **Shard Rebalancing:**  Dynamically reassigning shards as consumer capacity changes or new content arrives.
*   **Consumer Request Protocol:** Consumers issue requests to the Shard Manager specifying:
    *   Desired content filters.
    *   Current processing capacity.
    *   Shard affinity (optional).
*   **Acknowledgement Enhancement:** Acknowledgements now include the shard ID, allowing the Shard Manager to track shard ownership and progress.

**Pseudocode (Shard Manager):**

```
function assign_shard(consumer, content_filters, capacity):
  available_shards = find_shards_matching_filters(content_filters)
  
  # Prioritize shards based on:
  # 1. Consumer affinity
  # 2. Load balancing (shard utilization)
  # 3. Capacity match
  best_shard = select_best_shard(available_shards, consumer)
  
  if best_shard != null:
    assign_shard_to_consumer(best_shard, consumer)
    return best_shard
  else:
    return null // No suitable shard found
  
function rebalance_shards():
  for each consumer:
    current_load = calculate_consumer_load(consumer)
    
    if current_load > threshold:
      # Find underutilized shards
      underutilized_shards = find_underutilized_shards()
      
      # Attempt to migrate shards from overloaded consumer
      migrate_shards(overloaded_consumer, underutilized_shards)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Shard`: `{id: int, start_offset: int, end_offset: int, content_type: string, utilization: float}`
*   `ConsumerProfile`: `{id: int, content_filters: list, capacity: float, assigned_shards: list}`

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Resource Utilization:** Consumers only process messages they are interested in, reducing wasted cycles.
*   **Scalability:** The system can adapt to changing workloads by dynamically reassigning shards.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  If a consumer fails, its assigned shards can be quickly reassigned to other consumers.
*   **Content-Aware Routing:** Enables more sophisticated routing strategies based on message content.
