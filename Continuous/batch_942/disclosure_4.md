## Dynamic Forum Weighting & Predictive Thread Creation

**Concept:** Extend the forum association beyond simple tag/category matching to incorporate predictive thread creation *before* a user even initiates a search or posts. This anticipates potential discussion points and proactively establishes forum structures.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time search query streams (anonymized), historical search data, product metadata, trending news feeds (relevant to product categories).
*   **Process:**  Employ an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to predict *future* search terms based on current trends and historical data.  This isn’t simply autocomplete; it's forecasting what users will be *discussing* in the near future. Also employs sentiment analysis on news feeds relevant to product categories.
*   **Output:**  Weighted probability distribution of potential search terms & associated sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).  Example:  `{"term": "electric bike battery life", "probability": 0.75, "sentiment": "negative"}, {"term": "best hiking boots for narrow feet", "probability": 0.60, "sentiment": "neutral"}`.

**2. Dynamic Forum Creation/Weighting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Weighted probability distribution from Data Acquisition Module, existing forum structure (tags, categories, search forums).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Forum Prioritization:** Dynamically adjust the weight (prominence in search results/UI) of existing forums based on predicted search term probability. Higher probability = higher weight.
    *   **Proactive Forum Creation:** If a predicted search term (or a significant variation) *doesn't* have an associated forum (tag, category, or search forum), *automatically* create a new “pre-launch” forum stub. This stub contains:
        *   A forum title generated from the predicted search term.
        *   A placeholder description.
        *   A basic forum structure (e.g., “General Discussion”).
        *   An associated “Sentiment Monitor” (see below).
    *   **Sentiment Monitor:**  Each pre-launch forum will contain a “Sentiment Monitor.” This is a module which tracks real time social media chatter (Twitter, Reddit, etc.) related to the predicted search term. The Sentiment Monitor displays the prevalent sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) within the forum, to allow for quick moderation, and to help direct forum topics.
*   **Output:** Updated forum structure with dynamic weights and potential pre-launch forums.

**3. User Interface Integration:**

*   **Search Results Enhancement:**  Dynamically display prioritized forums alongside search results.  Pre-launch forums are visually distinct (e.g., with a “New Forum” badge).
*   **Forum Suggestion:**  As a user types a search query, suggest relevant forums (weighted by prediction score).
*   **Community Moderation Enhancement:** The Sentiment Monitor data displayed within the forum is utilized to highlight potentially controversial threads, and to assist with pre-emptive moderation.

**Pseudocode (Forum Prioritization):**

```
function prioritizeForums(predictedTerms, existingForums):
  for each term in predictedTerms:
    associatedForum = findForumByTerm(term, existingForums)
    if associatedForum:
      associatedForum.weight += term.probability  // Increase weight
    else:
      // Create a new pre-launch forum (as described above)
      newForum = createPreLaunchForum(term)
      existingForums.append(newForum)

  // Sort existingForums by weight (descending)
  sortForumsByWeight(existingForums)
  return existingForums
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond *reacting* to search queries to *anticipating* them, creating a more proactive and engaging community experience. The Sentiment Monitor adds an extra layer of data to help foster a healthy and productive community. This can generate engagement *before* a user even asks a question.
