## Dynamic Data Granularity for Recalibration

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *when* to recalibrate. This design explores *what data* is used during recalibration, dynamically adjusting granularity based on observed model performance and data volatility. Instead of using the entire first dataset or fixed subsets, the system will identify 'critical' data points and focus recalibration efforts on those.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Segmentation Module:** This module analyzes the incoming time series data (historical and new) and segments it into variable-length chunks. Segmentation is based on a rolling volatility metric (e.g., exponentially weighted moving average of absolute differences). High volatility segments are shorter, low volatility segments are longer.
*   **Critical Point Identifier:** Within each segment, this module identifies ‘critical points’ – data points with significant influence on model output. This can be determined using techniques like:
    *   **Shapley Values:** Calculate the contribution of each data point to the model's prediction.
    *   **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation:** Measure the change in model performance when each data point is removed.
    *   **Influence Functions:** Estimate how a small change in a data point affects the model parameters.
*   **Recalibration Dataset Builder:** Based on identified critical points, construct a recalibration dataset. The dataset will prioritize critical points, potentially oversampling them to increase their influence. This allows for more focused recalibration.
*   **Hyperparameter Optimization Strategy:** Implement a hyperparameter optimization strategy that is *aware* of the recalibration dataset. The optimization algorithm should prioritize hyperparameters that minimize error on the critical points.
*   **Dynamic Granularity Adjustment:** Monitor model performance *after* recalibration. If performance deteriorates, *reduce* the segment length (increase granularity) to identify more critical points and recalibrate with a more refined dataset. Conversely, if performance improves, *increase* segment length to reduce computational cost.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function recalibrate_model(model, historical_data, new_data, volatility_threshold):
    # 1. Data Segmentation
    segments = segment_data(new_data, volatility_threshold)

    # 2. Identify Critical Points within each segment
    critical_points = []
    for segment in segments:
        critical_points.extend(identify_critical_points(model, segment))

    # 3. Build Recalibration Dataset
    recalibration_dataset = build_dataset(historical_data, critical_points)

    # 4. Optimize Hyperparameters
    optimized_hyperparameters = optimize_hyperparameters(model, recalibration_dataset)

    # 5. Update Model
    update_model(model, optimized_hyperparameters)

    return model
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for Shapley value calculations or influence function estimation.
*   High-speed data storage for efficient access to historical and new data.
*   Distributed computing framework for parallelizing critical point identification and hyperparameter optimization.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced recalibration time and computational cost.
*   Improved model accuracy and robustness.
*   Adaptability to changing data patterns and volatility.
*   More efficient use of computing resources.
