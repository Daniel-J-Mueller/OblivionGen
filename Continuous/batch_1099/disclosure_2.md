## Hypervisor Memory Attestation via Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)

**Specification:** System for verifying hypervisor integrity using a physically unclonable function (PUF) embedded within the processor, alongside bus snooping.

**Problem:** The patent describes detecting malicious access *during* execution. This design aims to *attest* to the hypervisor's integrity *before* and *during* runtime, preventing compromised hypervisors from even beginning operation, and providing continuous validation.

**Components:**

*   **PUF Module:** Integrated into the processor(s) hosting the hypervisor. This module generates a unique, unpredictable “fingerprint” based on inherent manufacturing variations. This fingerprint is *never* stored; it is generated on demand.
*   **Attestation Agent:** Software running *outside* of the hypervisor’s control – potentially within the baseboard management controller (BMC) or a dedicated security chip. This agent initiates the attestation process.
*   **Challenge Generator:**  Part of the Attestation Agent. Generates random challenges.
*   **Response Evaluator:** Part of the Attestation Agent.  Stores a pre-calculated “golden” response for each possible challenge, based on the known-good hypervisor.
*   **Bus Snooper:** Existing component from the described patent.  Monitors bus traffic.
*   **Secure Communication Channel:** Establishes a trusted connection between the Attestation Agent and a remote trusted authority (e.g., a cloud security service).

**Operation:**

1.  **Boot-Time Attestation:**
    *   Attestation Agent powers on and generates a random challenge.
    *   The challenge is transmitted to the processor.
    *   The processor’s PUF module generates a response based on the challenge and the current state of the hypervisor code in memory. Crucially, this response is computed *before* the hypervisor gains full control.
    *   The response is transmitted back to the Attestation Agent.
    *   The Attestation Agent compares the received response to the expected “golden” response. If they match, the hypervisor is considered authentic. If not, the system halts.

2.  **Runtime Attestation (Continuous Monitoring):**
    *   At regular intervals (or triggered by specific events, such as configuration changes), the Attestation Agent generates a new challenge.
    *   The PUF module generates a response based on the *current* state of the hypervisor code in memory.
    *   The Attestation Agent compares this response to the expected response based on the known-good hypervisor and a continuously updated checksum of the hypervisor memory.
    *   **Bus Snooping Integration:** The bus snooper monitors memory access patterns. If the bus snooper detects attempts to modify critical hypervisor code, it triggers an *immediate* runtime attestation request.  This creates a two-factor authentication system: bus snooping flags potential tampering, and PUF-based attestation confirms/denies it.
    *   If the attestation fails, the system initiates pre-defined actions: halting the system, triggering a memory dump for forensic analysis, or isolating the compromised virtual machine(s).

**Pseudocode (Attestation Agent - Runtime Attestation):**

```
function perform_runtime_attestation() {
  challenge = generate_random_challenge();
  response = processor.puf.generate_response(challenge);
  expected_response = calculate_expected_response(challenge, hypervisor_checksum);

  if (response != expected_response) {
      log("Attestation Failed!");
      // Trigger action (halt, dump, isolate)
      trigger_security_action();
  } else {
      log("Attestation Passed!");
  }
}

function trigger_security_action() {
  //Check Bus Snoop flag for tamper attempts
  if (bus_snoop.tamper_detected)
  {
    halt_system();
  }
  else
  {
    isolate_vm();
  }
}
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   **PUF Protection:** The PUF module itself must be protected against physical attacks and side-channel attacks.
*   **Challenge/Response Integrity:** The communication channel between the Attestation Agent and the PUF module must be secure.
*   **Golden Response Management:** The “golden” response must be stored securely and protected against modification.
*   **Side Channel Attacks:** Design must account for side-channel attacks against the PUF module.
