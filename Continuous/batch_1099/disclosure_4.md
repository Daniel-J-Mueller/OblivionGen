## Dynamic Metric Synthesis & Predictive Anomaly Thresholding

**Concept:** Leverage the existing anomaly detection framework to *proactively generate* synthetic metrics based on combinations of existing metrics, then predict anomaly thresholds *before* data is collected, allowing for highly targeted and sensitive anomaly detection.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on selecting *existing* metrics for anomaly detection. This expands that to intelligently *creating* new, potentially more informative metrics *and* dynamically adjusting sensitivity based on anticipated system behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Synthetic Metric Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Metrics metadata (name, statistic type, existing correlations - derived from historical data), Application profile (description of application functionality & expected resource usage).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Analyze historical metric data to identify statistically significant correlations between existing metrics.
    *   **Combination Logic:** Based on application profile and correlations, generate combination rules. Examples:
        *   `CPU_Usage * Memory_Usage` (Represents combined resource strain)
        *   `Request_Latency / Requests_Per_Second` (Represents latency per request)
        *   `Error_Rate * Request_Volume` (Represents the magnitude of errors)
    *   **Synthetic Metric Definition:** Create metadata definitions for each synthetic metric, including name, statistic type, and generation formula.
*   **Output:** A library of dynamically generated synthetic metric definitions.

**2. Predictive Anomaly Thresholding Module:**

*   **Input:** Synthetic Metric Definitions, Application Profile, Historical Data (for similar applications or system states), Time-Series Forecasting Models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Baseline Prediction:** Using time-series forecasting, predict the expected values of the synthetic metric *before* data collection begins.
    *   **Dynamic Threshold Calculation:**  Calculate anomaly thresholds based on predicted values, standard deviations (calculated from historical data), and a sensitivity factor (adjustable by administrators).  Consider multiple thresholds (warning, critical)
    *   **Threshold Propagation:** Assign calculated thresholds to the relevant synthetic metrics.
*   **Output:** A dynamic map of anomaly thresholds for each synthetic metric.

**3. Integration with Existing Framework:**

*   The Synthetic Metric Generation & Predictive Anomaly Thresholding Modules should seamlessly integrate with the existing "anomaly detection relevance score" framework.
*   The “anomaly detection relevance score” should incorporate a factor representing the "predictive power" of the synthetic metric (e.g., how well the predicted values align with actual values).
*   The collected statistics of the synthetic metrics should be used in the existing anomaly detection pipelines.

**Pseudocode – Synthetic Metric Generation (Simplified):**

```
function generate_synthetic_metrics(application_profile, historical_data):
  correlations = analyze_correlations(historical_data)
  synthetic_metrics = []
  for metric1, metric2 in correlations:
    if correlation_strength > threshold:
      #Create new metric 'combined_metric'
      combined_metric = {
          "name": "Combined_" + metric1 + "_" + metric2,
          "statistic_type": "average",  //Or other appropriate type
          "generation_formula": "(" + metric1 + " * " + metric2 + ")",
          "relevance_score": calculate_relevance(metric1, metric2)
      }
      synthetic_metrics.append(combined_metric)
  return synthetic_metrics
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `MetricMetadata`: {`name`: string, `statistic_type`: string, `generation_formula`: string, `relevance_score`: float}
*   `ApplicationProfile`: {`name`: string, `description`: string, `expected_resource_usage`: dict}

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Anomaly Detection Accuracy:** Synthetic metrics can expose hidden relationships and subtle anomalies not apparent in individual metrics.
*   **Proactive Anomaly Detection:** Predicting thresholds allows for early detection of potential issues before they escalate.
*   **Reduced False Positives:** Dynamic thresholds adjust to expected system behavior, reducing false alarms.
*   **Automated Metric Creation:** Reduces the need for manual metric definition and tuning.
