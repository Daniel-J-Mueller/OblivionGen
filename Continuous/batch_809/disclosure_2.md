**Dynamic Content Reconstruction via Multi-Frequency Spatial Mapping**

**Concept:** Extend the single-plane zoom/tilt interaction to reconstruct 3D content dynamically based on device movement and multi-frequency spatial mapping. This goes beyond simply zooming in/out on a 2D image/representation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): High-precision accelerometer and gyroscope.
    *   Time-of-Flight (ToF) Camera: For real-time depth sensing of the environment *and* the content being viewed.  (Critical – not just object detection, but precise distance to points on the content).
    *   RGB Camera: Standard color capture.
    *   Optional: Structured Light Emitter (for improved ToF accuracy in low-light).

2.  **Spatial Mapping Algorithm:**
    *   Real-time creation of a point cloud representing the viewed content *and* the surrounding environment.
    *   Multi-frequency analysis of point cloud data.  Higher frequencies capture fine detail, lower frequencies capture larger form factors.
    *   Algorithm must dynamically prioritize point cloud resolution based on device movement/user interaction. (Fast movement = lower detail, slower movement = higher detail).
    *   Integration of RGB data to colorize the point cloud.

3.  **Device Movement Interpretation:**
    *   Algorithm interprets device tilt, rotation, and translation (movement in 3D space) as commands for content manipulation.
    *   Forward tilt: Rotates the point cloud representation of the content towards the user, giving the impression of "reaching into" the content.  Scale adjusts automatically based on tilt angle and distance to the content.
    *   Backward tilt: Rotates the content away from the user.
    *   Side-to-side rotation:  Rotates the content around a central axis.
    *   Vertical translation: Moves the content up or down in 3D space.

4.  **Content Reconstruction:**
    *   Based on device movement and the spatial map, the system dynamically reconstructs the content as a 3D point cloud.
    *   Algorithm employs advanced surface reconstruction techniques (e.g., Poisson surface reconstruction) to create a smooth, visually appealing 3D model from the point cloud.
    *   Texture mapping is applied to the 3D model to add visual detail.

5.  **Dynamic Resolution Scaling:**
    *   Algorithm adjusts the level of detail (LOD) of the 3D model based on device movement and processing power.
    *   Faster movement = lower LOD (fewer polygons) to maintain a smooth framerate.
    *   Slower movement = higher LOD (more polygons) for increased visual fidelity.

6.  **User Interface:**
    *   Minimalist UI. No visible controls. All interaction is based on natural device movement.
    *   Haptic feedback to provide subtle cues to the user about the content’s position and orientation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
Create Spatial Map
Load Content (initial 2D image/data)

// Main Loop
while (device is active) {
    Get Device Movement Data (IMU)
    Get Depth Data (ToF Camera)
    Update Spatial Map (combine movement & depth)

    Calculate Content Transformation (based on movement)
    Reconstruct Content (3D model from Spatial Map & Transformation)

    Adjust Level of Detail (based on movement speed & processing power)

    Render 3D Content
    Provide Haptic Feedback
}
```

**Example Use Cases:**

*   Viewing architectural models in a truly immersive way.
*   Examining medical scans (CT, MRI) with the ability to "reach into" the anatomy.
*   Interactive product demonstrations (rotating, zooming, and manipulating a 3D model of a product).
*   Enhanced gaming and virtual reality experiences.
