## Adaptive Lease Granularity for Data Replication

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on a relatively coarse-grained lease for the master node role. This design proposes dynamically adjusting the lease granularity *within* the data replication group, assigning leases not to a single master, but to *shards* of data.

**Rationale:** A single master lease creates a bottleneck and single point of failure, even with fast failover.  If different shards are infrequently accessed, tying their consistency management to a single master’s lease cycle is inefficient.  This approach optimizes for read/write locality and reduces contention.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shard Definition:**

*   The data replication group is divided into 'shards'. Shard size can be static or dynamically adjusted based on access patterns (monitored by a separate service).
*   Each shard maintains a separate lease.

**2. Lease Manager Service:**

*   A dedicated 'Lease Manager' service is responsible for:
    *   Monitoring shard access patterns (read/write frequency, latency).
    *   Assigning leases to nodes for specific shards.
    *   Renewing/revoking leases.
    *   Handling lease conflicts (described below).

**3. Lease Assignment Algorithm:**

*   **Initial Assignment:** When a shard is created, the Lease Manager assigns a lease to a node based on proximity (network latency) and current load.
*   **Dynamic Re-assignment:**
    *   If a node consistently fails to renew its lease (due to network issues or node failure), the Lease Manager automatically reassigns the lease to another node.
    *   If a shard experiences a surge in read/write activity, the Lease Manager may *migrate* the lease to a node with more resources. Migration is triggered by exceeding pre-defined performance thresholds.
    *   Nodes can *bid* for leases based on available resources and estimated performance gain (a scoring system is needed).

**4. Lease Conflict Resolution:**

*   Conflicts arise when two nodes believe they hold the lease for the same shard (due to network partitions or message loss).
*   A lightweight consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft or a simplified version) is used to resolve conflicts. The algorithm ensures that only one node holds the valid lease.  This consensus is *local* to the shard – it doesn’t require group-wide consensus for every operation.

**5. Heartbeat and Lease Renewal:**

*   Each node holding a lease sends heartbeat messages to the Lease Manager, indicating that it is still alive and able to serve requests for its shard.
*   The Lease Manager renews leases based on successful heartbeats.

**Pseudocode (Lease Manager):**

```
// Data structures
ShardMetadata: {
  shardID: INT,
  currentLeaseHolder: NodeID,
  leaseExpirationTime: TIMESTAMP,
  accessStats: { reads: INT, writes: INT }
}

// Main loop
FOR EACH shard IN shards:
  IF shard.leaseExpirationTime < NOW:
    IF nodeIsAlive(shard.currentLeaseHolder):
      renewLease(shard)
    ELSE:
      // Lease expired, trigger re-assignment
      findNewLeaseHolder(shard)

  // Monitor shard access
  updateAccessStats(shard)

  // Check if shard needs to be migrated
  IF accessStatsExceedThreshold(shard):
      migrateLease(shard)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Lease Splitting:**  A single shard could be further divided, with different nodes responsible for different segments of data.
*   **Multi-Lease Approach:**  Allow multiple nodes to hold leases for the same shard, providing redundancy and load balancing (requires careful conflict resolution).
*   **Predictive Lease Management:** Use machine learning to predict access patterns and proactively assign leases to optimize performance.
