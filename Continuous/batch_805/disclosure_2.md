## Modular Haptic Feedback Array for Deployable Accessory

**Concept:** Expand the accessory functionality beyond visual/auditory to include localized haptic feedback, creating a more immersive and intuitive user experience. The deployable arm will house a configurable array of micro-actuators capable of delivering distinct tactile sensations.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Dimensions:** 6x6 matrix of micro-actuators. Each actuator is approximately 3mm x 3mm x 1mm.
*   **Actuator Type:** Piezoelectric benders. Chosen for low power consumption, fast response time, and ability to generate a range of vibration frequencies and amplitudes.
*   **Deployment Mechanism:** Integrated into the deployable arm structure. The haptic array will be a thin, flexible sheet molded to the arm’s curvature.
*   **Power:** Derived from the ebook reader via the existing cover/arm power connection. Target consumption: <50mA at peak operation.
*   **Communication:** Uses the existing identifier communication pathway to signal the ebook reader about the attached accessory & haptic profiles.
*   **Software Interface:** SDK for developers to create haptic profiles tied to ebook content, app interactions, or sensor data. 
*   **Mounting:** Modular accessory “capsules” with magnetic attachment to the haptic array. Each capsule contains a unique haptic profile & potentially additional sensor input (pressure, temperature, etc.).

**Operation:**

1.  The ebook reader recognizes the haptic array accessory via the identifier.
2.  The user can select pre-defined haptic profiles (e.g., “page turn,” “notification,” “game control”).
3.  The ebook reader sends control signals to the haptic array via the deployable arm.
4.  Individual actuators in the array vibrate according to the selected profile, delivering localized tactile feedback to the user’s hand or fingers.
5.  Accessories are added to the haptic array. Each accessory activates a different haptic profile depending on the accessory.
6.  The system can also utilize sensor data (e.g., ambient light, accelerometer) to dynamically adjust haptic feedback.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Ebook Reader Side
function accessoryDetected(accessoryID) {
    if (accessoryID == "HapticArray") {
        enableHapticControl();
    }
}

function applyHapticProfile(profileName) {
    sendHapticCommand(profileName);
}

//Haptic Array Side
function receiveHapticCommand(command) {
    //Parse command to determine which actuators to activate & intensity.
    //Control piezoelectric actuators accordingly.
}

//Accessory Side
function signalAccessoryProfile() {
    sendAccessoryID();
}

//Accessory Function: Page Turn Button
function activatePageTurnHaptic() {
    sendHapticCommand("pageTurn");
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced ebook reading: Realistic page turns, subtle notifications.
*   Mobile gaming: Immersive controller feedback.
*   Accessibility: Tactile cues for visually impaired users.
*   Augmented reality: Tactile representation of virtual objects.
*   Biometric feedback: Pulse detection and haptic feedback to control device.
