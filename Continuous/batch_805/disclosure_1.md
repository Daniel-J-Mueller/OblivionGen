## Dynamic Frame Prediction & Pre-Fetch via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Leverage real-time biofeedback (heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, EEG) from the user to *predict* which frames of a video stream will be most visually salient *before* they are rendered, and proactively pre-fetch/decode those frames. This goes beyond simple buffering – it anticipates cognitive load and visual attention, optimizing the viewing experience and minimizing perceived latency.

**Specs:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor Integration:** Compatible with standard wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers, EEG headsets). Open API for integration with novel sensors. Raw data streaming to client-side processing module.
*   **Client-Side Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Data Preprocessing:** Noise filtering, artifact removal, baseline correction of biofeedback signals.
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Calculation of relevant features from biofeedback signals (HRV, GSR peak amplitude, EEG alpha/beta band power).
    *   **Attention Model:** Machine learning model (RNN, LSTM) trained to predict visual attention based on biofeedback features *and* video content features (scene changes, object detection, motion vectors).  Model output is a probability map indicating frame salience.
    *   **Frame Prioritization:** Prioritized frame queue based on salience scores.  Highest priority frames are pre-fetched.
*   **Adaptive Pre-Fetch:**
    *   **Pre-Fetch Depth:** Dynamically adjust number of pre-fetched frames based on bandwidth, processing power, and attention prediction confidence.
    *   **Bandwidth Awareness:** Adapt pre-fetch rate to avoid network congestion. Prioritize keyframes and I-frames.
    *   **Buffering Management:** Intelligent buffer allocation – allocate more buffer space to high-priority frames.
*   **Server-Side Support:**
    *   **Metadata Augmentation:** Video files enriched with metadata describing visual features (scene boundaries, object types, motion vectors).
    *   **Frame Availability:** Server must be capable of providing individual frames on demand, not just streaming the entire video.
*   **API:**
    *   `requestFrame(frameID, priority)`: Request specific frame with given priority.
    *   `setBiofeedbackData(data)`: Submit biofeedback data from client.
    *   `getFrameAvailability(frameID)`: Check if frame is available on server.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
biofeedbackSensor = new BiofeedbackSensor();
attentionModel = new AttentionModel();
frameQueue = new PriorityQueue();

// Main Loop
while (streaming) {
    biofeedbackData = biofeedbackSensor.readData();
    attentionScores = attentionModel.predict(biofeedbackData, currentFrameData);

    for (frame in upcomingFrames) {
        priority = attentionScores[frame];
        frameQueue.add(frame, priority);
    }

    if (frameQueue.isEmpty()) continue;

    nextFrame = frameQueue.peek();

    if (!frameAvailable(nextFrame)) {
        requestFrame(nextFrame, frameQueue.priority);
    }

    decodedFrame = decodeFrame(nextFrame);
    displayFrame(decodedFrame);
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Models:** Train attention models on individual user data for improved accuracy.
*   **Multi-User Sync:** Synchronize attention prediction across multiple viewers (e.g., during virtual events).
*   **Predictive Rendering:** Pre-render keyframes in the background based on attention prediction.
*   **Integration with VR/AR:** Enhance immersive experiences by proactively loading relevant visual content.
