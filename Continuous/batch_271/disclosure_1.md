## Personalized Command Orchestration via Biofeedback

**System Overview:** A system integrating personalized command functionality (as in patent 8732075) with real-time biofeedback monitoring to create context-aware and dynamically adjusting command execution. This moves beyond simple personalized *text* commands to commands influenced by a user’s physiological state.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Biofeedback Sensor Suite:**  Integrated sensors (EEG, GSR/EDA, heart rate variability (HRV), potentially facial muscle activity) to capture real-time physiological data.  Data is pre-processed (noise reduction, artifact removal) and fed into the ‘State Analyzer’.
2.  **State Analyzer:** A machine learning module that maps biofeedback data to a ‘cognitive/emotional state profile’.  This profile includes dimensions like ‘focus level’, ‘stress level’, ‘cognitive load’, ‘emotional valence’ (positive/negative), and ‘arousal’.  The model must be trained on user-specific data for personalization, but can leverage transfer learning from generalized biofeedback datasets.
3.  **Dynamic Command Mapping:** An extension of the existing mapping functionality. The mapping now includes state-dependent command modifiers.  A command’s action can be adjusted *based* on the current state profile.  For example:
    *   A command like “Pay Bill” might automatically trigger a confirmation screen if the user’s stress level is high, or proceed directly if stress is low.
    *   A command “Send Message” could adjust message sentiment analysis & suggest phrasing alterations if the user is exhibiting low emotional valence.
    *   A ‘focus level’ above a threshold might enable ‘express mode’ commands – bypassing confirmations or detailed prompts.
4.  **Command Prioritization Engine:** A module that dynamically adjusts command priority based on biofeedback. Commands perceived as potentially stressful or requiring high cognitive load are temporarily deprioritized or presented with additional safeguards.
5.  **User Interface (UI):**
    *   Visual representation of current state profile (optional, user configurable).
    *   Controls for calibrating biofeedback sensors and adjusting state-dependent command modifiers.
    *   Feedback mechanism indicating how biofeedback is influencing command execution.

**Pseudocode (State-Dependent Command Execution):**

```
function executeCommand(commandText, userProfile):
  currentState = getUserState(userProfile.biofeedBackData)
  mappedAction = getMappedAction(commandText, userProfile.mappingInfo)

  if currentState.stressLevel > threshold:
    action = mappedAction.safeModeAction() //trigger additional verification
  else:
    action = mappedAction.standardAction()

  if currentState.focusLevel > threshold:
    action = mappedAction.expressModeAction() //Bypass prompts

  if currentState.cognitiveLoad > threshold:
    delayExecution(action, delayTime) //Queue for later

  performAction(action)
```

**Data Storage:**

*   User-specific biofeedback calibration data.
*   State-dependent command modifiers (mapping information).
*   Historical biofeedback and command execution logs for model training and optimization.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Adaptive Financial Management:** Automatically adjusting transaction safeguards based on user stress levels.
*   **Context-Aware Communication:**  Filtering or rephrasing messages based on user emotional state.
*   **Personalized Productivity Tools:**  Prioritizing tasks and streamlining workflows based on user focus levels.
*   **Healthcare Applications:**  Providing personalized interventions based on real-time physiological data.
