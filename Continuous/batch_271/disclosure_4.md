## Dynamic Content Reconstruction for Viewability

**Concept:** The patent focuses on *detecting* viewability. This design aims to *ensure* viewability by dynamically reconstructing content based on real-time user attention data. Instead of just logging if something *was* viewable, the system actively modulates the content itself to maximize the probability of it being viewed.

**System Specs:**

*   **Attention Input:** Integrate with eye-tracking hardware (built-in laptop cameras, external devices) *and* mouse/touchpad movement analysis. Combine both to generate an ‘Attention Map’ – a heatmap representing the user's focus on the screen in real-time. The system *must* be able to operate with reduced precision – estimated attention – when dedicated hardware isn’t available.
*   **Content Segmentation:** Divide web pages/ads into modular content blocks (text, images, video). These blocks *must* be tagged with metadata detailing their importance (e.g., key selling points, crucial information).
*   **Dynamic Prioritization Engine:** This is the core. The engine analyzes the Attention Map and dynamically prioritizes content blocks for display.
    *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  *Attention Overlap:* Calculate the overlap between each content block’s area and the current Attention Map peak.
        2.  *Importance Weighting:* Multiply the overlap score by the content block’s importance weighting.
        3.  *Prioritization Score:* Sort content blocks based on their prioritization score.
        4.  *Display Adjustment:* Adjust the display order, size, or opacity of content blocks based on the prioritization score. Blocks with high scores are prominently displayed; low scores are minimized or delayed.
*   **Rendering Module:** Modified browser extension or JavaScript library.  The rendering module receives prioritization data from the Dynamic Prioritization Engine and modifies the DOM in real-time to adjust content display.  Supports:
    *   *Content Reordering:* Shifting the position of blocks within the layout.
    *   *Dynamic Resizing:* Scaling block sizes based on prioritization.
    *   *Opacity Control:* Adjusting the transparency of less prioritized content.
    *   *Progressive Loading:* Delaying the loading of low-priority content until the user’s attention shifts.
*   **Learning Module:** Reinforcement learning algorithm trained to optimize prioritization strategies.  The system monitors user engagement metrics (time spent viewing prioritized content, click-through rates) and adjusts the prioritization algorithm to maximize engagement.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Prioritization Engine):**

```
function prioritizeContent(attentionMap, contentBlocks) {
  for (block in contentBlocks) {
    overlapScore = calculateOverlap(attentionMap, block.area);
    priorityScore = overlapScore * block.importance;
    block.priority = priorityScore;
  }

  // Sort content blocks by priority (descending)
  contentBlocks.sort(function(a, b) {
    return b.priority - a.priority;
  });

  return contentBlocks;
}

function calculateOverlap(attentionMap, area) {
  // Calculate the intersection area between attentionMap and area
  // (Use appropriate image processing techniques for overlap calculation)
  // Return a score representing the overlap percentage
  // (e.g., intersection area / area of attentionMap)
  return overlapScore;
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond *detecting* viewability to *actively influencing* it.  It creates a feedback loop where content dynamically adjusts to capture user attention. It combines attention data with content importance to deliver a personalized and engaging experience, exceeding traditional viewability metrics.
