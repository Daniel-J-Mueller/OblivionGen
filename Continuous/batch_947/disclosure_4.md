## Dynamic Policy Inheritance with Temporal Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic group creation to incorporate a temporal dimension and policy inheritance. Instead of simply consolidating permissions at login, proactively predict future access needs based on user behavior and schedule policy adjustments *before* access is attempted.  This is geared towards scenarios with long-lived access requirements and potential shifts in roles/responsibilities.

**Specification:**

**1. Behavioral Profiling Module:**

*   **Input:** User login data, resource access logs (timestamps, resources accessed, actions performed), Active Directory group memberships, scheduled events (e.g., project start/end dates, promotion dates).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze historical access patterns to identify recurring resource needs.
    *   Correlate access patterns with scheduled events.  (Example:  A user regularly accesses ‘Project Alpha’ resources. Project Alpha is scheduled to end in 30 days. Predict decreasing access need over that timeframe).
    *   Develop a ‘future access profile’ indicating probability of accessing specific resources within defined time windows.
*   **Output:**  Time-series data representing predicted resource access probability for each user.

**2. Dynamic Policy Scheduler:**

*   **Input:** User ID, Future Access Profile, Current Active Directory Groups, Existing Dynamic Group Policies.
*   **Process:**
    *   Determine if a dynamic group exists for the user.
    *   If no group exists, create a new dynamic group with initial policies based on current AD groups.
    *   If a group exists:
        *   Compare predicted future access profile to existing policies.
        *   Identify discrepancies (resources likely to be accessed but not currently authorized, or resources likely *not* to be accessed but still authorized).
        *   Schedule policy updates to dynamically adjust group permissions.  (Example: Add ‘Resource X’ to group permissions 7 days before predicted access, remove ‘Resource Y’ 30 days after predicted access ceases).
        *   Utilize a policy weighting system.  Policies predicted with high confidence receive higher priority.
*   **Output:** Schedule of policy changes for the user's dynamic group.

**3.  Policy Inheritance Layer:**

*   **Concept:** Enable ‘inheritance’ of policies from parent groups or projects. If a user is assigned to a project, they automatically inherit relevant policies assigned to the project *in addition* to their individual dynamic group policies.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Define project/group ‘policy templates’ containing pre-defined access rules.
    *   Associate users with projects/groups.
    *   Dynamically merge project/group policies with the user’s dynamic group policies.  (Higher priority given to explicitly assigned dynamic group policies, but inheritance provides a baseline).

**Pseudocode (Policy Scheduler):**

```
function SchedulePolicyUpdates(userID, futureAccessProfile, currentGroups, existingGroup) {

  if (existingGroup == null) {
    existingGroup = CreateDynamicGroup(userID)
    ApplyInitialPolicies(existingGroup, currentGroups)
  }

  for (resource in futureAccessProfile) {
    predictedAccessProbability = futureAccessProfile[resource]

    if (predictedAccessProbability > threshold) {
      if (!ResourceIsAuthorized(existingGroup, resource)) {
        SchedulePolicyChange(existingGroup, resource, "add", futureAccessTime)
      }
    } else {
      if (ResourceIsAuthorized(existingGroup, resource)) {
        SchedulePolicyChange(existingGroup, resource, "remove", futureAccessTime)
      }
    }
  }

}
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   Scalability: The behavioral profiling module must handle large numbers of users and resources efficiently.
*   Accuracy: The predictive model must be robust and minimize false positives/negatives.
*   Real-time Integration: Policy changes must be applied in near real-time to avoid access delays.
*   Auditing: Comprehensive logging of all policy changes is crucial for compliance and security.
