## Secure Peripheral Attestation & Dynamic Root of Trust Provisioning

**System Overview:** A hardware/software system extending the Security Service Hardware Processor (SSHP) concept to proactively assess the security posture of *all* peripherals, even those connected post-boot, and dynamically establish a secure root of trust for newly connected devices.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on verifying firmware *before* or *during* installation. This design targets post-installation validation and continuous monitoring, addressing threats from compromised or malicious peripherals introduced *after* system initialization. It also addresses the difficulty of pre-provisioning root of trust keys for all possible future peripherals.

**Core Components:**

*   **Enhanced SSHP:**  The existing SSHP is extended with a dedicated “Peripheral Attestation Engine” (PAE).
*   **Peripheral Security Module (PSM):** A small, low-cost, optional module that can be integrated into peripherals. PSMs contain a minimal cryptographic engine, a unique device ID, and a small, read-only secure storage area. If a peripheral lacks a PSM, the system relies on a more limited set of attestation checks.
*   **Remote Attestation Server (RAS):** A cloud-based service that maintains a database of known-good peripheral configurations and cryptographic keys.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Peripheral Enumeration:** Upon detection of a new or re-connected peripheral, the SSHP/PAE initiates the attestation process.
2.  **PSM Presence Check:**  The SSHP detects if the peripheral has a PSM.
3.  **Attestation Phase (PSM Present):**
    *   The SSHP requests a signed challenge from the RAS, specific to the peripheral’s device ID.
    *   The PSM generates a unique response using its private key and the challenge.
    *   The SSHP sends the response to the RAS for verification.
    *   If verification succeeds, the RAS provides a symmetric encryption key to the SSHP for secure communication with the peripheral.
4.  **Attestation Phase (PSM Absent):**
    *   The SSHP performs a series of basic checks: Known vulnerability scans, firmware signature validation (if present), and hardware fingerprinting.
    *   A lower level of trust is established. Communication is limited and heavily monitored.
5.  **Dynamic Root of Trust Provisioning:**
    *   If a peripheral passes attestation, the SSHP can dynamically provision a root of trust. This involves generating a unique key pair, securely storing the private key within the SSHP, and sharing the public key with the peripheral.
    *   This allows for future secure communication and firmware updates without relying on pre-provisioned keys.
6.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The SSHP periodically re-attests peripherals and monitors communication for anomalies.

**Pseudocode (PAE Attestation Flow):**

```pseudocode
function attestPeripheral(peripheralID) {
  hasPSM = detectPSM(peripheralID)

  if (hasPSM) {
    challenge = requestChallengeFromRAS(peripheralID)
    response = receiveResponseFromPeripheral(peripheralID, challenge)
    verificationResult = verifyResponseWithRAS(peripheralID, response)

    if (verificationResult == SUCCESS) {
      encryptionKey = receiveEncryptionKeyFromRAS(peripheralID)
      establishSecureCommunication(peripheralID, encryptionKey)
      return SUCCESS
    } else {
      logAttestationFailure(peripheralID)
      isolatePeripheral(peripheralID)
      return FAILURE
    }
  } else {
    // Perform basic checks (signature validation, vulnerability scans)
    basicCheckResult = performBasicChecks(peripheralID)

    if (basicCheckResult == SUCCESS) {
      establishLimitedCommunication(peripheralID)
      return SUCCESS
    } else {
      logAttestationFailure(peripheralID)
      isolatePeripheral(peripheralID)
      return FAILURE
    }
  }
}
```
