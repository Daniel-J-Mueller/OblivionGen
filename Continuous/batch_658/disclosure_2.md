## Dynamic Dependency Inference & Predictive Diagramming

**Concept:** Extend the automatic architecture diagram generation to *predict* potential dependencies and visualize them as probabilistic connections, dynamically adjusting the diagram based on observed system behavior and proactively highlighting areas of potential instability or bottlenecks.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Profiling Module:**

*   **Input:** System specification (resources, existing dependencies, metadata tags). Real-time system telemetry data (CPU usage, network I/O, memory allocation, API call frequency, error rates) from each resource.
*   **Process:**  Establish baseline performance metrics for each resource and existing dependency. Employ statistical analysis (correlation, regression) to identify potential, unstated dependencies based on correlated behavior.  For example, if resource A consistently experiences increased CPU usage *before* resource B experiences increased network I/O, infer a potential dependency.
*   **Output:** A “Dependency Probability Map” – a data structure storing the probability of a dependency existing between any two resources, based on the observed telemetry.

**2. Predictive Diagram Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Dependency Probability Map, System Specification.  User-defined probability threshold (e.g., display dependencies with >50% probability).
*   **Process:**  Generate the architecture diagram. Display existing dependencies as solid lines. Display *potential* dependencies (above the threshold) as dashed or dotted lines, with line thickness or color representing the probability. Implement a visual 'heat map' overlay on the diagram, showing areas of high potential dependency density.
*   **Output:**  A dynamic architecture diagram displaying both established and *predicted* dependencies.

**3. Dynamic Adjustment & Anomaly Detection Module:**

*   **Input:**  Real-time system telemetry data. Current architecture diagram. Dependency Probability Map.
*   **Process:** Continuously monitor telemetry data.  If a predicted dependency begins to exhibit correlated behavior exceeding a defined threshold, *increase* the visual prominence of that connection on the diagram (e.g., change the dashed line to solid). If an *existing* dependency deviates significantly from its baseline behavior, *highlight* that connection on the diagram to indicate a potential issue. Implement an "Anomaly Score" for each dependency, based on the deviation from its baseline.
*   **Output:**  A continuously updated architecture diagram reflecting the *current* state of the system and highlighting potential issues or emerging dependencies.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Adjustment Module):**

```
function updateDiagram(telemetryData, currentDiagram, dependencyMap):
  for each dependency in dependencyMap:
    baselineBehavior = getBaseline(dependency)
    currentBehavior = getTelemetry(dependency, telemetryData)
    anomalyScore = calculateAnomaly(baselineBehavior, currentBehavior)

    if anomalyScore > threshold:
      highlightDependency(currentDiagram, dependency) # Visually indicate issue

    # Check for emerging dependencies (new correlations in telemetry)
    if correlationDetected(telemetryData, dependency) > probabilityThreshold:
      addDependencyToDiagram(currentDiagram, dependency)

  return currentDiagram
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The system should be able to learn and adapt the baseline behavior over time.
*   The probability threshold and anomaly score threshold should be configurable by the user.
*   The system could integrate with alerting systems to notify administrators of potential issues.
*   A web-based interface could allow users to explore the diagram, filter dependencies, and investigate anomalies.
