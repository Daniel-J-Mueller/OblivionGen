## Adaptive Sensory Data Masking & Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the ‘cloaking’ concept beyond simple data masking to dynamically alter sensory input *before* it reaches the application, coupled with AI-driven behavioral profiling to anticipate data misuse.

**Specification:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Sensory Interception Module (SIM):** A low-latency hardware module residing between sensors (camera, microphone, location services, etc.) and application sandboxes.  Handles pre-processing of sensory data.
*   **AI Behavioral Analysis Engine (BAE):** A dedicated co-processor for running AI models. Located on device for privacy and speed.
*   **Secure Enclave:** Stores cryptographic keys, AI model parameters, and trust levels.
*   **Dynamic Masking Array (DMA):** Configurable hardware within the SIM to perform various masking operations.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Sensor Abstraction Layer (SAL):**  Unified interface for accessing sensor data.
*   **Trust Manager (TM):** Centralized component for managing application trust levels.  Receives updates from BAE & SIM.
*   **Behavioral Profiler (BP):** AI model (e.g., LSTM network) trained to learn expected application behavior based on sensor input patterns and feature usage.
*   **Dynamic Masking Controller (DMC):**  Configures DMA based on trust level, behavioral profile anomalies, and data sensitivity.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Application requests sensor data. SAL intercepts request.
2.  **Trust Level Check:** TM retrieves application trust level.
3.  **Behavioral Prediction:** BP predicts expected sensor data patterns based on current application state & historical data.
4.  **Anomaly Detection:** SIM compares actual sensor data with BP’s prediction.  Significant deviations flag potential misuse.
5.  **Dynamic Masking:**
    *   **Normal Operation:**  SIM applies a low-level masking based on data sensitivity and trust level (e.g., noise injection, blurring).
    *   **Anomaly Detected:** DMC dynamically adjusts masking parameters via DMA.  
        *   **Mild Anomaly:** Increased noise, feature obfuscation (e.g., hiding facial features in camera feed).
        *   **Severe Anomaly:** Full sensory feed interruption, replacement with synthetic data, or redirection to a decoy data stream.
6.  **Data Transmission:** Masked data is sent to the application.
7.  **Feedback & Learning:**  BAE analyzes application behavior and adjusts the behavioral profile. TM updates trust levels based on observed actions.
8.  **Event Logging:**  All masking events, anomalies, and trust level changes are logged for auditing and further analysis.

**IV. Pseudocode (DMC Configuration):**

```
function configure_masking(trust_level, anomaly_score, data_sensitivity):
  // Define masking parameters
  noise_level = base_noise + (trust_level * noise_scale) //Lower trust = higher noise
  blur_radius = base_blur + (anomaly_score * blur_scale) //Higher anomaly = higher blur
  feature_obfuscation_level = base_obfuscation + (data_sensitivity * obfuscation_scale)

  // Configure DMA
  DMA.set_noise_level(noise_level)
  DMA.set_blur_radius(blur_radius)
  DMA.set_feature_obfuscation(feature_obfuscation_level)

  return DMA.configuration
```

**V. Novel Aspects:**

*   **Pre-Application Masking:** Instead of reacting *after* data access, this system alters sensory input *before* it reaches the application.
*   **AI-Driven Prediction:** Leveraging behavioral profiling allows for proactive masking based on anticipated misuse, not just reactive responses.
*   **Dynamic Masking Parameters:**  Adjusting masking levels in real-time based on trust and anomaly scores provides a more granular and effective defense.
*   **Synthetic Data Injection:**  Replacing compromised data streams with synthetic data allows the application to continue functioning without exposing sensitive information.
