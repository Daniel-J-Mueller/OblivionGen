## Dynamic Sensor Fusion with Predictive Blackout Mapping

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive sensor failure mitigation to *predictive* failure zones and proactive sensor fusion. Instead of simply switching to a secondary sensor *after* a failure is detected, utilize historical data and real-time sensor status to anticipate potential blackouts *before* they occur, dynamically adjusting sensor weighting and fusion algorithms.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires the existing multi-sensor setup (depth, imaging, potentially others). Adds a dedicated low-power edge processing unit (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano equivalent) per sensor or sensor cluster. This unit will run the Predictive Blackout Mapping algorithm.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Historical Data Collector:** Gathers sensor data (raw values, status codes, frame rates, temperature, power consumption, network statistics) over time. Data stored in a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB).
    *   **Predictive Blackout Mapping (PBM) Algorithm:**  This is the core innovation.  It uses machine learning (specifically, a recurrent neural network - LSTM or GRU) trained on the historical data. Input features include:
        *   Sensor status data (as collected above)
        *   Environmental data (temperature, humidity - from existing environmental sensors in the facility)
        *   Usage patterns (time of day, day of week, known events).
        *   Output: A "Blackout Probability Map" â€“ a spatial grid overlaying the facility, representing the probability of sensor failure in each grid cell over a short time horizon (e.g., next 5 minutes).
    *   **Dynamic Sensor Fusion Engine (DSFE):** This module takes the Blackout Probability Map as input. It adjusts the weighting of each sensor's data during the fusion process.  Sensors predicted to have a high probability of failure are given lower weight, while those with low probability are given higher weight.  It also dynamically selects the fusion algorithm based on the Blackout Probability Map.  Algorithms include:
        *   **Kalman Filter:**  For stable, predictable environments.
        *   **Particle Filter:** For more dynamic and uncertain environments.
        *   **Bayesian Network:** To model complex dependencies between sensors.
    *   **Sensor Health Monitor:** Continuously monitors sensor data for anomalies and triggers alerts if a sensor is degrading or failing. This module works in conjunction with the PBM to refine predictions.

*   **Pseudocode (DSFE - Core Logic):**

```
function FuseSensorData(sensorData, blackoutMap):
  // blackoutMap is a grid representing failure probability (0.0 - 1.0)
  // sensorData is an array of data from each sensor

  // Calculate sensor weights based on blackoutMap
  for each sensor in sensorData:
    sensorWeight = 1.0 - blackoutMap[sensor.location] // Invert probability
    sensorWeight = max(0.0, sensorWeight) // Ensure weight is non-negative
    sensor.weight = sensor.weight * sensorWeight

  // Select Fusion Algorithm (example)
  if (blackoutMap contains high uncertainty):
    fusionAlgorithm = ParticleFilter
  else:
    fusionAlgorithm = KalmanFilter

  // Apply Fusion Algorithm
  fusedData = fusionAlgorithm.apply(sensorData)

  return fusedData
```

*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database (InfluxDB, Prometheus), configuration files for model parameters.
*   **API:** REST API for accessing fused data, configuring the system, and training the predictive model.



**Novelty:**  Most existing systems react *after* a failure. This system proactively anticipates failures and adjusts sensor weighting/algorithms *before* they occur, resulting in smoother and more reliable object tracking and inventory management.  The dynamic algorithm selection based on predicted uncertainty is also a key innovation.
