## Adaptive Anomaly Contextualization via Generative Pre-trained Transformers

**System Specification:** A real-time anomaly detection system leveraging a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model to dynamically contextualize incoming data streams and enhance anomaly detection accuracy.

**Core Innovation:**  The existing patent focuses on *detecting* anomalies based on pre-defined thresholds and attributes. This design shifts the focus to *understanding* the context surrounding the data to significantly reduce false positives and improve the detection of subtle, previously unknown anomalies. It does this by dynamically generating 'expected' data profiles and comparing incoming data against those profiles.

**System Components:**

1.  **Data Ingestion Module:** Receives the data stream (as described in the patent) including timestamps.
2.  **Contextualization Engine:** This is the core of the innovation. 
    *   **GPT Model:** A pre-trained GPT model (e.g., GPT-3.5, or a fine-tuned variant) acts as a contextual understanding engine.
    *   **Historical Data Buffer:**  A rolling window of recent data records is maintained.
    *   **Prompt Generation Module:**  Dynamically creates prompts for the GPT model. These prompts will include:
        *   A request to 'summarize the typical patterns' within the historical data buffer.
        *   Specifications of the relevant attributes to focus on.
        *   Instructions to identify 'expected ranges' or 'relationships' between attributes.
        *   The current timestamp to incorporate temporal context.
    *   **Context Profile Generator:**  The GPT model outputs a ‘context profile’—a natural language description of the expected data patterns, attribute relationships, and potential fluctuations. This profile is then converted into a structured format (e.g., a JSON object) defining permissible ranges and relationships for each attribute.
3.  **Anomaly Detection Module:** 
    *   **Evaluation Engine:** Compares incoming data records against the generated context profile. This goes beyond simple threshold comparisons. The Evaluation Engine assesses:
        *   Are attribute values within the permissible ranges?
        *   Do the relationships between attributes align with the expected relationships in the context profile?
        *   What is the degree of deviation from the expected pattern?
    *   **Anomaly Score Generator:**  Assigns an anomaly score based on the degree of deviation.
4.  **Action Module:** (As in the patent) Performs actions based on the anomaly score.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The Action Module's actions (e.g., flagging data) are fed back into the historical data buffer to refine the context profiles.

**Pseudocode (Contextualization Engine):**

```
FUNCTION generateContextProfile(historicalData, timestamp):
    prompt = "Summarize the typical patterns and expected ranges of the following data attributes:" + \
             historicalData.attributes + \
             "Considering the timestamp: " + timestamp + \
             "Identify any relationships between these attributes."

    contextProfileText = GPT_Model.generateText(prompt)

    # Parse the contextProfileText into a structured format (e.g., JSON)
    contextProfile = parseContextProfileText(contextProfileText)

    RETURN contextProfile

FUNCTION parseContextProfileText(text):
    #Use NLP libraries to extract key information.
    #Could include extraction of ranges, relationships and other relevant data
    #Output structured context profile
    RETURN structuredContextProfile

```

**Key Advantages:**

*   **Reduced False Positives:**  The system understands the *context* of the data, minimizing alerts triggered by normal, but unusual, fluctuations.
*   **Detection of Novel Anomalies:** It can detect anomalies that don't fit pre-defined patterns, as it’s assessing deviation from a dynamically generated ‘normal’ profile.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns and adapts to changing data patterns.
*   **Explainability:** The natural language context profiles provide insights into *why* an anomaly was detected.
