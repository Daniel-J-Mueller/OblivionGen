## Dynamic Data Container 'Shadowing' with Policy-Driven Replication

**Concept:** Extend the access point concept to dynamically create 'shadow' data containers, replicating data subsets based on access point policies and user/network context. This enables granular data visibility and security, optimized performance, and simplified compliance.

**Specification:**

**1. Shadow Container Manager:**

*   **Function:** A new service responsible for creating and managing shadow containers.
*   **Triggers:** Activated by access point creation/modification, or policy changes.
*   **Input:** Access point policy, associated data container metadata, user/network context.
*   **Output:**  Newly created shadow container(s), replication rules, access control settings.

**2. Policy-Driven Replication Engine:**

*   **Function:** Interprets access point policies to determine data replication strategy.
*   **Policy Types:**
    *   **Subset Replication:**  Replicate only data relevant to the access pointâ€™s policy (e.g., based on tags, fields, date ranges).
    *   **Data Masking/Transformation:** Replicate data after applying masking, encryption, or transformation rules.
    *   **Geographic Replication:** Replicate data to a geographically closer region for low latency access.
*   **Replication Mechanism:** Supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication.

**3. Access Point Interception & Redirection:**

*   **Function:** Intercepts data access requests directed to the primary data container.
*   **Redirection Logic:**
    *   Based on user/network context and the access point policy, the request is redirected to either the primary data container or the appropriate shadow container.
    *   If no applicable shadow container exists, a new one is dynamically created on demand.
*   **Transparent Operation:**  The redirection process is transparent to the client application.

**4. Shadow Container Lifecycle Management:**

*   **Creation:** Shadow containers are created dynamically on demand, based on access point policies.
*   **Synchronization:** Shadow containers are synchronized with the primary data container in real-time or near real-time.
*   **Deletion:** Shadow containers are automatically deleted when the corresponding access point is deleted or the policy changes.

**Pseudocode (Access Point Interception & Redirection):**

```
function handleDataRequest(request):
  accessPointId = request.accessPointId
  accessPointPolicy = getAccessPointPolicy(accessPointId)
  userContext = request.userContext
  networkContext = request.networkContext

  if (accessPointPolicy.shadowingEnabled):
    shadowContainerId = findMatchingShadowContainer(accessPointPolicy, userContext, networkContext)
    if (shadowContainerId == null):
      shadowContainerId = createShadowContainer(accessPointPolicy)
      populateShadowContainer(shadowContainerId, accessPointPolicy)
    redirectRequest(request, shadowContainerId)
  else:
    forwardRequest(request, primaryDataContainerId)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced data security and compliance.
*   Reduced latency and improved performance.
*   Simplified data governance and management.
*   Granular access control and data visibility.
*   Dynamically adjustable data access based on context.
