**Dynamic Scene-Based Character Interaction – “Echo Scenes”**

**Concept:** Extend the existing cast member information display to allow users to *interact* with specific scenes featuring that character, creating a personalized “Echo Scene” experience layered *within* the video content.

**Specs:**

1.  **Scene Segmentation & Tagging:** A background process analyzes video content, segmenting it into discrete scenes. Each scene is tagged with metadata: characters present, emotional tone (e.g., joyful, suspenseful, melancholic), dominant objects/locations.  This metadata is stored and indexed.

2.  **"Echo Scene" Trigger:** When a user selects a cast member from the displayed interface, *instead of* immediately showing a filmography, present a curated selection of 3-5 short “Echo Scenes” featuring that character.  These scenes are not full playback; they are 5-10 second clips, chosen based on:
    *   **Emotional Resonance:** Prioritize scenes matching the user’s recently exhibited viewing preferences (e.g., if the user frequently watches comedies, show humorous scenes).  This requires analysis of historical viewing data.
    *   **Character Arc:** Scenes are selected to represent key moments in the character’s development.
    *   **Scene Diversity:** Ensure a mix of scene types (dialogue, action, close-ups).

3.  **Interactive Scene Playback:**
    *   Each Echo Scene is presented as a playable clip within the interface, *layered on top of* the currently playing video (reduced opacity or windowed view).
    *   A small control bar allows the user to:
        *   Play/Pause the Echo Scene.
        *   “Pin” the Echo Scene to the main video – briefly highlighting corresponding moments in the primary content.
        *   “Explore” - Navigate to the full scene within the main video.
        *   "Similar Scenes" - request other scenes matching the mood or character state.
    *   The UI adapts to the current video; if the video is paused, the Echo Scenes are more prominent. If the video is playing, they appear as smaller, interactive overlays.

4.  **Personalized Echo Scene Generation:** Implement an AI agent that dynamically generates “Echo Scenes” based on user interaction. For example:
    *   If a user repeatedly pins scenes showing a character in distress, the AI prioritizes similar scenes.
    *   The AI can combine segments from *multiple* scenes to create a new, personalized Echo Scene focusing on a specific character trait or relationship.

5.  **Social Echoes:** Allow users to share their personalized Echo Scenes with others.  A shared Echo Scene can be viewed as a short highlight reel, sparking discussion and promoting discovery of new content.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function selectCastMember(castMemberID, userID):
  echoScenes = getEchoScenes(castMemberID, userID)
  displayEchoScenes(echoScenes)

function getEchoScenes(castMemberID, userID):
  scenes = database.getScenesByCastMember(castMemberID)
  filteredScenes = filterScenesByUserID(scenes, userID) //Based on viewing history, preferences.
  sortedScenes = sortScenesByRelevance(filteredScenes) //Prioritize emotionally resonant scenes.
  return sortedScenes[:5] //Return top 5 scenes

function filterScenesByUserID(scenes, userID):
  userPreferences = database.getUserPreferences(userID)
  filteredScenes = []
  for scene in scenes:
    if scene.emotionalTone matches userPreferences.preferredTones:
      filteredScenes.append(scene)
  return filteredScenes

function sortScenesByRelevance(scenes):
  //Complex ranking algorithm based on emotional tone, character arc, and scene diversity.
  //May incorporate AI-generated scores.
  return sorted(scenes, key=rankScene)
```
