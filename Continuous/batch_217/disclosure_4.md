## Dynamic Consumption Prediction & ‘Momentum’ Display

**Concept:** Extend the existing consumption ranking system to *predict* future consumption based on observed ‘momentum’ – not just historical rank changes, but the *rate of change* of those changes.  Then, display items not by current score, but by *predicted* score, emphasizing items showing accelerating growth.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Momentum Calculation:**
    *   For each item, track rank values over N time periods (e.g., N = 7 days).
    *   Calculate the first derivative (ΔRank/ΔTime) for each time period.  This represents the rate of rank change.
    *   Calculate the second derivative (Δ²Rank/ΔTime²) for each time period.  This represents the *acceleration* of rank change (momentum).
    *   Assign a ‘Momentum Score’ based on a weighted sum of the first and second derivatives:  `MomentumScore = α * (Average First Derivative) + β * (Average Second Derivative)`.  `α` and `β` are tunable weights. Higher `β` prioritizes accelerating items.

2.  **Predicted Rank Calculation:**
    *   Project the current rank forward in time (T time periods) using the Momentum Score as a predictor. This creates a 'Predicted Rank' for each item.  A simple projection: `PredictedRank = CurrentRank + (MomentumScore * T)`. More sophisticated models (e.g., exponential smoothing, ARIMA) could be employed.

3.  **Display Generation:**
    *   Sort items by *Predicted Rank*, not Current Score.
    *   Visually indicate ‘Momentum’ on the display:
        *   Use color-coding (e.g., green = positive momentum, red = negative momentum).
        *   Display a graphical ‘acceleration’ bar next to each item, proportional to the Magnitude of the Second Derivative.
        *   Include a 'Momentum Indicator' - e.g. an upwards or downwards arrow that is proportional to the 'Momentum Score'
    *   Provide options for users to filter the display by Momentum – e.g., “Show me items with high positive momentum”.

4.  **System Components:**
    *   **Data Collection Module:** Gathers rank data over time.
    *   **Momentum Calculation Engine:**  Calculates first and second derivatives, and Momentum Score.
    *   **Prediction Engine:**  Projects future rank based on Momentum Score.
    *   **Display Generation Module:** Sorts items and generates visual display elements.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_rank(current_rank, momentum_score, time_horizon, smoothing_factor):
    //Simple linear prediction with smoothing
    predicted_rank = current_rank + (momentum_score * time_horizon)
    
    //Apply smoothing factor to dampen predictions
    predicted_rank = (1 - smoothing_factor) * predicted_rank 
    
    return predicted_rank
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems focus on *current* or *historical* rank. This system explicitly forecasts *future* consumption, allowing for proactive discovery of emerging trends before they become mainstream.  The visual emphasis on ‘momentum’ provides a unique user experience, highlighting items gaining traction.
