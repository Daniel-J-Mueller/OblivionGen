## Dynamic Model Composition via Learned Attention

**Concept:** Extend the external handle/alias system to facilitate *composition* of models rather than simple replacement. Instead of swapping one model for another, the system learns to dynamically combine predictions from multiple loaded models based on input data characteristics, effectively creating a 'super-model' on the fly.

**Specs:**

*   **Model Chunking:** Models are broken down into functional 'chunks' – layers, sub-networks, or specialized processing units. Each chunk is individually loadable and addressable.
*   **Attention Network:** A small, dedicated neural network (the ‘Attentional Router’) is trained alongside the deployed models. Input data is passed through this network.
*   **Chunk Activation Map:** The Attentional Router outputs an activation map, indicating the weight or contribution of each loaded model chunk to the final prediction. This map is dynamically generated *per input*.
*   **Weighted Summation:** The outputs of the activated model chunks are combined using a weighted sum, determined by the Attentional Router’s activation map.
*   **External Handle Extension:** The existing external handle system is expanded to address individual model *chunks* rather than entire models. This allows for granular control and dynamic composition.
*   **Runtime Dependency Management:** The system automatically manages runtime dependencies for activated chunks (e.g., required libraries, execution environments).
*   **Memory Optimization:** Unused model chunks are automatically unloaded from memory, freeing resources.

**Pseudocode (Attentional Router):**

```
function predict(input_data):
  // 1. Encode input data
  encoded_data = encoder(input_data)

  // 2. Generate attention weights for each loaded chunk
  attention_weights = attention_network(encoded_data)

  // 3. Retrieve activated chunks based on attention weights (thresholding may be applied)
  activated_chunks = select_chunks(attention_weights)

  // 4. Execute activated chunks
  chunk_outputs = execute_chunks(activated_chunks, input_data)

  // 5. Weighted summation of chunk outputs
  final_output = weighted_sum(chunk_outputs, attention_weights)

  return final_output
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires sufficient onboard processing power to run the Attentional Router in addition to the deployed models.
*   Increased memory bandwidth to facilitate dynamic loading and unloading of model chunks.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Adaptive image processing (e.g., selecting different filters based on image content).
*   Personalized recommendation systems (combining different recommendation algorithms).
*   Real-time anomaly detection (combining different anomaly detection models).
*   Robust sensor fusion (combining predictions from multiple sensors).
