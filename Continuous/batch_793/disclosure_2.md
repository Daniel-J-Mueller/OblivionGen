## Decentralized Data Deletion Propagation with Proof-of-Deletion

**Concept:** Extend the data deletion notification service to a decentralized network leveraging blockchain or a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for verifiable deletion propagation and immutable audit trails. Instead of relying on confirmations *to* a central service, confirmations are posted *on* a distributed ledger.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Deletion Request Initiator (DRI):**  User-facing component initiating deletion requests. Generates a unique request ID (RID) and cryptographic hash of the request data.
*   **Deletion Propagation Network (DPN):**  A distributed network (e.g., blockchain, DAG) acting as the immutable record of deletion requests and confirmations. Nodes within the DPN are data repositories *and* validation nodes.
*   **Data Repository Adapters (DRA):** Modules enabling data repositories to interact with the DPN and process deletion requests.
*   **Validation Nodes (VN):** Nodes within the DPN responsible for verifying deletion confirmations based on pre-defined criteria.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** DRI generates RID, hashes request data, and broadcasts the request to the DPN.
2.  **DPN Recording:** The DPN records the RID and hash, assigning a transaction ID (TID).  The TID becomes the primary identifier for the deletion request on the ledger.
3.  **DRA Notification:** DRAs monitor the DPN for new TIDs targeting their respective repositories.
4.  **Deletion Execution:** DRA executes the deletion operation on the repository.
5.  **Confirmation & Proof Generation:** DRA generates a “Proof-of-Deletion” (PoD) – a cryptographic attestation confirming the deletion, signed by the DRA. This PoD includes the RID, TID, a timestamp, and a hash of the deleted data (or a confirmation that data no longer exists).
6.  **DPN Posting & Verification:** DRA posts the PoD to the DPN.  Validation Nodes verify the PoD’s signature, timestamp, and correlation with the original request (RID & TID).  Successful verification records a "Confirmed" status on the ledger for the given TID.
7.  **Auditing:**  Any party can query the DPN to verify the status of a deletion request. The DPN provides an immutable audit trail of the request, execution, and confirmation.

**3.  Data Structures:**

*   **Deletion Request (DR):** {RID: string, UserID: string, DataScope: array, Timestamp: number}
*   **Proof-of-Deletion (PoD):** {TID: string, RID: string, RepositoryID: string, Timestamp: number, DataHash: string, Signature: string}
*   **DPN Transaction:** {TransactionID: string, Type: enum(DR, PoD), Data: object, Timestamp: number}

**4. Pseudocode (DRA - Handling PoD Posting):**

```pseudocode
function handleDeletionRequest(requestData) {
  // Extract RID, UserID, DataScope
  // Perform deletion operation based on DataScope
  deletionSuccessful = performDataDeletion(requestData)

  if (deletionSuccessful) {
    // Generate PoD
    pod = generateProofOfDeletion(requestData)

    // Post PoD to DPN
    transactionID = postToDPN(pod)

    if (transactionID != NULL) {
      log("Deletion confirmed on DPN: " + transactionID)
    } else {
      log("Failed to confirm deletion on DPN")
      // Implement retry logic
    }
  } else {
    log("Deletion failed on repository")
    //Handle deletion failure
  }
}
```

**5. Enhancement -  Tiered Validation:**

Implement tiered validation nodes – some nodes verify basic signature/timestamp, while others perform more complex verification (e.g., confirming data is *actually* inaccessible).  This allows for scaling validation based on security requirements.
