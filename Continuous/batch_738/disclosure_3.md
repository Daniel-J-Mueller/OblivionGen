## Modular Robotic Skill Decomposition & Transfer via Dynamic Graph Networks

**Concept:** Extend the simulation-to-real transfer learning paradigm by focusing on *skill decomposition* – breaking down complex tasks into smaller, reusable “skill modules.” These modules are learned and refined in simulation, then transferred to the real world. Crucially, the system dynamically *re-combines* these modules to address new, unseen tasks, guided by a dynamic graph network.

**Specifications:**

**1. Skill Module Library:**

*   **Data Structure:** Each skill module encapsulates:
    *   A trained control policy (e.g., a neural network).
    *   A state representation (input to the policy).
    *   An action space definition.
    *   A reward function (used during training and evaluation).
    *   A “compatibility score” metric—a function determining how well the module interfaces with others (explained below).
*   **Learning:** Modules are learned via the existing simulation-to-real approach. However, learning prioritizes generalization – training on diverse variations of a core skill.
*   **Module Discovery:** Automated process for identifying potentially reusable skills from successful task completions in simulation/real world.

**2. Dynamic Graph Network (DGN):**

*   **Nodes:** Represent individual skill modules.
*   **Edges:** Represent compatibility between modules. Edge weight is determined by the “compatibility score” – a function considering:
    *   State/Action Space overlap.
    *   Reward function alignment.
    *   Transition probabilities between module outputs and subsequent module inputs.
*   **Graph Construction:** The DGN is dynamically constructed *at runtime*, based on the current task and available modules.
*   **Graph Search:** Utilizes a graph search algorithm (e.g., A*, Monte Carlo Tree Search) to identify a sequence of modules that best addresses the current task, optimizing for:
    *   Predicted task success.
    *   Execution time.
    *   Resource usage.

**3. Compatibility Score Function (Example):**

```pseudocode
function calculate_compatibility(module_A, module_B):
  state_overlap = calculate_state_overlap(module_A.state_representation, module_B.state_representation)
  action_overlap = calculate_action_overlap(module_A.action_space, module_B.action_space)
  reward_alignment = calculate_reward_alignment(module_A.reward_function, module_B.reward_function)
  
  compatibility_score = (0.5 * state_overlap) + (0.3 * action_overlap) + (0.2 * reward_alignment)
  return compatibility_score
```

**4. Runtime Operation:**

1.  **Task Input:** The system receives a high-level task description.
2.  **DGN Construction:**  The DGN is constructed by evaluating the compatibility of available skill modules, and connecting modules with a high compatibility score.
3.  **Path Planning:** A graph search algorithm identifies a sequence of skill modules that best address the task.
4.  **Execution:**  The system executes the selected modules in sequence.  Real-time feedback is used to refine module parameters and adapt to changing conditions.
5.  **Learning:** Successful module combinations are added to the skill library, and module parameters are refined based on real-world performance.



**5. Hardware/Software Requirements**
*   High-performance computing for simulation.
*   Real-time control system for robotic manipulation.
*   Modular robotic platform.
*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Graph database for DGN storage and retrieval.
