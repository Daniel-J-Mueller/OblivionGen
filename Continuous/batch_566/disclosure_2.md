## Adaptive Animation LOD via Perceptual Error Metrics

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the core idea of animation curve reduction but shifts the focus from simple thresholding to a perceptual error model. Instead of deleting samples based on a fixed threshold, the system dynamically adjusts the Level of Detail (LOD) of animations based on the *perceived* visual difference introduced by sample removal, tailored to the device and viewing context.

**Components:**

1.  **Perceptual Error Model:**
    *   A pre-trained neural network (likely a convolutional neural network) trained to predict the perceptual difference between the original animation and a reduced-sample animation.  Training data would consist of paired animations and their corresponding perceptual scores (e.g., using metrics like Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) or Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)).
    *   The model's input would be a short segment (e.g., 3-5 frames) of the rendered animation.
    *   Output: A perceptual error score, representing how noticeable the reduction in samples is.

2.  **Animation LOD Controller:**
    *   Receives the perceptual error score from the Perceptual Error Model.
    *   Based on the score and pre-defined quality targets (e.g., "Acceptable," "Good," "Excellent"), the controller determines the appropriate level of animation curve reduction.
    *   Uses a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the number of samples to remove from each animation curve while staying within the quality target. This avoids simply removing samples until the error exceeds a threshold â€“ it finds the *best* trade-off.
    *   Adjusts the reduction level for each animation curve *independently*.  Curves representing fast-moving or visually prominent attributes (e.g., position) will be reduced less aggressively than curves for subtle effects (e.g., minor color adjustments).

3.  **Device & Context Aware Adjustment:**
    *   The system gathers data about the target device:
        *   Screen resolution and pixel density
        *   Processing power (GPU/CPU)
        *   Battery level
        *   Network connectivity
    *   It also considers the viewing context:
        *   Viewing distance (estimated via camera input or user preference)
        *   Ambient lighting conditions (detected via sensors)
    *   This data is fed into the LOD Controller to further refine the reduction level. For example, on a low-power device with poor network connectivity, the system will prioritize aggressive reduction even if it means a slightly lower visual quality.

**Pseudocode (LOD Controller):**

```pseudocode
function determineLOD(animationData, deviceData, contextData):
  // Initialize LOD levels (e.g., 1-10, 10 being highest detail)
  lodLevels = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

  bestLOD = 10 // Start with highest detail

  for lodLevel in lodLevels:
    reducedAnimationData = reduceAnimationSamples(animationData, lodLevel)
    perceptualError = PerceptualErrorModel(rendered(reducedAnimationData))

    if perceptualError < acceptableThreshold:
      bestLOD = lodLevel
    else:
      break // Stop if error exceeds threshold

  // Adjust based on device and context
  if deviceData.batteryLevel < 20%:
    bestLOD = min(bestLOD - 1, 5) // Reduce further on low battery

  if contextData.viewingDistance > 3 meters:
    bestLOD = min(bestLOD - 1, 5) //Reduce further if viewed from a distance

  return bestLOD
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `animationData`: Stores animation curves, keyframes, and related data.
*   `deviceData`: Contains device specifications (resolution, CPU, GPU, battery, etc.).
*   `contextData`:  Holds contextual information (viewing distance, lighting).

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple threshold-based reduction by:

*   Employing a perceptual error model to assess the *noticeability* of sample removal.
*   Dynamically adjusting the LOD based on device capabilities and viewing context.
*   Optimizing the reduction level for each animation curve independently.
*   Leveraging a trained neural network for quality assessment.
