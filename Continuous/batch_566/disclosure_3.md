## Dynamic Media "Echo" System

**Concept:** A system that dynamically generates shortened, contextually-relevant "echoes" of media content *after* a user has begun consuming it, proactively suggesting relevant segments based on evolving consumption patterns and inferred intent. This goes beyond simple abridgement – it's anticipatory and personalized.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module: Consumption Pattern Analyzer.**
    *   Input: Real-time media consumption data (timestamps, segments viewed, playback speed, pauses, rewinds), dialogue search query history, user profile data (language preferences, inferred interests, social network connections – optional).
    *   Processing:  Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on a large corpus of media content metadata (topics, entities, sentiment). The RNN predicts the *likely* next area of interest for the user based on their current consumption and historical data.  Output is a probability distribution over potential media segments.
    *   Output: Ranked list of media segments (start/end times, associated dialogue snippets, keywords) with associated confidence scores.

*   **Echo Generation Module.**
    *   Input: Ranked list of media segments from the Consumption Pattern Analyzer.
    *   Processing:  Selects the top *N* segments (configurable parameter).  For each segment:
        1.  Generates a concise "echo" – a dynamically-edited clip (5-15 seconds) that highlights the most relevant portions.  Uses automated video editing techniques (scene detection, keyframe extraction, audio enhancement).
        2.  Generates a textual summary of the echo's content, emphasizing keywords and entities.
        3.  Associates the echo with relevant metadata (tags, categories, related products/services).
    *   Output: A stream of dynamic "echoes" – short, personalized video clips with accompanying text summaries.

*   **User Interface Integration.**
    *   Echoes are presented to the user via a dedicated "Echo Panel" within the media player interface.
    *   Echoes are displayed as a horizontally scrolling list.
    *   User can click on an echo to jump directly to the corresponding segment within the media content.
    *   User can provide feedback on echoes (e.g., "helpful", "not relevant"), which is used to refine the Consumption Pattern Analyzer's predictions.

*   **Dialogue-Driven Echo Amplification**
    *   Utilize the existing dialogue search capabilities to identify segments which *contain* a user's previous query.
    *   Boost the confidence score of segments containing matching dialogue to push them higher in the echo selection order.
    *   Dynamically re-render the echo with dialogue subtitles highlighting the matching keywords.

**Pseudocode (Echo Selection):**

```
function select_echoes(user_consumption_data, dialogue_query_history):
  segments = analyze_consumption(user_consumption_data) //RNN output
  
  for segment in segments:
    if segment contains dialogue matching query in dialogue_query_history:
      segment.confidence_score += boost_factor //Boost score
      
  sorted_segments = sort(segments, key=confidence_score, descending=True)
  
  echoes = generate_echoes(sorted_segments[:N]) //Generate clips and summaries
  
  return echoes
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond static abridgement and proactive recommendation. It generates *dynamic* echoes, adapting to the user's evolving consumption patterns in *real-time*. The integration of dialogue search history provides a strong contextual signal, enabling even more personalized and relevant echoes. It's a true anticipatory media experience.
