## Adaptive Mood-Based Media Queueing & Sensory Integration

**Concept:** Extend the collaborative queueing system to incorporate real-time biometric data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial expression analysis) from participants to dynamically adjust the queue, and to integrate ambient sensory output (lighting, scent diffusion) synchronized with the music.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biometric Data Acquisition & Processing Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time biometric data streams from participant devices (smartwatches, phones with cameras, dedicated sensors). Data types: heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA – skin conductance), facial expression analysis (using computer vision algorithms).
*   **Preprocessing:** Noise filtering, outlier removal, signal smoothing.
*   **Mood Classification:** Machine learning model (trained on labeled biometric data) to classify participant mood into discrete categories (e.g., energetic, relaxed, melancholic, anxious). Confidence scores associated with each classification.
*   **Aggregation:**  Algorithm to combine individual mood classifications into a collective mood profile for the group. Weighted averaging based on proximity or designated “mood leader” roles.
*   **Output:** Collective mood profile, confidence scores, and individual mood data.

**2. Dynamic Queue Adjustment Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Collective mood profile, current media queue, song metadata (genre, tempo, valence, energy), participant preferences.
*   **Mood-Based Scoring:** Assign scores to songs based on their alignment with the current collective mood.  Higher scores for songs that match the mood, lower scores for conflicting songs.
*   **Queue Reordering:** Reorder the queue based on mood-based scores.  Songs with higher scores are prioritized. Introduce a “mood drift” factor – slowly shift the queue towards songs that encourage a desired mood state (e.g., move from melancholic to energetic).
*   **Song Substitution:**  If the current song is significantly misaligned with the mood, suggest or automatically substitute it with a more appropriate song.  Allow participants to veto substitutions.
*   **Adaptive Volume & Tempo:** Adjust the volume and tempo of songs based on the collective mood.  Higher volume and faster tempo for energetic moods, lower volume and slower tempo for relaxed moods.
*   **Output:** Dynamically adjusted media queue, adjusted song parameters (volume, tempo).

**3. Sensory Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Adjusted media queue, song metadata, collective mood profile.
*   **Lighting Control:**  Control smart lighting systems (Hue, Lifx) to create ambient lighting that matches the music and mood.  Color, brightness, and effects (e.g., pulsating, strobing) are dynamically adjusted.
*   **Scent Diffusion:** Control smart scent diffusers to release aromas that complement the music and mood.  Different scents are associated with different moods and genres (e.g., lavender for relaxation, citrus for energy).
*   **Haptic Feedback (Optional):** Integrate with wearable devices to provide subtle haptic feedback synchronized with the music (e.g., gentle vibrations on the wrist during bass drops).
*   **Output:** Control signals for smart lighting, scent diffusers, and haptic feedback devices.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Queue Adjustment):**

```
function adjustQueue(collectiveMood, currentQueue, songMetadata):
  moodScore = calculateMoodScore(collectiveMood, songMetadata)
  newQueue = sortQueueByMoodScore(currentQueue, moodScore)

  if moodScore is low and vetoCount < maxVetoes:
    suggestSongSubstitution(songMetadata)
    if userVetoes:
      vetoCount++
    else:
      replaceSongWithSuggestedSong()

  adjustVolumeAndTempo(collectiveMood)
  return newQueue
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Participant Devices (smartphones, smartwatches, etc.)
*   Smart Lighting System (Philips Hue, Lifx)
*   Smart Scent Diffuser
*   Dedicated Server for processing biometric data and managing the queue.
*   Optional: Wearable devices with haptic feedback capabilities.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   AI-powered song recommendations based on collective mood and listening history.
*   Personalized queue adjustments based on individual preferences and biometric data.
*   Integration with virtual reality or augmented reality environments.
*   Mood-based dynamic playlists.
*   Cross-device synchronization of queue and sensory output.
