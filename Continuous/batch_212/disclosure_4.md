## Personalized Sensory Shopping Assistant

**Concept:** Extend the assisted shopping experience beyond voice and data to incorporate real-time sensory feedback tailored to the user's preferences and the product being considered. This builds upon the patent's foundation of contextual assistance but moves into a more immersive and personalized realm.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components (Integrated with Second Computing Device - User’s Device):**

*   **Haptic Feedback Array:** A small, flexible array integrated into the device’s casing (or a wearable extension like a glove) capable of generating localized vibrations, textures, and pressures.
*   **Micro-Scent Diffuser:** A miniaturized diffuser capable of releasing subtle scents corresponding to product attributes. Cartridges would be replaceable.
*   **Ambient Light Emitter:** A small, low-power LED array capable of projecting soft, colored light onto nearby surfaces or the user’s hand/arm.
*   **Proximity Sensor Enhancement:** Existing proximity data is augmented with *material* proximity identification (wood, metal, fabric, plastic etc.)
*   **Environmental Sensor Suite:** Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality sensors - to feed into the personalized sensory profile.

**II. Software Architecture (Resides on First Computing Device - Assistance Server):**

1.  **Sensory Profile Manager:**
    *   Stores user preferences for haptic feedback, scents, and light colors/intensities.
    *   Learns user preferences over time through implicit feedback (e.g., adjusting intensity, duration) and explicit ratings.
    *   Integrates data from user accounts (purchase history, stated preferences) to build a comprehensive sensory profile.

2.  **Product Sensory Mapping Engine:**
    *   Maintains a database mapping product attributes to sensory stimuli. For example:
        *   "Leather Jacket" ->  Haptic: Soft, textured vibration. Scent: Leather. Light: Warm amber.
        *   "Stainless Steel Watch" -> Haptic: Cool, smooth vibration. Scent: Metallic. Light: Silver/Blue.
        *   "Pine Scented Candle" -> Haptic: Subtle warmth. Scent: Pine. Light: Soft green.
    *   Dynamically adjusts sensory output based on user interaction (e.g., zooming in on a product image triggers a more intense sensory response).

3.  **Contextual Sensory Blending Module:**
    *   Combines sensory stimuli based on the current shopping context. For example, if the user is browsing outdoor equipment, the system might subtly simulate a cool breeze (through temperature regulation and light color) along with the sensory attributes of the specific products.
    *   Integrates environmental sensor data to enhance realism (e.g., simulating a warmer temperature for products intended for warmer climates).

4.  **API Integration:** 
    *  Seamlessly integrates with existing e-commerce platforms and customer service systems.
    *  Allows for remote control and configuration of sensory profiles by customer service agents.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  User initiates assistance request via voice command (as in the patent).
2.  Assistance server establishes data and voice sessions.
3.  Server retrieves user’s sensory profile.
4.  As the user browses products, the server dynamically activates the appropriate sensory stimuli via the user’s device (haptic, scent, light).
5.  The system monitors user reactions (e.g., adjusting sensory intensity, expressed preferences) and updates the sensory profile accordingly.
6.  Customer service agent can remotely adjust the sensory experience to optimize engagement and provide a more personalized shopping experience.
7.  The proximity sensor is used to determine distance to objects, and if the object is one being shopped for, the relevant sensory output is triggered. 

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function processShoppingRequest(userID, speechInput, proximityData):
    userProfile = loadUserProfile(userID)
    product = findProductFromSpeech(speechInput)
    sensoryStimuli = getSensoryStimuliForProduct(product, userProfile)
    if proximityData.objectDetected and proximityData.object == product:
        triggerSensoryOutput(userDevice, sensoryStimuli)
    transmitSearchResults(userDevice, searchResults)

function triggerSensoryOutput(userDevice, stimuli):
    userDevice.haptic.activate(stimuli.haptic)
    userDevice.scent.release(stimuli.scent)
    userDevice.light.emit(stimuli.light)
```

**Novelty:** This expands upon the existing assisted shopping paradigm by introducing multi-sensory feedback.  It moves beyond simply *telling* the user about a product to allowing them to *experience* it, creating a more engaging and memorable shopping experience. This also opens possibilities for accessibility features for visually or hearing impaired users.
