## Dynamic Schema Tag Inheritance & Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the schema modification capability to enable *inheritance* of tags (and associated classes) between objects within the hierarchical data structure. This facilitates a system where changes to a 'parent' object's tags automatically propagate, with configurable constraints, to its 'children', streamlining management and enforcing consistency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Tag Inheritance Levels:**

*   Introduce an integer value (“Inheritance Level”) associated with each tag within the schema. Values range from 0-10 (configurable).
*   Level 0: Tag applies only to the object it’s directly assigned to. No inheritance.
*   Level > 0:  Tag inheritance is enabled. The value represents the maximum depth of inheritance.

**2. Inheritance Resolution Algorithm:**

*   When accessing an object, the system traverses *up* the hierarchy, collecting all tags with Inheritance Level > 0.
*   Tags are collected *until* the root of the hierarchy is reached, or the maximum Inheritance Level is exceeded.
*   Collected tags are *merged* with the object’s directly assigned tags.  Conflict resolution (if tags with the same name exist) is determined by a configurable priority scheme (e.g., direct assignment overrides inherited tags, last tag wins).

**3. Inheritance Constraints:**

*   **Tag Filters:** Introduce “Tag Filters” associated with objects. These filters define specific criteria (e.g., tag name, tag value) that *prevent* inheritance of certain tags.  A filter acts as a boolean condition.
*   **Hierarchy Limits:**  Configurable maximum inheritance depth per branch of the hierarchy. Prevents unbounded inheritance propagation.

**4. Schema Update API Extension:**

*   `updateTagInheritance(objectID, tagName, inheritanceLevel, tagFilter)`:  Updates the inheritance level and filter for a specific tag on an object.
*   `simulateInheritance(objectID, tagName)`:  Simulates the inheritance process for a given tag on an object, returning a list of all tags that would be applied.  Useful for debugging and verification.

**Pseudocode (Inheritance Resolution):**

```
function resolveInheritedTags(objectID):
  inheritedTags = []
  currentObjectID = objectID
  depth = 0

  while (currentObjectID != rootObjectID and depth < maxInheritanceDepth):
    parentObjectID = getParent(currentObjectID)
    tags = getTags(parentObjectID)

    for tag in tags:
      if tag.inheritanceLevel > 0:
        if not tagIsFiltered(tag, currentObjectID):
          inheritedTags.append(tag)

    currentObjectID = parentObjectID
    depth++

  // Merge inherited tags with object's directly assigned tags
  mergedTags = mergeTags(getTags(objectID), inheritedTags)
  return mergedTags
```

**Example Use Case:**

Imagine a system managing access control policies. A 'company' object has a tag 'securityLevel=high' with inheritance level 5. All departments and users nested under that company automatically inherit that security level unless overridden by a specific filter. This ensures consistent security across the entire organization without requiring manual configuration for each individual object.
