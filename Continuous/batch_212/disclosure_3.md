## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Dynamic Sensor Weighting & Holographic Beamforming

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple source localization to *reconstruct* the acoustic environment, creating a 3D “sound map” incorporating reflections, reverberation, and dynamic weighting of sensor contributions. This allows for not just *where* sounds originate, but a full experiential recreation of the soundscape.

**I. System Architecture**

1.  **Sensor Array:** Minimum of 8, ideally 16+ omnidirectional microphones distributed within a defined volume. Consider both fixed and dynamically repositionable (robotic) sensors.
2.  **Data Acquisition Unit:** High-resolution ADC (at least 24-bit, 96kHz sample rate) with synchronized sampling across all microphones.
3.  **Processing Unit:** High-performance CPU/GPU cluster or dedicated FPGA array for real-time signal processing.
4.  **Acoustic Reflection Mapping Module:** Utilizes ray tracing algorithms combined with estimated Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) to identify and map significant reflective surfaces within the environment.
5.  **Dynamic Sensor Weighting Module:** A Bayesian network which assigns weights to each sensor based on its signal quality (SNR), proximity to source, and confidence in TDOA estimations.  Weights are dynamically adjusted in real-time.
6.  **Holographic Beamforming Module:** Utilizes a 3D holographic reconstruction algorithm, informed by TDOA data, sensor weights, and reflection map, to synthesize a virtual sound field representing the acoustic environment.

**II. Algorithm Specifications**

1.  **TDOA Estimation:**  Utilize a Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC) with Phase Transform (PHAT) weighting for initial TDOA estimation.  Refine estimations using a Kalman Filter to track source positions over time.
2.  **Reflection Mapping:**
    *   Input: TDOA data, environment geometry (CAD model or point cloud), microphone positions.
    *   Process:  Ray tracing simulation to identify potential reflection paths. Calculate expected TDOA for reflections. Compare expected TDOA to observed TDOA. Update reflection map weights based on correlation.
3.  **Dynamic Sensor Weighting:**
    *   Input: SNR of each sensor, distance to estimated source location, confidence in TDOA estimation (derived from Kalman Filter covariance).
    *   Bayesian Network Structure:
        *   Nodes: SNR, Distance, TDOA Confidence, Sensor Weight.
        *   Conditional Probabilities: Trained on a dataset of acoustic scenarios.
        *   Inference: Calculate posterior probability of Sensor Weight given observed SNR, Distance, and TDOA Confidence.
4.  **Holographic Beamforming:**
    *   Input: Weighted TDOA data, reflection map, virtual listener position.
    *   Process:  Calculate amplitude and phase delays for each microphone signal to synthesize a virtual wavefront originating from the estimated source and its reflections.
    *   Output:  A complex signal representing the reconstructed sound field. This can be fed into headphones or a multi-speaker array for immersive playback.

**III. Data Structures**

1.  `SensorData`:
    *   `microphoneID`: Integer
    *   `audioBuffer`: Array of floats
    *   `SNR`: Float
    *   `position`: (x, y, z) coordinates
2.  `ReflectionMap`:
    *   `surfaceID`: Integer
    *   `position`: (x, y, z) coordinates
    *   `reflectionCoefficient`: Float
    *   `normalVector`: (x, y, z) coordinates
3.  `SourceEstimate`:
    *   `position`: (x, y, z) coordinates
    *   `confidence`: Float
    *   `timestamp`: Integer

**IV. Pseudocode - Dynamic Weighting Module**

```
function calculateSensorWeight(sensorData, sourceEstimate):
    snr = sensorData.snr
    distance = distance(sensorData.position, sourceEstimate.position)
    tdoaConfidence = sourceEstimate.confidence

    // Normalize values to a range of 0 to 1
    normalizedSnr = sigmoid(snr, k=10, x0=5)  // Adjust parameters as needed
    normalizedDistance = 1 / (1 + distance)
    normalizedTdoaConfidence = tdoaConfidence

    // Combine normalized values with predefined weights
    weightSnr = 0.4
    weightDistance = 0.3
    weightTdoa = 0.3

    sensorWeight = (weightSnr * normalizedSnr) + (weightDistance * normalizedDistance) + (weightTdoa * normalizedTdoaConfidence)

    return sensorWeight
```

**V. Expansion and Adaptation**

This system could be expanded with machine learning to automatically identify and classify sound events within the reconstructed acoustic environment. The holographic beamforming module could also be adapted for active noise cancellation or directional sound projection. The inclusion of visual data (cameras) would create a full audio-visual reconstruction of the environment.
