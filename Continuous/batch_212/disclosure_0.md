## Real-time Affective Audio Synthesis & Layering

**Concept:** Expand beyond speech synthesis based solely on lip positions to incorporate real-time emotion/affect detection from the video feed and *layer* synthesized audio to modulate the original speech – subtly or dramatically – conveying the detected emotion.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Video feed (source for facial feature tracking – existing capability), original audio feed (as in the patent), Real-time Affect Detection Model (RADM).
*   **RADM:**  A pre-trained or continuously learning machine learning model (e.g., CNN, Transformer) trained on audio-visual emotion recognition datasets. RADM outputs emotion labels (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral) *and* intensity scores (0-1).
*   **Affective Audio Library (AAL):**  A curated library of short audio samples (phonemes, syllables, emotive breaths, sighs, vocalizations) categorized by emotion *and* intensity.  Crucially, samples are designed for *additive* mixing with speech, avoiding clashes in frequency/tone. This library is expandable.
*   **Synthesis Engine:**
    1.  **Facial Feature Tracking:** Utilize the existing facial feature tracking to obtain lip positions, but *also* track other relevant facial features indicative of emotion (e.g., brow furrow, smile lines, eye widening).
    2.  **Emotion Estimation:**  Input tracked features into RADM to obtain emotion label and intensity score.
    3.  **Audio Selection:**  Based on estimated emotion and intensity, select appropriate audio samples from the AAL. Multiple samples can be selected and blended.
    4.  **Audio Mixing:**  Mix selected audio samples *subtly* with the original audio. Volume and equalization of the layered audio are dynamically adjusted based on the intensity score.  The goal is *augmentation* of the existing speech, not replacement.  A ‘naturalness’ algorithm prevents unrealistic sound combinations.
    5.  **Output:** Augmented audio stream.
*   **Parameters (Adjustable by User/System):**
    *   **Augmentation Strength:** Overall volume of layered audio.
    *   **Emotion Filtering:**  Allow/disallow specific emotions to be augmented.
    *   **Naturalness Threshold:**  Minimum acceptable naturalness score for audio combinations.
    *   **AAL Update Frequency:**  Controls how often the Affective Audio Library is updated with new samples.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
LOOP:
    video_frame, audio_frame = INPUT()
    facial_features = TRACK_FACIAL_FEATURES(video_frame)
    emotion, intensity = RADM.PREDICT(facial_features)
    audio_samples = AAL.SELECT(emotion, intensity)
    mixed_audio = MIX_AUDIO(audio_frame, audio_samples, intensity)
    OUTPUT(mixed_audio)
END LOOP
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced video conferencing: Convey emotion more clearly.
*   Accessibility: Provide emotional cues for individuals with hearing impairments.
*   Entertainment: Create more immersive gaming and VR experiences.
*   Psychological/Therapeutic tools: Analyze and augment emotional expression.
