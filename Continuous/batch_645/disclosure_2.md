## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System - Wearable Device Integration

**Concept:** Integrate a localized, adaptive haptic feedback system *within* the wearable device itself, responding to biofeedback *and* external environmental data. Not just vibration, but nuanced pressure, temperature changes, and micro-muscle stimulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) - continuous heart rate & HRV monitoring
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) – Stress/arousal level detection.
    *   Ambient Temperature Sensor - external temperature reading.
    *   Barometric Pressure Sensor – altitude/environmental change.
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope - motion/activity tracking.
    *   Microphone – ambient sound analysis (for contextual haptics).
*   **Haptic Actuator Array:**
    *   An array of micro-pneumatic actuators distributed across the wearable’s surface (wristband, casing).
    *   Each actuator capable of independent pressure control (0-5 PSI).
    *   Peltier elements integrated with actuators for localized temperature control (-5°C to +5°C relative to skin temp).
    *   Micro-stimulation pads (low-intensity electrical muscle stimulation – TENS principles) interspersed among pneumatic actuators.
*   **Processing Unit:**
    *   Low-power ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller.
    *   Dedicated DSP for real-time signal processing of sensor data.
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transmission & firmware updates.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Biofeedback Mapping:** Algorithms to map HRV, EDA, & activity levels to haptic patterns.  (e.g., increased EDA = pulsing pressure on wrist, slow/regular HRV = gentle warming sensation).
    *   **Environmental Contextualization:**  Combine environmental data with biofeedback. (e.g., Cold temperature + elevated stress = localized warming & rhythmic pressure, loud noise + high stress = gentle vibration pattern to focus attention).
    *   **Adaptive Learning:** Machine learning model to personalize haptic patterns based on user response. (Record user reactions to different stimuli and refine haptic feedback over time).
    *   **Gesture Recognition:** Integrate gesture recognition to trigger specific haptic feedback sequences (e.g., rotating wrist triggers 'focus' sequence).

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    READ_SENSOR_DATA() // PPG, EDA, Temp, Pressure, Accel, Gyro, Mic
    PROCESS_SENSOR_DATA() // Filter, Normalize, Extract Features
    
    IF (EDA > THRESHOLD_HIGH) THEN
        HAPTIC_PATTERN = "STRESS_REDUCTION" // Rhythmic pulsing pressure
    ELSE IF (HRV < THRESHOLD_LOW) THEN
        HAPTIC_PATTERN = "FOCUS" // Gentle warming + consistent pressure
    ELSE IF (TEMP < COLD_THRESHOLD) THEN
        HAPTIC_PATTERN = "WARMING" //Localized heating
    ELSE IF (ACCEL > ACTIVITY_THRESHOLD) THEN
        HAPTIC_PATTERN = "MOTIVATION" // Brief, encouraging pulses
    ELSE
        HAPTIC_PATTERN = "IDLE" // Minimal feedback
    
    APPLY_HAPTIC_PATTERN(HAPTIC_PATTERN)
    
    DELAY(0.1 seconds)
    GOTO LOOP
```
