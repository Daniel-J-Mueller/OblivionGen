## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend voice command functionality beyond simple audio playback and volume control to create and manipulate dynamic acoustic environments. This involves spatially rendering sounds *around* the user, simulating realistic soundscapes based on voice commands and environmental sensors.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate an array of ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors and microphones into the input device and output devices (speakers). UWB provides precise location data for both the user and the acoustic environment. Microphones capture ambient sounds to inform the reconstruction process.
*   **Acoustic Mapping Module:** This module generates a real-time 3D acoustic map of the environment using UWB data. The map identifies surfaces, obstacles, and reflective areas.  The ambient microphone data is used to identify existing sound sources in the environment.
*   **Sound Source Library:** A vast library of pre-recorded and procedurally generated sound sources categorized by environment (forest, city, concert hall, etc.) and object type (car, bird, rain, speech, music).
*   **Voice Command Parser & Scene Director:**  A natural language processing (NLP) engine that interprets voice commands related to scene creation/manipulation. Example commands: “Create a rainforest”, “Add a babbling brook to the left”, “Increase the bird sounds”, "Move the concert to the living room". The Scene Director utilizes this information to select appropriate sound sources and parameters.
*   **Spatial Audio Renderer:**  A core component responsible for rendering sound sources in 3D space. It uses Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) customized to the user (using initial calibration) to create a realistic spatial audio experience.  This module dynamically adjusts sound levels, panning, and reverb based on the acoustic map and user position.
*   **Dynamic Reverb Engine:** A physically modeled reverb engine that simulates realistic acoustic environments. It utilizes the acoustic map to model reflections and diffractions, creating an immersive and believable soundscape.
*   **Output Device Synchronization:** All output devices (speakers) are synchronized to deliver the rendered soundscape accurately. UWB data ensures that each speaker is appropriately calibrated to its location and contributes to the overall sonic environment.

**Pseudocode (Scene Director – simplified):**

```
function ProcessVoiceCommand(command_text):
    intent = NLP_Engine.GetIntent(command_text)

    if intent == "CREATE_SCENE":
        scene_type = NLP_Engine.GetSceneType(command_text)
        CreateScene(scene_type)
    elif intent == "ADD_SOUND":
        sound_type = NLP_Engine.GetSoundType(command_text)
        location = NLP_Engine.GetLocation(command_text)
        AddSound(sound_type, location)
    elif intent == "MODIFY_SOUND":
        sound_id = NLP_Engine.GetSoundID(command_text)
        parameter = NLP_Engine.GetParameter(command_text)
        value = NLP_Engine.GetValue(command_text)
        ModifySound(sound_id, parameter, value)

function CreateScene(scene_type):
    // Load pre-defined soundscape configuration for scene_type
    soundscape = LoadSoundscape(scene_type)
    // Instantiate sound sources based on soundscape configuration
    for source in soundscape.sources:
        InstantiateSound(source)

function InstantiateSound(source):
    sound_object = CreateSoundObject(source.sound_file, source.position, source.volume)
    // Apply HRTF for user-specific spatialization
    ApplyHRTF(sound_object)
    sound_objects.append(sound_object)
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simple playback to *create* and *manipulate* acoustic environments, transforming a room into a simulated sonic space. The dynamic, sensor-driven approach allows for real-time adaptation and personalization, creating a truly immersive and interactive audio experience.
