## Dynamic Issue ‘DNA’ & Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Extend the agent/issue association beyond simple history. Generate a dynamic ‘DNA’ profile for each issue based on keywords, sentiment analysis, and resolution steps.  Use this DNA to *predict* optimal agent pairings, even for entirely new issues.

**Specs:**

1.  **Issue DNA Generator:**
    *   Input: Raw issue text (customer input), resolution logs (if applicable), associated metadata (product type, account tier, etc.).
    *   Process:
        *   Keyword Extraction: Identify core concepts using NLP.
        *   Sentiment Analysis: Determine customer emotion (positive, negative, neutral, urgency).
        *   Resolution Step Sequence: If a previous similar issue exists, extract the sequence of steps taken to resolve it.  Represent this as a directed graph.
        *   DNA Vector Creation: Combine extracted data into a numerical vector.  The vector's dimensions represent the weight of each keyword, sentiment score, and resolution step.  Employ dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE) to manage vector size.
    *   Output:  Issue DNA Vector.

2.  **Agent Skill Profile:**
    *   Input: Agent interaction history (resolved issues, performance metrics, self-reported skills).
    *   Process:
        *   Skill Vector Creation: Similar to Issue DNA, generate a vector representing the agent's proficiency with various keywords, sentiment handling, and resolution step expertise.
        *   Continuous Learning: Update skill vector based on each resolved issue and associated performance metrics (resolution time, customer satisfaction).
    *   Output: Agent Skill Vector.

3.  **Predictive Routing Engine:**
    *   Input: Issue DNA Vector, list of available Agent Skill Vectors.
    *   Process:
        *   Similarity Calculation: Compute the cosine similarity (or another appropriate metric) between the Issue DNA Vector and each Agent Skill Vector.
        *   Ranking: Rank agents based on similarity score.
        *   Availability Check: Prioritize available agents.
        *   Dynamic Threshold Adjustment: Adapt the similarity threshold based on issue urgency (determined from sentiment analysis). Higher urgency = lower threshold.
    *   Output:  Recommended Agent ID.

4.  **Resolution Step Recommendation (optional):**
    *   Based on the DNA of similar issues, suggest a sequence of resolution steps to the agent.  This can be presented as a guided workflow within the agent's interface.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Routing Engine):**

```
FUNCTION find_best_agent(issue_dna, available_agents):
  agent_scores = {}
  FOR agent IN available_agents:
    similarity_score = cosine_similarity(issue_dna, agent.skill_vector)
    agent_scores[agent.id] = similarity_score

  sorted_agents = sort(agent_scores, descending=True)

  FOR agent_id IN sorted_agents:
    IF agent_id.is_available():
      return agent_id

  return select_random_available_agent()
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond simple historical pairing towards a more nuanced understanding of issue characteristics and agent expertise.  The ‘DNA’ concept allows for proactive matching, even for novel issues, and potentially improves resolution efficiency and customer satisfaction. The optional resolution step recommendation provides agents with guidance, particularly for complex issues.
