## Adaptive Audio Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leveraging the jitter buffer dynamics described in the provided patent, we can build a system that *reconstructs* the acoustic environment surrounding the audio source, rather than merely playing back the received stream. This moves beyond simple latency compensation to active environmental modeling.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Channel Jitter Buffer Array:** Instead of a single jitter buffer, implement an array of jitter buffers, each associated with a specific frequency band (e.g., using a Fast Fourier Transform to divide the audio into bands). Each buffer functions as described in the cited patent – dynamically adjusting size based on queuing delay events.

2.  **Directionality Estimation:**  Analyze the *timing differences* of queuing delay events across different frequency band jitter buffers. If a delay spike consistently precedes others across multiple bands, this suggests a directional component – the sound wave is arriving from a specific direction and reflecting off surfaces.

    *   Calculate Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) between frequency bands, weighting by frequency.
    *   Utilize a beamforming algorithm (simple delay-and-sum or more complex algorithms like MUSIC) to estimate the direction of the primary sound source.

3.  **Room Impulse Response (RIR) Modeling:** Use the TDOA and directionality information to dynamically generate a simplified RIR model.  The RIR will represent the acoustic characteristics of the room surrounding the audio source.

    *   A simplified RIR can be constructed using a series of delayed Dirac delta functions representing reflections.
    *   The delay times for each reflection are determined from the TDOA and directionality calculations.
    *   Amplitudes of the reflections are attenuated based on distance and surface absorption coefficients (initially estimated, then refined via machine learning – see section 5).

4.  **Acoustic Scene Enhancement:**  Convolve the incoming audio stream with the dynamically generated RIR. This process simulates the acoustic environment and allows for several enhancements:

    *   **Virtual Room Alteration:**  Modify the RIR to simulate different room sizes or acoustic characteristics.
    *   **Source Localization & Separation:**  Enhance the perceived location of the audio source.
    *   **Noise Reduction:** Reduce noise by modeling the acoustic environment.

5. **Machine Learning Refinement:** A reinforcement learning agent continuously refines the RIR model. The agent observes the effects of different RIR parameters on perceived audio quality (measured through user feedback or signal analysis) and adjusts the parameters accordingly.

**Pseudocode (RIR Generation):**

```
function generate_rir(tdoa_array, direction_vector, room_dimensions):
  rir = []
  for i in range(len(tdoa_array)):
    delay = tdoa_array[i]
    distance = calculate_distance(direction_vector, room_dimensions)
    amplitude = calculate_amplitude(distance)
    rir.append((delay, amplitude))
  return rir

function convolve_audio(audio_stream, rir):
  output_stream = []
  for i in range(len(audio_stream)):
    sample = 0
    for delay, amplitude in rir:
      if i - delay >= 0:
        sample += audio_stream[i - delay] * amplitude
    output_stream.append(sample)
  return output_stream
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance DSP or GPU for real-time RIR generation and convolution.
*   Multi-channel audio input/output.
*   Microphone array for improved directionality estimation (optional).
*   Machine learning accelerator for reinforcement learning.
