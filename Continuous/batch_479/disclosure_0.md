## Accelerated Data Weaving for Dynamic Graph Neural Networks

**Concept:** Extend the serial DMA approach to support dynamic graph neural networks by ‘weaving’ graph data alongside model weights, allowing for on-the-fly graph structure updates directly within the acceleration engine.

**Specification:**

*   **Core Component:** ‘Graph Weaver’ – A dedicated DMA engine operating in parallel with the weight DMA system.
*   **Data Format:** Graph data represented as edge lists with associated feature vectors (node/edge attributes).  Data is partitioned for each accelerator.
*   **Memory Architecture:** Each accelerator possesses a dedicated ‘Graph Buffer’ alongside the existing ‘Weight Buffer’.  These buffers are sized to accommodate the largest expected graph partition.
*   **DMA Operation:**
    1.  **Initial Load:** The entire graph structure (edge list, features) is DMA’d from external memory into the Graph Buffer of the first accelerator. This occurs *before* any weight loading.
    2.  **Serial Weaving:**  The Graph Weaver serially transfers graph partitions from the Graph Buffer of accelerator *n* to the Graph Buffer of accelerator *n+1*. This happens concurrently with weight DMA between accelerators.
    3.  **Dynamic Updates:** A ‘Graph Update Stream’ allows the host to inject small graph modifications (edge/node additions/deletions) during computation. The Graph Weaver manages these updates locally within each accelerator’s Graph Buffer, updating edge lists and feature mappings on-the-fly.  A versioning system tracks changes within each accelerator’s graph representation.
*   **Computational Model:** The processing engine array operates on the combined weight and graph data.  Sparse matrix operations are optimized for the edge list representation.
*   **Synchronization:** Event signals manage DMA completion and graph updates. A ‘Graph Sync’ signal ensures all accelerators have the latest graph version before a computation step.
*   **Pseudocode (Graph Weaver – simplified):**

```
function weaveGraph(graphData, acceleratorCount):
    for i in range(acceleratorCount):
        if i == 0:
            DMA_Load(externalMemory, accelerator[i].graphBuffer, graphData)
        else:
            DMA_Transfer(accelerator[i-1].graphBuffer, accelerator[i].graphBuffer, graphPartition)

function handleGraphUpdate(updateData, acceleratorID):
    accelerator[acceleratorID].graphBuffer.applyUpdate(updateData)
    accelerator[acceleratorID].graphVersion++

```
