## Adaptive Content Fragmentation & Dynamic Key Rotation

**Concept:** Enhance security and resilience against tampering *beyond* simple per-content-portion signing by dynamically fragmenting media content into variable-sized chunks *before* signing and introducing rotating cryptographic keys for each fragment. This moves beyond validating complete portions to validating smaller, frequently-secured segments, and complicates attacks requiring manipulation of large content blocks.

**Specs:**

**1. Content Fragmentation Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw media content (video, audio, etc.).
*   **Process:** Divides the content stream into variable-sized fragments. Fragment size is determined by a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded with:
    *   A globally unique stream identifier.
    *   A timestamp.
    *   A client-specific random salt (obtained during initial handshake - see Client Handshake Module).
*   **Output:** A sequence of content fragments, each with metadata including:
    *   Fragment ID (sequential number).
    *   Fragment Size (in bytes).
    *   PRNG seed values used for that fragment.

**2. Key Management & Rotation Module:**

*   **Function:** Generates and manages a pool of cryptographic keys.
*   **Process:**
    *   A primary key pair (public/private) is established for initial secure communication.
    *   For each content fragment:
        *   A new ephemeral key pair is generated.
        *   The ephemeral public key is included in the fragment metadata.
        *   The ephemeral private key is used to sign a hash of the fragment content.
*   **Security:** Ephemeral private keys are *never* stored and are destroyed after signing the fragment. Key rotation frequency is adjustable but should ideally be on the order of several fragments per second.

**3. Signing & Packaging Module:**

*   **Input:** Content fragments, fragment metadata (including ephemeral public keys), and primary private key.
*   **Process:**
    *   Applies a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to each fragment.
    *   Signs the hash with the ephemeral private key associated with that fragment.
    *   Packages the fragment, signed hash, and ephemeral public key into a secure container.

**4. Manifest Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** List of secure containers, primary public key, and Client Salt.
*   **Process:**
    *   Creates a manifest file containing:
        *   Primary Public Key.
        *   Client Salt (used for PRNG seeding).
        *   List of secure container locations (e.g., CDN URLs).
        *   Hash of the entire manifest (signed with the primary private key).

**5. Client Handshake Module:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Client initiates a secure connection with the provider network.
    *   Provider generates a random client salt.
    *   Provider sends the client salt to the client.
    *   Client stores the client salt for use in PRNG seeding.

**6. Client Verification Module:**

*   **Input:** Manifest, secure containers, Client Salt.
*   **Process:**
    *   Verifies the manifest signature using the primary public key.
    *   For each secure container:
        *   Retrieves the fragment, signed hash, and ephemeral public key.
        *   Uses the Client Salt, Stream ID, Timestamp and fragment metadata to re-seed the PRNG and derive the original fragment size.
        *   Verifies the fragment size using the derived seed.
        *   Verifies the signed hash using the ephemeral public key.
        *   If any verification fails, the fragment is discarded.



**Pseudocode (Client Verification Module):**

```
function verifyContent(manifest, containerList, clientSalt):
  if !verifyManifestSignature(manifest):
    return false

  for container in containerList:
    fragment, signedHash, ephemeralPublicKey = extractDataFromContainer(container)

    fragmentSize = reseedPRNG(clientSalt, streamID, timestamp, fragmentMetadata)

    if getFragmentSize(fragment) != fragmentSize:
        return false

    if !verifySignature(signedHash, fragment, ephemeralPublicKey):
      return false

  return true
```

**Rationale:**

This system increases security by:

*   **Reducing the attack surface:** Tampering with a single fragment requires breaking a different ephemeral key, making large-scale manipulation significantly more difficult.
*   **Dynamic keying:** Regularly rotating keys limits the usefulness of any compromised key.
*   **Fragment size obfuscation:** The PRNG-derived fragment size adds an extra layer of complexity.
*   **Improved resilience:** If a fragment is corrupted, only that fragment needs to be re-downloaded, not the entire content stream.
