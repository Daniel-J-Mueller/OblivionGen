## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Application State

**Specification:** A system to proactively allocate and deallocate system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to applications based on a predictive model of their future state, going beyond simple foreground/background transitions.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of reacting to state changes, *anticipate* them.  Build a model to predict likely application behavior (e.g., CPU intensive task starting, large data download imminent, period of inactivity) and adjust resource allocation *before* the state change occurs. This aims for smoother performance and improved resource utilization.

**Components:**

1.  **Application Behavior Profiler:** Monitors application resource usage over time. Tracks various metrics: CPU cycles, memory access patterns, network I/O, disk I/O, user interaction frequency.  Stores this data in a time-series database.

2.  **Predictive Model:** Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) trained on the data collected by the Application Behavior Profiler. The model predicts future resource needs.  Outputs a probability distribution for resource usage over a defined time horizon.

3.  **Resource Manager:**  Responsible for allocating and deallocating resources based on the predictions from the Predictive Model. Implements a resource scheduling policy that considers:
    *   Prediction confidence: Higher confidence in a prediction results in more aggressive resource allocation.
    *   Application priority:  Allows prioritizing critical applications.
    *   System load: Adapts allocation based on overall system resource availability.
    *   "Warm-up" allocation: Prefetching data or allocating a minimal amount of resources ahead of a predicted peak to minimize latency.

4.  **Virtual Memory Manager Extension:** Integrates with the existing virtual memory system. When the Predictive Model identifies a potential for increased memory usage, the extension proactively requests additional memory from the system.  If physical memory is scarce, it utilizes advanced compression techniques (similar to the provided patent) but *before* memory pressure becomes critical.

**Pseudocode (Resource Manager):**

```
function allocateResources(application, predictedResourceUsage, confidenceLevel):
  if confidenceLevel > threshold:
    requestedCPU = predictedResourceUsage.cpu * scalingFactor
    requestedMemory = predictedResourceUsage.memory * scalingFactor
    allocate(application, requestedCPU, requestedMemory)
  else:
    maintainBaselineAllocation(application)

function deallocateResources(application):
  releaseAllResources(application)
  maintainBaselineAllocation(application)

function maintainBaselineAllocation(application):
  allocate(application, baselineCPU, baselineMemory)
```

**Novelty:**

*   **Proactive, Not Reactive:** Existing systems typically react to state changes. This system *predicts* them.
*   **Dynamic Baseline:** The baseline resource allocation adapts based on long-term application behavior, not just a fixed value.
*   **Confidence-Based Allocation:**  Allocation decisions are weighted by the confidence in the predictions, minimizing unnecessary resource allocation.
*   **Integrated Pre-Compression:**  Proactively compress data *before* reaching critical memory limits, providing a smoother user experience.
