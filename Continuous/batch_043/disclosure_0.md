## Dynamic Content Weighting Based on Real-Time User Emotional State

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of webpage selection based on usage metrics, but introduces a real-time emotional state analysis component to dynamically adjust content weighting. The goal is to provide a hyper-personalized user experience, optimizing for engagement *and* emotional wellbeing, potentially reducing user 'depart rate' by proactively addressing negative emotional states.

**Components:**

1.  **User Emotion Sensor:** This can leverage multiple input modalities:
    *   **Webcam:** Facial expression analysis (using pre-trained models for core emotions – happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral).
    *   **Microphone:** Voice tone analysis (detecting stress, frustration, excitement).
    *   **Keyboard/Mouse Dynamics:** Analyzing typing speed, pressure, and mouse movement patterns (indicators of frustration or disengagement).
    *   **Physiological Data (Optional):** Integration with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers) to monitor heart rate variability, skin conductance, etc. (requires user consent).

2.  **Emotion Processing Engine:**  A machine learning model that fuses data from the User Emotion Sensor to determine the user's current emotional state (e.g., categorized as 'positive', 'neutral', 'negative', 'stressed', 'frustrated').  This engine should output a confidence score for each detected emotion.

3.  **Content Catalog:** An indexed database of available webpages and content modules. Each item is tagged with emotional attributes (e.g., ‘uplifting’, ‘calming’, ‘informative’, ‘challenging’). These tags are curated manually and updated based on user feedback.

4.  **Weighting Adjustment Module:**  The core of the system. It takes the user's emotional state and confidence score as input, and dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to different content modules within the Content Catalog.

5.  **Webpage Selection Component:** The existing component from the provided patent, now receiving dynamically weighted scores.

**Pseudocode (Weighting Adjustment Module):**

```
FUNCTION adjust_weights(user_emotion, confidence_score):

  // Define base weights (initial preference)
  base_weights = {
    "uplifting": 0.2,
    "calming": 0.2,
    "informative": 0.4,
    "challenging": 0.2
  }

  // Modify weights based on user emotion
  IF user_emotion == "negative":
    base_weights["uplifting"] += 0.3 * confidence_score
    base_weights["calming"] += 0.4 * confidence_score
    base_weights["challenging"] -= 0.2 * confidence_score
  ELSE IF user_emotion == "stressed":
    base_weights["calming"] += 0.5 * confidence_score
    base_weights["uplifting"] += 0.2 * confidence_score
  ELSE IF user_emotion == "frustrated":
    base_weights["calming"] += 0.3 * confidence_score
    base_weights["informative"] += 0.2 * confidence_score
    base_weights["challenging"] -= 0.3 * confidence_score
  // Else (positive/neutral) - keep base weights

  // Normalize weights to sum to 1
  total_weight = sum(base_weights.values())
  normalized_weights = {key: value / total_weight for key, value in base_weights.items()}

  RETURN normalized_weights
```

**Workflow:**

1.  User interacts with the website.
2.  User Emotion Sensor collects data in real-time.
3.  Emotion Processing Engine analyzes data and determines user's emotional state.
4.  Weighting Adjustment Module calculates dynamically adjusted content weights.
5.  Webpage Selection Component uses weighted scores to select optimal content.
6.  Content is presented to the user.

**Novelty & Potential Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Emotional Regulation:**  The system isn't just reacting to user behavior (like depart rate), but proactively attempting to influence emotional state.
*   **Hyper-Personalization:** Goes beyond demographic or behavioral data, incorporating real-time emotional context.
*   **Improved User Wellbeing:** Potential to reduce stress and frustration, increasing user satisfaction.
*   **Increased Engagement:**  By presenting content aligned with the user’s emotional state, it can maintain attention and reduce ‘depart rate’.

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Strong emphasis on user consent and data anonymization.  Options for disabling emotional analysis.
*   **Real-time Performance:**  Emotion processing must be fast and efficient to avoid latency.
*   **Model Accuracy:**  Robust emotion recognition models are crucial for system effectiveness.
*   **Content Tagging:**  A well-maintained content catalog with accurate emotional tags is essential.
