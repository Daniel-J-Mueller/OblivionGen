## Dynamic Network Persona Creation

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network gateway concept to allow customers to define and switch between “network personas” – pre-configured sets of network services and security policies – on demand. This shifts from simply *provisioning* a gateway to dynamically *transforming* its functionality.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition Interface:** A UI (or API) allowing customers to create personas. Each persona consists of:
    *   A name and description.
    *   A list of enabled network services (filtering, intrusion detection, encryption, QoS, etc.). Services are selected from a catalog provided by the service provider.
    *   Security policy definitions (firewall rules, access control lists, VPN configurations). Defined through a graphical interface or policy-as-code (e.g., YAML).
    *   Performance profiles (bandwidth allocation, latency targets).
    *   Associated metadata (intended use case – ‘development’, ‘production’, ‘guest network’).
*   **Persona Storage:** A database storing persona definitions. Metadata tagging allows for easy searching and categorization. Persona versions are maintained for rollback/auditing.
*   **Dynamic Gateway Configuration:**
    *   The virtual gateway instance monitors a “persona selection” signal from the customer. This signal can be triggered via UI, API, or automated rules (e.g., time of day, location, detected network conditions).
    *   Upon receiving a new persona selection, the gateway initiates a configuration update process. This process involves:
        *   Deactivating or adjusting existing network services.
        *   Activating and configuring the network services specified in the new persona. This may involve deploying new virtual machine instances or containers to host those services.
        *   Updating firewall rules and access control lists.
        *   Adjusting performance profiles.
    *   Configuration updates are performed in a phased approach to minimize service disruption. Traffic is progressively migrated to the new configuration.
*   **Service Orchestration Engine:** A component responsible for:
    *   Managing the lifecycle of network services.
    *   Ensuring that the required resources are available to host those services.
    *   Coordinating the configuration updates across multiple virtual network components.
    *   Monitoring the health and performance of network services.
*   **Automated Persona Recommendation Engine:** Optional component. Analyzes network traffic patterns, security events, and customer usage data to recommend appropriate personas. This could be integrated into the UI to provide proactive suggestions.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /personas`: Create a new persona.
    *   `GET /personas/{id}`: Retrieve a persona by ID.
    *   `PUT /personas/{id}`: Update a persona.
    *   `DELETE /personas/{id}`: Delete a persona.
    *   `POST /gateway/persona`: Select a persona for the gateway.
    *   `GET /gateway/persona`: Retrieve the currently selected persona for the gateway.

**Pseudocode (Gateway Persona Selection):**

```
function selectPersona(personaId):
    persona = getPersonaFromDatabase(personaId)
    if persona == null:
        return "Error: Persona not found"

    // Deactivate current services
    deactivateCurrentServices()

    // Activate new services
    for service in persona.services:
        activateService(service)
        configureService(service, persona.configuration)

    // Update Firewall
    updateFirewall(persona.firewallRules)

    // Update performance profiles
    applyPerformanceProfiles(persona.performanceProfiles)

    // Apply configuration
    applyConfiguration(persona.configuration)

    // Log action
    logPersonaSelection(personaId)
```

This enables customers to dynamically adapt their network infrastructure to changing needs without requiring manual configuration or hardware upgrades. Think of it as a "network chameleon" that can morph its behavior on demand.
