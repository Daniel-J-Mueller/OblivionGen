## Dynamic Data Affinity & Tiered Access Control

**Concept:** Extend access control beyond simple host migration to incorporate *data affinity* and tiered access permissions based on usage patterns *during* migration.  Instead of simply switching access from old host to new, dynamically adjust data access *tiers* based on real-time analytics of what data is being actively used by the migrating instance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Affinity Profiler:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitor read/write access patterns from the virtual compute instance.  This occurs *before*, *during*, and *after* migration.
*   **Data Collected:**
    *   Block/File access timestamps.
    *   Access frequency per block/file.
    *   Data size accessed per operation.
    *   Access type (Read/Write/Execute).
*   **Output:**  A dynamic 'affinity map' indicating hot, warm, and cold data blocks/files for the virtual instance.

**2. Tiered Storage Classes:**

*   Define three storage tiers:
    *   **Tier 0 (Hot):**  Ultra-low latency, high IOPS (e.g., NVMe SSD).  Used for frequently accessed data.
    *   **Tier 1 (Warm):** Moderate latency, moderate IOPS (e.g., SAS SSD). Used for less frequently accessed data.
    *   **Tier 2 (Cold):** High latency, low IOPS (e.g., SATA HDD or Object Storage). Used for infrequently accessed data.

**3.  Dynamic Access Control Manager:**

*   **Migration Trigger:** When a migration event is detected, the manager initiates the tiered access control process.
*   **Pre-Migration Phase:** Capture the current affinity map.
*   **Migration Phase:**
    *   Simultaneously establish connections to both the source and destination hosts.
    *   Based on the affinity map:
        *   **Hot Data:**  Replicate (or migrate) hot data to Tier 0 on the destination host.  Grant exclusive access to the destination host. Revoke access from the source host.
        *   **Warm Data:** Replicate warm data to Tier 1 on the destination host. Allow read-only access from the source host for a configurable period.
        *   **Cold Data:**  Leave cold data on the original storage. Implement a “pull” mechanism – the destination host requests cold data on demand.
*   **Post-Migration Phase:**
    *   Monitor access patterns on the destination host.
    *   Dynamically adjust data tiering based on new access patterns.
    *   De-provision resources as appropriate.
* **Control Mechanism:** Utilizes a lease system extending beyond simple host ownership. Each data block/file maintains a lease associated with the host and *tier*.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Access Control Manager - Migration Phase):**

```
function migrate_instance(instance_id, source_host, destination_host):
    affinity_map = get_affinity_map(instance_id)
    establish_connection(destination_host)

    for each data_block in affinity_map:
        if affinity_map[data_block] == "Hot":
            replicate_data(data_block, destination_host, Tier_0)
            revoke_access(data_block, source_host)
            grant_access(data_block, destination_host)
        elif affinity_map[data_block] == "Warm":
            replicate_data(data_block, destination_host, Tier_1)
            grant_readonly_access(data_block, source_host, timeout_period)
            grant_access(data_block, destination_host)
        else: // Cold Data
            implement_ondemand_pull(data_block, destination_host)
```

**4.  Monitoring & Analytics:**

*   Continuously monitor data access patterns and tier performance.
*   Provide analytics dashboards to visualize data tiering efficiency and identify opportunities for optimization.
*   Implement machine learning algorithms to predict future access patterns and proactively adjust data tiering.
