## Adaptive Quorum via Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the locality-based quorum concept by *predictively* adjusting quorum size and composition based on real-time failure analysis of slave nodes. Rather than a static `N-K+1` quorum, dynamically tailor it to minimize impact from anticipated failures.

**Specs:**

1.  **Failure Prediction Module:**
    *   Each slave node continuously monitors its own health (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network latency).
    *   Nodes report health metrics to a central "Predictive Analytics Service" (PAS).  PAS could be a distributed service itself.
    *   PAS employs time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) *and* machine learning (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) to predict the probability of failure for each slave node over a defined time window (e.g., next 5 minutes, next 30 minutes).  Feature engineering should include recent error rates, resource utilization trends, and correlated failures (historical data).
    *   PAS generates a "Failure Risk Score" (FRS) for each node, ranging from 0 (no risk) to 1 (high risk).

2.  **Dynamic Quorum Adjustment:**
    *   Master node queries PAS for FRS of all slave nodes *before* initiating a data update.
    *   Master node calculates a "Weighted Availability Score" (WAS) for each node: `WAS = 1 - FRS`.
    *   Master node selects the ‘K’ nodes with the *highest* WAS to form the quorum.  This prioritizes healthy, reliable nodes.
    *   The update is sent only to the selected quorum.
    *   Master node tracks the WAS for each node over time. If a node's WAS degrades significantly, it is automatically removed from future quorum selections.

3.  **Failure Detection & Handling Enhancement:**
    *   Instead of solely relying on timeouts, the Master node also monitors acknowledgements from the dynamically selected quorum.  
    *   If a node within the quorum fails to respond *before* the timeout, the Master node immediately re-requests the acknowledgement from a pre-selected 'shadow node' – a node with a similar WAS that was not initially included in the quorum. This reduces latency in failure scenarios.

4.  **Adaptive Weighting:**
    *   Introduce a weighting factor based on historical performance. Nodes that have consistently provided reliable acknowledgements should have a slightly higher WAS, increasing their chances of being selected in the quorum.

**Pseudocode (Master Node - Data Update):**

```
function updateData(data):
  // Get Failure Risk Scores from Predictive Analytics Service
  nodeScores = PAS.getFailureRiskScores()

  // Calculate Weighted Availability Scores
  nodeWAS = {}
  for node in nodeScores:
    nodeWAS[node] = 1 - nodeScores[node]

  // Select Top K nodes for Quorum
  sortedNodes = sort(nodeWAS.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
  quorumNodes = [node for node, was in sortedNodes[:K]]

  // Send update to quorum
  sendUpdate(data, quorumNodes)

  // Wait for acknowledgements
  ackCount = 0
  for node in quorumNodes:
    ack = waitForAck(node, timeout)
    if ack:
      ackCount += 1
    else:
      //Attempt recovery from Shadow Node
      shadowNode = getShadowNode(node)
      shadowAck = waitForAck(shadowNode, timeout)
      if shadowAck:
        ackCount += 1
      else:
        //Handle Failure (e.g., retry, escalate)
        logError("Failed to get ack from primary or shadow node")
        

  if ackCount >= minAckRequired:
    //Data update successful
    logSuccess("Data update successful")
  else:
    //Data update failed
    logError("Data update failed")
```

**Rationale:** This approach moves beyond static quorum selection. By incorporating predictive analysis, the system can proactively mitigate potential failures, reduce latency, and improve overall resilience. The shadow node recovery mechanism provides an additional layer of redundancy.
