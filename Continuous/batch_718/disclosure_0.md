## Portable, Decentralized Reputation System

**Concept:** Extend the portable data store concept beyond just credentials to encompass a user's reputation across various online services, managed locally and shared selectively.

**Specifications:**

**Hardware:**

*   **Secure Element:** A dedicated, tamper-resistant hardware module within the portable data store. This stores the user's reputation data, cryptographic keys, and executes reputation-related logic.
*   **Biometric Sensor:** Integrated fingerprint or facial recognition for secure access to the reputation data.
*   **NFC/Bluetooth:** For short-range communication with devices and potentially for selective "reputation sharing" with trusted contacts.
*   **USB-C Interface:** For data transfer and power.

**Software (Authentication Client - Enhanced):**

*   **Reputation Database:** A structured database within the portable data store storing reputation scores, ratings, endorsements, and verifiable claims from various online services (e.g., e-commerce platforms, social media, professional networks).  This will use a graph database structure â€“ entities (user, service, claim) and relationships (rated, endorsed, verified).
*   **Reputation Aggregation Module:** This module automatically collects reputation data from connected online services (with user consent). It can utilize APIs or web scraping techniques. Data is cryptographically signed by the source service.
*   **Selective Disclosure Protocol:** Allows users to selectively share portions of their reputation with specific parties. This utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable credentials.  Example: Share proof of "verified buyer" status with a seller without revealing purchase history.
*   **Reputation Scoring Algorithm:** Combines data from various sources into a unified reputation score, weighted based on trust and relevance.
*   **Dispute Resolution Module:** Enables users to contest inaccurate or unfair reputation ratings.  Could utilize a decentralized arbitration system (e.g., smart contracts).
*   **API/SDK:** For developers to integrate the portable reputation system into their applications.

**Pseudocode (Selective Disclosure):**

```
function shareReputation(recipient, claimType, parameters) {
  // 1. Retrieve relevant reputation data from database.
  data = getReputationData(claimType, parameters);

  // 2. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that the user meets the criteria for the claim.
  proof = generateZKP(data, claimType);

  // 3. Cryptographically sign the proof.
  signedProof = sign(proof, userPrivateKey);

  // 4. Transmit the signed proof to the recipient.
  send(recipient, signedProof);
}

function verifyReputation(proof, senderPublicKey) {
  // 1. Verify the signature.
  if (!verifySignature(proof, senderPublicKey)) {
    return false;
  }

  // 2. Verify the zero-knowledge proof.
  if (!verifyZKP(proof)) {
    return false;
  }

  // 3. Reputation is verified.
  return true;
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  User connects the portable data store to their device.
2.  Authentication client automatically synchronizes reputation data from connected online services (with user consent).
3.  When accessing an online service, the authentication client offers to share relevant reputation information.
4.  User selects what information to share.
5.  The authentication client generates a selective disclosure proof and sends it to the service.
6.  The service verifies the proof and adjusts its treatment of the user accordingly.
