**Dynamic Contextual Lockout – Behavioral Biometrics Integration**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Enhance account lockout thresholds not just based on password attempts & time since change, but integrating real-time behavioral biometrics to discern legitimate users from malicious actors *during* an attempt.

**II. Data Acquisition:**

*   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Capture typing speed, rhythm, pressure (if device supports), and error rates.
*   **Mouse/Touch Movement:** Track speed, acceleration, path complexity, and pauses.
*   **Device Orientation/Motion:** If accessing via mobile, track subtle movements and orientation changes.
*   **Network Characteristics:** Capture IP address geolocation, network latency, and device type.
*   **Time of Day/Week:** Incorporate typical access patterns for the user.

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Biometric Profiler:**  A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, anomaly detection) trained on historical user behavioral data to establish a baseline profile. Profile updates continuously, weighting recent behavior more heavily.
2.  **Real-Time Analyzer:**  Monitors user input during authentication attempts. Extracts behavioral features.
3.  **Risk Scoring Engine:** Combines the following inputs:
    *   Incorrect password count.
    *   Time since last password change.
    *   Deviation from the user’s behavioral profile (calculated by the Real-Time Analyzer).
    *   Network characteristics anomaly detection.
    *   Time of Day/Week deviation from norm.
4.  **Dynamic Lockout Adjustment:** Modifies the lockout threshold based on the risk score.  Higher risk = Lower Threshold. Lower risk = Higher threshold.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateRiskScore(user_id, keystroke_data, mouse_data, network_data, time_data)
  // Fetch user profile from database
  user_profile = GetUserProfile(user_id)

  // Calculate behavioral deviation scores
  keystroke_deviation = CalculateDeviation(keystroke_data, user_profile.keystroke_model)
  mouse_deviation = CalculateDeviation(mouse_data, user_profile.mouse_model)
  network_deviation = CalculateDeviation(network_data, user_profile.network_baseline)
  time_deviation = CalculateDeviation(time_data, user_profile.time_baseline)

  // Weighted sum of deviations
  risk_score = (0.4 * keystroke_deviation) + (0.3 * mouse_deviation) + (0.2 * network_deviation) + (0.1 * time_deviation)

  RETURN risk_score

FUNCTION AdjustLockoutThreshold(risk_score, base_threshold)
  //Scale factor to adjust the threshold
  scale_factor = 1.0 - CLAMP(risk_score, 0.0, 1.0)

  adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * scale_factor

  RETURN adjusted_threshold

//Authentication Flow
ON PasswordAttemptReceived(username, password)
  incorrect_attempts = GetIncorrectAttemptCount(username)
  base_threshold = GetBaseLockoutThreshold()

  risk_score = CalculateRiskScore(username, keystroke_data, mouse_data, network_data, time_data)
  adjusted_threshold = AdjustLockoutThreshold(risk_score, base_threshold)

  IF password == correct_password
    ResetIncorrectAttemptCount(username)
    RETURN Success
  ELSE
    IncrementIncorrectAttemptCount(username)
    IF incorrect_attempts >= adjusted_threshold
      LockAccount(username)
      RETURN AccountLocked
    ELSE
      RETURN IncorrectPassword
```

**V.  Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard server infrastructure for ML model hosting.
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time analysis of behavioral data.
*   Secure data storage for user profiles.

**VI.  Future Considerations:**

*   Adaptive learning: Continuously refine the ML model based on user behavior and attack patterns.
*   Multi-factor authentication integration: Combine behavioral biometrics with other authentication methods.
*   Integration with threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious actors.
*   Privacy-preserving techniques to minimize data collection and storage.
