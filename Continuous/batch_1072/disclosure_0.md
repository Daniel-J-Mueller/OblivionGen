## Dynamic Snapshot Composition with AI-Driven Resource Negotiation

**Concept:** Extend the snapshot technology to enable *composition* of snapshots from multiple sources, dynamically negotiating resource allocation and resolving conflicts using an AI agent. This allows for creation of highly customized environments beyond simple replication, incorporating elements from different templates and live systems.

**Specs:**

**1. Snapshot Manifest:**

*   **Data Structure:** JSON-based manifest file defining the snapshot composition.
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Custom Environment",
      "description": "A blended environment for testing",
      "sources": [
        {
          "type": "template",
          "id": "template_a",
          "priority": 1,
          "tags": ["web", "database"]
        },
        {
          "type": "live",
          "host": "production_server_1",
          "path": "/var/app",
          "priority": 2,
          "tags": ["data", "logging"]
        },
        {
          "type": "template",
          "id": "template_b",
          "priority": 0,
          "tags": ["analytics", "reporting"]
        }
      ],
      "conflict_resolution": "AI_AGENT",
      "resource_limits": {
        "cpu": "8 cores",
        "memory": "32GB",
        "disk": "500GB"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Fields:**
    *   `sources`: List of snapshot sources (templates or live systems).
    *   `priority`: Integer defining source importance (higher = higher priority).
    *   `tags`: Keywords describing source content.
    *   `conflict_resolution`: Strategy for resolving resource conflicts. Options: "AI_AGENT", "LAST_WIN", "FIRST_WIN".
    *   `resource_limits`: Constraints on total resource consumption.

**2. AI Negotiation Agent:**

*   **Functionality:** A trained AI model responsible for resolving resource conflicts and optimizing snapshot composition.
*   **Training Data:** Historical data on resource usage, performance metrics, application dependencies, and conflict resolution outcomes.
*   **Decision-Making Process:**
    1.  **Dependency Analysis:** Identify dependencies between resources from different sources.
    2.  **Conflict Detection:**  Identify conflicting resource requests (e.g., two sources requesting the same port).
    3.  **Resource Allocation:**  Assign resources based on priority, dependencies, and predicted performance impact.
    4.  **Negotiation:**  If conflicts persist, negotiate with source providers to adjust resource requests.
    5.  **Optimization:**  Optimize resource allocation to minimize cost and maximize performance.
*   **API:**
    *   `resolve_conflict(resource_request1, resource_request2)` -> `resource_allocation`
    *   `optimize_allocation(resource_allocation, performance_metrics)` -> `optimized_allocation`

**3. Snapshot Orchestrator:**

*   **Functionality:** A system component responsible for coordinating snapshot creation and instantiation.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Receive snapshot manifest.
    2.  Initiate snapshot retrieval from specified sources.
    3.  Invoke AI Negotiation Agent to resolve resource conflicts and optimize allocation.
    4.  Provision resources according to the optimized allocation.
    5.  Instantiate the composed snapshot.
*   **Monitoring:** Track resource usage and performance metrics during snapshot instantiation.

**4. Conflict Resolution Strategies:**

*   **AI_AGENT:** Leverage the AI Negotiation Agent for dynamic resource allocation.
*   **LAST_WIN:** The last source requesting a resource wins the allocation.
*   **FIRST_WIN:** The first source requesting a resource wins the allocation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function compose_snapshot(manifest):
  sources = manifest.sources
  negotiator = AI_Negotiation_Agent()

  allocated_resources = {}
  for source in sources:
    snapshot = get_snapshot(source)
    resources = snapshot.resources
    for resource in resources:
      if resource in allocated_resources:
        conflict = True
        resolution = negotiator.resolve_conflict(allocated_resources[resource], resource)
        allocated_resources[resource] = resolution
      else:
        allocated_resources[resource] = resource

  provision_resources(allocated_resources)
  instantiate_snapshot()
```

This system enables flexible and dynamic snapshot composition, allowing for creation of customized environments tailored to specific needs. The AI Negotiation Agent provides intelligent resource allocation and conflict resolution, maximizing efficiency and performance.
