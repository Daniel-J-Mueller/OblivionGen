## Dynamic Credential ‘Lifelines’ & Proactive Assistance

**Specification:** Implement a system where security credentials aren't just *verified* through knowledge-based questions, but actively *maintained* through a continuous ‘lifeline’ of assistance tailored to user behavior and potential compromise indicators.

**Core Concept:**  Move beyond one-time credential validation.  Instead, establish a persistent, low-friction assistance channel tied to the credential. This channel proactively offers help *before* a user is locked out or compromised, based on observed behavior.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometrics Engine:** Constantly monitor user interactions (typing speed, mouse movements, navigation patterns) across various services linked to the account. Deviations from established baselines trigger escalating levels of assistance.
*   **Contextual Assistance Profiles:**  Develop assistance profiles based on user roles, service usage, and perceived risk levels. A "power user" profile would tolerate more self-service options, while a "standard user" would prioritize guided assistance.
*   **Dynamic Question Pool:** Expand beyond static knowledge-based questions.  Include:
    *   **Real-Time Verification:** Questions tied to current activity (e.g., "What city is this transaction originating from?").
    *   **Behavioral Challenges:**  Simple tasks mirroring established behavioral patterns (e.g., a quick drag-and-drop puzzle mimicking typical navigation).
    *   **‘Helpful Hints’:**  Proactive guidance – “We noticed you’re accessing this service from a new location. Is this you?” with simple "Yes/No" options.
*   **Trust Score:** Calculate a dynamic “Trust Score” based on behavioral biometrics, assistance interaction history, and risk indicators. This score dictates the level of assistance required for each interaction.
*   **Automated Escalation:**  If assistance fails (user can't answer questions or fails behavioral challenges), automatically escalate to more robust verification methods (e.g., multi-factor authentication, live support).

**Pseudocode (Assistance Flow):**

```
FUNCTION HandleCredentialRequest(user, service, location, IP_address)

  TrustScore = CalculateTrustScore(user)

  IF TrustScore > Threshold_High THEN
    //Low Risk - Proceed with minimal verification
    RETURN True

  ELSE IF TrustScore > Threshold_Medium THEN
    //Medium Risk - Present dynamic questions
    Question = SelectDynamicQuestion(user, service, location)
    Response = PresentQuestionToUser(Question)

    IF ValidateResponse(Response, Question) THEN
      RETURN True
    ELSE
      //Escalate to MFA or higher
      EscalateVerification(user)
      RETURN False
    ENDIF

  ELSE
    //High Risk - Immediate escalation
    EscalateVerification(user)
    RETURN False
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION EscalateVerification(user)
  //Implement MFA, biometric scans, live support, etc.
END FUNCTION
```

**Innovation:** This system shifts from reactive security (verifying credentials *after* a request) to proactive security (continuously assessing user trust and offering assistance *before* issues arise).  It reduces friction for legitimate users while increasing security by adapting to individual behavior and risk profiles. It's not just about *what* you know, but *how* you interact.
