## Adaptive Predictive Masking with Frequency-Dependent Detail Levels

**Concept:** Extend the predictive masking approach by incorporating variable detail levels based on frequency analysis of prediction errors. The aim is to selectively refine predictions where they matter most, reducing overall data size while maintaining acceptable visual fidelity (or equivalent for non-visual data).

**Specs:**

1.  **Initial Mask Processing:** As in the provided patent, receive a binary mask and generate a predicted mask. Calculate a difference mask (filtered binary mask) representing prediction errors.
2.  **Frequency Domain Analysis:** Apply a 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) or similar frequency domain transform to the difference mask. This converts the spatial error data into frequency components.
3.  **Frequency-Based Thresholding:** Define a threshold frequency value. Frequency components *below* this threshold are considered ‘low-frequency’ errors (broad areas of consistent error). Frequency components *above* this threshold are ‘high-frequency’ errors (detailed, localized errors).
4.  **Detail Level Selection:**
    *   **Low-Frequency Errors:** Reduce the precision of the prediction for these areas. Instead of storing the exact pixel values of the error, store a generalized representation (e.g., an average value or a simplified pattern). This acts as a form of controlled lossiness.
    *   **High-Frequency Errors:** Maintain full precision for these errors. Detailed areas require accurate representation to avoid noticeable artifacts.
5.  **Adaptive Run-Length Encoding:** Extend the run-length encoding scheme.
    *   **Error Blocks:** Divide the difference mask into blocks.
    *   **Block Type Indicator:** Within each block, include a 1-bit indicator: ‘0’ for low-frequency block (simplified representation), ‘1’ for high-frequency block (full precision).
    *   **Encoding:** For low-frequency blocks, store a compressed representation of the generalized error (e.g., average value + color). For high-frequency blocks, apply standard run-length encoding to the pixel values.
6.  **Decoding:** Reconstruct the mask by reversing the process:
    *   Decode the compressed data.
    *   Based on the block type indicator, reconstruct the error block using either the simplified representation or the full-precision pixel values.
    *   Add the reconstructed error to the predicted mask.

**Pseudocode (Encoding):**

```
function encode_mask(binary_mask):
  predicted_mask = generate_predicted_mask(binary_mask)
  difference_mask = binary_mask - predicted_mask
  frequency_domain_mask = DCT(difference_mask)
  threshold_frequency = determine_threshold_frequency(frequency_domain_mask)

  compressed_sequence = []
  block_size = 16x16 # example block size

  for each block in difference_mask:
    block_frequency = analyze_block_frequency(block, threshold_frequency)

    if block_frequency == "low":
      average_error = calculate_average_error(block)
      compressed_sequence.append("0" + compress(average_error)) # 0 indicates low-frequency
    else:
      run_length_encoding = apply_run_length_encoding(block)
      compressed_sequence.append("1" + run_length_encoding) # 1 indicates high-frequency
  return compressed_sequence
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `compressed_sequence`: List of strings or bytes. Each element is either a block type indicator ("0" or "1") + compressed data for that block.
*   `frequency_domain_mask`: 2D array representing the frequency components of the difference mask.

**Refinements:**

*   **Adaptive Threshold:** Dynamically adjust the frequency threshold based on the overall content of the mask.
*   **Variable Block Size:** Adapt the block size based on the complexity of the image.
*   **Wavelet Transform:** Consider using a wavelet transform instead of DCT for better spatial localization of frequency components.
*   **Color Encoding:** For color images, encode color differences rather than luminance differences.
