## Personalized Wireless Service Bundling & Predictive Feature Adjustment

**Concept:** Leverage real-time usage data and machine learning to dynamically adjust a user’s wireless service plan *features* – not just data allowances – to optimize cost and satisfaction. This expands beyond simple plan upgrades/downgrades and into granular feature-level adjustments.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuous monitoring of application usage (with user permission) via a background service on the mobile device. Capture data points: application name, data usage (cellular/Wi-Fi), frequency of use, time of day, location (coarse-grained for privacy). System also polls for device sensor data (motion, ambient light) to infer activity (e.g., driving, working).
*   **Feature Catalog:** Database of wireless service features categorized by type (e.g., streaming quality, hotspot data allowance, international roaming rates, spam call filtering levels, data prioritization for specific apps). Each feature has an associated cost and impact score (predicted user satisfaction change).
*   **User Profile:** A dynamic model of user behavior and preferences built from acquired data. Includes: primary app usage, typical locations, time-of-day patterns, sensitivity to cost vs. convenience, stated preferences (from initial setup or surveys).
*   **Predictive Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, gradient boosted trees) trained on historical user data to predict future feature needs. Takes user profile, current feature set, and contextual data as input. Outputs a ranked list of recommended feature adjustments.
*   **Bundling Algorithm:** Combines predicted feature adjustments with a cost optimization algorithm. Aims to minimize the total cost of service while maximizing predicted user satisfaction. Considers both immediate and long-term cost savings.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Feature adjustments trigger dynamic pricing. Prices are calculated based on the current usage and the impact of the adjustment. A tiered pricing structure incentivizes users to accept adjustments that offer significant cost savings.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Dashboard:** Displays current service plan, usage statistics, predicted cost savings from accepting recommended adjustments, and a history of past adjustments.
    *   **Adjustment Recommendations:** Presents a clear and concise list of recommended feature adjustments, with explanations of the benefits and costs.  Uses a ‘slider’ interface to allow users to fine-tune adjustments.
    *   **Automatic Adjustment Option:** Allows users to enable automatic adjustment of features based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., “optimize for cost”, “optimize for performance”).
*   **API Integration:**
    *   **Carrier API:**  Interface with wireless carrier systems to implement feature adjustments and update billing information.
    *   **App Developer API:**  Allows app developers to integrate with the system and request prioritized data access for their apps (e.g., streaming video apps).
*   **Security & Privacy:**
    *   **Data Anonymization:**  User data is anonymized and aggregated to protect privacy.
    *   **User Consent:**  Explicit user consent is required before collecting and analyzing usage data.
    *   **Data Encryption:**  All user data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Engine):**

```
function predict_feature_needs(user_profile, current_features, contextual_data):
  // Load trained machine learning model
  model = load_model("feature_prediction_model")

  // Prepare input features
  input_features = {
    user_profile: user_profile,
    current_features: current_features,
    contextual_data: contextual_data
  }

  // Make prediction
  predictions = model.predict(input_features)

  // Rank predictions by predicted benefit
  ranked_predictions = sort_by_benefit(predictions)

  return ranked_predictions
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple data plan adjustments. It focuses on granular feature control, dynamic pricing, and proactive optimization based on predicted needs, not just historical usage. It creates a more personalized and cost-effective wireless experience.
