## Hardware-Bound Ephemeral Key Generation & Decay

**Concept:** Leverage the usage-limited hardware secret concept not for long-term secure operations, but for generating and *decaying* ephemeral cryptographic keys. Instead of protecting a single secret, the hardware enforces a lifecycle on keys derived from it. This is aimed at maximizing forward secrecy and mitigating risks from long-term key compromise.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Component:** Dedicated cryptographic co-processor with a usage-limited hardware secret.  This component *only* handles key generation and initial encryption. It doesn't participate in ongoing encryption/decryption.
*   **Key Generation Protocol:**
    1.  A ‘seed’ value (e.g., a timestamp, a nonce from the main processor, environmental data from a sensor) is provided to the cryptographic co-processor.
    2.  The co-processor combines the seed with its hardware secret using a Key Derivation Function (KDF) – e.g., HKDF-SHA256.  This generates an ephemeral key.
    3.  The co-processor *records* the number of key generation operations performed (incrementing a counter). This counter is tied to the usage limit.
    4.  The ephemeral key is returned to the main processor.
*   **Key Decay Mechanism:**
    1.  The co-processor’s usage limit isn’t a hard stop, but a trigger for ‘decay’.
    2.  As the usage limit approaches (e.g., 80%), the co-processor begins *introducing controlled entropy* into subsequent key derivations. This could be through slight modifications to the KDF process. The entropy introduced *increases* as the limit nears.
    3.  Once the limit is reached, any attempt to generate a new key results in a key which is statistically indistinguishable from random noise.  The system doesn't simply *fail*; it actively destroys any remaining security.
*   **System Integration:**
    1.  Main processor manages key lifecycle (creation, distribution, usage).
    2.  The main processor continuously monitors the co-processor’s usage counter.
    3.  Before the usage limit is reached, the system *proactively* initiates a key rotation process – generating a new hardware-bound key using a separate, identical co-processor.
    4.  Old co-processors are physically disabled (e.g., through fuse blowing) after the key rotation is complete.

**Pseudocode (Key Generation):**

```
function generateEphemeralKey(seed, usageCounter):
  if (usageCounter >= USAGE_LIMIT):
    return randomNoise() // Key is effectively destroyed

  derivedKey = HKDF(seed, hardwareSecret, usageCounter) // Incorporate usage counter

  //Introduce decay entropy approaching limit
  decayEntropy = calculateDecayEntropy(usageCounter, USAGE_LIMIT)
  derivedKey = XOR(derivedKey, decayEntropy)

  incrementUsageCounter(usageCounter) //Update usage

  return derivedKey
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   IoT devices requiring high forward secrecy.
*   Secure communication channels with limited lifespan requirements.
*   Temporary data encryption for extremely sensitive information.
*   Tamper-evident hardware security modules.
