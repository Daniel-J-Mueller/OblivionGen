**Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' for Predictive Cost Optimization & Autonomous Remediation**

**Concept:** Extend the cost-aware routing concept by proactively ‘shadowing’ potential network paths *before* traffic is routed. This involves running lightweight probes and synthetic transactions across multiple viable paths simultaneously, building a real-time predictive model of cost *and* performance, and then autonomously adjusting routing to avoid predicted congestion or cost spikes. This isn’t simply reacting to current conditions, but preemptively shaping traffic flow.

**Specs:**

*   **Probe Generation:** System generates small, varied probes (TCP SYN, UDP ping, HTTP GET to a neutral server) at configurable intervals (e.g., 1 probe/second/path). Probe size is minimal to avoid impacting production traffic.
*   **Shadow Path Selection:**  The system maintains a list of 'N' viable paths for each destination. 'N' is configurable. Path selection considers network topology, historical performance data, and current resource utilization.
*   **Data Collection & Analysis:** Each shadow path’s probes are tracked, measuring latency, packet loss, jitter, and cost (using existing cost information from the patent). A rolling average of these metrics is calculated. 
*   **Predictive Model:** Employ a lightweight time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA) to predict future cost and performance for each path. The algorithm considers seasonality (e.g., peak hour traffic) and trend.
*   **Cost Function:**  Define a cost function that combines monetary cost *and* performance metrics (latency, packet loss). This allows for balancing cost optimization with quality of service (QoS) requirements.  Example: `Cost = MonetaryCost + (LatencyWeight * Latency) + (PacketLossWeight * PacketLoss)`.
*   **Autonomous Routing Adjustment:**  If the predictive model indicates that a current path will exceed a predefined cost threshold (or violate QoS requirements) within a certain time window, the system automatically redirects traffic to a lower-cost (or better-performing) path.  This is done *before* actual performance degradation occurs.
*   **A/B Testing & Learning:** Implement an A/B testing framework to compare the performance of the autonomous routing system against a baseline (e.g., static routing, manual routing).  This allows for continuously optimizing the cost function and predictive model.
*   **Alerting & Visualization:**  Provide a dashboard that visualizes the predicted cost and performance of each path, along with alerts when potential problems are detected.
*   **Integration with Existing Network Infrastructure:**  The system should integrate with existing routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF) to dynamically update routing tables.

**Pseudocode (Autonomous Routing Adjustment):**

```
// For each destination:
For each path in viable_paths:
    predicted_cost = predict_cost(path) // Uses time-series model
    If predicted_cost > cost_threshold:
        // Redirect traffic to a lower-cost path
        redirect_traffic(destination, path, alternative_path)
        log_event("Traffic redirected due to predicted cost spike")
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers with low-latency network connectivity.
*   Large-scale data storage for storing probe data and historical performance metrics.
*   Machine learning libraries for time-series forecasting.
*   Network monitoring and management tools.
*   API integration with existing routing infrastructure.
