## Dynamic Resource Negotiation & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Extend distributed execution beyond static node allocation to a system where compute *requests* are negotiated in real-time, based on predicted resource needs, and potentially sourced from a broader range of providers beyond a single "program execution service." This introduces a market-based approach to distributed computation.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Resource Abstraction Layer (RAL):**

*   **Function:**  Abstracts underlying compute resources (nodes, VMs, containers, serverless functions) into standardized "Compute Units" (CUs) with defined characteristics (CPU cores, memory, GPU, network bandwidth, storage). This decouples the execution service from specific infrastructure.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `CU_Profile`: {`CU_ID`: `string`, `CPU_Cores`: `int`, `Memory_GB`: `int`, `GPU_Type`: `string`, `Network_Bandwidth_Mbps`: `int`, `Storage_GB`: `int`, `Cost_Per_Hour`: `float`, `Provider`: `string`, `Location`: `string`}
    *   `Resource_Pool`: `list` of `CU_Profile`

**2.  Predictive Scaling Engine (PSE):**

*   **Function:**  Analyzes program behavior (using historical data, profiling during initial runs, and real-time monitoring) to predict future resource demands.  Employs machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression) to estimate CPU, memory, network, and storage requirements over time.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Program code/metadata
    *   Input data characteristics
    *   Real-time performance metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, network I/O)
    *   Historical execution data
*   **Outputs:**
    *   `Resource_Request`: {`Timestamp`: `datetime`, `CU_Type`: `string`, `Quantity`: `int`, `Duration_Seconds`: `int`} - A list of resource requests over time.

**3.  Dynamic Negotiation Manager (DNM):**

*   **Function:**  Receives `Resource_Request` from PSE.  Negotiates with available resource providers (internal execution service, external cloud providers, edge compute nodes) to fulfill requests at optimal cost and performance.  Implements a bidding system.
*   **Algorithm (Simplified):**
    1.  For each `Resource_Request`:
        2.  Query all providers for available `CU_Profile` matching requirements.
        3.  Providers submit bids (price per hour, performance guarantees).
        4.  DNM selects provider(s) with best bid/performance ratio.
        5.  Allocate resources.
        6.  Monitor resource utilization and renegotiate if necessary (e.g., if actual usage deviates significantly from predicted usage).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Bid`: {`Provider`: `string`, `Price_Per_Hour`: `float`, `Performance_Score`: `float`}
    *   `Allocation`: {`Resource_ID`: `string`, `Provider`: `string`, `Duration`: `int`}

**4.  Distributed Execution Orchestrator (DEO):**

*   **Function:**  Deploys and manages program execution across allocated resources.  Handles data transfer, task scheduling, and fault tolerance.
*   **Implementation:**  Modified version of existing execution engine.

**Pseudocode (DNM):**

```python
def negotiate_resources(resource_request):
  providers = query_available_providers(resource_request)
  bids = []
  for provider in providers:
    bid = provider.submit_bid(resource_request)
    bids.append(bid)
  
  best_bid = select_best_bid(bids)
  allocation = allocate_resources(best_bid, resource_request)
  return allocation
```

**Novelty:**  The combination of predictive scaling, dynamic resource negotiation with a bidding system, and a resource abstraction layer creates a highly flexible and cost-effective distributed execution platform.  It moves beyond static resource allocation to a market-based approach, allowing programs to adapt to changing demands and optimize resource utilization.  The ability to source resources from multiple providers, including edge compute nodes, expands the scope of distributed execution beyond traditional cloud environments.
