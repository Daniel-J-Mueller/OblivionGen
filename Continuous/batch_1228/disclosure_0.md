## Dynamic Persona Projection

**Concept:** Augment the video stream of each device-sharing participant with a subtle, AI-generated "persona layer" visible only to remote participants. This layer isn’t a full avatar, but rather a dynamic set of visual cues – subtle facial expression adjustments, slight head pose variations, and stylistic color filters – that reflect inferred emotional state, engagement level, or even designated “role” within the conference (e.g., ‘leader’, ‘questioner’, ‘observer’).

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Raw video stream from each device-sharing participant’s camera. Audio stream for sentiment analysis. Designated participant ‘role’ (if assigned).
*   **Processing Modules:**
    *   **Facial Expression Analysis:** Real-time analysis of facial micro-expressions to detect baseline emotional state (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, neutral).
    *   **Engagement Detection:** Analyze head pose, eye gaze direction, and micro-movements to assess participant engagement level (focused, distracted, bored).  Potentially integrate audio analysis (speech rate, pauses) as a contributing factor.
    *   **Role Assignment:**  Conference host assigns a specific ‘role’ to each device-sharing participant (Leader, Presenter, Questioner, Observer, etc.). This can be manually set or dynamically assigned based on detected speaking time or other engagement metrics.
    *   **Persona Layer Generation:** AI-driven generation of subtle visual cues based on the outputs of the above modules.
        *   **Emotional Emphasis:**  Slight amplification of detected emotional expressions. Example: A slight upturn of the lips if happiness is detected, a subtle furrowing of the brow if concentration is high.
        *   **Engagement Indicators:**  Adjustments to color saturation and contrast to reflect engagement level. High engagement = vibrant colors, low engagement = muted tones. Subtle shimmering or glowing effects could be used for particularly engaged participants.
        *   **Role Differentiation:**  Distinctive stylistic filters or lighting effects to visually identify participants by their assigned role.  Leader = warm, golden glow; Presenter = focused spotlight; Questioner = subtle pulsing blue highlight.
*   **Output:** Augmented video stream with the applied persona layer, transmitted to remote participants.  Remote participants have an option to disable the persona layer for a raw video feed.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Utilize a lightweight, efficient AI model for real-time processing.
    *   Allow for customizable intensity levels for each visual cue.
    *   Implement a ‘smoothing’ algorithm to prevent jarring transitions in the persona layer.
    *   Ensure the persona layer is visually subtle and does not obstruct the participant’s face.
    *   Privacy considerations: Explicit consent from participants for persona layer activation.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
For each device-sharing participant:
    Capture video frame & audio sample
    Analyze facial expression (video) -> emotion_score
    Analyze head pose/gaze (video) -> engagement_score
    If role assigned: role_effect = get_role_visual_effect(role)
    persona_layer = create_persona_layer(emotion_score, engagement_score, role_effect)
    augmented_frame = apply_persona_layer(frame, persona_layer)
    transmit augmented_frame to remote participants
