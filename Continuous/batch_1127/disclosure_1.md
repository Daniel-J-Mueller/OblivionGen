**Dynamic Occlusion with Haptic Feedback**

**Concept:** Extend the contrast improvement system by introducing localized haptic feedback synchronized with the shuttering of individual pixels. This creates a more immersive experience by allowing the user to ‘feel’ the edges of projected images, enhancing the perception of depth and solidity.

**Specs:**

*   **Shutter Array:** Utilize the existing pixelated light shutter mechanism, but integrate micro-actuators behind each shutter element.
*   **Actuator Type:** Piezoelectric actuators are preferred due to their speed, precision, and low power consumption. Alternatives include micro-electromagnetic actuators or shape memory alloys.
*   **Haptic Range:** Actuators should be capable of producing subtle vibrations or localized pressure changes on the skin. Target range: 0.1mm – 1mm displacement.
*   **Control System:** The existing processor is augmented with a haptic driver to coordinate shutter control and actuator firing.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate skin contact sensors (capacitive or pressure-sensitive) into the areas contacting the user’s skin (temples, bridge of nose for AR glasses). These sensors detect skin contact and adjust haptic feedback intensity/pattern.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Edge Detection:** Implement an edge detection algorithm within the processor to identify the boundaries of projected images.
    *   **Haptic Mapping:** Map the detected edges to corresponding actuators.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Adjust haptic feedback intensity and frequency based on:
        *   Image depth (determined by rendering engine).
        *   User’s gaze direction (via eye-tracking – optional).
        *   Ambient lighting conditions.
    *   **Feedback Modes:** Implement different haptic feedback modes:
        *   **Static Edge:** Constant vibration at the edge of the projected image.
        *   **Dynamic Pulse:** Short pulses of vibration that “sweep” along the edge.
        *   **Texture Simulation:** Simulate textures by varying the frequency and intensity of vibrations.
*   **Power Management:** Implement power-saving modes to reduce energy consumption.
*   **Materials:** Use lightweight, biocompatible materials for the device’s construction.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Control Loop):**

```
// Initialization
initialize_sensors()
initialize_actuators()

// Main Loop
while (system_running) {
    image_data = get_image_data()
    edges = detect_edges(image_data)
    sensor_data = read_sensor_data()

    for each edge in edges {
        actuator_index = map_edge_to_actuator(edge)
        intensity = calculate_haptic_intensity(edge, sensor_data)  //consider ambient light, user distance
        activate_actuator(actuator_index, intensity)
    }

    // Deactivate all actuators not associated with an active edge
    deactivate_unused_actuators()

    delay(frame_time)
}
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Directional Haptics:** Implement actuators capable of producing vibrations in specific directions to simulate the shape and texture of projected objects.
*   **Thermal Feedback:** Integrate micro-heaters or coolers to provide thermal feedback in addition to haptic feedback.
*   **AI-Powered Haptic Optimization:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to optimize haptic feedback patterns based on user preferences and environmental conditions.
*   **Multi-User Synchronization:** Synchronize haptic feedback between multiple AR devices to create shared immersive experiences.
