## Dynamic Event Prioritization via Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend the event update system to dynamically prioritize events based on the user's real-time physiological state. Integrate wearable biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, brainwave activity via EEG) to assess user stress, focus, and emotional state.  Adjust event presentation order and detail level *during* update generation based on these factors, prioritizing events requiring immediate attention when the user is stressed, or providing more detailed context for events when the user is calm and receptive.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Integration Module:**
    *   Hardware: Support for Bluetooth/WiFi connectivity to common wearable sensors (Fitbit, Apple Watch, dedicated EEG headsets).
    *   Software: API for data ingestion and pre-processing of biofeedback signals. Includes calibration routines for each sensor type and individual user.
    *   Data Format: Standardized data format for representing physiological signals (e.g., time series of heart rate variability metrics, skin conductance levels, EEG band power).

2.  **State Assessment Engine:**
    *   Algorithm: Machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) trained to classify user state based on biofeedback signals. States include:
        *   High Stress: Elevated heart rate, increased skin conductance.
        *   Focused Attention: Alpha/Theta brainwave dominance.
        *   Relaxed/Receptive: Lower heart rate, stable skin conductance, moderate brainwave activity.
    *   Real-time processing:  State assessment performed continuously with low latency.
    *   Confidence Thresholds: Outputs a confidence score for each state classification.  Low confidence triggers a default state (e.g., “Neutral”).

3.  **Dynamic Prioritization Logic:**
    *   Event Tagging: Existing event tagging system extended to include “Urgency” and “Cognitive Load” attributes.
    *   Priority Adjustment Rules:  Rules-based system that adjusts event priority based on user state and event attributes:
        *   High Stress: Prioritize “Urgency = High” events, displaying only essential details (time, location, brief description).
        *   Focused Attention:  Display events in original order, providing detailed context and related information.
        *   Relaxed/Receptive: Display events in original order, with options to explore related events and perform associated actions.
        *   Low Confidence State:  Default to original event order with standard detail level.
    *   Adaptive Detail Level:  Event detail level adjusted dynamically. High-stress events displayed with minimal text/visuals. Calm/focused states allow for richer content (maps, images, links).

4.  **Update Generation Module Modification:**
    *   Integration with State Assessment Engine: Retrieve real-time user state from the State Assessment Engine before generating the update.
    *   Prioritization Rule Application: Apply the prioritization rules based on user state and event attributes.
    *   Adaptive Content Rendering: Generate update content dynamically based on adjusted event priority and detail level.

**Pseudocode (Update Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateUpdate()

  userState = GetUserState() // Returns state (HighStress, Focused, Relaxed, Neutral) & confidence
  events = GetEligibleEvents()

  FOR EACH event IN events
    event.priority = GetBasePriority(event) //Based on existing tags
    IF userState == HighStress
      event.priority = Max(event.priority, 9) //Boost Urgent events
      event.detailLevel = Minimal
    ELSE IF userState == Focused
      event.detailLevel = Detailed
    ELSE IF userState == Relaxed
      event.detailLevel = Detailed
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  sortedEvents = SortEventsByPriority(events)

  updateContent = GenerateContent(sortedEvents, event.detailLevel)

  OutputUpdate(updateContent)

END FUNCTION
