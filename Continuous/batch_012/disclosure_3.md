## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Echo Mapping

**Concept:** Expand sound source localization beyond pinpointing direction to *reconstruct* the acoustic environment, focusing on capturing reverberation and echoes to build a dynamic 'echo map' for enhanced audio processing and spatial awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones, spatial distribution configurable).
    *   High-resolution ADC (at least 24-bit, 96kHz sampling rate).
    *   Dedicated processing unit (FPGA or high-performance DSP).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Early Reflection Detector:**  Identifies and isolates early reflections using a modified SRP-PHAT (Steered Response Power – Phase Transform) algorithm. The modification centers on weighting the SRP-PHAT output based on arrival time *delays* – prioritizing reflections arriving within a defined temporal window after the direct sound.
    *   **Residual Echo Mapper:**  After direct sound and early reflections are isolated, this module handles the remaining reverberant tail.  It employs a recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive filtering approach. Each microphone acts as a reference, and the algorithm learns the impulse response of the environment in real-time.
    *   **Temporal Echo Map Generator:**  This module aggregates the data from the Residual Echo Mapper.  Instead of a static impulse response, it creates a *dynamic* 'echo map' – a time-varying representation of the reflections.  This map isn't a visual representation, but a data structure storing the amplitude and delay of echoes at various points in time. The map’s resolution is adjustable based on processing power.
    *   **Spatial Deconvolution Filter:** Using the generated temporal echo map, this module creates a spatial deconvolution filter. The filter’s goal is to separate overlapping sound sources and reduce reverberation. This is an iterative process.
*   **Algorithm Pseudocode (Temporal Echo Map Generation):**

```
// Input:  Microphone array data (multi-channel audio)
// Output: Temporal Echo Map (data structure: time -> [amplitude, delay])

function generateTemporalEchoMap(audioData, microphoneArray) {
  // 1. Isolate direct sound using SRP-PHAT (standard implementation)
  directSound = applySRPPHAT(audioData, microphoneArray)

  // 2. Subtract direct sound from original audio data
  residualAudio = audioData - directSound

  // 3. For each microphone:
  for (mic in microphoneArray) {
    // 4. Apply RLS adaptive filtering to estimate impulse response
    impulseResponse = applyRLS(residualAudio[mic])

    // 5. Extract echo information (amplitude & delay) from impulse response
    echoData = extractEchoData(impulseResponse)

    // 6. Aggregate echo data into temporal echo map
    temporalEchoMap.addEcho(echoData)
  }

  return temporalEchoMap
}
```

*   **Data Structure (Temporal Echo Map):**

```
class TemporalEchoMap {
  map = {} // Key: Time (ms), Value: [Amplitude (dB), Delay (ms)]

  addEcho(echoData) {
    time = echoData.time
    amplitude = echoData.amplitude
    delay = echoData.delay

    if (this.map[time]) {
      // Average amplitude and delay if time already exists
      this.map[time].amplitude = (this.map[time].amplitude + amplitude) / 2
      this.map[time].delay = (this.map[time].delay + delay) / 2
    } else {
      this.map[time] = { amplitude: amplitude, delay: delay }
    }
  }
}
```

*   **Applications:**
    *   Enhanced Voice Assistants: Improved noise cancellation and accurate voice command recognition in reverberant environments.
    *   AR/VR Spatial Audio: Realistic sound rendering that accounts for room acoustics and reflections.
    *   Acoustic Monitoring:  Detecting subtle changes in room acoustics for security or environmental analysis.
    *   Automated Room Acoustic Analysis:  Mapping room characteristics (reverberation time, reflection points) for architectural design.
