## Dynamic Fleet Persona Creation & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the system’s ability to manage fleets by introducing “Fleet Personas” – pre-defined configurations representing typical site usage patterns.  Couple this with a predictive scaling module that anticipates resource needs based on historical data *and* real-time event streams.

**Specs:**

**1. Persona Definition Module:**

*   **Input:**  A schema allowing definition of Fleet Personas.  Fields include:
    *   `persona_name`: (String) Descriptive name (e.g., "Peak Hour Shopper", "Content Publisher", "API Consumer").
    *   `resource_profile`: (JSON)  Specifies expected resource consumption:
        *   `cpu_demand`: (Float) Average CPU utilization (0.0 - 1.0).
        *   `memory_demand`: (Integer) Average memory allocation (MB).
        *   `network_bandwidth`: (Integer)  Estimated bandwidth (Mbps).
        *   `io_operations`: (Integer) Estimated disk I/O operations/second.
    *   `traffic_pattern`: (JSON)  Defines expected access patterns:
        *   `peak_times`: (Array of Timestamps)  Expected periods of high traffic.
        *   `geographic_distribution`: (JSON)  Probability distribution of user locations.
        *   `access_types`: (Array of Strings)  Common user actions (e.g., “browse”, “purchase”, “upload”).
    *   `associated_tags`: (Array of Strings) Tags for categorization.
*   **Output:** Stores Persona definitions in a dedicated datastore.  Allows versioning of Personas.
*   **API:**
    *   `create_persona(persona_definition)`
    *   `get_persona(persona_name)`
    *   `update_persona(persona_name, persona_definition)`
    *   `delete_persona(persona_name)`

**2. Real-Time Event Stream Integration:**

*   **Input:**  Connect to a real-time event stream (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis) capturing user activity on the site. Events should include:
    *   `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.
    *   `timestamp`:  Time of the event.
    *   `event_type`:  Type of action (e.g., “page_view”, “add_to_cart”, “api_call”).
    *   `resource_consumption`: (JSON)  Resource usage associated with the event.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Aggregate event data into time-series metrics (e.g., requests per second, CPU usage, memory usage).
    *   Use machine learning models to classify user behavior into existing Fleet Personas.
    *   Identify anomalies – behavior that doesn't fit any defined Persona.

**3. Predictive Scaling Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Fleet State Document (as defined in the original patent).
    *   Defined Fleet Personas.
    *   Real-time event stream metrics.
    *   Historical performance data.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Persona Matching:**  Assign each user session to a Fleet Persona based on real-time behavior.
    *   **Demand Forecasting:**  Predict future resource demand for each Persona based on historical data, current trends, and upcoming events (e.g., marketing campaigns, scheduled maintenance).  Utilize time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
    *   **Resource Allocation:**  Dynamically adjust resource allocation to each Persona based on predicted demand.  This includes:
        *   Scaling up/down the number of compute instances.
        *   Adjusting CPU/memory allocations.
        *   Optimizing network bandwidth.
        *   Provisioning load balancing resources.
    *   **Anomaly Detection & Mitigation:**  If anomalous behavior is detected, trigger alerts and initiate corrective actions (e.g., temporary resource scaling, traffic throttling).

**4. Workflow Integration:**

*   Integrate the Predictive Scaling Engine into the existing workflow engine.
*   The workflow engine should be able to:
    *   Receive scaling recommendations from the Predictive Scaling Engine.
    *   Execute the necessary actions to scale resources.
    *   Monitor the performance of the system after scaling.
    *   Provide feedback to the Predictive Scaling Engine to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Scaling Engine):**

```
function predict_demand(persona, historical_data, current_trends, events):
  # Time series forecasting model
  predicted_resource_usage = model.predict(historical_data, current_trends, events)
  return predicted_resource_usage

function allocate_resources(predicted_usage, current_resources):
  # Determine resource gap
  resource_gap = predicted_usage - current_resources

  # Adjust resources accordingly
  if resource_gap > 0:
    scale_up(resource_gap)
  elif resource_gap < 0:
    scale_down(abs(resource_gap))

function scale_up(resource_gap):
  # Provision additional resources
  provision_instances(resource_gap)
  update_load_balancer()

function scale_down(resource_gap):
  # De-provision resources
  de_provision_instances(resource_gap)
  update_load_balancer()

# Main loop
for each user_session in event_stream:
  persona = classify_user(user_session)
  predicted_usage = predict_demand(persona, historical_data, current_trends, events)
  allocate_resources(predicted_usage, current_resources)
```

This system moves beyond simply *reacting* to changes in site traffic and proactively anticipates demand, enabling more efficient resource utilization and improved user experience.
