**Adaptive Meta-Material Lens Array for Dynamic Focal Plane Control**

**Concept:** Implement a lens system using a dynamically configurable array of meta-materials. Instead of mechanically adjusting focal length, or relying solely on digital stabilization, the meta-material array alters the refractive index of individual elements to achieve real-time, localized focal adjustments. This allows for a system that optimizes image clarity not just for overall stabilization, but for specific points of interest within the frame, predicting object movement *before* it happens.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Dimensions:** 64x64 elements, each element 1mm x 1mm.
*   **Meta-Material Composition:** Liquid crystal elastomer infused with nanoparticles (Titanium Dioxide preferred) for adjustable refractive index control.
*   **Actuation:** Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) based micro-heaters for localized temperature control, influencing liquid crystal alignment and refractive index. Individual control of each element.
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Direct integration with the secondary imaging device from the patent. The secondary sensor feeds data to a predictive algorithm. 
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on motion patterns and object recognition data. The RNN predicts the future location of objects of interest.
*   **Control System:** FPGA-based system for real-time control of MEMS heaters based on RNN output.
*   **Power Requirements:** < 5W.
*   **Communication:** SPI interface to primary sensor control unit.

**Operation:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Primary and secondary sensors capture images simultaneously.
2.  **Motion Prediction:**  The RNN analyzes secondary sensor data to predict the trajectory of objects.
3.  **Refractive Index Mapping:** The control system calculates the optimal refractive index for each element in the array, to focus on predicted object locations.
4.  **Array Activation:** MEMS heaters are activated, locally changing the temperature of meta-material elements, thereby modulating their refractive index.
5.  **Dynamic Focusing:** Light rays from the primary sensor are dynamically bent, creating a sharp image of moving objects.
6.  **Iterative Refinement:**  The secondary sensor provides continuous feedback, allowing the system to refine the refractive index mapping in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
initialize RNN
initialize Meta-Material Array

while (capturing video):
  capture primary_image, secondary_image
  predicted_locations = RNN.predict(secondary_image)
  refractive_index_map = calculate_refractive_index_map(predicted_locations)
  set_meta_material_array(refractive_index_map)
  capture_stabilized_image
  update_RNN(stabilized_image)
end while
```
