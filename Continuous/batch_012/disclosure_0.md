## Dynamic Proximity-Based Collaborative Tasking

**Concept:** Leveraging location awareness not just for reminders, but to dynamically assign and manage collaborative tasks based on proximity to shared resources or other users. This expands the patent's focus from individual reminders to real-time, distributed workload management.

**Specs:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   *Task Server:* Central repository for tasks, user profiles, resource maps.
    *   *Mobile Client (App):* Runs on user devices, handles location tracking, task display, status updates.
    *   *Resource Map Database:* Stores locations and attributes of shared resources (e.g., equipment, supplies, meeting rooms).
*   **Communication:**  Secure, real-time communication via RESTful APIs or WebSockets.

**2. Location Tracking & Proximity Detection:**

*   **Location Sources:** GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons, cellular tower data.  Prioritize based on accuracy and power consumption.
*   **Proximity Definition:** Configurable proximity zones (e.g., "nearby", "within building", "within 10 meters"). Zones defined dynamically based on task requirements.
*   **Geofencing:** Utilize geofencing to trigger task assignment when users enter/exit specific areas.

**3. Task Management & Assignment:**

*   **Task Definition:** Tasks have attributes:  description, priority, estimated completion time, required skills, resources, assigned user(s), location.
*   **Dynamic Assignment:** The system continuously scans for users within proximity to available tasks, matching user skills and task requirements.
*   **Collaborative Tasks:** Support for tasks requiring multiple users, with role assignment (e.g., “lead”, “assistant”).
*   **Task Escalation:** If a task remains unassigned for a defined period, escalate to users with broader skillsets or higher priority.

**4. User Interface (Mobile App):**

*   **Task List:** Displays assigned tasks, due dates, priority, and location.
*   **Map View:**  Visualize tasks and nearby users on a map.
*   **Real-time Status Updates:**  Users can update task status (e.g., “in progress”, “completed”, “blocked”).
*   **Communication Channel:** In-app messaging for task-related communication.
*   **Skill Profile:**  Users maintain a profile of their skills and availability.

**5. Pseudocode (Task Assignment Logic):**

```
FUNCTION AssignTask(task):
    available_users = GetAvailableUsers(task.required_skills)
    nearby_users = GetNearbyUsers(task.location, 50 meters)  // Adjust radius as needed
    eligible_users = INTERSECTION(available_users, nearby_users)
    IF eligible_users is EMPTY:
        ExpandSearchRadius()
        eligible_users = GetNearbyUsers(task.location, expanded_radius)
    IF eligible_users is EMPTY:
        EscalateTask(task)
    ELSE:
        best_user = SelectBestUser(eligible_users, task)  // Prioritize based on availability, workload, etc.
        AssignTaskToUser(task, best_user)
        NotifyUser(best_user, task)

FUNCTION SelectBestUser(users, task):
    // Implement logic to prioritize users based on criteria
    // (e.g., lowest current workload, highest skill match, proximity)
    RETURN best_user
```

**6.  Resource Integration:**

*   **Resource Mapping:**  Maintain a digital map of shared resources (equipment, supplies, meeting rooms).
*   **Resource Allocation:**  Tasks can be assigned based on proximity to necessary resources.
*   **Resource Availability Tracking:** Track resource availability and automatically adjust task assignments.
