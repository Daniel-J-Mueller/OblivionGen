## Dynamic Application ‘Shadowing’ with Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the deployment process with a ‘shadow’ deployment that runs in parallel with the existing production application. This shadow monitors real-world user interactions and performance metrics *before* fully switching over. The system predicts potential failures based on discrepancies between the shadow and production environments, and automatically rolls back *before* impacting users.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Environment Creation:** The deployment service automatically provisions a scaled-down replica of the production environment (using the existing infrastructure/cloud provider integrations).  This isn't a full-scale copy, but a representative sample based on expected load.
*   **Traffic Mirroring:** A configurable percentage of live production traffic is mirrored to the shadow environment. This mirroring happens at the load balancer/ingress controller level.  The mirrored traffic *does not* impact actual production responses.
*   **Telemetry Comparison:** A dedicated telemetry pipeline aggregates metrics from both production and shadow environments (response times, error rates, resource utilization, logs). These metrics are correlated by request ID (where available) or statistically compared based on user segments/endpoints.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  A machine learning model (trained on historical data) identifies anomalies in the telemetry comparison.  Anomalies are weighted based on severity (e.g., a spike in 5xx errors is more severe than a slight increase in latency).
*   **Predictive Rollback Trigger:** If the anomaly score exceeds a predefined threshold, the system *automatically* initiates a rollback to the previous known-good version. The rollback process utilizes the existing deployment infrastructure and prioritizes minimal downtime. 
*   **Rollback Validation:** After rollback, the system monitors the restored version to confirm stability before fully restoring traffic.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `shadowPercentage`: Percentage of traffic mirrored to the shadow environment (0-100).
    *   `anomalyThreshold`: Score required to trigger rollback.
    *   `validationPeriod`: Duration to monitor the restored version after rollback.
    *   `mirroringStrategy`: (e.g., Random, Geographic, User Segment).

**Pseudocode (Rollback Trigger):**

```
function checkRollbackCondition(productionTelemetry, shadowTelemetry) {
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(productionTelemetry, shadowTelemetry);

  if (anomalyScore > configuration.anomalyThreshold) {
    initiateRollback();
    return true;
  }

  return false;
}

function initiateRollback() {
  // Step 1: Pause traffic to the current version
  pauseTraffic();

  // Step 2: Deploy previous known-good version
  deployPreviousVersion();

  // Step 3: Monitor restored version for stability (validationPeriod)
  monitorStability();
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Synthetic Transactions:** Incorporate synthetic transactions in the shadow environment to proactively test critical functionality.
*   **Chaos Engineering Integration:**  Use the shadow environment to run controlled chaos experiments (e.g., injecting latency, simulating service failures).
*   **A/B Testing:** Leverage the shadow environment for A/B testing new features.
*   **Adaptive Shadowing:** Dynamically adjust the shadow percentage based on the severity of anomalies or the stability of the current version.
