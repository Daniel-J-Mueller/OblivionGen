## Adaptive Ultrasonic Field Shaping for Enhanced Presence Detection

**Concept:** Instead of relying solely on Doppler shift analysis of reflected ultrasonic waves, we can actively shape the ultrasonic field emitted by the loudspeaker to create "zones" of sensitivity within the environment. This allows for more precise detection and discrimination of movement, particularly in complex spaces or when multiple objects are present.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Loudspeaker Array: Replace the single loudspeaker with a phased array consisting of multiple ultrasonic transducers. Each transducer will be individually controllable in terms of amplitude and phase. Minimum 16 transducers, optimally 64 or 128.
    *   Microphone Array: Complement the loudspeaker array with a corresponding microphone array. This allows for beamforming and improved signal-to-noise ratio. Minimum 4 microphones, optimally 16 or 32.
    *   DSP/FPGA: Dedicated digital signal processing unit or field-programmable gate array for real-time control of the loudspeaker array and processing of microphone signals.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   Environment Mapping: System performs initial scan to build a rudimentary 3D map of the environment using the microphone and loudspeaker array. This can be accomplished by emitting a wideband ultrasonic sweep and analyzing the reflections.
    *   Zone Definition: User or system defines zones within the mapped environment. Zones can be defined as areas of interest (e.g., doorway, seating area) or areas to ignore.
    *   Beamforming & Steering: DSP/FPGA controls the amplitude and phase of each transducer in the loudspeaker array to create highly focused ultrasonic beams directed towards defined zones. This focuses the emitted energy, increasing sensitivity within those zones.
    *   Null Steering: Simultaneously, the system creates nulls (areas of reduced sensitivity) in the ultrasonic field to minimize interference from reflections off static objects or areas outside the zones of interest.
    *   Adaptive Beamforming: Implement an adaptive beamforming algorithm that continuously adjusts the ultrasonic field based on the real-time analysis of the microphone signals. This allows the system to compensate for changes in the environment (e.g., moving furniture) and improve detection accuracy.
    *   Doppler Shift Analysis: Continue to utilize Doppler shift analysis of the reflected ultrasonic waves, but now focus specifically on signals originating from within the defined zones.
    *   Multi-Frequency Emission: Experiment with emitting multiple ultrasonic frequencies simultaneously. Different frequencies may be more effective at detecting movement in different materials or under different conditions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
mapEnvironment()
defineZones()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Shape Ultrasonic Field
    shapeField(zones)

    // 2. Emit Ultrasonic Signal
    emitSignal()

    // 3. Receive and Process Signals
    receivedSignals = receiveSignals()
    processedSignals = processSignals(receivedSignals)

    // 4. Analyze Doppler Shift and Zone Activity
    motionDetected = analyzeMotion(processedSignals)

    // 5. Adaptive Adjustment
    adjustField(motionDetected)
}

//Helper Functions
function shapeField(zones) {
    for each zone {
        calculate transducer phase/amplitude to focus energy on zone
        calculate transducer phase/amplitude to create nulls outside zone
        apply settings to transducer array
    }
}

function adjustField(motionDetected) {
    if (motionDetected) {
        refine focus on zone
        increase signal power
    } else {
        reduce signal power
        optimize for low power consumption
    }
}
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   Improved accuracy and reliability of presence detection.
*   Reduced false positives caused by static objects or noise.
*   Ability to detect movement in complex environments.
*   Enhanced privacy by focusing detection only on specific zones.
*   Lower power consumption by reducing the overall emitted ultrasonic energy.
