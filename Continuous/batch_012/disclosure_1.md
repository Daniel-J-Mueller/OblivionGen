## Temporal Attention Graph for Multi-Granularity Demand Forecasting

**System Specifications:** A system for forecasting demand leveraging a Temporal Attention Graph (TAG). This builds upon the recurrent neural network concepts, but moves beyond simple time-series analysis to incorporate relationships *between* items and different time scales simultaneously.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of treating each item’s demand forecast in isolation, construct a dynamic graph where nodes represent items and edges represent learned dependencies.  Crucially, this graph isn't static; it evolves over time, reflecting changing relationships driven by external factors and inherent seasonal/cyclical patterns. Different temporal resolutions are incorporated via multiple graph layers.

**Components:**

1.  **Multi-Resolution Data Ingestion:** Input data includes historical demand, price, promotions, external events (weather, holidays), and item metadata (category, attributes).  This data is preprocessed and aggregated into multiple temporal resolutions:
    *   **Fine-Grained:** Daily or hourly data.
    *   **Mid-Grained:** Weekly or monthly data.
    *   **Coarse-Grained:** Quarterly or yearly data.

2.  **Embedding Layer:** Each item and time step is represented by an embedding vector. Item embeddings capture inherent item characteristics.  Time step embeddings capture seasonality and cyclical patterns.

3.  **Dynamic Graph Construction:**
    *   **Initial Graph:** An initial graph is created based on item metadata (e.g., items in the same category are connected).
    *   **Attention Mechanism:** An attention mechanism learns weights for connections between items at each time step. This attention is calculated based on the current demand patterns, price, promotions, and external events. The attention weights represent the strength of the dependency between items.
    *   **Graph Update:** The graph is updated at each time step based on the attention weights. Connections with higher weights are strengthened, while connections with lower weights are weakened.

4.  **Multi-Layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):** A GCN processes the dynamic graph.  Multiple GCN layers are stacked to capture complex relationships between items.  Each layer aggregates information from neighboring nodes, allowing the model to learn how demand for one item affects demand for other items. Different layers will be focused on different temporal resolutions.

5.  **Temporal Recurrent Layer:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) or Transformer processes the output of the GCN over time. This layer captures temporal dependencies and generates demand forecasts for each item. The output is blended across temporal resolutions.

6.  **Probabilistic Forecasting:** The model outputs a probability distribution for each item’s demand, allowing for risk assessment and inventory optimization.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
# Input: Historical demand, item metadata, external events
# Output: Probabilistic demand forecasts

# 1. Data Ingestion & Embedding
item_embeddings = embed_items(item_metadata)
time_embeddings = embed_time(historical_demand)

# 2. Dynamic Graph Construction
initial_graph = create_initial_graph(item_metadata)

for time_step in range(forecast_horizon):
  # Calculate attention weights based on current demand, price, promotions
  attention_weights = calculate_attention(historical_demand[time_step], price[time_step], promotions[time_step])

  # Update graph based on attention weights
  graph = update_graph(initial_graph, attention_weights)

  # 3. Graph Convolutional Network
  node_features = graph_convolution(graph, node_features)

  # 4. Temporal Recurrent Layer
  demand_forecasts = temporal_rnn(node_features)

  # 5. Probabilistic Forecasting
  probabilistic_forecasts = generate_probabilistic_forecasts(demand_forecasts)

return probabilistic_forecasts
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Accuracy:** Capturing relationships between items can lead to more accurate demand forecasts.
*   **Robustness:** The model can handle missing data and unexpected events more effectively.
*   **Interpretability:** The dynamic graph provides insights into the factors driving demand.
*   **Scalability:** The GCN can handle large numbers of items and time steps.
