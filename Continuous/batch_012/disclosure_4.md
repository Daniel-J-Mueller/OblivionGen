## Dynamic Query "Mood" Assessment & Adaptive Interface

**Concept:** Extend the fingerprinting beyond *actions* to infer the user's emotional “mood” during the query process, and dynamically adapt the interface to cater to that inferred state. This isn’t about identifying *what* the user is looking for, but *how* they’re feeling *while* looking.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:**  Beyond action tracking (clicks, scrolls, time spent), integrate:
    *   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Capture typing speed, rhythm, and error rates.  Frustration might manifest as increased errors/speed fluctuations.
    *   **Mouse/Touch Movement Analysis:** Jerky vs. smooth movements, pressure sensitivity (if available), hesitation points.
    *   **Optional Webcam Input (User Opt-In):** Basic facial expression analysis (valence & arousal – happy/sad, excited/calm). *Strict privacy controls and transparency are paramount.*
*   **Real-Time Feature Extraction:**  All data streams are processed in real-time to extract relevant features.

**2. Mood Inference Engine:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a labeled dataset of user behavior patterns and corresponding mood states (e.g., frustrated, curious, decisive, overwhelmed).  The dataset must be diverse and representative.  Transfer learning can be employed, starting with pre-trained models on human emotion recognition.
*   **Mood Categories:**  Initial categories:
    *   **Exploratory:** Slow, deliberate movements, frequent back-tracking, varied search terms.
    *   **Focused:**  Fast, direct movements, specific search terms, minimal back-tracking.
    *   **Frustrated:**  Rapid, jerky movements, frequent errors, repeated queries with slight variations, abandonment of long queries.
    *   **Overwhelmed:**  Slow, hesitant movements, large result set browsing without interaction.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** The model assigns a confidence score to each mood category.

**3. Adaptive Interface Components:**

*   **Visual Theme Adjustment:**
    *   **Frustrated:** Calming color palettes (blues, greens), simplified layout, reduced visual clutter.
    *   **Overwhelmed:**  Increased whitespace, highlighting key information, progressive disclosure of features.
    *   **Exploratory:**  Vibrant colors, visually engaging layouts, promotion of related categories.
*   **Search Suggestion & Filtering Adaptation:**
    *   **Frustrated:** Suggest broader, more general search terms.  Highlight options for resetting or simplifying the query.
    *   **Focused:**  Suggest more specific filters and refinements.
    *   **Exploratory:**  Suggest related categories and browseable topics.
*   **Help & Guidance Integration:**
    *   **Frustrated/Overwhelmed:** Proactively offer contextual help and tutorials.
    *   **Focused:**  Provide advanced search options and keyboard shortcuts.
*   **"Mood Reset" Button:** Allow users to manually override the inferred mood and reset the interface.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side Data Collection:**  JavaScript-based sensors capture user interaction data.
*   **Secure Data Transmission:** Data is securely transmitted to a server-side processing pipeline.
*   **Server-Side Processing:** The mood inference engine analyzes the data and generates interface adaptation instructions.
*   **Real-Time Interface Updates:** Instructions are sent back to the client-side to dynamically update the interface.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function collectInteractionData() {
  // Capture keystroke dynamics, mouse/touch movements, etc.
  let data = {
    keystrokes: [...],
    mouseMovements: [...],
    // ... other data
  };
  return data;
}

function sendDataToServer(data) {
  // Securely transmit data to the server
}

function receiveInterfaceInstructions(instructions) {
  // Apply instructions to update the interface (e.g., change color theme, filters)
}

// Main loop
setInterval(() => {
  let data = collectInteractionData();
  sendDataToServer(data);

  // Receive and apply instructions (asynchronously)
}, 100ms);
```

**Data Storage:**  Anonymized and aggregated interaction data can be used to improve the accuracy of the mood inference engine over time. User privacy must be protected at all costs.  Strict data anonymization techniques and opt-in consent mechanisms are essential.
