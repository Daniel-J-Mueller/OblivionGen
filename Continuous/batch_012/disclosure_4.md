## Dynamic Volumetric Capture & Haptic Feedback System

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the light field/light curtain concept of the provided patent, but expands it into a full volumetric capture and haptic feedback loop. Instead of solely calculating an area of interaction, this aims to *recreate* the interacting object within a localized volumetric display, coupled with force feedback.

**Core Components:**

1.  **High-Density Emitter/Receiver Array:** A spherical or cubical arrangement of rapidly-switching infrared (IR) emitters and receivers.  Far more emitters/receivers than the patent describes – think thousands, covering a volume of approximately 1 cubic meter. Different wavelengths of IR for each emitter will be used to differentiate individual light paths.
2.  **Time-of-Flight Processing Unit:** Dedicated hardware to precisely measure the time-of-flight of each IR emission and its return. This will generate a dense point cloud representing the surface of the interacting object.
3.  **Volumetric Display Matrix:** A display comprised of rapidly-switching acoustic transducers (ultrasound). This will create a 3D volumetric image by focusing ultrasound waves to create cavitation bubbles in a gas (argon, for example). The density of these bubbles will visually represent the captured object.
4.  **Haptic Feedback Array:** An array of miniature ultrasonic transducers surrounding the volumetric display. These transducers will create localized pressure waves on the user’s hand or other interacting surface to simulate the shape and texture of the captured object.
5.  **Processing & Control Unit:** A high-performance computer running dedicated software for data acquisition, point cloud processing, volumetric image generation, and haptic feedback control.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Emitter/Receiver Array
Initialize Volumetric Display Matrix
Initialize Haptic Feedback Array

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {
  // 1. Emission Phase
  For Each Emitter in Emitter Array {
    Emit IR Pulse with Unique Wavelength
  }

  // 2. Reception Phase
  For Each Receiver in Receiver Array {
    Record Time-of-Flight for Each Detected IR Pulse
  }

  // 3. Point Cloud Reconstruction
  pointCloud = ReconstructPointCloud(timeOfFlightData)  // Kalman filtering + outlier rejection

  // 4. Volumetric Image Generation
  volumetricImage = GenerateVolumetricImage(pointCloud) // Marching cubes algorithm + smoothing

  // 5. Haptic Feedback Generation
  hapticFeedback = GenerateHapticFeedback(pointCloud) //  Force field calculation based on surface normals

  // 6. Display & Feedback
  Display Volumetric Image on Display Matrix
  Activate Haptic Feedback Array to simulate object surface

  // 7. Object Tracking & Adaptation (optional)
  trackObjectMovement()
  adaptDisplayAndFeedbackBasedOnMovement()
}
