**Dynamic Fragment Personalization & Predictive Pre-Fetching**

**Concept:** Extend the origin stack failover concept by not just switching *where* the stream comes from, but *what* is streamed, tailored to the client's observed capabilities and network conditions *during* playback, alongside predictive pre-fetching of content based on viewing patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Client-Side Monitoring Module:** Continuously monitors client device CPU/GPU load, available memory, network bandwidth (real-time and historical), screen resolution, and decoding capabilities. This module runs within the client's video player.
*   **Fragment Generation Profiles:** Define multiple fragment encoding profiles (resolution, bitrate, codec options) optimized for different device/network conditions. These profiles are stored on the origin stacks.
*   **Dynamic Fragment Selection Engine (Server-Side):** Based on data from the client-side monitoring module (transmitted periodically, e.g., every 5 seconds), the server dynamically selects the optimal fragment encoding profile for each client.
*   **Manifest Adaptation:** The manifest file is dynamically updated to point to fragments encoded using the selected profile. This adaptation occurs on the fly, minimizing disruption.
*   **Predictive Pre-fetch Module (Server-Side):** Analyzes viewing patterns (e.g., last 30 seconds of viewing, overall program type, time of day, geo-location) to predict the next 10-20 seconds of content a user is likely to watch.
*   **Pre-fetch Cache:** The server pre-encodes and caches predicted fragments using the client's current optimal profile.
*   **Segmented Delivery:** Fragments are delivered in small, independent segments (e.g., 200ms – 500ms) to enable rapid switching between profiles and pre-fetched content.
*   **Origin Stack Prioritization:** Origin stacks are assigned a 'health score' based on historical performance, geographic proximity to the client, and current load. The system prioritizes healthy, nearby stacks for both serving and pre-fetching.
*   **Adaptive Transition Logic:** When switching profiles or initiating pre-fetch delivery, the system employs smooth transition techniques (e.g., crossfading, seamless splicing) to minimize visible artifacts.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Fragment Selection):**

```
function selectFragment(clientID, requestTime):
  clientData = getClientData(clientID) // Get client capabilities, network conditions
  healthScores = getOriginStackHealthScores()
  bestOriginStack = selectBestOriginStack(healthScores)

  fragmentProfile = determineFragmentProfile(clientData) // Based on client conditions

  fragmentURL = bestOriginStack.generateFragmentURL(fragmentProfile, requestTime)

  return fragmentURL
```

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Monitoring):**

```
function monitorClient():
  cpuLoad = getCPULoad()
  memoryUsage = getMemoryUsage()
  networkBandwidth = getNetworkBandwidth()
  resolution = getScreenResolution()

  clientData = {
    cpuLoad: cpuLoad,
    memoryUsage: memoryUsage,
    networkBandwidth: networkBandwidth,
    resolution: resolution
  }

  sendClientData(clientData) // Send to server periodically
```

**Innovation:** This expands beyond simple failover to create a truly personalized and adaptive streaming experience. By dynamically adjusting content encoding and proactively pre-fetching content, the system minimizes buffering, maximizes video quality, and delivers a seamless viewing experience, even under challenging network conditions. It’s not *just* about avoiding outages, but *optimizing* the stream for each individual user in real-time.
