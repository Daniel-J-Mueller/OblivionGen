## Dynamic Sensory Integration Layer for Media

**Concept:** Expand beyond solely time-indexed *character* information to create a dynamic sensory integration layer tied to media content. This system will infer and deliver not just *who* is interacting with whom, but *how* the environment is affecting those interactions, delivering multi-sensory data to augment the viewing experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensory Data Acquisition & Inference Module:**

*   **Input:** Video/Audio Media Content
*   **Processes:**
    *   **Visual Scene Analysis:** Identify scene elements (weather, lighting, objects, locations). Use computer vision models trained to recognize environmental attributes.
    *   **Audio Analysis:** Identify ambient sounds (rain, wind, music, traffic). Distinguish between dialogue, sound effects, and background noise.
    *   **Entity Tracking:** Track the position, orientation, and actions of entities within the scene. Utilize existing character tracking from the base patent.
    *   **Sensory Inference Engine:** Correlate scene elements, audio, and entity actions to infer the sensory experience of characters. 
        *   Example: If a character is standing in the rain (visual + audio), the system infers they are getting wet and potentially cold.
        *   Example: If a character is in a loud factory (audio + visual), the system infers they are experiencing noise pollution.
        *   Example: If a character is in a dark forest (visual), the system infers reduced visibility.
*   **Output:** Time-indexed Sensory Data Stream:  A structured data stream containing inferred sensory attributes (temperature, humidity, light level, noise level, tactile sensations, smells (inferred), emotional state (inferred from combined sensory input and character actions)) for each entity at specific points in time.  Data format: JSON or Protobuf.

**2. Sensory Profile Database:**

*   Stores a database of "Sensory Profiles" for each entity.  
*   Each profile contains a time-indexed representation of how the entity *experiences* the media environment.
*   Data includes:
    *   Time: Timestamp within the media content.
    *   Sensory Attributes: Values for each sensory attribute (e.g., Temperature = 10C, Noise Level = 80dB).
    *   Emotional Response: A quantified emotional state based on sensory input and character actions (e.g., Fear = 0.7, Comfort = 0.2).
    *   Physiological Response: (Optional) Simulated physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance) based on sensory input.

**3. Client Interface & Sensory Delivery Module:**

*   **Input:** User Request (Entity, Time) & Sensory Profile Database
*   **Processes:**
    *   Retrieve Sensory Profile for the requested entity and time.
    *   Translate Sensory Data into a format understandable by the client device.
    *   Deliver Sensory Data to the Client Device via API.
*   **Client-Side Sensory Output (Device Dependent):**
    *   **Haptic Feedback:**  Vibration patterns to simulate touch, temperature, or impacts.
    *   **Ambient Lighting:** Adjust ambient lighting to match the scene's lighting conditions.
    *   **Spatial Audio:**  Use spatial audio to create immersive soundscapes.
    *   **Aroma Diffusion:**  (Optional) Integrate with aroma diffusion devices to release scents that match the scene (e.g., forest scent, sea breeze).
    *   **Temperature Control:** (Optional) Adjust temperature in the room to match the scene's climate (limited range).
    *   **AR/VR Integration:** Overlay visual effects onto the user's view to simulate sensory experiences.

**Pseudocode (Client Request):**

```
function get_sensory_experience(entity_name, time_stamp):
  sensory_data = SensoryProfileDatabase.get_data(entity_name, time_stamp)
  if sensory_data == null:
    return "No sensory data available"
  
  # Translate sensory data into device-specific outputs
  haptic_pattern = translate_to_haptic(sensory_data)
  ambient_light = translate_to_light(sensory_data)
  spatial_audio = translate_to_audio(sensory_data)
  
  # Send outputs to device
  Device.set_haptic(haptic_pattern)
  Device.set_lighting(ambient_light)
  Device.play_audio(spatial_audio)

  return "Sensory experience delivered"
```

**Novelty:**  This system goes beyond simply understanding *who* is interacting to understanding *how* the environment impacts those interactions and actively delivering that information to the user through a range of sensory outputs.  It creates a truly immersive and dynamic viewing experience.
