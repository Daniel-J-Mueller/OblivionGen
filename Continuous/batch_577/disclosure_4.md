## Dynamic Product Configuration & Visual Twin

**Concept:** Extend the price/feature selection paradigm to allow real-time, visually-driven product configuration *before* displaying available items. Think of it like a virtual design studio directly integrated into the shopping experience. 

**Specs:**

**I. Core System – Configuration Canvas**

*   **Input Method:** Touchscreen/Mouse/Stylus compatible canvas.
*   **Base Object Library:** A library of core product components (e.g., shoe sole, handbag handle, chassis of an electronic device). These are presented as draggable/selectable objects on the canvas.
*   **Component Properties:** Each component possesses editable properties (material, color, size, shape). These are controlled via sliders, color pickers, and dropdown menus.
*   **Constraint Engine:** A rules-based engine prevents incompatible configurations (e.g., a handle too large for a handbag, a sole that doesn’t match the shoe last). Visual feedback highlights constraint violations.
*   **Real-time Rendering:** The canvas displays a 3D rendering of the configured product, updated instantly with every property change.  Rendering quality scalable based on hardware.
*   **Configuration Storage:** User configurations saved locally (browser cache) or to a user account.

**II. Linking Configuration to Item Display**

*   **Configuration-to-Query Translation:** The configured product properties are translated into a product query. (e.g. “Show me handbags with a leather handle, a silver clasp, and a size between 8 and 10 inches”).
*   **Dynamic Item Filtering:** The product query filters the available product database in real-time.  
*   **Visual Twin Display:** Display the filtered items as "Visual Twins" – items that *most closely match* the configured product.  
*   **Deviation Highlighting:**  Highlight differences between the configured Visual Twin and the displayed product (e.g., “This handbag has a gold clasp instead of silver”).
*   **Alternative Component Suggestion:** If no exact match exists, suggest alternative components for the configured product. (“No handbags with a silver clasp are currently available. Would you like to try a gold clasp?”)

**III. Pseudocode - Configuration-to-Query Translation**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION TranslateConfigurationToQuery(configuration)
  query = ""

  //Material 
  IF configuration.material != "Any" THEN
    query += " AND material = '" + configuration.material + "'"

  //Color
  IF configuration.color != "Any" THEN
    query += " AND color = '" + configuration.color + "'"

  //Size/Dimensions (example)
  IF configuration.size != "Any" THEN
    query += " AND size BETWEEN " + configuration.minSize + " AND " + configuration.maxSize

  //Other component specific attributes 
  FOR EACH attribute IN configuration.attributes
    query += " AND " + attribute.name + " = '" + attribute.value + "'"
  END FOR

  RETURN query
END FUNCTION
```

**IV. User Interface Considerations**

*   **Layered Interface:** Configuration canvas presented as a separate, yet integrated layer on top of the product display.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex configuration options hidden initially, revealed as the user interacts with the canvas.
*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Allows users to revert configuration changes easily.
*   **Preset Configurations:** Offer pre-designed configurations as starting points for customization.
