## Dynamic Foveated Streaming with Predictive Rendering

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Client device with eye-tracking capability (integrated or peripheral), capable of rendering high-resolution video. Server capable of encoding and streaming video at variable bitrates and resolutions.
*   **Software:** Client-side application capturing eye-tracking data. Server-side encoding and streaming software. Communication protocol for transmitting eye-tracking data and coordinating rendering.

**Innovation Description:**

This system extends the concept of adjusting video encoding based on attention by integrating real-time foveated rendering *with* predictive encoding. Instead of simply lowering resolution or bitrate during predicted inattention, the system dynamically renders and streams video with extremely high resolution *only* within the user’s immediate gaze area (fovea). Peripheral vision is rendered at progressively lower resolutions, and/or utilizes stylized abstraction.  The system *predicts* gaze movement using a combination of eye-tracking data and a gaze prediction model (AI/ML based). Encoding is adjusted *before* the gaze shifts, pre-rendering the predicted gaze area at high resolution, and progressively degrading the periphery.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Client-Side (Eye Tracking & Prediction)

loop:
    eye_data = get_eye_tracking_data()
    predicted_gaze = predict_next_gaze_position(eye_data) // AI/ML model
    send_gaze_data(eye_data, predicted_gaze)

// Server-Side (Encoding & Streaming)

on receive gaze_data(eye_data, predicted_gaze):
    // Define foveal area (e.g., radius of 50 pixels around gaze)
    foveal_area = define_foveal_area(predicted_gaze)

    // Define peripheral area (remainder of the frame)
    peripheral_area = define_peripheral_area(foveal_area)

    // Encode foveal area at highest quality (high resolution, high bitrate)
    foveal_encoded = encode_video(foveal_area, high_quality_settings)

    // Encode peripheral area at progressively lower qualities 
    // (lower resolution, lower bitrate, potentially stylized abstraction)
    peripheral_encoded = encode_video(peripheral_area, low_quality_settings)

    // Combine encoded foveal and peripheral areas into a single stream
    combined_stream = combine_streams(foveal_stream, peripheral_stream)

    // Send combined stream to client
    send_stream(combined_stream)
```

**Refinement Details:**

*   **Stylized Abstraction:** In extreme periphery, instead of simply lowering resolution, the system could apply stylistic abstraction (e.g., blurring, color simplification, geometric shapes) to further reduce bandwidth and processing requirements.
*   **Gaze Prediction Model:** The accuracy of the gaze prediction model is critical. This would require a robust AI/ML model trained on large datasets of eye movements.
*   **Dynamic Foveal Area:** The size of the foveal area could be dynamically adjusted based on the user’s level of focus and attention.
*   **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:**  Integrate with existing adaptive bitrate streaming protocols (e.g., HLS, DASH) to ensure smooth playback even under varying network conditions.
*   **User Calibration:**  A calibration process would be necessary to map eye movements to screen coordinates accurately.
*   **Multi-User Support:**  Extend the system to support multiple users, each with their own individualized foveated rendering streams.
