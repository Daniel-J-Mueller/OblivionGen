**Dynamic Endpoint Swapping with Predictive Load Balancing**

**Concept:** Extend the idea of selectable endpoints beyond simply failing over to a new server. Introduce a system where the server *predicts* load on each endpoint and dynamically swaps which endpoint receives responses *before* any performance degradation occurs. This moves beyond reactive failover to proactive load distribution.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Endpoint Performance Monitor (EPM):**
    *   Each potential endpoint (identified in the API request’s list) runs a lightweight agent—the EPM.
    *   EPM continuously monitors resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O) and response times to simple health checks.
    *   EPM transmits data to a central Load Prediction Service (LPS) using a lightweight protocol (e.g., UDP or a streamlined MQTT).

*   **Component 2: Load Prediction Service (LPS):**
    *   Collects performance data from all EPMs.
    *   Employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future load on each endpoint. The model should be trainable and adaptable to changing traffic patterns.
    *   Calculates a “Load Score” for each endpoint, representing its predicted capacity and current load.
    *   Maintains a prioritized list of endpoints based on Load Score.

*   **Component 3: Response Routing Module (RRM):**
    *   Integrated within the web server.
    *   Before sending a response, the RRM queries the LPS for the current prioritized endpoint list.
    *   The RRM routes the response to the *highest-scoring* endpoint on the list.
    *   If the highest-scoring endpoint is unavailable, it falls back to the next on the list.

*   **API Modification:**
    *   The API request includes a ‘dynamicRoutingEnabled’ boolean flag. If true, the RRM is engaged; if false, standard endpoint selection (first available) is used.
    *   Add a ‘monitoringInterval’ parameter which dictates the frequency in seconds which the EPM reports data to the LPS.

**Pseudocode (RRM):**

```
function routeResponse(apiResponse, endpointList, dynamicRoutingEnabled, monitoringInterval):
  if dynamicRoutingEnabled:
    loadPredictionService = connectToLPS()
    prioritizedEndpoints = loadPredictionService.getPrioritizedEndpoints(endpointList)
    
    for endpoint in prioritizedEndpoints:
      try:
        sendResponse(apiResponse, endpoint)
        // Success, exit loop
        break
      except ConnectionError:
        // Endpoint unavailable, try next
        continue
  else:
    // Standard endpoint selection
    sendResponse(apiResponse, endpointList[0])
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **EndpointData:** { endpointID: string, CPUUsage: float, memoryUsage: float, networkIO: float, responseTime: float }
*   **PrioritizedEndpointList:** [ { endpointID: string, score: float }, ...]

**Scalability:**

*   LPS can be clustered and scaled horizontally.
*   EPMs are lightweight and should not significantly impact endpoint performance.

**Considerations:**

*   The accuracy of the load prediction model is critical.
*   The overhead of collecting and analyzing performance data must be minimized.
*   Security considerations when transmitting performance data.
