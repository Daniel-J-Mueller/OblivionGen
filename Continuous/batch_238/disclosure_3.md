## Dynamic Policy ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic policy translation concept to incorporate ‘shadow’ policies that predict access needs *before* a request is made, and preemptively adjust access controls. This creates a more fluid and responsive security posture, going beyond reactive access control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component: Predictive Policy Engine (PPE)**

*   **Input:**
    *   User Activity Streams: Real-time logs of user interactions with resources (e.g., file access, API calls, application usage).
    *   Resource Metadata: Information about resources, including type, sensitivity, and access history.
    *   Historical Access Patterns:  Statistical data on how users typically access resources.
    *   Time-Based Rules:  Scheduled access requirements (e.g., granting temporary access during business hours).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Pattern Recognition: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks, Markov models) to identify recurring access patterns.
    *   Predictive Modeling: Forecasts future access requests based on historical data and current user activity.
    *   Shadow Policy Generation: Creates temporary, ‘shadow’ security policies that anticipate future access needs.  These policies are expressed in the same language as the existing policies (allowing for seamless integration).
*   **Output:**
    *   Shadow Policies: Expressed in the second policy language, ready for integration with the Policy Evaluation Engine.
    *   Confidence Scores: Quantify the probability that a predicted access request will occur.
    *   Policy Expiration Timestamps: Automatically remove shadow policies after a predefined period or when the predicted access request does not materialize.

**2. Integration with Existing System**

*   **Policy Blending:** The Policy Evaluation Engine combines existing security policies with shadow policies, prioritizing them based on confidence scores and sensitivity levels.  High-confidence shadow policies can temporarily augment or override existing permissions.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The PPE continuously monitors user activity and adjusts shadow policies in real-time, adapting to changing access patterns.
*   **Audit Logging:**  All shadow policy creations, modifications, and activations are logged for auditing and accountability.

**3. Pseudocode: PPE Core Logic**

```
function generateShadowPolicies(userActivity, resourceMetadata, historicalData):
  // Analyze userActivity and resourceMetadata to identify potential access requests
  predictedAccessRequests = analyzeActivity(userActivity, resourceMetadata)

  shadowPolicies = []
  for request in predictedAccessRequests:
    // Determine appropriate permissions based on historical data and resource sensitivity
    permissions = determinePermissions(request, historicalData)

    // Create a shadow policy in the second policy language
    shadowPolicy = createPolicy(request, permissions)

    // Assign a confidence score based on prediction accuracy
    confidenceScore = calculateConfidence(request)

    // Set an expiration timestamp
    expirationTimestamp = currentTime + expirationInterval

    // Add the shadow policy to the list
    shadowPolicies.append((shadowPolicy, confidenceScore, expirationTimestamp))

  return shadowPolicies
```

**4. System Architecture**

*   Existing Policy Evaluation Engine.
*   Existing Data Store.
*   New: Predictive Policy Engine (PPE) - Runs as a separate service.
*   Communication: PPE communicates with the Policy Evaluation Engine via a secure API.
*   Data Source: PPE draws data from user activity logs, resource metadata, and historical access patterns.
