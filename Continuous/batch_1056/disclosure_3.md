## Dynamic Contextual Display Layers

**Concept:** Expanding on the idea of displaying excerpted communications based on user identity and attention, this system creates dynamically layered display augmentations, projecting relevant information *onto* the user’s real-world view – not simply *on* a screen. Think augmented reality, but with a focus on layered, contextually-aware data streams.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   AR/VR Headset or Smart Glasses with:
    *   High-resolution, low-latency displays.
    *   Wide field of view.
    *   Depth sensor (LiDAR or similar).
    *   High-resolution, low-latency cameras (RGB & IR).
    *   Microphones.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).
*   Computing Device (Smartphone/Laptop) – for processing and communication.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Environmental Mapping & User Tracking:**
    *   Depth sensor creates a real-time 3D map of the user’s environment.
    *   IMU and camera data track user head/eye movements, identifying gaze direction and focus.
    *   User identity is determined via camera (facial recognition, object recognition – identifying belongings, etc.).
2.  **Communication Ingestion & Analysis:**
    *   Ingest communications (text, voice, email, messaging) from various sources.
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) extracts key entities, sentiment, and intent.
    *   Relevance scoring determines how likely a communication is to be of interest to the user *right now* based on location, activity (determined via IMU/camera), and identity.
3.  **Dynamic Layer Generation:**
    *   Based on relevance scores, generate “layers” of information. These layers are *not* full-screen replacements but semi-transparent overlays onto the user’s view. Examples:
        *   **People Layer:** When looking at someone, display their name, recent communication history, and relevant professional/personal information (pulled from CRM/social media – with appropriate privacy controls).
        *   **Object Layer:** When looking at an object (e.g., a product in a store), display pricing, reviews, alternative options, and purchase links.
        *   **Communication Layer:** When anticipating a call/message, display a subtle notification with caller/sender ID and a short excerpt of the communication.
        *   **Task Layer:** Display reminders, to-do lists, or relevant information related to the user's current location or activity.
4.  **Rendering & Display:**
    *   Layers are rendered as semi-transparent overlays onto the user’s view, using the depth sensor to ensure objects are occluded correctly.
    *   Brightness and contrast are dynamically adjusted based on ambient lighting conditions.
    *   Information is displayed in a minimal, unobtrusive manner, avoiding information overload.
    *   Eye-tracking ensures that information is only displayed when the user is looking at the relevant object or person.

**Pseudocode (Layer Generation):**

```
function generateLayers(environmentMap, userGaze, userIdentity, communications) {
  layers = []

  // People Layer
  peopleDetected = detectPeople(environmentMap, userGaze)
  for (person in peopleDetected) {
    personData = getPersonData(person, userIdentity)
    layers.push(createPeopleLayer(personData))
  }

  // Object Layer
  objectsDetected = detectObjects(environmentMap, userGaze)
  for (object in objectsDetected) {
    objectData = getObjectData(object)
    layers.push(createObjectLayer(objectData))
  }

  // Communication Layer
  relevantCommunications = filterRelevantCommunications(communications, userIdentity, userGaze)
  for (communication in relevantCommunications) {
    layers.push(createCommunicationLayer(communication))
  }

  return layers
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Contextual Task Management:** Integrate with task management systems to display relevant tasks based on location and activity.
*   **Real-time Translation:** Translate spoken language in real-time and display the translated text as an overlay.
*   **Interactive Layering:** Allow users to customize the layers displayed and interact with them using gestures or voice commands.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrate haptic feedback to provide subtle notifications or alerts.
