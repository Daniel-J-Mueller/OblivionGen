## Dynamic Feature Weighting Based on Inter-Account Behavioral Drift

**Concept:** The patent discusses creating new ML models based on existing ones for new accounts within an organization. This inspires a system that doesn’t just *copy* features, but dynamically adjusts their weighting based on observed behavioral drift *between* accounts. Essentially, we'll monitor how different accounts deviate from established norms and adapt the model accordingly – not just for new accounts, but *continuously* for all accounts.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Drift Monitoring Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**  Collects activity data as outlined in Claim 2 (account activity, network traffic, processing activity, DNS, storage).
*   **Baseline Establishment:** For each feature used in the ML models, establish a baseline distribution of values *across all active accounts within an OU*. This baseline represents the "normal" behavior for that feature within that organizational unit. Utilize techniques such as Kernel Density Estimation to represent the distributions.
*   **Drift Detection:** Continuously monitor the distribution of each feature for *each individual account*. Calculate a drift score based on the divergence between the account's feature distribution and the OU baseline distribution.  Utilize metrics like Kullback-Leibler Divergence or Wasserstein Distance.  Set a configurable threshold for triggering drift alerts.
*   **Account Cohort Grouping:** Dynamically group accounts exhibiting similar drift patterns. This moves beyond OU-level generalizations to identify emerging behavioral clusters *within* OUs.  Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) on the drift score vectors.

**2. Dynamic Feature Weighting Engine:**

*   **Weight Adjustment Function:**  Implement a function that adjusts the weight of each feature in the ML model based on the following inputs:
    *   Account's Drift Score (for that feature).
    *   Account’s Cohort Group (if applicable).
    *   OU Baseline Distribution for the feature.
    *   A configurable ‘responsiveness’ parameter – controls how quickly weights adjust.

    Pseudocode:

    ```
    function adjust_feature_weight(account, feature, drift_score, cohort, ou_baseline, responsiveness):
        weight = base_weight  //Initial weight of the feature
        if drift_score > threshold:
            weight = weight * (1 - (drift_score / max_drift_score) * responsiveness) //Reduce weight
        if cohort is not null:
            cohort_drift = calculate_cohort_drift(cohort, feature)
            weight = weight * (1 - (cohort_drift / max_cohort_drift) * responsiveness)
        return weight
    ```
*   **Model Update Process:** Implement a scheduled process (e.g., hourly, daily) that iterates through all active accounts and adjusts the weights of each feature in their respective ML models using the `adjust_feature_weight` function.  This process should be applied *incrementally* – avoid complete model retraining.
*   **Feature Stability Scoring (Augmentation):**  Incorporate a "feature stability score" as suggested in Claims 9 and 18, but calculate it *dynamically* based on the variance of drift scores across all accounts for that feature over a rolling time window.  Features with consistently low drift (high stability) will have their weights adjusted less aggressively.

**3.  Alerting and Remediation Integration:**

*   **Drift-Based Alerts:**  Generate alerts when an account’s drift score exceeds a predefined threshold, even if no anomalous activity has been *detected* yet. This allows for proactive investigation.
*   **Remediation Actions:**  Trigger automated remediation actions based on drift patterns. For example, if multiple accounts within a cohort exhibit a sudden increase in outbound network traffic to a specific IP address, automatically block that IP address.

**Data Structures:**

*   `AccountDriftData`: Contains drift scores for each feature, cohort assignment, and other relevant metadata for a given account.
*   `FeatureBaseline`: Stores the baseline distribution for each feature within an OU.
*   `Cohort`: A data structure representing a group of accounts exhibiting similar drift patterns.



This system moves beyond simply *copying* existing models to creating a constantly adapting threat detection system that responds in real-time to subtle shifts in behavior – potentially identifying threats *before* they manifest as full-blown anomalies.
