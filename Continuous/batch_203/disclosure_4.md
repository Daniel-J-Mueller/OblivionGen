## Dynamic Granularity Labeling & Policy Enforcement

**Concept:** Extend the multi-stage clustering to dynamically adjust granularity of clusters based on observed policy violations.  Instead of fixed hierarchical levels, the system actively refines cluster boundaries to isolate non-compliant elements *more efficiently* and minimize false positives.

**Specs:**

1.  **Policy Violation Monitoring Module:**
    *   Input:  Cluster labels, policy definitions.
    *   Function: Continuously monitors cluster labels against defined policies.  Flags instances of non-compliance.  Generates a "Violation Score" for each cluster (higher = more violations).
2.  **Dynamic Cluster Refinement Engine:**
    *   Input: Violation Scores, Cluster Assignments, Text Data.
    *   Function: Based on Violation Scores, this engine triggers *selective* cluster splitting/merging.
        *   **Splitting:** Clusters with high Violation Scores are subdivided further using the clustering algorithm.  The engine prioritizes splitting along dimensions *most correlated* with policy violations.  (Correlation determined through statistical analysis of text features and violation flags.)
        *   **Merging:** Clusters with consistently *low* Violation Scores and high intra-cluster similarity can be merged to reduce computational overhead.
3.  **Adaptive Resource Allocation:**
    *   Resource allocation is no longer solely determined by the *initial* cluster structure.  It's dynamically adjusted based on cluster *volatility* (rate of splitting/merging).  
    *   Clusters undergoing frequent refinement receive *more* resources for labeling and verification.
    *   Stable clusters receive *fewer* resources.
4.  **Text Feature Engineering Pipeline:**
    *   Enhance the existing text processing with:
        *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the emotional tone of text data.  (Useful for identifying potentially problematic content.)
        *   **Topic Modeling:**  Identify the key topics discussed within each cluster. (Helpful for understanding the context of violations.)
        *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**  Identify key entities (people, organizations, locations) mentioned in text. (Useful for enforcing policies related to specific entities.)
5.  **Pseudocode (Dynamic Cluster Refinement Engine):**

```pseudocode
function refine_clusters(clusters, violation_scores, text_data, threshold_split, threshold_merge):
  for each cluster in clusters:
    if violation_scores[cluster] > threshold_split:
      # Split cluster using clustering algorithm
      new_clusters = apply_clustering(cluster, text_data)
      # Update cluster list
      clusters.remove(cluster)
      clusters.extend(new_clusters)

    elif intra_cluster_similarity(cluster, text_data) > threshold_merge:
      # Check for neighbor clusters to merge with
      merge_candidate = find_merge_candidate(cluster, clusters)
      if merge_candidate != null:
        # Merge clusters
        merged_cluster = merge(cluster, merge_candidate)
        clusters.remove(cluster)
        clusters.remove(merge_candidate)
        clusters.append(merged_cluster)
  return clusters
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond static, pre-defined hierarchies. It allows the clustering process to *react* to policy violations, improving both accuracy and efficiency. The dynamic resource allocation ensures that labeling efforts are focused on the areas where they are most needed, while the enhanced text feature engineering pipeline provides richer insights into the data.
