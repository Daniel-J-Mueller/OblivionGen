## Modular Media Extender with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** A media extender device that incorporates biofeedback sensors and dynamically adjusts media output based on the user’s physiological state. The device isn’t just *extending* media, it’s *personalizing* the experience in real-time.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Core Module:** (Dimensions: 8cm x 5cm x 2cm) Houses the primary processing unit (ARM Cortex-A72 or equivalent), Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity, and power management. Constructed from lightweight aluminum alloy.
*   **Sensor Pods:** (Diameter: 2cm, Height: 1cm each) Detachable, magnetic pods housing various sensors. Initial configurations include:
    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Pod:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor for HRV analysis.
    *   **Skin Conductance (GSR) Pod:** Measures sweat gland activity, indicating emotional arousal.
    *   **EEG Pod (Optional):** Single-channel EEG sensor for basic brainwave monitoring (requires conductive gel).
    *   **EMG Pod (Optional):** Detects muscle activity, for use cases like gaming.
*   **Haptic Feedback Module:** (Integrated into Core Module) Array of micro-actuators for subtle tactile stimulation.
*   **Audio Output:** Integrated high-quality DAC and amplifier, with 3.5mm headphone jack and Bluetooth audio streaming.
*   **Display (Optional):** Small OLED display (2.5-inch) for basic status information and visual feedback.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery (3000mAh), with USB-C charging.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Operating System:** Embedded Linux distribution optimized for low power consumption.
*   **Biofeedback Algorithm:**  Machine learning model trained to correlate physiological data with optimal media experiences (e.g., calming music for high stress, energetic visuals for low energy).
*   **Media Streaming Support:**  Compatible with major streaming services (Spotify, Netflix, etc.) via open APIs.
*   **Customization Options:** User-configurable profiles to tailor biofeedback response and media preferences.
*   **Data Logging & Analysis:**  Optional data logging for tracking physiological responses and media enjoyment over time.
*   **API:** Open API for developers to create custom biofeedback integrations and media experiences.

**Functional Description:**

1.  User attaches sensor pods to preferred locations on the body (e.g., wrist, forehead, chest).
2.  Device establishes connection with media streaming service.
3.  Biofeedback algorithm continuously analyzes physiological data from sensor pods.
4.  Based on analysis, device dynamically adjusts media output in real-time:
    *   **Audio:** Adjusts volume, equalization, and music genre.
    *   **Video:** Adjusts brightness, contrast, color saturation, and video genre.
    *   **Haptic Feedback:** Provides subtle vibrations to enhance immersion or provide calming stimuli.
5.  User can customize biofeedback profiles to tailor the experience to their preferences.

**Pseudocode (Biofeedback Loop):**

```
while (true) {
    readSensorData(HRV_POD, hrvData);
    readSensorData(GSR_POD, gsrData);

    processData(hrvData, gsrData, emotionalState);

    if (emotionalState == "stressed") {
        selectCalmingMusic();
        reduceVideoBrightness();
        activateCalmingHapticPattern();
    } else if (emotionalState == "energized") {
        selectEnergeticMusic();
        increaseVideoBrightness();
        activateEnergizingHapticPattern();
    } else {
        // Maintain current settings
    }

    delay(100ms);
}
```
