## Dynamic Focal Plane Adjustment via Multi-Spectral Proximity & Stereo Disparity

**Concept:** Enhance stereo depth mapping and recalibration not just through proximity *distance*, but by analyzing the *spectral reflectance* of the target object as determined by a multi-spectral proximity sensor, and tying that to dynamic focal plane adjustments for each camera. This allows for more accurate disparity calculations, especially for objects with low or non-Lambertian reflectance.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a multi-spectral proximity sensor (detecting at least Red, Green, Blue, Near-Infrared) alongside the existing stereo camera system. This sensor should provide both distance and spectral reflectance data.
*   **Dynamic Focus Control:** Each camera in the stereo pair must have independently controllable focus. This could be implemented via voice coil motors or liquid lens technology.
*   **Reflectance-Disparity Correlation Engine:** A dedicated processing unit (DSP or FPGA) to execute the core algorithm:

    1.  **Spectral Signature Acquisition:** When an object is detected by the multi-spectral proximity sensor, capture its spectral reflectance signature.
    2.  **Material Classification:** Use the signature to classify the material of the object (e.g., matte plastic, glossy metal, organic tissue). A pre-trained machine learning model will be required.
    3.  **Optimal Focus Adjustment:** Based on the material classification, adjust the focus of each camera to optimize image sharpness *before* capturing the stereo pair. Different materials require different optimal focus settings for maximal contrast.
    4.  **Stereo Capture:** Simultaneously capture the stereo image pair.
    5.  **Disparity Map Generation:** Generate a disparity map using standard stereo matching algorithms.
    6.  **Reflectance-Weighted Disparity:**  Weight the disparity values in the map based on the captured spectral reflectance.  Higher reflectance = higher weight.  This prioritizes accurate matching in areas with strong signal.
    7.  **Recalibration Refinement:**  Use the weighted disparity map to refine camera calibration parameters, reducing errors caused by specular reflections or low-contrast surfaces.
*   **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    FUNCTION ProcessStereoCapture()
        // 1. Acquire proximity data
        proximityData = MultiSpectralSensor.ReadData()
        distance = proximityData.Distance
        reflectance = proximityData.Reflectance

        // 2. Material classification
        materialType = MaterialClassifier.Classify(reflectance)

        // 3. Adjust camera focus
        Camera1.SetFocus(materialType.OptimalFocus1)
        Camera2.SetFocus(materialType.OptimalFocus2)

        // 4. Capture stereo image
        Image1 = Camera1.Capture()
        Image2 = Camera2.Capture()

        // 5. Generate initial disparity map
        disparityMap = StereoMatcher.Generate(Image1, Image2)

        // 6. Weight disparity map by reflectance
        weightedDisparityMap = ApplyReflectanceWeighting(disparityMap, Image1, Image2)

        // 7. Refine calibration
        calibrationParameters = CalibrateCameras(weightedDisparityMap, distance)

        RETURN calibrationParameters
    END FUNCTION
    ```
*   **Calibration Enhancement:** The recalibration process should specifically target parameters related to lens distortion and camera pose, and be weighted by the confidence level of the disparity matches.
*   **Power Management:** Implement a duty cycle for the multi-spectral sensor to minimize power consumption. Activation should be triggered by motion detection or user input.
*   **Housing Integration:** The multi-spectral sensor should be integrated into the device housing in a way that minimizes interference with the camera field of view and maximizes ambient light capture.
