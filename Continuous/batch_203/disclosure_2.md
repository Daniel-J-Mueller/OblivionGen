## Dynamic Emotional Arc Mapping & Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the subgraph analysis to encompass *emotional* relationships between entities within a literary work, and synthesize novel narrative fragments based on detected emotional arcs.

**Specification:**

1.  **Emotional Lexicon & Tagging Module:**
    *   A continuously updated lexicon mapping words/phrases to emotional valence (positive/negative/neutral) and intensity. Expand beyond basic emotions to include nuance (e.g., wistful, melancholic, defiant).
    *   NLP process to tag entities (characters, locations, concepts) with associated emotions *as expressed by other entities within the text*.  Crucially, the emotion isn’t inherent to the entity, but *attributed* through interactions. Example: Character A consistently describes Location X as "ominous" – Location X is tagged with ‘fear’ as a received emotion.
2.  **Emotional Graph Construction:**
    *   Build a separate graph layer *over* the existing entity relationship graph.  Nodes represent entities.  Edges represent emotional connections.
    *   Edge weight:  Derived from emotional valence, intensity, and frequency of emotional expression between entities.
    *   Emotional ‘polarity’ of edges: Positive/Negative/Neutral.
    *   Emotional ‘direction’ of edges: From entity expressing emotion *to* entity receiving it.
3.  **Emotional Arc Identification:**
    *   Algorithm to detect dominant emotional arcs within the graph.  An arc is a sequence of emotional changes experienced by an entity over time (as implied by text sequence).
    *   Identify ‘turning points’ in emotional arcs – significant shifts in emotional state.
    *   Calculate arc ‘shape’ parameters:  Rise time, peak intensity, fall time, overall duration.
4.  **Narrative Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Based on detected emotional arcs, generate short narrative fragments (sentences, paragraphs) extending the original work.
    *   Utilize a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on literary text.
    *   Input to LLM:
        *   Entity involved in arc
        *   Arc shape parameters
        *   Context from original text surrounding the arc
        *   Desired ‘style’ (e.g., mimic author’s writing style).
    *   Output: Novel text fragment continuing the emotional trajectory.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Synthesis):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateFragment(entity, arcShape, context, style):
    prompt = "Continue the story from the following context, maintaining the style of [style]. " +
             "The entity [entity] is experiencing an emotional arc with the following characteristics: " +
             "Rise Time: " + arcShape.riseTime + ", Peak Intensity: " + arcShape.peakIntensity + ", Fall Time: " + arcShape.fallTime + ". " +
             "Context: " + context

    fragment = LLM.generateText(prompt) // Use a fine-tuned LLM

    RETURN fragment
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated fan fiction generation.
*   Personalized literary experiences – tailor story continuations based on user emotional preferences.
*   Character development tools for authors.
*   Novelty detection - identify emotional patterns uncommon in existing literature.
