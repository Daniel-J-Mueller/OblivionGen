## Self-Orienting Package Stabilization System - ‘SkyAnchor’

**System Overview:** A supplemental system deployed *after* parachute release, designed to actively stabilize package orientation prior to ground impact and mitigate landing-related damage. This builds on the parachute delivery concept by adding a final-stage active stabilization layer.

**Core Components:**

*   **Miniaturized Gimbal System:** A three-axis gimbal system housed within the package, activated upon detection of parachute deployment. This gimbal does *not* attempt to counter rotation during descent but prepares for post-parachute stabilization.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** High-precision IMU within the package to detect package orientation and angular velocity *after* parachute deployment and during the final descent stages.
*   **Micro-Gas Thruster Array:** Four micro-gas thrusters positioned around the package’s central axis. These thrusters utilize a rapidly deployable, non-toxic propellant (e.g., compressed nitrogen or a biodegradable aerosol) and are controlled by the onboard processor.
*   **Deployment Sensor Suite:** Consists of a downward-facing optical flow sensor and a small radar altimeter. Optical flow detects ground proximity and surface texture, while the radar altimeter provides precise altitude data.
*   **Onboard Processor & Algorithm:** A low-power processor running a control algorithm that utilizes data from the IMU, deployment sensor suite, and pre-programmed package orientation preferences (e.g., “this side up”).

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Parachute Deployment:** Standard parachute system deployed as per the original patent.
2.  **System Activation:** Upon detection of parachute deployment (via accelerometer data and/or a dedicated sensor), the ‘SkyAnchor’ system is activated. The gimbal system is initialized.
3.  **Orientation Assessment:** The IMU continuously monitors the package's orientation and angular velocity during the final descent stages.
4.  **Thrust Vector Calculation:** The processor analyzes IMU data and calculates the required thrust vectors to achieve the desired package orientation.
5.  **Thruster Activation:** Micro-gas thrusters are activated in a pulsed manner to gently correct the package’s orientation. The algorithm prioritizes minimizing impact forces and achieving a stable landing.
6.  **Ground Impact Mitigation:** The system continues to make minor corrections until ground contact is detected via optical flow and radar altimeter data.
7.  **System Shutdown:** Once the package is grounded, the system shuts down to conserve power.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
loop:
  read IMU data (orientation, angular velocity)
  read altitude from radar altimeter
  read ground proximity data from optical flow sensor

  calculate error = desired_orientation - current_orientation

  if error > threshold:
    calculate thrust_vectors based on error, angular velocity, and altitude
    activate micro-gas thrusters with calculated thrust levels
  else:
    deactivate micro-gas thrusters

  if ground_contact_detected:
    shutdown system
  end if
end loop
```

**Specifications:**

*   **System Weight:** < 500g (including propellant)
*   **Propellant Capacity:** Sufficient for ~5 seconds of continuous thrust
*   **Micro-Gas Thruster Thrust:** 10-50 mN per thruster
*   **Processor:** ARM Cortex-M4 or equivalent
*   **Communication:** (Optional) BLE for data logging and diagnostics
*   **Power Source:** Integrated rechargeable battery

**Potential Applications:** Delivering fragile goods, medical supplies, or sensitive electronic equipment where preserving package integrity is paramount.
