## Dynamic Cavity Pressure Regulation System

**Concept:** Integrate microfluidic channels within the gasket structure of the display stack to actively regulate pressure within the light source cavities. This addresses potential issues arising from temperature fluctuations, altitude changes, or physical shock impacting the sealed cavity, preventing light source failure or display distortion.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Gasket Material:** Replace existing gasket material with a microchannel-embedded polymer (e.g., PDMS, silicone). Minimum channel width: 50 microns. Channel density: 10 channels per square millimeter.
2.  **Microfluidic Network:** Design a closed-loop microfluidic network integrated into the gasket. Network consists of:
    *   **Reservoir:** A small, flexible reservoir (volume: 0.1 - 0.5 cubic millimeters) within the gasket, acting as a pressure buffer.  Material: same as gasket.
    *   **Pressure Sensor:** Miniature MEMS pressure sensor integrated into the reservoir to monitor cavity pressure.  Resolution: 1 mbar.
    *   **Micro-Pump:** Piezoelectric micro-pump connected to the reservoir, capable of both adding and removing fluid to regulate pressure.  Flow rate: 1 microliter/minute.  Power requirement: < 10mW.
    *   **Micro-Valve:** Micro-valve to control fluid flow between the reservoir and the light source cavities. Response time: < 1 millisecond.
3.  **Fluid:** Employ a non-conductive, low-viscosity fluid compatible with the gasket material and light sources. Dielectric constant: < 2.0. Operating Temperature: -20C to 85C.
4.  **Control System:**
    *   **Microcontroller:** Integrate a low-power microcontroller to manage the pressure sensor, micro-pump, and micro-valve.
    *   **Algorithm:** Implement a PID control algorithm to maintain a target cavity pressure. Target pressure configurable via software.
    *   **Communication:** I2C or SPI communication protocol for data logging and configuration.
5.  **FPCA Integration:** Modify the FPCA to include power and control traces for the microcontroller, pressure sensor, micro-pump, and micro-valve.
6.  **Assembly:** Ensure fluid-tight sealing of the microfluidic network during gasket assembly. Employ laser bonding or micro-molding techniques.
7.  **Testing:** Rigorous testing to verify:
    *   Pressure regulation accuracy (+/- 1 mbar).
    *   Leakage prevention under various temperature and pressure conditions.
    *   Long-term reliability of the microfluidic components.
    *   Impact of pressure regulation on light source performance.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
// Initialize pressure sensor, micro-pump, micro-valve
sensor = PressureSensor()
pump = MicroPump()
valve = MicroValve()
targetPressure = 1013.25 // Set target pressure in mbar

loop:
  currentPressure = sensor.readPressure()
  error = targetPressure - currentPressure

  if error > threshold:
    valve.open()
    pump.pumpFluidIn(error * gain) // Pump fluid in based on error and gain
    valve.close()
  elif error < -threshold:
    valve.open()
    pump.pumpFluidOut(abs(error) * gain) // Pump fluid out based on error and gain
    valve.close()
  else:
    // Maintain pressure
    pass
```
