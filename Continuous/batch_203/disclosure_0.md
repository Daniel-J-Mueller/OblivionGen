## Adaptive Cipher Suite ‘Layers’ for Granular Data Protection

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic cipher suite selection to operate not just at the session level, but *within* a single session, applied to individual data packets or groups of packets, based on content analysis. Think of it like layering encryption – different parts of a single transmission get different levels of protection.

**Specifications:**

**1. Packet Classification Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw packet data.
*   **Process:** Analyze packet payload to identify data type and sensitivity level. This uses a configurable rule set based on:
    *   **Header Analysis:** Identify application protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.).
    *   **Keyword/Pattern Matching:** Search for sensitive keywords (credit card numbers, social security numbers, health records) or patterns (regular expressions).
    *   **Machine Learning Classification:**  Employ a trained ML model to categorize data based on content. The model requires training data labeled with sensitivity levels (e.g., “Public”, “Internal”, “Confidential”, “Highly Confidential”).
*   **Output:** Sensitivity Level (string) – a classification of the packet’s data.

**2. Cipher Suite Policy Engine:**

*   **Input:** Sensitivity Level (from Packet Classification), Current Session Cipher Suites.
*   **Process:**  Lookup a pre-defined policy mapping Sensitivity Levels to Cipher Suites. The policy should be configurable and allow for multiple cipher suites per sensitivity level (for redundancy or performance tuning).  The engine should also manage a ‘fallback’ cipher suite in case of policy mismatches or errors.
*   **Output:** Selected Cipher Suite (string).

**3. Dynamic Encryption/Decryption Module:**

*   **Input:** Packet Data, Selected Cipher Suite.
*   **Process:** Encrypt or decrypt the packet data using the Selected Cipher Suite *before* transmitting or *after* receiving. This module must be integrated with the existing TLS/SSL stack. It intercepts packets at a low level to perform dynamic encryption.
*   **Output:** Encrypted/Decrypted Packet Data.

**4. Session Management Integration:**

*   **Process:** Modify the TLS handshake process to negotiate a base set of cipher suites. The dynamic encryption module then operates *on top* of this negotiated baseline, layering additional encryption as needed.  This module is responsible for updating session state to reflect dynamically applied cipher suites.

**Pseudocode Example (Dynamic Encryption Module):**

```
function encryptPacket(packetData, selectedCipherSuite):
  if selectedCipherSuite == "BaseCipherSuite":
    encryptedData = performBaseEncryption(packetData)
  else:
    encryptedData = performAdditionalEncryption(packetData, selectedCipherSuite)
  return encryptedData

function decryptPacket(encryptedData, selectedCipherSuite):
  if selectedCipherSuite == "BaseCipherSuite":
    decryptedData = performBaseDecryption(encryptedData)
  else:
    decryptedData = performAdditionalDecryption(encryptedData, selectedCipherSuite)
  return decryptedData

function processPacket(packetData):
  sensitivityLevel = PacketClassificationModule.classify(packetData)
  selectedCipherSuite = CipherSuitePolicyEngine.lookup(sensitivityLevel)
  if selectedCipherSuite != null:
    encryptedData = encryptPacket(packetData, selectedCipherSuite)
    send(encryptedData)
  else:
    send(packetData) // Send unencrypted if no cipher suite is found
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Performance Impact:**  Dynamic encryption will introduce overhead.  Efficient cipher suite selection and optimized encryption/decryption algorithms are crucial.
*   **Key Management:**  Multiple cipher suites require careful key management.  Ensure keys are rotated and protected appropriately.
*   **Policy Configuration:** A user-friendly interface for configuring sensitivity levels and cipher suite mappings is essential.
*   **Auditing:**  Log all dynamic cipher suite selections for auditing and security analysis.
*   **Integration with existing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.**
