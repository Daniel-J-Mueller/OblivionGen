## Dynamic Scene Graph Integration for Predictive Upsampling

**Concept:** Extend the upsampling process beyond individual frames or short temporal windows by constructing a dynamic scene graph representing the entire media content. This graph will capture object relationships, semantic information, and predicted motion trajectories, enabling a more context-aware and coherent upsampling process.

**Specifications:**

**1. Scene Graph Construction Module:**

   *   **Input:** Media file (video/film).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Utilize object detection and segmentation algorithms (YOLOv8, Mask R-CNN) to identify objects within each frame.
        *   Employ a 3D pose estimation network (e.g., Human3D) to estimate the pose of articulated objects (humans, animals).
        *   Implement a relationship inference module using a graph neural network (GNN). This module analyzes spatial relationships, co-occurrence patterns, and temporal consistency to infer relationships between objects (e.g., "person riding horse," "car following truck").
        *   Build a dynamic scene graph where:
            *   Nodes represent objects and entities (e.g., person, car, building).
            *   Edges represent relationships between nodes (e.g., “is_a”, “near”, “riding”).
            *   Node attributes include object class, 3D pose, semantic tags, and confidence scores.
            *   Edges include relationship type, confidence score, and temporal validity.
   *   **Output:** Dynamic scene graph representing the media content.

**2. Predictive Motion Module:**

   *   **Input:** Dynamic scene graph, historical motion data (from previous frames).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network trained on a large dataset of motion capture data to predict the future motion of articulated objects based on their current state and relationships.
        *   Model object interactions and constraints. For example, predict that a person holding an object will move it accordingly, or that a car following another car will maintain a safe distance.
        *   Generate a "motion prediction buffer" containing multiple potential future frames for each object.
   *   **Output:** Motion prediction buffer.

**3. Context-Aware Upsampling Module:**

   *   **Input:** Low-resolution frame, Dynamic scene graph, Motion prediction buffer.
   *   **Process:**
        *   For each object in the frame:
            *   Retrieve the corresponding node in the dynamic scene graph.
            *   Select the most likely future frame from the motion prediction buffer based on the predicted motion and object relationships.
            *   Use a GAN (as described in the original patent) to upsample the object using the selected future frame as a reference.
            *   Incorporate semantic information from the scene graph to guide the upsampling process. For example, if an object is identified as “face”, prioritize facial details during upsampling.
        *   Combine the upsampled objects with the upsampled background (using the same GAN approach as in the original patent).
        *   Apply a blending technique to seamlessly integrate the upsampled objects and background.
   *   **Output:** Upsampled frame.

**4. Temporal Consistency Enforcement Module:**

   *   **Input:** Sequence of upsampled frames.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Utilize a temporal filtering technique (e.g., Kalman filter) to smooth the sequence of upsampled frames and reduce temporal flickering.
        *   Enforce consistency of object identities and trajectories across frames.
        *   Implement a motion smoothing algorithm to reduce jerky movements and ensure realistic motion.
   *   **Output:** Temporally consistent sequence of upsampled frames.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function upsample_media(media_file):
  scene_graph = construct_scene_graph(media_file)
  for frame in media_file:
    motion_predictions = predict_motion(scene_graph, frame)
    upsampled_frame = upsample_frame(frame, motion_predictions, scene_graph)
    smoothed_frame = enforce_temporal_consistency(upsampled_frame)
    output_video.add_frame(smoothed_frame)
  return output_video
```

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond frame-by-frame or short-term temporal upsampling by leveraging a dynamic scene graph to capture the semantic context and predicted motion of objects. This enables a more coherent and realistic upsampling process that produces visually superior results. The use of a predictive motion module allows the system to anticipate object movements and generate more plausible upsampled frames.
