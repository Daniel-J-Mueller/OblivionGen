## Adaptive Dependency Shifting & Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Extend the failover workflow to proactively *shift* application dependencies *before* a full failover is triggered, based on predictive analysis of cell health and anticipated load. This isnâ€™t just about switching active/standby; it's about intelligently redistributing workload *before* a failure necessitates it, minimizing impact and improving overall resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Map & Scoring:**

*   **Data Structure:** A directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing all application dependencies. Nodes are application components/cells, edges represent dependencies (e.g., Cell A requires data from Cell B).
*   **Dependency Weighting:** Each edge is assigned a weight representing the criticality of that dependency. Higher weight = more critical. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on observed usage patterns.
*   **Health Scoring:** Each cell is assigned a health score based on real-time metrics (CPU, memory, network latency, error rates, etc.).  A weighted average of these metrics forms the overall health score. Scores are normalized (0-100).
*   **Predictive Analysis:** Implement a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future health scores for each cell.  This allows for anticipating potential failures *before* they occur.

**2. Adaptive Dependency Shifting Engine:**

*   **Triggering Condition:** If the predicted health score of a primary cell falls below a predefined threshold *and* a suitable secondary cell exists, initiate dependency shifting.
*   **Shifting Algorithm:**
    *   Identify dependencies originating from the at-risk primary cell.
    *   For each dependency, evaluate potential secondary cells as alternative providers.
    *   Rank secondary cells based on:
        *   Current health score.
        *   Network proximity to dependent cells.
        *   Current load.
    *   Redirect traffic for the dependency to the highest-ranked secondary cell.
    *   Update dependency map to reflect the new routing.
*   **Gradual Shift:** Implement a gradual shift mechanism.  Instead of abruptly switching all traffic, gradually increase the traffic routed to the secondary cell while monitoring performance.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If the secondary cell exhibits issues during the shift, automatically roll back to the original primary cell.

**3.  Workflow Integration:**

*   Extend the existing failover workflow to include the Adaptive Dependency Shifting step.
*   The failover workflow should now consist of:
    1.  Monitoring cell health & predicting potential failures.
    2.  Initiate Adaptive Dependency Shifting if a potential failure is detected.
    3.  If the Adaptive Dependency Shifting fails or is insufficient, proceed with a full failover to a designated secondary cell.

**4.  Data Propagation:**

*   Propagate the updated dependency map and routing instructions to all relevant components (traffic managers, DNS servers, load balancers).
*   Use a consistent data store for the dependency map to ensure all components have the latest information.

**Pseudocode Example (Dependency Shifting Decision):**

```
function decide_shift(primary_cell, secondary_cells):
  predicted_health = predict_health(primary_cell)
  if predicted_health < threshold:
    best_secondary = find_best_secondary(secondary_cells, primary_cell)
    if best_secondary != null:
      shift_dependencies(primary_cell, best_secondary)
      return true
  return false

function find_best_secondary(secondary_cells, primary_cell):
  best_secondary = null
  best_score = -1
  for secondary in secondary_cells:
    score = calculate_secondary_score(secondary, primary_cell)
    if score > best_score:
      best_score = score
      best_secondary = secondary
  return best_secondary

function calculate_secondary_score(secondary, primary):
  health_score = get_health_score(secondary)
  proximity_score = calculate_proximity(secondary, primary)
  load_score = get_load_score(secondary)
  return (health_score * weight_health) + (proximity_score * weight_proximity) + (load_score * weight_load)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced downtime and improved application resilience.
*   Proactive mitigation of potential failures.
*   Optimized resource utilization.
*   Improved user experience.
