## Distributed Entropy Harvesting & Session Key Sharding

**Concept:** Leverage geographically distributed, low-value IoT devices (smart thermostats, weather stations, connected vehicles) to contribute entropy to a central key derivation function, then shard the resulting session key across a dynamic quorum of those same devices. This creates a highly resilient and adaptable session key management system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Collection Agent (ECA):**

*   **Deployment:** Software component deployable on diverse IoT devices with minimal resource requirements.
*   **Entropy Sources:** Collect data from device sensors (temperature fluctuations, radio signal noise, accelerometer data, ambient light variation) and system metrics (CPU load, network packet timings, inter-key-press timing).
*   **Preprocessing:**  Apply Von Neumann debiasing and other entropy extraction techniques to raw sensor data.
*   **Communication:** Transmit entropy contributions via authenticated and encrypted channels (DTLS/TLS) to a central Entropy Aggregation Service (EAS).  Employ rate limiting and jitter to obscure contribution patterns.
*   **Attestation:** ECAs periodically attest their integrity and functionality to the EAS to prevent malicious entropy injection.

**2. Entropy Aggregation Service (EAS):**

*   **Entropy Mixing:** Receive entropy contributions from ECAs, apply statistical tests for randomness, and mix them using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).
*   **Key Derivation:** Use the mixed entropy as input to a Key Derivation Function (KDF) (e.g., HKDF) to generate a master session key.
*   **Sharding Algorithm:** Implement a secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing, Reed-Solomon coding) to divide the master session key into *n* shares. *k* shares are required to reconstruct the key (k < n).
*   **Dynamic Quorum Management:** Maintain a list of available ECAs and their current operational status.  Dynamically assign shares to ECAs based on factors like network connectivity, battery level, and geographic diversity.  Implement a rotating quorum – the set of ECAs holding shares changes periodically.
*   **Share Encryption:** Encrypt each share individually using a unique key derived from the ECA’s identity and a master encryption key managed by the EAS.
*   **Distribution:** Securely distribute encrypted shares to designated ECAs.

**3. Session Key Reconstruction Protocol:**

*   **Initiation:** When a secure session is required, the requesting entity (client or server) contacts the EAS.
*   **Quorum Selection:** The EAS selects a valid quorum of ECAs based on current availability and security constraints.
*   **Share Request:** The EAS instructs the selected ECAs to provide their encrypted shares.
*   **Share Delivery:** ECAs deliver their encrypted shares to the requesting entity.
*   **Decryption & Reconstruction:** The requesting entity decrypts the shares using the appropriate keys and reconstructs the master session key using the secret sharing algorithm.
*   **Session Establishment:** The reconstructed key is used to establish a secure communication channel (e.g., TLS, IPsec).



**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
// Client requests key reconstruction from EAS
request_key_reconstruction(session_id)

// EAS selects quorum of ECAs
quorum = select_quorum(session_id)

// EAS requests shares from quorum
shares = request_shares_from_quorum(quorum, session_id)

// Validate shares (integrity checks, timestamps)
if (validate_shares(shares)) {
    // Reconstruct key using secret sharing algorithm
    key = reconstruct_key(shares)
    return key
} else {
    // Key reconstruction failed
    error("Key reconstruction failed: invalid shares")
    return null
}
```

**Novelty:**

This design departs from traditional session key management by:

*   **Distributed Entropy:**  Leveraging a massive, distributed network of IoT devices for entropy generation, increasing randomness and resilience against attacks.
*   **Dynamic Quorum:**  Adapting the key-holding quorum based on device availability and network conditions, enhancing system robustness.
*   **Proactive Key Sharding:**  Sharding the key *before* the session starts, reducing the risk of compromise during session establishment.
*   **Decentralized Trust:** Minimizing reliance on a single trusted authority by distributing trust across multiple devices.
