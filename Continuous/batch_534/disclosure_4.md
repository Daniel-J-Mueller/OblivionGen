## Dynamic Multipath Group Sculpting via Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Expand the notion of multipath groups beyond simply re-associating routes. Introduce a system that *sculpts* multipath groups in real-time based on predicted load, not just reactive congestion. This moves beyond reacting to bottlenecks to proactively shaping traffic flow.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Load Balancer (PLB)
*   **Function:** Analyzes network traffic patterns (flows, destinations, times of day) to *predict* potential congestion points *before* they occur. Uses historical data and real-time telemetry.
*   **Data Sources:** NetFlow, sFlow, SNMP, BGP peering information, application-layer telemetry (where available).
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Hybrid approach – combines time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) with machine learning (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) trained on historical traffic data. Focus on short-term (seconds to minutes) prediction.
*   **Multipath Group Sculptor (MGS):**  The core component.  Receives predicted congestion data from PLB.  Dynamically adjusts multipath group composition.
    *   **Group Splitting:** If PLB predicts congestion on a specific interface *within* a multipath group, MGS splits the group.  The original group remains, and a *new* group is created containing only the congested interface and its immediate neighbors. This isolates the congestion.  Routes are dynamically re-associated to either the original or new group based on traffic flow.
    *   **Group Merging:** When congestion subsides, MGS merges the split groups back into a single multipath group.
    *   **Ghost Paths:** Introduce the concept of "ghost paths" – temporarily adding interfaces to a multipath group *even if* they aren't directly participating in the current flow.  These ghosts provide pre-emptive load balancing, increasing capacity *before* it's needed. This requires keeping a pool of standby interfaces.
*   **Hash Function Modification:** Dynamically adjust the hash functions used for selecting interfaces within a multipath group. This allows fine-grained control over traffic distribution, steering specific flows to less congested paths.  The adjustment is based on the PLB's predictions.
*   **Interface Weighting:** Assign weights to interfaces within a multipath group. Higher weights indicate a preference for that interface.  The weighting is adjusted dynamically based on the PLB's predictions.
*   **Control Plane Interface:** A REST API for configuring the PLB, MGS, and observing their behavior.

**Pseudocode (MGS Core Logic):**

```
function sculpt_multipath_groups(predicted_congestion_data, current_multipath_groups, routing_table):

  for each congestion_prediction in predicted_congestion_data:
    interface_id = congestion_prediction.interface_id
    congestion_level = congestion_prediction.congestion_level

    if congestion_level > threshold:
      # Split the multipath group containing the congested interface
      original_group = find_group_containing_interface(interface_id, current_multipath_groups)
      new_group = create_new_group(interface_id)

      # Re-associate routes. Prioritize re-routing flows contributing to the congestion
      for each route in routing_table:
        if route.destination == original_group.destination:
          if route.flow_contributes_to_congestion(interface_id):
            associate_route_with_group(route, new_group)
          else:
            associate_route_with_group(route, original_group)

      add_group_to_list(new_group, current_multipath_groups)

    else:
      # Check for groups that can be merged
      for each group in current_multipath_groups:
        if group.size == 1 and group.interface_id not in congested_interfaces: # interface not part of current congestion
          merge_group_with_neighbor(group, current_multipath_groups) # find a logical neighbor
```

**Novelty:** The focus shifts from *reactive* congestion avoidance to *proactive* traffic shaping. The introduction of ghost paths and dynamic hash function modification provide fine-grained control over traffic distribution.  Predictive load balancing is combined with real-time multipath group sculpting for a more resilient and efficient network. This goes beyond ECMP/WCMP to dynamic path selection.
