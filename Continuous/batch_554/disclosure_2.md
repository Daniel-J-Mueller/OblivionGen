**Decentralized Key Fragment Management with Bio-Authentication & Temporal Access**

**Concept:** Expand on the secure key management aspect, moving beyond centralized cryptographic computation engines (HSMs, etc.). Implement a system where a cryptographic key is *never* fully assembled in one location. Instead, it’s split into multiple “key fragments” distributed across a network of physically secure, low-cost devices – ideally integrated into everyday objects. Access to these fragments requires both bio-authentication *and* a time-based release.

**Specs:**

*   **Fragment Devices:** Small, tamper-resistant hardware modules (think secure element size) equipped with:
    *   Unique Device ID
    *   Secure Storage for a single key fragment (AES-256 encrypted)
    *   Biometric Sensor (fingerprint, voice, iris – configurable)
    *   Real-Time Clock (RTC) – synchronized with a trusted time source (NTP, etc.)
    *   Low-power communication interface (Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee)
    *   Limited processing capability (enough for encryption/decryption and authentication)
*   **Key Splitting Algorithm:** A robust secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) used to split the cryptographic key into *n* fragments.  *n* is configurable based on security requirements.
*   **Access Control Policy:** Defined on a per-key basis.  Specifies:
    *   Minimum number of fragments required for key reconstruction (*k*)
    *   Biometric authentication requirements (e.g., specific user profile)
    *   Temporal access window (e.g., key only reconstructable between 9 AM and 5 PM)
*   **Reconstruction Process:**
    1.  User initiates key reconstruction request.
    2.  System identifies nearby fragment devices.
    3.  User authenticates with each fragment device using biometric scan.
    4.  Fragment devices verify time window.
    5.  If authentication and time window are valid, the fragment device releases its fragment.
    6.  Fragments are collected and combined to reconstruct the key.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Tamper-evident hardware on fragment devices.
    *   Secure boot and firmware update mechanisms.
    *   Encryption of fragments in transit and at rest.
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructKey(keyID):
  fragmentList = findNearbyFragments()
  requiredFragments = getRequiredFragmentCount(keyID)
  authenticatedFragments = []

  for fragment in fragmentList:
    biometricData = getBiometricScan()
    if authenticateFragment(fragment, biometricData):
      if isValidTimeWindow(fragment):
        fragmentData = getFragmentData(fragment)
        authenticatedFragments.append(fragmentData)
      else:
        print("Time window invalid")
    else:
      print("Authentication failed")

  if len(authenticatedFragments) >= requiredFragments:
    reconstructedKey = combineFragments(authenticatedFragments)
    return reconstructedKey
  else:
    print("Not enough fragments authenticated")
    return null
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Highly secure access control for sensitive data.
*   Decentralized identity management.
*   Secure remote voting systems.
*   Physical security (e.g., unlocking valuable assets).

**Novelty:** This shifts away from centralizing key management, even with HSMs, and distributes trust across multiple physical devices, significantly increasing security and reducing single points of failure. Bio-authentication *and* temporal access add further layers of protection. It leverages the proliferation of IoT devices as potential key fragment hosts.
