## Flexible Camera Array with Dynamic Focal Point

**Concept:** A camera module utilizing a flexible substrate not just for structural support, but as an active component in achieving variable focal length and multi-point focusing. The core idea is to move individual microlenses *within* the flexible substrate, changing the effective focal length for each sensor element.

**Specifications:**

*   **Substrate Material:** Polyimide or similar high-flexibility, high-temperature resistant material with embedded conductive traces for power and signal routing.
*   **Sensor Array:** A dense array of miniature image sensors (e.g., global shutter sensors with pixel sizes < 2µm). Array dimensions: 1024x768, potentially scaling to 4K+.
*   **Microlens Array:** A corresponding array of individually addressable microlenses positioned directly *above* each sensor element, embedded within the flexible substrate. Each microlens is mounted on a micro-actuator.
*   **Micro-Actuators:** MEMS-based piezoelectric or electrostatic actuators.  Each actuator provides 3-axis control (X, Y, Z) of the corresponding microlens. Actuation range: +/- 50µm in each axis.  Response time: < 1ms.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated image processing unit (IPU) with embedded firmware to control the micro-actuators based on image analysis and user input. The IPU will manage power distribution, communication, and actuator calibration.
*   **Layer Stack:**
    1.  Protective outer layer (e.g., Parylene)
    2.  Microlens Array + Micro-Actuators
    3.  Flexible Substrate with embedded interconnects and power planes
    4.  Image Sensor Array
    5.  Backplane with I/O interfaces (MIPI CSI-2, USB-C)
*   **Power Consumption:** < 2W (target)
*   **Communication Protocol:** MIPI CSI-2 for high-bandwidth image data transfer.
*   **Dimensions:** Target module size: 20mm x 30mm x 2mm.
*   **Software Interface:**  API for controlling focal point, depth of field, and enabling advanced features (e.g., computational photography).

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize Camera Module
initialize_sensors()
initialize_actuators()
calibrate_system()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Capture image
  image = capture_image()

  // Analyze Image for Focus Areas
  focus_areas = analyze_image_focus(image)

  // For each focus area
  for (area in focus_areas) {
    // Calculate actuator movements
    movements = calculate_actuator_movements(area)

    // Apply movements to actuators
    apply_actuator_movements(movements)
  }

  // Process and output image
  processed_image = process_image(image)
  output_image(processed_image)
}

// Function: calculate_actuator_movements(area)
// Input: Area of interest in the image
// Output: Movement vector for the corresponding actuator
// Calculations: Based on distance to the object in the area, and desired focal length.  Uses a lookup table or a mathematical model.

// Function: apply_actuator_movements(movements)
// Input: Movement vector
// Output: Sends control signals to the corresponding actuator to move it.
```

**Novelty:** This design moves beyond fixed-focus or simple optical image stabilization. It enables *dynamic* control of the focal plane *across* the entire sensor array, allowing for complex depth-of-field effects, multi-point focusing, and potentially even holographic imaging capabilities. The flexible substrate isn't just a structural component, but an integral part of the optical system.
