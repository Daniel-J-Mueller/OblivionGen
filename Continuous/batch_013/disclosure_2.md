## Personalized Product Story Generation & AR Integration

**Concept:** Extend the user profiling and product assignment system to generate dynamic, personalized "product stories" delivered through Augmented Reality (AR) experiences. This goes beyond simple product assignment to build narrative around purchasing behavior and preferences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Story Seed Generation:**

*   **Input:** User purchase history (from existing system), identified product attributes (from existing system), cluster association (from existing system), social media data (opt-in, optional).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze user purchase history and cluster data to identify core "lifestyle themes" (e.g., "eco-conscious minimalist," "urban explorer," "home chef").
    *   Leverage social media data (if available) to refine lifestyle themes and identify user interests.
    *   Generate initial "story seeds" – short narrative frameworks related to the user’s lifestyle. Example: “A weekend getaway focused on sustainable travel.”
*   **Output:** A set of story seeds prioritized by relevance to the user profile.

**2. Dynamic Content Generation:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Select a story seed.
    *   Based on the user’s purchase history and product assignments, dynamically select products that fit the narrative. The existing product attributes are used to ensure product suitability within the story.
    *   Generate narrative text, image suggestions, and potentially short video scripts that weave the products into the story. Leverage AI-powered content generation tools. (Focus on evocative descriptions, not hard sales pitches.)
*   **Output:** A complete “product story” including text, images/videos, and a list of featured products.

**3. AR Integration & Delivery:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Develop an AR application that allows users to "experience" the product story in their own environment.
    *   The AR app should:
        *   Overlay product visualizations onto the user’s camera view.
        *   Play narrated story segments.
        *   Allow users to interact with virtual products (e.g., rotate, zoom, view details).
        *   Provide direct links to purchase the featured products.
*   **Delivery:**
    *   Push personalized product story AR experiences to users through a mobile app or via QR codes on product packaging/marketing materials.
    *   Allow users to "save" stories for later viewing and sharing.

**Pseudocode (AR Application Core Loop):**

```
initialize AR Session
load User Profile & Current Story
loop:
    capture camera feed
    track environment (using ARKit/ARCore)
    identify anchor points (surfaces, objects)
    render virtual products at anchor points
    play current story segment (text & audio)
    handle user interaction (tap, swipe, etc.)
        if interaction targets a product:
            display product details
            offer purchase link
        else:
            advance to next story segment
    if story complete:
        present option to view other stories or save current story
end loop
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Smartphone with AR capabilities (ARKit/ARCore).
*   Optional: AR glasses for a more immersive experience.

**Novelty:** This system extends product assignment from simple categorization to immersive storytelling. It leverages AR to create a personalized shopping experience that goes beyond traditional advertising. The use of lifestyle themes and dynamic content generation fosters a stronger connection between the user and the brand.
