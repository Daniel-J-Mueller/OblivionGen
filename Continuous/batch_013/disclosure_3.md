## Adaptive Hashing with Dynamic Secret Derivation

**Concept:** Extend the secret rotation idea to a system where the secret isn’t just rotated, but *dynamically derived* based on environmental factors and user behavior, enhancing security and providing a layer of plausible deniability.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Source:** Any data stream feeding into the hashing process (e.g., purchase data, user activity logs, sensor readings).
*   **Environmental Sensor Integration:** Direct integration with environmental sensors (time-of-day, geolocation, network conditions – IP address, device type).
*   **Behavioral Analyzer:** Module to analyze user behavior patterns (frequency of actions, type of actions, time between actions).
*   **Secret Derivation Function (SDF):** Core component. Takes data from the Data Source, Environmental Sensors, and Behavioral Analyzer as input. Outputs a unique cryptographic secret.
*   **Hashing Engine:** Utilizes the secret generated by the SDF to perform hashing on the input data.
*   **Metadata Store:** Stores the input data, hashed output, and metadata associated with the secret derivation (timestamp, environmental readings, behavioral features).

**2. Secret Derivation Function (SDF) Details:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Raw Data: The data to be hashed.
    *   Environmental Data: Timestamp, geolocation (coarse-grained – city level), network information (IP address prefix, device type).
    *   Behavioral Data: Frequency of recent actions, types of recent actions, time since last action.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from all input data sources.
    2.  **Feature Concatenation:** Combine extracted features into a single vector.
    3.  **Key Derivation:** Use a Key Derivation Function (KDF – e.g., HKDF, PBKDF2) with the concatenated features as input and a master seed to derive the cryptographic secret.  The master seed is stored securely and rarely changed.
*   **Output:** Cryptographic secret.

**3. Pseudocode – SDF:**

```pseudocode
function derive_secret(raw_data, environmental_data, behavioral_data, master_seed):
    # Feature Extraction
    environmental_features = extract_features(environmental_data)
    behavioral_features = extract_features(behavioral_data)

    # Concatenation
    combined_features = concatenate(environmental_features, behavioral_features)

    # Key Derivation
    secret = HKDF(master_seed, combined_features, 'SHA256') # Using HKDF as example

    return secret
```

**4. Data Flow:**

1.  Data Source generates raw data.
2.  Environmental Sensors collect environmental data.
3.  Behavioral Analyzer monitors user behavior.
4.  SDF derives a cryptographic secret based on all three inputs.
5.  Hashing Engine hashes the raw data using the derived secret.
6.  Metadata Store stores the raw data, hashed output, secret derivation metadata, and environmental/behavioral features.

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   **Master Seed Protection:**  The master seed must be stored securely (e.g., using Hardware Security Module - HSM).
*   **Feature Selection:** Carefully select features to balance security and usability. Avoid overly sensitive personal information.
*   **Entropy:** Ensure sufficient entropy in the combined features.
*   **Regular Audit:** Regularly audit the SDF and related components.

**6.  Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Enhanced Data Privacy:**  Make it harder to correlate data across different sources.
*   **Fraud Detection:**  Detect anomalous behavior patterns.
*   **Plausible Deniability:**  Provide a layer of plausible deniability by obscuring the direct link between data and the hashing process.  (The system could legitimately generate different hashes for the same data based on environmental variations.)
