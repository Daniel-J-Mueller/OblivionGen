## Adaptive Predictive Policing & Anomaly Detection System - "Guardian"

**System Overview:**

Guardian extends the core concept of local data processing for A/V devices to incorporate a distributed, adaptive predictive policing and anomaly detection layer. It moves beyond simple identification to proactively assess risk and alert authorities *before* incidents occur, leveraging collective learning across a network of devices.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Enhanced A/V Devices:** Existing A/V devices (security cameras, doorbells) augmented with dedicated Neural Processing Units (NPUs) for on-device AI processing.
*   **Local Data Hub:** Each installation features a secure, encrypted local data hub (Raspberry Pi 5 equivalent) responsible for pre-processing data, running initial AI models, and managing communication.
*   **Regional Aggregation Servers:** Secure servers managed by authorized entities (law enforcement, security firms) that aggregate anonymized data from local hubs within a defined geographic region.

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Baseline Creation:**
    *   Each A/V device, over a configurable period (e.g., 1 week), builds a behavioral baseline for its immediate environment. This involves:
        *   Object detection and tracking (people, vehicles, animals).
        *   Time-of-day activity patterns.
        *   Frequency of events (doorbell rings, vehicle passages).
        *   Sound analysis (normal ambient sounds).
    *   Data is anonymized at the local hub level to protect privacy.
2.  **Anomaly Detection – Local Level:**
    *   The NPU on each A/V device continuously monitors captured data and compares it against the established baseline.
    *   Anomalies are flagged based on configurable thresholds:
        *   Unexpected objects or people.
        *   Activity outside of normal time windows.
        *   Unusual sounds (e.g., glass breaking, shouting).
        *   Loitering behavior (detected through object tracking).
    *   Local alerts are generated only when multiple anomalies are detected within a short timeframe, reducing false positives.
3.  **Collective Learning & Predictive Modeling – Regional Level:**
    *   Anonymized anomaly data from all local hubs within a region is aggregated at the Regional Aggregation Server.
    *   A federated learning model is trained on this data to identify patterns indicative of potential criminal activity.  This model *does not* store personally identifiable information.
    *   The model generates “risk scores” for specific areas based on observed anomalies.
    *   The model updates continually as new data is received.
4.  **Predictive Alerting & Resource Allocation:**
    *   Based on the risk scores, the system can:
        *   Increase the sensitivity of A/V devices in high-risk areas.
        *   Alert law enforcement to potential threats *before* they escalate.
        *   Optimize patrol routes and resource allocation based on predictive analysis.
5.  **"Ghost Mode" – Simulated Event Injection:**
    *   The system incorporates a simulated event injection module.
    *   Authorized personnel can inject simulated events (e.g., a virtual person approaching a building) to test the system's response and identify vulnerabilities.
    *   This allows for proactive security audits and model refinement.

**Pseudocode – Anomaly Detection (Local Level):**

```
function detectAnomaly(image_data, current_time):
  objects = objectDetection(image_data)
  activity = analyzeActivity(objects, current_time)

  anomaly_score = 0

  if unexpectedObject(objects):
    anomaly_score += 5

  if activityOutsideNormalHours(activity):
    anomaly_score += 3

  if unusualSoundDetected(image_data):
    anomaly_score += 4

  if loiteringDetected(objects):
    anomaly_score += 2

  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    generateLocalAlert(anomaly_score)
    sendAnonymizedDataToRegionalServer()
```

**Privacy Considerations:**

*   All data is anonymized at the local hub level before being transmitted.
*   Facial recognition is disabled by default.
*   Users have full control over data sharing preferences.
*   The system is designed to comply with all relevant privacy regulations.
