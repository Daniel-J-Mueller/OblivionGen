## Adaptive Layer Tree Compression with Predictive Rendering

**Concept:** Extend the layer tree approach by introducing a compression scheme dynamically adjusted based on client device capabilities *and* predicted user interaction. This goes beyond simply reducing layer count; it anticipates *how* the user will interact with the page and pre-renders/compresses accordingly.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Client Capability Profiling:**
    *   The network computing provider maintains a database of client device profiles (CPU, GPU, memory, network bandwidth, screen resolution, supported image formats).
    *   Initial handshake establishes/updates the client profile.

2.  **Interaction Prediction Engine:**
    *   Server-side AI model analyzes page content (layout, interactive elements, common user flows) to predict likely user interactions (scrolling direction, element clicks, form inputs).  This operates on a probabilistic basis.
    *   Prediction horizon: 2-5 seconds.
    *   Output: A ranked list of predicted interactions with confidence scores.

3.  **Adaptive Layer Tree Generation:**
    *   The original DOM is processed as described in the patent.
    *   **Compression Levels:**  Three levels are defined:
        *   **Level 1 (High):** Aggressive layer merging, low-resolution image proxies, minimal CSS properties retained. Used for background elements & regions *not* predicted for near-term interaction.
        *   **Level 2 (Medium):**  Balanced layer count, medium-resolution images, core CSS properties. Default for initial load and elements with moderate interaction probability.
        *   **Level 3 (Full):**  Detailed layers, high-resolution images, complete CSS. Reserved for elements *highly* likely to be interacted with immediately.
    *   **Dynamic Assignment:**  The interaction prediction engine guides layer tree construction. Layers are assigned compression levels based on predicted interaction probability.
    *   Example: A navigation bar predicted to be clicked within 100ms gets Level 3. A far-off footer gets Level 1.

4.  **Pre-Rendering & Caching:**
    *   Server pre-renders key UI states based on the interaction prediction. For example, if the prediction is a button click, pre-render the resulting UI.
    *   Pre-rendered states are cached (server-side).
    *   The layer tree *includes* metadata identifying pre-rendered states and associated layer segments.

5.  **Client-Side Handling:**
    *   The client receives the adaptive layer tree with compression levels and pre-render metadata.
    *   The client dynamically loads/decodes layers based on compression level (prioritizing high-priority layers).
    *   For predicted interactions, the client seamlessly switches to the pre-rendered state (avoiding a full re-render).
    *   If the predicted interaction doesnâ€™t occur, the client reverts to the original layer tree rendering.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Layer Decoding):**

```
function decodeLayer(layerData, priority):
  if priority == HIGH:
    decodeFullResolution(layerData.imageContent)
    applyCSS(layerData.cssProperties)
    return layer

  else if priority == MEDIUM:
    decodeMediumResolution(layerData.imageContent)
    applyCoreCSS(layerData.cssProperties)
    return layer

  else: //priority == LOW
    decodeLowResolutionProxy(layerData.imageContent)
    return layer

function handlePredictedInteraction(interactionType, layerSegment):
  if preRenderedStateExists(layerSegment):
    switch toPreRenderedState(layerSegment)
  else:
    //Handle fallback rendering
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced bandwidth usage.
*   Faster initial page load.
*   Improved responsiveness (reduced latency for common interactions).
*   Enhanced user experience.
