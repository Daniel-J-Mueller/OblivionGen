## Adaptive Secret Distribution via Biometric Drift

**Concept:** Extend the ‘one-time’ secret distribution system with an adaptive mechanism tied to biometric data drift. This shifts the focus from solely validating a *static* secret to verifying continuous biometric ‘health’ as a condition for ongoing access. This creates a dynamic credential, not just a single-use one.

**Specs:**

*   **Biometric Baseline Capture:** Upon initial enrollment, capture a multi-factor biometric profile (fingerprint, voiceprint, facial recognition, potentially even gait analysis via mobile device sensors). Establish a baseline ‘drift tolerance’ – an acceptable range of change for each biometric factor. This is crucial; minor, natural fluctuations shouldn’t revoke access.
*   **Secret Association with Biometric Profile:**  Instead of associating the secret *directly* with a user identity, link it to their biometric profile.  The secret acts as an initial key to unlock access, *then* continuous biometric verification maintains that access.
*   **Continuous Biometric Monitoring:**  Client devices passively (or actively, with user consent) monitor enrolled biometric factors. This doesn’t require constant scanning, but periodic checks.  Frequency determined by risk profile associated with the resource being accessed.
*   **Drift Detection & Challenge:** Implement an algorithm to detect significant deviation (drift) from the established biometric baseline. A ‘significant’ drift triggers a challenge – requiring re-authentication or a more robust biometric scan.
*   **Secret Refresh on Drift:**  If drift is detected *and* successfully challenged, the system *refreshes* the associated secret. This isn’t a completely new secret, but a cryptographic derivative of the old one, tied to the updated biometric profile.  This ensures the secret remains valid even with minor physiological changes.
*   **Secret Revocation & Anomaly Detection:** Extreme or rapid biometric drift (indicative of spoofing or compromised health) triggers immediate secret revocation and alerts security personnel.  Machine learning can identify anomalous drift patterns.
*   **Dynamic Drift Tolerance Adjustment:** Allow administrators to adjust drift tolerance levels based on user groups, resource sensitivity, and threat landscape.
*   **Client-Side Biometric Processing:**  Prioritize client-side biometric processing to minimize data transmission and enhance privacy.  Only drift data and challenge requests are sent to the server.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Drift Detection):**

```
function detectBiometricDrift(currentBiometricData, baselineBiometricData, driftThreshold) {
  driftScore = 0
  for each biometricFactor in biometricFactors {
    difference = abs(currentBiometricData[biometricFactor] - baselineBiometricData[biometricFactor])
    driftScore += min(difference / driftThreshold, 1) // Normalize to 0-1
  }

  if (driftScore > aggregateDriftThreshold) {
    return true // Drift detected
  } else {
    return false // No drift
  }
}

function refreshSecret(oldSecret, currentBiometricData) {
    // Use biometric data as a salt to derive new secret from old secret
    newSecret = HMAC_SHA256(oldSecret, currentBiometricData)
    return newSecret
}
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   Enhanced Security:  Spoofing becomes much harder, as attackers need to replicate both biometric data *and* maintain consistent drift.
*   Dynamic Access Control: Access adapts to the user’s physiological state, providing a more granular level of control.
*   Fraud Prevention: Detects compromised identities or health conditions that might indicate malicious activity.
*   Passive Authentication: Continuous monitoring reduces reliance on user interaction.
