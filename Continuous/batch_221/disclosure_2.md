## Dynamic Permission Scoping via Temporal Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the temporal credential revocation system to not just *revoke* compromised credentials, but to *dynamically scope* permissions *during* a session based on observed behavior and risk assessment. This moves beyond simple "allow/deny" to a more granular, context-aware access control.

**Specs:**

1.  **Risk Engine Integration:**  A dedicated Risk Engine module integrated into the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. This engine consumes telemetry data (API calls, resource access, user behavior) and assigns a real-time risk score to the active session.

2.  **Permission Profiles:** Define multiple permission profiles (e.g., “Base”, “Read-Heavy”, “Write-Limited”, “Sensitive-Data-Access”). Each profile represents a set of permissions appropriate for different risk levels.

3.  **Temporal Permission Adjustment:**
    *   Upon initial credential issuance, assign a default permission profile (e.g., “Base”).
    *   The Risk Engine continuously monitors the session.
    *   If the risk score *increases*:
        *   Dynamically *reduce* the active permission profile (e.g., from “Base” to “Read-Heavy”).
        *   New credentials (with the reduced profile) are issued *without interrupting the session*. The old credentials are invalidated immediately after the new ones are obtained.
    *   If the risk score *decreases*:
        *   Dynamically *increase* the active permission profile (e.g., from “Read-Heavy” to “Base”).
        *   New credentials (with the expanded profile) are issued *without interrupting the session*. The old credentials are invalidated immediately after the new ones are obtained.

4.  **Credential Format:** The temporary security credentials *must* include a field indicating the *active permission profile*. This profile is checked on every API call.

5.  **API Enhancement:**  All API endpoints require the presentation of the *active permission profile* in the authentication token. The endpoint then verifies that the requested action is permitted by the presented profile.

6.  **Revocation Override:**  Despite dynamic adjustments, standard revocation procedures remain in place for critical security breaches.

**Pseudocode (IAM Service - Permission Adjustment Logic):**

```
function adjustPermissions(sessionId, telemetryData):
  riskScore = RiskEngine.calculateRisk(telemetryData)

  currentProfile = sessionStore.getSessionProfile(sessionId)
  targetProfile = determineProfile(riskScore) // Function to map risk score to profile

  if (currentProfile != targetProfile):
    newCredentials = generateCredentials(sessionId, targetProfile)
    sessionStore.updateSessionCredentials(sessionId, newCredentials)
    invalidateCredentials(sessionId, currentCredentials) //Old credentials
    return newCredentials
  else:
    return currentCredentials

function determineProfile(riskScore):
  if (riskScore < 30):
    return "Base"
  else if (riskScore < 70):
    return "Read-Heavy"
  else:
    return "Write-Limited"
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Performance is critical. Permission adjustment *must* be fast to avoid user experience impact. Caching and optimized data structures are essential.
*   Auditing: Every permission adjustment must be logged for security and compliance purposes.
*   Granularity: The number of permission profiles and the criteria for adjusting them can be customized.
*   Integration with existing IAM systems.
