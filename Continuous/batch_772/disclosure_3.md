## Dynamic Content Reframing Based on Gaze Tracking

**Concept:** Extend orientation lock functionality by dynamically reframing content *within* the existing orientation, responding to user gaze, rather than rigidly locking the entire screen. This allows for a more fluid, adaptive user experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Integrated Eye-Tracking System:  High-resolution, low-latency eye-tracking capable of determining gaze position on the display.  Minimum sampling rate: 60Hz.
*   Device Orientation Sensor: Existing accelerometer and gyroscope.
*   Processor:  Sufficient processing power to handle real-time gaze data analysis and content reframing.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Gaze Tracker:**  Module to capture and process gaze data, converting it into (x, y) coordinates on the display.
*   **Content Analyzer:**  Module to analyze displayed content, identifying key elements (text blocks, images, interactive elements).  Utilizes computer vision techniques.
*   **Reframing Engine:**  Core module.  Receives gaze coordinates and content analysis data.  Dynamically adjusts content position within the existing display orientation.
*   **User Profile/Learning Module:**  Tracks user gaze patterns and preferences.  Allows the reframing engine to personalize content adjustment.
*   **Orientation Lock Override:** Disables/bypasses the standard orientation lock when active.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initialization:** Device initializes eye-tracking system. Orientation lock functionality is initially enabled or disabled via settings.
2.  **Gaze Detection:** Gaze Tracker continuously captures and processes user gaze data.
3.  **Content Analysis:**  Content Analyzer identifies key content elements in the current display.
4.  **Reframing Logic:**
    *   If the userâ€™s gaze consistently falls near the edge of the screen *within* a predetermined time window (e.g., 2 seconds), the Reframing Engine subtly adjusts the content, shifting it to keep key elements within the user's immediate field of vision.
    *   Adjustment should be minimal, avoiding jarring movements. Target movement: < 5% of screen width/height.
    *   The system prioritizes maintaining the visual hierarchy of the content.
    *   The algorithm accounts for the size and importance of content elements, prioritizing larger or more interactive elements.
5.  **User Profile Updates:** The User Profile/Learning Module records gaze patterns and adjusts the sensitivity and behavior of the Reframing Engine over time.
6.  **Override Toggle:**  A user-configurable setting allows toggling the "dynamic reframing" feature on/off. When off, standard orientation lock operates normally.

**4. Pseudocode (Reframing Engine):**

```
FUNCTION ReframingLogic(gazeX, gazeY, contentAnalysisData)
  IF gazeX < screenWidth * 0.2 AND contentAnalysisData.importantElementNearEdge = TRUE THEN
    shiftContent("left", 0.05 * screenWidth)
  ENDIF
  IF gazeX > screenWidth * 0.8 AND contentAnalysisData.importantElementNearEdge = TRUE THEN
    shiftContent("right", 0.05 * screenWidth)
  ENDIF
  IF gazeY < screenHeight * 0.2 AND contentAnalysisData.importantElementNearEdge = TRUE THEN
    shiftContent("up", 0.05 * screenHeight)
  ENDIF
  IF gazeY > screenHeight * 0.8 AND contentAnalysisData.importantElementNearEdge = TRUE THEN
    shiftContent("down", 0.05 * screenHeight)
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION shiftContent(direction, amount)
  // Apply a smooth, animated shift to the content area
  // Respect content boundaries to avoid clipping
  // Update content position within the display area
END FUNCTION

```

**5.  UI/UX Considerations:**

*   Subtle visual cues to indicate content shifting is occurring. (e.g., a brief, localized animation)
*   User-adjustable sensitivity settings.
*   Option to disable the feature entirely.
*   Adaptive learning to minimize unnecessary adjustments.
*   A dedicated settings panel to configure behavior.
