## Dynamic Feature Weighting based on Temporal Coherence

**Concept:** Extend the 3D object search system by incorporating temporal information from video streams. Instead of treating each frame as independent, leverage the coherence of features across consecutive frames to dynamically weight feature importance during object identification. This addresses potential ambiguities in static image analysis and improves robustness to occlusion or varying viewpoints.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Feature Tracking:**
    *   Implement a feature tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, optical flow) to maintain a history of feature locations and descriptors across multiple frames in a video stream.
    *   Assign a "coherence score" to each tracked feature, representing the consistency of its trajectory over time.  Factors contributing to the coherence score:
        *   Duration of track (longer tracks = higher score)
        *   Smoothness of trajectory (lower acceleration/jerk = higher score)
        *   Consistency of descriptor (smaller change in descriptor value over time = higher score)

2.  **Dynamic Feature Weighting:**
    *   During object identification in a new frame, calculate a weighted sum of probabilities derived from each feature.
    *   The weight assigned to each feature is proportional to its coherence score. Higher coherence = higher weight.
    *   Formula:  `Weighted Probability = Î£ (Probability_i * Coherence_i)` where:
        *   `Probability_i` is the probability of a match for feature *i* against the stored 3D object data.
        *   `Coherence_i` is the coherence score of feature *i*.

3.  **Adaptive Thresholding:**
    *   Implement an adaptive threshold for feature acceptance. Features with low coherence scores (below a dynamic threshold) are either discarded or given a significantly reduced weight.
    *   The dynamic threshold is adjusted based on the overall scene dynamics and the confidence in feature tracking.

4.  **Occlusion Handling:**
    *   If a feature is temporarily occluded, its coherence score should decay gracefully but not immediately drop to zero. Maintain a memory of the feature's previous location and descriptor to facilitate re-identification when it reappears.

5. **Implementation Notes:**
    *   Utilize a sliding window approach to track features over a limited number of frames to reduce computational cost.
    *   Explore different coherence score calculation methods and weighting schemes to optimize performance.
    *   Consider using a machine learning model to learn optimal weighting parameters based on training data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each frame in video stream:
    // Track features using optical flow or similar algorithm
    trackedFeatures = trackFeatures(frame)

    // Calculate coherence score for each tracked feature
    for each feature in trackedFeatures:
        coherenceScore = calculateCoherenceScore(feature.trajectory, feature.descriptorHistory)

    // Identify potential 3D objects in the frame
    potentialObjects = identifyObjects(frame, trackedFeatures)

    // Calculate weighted probability for each object
    for each object in potentialObjects:
        weightedProbability = 0
        for each feature in object.features:
            probability = calculateProbability(feature.descriptor, storedObjectData)
            weightedProbability += probability * feature.coherenceScore
        object.weightedProbability = weightedProbability

    // Rank objects based on weighted probability
    rankedObjects = sortObjectsByWeightedProbability(potentialObjects)

    // Output the top-ranked object
    outputObject = rankedObjects[0]
