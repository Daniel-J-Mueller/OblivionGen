## Dynamic Request Shadowing & Synthetic Load Generation

**Concept:** Extend the existing traffic metric collection system to not only *observe* request flows, but to dynamically create “shadow” requests and inject synthetic load, mirroring live traffic patterns. This allows for proactive performance testing, fault injection, and capacity planning *without* impacting production systems.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** *Shadow Request Generator (SRG)* – a module integrated with the Traffic Metric Collection System.
*   **Data Input:** SRG receives the same route identifiers and counters as the existing system, *plus* request payload snapshots (configurable sampling rate) from service interactions.
*   **Shadow Request Creation:**
    *   Based on observed traffic (route identifiers, counters, payloads), SRG creates synthetic requests.
    *   Synthetic requests are cloned from live requests – preserving data structure and, if safe (determined by policy), data values (sanitized for PII where necessary).
    *   Control parameters:
        *   *Shadow Rate:* Percentage of live traffic to shadow (0-100%).
        *   *Target Environment:*  Specify the destination for shadow requests – staging, QA, dedicated test environment.
        *   *Payload Modification:* Allow for configurable modifications to payload data for specific test scenarios (e.g., error injection, boundary value testing).
        *   *Latency Injection:* Introduce artificial latency to shadow requests to simulate network conditions or service degradation.
*   **Traffic Injection:**  SRG injects shadow requests into the target environment, mimicking the flow of live traffic.
*   **Metric Correlation:**  The Traffic Metric Collection System *also* collects metrics from the target environment (response times, error rates) for the shadow requests.  These metrics are correlated with the original live traffic metrics, providing a comprehensive view of performance and dependencies.
*   **Fault Injection:** Introduce errors or delays at configurable points in the shadow request flow, allowing for testing of downstream service resilience.
*   **Auto-Scaling Simulation:**  SRG can dynamically adjust the shadow rate to simulate peak load conditions, enabling proactive auto-scaling validation.

**Pseudocode (SRG core logic):**

```
// Event: Received metric message (route_id, counter) from service
onMetricReceived(route_id, counter) {
  // Check if shadow generation is enabled for this route
  if (isShadowEnabled(route_id)) {
    // Calculate number of shadow requests to generate
    shadowCount = counter * shadowRate(route_id);

    // For each shadow request:
    for (i = 0; i < shadowCount; i++) {
      // Clone request payload (sample, sanitize)
      shadowPayload = clonePayload(route_id);

      // Inject latency (configurable)
      shadowPayload = injectLatency(shadowPayload, route_id);

      // Construct shadow request
      shadowRequest = createRequest(route_id, shadowPayload);

      // Send shadow request to target environment
      sendRequest(shadowRequest, targetEnvironment(route_id));
    }
  }
}

// Function to get target environment for route
targetEnvironment(route_id) {
  // Look up target environment configuration based on route_id
  // Return environment details (URL, authentication)
}

// Function to inject latency
injectLatency(payload, route_id) {
  // Look up latency configuration for route_id
  // Add delay to request payload
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Performance Testing:** Identify performance bottlenecks *before* they impact users.
*   **Resilience Validation:** Test the robustness of the system against failures.
*   **Capacity Planning:**  Ensure the system can handle anticipated load.
*   **Reduced Risk:** Test changes in a realistic environment without affecting production.
