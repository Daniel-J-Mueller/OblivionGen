## Adaptive Biofeedback Case

**Concept:** An earbud case incorporating biometric sensors and adaptive sound personalization triggered by the user’s physiological state.

**Specs:**

*   **Case Material:** Durable, hypoallergenic polymer blend with integrated flexible circuit layer. Matte finish for grip.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Sensor:** Capacitive sensor array embedded in the contact points where the earbuds rest within the case. Measures subtle changes in skin conductivity.
    *   **Skin Temperature Sensor:** Thermistor integrated into the case’s interior surface.
    *   **Accelerometer/Gyroscope:** Detects case movement and orientation. Aids in identifying user activity (walking, running, stationary).
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M series microcontroller.
*   **Bluetooth Module:** Bluetooth 5.3 for communication with earbuds and smartphone app.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging (Qi standard) + USB-C port.  Small internal battery (200mAh).
*   **LED Indicators:** Discrete RGB LEDs for charging status, Bluetooth connection, and biofeedback alerts.
*   **Dimensions:** Slightly larger than standard earbud cases to accommodate components, approx. 70mm x 45mm x 30mm.
*   **Weight:** Approximately 60 grams.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Biofeedback Acquisition:** When the earbuds are placed in the case, the sensors collect HRV and skin temperature data. The accelerometer/gyroscope logs movement.
2.  **Data Processing:** The microcontroller processes the sensor data to determine the user's current physiological state:
    *   **Stress Level:** Derived from HRV analysis.  High HRV generally indicates lower stress, while low HRV suggests higher stress.
    *   **Activity Level:**  Determined by accelerometer/gyroscope data. (Sedentary, Walking, Running, etc.)
    *   **Emotional State (Inferred):** Combine HRV, skin temperature and activity to *estimate* user emotion (Calm, Focused, Excited, Anxious). This is a probabilistic estimate.
3.  **Sound Profile Adaptation (via Earbuds):** The case transmits this data to the earbuds via Bluetooth. The earbuds then *dynamically adjust* the sound profile based on the user's state:
    *   **Stress/Anxiety:** Activate noise cancellation, play ambient soundscapes (nature sounds, white noise), and reduce bass frequencies.
    *   **Focus:**  Enable transparency mode, emphasize frequencies associated with speech clarity, and apply binaural beats to promote concentration.
    *   **Excitement/Energy:** Increase bass and dynamic range, and enhance the overall audio experience.
    *   **Sedentary:** Subtly shift equalization to avoid "ear fatigue" during prolonged use.
4.  **Smartphone App Integration:**
    *   Data Logging & Visualization: Users can view historical data on stress levels, activity, and sound profile adjustments.
    *   Customization: Users can personalize sound profiles for different states.
    *   Biofeedback Training: Guided exercises to improve HRV and manage stress.
    *   Alerts: Optional notifications when the system detects unusually high stress levels.

**Pseudocode (Earbud Side - Sound Profile Adjustment):**

```
function adjustSoundProfile(stressLevel, activityLevel, emotionalState) {
  // Base profile (user-defined)
  soundProfile = getDefaultProfile();

  if (stressLevel > thresholdHigh) {
    soundProfile.noiseCancellation = true;
    soundProfile.ambientSoundscape = true; // Play nature sounds
    soundProfile.bassBoost = false;
    soundProfile.equalization = "Calming";
  } else if (activityLevel == "Running") {
    soundProfile.noiseCancellation = false;
    soundProfile.bassBoost = true;
    soundProfile.equalization = "Energetic";
  } else if (emotionalState == "Focused") {
    soundProfile.transparencyMode = true;
    soundProfile.speechClarityBoost = true;
    soundProfile.binauralBeats = true; // Play specific frequencies
  } else {
    // Default profile
  }

  applySoundProfile(soundProfile);
}
```
