## Dynamic Foveated Streaming with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Enhance video streaming efficiency by dynamically adjusting stream resolution based not only on predicted gaze (foveated rendering is known) but *also* by predicting object occlusion within the scene and drastically reducing detail for occluded regions *before* they are rendered/streamed.  This goes beyond simply reducing resolution â€“ it alters the encoding priority and data sent.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Video stream, camera parameters (intrinsic/extrinsic), depth map (or point cloud) estimation (can be from SLAM or similar).  User gaze tracking data.
*   **Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Scene Reconstruction:**  A lightweight, real-time 3D scene reconstruction module processes the depth map/point cloud to build a sparse representation of the environment.
    2.  **Occlusion Prediction:**  Based on scene reconstruction, camera position, and user gaze, the system predicts regions of the scene that will be fully or partially occluded by other objects *before* rendering the next frame. This is a key step - prediction is happening in advance of rendering.
    3.  **Priority Map Generation:** A priority map is created for the next frame.  This map assigns a resolution/detail level to each region of the frame based on:
        *   **Gaze Proximity:** Regions near the user's gaze receive the highest priority (highest resolution/detail).
        *   **Occlusion Prediction:** Regions predicted to be occluded receive the *lowest* priority (potentially represented by a very low-resolution placeholder or even discarded entirely).  The level of reduction is dynamically adjusted.
        *   **Motion Vectors:** Regions with significant motion (determined through frame differencing) receive intermediate priority.
    4.  **Encoding Optimization:** The video encoder utilizes the priority map to:
        *   **Variable Bitrate Allocation:** Allocate more bitrate to high-priority regions and less to low-priority regions.
        *   **Tile-Based Encoding:** Encode the frame in tiles, allowing independent encoding and prioritization of each tile.
        *   **Adaptive Quantization:** Apply stronger quantization (more compression) to low-priority tiles.
        *   **Tile Dropping:** In extreme cases of occlusion, completely drop low-priority tiles from the stream.
    5.  **Streaming:** The encoded video stream is transmitted to the client.
    6.  **Client-Side Rendering:** The client reconstructs the frame using the received tiles.  Placeholder content is used for missing tiles.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `PriorityMap`:  A 2D array where each element represents a region of the frame and stores a priority level (e.g., 0-100).
    *   `OcclusionRegion`:  A data structure defining the boundaries of an occluded region in the frame.
    *   `Tile`:  A representation of a portion of the frame, with associated priority and encoding settings.

*   **Pseudocode (Encoding Optimization):**

```
function encodeFrame(frame, priorityMap):
  tiles = splitFrameIntoTiles(frame)
  for tile in tiles:
    priority = priorityMap[tile.x, tile.y]
    if priority < occlusionThreshold:
      // Drop the tile or encode it with minimal detail
      encodedTile = encodeMinimalDetailTile(tile)
    elif priority > gazeThreshold:
      // Encode the tile with high quality
      encodedTile = encodeHighQualityTile(tile)
    else:
      // Encode the tile with medium quality
      encodedTile = encodeMediumQualityTile(tile)
    append encodedTile to encodedStream
  return encodedStream
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:**
    *   GPU acceleration for depth map processing and 3D scene reconstruction.
    *   High-bandwidth network connection for streaming.
    *   Sufficient processing power on the client side to handle missing tiles and placeholder rendering.
