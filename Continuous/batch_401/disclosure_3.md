## Dynamic Rule Graph Partitioning & Federated Learning

**Concept:** Extend the rule graph concept by enabling dynamic partitioning of the graph across multiple computational nodes (edge devices, servers) and leveraging federated learning to refine rule sets without centralizing data. This builds on the idea of traversing a complex rule graph but introduces a distributed, adaptive element.

**Specifications:**

**1. Graph Partitioning Engine:**

*   **Input:** Full rule graph (as defined in the provided patent), desired number of partitions (N), computational resource constraints for each node.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a graph partitioning algorithm (e.g., METIS, ParMETIS) optimized for minimizing edge cuts while respecting node capacity constraints.
    *   Assign nodes (representing rule criteria/segments) to partitions.
    *   Generate a "linking map" defining inter-partition dependencies (edges crossing partition boundaries).
    *   Re-partition dynamically based on real-time load balancing metrics (CPU, memory usage).
*   **Output:** N partitioned rule graphs, linking map, load balancing metrics.

**2. Federated Rule Refinement Module:**

*   **Input:** Partitioned rule graphs, local data on each node, global model parameters (initial rule weights).
*   **Process:**
    *   Each node trains a local model (e.g., a small neural network or decision tree) on its assigned portion of the rule graph, using local data.  The local model predicts whether a given record matches a rule set.
    *   Nodes exchange model *updates* (gradients or parameters), not raw data.  Secure aggregation techniques (e.g., differential privacy) are employed to protect data privacy during exchange.
    *   A central server (or a distributed consensus mechanism) aggregates the model updates to create a global model.
    *   The updated global model is distributed back to each node.
    *   Repeat training and aggregation steps iteratively.
*   **Output:** Refined global model, updated rule weights, privacy metrics.

**3. Distributed Record Matching Service:**

*   **Input:** Record data, global model.
*   **Process:**
    *   Record data is initially processed by a “routing node” to determine the optimal partition for matching. This decision is based on feature values relevant to the initial layers of the rule graph.
    *   The record data is routed to the assigned partition.
    *   Within the partition, the record data traverses the rule graph using the refined global model (updated rule weights) to determine matching rule sets.
    *   Rule information is generated and associated with the record.
*   **Output:** Rule information, matching rule sets.

**Pseudocode (Distributed Record Matching Service):**

```
function matchRecord(recordData):
  routingNode = selectRoutingNode(recordData)
  partition = routingNode.determinePartition(recordData)
  result = partition.traverseRuleGraph(recordData)
  return result.ruleInformation, result.matchingRuleSets
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Communication Overhead:** Minimize communication between partitions by optimizing the partitioning strategy and using efficient communication protocols.
*   **Data Heterogeneity:** Address potential biases or inconsistencies in data across different partitions.
*   **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect data privacy and prevent malicious attacks.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Design the system to be resilient to node failures.
*   **Dynamic Scaling:** Enable the system to scale dynamically by adding or removing partitions as needed.
