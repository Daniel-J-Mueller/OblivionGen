## Dynamic Haptic Overlay for Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Extend the positional image manipulation to include localized haptic feedback, creating a more immersive AR experience. The system uses ultrasonic transducers to generate localized pressure sensations on the user's skin, synchronized with the manipulated image and 3D modeling.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Ultrasonic Transducer Array: A flexible array of small ultrasonic transducers integrated into a wearable band (wrist, forearm, or head-mounted). Minimum resolution: 100 transducers per 10cmÂ². Frequency range: 20kHz - 80kHz.
    *   Depth Sensor: A short-range depth sensor (ToF or structured light) to map the user's skin surface and calibrate transducer focus.
    *   Processing Unit: Embedded processor (e.g., Raspberry Pi class) for real-time signal processing and synchronization.
    *   Existing Components: Utilize the existing multi-camera system from the patent for positional tracking.
*   **Software:**
    *   Skin Mapping Module: A calibration routine that creates a 3D map of the user's skin surface where the haptic feedback will be applied.
    *   Haptic Rendering Engine: Based on the 3D model and positional tracking data, this module calculates the necessary ultrasonic signals to create the desired tactile sensations.
    *   Synchronization Protocol: A low-latency communication protocol to synchronize image manipulation with haptic feedback. Target latency: <10ms.
    *   Pressure Mapping Algorithm: Algorithm to translate visual depth and texture data into appropriate pressure levels.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Acquire User Position & Orientation (from existing patent cameras)
  userPosition = get_user_position();
  userOrientation = get_user_orientation();

  // 2. Capture/Render Image (from existing patent system)
  image = capture_or_render_image();

  // 3. Perform Image Manipulation (from existing patent system)
  manipulatedImage = manipulate_image(image, userPosition, userOrientation);

  // 4. Extract Depth/Texture Data from Manipulated Image
  depthMap = extract_depth_map(manipulatedImage);
  textureMap = extract_texture_map(manipulatedImage);

  // 5. Calculate Haptic Signals
  hapticSignals = calculate_haptic_signals(depthMap, textureMap);

  // 6. Send Signals to Ultrasonic Transducer Array
  transmit_signals(hapticSignals);

  // 7. Update Skin Map (periodically)
  update_skin_map();
}
```

*   **Haptic Signal Calculation Details:** The algorithm should consider:
    *   **Depth:**  Objects appearing closer should generate stronger pressure.
    *   **Texture:** Rough textures should create a rapid series of small pressure pulses.
    *   **Edges:** Sharp edges should produce a distinct pressure gradient.
    *   **Motion:**  Moving objects should generate a sweeping pressure sensation.

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Augmented Reality Gaming: Feel the impact of virtual objects.
    *   Remote Control of Robots: Receive tactile feedback from the robot's sensors.
    *   Medical Training: Simulate the feel of surgical instruments.
    *   Accessibility: Provide tactile information for visually impaired users.
