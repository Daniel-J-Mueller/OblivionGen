## Conduit Mapping & Predictive Expansion System

**Concept:** Integrate real-time conduit condition assessment with automated, localized expansion to proactively address obstructions during fiber optic cable installation. This moves beyond simply *pushing* through obstructions to *anticipating* and subtly reshaping the conduit ahead of the installation sleeve.

**System Components:**

1.  **Mapping Sleeve (Front Module):**  A slim, independent sleeve deployed *ahead* of the cable-jetting installation sleeve. Contains:
    *   **Micro-LiDAR & Acoustic Sensors:** Continuously scans the conduit inner diameter, detects dents, ovalization, corrosion, and debris.  Data transmitted wirelessly.
    *   **Miniature Hydraulic Actuators (6+ distributed around circumference):**  Precisely controlled, capable of localized, small-scale expansion.
    *   **Wireless Power & Data Transmitter:** Receives power and transmits sensor data to the control unit.

2.  **Control Unit:**
    *   **Real-time Data Processing:**  Analyzes sensor data to create a dynamic conduit profile.
    *   **Predictive Algorithm:**  Based on conduit profile, predicts potential obstructions and calculates required expansion forces.
    *   **Hydraulic Control System:**  Precisely controls the mini-hydraulic actuators in the Mapping Sleeve.
    *   **Communication Interface:**  Integrates with the cable-jetting installation system.

3.  **Modified Cable-Jetting Installation Sleeve:** 
    *   Integrates the Mapping Sleeve’s data stream into overall installation control.
    *   Adjusts cable tension and pushing force based on conduit conditions and Mapping Sleeve feedback.

**Operation:**

1.  **Deployment:** The Mapping Sleeve is launched into the conduit *ahead* of the cable-jetting installation sleeve.
2.  **Mapping:** The Mapping Sleeve’s sensors continuously scan the conduit’s interior, generating a detailed profile.
3.  **Prediction & Expansion:** The Control Unit processes the sensor data, predicts potential obstructions (e.g., dents, tight bends), and activates the appropriate hydraulic actuators in the Mapping Sleeve.  This *locally* expands the conduit *just ahead* of the installation sleeve, creating a slightly wider path.
4.  **Installation:** The cable-jetting installation sleeve follows, encountering minimal resistance due to the pre-emptive expansion. The system dynamically adjusts expansion based on real-time data.
5.  **Retrieval (Optional):** The Mapping Sleeve can be retrieved after installation, or left in place for future monitoring.

**Pseudocode (Control Unit):**

```
WHILE (installation_in_progress)
    READ sensor_data FROM Mapping_Sleeve
    conduit_profile = PROCESS(sensor_data)
    predicted_obstructions = ANALYZE(conduit_profile)

    FOR EACH obstruction IN predicted_obstructions
        expansion_force = CALCULATE_EXPANSION_FORCE(obstruction)
        ACTIVATE_HYDRAULIC_ACTUATORS(expansion_force, obstruction_location)

    ADJUST_INSTALLATION_SPEED(conduit_profile) //Optimize speed based on condition

END WHILE
```
