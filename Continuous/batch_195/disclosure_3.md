## Adaptive Metamaterial Resonator Array

**Concept:** Expand the phase-controlled antenna concept by integrating an array of individually tunable metamaterial resonators *within* the folded monopole structure itself. Instead of *switching* between discrete resonant frequencies with capacitors/inductors, we dynamically *shape* the resonant curve using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) controlled metamaterial elements.

**Specs:**

*   **Antenna Structure:** Folded monopole as described in the base patent. The critical difference is the *internal* structure.
*   **Metamaterial Resonator Array:** An array of split-ring resonators (SRRs) or similar metamaterial elements embedded within the folded monopole arms. These are not merely surface-mounted but integrated *into* the conductive material of the monopole.  Density: 10 SRRs per wavelength at the lowest operating frequency.
*   **MEMS Actuation:** Each SRR features a MEMS bridge or cantilever spanning the split in the ring.  Applying a voltage to the MEMS element alters the bridge's position, changing the SRRâ€™s resonant frequency.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller manages the voltage applied to each MEMS element.  This allows for precise, *individual* tuning of each SRR within the array. Resolution: 8-bit control over MEMS voltage (0-5V).
*   **Frequency Range:** 700 MHz - 6 GHz. Target: Seamless coverage across multiple bands (5G, WiFi, Bluetooth).
*   **Polarization:** Dual polarization supported through orthogonal arrangement of SRR pairs.
*   **Power Consumption:** < 50mW for full array operation.
*   **Material:** High-conductivity copper or silver for monopole and SRRs. MEMS: Silicon nitride. Substrate: Low-loss dielectric (Rogers 4350B).

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Initialize array of SRR objects (each with: ID, resonant_frequency, current_voltage)
SRR[] srr_array = initialize_srr_array();

// Function to calculate optimal voltage for each SRR based on desired frequency response
function calculate_voltage_profile(desired_frequency_response) {
  voltage_profile = {};
  // Utilize a genetic algorithm or gradient descent to find optimal voltage values
  // for each SRR to achieve the desired frequency response.
  // Constraints:  0V <= voltage <= 5V.  Total power consumption < 50mW.
  // Fitness function: Minimize difference between actual frequency response and desired response.

  // Algorithm:
  // 1. Generate initial population of voltage profiles (random values).
  // 2. Simulate frequency response for each profile.
  // 3. Calculate fitness for each profile.
  // 4. Select best profiles based on fitness.
  // 5. Crossover and mutate selected profiles to create new generation.
  // 6. Repeat steps 2-5 until convergence.
  return voltage_profile;
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
  // Determine desired frequency response based on application requirements.
  desired_response = get_desired_frequency_response();

  // Calculate optimal voltage profile.
  voltage_profile = calculate_voltage_profile(desired_response);

  // Apply voltages to MEMS elements.
  for (srr in srr_array) {
    apply_voltage(srr, voltage_profile[srr.ID]);
  }

  // Wait for next iteration.
  delay(10ms);
}
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond discrete frequency switching to *continuous* frequency shaping. By individually controlling hundreds of metamaterial resonators, we can achieve:

*   **Ultra-wideband operation:** Seamless coverage of multiple frequency bands.
*   **Dynamic beamforming:**  Shape the radiation pattern in real-time.
*   **Adaptive impedance matching:** Optimize performance in changing environments.
*   **Frequency agility:** Rapidly switch between frequencies and waveforms.
