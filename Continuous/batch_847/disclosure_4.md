## Dynamic Spatial Partition Merging & Splitting based on Predictive Load

**Concept:** Extend the spatial partitioning scheme to be *dynamic* and *predictive*. Instead of fixed subdivisions or reactive adjustments, proactively merge or split partitions based on *predicted* computational load within those partitions, anticipating data object movement and processing demand.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Load Engine:**

*   **Data Input:** Real-time data stream of data object positions, velocities, and assigned processing tasks. Historical load data per spatial partition. Application-specific processing cost profiles (e.g., ray tracing, physics simulation).
*   **Model:** Implement a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) to predict computational load for each spatial partition over a short time horizon (e.g., 1-5 seconds).  Factors to include:
    *   Object density within the partition.
    *   Velocity of objects – rapidly moving objects imply a future load shift.
    *   Processing task complexity assigned to objects in the partition.
    *   Historical load patterns for that partition at similar times.
*   **Output:**  Predicted load curve for each partition, indicating expected CPU/GPU utilization.

**2. Dynamic Partition Manager:**

*   **Thresholds:** Configure thresholds for 'high' and 'low' predicted load.
*   **Partition Splitting:**  If a partition’s predicted load exceeds the ‘high’ threshold:
    *   Identify the partition’s centroid.
    *   Determine the longest axis of variance within the partition.
    *   Split the partition along this axis, creating two (or more) sub-partitions.  Sub-partition size should be dynamically adjusted based on the magnitude of load variance.
    *   Re-assign data objects to the newly created sub-partitions.
*   **Partition Merging:** If a partition’s predicted load falls below the ‘low’ threshold *and* its neighboring partitions also have low loads:
    *   Merge the partition with its lowest-load neighbor.
    *   Re-assign data objects to the merged partition.
*   **Constraint:** Prevent excessive splitting/merging (e.g., limit to one split/merge operation per partition per time step).
*    **Hierarchical Management**: Introduce a tree like structure where merging/splitting decisions cascade up and down the hierarchy. Small partitions will only respond to local load, larger ones will respond to aggregate load.

**3.  Load Balancing Integration:**

*   The Dynamic Partition Manager communicates predicted load and partition configurations to the load balancing system.
*   The load balancing system prioritizes task assignment to partitions with the lowest predicted load *while considering data locality*.
*   The load balancing system dynamically adjusts resource allocation (CPU/GPU cores) to partitions based on predicted and actual load.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Partition Splitting):**

```
function splitPartition(partition, predictedLoad) {
  if (predictedLoad > HIGH_LOAD_THRESHOLD) {
    centroid = calculateCentroid(partition);
    longestAxis = findLongestAxisOfVariance(partition);
    splitPlane = createPlane(centroid, longestAxis);

    partition1 = new Partition();
    partition2 = new Partition();

    for (object in partition.objects) {
      if (object.position.distanceTo(splitPlane) < 0) {
        partition1.addObject(object);
      } else {
        partition2.addObject(object);
      }
    }

    return [partition1, partition2];
  }
}

```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires sufficient processing power to run the Predictive Load Engine and Dynamic Partition Manager without introducing significant overhead.
*   Fast communication channels between the Predictive Load Engine, Dynamic Partition Manager, and Load Balancing System.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved performance by proactively distributing workload.
*   Reduced latency by minimizing contention.
*   Enhanced scalability by adapting to changing data and processing demands.
*   Optimal resource utilization.
