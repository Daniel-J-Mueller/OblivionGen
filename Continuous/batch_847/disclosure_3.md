## Adaptive Resonance Scanner – Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** A scanner device that adapts its scanning parameters based on real-time biofeedback from the user, optimizing data acquisition for specific physiological states. The device isn't just *reading* data, it’s *responding* to the subject’s internal state to improve the scan.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate sensors beyond standard optical/laser scanners. Include:
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor - measures skin conductivity changes related to emotional arousal.
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor - measures heart rate variability (HRV) via skin illumination.
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) – Basic single-lead EEG for rudimentary brainwave monitoring (alpha/theta/beta).
*   **Scanning Parameter Control:** The scanner’s speed, resolution, depth of field, and even spectral analysis range will be dynamically adjusted based on the processed biofeedback data.
*   **Biofeedback Algorithm:**
    *   **Input:** Raw sensor data (GSR, PPG, EEG).
    *   **Processing:**
        *   Noise filtering (standard signal processing techniques).
        *   Feature extraction:  Calculate metrics like HRV, GSR peak frequency, and dominant EEG frequency bands.
        *   State Classification:  Map extracted features to predefined states (e.g., “Relaxed,” “Focused,” “Anxious,” "Fatigued”).  Machine learning (simple clustering or classification) would be necessary here.
    *   **Output:** Recommended scanning parameters (speed, resolution, spectral range).
*   **Scanner Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller to process biofeedback data and control scanner hardware.
    *   Real-time operating system (RTOS) for predictable timing.
    *   Communication interface to scanner components (e.g., stepper motor control, laser/LED driver).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Display showing current biofeedback state.
    *   Option for user to manually override automated parameter adjustments.
*   **Data Logging:** Record both scan data *and* biofeedback data for post-processing analysis and algorithm refinement.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable battery or AC adapter.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
loop:
    read GSR, PPG, EEG sensors
    filter sensor data
    extract features (HRV, GSR peak frequency, EEG frequency bands)
    classify biofeedback state (Relaxed, Focused, Anxious, Fatigued)

    if state == Relaxed:
        scanner_speed = slow
        scanner_resolution = high
        scanner_spectral_range = wide
    else if state == Focused:
        scanner_speed = medium
        scanner_resolution = medium
        scanner_spectral_range = narrow (focus on key frequencies)
    else if state == Anxious:
        scanner_speed = fast
        scanner_resolution = low
        scanner_spectral_range = wide (capture broad spectrum, less detail)
    else if state == Fatigued:
        scanner_speed = slow
        scanner_resolution = low
        scanner_spectral_range = narrow (focus on essential data)
    else: # Default settings
        scanner_speed = medium
        scanner_resolution = medium
        scanner_spectral_range = medium

    set scanner parameters (speed, resolution, spectral range)
    acquire scan data
    log scan data and biofeedback data
    repeat
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Medical diagnostics (optimize scans based on patient anxiety levels).
*   Security (adjust scans based on subject alertness).
*   Art/Design (capture nuanced data based on user emotional state).
*   Research (study the relationship between physiological state and scan data).
