## Adaptive Void Fill with Micro-Actuators

**Concept:** Expand upon the adjustable void concept by integrating micro-actuator technology within the packaging insert flaps. This allows *dynamic* adjustment of the void size *after* the item is placed within, improving protection and minimizing movement during shipping.

**Specs:**

*   **Flap Material:** Bio-polymer composite with embedded piezoelectric micro-actuators.  Actuators are arranged in a grid pattern within each flap. Density: 1 actuator per 5cmÂ².
*   **Actuator Control:** Wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy) to a smartphone app or dedicated control unit.  App provides user interface for adjusting void size.
*   **Power Source:**  Thin-film, flexible battery integrated into the packaging insert base or outer layer. Rechargeable via inductive charging.  Battery capacity sufficient for at least 10 adjustments.
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) embedded within the packaging insert. IMU detects impacts and vibrations during shipping.
*   **Control Logic:**
    *   **Manual Adjustment:** User initiates adjustment via app. Actuators extend or retract to alter void size.
    *   **Automated Adjustment:** IMU data triggers actuator adjustments.  For example:
        *   Sharp impact -> Actuators retract to tighten void around item.
        *   Prolonged vibration -> Actuators slightly extend to provide cushioning.
*   **Flap Design:** Flaps have a multi-layered construction:
    *   Outer layer: Durable, protective material.
    *   Middle layer: Micro-actuator grid and wiring.
    *   Inner layer: Soft, cushioning material that contacts the item.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Secure, encrypted communication between the control unit/app and the packaging insert.
* **Void size adjustment range:** Maximum void size change: +/- 2cm in each dimension.
* **Software Considerations:**
    *   Calibration routine to map actuator positions to void size changes.
    *   Diagnostic tools to identify malfunctioning actuators.
    *   User profiles to store preferred void settings for different items.
*   **Prototype material:** ABS plastic for initial testing, transitioning to bio-polymer composite for production.



**Pseudocode (Actuator Control):**

```
// Main Loop
while (shipping_in_progress) {

  // Read IMU data
  impact_detected = check_impact(IMU_data);
  vibration_level = measure_vibration(IMU_data);

  if (impact_detected) {
    retract_all_actuators(retraction_amount);
  }

  if (vibration_level > threshold) {
    extend_all_actuators(extension_amount);
  }

  // Check for user input via app
  if (app_request_received) {
    void_size_change = app_request_data;
    adjust_actuators(void_size_change);
  }

  delay(100ms);
}
```
