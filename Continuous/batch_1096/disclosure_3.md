## Smart Doorbell Ecosystem - "Guardian"

**Core Concept:** Expand the doorbell beyond simple notification. Create a localized, AI-driven security and convenience ecosystem centered around the doorbell as the primary sensor and control hub.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Doorbell Unit:** (Existing form factor enhanced) - HD camera with low-light capability, microphone, speaker, tamper detection, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Zigbee connectivity. Integrated, small-form factor environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality).
*   **"Guardian Nodes":** Small, wireless sensor units deployed around the property. Each node contains:
    *   Motion sensor (short and long range)
    *   Acoustic sensor (detects specific sounds - glass breaking, voices, dog barking)
    *   Low-power radar (for perimeter detection, even through foliage)
    *   Optional: Small RGB LED for visual feedback/alerts
    *   Power: Rechargeable battery with solar charging capability.
*   **"Guardian Hub":** A localized processing unit (optional, cloud-offload possible but less responsive). Processes sensor data, runs AI models, manages the network.
*   **Smart Lock Integration:** Compatible with most smart lock brands.

**Software/AI Components:**

*   **AI-Powered Event Classification:** Advanced algorithms analyze video and sensor data to classify events accurately (person, package, vehicle, animal, suspicious activity).
*   **Behavioral Learning:** The system learns the homeowner's routine and identifies anomalies.
*   **Geofencing & Contextual Awareness:** Integrates with homeowner's smartphone location to provide automated actions (e.g., automatically disarm security when homeowner arrives).
*   **Voice Control & Integration:** Compatible with popular voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant).
*   **"Guardian Shield" Mode:** Automatically activates a heightened security state based on pre-defined rules or detected threats.

**Pseudocode - Guardian Shield Activation**

```
// Define parameters
INT suspiciousActivityThreshold = 75; // Percent
INT perimeterBreachDistance = 10; // Meters
BOOLEAN homeownerAway = FALSE;

// Main loop
WHILE (TRUE) {
    // Collect data from sensors
    FLOAT activityScore = getSuspiciousActivityScore();
    FLOAT perimeterDistance = getClosestPerimeterBreach();
    BOOLEAN isHomeownerPresent = checkHomeownerPresence();

    // Check conditions
    IF (activityScore > suspiciousActivityThreshold AND isHomeownerPresent == FALSE) {
        // Activate Guardian Shield
        logEvent("Guardian Shield Activated - High Activity");
        triggerAlert("Suspicious activity detected!");
        activateCameraRecording();
        sendNotification("Suspicious activity detected!");
        // Optional: Engage smart lock to lock doors
    }
    IF (perimeterDistance < perimeterBreachDistance AND isHomeownerPresent == FALSE) {
        logEvent("Guardian Shield Activated - Perimeter Breach");
        triggerAlert("Perimeter breach detected!");
        activateCameraRecording();
        sendNotification("Perimeter breach detected!");
        // Optional: Engage smart lock to lock doors
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond a simple doorbell notification system. It creates a proactive, AI-driven security ecosystem that adapts to the homeownerâ€™s lifestyle and provides a layered defense against potential threats. The localized processing capability enhances responsiveness and privacy. The Guardian Nodes provide wider coverage and detection capabilities than a single doorbell.
