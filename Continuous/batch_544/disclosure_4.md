## Dynamic Virtual Network 'Slicing' Based on Predictive Resource Demand

**Specification:** A system for proactively adjusting virtual network resource allocation (bandwidth, latency priority, compute) *before* congestion occurs, based on machine learning prediction of future demand.  This differs from reactive QoS adjustments.

**Core Concept:** Rather than simply responding to network load, the system anticipates it. Each virtual network operates as a ‘slice’ with dedicated (but dynamically adjustable) resources.  A central prediction engine forecasts resource needs *per slice*.

**Components:**

1.  **Demand Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Time Series Forecasting) trained on historical network traffic data *per virtual network slice*.  Features include:
    *   Time of day/week/year
    *   Application type (identified via deep packet inspection or API call analysis)
    *   User behavior patterns (aggregated & anonymized)
    *   External event data (e.g., news feeds indicating potential surges in demand – sporting events, product launches)
2.  **Resource Allocation Manager:**  Responsible for dynamically adjusting the resources allocated to each virtual network slice.  It receives predicted demand from the Demand Prediction Engine and translates that into concrete resource allocations.
3.  **Substrate Network Abstraction Layer:**  Provides a unified interface to the underlying substrate network (physical servers, switches, etc.).  Allows the Resource Allocation Manager to programmatically control resource allocation without being tied to a specific vendor or technology.
4.  **Virtual Network Slice Profiles:** Define the initial and maximum resource allocations for each virtual network slice.  This allows for differentiation between different service levels.

**Operation:**

1.  The Demand Prediction Engine continuously monitors network traffic and updates its prediction models.
2.  Based on the predictions, the Resource Allocation Manager proactively adjusts the resource allocations for each virtual network slice.  
    *   *Increase* resources for slices predicted to experience high demand.
    *   *Decrease* resources for slices predicted to have low demand (reallocating those resources to other slices).
3.  The Substrate Network Abstraction Layer programs the underlying substrate network to reflect the new resource allocations.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Manager):**

```
function allocateResources() {
  for each slice in virtualNetworkSlices {
    predictedDemand = demandPredictionEngine.getPredictedDemand(slice);
    currentAllocation = slice.getCurrentAllocation();
    targetAllocation = calculateTargetAllocation(predictedDemand, slice.profile);

    if (targetAllocation > currentAllocation) {
      allocateAdditionalResources(slice, targetAllocation - currentAllocation);
    } else if (targetAllocation < currentAllocation) {
      reclaimResources(slice, currentAllocation - targetAllocation);
    }
  }
}

function calculateTargetAllocation(predictedDemand, profile) {
  // Algorithm to determine target allocation based on predicted demand and slice profile
  // Could use a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller or a simple lookup table
  // Example: targetAllocation = baseAllocation + (predictedDemand * scalingFactor)
  return targetAllocation;
}

function allocateAdditionalResources(slice, amount) {
  // Code to allocate additional resources to the slice
  // May involve provisioning new virtual machines, increasing bandwidth limits, etc.
}

function reclaimResources(slice, amount) {
  // Code to reclaim resources from the slice
  // May involve deprovisioning virtual machines, reducing bandwidth limits, etc.
}
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems primarily focus on *reactive* QoS adjustments. This design emphasizes *proactive* resource allocation based on predicted demand, maximizing network efficiency and improving user experience. The specific combination of machine learning-driven prediction and dynamic resource slicing creates a highly adaptable and efficient virtual networking solution.  This also allows for 'overbooking' with greater reliability.
