## Dynamic Tag Morphing & Contextual Action Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the active tag system to allow tags to *morph* their associated actions based on real-time contextual data gathered from the user’s environment and activity. Instead of a fixed action, the tag’s behavior becomes a dynamic profile triggered by specific conditions.

**Specs:**

*   **Contextual Data Sources:**
    *   Geolocation (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation)
    *   Device Sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone – with user permission)
    *   Calendar Integration (upcoming meetings, scheduled events)
    *   Network Activity (active applications, visited websites – with user permission)
    *   Time of Day/Day of Week
    *   User Activity Recognition (e.g., walking, driving, in a meeting – inferred from sensor data)
*   **Action Profile Editor:**
    *   A visual editor allowing users to define action profiles.
    *   Profile elements: `IF [Contextual Condition] THEN [Action]`
    *   Conditions: Comparisons and combinations of contextual data (e.g., `IF Location = "Home" AND Time = "Evening" THEN Action = "Dim Lights"`)
    *   Actions:  Any action supported by the existing system (search, URL launch, macro execution, question display), plus new capabilities (e.g., IOT device control, push notifications with dynamic content).
*   **Tag Linking to Profiles:** 
    *   Tags are linked to one or more action profiles.
    *   Priority system for profile selection when multiple profiles apply.
*   **Profile Marketplace & Sharing:**
    *   Users can share action profiles with the community.
    *   Rating and review system for profiles.
    *   Profile import/export functionality.
*   **Intelligent Profile Suggestion:**
    *   System suggests relevant action profiles based on user’s context and tag usage.

**Pseudocode (Profile Evaluation):**

```
FUNCTION EvaluateProfile(tag, contextData, profileList)
  FOR EACH profile IN profileList
    IF ProfileMatchesContext(profile, contextData) THEN
      RETURN profile.action
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  // If no profile matches, return the default action for the tag.
  RETURN tag.defaultAction
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION ProfileMatchesContext(profile, contextData)
  FOR EACH condition IN profile.conditions
    IF NOT ConditionEvaluatesTrue(condition, contextData) THEN
      RETURN FALSE
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  RETURN TRUE
ENDFUNCTION

// ConditionEvaluatesTrue() would implement logic to evaluate 
// specific conditions (e.g., location equals, time is between)
```

**Example Use Case:**

A user creates a tag for "Grocery List." 

*   Default Action: Opens a note-taking app.
*   Action Profile 1: `IF Location = "Grocery Store" THEN Display Grocery List in App`
*   Action Profile 2: `IF Time = "Evening" AND Location = "Home" THEN Add Items to Grocery List via Voice Input`

The tag’s behavior dynamically adapts based on the user’s context, offering a seamless and intelligent experience.
