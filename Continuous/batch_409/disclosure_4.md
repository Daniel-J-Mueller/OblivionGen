## Dynamic Peripheral Display Integration

**Concept:** Leverage the presented technology – specifically, the user identification and selective content presentation – to extend the display experience *beyond* the primary screen, utilizing readily available peripheral surfaces within the user’s environment.

**Specs:**

**Hardware:**

*   **Projector Module:** Miniature, low-power projector integrated into the computing device (phone, tablet, glasses, etc.).  Ideally, a MEMS-based projection system for size and stability.  Resolution: 720p minimum, targeting 1080p.  Brightness: Adjustable, targeting 50-150 lumens.
*   **Ambient Light Sensor Array:**  Multiple sensors to accurately map ambient light conditions on nearby surfaces. Integrated with the camera system.
*   **Depth Sensor:**  Short-range depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or structured light) for surface mapping and accurate projection alignment. Integrated with the camera system.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated co-processor for real-time surface analysis, projection warping, and content rendering.

**Software:**

*   **Surface Mapping Algorithm:**  Analyzes depth and ambient light data to identify suitable projection surfaces within a defined radius (e.g., walls, desks, hands, even clothing). Algorithm prioritizes flat or gently curved surfaces.
*   **Content Warping Engine:**  Dynamically adjusts projected content to compensate for surface irregularities and viewing angles. Uses a mesh-based warping system.
*   **Contextual Content Selection:**
    *   Extends the existing “selective content presentation” system.
    *   Determines what content to project based on:
        *   User identity.
        *   Detected activity (e.g., reading, writing, video call).
        *   Current application.
        *   User gaze direction (leveraging the existing gaze detection).
    *   Content examples:
        *   During a video call: Project supplementary materials (documents, presentations) onto a nearby wall.
        *   While reading: Project a glossary or definitions onto the desk.
        *   While writing: Project a reference document or outline onto the wall.
        *   During navigation: Project a simplified route map onto the dashboard of a car.
*   **Gesture Control Integration:** Allows users to interact with the projected content using hand gestures. Utilizes the device’s camera for gesture recognition.
*   **Dynamic Brightness Adjustment:** Automatically adjusts the projector’s brightness based on ambient light conditions and surface reflectivity.
*   **Power Management:** Optimizes projector usage to minimize battery drain.  Includes a “sleep” mode when the projector is not actively in use.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Capture Camera & Sensor Data
  imageData = captureCameraData();
  ambientLightData = captureAmbientLightData();
  depthData = captureDepthData();

  // 2. Surface Mapping
  surfaces = mapSurfaces(depthData, ambientLightData);

  // 3. Content Selection
  userIdentity = identifyUser(imageData);
  activity = detectUserActivity();
  relevantContent = selectRelevantContent(userIdentity, activity);

  // 4. Projection Rendering
  for each surface in surfaces {
    warpedContent = warpContent(relevantContent, surface);
    project(warpedContent, surface);
  }

  // 5. Gesture Recognition & Interaction (optional)
  gestures = recognizeGestures(imageData);
  handleGestures(gestures);

  delay(frameRate);
}
```

**Novelty:** Extends the existing technology by adding an entirely new dimension to content display – environmental projection. This goes beyond simply displaying content *on* a screen to *augmenting the user’s environment with* relevant information. The integration with user identification and activity recognition allows for a truly personalized and dynamic experience.
