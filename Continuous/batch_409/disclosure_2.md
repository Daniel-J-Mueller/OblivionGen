## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Filtering

**Concept:** Extend action-based content filtering to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of both primary content *and* user reactions, dynamically adjusting supplemental content to maximize engagement or provide supportive interventions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Primary Content Emotional Analysis:** Employ computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze video & audio streams of primary content. Extract emotional cues – valence (positive/negative), arousal (intensity), and dominant emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise). Output: Emotional Signature Vector (ESV) – a time-series representation of emotional content.
*   **User Reaction Monitoring:**
    *   **Facial Expression Analysis:** Utilize camera input (integrated with the client device) to analyze facial expressions.  Identify emotional states mirroring those in the primary content or diverging from them (e.g., user appears frustrated while content is upbeat).
    *   **Physiological Data Integration (Optional):** If available (e.g., via wearable devices), integrate heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance, and other physiological signals to enhance emotional state detection accuracy.
    *   **Voice Analysis:** Analyze user vocalizations (if any) for tone, pitch, and emotional content.
    *   **Gaze Tracking:** Integrate gaze position data, but analyze dwell *time* and *pattern* beyond simply identifying objects. Brief, rapid glances suggest disinterest or confusion, while prolonged focus suggests engagement or emotional resonance.
*   **Emotional State Vector (ESV) Creation:** Combine data from all sources (facial expressions, physiology, voice, gaze) to construct a user-specific ESV representing their current emotional state.

**2.  Dynamic Filtering Algorithm:**

*   **Resonance Calculation:**  Compare the ESV of the primary content with the user's ESV in real-time. Calculate a “Resonance Score” – a measure of emotional alignment.
*   **Filtering Rules Engine:** Define a set of configurable rules that govern supplemental content selection based on the Resonance Score:
    *   **High Resonance (Positive Alignment):** Amplify engagement. Display related content (e.g., user-generated content, merchandise, social media feeds).  Increase the pace of supplemental content delivery.
    *   **Low Resonance (Negative Alignment):**  Provide supportive or clarifying content.  Display FAQs, tutorials, or alternative viewpoints.  Reduce the pace of supplemental content delivery.  Offer access to emotional support resources (if user opts in).
    *   **Neutral Resonance:** Maintain current content flow or introduce exploratory content.
    *   **Emotional Dissonance Detection:**  If the user exhibits strong negative emotions *in response* to seemingly positive content (or vice versa), trigger a “Safety Net” – display calming visuals, offer to pause the content, or connect the user to support resources.
*   **Content Prioritization & Selection:** Utilize the filtering rules to prioritize and select supplemental content from a pre-defined database.  Apply Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to ensure content relevance to both the primary content and the user's emotional state.

**3.  System Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side Processing:**  Facial expression analysis, voice analysis, gaze tracking, preliminary ESV creation, and initial filtering logic.
*   **Server-Side Processing:**  Primary content emotional analysis, advanced ESV processing, filtering rules engine, content database management, and user profile management.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Real-time communication between client and server via WebSocket or similar protocol.

**Pseudocode (Filtering Logic - Simplified):**

```
function apply_filtering(primary_esv, user_esv, content_database, user_profile):
  resonance_score = calculate_resonance(primary_esv, user_esv)

  if resonance_score > 0.7:
    filtering_level = "amplify"
  elif resonance_score < 0.3:
    filtering_level = "support"
  else:
    filtering_level = "neutral"

  filtered_content = select_content(content_database, filtering_level, user_profile)

  return filtered_content
```

**Novelty:**  This system goes beyond simply filtering content *based on objects* to dynamically adapting content based on the *emotional resonance* between the user and the content. It anticipates and responds to user emotions in real-time, creating a more engaging and supportive experience.
