## Temporal Feature Propagation with Adaptive Block Merging

**Concept:** Extend the temporal filtering concept by not just smoothing blocks *within* a temporal window, but by *merging* similar blocks across multiple temporal windows, creating ‘super-blocks’ representing aggregated temporal features. This aims to improve long-term consistency and reduce temporal artifacts, especially in scenes with slow motion or subtle changes.

**Specs:**

**1. Block Similarity Metric:**

   *   **Feature Extraction:** Each block is processed through a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract a feature vector (e.g., 64-dimensional). This CNN is trained offline to maximize the distinction between different motion patterns and textures.
   *   **Cosine Similarity:** Calculate the cosine similarity between the feature vectors of blocks in the current frame and blocks in neighboring temporal windows (configurable window size, e.g., 3 frames before and 3 frames after).
   *   **Motion Vector Correlation:**  If motion estimation data is available (from existing video compression standards), correlate the motion vectors of candidate blocks.  High correlation strengthens the similarity score.
   *   **Combined Score:**  Similarity = (Cosine Similarity Weight * Cosine Similarity) + (Motion Vector Weight * Motion Vector Correlation). Weights are adjustable parameters.

**2. Adaptive Block Merging:**

   *   **Thresholding:** A similarity threshold (adjustable) determines whether blocks from different frames should be merged.
   *   **Merging Algorithm:** If blocks exceed the threshold:
        *   **Pixel Averaging:** Average the pixel values of the merged blocks.
        *   **Weighted Averaging:**  Use the similarity score as a weighting factor in the pixel averaging. Higher similarity = higher weight.
        *   **Gradient Blending:** Blend gradients (edge information) of the merged blocks to minimize visual seams.
   *   **Super-Block Creation:**  The merged blocks form a “super-block” that is larger than the original blocks. The size of the super-block is determined by the number of merged blocks.

**3. Temporal Consistency Enforcement:**

   *   **Super-Block Tracking:** Track super-blocks across consecutive frames. This ensures that the same regions of the video are consistently processed.
   *   **Motion Compensation Adaptation:** Adapt motion compensation algorithms to work with super-blocks. This may involve resizing motion vectors or adjusting search ranges.
   *   **Artifact Reduction:** Implement post-processing filters to reduce any artifacts caused by the block merging process (e.g., smoothing filters, edge enhancement).

**4. System Architecture:**

   *   **Parallel Processing:** Implement the algorithm using parallel processing techniques (e.g., GPU acceleration) to achieve real-time performance.
   *   **Configurable Parameters:** Provide a user interface to configure the following parameters:
        *   Temporal window size
        *   Similarity threshold
        *   Weights for cosine similarity and motion vector correlation
        *   Smoothing filter parameters
   *   **Integration with Video Codecs:** Design the algorithm to be compatible with existing video codecs (e.g., H.264, H.265).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
For each block in current frame:
    best_match = None
    highest_similarity = -1

    For each frame in temporal window:
        For each block in frame:
            similarity = calculate_block_similarity(current_block, block_in_frame)
            If similarity > highest_similarity:
                highest_similarity = similarity
                best_match = block_in_frame

    If highest_similarity > similarity_threshold:
        merged_block = merge_blocks(current_block, best_match)
        Encode and use merged_block instead of current_block

    Else:
        Encode current_block
```
