## Dynamic Resource Prioritization based on Predicted Gaze

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**

Extend the existing resource optimization system by incorporating predicted gaze tracking to proactively prioritize resources within the currently (and *imminently*) visible portion of the display. Instead of *reacting* to what's visible, the system *anticipates* and prepares.

**II. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   **Gaze Tracker Integration:**  Support for integrating with common gaze tracking hardware (e.g., Tobii, Pupil Labs) or software-based gaze estimation utilizing camera input.  The system *must* support fallback to standard visible area detection if gaze tracking is unavailable.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Implement a prediction algorithm (Kalman filter, Recurrent Neural Network) to estimate the user's gaze point 100-300ms into the future.  The algorithm must be trainable with user-specific data to improve accuracy.
*   **Resource Dependency Graph:**  Maintain a dependency graph for all resources (images, scripts, CSS, etc.). This graph will define which resources are required to render specific UI elements or content areas.  Updates to the graph must be automatic and reflected in real-time.
*   **Priority Queue:** Implement a priority queue for resource loading and rendering.  Resource priority will be determined by: 1) Predicted gaze proximity, 2) Dependency graph weight, 3) Current rendering state.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** Integrate the priority queue into the rendering pipeline. This may require modifications to the browser's rendering engine or the use of a custom rendering framework.
*   **Performance Monitoring:**  Track the impact of gaze-based prioritization on performance metrics (frame rate, load time, perceived latency).

**III. Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
gazeTracker = initializeGazeTracker()
resourceGraph = buildResourceGraph()
priorityQueue = initializePriorityQueue()

// Main Loop
while (applicationRunning) {
    gazePoint = gazeTracker.getGazePoint()  //Returns (x,y) coordinates
    predictedGazePoint = predictGazePoint(gazePoint) //Using prediction algorithm

    visibleArea = getVisibleArea()
    potentiallyVisibleArea = expandVisibleArea(visibleArea, predictionHorizon) //Increase visibility a bit

    //Prioritize resources
    for each resource in resourceGraph {
        if (resource.isInArea(potentiallyVisibleArea)) {
            priority = calculatePriority(resource, predictedGazePoint, resourceGraph)
            priorityQueue.enqueue(resource, priority)
        }
    }

    //Render resources based on priority
    while (priorityQueue.isNotEmpty()) {
        resource = priorityQueue.dequeue()
        renderResource(resource)
    }
}

//Calculate Priority Function
function calculatePriority(resource, gazePoint, graph) {
    distance = distanceBetween(gazePoint, resource.center)
    dependencyWeight = graph.getWeight(resource)
    priority = (1 / distance) * dependencyWeight //Adjust weighting factors as needed.
    return priority
}
```

**IV. Extended Functionality:**

*   **Foveated Rendering:**  Dynamically adjust the quality of rendering based on gaze proximity. High-resolution rendering for the fovea (area of sharpest vision), lower resolution for the periphery.
*   **Pre-fetching:** Pre-fetch resources predicted to be needed in the near future based on gaze prediction and user navigation patterns.
*   **Adaptive Prediction:**  Adjust the prediction algorithm's parameters based on user behavior. For example, if the user frequently switches focus quickly, increase the responsiveness of the prediction algorithm.
*   **User Profiles:** Store user-specific gaze patterns and preferences to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Content-Aware Optimization:** Leverage semantic understanding of content to prioritize resources. For example, prioritize the loading of images or videos that are likely to be viewed first.
