## Adaptive Prefetching based on Predictive Access Patterns

**Specification:** Implement a predictive prefetching system layered on top of the existing object caching mechanism. This system analyzes access patterns *across multiple* storage gateway instances to anticipate future object requests.

**Components:**

*   **Global Access Pattern Database:** A distributed database storing aggregated access patterns from all connected storage gateways. Data includes object IDs, timestamps, requesting compute instance IDs, and associated metadata (e.g., application type, user ID).
*   **Pattern Analysis Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, transformer) trained on the Global Access Pattern Database. This engine identifies common access sequences, temporal trends, and correlations between objects.
*   **Local Prediction Module:** A component within each storage gateway instance that receives predicted object IDs from the Pattern Analysis Engine.
*   **Prefetch Queue:** A queue within each storage gateway instance to hold prefetched object IDs.
*   **Prefetcher:** A background process that fetches objects from the object store based on the Prefetch Queue.

**Operation:**

1.  **Data Collection:** Each storage gateway instance logs object access events (object ID, timestamp, requesting compute instance) and sends this data to the Global Access Pattern Database.
2.  **Pattern Analysis:** The Pattern Analysis Engine periodically analyzes the data in the Global Access Pattern Database to identify frequently occurring access patterns.
3.  **Prediction Generation:** Based on the identified patterns, the Pattern Analysis Engine generates predictions for future object requests. Predictions include object IDs and associated compute instance IDs.
4.  **Prediction Distribution:** Predictions are distributed to the relevant storage gateway instances based on the requesting compute instance ID.
5.  **Prefetching:** The Local Prediction Module receives predictions and adds the corresponding object IDs to the Prefetch Queue. The Prefetcher fetches these objects from the object store and stores them in the cache.
6.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns and adapts to changing access patterns. The machine learning model is retrained periodically with new data.

**Pseudocode (Local Prediction Module):**

```
function receivePrediction(objectID, computeInstanceID):
  if objectID not in cache:
    addToPrefetchQueue(objectID)
  end if
end function

function addToPrefetchQueue(objectID):
  if objectID not in prefetchQueue:
    prefetchQueue.append(objectID)
  end if
end function

background process Prefetcher:
  while True:
    if prefetchQueue is not empty:
      objectID = prefetchQueue.pop(0)
      object = fetchObjectFromObjectStore(objectID)
      storeObjectInCache(object)
    end if
    sleep(1 second)
end process
```

**Cache Considerations:**

*   **Priority:** Prefetched objects may be assigned a lower priority in the cache to avoid evicting frequently accessed objects.
*   **Time-to-Live (TTL):** Prefetched objects may have a shorter TTL than objects accessed directly by users.
*   **Stale Object Handling:** Mechanisms should be implemented to handle stale prefetched objects.

**Scalability:**

*   The Global Access Pattern Database should be horizontally scalable.
*   The Pattern Analysis Engine should be able to handle a large volume of data.
*   The prediction distribution mechanism should be efficient.
