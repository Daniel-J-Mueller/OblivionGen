## Dynamic Projection Mapping with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend projection correction beyond geometric distortion to dynamically alter projected content *based on real-time biofeedback* from the user. This moves beyond simple calibration to create an immersive, responsive projection experience tailored to the user’s physiological and emotional state.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) headset: Measures brainwave activity (alpha, beta, theta, gamma bands) to gauge cognitive load, focus, and emotional state.
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor (wrist-worn or ear-clip): Measures heart rate variability (HRV) as an indicator of stress, relaxation, and engagement.
    *   Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor: Measures skin conductance as an indicator of arousal and emotional response.
*   **Processing Unit:**
    *   Embedded system (e.g., Raspberry Pi or similar) capable of real-time data acquisition and analysis from biofeedback sensors.
    *   Machine learning algorithms (trained on datasets correlating biofeedback metrics with desired projection parameters) for translating sensor data into actionable projection adjustments.
*   **Projection System:**
    *   High-resolution projector with keystone correction and color calibration capabilities.
    *   Computer interface to receive adjustment commands from the processing unit.
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   Sensor data acquisition and pre-processing libraries (e.g., OpenBCI, BioZensor).
    *   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for training and deploying biofeedback-driven projection control models.
    *   Communication protocol for transmitting adjustment commands to the projector.

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
Connect to Biofeedback Sensors
Connect to Projector
Load Pre-trained Biofeedback-Projection Model

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {
    // Acquire Biofeedback Data
    EEG_Data = Read EEG Sensor
    HRV_Data = Read HRV Sensor
    EDA_Data = Read EDA Sensor

    // Preprocess Data (Noise filtering, Feature extraction)
    Processed_Biofeedback_Data = Preprocess(EEG_Data, HRV_Data, EDA_Data)

    // Predict Projection Adjustments
    Adjustment_Parameters = Predict(Processed_Biofeedback_Data, Biofeedback_Model)
    // Adjustment_Parameters include:
    //    - Color Temperature (warm/cool)
    //    - Brightness
    //    - Contrast
    //    - Saturation
    //    - Content Filters (e.g., calming imagery, increased activity)
    //    - Geometric Transformations (subtle shifts to reinforce perspective)

    // Apply Adjustments to Projection
    Adjust_Projection(Adjustment_Parameters)

    // Update Display (optional) - show real-time biofeedback data overlaid on projection
}
```

**Example Scenarios:**

*   **Relaxation/Meditation:** High alpha wave activity triggers warmer color temperatures, lower brightness, and calming visual content (e.g., nature scenes).
*   **Focus/Concentration:** High beta wave activity triggers cooler color temperatures, increased brightness, and sharper visual content to enhance focus.
*   **Emotional Regulation:** Elevated EDA levels trigger changes in color and brightness designed to soothe or uplift the user based on pre-defined profiles.
*   **Gamification:**  User’s physiological responses directly influence gameplay elements projected onto the environment, creating a fully immersive and adaptive experience.

**Novelty:**

This concept moves beyond *correcting* distortions to actively *manipulating* the projected experience in real-time based on the user’s internal state. It’s a shift from static calibration to dynamic adaptation, creating a truly personalized and responsive immersive environment. This isn't about making the image ‘correct,’ it’s about making it *felt*.
