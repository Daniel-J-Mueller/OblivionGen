## Dynamic Watermarking with Perceptual Hashing and Temporal Drift

**Concept:** Extend the fingerprinting concept to video content, embedding a dynamic watermark that shifts subtly over time, resistant to common video editing and compression techniques. This builds on the idea of modifying content based on random information, but applies it in a temporally-evolving manner for video.

**Specs:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Perceptual Hash Generator:** A robust perceptual hash algorithm (pHash) that generates a unique hash representing a short segment of video (e.g., 1 second). This hash isn’t for strict comparison, but as a seed for watermark generation. Algorithms like Average Hash, Difference Hash, or Wavelet Hash can be used.

*   **Random Seed Generator:**  Similar to the patent's random information source, a secure random number generator (RNG) provides unpredictable seeds. These seeds are used to modulate the watermark embedding process.

*   **Watermark Embedding Function:**  A function that embeds the watermark based on the pHash, random seed, and a key.  This utilizes a discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain embedding.

*   **Watermark Extraction Function:**  A corresponding function to extract the watermark, reliant on the pHash and random seed.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Content Segmentation:** The video is divided into non-overlapping segments (e.g., 1-second clips).
2.  **pHash Generation:**  A pHash is generated for each segment.
3.  **Random Seed Acquisition:** A random seed is obtained.
4.  **Watermark Generation:** A unique watermark is generated for each segment, based on the pHash, random seed, and a pre-shared key. The watermark isn’t a visible image; it's a pattern of subtle modifications to the DCT coefficients of the video segment.
5.  **DCT Modification:** The selected DCT coefficients in each segment are subtly altered according to the generated watermark pattern.
6.  **Reconstruction:** The video is reconstructed, embedding the watermark.
7.  **Verification:** The extraction function uses the same pHash, random seed, and key to detect the watermark.

**III. Temporal Drift & Dynamic Keying:**

*   **Temporal Drift:** The random seed is *not* constant throughout the video. Instead, it changes according to a deterministic function of the segment number, introducing temporal drift.  This means the watermark changes slightly over time, making it harder to detect with static analysis.

    `seed_n = hash(segment_number, base_seed)`
*   **Dynamic Keying:** The pre-shared key isn’t fixed either.  It's derived from the video content itself using a cryptographic hash function.

    `key = hash(video_hash)`
*   **Multi-Layer Embedding**: Multiple watermark layers, each with a different temporal drift pattern and key derivation function, are embedded simultaneously, enhancing robustness.

**IV. Pseudocode (Watermark Embedding)**

```pseudocode
function embed_watermark(video, base_seed):
  video_hash = hash(video)
  key = hash(video_hash)
  for segment_number in range(video.segment_count):
    segment = video.get_segment(segment_number)
    seed = hash(segment_number, base_seed)
    watermark = generate_watermark(seed, key, segment) # generates DCT coefficient pattern
    modified_segment = apply_watermark(segment, watermark)
    video.replace_segment(segment_number, modified_segment)
  return video
```

**V. Key Innovations:**

*   **DCT Coefficient Manipulation**: Uses DCT coefficients for embedding, minimizing perceptual impact.
*   **Temporal Drift**: Watermark shifts over time, hindering detection.
*   **Content-Derived Key**: Enhanced security through content-based key generation.
*   **Multi-Layer Embedding**: Increases robustness and security.
*   **Segment-Based**: Applies to arbitrary length video content.
