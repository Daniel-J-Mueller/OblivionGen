## Secure Device "Shadowing" for Proactive Authentication & Permissioning

**Concept:** Extend the device association framework to create a "shadow" profile of a device's typical usage patterns, proactively anticipating authentication needs and permission requests *before* the user explicitly initiates them. This moves beyond simple association to predictive access control.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Device Behavior Profiler (DBP)** - Runs on the second computing device (e.g., user's phone, tablet).
    *   Continuously monitors application usage, network activity, location data (with user consent), and sensor input (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope).
    *   Constructs a statistical model of "normal" device behavior. This model includes frequency of app launches, typical network destinations, common locations, and sensor patterns.
    *   Stores this model locally (encrypted) and sends anonymized/aggregated data to the server for global model refinement.
*   **Component 2: Shadow Profile Server (SPS)** - A central server component.
    *   Receives anonymized behavior data from multiple DBP instances.
    *   Builds a global model of typical device usage.
    *   Maintains a "shadow profile" for each registered device, combining global data with device-specific observations.
    *   Calculates a "behavioral risk score" based on deviations from the expected profile.
*   **Component 3: Predictive Access Controller (PAC)** -  Integrated with applications and services.
    *   Intercepts requests for access (e.g., launching an app, accessing a file, making a purchase).
    *   Queries the SPS for the deviceâ€™s behavioral risk score.
    *   Adjusts authentication/authorization requirements based on the risk score.
        *   **Low Risk:**  Transparent access (no additional prompts).
        *   **Medium Risk:**  Step-up authentication (e.g., PIN, biometric scan).
        *   **High Risk:**  Multi-factor authentication, transaction review, or access denial.

**Pseudocode (PAC):**

```
function handleAccessRequest(resource, user, deviceID) {
  riskScore = getRiskScoreFromSPS(deviceID)

  if (riskScore < 0.3) {  // Low risk
    grantAccess(resource, user)
  } else if (riskScore < 0.7) { // Medium risk
    promptForStepUpAuth(user)
    if (authSuccessful) {
      grantAccess(resource, user)
    } else {
      denyAccess(resource, user)
    }
  } else { // High risk
    initiateMFA(user)
    if (mfaSuccessful) {
      grantAccess(resource, user)
    } else {
      denyAccess(resource, user)
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User interacts with device.
2.  DBP monitors device behavior.
3.  DBP sends anonymized data to SPS.
4.  SPS updates shadow profile.
5.  Application requests access.
6.  PAC queries SPS for risk score.
7.  PAC adjusts authentication requirements.
8.  User authenticates (if needed).
9.  Access granted or denied.

**Novelty:**  Shifts from reactive authentication to predictive access control, enhancing security and user experience by anticipating needs and proactively adjusting authentication levels. This is distinct from traditional risk-based authentication which typically relies on contextual factors like location or device type.
