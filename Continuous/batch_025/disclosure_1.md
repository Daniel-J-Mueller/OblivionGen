## Modular Electronic Device with Bio-Integrated Sensors

**Concept:** A highly modular electronic device featuring interchangeable functional modules and integrated bio-sensors for personalized data collection and environmental awareness. This moves beyond simply *displaying* information to actively *sensing* and reacting to the user's physiological state and surrounding environment.

**Modules:**

*   **Core Module:** Houses the central processing unit, power source (inductive charging), and primary communication interfaces (Bluetooth 6.0, UWB). Roughly 50mm x 50mm x 8mm. Features a magnetic interlocking system for module attachment.
*   **Display Module:**  Flexible OLED display, variable size (80mm-160mm diagonal). Attaches magnetically to the Core Module. User-configurable display layouts.
*   **Input Module:** Options include: physical buttons, capacitive touch sliders, miniature haptic keyboard, voice input array.
*   **Sensor Module:** *Key innovation*. Contains a suite of bio-sensors:
    *   **Electrodermal Activity (EDA) Sensor:** Measures skin conductance for stress/emotion detection.
    *   **Photoplethysmography (PPG) Sensor:** Measures heart rate and blood oxygen saturation.
    *   **Temperature Sensor:** Measures skin temperature.
    *   **Microphone Array:** Environmental sound analysis and voice control. *Also* detects subtle vocal biomarkers linked to physiological states (e.g., stress, fatigue).
    *   **Air Quality Sensor:** Detects VOCs, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide.
*   **Expansion Modules:** User-defined modules. Possible examples: small camera, NFC/RFID reader, GPS module.

**Bio-Integration & Data Processing:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Raw sensor data is processed on-device using a neural network to create a “physiological profile” of the user. This profile isn’t simply a list of metrics, but a dynamic, contextualized representation of the user’s state.
*   **Adaptive Interface:** The device’s interface dynamically adjusts based on the user’s physiological profile and environmental conditions. For example:
    *   If high stress is detected, the display might switch to a calming color scheme and offer guided breathing exercises.
    *   If poor air quality is detected, the device might suggest moving to a different location.
    *   Based on voice biomarker analysis, the device can predict moments of fatigue/reduced focus and prompt the user to take a break.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Subtle haptic vibrations are used to provide non-intrusive alerts and guidance.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Interface Logic):**

```
// Define thresholds for physiological metrics
const stressThreshold = 0.7;
const fatigueThreshold = 0.6;
const airQualityThreshold = 0.5;

// Function to analyze physiological data
function analyzeData(eda, hr, temp, voc) {
  stressLevel = calculateStressLevel(eda);
  fatigueLevel = calculateFatigueLevel(hr, temp);
  airQualityLevel = calculateAirQualityLevel(voc);

  return {stress: stressLevel, fatigue: fatigueLevel, airQuality: airQualityLevel};
}

// Function to adjust interface based on data
function adjustInterface(data) {
  if (data.stress > stressThreshold) {
    setDisplayTheme("calming");
    displayMessage("Detected high stress. Try a guided breathing exercise?");
  }
  if (data.fatigue > fatigueThreshold) {
    setDisplayTheme("energizing");
    displayMessage("Detecting fatigue. Consider taking a break.");
  }
  if (data.airQuality < airQualityThreshold) {
    displayMessage("Air quality is poor. Consider moving to a better ventilated area.");
  }
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  eda = readEDA();
  hr = readHR();
  temp = readTemp();
  voc = readVOC();

  data = analyzeData(eda, hr, temp, voc);
  adjustInterface(data);

  delay(100ms);
}
```
