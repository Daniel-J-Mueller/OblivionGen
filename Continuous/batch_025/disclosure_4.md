## Dynamic Media Comment Remixing & Reactive Soundscapes

**Concept:** Expand the user comment system to allow for real-time, AI-driven remixing of submitted audio comments into a dynamic, reactive soundscape layered *underneath* the primary content. Instead of simply *playing* the comment, the system transforms it, and other simultaneous comments, into evolving audio textures.

**Specs:**

*   **Audio Feature Extraction Module:** Extract key features from incoming audio comments: pitch, tempo, timbre, energy, harmonic content. This runs continuously.
*   **Soundscape Generation Engine:** Uses extracted features to drive a procedural audio engine.  The engine can:
    *   **Granular Synthesis:**  Chop comments into small grains and re-arrange/manipulate them, creating textures.
    *   **Spectral Morphing:** Blend the spectral characteristics of multiple comments, creating evolving tonal shifts.
    *   **Reverb/Delay Network:**  Dynamically adjust reverb/delay parameters based on comment density and emotional tone (determined by AI analysis – see below).
    *   **Harmonic Resynthesis:**  Extract harmonic content and recreate it with different instruments/synthesizers.
*   **AI Sentiment Analysis Module:** Analyze the audio comment (using speech-to-text and NLP) *and* its acoustic properties (energy, pitch variation) to determine the emotional tone. This influences the soundscape generation parameters.  Positive sentiment = brighter, more harmonious textures.  Negative sentiment = darker, more dissonant textures.
*   **Real-time Parameter Mapping:** Map extracted features and sentiment scores to various soundscape parameters (e.g., grain density, reverb size, filter cutoff, spectral tilt).
*   **Content-Aware Blending:**  The system dynamically adjusts the volume/presence of the soundscape *underneath* the primary content, based on the content’s characteristics (e.g., speech, music, silence).  Prevent soundscape from overpowering the primary audio.
*   **User Control Layer (Optional):** Allow content creators to adjust “global” soundscape parameters (e.g., overall intensity, sonic palette, emotional bias) and/or set filters to exclude certain types of comments.

**Pseudocode (Soundscape Generation Loop):**

```
FOR EACH incoming audio comment:
    Extract audio features (pitch, tempo, timbre, energy, harmonics)
    Perform sentiment analysis (text + audio)
    
    Adjust soundscape parameters based on features and sentiment:
        grainDensity = sentimentScore * scaleFactor + baseDensity
        reverbSize = energy * reverbScale + baseReverb
        filterCutoff = pitch * cutoffScale + baseCutoff
        
    Apply changes to procedural audio engine
    
    Mix soundscape output with primary content output (dynamic gain control)
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond simple comment playback to create a fully immersive, reactive audio experience. It’s no longer just *hearing* the audience; it's *feeling* their presence as an evolving sonic texture woven into the primary content.  The system effectively turns audience comments into a generative sound installation.
