## Adaptive Encryption Profiles via Behavioral Biometrics

**System Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Behavioral Biometrics Module (BBM) – Captures and analyzes user interaction patterns (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, application usage sequences).
    *   Encryption Profile Generator (EPG) – Dynamically adjusts encryption algorithms and key lengths based on BBM output.
    *   Data Stream Interceptor (DSI) – Intercepts outbound data streams to apply EPG-determined encryption.
    *   Secure Enclave – Dedicated hardware/software environment for key management and BBM data processing.
    *   Service Provider Network – Standard networking infrastructure.
    *   Client System – User’s device.
    *   Incubator System – System performing sensitive operations.

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  User interacts with client system. BBM continuously captures behavioral data.
    2.  BBM data is processed within the Secure Enclave to generate a behavioral profile.
    3.  EPG receives behavioral profile and, based on pre-defined risk thresholds and policy, determines optimal encryption profile (algorithm, key length, salting method, etc.).
    4.  DSI intercepts data outbound from the client system to the incubator system.
    5.  DSI applies encryption profile generated by EPG before transmission.
    6.  Incubator system receives encrypted data, decrypts, performs operation, re-encrypts using the same profile (or a modified profile based on data sensitivity level).
    7.  Data returned to the client system is decrypted using the original (or modified) profile.

*   **Encryption Profile Generation Logic:**

    ```pseudocode
    function generate_encryption_profile(behavioral_profile, data_sensitivity):
        risk_score = calculate_risk_score(behavioral_profile)

        if risk_score < 30:  # Low Risk
            algorithm = AES-128
            key_length = 128
            salting_method = SHA256
        elif risk_score >= 30 and risk_score < 70:  # Medium Risk
            algorithm = AES-256
            key_length = 256
            salting_method = Argon2id
        else:  # High Risk
            algorithm = ChaCha20-Poly1305
            key_length = 256
            salting_method = scrypt

        if data_sensitivity == "HIGH":
            key_length = 256  // Always use larger key for highly sensitive data
            algorithm = ChaCha20-Poly1305 // More resilient

        return EncryptionProfile(algorithm, key_length, salting_method)
    ```

*   **Secure Enclave Requirements:**
    *   Tamper-resistant hardware.
    *   Dedicated processing capabilities for BBM analysis.
    *   Secure key storage and management.

*   **Policy Configuration:**
    *   Administrators define risk thresholds for BBM outputs.
    *   Data sensitivity levels are assigned to different data types.
    *   Encryption profiles are pre-configured for different risk/sensitivity combinations.

*   **Data Types:**
    *   Sensitive user data (PII, financial information, health records).
    *   Application usage patterns.
    *   Network traffic metadata.

*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy.

**Innovation Description:**

This system shifts from static encryption profiles to adaptive encryption based on real-time user behavior. By integrating behavioral biometrics, the system can dynamically adjust encryption strength based on perceived risk. A 'normal' user interacting with the system receives a lower level of encryption (faster processing), while anomalous behavior triggers stronger encryption. This provides a balance between security and performance. The system does not rely on pre-defined rules, but adapts based on the user's own interaction patterns. This is a layer of security that the adversary can't know.
