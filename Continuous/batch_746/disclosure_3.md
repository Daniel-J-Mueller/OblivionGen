## Dynamic Task Partitioning & Predictive Timeout Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic timeout concept to not just *adjust* timeouts, but to *partition* tasks into sub-tasks, executed in parallel, with individual, predictive timeouts. This aims to reduce overall execution risk and improve responsiveness, especially for large, heterogeneous datasets.

**Specifications:**

**1. Task Decomposition Module:**

*   **Input:** Task definition (including input data characteristics â€“ size, type, expected complexity).
*   **Process:** Analyze the task definition and input data characteristics. Employ a rule-based system *and* a machine learning model (trained on historical task execution data) to determine an optimal task decomposition strategy.
    *   **Decomposition Strategies:**
        *   *Data Partitioning:* Divide the input data into independent subsets, processed concurrently.
        *   *Functional Decomposition:* Break down the task into independent functional units (e.g., data cleaning, feature extraction, model training).
        *   *Hybrid Decomposition:* Combine data and functional partitioning.
*   **Output:**  A task graph representing the decomposed task, including dependencies between sub-tasks.

**2. Predictive Timeout Engine:**

*   **Input:** Task graph, input data characteristics for each sub-task, historical task execution data.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each sub-task, estimate its execution duration using a combination of:
        *   *Historical Data:* Regression model trained on execution times of similar sub-tasks with similar data characteristics.
        *   *Resource Allocation:* Estimate execution time based on allocated resources (CPU, memory, GPU) and resource utilization metrics.
        *   *Data Sampling:* Execute a small sample of the input data to estimate execution time for a representative portion.
    *   Calculate a *confidence interval* for the estimated execution duration.
    *   Set the timeout duration for each sub-task based on the upper bound of the confidence interval *plus* a safety margin (configurable parameter).
*   **Output:** Timeout duration for each sub-task in the task graph.

**3. Parallel Execution & Monitoring System:**

*   **Input:** Task graph with timeout durations, input data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Distribute sub-tasks to available resource pools.
    *   Execute sub-tasks in parallel.
    *   Monitor execution time of each sub-task.
    *   If a sub-task exceeds its timeout duration:
        *   Terminate the sub-task.
        *   Attempt to re-execute the sub-task with a reduced input dataset or a simplified algorithm.
        *   Alert the system administrator.
    *   Aggregate results from completed sub-tasks.
*   **Output:** Final task result.

**4. Dynamic Adjustment & Learning Loop:**

*   Continuously monitor task execution times and update the historical data used by the Predictive Timeout Engine.
*   Employ reinforcement learning techniques to optimize task decomposition strategies and timeout duration calculations.
*   Adjust the safety margin based on system load and resource availability.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Timeout Engine):**

```
function calculate_timeout(task_graph, sub_task, historical_data):
  // Estimate execution time based on historical data
  estimated_time = regression_model(historical_data, sub_task.data_characteristics)

  // Adjust for resource allocation
  allocated_resources = get_allocated_resources(sub_task)
  estimated_time = estimated_time * resource_factor(allocated_resources)

  // Add safety margin
  safety_margin = config.safety_margin * estimated_time
  timeout = estimated_time + safety_margin

  return timeout
```
