## Adaptive Projection for Collaborative Augmented Reality on Dynamic Surfaces

**Concept:** Extend the projection-based interaction described in the provided patent to support multiple users collaboratively interacting with augmented reality elements *directly on* dynamic, non-planar surfaces (e.g., a moving robotic arm, a deformable material, a human body).  Instead of simply adjusting projection based on *one* head obstructing information, the system dynamically warps and adapts the projection to account for multiple users, their movements, and the changing geometry of the target surface.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Multi-Camera System:**  Minimum of 4 high-resolution, synchronized cameras with overlapping fields of view surrounding the target surface.  Cameras must support both RGB and depth data capture (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect).
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Attached to the target surface to track its 6DoF (degrees of freedom) movement.  High-frequency data transmission required.
    *   **User Tracking System:**  Wearable markers (fiducial markers, or potentially body pose estimation via computer vision) to uniquely identify and track the position and orientation of each user. Low-latency communication is essential.
*   **Projection System:**
    *   **Array of Projectors:**  Multiple (minimum 4, scalable) short-throw projectors with high refresh rates and automatic keystone correction. Projectors must be calibrated to a common coordinate system.
    *   **Projection Surface Mapping:** Capability to dynamically generate a 3D mesh representing the target surface. The IMU and camera data contribute to this mapping.
*   **Computing Hardware:**
    *   **High-Performance GPU:**  NVIDIA RTX 3090 or equivalent.
    *   **Multi-Core CPU:**  Intel Core i9 or equivalent.
    *   **High-Bandwidth Memory:**  64GB+ RAM.
    *   **Real-Time Operating System:**  To ensure low latency and deterministic performance.

**Software Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
Calibrate Cameras & Projectors
Establish Communication with IMU & User Tracking System

// Main Loop
While (System Running)
{
    // 1. Data Acquisition
    CameraData = Capture Camera Data
    IMUData = Read IMU Data
    UserPositions = Get User Positions from Tracking System

    // 2. Surface Reconstruction
    SurfaceMesh = Reconstruct 3D Surface using CameraData & IMUData
    //     (Potentially use techniques like Structure from Motion, SLAM)

    // 3. Obstruction Mapping
    ObstructionMap = Create Obstruction Map based on:
        SurfaceMesh
        UserPositions
        CameraData (for finer detail – hand tracking, etc.)

    // 4. Projection Warping & Blending
    For Each Projector:
    {
        ProjectedImage = BaseImage //Initial AR content
        For Each Obstruction in ObstructionMap:
        {
            Region = Calculate Projection Region corresponding to Obstruction
            AdjustBrightness(ProjectedImage, Region, ObstructionIntensity) //Dim or hide
            ApplyWarp(ProjectedImage, Region, ObstructionShape) //Distort around obstruction
        }
        Blend(ProjectedImage, ProjectorViewFrustum) //Correct perspective
        SendToProjector(ProjectedImage, Projector)
    }
}
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Dynamic Mesh Generation:**  The system isn’t limited to static surfaces. It reconstructs the target surface in real-time, accounting for movement and deformation.
*   **Multi-User Obstruction Handling:**  The system accounts for *multiple* obstructions from multiple users.
*   **Projection Warping and Blending:**  Goes beyond simply dimming the image. The system *warps* the projection around obstructions, creating a more seamless AR experience.
*   **Adaptive Brightness Control:** Obstruction intensity is adjusted according to distance and occlusion, for a visually convincing effect.
*   **Scalability:** The number of projectors can be increased to cover larger or more complex surfaces.
