## Dynamic Environmental Mesh & Predictive Automation

**Core Concept:** Expand the multi-hub control system to incorporate a dynamically generated, AI-maintained mesh network representing the environment, prioritizing predictive automation based on learned user behavior and contextual awareness beyond simple rules.

**System Specs:**

*   **Environmental Mapping Module:**
    *   Utilizes a combination of low-power Bluetooth beacons, UWB (Ultra-Wideband) sensors, and camera/lidar data (optional, configurable) to construct a real-time map of the environment.
    *   Map data includes object identification (furniture, appliances, people), spatial relationships, and dynamic obstacle detection.
    *   Mesh network topology adjusts automatically based on signal strength and sensor availability, ensuring redundancy and resilience.
*   **Behavioral Learning Engine:**
    *   Monitors user interactions with devices, environmental changes (light levels, temperature), and time-based patterns.
    *   Employs machine learning (recurrent neural networks) to predict user needs and preferences.
    *   Generates “proactive routines” that automatically adjust device settings *before* a user explicitly requests them.
*   **Contextual Awareness Layer:**
    *   Integrates data from external sources: weather forecasts, calendar appointments, news feeds, traffic reports.
    *   Uses this data to refine predictions and trigger appropriate actions. (e.g., automatically preheating the oven if a calendar event indicates dinner guests are arriving).
*   **Distributed Control Architecture:**
    *   Each hub acts as a node in the mesh network, responsible for controlling devices within its immediate vicinity.
    *   Control decisions are made locally whenever possible, minimizing latency and reliance on a central server.
    *   A distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft) ensures consistency across the network.
*   **API & SDK:**
    *   Provides a public API for developers to integrate their own devices and services.
    *   Includes an SDK for creating custom proactive routines and contextual awareness rules.

**Pseudocode – Proactive Routine Generation:**

```
function generateProactiveRoutine(userProfile, environmentalData, historicalData):
    // historicalData: user interactions with devices, time of day, etc.
    // environmentalData: current temperature, light levels, occupancy.
    // userProfile: preferred settings, routines, and habits.

    predictedAction = null
    confidenceScore = 0

    // 1. Analyze historical data to identify patterns.
    patterns = analyzeHistory(historicalData)

    // 2. Evaluate current environmental conditions.
    relevantConditions = filterConditions(patterns, environmentalData)

    // 3. Predict the most likely action based on patterns and conditions.
    predictedAction, confidenceScore = predictAction(relevantConditions)

    // 4. If confidence score exceeds a threshold, trigger the action.
    if confidenceScore > 0.8:
        triggerAction(predictedAction)
        logAction(predictedAction, confidenceScore)

    return predictedAction
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Low-power Bluetooth beacons (for initial mesh establishment).
*   UWB sensors (for precise location tracking and obstacle detection).
*   Edge computing hubs (with sufficient processing power for AI tasks).
*   Optional: Camera/lidar sensors for visual environmental mapping.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart home automation with proactive device control.
*   Personalized environmental experiences based on user preferences.
*   Adaptive lighting and temperature control for optimal comfort.
*   Enhanced security and safety through predictive threat detection.
*   Automated building management and energy efficiency.
