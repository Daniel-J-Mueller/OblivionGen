**Adaptive Alt-Text Generation with Emotional Context**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Modules:** Image Analysis Module, Emotion Detection Module, Alt-Text Generation Module, User Feedback Module.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** High-performance CPU, GPU for image processing, sufficient RAM for model loading and operation.
*   **Software Requirements:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Computer Vision Libraries (OpenCV), Natural Language Processing Libraries (NLTK/spaCy).

**Innovation Description:**

This system extends automatic alt-text scoring/generation by incorporating emotional context derived from both the image *and* user input/history. The current patent focuses on descriptive accuracy; this expands to *emotional resonance*.

1.  **Image Analysis Module:** Standard object detection/scene understanding (CNN). Adds an emotional analysis sub-module. This uses a pre-trained model (e.g., based on AffectNet) to estimate the dominant emotions *expressed within the image itself* (e.g., joy, sadness, anger).  Output: Object list + Emotion vector (probability distribution over emotions).

2.  **User Profile & History:** Tracks user interaction with images. Stores:
    *   Past alt-text inputs.
    *   Explicit feedback (e.g., “helpful”, “not helpful”).
    *   Implicit signals: time spent viewing images, scroll depth, click-through rates.
    *   User-defined emotional preferences (e.g., “I prefer optimistic descriptions”).

3.  **Emotion Detection Module:** This module analyses user-provided text *and* profile data to determine the user's current emotional state. This leverages sentiment analysis and potentially more advanced techniques like emotion recognition from text. Output: User Emotion vector.

4.  **Alt-Text Generation Module:**
    *   **Input:** Object list (from Image Analysis), Image Emotion vector, User Emotion vector, User Preferences.
    *   **Process:** A transformer-based language model generates alt-text.  Crucially, the model is *conditioned* on all four inputs.  It doesn't just aim for descriptive accuracy; it aims for *emotional alignment*. The model adjusts word choice and phrasing to match the image's emotion *and* the user's emotion/preferences.
    *   **Example:** If the image shows a sad child, and the user is also detected to be in a somber mood, the alt-text might be: “A young child looks forlorn, lost in thought.”  If the user is known to prefer optimistic descriptions, the alt-text might be: "A pensive child, quietly contemplating the world."

5.  **User Feedback Loop:** The system presents the generated alt-text and requests explicit feedback. This feedback is used to refine the model and personalize alt-text generation further.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def generate_alt_text(image_data, user_profile):
  image_features, image_emotion = analyze_image(image_data)
  user_emotion = detect_user_emotion(user_profile)

  alt_text = transformer_model(
      image_features,
      image_emotion,
      user_emotion,
      user_profile.preferences
  )

  return alt_text

def analyze_image(image_data):
  # Object detection (CNN)
  objects = detect_objects(image_data)
  # Emotion recognition (AffectNet-based model)
  emotion_vector = recognize_emotion(image_data)
  return objects, emotion_vector
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Accessibility: More nuanced and emotionally appropriate alt-text for visually impaired users.
*   Marketing: Alt-text that aligns with the desired brand emotional tone.
*   Social Media: Alt-text that enhances emotional engagement.
*   Personalized Experiences:  Alt-text tailored to individual user preferences.
