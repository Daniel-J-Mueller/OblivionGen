## Adaptive Reverberation Profiling via Multi-Modal Sensory Fusion

**Concept:** Extend blind reverberation estimation beyond purely audio analysis by incorporating data from other sensors – specifically, accelerometers and depth cameras – to create a richer, more accurate, and *dynamic* reverberation profile of the environment. This goes beyond static time decay estimations and aims to understand *how* sound reflects based on the physical space.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Audio Input:** Standard microphone array (existing).
*   **Accelerometer:** Miniature, low-power 3-axis accelerometer integrated into the device (e.g., smartphone, smart speaker).  Placement optimized for detecting subtle vibrations from sound reflections off surfaces.
*   **Depth Camera:** Time-of-Flight (ToF) or structured light depth camera. Resolution: Minimum 640x480. Range: 0.5m – 10m. Field of View: 60 degrees.
*   **Processing Unit:** Existing system processor with sufficient capacity for real-time multi-sensor data fusion and signal processing.

**II. Software Modules:**

*   **Audio Analysis Module:**  Existing autocorrelation-based reverberation estimation (from the referenced patent). Outputs: Estimated reverberation time, dynamic range.
*   **Accelerometer Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    *   Sampling Rate: 500 Hz.
    *   Signal Processing: Bandpass filter (20 Hz – 200 Hz) to isolate structural vibrations.  Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to analyze frequency content.
    *   Feature Extraction: Amplitude of vibration peaks correlating with audio signal frequencies.  Phase correlation between audio and accelerometer signals.
*   **Depth Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    *   Point Cloud Generation:  Convert depth data into a 3D point cloud representation of the environment.
    *   Surface Normal Estimation: Calculate the surface normals of detected surfaces.
    *   Reflection Point Identification:  Algorithm to identify potential sound reflection points based on point cloud geometry and source/receiver positions. Utilize ray tracing to approximate sound paths.
*   **Data Fusion Engine:** 
    *   **Kalman Filter:** Implement a Kalman filter to fuse data from audio, accelerometer, and depth sensors. State variables: Reverberation time, surface reflectivity, initial sound pressure level.
    *   **Weighting Factors:** Dynamically adjust weighting factors based on sensor reliability and signal quality. E.g., prioritize depth data in static environments, prioritize accelerometer data during active movement.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:**  Employ a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) to learn the correlation between multi-sensor data and actual reverberation characteristics.  Train the model on labeled data collected in diverse environments.
*   **Reverberation Profile Generator:**
    *   Create a spatially-aware reverberation profile that maps reverberation time and reflectivity to different areas of the environment.
    *   Output:  A 3D map representing the reverberation characteristics of the space.
* **De-reverberation Module**: Utilize the generated reverberation profile for advanced de-reverberation processing of incoming audio signals.



**III. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Calibration:** Initial calibration phase to establish coordinate systems and sensor biases.
2.  **Environment Mapping:** The device scans the environment using the depth camera to create a point cloud map.
3.  **Baseline Estimation:** Using the audio signal alone, the system estimates an initial reverberation time and dynamic range.
4.  **Multi-Sensor Fusion:** Simultaneously, the accelerometer captures structural vibrations and the depth camera identifies potential reflection points. The Kalman filter fuses this data with the audio-based estimation.
5.  **Dynamic Profile Generation:** The system generates a dynamic, spatially-aware reverberation profile of the environment.
6.  **Adaptive De-reverberation:** Incoming audio signals are processed using the dynamic reverberation profile to reduce reverberation and improve clarity.
7.  **Continuous Learning:** The system continuously refines its reverberation profile based on incoming sensor data and user feedback.

**Pseudocode (Data Fusion Engine - Simplified):**

```
// Input: audio_reverb_time, accelerometer_vibration_amplitude, depth_reflection_points
// Output: fused_reverberation_profile

function fuse_data(audio_reverb_time, accelerometer_vibration_amplitude, depth_reflection_points) {

  // Calculate weights based on sensor reliability & signal quality
  weight_audio = 0.5;
  weight_accel = 0.3;
  weight_depth = 0.2;

  // Adjust weights based on signal quality (e.g., SNR)

  // Combine data using weighted average
  fused_reverb_time = (weight_audio * audio_reverb_time) +
                      (weight_accel * accelerometer_vibration_amplitude) +
                      (weight_depth * depth_reflection_points.count);

  // Update the reverberation profile based on fused data
  reverberation_profile.update(fused_reverb_time);

  return reverberation_profile;
}
