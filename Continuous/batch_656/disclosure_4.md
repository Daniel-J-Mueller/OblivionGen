## Dynamic Tunnel Composition via Policy-Driven Header Stitching

**Concept:** Extend the programmable tunnel creation to allow *composition* of tunnel headers, creating multi-layered tunnels based on real-time policy decisions. Instead of a single tunnel header being inserted, the system dynamically stitches together multiple headers – each addressing a different layer of abstraction or security requirement – before transmission.

**Specifications:**

**1. Policy Engine Integration:**

*   **Policy Definition Language (PDL):** A declarative language for defining tunnel composition policies. Policies specify criteria (e.g., source/destination IP, application port, user identity) and the sequence of tunnel headers to apply. Example: `IF destination_port == 80 AND user_group == "finance" THEN tunnel_headers = [IPsec, VXLAN, MPLS]`.
*   **Policy Repository:** A centralized store for tunnel composition policies. This could be a database, configuration files, or a dedicated policy server.
*   **Policy Evaluation Engine:** A component that evaluates incoming packets against the defined policies and determines the appropriate tunnel header sequence.

**2. Header Stitching Mechanism:**

*   **Header Template Library:** A repository of pre-defined tunnel header templates (e.g., IPsec, VXLAN, GRE, MPLS, Geneve). Each template includes the header format, field definitions, and necessary configuration parameters.
*   **Dynamic Header Assembly:** Based on the policy evaluation, the system retrieves the required header templates and assembles them into a single, contiguous header block.  This requires careful handling of header lengths and offsets to ensure proper encapsulation.
*   **Header Validation:** Before transmission, the assembled header block is validated to ensure it conforms to the expected format and contains valid parameters.

**3. Packet Processing Pipeline Modification:**

*   **Policy Lookup Stage:** Insert a new stage in the packet processing pipeline to perform policy lookup and determine the tunnel header sequence.
*   **Header Stitching Stage:** Add a stage to dynamically assemble the tunnel headers. This stage utilizes the Header Template Library and Policy Evaluation Engine.
*   **Encapsulation Stage:** Encapsulate the original packet with the assembled tunnel headers.

**Pseudocode - Policy Evaluation & Header Stitching:**

```
FUNCTION process_packet(packet):
  policy_result = evaluate_policy(packet)
  tunnel_header_sequence = policy_result.tunnel_header_sequence

  assembled_header = ""
  FOR header_type IN tunnel_header_sequence:
    header_template = get_header_template(header_type)
    # Populate header fields with relevant data from packet/policy
    populated_header = populate_header(header_template, packet, policy_result)
    assembled_header += populated_header

  encapsulated_packet = encapsulate(packet, assembled_header)
  transmit(encapsulated_packet)

FUNCTION evaluate_policy(packet):
  # Lookup policy based on packet attributes (source/destination IP, port, etc.)
  policy = policy_repository.lookup(packet)
  RETURN policy

FUNCTION get_header_template(header_type):
  # Retrieve header template from the template library
  template = header_template_library.get(header_type)
  RETURN template

FUNCTION populate_header(template, packet, policy):
  # Fill in header fields with data from packet and policy
  header = template.clone()
  header.source_ip = packet.source_ip
  header.destination_ip = policy.tunnel_destination_ip
  # ... other fields ...
  RETURN header
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Flexibility:**  Dynamically compose tunnels based on real-time requirements.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Layer multiple security protocols (e.g., IPsec within VXLAN) for defense in depth.
*   **Simplified Management:**  Centralized policy definition simplifies tunnel configuration.
*   **Improved Scalability:** Adapt to changing network conditions and traffic patterns.

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a packet processor with sufficient processing power and memory to handle dynamic header assembly.
*   Consider using hardware acceleration for header processing and encryption.
*   Content Addressable Memory (CAM) can be used to efficiently lookup policies and header templates.
