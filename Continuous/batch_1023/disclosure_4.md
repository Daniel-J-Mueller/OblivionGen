## Dynamic Tag ‘Ecosystems’ & Predictive Merging

**Concept:** Extend the tag merging functionality into a dynamic ‘ecosystem’ where tags aren’t simply merged, but rather enter into complex relationships – borrowing ‘influence’ from each other and predicting potential future mergers based on user behavior and item associations.

**Specs:**

**1. Influence Propagation:**

*   **Data Structure:** Implement a weighted graph where tags are nodes and edges represent the ‘influence’ between them. Weight is a numerical value.
*   **Influence Calculation:**
    *   Initial Weight: Start with a default weight (e.g., 0.1) for all tag pairs.
    *   Item Overlap: Increase weight based on the number of shared items between tags. (Formula: `weight += (overlap_count / total_items) * influence_factor`).
    *   User Co-occurrence: Increase weight if users frequently interact with both tags in the same session. (Formula: `weight += (co_occurrence_count / total_sessions) * influence_factor`).
    *   Decay: Implement a decay mechanism to reduce weight over time, reflecting changing trends.
*   **Influence Propagation Algorithm:**  Periodically (e.g., daily) propagate influence through the graph.  A tag’s ‘influence score’ is calculated as the sum of weighted influences from all connected tags. This score impacts tag visibility and predictive merging (see below).

**2. Predictive Tag Merging:**

*   **Algorithm:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) trained on historical tag merging data, item associations, user behavior, and tag influence scores.
*   **Input Features:**
    *   Tag Influence Score (from section 1)
    *   Item Overlap Percentage
    *   User Co-occurrence Rate
    *   Trend Data (e.g., rate of item association with each tag)
    *   Historical Merge Data (tags previously merged)
*   **Output:** A ‘merge probability’ score for each tag pair.  Tags exceeding a certain threshold are flagged as potential candidates for automatic or suggested merging.
*   **Automatic Merging (Optional):**  Allow for automatic merging of tags with extremely high merge probability and minimal user engagement. Provide an ‘undo’ function for erroneous merges.

**3. Tag ‘Ecosystem’ Visualization:**

*   **Interface:** Display a visual representation of the tag ecosystem.
    *   Tags are nodes.
    *   Node size represents tag popularity (number of associated items/user engagement).
    *   Edge thickness represents influence strength.
    *   Color-coding to indicate merge probability (e.g., red = high probability, green = low probability).
*   **Interaction:** Allow users to explore the ecosystem, filter tags, and view detailed information about tag relationships.

**4. Dynamic Tag ‘Parenting’/’Branching’**

*   If two tags merge, instead of simply collapsing one into the other, establish a ‘parent-child’ relationship. The original tags remain visible (perhaps dimmed) as ‘child’ tags under the new merged ‘parent’ tag.
*   Users can switch between viewing items associated with the ‘parent’ tag or drilling down into the individual ‘child’ tags.
*   This preserves historical data and allows for more nuanced navigation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Predictive Merging):**

```
function predict_merge_probability(tag1, tag2):
  overlap_percentage = calculate_item_overlap(tag1, tag2)
  co_occurrence_rate = calculate_user_co_occurrence(tag1, tag2)
  tag1_influence = get_tag_influence(tag1)
  tag2_influence = get_tag_influence(tag2)

  // Example linear model - replace with more complex model
  probability = (overlap_percentage * weight_overlap) + (co_occurrence_rate * weight_co_occurrence) + (tag1_influence * weight_influence) + (tag2_influence * weight_influence)

  return probability
