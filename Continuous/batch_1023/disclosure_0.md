## Adaptive Computation Sharding with Predictive Pre-Computation

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to dynamically shard computations *not only* based on intensity, but also on predicted resource availability *and* preemptively compute common operations for a cohort of clients, leveraging a probabilistic model of future requests. This aims to reduce latency and improve overall throughput by anticipating needs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Request Model:**

*   **Data Collection:** Monitor request patterns (computation type, data size, client ID, time of day, etc.) across all clients.
*   **Probabilistic Model:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict the probability of specific computations being requested within a defined timeframe (e.g., next 5-10 seconds). This model must be updated continuously.
*   **Cohort Identification:**  Clients are grouped into cohorts based on similar request patterns.  Cohorts must be dynamic, allowing clients to shift between groups.
*   **Thresholding:** Define a confidence threshold for prediction. Only computations with a probability exceeding this threshold are considered for pre-computation.

**2. Adaptive Computation Sharding:**

*   **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitor resource availability (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) across all nodes in the data storage service and external components.
*   **Dynamic Sharding:** The system analyzes the computational intensity of a request *and* the current resource availability.  It then shards the computation across available nodes (internal and external) using a cost-benefit algorithm.  Factors to consider:
    *   Node capacity
    *   Network latency between node and client
    *   Cost of using external components (if applicable)
*   **Pre-Computation Integration:**  If a pre-computed result exists for a likely future request (based on the predictive model), the system prioritizes using that result.  This is a fast-path bypassing the normal sharding process.
*   **Computation Queue:** Implement a priority-based computation queue. Pre-computed tasks are given highest priority.

**3. System Components:**

*   **Predictive Analytics Engine:**  Responsible for building and maintaining the predictive request model. Runs as a separate service, interacting with the data storage service via API.
*   **Resource Manager:** Monitors node resources and provides availability information to the computation sharding module.
*   **Computation Sharding Module:**  Resides within the data storage service.  Responsible for dynamically sharding computations and integrating pre-computed results.
*   **Pre-Computation Cache:** A distributed cache to store pre-computed results.  Employ an eviction policy (e.g., LRU) to manage cache size.

**4. Pseudocode (Computation Sharding Module):**

```pseudocode
function shardComputation(request):
  computationType = request.computation
  data = request.data

  // Check for pre-computed result
  cachedResult = preComputationCache.get(computationType, data)
  if cachedResult != null:
    return cachedResult

  // Check prediction for future requests
  prediction = predictiveAnalyticsEngine.predict(computationType, data)
  if prediction.confidence > threshold:
      //Initiate asynchronous pre-computation
      preComputationCache.set(computationType, data, "IN_PROGRESS")
      //Run computation on dedicated background process
      asyncResult = runComputation(computationType, data)
      preComputationCache.set(computationType, data, asyncResult)
      return asyncResult

  // Determine Computational Intensity
  intensity = estimateIntensity(computationType, data)

  // Check Resource Availability
  availableResources = resourceManager.getAvailableResources()

  // Choose Sharding Strategy
  if intensity > threshold and availableResources < intensity:
    shardingStrategy = "external"
  else:
    shardingStrategy = "internal"

  // Execute Computation
  if shardingStrategy == "external":
    result = externalComponent.execute(computationType, data)
  else:
    result = internalNodes.execute(computationType, data)

  return result
```

**5. API Endpoints:**

*   `/predict`: (Predictive Analytics Engine) – Returns the probability of a computation being requested.
*   `/resources`: (Resource Manager) – Returns available resources.
*   `/execute`: (Data Storage Service) – Executes a computation.

**6. Scalability & Reliability:**

*   Use a distributed caching system (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for the pre-computation cache.
*   Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for all system components.
*   Employ horizontal scaling to handle increasing load.
