## Spectral Signature Mapping for Personalized Hydration

**Concept:** Extend the multi-filter approach to create a detailed spectral signature map of subcutaneous fluid levels, allowing for *personalized* hydration assessment and guidance. Rather than simply measuring hydration, this system aims to understand *how* an individual’s body absorbs and retains fluids.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Employ a sensor module containing *seven* distinct narrowband filters, each centered on a specific wavelength between 500nm and 950nm (e.g., 520nm, 550nm, 580nm, 630nm, 700nm, 800nm, 900nm).  Filters will be dielectric thin-film stacks.  Each filter directs light to a dedicated photodiode.
*   **Light Source:** Utilize a pulsed LED array capable of emitting light at the same seven wavelengths as the filters.  Pulsing minimizes interference and maximizes signal-to-noise.
*   **Sensor Housing:** Design a flexible sensor pad with an array of micro-lenses to focus light onto each photodiode. The pad conforms to the skin (e.g., forearm, inner wrist).  Multiple sensor pads of differing geometries will be made available.
*   **Data Acquisition:** A microcontroller simultaneously activates each wavelength and records the photodiode output.  Data is sampled at 100Hz.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Baseline Calibration:**  Each user performs a baseline measurement after a standardized hydration protocol (e.g., drinking 500ml water, resting for 30 minutes).
    2.  **Spectral Signature Creation:** A unique spectral signature is generated for the user, representing the absorbance and reflectance of light at each wavelength. This signature is normalized against the baseline.
    3.  **Hydration Mapping:** The algorithm creates a ‘hydration map’ – a heat map representing the distribution of fluid levels within the measured tissue.
    4.  **Personalized Guidance:** The system provides real-time hydration feedback and personalized recommendations based on the user's spectral signature and hydration map. Guidance includes estimated sweat rate during exercise, optimal fluid intake for different activities, and alerts for potential dehydration or overhydration.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transmission to a smartphone or other device.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize sensor, LEDs, BLE
// Calibrate user (baseline measurement)

loop:
    for each wavelength in [520nm, 550nm, 580nm, 630nm, 700nm, 800nm, 900nm]:
        activate LED at wavelength
        read photodiode output
        store data
    end for

    // Calculate spectral signature
    spectral_signature = calculate_signature(stored_data)

    // Create hydration map
    hydration_map = create_map(spectral_signature)

    // Provide personalized guidance
    guidance = generate_guidance(hydration_map, user_activity)

    // Transmit data via BLE
    transmit_data(spectral_signature, hydration_map, guidance)
end loop
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple hydration *detection* towards comprehensive hydration *mapping* and personalized guidance, leveraging a broader spectral range and individual baseline calibration. This allows for nuanced understanding of how fluid interacts with individual physiology.
