## Automated Textile Defect Prediction & Pre-emptive Cutting Path Adjustment

**Concept:** Integrate real-time defect prediction based on visual analysis *before* the cut is initiated, and dynamically adjust the cutting path to avoid identified flaws, minimizing waste and maximizing usable fabric area.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution, multi-spectral camera system integrated *above* the textile cutting bed. Capture visible light, infrared, and potentially UV spectrum data.
    *   Dedicated GPU processing unit for rapid image analysis.
    *   Existing textile cutter hardware (as described in the provided patent) capable of receiving dynamically adjusted cutting paths.

*   **Software Modules:**
    1.  **Pre-Cut Scan Module:**
        *   Initiates a full-bed scan *before* any cutting operation begins.
        *   Captures multi-spectral images of the textile sheet.
    2.  **Defect Prediction AI:**
        *   A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of textile defects (stains, weaves, holes, color variations). Dataset is augmented to include multi-spectral data.
        *   The CNN outputs a "defect probability map" â€“ a heatmap indicating the likelihood of defects at each point on the textile sheet.
        *   Probability threshold is adjustable based on fabric type/customer tolerance.
    3.  **Cutting Path Optimization Module:**
        *   Receives the defect probability map and the aggregated textile panel template.
        *   Algorithmically modifies the panel arrangement and cutting paths to:
            *   Avoid high-probability defect areas.
            *   Maximize panel yield.
            *   Minimize fabric waste.
        *   Constraint: Maintain panel shape and size tolerances.
        *   Optimization Strategy:  A genetic algorithm or simulated annealing approach.
        *   Output: Dynamically adjusted cutting path data.
    4.  **Real-Time Monitoring & Adjustment Module:**
        *   Continuously monitors the cutting process using a second camera system.
        *   Detects emerging defects *during* cutting.
        *   If a defect is detected, the cutting path is dynamically adjusted in real-time to avoid it.

*   **Pseudocode (Cutting Path Optimization):**

```
FUNCTION optimize_cutting_path(panel_template, defect_map)
  // panel_template: List of panel shapes and sizes
  // defect_map: 2D array representing defect probability

  // Initialize: Best solution = initial panel arrangement
  best_solution = initial_panel_arrangement(panel_template)
  best_waste = calculate_waste(best_solution)

  // Iterate through a set number of generations/iterations
  FOR i = 1 TO num_iterations:

    // Create a population of candidate solutions (panel arrangements)
    population = generate_population(panel_template)

    // Evaluate each solution in the population
    FOR each solution in population:
      // Check for overlap with defect areas in the defect_map
      IF solution overlaps defect_map:
        solution_fitness = low_score

      // Calculate waste based on panel arrangement
      waste = calculate_waste(solution)

      // Calculate a fitness score (combination of waste and defect avoidance)
      solution_fitness =  (1 - waste_ratio) * waste + defect_avoidance_score

      // If this solution is better than the best solution so far, update the best solution
      IF solution_fitness > best_solution_fitness:
        best_solution = solution
        best_solution_fitness = solution_fitness

    //Genetic algorithm: apply crossover and mutation to evolve population

  RETURN best_solution
```

*   **Integration with Existing System:** The system integrates with the existing system described in the patent by utilizing the same communication protocols for transmitting cutting path data to the textile cutter. The AI prediction modules add a pre-processing step before the cutting path generation.
