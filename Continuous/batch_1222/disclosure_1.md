## Adaptive Thermal Distribution Network for Wearable Electronics

**Concept:** Extend the principle of waste heat recovery beyond battery heating to create a dynamically adjustable thermal comfort system for wearable electronics – specifically, distributing heat *away* from components when cooling is needed, and *to* the battery (or other user-defined zones) when heating is required.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:**  A microfluidic layer integrated *within* the PCB, constructed from a thermally conductive polymer (e.g., silicone with ceramic fillers). This layer contains a network of channels etched directly into the PCB material.
*   **Actuation:** Miniature, solid-state thermo-electric coolers (TECs) positioned strategically along the microfluidic network. These TECs act as “thermal valves” –  capable of both heating *and* cooling the fluid.
*   **Working Fluid:** A dielectric fluid with high thermal conductivity and low viscosity (e.g., a fluorocarbon-based fluid). This fluid circulates through the microfluidic network.
*   **Sensors:** An array of micro-thermocouples and temperature sensors embedded throughout the device, monitoring component temperatures, battery temperature, and user-defined “comfort zones” (e.g., the area of the device contacting skin).
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller running a PID control algorithm. This algorithm adjusts the power to the TECs based on sensor readings and pre-defined temperature profiles.
*   **Heat Exchangers:** Miniature heat pipes or phase-change materials (PCMs) integrated into the device casing. These act as thermal reservoirs, absorbing or releasing heat as needed.

**Operation:**

1.  **Heat Harvesting:** Heat generated by the IR LEDs (and other components) is conducted into the microfluidic network via thermal vias.
2.  **Dynamic Distribution:** The control system analyzes sensor data and directs the working fluid to either:
    *   **Cooling Mode:** Direct fluid to the heat exchangers to dissipate heat, preventing component overheating.
    *   **Heating Mode:** Bypass the heat exchangers and circulate the fluid toward the battery to provide warmth.
3.  **Adaptive Comfort:**  The system can prioritize thermal management based on user preference or environmental conditions. For example:
    *   **Cold Weather:** Maximize heat transfer to the battery and user-contact points.
    *   **High Ambient Temperature:** Focus on cooling critical components.
4.  **Predictive Control:**  The microcontroller uses a predictive algorithm (based on usage patterns and environmental data) to proactively adjust thermal management, optimizing performance and battery life.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
loop:
    read_sensor_data()
    calculate_error(component_temp, target_temp)
    calculate_error(battery_temp, target_temp)
    calculate_error(comfort_zone_temp, target_temp)

    if (component_temp > max_temp):
        activate_tec(cooling_mode)
        direct_fluid(heat_exchanger)
    else if (battery_temp < min_temp):
        activate_tec(heating_mode)
        direct_fluid(battery)
    else:
        maintain_temperature(PID_control)

    update_target_temperature(user_preference, environmental_data)
    delay(10ms)
    goto loop
