## Acoustic Mapping & Personalized Sound Fields

**Concept:** Leverage the time-delay and source-direction capabilities described in the patent to create dynamic, personalized sound fields *around* the user, rather than simply attenuating noise.  Imagine 'sculpting' sound – boosting desired sounds while subtly shaping the acoustic environment to reduce reverberation or create a sense of spaciousness.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-element microphone array (minimum 16 transducers) integrated into a wearable (headband, glasses, collar). Array arranged in a hemispherical configuration for broad spatial coverage.
    *   Miniature, high-bandwidth digital signal processor (DSP) integrated into the wearable.
    *   Bone conduction transducers *and* miniature directional speakers embedded in the wearable.  Bone conduction for private audio, directional speakers for subtle environmental adjustments.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer – to track head orientation and movement.
    *   Optional:  Small, low-power LiDAR or Time-of-Flight sensor for rapid environmental mapping & object detection (within 5 meters).
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    1.  **Real-time Acoustic Mapping:**
        *   Utilize the microphone array to continuously analyze the acoustic environment.
        *   Employ beamforming techniques to identify and localize sound sources (speech, music, noise).
        *   Implement a Kalman filter to track moving sound sources.
        *   Create a dynamic 3D acoustic map of the surrounding environment.
    2.  **Personalized Sound Field Generation:**
        *   User profile:  Collect user preferences for sound quality (EQ, spatialization).  Allow selection of 'acoustic scenes' (e.g., ‘focused work’, ‘relaxed listening’, ‘enhanced speech’).
        *   Head tracking:  Use IMU data to precisely track head orientation and movement.
        *   Spatial Audio Engine:
            *   Apply Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) tailored to the user's anatomy for accurate 3D sound localization.
            *   Dynamically adjust the amplitude and phase of signals emitted by the directional speakers to create localized 'sweet spots' of desired sound.
            *   Implement a 'reverberation control' algorithm – subtly introduce anti-phase signals to cancel out unwanted reflections and create a more focused acoustic environment.
        *   Attenuation Signal Generation: (as per patent) – Used for noise cancellation, but integrated as *one component* of a broader sound field control system.
    3.  **Adaptive Learning:**
        *   Machine learning algorithm to learn user preferences over time.
        *   Monitor user listening habits and adjust the sound field accordingly.
        *   Optimize the performance of the system based on user feedback.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
Create Acoustic Map
Load User Profile/Preferences

// Main Loop
Capture Audio from Microphone Array
Track Head Orientation (IMU)
Localize Sound Sources
Generate Attenuation Signals (for noise)
Generate Spatial Audio Signals (HRTF, EQ, Scene)
Combine Attenuation & Spatial Signals
Output to Bone Conduction & Directional Speakers
Update Acoustic Map
Learn User Preferences
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   The LiDAR/ToF sensor isn’t strictly *necessary*, but would dramatically improve accuracy and responsiveness, particularly in complex environments.
*   Bone conduction provides private audio – the user hears their own music/podcasts/calls without disturbing others.
*   Directional speakers are used for subtle environmental adjustments – boosting speech clarity, reducing reflections, creating a sense of spaciousness.
*   The system isn't just about *blocking* sound, but about *shaping* the acoustic environment to create a more pleasant and productive listening experience.
