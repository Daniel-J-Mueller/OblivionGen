## Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & Pre-Provisioning

**Concept:** Extend the failure behavior concept to *predict* potential node failures based on real-time data and proactively pre-provision alternative communication paths *before* the failure occurs. This shifts from reactive failure handling to proactive network resilience.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Collects data from each computing node including:
        *   CPU Utilization
        *   Memory Usage
        *   Network Latency (to neighboring nodes & final destinations)
        *   Disk I/O
        *   Error Logs (system & application)
        *   Power Consumption
    *   Data collection frequency configurable per node.
*   **Predictive Analytics Engine:**
    *   Uses time-series analysis and machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA, Random Forest) to predict potential node failures.
    *   Model training: Uses historical node data and failure events. Continuously retrained based on current data.
    *   Failure prediction score: Outputs a probability score (0-1) indicating the likelihood of node failure within a configurable time window (e.g., next 5, 15, 30 minutes).
    *   Alerting Threshold: Configurable thresholds for the failure prediction score to trigger pre-provisioning.
*   **Pre-Provisioning Module:**
    *   Activated when the failure prediction score exceeds the alert threshold.
    *   Identifies alternative communication paths based on the current network topology and specified failure behavior.
    *   Establishes these alternative paths *before* the node actually fails. This could involve:
        *   Redirecting traffic through other healthy nodes.
        *   Activating redundant network interfaces.
        *   Spinning up virtual network instances.
    *   Traffic redirection based on weighted load balancing or path cost.
*   **Dynamic Topology Adaptation:**
    *   Continues monitoring the health of the predicted failing node.
    *   If the node recovers *before* failing, the pre-provisioned paths are automatically decommissioned.
    *   If the node fails, traffic seamlessly transitions to the pre-provisioned alternative path with minimal disruption.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Centralized management interface for configuring data collection frequency, prediction thresholds, alternative path selection criteria, and weighting parameters.
    *   Network topology visualization for monitoring and debugging.
    *   Automated reporting and alerting.
*   **Pseudocode (Pre-Provisioning Module):**

```
function preProvisionPath(node, predictedFailureScore, currentTopology)
  if predictedFailureScore > threshold
    alternativePaths = findAlternativePaths(node, currentTopology)
    bestPath = selectBestPath(alternativePaths, criteria: latency, cost, bandwidth)
    redirectTraffic(node, bestPath)
    monitorNode(node)
  else
    return
end
function monitorNode(node)
  while node is still up
    if node fails
      // traffic is already redirected
      return
    end
end
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond reactive failure handling and towards proactive resilience. By *predicting* failures and pre-provisioning alternative paths, it minimizes disruption and improves overall network reliability. This is especially valuable for latency-sensitive applications and critical infrastructure. The machine learning component allows the system to adapt to changing network conditions and improve prediction accuracy over time.
