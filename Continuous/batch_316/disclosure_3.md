## Dynamic Application Persona Creation & Cross-Device Workflow Anticipation

**Core Concept:** Extend application preference learning beyond individual sessions and devices. Create 'personas' representing usage patterns *across* a user’s entire digital footprint, then proactively stage workflows on anticipated devices.

**Specs:**

**1. Persona Construction Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Virtual Desktop Interaction Data (as per the provided patent)
    *   Local Device Usage Data (with user permission): application launch times, active window durations, document access patterns, keyboard/mouse activity on *any* connected device (laptop, phone, tablet). This data is anonymized/encrypted in transit and at rest.
    *   Cloud Service Integration (optional, with explicit user consent): Data from frequently used cloud applications (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace) – document creation/modification times, collaborative editing activity.
    *   Calendar Integration (optional, with explicit user consent): Event types, attendee lists, associated documents.
*   **Persona Attributes:**
    *   **Application Affinity:** Weighted score representing the user’s preference for each application.
    *   **Workflow Templates:** Sequences of application launches and document accesses commonly performed by the user.  These are built via pattern recognition on historical data.
    *   **Contextual Tags:** Metadata describing the user’s typical work contexts (e.g., “Morning Report”, “Project X Review”, “Client Communication”).
    *   **Device Affinity:**  Applications the user frequently accesses *on specific devices*.
    *   **Time-Based Behavioral Profiles:** Usage patterns categorized by time of day/week.
*   **Data Processing:** Machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks, clustering) to identify patterns and build the persona attributes.  Continuous learning – the persona is updated with each new interaction.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Granular user controls to specify data sources, enable/disable data collection, and review/modify persona attributes.

**2. Proactive Workflow Staging Module:**

*   **Device Detection:** Automatically detect devices connected to the user's network or cloud accounts.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** Determine the user's likely current activity based on:
    *   Time of day/week
    *   Calendar events
    *   Location (with user permission)
    *   Recent application usage
*   **Workflow Prediction:** Predict the most likely workflow the user will perform based on the contextual analysis and the learned persona.
*   **Pre-launch Actions:**
    *   **Virtual Desktop Pre-provisioning:** If the predicted workflow requires a virtual desktop, automatically provision a new instance or activate an existing one.
    *   **Application Pre-launch:** Launch the required applications *before* the user explicitly requests them.
    *   **Document Pre-loading:** Open the necessary documents in the appropriate applications.
    *   **Data Synchronization:** Ensure that all relevant data is synchronized across devices.
    *   **Cross-Device Handoff:** Allow the user to seamlessly continue a workflow on a different device. For example, start editing a document on a laptop, then automatically continue editing it on a tablet.
*   **User Interface:** A subtle "workflow suggestion" panel that displays predicted workflows and allows the user to accept or reject them.

**3.  System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices-Based:** Each module (Persona Construction, Proactive Workflow Staging) is implemented as a separate microservice.
*   **API-Driven:** All modules communicate via APIs.
*   **Data Storage:**  A combination of relational databases (for persona attributes) and NoSQL databases (for interaction data).
*   **Cloud-Native:**  Designed to be deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

**Pseudocode (Proactive Workflow Staging):**

```
function predict_workflow(user_id, current_context):
    persona = get_persona(user_id)
    predicted_workflow = persona.predict_next_workflow(current_context)
    return predicted_workflow

function stage_workflow(user_id, workflow):
    for app in workflow.applications:
        if app.requires_virtual_desktop:
            provision_virtual_desktop(user_id)
        launch_application(user_id, app)
        for document in app.documents:
            open_document(user_id, document, app)

on device_connect(user_id, device_id):
    current_context = get_current_context(device_id)
    predicted_workflow = predict_workflow(user_id, current_context)
    stage_workflow(user_id, predicted_workflow)
```

This system isn’t just about predicting *what* applications a user will launch, but proactively setting up the *entire* workflow before they even think about it.  It aims for true digital anticipation.
