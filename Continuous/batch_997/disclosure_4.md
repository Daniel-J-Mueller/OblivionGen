**Dynamic Attention Weighting via Multi-Modal Temporal Consistency**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Enhance temporal localization of mature (or any) content by incorporating a “temporal consistency” module that dynamically adjusts attention weights based on frame-to-frame coherence across *both* video and audio modalities. The existing patent utilizes class-agnostic attention and binary classification, this system leverages *temporal* information to refine that attention.

**II. System Architecture:**

1.  **Input:** Video file (with audio).

2.  **Feature Extraction:**
    *   **Visual Feature Extractor:**  A CNN (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) extracts frame-level visual features.
    *   **Audio Feature Extractor:** A spectrogram-based feature extractor (e.g., Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients - MFCCs) extracts frame-level audio features.

3.  **Attention Network (as in patent):**
    *   **Branch 1 (Class-Agnostic Attention):**  Calculates attention weights based on visual and audio features, as described in the original patent.
    *   **Branch 2 (Binary Classification):**  Performs binary classification to identify mature content in each frame.

4.  **Temporal Consistency Module (NEW):**
    *   **Optical Flow Estimation:**  Calculates optical flow between consecutive frames. This represents the movement of pixels over time.
    *   **Audio Event Detection:** Analyze audio for events like speech, music, or sudden sounds.
    *   **Temporal Coherence Score:** Calculate a "temporal coherence score" for each frame based on:
        *   **Visual Coherence:** The magnitude of optical flow between the current frame and the previous frame.  High flow suggests significant scene change.
        *   **Audio Coherence:** The similarity of audio events between the current frame and the previous frame.
        *   **Fusion:** Combine visual and audio coherence scores.  A weighted sum or a more complex fusion model can be used.

5.  **Dynamic Attention Weight Adjustment:**
    *   **Attention Modifier:** Multiply the attention weights from Branch 1 (class-agnostic attention) by the temporal coherence score. This *decreases* attention for frames that exhibit high scene change or audio discontinuity, effectively filtering out transient or ambiguous content.
    *   **Smoothing:** Apply a temporal smoothing filter (e.g., moving average) to the adjusted attention weights to further stabilize the system.

6.  **Final Classification:**
    *   Multiply the adjusted attention weights by the binary classification scores from Branch 2.
    *   Sum the weighted scores to obtain the frame-level mature content score.
    *   Aggregate the frame-level scores to obtain the video-level score.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
# Inputs: videoFrames, audioFrames

# Feature Extraction
visualFeatures = extractVisualFeatures(videoFrames)
audioFeatures = extractAudioFeatures(audioFrames)

# Attention Network (as in patent)
attentionWeights, binaryScores = attentionNetwork(visualFeatures, audioFeatures)

# Temporal Consistency Module
opticalFlow = calculateOpticalFlow(videoFrames)
audioEvents = detectAudioEvents(audioFrames)
temporalCoherence = calculateTemporalCoherence(opticalFlow, audioEvents)

# Dynamic Attention Weight Adjustment
adjustedAttention = attentionWeights * temporalCoherence
smoothedAttention = applyTemporalSmoothing(adjustedAttention)

# Final Classification
frameScores = smoothedAttention * binaryScores
videoScore = sum(frameScores)
```

**IV.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Optical Flow:** Use a pre-trained optical flow estimation model (e.g., RAFT) for efficiency.
*   **Audio Event Detection:** Utilize a pre-trained audio event detection model (e.g., YAMNet) for accurate event classification.
*   **Training:** Train the entire system end-to-end using a loss function that combines mature content classification accuracy with temporal consistency regularization.  The regularization term encourages the system to assign higher attention weights to temporally coherent frames.
*   **Hardware:** GPU acceleration is recommended for both training and inference.
