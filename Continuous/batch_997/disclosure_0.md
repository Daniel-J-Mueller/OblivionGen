## Adaptive Resource Proxies & Ephemeral Security Domains

**Specification:** A system to dynamically construct isolated, ephemeral security domains around resources accessed via virtual machines, leveraging adaptive resource proxies.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of creating a “shadow user” *within* a target external security domain, create a micro-segment – an *entire* proxy environment – around the resource itself. This isolates the resource from the external domain entirely, drastically reducing the attack surface and complexity of permission management.  The VM user interacts with the proxy, which then, and only then, accesses the real resource.

**Components:**

*   **Resource Proxy Generator (RPG):**  A service responsible for rapidly deploying and configuring resource proxies. Accepts a resource identifier and access policies as input.
*   **Ephemeral Proxy Instances (EPIs):**  Lightweight, containerized instances acting as intermediaries. Each EPI is created on-demand for a specific VM session and resource access.  Uses technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, or similar container orchestration platforms.
*   **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):**  Integrated into the EPI, PEP strictly enforces access policies defined by the original security domain and translated into the EPI’s context.
*   **Credential Bridging Module (CBM):** Responsible for securely forwarding and translating user credentials from the VM’s original security domain to the EPI. Utilizes secure tunnels and authentication protocols (OAuth, SAML).
*   **Dynamic Access Control List (DACL) Manager:**  A service that creates and manages DACLs for each EPI, based on the user’s credentials and the resource being accessed.

**Workflow:**

1.  **User Request:** User attempts to access a resource via a VM.
2.  **Credential Bridging:** The CBM securely transmits the user’s credentials to the RPG.
3.  **Proxy Creation:** The RPG generates a new EPI tailored to the resource and user access policies.  The EPI is completely isolated within its own network segment.
4.  **Policy Application:**  The DACL Manager dynamically configures the EPI’s access controls based on the translated credentials and resource.
5.  **Resource Access:** The VM connects to the EPI instead of the actual resource. The EPI then authenticates with the real resource (if required) using its own credentials (managed securely).
6.  **Session Termination:** Upon user logout or VM shutdown, the EPI is destroyed. All associated data and credentials are wiped.

**Pseudocode (RPG - Simplified):**

```
function create_ephemeral_proxy(resource_id, user_credentials, access_policies):
    container_image = select_base_image(resource_type) // e.g., web server, database
    container = launch_container(container_image)
    configure_network_isolation(container)
    install_PEP(container, access_policies)
    configure_resource_access(container, resource_id)
    return container_ip_address
```

**Innovation:**

This approach moves beyond the limitations of traditional "shadow user" models.  Instead of trusting an external security domain, it *circumvents* it by creating a secure, disposable intermediary. This reduces the risk of credential theft, privilege escalation, and lateral movement attacks.  It's especially relevant in multi-tenant environments and when accessing sensitive data from untrusted sources. This allows for fine-grained, ephemeral control. The system should be capable of 'chaining' proxies for particularly sensitive resources, adding layers of isolation.
