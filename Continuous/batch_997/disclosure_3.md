## Dynamic Narrative Stitching from Multi-Stream Media

**Concept:** Extend the compelling clip selection process to leverage multiple simultaneous media streams (e.g., primary video, secondary camera angles, sensor data, social media feeds) to dynamically construct a more engaging narrative. This goes beyond simply selecting 'good' clips from a single source; it *creates* a new, cohesive experience by intelligently stitching together fragments from diverse inputs.

**Specs:**

*   **Input Streams:** System accepts N concurrent media streams. Each stream is time-synchronized (using established techniques like NTP or internal clock synchronization). Streams can be video, audio, sensor data (e.g., heart rate, accelerometer), or text-based feeds (e.g., Twitter, chat logs).
*   **Index Granularity:** Indices are created not just for the primary video, but for *each* input stream.  This yields a multi-dimensional index structure. Each index point contains timestamp information relative to a global timeline.
*   **Attribute Scoring – Expanded:** Attribute scoring now considers attributes relevant to *cross-stream* relationships.  Examples:
    *   *Synchronization Score:*  How well an index point from one stream aligns with emotional or action peaks in another.
    *   *Complementarity Score:* Does a secondary stream provide clarifying information or a different perspective on an event in the primary stream? (Calculated using visual/audio analysis or semantic understanding).
    *   *Contrast Score:* Does a stream offer a contrasting viewpoint or emotional state? (Useful for building tension or highlighting dramatic irony).
*   **Compelling-ness Weighting – Dynamic:**  Weights for attributes are not static.  A “Narrative Director” module adjusts weights *during* clip selection based on the desired “story arc.” Options:
    *   *Excitement Focus:* Emphasize action, fast cuts, and high emotional peaks.
    *   *Introspection Focus:*  Prioritize slower moments, revealing facial expressions, and dialogue.
    *   *Mystery Focus:* Select clips that introduce unanswered questions or conflicting information.
*   **Stitching Algorithm:**
    1.  Identify ‘anchor’ indices – points of high compelling-ness in the primary stream.
    2.  Search for complementary/contrasting indices in other streams within a specified temporal window around the anchor.
    3.  Rank potential ‘stitch points’ based on weighted attribute scores.
    4.  Apply a ‘coherence filter’ to ensure smooth transitions. This may involve:
        *   Cross-dissolves
        *   Jump cuts masked by motion graphics
        *   Audio ducking/mixing
        *   Automated color correction to match streams
    5.  Output a new, multi-stream “compelling narrative” – a cohesive video sequence constructed from fragments across all input sources.
*   **User Interface:**  A visual editor allowing users to:
    *   Select input streams
    *   Define desired narrative arc (using pre-defined profiles or custom weightings)
    *   Manually adjust stitch points
    *   Preview and refine the final output.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Stitching):**

```
function stitch_streams(primary_stream, secondary_streams, narrative_arc):
  anchor_indices = find_high_compelling_indices(primary_stream)
  final_clip_list = []

  for anchor in anchor_indices:
    best_secondary_clip = None
    highest_score = -1

    for stream in secondary_streams:
      secondary_clips = find_clips_near(stream, anchor.timestamp)
      for clip in secondary_clips:
        score = calculate_compelling_score(clip, anchor, narrative_arc)
        if score > highest_score:
          highest_score = score
          best_secondary_clip = clip

    if best_secondary_clip:
      # Blend/Transition between anchor and best_secondary_clip
      blended_clip = create_transition(anchor, best_secondary_clip)
      final_clip_list.append(blended_clip)
    else:
      final_clip_list.append(anchor) #Use anchor only if no good secondary clip

  return final_clip_list
