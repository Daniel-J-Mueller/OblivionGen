## Variable Buoyancy Drone Swarm with Integrated Stereoscopic Vision

**System Overview:** A drone swarm utilizing dynamically adjustable buoyancy control alongside traditional propulsion, coupled with distributed stereoscopic vision derived from blade-integrated cameras (building upon the core concept of the provided patent). The swarm is designed for sub-surface environment mapping, inspection, and manipulation with a focus on complex, confined spaces.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Drone Unit:**
    *   Dimensions: 15cm x 15cm x 10cm (approximate)
    *   Weight: 500g (without ballast)
    *   Propulsion: Four ducted fans providing thrust in X, Y, Z and rotational axes.
    *   Buoyancy Control: Internal ballast tanks utilizing compressed gas (Nitrogen or Helium) and micro-pumps.  Tank volume: 200cc. Pressure Range: 0-200psi.  Resolution: 1cc increments.
    *   Imaging System:  Two blade-integrated cameras per drone (similar to patent concept). Resolution: 12MP. Frame Rate: 60fps. Field of View: 90 degrees.  Stereo Baseline: 10cm (blade length dependent).
    *   Onboard Computer: NVIDIA Jetson Nano (or equivalent). Processing power sufficient for real-time image processing, SLAM, and control algorithms.
    *   Communication: Underwater Acoustic Communication (UAC) module. Range: 100m. Data Rate: 10kbps. Mesh networking capability.
    *   Power: Lithium-ion battery pack. Capacity: 5000mAh. Estimated operational time: 60 minutes. Wireless charging capability at base station.
    *   Materials: Lightweight composite materials (carbon fiber, fiberglass) for hull and blades. Corrosion-resistant coatings.

*   **Base Station:**
    *   UAC transceiver.
    *   Drone charging/docking station.
    *   High-performance computer for swarm data processing and visualization.
    *   Operator interface (GUI).

**Software Architecture:**

*   **Swarm Control Algorithm:**  Decentralized consensus-based control.  Each drone maintains local awareness of its environment and communicates with neighboring drones to achieve a global objective. Algorithm incorporates:
    *   **Collision Avoidance:** Utilizing sensor fusion of camera data and UAC communication.
    *   **Path Planning:**  A* search algorithm modified for underwater environments. Considers buoyancy control as a degree of freedom.
    *   **Dynamic Task Allocation:**  Assigns tasks (mapping, inspection, manipulation) to individual drones based on their location and capabilities.
*   **Stereoscopic Vision Processing:**
    *   **Real-time Stereo Matching:**  Utilizing a semi-global matching algorithm optimized for underwater visibility conditions.
    *   **3D Reconstruction:** Generating point clouds and mesh models of the environment.
    *   **Object Recognition:**  Employing deep learning models trained to identify objects of interest (e.g., cracks, corrosion, anomalies).
*   **Buoyancy Control Module:**
    *   PID control loop for maintaining desired depth and orientation.
    *   Dynamic buoyancy adjustment based on environmental conditions (e.g., currents, turbulence).
    *   Integration with path planning algorithm to optimize energy consumption.
*   **Data Fusion and Visualization:**
    *   Combining data from multiple drones to create a comprehensive 3D map of the environment.
    *   Real-time visualization of data using a GUI.
    *   Data logging and analysis tools.

**Operational Procedure (Example: Pipeline Inspection):**

1.  Deploy swarm near the pipeline entry point.
2.  Swarm autonomously navigates along the pipeline using a pre-defined path or real-time SLAM.
3.  Blade-integrated cameras capture stereoscopic images of the pipeline surface.
4.  Onboard computers process images to detect cracks, corrosion, and other anomalies.
5.  Data is transmitted to the base station for further analysis and visualization.
6.  Swarm autonomously returns to the base station for recharging and data offloading.

**Pseudocode (Buoyancy Control):**

```
// Variables:
desiredDepth (float)
currentDepth (float)
buoyancyLevel (float) // 0.0 to 1.0 (min to max buoyancy)
kp, ki, kd (PID constants)
error, integral, derivative (PID variables)

// Function: AdjustBuoyancy()
error = desiredDepth - currentDepth
integral = integral + error * deltaTime
derivative = (error - previousError) / deltaTime
buoyancyLevel = kp * error + ki * integral + kd * derivative

// Constrain buoyancyLevel to 0.0-1.0
if buoyancyLevel > 1.0:
  buoyancyLevel = 1.0
if buoyancyLevel < 0.0:
  buoyancyLevel = 0.0

// Command micro-pump to adjust ballast tank pressure based on buoyancyLevel
sendCommand(pumpID, buoyancyLevel * maxPumpPressure)

previousError = error
