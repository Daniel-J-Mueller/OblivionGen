## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Spatial Audio Projection

**Concept:** Expand the multi-device audio capture system to actively create and manipulate localized acoustic zones within a space, projecting spatial audio directly to individual users. Move beyond simple voice capture to dynamic audio environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Enhanced Earbuds:** Maintain existing microphone arrays. Add micro-haptic transducers for localized feedback (e.g., directional ‘buzz’ indicating zone edge).
*   **Zone Projectors:** Small, directional speakers (integrated into existing devices or separate units) capable of beamforming and precise audio projection. Minimum 8 units per standard room.
*   **Spatial Mapping Unit:**  A low-power, wide-angle camera system (integrated into a central hub or mobile device) for real-time 3D mapping of the environment and user positions.
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** High-performance processor for real-time audio processing, spatial mapping, and zone management. Can be integrated into existing mobile device or dedicated hub.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Zone Definition Module:** Allows users to define acoustic zones via app interface or voice command. Zones can be static (e.g., “living room”) or dynamic (e.g., following a user).
*   **Audio Source Management:**  Module identifies and classifies audio sources (speech, music, environmental noise) using machine learning.
*   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:**  Utilizes head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and beamforming techniques to render spatial audio accurately within defined zones.
*   **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:** Algorithm continuously monitors user positions and adjusts zone boundaries and audio projection parameters in real-time.
*   **Acoustic Mapping:** Creates an acoustic 'fingerprint' of the environment, identifying reflective surfaces and potential interference.
*   **Noise Cancellation/Enhancement Profiles:** Individual profiles per zone, allowing for adaptive noise cancellation/enhancement tailored to the environment.

**3. Operational Procedure (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
SpatialMap = CreateSpatialMap()
ZoneList = []

// User defines zone "living room"
Zone = CreateZone("living room", SpatialMap)
ZoneList.append(Zone)

// User defines "follow me" zone
FollowMeZone = CreateFollowMeZone(CurrentUserPosition, SpatialMap)
FollowMeZone.Anchor = CurrentUserPosition
ZoneList.append(FollowMeZone)

// Real-time loop:

While (SystemRunning) {

    UpdateSpatialMap()  // using camera and sensor data
    UpdateUserPositions() // track user movements

    For Each Zone In ZoneList {
        Zone.RecalculateBoundary(SpatialMap, UserPositions)
        Zone.IdentifyAudioSources()
        Zone.RenderSpatialAudio(UserPositions)
        Zone.ProjectAudio(ZoneProjectors)
    }

    If (FollowMeZone.Anchor != CurrentUserPosition) {
        FollowMeZone.Anchor = CurrentUserPosition
        FollowMeZone.RecalculateBoundary(SpatialMap, UserPositions)
    }

}
```

**4. Functionality Enhancement:**

*   **Directional Notifications:** Deliver notifications audibly only to the user within a specific zone.
*   **Privacy Zones:**  Create audio “bubbles” around users to prevent eavesdropping.
*   **Immersive Gaming/VR Integration:** Enhance VR/AR experiences with precise spatial audio cues.
*   **Adaptive Soundscaping:** Automatically adjust ambient audio based on user activity and environment.  E.g., quiet music during work, nature sounds during relaxation.
*   **Multi-User Collaboration:**  Enable localized audio conferencing within a shared space.  Each user’s voice is projected specifically to other attendees in their zone.
