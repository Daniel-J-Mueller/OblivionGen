## Delegated Policy Inheritance & Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the delegated administrator concept by introducing policy inheritance *beyond* simple intersection. Allow delegated administrators to establish "trust relationships" with external entities (other organizations, specific service providers) and dynamically inherit permissions based on a trust score. This moves beyond static boundaries and enables conditional access.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Trust Broker Service (TBS) - A central service responsible for managing trust relationships, calculating trust scores, and mediating permission inheritance.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `TrustRelationship`:  { `DelegatedAdminID`, `ExternalEntityID`, `TrustScore`, `PolicyInheritanceRules` }
    *   `PolicyInheritanceRules`: { `ActionPattern`, `ResourcePattern`, `InheritanceWeight` } – Defines which permissions are inherited and how strongly, based on matching patterns.  `InheritanceWeight` is a float between 0.0 and 1.0.
    *   `ExternalEntityID`: Unique identifier for external organizations or services. This could leverage existing identity providers (SAML, OpenID Connect).
*   **API Endpoints (TBS):**
    *   `POST /trust`:  Create a new trust relationship.  Parameters: `DelegatedAdminID`, `ExternalEntityID`, `InitialTrustScore`.
    *   `PUT /trust/{trustID}`:  Update trust score and/or inheritance rules.  Parameters: `TrustScore`, `PolicyInheritanceRules`.
    *   `GET /trust/{trustID}`: Retrieve trust relationship details.
    *   `GET /trust/score/{delegatedAdminID}/{externalEntityID}`: Retrieve current trust score.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  A delegated administrator establishes a trust relationship with an external entity via the TBS.  An initial trust score is assigned.
    2.  The IAM service receives a request from a user (managed by the delegated administrator).
    3.  Before evaluating permissions, the IAM service queries the TBS for trust relationships involving the delegated administrator and the resource being accessed (or the provider of the service).
    4.  For each matching trust relationship:
        *   Retrieve the trust score and policy inheritance rules.
        *   Evaluate the inheritance rules against the requested action and resource.
        *   Calculate an "inherited permission weight" based on the trust score and the inheritance weight.
    5.  Combine the user’s base permissions with the inherited permissions, weighted by the inherited permission weight. This creates a dynamic, context-aware permission evaluation.
    6.  If the combined permission score exceeds a threshold, the action is allowed. Otherwise, it is denied.

**Pseudocode (IAM Service – Permission Evaluation):**

```
function evaluatePermission(user, action, resource):
  basePermission = getUserBasePermission(user, action, resource)
  inheritedPermissions = []
  trustRelationships = TrustBroker.getTrustRelationships(user.delegatedAdminID, resource)

  for each trustRelationship in trustRelationships:
    inheritanceRules = trustRelationship.PolicyInheritanceRules
    for each rule in inheritanceRules:
      if (action matches rule.ActionPattern) and (resource matches rule.ResourcePattern):
        inheritedPermissionWeight = trustRelationship.TrustScore * rule.InheritanceWeight
        inheritedPermissions.append((rule.Permission, inheritedPermissionWeight))

  combinedPermissionScore = basePermission + sum(permissionWeight for permission, permissionWeight in inheritedPermissions)

  if combinedPermissionScore >= permissionThreshold:
    return ALLOW
  else:
    return DENY
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond static permission boundaries to a dynamic trust-based system. Enables fine-grained access control based on relationships and allows delegated administrators to extend trust to external entities while maintaining central control. Addresses scenarios where organizations need to collaborate securely without sharing full administrative access.  The dynamic scoring system introduces adaptability to changing trust levels.
