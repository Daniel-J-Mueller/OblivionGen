## Acoustic Mapping & Predictive Device Control

**Core Concept:** Leverage the microphone array and distance calculations *not* just for localization, but for creating a dynamic acoustic map of the room and *predicting* user intent based on sound events *before* a command is fully spoken. This moves beyond reactive control to proactive assistance.

**System Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** (Minimum 4, optimally 8+) Embedded in the multi-device controller. High sensitivity, wide frequency response.
*   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:** Software module running on the common connection device. Processes microphone data.
*   **Sound Event Database:**  A pre-trained machine learning model identifying common sounds (TV static, game console startup, door closing, specific music genres, human speech patterns). Expandable via user training.
*   **Predictive Intent Engine:** ML model correlating sound events with likely device actions. Uses historical user data & contextual information (time of day, active devices, room occupancy).
*   **Device Action Library:** Database mapping predicted intents to specific device control commands (IR codes, network requests).
*   **Low-Latency IR/Network Transmitter:** Integrated into the multi-device controller. 
*   **Realtime Feedback System:** Utilizing the microphone array and audio signal processing, provides feedback to the predictive intent engine to improve accuracy.

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Continuous Acoustic Monitoring:**  The microphone array continuously captures ambient audio.  Data is pre-processed (noise reduction, beamforming) on the common connection device.
2.  **Sound Event Identification:** The Acoustic Mapping Engine analyzes the audio stream, identifying and categorizing sound events.
3.  **Intent Prediction:** The Predictive Intent Engine uses the identified sound events, combined with historical user data, contextual awareness, and active device states to *predict* the user's next action. (e.g., detects TV static + faint game audio -> predicts user wants to turn on the game console and switch TV input).
4.  **Proactive Control:**  If the confidence level of the predicted intent exceeds a threshold, the system *automatically* sends the corresponding control signal(s) to the relevant devices.
5.  **User Confirmation/Override:** A short “confirmation window” exists. If the user says a clarifying command (e.g., “no, not the game console”), the system cancels the automatic action. Alternatively, a visual prompt appears on a connected display.
6.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns from user interactions (confirmations, overrides, manual commands) to refine the accuracy of the Predictive Intent Engine.

**Pseudocode - Intent Prediction Logic:**

```
function predictIntent(soundEvents, historicalData, context) {
  // 1. Feature Extraction: Convert soundEvents, historicalData, and context into a feature vector.
  featureVector = createFeatureVector(soundEvents, historicalData, context);

  // 2. Intent Scoring:  Use a trained machine learning model (e.g., neural network) to score potential intents.
  intentScores = model.predict(featureVector);

  // 3. Intent Filtering: Filter out low-probability intents.
  filteredIntents = filterByThreshold(intentScores, confidenceThreshold);

  // 4. Disambiguation (if multiple intents remain):
  if (filteredIntents.length > 1) {
    //Use contextual data (time of day, current device states) to prioritize intents
    prioritizedIntents = prioritizeIntents(filteredIntents, context);
    return prioritizedIntents[0]; // Return the highest-priority intent
  } else {
    return filteredIntents[0]; // Return the predicted intent
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simply *reacting* to voice commands. It aims to anticipate user needs based on environmental cues and learned behavior, providing a truly seamless and proactive control experience. The system isn’t waiting for a command, it's anticipating it.
