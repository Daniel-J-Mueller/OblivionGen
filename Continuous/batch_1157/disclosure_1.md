## Automated Micro-Fluidic Sample Preparation & Analysis Module

**Concept:** Integrate the sample collection device with a miniature, self-contained microfluidic lab-on-a-chip module for immediate, automated sample processing and analysis *within* the collection device housing. This moves beyond simply delivering a sample *to* a PCR tube, and instead performs pre-PCR steps like cell separation, nucleic acid extraction, and quantification *in situ*.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing:**  A robust, palm-sized housing (approx. 10cm x 5cm x 3cm) containing the sample collection mechanism (swab & container as per provided patent), the microfluidic module, a small battery, and a wireless communication module (Bluetooth/WiFi).

*   **Microfluidic Module:**
    *   **Material:**  Polymer-based microfluidic chip with integrated channels, chambers, and actuators.
    *   **Channels:** A network of microchannels connecting the swab/collection chamber to various functional chambers.
    *   **Actuators:**  Micro-pumps (e.g., peristaltic, electroosmotic) for fluid control, and micro-valves for directing flow.
    *   **Functional Chambers:**
        *   **Cell Separation Chamber:** Utilizing size exclusion or immunoaffinity to isolate target cells (if applicable).
        *   **Lysis Chamber:**  Releasing cellular contents via chemical or mechanical lysis.
        *   **Nucleic Acid Extraction Chamber:** Utilizing solid-phase extraction (SPE) beads within a micro-chamber for automated DNA/RNA purification.
        *   **Quantification Chamber:** Integrated micro-spectrophotometer or fluorescence reader for measuring nucleic acid concentration.
        *   **PCR Reaction Chamber:** Miniature chamber pre-loaded with lyophilized master mix, directly connected to the extraction/quantification stages.

*   **Swab & Container Integration:** The swab/container assembly from the original patent is modified:
    *   The 'micro sample chamber' is directly interfaced with the microfluidic chip’s inlet.
    *   The metering piston’s actuation is integrated with the microfluidic module’s control system.
    *   A small, integrated sensor detects the successful transfer of sample from the swab to the microfluidic chip.

*   **Control System:** A microcontroller manages the entire process:
    *   Metering piston actuation
    *   Micro-pump and valve control
    *   Sensor data acquisition
    *   Wireless communication

*   **Operation:**
    1.  User collects sample via swab.
    2.  Swab inserted into container, activating the metering piston and transferring sample to the microfluidic chip.
    3.  Control system initiates automated processing: cell separation, lysis, nucleic acid extraction, quantification.
    4.  Processed sample loaded directly into the PCR reaction chamber.
    5.  PCR amplification initiated (either within the device with a miniaturized thermocycler or by wirelessly triggering an external device).
    6.  Results transmitted wirelessly to a smartphone/computer.
