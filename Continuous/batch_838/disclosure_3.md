## Dynamic Projection Mapping Display

**Concept:** A product display utilizing a skeletal framework with integrated, dynamically adjustable fabric panels, coupled with a high-resolution, short-throw projector system and real-time projection mapping. The display isn't *showing* a product, but *becoming* the product through light and shape-shifting fabric.

**Specs:**

*   **Framework:** Lightweight, modular aluminum alloy skeleton. Dimensions scalable from tabletop to full-size human. Modular sections connect via quick-release magnetic joints. Internal cable management for power and data.
*   **Fabric Panels:** Stretchable, matte white fabric stretched over a network of small, individually-controlled pneumatic actuators. Actuators create subtle surface deformations, allowing the fabric to simulate texture, form, and even *motion*. Panel density: 50 actuators per square foot. Material: High-tenacity polyester with a specialized coating to maximize projection clarity.
*   **Projection System:** Multiple (minimum 3) high-resolution, short-throw laser projectors positioned around the display. Resolution: 4K per projector.  Brightness: 5000 lumens per projector.  Keystone correction and edge blending software integrated for seamless image.
*   **Control System:** Real-time processing unit (GPU-accelerated) running custom projection mapping software.  Software allows for:
    *   Import of 3D models of products.
    *   Automated generation of projection mapping based on 3D model.
    *   Manual adjustment of projection and fabric deformation.
    *   Integration with external data sources (e.g., real-time pricing, inventory).
*   **Actuator Control:**  Individual pneumatic actuators controlled via a microcontroller network.  Control parameters: pressure, timing, and sequence. Software allows for pre-programmed motion sequences and real-time adjustment based on projection mapping.
*   **Power:** External power supply with sufficient wattage for projectors, actuators, and control system. Internal power distribution network.
*   **Software API:** Open API allowing developers to create custom content and applications for the display.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize system
Initialize() {
    Connect to projectors;
    Connect to actuator network;
    Load system configuration;
}

// Load product data
LoadProduct(product_model_file, texture_file) {
    Load 3D model from file;
    Load texture map from file;
    Generate projection mapping based on model and projector positions;
    Generate actuator deformation pattern based on model surface;
}

// Update display
UpdateDisplay() {
    For each projector:
        Project mapped image onto display;
    For each actuator:
        Set pressure based on deformation pattern;
}

// Real-time adjustment
AdjustDisplay(parameter, value) {
    If (parameter == "brightness"):
        Adjust projector brightness;
    If (parameter == "texture"):
        Modify texture map and re-generate projection mapping;
    If (parameter == "deformation"):
        Modify deformation pattern and re-activate actuators;
}
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simply displaying an image *of* a product. It *becomes* the product, creating a fully immersive and dynamic experience. The shape-shifting fabric adds a tactile dimension that static displays lack.  Itâ€™s adaptable, customizable, and capable of creating entirely new forms of product presentation.
