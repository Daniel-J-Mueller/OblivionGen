## Adaptive Spectral Remapping with Dynamic Filter Array Control

**Concept:** Integrate the image sensor’s color filter array (CFA) with a micro-lens array and electronically controllable spectral filters to dynamically reshape the spectral response of each pixel *before* light reaches the sensor. This allows for real-time adaptation to varying lighting conditions and scene content, surpassing the limitations of fixed CFAs.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Core:** Standard CMOS image sensor with a Bayer or similar CFA structure.
*   **Micro-Lens Array (MLA):** High-density MLA placed *above* the CFA, designed to focus light onto individual sensor pixels. Each microlens is individually addressable via electrostatic or MEMS control.
*   **Tunable Spectral Filters:**  Thin-film interference filters or liquid crystal tunable filters (LCTF) integrated *beneath* the MLA, directly above each pixel. Each filter’s spectral transmission can be dynamically adjusted. Resolution: 256 discrete steps per channel (Red, Green, Blue, IR).
*   **Control System:** Real-time image processing pipeline running on dedicated hardware (FPGA or ASIC).
*   **Calibration Data:** Pre-calculated look-up tables (LUTs) mapping scene conditions (ambient light spectrum, object reflectance) to optimal filter settings.
*   **Power Budget:** Must maintain standard CMOS sensor power consumption levels. Max additional 20% power usage.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Scene Analysis:**  The control system analyzes the incoming light using a preliminary spectral estimation (from a few dedicated spectral sensors integrated in the system).
2.  **Spectral Mapping:** Based on scene analysis and pre-calculated LUTs, the control system determines the optimal spectral transmission curve for each pixel.  This curve maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio for the specific objects/materials in the scene.
3.  **Filter Control:** The control system sends signals to the tunable spectral filters, adjusting their transmission curves.
4.  **Microlens Alignment:** The microlenses are dynamically adjusted to align light with the corresponding spectral filters, maximizing efficiency.
5.  **Image Acquisition:** The image sensor captures the image data.
6.  **Data Reconstruction:** Standard demosaicing and color space conversion algorithms are used to generate the final image.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Initialize LUTs based on pre-characterization of sensor and filters
LUT = LoadLUT();

loop:
    // Capture raw spectral data from auxiliary sensors
    SpectralData = ReadAuxSensors();

    // Estimate scene properties (lighting, reflectance)
    SceneProperties = AnalyzeSpectralData(SpectralData);

    // Determine optimal filter settings for each pixel
    for each pixel:
        FilterSettings[pixel] = LookupFilterSettings(SceneProperties, LUT, pixel);

    // Apply filter settings
    ApplyFilterSettings(FilterSettings);

    // Adjust microlens alignment
    AdjustMicrolensAlignment(FilterSettings);

    // Acquire image data
    ImageData = AcquireImageData();

    // Process image data (demosaicing, color conversion)
    FinalImage = ProcessImageData(ImageData);

    // Output FinalImage

```

**Innovation & Potential:**

*   **Enhanced Dynamic Range:**  Dynamically adjust spectral response to capture details in both highlights and shadows.
*   **Improved Color Accuracy:** Capture more accurate colors under varying lighting conditions.
*   **Material Identification:**  Identify materials based on their spectral signatures.
*   **Hyperspectral Imaging:** Approximates hyperspectral imaging with limited bandwidth by focusing narrow spectral bands.
*   **Low-Light Performance:** Optimize spectral response to maximize light capture in low-light conditions.
