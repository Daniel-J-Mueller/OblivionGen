## Dynamic Acoustic Mapping & Projection

**Concept:** Augment the device's cylindrical form factor with localized sound projection and acoustic mapping capabilities. This creates a spatially aware “sound bubble” around the device, allowing for directed audio and interactive acoustic experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing Modification:** Integrate an array of micro-speakers (minimum 32, preferably 64+) into the cylindrical housing. Speakers are positioned with varied angles of projection. Housing material must allow for optimized sound transmission, potentially utilizing a layered construction of differing densities.
*   **Microphone Array Enhancement:** Expand the existing microphone array to include beamforming capabilities. Minimum 8 microphones, positioned for 360-degree coverage.
*   **Acoustic Mapping System:** Implement a real-time acoustic mapping system utilizing the microphone array and a dedicated processing unit. This system generates a 3D model of the surrounding acoustic environment, identifying surfaces, obstacles, and sound reflections.
*   **Directed Audio Beamforming:** Develop software algorithms to dynamically shape and direct audio beams from the micro-speaker array. This allows for focused audio projection to specific locations in space. Parameters include:
    *   Beam Width: Adjustable from narrow (highly focused) to wide (diffuse).
    *   Beam Steering: Controlled by software, allowing for dynamic tracking of a target's position.
    *   Frequency Shaping: Ability to emphasize or attenuate specific frequencies within the audio beam.
*   **Interactive Acoustic Features:** Implement the following interactive features:
    *   **Personalized Sound Zones:** Create localized sound zones for individual users, allowing them to hear audio without disturbing others.
    *   **Acoustic Haptics:** Simulate tactile sensations through focused sound waves. (e.g., simulate a “touch” on the user’s skin).
    *   **Spatial Audio Effects:** Create immersive spatial audio experiences by manipulating sound reflections and delays.
    *   **Acoustic Object Tracking:** Identify and track the movement of acoustic objects (e.g., a voice, a musical instrument).
*   **Pseudocode (Acoustic Mapping):**

    ```
    // Initialize microphone array and acoustic model
    initializeMicrophoneArray()
    initializeAcousticModel()

    while (true) {
        // Capture audio data from microphone array
        audioData = captureAudio()

        // Process audio data to identify sound sources and reflections
        soundSources, reflections = analyzeAudio(audioData)

        // Update acoustic model based on analyzed data
        updateAcousticModel(soundSources, reflections)

        // Generate 3D acoustic map
        acousticMap = generateAcousticMap(acousticModel)

        // Output acoustic map data (for visualization or further processing)
        outputAcousticMap(acousticMap)
    }
    ```

*   **Power Requirements:** Increased power consumption due to additional speakers and processing unit. Require a high-capacity battery and efficient power management algorithms.
*   **Materials:** Housing construction should incorporate sound-dampening and sound-reflecting materials to optimize acoustic performance.
* **Integration with existing components**: Utilize the existing camera and depth sensor to refine the acoustic model with visual data, allowing for more accurate sound source localization and obstacle avoidance.
