## Dynamic Identity Federation with Predictive Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the identity migration concept to a continuous, dynamic federation model. Instead of a one-time copy and switch, continuously synchronize identity data *and* associated trust scores between organizations. Implement a predictive trust model that proactively assesses risk and adjusts authentication requirements in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Synchronization Protocol:**  A bi-directional, near real-time synchronization protocol (based on WebSockets or gRPC) for identity data and trust scores.  Updates are versioned and cryptographically signed to ensure integrity.
*   **Trust Score Components:**  Trust score calculation incorporates multiple factors:
    *   **Historical Authentication Success Rate:**  Based on past login attempts.
    *   **Device Reputation:**  Tracking device characteristics (hardware, OS, browser) and flagging anomalies.
    *   **Behavioral Biometrics:**  Analyzing login patterns (typing speed, mouse movements).
    *   **Geolocation Data:**  Comparing login location to expected user location.
    *   **Threat Intelligence Feeds:**  Integrating data from external threat intelligence sources (e.g., known malicious IP addresses).
*   **Predictive Trust Model:**  Employ a machine learning model (e.g., a Gradient Boosted Tree or a Recurrent Neural Network) trained on historical data to predict the likelihood of fraudulent activity.  The model outputs a trust score between 0 and 1.
*   **Dynamic Authentication Requirements:**  Authentication requirements are adjusted dynamically based on the trust score:
    *   **High Trust (0.8-1.0):**  Transparent authentication (no additional challenges).
    *   **Medium Trust (0.5-0.8):**  Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with a low-friction method (e.g., push notification).
    *   **Low Trust (0.0-0.5):**  Strong MFA with multiple factors (e.g., OTP, biometric verification) and potential account lockout.
*   **Federated Trust Graph:** Maintain a graph database representing the relationships between users, organizations, and trust scores. This allows for transitive trust relationships (e.g., trusting a user based on the trust placed in the organization they belong to).
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/trustscore/{userId}`: Retrieve the trust score for a given user.
    *   `/federatedTrust/{userId}`: Retrieve the aggregated trust score from federated organizations.
    *   `/updateTrustScore/{userId}`:  Allows organizations to contribute to the trust score calculation.
*   **Pseudocode - Trust Score Aggregation:**

```
function aggregateTrustScore(userId) {
    local trustScores = []
    for each org in federatedOrganizations {
        score = org.getTrustScore(userId)
        trustScores.append(score)
    }

    // Weighted average of trust scores (weights configurable per organization)
    totalWeight = sum(weights)
    weightedSum = sum(score * weight for score, weight in zip(trustScores, weights))

    aggregatedScore = weightedSum / totalWeight

    return aggregatedScore
}
```

*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   End-to-end encryption of all communication.
    *   Secure storage of trust data.
    *   Regular security audits.
    *   Implementation of rate limiting and intrusion detection systems.
