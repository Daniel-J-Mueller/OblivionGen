## Dynamic Constraint Field Projection

**Concept:** Instead of a static or segmented constraint map derived from obstacle data, project a dynamic "constraint field" that anticipates potential AMD movement and adjusts constraint regions *proactively*. This moves beyond simply identifying areas to avoid or permit stopping, and toward influencing *how* the AMD navigates.

**Specs:**

1.  **Input Data:**
    *   Obstacle Map (as in the provided patent) – represents static obstacles.
    *   AMD Velocity Vector – current speed and direction.
    *   AMD Turning Radius – minimum achievable turn radius.
    *   Goal Location – desired destination.
    *   Historical Trajectory Data – record of previous AMD movement patterns.

2.  **Projection Algorithm:**
    *   **Trajectory Prediction:** Using the velocity vector, turning radius, and goal location, predict several possible AMD trajectories over a short time horizon (e.g., 3-5 seconds). Use historical trajectory data to weight these predictions – more likely paths are given higher probability.
    *   **Constraint Field Generation:** For each predicted trajectory segment:
        *   Project a "risk volume" extending from the trajectory line, proportional to AMD velocity and turning radius. This represents the area the AMD could realistically occupy.
        *   Identify obstacles intersecting the risk volume.
        *   Assign a “constraint value” to each point within the risk volume, reflecting the severity of the obstacle intersection (distance to obstacle, obstacle size, etc.).
        *   Smooth the constraint values using a Gaussian filter to create a continuous constraint field.
    *   **Dynamic Constraint Map:** Overlay the constraint fields generated from all predicted trajectories.  The resulting map represents a dynamic assessment of navigable space, taking into account the AMD’s intended movement.

3.  **Constraint Region Definition:**
    *   Apply thresholding to the dynamic constraint map to define constraint regions:
        *   **High Constraint (Red Zone):** Areas with high constraint values – immediate obstacles, areas requiring rapid deceleration, or sharp turns.  Prohibit stopping and aggressively guide away.
        *   **Medium Constraint (Yellow Zone):** Areas with moderate constraint values – potential obstacles, areas where slowing down is recommended.  Encourage deceleration and path adjustments.
        *   **Low Constraint (Green Zone):** Areas with low constraint values – clear paths, areas where the AMD can maintain speed.  Allow for direct movement.

4.  **Integration with AMD Control System:**
    *   Feed the dynamic constraint map into the AMD's path planning and control algorithms.
    *   Use the constraint values to influence:
        *   Path Selection: Favor paths with lower constraint values.
        *   Speed Control: Adjust speed based on constraint values – slow down in high-constraint areas.
        *   Steering Angle:  Adjust steering angle to avoid high-constraint areas.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateDynamicConstraintField(obstacle_map, velocity, turning_radius, goal_location, historical_data):

    predicted_trajectories = PredictTrajectories(velocity, turning_radius, goal_location, historical_data)

    constraint_field = Empty 2D Array

    FOR each trajectory IN predicted_trajectories:
        risk_volume = ProjectRiskVolume(trajectory, velocity, turning_radius)
        obstacle_intersections = FindObstacleIntersections(risk_volume, obstacle_map)
        trajectory_constraints = CalculateTrajectoryConstraints(obstacle_intersections)
        constraint_field = OverlayConstraintField(constraint_field, trajectory_constraints)

    smoothed_constraint_field = ApplyGaussianFilter(constraint_field)

    RETURN smoothed_constraint_field

FUNCTION CalculateTrajectoryConstraints(obstacle_intersections):
    # Assign a constraint value to each point based on proximity to obstacles
    # (e.g., inverse distance squared)
    # Normalize the constraint values
    RETURN constraint_values
```

**Novelty:**  This system proactively anticipates and adapts to the AMD’s movement, creating a fluid and responsive navigation experience.  Instead of a static map, it offers a dynamic assessment of risk and opportunity, allowing the AMD to make more informed decisions.
