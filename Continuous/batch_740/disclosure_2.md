## Spatial Audio Beacon System

**Concept:** Leverage the positional tracking detailed in the patent to dynamically generate localized spatial audio beacons. These beacons would not transmit traditional audio *content*, but rather, directional *instructions* for rendering sound within augmented or virtual reality experiences, or even localized 'real world' soundscapes.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Standard device with camera, processors, and memory as described in the patent.
    *   Array of micro-directional speakers (minimum 4, ideally 8+) integrated into device housing. These speakers should have a narrow beamwidth (approx. 15-30 degrees).
    *   High-precision inertial measurement unit (IMU) - accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer - for accurate device orientation tracking.
    *   Optional: Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio for precise distance measurements between devices.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Beacon Generation Module:** Based on detected device positions (as determined by the patent's methods), calculate the vector direction to each device.
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:** 
        *   Accepts device position data and associated audio ‘tags’ (pre-defined or dynamically assigned).  An audio tag is *not* a sound file; it’s metadata defining a 3D sound profile (e.g., “gentle chime”, “directional whoosh”, “proximity alert”) and associated rendering parameters (volume, frequency, pan).
        *   Calculates the optimal speaker configuration to project the 3D sound profile towards the target device's location.  This considers speaker beamwidth, device distance, and ambient noise.
        *   Utilizes beamforming techniques to focus sound energy in the desired direction.
        *   Dynamically adjusts speaker output levels and beamforming parameters to compensate for device movement and changes in the environment.
    *   **Ambient Mapping & Noise Cancellation:** The system must analyze the acoustic environment using the device’s microphone. This data is used to:
        *   Identify and filter out background noise.
        *   Model the acoustic properties of the surrounding space (e.g., reflections, reverberation).
        *   Adjust the spatial audio rendering to minimize interference and maximize clarity.
    *   **Communication Protocol:**  Devices must be able to:
        *   Broadcast their ID and position.
        *   Receive audio tag assignments from a central server or other devices.
        *   Request specific audio tags from other devices.
        *   Share environmental data (e.g., noise levels, acoustic properties).
*   **Pseudocode (Spatial Audio Rendering Loop):**

```
FOR each detected device in device_list:
    // Calculate direction vector from this device to the detected device
    direction_vector = calculate_direction(this_device_position, detected_device_position)

    // Get associated audio tag for this device
    audio_tag = get_audio_tag(detected_device_id)

    // Calculate speaker configuration based on direction vector and audio tag
    speaker_configuration = calculate_speaker_config(direction_vector, audio_tag)

    // Set speaker output levels and beamforming parameters
    set_speaker_output(speaker_configuration)

    // Apply noise cancellation and ambient filtering
    apply_noise_cancellation(ambient_data)
