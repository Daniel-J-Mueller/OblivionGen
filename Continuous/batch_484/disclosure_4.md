## Data Lineage Visualization & Predictive Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the access categorization and lineage tracking to create a dynamic, interactive visualization of data flow *and* predict potential access violations before they occur. This moves beyond simply enforcing existing rules to proactively identifying and mitigating risk.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Flow Graph Generation:**

*   **Input:** The existing access metadata system (as described in the patent) serves as the foundation.
*   **Process:** Automatically generate a directed graph representing the flow of data. Nodes represent datasets (original and derived). Edges represent transformations/queries. Edge weight reflects the “sensitivity” inherited from source data, determined by access level hierarchy.
*   **Output:**  An interactive, visually navigable graph displayed in a dedicated UI. Users can zoom, filter by access level, and trace data lineage.

**2. Predictive Access Control Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Data Flow Graph.
    *   User profiles (access levels, roles, typical access patterns).
    *   Real-time access request logs.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Path Analysis:** When a user requests access to a dataset, the engine identifies *all* paths in the Data Flow Graph leading to that dataset.
    *   **Sensitivity Calculation:** The engine calculates an aggregate "sensitivity score" for each path, based on the highest access level required along that path.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Compare the user's current access request against their historical access patterns. Flag any requests that deviate significantly, *especially* if the calculated sensitivity score exceeds the user's authorized level. Use a rolling average to dampen noise and allow for legitimate changes in behavior.
    *   **Predictive Alerts:** Generate alerts for potentially unauthorized access attempts *before* they are completed. These alerts include the data path, the user’s identity, and a risk score.

**3.  Dynamic Policy Adjustment:**

*   **Input:** Predictive Alerts, Administrator Input
*   **Process:**  Allow administrators to review predictive alerts and dynamically adjust access policies based on the identified risks.  The system should suggest policy adjustments (e.g., raising the access level requirement for a specific dataset) based on the analysis.
*   **Output:** Updated Access Policies, Automated Policy Enforcement.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Alert Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GeneratePredictiveAlert(user, dataset):
  paths = FindAllPaths(dataset)  //Find all paths from the dataset to original sources
  
  FOR path IN paths:
    sensitivity = MaxAccessLevel(path)  //Find max access level required along the path
    
    IF sensitivity > user.accessLevel:
      riskScore = CalculateRiskScore(user, path, sensitivity)  //Use historical data and path complexity
      
      IF riskScore > threshold:
        alert = CreateAlert(user, dataset, path, riskScore)
        LogAlert(alert)
        RETURN alert

  RETURN NULL
```

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) to efficiently store and query the Data Flow Graph.
*   **Real-time Analytics:** Employ a stream processing framework (Kafka, Flink) to analyze access requests in real-time.
*   **Machine Learning:** Implement anomaly detection algorithms (isolation forests, one-class SVM) to identify suspicious access patterns.
*   **UI/UX:** Design an intuitive UI for visualizing the Data Flow Graph and managing predictive alerts.
