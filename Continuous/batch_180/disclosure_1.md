## Adaptive Proximity-Based Feature Unlocking

**Concept:** Extend the contextual pairing concept to trigger feature unlocks within an application or device, based not just on proximity, but on *learned* proximity patterns and user activity. Instead of just pairing, the system learns 'comfortable' distances and activity contexts, then uses those to dynamically enable/disable features.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors Bluetooth/UWB/WiFi signal strength between the device and a paired 'companion' device (phone, smartwatch, etc.).
    *   Logs signal strength data paired with timestamped user activity data (app usage, sensor readings - accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone - categorized: 'work', 'leisure', 'travel', 'home').
    *   Stores data locally and optionally synchronizes to a cloud-based profile.
*   **Pattern Learning Engine:**
    *   Utilizes a time-series analysis algorithm (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, LSTM network) to identify common proximity patterns associated with specific activities.
    *   Dynamically adjusts 'comfort zones' based on learned patterns.  For example, a user might prefer a device to be within 1 meter during 'work' activity, but within 5 meters during 'leisure'.
    *   Assigns confidence levels to learned patterns to avoid false positives.
*   **Feature Control Module:**
    *   Defines a mapping between proximity/activity contexts and device features (e.g., 'high security mode', 'hands-free control', 'enhanced audio', 'limited functionality').
    *   Continuously monitors proximity and activity data.
    *   Dynamically enables/disables features based on the learned patterns and current context.
*   **User Override:**
    *   Provides a user interface to view and adjust learned patterns.
    *   Allows users to manually define specific contexts and feature mappings.
    *   Offers an "emergency override" to immediately enable/disable all features.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Data Collection Module
while(true){
    signalStrength = getSignalStrength();
    activity = detectActivity();
    timestamp = getCurrentTimestamp();
    logData(timestamp, signalStrength, activity);
}

//Pattern Learning Engine
function learnPatterns(){
    data = loadLoggedData();
    model = trainTimeSeriesModel(data); // HMM, LSTM, etc.
    saveModel(model);
}

//Feature Control Module
function controlFeatures(){
    model = loadModel();
    signalStrength = getSignalStrength();
    activity = detectActivity();
    context = predictContext(model, signalStrength, activity);
    featureSet = getFeatureSetForContext(context);
    applyFeatureSet(featureSet);
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Automotive:**  Unlock specific features (e.g., parking assist) when the user is detected near the vehicle.  Disable features (e.g., media playback) when the user is detected to be driving and focused.
*   **Smart Home:**  Enable smart lock access only when the user is detected to be within a comfortable proximity and engaged in a specific activity (e.g., carrying groceries).
*   **Wearables:**  Unlock advanced fitness tracking features only when the user is detected to be engaged in a workout.
*   **Security:** Adaptive authentication methods based on learned proximity and behavioral patterns.
