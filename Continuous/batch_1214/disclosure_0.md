## Modular Acoustic Shell with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Expand on the seamless fabric covering to create a fully modular, dynamically configurable acoustic shell for the portable audio device. Incorporate haptic feedback elements *within* the fabric itself.

**Specifications:**

**1. Modular Fabric Panels:**

*   **Material:** Seamless knitted fabric (as in the base patent) with embedded conductive threads forming a grid pattern. Varying fabric density and weave patterns to fine-tune acoustic properties.
*   **Segmentation:** The seamless tube is constructed from interlocking, geometrically shaped panels (triangles, quadrilaterals) rather than a continuous tube. These panels connect via micro-magnetic or snap-fit connectors concealed within the fabric folds.
*   **Panel Types:**
    *   **Acoustic Panels:** High-density weave to absorb or reflect sound.
    *   **Haptic Panels:**  Integrated with miniature vibration motors and piezoelectric actuators.
    *   **Transparent/Translucent Panels:**  Allowing for integrated lighting effects or visual feedback.
    *   **Sensor Panels:**  Embedded capacitive or pressure sensors for touch input.
*   **Connector System:** Micro-magnetic or snap-fit connectors featuring conductive pathways for data/power transfer.  Connectors must be flush with the fabric surface.

**2. Haptic Feedback System:**

*   **Actuators:** Miniature vibration motors and piezoelectric actuators integrated within designated “Haptic Panels.”
*   **Control:** A dedicated haptic driver IC connected to the device’s processor. Software algorithms map audio frequencies, user interactions, or system events to specific haptic patterns.
*   **Haptic Patterns:**
    *   **Audio-Reactive:**  Vibration patterns respond to the bass, mid-range, and treble frequencies of the audio output.
    *   **Navigation Feedback:**  Haptic "clicks" or pulses guide the user through menu selections or indicate the boundaries of touch controls.
    *   **Notification Alerts:** Distinct vibration patterns signal incoming calls, messages, or other notifications.
    *   **Proximity Awareness:** Subtle vibrations increase in intensity as the user’s hand approaches the device.

**3. Dynamic Acoustic Shaping:**

*   **Software Control:** Device software allows the user to configure the shape and acoustic properties of the external shell.
*   **Panel Actuation:** Miniature linear actuators (integrated with the panel connectors) can subtly adjust the curvature or angle of individual panels, altering the device’s sound projection and resonance characteristics.
*   **Acoustic Profiles:** Pre-set profiles for different audio modes (e.g., “Bass Boost,” “Clear Voice,” “Immersive Surround”).
*   **User-Defined Profiles:** Users can create and save their own acoustic profiles.

**4. Charging/Data Interface:**

*   **Wireless Charging Integration:**  The charging foot (as in the base patent) incorporates wireless charging coils.
*   **Contactless Data Transfer:**  Utilize near-field communication (NFC) within the charging foot to enable data transfer and device pairing.

**5. Assembly/Disassembly:**

*   **Modular Design:** The device can be easily disassembled and reassembled for repair or customization.
*   **Panel Replacement:** Individual panels can be replaced or upgraded without affecting the rest of the device.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Acoustic Shaping):**

```
function adjustAcousticProfile(profileName) {
  switch (profileName) {
    case "Bass Boost":
      // Adjust panel angles to enhance low-frequency response
      for each panel in acousticPanels {
        panel.angle = -5 degrees;
      }
    case "Clear Voice":
      // Adjust panel angles to focus on mid-range frequencies
      for each panel in acousticPanels {
        panel.angle = 2 degrees;
      }
    case "Immersive Surround":
      // Stagger panel angles to create a wider soundstage
      for (i = 0; i < acousticPanels.length; i++) {
        acousticPanels[i].angle = sin(i * 360 / acousticPanels.length);
      }
    default:
      // Reset to default settings
      for each panel in acousticPanels {
        panel.angle = 0 degrees;
      }
  }
}

function updateHapticFeedback(audioFrequency, touchInput) {
  if (audioFrequency > 500 Hz) {
    // Activate vibration motor on corresponding panel
    hapticPanel.vibrate(audioFrequency);
  }
  if (touchInput) {
    // Provide haptic click on touch panel
    touchPanel.vibrate(100 ms);
  }
}
```
