## Dynamic Website "Blueprint" Generation & AI-Driven Content Adaptation

**Core Concept:** Extend the automated website structure determination to *actively* generate a dynamic “blueprint” of a site – not just identifying elements, but predicting likely content zones and automatically adapting content *to* those zones, maximizing content display and user engagement. This goes beyond extraction; it's anticipatory content fitting.

**Specs:**

1.  **Blueprint Generator Module:**
    *   Input: Target Website URL.
    *   Process:
        *   Crawls the site, analyzing HTML structure, CSS styling, and Javascript interactions.
        *   Employs a machine learning model (trained on vast datasets of website layouts) to *predict* content zones – hero sections, product grids, sidebars, footer areas – even on pages not yet fully crawled.  It should identify probable content *types* within those zones (image, text, video, form, etc.).
        *   Creates a JSON-based “blueprint” detailing the predicted zones, content types, and size/resolution parameters.  This blueprint is dynamically updated as more of the site is crawled.
        *   Blueprint includes confidence scores for each zone prediction - indicating reliability.
    *   Output: Dynamic JSON blueprint.

2.  **AI Content Adaptation Engine:**
    *   Input: Raw content (text, images, videos) + Website Blueprint.
    *   Process:
        *   Uses a Generative AI model (e.g., large language model, diffusion model) to adapt the raw content to *fit* the predicted zones in the blueprint.
        *   Text adaptation: Adjusts length, tone, and format to suit the zone.  Can rewrite headlines, summaries, or entire articles.
        *   Image/Video adaptation: Resizes, crops, and optimizes media for the specified dimensions and resolution.  Can apply stylistic filters or generate alternative versions.
        *   Dynamic content generation: If a zone requires content that isn't provided, the engine can *generate* it based on the website's theme and context (e.g., generate a short product description for a product image).
        *   A/B testing framework built in - automatically generate multiple content variations and test which performs best.
    *   Output: Adapted content, ready for insertion into the website.

3.  **Content Insertion API:**
    *   Interface: REST API.
    *   Functionality:
        *   Receives adapted content and website blueprint.
        *   Identifies target zones in the website’s HTML (using CSS selectors or other identifiers).
        *   Dynamically inserts the adapted content into the target zones.
        *   Handles asynchronous content loading and rendering.
        *   Supports real-time content updates and personalization.

**Pseudocode (AI Content Adaptation Engine):**

```
function adaptContent(rawContent, blueprint):
  zonePredictions = blueprint.getZonePredictions()
  adaptedContent = {}

  for zone in zonePredictions:
    predictedType = zone.getContentType()
    size = zone.getSize()

    if predictedType == "text":
      adaptedContent[zone.getId()] = generateText(rawContent, size)  //Uses LLM to rewrite content
    elif predictedType == "image":
      adaptedContent[zone.getId()] = resizeImage(rawContent, size)
    elif predictedType == "video":
      adaptedContent[zone.getId()] = optimizeVideo(rawContent, size)
    else:
      adaptedContent[zone.getId()] = rawContent //Fallback if prediction is incorrect

  return adaptedContent
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond merely *extracting* information; it *proactively* reshapes content to fit predicted website layouts. It creates a feedback loop: the blueprint informs content adaptation, and successful content adaptation refines the blueprint.
