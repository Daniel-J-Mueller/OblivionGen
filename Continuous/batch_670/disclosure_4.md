## Adaptive Beacon Frequency Shifting for Jamming Resilience

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting beacon transmission frequencies based on real-time spectral analysis to mitigate interference and jamming attacks. This builds on the segmented beacon concept, but focuses on proactive frequency hopping rather than just data transmission *within* beacons.

**Components:**

*   **Spectral Analyzer:** Continuously scans the 2.4GHz/5GHz spectrum (or relevant band) for interference, jamming signals, and signal strength variations.
*   **Frequency Hopping Engine:**  Algorithmically determines the optimal transmission frequency for beacon signals, based on input from the spectral analyzer. The engine prioritizes frequencies with minimal interference and sufficient signal strength.
*   **Beacon Modulator:** Modifies the beacon signal's carrier frequency based on the output of the frequency hopping engine.
*   **Receiver Synchronization Module:** Implements a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded with a shared key (established during initial device pairing) to predict the transmitter’s beacon frequency at any given time.  The receiver continuously scans a range of frequencies around the predicted frequency, allowing for reliable signal acquisition even with slight timing or frequency drift.
*   **Acknowledgement Beacon Protocol:** Receiver sends back acknowledgement beacons *on a predetermined, fixed frequency* to confirm successful segment reception, even if the primary beacon frequency is hopping. This 'back channel' avoids the complexity of frequency hopping for acknowledgements.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initialization:** Devices establish a shared secret key during initial pairing. Both transmitter and receiver initialize their PRNGs with this key.
2.  **Spectral Analysis:** The transmitter's spectral analyzer continuously monitors the radio spectrum.
3.  **Frequency Determination:** The Frequency Hopping Engine uses the spectral analysis data *and* the PRNG to determine the next beacon transmission frequency.  The PRNG provides a pseudo-random sequence, while the spectral analyzer adjusts the frequency selection based on real-time conditions.  (e.g., `next_frequency = PRNG() + spectral_offset`).
4.  **Beacon Transmission:** The Beacon Modulator shifts the beacon signal's carrier frequency to the determined value and transmits the segmented message.
5.  **Receiver Prediction:** The receiver's synchronization module uses the same shared secret key and PRNG to predict the transmitter’s beacon frequency. It scans a narrow frequency band around the predicted frequency.
6.  **Segment Reception & Acknowledgement:**  Upon receiving a segment, the receiver transmits an acknowledgement beacon on the pre-defined fixed frequency.
7.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** Both the transmitter and receiver continuously monitor the link quality and adjust the PRNG parameters (e.g., seed, increment) to further optimize the frequency hopping sequence based on detected interference patterns.

**Pseudocode (Transmitter - Frequency Determination):**

```
function determine_next_frequency(spectral_data, prng_state, fixed_offset):
  prng_output = PRNG(prng_state)
  interference_level = spectral_data.get_interference_at_frequency(prng_output)

  // Adjust frequency based on interference
  frequency_offset = interference_level * adjustment_factor

  next_frequency = prng_output + frequency_offset + fixed_offset

  // Clamp frequency within allowed range
  next_frequency = max(min_frequency, min(max_frequency, next_frequency))

  // Update PRNG state
  new_prng_state = PRNG_Update(prng_state)

  return next_frequency, new_prng_state
```

**Novelty:**  This system isn’t simply about sending data in beacons, it’s about *actively avoiding* interference by proactively changing the beacon’s transmission frequency, using a PRNG and spectral analysis. It transforms the beacon signal into a dynamic, adaptive transmission that is significantly more resilient to jamming attacks.  The fixed-frequency acknowledgement channel is also a unique addition, simplifying the communication process while maintaining security.
