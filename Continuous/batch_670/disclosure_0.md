**Adaptive Relay State Generation via Behavioral Biometrics**

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This design expands upon the concept of relay state data by dynamically generating it based on user behavioral biometrics gathered *during* the single sign-on (SSO) process itself.  Instead of relying on pre-stored relay states tied to identity providers, the system creates a unique, temporary relay state informed by how the user interacts with the authentication flow. This dramatically enhances security and mitigates risks associated with relay state token compromise or manipulation.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Biometrics Module (BBM):** Integrated within the intermediate endpoint. Captures data points during the initial phases of the SSO process. Data points include (but are not limited to):
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, rhythm).
    *   Mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns).
    *   Scroll behavior (speed, patterns).
    *   Touchscreen interactions (pressure, swipe speed, multi-touch patterns).
    *   Device orientation changes.
2.  **Relay State Generator (RSG):**  Resides within the intermediate endpoint.  Receives behavioral biometric data from the BBM.  Utilizes a machine learning model (trained on legitimate user behavior) to generate a unique, encrypted relay state.  The model outputs a complex, high-entropy string.
3.  **Secure Relay State Store (SRSS):** A temporary, in-memory store (encrypted) within the intermediate endpoint. Stores the generated relay state for the duration of the current SSO session.  The relay state is associated with a session ID.
4.  **Authentication Endpoint Validator (AEV):** Integrated into the authentication endpoint. Receives the relay state from the user device.  Decrypts the relay state. Retrieves the associated session ID. Validates the relay state’s integrity and confirms it correlates with the user’s behavioral profile.

**III. Process Flow:**

1.  User initiates SSO.
2.  Intermediate endpoint receives SSO request.
3.  BBM begins capturing user behavioral biometrics during the initial authentication exchange.
4.  RSG generates a unique, encrypted relay state based on the biometric data.
5.  The generated relay state is stored in the SRSS, associated with a session ID.
6.  The encrypted relay state is transmitted to the user device as part of the modified data payload.
7.  User device transmits the encrypted relay state to the authentication endpoint.
8.  AEV decrypts the relay state.
9.  AEV retrieves the associated session ID and verifies the relay state against the user's behavioral profile.
10. If validation passes, access is granted. If it fails, access is denied or multi-factor authentication is triggered.

**IV. Pseudocode (RSG - Relay State Generation):**

```
function generateRelayState(biometricData):
  //biometricData is a structured collection of observed biometric features

  //Feature Extraction
  extractedFeatures = extractRelevantFeatures(biometricData)

  //Model Prediction (uses a pre-trained ML model)
  predictedVector = mlModel.predict(extractedFeatures)

  //Convert Prediction to String (high entropy)
  relayStateString = encode(predictedVector) //Encoding method (e.g., Base64 with salting)

  //Encryption (AES-256 with a unique session key)
  encryptedRelayState = encrypt(relayStateString, sessionKey)

  return encryptedRelayState
```

**V. Security Considerations:**

*   The ML model must be resistant to adversarial attacks (e.g., data poisoning, evasion attacks).
*   Session keys must be securely generated and managed.
*   Data transmitted between components must be encrypted.
*   Regular model retraining is crucial to adapt to evolving user behavior and mitigate the risk of model drift.
