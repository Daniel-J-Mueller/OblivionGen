## Secure Hardware Attestation with Dynamic Trust Anchors

**Concept:** Extend the host attestation process by incorporating a dynamic trust anchor system. Instead of solely relying on a fixed signature authority’s public key as the root of trust, introduce a rotating set of trusted entities, each capable of signing attestations and verifying revocation data. This adds resilience against compromise of a single authority and allows for distributed trust.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dynamic Trust Anchor List (DTAL) Management:**

*   **Data Structure:** A Merkle Tree representing the current DTAL. Each leaf node contains the public key of a trusted entity (e.g., a cloud provider, security vendor, enterprise IT department).  The root hash of this tree is publicly known and regularly updated.
*   **Update Mechanism:** The DTAL is updated via a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., a permissioned blockchain or Raft).  Updates require a quorum of trusted entities to sign off.  New entities are added, and compromised entities are removed.
*   **Version Control:** Each DTAL update creates a new version. Attestations must include the DTAL version they were generated with.

**2. Attestation Workflow:**

1.  **Host Attestation Request:** The host system initiates an attestation request.
2.  **Attestation Data Generation:** The host generates attestation data including TPM measurements, system configuration, and the current DTAL version.
3.  **Signing & Verification:**
    *   The host obtains a signing key from a trusted authority *within* the current DTAL.
    *   The host signs the attestation data with this key.
    *   The verifier (e.g., a service requesting attestation) retrieves the DTAL corresponding to the attestation version.
    *   The verifier verifies the signature using the public key of the signing authority *within* the DTAL.
4.  **Revocation Handling:** Revocation data (e.g., serial numbers of compromised keys) is maintained by *each* entity in the DTAL. The verifier checks the revocation status using the revocation data provided by the signing authority.

**3.  Key Rotation & Delegation:**

*   **Periodic Key Rotation:** Each trusted entity rotates its signing keys periodically.
*   **Delegation of Signing Authority:**  An entity can delegate signing authority to a subordinate entity (e.g., a regional data center). The delegation is recorded in the DTAL.  Attestations issued by the subordinate entity are verifiable against the delegating entity’s public key (within the DTAL).

**4.  Pseudocode (Verifier Side):**

```
function verifyAttestation(attestation, signature, dtalVersion):
  dtal = retrieveDTAL(dtalVersion)
  signingAuthorityPublicKey = findPublicKeyInDTAL(dtal, attestation.signingAuthorityID)

  if signingAuthorityPublicKey == null:
    return false // Authority not found in DTAL

  if isKeyRevoked(signingAuthorityPublicKey, attestation.revocationData):
    return false // Key is revoked

  if verifySignature(attestation, signature, signingAuthorityPublicKey):
    return true
  else:
    return false
```

**5.  Implementation Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** The DTAL must be scalable to accommodate a large number of trusted entities. Merkle Trees provide efficient verification with logarithmic complexity.
*   **Trust Model:** The trust model must be carefully defined. Each entity in the DTAL is a point of trust.
*   **Communication Security:** Secure communication channels must be established between the host, the verifier, and the entities in the DTAL.
*   **Blockchain Integration (Optional):** A permissioned blockchain can be used to manage the DTAL and track key rotations and revocations.

This system allows for a more flexible and resilient attestation process, minimizing the impact of compromise and enabling a distributed trust model. The dynamic nature of the DTAL provides a significant security advantage over traditional static root-of-trust approaches.
