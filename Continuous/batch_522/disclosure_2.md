## Predictive Resource Shaping via Simulated Cascades

**Concept:** Expand predictive failure mitigation to proactively *shape* resource allocation based on simulated cascading failures, not just react to predicted single-point failures. This allows for anticipatory load balancing and temporary performance downgrades to avoid actual outages, effectively building a ‘resilience buffer’.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Cascade Simulation Engine (CSE)
*   **Input:** Real-time operational metrics (as per the original patent), dependency maps of infrastructure and services, historical failure data, service criticality weights.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Dependency Graph Construction:**  Build a dynamic graph representing dependencies between infrastructure components and hosted services.  Nodes = infrastructure components/services.  Edges = dependencies (e.g., service X requires database Y, server Z hosts service X).  Edge weights represent dependency strength/bandwidth.
    2.  **Monte Carlo Simulation:**  Run Monte Carlo simulations of potential failure scenarios.  Start with a seed failure (identified by the original patent's predictive model). Propagate the failure through the dependency graph. Simulate cascading effects (e.g., failure of DB causes service X to overload, triggering alerts, and potentially failing other services). Run thousands of simulations with randomized failure parameters (duration, impact).
    3.  **Resource Impact Assessment:**  For each simulation, quantify the impact on resource utilization (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) across all infrastructure components.  Identify 'bottlenecks' and potential overload points.
    4.  **Predictive Resource Shaping:**  Based on the aggregated simulation results, dynamically adjust resource allocation *before* the predicted failure occurs.
        *   **Proactive Load Balancing:**  Shift traffic away from components predicted to be overloaded.
        *   **Temporary Performance Downgrades:**  Reduce the priority of non-critical tasks or temporarily disable resource-intensive features. (e.g. reduce image resolution, reduce API call frequency).
        *   **Pre-emptive Scaling:**  Provision additional resources (VMs, containers) in anticipation of increased load.
        *   **‘Shadow’ Service Instances:** Initiate standby service instances to absorb load from failing counterparts.
    5.  **Feedback Loop:** Monitor the actual impact of the resource shaping adjustments. Use this data to refine the simulation models and improve the accuracy of future predictions.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `DependencyGraph`:  Adjacency list/matrix representing infrastructure dependencies. Node attributes: type (server, database, network device, service), capacity, current utilization. Edge attributes: bandwidth, latency, dependency weight.
    *   `SimulationResult`:  List of resource utilization metrics for each infrastructure component during a single simulation run.
    *   `ResourceShapingPlan`:  List of actions to be taken (e.g., shift traffic, scale VM, reduce priority).

*   **Pseudocode (CSE Core):**

```pseudocode
function run_cascade_simulation(seed_failure, dependency_graph, simulation_count):
    results = []
    for i in range(simulation_count):
        current_graph = copy(dependency_graph) # Ensure isolation
        propagate_failure(current_graph, seed_failure) # Simulate cascading effects
        results.append(collect_resource_metrics(current_graph))
    return results

function propagate_failure(graph, failure_node):
    queue = [failure_node]
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)

        # Simulate failure impact on dependent nodes
        for neighbor in graph.neighbors(node):
            # Reduce neighbor's capacity based on failure impact
            impact = calculate_impact(node, neighbor) # Function to quantify impact
            neighbor.capacity -= impact
            if neighbor.capacity <= 0:
                queue.append(neighbor) # Propagate to next level

function calculate_impact(failed_node, dependent_node):
    # Logic to determine impact based on dependency weight, capacity, etc.
    # Return a value representing the reduction in capacity.

function collect_resource_metrics(graph):
    # Iterate through graph nodes and collect metrics (CPU, memory, bandwidth)
    # Return a list of metrics.
