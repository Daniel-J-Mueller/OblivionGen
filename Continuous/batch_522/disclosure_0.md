## Multi-Modal Stylometry & 'Emotional Resonance' Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the existing textual analysis to incorporate audio and visual data associated with a text’s creation/presentation, creating a richer ‘stylometric fingerprint’ and assessing ‘emotional resonance’ to more accurately identify machine-generated content, or assess authenticity.

**Specification:**

1.  **Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   Input: Textual work (as in the patent). Audio recording (voice of author/presenter, background sounds). Visual data (video of author/presenter, images associated with text).
    *   Preprocessing: Noise reduction (audio/video). Text normalization.  Frame rate standardization.

2.  **Feature Extraction Modules:**
    *   *Textual Features* (as per the patent): N-grams, grammatical structure, sentence complexity, word choice, etc.
    *   *Audio Features:*
        *   Prosodic features: Pitch, rhythm, intonation, speaking rate.
        *   Spectral features: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), formant frequencies.
        *   Voice quality:  Jitter, shimmer, harmonic-to-noise ratio.
    *   *Visual Features:*
        *   Facial expression analysis:  Action Units (AU) detection (e.g., brow furrow, lip corner pull).
        *   Body language analysis: Posture, gestures, eye gaze.
        *   Scene analysis: Color palettes, object recognition, composition.

3.  **Multi-Modal Fusion Engine:**
    *   **Weighting Algorithm:** Dynamically assigns weights to each modality based on data quality and relevance. (e.g., if audio is poor, it receives a lower weight).
    *   **Feature Concatenation:** Combine extracted features into a single feature vector.
    *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce dimensionality and improve performance.

4.  **Resonance Mapping & Anomaly Detection:**
    *   **Training Phase:**
        *   Create a database of "authentic" and "machine-generated" samples, labeled with corresponding multi-modal data.
        *   Train a machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Neural Network) to learn the relationship between multi-modal features and authenticity.
    *   **Inference Phase:**
        *   Input: New textual work with accompanying audio/visual data.
        *   Extract multi-modal features.
        *   Predict authenticity score.
        *   **'Emotional Resonance' Score:** Calculate a score based on the correlation between textual sentiment, audio prosody, and visual expressions. High correlation indicates authenticity. Significant discrepancies suggest machine generation.
        *   Generate a visualization of the feature space, highlighting anomalies and potential machine-generated patterns.

5.  **Output:**
    *   Authenticity score (0-100%).
    *   Emotional Resonance score.
    *   Anomaly visualization.
    *   List of features contributing to the decision.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function analyze_work(text, audio, video):
  text_features = extract_text_features(text)
  audio_features = extract_audio_features(audio)
  video_features = extract_video_features(video)

  combined_features = concatenate(text_features, audio_features, video_features)

  authenticity_score = model.predict(combined_features)

  resonance_score = calculate_emotional_resonance(text, audio, video)

  return authenticity_score, resonance_score, anomaly_visualization
```

**Novelty:**  The combination of textual, audio, and visual analysis, coupled with the 'Emotional Resonance' metric, provides a more holistic and robust approach to identifying machine-generated content than relying solely on textual features. It addresses the potential for increasingly sophisticated AI to mimic writing style while lacking genuine emotional expression.
