**Adaptive Notification Prioritization & Contextual Delivery System**

**Concept:** Extend the notification queuing system to dynamically prioritize and contextualize notifications based on user activity *across multiple* devices and applications, not just email.  This moves beyond simple storage and delivery to intelligent notification management.

**Specs:**

1.  **Unified Activity Monitor:**
    *   Component: Software agent installed on user devices (desktop, mobile, potentially IoT devices).
    *   Function: Continuously monitors user activity: application usage, location (with permission), calendar events, sensor data (e.g., motion, ambient light).
    *   Data Transmission: Encrypted activity stream sent to a central “Context Engine”.
    *   Privacy: User-configurable privacy settings to control data collection and transmission.  Opt-in only.

2.  **Context Engine:**
    *   Component: Server-side software.
    *   Function: Analyzes the activity stream using machine learning algorithms.
    *   Output: Generates a "Context Score" for each notification – a numerical representation of the notification’s relevance to the user *at that moment*. Factors include:
        *   Application relevance (e.g., a shipping notification is more relevant when the user is browsing an e-commerce site).
        *   Location (e.g., a restaurant offer is more relevant when the user is nearby).
        *   Time of day/week.
        *   Calendar events (e.g., suppress work notifications during a scheduled meeting).
        *   User-defined preferences (e.g., “Do Not Disturb” mode).

3.  **Adaptive Notification Queue:**
    *   Integrates with existing HTTP server notification queuing system.
    *   Notifications are assigned a Context Score by the Context Engine.
    *   Queue prioritizes notifications based on Context Score. High-scoring notifications are delivered immediately; low-scoring notifications are delayed or grouped.
    *   Dynamic Thresholding: The delivery threshold adjusts based on user interaction patterns.  If the user frequently dismisses high-scoring notifications, the threshold lowers.

4.  **Cross-Device Synchronization:**
    *   Notifications are synchronized across all user devices.
    *   Delivery Preference: User can specify preferred delivery device (e.g., always deliver urgent notifications to mobile).

5.  **Notification "Bundling" & Summarization:**
    *   Low-scoring notifications are bundled into summaries.  (e.g., "You have 5 new email updates. View details?").
    *   Summarization utilizes NLP to extract key information.

**Pseudocode (Context Engine - Notification Scoring)**

```
function calculateContextScore(notification, userActivity) {
  score = 0;

  // Application Relevance
  if (userActivity.currentApp == notification.sourceApp) {
    score += 50;
  }

  // Location Relevance
  if (distanceBetween(userActivity.location, notification.location) < 100m) {
    score += 30;
  }

  // Time Relevance (example: prioritize work notifications during work hours)
  if (isWorkHours() && notification.category == "work") {
    score += 20;
  }

  // User Preferences
  if (user.doNotDisturb == false) {
    score += 10;
  }

  // Machine Learning Component (train on user interactions)
  predictedRelevance = mlModel.predict(notification, userActivity);
  score += predictedRelevance * 20;

  return score;
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability: The Context Engine must handle a large volume of activity data.
*   Privacy: Robust data encryption and user privacy controls are crucial.
*   Machine Learning: Requires a large dataset of user interaction data for training the relevance model.
*   Resource Consumption: Minimize battery drain on mobile devices.
