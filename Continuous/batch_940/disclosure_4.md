## Dynamic Data Tiering with Predictive Pre-staging

**Concept:** Extend the conditional data management to incorporate predictive data tiering based on access patterns *and* anticipated workload. Rather than simply preventing deletion, actively manage data placement across storage tiers (e.g., SSD, HDD, tape) based on probabilistic future access.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Access Pattern Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Continuous stream of data access requests (read/write) including timestamps, user/application identifiers, and data object identifiers.
*   **Processing:** Employ time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to identify recurring access patterns for each data object or collection. Calculate a “recency score” and “frequency score.”
*   **Output:**  For each data object: `recency_score`, `frequency_score`, `predicted_access_probability(t)` where *t* is a time horizon (e.g., next hour, next day).  Store these in a dedicated 'access profile' database.

**2. Workload Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical workload data (CPU utilization, network bandwidth, application load, scheduled jobs, external events – e.g., end-of-month processing).
*   **Processing:** Utilize machine learning models (e.g., regression, neural networks) to predict future workload demands.  Generate a “workload demand score” for each time horizon.
*   **Output:**  “workload_demand_score(t)” for each time horizon.

**3. Tiering Policy Engine:**

*   **Input:** `recency_score`, `frequency_score`, `predicted_access_probability(t)`, `workload_demand_score(t)`, predefined tiering policies (see below), data object size.
*   **Processing:**  Evaluate tiering policies based on combined access and workload predictions.
*   **Output:** Tier assignment (e.g., Tier 0: SSD, Tier 1: HDD, Tier 2: Tape) and a “staging priority” score.

**Tiering Policy Examples:**

*   **High Performance:**  If `predicted_access_probability(t) > 0.8` *and* `workload_demand_score(t) > 0.7`, assign to Tier 0 (SSD).
*   **Balanced:** If `predicted_access_probability(t) > 0.5` *or* `workload_demand_score(t) > 0.5`, assign to Tier 1 (HDD).
*   **Archive:**  If `predicted_access_probability(t) < 0.2` *and* `workload_demand_score(t) < 0.2`, assign to Tier 2 (Tape).
*   **Staging Priority:**  Calculate a staging priority based on the time to retrieve from the lower tiers *and* the predicted access probability. Higher priority means pre-stage the data.

**4. Pre-staging Manager:**

*   **Input:** Tier assignments, staging priorities, available bandwidth, storage capacity.
*   **Processing:** Schedule data movement between tiers based on staging priority and resource availability.  Implement a "graceful degradation" strategy: if resources are constrained, prioritize the highest priority data.
*   **Output:** Data movement requests.

**5. Integration with Existing System:**

*   The system should integrate with the front-end and metadata plane described in the patent.
*   The front-end maintains the tier assignment for each data object.
*   The metadata plane tracks the current tier and staging priority.

**Pseudocode (Pre-staging Manager):**

```
function schedule_pre_staging() {
  data_objects = get_data_objects_needing_pre_staging() // Filter by tier assignment and staging priority
  sorted_objects = sort(data_objects, by staging_priority, descending)

  for object in sorted_objects {
    if available_bandwidth > object.size {
      move_data(object, from current_tier, to preferred_tier)
      update_metadata(object, new_tier)
      available_bandwidth -= object.size
    } else {
      //Log resource contention, or delay staging
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply preventing deletion and actively manages data placement to optimize performance and cost based on *predicted* future access.  The integration of workload prediction adds another dimension to the tiering decisions. The tiered priority system makes data available *before* it is even requested.
