**Adaptive Data Partitioning with Predictive Resource Allocation**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the existing data import system by dynamically adjusting data partitioning *during* import based on real-time resource utilization and predictive modeling.  Instead of pre-defined partitions based solely on throughput, weâ€™ll introduce *adaptive* partitions.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Resource Monitor:** Continuously tracks CPU, memory, and I/O usage of storage nodes.
*   **Predictive Model:**  A machine learning model trained on historical import data (file size, data complexity, import rate) and resource utilization. Predicts future resource needs *during* import.
*   **Partition Adjustment Engine:**  Dynamically splits or merges data partitions *during* the import process based on signals from the Resource Monitor and the Predictive Model.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitors import performance *after* partition adjustments and updates the Predictive Model to improve accuracy.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Partitioning:** Begin import with a standard partitioning scheme (as currently implemented).
2.  **Real-Time Monitoring:**  The Resource Monitor tracks resource usage on storage nodes.
3.  **Prediction:** The Predictive Model forecasts resource needs for the remaining import.
4.  **Adjustment Trigger:** If the Predictive Model indicates potential resource contention (e.g., exceeding CPU threshold), or if the Resource Monitor detects increasing latency, the Partition Adjustment Engine is triggered.
5.  **Dynamic Partitioning:**
    *   **Splitting:** If a partition is becoming a bottleneck, the Partition Adjustment Engine splits it into smaller partitions, distributing the load across more storage nodes.
    *   **Merging:** If partitions are underutilized, they are merged to reduce overhead.
6.  **Feedback & Learning:** The system monitors the impact of partition adjustments on import performance. This data is used to refine the Predictive Model, improving its accuracy over time.

**IV. Pseudocode (Partition Adjustment Engine):**

```
function adjustPartitions(currentPartitions, resourceUsage, predictedUsage) {
  // Define thresholds for CPU, memory, and I/O
  cpuThreshold = 0.8
  memoryThreshold = 0.9
  ioThreshold = 0.7

  // Check if resource usage exceeds thresholds
  if (resourceUsage.cpu > cpuThreshold OR resourceUsage.memory > memoryThreshold OR resourceUsage.io > ioThreshold) {
    // Identify the most stressed partition(s)
    stressedPartitions = findStressedPartitions(currentPartitions, resourceUsage)

    // Split the stressed partition(s)
    for each partition in stressedPartitions {
      newPartitions = splitPartition(partition) // Create 2 or more smaller partitions
      currentPartitions.remove(partition)
      currentPartitions.addAll(newPartitions)
    }
  } else if (arePartitionsUnderutilized(currentPartitions)) {
    // Identify partitions that can be merged
    mergeablePartitions = findMergeablePartitions(currentPartitions)

    // Merge the partitions
    for each pair of partitions in mergeablePartitions {
      mergedPartition = mergePartitions(partitions[0], partitions[1])
      currentPartitions.remove(partitions[0])
      currentPartitions.remove(partitions[1])
      currentPartitions.add(mergedPartition)
    }
  }

  return currentPartitions
}
```

**V. Data Structures:**

*   `Partition`: Represents a segment of the imported data, containing metadata (size, storage node assignment, import status).
*   `ResourceUsage`:  Contains CPU, memory, and I/O utilization metrics for a storage node.

**VI.  Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased import throughput by dynamically adapting to resource constraints.
*   Improved system stability by preventing resource contention.
*   Optimized resource utilization by reducing wasted capacity.
*   Seamless import operation even during peak load.
