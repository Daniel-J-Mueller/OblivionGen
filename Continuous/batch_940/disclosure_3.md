## Personalized Skill Component 'Shadowing' & Predictive Invocation

**Concept:** Extend the runtime ranking of skill components by introducing a ‘shadowing’ mechanism coupled with predictive invocation based on user behavior *across* devices and applications. This goes beyond context; it learns *how* a user uniquely interacts with similar requests, even if those requests span different digital touchpoints.

**Specification:**

**1. Shadow Component Creation & Association:**

*   Whenever a skill component is invoked, a 'shadow component' is instantiated. This shadow component mirrors the core functionality but *only* logs input/output data, user interaction metrics (dwell time, explicit feedback, subsequent actions), and system state.
*   User identifiers (anonymized/hashed for privacy) are used to associate shadow components with individual users.
*   Shadow components are not directly involved in request processing unless explicitly invoked by the predictive engine (see section 3).

**2. Longitudinal Interaction Data Collection & Feature Extraction:**

*   A dedicated data pipeline collects interaction data from all shadow components.
*   Feature extraction focuses on:
    *   **Input Similarity:** Utilize embedding models (BERT, Sentence Transformers) to represent natural language inputs as vectors.
    *   **Output Similarity:**  Represent skill component outputs (text, structured data) as vectors.
    *   **Interaction Patterns:** Quantify user interaction metrics (dwell time, clicks, explicit ratings).
    *   **Contextual Metadata:** Capture system state, device type, application context, time of day, location (with user consent).
    *   **Cross-Application Behavior:** Track user actions in *other* applications immediately following skill component invocation (e.g., opening a specific webpage, initiating a transaction).

**3. Predictive Invocation Engine:**

*   A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, transformer) is trained on the collected interaction data.
*   The model predicts the probability that a specific skill component (or a *variation* of that component – see section 4) would yield a positive user experience for a given input and user context.
*   Before invoking the standard ranked list of skill components, the predictive engine evaluates the top *N* candidates. If the prediction confidence for a specific component exceeds a predefined threshold, that component is invoked *directly*, bypassing the ranked list.
*   A key feature:  The predictive engine considers *sequences* of user interactions.  It learns that a user might initially prefer Component A for a specific request, but then switch to Component B after repeated interactions.

**4. Component Variation & A/B Testing:**

*   Allow skill developers to define variations of their components (e.g., different phrasing, alternative data sources, slightly modified logic).
*   The predictive engine can dynamically select the *best* variation for a given user, based on their past interactions.
*   Facilitate ongoing A/B testing of component variations, automatically adjusting the prediction model based on user feedback.

**5. Federated Learning & Privacy:**

*   Implement federated learning to train the prediction model on user data *without* requiring the data to be centralized.
*   This enhances privacy and reduces the risk of data breaches.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Invocation Engine):**

```
function predict_best_component(user_id, input_text, context_data):
  // 1. Feature Extraction
  input_vector = generate_input_embedding(input_text)
  context_vector = generate_context_embedding(context_data)
  user_vector = get_user_profile_embedding(user_id)

  // 2. Prediction
  combined_vector = concatenate(input_vector, context_vector, user_vector)
  prediction_scores = model.predict(combined_vector) // Returns scores for each component

  // 3. Confidence Thresholding
  best_component_id = argmax(prediction_scores)
  best_component_confidence = prediction_scores[best_component_id]

  if best_component_confidence > confidence_threshold:
    return best_component_id // Invoke directly
  else:
    return None // Use standard ranked list

```

**System Architecture Considerations:**

*   A dedicated service for managing shadow components and interaction data.
*   A scalable data pipeline for collecting, processing, and storing interaction data.
*   A real-time prediction service for evaluating component candidates.
*   Secure data storage and access controls to protect user privacy.
