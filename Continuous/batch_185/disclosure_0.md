## Adaptive Session Personality Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical browse history beyond simply tracking navigation. Capture *how* an agent interacts with the customer portal – speed of navigation, content consumed, emotional tone detected in session notes, keywords flagged, even mouse movement patterns. Build an ‘Agent Persona’ and a ‘Customer Persona’ during the session, and dynamically adjust the portal experience for *both* the agent and the customer based on these profiles.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Capture Module:**

*   **Agent Interaction Monitoring:** Track the following:
    *   Time spent on each content page.
    *   Scroll depth on each page.
    *   Keywords searched within the portal.
    *   Frequency and sentiment of notes entered (NLP analysis).
    *   Mouse movement patterns (heatmaps indicating focus areas).
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, error rate - indicative of stress/confidence).
*   **Customer Interaction Monitoring:**
    *   Time spent on self-service pages *before* agent contact.
    *   Keywords used in initial request/chat.
    *   Frequency of transfers between agents.
    *   Explicit feedback provided during/after the session (surveys, ratings).
*   **Data Storage:** Store all collected data tagged to the session ID in a time-series database optimized for rapid querying.

**2. Persona Generation Engine:**

*   **Agent Persona:**
    *   **Trait Extraction:** Use machine learning to identify dominant traits based on agent interaction data (e.g., ‘detail-oriented’, ‘fast-paced’, ‘empathetic’, ‘technical’).
    *   **Skill Mapping:** Correlate traits with specific skills (e.g., ‘expert in billing’, ‘proficient in troubleshooting network issues’).
    *   **Preference Learning:** Track content pages frequently accessed by the agent, indicating areas of expertise and preferred solutions.
*   **Customer Persona:**
    *   **Problem Category Identification:** Use NLP to categorize the customer’s issue based on initial requests and session notes.
    *   **Technical Proficiency Assessment:** Infer the customer’s technical skill level based on self-service activity and questions asked.
    *   **Communication Style Analysis:** Identify the customer’s preferred communication style (e.g., ‘concise’, ‘detailed’, ‘formal’, ‘informal’).

**3. Dynamic Portal Adjustment Module:**

*   **Agent Interface Customization:**
    *   **Content Prioritization:** Highlight content pages most relevant to the current customer persona and agent’s area of expertise.
    *   **Automated Script Suggestions:** Provide agents with pre-written responses or troubleshooting steps tailored to the customer’s issue.
    *   **Knowledge Base Filtering:** Filter search results to display only the most relevant articles and documentation.
*   **Customer Portal Customization:**
    *   **Content Simplification:** Simplify complex information for customers with lower technical proficiency.
    *   **Self-Service Guidance:** Proactively suggest relevant self-service articles or videos based on the customer’s issue.
    *   **Communication Style Adaptation:** Adjust the tone and language of automated messages to match the customer’s preferred style.

**4.  Hierarchical Browse History Extension:**

*   Augment the existing browse history tree with ‘Persona Indicators’ at each node, visualizing the inferred traits and skills of both the agent and the customer during that particular interaction.
*   Enable filtering of the browse history based on persona indicators, allowing agents to quickly identify interactions with similar customers or successful strategies employed by other agents.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Content Prioritization):**

```
function prioritize_content(customer_persona, agent_persona, content_list):
  # Calculate relevance scores for each content item
  for content_item in content_list:
    relevance_score = 0
    # Relevance to customer persona
    if content_item.category matches customer_persona.problem_category:
      relevance_score += 0.5
    if content_item.difficulty_level matches customer_persona.technical_skill:
      relevance_score += 0.2
    # Relevance to agent persona
    if content_item.category matches agent_persona.expertise:
      relevance_score += 0.3

  # Sort content items by relevance score
  sorted_content = sort(content_list, key=lambda x: x.relevance_score, reverse=True)
  return sorted_content
```

This allows for a dynamically adapting support experience, leveraging interaction data to improve both agent efficiency and customer satisfaction. The extended hierarchical browse history becomes a living record of the support journey, enriched with insights into the human elements involved.
