## Automated Anti-Pattern Synthesis & ‘Shadow Application’ Generation

**Concept:** Leverage the modernization knowledge base to *proactively* generate ‘shadow applications’ embodying known anti-patterns, allowing developers to test modernization strategies *before* applying them to production code.  Instead of just *identifying* anti-patterns, the system will *create* demonstrably flawed applications.

**Specifications:**

**1. Anti-Pattern Library Extension:**
   - Expand the modernization knowledge base to include a detailed library of anti-patterns.
   - Each anti-pattern entry must include:
     - A descriptive name (e.g., “Spaghetti Code”, “God Class”, “Copy-Paste Programming”).
     - A severity score (1-10, based on maintainability, performance, security risks).
     - A code generation template (defining the structure of the synthetic application embodying the pattern). This can use a domain-specific language (DSL) or templates in common languages (Python, Java, C#).
     - A set of associated modernization strategies (linked to entries in the existing knowledge base).
     - A ‘detection signature’ – a pattern or set of metrics used to reliably identify the anti-pattern in existing code.

**2. Synthetic Application Generator:**
   -  A module responsible for creating ‘shadow applications’ based on the anti-pattern library.
   - **Input:**  Anti-pattern name, desired complexity level (small, medium, large), optional constraints (e.g., maximum lines of code, specific technologies to use).
   - **Process:**
     - Selects the code generation template for the specified anti-pattern.
     - Instantiates the template, generating a complete, compilable application (or a set of files representing the application).
     - The generated application will *demonstrate* the specified anti-pattern in a clear and understandable way.
   - **Output:**  A runnable application (or set of files).

**3. Modernization Strategy Testing Environment:**
   - A sandboxed environment for applying modernization strategies to the synthetic application.
   - Integration with the existing modernization knowledge base to suggest appropriate strategies.
   - Automated execution of modernization tools (e.g., refactoring tools, linters, code analyzers).
   - Metrics collection:
     - Time taken to apply the modernization strategy.
     - Code quality improvements (measured by metrics like cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, maintainability index).
     - Performance improvements.
     - Error reduction.
   - Visualization of the results: a dashboard showing the impact of each modernization strategy on the synthetic application.

**4.  ‘Anti-Pattern Seed’ Feature:**
   - Ability to ‘seed’ existing applications with anti-patterns.
   - The system will identify suitable locations in the existing code to introduce the anti-pattern in a controlled manner.
   - This allows developers to test modernization strategies on real-world code without having to wait for anti-patterns to emerge naturally.

**Pseudocode (Synthetic Application Generator):**

```
function generateSyntheticApplication(antiPatternName, complexityLevel, constraints) {
  antiPatternData = getAntiPatternData(antiPatternName)
  codeTemplate = antiPatternData.codeTemplate

  // Apply complexity level & constraints to the template
  modifiedTemplate = applyComplexity(codeTemplate, complexityLevel)
  modifiedTemplate = applyConstraints(modifiedTemplate, constraints)

  // Generate code from the template
  generatedCode = generateCode(modifiedTemplate)

  // Compile and package the code (if necessary)
  compiledApplication = compileAndPackage(generatedCode)

  return compiledApplication
}

function getAntiPatternData(antiPatternName) {
  // Query the modernization knowledge base for the anti-pattern data
  // Return the data (code template, severity, modernization strategies)
}

function applyComplexity(codeTemplate, complexityLevel) {
  // Modify the template to increase or decrease complexity
  // (e.g., add more nested loops, increase method size)
}

function applyConstraints(codeTemplate, constraints) {
  // Apply constraints to the template (e.g., maximum lines of code, specific technologies)
}

function generateCode(codeTemplate) {
  // Generate code from the template using a code generation engine
}

function compileAndPackage(generatedCode) {
  // Compile and package the generated code into a runnable application
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Modernization:**  Shifts the focus from *reacting* to anti-patterns to *proactively* addressing them.
*   **Risk Mitigation:**  Allows developers to experiment with modernization strategies in a safe and controlled environment.
*   **Improved Training:**  Provides a hands-on learning experience for developers.
*   **Automated Testing:**  Automates the process of evaluating the effectiveness of modernization strategies.
