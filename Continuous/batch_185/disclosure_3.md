## Dynamic Network Slicing Based on Predicted Mobility & Latency

**Concept:** Proactively adjust network slice allocations to provider substrate extensions *before* a user experiences latency issues, based on predicted mobility patterns and anticipated network congestion. This goes beyond reacting to latency requests; it *anticipates* them.

**Specifications:**

**1. Mobility Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time location data from mobile devices (anonymized/aggregated), historical mobility data, time of day, day of week, event schedules (e.g., concerts, sporting events – sourced from public APIs or CSP data).
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a Markov Chain or LSTM neural network to predict future device locations with a defined confidence interval. This model learns typical movement patterns and can extrapolate future positions.
*   **Output:** Probability distribution of device locations for the next 5-15 minutes.

**2. Congestion Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network performance data (bandwidth utilization, latency, packet loss) from the CSP’s network management system, historical congestion data, event schedules.
*   **Algorithm:** Time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict network congestion levels in different geographic areas.
*   **Output:** Predicted congestion levels for each geographic region.

**3. Dynamic Slice Allocation Controller:**

*   **Input:** Mobility predictions, congestion predictions, latency requirements (from application profiles or user preferences), resource availability of provider substrate extensions.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Calculate anticipated latency:** For each predicted device location, estimate the latency to available provider substrate extensions.
    2.  **Determine slice requirements:** Based on the application and user requirements, determine the necessary bandwidth, processing power, and latency for each device.
    3.  **Pre-allocate network slices:**  Proactively allocate network slices to provider substrate extensions that can meet the anticipated latency and bandwidth requirements. This involves reserving resources and configuring network paths.
    4.  **Resource Balancing:** Continuously monitor resource utilization and dynamically adjust slice allocations to balance load and optimize performance.
*   **Output:** Configuration updates to the cloud provider network's control plane, triggering pre-allocation of slices.

**4. Handover Optimization:**

*   Integrate with the existing handover mechanisms to ensure seamless transitions between provider substrate extensions. 
*   Prioritize handover to pre-allocated slices based on predicted mobility.
*   Reduce handover latency by pre-configuring network paths.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Slice Allocation Controller):**

```
function allocate_slices(mobility_predictions, congestion_predictions, app_requirements, resource_availability):

  for each device in tracked_devices:
    predicted_locations = mobility_predictions.get_locations(device)
    for location in predicted_locations:
      best_extension = find_best_extension(location, app_requirements, resource_availability)
      if best_extension != None:
        allocate_slice(best_extension, app_requirements)

function find_best_extension(location, app_requirements, resource_availability):
  # Iterate through available extensions
  # Calculate estimated latency to each extension
  # Filter extensions based on resource availability
  # Select extension with lowest latency and sufficient resources
  return best_extension

function allocate_slice(extension, requirements):
  # Reserve resources on the extension
  # Configure network path
  # Update resource availability
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Mobility Prediction:** (Device ID, List of (Location, Probability))
*   **Congestion Prediction:** (Region ID, Predicted Congestion Level)
*   **Slice Allocation:** (Device ID, Extension ID, Bandwidth, Latency)

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure for running prediction models.
*   Real-time data streaming platform for ingesting location and network performance data.
*   Software-defined networking (SDN) controller for configuring network paths.
*   Integration with CSP’s network management system.
