## Adaptive Burst Allocation via Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Expand beyond static token bucket refilling and consumption by integrating a predictive model to dynamically adjust burst capacity based on anticipated workload. This moves beyond *reacting* to bursts, and instead *prepares* for them, optimizing resource allocation and potentially reducing latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Workload Model:**

*   **Data Sources:** System logs (work request types, arrival times, target identifiers), historical performance data, potentially external data sources (e.g., scheduled events, user behavior patterns).
*   **Model Type:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTM excels at time-series prediction.  Alternatively, a Transformer model could be employed.
*   **Training:** Continuous online learning. The model is retrained periodically (e.g., every hour) with new data to adapt to changing workload patterns.
*   **Output:** Predicted workload intensity for each work target over a short time horizon (e.g., next 5 minutes), expressed as an expected number of work requests per unit time.  Confidence intervals should also be provided, indicating the model’s uncertainty.

**2. Dynamic Token Bucket Adjustment:**

*   **Maximum Token Population Modulation:**  The maximum token population of both normal-mode *and* burst-mode buckets is dynamically adjusted based on the predictive model's output.
    *   **High Predicted Workload:** Increase maximum token population (within predefined limits) to allow for larger bursts.
    *   **Low Predicted Workload:** Decrease maximum token population to conserve resources.
*   **Refill Rate Modulation:**  Refill rates of both buckets are adjusted proportionally to the predicted workload.
*   **Confidence-Based Adjustment:**  The degree of adjustment is influenced by the confidence interval from the predictive model.  Higher confidence = bolder adjustment; lower confidence = more conservative adjustment.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Monitoring Service:** A dedicated service monitors incoming work requests, collects relevant data, and feeds it to the predictive model.
*   **Control Plane:** A control plane component receives predictions from the model, calculates optimal token bucket parameters, and updates the token bucket configurations on the relevant computing devices.
*   **API Integration:** A well-defined API allows other services to query the current token bucket parameters for a specific work target.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Monitoring Service
ON WorkRequestReceived(request):
    CollectData(request)
    SendToPredictiveModel(data)

// Predictive Model
ON DataReceived(data):
    PredictWorkload(data)
    CalculateConfidenceInterval(prediction)
    Return Prediction, ConfidenceInterval

// Control Plane
ON PredictionReceived(prediction, confidenceInterval):
    target = prediction.target
    predictedWorkload = prediction.workload
    confidence = confidenceInterval.confidence

    // Calculate Adjustment Factor
    adjustmentFactor = predictedWorkload * (1 + confidence) // Confidence boosts adjustment

    // Calculate New Max Token Population
    newMaxTokenPopulation = target.defaultMaxTokenPopulation * adjustmentFactor
    newMaxTokenPopulation = clamp(newMaxTokenPopulation, MIN_TOKEN_POPULATION, MAX_TOKEN_POPULATION)

    // Calculate New Refill Rate
    newRefillRate = target.defaultRefillRate * adjustmentFactor

    // Update Token Bucket Configuration
    UpdateTokenBucket(target, newMaxTokenPopulation, newRefillRate)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Resource Prioritization:** Extend the model to predict resource contention. Adjust token buckets not only based on request volume but also on the expected demand for shared resources.
*   **Cost-Awareness:** Integrate pricing information into the model. Dynamically adjust token bucket parameters to optimize cost while meeting performance targets.
*   **Real-Time Feedback Loop:**  Monitor actual performance after each adjustment.  Use this data to refine the predictive model and improve the accuracy of future adjustments.
