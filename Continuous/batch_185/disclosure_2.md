## Adaptive Communication Queuing with Predictive Sentiment Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the patent’s bipartite graph and matching system to incorporate *real-time* sentiment analysis of incoming contact requests and dynamically adjust queuing priorities. This moves beyond simply matching agents to contacts, and proactively prioritizes contacts expressing high negative sentiment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sentiment Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time audio stream (or text transcript if available) from incoming contact requests.
*   **Processing:** Utilize a pre-trained (and continuously fine-tuned) sentiment analysis model (e.g., BERT-based) to assess sentiment score (ranging from -1 to 1).  The model should identify keywords indicative of frustration, urgency, or distress.
*   **Output:** Sentiment score & associated keyword flags for each incoming contact request.  Data is packaged as a metadata payload.

**2. Enhanced Bipartite Graph:**

*   **Node Expansion:** Add a ‘Sentiment Weight’ attribute to each contact node within the bipartite graph. This weight is initialized to 0 and dynamically updated by the Sentiment Analysis Module.
*   **Edge Weight Modification:** Modify the edge weighting calculation to incorporate the Sentiment Weight. A higher Sentiment Weight (more negative sentiment) *increases* the edge weight, giving those contacts higher priority in the matching process.
    *   `New Edge Weight = Base Edge Weight + (Sentiment Weight * Sentiment Multiplier)`
        *   `Sentiment Multiplier`: A tunable parameter controlling the impact of sentiment on matching priority.

**3. Dynamic Queuing System:**

*   **Real-time Graph Updates:** The bipartite graph is continuously updated as new contact requests arrive and sentiment scores are calculated.
*   **Priority Queues:** Implement multiple priority queues based on Sentiment Weight thresholds.  Contacts with higher negative sentiment are placed in higher priority queues.
*   **Matching Rule Modification:** The matching rules are adjusted to prioritize agents with skills aligned with the *reason for contact* *and* the sentiment of the contact.
*   **Agent Skill Expansion:** Add “Emotional Intelligence” as a skill attribute for agents. This skill boosts the edge weight when matching agents with high negative sentiment contacts.

**4.  Pseudocode for Matching Process:**

```pseudocode
function MatchAgentToContact(bipartiteGraph, contactQueue):
  for each contact in contactQueue:
    contactNode = bipartiteGraph.getNode(contact.id)
    sentimentWeight = contactNode.sentimentWeight
    
    eligibleAgents = []
    for each agentNode in bipartiteGraph.agentNodes:
      if agentNode.skills contains contact.reasonForContact:
        eligibleAgents.append(agentNode)

    # Sort eligible agents based on edge weight (including sentiment boost)
    sortedAgents = sorted(eligibleAgents, key=lambda agent: bipartiteGraph.getEdgeWeight(agent, contactNode))

    if sortedAgents:
      assignedAgent = sortedAgents[0]
      # Assign contact to agent and remove from queue
      assignContactToAgent(contact, assignedAgent)
      removeContactFromQueue(contact)
    else:
      # No matching agent found.  Escalate or place in overflow queue.
      escalateContact(contact)
```

**5.  Data Structures:**

*   `ContactNode`:
    *   `id`: Unique Contact Identifier
    *   `reasonForContact`: Category of issue
    *   `sentimentWeight`:  Real-time Sentiment Score
*   `AgentNode`:
    *   `id`: Unique Agent Identifier
    *   `skills`: List of skills (e.g., technical support, billing, emotional support)
*   `BipartiteGraph`:
    *   `agentNodes`: List of AgentNodes
    *   `contactNodes`: List of ContactNodes
    *   `edges`: Dictionary mapping (agentNode, contactNode) to edge weight.

**6. Scalability:**

*   Utilize a distributed graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to handle a large number of agents and contacts.
*   Implement caching mechanisms to reduce latency in graph updates and edge weight calculations.
*   Employ a message queue (e.g., Kafka) to handle real-time sentiment analysis requests and graph updates.
