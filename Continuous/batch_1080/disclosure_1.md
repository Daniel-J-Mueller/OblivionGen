## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Layer for Virtual Item Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the visual/auditory discovery system by layering in dynamic, localized haptic feedback delivered via a wearable haptic suit or glove system. This creates a more immersive and intuitive interaction experience, allowing users to 'feel' the virtual items as they explore them, even before high-resolution details are loaded.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Suit/Glove Integration:** System requires compatibility with commercially available or custom-built haptic suits/gloves capable of delivering localized pressure, vibration, and texture simulation.
*   **Proximity-Based Haptics:** As the user visually focuses on a low-resolution virtual item (as determined by VR headset tracking data), the system transmits a basic haptic signature to the corresponding body part (e.g., hand, arm). This signature is determined by a pre-defined 'object class' associated with the item (e.g., 'smooth', 'rough', 'bumpy', 'soft').
*   **Dynamic Haptic Detail Scaling:** As the user requests higher resolution (via gaze, gesture, or voice command), the haptic feedback becomes increasingly detailed. This is achieved by activating more haptic actuators and modulating their intensity and frequency. A mapping function correlates resolution level to haptic complexity.
*   **Material Property Simulation:** The system maintains a database of material properties (e.g., hardness, elasticity, temperature) for each virtual item. As the resolution increases, these properties are translated into corresponding haptic sensations.
*   **Collision Detection & Force Feedback:** Integrate collision detection within the VR environment. When the user’s virtual hand ‘touches’ an item, the system applies appropriate force feedback to the haptic suit, simulating the sensation of touching a physical object.
*   **Procedural Haptic Generation:** For items with limited pre-defined haptic data, employ procedural generation algorithms to create realistic haptic sensations based on visual characteristics (e.g., surface normals, textures).
*   **User-Customizable Haptic Profiles:** Allow users to adjust the intensity and sensitivity of haptic feedback to suit their preferences.
*   **Data Streaming & Synchronization:** Implement a low-latency data streaming protocol to synchronize visual, auditory, and haptic feedback.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (VR Headset Tracking Data Available) {
    // Get User Gaze/Hand Position
    userGaze = GetUserGaze();
    userHandPosition = GetUserHandPosition();

    // Identify Nearby Virtual Items
    nearbyItems = GetNearbyItems(userGaze, userHandPosition);

    for each (item in nearbyItems) {
        // Determine Item Resolution Level
        resolutionLevel = GetItemResolutionLevel(item);

        // Generate Haptic Signature
        hapticSignature = GenerateHapticSignature(item, resolutionLevel);

        // Transmit Haptic Feedback to Haptic Suit
        TransmitHapticFeedback(hapticSignature, hapticSuit);

        // Detect Collisions
        if (DetectCollision(userHandPosition, item)) {
            // Calculate Force Feedback
            forceFeedback = CalculateForceFeedback(item);
            TransmitForceFeedback(forceFeedback, hapticSuit);
        }
    }
}

// Function: GenerateHapticSignature
function GenerateHapticSignature(item, resolutionLevel) {
    // Determine object class (e.g., 'smooth', 'rough')
    objectClass = GetObjectClass(item);

    // Scale haptic complexity based on resolution level
    hapticComplexity = ScaleHapticComplexity(resolutionLevel);

    // Generate haptic signature based on object class and complexity
    signature = GenerateSignature(objectClass, hapticComplexity);

    return signature;
}
