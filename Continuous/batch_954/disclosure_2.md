## Dynamic Predictive Warm Input Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the “warm input” concept by dynamically sharding a single media stream across multiple warm inputs, each predicting slightly different future segments. This facilitates *instantaneous* switching not just between inputs, but *within* a single input, minimizing latency and maximizing responsiveness during live streams or VOD.

**Specs:**

*   **System Architecture:** A primary “Control Plane” manages a pool of “Warm Input Shards.” Each shard operates as defined in the base patent (receiving, demuxing, caching IDR/reference frames). The Control Plane monitors stream characteristics (bitrate, keyframe interval, content complexity).
*   **Predictive Sharding Algorithm:** The Control Plane uses a predictive algorithm (potentially leveraging a trained neural network – see existing claim 12) to anticipate future segments of the stream.  It assigns each shard to *predictively cache* a different potential segment.
*   **Segment Granularity:** Segments are defined as a variable-length sequence of GOPs, adjusted dynamically based on stream analysis. Shorter segments = lower latency, higher overhead. Longer segments = higher latency, lower overhead.
*   **Segment Overlap:** Adjacent shards maintain a degree of overlap in their cached segments (e.g., sharing the last two GOPs). This ensures smooth transitions.
*   **Client Request Handling:** Upon client request (e.g., seeking, fast-forwarding), the Control Plane identifies the shard with the closest matching cached segment.
*   **Seamless Switching:** The Control Plane directs the client to the selected shard.  The shard immediately begins decoding from its cached segment, bypassing the typical decoding delay.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The Control Plane continuously monitors client requests and stream characteristics. It dynamically adjusts the sharding strategy (number of shards, segment length, overlap) to optimize performance.
*   **Shard Health Monitoring:** The Control Plane monitors the health of each shard (CPU usage, memory usage, decoding latency). It automatically redistributes workload if a shard becomes overloaded.

**Pseudocode (Control Plane – Shard Assignment):**

```
FUNCTION AssignShard(clientRequest, streamCharacteristics):
  // 1. Determine the desired segment start time from clientRequest
  segmentStartTime = clientRequest.startTime

  // 2. Predict the probability distribution of potential segments
  //    based on streamCharacteristics (e.g., bitrate variations)
  segmentProbabilities = PredictSegmentProbabilities(streamCharacteristics)

  // 3. Identify the shard with the most likely matching segment
  bestShard = NULL
  maxProbability = 0
  FOR EACH shard IN shardPool:
    IF shard.cachedSegmentStartTime <= segmentStartTime AND
       shard.cachedSegmentEndTime >= segmentStartTime:
      IF segmentProbabilities[shard.cachedSegmentStartTime] > maxProbability:
        maxProbability = segmentProbabilities[shard.cachedSegmentStartTime]
        bestShard = shard

  // 4. If no suitable shard is found, allocate a new one and populate it.
  IF bestShard == NULL:
    bestShard = AllocateNewShard(segmentStartTime)
    PopulateShard(bestShard, segmentStartTime)

  RETURN bestShard
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Machine Learning for Prediction:** Train a neural network to predict future stream characteristics (bitrate, keyframe intervals, content complexity).
*   **Adaptive Segment Length:** Dynamically adjust segment length based on stream characteristics and client network conditions.
*   **Content-Aware Sharding:** Shard based on content type (e.g., action scenes, dialogue scenes).
*   **Geographic Sharding:** Distribute shards across multiple geographic locations to reduce latency for clients worldwide.
*   **Integration with CDN:** Integrate with a CDN to cache shards closer to clients.
