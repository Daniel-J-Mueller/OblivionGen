## Adaptive Segment Granularity & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the segmenting/hashing approach to be *dynamic* based on content complexity and user viewing patterns, combined with a predictive prefetching system. This moves beyond simply distributing segments evenly and aims to optimize both storage *and* playback experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Mezzanine file.
*   **Process:**
    *   Scene detection: Identify scene changes within the video.
    *   Motion vector analysis: Quantify the amount of motion in each scene.  High motion = higher bitrate requirement.
    *   Complexity scoring: Assign a "complexity score" to each scene based on motion vectors, color variation, and object density.
*   **Output:** Scene list with associated complexity scores.

**2. Adaptive Segmentation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Mezzanine file, Scene list with complexity scores, Target storage bandwidth, Target playback bandwidth.
*   **Process:**
    *   Variable segment duration:  Segments are created with durations proportional to the sceneâ€™s complexity score.  High complexity = shorter segments, allowing for more frequent updates/lower latency. Low complexity = longer segments, reducing overhead.
    *   Segment boundary optimization: Segment boundaries are preferentially placed at scene changes to minimize visual disruption during seeking/switching.
    *   Hashing: Employ the existing filename hashing approach, but incorporate the segment duration into the hash algorithm to ensure uniqueness.
*   **Output:** Segmented mezzanine file with variable segment durations, associated metadata (duration, complexity score, hash).

**3. Predictive Prefetching Service:**

*   **Input:** User viewing history, Current playback position, Segment metadata (complexity score, duration), Network bandwidth.
*   **Process:**
    *   Pattern recognition: Analyze user viewing patterns (seeking, rewatching, skipping).
    *   Complexity-aware prefetching: Prefetch segments based on predicted viewing behavior *and* segment complexity.  Higher complexity segments are prefetched earlier to account for potential encoding/decoding delays.
    *   Bandwidth adaptation: Adjust prefetching rate based on available network bandwidth.
    *   Prefetch queue management: Maintain a prioritized queue of segments to be prefetched, balancing anticipated need with available resources.
*   **Output:** Prefetched segments available for immediate playback.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Prefetching Service):**

```
function prefetch_segments(user_history, current_position, segment_metadata, network_bandwidth):
  // Calculate predicted next segment based on user history
  predicted_segment = predict_next_segment(user_history, current_position)

  // Calculate prefetch priority based on complexity, distance from current position, and network bandwidth
  priority = calculate_prefetch_priority(predicted_segment.complexity,
                                            predicted_segment.distance,
                                            network_bandwidth)

  // Add segment to prefetch queue with calculated priority
  add_to_prefetch_queue(predicted_segment, priority)

  // Process prefetch queue, downloading segments as bandwidth allows
  while queue_not_empty() and bandwidth_available():
    next_segment = get_next_segment_from_queue()
    download_segment(next_segment)
```

**Storage implications:** While more metadata is required to track segment durations and complexities, the optimization of playback and reduced latency could justify the increased storage overhead. The dynamic segmenting could also lead to a more efficient utilization of storage capacity, particularly for variable bitrate content.
