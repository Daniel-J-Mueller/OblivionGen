## Personalized Predictive Purchasing Frames

**Concept:** Extend the display object functionality beyond simple transaction facilitation. Introduce a "Predictive Purchasing Frame" that anticipates user needs *within* the merchant site context, using behavioral data and contextual awareness, presenting proactive purchasing options directly within the merchant's page layout.

**Specs:**

*   **Frame Integration:** The Predictive Purchasing Frame integrates seamlessly within the merchant site's page layout, appearing as a dynamic, resizable frame element. Initial size configurable via merchant API.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **User Profile:** Access existing user account data (name, shipping, payment) via the core service (as defined in the patent).
    *   **Behavioral Data:** Track user browsing history *on the current merchant site* (products viewed, time spent on pages, search queries).
    *   **Contextual Data:** Analyze the current page content (product category, keywords, related items).
    *   **External Data (Optional):** Integrate with external data sources (weather, time of day, social media trends) via merchant-configured API keys.
*   **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model, hosted on the core service servers, analyzes the combined data streams to predict:
    *   **Complementary Products:** Suggest items frequently purchased *with* the currently viewed product. (e.g., phone case with phone, batteries with remote)
    *   **Replenishment Needs:** Identify consumable items nearing depletion based on purchase history and usage patterns. (e.g., coffee pods, printer ink)
    *   **Related Products (Cross-Sell):** Recommend items in similar categories or that address related needs.
*   **Frame Content:** The frame displays predicted products as visually appealing cards or tiles.
    *   **Product Image:** High-resolution product image.
    *   **Product Title:** Concise product title.
    *   **Price:** Current price.
    *   **"Add to Cart" Button:** Direct link to add the product to the merchant's cart.
    *   **Confidence Score (Optional):** Display a confidence score indicating the likelihood of the user being interested in the product. (e.g., "85% likely you'll need this!")
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to customize the Predictive Purchasing Frame:
    *   **Dismissal:** Ability to dismiss individual product recommendations.
    *   **Category Filtering:** Option to filter recommendations by product category.
    *   **Frequency Control:** Control the frequency of new recommendations.
*   **Merchant Control:** Provide merchants with APIs to:
    *   **Configure Frame Appearance:** Customize the frame's colors, fonts, and layout.
    *   **Set Recommendation Weighting:** Prioritize certain types of recommendations (e.g., complementary products vs. cross-sell).
    *   **Blacklist Products:** Exclude specific products from being recommended.
*   **Data Privacy:** All data collection and usage must comply with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Users must be informed about data collection practices and given the option to opt out.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predictProducts(userId, merchantId, currentProductId, pageContent) {
  userProfile = getUserProfile(userId);
  userBehavior = getUserBehavior(userId, merchantId);
  contextualData = analyzePageContent(pageContent);

  combinedData = mergeData(userProfile, userBehavior, contextualData);

  // Machine Learning Model (e.g., Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering)
  predictedProducts = runMLModel(combinedData);

  // Filter and Rank Products
  filteredProducts = filterProducts(predictedProducts, userProfile.preferences);
  rankedProducts = rankProducts(filteredProducts, userBehavior.recentViews);

  return rankedProducts;
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply facilitating transactions; it proactively anticipates user needs within the merchantâ€™s site, enhancing the shopping experience and driving incremental sales. The integration of contextual data and machine learning enables highly personalized and relevant recommendations, going beyond simple cross-selling.
