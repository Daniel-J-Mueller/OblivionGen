## Dynamic Endpoint Virtualization with Address Space Isolation

**Concept:** Leverage the PCI switch topology to create dynamically virtualized endpoints with isolated address spaces, allowing multiple, seemingly independent devices to share physical hardware resources while maintaining robust security and preventing conflicts.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   PCI Switch: Modified PCI switch capable of hardware-based address space isolation and remapping. Requires additional registers to define virtual endpoint mappings.
    *   Endpoint Devices: Standard PCI endpoint devices.
    *   Root Complex: Standard root complex.
*   **Software:**
    *   Hypervisor/Driver: A lightweight hypervisor or specialized driver running on the root complex to manage virtual endpoints and their address spaces.
    *   Virtual Endpoint Manager (VEM): Software component responsible for creating, configuring, and destroying virtual endpoints.
*   **Address Space Isolation Mechanism:**
    *   Each physical PCI endpoint is assigned a base address range.
    *   The VEM creates multiple virtual endpoints, each with a unique, isolated address range within the physical endpoint's base range.
    *   The PCI switch utilizes a mapping table to translate virtual addresses from the virtual endpoints to the physical addresses of the underlying hardware.
    *   The switch enforces access control based on these mappings, preventing virtual endpoints from accessing each other's memory or resources.

**Pseudocode (VEM - Virtual Endpoint Manager):**

```
// Function: CreateVirtualEndpoint
// Parameters: physicalEndpointID, virtualEndpointID, baseAddress, size
function CreateVirtualEndpoint(physicalEndpointID, virtualEndpointID, baseAddress, size) {
  // Allocate a portion of the physical endpoint's address space
  allocatedAddressRange = AllocateAddressRange(physicalEndpointID, baseAddress, size);

  // Create a mapping entry in the PCI switch
  SwitchMappingEntry = CreateSwitchMappingEntry(virtualEndpointID, allocatedAddressRange);

  // Configure the virtual endpoint's registers with the virtual address range
  ConfigureVirtualEndpointRegisters(virtualEndpointID, virtualAddressRange);

  return virtualEndpointID;
}

// Function: DestroyVirtualEndpoint
// Parameters: virtualEndpointID
function DestroyVirtualEndpoint(virtualEndpointID) {
  // Retrieve the allocated address range from the switch mapping
  allocatedAddressRange = GetAddressRangeFromMapping(virtualEndpointID);

  // Deallocate the address range
  DeallocateAddressRange(allocatedAddressRange);

  // Remove the mapping entry from the switch
  RemoveMappingEntry(virtualEndpointID);
}

//Function: Remap Virtual Endpoint Address Space
//Parameters: VirtualEndpointID, newBaseAddress, newSize
function RemapVirtualEndpointAddressSpace(VirtualEndpointID, newBaseAddress, newSize) {
    //Get original allocation
    originalAllocation = GetAddressRangeFromMapping(VirtualEndpointID);

    //Deallocate old space
    DeallocateAddressRange(originalAllocation);

    //Allocate new space
    newAllocation = AllocateAddressRange(PhysicalEndpointID, newBaseAddress, newSize);

    //Update switch mapping
    UpdateMappingEntry(VirtualEndpointID, newAllocation);
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  The VEM receives a request to create a new virtual endpoint.
2.  The VEM allocates a portion of the physical endpoint's address space.
3.  The VEM programs the PCI switch with a mapping entry that associates the virtual endpoint's address range with the allocated physical address range.
4.  The virtual endpoint operates as if it has exclusive access to the allocated address range.
5.  When the virtual endpoint sends a transaction, the PCI switch translates the virtual address to the physical address before forwarding the transaction to the physical endpoint.
6.  Access control is enforced by the PCI switch to prevent virtual endpoints from accessing each other's memory.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Resource Sharing:** Multiple virtual endpoints can share a single physical endpoint, improving hardware utilization.
*   **Security:** Address space isolation prevents malicious or faulty virtual endpoints from compromising the entire system.
*   **Flexibility:** Virtual endpoints can be created and destroyed dynamically, allowing for flexible resource allocation.
*   **Compatibility:** Existing PCI endpoint devices can be virtualized without modification.
