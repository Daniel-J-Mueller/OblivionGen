## Adaptive Resource Mirroring with Predictive Failover

**Specification:** A system for proactively creating and maintaining mirrored computing resources based on predicted failure probabilities, extending beyond reactive disaster recovery. This goes beyond simply replicating VMs; it dynamically adjusts the level of mirroring based on real-time and historical data.

**Components:**

*   **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical failure data (component failures, network outages, regional events) and real-time telemetry (CPU load, memory usage, network latency). Outputs a “Failure Probability Score” (FPS) for each resource.
*   **Mirroring Manager:** Controls the creation and maintenance of resource mirrors. Operates based on FPS thresholds.
*   **Resource Mirror:** A replica of a primary resource, hosted in a separate data region.
*   **Traffic Director:** Manages traffic routing, seamlessly switching between primary and mirrored resources.
*   **Cost Optimizer:** Analyzes the cost of maintaining different levels of mirroring and adjusts mirroring levels to balance cost and risk.

**Operation:**

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The Prediction Engine continuously monitors resources and calculates the FPS.
2.  **Dynamic Mirroring:**
    *   **Low FPS (0-30%):** Minimal mirroring.  Only critical data replicated.  Snapshots taken periodically.
    *   **Medium FPS (31-70%):** Partial mirroring. Core application components replicated.  Data replication ongoing.  Warm standby.
    *   **High FPS (71-100%):** Full mirroring. All resources replicated.  Active/active configuration.  Real-time data replication.
3.  **Predictive Failover:** If the FPS exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the system *proactively* initiates a controlled failover to the mirrored resources *before* an actual failure occurs. This minimizes downtime and data loss.
4.  **Traffic Redirection:** The Traffic Director seamlessly redirects traffic to the mirrored resources.
5.  **Post-Failover Analysis:** After a failover (predictive or reactive), the system analyzes the cause of the failure and adjusts the Prediction Engine and mirroring levels accordingly.
6. **Cost Optimization:** The Cost Optimizer regularly analyzes mirroring levels and adjusts them to minimize cost while maintaining acceptable risk levels.

**Pseudocode (Mirroring Manager):**

```
function manage_mirroring(resource, fps):
  if fps < 30:
    mirroring_level = "minimal"
  elif fps < 70:
    mirroring_level = "partial"
  else:
    mirroring_level = "full"

  adjust_mirroring(resource, mirroring_level)

function adjust_mirroring(resource, level):
  if level == "minimal":
    create_snapshot(resource)
    deallocate_vm(resource_mirror)
  elif level == "partial":
    restore_snapshot(resource)
    allocate_vm(resource_mirror)
    start_data_replication(resource, resource_mirror)
  elif level == "full":
    ensure_vm_running(resource_mirror)
    enable_realtime_replication(resource, resource_mirror)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Resource`: Represents a computing resource (VM, database, etc.).  Contains information about its status, location, and dependencies.
*   `FailureProbabilityScore`: A numerical value representing the probability of failure.
*   `MirroringLevel`:  An enumeration representing the level of mirroring (minimal, partial, full).

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond reactive disaster recovery by incorporating predictive analysis and dynamic mirroring. This allows for proactive failover, minimizing downtime and data loss, and optimizing resource utilization. It isn't simply about replicating VMs, but intelligently adapting the level of replication based on risk and cost.
