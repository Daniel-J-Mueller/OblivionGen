## Dynamic Regex Assembly with Learned Symbol Pruning

**Concept:** Extend the symbol substitution concept to *dynamically* assemble regular expressions *during* processing, guided by a learned pruning strategy. This moves beyond simple substitution to a form of just-in-time regex construction, optimizing for common input patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Pattern Historian:**
   *   **Function:** Collects and analyzes input character streams. Maintains a rolling window of recently processed character sequences.
   *   **Data Structure:** A trie (prefix tree) storing character sequence frequencies. Nodes represent characters, and edges indicate sequence continuation. Each node stores a frequency count.
   *   **Learning Rate:**  Adjustable parameter controlling how quickly new patterns are added and existing patterns updated.
   *   **Pruning Threshold:** Adjustable parameter determining the minimum frequency for a pattern to be retained. Below this threshold, the pattern is removed from the trie.

**2. Dynamic Regex Assembler:**
   *   **Input:** Incoming character stream and the Pattern Historian trie.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  **Prefix Search:** For each incoming character, search the Pattern Historian trie for the longest matching prefix.
        2.  **Symbol Allocation:** If a match is found *and* the prefix frequency exceeds a defined threshold:
            *   Allocate a unique symbol to represent the matched prefix.
            *   Replace the matched prefix in the input stream with the symbol.
        3.  **Regex Construction:**  A miniature regex engine dynamically constructs a regex using the allocated symbols and literal characters. The core regex engine remains unchanged.
        4.  **Fallback:** If no matching prefix is found, or the frequency is below the threshold, the character is treated as a literal.
   *   **Output:** Modified character stream with symbol substitutions and dynamically constructed regex.

**3. Symbol Management Unit:**
   *   **Symbol Table:**  Maintains a mapping between symbols and their corresponding character sequences.  Symbol allocation is handled sequentially, but can be expanded to a more sophisticated scheme.
   *   **Symbol Lifetime:** Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache for symbols.  Infrequently used symbols are removed from the table to conserve memory.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
function process_stream(input_stream):
    output_stream = ""
    for char in input_stream:
        longest_prefix = find_longest_prefix(char, pattern_historian)

        if longest_prefix != null and frequency(longest_prefix) > threshold:
            symbol = allocate_symbol(longest_prefix)
            output_stream += symbol
            update_pattern_historian(longest_prefix)
        else:
            output_stream += char

    return output_stream

function find_longest_prefix(char, pattern_historian):
    // Trie traversal to find the longest matching prefix starting with 'char'
    // Returns the longest prefix found, or null if no match
    ...

function allocate_symbol(prefix):
    // Check if a symbol already exists for the prefix
    // If not, allocate a new symbol and add the prefix to the symbol table
    ...

function update_pattern_historian(prefix):
    // Increment the frequency of the prefix in the pattern historian
    ...
```

**5. Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Trie Implementation:** A highly parallelized tree structure for fast prefix searches.
*   **Symbol Table:** A content-addressable memory (CAM) for fast symbol lookups.
*   **Parallel Processing:**  The prefix search and symbol allocation can be heavily parallelized for increased throughput.

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond static symbol substitution. The dynamic regex assembly adapts to the input data, potentially creating more efficient and compact regular expressions. The learning component allows the system to optimize for common patterns, reducing processing overhead. The architecture facilitates hardware acceleration for real-time performance. This introduces a new dimension of adaptability into regular expression processing.
