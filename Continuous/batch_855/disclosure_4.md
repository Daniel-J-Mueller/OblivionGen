## Dynamic IPA Granularity & Adaptive TLB Coherency

**Concept:** Extend the IPA translation buffer not just as a pointer *to* a TLB entry, but as a descriptor of a *region* within the TLB’s set, defining granular coherency control. Current systems largely operate on full line invalidation. This system allows for per-region invalidation *within* a TLB set.

**Specifications:**

*   **IPA Translation Buffer Entry Structure:**
    *   `BasePointer`: Pointer to the *start* of a region within a TLB set.
    *   `RegionSize`:  Indicates the number of TLB entries the region occupies (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8 – power of 2).
    *   `CoherencyTag`: A tag indicating the coherency state of the region (Valid, Invalid, Modified).
    *   `ProtectionFlags`: Standard memory protection bits (Read/Write/Execute).

*   **TLB Entry Modification:** Add a field `RegionID` to each TLB entry, identifying which region within the set it belongs to.

*   **Page Table Walker Modification:** When populating the IPA translation buffer and TLB, the walker divides the guest physical address space into regions (configurable size, defaults to 4KB or 8KB) and maps these regions to the defined `RegionSize` within a TLB set.

*   **Translation Manager Operation:**
    *   **Receive IPA:** Receives an IPA from the hypervisor requiring modification.
    *   **Determine Region:** Extracts the region identifier from the IPA.
    *   **Access IPA Translation Buffer:** Locates the corresponding entry in the IPA translation buffer using the region identifier.
    *   **Coherency Check:**
        *   If `CoherencyTag` is Invalid, the region is already invalidated. No further action needed.
        *   If `CoherencyTag` is Valid or Modified, proceed to invalidate the specific TLB entries *within* that region based on the `RegionID`.
    *   **TLB Invalidation:** Iterates through the relevant TLB entries within the specified region, invalidating them. Updates the `CoherencyTag` in the IPA translation buffer to Invalid.

*   **Writeback Mechanism:** When a modified entry needs to be written back to memory, the system identifies the region it belongs to and can potentially coalesce writebacks within that region to improve performance.

**Pseudocode (Translation Manager):**

```
function invalidate_tlb_entry(IPA):
  region_id = extract_region_id(IPA)
  itb_entry = lookup_ipa_translation_buffer(region_id)

  if itb_entry.CoherencyTag == "Invalid":
    return // Already invalid

  // Mark region as invalid
  itb_entry.CoherencyTag = "Invalid"

  // Invalidate TLB entries within the region
  for each tlb_entry in TLB:
    if tlb_entry.RegionID == region_id:
      tlb_entry.Valid = false

  // Optionally, trigger writeback of modified entries in the region
  trigger_writeback(region_id)
```

**Rationale:** Reduces TLB shootdowns by invalidating only the necessary entries, especially crucial in heavily virtualized environments with frequent address space changes. Enables finer-grained memory protection and coherency control.  Can potentially improve performance by reducing cache contention and minimizing the impact of TLB misses.
