## Dynamic Data Provenance & Attestation Layer

**Concept:** Extend the data auditing system with a dynamic provenance and attestation layer that doesn't just *detect* discrepancies, but actively traces the origin and transformation history of each data record *and* verifies the integrity of the systems that generated it. This moves beyond simple error detection to building trust and accountability in the data stream.

**Specs:**

*   **Provenance Graph:** Implement a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent the lineage of each data record. Nodes in the graph represent data transformations (e.g., aggregation, filtering, calculation). Edges represent the flow of data. Each node/edge stores metadata: timestamp, operator ID, transformation logic (hash), input/output data samples (hashes).
*   **Attestation Module:** Each data source & transformation operator integrates an attestation module leveraging Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or similar secure hardware. This module generates cryptographically signed attestations verifying the operator’s identity, software version, configuration, and runtime environment. Attestations are stored alongside provenance metadata.
*   **Dynamic Trust Scoring:** A real-time trust scoring system is applied to each data source/operator based on historical attestation data, provenance graph analysis (e.g., identifying circular dependencies, untrusted sources), and anomaly detection. Scores are dynamically updated.
*   **Policy Engine:** A policy engine defines trust thresholds and access controls based on data provenance, attestation scores, and user roles.  Access to sensitive data requires a sufficient trust level.
*   **Reconstruction Engine:**  Given a discrepancy, the reconstruction engine traverses the provenance graph to identify the root cause. It can reconstruct the data record’s history, pinpoint the compromised operator (if any), and offer mitigation options (e.g., re-processing from a trusted source).

**Pseudocode (Discrepancy Resolution):**

```
function resolveDiscrepancy(dataRecord, discrepancyType) {
  provenanceGraph = getProvenanceGraph(dataRecord);
  rootCause = traceRootCause(provenanceGraph, discrepancyType);

  if (rootCause.isCompromisedOperator()) {
    // Quarantine compromised operator
    quarantineOperator(rootCause.operatorId);

    // Re-process data from a trusted source
    reprocessedData = reprocessData(dataRecord, trustedSource);
    return reprocessedData;
  } else if (rootCause.isDataCorruption()) {
    // Attempt data recovery from backups
    recoveredData = recoverData(dataRecord);
    return recoveredData;
  } else {
    // Unknown cause - escalate to human review
    escalateToHumanReview(dataRecord);
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Secure hardware modules (TPM or equivalent) integrated into data sources and transformation operators.
*   Dedicated hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations (signing, verification).

**Software Requirements:**

*   Provenance graph database (e.g., Neo4j).
*   Attestation service.
*   Policy engine.
*   Secure communication channels between data sources, operators, and the attestation service.
*   Secure boot and runtime environment for all components.
