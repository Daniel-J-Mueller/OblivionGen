## Dynamic Pipeline Mutation for A/B Testing of Production Logic

**Concept:** Extend the test framework to allow *live* mutation of production pipeline stages for controlled A/B testing. Instead of simply testing isolated functions, inject entirely new logic paths into the production system *while it is running*, directing a small percentage of traffic through the mutated path.

**Motivation:** Current systems focus on pre-deployment testing. This allows for identifying bugs, but doesn't capture real-world user behavior and edge cases.  This system would allow for continuous, real-time optimization of production logic.  It moves beyond simple feature flags.

**Specs:**

**1. Pipeline Stage Abstraction Layer:**

*   All pipeline stages (e.g., authentication, pricing, inventory check, shipping calculation) must be defined as modular, replaceable units. Each stage exposes a standardized interface (input data schema, output data schema, execution function).
*   A 'Stage Registry' maintains available versions of each stage. Versions are uniquely identified (e.g., SHA256 hash of the code).
*   Stages can be configured to be 'immutable' (default) or 'mutable'. Mutable stages are eligible for live mutation.

**2. Mutation Controller:**

*   The central component responsible for managing mutations.
*   Allows users to define mutation rules. Rules specify:
    *   Stage ID to mutate.
    *   New Stage Version to inject.
    *   Traffic Allocation Percentage (0-100).
    *   Mutation Start/End Times (for temporary experiments).
    *   Target User Segment (e.g., based on demographics, location, purchase history).
*   Implements a 'Canary Deployment' strategy:  Initially, only a tiny percentage of traffic is routed through the mutated stage. Performance metrics are monitored.  If metrics are satisfactory, the traffic allocation percentage is gradually increased.
*   Provides an API for querying mutation status (active mutations, traffic allocation, performance metrics).

**3. Traffic Routing Mechanism:**

*   A lightweight 'Interceptor' component sits in front of the pipeline.
*   Based on the mutation rules and the incoming request, the Interceptor decides whether to route the request through the standard pipeline or the mutated pipeline.
*   The Interceptor uses a consistent hashing algorithm to ensure that requests for the same user are consistently routed through the same pipeline (important for maintaining session state).

**4.  Reversion Mechanism:**

*   A 'Kill Switch' allows immediate disabling of a mutation if issues are detected.
*   The system automatically logs all changes made by a mutation (e.g., database updates, API calls).
*   A 'Rollback' function allows reverting to the previous state of the system if a mutation causes problems.

**Pseudocode (Mutation Controller â€“ apply_mutation):**

```pseudocode
function apply_mutation(request, mutation_rule):
  if mutation_rule.is_active() and is_request_eligible(request, mutation_rule):
    hash_value = consistent_hash(request.user_id)
    if hash_value < mutation_rule.traffic_allocation_percentage:
      # Route request through mutated pipeline
      mutated_stage = stage_registry.get_stage(mutation_rule.stage_version)
      return mutated_stage.execute(request)
    else:
      # Route request through standard pipeline
      return standard_pipeline.execute(request)
  else:
    # Route request through standard pipeline
    return standard_pipeline.execute(request)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `MutationRule`:  {stage_id, stage_version, traffic_allocation_percentage, start_time, end_time, target_user_segment}
*   `StageMetadata`: {stage_id, version, code_hash, input_schema, output_schema}

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with A/B testing platforms (e.g., Optimizely, VWO).
*   Automated performance monitoring and anomaly detection.
*   Support for complex mutation scenarios (e.g., chained mutations).
*   Simulation of mutation effects before deployment.
