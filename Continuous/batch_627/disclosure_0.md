## Dynamic GUI Element “Weighting” Based on User Skill & Task Complexity

**Concept:** Instead of solely predicting the *next* action, this system aims to dynamically adjust the *prominence* (visual weight, size, color saturation, animation) of GUI elements based on a combination of user skill level *and* the complexity of the current task.  The underlying principle is to subtly guide experienced users while providing more overt assistance to novices, *within the same interface*.

**Specs:**

1.  **Skill Level Assessment:**
    *   Continuous monitoring of user interaction speed, accuracy, and frequency of help requests.
    *   Skill levels categorized (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) with associated weighting profiles.
    *   Skill level is a *per-feature* metric. A user might be an “Expert” in image editing but a “Beginner” in video rendering within the same application.

2.  **Task Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Real-time analysis of the current operation. This could involve counting the number of steps, parameters involved, or reliance on advanced features.
    *   Complexity levels categorized (e.g., Simple, Moderate, Complex).

3.  **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   `ElementWeight = BaseWeight + (SkillModifier * SkillLevel) + (ComplexityModifier * TaskComplexity)`
        *   `BaseWeight`: Default visual prominence of the element.
        *   `SkillModifier`:  Adjusts weight based on user skill – negative for skilled users (subtle), positive for beginners (obvious).
        *   `ComplexityModifier`:  Adjusts weight based on task complexity – positive for complex tasks (assistance), neutral for simple tasks.
    *   Element weight is mapped to visual attributes: size, color saturation, animation speed, transparency.

4.  **GUI Element Grouping & Compositing:**
    *   Related GUI elements are grouped into “composites”. For example, all image adjustment tools might form a composite.
    *   Weighting is applied *within* the composite.  Elements deemed more crucial for the current task receive higher weight, visually “popping” relative to others.

5.  **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   The system learns from user behavior. If a user consistently ignores a “highlighted” element, its SkillModifier is reduced.  If a user repeatedly requests help with a specific feature, its ComplexityModifier is increased.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function calculateElementWeight(element, userSkillLevel, taskComplexity):
  baseWeight = element.defaultWeight
  skillModifier = element.skillModifier
  complexityModifier = element.complexityModifier

  elementWeight = baseWeight + (skillModifier * userSkillLevel) + (complexityModifier * taskComplexity)

  return elementWeight

function updateGUI():
  for each element in GUI:
    elementWeight = calculateElementWeight(element, currentUser.skillLevel[currentFeature], currentTask.complexity)
    element.size = map(elementWeight, minWeight, maxWeight, minSize, maxSize)
    element.colorSaturation = map(elementWeight, minWeight, maxWeight, minSaturation, maxSaturation)
    // apply other visual attributes based on elementWeight

```

**Example:**

An expert user editing a simple image might see muted, minimalist interface elements. A beginner performing a complex video edit would see larger, brighter, more animated elements guiding them through the process.
