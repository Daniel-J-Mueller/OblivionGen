## Adaptive Resolution Masking for Dynamic Memory Access

**Concept:** Extend the shifting hardware concept to enable dynamic, per-access masking of memory addresses, allowing for variable-granularity access control and improved memory security. Instead of fixed-size regions, the masking adapts *during* a read/write cycle based on access permissions or memory state.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrate a configurable shift register network alongside the existing shifting hardware. This network will be programmable *during* the address decoding phase.
*   **Configuration Register:** Add a “Mask Configuration Register” (MCR). The MCR will receive data indicating the shift amount *and* the mask value (all 1s, alternating 1/0, custom pattern). This data can come from a security module, a memory controller, or a dedicated permission engine.
*   **Dynamic Mask Generation:** The configurable shift register network will receive the constant input (logical high) and the MCR data. It will output a dynamic mask based on the configured shift amount and mask value.
*   **Multi-Level Masking:** Allow for the MCR to specify not just a shift amount, but also a 'mask resolution'. This resolution dictates how many bits of the generated mask are actually applied to the address. This allows for fine-grained masking - masking only the lower 4 bits, or the upper 8, for example.
*   **Address Combination:** The dynamic mask is XORed with the transaction address *before* being fed into the combinatorial logic. The output of this XOR determines if the access is permitted.
*   **Security Module Integration:** A dedicated security module will be responsible for populating the MCR with appropriate values based on access control policies and memory state.
*   **Parallel Implementation:** This system is designed for parallel implementation, enabling multiple address regions to be masked independently.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Inputs:
// transaction_address: The address being accessed
// base_address: The base address of the region
// mcr_data: Mask Configuration Register data (shift amount, mask value, resolution)

// 1. Extract shift_amount, mask_value, resolution from mcr_data

// 2. Generate dynamic_mask using configurable shift register network:
//    - Shift constant (logical high) by shift_amount
//    - Apply mask_value to the shifted result

// 3. XOR transaction_address with dynamic_mask:
//    xor_result = transaction_address XOR dynamic_mask

// 4. Limit the application of the mask to the specified resolution
//    resolution_mask = (2^resolution - 1) // Create a mask for the resolution
//    final_mask = resolution_mask & dynamic_mask

// 5. Combine final_mask with base address using XOR operation
//    combined_address = base_address XOR xor_result

// 6. Pass combined_address to combinatorial logic for access control
//    if (combinatorial_logic(combined_address)) then:
//       access granted
//    else:
//       access denied
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Fine-grained memory protection:** Protect sensitive data at the bit level.
*   **Dynamic memory segmentation:** Adjust memory region sizes on the fly.
*   **Hardware-assisted sandboxing:** Isolate processes and prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Secure DMA:** Control access to memory regions during DMA operations.
