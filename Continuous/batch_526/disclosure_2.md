## Semantic Drift Detection & Prediction for Product Descriptions

**Concept:** Extend the duplicate detection system to not just identify *current* duplicates, but to predict future near-duplicates arising from incremental product updates and evolving language. This leverages the attribute comparison engine to track “semantic drift” – how much the *meaning* of a product description changes over time, even with superficial edits.

**Specification:**

1.  **Temporal Attribute Vectors:** Each product description will have a series of timestamped attribute vectors. Instead of a single snapshot, the system maintains a historical record of attribute values. For example:

    ```
    Product ID: 12345
    Timestamp: 2024-01-01
    Attributes: {Color: "Red", Size: "Large", Material: "Cotton"}

    Timestamp: 2024-01-15
    Attributes: {Color: "Crimson", Size: "Large", Material: "Organic Cotton"}
    ```

2.  **Drift Calculation:** A "drift score" is calculated between consecutive attribute vectors for each product. This score isn't a simple difference count. It’s weighted based on the *semantic distance* between attribute values. For example, "Red" to "Crimson" has a lower semantic distance than "Red" to "Blue". Pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT) will be used to calculate these distances.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_drift(attributes_old, attributes_new):
      drift_score = 0
      for attribute_name in attributes_old.keys():
        if attribute_name in attributes_new:
          value_old = attributes_old[attribute_name]
          value_new = attributes_new[attribute_name]
          semantic_distance = calculate_embedding_distance(value_old, value_new)
          drift_score += semantic_distance
      return drift_score
    ```

3.  **Drift Prediction Model:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) is trained on historical drift scores for each product or product category. This model predicts the future drift score, indicating how quickly a product description is likely to diverge from its original state.

4.  **Near-Duplicate Alerting:**  A threshold is set on the predicted drift score. If the predicted drift exceeds the threshold, the system generates a "near-duplicate alert," even before the product description is actually updated. This allows for proactive duplicate detection and merging.

5.  **Drift Visualization:**  A dashboard visualizes the drift of product descriptions over time. Users can see which products are drifting rapidly, identify the attributes that are changing the most, and compare the drift trajectories of different products.

6.  **Augmented Rule Set:** The existing rule set for duplicate detection is extended to include "drift-aware" rules. These rules consider the predicted drift score when determining whether two product descriptions are near-duplicates.

    ```pseudocode
    function is_near_duplicate(product1, product2):
      drift_score = calculate_drift(product1.attributes, product2.attributes)
      predicted_drift = predict_future_drift(product1, product2)
      if predicted_drift > DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
        return true
      else:
        return evaluate_existing_rules(product1, product2)
    ```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Historical product descriptions with timestamps.
*   Pre-trained word embeddings.
*   Training data for the time-series forecasting model.

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability: The system must be able to handle a large number of product descriptions and frequent updates.
*   Performance: The drift calculation and prediction must be performed efficiently.
*   Data quality: Accurate timestamps and consistent attribute values are essential.
