## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning for Multi-User Environments

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive wakeword detection by incorporating acoustic zoning within a space. The system identifies multiple sound sources (users) within a room and dynamically adjusts wakeword sensitivity and model selection *per zone*. This allows for simultaneous, independent voice control for multiple users without interference, and improves performance in noisy, shared environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of far-field microphones (minimum 8, optimally 16+) distributed across the monitored space.
    *   DSP capable of performing beamforming and sound source localization in real-time.
    *   High-performance CPU for running advanced speech recognition models.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Zone Mapping Module:**
        *   Uses microphone array data to create a dynamic map of the monitored space.
        *   Identifies potential user locations (zones) based on sound source localization algorithms (e.g., Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA), beamforming).
        *   Dynamically adjusts zone boundaries based on user movement and environmental changes.
    *   **Per-Zone Speech Processing:**
        *   Assigns each detected sound source (user) to a specific zone.
        *   Applies individual wakeword detection and speech recognition models *per zone*.  This allows for user-specific vocabulary, accents, and noise profiles.
        *   Utilizes separate DSP threads for each zone to maintain real-time performance.
    *   **Adaptive Sensitivity Control:**
        *   Monitors the noise level within each zone.
        *   Adjusts the wakeword detection threshold *per zone* to optimize sensitivity and minimize false positives.
        *   Implements a noise-gating algorithm to suppress background noise before wakeword detection.
    *   **User Identification (Optional):**
        *   Integrates speaker recognition algorithms to identify individual users within each zone.
        *   Allows for personalized voice control and access to user-specific data.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:**
        *   Implements a priority system for handling simultaneous wake-word detections from different zones.
        *   Allows for multi-turn dialogue interactions with multiple users in the same space.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Create Microphone Array object
Create Zone Mapping object
Create Speech Processing object

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Capture Audio Data
    audioData = MicrophoneArray.capture()

    // Map Zones
    zones = ZoneMapping.map(audioData)

    // Process each zone
    for each zone in zones {
        // Extract audio data for this zone
        zoneAudio = zone.extract(audioData)

        // Adaptive Sensitivity Adjustment
        sensitivity = zone.calculateSensitivity(zoneAudio)

        // Wakeword Detection
        wakewordDetected = zone.detectWakeword(zoneAudio, sensitivity)

        if (wakewordDetected) {
            // Extract Command
            command = zone.extractCommand(zoneAudio)

            // Execute Command
            executeCommand(command, zone.userId)
        }
    }
}
```

**Refinement:** The system could be further enhanced by incorporating visual data from cameras to improve zone mapping and user identification. Machine learning algorithms could be used to predict user movement and adjust zone boundaries proactively.
