## Haptic Edge Projection System

**Concept:** Expand the edge-touch sensing concept into a localized haptic feedback system, projecting tactile sensations onto the user’s finger as it interacts with the device edge.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Integrated micro-pneumatic actuator array embedded within the optically transmissive element’s side surface.
*   **Actuator Density:** Minimum 50 actuators per cm of edge length, capable of independent activation.
*   **Actuation Method:** Miniature air chambers with rapidly inflating/deflating diaphragms driven by micro-pumps. Alternative: Piezoelectric elements for faster response.
*   **Sensing Integration:** Utilize the existing IR-based touch detection system (from the provided patent) to determine finger position with high precision.
*   **Control System:** Dedicated processor core responsible for mapping touch location to actuator activation patterns.
*   **Feedback Library:** Pre-programmed haptic ‘textures’ – ridges, bumps, pulses, etc. – stored in memory. Algorithm to create dynamically generated textures.
*   **Power:** Low-voltage DC power supply for micro-pumps/piezoelectric drivers.
*   **Materials:** Flexible, transparent polymer for actuator housing. Durable, tactile surface material for user contact.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
define actuatorArray[edgeLength]
define textureLibrary[textureCount]

//Main Loop
while (deviceActive) {
    //Touch Detection
    touchPosition = detectTouchPosition()  //From existing IR system

    if (touchPosition != null) {
        //Texture Selection
        selectedTexture = getTextureForPosition(touchPosition)

        //Actuator Activation
        for (i = 0; i < edgeLength; i++) {
            if (selectedTexture[i] == 1) {
                activateActuator(actuatorArray[i])
            } else {
                deactivateActuator(actuatorArray[i])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  The IR system detects the position of the user’s finger on the device edge.
2.  The processor maps this position to a specific haptic texture from the library (or generates one dynamically).
3.  The processor activates a corresponding pattern of micro-actuators, creating a localized tactile sensation on the user’s finger.
4.  The system can modulate the intensity and frequency of the actuator activations to create more complex sensations.
5.  This allows for the creation of virtual buttons, sliders, and other interactive elements along the device edge.
