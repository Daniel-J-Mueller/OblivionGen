## Automated Anti-Pattern ‘Mutation’ for Robustness Testing

**Concept:** Extend the anti-pattern detection and refactoring system to *intentionally introduce* controlled anti-patterns into the code base as a form of robustness testing.  The system would not just fix existing issues, but proactively attempt to *break* the code by inserting known anti-patterns, then verify that the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline detects and corrects them – or fails gracefully with informative error messages. This simulates real-world developer errors and assesses the resilience of the modernization pipeline.

**Specs:**

*   **Mutation Library:** A database of common anti-patterns, each represented as a code transformation rule (e.g., “Introduce a God Class” – merge several small classes into one large one).  Each rule includes a difficulty/risk score.
*   **Mutation Engine:** A component integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Before each build, it randomly selects one or more mutation rules based on the difficulty score (higher difficulty rules are less frequent). The engine then applies these rules to a working copy of the source code.
*   **Verification Suite:**  Following mutation, the standard build and testing process runs. The Verification Suite analyzes the results:
    *   **Successful Mutation:** If the build fails *or* the tests fail (indicating the anti-pattern was detected/handled), the mutation is considered ‘successful’ and logged.
    *   **Failed Mutation:** If the build passes *and* the tests pass (meaning the anti-pattern went undetected), the mutation is a ‘failure’ and requires immediate investigation.  The system should automatically flag the code section containing the undetected anti-pattern for manual review.
*   **Anti-Pattern ‘Intensity’ Control:** A parameter to adjust the aggressiveness of mutation. This allows for controlled testing—e.g., initially testing with only low-risk anti-patterns and gradually increasing the intensity.
*   **Self-Healing Integration:**  If a mutation is detected, an option to automatically trigger the existing refactoring engine to repair the introduced anti-pattern. This creates a closed-loop testing system.

**Pseudocode (Mutation Engine):**

```
function mutateCode(code, mutationList, intensity) {
  // Select mutations based on intensity and mutationList
  selectedMutations = selectMutations(mutationList, intensity);

  for (mutation in selectedMutations) {
    // Apply the mutation to the code
    mutatedCode = applyMutation(code, mutation);

    // Log the mutation attempt
    logMutationAttempt(mutation, mutatedCode);
  }

  return mutatedCode;
}

function selectMutations(mutationList, intensity) {
  // Filter mutations based on intensity and risk score
  // Return a list of selected mutations
}

function applyMutation(code, mutation) {
  // Apply the code transformation rule defined in the mutation
  // Return the mutated code
}

function logMutationAttempt(mutation, mutatedCode) {
  // Log details of the mutation attempt, including mutation type and code
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `MutationRule`: {`name`: string, `riskScore`: int, `transformationCode`: string} –  The transformation code might be a script or a set of instructions for a code manipulation tool.
*   `MutationResult`: {`mutationName`: string, `success`: boolean, `logMessages`: array}
