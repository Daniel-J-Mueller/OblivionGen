## Adaptive Camouflage Sensor Housing

**Concept:** A smoke/CO sensor housing that dynamically alters its visual appearance to blend with surrounding decor, reducing visual intrusion and increasing aesthetic acceptance.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing Material:** Multi-layer electrochromic polymer composite. Outer layer is a diffuse reflective surface.
*   **Sensor Core:** Standard smoke/CO detection components remain unchanged, encapsulated within the housing.
*   **Color Palette:** Housing capable of displaying a range of colors within a defined RGB/CMYK space, optimized for common interior design schemes. Preset palettes, accessible via a mobile app.
*   **Pattern Generation:** Micro-LED array beneath the electrochromic layer allows for dynamic texture and pattern generation. Pre-loaded patterns: wood grain, wallpaper repeats, solid colors, gradients. User-uploadable patterns.
*   **Environmental Sensing:** Integrated ambient light sensor. Algorithm adjusts housing color and brightness to match surrounding environment.
*   **Power:** Wireless power transfer (Qi standard) or low-voltage DC input.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for initial setup and control via mobile app.
*   **Dimensions:** Maintain a similar footprint to existing sensors (approximately 4" diameter, 1.5" height).
*   **Mounting:** Standard screw mount or adhesive backing.

**Pseudocode (Color/Pattern Adaptation):**

```
FUNCTION AdaptHousing()
  // 1. Read ambient light level from sensor
  ambient_light = ReadLightSensor()

  // 2. Read user preferences from app (color, pattern, brightness)
  user_color = GetUserColorPreference()
  user_pattern = GetUserPatternPreference()
  user_brightness = GetUserBrightnessPreference()

  // 3. Determine optimal color/pattern based on ambient light and user preferences.
  IF ambient_light > threshold_high THEN
    housing_color = Darken(user_color) //Adjust for bright light
    housing_pattern = user_pattern
  ELSE IF ambient_light < threshold_low THEN
    housing_color = Lighten(user_color) //Adjust for low light
    housing_pattern = user_pattern
  ELSE
    housing_color = user_color
    housing_pattern = user_pattern

  // 4. Adjust brightness
  final_brightness = user_brightness

  // 5. Send commands to electrochromic layer and micro-LED array
  SetHousingColor(housing_color)
  SetHousingPattern(housing_pattern)
  SetHousingBrightness(final_brightness)
END FUNCTION

//Run AdaptHousing() every 5 seconds, or when user preferences change
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Camouflage:** Implement an AI algorithm that analyzes a photograph of the room (taken via the mobile app) and automatically generates a camouflage pattern that perfectly matches the surrounding environment.
*   **Art Mode:** Display user-selected artwork or animations on the sensor housing when no alarm is detected.
*   **Emergency Beacon:** During an alarm, override camouflage and display a bright, flashing red pattern to attract attention.
