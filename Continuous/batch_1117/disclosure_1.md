## Autonomous Mobile Device - Environmental Mapping & Predictive Obstacle Avoidance

**System Overview:** Expand the AMD's capabilities beyond simple user tracking to full environmental awareness and proactive obstacle avoidance. This builds on the existing image processing by adding depth perception and predictive modeling.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensor Array:** Integrate a multi-sensor ToF array (e.g., LiDAR lite, VL53L1CX) around the camera, providing real-time depth data. Minimum array size: 4 sensors, optimally 8-16 for wider field of view.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** High-precision 9-axis IMU for accurate device orientation and motion tracking. (e.g., Bosch BMI160)
*   **Edge Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge processing unit (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Google Coral Dev Board) for real-time data fusion, environmental mapping, and predictive modeling.
*   **Increased Memory Capacity:** Expand onboard memory to at least 64GB for storing map data and training predictive models.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Capture synchronized data streams from the camera, ToF array, and IMU.
2.  **3D Environmental Mapping:**  Fuse camera images with ToF depth data to create a dynamic 3D map of the surrounding environment. Employ Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms (e.g., ORB-SLAM3, RTAB-Map) for robust map construction. The map will be a point cloud representation.
3.  **Object Recognition & Semantic Segmentation:** Utilize deep learning models (e.g., YOLOv8, Mask R-CNN) to identify and classify objects within the 3D map (e.g., people, furniture, walls, stairs). Implement semantic segmentation to assign labels to each point in the point cloud.
4.  **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   **Motion Prediction:** Track the movement of dynamic objects (e.g., people) within the environment. Utilize Kalman filters or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict their future trajectories.
    *   **Behavioral Analysis:** Analyze the historical movement patterns of objects to anticipate their likely behavior. (e.g., if someone is walking towards a doorway, they are likely to go through it).
5.  **Collision Avoidance Planning:** Develop a real-time path planning algorithm that considers both static obstacles (walls, furniture) and predicted trajectories of dynamic objects.
    *   Utilize a costmap approach, assigning higher costs to areas with potential collisions.
    *   Employ a search algorithm (e.g., A\*, RRT\*) to find the safest and most efficient path for the AMD.
6.  **Actuator Control:**  Generate control signals for the AMD's actuators (motors, gimbal) to execute the planned path.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Collision Avoidance):**

```
function avoidCollision(environmentMap, dynamicObjects, currentPosition, targetPosition):
  # Predict future positions of dynamic objects
  predictedPositions = predictTrajectories(dynamicObjects)

  # Generate costmap based on static obstacles and predicted positions
  costmap = generateCostmap(environmentMap, predictedPositions)

  # Search for optimal path from current position to target position
  path = AStarSearch(costmap, currentPosition, targetPosition)

  # Generate actuator control signals based on path
  controlSignals = generateControlSignals(path)

  return controlSignals
```

**Calibration Procedure:**

*   **Sensor Fusion Calibration:** Calibrate the camera, ToF sensors, and IMU to establish accurate coordinate transformations between their respective frames.  Utilize a calibration target (e.g., chessboard) with known dimensions.
*   **Dynamic Object Tracking Calibration:**  Collect data of moving objects and refine the prediction models to improve accuracy.
*   **Environmental Mapping Calibration:**  Periodically update the 3D map to account for changes in the environment.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-AMD Coordination:** Enable multiple AMDs to share environmental map data and coordinate their movements to avoid collisions.
*   **Augmented Reality Integration:** Overlay information about the environment onto the camera feed to provide users with contextual awareness.
*   **Learning-Based Navigation:** Train the AMD to navigate complex environments autonomously using reinforcement learning.
