**Adaptive Token Partitioning for Multi-Tenant Inference**

**Concept:** Extend the token bucket system to dynamically partition available inference capacity across multiple tenants in a shared inference service, optimizing for both fairness and revenue.  This isn't just about rate limiting; it's about creating a fluid, market-driven allocation of resources.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Tenant Profiles:** Each tenant is assigned a profile defining:
    *   *Base Token Allocation:* A minimum guaranteed token refill rate.
    *   *Price Elasticity:* A coefficient indicating willingness to pay for additional tokens (higher = more willing).
    *   *Service Level Agreement (SLA):* Minimum acceptable inference latency.
    *   *Budget Cap:* Maximum spend allowed over a defined period.

2.  **Global Token Pool:** A central pool of tokens representing total available inference capacity.  This pool is monitored for utilization.

3.  **Dynamic Partitioning Algorithm:**  Executed periodically (e.g., every minute).  
    *   **Step 1: Demand Prediction:** Use historical data and real-time requests to predict each tenant’s token demand for the next period.
    *   **Step 2:  Price Auction:** For each period, a virtual auction occurs for 'surplus' tokens beyond the base allocation. Tenants bid based on their price elasticity and predicted demand.  The bid is calculated as:  `Bid = PriceElasticity * PredictedDemand`.
    *   **Step 3: Allocation:** Tokens are allocated to tenants based on the auction results, respecting budget caps and ensuring all tenants receive at least their base allocation.  Allocation prioritizes highest bidders *until* budget caps are hit. Any remaining tokens are allocated proportionally based on price elasticity.
    *   **Step 4: SLA Monitoring:**  Monitor inference latency for each tenant. If a tenant’s latency consistently exceeds their SLA, increase their base token allocation at the expense of lower-priority tenants.
    *   **Step 5: Rebalancing:** Periodically (e.g., hourly), re-evaluate tenant profiles and adjust base allocations based on long-term usage patterns.

4.  **Token Marketplace Integration:**  Allow tenants to trade tokens amongst themselves via a marketplace. This enables dynamic resource sharing and optimization.
    *   *Token Transfer API:* Facilitates secure token transfers between tenants.
    *   *Price Discovery Mechanism:* Implement a mechanism (e.g., order book) for setting token prices.
    *   *Automated Trading Bots:* Allow tenants to create bots to automatically buy or sell tokens based on predefined criteria.

5. **Resource Prioritization:**  Within each tenant, prioritize requests based on token usage.  Higher token requests (more complex models, larger inputs) are given preferential access to resources.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Partitioning Algorithm):**

```
// Inputs: TenantProfiles, GlobalTokenPool, CurrentTime
// Outputs: TokenAllocations (per tenant)

function DynamicPartitioning(TenantProfiles, GlobalTokenPool, CurrentTime):
  // 1. Demand Prediction
  PredictedDemands = PredictDemand(TenantProfiles, CurrentTime)

  // 2. Price Auction
  Bids = CalculateBids(TenantProfiles, PredictedDemands)

  // 3. Allocation
  TokenAllocations = {}
  RemainingTokens = GlobalTokenPool
  
  // Allocate Base Tokens
  for tenant in TenantProfiles:
    TokenAllocations[tenant] = TenantProfiles[tenant].BaseTokenAllocation
    RemainingTokens -= TenantProfiles[tenant].BaseTokenAllocation

  // Allocate Surplus Tokens
  SortedTenants = SortTenantsByBid(Bids, descending=True)
  for tenant in SortedTenants:
    MaxSpend = TenantProfiles[tenant].BudgetCap - TokenAllocations[tenant]
    TokensToAllocate = min(Bids[tenant], MaxSpend, RemainingTokens)
    TokenAllocations[tenant] += TokensToAllocate
    RemainingTokens -= TokensToAllocate
    if RemainingTokens <= 0:
      break

  // 4. SLA Monitoring (Implementation details omitted for brevity)

  // 5. Rebalancing (Implementation details omitted for brevity)
  return TokenAllocations
```

**Hardware Considerations:**  High-throughput network interfaces, scalable storage for token state, and dedicated processing resources for the partitioning algorithm.
