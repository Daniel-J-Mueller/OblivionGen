**Ephemeral Key Shards & Distributed Entropy**

**Concept:** Instead of a single key encrypted with a time-limited key, fragment the initial cryptographic key into multiple ‘shards’. Each shard is encrypted with a *different* ephemeral key, and these ephemeral keys have *independent* lifespans, managed by a distributed entropy source. This allows for granular control over key availability, resilience against compromise of individual shards, and a nuanced approach to durability beyond a simple time limit.

**Specs:**

1.  **Key Sharding:**
    *   Initial cryptographic key (K) is divided into *n* shards (K1, K2… Kn).
    *   Shard size is configurable, balancing redundancy and recovery overhead.
    *   A threshold *t* is defined, where *t* <= *n*. *t* shards are required to reconstruct K. (Shamir's Secret Sharing applicable).

2.  **Ephemeral Key Generation & Distribution:**
    *   Each shard Ki is encrypted with a unique ephemeral key Ei.
    *   Ei is generated by a Distributed Entropy Source (DES) – see point 4.
    *   Ei's lifespan is independent, and managed via a 'decay' function.

3.  **Decay Function:**
    *   Each Ei has a decay rate 'dr' – configurable per shard, or globally.
    *   dr is a function of time, but can also be influenced by external factors (e.g., network activity, sensor data).
    *   As time passes, Ei’s decay value increases. Beyond a threshold, Ei is considered 'lost', and the corresponding shard becomes irrecoverable.
    *   The decay value is not directly exposed; it influences the probability of successful decryption.

4.  **Distributed Entropy Source (DES):**
    *   DES consists of multiple geographically distributed nodes.
    *   Each node contributes entropy via hardware random number generators (HRNGs) and environmental sensors (e.g., atmospheric noise, cosmic radiation).
    *   Entropy is aggregated and distributed using a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm.
    *   This ensures high entropy generation, resilience against node compromise, and verifiable randomness.

5.  **Key Reconstruction:**
    *   To reconstruct K, a client requests *t* shards.
    *   The system identifies viable shards (decay value below threshold).
    *   If sufficient viable shards are available, they are retrieved and decrypted using their respective ephemeral keys.
    *   Shamir's Secret Sharing is used to reconstruct K from the decrypted shards.

6.  **Shard Management & Redundancy:**
    *   Shards are stored in a geographically distributed data store.
    *   Redundant copies are maintained for fault tolerance.
    *   A background process continuously monitors shard health and regenerates lost or decaying shards.

**Pseudocode (Shard Regeneration):**

```
FUNCTION RegenerateShard(shardID, decayedEphemeralKey)
    // Check if shard is already being regenerated
    IF regenerationInProgress(shardID) THEN
        RETURN

    // Mark shard as regenerating
    markRegenerationInProgress(shardID)

    // Generate a new ephemeral key
    newEphemeralKey = DES.generateKey()

    // Encrypt the shard with the new ephemeral key
    encryptedShard = encrypt(shard, newEphemeralKey)

    // Store the encrypted shard
    storeShard(encryptedShard, shardID)

    // Update shard metadata with the new ephemeral key and decay information
    updateShardMetadata(shardID, newEphemeralKey, calculateDecayInfo())

    // Mark regeneration as complete
    markRegenerationComplete(shardID)
END FUNCTION
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simple time-based durability to a probabilistic model, allowing for fine-grained control over key availability and resilience. The distributed entropy source provides a high level of security and verifiable randomness, while the shard-based approach mitigates the impact of individual key compromise. This is particularly useful for scenarios where data access requirements are dynamic and unpredictable.
