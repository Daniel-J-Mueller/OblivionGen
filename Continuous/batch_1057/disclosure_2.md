## Dynamic Log Data Visualization with Predictive Anomaly Highlighting

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic clustering and pattern recognition of the existing patent to create a real-time visualization system that not only identifies patterns in log data but *predicts* potential anomalies based on deviations from those established patterns.  This shifts from reactive analysis to proactive alerting.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing Module:**

*   **Input:** Unstructured log data stream (similar to patent input).
*   **Preprocessing:**
    *   Timestamp extraction & normalization.
    *   Data/time removal (optional, configurable).
    *   Standardization of log message format (regex-based parsing).
    *   Creation of a rolling window of log entries (configurable window size).
*   **Output:** Stream of preprocessed log entries with timestamps.

**2. Pattern & Cluster Generation Module:**

*   **Core Algorithm:** Adapts the patent’s word pair frequency & modified frequency map concepts.
*   **Enhancements:**
    *   **Semantic Weighting:**  Assign weights to words based on their semantic meaning (using a pre-trained word embedding model – Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).  More significant semantic shifts indicate greater potential anomalies.
    *   **Temporal Decay:** Introduce a decay factor for word pair frequencies.  Recent patterns are weighted more heavily than older ones.
    *   **Hierarchical Clustering:**  Implement a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar patterns. This allows for zooming in on specific areas of interest.
*   **Output:** A dynamic, evolving map of log patterns, represented as a tree structure. Each node represents a pattern, and the depth of the node indicates its frequency and recency.

**3. Anomaly Prediction Module:**

*   **Deviation Calculation:** For each incoming log entry:
    *   Determine the closest matching pattern in the dynamic pattern map.
    *   Calculate a deviation score based on the difference between the incoming entry’s word pair frequencies and the closest matching pattern's frequencies. Semantic weighting is applied.
    *   Apply a threshold (configurable) to the deviation score.
*   **Predictive Alerting:**  If the deviation score exceeds the threshold, generate an anomaly alert. The alert should include:
    *   The incoming log entry.
    *   The closest matching pattern.
    *   The deviation score.
    *   A severity level (calculated based on deviation score and pattern frequency).
*   **Output:** Stream of anomaly alerts with severity levels.

**4. Visualization & User Interface:**

*   **Real-time Dashboard:** Display a dynamic visualization of the log data, highlighting anomalies in real-time.
*   **Interactive Pattern Map:** Allow users to explore the dynamic pattern map, zoom in on specific patterns, and view associated log entries.
*   **Alert Management:** Provide a centralized interface for viewing and managing anomaly alerts.
*   **Customizable Thresholds:** Allow users to configure anomaly detection thresholds based on their specific needs.
*   **Anomaly Explanation:** Attempt to provide a human-readable explanation of why an anomaly was detected (e.g., "The term 'error' appeared with a significantly higher frequency than usual.").

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```pseudocode
function detectAnomaly(logEntry, patternMap):
  closestPattern = findClosestPattern(logEntry, patternMap)
  deviationScore = calculateDeviationScore(logEntry, closestPattern)
  if deviationScore > threshold:
    generateAnomalyAlert(logEntry, closestPattern, deviationScore)
  return
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server with sufficient memory and processing power.
*   Real-time data streaming platform (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
*   Database for storing log data and pattern information (e.g., Elasticsearch, Cassandra).
*   Visualization framework (e.g., D3.js, Plotly).
*   Pre-trained word embedding model (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).
