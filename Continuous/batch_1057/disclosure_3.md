## Adaptive Relationship Weighting via Dynamic Graph Construction

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on labeling record pairs and training models based on those labels. This builds on that by dynamically constructing a weighted graph representing relationships *between* entities, allowing for adaptive weighting of relationship strength based on contextual evidence gathered *after* initial model training. This shifts the focus from solely pair-wise analysis to a network-level understanding, facilitating more nuanced relationship detection.

**Specs:**

**1. Entity Graph Construction Module:**

*   **Input:** Stream of incoming records (entities), initial trained machine learning model (from the core patent), existing entity graph (initially empty or populated from prior analysis).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each incoming record:
        *   Identify entities within the record.
        *   If an entity does *not* exist in the graph, add it as a node.
        *   Run the trained ML model on the incoming record against existing entities in the graph. This generates initial relationship scores (e.g., similarity, difference) for potential edges.
        *   **Contextual Enrichment:** Query external data sources (knowledge graphs, news feeds, social media) for information *about* the entities and their relationship. This could include co-occurrence statistics, sentiment analysis, or known associations.
        *   **Weight Calculation:** Combine the ML model score with the contextual enrichment data using a weighted sum. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on the reliability of each data source (e.g., a highly authoritative knowledge graph receives a higher weight).
        *   If a significant relationship (above a defined threshold) is detected, create or update an edge between the corresponding nodes with the calculated weight.
*   **Output:** Updated entity graph with nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships, weighted by strength.

**2. Dynamic Weight Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:** Updated entity graph, stream of new data (records, external data feeds).
*   **Process:**
    *   Periodically (or triggered by new data):
        *   For each edge in the graph:
            *   Re-evaluate the relationship based on the latest data. This could involve:
                *   Checking for supporting or conflicting evidence in new records.
                *   Monitoring changes in external data sources.
                *   Applying time decay to edge weights (older relationships may weaken).
            *   Adjust the edge weight accordingly.
*   **Output:** Continuously updated entity graph with dynamically adjusted relationship weights.

**3. Relationship Inference Engine:**

*   **Input:** Dynamically updated entity graph, query entity.
*   **Process:**
    *   Traverse the graph starting from the query entity.
    *   Rank neighboring entities based on edge weights and path lengths.
    *   Infer relationships based on the ranked neighbors and the types of connections between them. (e.g. high weight connections indicate strong relationships).
*   **Output:** List of related entities ranked by relationship strength.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Weight Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_edge_weight(edge, new_data):
    ml_score = run_ml_model(edge.entity1, edge.entity2, new_data)
    context_score = query_external_sources(edge.entity1, edge.entity2, new_data)
    weight = (alpha * ml_score) + (beta * context_score) // alpha + beta sum to 1
    weight = weight * (1 - decay_rate) //apply time decay.
    edge.weight = weight
    return edge
```

**Novelty:** Unlike the original patent which focuses on labeling pairs, this system creates a *network* of entities and relationships, enabling inference beyond simple pair-wise analysis.  The dynamic weighting system allows the network to adapt to new information and provides a more nuanced understanding of relationships.  The weight calculation allows for a 'fusion' of AI and external data.
