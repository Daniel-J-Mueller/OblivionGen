## Dynamic Supplier Risk Weighting via Real-Time Event Correlation

**Concept:** Expand the existing supply risk detection beyond historical data and static feature weighting. Implement a system that dynamically adjusts the weight of fulfillment-related features based on *real-time* event correlation â€“ not just within our own systems, but by monitoring external, publicly available data sources.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Event Stream:**

*   **Internal Sources:** Continue collecting historical supply constraint data (purchase order rejections, cancellations, backorders, partial receipts), fulfillment-related features (supplier ID, item ID, release date, quantity, velocity, replenishment code).
*   **External Sources:** Integrate APIs/web scraping for:
    *   **News Feeds:** Monitor news related to suppliers (factory fires, labor disputes, geopolitical events affecting sourcing regions). Utilize NLP to classify event sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and relevance.
    *   **Weather Data:** Track weather patterns in supplier regions (hurricanes, floods, droughts) that could disrupt production or shipping.
    *   **Shipping Data (AIS):** Monitor vessel traffic and port congestion to anticipate potential delays.
    *   **Social Media:** Monitor relevant social media channels for reports of supplier issues (quality control, delays).
    *   **Economic Indicators:** Track relevant economic data (commodity prices, exchange rates) that could impact supplier costs.

**2. Event Correlation Engine:**

*   **Time-Series Analysis:** Analyze time-series data from internal and external sources to identify correlations between events and supply constraints.
*   **Causality Inference:** Employ causal inference techniques to determine whether external events *cause* supply constraints, rather than just being correlated with them. (e.g., did a factory fire *cause* a purchase order rejection, or were they both caused by a third factor?).
*   **Dynamic Feature Weighting:** Based on event correlation and causality inference, dynamically adjust the weights assigned to fulfillment-related features in the supply risk early detection model.  
    *   Example: If a supplier region experiences a major hurricane, increase the weight of weather-related features and reduce the weight of historical velocity.

**3. Model Integration & Pseudocode:**

*   Supply Risk Model:  Maintain existing logistical regression or similar model.
*   Weight Update Frequency:  Update feature weights at least hourly, or more frequently if significant external events occur.
*   Pseudocode for Weight Update:

```
FUNCTION update_feature_weights(internal_data, external_events)
  // 1. Analyze external_events for relevant signals (weather, news, shipping)
  relevant_signals = filter_and_classify(external_events)

  // 2. Calculate impact scores for each relevant signal
  impact_scores = calculate_impact_scores(relevant_signals)

  // 3. Adjust feature weights based on impact scores.
  FOR each feature IN fulfillment_features:
    weight_adjustment = 0
    FOR each signal IN impact_scores:
      IF signal.affects_feature(feature):
        weight_adjustment += signal.impact_score * signal.weight_multiplier
    feature.weight = feature.base_weight + weight_adjustment
  END

  RETURN updated_fulfillment_features
END
```

**4.  Alerting & Purchasing Plan Adjustment:**

*   Increased Sensitivity: Implement more sensitive alerting thresholds for high-risk suppliers based on dynamic risk scores.
*   Automated Plan Adjustment: Automatically adjust purchasing plans to account for increased risk (e.g., increase order quantities, diversify suppliers, accelerate lead times).
*   Explainability: Provide clear explanations for why risk scores have changed, including the specific external events that contributed to the change.
