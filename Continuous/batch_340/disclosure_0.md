## Secure Data Streams with Ephemeral Key Orchestration

**Concept:** A system for establishing secure, authenticated data streams where cryptographic keys aren't pre-shared or directly embedded in requests, but *orchestrated* on-demand via a distributed trust network. This differs from the patent by prioritizing dynamic, short-lived key creation and management *separate* from the initial request, offering enhanced security and scalability.

**Specs:**

*   **Nodes:** The system comprises three node types:
    *   **Initiator:**  The entity requesting a data stream.
    *   **Orchestrator:** A distributed network (e.g., blockchain-based or a consortium of trusted servers) responsible for key creation, distribution, and revocation.
    *   **Provider:** The entity providing the data stream.

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  **Initiation:** The Initiator sends a ‘Stream Request’ to the Orchestrator. This request *only* contains metadata about the desired stream (data type, access permissions, duration, etc.). It does *not* contain any keys or authentication credentials.
    2.  **Key Generation & Distribution:** The Orchestrator, based on the Stream Request, generates a unique, ephemeral symmetric key (e.g., AES-256).  It then *splits* this key into multiple shares using Secret Sharing (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing). 
    3.  **Share Distribution:** The Orchestrator distributes these shares to:
        *   The Initiator.
        *   The Provider.
        *   A set of ‘Witness’ nodes (chosen randomly or based on pre-defined criteria) for redundancy and auditing.
    4.  **Key Reconstruction:** Both the Initiator and Provider, upon receiving their share, can reconstruct the complete symmetric key.  The Witness nodes can also reconstruct the key for verification purposes.
    5.  **Secure Stream:** The Initiator and Provider establish a secure data stream using the reconstructed symmetric key (e.g., TLS/SSL with the ephemeral key).
    6.  **Stream Termination/Key Revocation:** Upon stream termination or compromise, the Orchestrator revokes the key shares, rendering the key unusable. This revocation is propagated to the Witness nodes.

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Key Exchange:**  Threshold Secret Sharing (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing).
    *   **Secure Communication:** TLS/SSL or a similar protocol using the dynamically generated symmetric key.
    *   **Orchestration Platform:**  Blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum) or a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Raft, Paxos).
    *   **API:** RESTful API for Stream Request submission and key management.

*   **Pseudocode (Orchestrator – Key Generation & Distribution):**

```
function generateAndDistributeKey(streamRequest) {
  // Generate random symmetric key
  key = generateSymmetricKey();

  // Generate key shares using Secret Sharing
  shares = generateSecretShares(key, numberOfShares);

  // Distribute shares
  distributeShare(shares[0], initiatorAddress); // To Initiator
  distributeShare(shares[1], providerAddress); // To Provider

  // Distribute shares to Witness nodes
  for (i = 2; i < numberOfShares; i++) {
    distributeShare(shares[i], witnessNodeAddress[i-2]);
  }
}

function distributeShare(share, address) {
  // Securely transmit the key share to the given address
  // (using encryption and authentication)
}
```

*   **Innovation:** This system decouples key management from the initial request, making it resistant to key compromise in transit.  The use of a distributed trust network adds redundancy and accountability, and dynamically generated keys provide increased security over static key exchange.
