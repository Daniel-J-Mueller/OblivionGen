**Dynamic Resource Schema Evolution & Federated Change Control**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the existing change control framework to support *dynamic* schema evolution for resources *and* enable federated change control across multiple, potentially independent, services. This addresses scenarios where resource definitions change frequently or where change requests span multiple systems.

**II. Components:**

*   **Schema Repository:** A centralized (or distributed) store for resource schemas. This isn't merely a static storage location but actively tracks schema versions and dependencies.
*   **Schema Versioning Service:**  Manages schema versions, providing APIs for querying current/historical schemas and validating resource data against specific schemas.  Includes tools for schema diffing (identifying changes between versions).
*   **Federation Manager:** A component capable of translating change requests between different servicesâ€™ change control systems. It resolves dependencies and ensures consistent state across federated resources.
*   **Adaptive Request Encoder:** A module that dynamically encodes change requests according to the *current* schema version of the target resource.  This ensures compatibility even as schemas evolve.
*   **Policy Engine (Schema-Aware):**  An extension to the existing approval process. The Policy Engine can enforce rules based on schema changes. For example, it could require additional approvals for changes that impact critical fields or introduce breaking changes.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **Schema Change Detection:** The Schema Repository monitors for schema updates.
2.  **Adaptive Encoding:** When a change request is received, the Adaptive Request Encoder determines the current schema version for the target resource and encodes the request accordingly.
3.  **Schema Validation:** The request is validated against the current schema. If validation fails, the request is rejected with a detailed error message.
4.  **Federated Routing:** If the change request involves resources in multiple services, the Federation Manager translates the request into the appropriate format for each service.  It manages dependencies and ensures consistent execution.
5.  **Schema-Aware Approval:** The Policy Engine evaluates the change request in the context of the current schema version.  It may require additional approvals or modifications based on the nature of the changes.
6.  **Performance and Propagation:** The change is performed on the target resource.  The results are propagated to other relevant services via the Federation Manager.
7.  **Schema Update Propagation:** Upon successful completion of the change, the Schema Repository is updated with the new schema version.  This update is propagated to all relevant services.

**IV. Pseudocode (Federation Manager - simplified):**

```pseudocode
function federateChangeRequest(request, targetResources):
    for resource in targetResources:
        service = resource.service
        encodedRequest = service.encodeRequest(request, resource.schema) //Adapts schema
        response = service.processChangeRequest(encodedRequest)
        if response.status != "success":
            return {status: "failure", error: "Service " + service.name + " failed"}
    return {status: "success"}
```

**V. Novelty:**

Existing change control systems often treat schemas as static. This system allows schemas to evolve dynamically without disrupting the change control process. The federation aspect enables cross-service change control, which is critical for complex, distributed applications. The schema-aware Policy Engine adds an extra layer of security and control, reducing the risk of unintended consequences from schema changes.  It specifically aims to manage change *as schema evolves*.
