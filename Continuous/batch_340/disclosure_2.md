## Autonomous Vehicle - Predictive Pedestrian Intent & Dynamic Crosswalk Expansion

**System Overview:** This system builds on existing autonomous navigation capabilities by integrating a predictive pedestrian intent module with a dynamic crosswalk expansion system. It aims to increase safety and efficiency in complex urban environments, particularly at intersections with heavy pedestrian traffic or obscured visibility.

**Core Innovation:** Current systems react to pedestrian *presence* in the crosswalk. This system predicts pedestrian *intent* to enter the crosswalk *before* they physically do, and dynamically expands the perceived crosswalk boundaries to account for potential deviations from a straight path, irregular gait, or group behavior.

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Enhanced Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution LiDAR (128-beam minimum) for detailed environment mapping.
    *   Multi-spectral cameras (visible light, near-infrared) to improve pedestrian detection in varied lighting conditions.
    *   Millimeter-wave radar for robust tracking of pedestrians through obstructions (e.g., parked cars, other pedestrians).
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** Dedicated processor for real-time data fusion and predictive modeling. Low latency is critical.
*   **Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication Module:** Enables communication with smart traffic infrastructure (traffic signals, pedestrian detection systems) and other vehicles.
*   **High-Precision GPS/IMU:** For accurate localization and orientation.

**II. Software Modules:**

*   **Pedestrian Intent Prediction Engine:** (Core Innovation)
    *   **Data Input:** LiDAR point clouds, multi-spectral camera images, radar data, V2X data.
    *   **Feature Extraction:**
        *   Body pose estimation.
        *   Head orientation & gaze direction.
        *   Gait analysis.
        *   Velocity & acceleration.
        *   Proximity to crosswalk edges.
        *   Historical pedestrian crossing patterns (learned from data).
    *   **Predictive Model:** Hybrid approach:
        *   Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) – for modeling temporal dependencies in pedestrian behavior.
        *   Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) – to simulate plausible pedestrian trajectories and account for uncertainty.
    *   **Output:** Probability distribution of pedestrian intent to enter the crosswalk, along with predicted trajectory.
*   **Dynamic Crosswalk Expansion Module:**
    *   **Input:** Predicted pedestrian trajectory, pedestrian intent probability, crosswalk geometry.
    *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  Define a “risk zone” around the predicted trajectory. The size of the risk zone is proportional to the uncertainty in the prediction and the vehicle’s speed.
        2.  Expand the perceived crosswalk boundaries to encompass the risk zone.
        3.  Continuously update the risk zone and crosswalk boundaries based on new sensor data and revised predictions.
    *   **Output:** Expanded crosswalk polygon for path planning.
*   **Path Planning & Control Module:**
    *   **Input:** Expanded crosswalk polygon, vehicle state, surrounding environment map.
    *   **Algorithm:** Model Predictive Control (MPC) – optimizes the vehicle's trajectory to safely navigate the expanded crosswalk while minimizing travel time and maximizing passenger comfort.

**III. Pseudocode (Pedestrian Intent Prediction Engine):**

```pseudocode
// Input: LiDAR Point Cloud, Camera Image, Radar Data
// Output: Probability of pedestrian entering crosswalk, Predicted Trajectory

function predictPedestrianIntent(pointCloud, image, radarData) {

    // 1. Feature Extraction
    pose = estimateBodyPose(image)
    gaze = estimateGazeDirection(pose)
    gait = analyzeGait(pose)
    velocity = calculateVelocity(radarData)
    proximity = calculateProximityToCrosswalk(pose)

    // 2. Data Fusion
    features = [pose, gaze, gait, velocity, proximity]

    // 3. Predictive Modeling (Hybrid Approach)
    lstmOutput = lstm(features) // RNN-LSTM for temporal dependencies
    ganOutput = gan(lstmOutput) // GAN for generating plausible trajectories

    // 4. Probability Calculation
    intentProbability = calculateIntentProbability(ganOutput)

    // 5. Trajectory Prediction
    predictedTrajectory = extractTrajectory(ganOutput)

    return intentProbability, predictedTrajectory
}
```

**IV. Operational Considerations:**

*   **V2X Integration:** Communication with smart traffic infrastructure can provide additional information about pedestrian behavior and signal timing.
*   **Edge Computing Requirements:** Real-time data processing requires high-performance edge computing capabilities.
*   **Data Collection & Training:** A large dataset of pedestrian behavior is needed to train the predictive models.
*   **Safety Validation:** Thorough safety validation is essential before deploying the system in real-world environments.
