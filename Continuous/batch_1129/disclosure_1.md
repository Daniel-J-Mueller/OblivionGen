## Decentralized Credential Orchestration via Multi-Party Computation

**Concept:** Expand upon the trusted channel concept by implementing a system where credential resets aren't centrally managed, but orchestrated via a multi-party computation (MPC) network. This dramatically enhances security and reduces single points of failure.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A distributed network of “Credential Guardians” (CGs). These can be geographically diverse servers or even edge devices.
*   **Account Linking:** When an account is created, it’s not directly linked to a single trusted channel. Instead, it’s associated with a *subset* of the CG network.  The account owner receives a 'shard map' detailing which CGs are responsible for portions of their credential reset process.
*   **Reset Request Initiation:** A user initiating a reset request doesn’t send it to a central authority. The request is broadcast to the CGs associated with their account, based on the shard map.
*   **MPC Protocol:** The CGs engage in an MPC protocol (e.g., Shamir’s Secret Sharing) to *collectively* compute the reset token. No single CG holds the complete token at any point.  Each CG contributes a ‘share’ of the token based on encrypted data unique to the account.
*   **Token Distribution:** The resulting token is split into multiple fragments and delivered to the user via multiple trusted channels (e.g., email, SMS, authenticator app).  The user must assemble these fragments to reconstruct the complete token.
*   **Client-Side Assembly:** The client application (e.g., a mobile app or web browser) contains logic to combine the token fragments. This assembly process may involve additional encryption/decryption steps based on user-specific keys.
*   **Dynamic Shard Map Updates:** The shard map can be periodically updated to rotate the CGs responsible for an account. This adds a layer of protection against compromise and ensures that no single CG has long-term control over credential resets.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Token Assembly):**

```
function assembleToken(fragment1, fragment2, fragment3, userKey):
  // Decrypt each fragment using userKey (or derived keys)
  decryptedFragment1 = decrypt(fragment1, userKey)
  decryptedFragment2 = decrypt(fragment2, userKey)
  decryptedFragment3 = decrypt(fragment3, userKey)

  // Combine the decrypted fragments.  The combining method may vary based on the MPC protocol used.
  combinedToken = combine(decryptedFragment1, decryptedFragment2, decryptedFragment3)

  return combinedToken
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Threshold Cryptography:** Utilize threshold cryptography to ensure that a minimum number of CGs must participate in the MPC protocol for a reset to succeed.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Integrate zero-knowledge proofs to verify that the CGs are performing the MPC protocol correctly without revealing any sensitive information.
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Use a blockchain to store the shard map and track the history of credential resets.  This adds an immutable audit trail and enhances transparency.
*   **Attestation Mechanisms:** Implement attestation mechanisms to verify the identity and integrity of the CGs. This helps to prevent malicious actors from joining the network.
