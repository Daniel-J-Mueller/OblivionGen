## Adaptive Subscription Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the subscription "fan-out" concept to allow *dynamic*, granular control over the data delivered to subscribers, moving beyond field-level precision to *value-range* and *conditional* subscriptions. This enables subscribers to receive only the most relevant data updates, drastically reducing bandwidth and processing overhead.

**Specifications:**

**1. Subscription Definition Enhancement:**

*   **Range Filters:**  Introduce the ability to define subscriptions with numerical or date/time ranges. Example: "Notify me when the temperature exceeds 75 degrees Fahrenheit" or “Alert me to stock price changes greater than 5%”.
*   **Conditional Logic:** Allow subscriptions to include simple conditional statements. Example: “Notify me if the status is ‘error’ AND the priority is ‘high’”.
*   **Data Type Specific Filters:** Filters should be automatically adapted to the data type of the subscribed field (numerical, string, boolean, date/time, etc.).

**2. Data Proxy Modification:**

*   **Real-time Filtering Engine:** Implement a filtering engine within the data proxy that evaluates incoming data against active subscription definitions *before* sending messages. This engine must support range comparisons, boolean logic, and data type-specific operations.
*   **Subscription Compilation:** Compile subscription definitions into optimized filtering rules for efficient evaluation. A rule might look like: `IF temperature > 75 AND alert_level = 'critical' THEN send_message`.
*   **Dynamic Rule Adjustment:** Allow for the dynamic adjustment of filtering rules without requiring a restart of the data proxy.

**3. Data Source Integration:**

*   **Data Type Metadata:** The data source must provide metadata describing the data types of each field, enabling the data proxy to perform accurate filtering.
*   **Structured Data Format:** Data should be transmitted in a structured format (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers) to facilitate field-level access and filtering.

**4. Messaging Service Adaptation:**

*   **Filtered Payloads:**  The messaging service should receive filtered data payloads from the data proxy, containing only the data that matches the subscription criteria.
*   **Topic Granularity:** Topics can be dynamically generated based on filter conditions to improve routing and reduce broadcast overhead. For example, a topic could be “temperature_alerts_75plus”.

**Pseudocode (Data Proxy Filtering Engine):**

```
function evaluateSubscription(data, subscription):
  rules = subscription.rules
  for rule in rules:
    if not rule.evaluate(data):
      return False  // Rule failed, subscription doesn't match
  return True // All rules passed, subscription matches

class Rule:
  def __init__(self, field, operator, value):
    self.field = field
    self.operator = operator
    self.value = value

  def evaluate(self, data):
    fieldValue = data[self.field]

    if self.operator == ">":
      return fieldValue > self.value
    elif self.operator == "<":
      return fieldValue < self.value
    elif self.operator == "==":
      return fieldValue == self.value
    elif self.operator == "!=":
      return fieldValue != self.value
    # Add more operators as needed

# Example Usage:
data = {"temperature": 80, "alert_level": "critical"}
subscription = {
    "rules": [
        {"field": "temperature", "operator": ">", "value": 75},
        {"field": "alert_level", "operator": "==", "value": "critical"}
    ]
}

if evaluateSubscription(data, subscription):
    # Send message to messaging service
    print("Message sent")
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Bandwidth Consumption:** Clients receive only the data they need.
*   **Improved Client Performance:** Reduced data processing overhead.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** More efficient data delivery.
*   **Greater Customization:** Clients can tailor data subscriptions to their specific requirements.
