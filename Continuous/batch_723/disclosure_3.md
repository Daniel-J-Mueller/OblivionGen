## Dynamic Database Sharding with Predictive Backup

**Core Concept:** Extend the rotating incremental backup approach by integrating it with a dynamic database sharding strategy, driven by predictive workload analysis. This aims to reduce backup size, improve restore speed, and minimize disruption during backups, especially for very large databases.

**Specification:**

**1. Sharding Logic:**

*   The database is initially divided into `n` shards.  `n` is configurable and should be determined based on anticipated data growth and query patterns.
*   A workload prediction module (WPM) analyzes query logs, data access patterns, and transaction rates. The WPM outputs a 'heat map' of data access frequency for each shard.
*   Based on the heat map, shards are dynamically merged or split.  'Hot' shards (frequently accessed) are split into smaller shards. 'Cold' shards (infrequently accessed) are merged into larger ones.
*   The sharding logic is implemented as a microservice to allow independent scaling and updates.

**2. Backup Integration:**

*   The existing rotating incremental backup strategy is applied *per shard*.
*   The WPM feeds shard temperature data to the backup scheduler.
*   **Backup Prioritization:** Shards are backed up based on their 'temperature'. 'Hot' shards are backed up more frequently with a smaller window of acceptable data loss. 'Cold' shards are backed up less frequently, potentially using a delayed or consolidated backup schedule.
*   **Tiered Storage:** Backups of 'cold' shards are automatically archived to lower-cost storage tiers (e.g., object storage, tape).
*   **Metadata Management:** Maintain detailed metadata about each shard, including its current size, temperature, last backup time, and storage location.

**3. Restore Process:**

*   During a restore operation, the system identifies the relevant shards based on the requested data.
*   Only the necessary shards are restored, significantly reducing restore time.
*   The restore process leverages the metadata to locate the most recent backup for each shard.
*   Parallel restoration of multiple shards is supported.

**Pseudocode (Backup Scheduler):**

```
function scheduleBackups(shards):
  for each shard in shards:
    temperature = getShardTemperature(shard)
    backupFrequency = determineBackupFrequency(temperature)
    nextBackupTime = getCurrentTime() + backupFrequency
    scheduleBackupTask(shard, nextBackupTime)
  end for
end function

function determineBackupFrequency(temperature):
  if temperature > 0.8: // Hot Shard
    return 1 hour
  else if temperature > 0.5: // Warm Shard
    return 6 hours
  else: // Cold Shard
    return 24 hours
  end if
end function
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Distributed database system capable of sharding (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB, CockroachDB).
*   Message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for communication between microservices.
*   Object storage for archiving cold backups.
*   Workload prediction module based on machine learning algorithms.
*   Metadata database to store shard and backup information.
