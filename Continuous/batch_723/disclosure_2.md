## Secure Zone Triggered A/V Content Enhancement

**Concept:** Leverage the location-based security system integration (as seen in the patent) to dynamically enhance A/V streams based on perceived threat levels or security zone status. Instead of *preventing* access, the system could modify the stream's content—resolution, audio fidelity, data layers—to provide more useful information during security events.

**Specifications:**

*   **System Components:**
    *   A/V Device (camera/microphone array)
    *   Security System (intrusion detection, motion sensors, etc.)
    *   Backend Server (processing, logic, data storage)
    *   Client Device (display/playback)
*   **Security Zones:** Define virtual “zones” around the A/V device's location (e.g., perimeter, interior, sensitive areas).  These zones can be configured via a user interface.  Each zone will have configurable enhancement parameters.
*   **Event Triggers:** The security system generates event triggers (intrusion detected, motion in a zone, alarm activated).
*   **Dynamic Stream Adjustment:**
    *   **Resolution Scaling:** During security events, the system dynamically scales the A/V stream's resolution *up* (potentially utilizing super-resolution algorithms) to provide clearer imagery.  When no event is occurring, resolution is scaled *down* to conserve bandwidth/storage.
    *   **Audio Enhancement:** Apply noise reduction and directional audio processing to prioritize sounds originating from within security zones.  During events, amplify specific frequency ranges (e.g., speech, breaking glass).
    *   **Data Overlay:** Add contextual data layers to the A/V stream:
        *   **Heatmaps:** Visualize motion or activity within zones.
        *   **Object Recognition:**  Identify detected objects (persons, vehicles, animals) with bounding boxes and labels.
        *   **Zone Highlighting:**  Visually highlight active security zones (e.g., perimeter zones triggered by motion).
        *   **Timestamping & Geolocation:** Overlay precise timestamps and geolocation data onto the stream.
    *   **Data Streaming:**  Utilize a separate data stream to transmit metadata about detected events (e.g., object type, location, timestamp) for integration with other security systems.
*   **Priority Levels:** Define priority levels for different event types (e.g., "low" for motion in a non-sensitive area, "high" for intrusion detection).  Priority levels determine the aggressiveness of stream enhancement.
*   **User Configuration:** Provide a user interface to:
    *   Define security zones
    *   Configure enhancement parameters for each zone and priority level
    *   Adjust stream quality settings
    *   Manage user access controls

**Pseudocode (Backend Server - Event Handling):**

```
function handleSecurityEvent(eventData):
  zoneId = eventData.zoneId
  eventType = eventData.eventType
  priority = determinePriority(eventType)

  enhancementSettings = getEnhancementSettings(zoneId, priority)

  # Adjust Stream Parameters
  resolutionScale = enhancementSettings.resolutionScale
  audioFilter = enhancementSettings.audioFilter
  dataOverlay = enhancementSettings.dataOverlay

  # Send Stream Adjustment Commands to A/V Device
  sendCommand(A/V Device, "SetResolutionScale", resolutionScale)
  sendCommand(A/V Device, "SetAudioFilter", audioFilter)
  sendCommand(A/V Device, "EnableDataOverlay", dataOverlay)

  # Log Event
  logEvent(eventData)
```

**Potential Expansion:** Integration with augmented reality (AR) systems to overlay security information directly onto the live video feed viewed through a mobile device or AR glasses.
