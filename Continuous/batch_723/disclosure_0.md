## Adaptive Sampling with Predictive Branching

**Concept:** Enhance execution trace collection by dynamically adjusting sampling frequency *based on predicted code branch outcomes*. Instead of uniform or event-driven sampling, leverage lightweight prediction (potentially a small, embedded ML model) to anticipate likely execution paths and prioritize sampling along those paths.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Current instruction address, register values (subset – e.g., condition flags, loop counters), recent instruction history (e.g., last 5-10 instructions).
*   **Model:** Lightweight binary classification model (e.g., decision tree, logistic regression) trained to predict the outcome of conditional branches (taken/not taken).  The model should be small enough to execute with minimal overhead.
*   **Output:** Probability score representing the likelihood of each branch outcome.

**2. Adaptive Sampling Controller:**

*   **Input:** Prediction Module output (branch outcome probabilities), current sampling frequency, system load.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **High Confidence:** If prediction confidence (probability exceeding a threshold – e.g., 0.8) and branch is likely taken, *increase* sampling frequency for the next N instructions along the predicted path (N = 5-10).
    *   **Low Confidence:** If prediction confidence is low, *maintain* current sampling frequency.
    *   **Branch Misprediction Detection:** If a branch is mispredicted, *immediately increase* sampling frequency for the mispredicted path to capture the divergent execution.
    *   **System Load Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust sampling frequency based on overall system load. Lower frequency during high load to minimize performance impact.
*   **Output:**  Target sampling frequency.

**3. Integration with Trace Collection:**

*   Standard trace collection mechanism (as in the original patent) is modified to respect the target sampling frequency set by the Adaptive Sampling Controller.
*   Misprediction detection mechanism is integrated to signal the Adaptive Sampling Controller.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Sampling Controller):**

```
function adjust_sampling_frequency(prediction_confidence, branch_outcome, misprediction_detected, system_load):
  current_frequency = get_current_sampling_frequency()
  base_frequency = DEFAULT_SAMPLING_FREQUENCY

  if misprediction_detected:
    target_frequency = base_frequency * MISPREDICTION_MULTIPLIER # e.g., * 2
  else if prediction_confidence > HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
    if branch_outcome == TAKEN:
      target_frequency = base_frequency * BOOST_MULTIPLIER #e.g., * 1.5
    else:
      target_frequency = base_frequency
  else:
    target_frequency = base_frequency

  #Adjust based on System Load (Linear scaling)
  target_frequency = target_frequency * (1 - (system_load / MAX_SYSTEM_LOAD))
  
  set_sampling_frequency(target_frequency)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   The prediction module can be implemented in microcode or as a small, optimized software routine.
*   The Adaptive Sampling Controller can be implemented as a kernel module or as part of the hypervisor.
*   Requires a mechanism to monitor branch outcomes and detect mispredictions (e.g., performance counters, branch trace buffer).
*   Training data for the prediction module can be collected from representative workloads.
