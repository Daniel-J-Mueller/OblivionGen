## Adaptive Authentication Confidence Scoring & Dynamic Friction

**Concept:** Expand upon the risk assessment and time-based cancellation/reversion by introducing a dynamic ‘friction’ system. Instead of a simple time window, the system continuously evaluates confidence in the user’s intent and adapts the authentication requirements *during* the modification process.

**Specifications:**

**1. Confidence Score Generation:**

*   **Input Factors:**
    *   Device fingerprint (hardware, software, location).
    *   Behavioral biometrics (typing speed, mouse movements, touch patterns).
    *   Network characteristics (IP address, ISP, VPN detection).
    *   Modification type (severity of change – e.g., password reset vs. payment method change).
    *   Historical user behavior (typical login times, locations, modification frequencies).
    *   Time since last successful authentication.
*   **Scoring Model:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., random forest, neural network) trained on historical data to generate a continuous Confidence Score ranging from 0.0 (low confidence) to 1.0 (high confidence). This model is *continuously* retrained with new data.

**2. Dynamic Friction Levels:**

*   Define three (or more) Friction Levels:
    *   **Level 1 (Low Friction):** No additional authentication required. Modification proceeds immediately. (Confidence Score > 0.8)
    *   **Level 2 (Medium Friction):** Require a secondary authentication factor (e.g., SMS OTP, email verification, authenticator app push notification). (Confidence Score 0.5 – 0.8)
    *   **Level 3 (High Friction):**  Require multiple secondary authentication factors *and* potentially introduce a brief delay or require answering security questions. (Confidence Score < 0.5)

**3. Real-Time Adaptation:**

*   The system *continuously* monitors the Confidence Score during the modification process. 
*   If the Confidence Score *drops* below a threshold, the friction level is *increased* mid-modification.  For example, if a user initiates a payment method change (initially scored 0.7), but their location suddenly changes to a high-risk area, the score might drop to 0.4, triggering Level 3 friction.
*   If the Confidence Score *increases*, the friction level can be *decreased* or removed.

**4. Cancellation/Reversion Integration:**

*   The existing time-based cancellation/reversion system remains in place as a fallback mechanism.
*   Introduce a dynamic time window based on the current Confidence Score. Higher scores = shorter time window. Lower scores = longer time window.
*   If the user cancels during the dynamic time window *or* the Confidence Score remains persistently low, the modification is reverted.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processModification(user, modificationRequest):
    confidenceScore = calculateConfidenceScore(user, modificationRequest)
    frictionLevel = determineFrictionLevel(confidenceScore)
    applyFriction(user, frictionLevel)

    dynamicTimeWindow = calculateDynamicTimeWindow(confidenceScore)
    sendNotification(user, modificationRequest, dynamicTimeWindow)

    if user cancels within dynamicTimeWindow:
        revertModification(user, modificationRequest)
        return

    if confidenceScore drops below threshold during process:
        increaseFriction(user)
        re-evaluateDynamicTimeWindow()

    performModification(user, modificationRequest)

    if confidenceScore remains low:
        revertModification(user, modificationRequest)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Explainability:** Provide users with clear explanations for why additional authentication is required.  (e.g., “We noticed a change in your location and are verifying your identity.”)
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system should learn from user behavior and adjust the scoring model and friction levels over time.
*   **Integration with Threat Intelligence:** Incorporate external threat intelligence feeds to identify high-risk IPs, locations, or devices.
*   **Account Lockout Prevention:**  Implement mechanisms to prevent account lockout due to repeated failed authentication attempts.
