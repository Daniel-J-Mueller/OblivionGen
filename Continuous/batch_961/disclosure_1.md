## Adaptive Resource Allocation Based on Predictive Load & Application ‘Personality’

**Concept:** The patent discusses redirecting requests based on a runtime environment’s impending reduced capacity. This inspires a system where resource allocation *proactively* adapts, not just reacts, by predicting load *and* understanding each application's unique resource ‘personality’.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Historical request data (volume, type), time of day, day of week, external event feeds (e.g., marketing campaigns, news events).
    *   Process: Employ time series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict request load *per request type* for the next X minutes/hours. Also incorporates correlation analysis between external events and request patterns.
    *   Output: Predicted request load matrix (Request Type x Time) with confidence intervals.

*   **Component 2: Application Profiler:**
    *   Process: Continuously monitors resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O, network) for each running application instance.
    *   Key Metric: “Resource Footprint Signature” – a vector representing the application’s resource consumption pattern under varying load. This signature isn’t just average usage; it captures the *shape* of the resource curve. (e.g. CPU usage spikes rapidly with incoming requests vs. a more gradual increase).
    *   Output: Application Resource Footprint Signature Database.

*   **Component 3: Dynamic Resource Allocator:**
    *   Input: Predicted Request Load Matrix, Application Resource Footprint Signature Database, Current Resource Utilization.
    *   Process:
        1.  **Demand Calculation:**  For each request type, calculate the expected number of concurrent instances needed based on predicted load *and* the Application Resource Footprint Signature (how many instances can a single application handle before performance degrades?).
        2.  **Resource Provisioning:** Dynamically allocates virtual machines (or container instances) *before* demand spikes. Prefers scaling *out* (adding more instances) over scaling *up* (increasing resources per instance) for resilience.
        3.  **Weighted Allocation:** Prioritizes resource allocation based on application importance (configurable weight). Critical applications receive preference.
    *   Output: Scaled application instances, resource allocation plan.

*   **Component 4: Adaptive Load Balancing:**
    *   Input: Resource Allocation Plan, Application Health Checks.
    *   Process:  Directs traffic to the available instances *optimizing for* both load and application health. Implements a 'warm-up' period for newly provisioned instances to allow them to initialize caches and reach peak performance.
    *   Output:  Directed traffic, optimized resource utilization.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Resource Allocator):**

```pseudocode
function allocate_resources(predicted_load, app_signatures, current_utilization):
    instance_counts = {}
    for request_type in predicted_load:
        expected_requests = predicted_load[request_type]
        app_signature = app_signatures[request_type]  // Resource footprint for this request type
        capacity_per_instance = app_signature.capacity  //Requests/instance
        desired_instances = ceiling(expected_requests / capacity_per_instance)
        instance_counts[request_type] = desired_instances

    //Adjust based on current utilization (prevent over-provisioning)
    for request_type in instance_counts:
        current_instances = get_current_instances(request_type)
        if current_instances >= instance_counts[request_type]:
            instance_counts[request_type] = current_instances

    //Provision/De-provision VMs/Containers
    for request_type in instance_counts:
        provision_instances(request_type, instance_counts[request_type])

    return resource_allocation_plan
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive scaling to *predictive* scaling, incorporating a nuanced understanding of application resource ‘personalities’ to optimize allocation.  It considers not just *how much* resource is needed, but *how* the application consumes it, leading to more efficient and resilient infrastructure.
