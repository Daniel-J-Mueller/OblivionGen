## Dynamic Certificate Revocation Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend digital certificate validation to incorporate real-time behavioral biometrics of the certificate requestor to dynamically adjust revocation thresholds and mitigation strategies. This aims to proactively identify and neutralize compromised accounts *before* malicious activity occurs.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Biometric Data Collection Module:**
    *   Integrated into the API request handling process.
    *   Captures keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, rhythm), mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, path), and potentially even subtle audio cues (background noise anomalies during voice authentication if utilized).
    *   Data is anonymized and encrypted immediately upon capture.
    *   Initial baseline is established during legitimate certificate requests, linked to the requesting entity/user.
2.  **Behavioral Anomaly Detection Engine:**
    *   Employs machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) trained on baseline biometric data.
    *   Continuously analyzes incoming biometric data against the established baseline.
    *   Calculates an ‘Anomaly Score’ representing the degree of deviation from normal behavior.
    *   Anomaly score is weighted with pre-defined risk factors (e.g., time of day, geographic location, requested domain sensitivity).
3.  **Dynamic Revocation Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Traditional certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses are augmented by the Anomaly Score.
    *   A configurable threshold determines the level of deviation that triggers enhanced scrutiny.
    *   Below the threshold: Standard validation proceeds.
    *   Above the threshold:
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication Challenge:** Immediately request additional authentication factors (e.g., SMS code, biometric scan).
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Temporarily restrict certificate requests from the entity.
        *   **Certificate Suspension:**  Immediately suspend the certificate, requiring manual review.
        *   **Adaptive Revocation:** Gradually increase the revocation time-to-live (TTL) based on the Anomaly Score, shortening the window of opportunity for attackers.
4.  **Real-time Feedback Loop:**
    *   The system learns from successful/failed authentication attempts and adjusts the baseline biometric profiles accordingly.
    *   A ‘trust score’ is assigned to each entity based on its long-term behavioral patterns.
    *   Alerts are generated for significant deviations from the trust score, indicating potential compromise.
5.  **Integration with Existing Infrastructure:**
    *   Designed as a modular component that can be integrated into existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authority (CA) systems.
    *   Supports standard certificate formats (X.509) and protocols (TLS/SSL).

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine):**

```
function calculate_anomaly_score(biometric_data, baseline_profile):
  // Feature extraction (e.g., keystroke timings, mouse speed)
  features = extract_features(biometric_data)

  // Calculate distance between current features and baseline
  distance = calculate_distance(features, baseline_profile)

  // Apply weighting based on risk factors
  weighted_distance = distance * risk_factor_weight

  // Normalize the distance
  anomaly_score = normalize(weighted_distance)

  return anomaly_score
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Anonymized biometric data from legitimate certificate requests (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, etc.).
*   Risk factor profiles (e.g., domain sensitivity, time of day).
*   User/entity attributes (e.g., location, device type).
