## Adaptive Chunk Prioritization & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the existing block-based storage system with a dynamic chunk prioritization system coupled with predictive prefetching, aiming to significantly reduce replication latency and improve overall storage performance, *especially* during periods of high write activity and recovery from data loss.  This isn't about simply *copying* chunks; it's about anticipating *which* chunks will be needed, and preparing for their replication *before* replication is explicitly triggered.

**Specs:**

*   **Chunk Metadata Enhancement:** Augment existing chunk metadata with the following:
    *   `access_frequency`: Counter tracking how often the chunk is read/written.
    *   `last_modified_time`: Timestamp of last modification.
    *   `replication_status`:  Status of the chunk's replication (e.g., ‘fully replicated’, ‘in progress’, ‘pending’).
    *   `predicted_access_time`: Time at which access is predicted, based on historical access patterns and potentially application hints.
    *   `priority_score`:  Combined score based on `access_frequency`, `last_modified_time`, and `predicted_access_time`.

*   **Priority Scoring Algorithm:** 
    *   The `priority_score` is calculated using a weighted sum:
        `priority_score = (access_frequency * wf) + (1 / (current_time - last_modified_time) * wt) + (1 / (current_time - predicted_access_time) * wp)`
        Where:
            *   `wf`, `wt`, and `wp` are configurable weights.
            *   The `1 / (current_time - …)` terms ensure recent/predicted accesses have a higher weight.

*   **Prefetching Agent:** A background agent monitors chunk metadata and initiates prefetching based on the following criteria:
    *   If a chunk’s `priority_score` exceeds a configurable threshold.
    *   If the `predicted_access_time` is approaching.
    *   The agent proactively transfers the chunk to peer storage nodes *before* a write request arrives.
    *   Prefetching is rate-limited to avoid overwhelming the network.

*   **Write Request Handling:**  
    *   When a write request arrives:
        *   Check if the corresponding chunk is already being prefetched or is fully replicated.
        *   If so, the write can be acknowledged immediately without waiting for replication.
        *   If not, replication is initiated as usual, but with a higher priority assigned to this chunk.

*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  The weights `wf`, `wt`, and `wp` are dynamically adjusted based on system workload and performance metrics.  
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., reinforcement learning) to learn optimal weights based on factors like:
        *   Replication latency.
        *   Write throughput.
        *   Network bandwidth utilization.

*   **Failure Recovery Enhancement:**  During data recovery (e.g., from a node failure):
    *   The system prioritizes replicating chunks with the highest `priority_score`.
    *   Prefetching agent can be temporarily disabled to focus resources on recovery.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Agent):**

```
while (true) {
  for each chunk in chunk_metadata {
    chunk.priority_score = calculate_priority_score(chunk)
    if (chunk.priority_score > prefetch_threshold &&
        chunk.replication_status != 'fully replicated') {
      prefetch_chunk(chunk)
    }
  }
  sleep(prefetch_interval) // configurable interval
}

function prefetch_chunk(chunk) {
  select_peer_node(chunk) // based on network proximity, load, etc.
  transfer_chunk(chunk, peer_node)
  update_chunk_status(chunk, 'in progress')
}
```
