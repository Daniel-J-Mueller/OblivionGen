## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Predictive Power Management

**System Overview:**

This system integrates predictive power management with a localized haptic feedback system. Instead of *automatically* deactivating components, the system proactively communicates impending power-saving actions to the user via subtle haptic cues and offers a short window for override. This fosters user trust and control while still achieving power efficiency.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** A flexible array of micro-actuators integrated into the device casing (e.g., around the edges, on the back surface). Resolution: 1 cm spacing between actuators. Force range: 0-500 mN per actuator.
*   **Proximity/Touch Sensors:** Capacitive proximity sensors integrated alongside the haptic actuators to detect user grip/touch.
*   **Low-Power Processing Unit:** Dedicated low-power processor for managing haptic feedback patterns and sensor data.
*   **Existing Device Components:** Utilizes existing sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, location data) and power management systems.

**Software Specifications & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Predictive Power Management Module:** (Based on patentâ€™s core functionality)

    *   Analyzes usage patterns, remaining power, and contextual information.
    *   Identifies components that *could* be deactivated to extend battery life.
    *   Calculates a "power-saving potential" score for each component.
2.  **Haptic Feedback Mapping Module:**

    *   Maps power-saving potential scores to specific haptic patterns.
        *   Low potential: Gentle, localized vibration.
        *   Medium potential: Rhythmic pulsing sensation.
        *   High potential: More pronounced and spatially distributed vibration.
    *   Dynamically adjusts haptic pattern intensity and location based on user grip/touch.
3.  **User Override Mechanism:**

    *   **Gesture Recognition:** Simple swipe gesture over the haptic array to temporarily disable a predicted power-saving action for a user-defined duration.
    *   **Confirmation Prompt (Optional):**  If the system predicts a significant power-saving action, a subtle visual prompt could appear on the screen alongside the haptic feedback, offering a clear "Accept/Reject" option.

**Pseudocode (Main Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    PowerSavingPotential = PredictivePowerManagementModule()
    HapticPattern = HapticFeedbackMappingModule(PowerSavingPotential)
    ActivateHapticActuators(HapticPattern)

    IF UserGestureDetected():
        DisablePredictedAction()
        ResetHapticPattern()

    IF SignificantActionPredicted():
        DisplayConfirmationPrompt()
        IF UserAccepts():
            ExecuteAction()
        ELSE:
            ResetHapticPattern()

    WAIT(0.1 seconds)
ENDLOOP
```

**Novelty & Advantages:**

*   **User Agency:**  Shifts from *automatic* power management to *informed* power management.
*   **Reduced User Frustration:** Provides advance warning of impending actions, allowing users to prepare or override if necessary.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Haptic patterns can be customized based on user activity (e.g., a different pattern when the user is actively watching a video versus reading an article).
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** Suble haptic feedback adds a layer of sophistication to the device interface.
*   **Potential for Training:** Users could learn to anticipate power-saving actions and adjust their behavior accordingly, further extending battery life.
