## Automated Compartment Relocation System

**Concept:** Expand the storage compartment module concept into a dynamic, robotic system capable of relocating compartments based on order fulfillment status and predicted pickup times. This effectively creates a 'living' pickup locker system optimizing space and minimizing customer wait times.

**Specifications:**

*   **Compartment Modules:** Standardized module size (e.g., 2ft x 2ft x 2ft) with integrated locking mechanism, presence detection, and basic status indicators (LEDs).  Each module is equipped with robust, low-profile wheels for movement. Power is supplied via inductive charging.
*   **Robotic Transport System:** A network of floor-level robotic 'bots' (small, wheeled robots) dedicated to moving storage compartment modules.  Bots communicate via a mesh network.
*   **Central Control System:**  Software to manage compartment locations, order status, bot assignments, and overall system efficiency.
*   **Compartment Identification:** Each module features a unique RFID tag and a visual barcode for redundant identification.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   **'Home' Bays:** Fixed locations where empty modules 'dock' to await assignment.
    *   **'Active' Grid:**  A defined area of the floor designated for module movement and customer access.
    *   **Customer Access Points:** Designated zones where customers can safely retrieve their packages.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  An order is received, and an empty module is assigned to it.
    2.  The module is moved to a staging area for item placement.
    3.  Once the item is placed, the module is moved to an available 'Active' grid position, optimized for predicted pickup time and customer flow.
    4.  Upon customer arrival (identified via app/QR code), the module is directed to a Customer Access Point.
    5.  After pickup, the module returns to a 'Home' bay to await the next assignment.

**Pseudocode (Module Assignment & Movement):**

```
FUNCTION AssignModule(orderID):
  // Check for available modules in 'Home' bays
  moduleID = FindAvailableModule()
  IF moduleID == NULL:
    //Handle case where no modules are available (e.g., queue the order)
    RETURN Error // or add to waiting queue

  //Assign Module to Order
  SetModuleStatus(moduleID, "Assigned")
  SetOrderModule(orderID, moduleID)

  //Move Module to Staging Area
  MoveModule(moduleID, "Staging Area")

  RETURN moduleID

FUNCTION MoveModule(moduleID, destination):
  //Find shortest path from current location to destination using a grid map
  path = FindPath(moduleID, destination)

  //Assign a bot to move the module
  botID = AssignBot(path)

  //Send command to bot to move module along path
  SendBotCommand(botID, "Move", path, moduleID)

  //Update module location
  SetModuleLocation(moduleID, destination)
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Positioning:** AI algorithm to predict pickup times based on customer behavior and order history, proactively positioning modules for faster retrieval.
*   **Dynamic Grid Adjustment:** The 'Active' grid can dynamically adjust its size and layout based on order volume and customer density.
*   **Multi-Level System:** Extend the system vertically using robotic lifts, increasing storage capacity in limited spaces.
*   **Automated Compartment Cleaning/Sanitization:** Integrate UV-C sanitization into each module after each pickup.
