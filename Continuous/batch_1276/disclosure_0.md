## Adaptive Power Harvesting & Distribution – Kinetic & Thermal Integration

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic power redistribution to incorporate energy harvesting from kinetic and thermal sources, creating a self-sustaining or significantly extended runtime system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Piezoelectric sensors integrated into device housing (back cover, frame). Optimized for pressure, vibration, and bending. Density: 1 sensor per 50mm<sup>2</sup>.
    *   Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) placed strategically near heat-generating components (processor, battery) and exposed surface area. TEG material: Bismuth Telluride alloy.
    *   Ambient temperature sensor.
    *   Internal device temperature sensors (multiple points).
*   **Power Conditioning:**
    *   Rectifier/Regulator circuits for both piezoelectric and TEG outputs.
    *   DC-DC Boost converters to step up low-voltage harvested energy to usable levels (3.3V, 5V).
    *   Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms implemented in firmware to optimize energy extraction from both sources.
*   **Energy Storage:**
    *   Supercapacitor bank (integrated with existing battery) for buffering harvested energy. Capacity: 500mF, Voltage: 3.7V.
    *   Energy Management Unit (EMU) to prioritize energy flow – direct to load, charge battery, charge supercapacitor.
*   **Firmware/Control Algorithm:**
    *   Real-time monitoring of harvested energy levels (piezoelectric, TEG).
    *   Predictive algorithm to estimate future energy harvesting potential based on user activity/environment.
    *   Dynamic allocation of harvested energy based on device state, battery level, and predicted usage.
    *   Prioritization rules:
        1.  Sustain critical device functions (e.g., emergency communication) at all costs.
        2.  Charge battery when excess energy is available.
        3.  Power non-critical functions (e.g., display brightness) with harvested energy.
    *   Learning algorithm to adapt prioritization rules based on user behavior.
*   **System Architecture:**

    ```pseudocode
    // Main Loop
    while (device_on) {
        // Read sensor data
        piezo_voltage = read_piezoelectric_sensor();
        teg_voltage = read_thermoelectric_generator();
        battery_level = read_battery_level();
        device_current = read_device_current();

        // Calculate available harvested energy
        harvested_energy = (piezo_voltage * piezo_current) + (teg_voltage * teg_current);

        // Determine power needs
        required_power = device_current;

        // If harvested energy exceeds power needs
        if (harvested_energy > required_power) {
            // Power device with harvested energy
            power_device_with_harvested_energy(harvested_energy);
            // Charge battery with excess energy
            charge_battery_with_excess_energy(harvested_energy - required_power);
        } else {
            // Power device with battery
            power_device_with_battery(required_power);
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Housing Integration:**
    *   Reinforced housing materials to maximize piezoelectric energy generation from device handling.
    *   Heat dissipation design optimized for TEG efficiency.

* **Operational Modes**
    * **Static Harvest:** Continual scavenging of ambient thermal differentials and minor vibrations.
    * **Kinetic Boost:** Enhanced harvesting during device movement, walking, running, etc.
    * **Emergency Mode:** Prioritizes critical functions powered solely by harvested energy when battery is depleted.
