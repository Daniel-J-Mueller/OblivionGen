## Secure Data 'Shadowing' and Predictive Access

**Concept:** Extend the existing secure access framework to proactively ‘shadow’ data access patterns and *predict* future data requests, pre-encrypting and staging data for faster delivery. This isn’t just about secure access, it’s about *anticipating* secure access.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** A module residing within the provider network. Monitors all data requests, identifying frequently accessed data items, requestor/customer pairs, and time-based patterns. Uses machine learning to predict future requests.
*   **Data Shadowing Engine (DSE):**  Based on APA predictions, the DSE proactively fetches (from the customer’s device) and encrypts data identified as likely to be requested.  It does *not* move the data, only creates an encrypted ‘shadow’ on the provider network, using a temporary symmetric key.
*   **Key Orchestration Module (KOM):** Manages symmetric keys used for data shadowing, ensuring secure generation, storage, and eventual destruction. It also handles the asymmetric key exchange for initial access and subsequent decryption.
*   **Pre-Fetch Cache:** A temporary storage location on the provider network where the encrypted ‘shadow’ data resides.  Limited lifespan, dynamically sized based on prediction accuracy.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Monitoring & Prediction:** The APA continuously monitors data access requests.  It builds a predictive model based on historical data.
2.  **Proactive Shadowing:**  When the APA predicts a high probability of a future request, it triggers the DSE.
3.  **Data Fetch & Encryption:**  The DSE requests the data item from the customer’s device. The customer *must* acknowledge the request (consent is critical). The data is encrypted using a newly generated symmetric key.
4.  **Shadow Storage:** The encrypted data and the symmetric key (encrypted with the requestor's public key, if available, otherwise a new key pair is generated and the requestor must procure the key) are stored in the Pre-Fetch Cache.
5.  **Request Interception:** When a requestor submits a request, the system first checks the Pre-Fetch Cache.
6.  **Cache Hit:** If a match is found, the encrypted data is immediately delivered to the requestor. The corresponding decryption key (already encrypted with the requestor’s public key) is also sent.
7.  **Cache Miss:** If no match is found, the standard data retrieval process from the customer’s device (as defined in the original patent) is initiated.
8. **Data Expiration:** Encrypted shadowed data has a pre-defined lifespan. After expiration, the data is purged from the Pre-Fetch Cache. This mitigates security risks and ensures data freshness.

**III. Pseudocode (KOM - Key Orchestration Module):**

```pseudocode
function generateShadowKey():
  // Generate a new AES-256 symmetric key
  key = generateAESKey()
  return key

function encryptSymmetricKey(symmetricKey, recipientPublicKey):
  // Encrypt the symmetric key using RSA with the recipient's public key
  encryptedKey = encryptRSA(symmetricKey, recipientPublicKey)
  return encryptedKey

function decryptSymmetricKey(encryptedKey, privateKey):
  // Decrypt the symmetric key using RSA with the private key
  symmetricKey = decryptRSA(encryptedKey, privateKey)
  return symmetricKey

function keyRotationPolicy(keyID):
  // Check if key needs rotation based on age/usage
  if (keyAge(keyID) > MAX_KEY_AGE or keyUsage(keyID) > MAX_KEY_USAGE):
    // Generate new key and invalidate old key
    generateNewKey(keyID)
    invalidateKey(keyID)
```

**IV.  Security Considerations:**

*   **Customer Consent:**  Explicit consent is required before any data is proactively fetched and encrypted.
*   **Data Expiration:** Shadowed data has a limited lifespan to minimize exposure.
*   **Key Management:** Robust key management practices are crucial to protect symmetric and asymmetric keys.
*   **Auditing:** All data access and shadowing activities are logged for auditing purposes.
