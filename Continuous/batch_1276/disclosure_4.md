## Dynamic Device Context & Predictive Access

**Concept:** Expand upon the three-way handshake's secure pairing by dynamically adjusting access policies *after* initial pairing, based on inferred user context and predicted device usage patterns. This moves beyond static access control to a more fluid and responsive system.

**Specs:**

1.  **Contextual Data Aggregation Module:**
    *   Input: Device usage data (frequency, duration, type of interactions), User activity data (location, time of day, calendar events, connected apps – with appropriate permissions), Environmental data (temperature, light levels – accessed via user device sensors).
    *   Processing: Employ a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, simple neural network) to infer user ‘modes’ (e.g., 'commuting', 'working', 'relaxing', 'sleeping’). Continuously update the model with new data.
    *   Output: A 'context vector' representing the current user state.

2.  **Predictive Access Engine:**
    *   Input: Context vector, Device capabilities, Historical access logs, User-defined access rules (e.g., "always allow thermostat control when at home").
    *   Processing: Predict the *likely* actions the user will take with the IoT device. Assign a ‘confidence score’ to each predicted action.
    *   Output: A prioritized list of allowed actions, along with corresponding access levels (e.g., read-only, limited control, full control).

3.  **Dynamic Access Policy Handler:**
    *   Input: Prioritized list of allowed actions, Current access policy, Device state.
    *   Processing: Compare the predicted actions with the current access policy. Adjust the policy *on-the-fly* to allow or restrict access. Implement a ‘grace period’ for unexpected actions, requiring explicit user confirmation.  Implement a 'rollback' mechanism if the predicted usage is incorrect.
    *   Output: Updated access policy enforced on the IoT device.

4.  **Secure Communication Protocol Enhancement:**
    *   Add a 'context update' field to the existing communication protocol. This field carries the updated access policy and associated confidence scores.
    *   Implement encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect the context update data.
    *   Rate-limit context updates to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Access Policy Handler):**

```
function adjustAccessPolicy(predictedActions, currentPolicy, deviceState):
  for each action in predictedActions:
    if action not allowed in currentPolicy:
      if deviceState allows action (e.g., device is powered on):
        if confidenceScore > threshold:
          add action to currentPolicy with appropriate access level
        else:
          log potential unauthorized access
          request user confirmation
          if user approves:
            add action to currentPolicy
          else:
            deny access
  remove any actions from currentPolicy that are no longer predicted

  return updated currentPolicy
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond static access control based *solely* on pairing, introducing adaptive security that learns from user behavior and anticipates needs. This enhances both security and user experience by minimizing friction while maximizing protection. The predictive element based on a learned user model is the core differentiator. This can also be employed as a sort of ‘honeypot’ system to discover malicious intent by watching for usage outside the learned model.
