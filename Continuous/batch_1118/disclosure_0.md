## Modular, Self-Organizing Power Mesh for Distributed Aerial Vehicle Fleets

**Concept:** A distributed power system for swarms of aerial vehicles, where each vehicle functions as a node in a self-healing, self-optimizing power mesh. This moves beyond individual vehicle power management to a fleet-level energy resource, potentially enabling cooperative flight profiles and extended operational ranges.

**Specifications:**

*   **Power Module Replication:** Utilize power modules functionally equivalent to those in the provided patent – boost inductor, current sensor, transistor pair, gate driver, output capacitor, error amplifier, controller. However, standardize the physical interface – mechanical connectors & data communication protocol – across all aerial vehicles in the fleet.
*   **Bidirectional Power Transfer:**  Integrate high-frequency (kHz range) power transfer coils/inductors into each power module.  These coils enable *inductive power transfer* between adjacent vehicles.  Each vehicle’s controller manages power flow – both receiving and transmitting – to optimize fleet-wide energy distribution. This system must work reliably in a dynamically changing proximity field.
*   **Fleet-Level Communication:** Implement a robust, low-latency communication network (e.g., a mesh network using dedicated radio frequencies or optical links) between all vehicles. This network shares critical data:
    *   Individual vehicle battery state of charge (SoC)
    *   Current power draw (propulsion, sensors, communication)
    *   Predicted power needs (based on flight plan/mission)
    *   Proximity data (relative positions of other vehicles)
*   **Centralized/Distributed Control:** A hybrid control scheme:
    *   **Distributed:** Each vehicle’s controller independently manages local power flow, prioritizing its own needs and responding to immediate requests from nearby vehicles.
    *   **Centralized (optional):** A ground station or designated “lead” vehicle can act as a coordinator, optimizing the overall fleet energy distribution based on mission objectives.
*   **Adaptive Power Routing:** The fleet-level control system calculates optimal power routes based on:
    *   Vehicle proximity
    *   Battery SoC
    *   Predicted energy demands
    *   Dynamic adjustments to flight plans.

    Algorithm Pseudocode:

    ```
    // Vehicle A receives a request for X Watts from Vehicle B
    IF (Vehicle A.SoC > Minimum Threshold) THEN
      Calculate Distance(Vehicle A, Vehicle B)
      Calculate Power Loss(Distance)
      IF (Vehicle A.SoC - Power Loss > Minimum Threshold) THEN
        Initiate Inductive Power Transfer(Vehicle B, X Watts)
        Update SoC(Vehicle A, Vehicle B)
      ELSE
        Request Assistance(Fleet, Vehicle B, X Watts) //Broadcast request
      ENDIF
    ELSE
      Request Assistance(Fleet, Vehicle B, X Watts) //Broadcast request
    ENDIF
    ```
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Redundancy is built-in. If one vehicle experiences a power module failure, the system automatically reroutes power around the failed module, ensuring continued operation. This requires constant monitoring of the power transfer coils and load balancing.
* **Module Standardization:** All modules have a physical 'footprint' of 2” x 6” as outlined in the patent, and can be mechanically mounted on any vehicle. Each module has a standardized mounting rail interface.
* **Data Telemetry:** Transmit telemetry related to power routing, coil efficiency, battery health and total system power consumption to a ground station.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Extended flight times for the fleet.
*   Increased operational range.
*   Improved mission reliability.
*   Reduced overall energy consumption.
*   Scalability for large swarms of aerial vehicles.

**Novelty:** The key innovation is the active *sharing* of power between vehicles in flight, creating a distributed energy resource. This moves beyond simply improving individual vehicle power management and unlocks new possibilities for cooperative flight and extended operations.
