## Dynamic Narrative Weaving via AI-Driven Asset Mutation

**Core Concept:** Extend the interactive digital asset system to allow *real-time* modification of asset characteristics (texture, geometry, animation) based on user interaction *and* a dynamically generated narrative framework. Instead of simply revealing information *about* an asset, subtly *change* the asset itself to reflect evolving story elements or user choices.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Narrative Engine:**
    *   An AI (LLM-based) 'Narrative Director' module. Input: User interaction data (object focus, dialogue choices, time spent observing, etc.), current game state, asset metadata, pre-defined narrative arcs.
    *   Output: A ‘Mutation Vector’ – a set of parameters defining how assets should change. Parameters include: texture adjustments (color, detail, damage), geometric alterations (shape, size, wear & tear), animation tweaks (speed, style, expression), and even partial model swaps.  The Mutation Vector also includes a *timing* component – when/how quickly the changes should occur.
    *   LLM Fine-tuning: Train the LLM on examples of ‘narrative beats’ mapped to asset mutation parameters.  This establishes the relationship between story events and visual changes.

2.  **Asset Mutation Pipeline:**
    *   ‘Mutable Asset’ format: Digital assets are structured with layers or parameters exposed for modification. For example, a character model might have separate layers for clothing, skin texture, and facial expression controls.
    *   Real-time Rendering Integration: The rendering engine must support dynamic asset modification without significant performance loss. Utilize shader graphs and procedural generation techniques.
    *   Mutation Queue: A system to manage and prioritize multiple mutation requests, ensuring smooth transitions and preventing visual glitches.

3.  **Interaction Mapping:**
    *   Contextual Awareness: The system analyzes user interaction to determine the *meaning* behind the action. E.g., repeatedly examining a damaged sword might trigger a mutation related to its history or repair quest.
    *   Emotional Resonance: Use sentiment analysis on user voice/text input to influence asset mutation. A positive interaction might make an asset appear more vibrant, while a negative interaction could introduce decay or corruption.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Engine):**

```
function GenerateMutationVector(userInteraction, gameState, assetMetadata):
    narrativeBeat = LLM.InferNarrativeBeat(userInteraction, gameState)
    mutationParameters = LLM.MapNarrativeBeatToMutation(narrativeBeat, assetMetadata)
    timing = DetermineTiming(userInteraction, narrativeBeat) //e.g., subtle over time, immediate on key event

    mutationVector = {
        parameters: mutationParameters,
        timing: timing
    }

    return mutationVector
```

**Example Scenario:**

A player repeatedly examines a seemingly ordinary stone statue.

1.  **User Interaction:**  Focus on the statue, long observation time.
2.  **Narrative Engine:** Infers a ‘Hidden History’ narrative beat.
3.  **Mutation Vector:** Includes parameters to subtly crack the statue’s surface, reveal faint inscriptions, and change its texture to appear older.
4.  **Rendering Engine:** Applies the mutations in real-time, creating a sense of discovery and mystery.
