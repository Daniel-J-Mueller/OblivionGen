## Dynamic Backbone "Shadowing" for Predictive Capacity

**Concept:** Extend the backbone performance analysis to proactively "shadow" traffic flows with synthetic traffic, creating a real-time predictive model of capacity bottlenecks *before* they impact live users.

**Specification:**

1.  **Synthetic Traffic Generation:** Introduce a module within the backbone service capable of generating synthetic traffic flows mirroring patterns of live traffic (identified via the active tunnel data database). These synthetic flows will utilize various packet sizes, protocols, and source/destination pairs representative of the existing network load.

2.  **"Shadow" Flow Injection:**  The backbone service will intelligently inject these synthetic flows along the same paths as active tunnels (determined using network topology database data). Injection rate will be adaptive, based on current network utilization.  Low initial rate, incrementally increased until predictive indicators are triggered.

3.  **Predictive Indicator Calculation:**  The core innovation.  Rather than simply *reporting* available bandwidth, the system will monitor the *change* in latency and packet loss experienced by the synthetic traffic as injection rates increase.  

    *   A "Capacity Gradient" metric is calculated: (Change in Latency / Change in Injection Rate) + (Change in Packet Loss / Change in Injection Rate).  A steeper gradient indicates a rapidly approaching capacity limit.
    *   This gradient is calculated *per-hop* (transit center), enabling precise identification of bottleneck locations.

4.  **Proactive Adjustment:** 
    *   If the Capacity Gradient exceeds a predefined threshold, the backbone service triggers automated adjustments:
        *   **Traffic Shaping:**  Prioritize critical traffic flows.
        *   **Dynamic Routing:**  Redirect traffic to alternative paths (if available).
        *   **Capacity Pre-provisioning:**  Initiate requests for additional bandwidth on affected links.

5.  **Data Integration & Reporting:** The predictive indicators (Capacity Gradient, bottleneck locations, pre-provisioning requests) are integrated into the existing performance reporting system. Historical data is used to refine the prediction models and optimize the adjustment strategies.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Backbone Service - Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Collect Performance Data (Existing)
    performanceData = getPerformanceData();

    // 2. Generate/Manage Synthetic Traffic
    syntheticTraffic = manageSyntheticTraffic(performanceData);

    // 3. Calculate Capacity Gradient
    capacityGradient = calculateCapacityGradient(syntheticTraffic, performanceData);

    // 4. Analyze Gradient & Trigger Actions
    if (capacityGradient > threshold) {
        // Traffic Shaping
        shapeTraffic();
        // Dynamic Routing
        routeTraffic();
        // Pre-provision Capacity
        provisionCapacity();
    }

    // 5. Report Performance & Predictions
    reportPerformance(performanceData, capacityGradient);
}

// Function: calculateCapacityGradient
function calculateCapacityGradient(syntheticTraffic, performanceData) {
    // For each hop:
    for (hop in performanceData.hops) {
        // Calculate change in latency and packet loss due to synthetic traffic
        deltaLatency = hop.latency - hop.baseLatency;
        deltaPacketLoss = hop.packetLoss - hop.basePacketLoss;

        // Calculate capacity gradient
        gradient = (deltaLatency / deltaInjectionRate) + (deltaPacketLoss / deltaInjectionRate);

        // Store gradient for hop
        hop.capacityGradient = gradient;
    }

    return hop.capacityGradient;
}
```
