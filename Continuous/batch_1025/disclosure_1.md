## Adaptive Manifest Generation for Interactive Media

**Concept:** Extend the DASH manifest concept to support truly interactive media experiences, enabling client-side modification of the media stream *during* playback based on user input, and dynamically adapting the manifest to reflect those changes. This moves beyond simple quality selection and allows for branching narratives, personalized content insertion, and real-time scene manipulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Manifest Extension:** Introduce a new XML element within the DASH manifest called `<InteractiveSequence>`. This element will contain a series of `<Scene>` elements. Each `<Scene>` defines a segment of the media experience.
*   **Scene Definition:** Each `<Scene>` element includes:
    *   `id`: Unique identifier for the scene.
    *   `media`: References the standard DASH `<Representation>` elements for the media content of that scene (video, audio, etc.).
    *   `triggers`: A list of `<Trigger>` elements.
*   **Trigger Definition:** Each `<Trigger>` element defines a condition that, when met, causes a transition to a different scene.
    *   `event`: The type of user event (e.g., "button_press", "location_change", "time_elapsed").
    *   `parameter`: Data associated with the event (e.g., the button pressed, the location coordinates, the elapsed time).
    *   `nextScene`: The `id` of the scene to transition to if the trigger condition is met.
*   **Client-Side Engine:** The client device must implement an "Interactive Manifest Engine" that:
    1.  Parses the extended DASH manifest.
    2.  Monitors for user events and other trigger conditions.
    3.  When a trigger condition is met, dynamically updates the currently playing scene and loads the media content for the `nextScene`.
    4.  The engine dynamically creates a new manifest or manifest fragment that represents the user's current path through the interactive experience.
*   **Dynamic Manifest Generation:** The server will need the ability to generate these extended manifests. A tool could allow content creators to visually define the interactive flow, with the tool automatically generating the XML.
*   **Metadata Integration:** Allow arbitrary metadata to be attached to `<Scene>` and `<Trigger>` elements to provide additional context and functionality.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Engine - Simplified):**

```
function loadManifest(manifestURL):
  manifest = parseManifest(manifestURL)
  currentScene = manifest.initialScene  // Defined in manifest
  loadScene(currentScene)

function loadScene(sceneID):
  scene = findSceneByID(sceneID)
  mediaRepresentations = scene.media
  // Load and play media representations

function handleEvent(eventType, eventData):
  for trigger in currentScene.triggers:
    if trigger.event == eventType and trigger.parameter == eventData:
      nextSceneID = trigger.nextScene
      currentScene = findSceneByID(nextSceneID)
      loadScene(currentScene)
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Interactive Storytelling:** Branching narratives where user choices determine the outcome.
*   **Personalized Advertising:** Dynamically inserting ads based on user preferences.
*   **Virtual Reality Experiences:** Allowing users to explore virtual environments and interact with objects.
*   **Gamified Learning:** Creating interactive educational content.
