## Temporal Relationship Weighting & Decay

**Concept:** Expand the knowledge graph to incorporate a "confidence" score for relationships, heavily weighted by the *time* of assertion. Recent assertions are given significantly higher weight, while older assertions decay in influence. This introduces a dynamic element to knowledge, allowing the system to reflect evolving understanding and correct outdated information.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Relationship Metadata:** Each relationship within the knowledge graph (e.g., "is married to," "is the capital of") must have associated metadata:
    *   `assertion_timestamp`: A precise timestamp indicating when the relationship was initially asserted (user input, automated ingestion, etc.).
    *   `assertion_user_id`: Identifier of the user asserting the relationship. This allows for reputation weighting (see below).
    *   `endorsement_count`: An integer tracking the number of other users who have explicitly endorsed the relationship.
    *   `confidence_score`: A floating-point value representing the current confidence in the relationship. This is *calculated*, not directly set.

2.  **Confidence Score Calculation:** The `confidence_score` is computed as follows:

    ```
    confidence = base_weight * time_decay_factor + endorsement_weight * (endorsement_count / max_possible_endorsements) + user_reputation_weight * user_reputation_score
    ```

    *   `base_weight`: A configurable constant (e.g., 0.5) representing the initial weight of the assertion.
    *   `time_decay_factor`: Calculated based on the `assertion_timestamp` and a configurable `decay_halflife` (e.g., 3 months). Formula: `exp(-ln(2) * (current_time - assertion_timestamp) / decay_halflife)`.
    *   `endorsement_weight`: Configurable constant (e.g., 0.3) controlling the influence of endorsements.
    *   `max_possible_endorsements`: An estimate of the total number of users who *could* potentially endorse a relationship. This prevents artificially high scores for relationships with few opportunities for endorsement.
    *    `user_reputation_weight`: Configurable constant (e.g., 0.2) weighting user's expertise within the system.
    *   `user_reputation_score`: User’s score within the system, reflective of their accuracy when asserting relationships.

3.  **Query Processing Modification:** When processing a natural language query:
    *   During graph traversal, relationships are weighted by their `confidence_score`.
    *   Relationships with low `confidence_score` (below a configurable threshold) are either excluded from traversal or assigned a lower priority.
    *   Results are ranked based on the aggregate `confidence_score` of the relationships supporting them.

4.  **Endorsement Mechanism:** A user interface element (e.g., a "confirm" or "endorse" button) allows users to explicitly endorse relationships they believe are accurate. This increments the `endorsement_count`.

5.  **Decay Scheduling:** A background process periodically recalculates the `confidence_score` for all relationships, applying the time decay factor.

6.  **User Reputation System:**
    *   Track the accuracy of each user’s assertions (e.g., by comparing their assertions to later-confirmed or corrected information).
    *   Calculate a `user_reputation_score` based on their assertion accuracy. This score is used to weight their contributions to the `confidence_score`.



**Novelty:** While the concept of weighted relationships exists, integrating *temporal decay* with a *user reputation system* and tying it directly into query processing introduces a dynamic, self-correcting element to the knowledge graph. This addresses the problem of outdated or inaccurate information that naturally accumulates in any large knowledge base. This design explicitly addresses the need to manage *belief* in a knowledge graph as new information comes to light.
