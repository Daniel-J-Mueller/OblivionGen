## Dynamic Soundscape Generation via Procedural Harmonics

**Concept:** Extending the idea of pre-mixed sound files representing multiple instances of a single sound type, this system generates sounds *in real-time* by procedurally combining harmonic components. This allows for a vastly greater degree of sonic variation and realism, exceeding the limitations of pre-recorded files.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Harmonic Library:** A database containing fundamental harmonic profiles for various sound *categories* (e.g., footsteps, impacts, ambient textures).  These profiles aren't individual sounds, but *rulesets* defining the frequency, amplitude, and phase relationships of harmonic components. Profiles are categorized by material (wood, metal, earth), size, and impact force.

2.  **Event Parameters:**  Game or application provides ‘event’ parameters to the system. These are not simply ‘play footstep’ requests, but include:
    *   `Surface Type`: (e.g., wood, stone, grass) – selects base harmonic profile.
    *   `Impact Force`: (0.0 – 1.0) – scales amplitude of harmonics.
    *   `Material Size`: (small, medium, large) – adjusts fundamental frequencies.
    *   `Doppler Shift`: (velocity vector) - applies Doppler effect.
    *   `Occlusion`: (0.0 - 1.0) – filters frequencies based on obstruction.
    *   `Reverb Profile`: (preset or procedural) – controls reverb characteristics.
    *   `Random Seed`: (integer) – introduces controlled randomness to harmonic variations.

3.  **Harmonic Synthesis Engine:** This engine takes the event parameters and the base harmonic profile and synthesizes the sound *in real-time*.
    *   **Additive Synthesis:**  Utilizes additive synthesis, combining sine waves (or other harmonic waveforms) according to the profile.
    *   **Frequency Modulation:** Applies frequency modulation (FM) to individual harmonics for more complex timbral characteristics.
    *   **Amplitude Envelope:** Creates realistic attack, decay, sustain, and release (ADSR) envelopes for each harmonic.  Envelope parameters are linked to Impact Force.
    *   **Phase Randomization:**  Applies controlled randomization to the phase of individual harmonics to simulate natural variations.
    *   **Spatialization:** Applies binaural panning and HRTF filtering for realistic 3D audio.

4.  **Dynamic Profile Blending:**  The system allows for *blending* between harmonic profiles. For example, a footstep on a wooden floor with a crack might blend the ‘wood’ profile with a ‘crack’ profile (defined by specific frequency resonances).  Blend weight is determined by environmental conditions.

5.  **Procedural Reverb Generation:** Reverb isn't loaded from a file; it's generated procedurally based on the environment’s geometry and material properties.  Ray tracing is used to estimate reverberation time and early reflections.

**Pseudocode:**

```
Function GenerateSound(EventParams):
    BaseProfile = LookupProfile(EventParams.SurfaceType)
    ModifiedProfile = ApplyModifications(BaseProfile, EventParams) // Scale amplitude, adjust frequency, etc.

    HarmonicComponents = CreateHarmonicList(ModifiedProfile)

    For Each Component in HarmonicComponents:
        Frequency = Component.Frequency
        Amplitude = Component.Amplitude * EventParams.ImpactForce
        Phase = RandomPhase(EventParams.RandomSeed)
        Waveform = SineWave(Frequency, Amplitude, Phase)
        Output += Waveform

    ApplySpatialization(Output, EventParams.Position, EventParams.Velocity)
    ApplyProceduralReverb(Output, EnvironmentGeometry, EnvironmentMaterials)

    Return Output
```

**Engineering Notes:**

*   Optimization is crucial for real-time performance.  Waveform generation and spatialization algorithms must be highly efficient.
*   Memory usage can be reduced by storing harmonic profiles in a compressed format.
*   The system should be designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new harmonic profiles and synthesis algorithms.
*   Integration with existing audio engines should be straightforward.
