## Temporal Entity Graphing & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the entity relationship mapping to incorporate a temporal dimension, allowing for prediction of entity interactions and future states. The existing patent focuses on *identifying* relationships; this expands to *forecasting* them.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Input:**
    *   Ingest a time-series of documents. Each document is timestamped.
    *   Support multiple document types: text, reports, news feeds, social media posts, log files.
    *   Implement an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline to handle image/scan-based documents, as detailed in claim 17 of the source patent.

2.  **Entity & Relationship Extraction (Enhanced):**
    *   Utilize the existing entity and relationship identification methods detailed in the source patent.
    *   Augment relationship extraction with temporal qualifiers:
        *   **Event triggers:** Identify verbs or phrases signaling changes in relationships (e.g., "acquired," "merged," "discontinued," "appointed").
        *   **Duration:** Extract or infer the duration of relationships.
        *   **Frequency:** Determine how often interactions occur.

3.  **Temporal Graph Construction:**
    *   Represent entities as nodes in a graph.
    *   Edges represent relationships.
    *   Each edge is assigned a *temporal profile*:
        *   **Start Time:** When the relationship began.
        *   **End Time:** When the relationship ended (or "present" if ongoing).
        *   **Confidence Score:** A measure of certainty in the temporal data (based on evidence in the documents).
        *   **Trend:** (Increasing, Decreasing, Stable) - derived from the frequency of related mentions over time.

4.  **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model temporal dependencies in the graph.
    *   Input: The historical temporal graph data.
    *   Output: Predicted future states of the graph:
        *   **Relationship formation:** Probability of a new relationship forming between two entities.
        *   **Relationship dissolution:** Probability of an existing relationship ending.
        *   **Relationship strength change:** Predicted change in the strength/frequency of an existing relationship.

5.  **User Interface (Interactive):**
    *   Visualize the temporal graph.
    *   Allow users to:
        *   Select specific entities and view their relationship history.
        *   Explore predicted future states.
        *   Override predictions with manual corrections (feedback loop for model improvement).
        *   Filter the graph by time range and entity type.
        *   Display confidence scores for predictions.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_future_state(historical_graph, prediction_horizon):
  # historical_graph:  Temporal graph representing past relationships
  # prediction_horizon: Number of time steps to predict into the future

  lstm_model = load_trained_lstm_model() # Model trained on historical data

  predicted_graphs = []

  for time_step in range(prediction_horizon):
    input_data = extract_graph_features(historical_graph) # Convert graph to vector representation
    predicted_features = lstm_model.predict(input_data)
    predicted_graph = reconstruct_graph_from_features(predicted_features)
    predicted_graphs.append(predicted_graph)
    historical_graph = predicted_graph # Use the prediction as the new historical state

  return predicted_graphs
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond static relationship mapping to dynamic prediction, introducing a temporal dimension and machine learning to forecast future entity interactions. It builds upon the source patent's foundation of identifying relationships, but adds a proactive forecasting capability.
