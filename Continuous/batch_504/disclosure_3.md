## Adaptive Event Granularity & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of event data generated *before* compilation, based on predicted system load and resource availability. Instead of a fixed granularity, we’ll introduce a ‘detail level’ parameter. This parameter is not static, but is *predicted* based on historical data and real-time system metrics.  This directly addresses potential bottlenecks in event compilation and transmission, reducing overhead when resources are constrained and increasing detail when available.

**Specs:**

*   **Detail Level Parameter (DLP):** An integer value ranging from 1 (coarse-grained, minimal data) to 10 (fine-grained, maximum data). 
*   **Prediction Engine:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) trained on:
    *   CPU/Memory Utilization of worker systems.
    *   Event Queue Length.
    *   Network Bandwidth Usage.
    *   Incoming Request Rate.
*   **DLP Adjustment Logic:**  Based on Prediction Engine output:
    *   If predicted load > 80% utilization: DLP = 1-3.
    *   If predicted load 50-80% utilization: DLP = 4-6.
    *   If predicted load < 50% utilization: DLP = 7-10.
*   **Event Capture Layer Modification:** Modify the event applier service to *before* generating event data, to sample or aggregate state change information based on the current DLP.
    *   DLP = 1: Capture only the operation type and container ID.
    *   DLP = 10: Capture full state change data, including all relevant fields and timestamps.  Intermediate values will proportionally adjust the level of detail.
*   **Metadata Inclusion:** Include the DLP value *within* each event data record. This allows downstream systems to understand the level of detail provided and adjust accordingly.
*   **Worker System Adaptation:** Worker systems will need to be modified to handle variable event data sizes efficiently. Potentially utilize a buffering mechanism to aggregate events before processing.
*   **Transaction Journal Impact:** The Transaction Journal itself remains unchanged. We are impacting the *capture* and *compilation* phase.

**Pseudocode (Event Capture Layer):**

```
function captureStateChange(stateChangeInfo):
  currentDLP = getPredictedDLP()

  if currentDLP <= 3:
    eventData = {
      "containerId": stateChangeInfo.containerId,
      "operationType": stateChangeInfo.operationType
    }
  elif currentDLP >= 7:
    eventData = {
      "containerId": stateChangeInfo.containerId,
      "operationType": stateChangeInfo.operationType,
      "timestamp": stateChangeInfo.timestamp,
      "fullStateChangeData": stateChangeInfo.fullStateChangeData
    }
  else:
    // Intermediate logic for proportional data capture
    // Example: Capture a subset of fields from fullStateChangeData

  eventData["detailLevel"] = currentDLP
  return eventData
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced overhead during peak load.
*   Improved system responsiveness.
*   Optimized resource utilization.
*   Ability to dynamically adjust data granularity based on changing conditions.
*   Scalability improvements.
