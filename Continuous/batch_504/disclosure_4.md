**Dynamic Resource Weaving with Predictive Prefetching**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Resource Weaver (PRW) - A software module integrated within the existing performance monitoring system.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time performance data from client computing components and performance measurement components (as per existing patent).
    *   User behavioral data (anonymized): Clickstreams, dwell time, scroll depth, device type, location (coarse-grained).
    *   Resource dependency graphs: A dynamic map of relationships between original resources and embedded resources (images, videos, scripts, etc.).  Managed and updated automatically.
    *   Network Condition Data: RTT, packet loss, bandwidth availability – gathered via active probing *and* passive monitoring of network paths.
*   **Output:**  Dynamic resource redirection instructions, prefetch requests.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**  Compatible with existing client and server infrastructure.  Benefit from dedicated edge computing resources for prefetching.
*   **Software Requirements:**  Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for predictive modeling), Message Queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for inter-component communication.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Dependency Mapping:**  Upon initial resource request, the system automatically constructs a dependency graph representing all embedded resources.  This is cached and updated as the user interacts with the resource.
2.  **Behavioral Prediction:** The PRW module employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on anonymized user behavioral data.  This model predicts the *probability* of a user accessing specific embedded resources *before* they explicitly request them.  Input features include:
    *   Current resource being viewed.
    *   User's historical access patterns.
    *   Time of day, day of week.
    *   Device type.
3.  **Network State Analysis:** Concurrently, the system monitors network conditions along potential paths to service providers.  This includes RTT, packet loss, and bandwidth availability.
4.  **Dynamic Weaving:**  Based on the behavioral prediction *and* network state analysis, the system dynamically "weaves" together the resource request. This involves:
    *   Identifying optimal service providers for *predicted* embedded resources.
    *   Redirecting requests for these resources to the selected providers *before* the user explicitly requests them. This is achieved using HTTP redirects or DNS-based redirection.
    *   Prioritizing resource delivery based on predicted access probability.
5.  **Adaptive Prefetching:**  Based on the confidence level of the behavioral prediction, the system initiates prefetching requests for high-probability embedded resources. Prefetched resources are stored in the client's browser cache or a local edge cache.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** The system continuously monitors the user's actual resource access patterns and uses this data to refine the behavioral prediction model and optimize resource weaving.

**Pseudocode (Resource Weaving Logic):**

```python
def weave_resource(user_id, resource_id):
    dependency_graph = get_dependency_graph(resource_id)
    predicted_access = predict_resource_access(user_id, dependency_graph)
    network_conditions = get_network_conditions(predicted_access.keys())
    optimized_providers = select_providers(predicted_access, network_conditions)

    for resource, provider in optimized_providers.items():
        redirect_url = generate_redirect_url(resource, provider)
        prefetch_resource(redirect_url) #Initiate prefetch if confidence > threshold
        send_redirect_instruction(resource, redirect_url)
```

**Novelty:**

The system goes beyond simply selecting optimal service providers for *current* requests. It proactively predicts future resource access, pre-fetches resources, and dynamically re-routes traffic to optimize the user experience *before* requests are even made. The combination of behavioral prediction, network condition analysis, and dynamic resource weaving creates a highly responsive and efficient content delivery system. The feedback loop ensures continuous optimization and adaptation to user behavior. This differs from the cited patent by implementing a *predictive* rather than *reactive* system.
