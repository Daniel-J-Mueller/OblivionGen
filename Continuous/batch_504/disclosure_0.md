## Adaptive Vector Clock Dimensionality for Heterogeneous Execution

**Concept:** Extend the vector clock concept to dynamically adjust the dimensionality of each node's clock based on the heterogeneity of connected execution engines. Currently, the patent specifies 'n' values in the vector clock being greater than the number of execution engines ('m'). This design proposes a system where 'n' isn't a fixed global value, but a *local* value determined by the diversity of synchronization requirements *between* connected engines.

**Specification:**

1.  **Execution Engine Profiling:** Prior to graph execution, each execution engine (Activation, Processing Element Array, Pooling Engine, and potential future additions) is profiled for its synchronization primitives. This yields a 'Synchronization Profile' for each engine, detailing the types of synchronization supported (e.g., barrier, semaphore, message passing) and associated latency characteristics.

2.  **Edge Synchronization Demand:** Each edge connecting nodes is assessed for the *synchronization demand* it places on the connected engines. This is not simply the 'edge type' (barrier, semaphore, etc.), but a nuanced calculation factoring in data dependencies, potential for stalling, and the performance characteristics of the involved engines. A 'Synchronization Demand Vector' (SDV) is generated for each edge.

3.  **Adaptive Dimensionality Calculation:** For each node, its vector clock dimensionality ('n') is calculated as follows:

    *   Initialize 'n' to a base value (e.g., equal to 'm').
    *   For each incoming edge:
        *   Retrieve the SDV for that edge.
        *   The length of the SDV contributes to 'n'. Specifically, `n = max(n, length(SDV))`.
        *   The SDV is then incorporated into the vector clock's update rule (see step 5).

4.  **Vector Clock Structure:** Each node’s vector clock is structured as a vector of 'n' values. The initial 'm' values represent the standard clock ticks associated with each engine type. The remaining values (if any) represent the synchronization states derived from the SDVs of incoming edges. These values are *not* simple clock ticks, but representations of synchronization status – flags, counters, or even small data structures describing the synchronization context.

5.  **Vector Clock Update Rule:** When a node receives data from a preceding node, the vector clock is updated as follows:

    *   For the standard 'm' values: Increment the corresponding clock ticks.
    *   For the additional values derived from SDVs:
        *   Access the SDV associated with the incoming edge.
        *   Update the corresponding vector clock values based on the synchronization information in the SDV. For example, if the SDV indicates a semaphore release, increment a counter in the vector clock. If the SDV indicates a barrier synchronization, set a flag.

6.  **Event Register Assignment:** Event registers are assigned to edges *and* to the additional vector clock values associated with synchronization states. This allows for fine-grained monitoring of synchronization activity and detection of potential race conditions.

**Pseudocode (Vector Clock Update):**

```
function updateVectorClock(currentNode, precedingNode, edge, executionEngineProfile):
  // Get current vector clock for currentNode
  currentClock = currentNode.vectorClock

  // Standard clock update
  for i in range(m):
    currentClock[i] = currentClock[i] + 1

  // SDV-based update
  sdv = getSynchronizationDemandVector(edge, executionEngineProfile)
  for i in range(length(sdv)):
    currentClock[m+i] = updateSynchronizationState(currentClock[m+i], sdv[i])

  return currentClock
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Concurrency:** Allows for more nuanced modeling of concurrency, especially in heterogeneous execution environments.
*   **Reduced Stalling:** By explicitly tracking synchronization states, the system can proactively identify and mitigate potential stalls.
*   **Improved Debugging:** Fine-grained event registers provide valuable insights into synchronization behavior.
*   **Adaptability:** The system can adapt to changes in the execution graph or the addition of new execution engines.
