## Automated Inventory Adjustment via Dynamic Weight Mapping

**Concept:** Augment the shopping cart system with integrated scales and a real-time inventory adjustment system. This allows for automatic detection of incorrectly scanned or missed items, and proactively updates both the virtual cart and the facility inventory.

**Specifications:**

*   **Integrated Scale System:** Each shopping cart is fitted with multiple load cells – one under each wheel, and potentially a central platform load cell. These cells provide high-resolution weight data in real-time.
*   **Pre-Scan Baseline:** Before the user begins shopping, the cart’s scale system establishes a baseline weight (empty cart + user's typical carry items if detectable through historical data).
*   **Item Weight Database:** A comprehensive database linking each SKU to its average weight (and weight variance) is maintained centrally.
*   **Dynamic Weight Mapping:** As items are scanned, the system predicts the expected weight change. This prediction is constantly compared to the actual weight change detected by the load cells.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** A discrepancy between predicted and actual weight triggers an anomaly flag. This could indicate:
    *   **Missed Scan:** Item was physically added to the cart but not scanned.
    *   **Incorrect Scan:** Wrong item was scanned (e.g., scanning a can of soup instead of a bag of chips).
    *   **Item Manipulation:** Item was removed or altered (e.g., opening a package).
*   **Resolution Algorithm:**
    1.  **Visual Confirmation Request:** If an anomaly is detected, the cart’s camera system captures an image of the area where the weight discrepancy originates.
    2.  **User Prompt:** A message is displayed on the cart’s screen requesting the user to confirm the presence/absence of specific items.
    3.  **AI Object Recognition:** Simultaneously, the AI analyzes the image to identify potential items present in the cart and correlate them with scanned items.
    4.  **Inventory Adjustment:** Based on user confirmation and/or AI analysis, the system automatically adds/removes items from the virtual cart and updates facility inventory levels.
*   **Location Awareness:** Integrate with existing facility location systems to identify the section of the store where the weight anomaly occurred. This can help narrow down potential incorrect items.
*   **Scalability:** The system must handle a large number of shopping carts concurrently without impacting performance.
*   **Data Logging:** All weight data, scan data, images, and resolution actions are logged for analysis and system improvement.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Resolution):**

FUNCTION ResolveAnomaly(weightDiscrepancy, scannedItem, image):
  IF weightDiscrepancy > threshold:
    Display image on cart screen
    Prompt user: "Is [scannedItem] present in the cart? (Yes/No)"
    userInput = GetUserInput()

    IF userInput == "No":
      Remove scannedItem from virtual cart
      Adjust facility inventory
      Display confirmation message
    ELSE:
      Analyze image using AI object recognition
      identifiedItems = AI.IdentifyItems(image)

      IF identifiedItems does NOT include scannedItem:
          Prompt user to confirm the item present instead.
          IF confirmed:
              Find closest item to scannedItem in image.
              Replace scannedItem with the correct item.
              Adjust virtual cart.
              Adjust facility inventory.
          ELSE:
              Log anomaly for manual review.
      ENDIF
  ENDIF
