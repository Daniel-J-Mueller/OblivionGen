## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** Dynamically layering and composing synthesized acoustic scenes based on real-time analysis of microphone input, creating highly immersive and contextually relevant audio environments. This builds on the patent’s focus on echo/latency but shifts from *removing* unwanted echoes to *generating* desired acoustic spaces.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-channel microphone array (minimum 4 channels), reference audio data stream.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance DSP or equivalent, capable of real-time audio processing.
*   **Acoustic Scene Library:** Database containing pre-recorded or synthesized impulse responses (IRs) representing diverse acoustic environments (e.g., concert hall, forest, street cafe, spaceship bridge).  Each IR should be tagged with metadata describing the scene’s characteristics (size, reverberation time, dominant frequencies).  The IRs are not directly played, but used as foundational data for procedural generation.
*   **Scene Analysis Module:**
    *   **Dominant Source Localization:** Identifies the primary sound source(s) using beamforming and time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) techniques.
    *   **Acoustic Feature Extraction:**  Analyzes microphone input to extract features such as spectral centroid, bandwidth, roughness, and harmonicity.
    *   **Environmental Classification:**  Uses machine learning (e.g., convolutional neural network) to classify the current acoustic environment based on extracted features. This classification isn't about *identifying* an existing space, but *characterizing* the sonic fingerprint of the present situation.
*   **Procedural Scene Generation Engine:**
    *   **IR Blending:** Combines multiple IRs from the Acoustic Scene Library based on the Environmental Classification results and user preferences (e.g., "add a hint of forest ambience").
    *   **Spatialization:** Positions synthesized sound sources within the virtual acoustic space, using head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create a 3D soundscape.
    *   **Dynamic Reverberation:** Modifies the reverberation characteristics (size, decay time, diffusion) of the virtual space based on the dominant sound source’s location and characteristics.
*   **Latency Compensation:** Critically important.  The system *must* account for processing latency to ensure seamless integration of synthesized and real-world audio. The patent's latency estimation techniques are used as a foundational block.
*   **Output:** Multi-channel audio stream, mixed with the original microphone input, creating an augmented acoustic environment.

**Pseudocode (Scene Generation Engine):**

```
function generate_scene(microphone_input, environmental_classification, user_preferences):
  // Load base IRs based on classification and preferences
  base_IRs = load_IRs(environmental_classification, user_preferences)

  // Blend IRs to create a composite IR
  composite_IR = blend_IRs(base_IRs)

  // Apply dynamic reverberation based on source characteristics
  reverberation_settings = calculate_reverberation(microphone_input)
  dynamic_IR = apply_reverberation(composite_IR, reverberation_settings)

  // Spatialize synthesized sounds
  synthesized_sounds = generate_synthesized_sounds()
  spatialized_sounds = spatialize(synthesized_sounds, microphone_input)

  // Mix synthesized and real audio
  mixed_audio = mix(microphone_input, spatialized_sounds)

  return mixed_audio
```

**Refinement Points:**

*   Explore generative models (e.g., GANs) to create entirely new, never-before-heard IRs based on user-defined parameters.
*   Implement a "sonic paintbrush" interface, allowing users to directly manipulate the characteristics of the virtual acoustic space in real-time.
*   Integrate with head-tracking technology to provide a truly immersive and personalized audio experience.
*   Develop an algorithm to automatically estimate the perceptual distance between the real and virtual acoustic spaces, and dynamically adjust the mixing levels to maintain a sense of realism.
