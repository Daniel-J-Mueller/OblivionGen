## Adaptive Key Rotation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand key issuance to incorporate real-time behavioral biometric analysis of the video source device's transmission patterns. This allows for *proactive* key rotation based on detected anomalies, rather than solely relying on scheduled or user-initiated restarts. 

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Profile Creation:**
    *   Upon initial connection, establish a baseline behavioral profile for the video source device. This profile will encompass:
        *   Packet Inter-Arrival Times (IAT): Distribution of time between received packets.
        *   Packet Size Variation: Standard deviation and range of packet sizes.
        *   Transmission Rate: Average and peak data rates.
        *   Source Encoding Characteristics: Analyze header information to identify consistent encoding parameters.
    *   Store this profile securely within the video processing service.

2.  **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Continuously monitor incoming data from the video encoding device.
    *   Calculate rolling statistics (e.g., moving average, standard deviation) for IAT, packet size, and transmission rate.
    *   Compare rolling statistics to the baseline behavioral profile using statistical anomaly detection techniques (e.g., Z-score, Isolation Forest).
    *   Define sensitivity thresholds for anomaly detection.

3.  **Adaptive Key Rotation Trigger:**
    *   If anomaly detection exceeds the defined threshold, trigger an immediate key rotation.
    *   The video processing service initiates a new key exchange with the video encoding device.
    *   Simultaneously, the video processing service signals the video transport service to begin decrypting using the new key.

4.  **Key Rotation Protocol:**
    *   Employ a lightweight, bi-directional protocol (e.g., MQTT) to exchange keys.
    *   The protocol must support:
        *   Secure key delivery (encryption).
        *   Acknowledgement mechanism for reliable key exchange.
        *   Version control for protocol compatibility.

5.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Implement a feedback loop to dynamically adjust anomaly detection thresholds.
    *   If false positives are frequent, lower the threshold.
    *   If anomalies go undetected, increase the threshold.
    *   Utilize a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Bayesian optimization) to optimize the threshold values over time.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detect_anomaly(packet_data, baseline_profile):
    rolling_iat = calculate_rolling_average(packet_data.iat)
    rolling_packet_size = calculate_rolling_std_dev(packet_data.packet_size)

    z_score_iat = (rolling_iat - baseline_profile.iat_mean) / baseline_profile.iat_std_dev
    z_score_packet_size = (rolling_packet_size - baseline_profile.packet_size_mean) / baseline_profile.packet_size_std_dev

    if abs(z_score_iat) > anomaly_threshold or abs(z_score_packet_size) > anomaly_threshold:
        return True  # Anomaly detected
    else:
        return False # No anomaly detected
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Video Processing Service: Servers with sufficient processing power for real-time data analysis and key exchange.
*   Key Management Service: Secure storage for cryptographic keys.
*   Video Encoding Device: Compatible with the lightweight key exchange protocol.
*   Network Infrastructure: Low-latency connection between devices.
*   Machine Learning Library: For dynamic threshold adjustment (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
