## Dynamic DNS Reputation Scoring & Shunting

**Concept:** Expand the filtering capabilities beyond simple thresholding of query *volume* to incorporate real-time reputation scoring of requesting entities, and dynamically shunt queries to different resolution paths based on that score. This moves beyond DDoS mitigation and into proactive threat blocking.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Data Sources:**

*   **Real-time Blacklist/Greylist Feeds:** Integrate with commercial and open-source threat intelligence feeds (abuseIPDB, VirusTotal, etc.).
*   **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor DNS query patterns (query types, frequency, entropy, geographic distribution) to establish baseline behavior for each requesting IP/ASN.  Deviation from baseline indicates potential malicious activity.
*   **Historical Data:** Maintain a rolling window of historical DNS resolution data (successful resolutions, timeouts, NXDOMAIN responses) for each requester.
*   **Honeypot/Sinkhole Integration:** Queries directed towards known malicious domains (identified through honeypots or sinkholes) contribute negatively to reputation.

**2. Scoring Algorithm:**

*   **Weighted Scoring:** Assign weights to each data source based on reliability and accuracy. For example, a confirmed malicious IP from a reputable blacklist carries a higher negative weight than a minor deviation from baseline behavior.
*   **Decay Mechanism:** Implement a time-based decay mechanism to reduce the impact of historical data. This allows legitimate entities to recover from temporary misclassifications.
*   **Reputation Bands:** Define reputation bands (e.g., Excellent, Good, Neutral, Poor, Malicious) based on the calculated score.

**3. Dynamic Shunting Logic:**

*   **Resolution Paths:**
    *   **Default Path:** Standard DNS resolution via authoritative servers.
    *   **Cached Path:** Serve responses from a local, highly-available cache (for Excellent/Good reputation).
    *   **Challenge Path:** Present a challenge (e.g., CAPTCHA, JavaScript challenge) before resolving (for Neutral/Poor reputation).
    *   **Block Path:** Drop the query entirely (for Malicious reputation).
*   **Routing Table:** Maintain a routing table that maps reputation bands to resolution paths.
*   **Policy Engine:** Allow administrators to customize the routing table and scoring weights based on specific security requirements.

**4. Implementation Details:**

*   **Component: Reputation Engine:** Responsible for collecting and processing reputation data, calculating scores, and updating the routing table.  Scalable architecture is critical. (e.g. Kafka/Redis backed).
*   **Component: DNS Interceptor:**  Intercepts incoming DNS queries before they reach the authoritative servers.  Consults the Reputation Engine to determine the appropriate resolution path.  (e.g. DPDK for high throughput)
*   **API:** Expose an API for administrators to manage reputation data, configure scoring weights, and monitor system performance.
*   **Telemetry:**  Collect detailed telemetry data (query volume, reputation scores, resolution paths) for security analysis and performance optimization.

**Pseudocode (DNS Interceptor):**

```
function interceptDNSQuery(query):
  requesterIP = query.sourceIP

  reputationScore = ReputationEngine.getReputationScore(requesterIP)

  if reputationScore > EXCELLENT_THRESHOLD:
    resolutionPath = CACHED_PATH
  elif reputationScore > GOOD_THRESHOLD:
    resolutionPath = DEFAULT_PATH
  elif reputationScore > NEUTRAL_THRESHOLD:
    resolutionPath = CHALLENGE_PATH
  else:
    resolutionPath = BLOCK_PATH

  if resolutionPath == CHALLENGE_PATH:
    presentChallenge(query) // Return challenge to client
    if challengeSuccessful():
        resolutionPath = DEFAULT_PATH
    else:
        return // Drop query

  if resolutionPath == CACHED_PATH:
    response = Cache.getResponse(query)
    if response != null:
      return response

  response = resolveQuery(query, resolutionPath)
  return response
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Distributed Reputation Engine: Scale horizontally using a distributed caching system (e.g., Redis Cluster).
*   Load Balancing: Distribute DNS queries across multiple DNS Interceptors.
*   Asynchronous Processing: Handle challenge processing and other time-consuming tasks asynchronously.
