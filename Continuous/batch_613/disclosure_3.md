## Dynamic Fragment Personalization via Client-Side AI

**Concept:** Leverage client-side AI models to dynamically alter advertising fragments *after* they've been downloaded, tailoring them to the individual viewer's inferred preferences *without* requiring re-encoding or server-side modification. This builds on the manifest-driven fragment delivery described in the patent, but adds a personalization layer.

**Specs:**

1.  **Fragment Tagging:**  Each advertising fragment in the manifest will have associated metadata tags indicating available personalization 'slots' â€“ regions within the fragment amenable to AI-driven modification.  These tags will specify the type of modification possible (e.g., text overlay, object replacement, color adjustment, scene filtering).

2.  **Client-Side AI Model:**  The client device (smart TV, mobile) will host a lightweight, pre-trained AI model (e.g., a Generative Adversarial Network or Diffusion Model) optimized for visual content modification.  This model will be periodically updated over-the-air.

3.  **Preference Inference:** The client device will infer user preferences through a combination of:
    *   Explicit feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down on ads).
    *   Implicit data (viewing history, demographics, time of day, location, app usage).
    *   Real-time contextual data (e.g., weather, news events).

4.  **Dynamic Modification Pipeline:** When an advertising fragment is downloaded, the following steps will occur:
    *   The client device analyzes the fragment's metadata tags to identify available personalization slots.
    *   Based on inferred user preferences, the client selects appropriate modifications.
    *   The client-side AI model applies the chosen modifications to the fragment.
    *   The modified fragment is displayed.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function onFragmentDownload(fragment, metadata) {
  personalizationSlots = metadata.personalizationSlots
  userPreferences = getUserPreferences()

  for (slot in personalizationSlots) {
    modificationType = slot.modificationType
    availableOptions = slot.availableOptions

    chosenOption = selectBestOption(availableOptions, userPreferences)

    modifiedFragment = applyModification(fragment, chosenOption)

    fragment = modifiedFragment
  }

  displayFragment(fragment)
}

function selectBestOption(options, preferences) {
  // Implement logic to rank options based on user preferences
  // This could involve a scoring system or machine learning model
  // Return the highest-ranked option
}

function applyModification(fragment, option) {
  // Use client-side AI model to apply the chosen modification to the fragment
  // This could involve image manipulation, text overlay, or object replacement
  // Return the modified fragment
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `fragmentMetadata`:  Object containing metadata for each fragment, including `personalizationSlots` (array of personalization slot objects).
*   `personalizationSlot`: Object containing `modificationType` (e.g., "text overlay", "object replacement") and `availableOptions` (array of modification options).
*   `userPreferences`: Object storing inferred user preferences (e.g., "preferred brands", "interests", "demographics").

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Highly personalized advertising experiences.
*   Reduced server-side processing load.
*   Increased ad engagement and conversion rates.
*   Improved user satisfaction.
