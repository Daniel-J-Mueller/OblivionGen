## Secure Data Sharding with Dynamic Key Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the authenticated storage operations to encompass data sharding, where data is broken into fragments and distributed across multiple storage devices. Introduce a dynamic key orchestration layer that governs access to these fragments, based not only on user identity but also on *data sensitivity* and *access context*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sharding Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for splitting data into fragments.
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) to divide data into ‘n’ fragments. Require ‘k’ fragments to reconstruct the original data. 'n' and 'k' are configurable per-data-object, not global.
*   **Metadata:**  Each fragment is associated with metadata indicating:
    *   Data object ID.
    *   Fragment index (1 to n).
    *   Sensitivity Level (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted).
    *   Access Policies (defined using attribute-based access control - ABAC).
*   **Storage Distribution:**  Fragments are distributed across available storage devices using a configurable distribution strategy (e.g., round-robin, consistent hashing based on data object ID).

**2. Dynamic Key Orchestration (DKO) Service:**

*   **Function:** Manages cryptographic keys used to encrypt/decrypt data fragments and enforces access control policies.
*   **Key Derivation:**  DKO derives unique encryption keys for each fragment based on:
    *   Data object ID.
    *   Fragment index.
    *   User identity (claims-based authentication).
    *   Access context (e.g., time of day, location, device type).
    *   Data Sensitivity Level.
*   **Key Lifecycle:** Keys are ephemeral and generated on-demand. Rotate frequently. Utilize a Key Management Service (KMS) for secure storage and rotation of root keys.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Before granting access to a fragment, DKO evaluates access policies. Policies are defined using ABAC, allowing fine-grained control based on user attributes, data attributes, and environmental factors.

**3. Authenticated Storage Protocol Extension:**

*   Extend the existing authenticated storage protocol to support fragment-level access control.
*   Client requests must specify the fragment ID they are requesting.
*   The storage device communicates with the DKO service to obtain the necessary encryption key and verify access policies *before* serving the fragment.
*   Include a digitally signed 'access token' within the protocol to prove authorization.

**Pseudocode (DKO Service - Key Retrieval):**

```
function getEncryptionKey(dataObjectId, fragmentIndex, userAttributes, accessContext, sensitivityLevel):
    // 1. Construct a key derivation input based on all parameters
    keyInput = dataObjectId + fragmentIndex + userAttributes + accessContext + sensitivityLevel

    // 2. Retrieve root key from KMS
    rootKey = KMS.getRootKey()

    // 3. Derive fragment-specific key using a Key Derivation Function (KDF)
    fragmentKey = KDF(rootKey, keyInput)

    // 4. Evaluate Access Policies based on user attributes, data attributes, and access context
    if (AccessPolicyEngine.evaluate(fragmentKey, userAttributes, sensitivityLevel, accessContext)):
        return fragmentKey
    else:
        return null // Access Denied
```

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   Use a high-performance KDF (e.g., HKDF) to minimize key derivation latency.
*   Implement a robust access control engine that supports complex ABAC policies.
*   Design the system to scale horizontally to handle a large number of storage devices and data objects.
*   Consider using a distributed ledger (e.g., blockchain) to audit access events and ensure data integrity.
