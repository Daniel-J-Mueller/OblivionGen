## Personalized Auditory Scene Reconstruction with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Data

**Concept:** Expand beamforming capabilities beyond simple noise cancellation and voice isolation by reconstructing a localized auditory scene tailored to the user’s head movements and environment. Leverage an IMU within the in-ear device to spatially map sound sources and dynamically adjust beamforming parameters, creating a more immersive and realistic listening experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   In-ear device incorporating:
        *   Three microphones (as per the provided patent).
        *   9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer.
        *   Low-power processing unit (DSP or similar) capable of real-time signal processing.
        *   Bluetooth communication module for data transfer and control.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **IMU Data Acquisition & Processing:** Continuously acquire raw data from the IMU.  Apply sensor fusion algorithms (e.g., Kalman filter) to estimate head orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) and acceleration with high accuracy and minimal latency.
    2.  **Spatial Sound Source Mapping:**
        *   Utilize Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimation using the three microphones to determine the relative direction of sound sources.
        *   Combine TDOA data with IMU-derived head orientation to calculate the absolute spatial position of each sound source relative to the user.
        *   Implement a sound source tracking algorithm (e.g., Particle Filter) to maintain accurate tracking of moving sound sources over time.
    3.  **Dynamic Beamforming Adaptation:**
        *   Based on the spatial map of sound sources, dynamically adjust the beamforming weights of each microphone array element to maximize signal capture from desired sources and minimize interference from unwanted noise or competing sounds.
        *   Implement a “virtual soundstage” feature, allowing the user to adjust the perceived width and depth of the auditory scene.
        *   Adaptive filtering which is aware of head movements.
    4.  **Environmental Awareness & Acoustic Scene Classification:**
        *   Implement machine learning algorithms to classify the current acoustic environment (e.g., office, street, concert hall).
        *   Adjust beamforming parameters based on the identified acoustic scene to optimize performance in different environments.
        *   Implement active noise cancellation which is specific to the sound environment.
    5.  **User Interface & Customization:**
        *   Companion mobile app allowing users to customize beamforming settings, adjust the virtual soundstage, and select preferred acoustic profiles.
        *   Real-time visualization of the spatial sound map within the app.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Beamforming Adaptation):**

```
// Initialize:
soundSourceMap = empty array
beamformingWeights = initial weights

// Main Loop:
while (true) {
    // 1. Acquire IMU data and estimate head orientation
    headOrientation = getHeadOrientation()

    // 2. Acquire audio data from microphones
    audioData = getAudioData()

    // 3. Perform TDOA estimation to identify sound sources
    soundSources = estimateSoundSources(audioData)

    // 4. Update sound source map with current data
    soundSourceMap = updateSoundSourceMap(soundSourceMap, soundSources, headOrientation)

    // 5. Calculate optimal beamforming weights based on sound source map
    beamformingWeights = calculateBeamformingWeights(soundSourceMap, headOrientation)

    // 6. Apply beamforming weights to audio data
    processedAudio = applyBeamforming(audioData, beamformingWeights)

    // 7. Output processed audio
    outputAudio(processedAudio)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced speech communication in noisy environments.
*   Immersive audio experiences for gaming and virtual reality.
*   Personalized hearing assistance for individuals with hearing loss.
*   Directional audio recording for mobile devices.
