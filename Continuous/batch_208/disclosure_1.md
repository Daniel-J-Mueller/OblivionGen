## Adaptive Pre-Session Environment Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the pre-session initialization to include active environmental data capture and analysis, creating a dynamic 'digital twin' of the recipient's immediate surroundings. This data isn't just for video feed enhancement, but for anticipatory bandwidth allocation, intelligent noise cancellation, and even automated scene adjustments (lighting, virtual backgrounds) *before* the communication officially begins.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Fusion Module:**
    *   Input: Camera feed (recipient device), microphone array (recipient device), optional: ambient light sensor, depth sensor (if available).
    *   Processing: Real-time analysis of visual data (object detection, scene classification), audio analysis (noise profiling, sound source localization).
    *   Output:  "Environment Profile" – a structured data package representing the recipient’s environment. This package includes:
        *   Scene Type (e.g., "office", "home", "outdoor")
        *   Object List (e.g., "desk", "chair", "window", "person")
        *   Noise Profile (frequency spectrum, dominant noise sources)
        *   Lighting Conditions (average lux, color temperature)
        *   Depth Map (if depth sensor is present)

*   **Predictive Bandwidth Allocation:**
    *   Input: Environment Profile, communication history (sender-recipient), sender's network conditions.
    *   Processing: Based on the Environment Profile (e.g., complex scene = higher bandwidth needed), communication history (previous video resolution, frame rate), and sender's network conditions, predict the optimal bandwidth required for a high-quality communication session.
    *   Output: Bandwidth Request – a signal sent to network infrastructure to reserve sufficient bandwidth *before* the session starts.

*   **Intelligent Noise Cancellation Profile:**
    *   Input: Noise Profile.
    *   Processing: Generate a customized noise cancellation profile tailored to the recipient’s environment. This profile specifies the frequencies and patterns to suppress during the communication session.
    *   Output: Noise Cancellation Profile – sent to the sender's audio processing pipeline.

*   **Automated Scene Adjustment (Recipient Device):**
    *   Input: Environment Profile, Lighting Conditions.
    *   Processing:
        *   If Lighting Conditions are poor: automatically increase camera gain or activate a virtual light source.
        *   If a cluttered background is detected: suggest or automatically apply a virtual background.
        *   If a dominant color is detected: adjust camera white balance to improve color accuracy.
    *   Output: Camera Control Signals – sent to the recipient device’s camera hardware.

*   **Communication Protocol Integration:**
    *   Extend SIP protocol to include the Environment Profile as a parameter.
    *   Sender device receives Environment Profile before the session starts.
    *   Sender device adjusts its audio and video processing pipelines accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Recipient Device):**

```
// Upon receiving initialization command from sender
captureEnvironmentData()
analyzeEnvironmentData()
createEnvironmentProfile()
sendEnvironmentProfileToSender()

adjustCameraSettingsBasedOnEnvironmentProfile()
applyNoiseCancellationProfile()

// Ongoing: Monitor environment during session and adapt settings dynamically.
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced initialization latency.
*   Improved communication quality (audio and video).
*   Enhanced user experience.
*   Proactive adaptation to changing environmental conditions.
*   Potential for advanced features like augmented reality integration.
