## Dynamic Content-Aware Watermarking with Per-GOP Variation

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive encoding concept to include dynamic, imperceptible watermarking tailored *not just* to the content type, but to specific *events* within the content, and vary the watermark strength per GOP based on event prominence.

**Specification:**

**I. System Components:**

*   **Event Detector:** An AI module analyzing the video stream in real-time.  Capable of identifying key events (e.g., dialogue, action sequences, product placement, scene changes, character introductions). Outputs event type and prominence score (0.0 - 1.0).
*   **Watermark Generator:**  Generates imperceptible watermarks.  Supports multiple watermark types (e.g., logo, text, tracking codes, unique identifiers).  Watermark type selection is configurable per content stream.
*   **GOP Analyzer:** Analyzes each GOP for content characteristics *and* event relevance. Extracts data like motion vectors, color histograms, and audio features. Determines how strongly the current GOP relates to detected events.
*   **Adaptive Watermark Embedder:**  Embeds the generated watermark into each GOP, dynamically adjusting watermark strength based on the GOP Analyzer’s output. Strength is expressed as a scaling factor (0.0 - 1.0) applied to the watermark's amplitude.
*   **Manifest Data Extender:**  Extends the existing manifest data format to include per-GOP watermark metadata:  GOP start time, watermark type, and watermark strength.
*   **Watermark Extractor:** Extracts the watermark from GOPs, using the manifest data to calibrate the extraction process.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Analysis Phase:** The Event Detector continuously analyzes the video stream.  Detected events and their prominence scores are recorded.
2.  **GOP Processing:** For each GOP:
    *   The GOP Analyzer assesses the GOP’s content characteristics and event relevance.
    *   A watermark strength factor is calculated. The base strength is determined by the overall content characteristics, but is *modulated* by the event prominence score.  High-prominence events yield higher strength factors.
    *   The Adaptive Watermark Embedder embeds the watermark into the GOP using the calculated strength factor.
3.  **Manifest Generation:** The Manifest Data Extender adds per-GOP watermark metadata to the manifest file.
4.  **Encoding:**  The encoded video stream and manifest file are delivered to the viewer.

**III. Pseudocode (Watermark Strength Calculation):**

```
function calculate_watermark_strength(gop_characteristics, event_prominence):
    base_strength = determine_base_strength(gop_characteristics) // Based on content type, noise level, etc.

    // Modulate based on event prominence
    strength_modifier = event_prominence * 0.5 //Scale it to fit the base strength.

    final_strength = base_strength + strength_modifier

    // Clamp values
    if final_strength > 1.0:
        final_strength = 1.0
    if final_strength < 0.0:
        final_strength = 0.0

    return final_strength
```

**IV. Technical Considerations:**

*   **Watermark Robustness:** Select a watermark algorithm robust to common video processing operations (compression, scaling, cropping).
*   **Perceptual Transparency:**  Ensure the watermark is imperceptible to the human eye, even at higher strength levels. Utilize perceptual masking techniques.
*   **Computational Complexity:**  Optimize the Event Detector and GOP Analyzer for real-time performance.
*   **Metadata Overhead:** Minimize the metadata overhead added to the manifest file.
*   **Security:** Consider encryption of the watermark and metadata to prevent unauthorized access.
