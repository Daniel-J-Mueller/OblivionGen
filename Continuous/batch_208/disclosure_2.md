## Dynamic Content Weaving with Predictive Device States

**Concept:** Extend the multi-device content presentation beyond simple portioning and concurrent display. Introduce a system that *dynamically weaves* content segments across devices, not just based on device capability, but on *predicted* device state – usage patterns, proximity to user, environmental context – creating a fluid, personalized experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive State Engine (PSE):**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Device Transport Data (as per patent) – Capabilities, network connectivity.
    *   Device Usage History – Frequency of app use, content types consumed.
    *   Sensor Data – Location (GPS, Bluetooth beacons), ambient light, sound levels, user activity (accelerometer/gyroscope).
    *   User Profile – Preferences, habits, demographic information.
    *   Calendar Integration – Scheduled events, meetings.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Machine Learning Models – Train models to predict device states (e.g., ‘likely to be used for video playback in the next 5 minutes’, ‘user is likely commuting’, ‘device is likely idle’).
    *   State Prioritization – Assign confidence scores to predicted states.
*   **Output:**
    *   Real-time device state predictions with confidence levels.

**2. Content Weaving Manager (CWM):**

*   **Content Decomposition:**  Break down content into granular segments (visual, audio, interactive elements).  Format segments as independent, addressable streams.
*   **Weaving Logic:**
    *   Input: Content segments, Device State Predictions (from PSE).
    *   Process:  Dynamically map content segments to devices based on predicted state and segment dependencies.
        *   Example: User is predicted to be walking and listening to music. The audio stream is routed to headphones.  A simplified visual element (map, progress bar) is routed to a smartwatch.  Detailed video content is held back until the user is predicted to be stationary.
    *   Adaptive Streaming – Adjust stream quality and content complexity based on device capabilities and network conditions.
*   **Synchronization Module:** Ensures consistent playback and interaction across devices, even with varying latency.  Utilizes a distributed timestamping mechanism.
*   **Interruption Handling:** Gracefully handle device interruptions (e.g., network loss, battery depletion) by seamlessly switching content streams to other available devices.

**3. Communication Protocol Extensions:**

*   **State Advertisement:** Devices periodically broadcast their predicted states (from PSE) over the network.
*   **Weaving Request/Response:** CWM sends requests to devices specifying which content segments to play. Devices respond with confirmation and buffering status.
*   **Dynamic Stream Addressing:** A flexible addressing scheme that allows content streams to be dynamically re-routed between devices during playback.

**Pseudocode (CWM - Weaving Logic):**

```
function weaveContent(content, devices):
  for each segment in content:
    bestDevice = null
    highestConfidence = 0

    for each device in devices:
      confidence = predictDeviceState(device, segment)  //Uses PSE outputs
      if confidence > highestConfidence:
        highestConfidence = confidence
        bestDevice = device

    if bestDevice != null:
      sendStream(segment, bestDevice)
    else:
      //Handle case where no suitable device is found (e.g., buffer, retry)
      logError("No suitable device found for segment")

function predictDeviceState(device, segment):
  //Access PSE for device state prediction based on segment requirements (e.g., video, audio, interactivity)
  //Return confidence score (0-1)
  return PSE.predictState(device, segment)
```

**Novelty:**  While the original patent addresses multi-device content *presentation*, this concept focuses on *dynamic content weaving* driven by *predictive device states*.  It’s not simply about sending different parts of the content to different devices; it's about proactively adapting the content itself based on what the system *anticipates* the user will want and be able to experience, creating a far more seamless and personalized experience.
