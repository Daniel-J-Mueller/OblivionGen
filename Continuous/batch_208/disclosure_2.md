## Adaptive Auditory Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leveraging the noise compensation principles of the patent to *reconstruct* a more complete auditory scene, prioritizing environmental awareness beyond simple speech clarity. This isn’t about making things *quieter*; it’s about making them *more informative*.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-channel audio input (minimum 4 microphones).  Can accept signals from existing acoustic echo cancellation/noise suppression systems *or* raw microphone feeds.
*   **Processing Core:**  A spatial audio processing engine, heavily reliant on beamforming and sound source localization.
*   **Noise Profile Generation:**  Instead of simply *adding* noise to overcome thresholds, the system analyzes the *residual* noise floor *after* initial echo/noise suppression. This residual noise isn’t just removed – it’s categorized by frequency and spatial origin.
*   **Environmental Mapping:**  Build a dynamic “sound map” of the environment.  Identify dominant noise sources (HVAC, traffic, etc.) and their spatial location.
*   **Selective Noise Re-introduction:**  Re-introduce *filtered* and *spatially-aware* versions of the categorized noise.  This isn't about playing back the original noise. It's about *synthesizing* noise characteristics that indicate the presence and location of environmental features.
*   **Hearing Threshold Adaptation:**  Utilize personalized hearing profiles (frequency-dependent thresholds) to dynamically adjust the synthesized noise levels, ensuring that crucial environmental cues aren’t masked for users with hearing impairments. This extends beyond the simple thresholding mentioned in the patent to encompass a wider range of auditory sensitivities.
*   **Alert System Integration:** Integrate with existing alert systems (e.g., fire alarms, emergency vehicle sirens).  The system should *enhance* the perception of these critical sounds while still maintaining a realistic auditory scene.
*   **Output:** Multi-channel spatial audio output delivered through headphones or a speaker array.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: Multi-channel audio stream
audio_input = get_audio_input();

// Initial noise suppression & echo cancellation
processed_audio = perform_noise_suppression(audio_input);
processed_audio = perform_echo_cancellation(processed_audio);

// Analyze residual noise
residual_noise = calculate_residual_noise(processed_audio);
noise_frequencies = analyze_noise_frequencies(residual_noise);
noise_sources = localize_noise_sources(residual_noise); //Spatial analysis

//User Hearing Profile
user_profile = load_user_hearing_profile();

// Synthesize Environmental Noise
synthesized_noise = synthesize_environmental_noise(noise_frequencies, noise_sources, user_profile);

//Integrate emergency alerts (priority signal)
emergency_signal = detect_emergency_signal(audio_input);
if(emergency_signal){
    synthesized_noise = prioritize_emergency_signal(synthesized_noise, emergency_signal);
}

// Combine processed audio & synthesized noise
output_audio = combine_audio(processed_audio, synthesized_noise);

// Output audio
play_audio(output_audio);
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   **AI-driven Noise Modeling:**  Train a neural network to model the acoustic characteristics of different environments. This would allow the system to *predict* the expected noise profile and synthesize more realistic environmental cues.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:**  Combine auditory cues with haptic feedback (e.g., vibrations) to enhance spatial awareness for users with severe hearing impairments.
*   **AR/VR Integration:** Integrate the system with augmented or virtual reality displays to create immersive and spatially accurate auditory experiences.
