## Adaptive Fragment Prediction & Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the segmented caching approach by introducing a predictive model that anticipates future fragment requests *before* they are explicitly received, and prefetches those fragments to memory. This dramatically reduces latency for frequently accessed content, going beyond simply optimizing storage and retrieval.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Model – Fragment Request History:**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously log fragment requests, associating them with user/session IDs, timestamps, and content identifiers.
*   **Model Type:** Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to capture sequential dependencies in fragment requests.  Other time series models (ARIMA, Prophet) could be explored.
*   **Training:** Train the RNN on historical request data.  The model learns to predict the *next* fragment a user is likely to request, given their request history.  Separate models per content type or popularity tier could improve accuracy.
*   **Prediction Confidence:**  The model outputs a probability score indicating its confidence in the prediction.  A threshold is established to determine when to initiate prefetching.

**2. Prefetching Mechanism:**

*   **Prediction Trigger:** When the RNN predicts a fragment with a confidence score exceeding the threshold, a prefetch request is initiated.
*   **Memory Allocation:**  Allocate memory space in the cache for the predicted fragment(s).
*   **Asynchronous Retrieval:** Retrieve the predicted fragment(s) from the higher-latency storage medium *asynchronously*.  This avoids blocking the main request processing thread.
*   **Fragment Prioritization:** Implement a priority queue for prefetch requests.  Requests for fragments with higher predicted demand or lower retrieval latency are prioritized.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor the hit rate of prefetched fragments.  Adjust the prediction confidence threshold dynamically to optimize the trade-off between prefetching overhead and hit rate.

**3. Cache Management Integration:**

*   **Prefetch Queue:** Add a dedicated queue within the cache management system to track prefetched fragments.
*   **Hit/Miss Tracking:**  Accurately track hits and misses for both explicitly requested fragments and prefetched fragments.
*   **Eviction Policy Modification:**  Modify the cache eviction policy to consider the 'prefetch status' of fragments. Prefetched fragments with low usage should be evicted more aggressively.  Fragments that have been prefetched *and* used are given higher retention priority.

**4. System Components:**

*   **Request Interceptor:** A module that intercepts all fragment requests before they reach the cache server.
*   **Prediction Engine:**  A dedicated server hosting the trained RNN model.  Handles prediction requests from the Request Interceptor.
*   **Prefetch Manager:**  Manages the prefetch queue, initiates asynchronous retrieval requests, and updates the cache management system.
*   **Cache Server:** The existing cache server, modified to integrate with the Prefetch Manager and updated eviction policy.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Manager):**

```
function handle_request(fragment_id, user_id):
  prediction = PredictionEngine.predict_next_fragment(user_id)
  if prediction.confidence > threshold:
    prefetch_fragment(prediction.fragment_id)

function prefetch_fragment(fragment_id):
  allocate_memory(fragment_id)
  async_retrieve(fragment_id)
  add_to_prefetch_queue(fragment_id)

function async_retrieve(fragment_id):
  // Retrieve from higher-latency storage asynchronously
  // Update cache when retrieval is complete

function add_to_prefetch_queue(fragment_id):
  // Add fragment to the prefetch queue
  // Track prefetch status
```
