## Dynamic Policy Inheritance & Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the threat modeling system to incorporate dynamic policy inheritance based on component reputation and a constantly updating risk landscape. Instead of solely relying on pre-defined policies, the system adapts security requirements based on observed behavior and external threat intelligence.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate data feeds from:
    *   Vulnerability databases (NVD, Exploit-DB)
    *   Threat intelligence platforms (MISP, VirusTotal)
    *   Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) analysis (cyclonedx, spdx)
    *   Community-sourced security reports (bug bounty programs, security forums)
    *   Internal incident response data.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** Develop a weighted scoring algorithm to assess component reputation. Weights assigned based on data source reliability, vulnerability severity, exploitability, and observed runtime behavior.
*   **Runtime Monitoring:** Continuously monitor application component behavior (API calls, network traffic, resource access). Deviations from baseline behavior negatively impact reputation score.
*   **Reputation Decay:** Implement a decay mechanism for reputation scores. Scores diminish over time if no new positive or negative data is received.

**2. Dynamic Policy Inheritance:**

*   **Policy Templates:** Define a library of policy templates for common security requirements (authentication, authorization, data encryption, input validation).
*   **Inheritance Rules:** Establish rules for inheriting policies based on component reputation scores:
    *   **High Reputation:** Components with high scores receive minimal policy restrictions.
    *   **Medium Reputation:** Components receive standard policy restrictions.
    *   **Low Reputation:** Components receive stringent policy restrictions, potentially including isolation or blocking.
*   **Policy Orchestration:** Design a policy orchestration engine that dynamically applies and updates policies based on component reputation scores and threat landscape changes.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate contextual information (user roles, data sensitivity, network location) into policy decision-making.

**3. Graph Modification & Analysis:**

*   **Reputation Nodes:** Introduce "Reputation Nodes" into the existing application relationship graph. Each component node is linked to a corresponding Reputation Node, storing its current score.
*   **Policy Propagation:** Implement algorithms to propagate policy inheritance through the graph. Policies are inherited by neighboring nodes based on the connecting edge type and the source node's Reputation Score.
*   **Dynamic Sub-graph Generation:** When a change is detected, generate a sub-graph that includes not only the affected component but also its neighboring Reputation Nodes and the inherited policies.
*   **Threat Modeling with Dynamic Policies:** Modify the rules engine to incorporate the dynamically inherited policies into its threat modeling analysis. This allows the system to identify vulnerabilities that arise from policy misconfigurations or inheritance errors.

**Pseudocode â€“ Policy Inheritance Algorithm:**

```
function inheritPolicy(componentNode, policyTemplate):
  reputationScore = getReputationScore(componentNode)

  if reputationScore >= 0.8:
    inheritedPolicy = policyTemplate // Apply template as is
  else if reputationScore >= 0.5:
    inheritedPolicy = modifyPolicy(policyTemplate, "increase logging") // Apply template with stricter settings
  else:
    inheritedPolicy = modifyPolicy(policyTemplate, "block all access") // Block access

  return inheritedPolicy
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Use a graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) to store and query the application relationship graph and Reputation Nodes.
*   Leverage a policy engine (OPA, Rego) to define and enforce the dynamic policies.
*   Implement a real-time event streaming platform (Kafka, Pulsar) to ingest and process security events.
*   Design a user interface to visualize the application relationship graph, Reputation Nodes, and dynamically inherited policies.
