## Adaptive Notification Granularity via User Behavioral Modeling

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the granularity of application store event notifications based on real-time user behavioral analysis.

**Core Concept:** Current systems deliver notifications based on event *type* (e.g., subscription cancellation). This system will model *why* a user is taking a specific action, enabling more targeted and useful notifications, or even preemptive adjustments within the application itself.

**System Components:**

*   **Behavioral Data Ingestion:** Collect user interaction data within the application – button presses, screen views, time spent on features, in-app purchases, support ticket submissions, etc. This is *beyond* simple event tracking; focus is on sequential patterns.
*   **Real-time Behavioral Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) continuously updates a user profile based on their current and historical behavior. This model predicts the *intent* behind actions.
*   **Notification Granularity Engine:**  This engine receives the user’s intent (from the Behavioral Model) and the triggering event.  It then dynamically adjusts the content, timing, and delivery method of the notification.
*   **Adaptive Notification Profiles:**  Each user will have a profile that governs how granular notifications should be.  This is a slider setting or a preference selection within the app.  Options might include: “Essential Only”, “Helpful Insights”, “Detailed Updates”, and “Proactive Support”.
*   **Application Adjustment Module:** Instead of *always* sending a notification, the system can use the intent to trigger an *in-app adjustment*.

**Pseudocode (Notification Granularity Engine):**

```
FUNCTION generateNotification(event, userProfile):
  intent = behavioralModel.predictIntent(userProfile, event)
  granularity = userProfile.notificationGranularity

  IF intent == "frustrated_with_feature" AND event == "subscription_cancellation":
    // Instead of cancelling, offer immediate support/tutorial
    applicationAdjustmentModule.triggerTutorial("feature_help")
    notification = NULL //Suppress notification
  ELSE IF intent == "price_sensitive" AND event == "subscription_renewal":
    // Offer a discount or alternative plan
    notification = createNotification(
      title = "Renewal Options",
      body = "We have a special offer for you!",
      action = "view_renewal_options"
    )
  ELSE IF granularity == "Essential Only":
    notification = createBasicNotification(event)
  ELSE IF granularity == "Helpful Insights":
    notification = createDetailedNotification(event)
  ELSE: //granularity == "Detailed Updates" or default
    notification = createComprehensiveNotification(event)

  RETURN notification
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user cancels a subscription. 

*   **Traditional System:** Sends a generic cancellation confirmation.
*   **Adaptive System:** Analyzes user behavior and determines the user was struggling with a specific feature.  Instead of sending a cancellation confirmation, the system *immediately* launches an in-app tutorial for that feature. If the user continues with cancellation, a notification is then triggered with a 'we're sorry to see you go' message and a feedback link.

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **Data Privacy:** User behavioral data must be anonymized and handled in compliance with privacy regulations.
*   **Model Training:** Requires a large dataset of user interactions to train the behavioral model.
*   **Real-time Performance:** The behavioral model must be able to make predictions in real-time to avoid delays in notification delivery.
*   **Scalability:** System must be able to handle a large number of users and events.
