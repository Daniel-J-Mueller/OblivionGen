## Dynamic Content ‘Lifecycles’ & Automated Derivative Creation

**Specification:** Implement a system where content objects aren't just defined by permissions, but by *lifecycles*. These lifecycles dictate automated creation of derivative content based on time, usage, or external triggers.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Lifecycle Definitions:** A schema allowing users to define content object lifecycles. This includes:
    *   **Stages:** Defined periods (e.g., "Draft", "Review", "Published", "Archived").
    *   **Triggers:** Conditions that move the content object between stages (e.g., time elapsed, number of views, approval by designated users, external data feed event).
    *   **Derivative Rules:** Actions to perform *automatically* when transitioning between stages. Examples:
        *   Convert file format (e.g., DOCX to PDF).
        *   Reduce resolution of images/videos.
        *   Watermark content.
        *   Create summary/abstract.
        *   Generate social media snippets.
        *   Run automated compliance checks.
2.  **Content Object Metadata Extension:** Add a “Lifecycle State” field to content object metadata. This field stores the current stage and timestamp of the last transition.
3.  **Automated Derivative Engine:** A service that monitors content object lifecycle state changes. Upon detecting a change, it executes the corresponding derivative rules.
4.  **Versioning System Integration:**  All derivative creations are automatically versioned, retaining a complete history of content evolution. Each version links back to the original content object and the lifecycle state that triggered its creation.
5.  **Workflow Integration:** Allow lifecycles to be triggered by external workflows (e.g., a legal review process automatically moves a document to "Published" after approval).

**Pseudocode (Derivative Engine):**

```
function processLifecycleChange(contentObject) {
  lifecycleState = contentObject.lifecycleState
  previousState = contentObject.previousLifecycleState //Store for rollback

  if (lifecycleState != previousState) {
    derivativeRules = getDerivativeRules(lifecycleState)
    for (rule in derivativeRules) {
      try {
        executeRule(rule, contentObject)
        createVersion(contentObject) //Save new version
      } catch (error) {
        //Log error, possibly rollback to previous version
        logError("Derivative rule execution failed", error)
      }
    }
    contentObject.previousLifecycleState = lifecycleState
    saveContentObject(contentObject)
  }
}

function getDerivativeRules(lifecycleState) {
  //Retrieve rules associated with the current lifecycle state from a configuration database
}

function executeRule(rule, contentObject) {
  //Apply the derivative rule to the content object (e.g., convert file format, watermark)
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Compliance:** Automatically archive or redact content after a defined retention period.
*   **Marketing:** Generate different versions of content for various social media platforms.
*   **Education:** Create summaries or simplified versions of documents for different reading levels.
*   **Legal:** Automatically redact sensitive information from documents before sharing.
*   **Long-term preservation:** Convert content to archival formats for future access.
