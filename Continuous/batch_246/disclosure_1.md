## Dynamic Content ‘Echo’ & Anticipatory Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of pre-delivery of content, but instead of simply timing it based on user habits or network conditions, create a system that ‘echoes’ recently consumed content *and* anticipates what the user will likely want next based on contextual data beyond just reading history.  This builds a ‘content bubble’ around the user, constantly refreshing and predicting.

**Specs:**

**1. Echo Module:**

*   **Function:**  Identifies content recently displayed/interacted with (last 1-3 items).
*   **Action:**  Initiates a low-priority pre-fetch of “similar” content. Similarity is determined by a multi-faceted algorithm (see section 3).  This isn’t a complete re-download; it’s a differential update. Only altered portions of the content are fetched.
*   **Trigger:**  Active when device is connected to Wi-Fi or charging *and* is in a low-power state (screen off, but device awake).
*   **Storage:** Prefetched ‘echo’ content is stored in a dedicated, compressed cache partition.

**2. Anticipatory Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Reading History:** (As in the original patent)
    *   **Time of Day:**  Different content preferences at different times.
    *   **Location:** (Optional, user permission required) – News from local areas, recommendations for nearby points of interest if the content supports it.
    *   **Calendar Integration:** (Optional, user permission required) –  If the user has a meeting scheduled about a particular topic, pre-fetch relevant articles or documents.
    *   **Connected Devices:** –  If the user is listening to music on a connected speaker, suggest related articles or podcasts.
*   **Algorithm:** Uses a weighted scoring system to rank potential content. Weights are adjustable based on user interaction and learned preferences.  A Bayesian network could be utilized to model dependencies between data sources.
*   **Action:**  Initiates a higher-priority pre-fetch of top-ranked content.

**3. Similarity Algorithm:**

*   **Multi-faceted Analysis:**
    *   **Keyword Density:** Compare keywords between content.
    *   **Topic Modeling (LDA/NMF):** Identify underlying topics and compare topic distributions.
    *   **Entity Recognition:** Extract named entities (people, places, organizations) and compare entity occurrences.
    *   **Style Analysis:**  Analyze writing style (tone, complexity) and compare.
*   **Weighted Scoring:**  Each metric contributes to an overall similarity score. Weights are adjustable and learned over time.

**4.  Adaptive Prefetching:**

*   **Bandwidth Awareness:**  Dynamically adjust prefetch priority and amount based on available bandwidth.
*   **Battery Management:**  Defer prefetching if battery level is low.
*   **User Control:**  Allow users to disable prefetching, adjust prefetch settings, and clear the prefetch cache.

**Pseudocode (Anticipatory Module):**

```
function calculateContentScore(content, userContext) {
  score = 0;

  // Reading History Score (weight = historyWeight)
  score += historyWeight * getHistoryScore(content, user.readingHistory);

  // Time of Day Score (weight = timeWeight)
  score += timeWeight * getTimeOfDayScore(content, user.currentTime);

  // Location Score (if location permission granted)
  if (user.locationPermission) {
    score += locationWeight * getLocationScore(content, user.currentLocation);
  }

  // Calendar Score (if calendar integration enabled)
  if (user.calendarIntegration) {
    score += calendarWeight * getCalendarScore(content, user.upcomingEvents);
  }

  // Connected Device Score
  score += connectedDeviceWeight * getConnectedDeviceScore(content, user.connectedDevices);

  return score;
}

function rankContent(contentList, userContext) {
  rankedContent = [];
  for (content in contentList) {
    score = calculateContentScore(content, userContext);
    rankedContent.push({content: content, score: score});
  }
  rankedContent.sort(byScore); // sort descending
  return rankedContent;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Dedicated hardware acceleration for similarity analysis (e.g., neural processing unit).
*   Optimized data structures for efficient content indexing and retrieval.
*   Secure storage and transmission of user data.
