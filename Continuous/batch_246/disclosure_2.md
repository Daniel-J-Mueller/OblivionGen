## Adaptive Environmental 'Mood' System

**Concept:** Extend the anomaly detection beyond simple on/off states to encompass a wider range of environmental factors and user preferences, creating a dynamic ‘mood’ for a space and proactively adjusting device behavior to match or counteract it.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate data streams from:
    *   Ambient light sensors (brightness, color temperature)
    *   Sound level meters (dB, frequency analysis)
    *   Temperature/Humidity sensors
    *   Air Quality sensors (VOCs, CO2)
    *   Motion sensors (occupancy, activity level)
    *   User biometric data (optional, with consent – heart rate via smartwatch, etc.)
*   **Data Processing Unit:** A local processing unit (edge computing) capable of:
    *   Real-time sensor data fusion.
    *   Anomaly detection based on historical data and pre-defined 'mood profiles' (see below).
    *   Predictive modeling of environmental changes.
*   **Mood Profiles:** User-definable profiles specifying desired environmental states. Examples:
    *   *“Focus”*: Bright, cool lighting, low ambient noise, optimized air quality.
    *   *“Relax”*: Dim, warm lighting, calming sounds, comfortable temperature.
    *   *“Energize”*: Bright, vibrant lighting, upbeat music, moderate temperature.
    *   *“Sleep”*: Dark, cool, quiet, optimized air quality.
*   **Actuators:** Control of connected devices:
    *   Smart lighting (brightness, color temperature, hue)
    *   Smart speakers (music, ambient sounds, white noise)
    *   Smart thermostats (temperature, humidity)
    *   Air purifiers/humidifiers/dehumidifiers
    *   Smart blinds/curtains

**Workflow:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Sensors continuously collect environmental data.
2.  **Data Fusion & Analysis:** The data processing unit fuses sensor data and analyzes it for anomalies (e.g., unusually high noise levels, sudden temperature drops).
3.  **Mood Profile Selection:** The system selects the currently active mood profile (user-defined or automatically selected based on time of day, activity, or user preferences).
4.  **Environmental Adjustment:** The system adjusts connected devices to align the environment with the selected mood profile.
5.  **Anomaly Response:**
    *   If an anomaly deviates significantly from the expected state within the selected mood profile, the system can:
        *   Provide a notification to the user (via voice-controlled device or app).
        *   Automatically adjust device settings to mitigate the anomaly (e.g., increase lighting if it detects a sudden drop in light levels).
        *   Trigger a ‘safety check’ routine (e.g., if it detects a gas leak).
6.  **Learning & Adaptation:**
    *   The system learns user preferences over time by tracking their responses to environmental changes and anomaly notifications.
    *   It can use machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences and automatically adjust the environment accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Response):**

```
function handle_anomaly(sensor_data, current_mood) {
  anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(sensor_data, current_mood)

  if (anomaly_score > threshold) {
    notification = generate_notification(anomaly_score)
    send_notification_to_user(notification)

    // Automatic Mitigation
    if (anomaly_type == "low_light") {
      increase_brightness()
    } else if (anomaly_type == "high_noise") {
      play_ambient_sound()
    }

    // Log anomaly for learning
    log_anomaly(anomaly_type, anomaly_score)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simply detecting anomalies in device states (on/off) to proactively manage the *entire* environmental experience, tailoring it to user needs and preferences. It creates a dynamic, responsive environment that adapts to changing conditions and enhances user wellbeing. The predictive modeling and learning capabilities further differentiate it from existing systems.
