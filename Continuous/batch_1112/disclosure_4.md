## Adaptive Event Granularity & Regional Prioritization

**Specification:** A system augmenting the described event bus with dynamically adjustable event granularity *and* regional prioritization based on predictive failure analysis.

**Core Concept:** Instead of simply redirecting *all* events to a secondary region upon failure detection, this system introduces the ability to selectively route events based on their criticality and predicted impact.  Further, it predicts potential regional issues *before* they manifest, allowing proactive event shifting.

**Components:**

1.  **Event Granularity Controller (EGC):** This module analyzes incoming events and classifies them into tiers (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on pre-defined rules and/or machine learning models.  The EGC modifies event payloads – stripping non-essential data for lower tiers to reduce bandwidth – before routing.

2.  **Regional Health Predictor (RHP):** An ML-driven module continuously monitors various metrics (CPU load, network latency, error rates, etc.) across all regions.  It predicts potential failures *before* they occur, assigning a 'risk score' to each region.  The RHP leverages historical data and real-time telemetry.

3.  **Adaptive Routing Engine (ARE):** This is the central routing logic. It combines the EGC’s event tier and the RHP’s risk score to make routing decisions. 

    *   **Normal Operation:** Events are routed to the primary region.
    *   **Predicted Risk:** If the RHP predicts increasing risk in the primary region, the ARE begins shifting *critical* and *high* tier events to the secondary (or tertiary) region *proactively*, before any actual failure.  Medium/Low events remain in the primary.
    *   **Confirmed Failure:** Upon actual failure, the ARE redirects *all* events, but continues to adjust granularity based on the target region’s capacity.

4.  **Dynamic Payload Compression:** As bandwidth is always a concern, payload compression is built-in. The lower the tier, the more aggressive the compression.

**Pseudocode (ARE):**

```
function routeEvent(event, regionHealthData) {
  eventTier = EventGranularityController.getTier(event);
  primaryRegionRisk = regionHealthData.primaryRegion.riskScore;
  secondaryRegionCapacity = regionHealthData.secondaryRegion.availableCapacity;

  if (primaryRegionRisk > threshold) { // Proactive shifting
    if (eventTier == "Critical" || eventTier == "High") {
      destinationRegion = "Secondary"
      event = EventGranularityController.compressPayload(event, eventTier) // Compress payload
    } else {
      destinationRegion = "Primary"
    }
  } else if (primaryRegionFailed) { // Confirmed failure
    destinationRegion = "Secondary"
    event = EventGranularityController.compressPayload(event, eventTier)
    if(secondaryRegionCapacity < threshold){
       //distribute across remaining available regions
    }

  } else {
    destinationRegion = "Primary"
  }

  sendEvent(event, destinationRegion)
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `RegionHealthData`:  Contains risk scores, available capacity, and telemetry for each region.
*   `EventTier`: An enum representing event criticality (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on simple failover. This design introduces *predictive* routing and *selective* event shifting, optimizing bandwidth usage and responsiveness. This system dynamically adapts to varying regional conditions *before* failures occur, providing a more robust and efficient event delivery system.
