## Dynamic Resource ‘Sharding’ & Predictive Pre-Allocation

**Concept:** Expand on the interruptibility concept by introducing resource ‘sharding’ – dividing a VM instance into smaller, independently interruptible ‘shards’.  Combine this with predictive pre-allocation based on user behavior and application profiling to proactively prepare for interruptions *within* shards, minimizing overall service impact.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shard Definition & Management Module:**

*   **Function:**  Defines, creates, and manages resource shards within a VM instance.
*   **Input:** VM instance configuration (CPU, RAM, storage), application profile (resource usage patterns), interruptibility policy (shard-level prioritization).
*   **Output:**  Shard configuration files, shard lifecycle management API.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Shard`: {`shardID`, `vCPU`, `RAM`, `storage`, `priority`, `applicationComponent`}.  `applicationComponent` maps to a specific function or module of the application.
    *   `VMInstance`: {`instanceID`, `shards[]`, `overallInterruptibilityPolicy`}.

**2. Predictive Interrupt Handler:**

*   **Function:** Analyzes application behavior (CPU usage, memory access, I/O) *within each shard* to predict potential interruption impacts.  Estimates 'cost' of interrupting a shard (e.g., data loss, transaction rollback, performance degradation).
*   **Input:** Real-time shard performance metrics, historical performance data, application dependency graph.
*   **Output:**  Interruption Risk Score per shard.  Prioritized interruption list (shards to interrupt first, minimizing overall cost).
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Collect real-time performance metrics for each shard.
    2.  Compare metrics to historical baseline data.
    3.  Identify shards exceeding thresholds (e.g., high CPU utilization, critical transaction in progress).
    4.  Calculate Interruption Risk Score based on metrics and application dependency graph.
    5.  Generate prioritized interruption list.

**3. Pre-Allocation Module:**

*   **Function:**  Proactively allocates spare resources (vCPU, RAM) based on predicted shard activity and potential interruption scenarios.
*   **Input:** Predictive Interrupt Handler output, historical resource usage data, spare resource availability.
*   **Output:**  Pre-allocated resource reservations.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Analyze Predictive Interrupt Handler output.
    2.  Identify shards likely to be interrupted.
    3.  Calculate resource requirements to 'absorb' interruption (e.g., temporarily shift workload to spare resources).
    4.  Reserve spare resources.

**4. Dynamic Workload Shifting Engine:**

*   **Function:**  During an interruption, seamlessly shifts workload from the interrupted shard to pre-allocated spare resources.
*   **Input:** Interruption signal, shard ID, pre-allocated resource reservations.
*   **Output:**  Running application workload on spare resources.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function handleInterruption(shardID):
      reserve = getPreAllocation(shardID)
      if reserve is null:
        //Handle failure – fallback to standard interruption procedure
        terminateShard(shardID)
        return
      //Copy in-memory state from shardID to reserve
      copyState(shardID, reserve)
      //Redirect incoming requests to reserve
      redirectTraffic(shardID, reserve)
      //Initiate graceful shutdown of shardID
      shutdownShard(shardID)
    ```

**5. API Endpoints:**

*   `allocateShards(instanceID, shardConfig[])`: Allocates shards within a VM instance.
*   `getInterruptionRisk(shardID)`: Returns the interruption risk score for a shard.
*   `requestPreAllocation(shardID, resourceRequest)`: Requests pre-allocation of resources for a shard.
*   `handleShardInterruption(shardID)`: Initiates the shard interruption process.
