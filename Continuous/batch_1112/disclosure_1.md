## Dynamic Cryptographic 'Lifecycles' & Predictive Key Rotation

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Concept:** Introduce cryptographic key 'lifecycles' based on predicted data sensitivity and usage patterns, proactively rotating keys *before* potential compromise. This extends the existing decentralized derivation to incorporate a time-to-live (TTL) prediction system.

*   **Components:**
    *   **Behavioral Analysis Module (BAM):** Integrated within the second computer device (the central key derivation authority). BAM monitors data access patterns (frequency, location, user roles) associated with each capturing component (camera). It uses machine learning to predict future sensitivity based on historical data.
    *   **Sensitivity Score:** BAM assigns a ‘Sensitivity Score’ to each capturing component (and its associated key). Higher scores indicate a greater risk profile.
    *   **Predictive TTL Algorithm:** Based on the Sensitivity Score, a Predictive TTL Algorithm determines the optimal lifespan for each key. This lifespan is *not* fixed, but dynamically adjusted.
    *   **Key Rotation Orchestrator:**  A dedicated module within the second computer device that manages the key rotation process. It initiates key derivation requests *before* the current key expires, ensuring seamless operation.
    *   **Trust Anchor:** Utilize a Hardware Security Module (HSM) within the second computer device to securely store the root key and cryptographic signing keys.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Setup:**  Root key generated and stored in the HSM. Base cryptographic keys are derived for each capturing component.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** BAM monitors data access patterns and assigns Sensitivity Scores.
3.  **TTL Prediction:** Predictive TTL Algorithm calculates the remaining lifespan for each key.
4.  **Proactive Rotation:** When the calculated remaining lifespan falls below a threshold, the Key Rotation Orchestrator initiates a new key derivation request.
5.  **Key Distribution:**  New keys are distributed to the capturing components.
6.  **Graceful Transition:** The system allows a short overlap period where both the old and new keys are valid, ensuring uninterrupted operation.
7.  **Old Key Revocation:** After the overlap period, the old key is revoked.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation Orchestrator):**

```
FUNCTION RotateKey(cameraId, currentKey)

  // Get current Sensitivity Score for cameraId
  sensitivityScore = BAM.GetSensitivityScore(cameraId)

  // Calculate predicted TTL based on sensitivity score
  predictedTTL = PredictiveTTLAlgorithm(sensitivityScore)

  // Calculate remaining TTL
  remainingTTL = currentKey.expirationTime - currentTime

  // If remaining TTL is less than predicted TTL
  IF remainingTTL < predictedTTL THEN

    // Request new key derivation from central authority
    newKey = CentralAuthority.DeriveKey(cameraId)

    // Distribute new key to camera
    DistributeKey(cameraId, newKey)

    // Update camera's key
    Camera.UpdateKey(newKey)

    // Schedule revocation of old key
    ScheduleRevocation(currentKey, revocationTime)

  ENDIF

END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Second Computer Device: Increased processing power to accommodate BAM and Predictive TTL Algorithm. HSM integration.
*   Capturing Components: Ability to securely store and update cryptographic keys.

**Data Structures:**

*   `SensitivityScore`:  Float value representing the sensitivity level (e.g., 0.0 - 1.0).
*   `KeyMetadata`:  Structure containing key ID, expiration time, sensitivity score, and derivation parameters.
