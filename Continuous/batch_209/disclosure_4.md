## Dynamic Content 'Bubbles' & Contextual Layers

**Concept:** Extend the automatic secondary content presentation to incorporate layered, interactive “bubbles” that visually float *around* the primary content, and dynamically adjust based on user gaze/interaction *and* real-world contextual data.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Device with orientation sensor, high-resolution display, front-facing camera (for gaze tracking & AR overlay), and access to environmental sensors (microphone for ambient sound, potentially barometer/temperature/humidity if integrated).
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Contextual Engine:** Core module responsible for gathering data from device sensors, external APIs (weather, location, time of day, news feeds, trending topics), and user profiles.
    *   **Content Bubble Generator:** Creates visually distinct, semi-transparent "bubbles" of varying sizes and shapes. Each bubble represents a potential secondary content item.
    *   **Gaze/Interaction Tracker:**  Monitors user eye movements (gaze tracking) and touch/gesture interactions with the primary content.
    *   **Dynamic Positioning System:** Algorithmically positions bubbles around the primary content based on:
        *   **Relevance Score:** Calculated by the Contextual Engine, indicating the correlation between the bubble's content and the primary content/user context.
        *   **Gaze Avoidance:** Bubbles automatically reposition to avoid obstructing the user’s current gaze point on the primary content.
        *   **Interaction Proximity:** Bubbles move closer to the user's touch/gesture input to encourage interaction.
    *   **Content Rendering Engine:** Renders the secondary content within the bubbles, supporting various media types (text, images, videos, interactive widgets).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Positioning System):**

```
function calculateBubblePositions(primaryContentBounds, relevanceScores, gazePoint, interactionPoint) {
  bubblePositions = []
  for each bubble in bubbles {
    // Calculate initial position based on relevance score
    x = primaryContentBounds.x + (relevanceScores[bubble] * primaryContentBounds.width)
    y = primaryContentBounds.y + (relevanceScores[bubble] * primaryContentBounds.height)

    // Gaze Avoidance: Calculate distance from gaze point
    distanceFromGaze = distance(x, y, gazePoint.x, gazePoint.y)
    if (distanceFromGaze < gazeAvoidanceRadius) {
      // Reposition bubble away from gaze
      angle = atan2(y - gazePoint.y, x - gazePoint.x) + pi
      x = gazePoint.x + (gazeAvoidanceDistance * cos(angle))
      y = gazePoint.y + (gazeAvoidanceDistance * sin(angle))
    }

    // Interaction Proximity: Move closer to interaction point
    distanceFromInteraction = distance(x, y, interactionPoint.x, interactionPoint.y)
    if (distanceFromInteraction < interactionProximityRadius) {
      x = (interactionPoint.x + x) / 2
      y = (interactionPoint.y + y) / 2
    }

    bubblePositions.push((x, y))
  }
  return bubblePositions
}
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  User views primary content in a specific orientation.
2.  Contextual Engine gathers relevant data.
3.  Content Bubble Generator creates bubbles representing potential secondary content.
4.  Dynamic Positioning System calculates optimal bubble positions based on relevance, gaze, and interaction.
5.  Bubbles are rendered around the primary content.
6.  User interacts with a bubble, revealing its content.
7.  System continuously updates bubble positions and content based on changing context and user behavior.
