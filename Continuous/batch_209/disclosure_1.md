## Dynamic Reflective Swarm Projection

**Concept:** Expand beyond fixed laser projections to utilize a swarm of micro-reflective elements dynamically controlled to create projections *anywhere* in a volume, effectively turning the entire facility into a display. This moves beyond surface projection to volumetric, holographic-like displays.

**Specs:**

*   **Micro-Reflector Units (MRUs):**
    *   Size: 5mm x 5mm x 2mm
    *   Material: Micro-machined polymer with highly reflective coating (optimized for laser wavelength).
    *   Actuation: MEMS-based gimbal system allowing for precise angular control (±45° pitch/yaw).
    *   Communication: Wireless mesh network (Zigbee or similar) for synchronized control.
    *   Power: Rechargeable micro-battery (inductive charging). Estimated lifespan: 8 hours continuous use.
    *   Quantity: Scalable, dependent on facility size. Target density: 1 MRU per cubic meter.

*   **Control System:**
    *   Central Processing Unit: High-performance server cluster.
    *   Tracking System: Multi-sensor fusion (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs) to map the facility in real-time and track the position of agents and objects.
    *   Swarm Algorithm: Optimized algorithm to calculate the necessary angles for each MRU to project a coherent image or path guidance. Incorporates collision avoidance and dynamic adjustment for moving objects.
    *   Communication Protocol: Secure and low-latency wireless communication with MRUs.

*   **Laser Source:**
    *   High-brightness, low-power laser diodes (multiple wavelengths for color).
    *   Beam steering: Galvanic mirrors to rapidly scan the laser across the MRU swarm.

**Operation:**

1.  The tracking system maps the facility and identifies the agent’s location.
2.  The control system calculates the optimal angles for each MRU to project a virtual path or guidance information towards the agent.
3.  The laser scans across the MRU swarm, illuminating them.
4.  The angled MRUs reflect the laser light, creating a visible projection in mid-air, guiding the agent towards their target.
5.  The system dynamically adjusts the MRU angles in real-time to compensate for agent movement and changes in the environment.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Angle Calculation):**

```
function calculateMRUAngles(agentPosition, targetPosition, mruList):
  for each mru in mruList:
    // Vector from MRU to agent
    vectorAgent = agentPosition - mru.position

    // Vector from MRU to target
    vectorTarget = targetPosition - mru.position

    // Angle between these vectors (needed rotation)
    angle = arccos(dotProduct(vectorAgent, vectorTarget) / (magnitude(vectorAgent) * magnitude(vectorTarget)))

    // Determine rotation axis (cross product)
    rotationAxis = crossProduct(vectorAgent, vectorTarget)

    // Calculate rotation amounts for pitch and yaw based on angle and rotation axis
    pitch = calculatePitch(angle, rotationAxis)
    yaw = calculateYaw(angle, rotationAxis)

    // Set MRU’s pitch and yaw angles
    mru.setAngles(pitch, yaw)
  return mruList
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Dynamic path guidance.
*   Volumetric product labeling.
*   Interactive training simulations.
*   Hazard warnings projected directly in the path of travel.
*   Augmented reality overlays for picking and stowing.
