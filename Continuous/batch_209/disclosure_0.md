## Adaptive Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) via Drone Swarms

**Concept:** Extend WIPS capabilities beyond static access points by deploying a swarm of autonomous drones equipped with wireless sensors and jamming capabilities. These drones dynamically patrol a defined airspace, proactively identifying and mitigating rogue access points, denial-of-service attacks, and insider threats.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Drone Platform:** Small-form factor drones (quadcopters or similar) with a minimum flight time of 30 minutes and payload capacity of 500g. Equipped with GPS, IMU, obstacle avoidance sensors (LiDAR/ultrasonic), and secure communication links.
*   **Wireless Sensor Suite:** Each drone integrates a multi-mode wireless receiver capable of monitoring 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, Bluetooth, and potentially Zigbee/Z-Wave. Includes spectrum analyzer functionality to identify anomalous signals.
*   **Jamming Capability:**  Low-power, selective jamming module capable of disrupting specific wireless frequencies.  Jamming is *only* activated upon confirmed threat detection and is targeted to minimize collateral interference.
*   **Swarm Control System:** A centralized ground station manages the drone swarm. Utilizes a mesh network for inter-drone communication. Algorithms for dynamic task allocation, collision avoidance, and optimized airspace coverage.
*   **Threat Detection Engine:**  Machine learning models running on the ground station analyze wireless signal data from the drones. Detects:
    *   Rogue Access Points: Identifies unauthorized access points broadcasting with similar SSIDs or exhibiting malicious behavior.
    *   Denial-of-Service Attacks: Detects flooding or jamming attacks targeting legitimate wireless networks.
    *   Insider Threats: Detects anomalous wireless activity originating from internal devices (e.g., unauthorized data transfer).
*   **Automatic Mitigation:** Based on threat detection, the system triggers automatic mitigation actions:
    *   Rogue AP Isolation: Drones physically approach and jam the rogue access point, disrupting its signal.
    *   DoS Attack Countermeasures: Drones collectively jam the source of the denial-of-service attack.
    *   Insider Threat Alerting: The system generates alerts for security administrators, providing details of the suspicious activity.
*   **Secure Communication:** All communication between drones and the ground station is encrypted using AES-256.  Authentication mechanisms prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Power Management:** Automated drone docking/charging stations provide continuous operation.  Intelligent power allocation optimizes flight time.

**Pseudocode (Threat Detection & Mitigation):**

```
// Ground Station Loop

while (true) {
  // Receive Wireless Signal Data from Drones
  signalData = receiveDataFromDrones()

  // Analyze Signal Data for Threats
  threats = analyzeSignalData(signalData)

  // For each detected threat:
  for each (threat in threats) {
    // Determine Threat Type (Rogue AP, DoS, Insider)
    threatType = determineThreatType(threat)

    // Based on threat type:
    if (threatType == "Rogue AP") {
      // Instruct nearby drones to approach and jam the rogue AP
      instructDronesToJam(threat.location)
    } else if (threatType == "DoS") {
      // Instruct drones to jam the source of the DoS attack
      instructDronesToJam(threat.sourceLocation)
    } else if (threatType == "Insider") {
      // Generate alert for security administrators
      generateAlert(threat.details)
    }
  }

  // Update drone swarm configuration (task allocation, airspace coverage)
  updateSwarmConfiguration()

  // Wait for next data update
  wait(1 second)
}
```

**Novelty:**  Combines the proactive capabilities of a dynamic drone swarm with advanced wireless threat detection.  Addresses the limitations of static WIPS by providing mobile, adaptable security coverage.  Enables mitigation of threats in real-time, before they can impact the network.
