## Adaptive Execution State Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the in-memory execution state copying to a partitioned, distributed system. Instead of a single storage node holding a complete in-memory copy, the execution state is sharded across multiple storage nodes. This allows for significantly larger and more complex stateful services to be tested, exceeding the memory capacity of a single node. Further, it introduces the possibility of parallelizing state reconstruction and modification.

**Specifications:**

*   **State Partitioning Algorithm:** Implement a hashing-based partitioning scheme. The intermediate execution state is treated as a large key-value store. Keys (representing state components) are hashed, and the resulting hash determines the storage node responsible for holding that specific state component.
*   **State Metadata Service:** A central metadata service maintains a mapping between state component keys and the storage node(s) responsible for storing them. This service is critical for locating state components during test execution.  The metadata service *must* support dynamic rebalancing – the ability to migrate state components between nodes without interrupting test execution.
*   **Test Coordinator:** Introduce a "Test Coordinator" component responsible for orchestrating the state creation and modification process.  When a request arrives, the Test Coordinator:
    1.  Analyzes the request to identify which state components will be read/written.
    2.  Queries the State Metadata Service to determine the responsible storage nodes.
    3.  Sends requests to those nodes to read/write the required state.
    4.  Collects the updated state and provides it to the compute engine.
*   **Asynchronous State Updates:** Implement asynchronous state updates.  After a storage node modifies its state component, it sends a notification to the Test Coordinator. The Test Coordinator can then propagate these changes to other nodes that depend on that state.
*   **State Versioning:** Each state component must maintain a version number. This allows the system to handle concurrent access and ensure data consistency. Conflicts can be resolved using optimistic locking or other concurrency control mechanisms.
*   **Dynamic Scaling:** The storage node pool must be dynamically scalable.  Nodes can be added or removed as needed to accommodate changing test workloads.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Implement replication for each state component.  Multiple copies of each component are stored on different nodes, ensuring that the system can tolerate node failures.

**Pseudocode (Test Coordinator – handling a request):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  // 1. Identify affected state components
  affectedComponents = analyzeRequest(request)

  // 2. Get storage node locations from metadata service
  nodeMap = getStateMetadataService().getNodeMap(affectedComponents)

  // 3. Read current state from nodes (if needed)
  currentState = {}
  for component, node in nodeMap:
    currentState[component] = node.readState(component)

  // 4. Apply request to state
  newState = applyRequest(currentState, request)

  // 5. Write updated state to nodes
  for component, node in nodeMap:
    node.writeState(component, newState[component])

  // 6. Return updated state to compute engine
  return newState
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Cluster of storage nodes with fast network connectivity.
*   Dedicated Metadata Service server.
*   Test Coordinator server.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Scalability: Enables testing of very large and complex stateful services.
*   Performance: Parallel state access and modification can improve test execution speed.
*   Fault Tolerance: Replication ensures that the system can continue to operate even if some nodes fail.
*   Flexibility: The distributed architecture allows for dynamic scaling and reconfiguration.
