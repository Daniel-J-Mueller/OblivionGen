## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Personalized Wake-Word Profiles

**Concept:** Leverage multiple microphones and spatial audio processing to create dynamically adjustable “acoustic zones” around a device, coupled with personalized wake-word profiles that adapt based on environmental noise *and* user vocal characteristics detected within those zones. This goes beyond simple beamforming or noise cancellation.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum 8-microphone array (circular or phased) integrated into the device.  Microphones should have a frequency response optimized for voice command detection (1kHz - 4kHz).
*   **Spatial Audio Processor:** Dedicated hardware (DSP/FPGA) or optimized software library for real-time spatial audio analysis.
*   **Acoustic Zone Mapping:** The system automatically maps the acoustic environment, identifying zones of varying noise levels and echo characteristics.  This is achieved through constant sound source localization and analysis of reflected signals. Zones will be dynamically sized (1-5 meters radius) and adjustable by the user.
*   **Personalized Vocal Profiles:**  Upon initial setup, the device records short samples of the user’s voice saying various phrases (including the wake-word). This creates a baseline vocal profile.  This profile isn't just spectral, but includes cadence and articulation data.
*   **Adaptive Wake-Word Engine:**  A modified wake-word detection engine.  
    *   *Zone-Specific Profiles:* The engine loads the user’s vocal profile *and* the acoustic characteristics of the current zone the user is detected within. 
    *   *Dynamic Thresholding:*  Based on real-time noise analysis within the zone, the wake-word detection sensitivity dynamically adjusts.
    *   *Articulatory Feature Matching:* The engine doesn't just look for the *sound* of the wake-word, but analyzes the articulatory features (phoneme transitions, voicing patterns) to better distinguish user intent from similar-sounding phrases or ambient noise.

**Pseudocode (Wake-Word Detection):**

```
function DetectWakeWord(audio_input, microphone_array_data):
  zone_id = DetermineUserZone(microphone_array_data) //Returns ID of zone user is in
  user_profile = LoadUserProfile(user_id)
  zone_characteristics = LoadZoneCharacteristics(zone_id)
  
  //Combine user profile and zone characteristics to create a combined filter
  combined_filter = CreateCombinedFilter(user_profile, zone_characteristics)

  filtered_audio = ApplyFilter(audio_input, combined_filter)

  wake_word_detected = RunWakeWordEngine(filtered_audio)

  if wake_word_detected:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Multi-User Support:** Extend the system to support multiple user profiles and automatically switch between them based on voice recognition.
*   **Directional Audio Response:**  Enable the device to respond preferentially to voice commands originating from the identified user’s location within the acoustic zone.
*   **External Noise Cancellation Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with existing noise cancellation algorithms to further reduce background interference.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Provide users with granular control over data collection and usage related to acoustic zone mapping and voice profile creation.
