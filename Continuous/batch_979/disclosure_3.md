## Dynamic Contextual Abridgement & Multi-Modal Prompting

**Concept:** Extend the abridgement generation beyond purely dialogue-driven selection to incorporate visual cues and emotional analysis within the media, dynamically adjusting the abridgement based on both verbal *and* non-verbal content. Further, utilize this dynamically created abridgement as a prompt for a generative AI model to create entirely *new* content.

**Specs:**

**1. Multi-Modal Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Video/Audio media content.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Dialogue Transcription:**  Utilize Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to transcribe dialogue.
    *   **Visual Scene Analysis:** Employ object detection, facial expression recognition, and scene classification to analyze visual content.
    *   **Emotional Tone Detection:** Analyze both audio (prosody, intonation) and visual (facial expressions, body language) cues to determine the emotional tone of different segments.
    *   **Temporal Alignment:**  Synchronize dialogue transcripts, visual data, and emotional tone analysis to a unified timeline (using verbal timecode data as a base).
*   **Output:**  A time-series data structure containing:
    *   Dialogue transcripts with associated timestamps.
    *   Identified objects/entities with bounding box coordinates and timestamps.
    *   Facial expression scores (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger) with timestamps.
    *   Emotional tone scores with timestamps.

**2. Contextual Relevance Scoring Engine:**

*   **Input:** User search query, Multi-Modal Feature Data.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Query Expansion:** Expand user search query using semantic analysis and synonym extraction.
    *   **Relevance Scoring:** Calculate a relevance score for each segment of the media content based on:
        *   **Dialogue Match:**  Similarity between query terms and transcribed dialogue.
        *   **Visual Match:**  Presence of relevant objects/entities identified in the visual analysis.
        *   **Emotional Resonance:**  Correlation between user query’s implied emotion (determined via sentiment analysis) and the segment's emotional tone.  (e.g., a query about “sad moments” should prioritize segments with high sadness scores).
        *   **Weighted Summation:** Combine these scores using configurable weights to prioritize different factors.
*   **Output:**  A time-series relevance score for each segment of the media content.

**3. Dynamic Abridgement Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Relevance scores, maximum abridgement length.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Segment Selection:**  Select segments with the highest relevance scores.
    *   **Smooth Transition:**  Ensure smooth transitions between selected segments by including brief ‘bridge’ segments to maintain narrative flow.  (These bridge segments should prioritize segments that have relatively high relevance scores.)
    *   **Contextual Padding:** Pad the beginning and end of the abridgement with segments that provide necessary context, even if they have slightly lower relevance scores.
*   **Output:** A dynamically generated abridgement of the media content.

**4. Generative AI Prompting Module:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic abridgement, user profile data, desired content type (e.g., short story, poem, song lyrics).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Prompt Construction:** Construct a detailed prompt for a generative AI model (e.g., GPT-3, Stable Diffusion). The prompt should include:
        *   A summary of the dynamic abridgement.
        *   Keywords extracted from the abridgement.
        *   User profile data (e.g., preferred genres, writing style).
        *   Instructions for the desired content type.
    *   **Content Generation:** Submit the prompt to the generative AI model.
*   **Output:** A new piece of content generated by the AI model.

**Pseudocode (Generative AI Prompt Construction):**

```
function construct_prompt(abridgement_summary, keywords, user_profile, content_type) {
  prompt = "Generate a " + content_type + " based on the following summary: " + abridgement_summary;
  prompt += " Keywords: " + keywords.join(", ");
  prompt += " User preferences: " + user_profile.genre + ", " + user_profile.style;
  prompt += " Ensure the generated content reflects the emotional tone and themes of the abridgement.";
  return prompt;
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simple dialogue-based abridgement to leverage a richer understanding of the media content. The coupling with generative AI opens up possibilities for completely new forms of content creation, personalized to individual user preferences and based on the core themes of the original media. This isn’t about just *finding* relevant clips; it's about *transforming* them into something entirely new.
