## Dynamic Environmental Mapping with Multi-Spectral IMU Fusion

**Concept:** Augment IMU-based motion estimation with real-time environmental mapping derived from multi-spectral image analysis. The system doesn't just *calibrate* the IMU based on visual discrepancies, but actively builds a dynamic, layered environmental model to predict motion and compensate for external forces.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution RGB Camera (minimum 4K, 60fps).
    *   Thermal Infrared (IR) Camera (resolution matched to RGB, minimum 30fps).
    *   LiDAR or Time-of-Flight sensor (range minimum 5m, accuracy < 1cm).
    *   9-axis IMU (gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer) â€“ existing within the provided patent's scope.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge computing capable with dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for real-time processing.
*   **Data Storage:**  High-speed, non-volatile memory (NVMe SSD) for storing environmental map data and sensor logs.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Raw Data Acquisition:** Concurrent capture of data from all sensors.
2.  **Pre-processing:**
    *   **Image Rectification:** Correct for lens distortion and perspective.
    *   **Thermal Calibration:** Normalize thermal data to a standard temperature scale.
    *   **Point Cloud Generation:** LiDAR/ToF data converted into a 3D point cloud.
3.  **Environmental Model Building:**
    *   **Semantic Segmentation:** Deep learning model identifies objects and surfaces in RGB and thermal images (e.g., road, buildings, vegetation, people).
    *   **Surface Normal Estimation:** Calculate surface normals from point cloud and segmented images to determine surface orientation.
    *   **Dynamic Object Tracking:**  Identify and track moving objects (vehicles, pedestrians) using optical flow and object detection algorithms.
    *   **Multi-Spectral Fusion:** Combine RGB, thermal, and LiDAR data to create a layered environmental model. This model includes:
        *   **Static Map:** Permanent features (buildings, roads).
        *   **Dynamic Layer:** Moving objects and temporary changes (e.g., construction).
        *   **Thermal Layer:** Temperature gradients and heat signatures.
4.  **Motion Prediction & Compensation:**
    *   **Physics Engine Integration:** Integrate the environmental model into a physics engine to simulate device motion and external forces.
    *   **Force Estimation:** Use the environmental model to estimate forces acting on the device (e.g., wind resistance, friction).
    *   **Kalman Filter Fusion:** Fuse IMU data with physics engine predictions using a Kalman filter to generate a corrected motion estimate.
5.  **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Train a reinforcement learning agent to optimize the Kalman filter parameters and physics engine settings based on real-world performance.
    *   **Model Refinement:** Continuously refine the environmental model using sensor data and user feedback.

**Pseudocode (Motion Prediction):**

```
// Initialize environmental model and physics engine
model = load_environmental_model()
engine = initialize_physics_engine(model)

// Get current IMU data
imu_data = read_imu_data()

// Predict motion using physics engine and IMU data
predicted_motion = engine.predict_motion(imu_data, model)

// Get external force estimates from environmental model
external_forces = model.estimate_external_forces()

// Apply external forces to predicted motion
corrected_motion = predicted_motion + external_forces

// Filter the combined motion estimate using Kalman filter
final_motion = kalman_filter.update(corrected_motion, imu_data)

// Return the final motion estimate
return final_motion
```
