## Adaptive Chunking & Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple fixed-size chunking by introducing adaptive chunk sizes determined by data content *and* predictive pre-fetching of subsequent chunks based on processing time of current chunks. This creates a dynamically sized, pipelined data processing system.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Profiler Module:**
   *   **Function:** Analyze incoming data segments (initial portion of target data set).
   *   **Metrics:** Calculate data entropy, compression ratio (using lossless algorithms – e.g., LZ4, Zstandard), and structural complexity (e.g., number of distinct values, pattern repetition).
   *   **Output:** Data profile – a vector of values representing the characteristics of the data.

**2. Chunk Size Calculator:**
   *   **Input:** Data profile, per-execution duration limit.
   *   **Algorithm:**
        *   Train a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, small neural network) on historical data correlating data profiles with optimal chunk sizes that maximize processing throughput within the duration limit.
        *   Predict the optimal chunk size for the current data segment based on its profile.
        *   Dynamic adjustment: Monitor the actual processing time of each chunk. If processing consistently exceeds expectations, *reduce* the chunk size. If processing is consistently *faster* than expected, *increase* the chunk size (within bounds).
   *   **Output:** Optimal chunk size (in bytes).

**3. Predictive Pre-Fetch Module:**
   *   **Input:** Processing time of current chunk, optimal chunk size, duration limit, historical processing time data.
   *   **Algorithm:**
        *   Calculate the estimated remaining processing time given the current chunk's processing time.
        *   Based on historical data, predict the probability of needing the next chunk *before* the current chunk completes.
        *   If the probability exceeds a threshold (e.g., 70%), asynchronously request the next chunk.
        *   Maintain a "prefetch queue" of upcoming chunks.
   *   **Output:** Prefetched data chunks (stored in a buffer).

**4. Task Execution Flow:**

```pseudocode
// Initial Setup
data_set = input_data_set
duration_limit = on_demand_code_execution_system.get_duration_limit()

// First Execution
chunk_size = ChunkSizeCalculator(DataProfiler(data_set[:1024]), duration_limit)  // Initial profile & chunk size
current_chunk = data_set[:chunk_size]

while current_chunk:
    start_time = current_time()
    processed_chunk = process_data(current_chunk)
    end_time = current_time()
    processing_time = end_time - start_time

    // Update chunk size based on processing time
    new_chunk_size = ChunkSizeCalculator(DataProfiler(data_set[len(data_set) - 1024:]), duration_limit) // Re-profile near end of data.
    chunk_size = min(max(new_chunk_size, 1024), 16384) // Clamp to reasonable bounds

    // Prefetch next chunk
    PrefetchModule(processing_time, chunk_size)

    // Generate state information
    state = {
        "chunk_size": chunk_size,
        "processed_bytes": len(processed_chunk),
        "offset": len(processed_chunk)
    }

    // If duration limit is reached, transmit state and request new execution
    if current_time() - start_time > duration_limit:
        transmit_state(state)
        request_new_execution()

    data_set = data_set[chunk_size:]
    if len(data_set) > 0:
        current_chunk = data_set[:chunk_size]
    else:
        current_chunk = None

// Completion
```

**5. State Information Format:**

```json
{
  "chunk_size": 8192,
  "processed_bytes": 4096,
  "offset": 8192
}
```

**Rationale:** This system aims to optimize throughput by dynamically adapting chunk sizes to data characteristics and proactively fetching subsequent chunks.  It moves beyond simple partitioning and introduces a feedback loop that learns from processing time, potentially significantly reducing overall processing time for large datasets. The focus is on *predictive* optimization rather than reactive adjustment.
