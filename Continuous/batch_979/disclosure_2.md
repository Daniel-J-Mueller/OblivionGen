## Personalized Garment Morphing & Dynamic Visualization

**Concept:** Expand beyond static fit scores and visualizations by allowing users to *dynamically morph* a garment’s appearance on a virtual model to reflect personalized fit preferences *before* purchase. This goes beyond simple size selection.

**Specs:**

1.  **3D Garment Model:** Each garment in the system will be represented by a high-resolution, parametric 3D model.  This model isn’t just visual; it’s structurally defined – seams, stretch characteristics, fabric thickness, etc. are all data points.

2.  **Virtual Model Customization:** Users create (or select from presets) a detailed virtual model representing their body shape. This includes not just height/weight but finer-grained data: shoulder slope, arm length, waist-to-hip ratio, etc. This data is captured via phone camera scan, manual input, or integration with existing body scanning apps.

3.  **Morphing Controls:**  The core innovation. Within the user interface, provide a set of intuitive controls that allow the user to locally deform the 3D garment model *on the virtual model*.  Examples:
    *   **Stretch Sliders:**  Individual sliders for stretch in various zones (waist, hips, thighs, chest, etc.). Applying a slider increases the local circumference of the garment model in that zone.
    *   **Tuck/Blouse Controls:** Buttons/sliders to simulate how a shirt is tucked in or blouses out.
    *   **Drape Controls:** Adjust the overall drape/hang of the garment (e.g., a more fitted vs. relaxed look).
    *   **Seam Adjustments:**  Minor adjustments to seam positions to refine fit (e.g., lengthening a pant leg).

4.  **Real-time Rendering & Physics Simulation:**  As the user manipulates the controls, the 3D garment model dynamically updates in real-time on the virtual model. A lightweight physics simulation engine is crucial to ensure realistic fabric behavior (draping, wrinkling, stretching).

5.  **Fit Score Recalculation:**  As the user deforms the garment, the system *continuously* recalculates the fit scores (as defined in the source patent) based on the new shape of the garment.  These scores provide feedback on how the user's customizations affect the overall fit.

6.  **Personalized Fit Profile:** Store user customizations as a "personalized fit profile." This allows the user to quickly apply their preferred fit settings to other garments of the same type.

7.  **Style Recommendations:** Based on the user’s fit customizations, the system can recommend alternative styles or garments that might be a better fit.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function updateGarmentShape(userControls):
  // userControls:  Data from the UI (stretch sliders, drape controls, etc.)

  // 1. Apply User Controls to 3D Garment Model:
  for each control in userControls:
    if control.type == "stretch":
      applyStretch(control.zone, control.value)
    elif control.type == "drape":
      applyDrape(control.value)
    // ... other control types ...

  // 2. Run Physics Simulation:
  runPhysicsSimulation(garmentModel, virtualModel)

  // 3. Recalculate Fit Scores:
  fitScores = calculateFitScores(garmentModel, virtualModel)

  // 4. Render Updated View:
  renderView(garmentModel, virtualModel, fitScores)

function calculateFitScores(garmentModel, virtualModel):
  // (Same logic as original patent, but applied to the *deformed* garment model)
  // Access measurements from the deformed garment model
  // Calculate scores for each fit characteristic
  return fitScores
```

**Expansion:** Integrate with AR/VR to allow users to “try on” the virtually deformed garment in a fully immersive environment.
