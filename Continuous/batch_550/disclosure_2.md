## Dynamic Contextual Persona Synthesis

**Core Concept:** Extend contact resolution beyond name matching to incorporate a dynamic, synthesized persona based on communication history, publicly available data, and inferred intent, enabling a more nuanced and proactive communication experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Data Aggregation Module:**

*   **Input:** Contact Identifier (from existing contact list), Communication History (text, audio, metadata - timestamps, duration, frequency), Public Data Sources (Social media, professional networks – LinkedIn, company websites – utilizing APIs, consent-based access).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Sentiment analysis of communication history, topic modeling, entity recognition.
    *   Data Fusion – Combine structured data (demographics, job title) with unstructured data (communication content) to create a holistic profile.
    *   Inference Engine – Predict communication preferences (preferred channels, response times, formality levels) based on historical patterns.
*   **Output:** Synthesized Persona – Structured data representing the contact's communication style, interests, and likely intent.  This is a 'Persona Object' containing fields like: `formality_level` (0-1), `responsiveness_score` (0-1), `topic_affinity` (list of weighted topics), `preferred_channel` (voice, text, email), `communication_history_summary`.

**2. Intent Prediction & Adaptive Communication Module:**

*   **Input:**  First audio data representing a user utterance, Synthesized Persona Object.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Intent Classification – Determine the user’s goal (e.g., schedule meeting, request information, provide update).
    *   Persona-Aware Dialogue Management –  Adjust communication strategy based on the Synthesized Persona.
        *   *Formality Level:*  Select appropriate language and tone (e.g., formal vs. informal greetings, use of jargon).
        *   *Responsiveness Score:*  Adjust expected response times and proactive messaging (e.g., send follow-up reminders for low-responsiveness contacts).
        *   *Topic Affinity:* Prioritize relevant information and personalize content.
        *   *Preferred Channel:*  Initiate communication via the contact’s preferred channel.
*   **Output:**  Dynamically generated communication content (text or audio) tailored to the contact’s synthesized persona.

**3.  Contextual Skip List Augmentation:**

*   **Input:** Contact Identifier, Communication History, Synthesized Persona Object, Existing Contact Identifier Skip List.
*   **Processing:**  The skip list isn’t solely based on direct user rejection. It’s augmented with *contextual* data:
    *   *Persona Mismatch:* If the user’s utterance indicates an intent incongruent with the contact’s persona (e.g., sending a technical document to a contact with no technical affinity), add the contact to the skip list for that *specific intent*.
    *   *Communication Pattern Disruption:* If a contact consistently ignores messages related to a specific topic, add them to the skip list for that topic.
*   **Output:**  Updated Contact Identifier Skip List, incorporating contextual filtering.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction & Adaptive Communication):**

```python
def generate_response(utterance, persona):
  intent = classify_intent(utterance)
  formality = persona.formality_level
  topic_affinity = persona.topic_affinity

  if intent == "schedule_meeting":
    response_template = "Let's find a time that works for both of us."
    if formality > 0.7:
      response_template = "Would you be available for a meeting at your earliest convenience?"

    # Prioritize meeting times related to top topics
    relevant_topics = [topic for topic, weight in topic_affinity.items() if weight > 0.5]
    suggested_times = find_available_times(relevant_topics)

    response = response_template + " Here are some times related to " + ", ".join(relevant_topics) + ": " + str(suggested_times)

  return response
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simple contact resolution and adds a dynamic layer of persona synthesis.  The communication system doesn't just *find* a contact, it *adapts* to them, creating a more personalized and efficient communication experience.  The context-aware skip list ensures that communication patterns are refined, preventing irrelevant or disruptive interactions.
