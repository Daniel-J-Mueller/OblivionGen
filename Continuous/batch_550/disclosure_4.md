## Dynamic Sensitive Attribute Weighting via User Feedback Loops

**Concept:** Extend the bias mitigation system by introducing a dynamic weighting system for sensitive attributes, informed by real-time user feedback. Instead of pre-defining which sensitive attributes to suppress and to what extent, the system *learns* user preferences regarding representation and adjusts mitigation strategies accordingly.

**Specs:**

1.  **User Feedback Mechanism:**
    *   Implement an unobtrusive feedback mechanism within the search results interface.  Examples:
        *   "More like this" / "Less like this" buttons on individual results.
        *   A sliding scale allowing users to indicate the desired level of diversity/representation regarding specific attributes (e.g., "Show more results featuring people of color").
        *   Implicit feedback: Tracking user dwell time on results featuring different demographic characteristics.
    *   Data is anonymized and aggregated. Individual user data is *never* used for direct mitigation.

2.  **Attribute-Specific Weighting Vectors:**
    *   Maintain a vector of weights for each sensitive attribute (gender, race, age, etc.).  These weights determine the strength of the bias mitigation transformation applied to the query embedding.
    *   Initialize weights to a neutral value (e.g., 0).
    *   Update weights based on aggregated user feedback.  Positive feedback (e.g., prolonged viewing of diverse results) increases the weight, indicating a preference for representation. Negative feedback decreases the weight, indicating a preference for suppressing that characteristic.

3.  **Dynamic Transformation Matrix Adjustment:**
    *   The bias mitigation transformation matrix (as described in the provided patent) is not static. It's adjusted dynamically based on the attribute-specific weights.
    *   The adjustment can be implemented as a scaling factor applied to the matrix elements corresponding to the sensitive attribute.
    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        // Input: Query Embedding (QE), Attribute Weights (AW), Static Transformation Matrix (STM)
        // Output: Adjusted Transformation Matrix (ATM)

        ATM = STM * diag(AW) 

        //diag(AW) creates a diagonal matrix with AW as the diagonal elements
        //ATM is then used for the bias mitigation transformation
        ```

4.  **Contextual Awareness:**
    *   The system considers the *context* of the search query when adjusting weights. A query like "doctor" should have different weighting than a query like "historical figures."
    *   A classification model (trained on a large corpus of text and images) determines the appropriate context and adjusts the weighting accordingly.

5.  **Regularization & Safety Nets:**
    *   Implement regularization techniques to prevent extreme weight values that could lead to unintended consequences.
    *   A “safety net” mechanism enforces minimum and maximum representation levels for each attribute to ensure fairness and prevent the system from completely suppressing certain demographics.
    *   A human-in-the-loop system allows moderators to review and override weight adjustments if necessary.

6.  **A/B Testing & Evaluation:**
    *   Continuously A/B test different weighting strategies and evaluation metrics (e.g., diversity, fairness, user satisfaction) to optimize performance.



This system creates a continuously learning bias mitigation engine that adapts to user preferences and ensures a more inclusive and relevant search experience. It’s a shift from *removing* bias to *managing* representation in a way that aligns with user needs and values.
