## Dynamic Swarm Resourcing via Predictive Task Decomposition

**Concept:** Extend the heterogenous fleet management system to proactively decompose high-level tasks into granular sub-tasks *before* they are assigned, predicting resource contention and dynamically adjusting swarm composition based on real-time facility data and predictive modeling.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Predictive Task Decomposition Engine (PTDE)
*   **Inputs:**
    *   High-level task requests (via existing APIs)
    *   Fleet registry data (capacity, status, location)
    *   Destination registry data (mapping, capacities)
    *   Real-time sensor data (facility occupancy, environmental conditions, object tracking - integrated with centralized repository)
    *   Historical task completion data (performance metrics for robot types, routes, task durations)
    *   Pre-trained Machine Learning Model (Task Decomposition & Resource Prediction â€“ separate component, continually updated)
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Granular sub-task list (prioritized, with estimated completion times, resource requirements)
    *   Dynamic swarm composition recommendations (specific robot types/quantities for each sub-task, considering proximity, capability, and predicted congestion)
    *   Optimized task assignment schedules (time-stamped sub-task allocation to robots)
    *   Proactive resource pre-positioning recommendations (suggests moving robots to anticipate future needs)
*   **Process:**
    1.  Receive high-level task request.
    2.  ML Model decomposes task into sub-tasks based on task definition and historical data.
    3.  PTDE analyzes Destination Registry to understand spatial requirements.
    4.  PTDE utilizes Real-time sensor data to identify potential bottlenecks/congestion in the facility.
    5.  PTDE accesses Fleet Registry to determine available robots and their capabilities.
    6.  PTDE dynamically assigns sub-tasks to the optimal swarm composition, factoring in:
        *   Robot capability (matching sub-task requirements)
        *   Robot proximity (minimizing travel time)
        *   Predicted congestion (avoiding bottlenecks)
        *   Robot workload (balancing task distribution)
    7.  Output optimized task assignment schedule and swarm composition recommendations.
    8.  Continually monitor task progress and dynamically adjust swarm composition in response to unexpected events or delays.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION DecomposeAndAssignTask(taskRequest)
    subTaskList = ML_Model.DecomposeTask(taskRequest)
    
    FOREACH subTask IN subTaskList
        bestSwarm = FindOptimalSwarm(subTask)
        assignmentSchedule = GenerateAssignmentSchedule(subTask, bestSwarm)
        
        AssignSubTask(subTask, bestSwarm, assignmentSchedule)
    END FOREACH
    
    MonitorTaskProgress()
    
    RETURN success
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION FindOptimalSwarm(subTask)
    availableRobots = FleetRegistry.GetAvailableRobots()
    
    candidateSwarms = GenerateCandidateSwarms(availableRobots, subTask)
    
    FOREACH swarm IN candidateSwarms
        swarmScore = CalculateSwarmScore(swarm, subTask)
    END FOREACH
    
    bestSwarm = SelectBestSwarm(candidateSwarms, swarmScores)
    
    RETURN bestSwarm
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateSwarmScore(swarm, subTask)
    capabilityScore = CalculateCapabilityScore(swarm, subTask)
    proximityScore = CalculateProximityScore(swarm, subTask)
    congestionScore = CalculateCongestionScore(swarm, subTask)
    
    swarmScore = (capabilityScore * weight1) + (proximityScore * weight2) + (congestionScore * weight3)
    
    RETURN swarmScore
END FUNCTION
