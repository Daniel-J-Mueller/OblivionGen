## Dynamic Sensor Fusion & Predictive Calibration System

**Concept:** Extend the multi-sensor approach beyond simple switching and analysis to create a system that *predictively* calibrates and fuses data from diverse sensor arrays based on environmental context *before* data acquisition, minimizing processing overhead and maximizing data fidelity.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensor Array & Hardware:**

*   **Core Array:**  The existing paired sensor structure (infrared/RGB, monochrome/color) is maintained, but expanded. Add a third sensor *pair*: a low-light visible spectrum sensor and a short-wave infrared (SWIR) sensor.
*   **Micro-Optic Array:** Integrate a micro-optic array positioned *before* the sensor array. This array will consist of dynamically adjustable lenses and filters. Each lens/filter element corresponds to a specific sensor.
*   **Environmental Context Sensors:**  Include a suite of dedicated environmental context sensors:
    *   Ambient Light Sensor (broad spectrum)
    *   Proximity Sensor (LiDAR or Time-of-Flight)
    *   Ambient Temperature Sensor
    *   Humidity Sensor
    *   Microphone (for acoustic scene analysis)
*   **Dedicated Edge Processor:** A low-power, high-throughput edge processor dedicated to sensor fusion and calibration. This processor will run the predictive algorithms.

**2. Predictive Calibration Algorithm (PCA):**

*   **Training Phase:** A pre-training phase using a diverse dataset of environmental conditions. The PCA algorithm learns the optimal calibration parameters (gain, offset, white balance, exposure) for each sensor *given* a specific set of environmental context readings.
*   **Real-Time Prediction:**  In real-time, the environmental context sensors feed data to the PCA algorithm. The algorithm predicts the optimal calibration parameters for each sensor *before* any image data is acquired.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  The PCA algorithm *also* controls the micro-optic array, adjusting lenses and filters to optimize light capture for each sensor *based on* the predicted calibration and environmental conditions.
*   **Sensor Selection Bias:**  The PCA algorithm dynamically weights the contribution of each sensor to the final fused image based on the predicted environmental conditions. For example, in low-light conditions, the SWIR and low-light visible spectrum sensors will be given higher weight.

**3. Sensor Fusion Engine:**

*   **Adaptive Fusion:**  The fusion engine will implement an adaptive fusion algorithm.  This algorithm dynamically adjusts the fusion weights based on the PCAâ€™s output.
*   **Temporal Filtering:**  Implement a temporal filtering scheme to reduce noise and improve data stability.
*   **Output Formats:** Support various output formats, including standard image formats (JPEG, PNG) and depth maps.

**4. Pseudocode (PCA Algorithm):**

```pseudocode
// Input: Environmental Context Data (EC), Sensor Configuration (SC)
// Output: Calibration Parameters (CP) for each sensor

function predictCalibrationParameters(EC, SC):
  // 1. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from EC (light level, distance, temperature, humidity).
  features = extractFeatures(EC)

  // 2. Model Prediction: Use a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., neural network) to predict optimal calibration parameters for each sensor.
  CP = model.predict(features)

  // 3. Dynamic Adjustment: Adjust the micro-optic array based on the predicted calibration parameters.
  adjustMicroOpticArray(CP)

  return CP
```

**5. Operational Modes:**

*   **Normal Mode:** The system operates using the PCA and sensor fusion engine to produce a high-quality fused image.
*   **Low-Power Mode:** The PCA algorithm is simplified, and the sensor fusion engine operates at a lower frame rate to conserve power.
*   **Emergency Mode:**  A single sensor (e.g., SWIR) is selected based on pre-defined criteria, and the system operates in a minimal power mode.
