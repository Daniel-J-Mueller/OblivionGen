## Dynamic Swarm Prioritization & Negotiation System

**Concept:** Expanding on the conflict resolution aspect, this system introduces a dynamic prioritization and negotiation layer *between* MDUs, enabling them to collaboratively resolve conflicts *before* escalating to the central system. It shifts from reactive resolution to proactive negotiation.

**Specs:**

**1. MDU-Level Negotiation Module:**

*   **Core Function:** Each MDU possesses a module responsible for initiating and participating in negotiations with nearby MDUs.
*   **Negotiation Parameters:**
    *   *Task Priority:* Numerical value assigned to the current task.
    *   *Time Sensitivity:* Estimate of the task's urgency.
    *   *Path Cost:* Calculated cost (distance, energy consumption, congestion) of the current path.
    *   *MDU Status:* Battery level, current speed, planned maintenance.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Short-range, dedicated radio frequency (DRF) mesh network between MDUs.  DRF eliminates reliance on potentially congested central network.
*   **Negotiation Algorithms:**
    *   *Weighted Sum:* Each parameter is assigned a weight, and the weighted sum is used to determine the ‘value’ of a task.
    *   *Pareto Optimization:* Identify mutually beneficial solutions where no MDU can improve its outcome without worsening another’s.

**2. Dynamic Swarm Prioritization System:**

*   **Swarm Formation:** MDUs within a defined radius automatically form a ‘swarm’. Swarm size is dynamic.
*   **Leader Election:** A temporary ‘leader’ MDU is elected within each swarm based on task priority and remaining battery. The leader initiates negotiations.
*   **Negotiation Process:**
    1.  Leader broadcasts its task details (priority, time sensitivity, path).
    2.  Other MDUs respond with their own task details.
    3.  Leader evaluates responses using the defined algorithms.
    4.  Leader proposes a solution (e.g., “MDU X, can you delay your task by Y minutes?”).
    5.  Responding MDU accepts or counter-proposes.
    6.  Negotiation continues until a mutually acceptable solution is reached, or a timeout is triggered.
*   **Timeout Mechanism:** If negotiation fails, the system escalates to the central system for resolution.

**3. Central System Integration:**

*   **Negotiation Log:**  MDUs log all negotiation attempts (successful and failed) to the central system.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** The central system uses reinforcement learning to optimize negotiation weights and algorithms based on logged data.  This adaptive learning enhances swarm efficiency over time.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** The central system monitors negotiation patterns to identify potential system failures or malicious activity (e.g., an MDU consistently refusing to cooperate).

**Pseudocode (MDU Negotiation Module):**

```
FUNCTION initiateNegotiation()
  broadcastTaskDetails()
  responses = receiveResponses()
  bestSolution = findBestSolution(responses)
  IF bestSolution != NULL
    proposeSolution(bestSolution)
    IF solutionAccepted()
      logSuccessfulNegotiation()
      adjustPath()
      RETURN TRUE
    ELSE
      logFailedNegotiation()
      escalateToCentralSystem()
      RETURN FALSE
  ELSE
    escalateToCentralSystem()
    RETURN FALSE
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION findBestSolution(responses)
  FOR each response in responses
    calculateSolutionValue(response) // Based on weights & algorithms
  ENDFOR
  RETURN response with highest solution value
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Short-range DRF transceivers on each MDU.
*   Increased processing power on MDUs to handle negotiation algorithms.
*   Enhanced central system processing for reinforcement learning.

**Novelty:** The key innovation is shifting negotiation *to* the swarm level. Existing systems rely solely on central resolution.  This approach reduces central system load, improves response time, and creates a more robust and adaptable inventory system.  The use of reinforcement learning to *optimize* swarm negotiation behavior is also unique.
