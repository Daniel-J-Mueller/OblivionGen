## Dynamic Notification "Bubbles" & Spatial Audio Integration

**Concept:** Extend the context-aware notification system to utilize a persistent, spatially-mapped notification "bubble" interface, combined with advanced spatial audio delivery. Instead of solely relying on volume adjustments or vibration, notifications manifest as visual and auditory "bubbles" anchored to real-world objects or locations *relative* to the user, dynamically adjusting in size, brightness, and audio characteristics based on proximity and urgency.

**Specs:**

**1. Spatial Mapping & Bubble Creation:**

*   **Input:** Camera feed (RGB-D preferred for depth data), IMU, GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation.
*   **Process:**
    *   Real-time environment mapping using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to create a persistent spatial model.
    *   Object Recognition: Identify key objects within the environment (furniture, doorways, windows, other people).
    *   Notification Anchoring: When a notification arrives, analyze its content and determine the most appropriate anchoring object or spatial location.  Priority is given to objects the user is likely to be interacting with or looking at (using gaze tracking if available). If no suitable object exists, create a virtual anchor point in space.
    *   Bubble Creation: Generate a semi-transparent, dynamically-sized visual "bubble" at the designated anchor point. Bubble color can indicate notification category (e.g., red for urgent, blue for informational).
*   **Output:**  A persistent spatial map with dynamically generated notification bubbles overlaid.

**2. Spatial Audio Delivery:**

*   **Input:** Notification content, spatial map, user head position/orientation (from IMU/camera).
*   **Process:**
    *   3D Audio Engine: Utilize a 3D audio engine (e.g., HRTF-based spatialization) to render the notification audio as if itâ€™s emanating from the location of the visual bubble.
    *   Distance Attenuation:  Adjust audio volume based on the distance between the user and the bubble.
    *   Occlusion Handling: Simulate audio occlusion based on objects in the spatial map.  If a bubble is behind a wall, the audio should be dampened or altered to reflect this.
    *   Priority-Based Mixing: If multiple notifications are active, prioritize audio mixing based on urgency and relevance.
*   **Output:**  Spatialized audio emanating from the location of each active notification bubble.

**3. Dynamic Bubble Behavior:**

*   **Proximity Scaling:**  Bubble size and brightness increase as the user approaches the anchored object or location.
*   **Urgency Modulation:**  Urgent notifications cause the bubble to pulsate or change color more rapidly.
*   **Gaze Integration:** If the user is looking directly at a bubble, it can expand or highlight to draw attention.
*   **Interaction Support:**  Bubbles can be interacted with via hand gestures or voice commands. (e.g., swipe to dismiss, say "read aloud").
*   **Notification Stacking:** Multiple notifications can be stacked within a single bubble, represented by visual cues (e.g., number of items, different colors within the bubble).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Notification Processing):**

```
function processNotification(notification):
  spatialMap = getSpatialMap()
  anchorObject = determineAnchorObject(notification, spatialMap) //Uses content & user context
  if anchorObject == null:
    anchorLocation = createVirtualAnchor(spatialMap)
  else:
    anchorLocation = anchorObject.location

  bubble = createBubble(anchorLocation, notification.type, notification.content)
  bubble.size = baseSize * (1 + distanceToUser(anchorLocation) * scaleFactor)
  bubble.color = getColorForType(notification.type)
  bubble.content = notification.content

  audio = generateSpatialAudio(notification.content, anchorLocation)
  playAudio(audio)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   RGB-D camera (e.g., Intel RealSense, Microsoft Kinect)
*   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
*   Spatial Audio Headset or Multi-Speaker System
*   Powerful Processor for real-time spatial mapping and audio processing

**Potential Applications:**

*   AR/VR interfaces
*   Smart homes/offices
*   Accessibility for visually impaired users
*   Enhanced gaming/entertainment experiences
