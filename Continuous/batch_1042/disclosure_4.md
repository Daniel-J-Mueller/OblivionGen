## Temporal Data Lake Indexing with Probabilistic Structures

**Concept:** Extend the tree-based versioning to support highly parallelized, probabilistic data access for analytical queries, drastically reducing query latency on large datasets. Instead of strict tree traversal for version resolution, introduce bloom filters and sketches alongside each tree node to provide approximate answers *before* committing to a full tree traversal.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Augmented Tree Node:** Each node in the tree (B-tree as described in the patent) will include:
    *   `Data`: Metadata as before.
    *   `Bloom Filter (BF)`:  A Bloom filter representing the range of partition keys (or relevant metadata fields) covered by the subtree rooted at this node.
    *   `Count-Min Sketch (CMS)`: A CMS representing the distribution of values within the partition keys covered by the subtree.  Stores approximate counts of different values.
    *   `Version Timestamp`: The timestamp of the tree version this node belongs to.
*   **Version History Data Structure:** Remains largely the same, but adds a `Bloom Filter Summary` at each version node. This summary represents the union of all Bloom filters at the root nodes of the tree for that version.

**2. Workflow:**

*   **Write Operations (Transaction Commit):**
    1.  Generate a new tree based on the existing tree.
    2.  For each modified node:
        *   Update the `Data`.
        *   Rebuild the `Bloom Filter` and `Count-Min Sketch` based on the new data.
    3.  Update the `Version History Data Structure` with a new version node referencing the new tree root.
    4.  Update the `Bloom Filter Summary` for the version node by merging the bloom filters of all root nodes in the tree.
*   **Query Processing:**
    1.  Receive a query with a time value (or transaction ID).
    2.  Identify the relevant version node in the `Version History Data Structure` based on the time value.
    3.  **Probabilistic Filtering:** Use the `Bloom Filter Summary` associated with the identified version node to quickly determine if the query range *potentially* intersects with the data in that version. If the Bloom filter indicates no intersection, skip the detailed tree traversal.
    4.  **Sketch Evaluation:** If the Bloom filter indicates a potential intersection, use the `Count-Min Sketch` at the root node to estimate the cardinality (number of distinct values) of relevant fields within the query range. This allows the query planner to estimate the cost of accessing the data and choose the optimal execution plan.
    5.  **Tree Traversal (Conditional):** Only traverse the tree if the probabilistic filtering and sketch evaluation suggest that accessing the data is worthwhile. The sketch data informs the tree traversal, guiding the search towards the most promising branches.
    6.  **Data Access:**  If the traversal happens, follow the tree nodes until reaching the relevant data blocks.
    7.  **Result Aggregation:** Aggregate the results from the data blocks and return to the client.

**3. Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```pseudocode
function processQuery(query, timeValue):
  versionNode = getVersionNode(timeValue)
  bloomFilterSummary = versionNode.bloomFilterSummary

  if not bloomFilterSummary.potentiallyMatches(query):
    return emptyResult()

  rootNode = versionNode.treeRoot
  sketch = rootNode.countMinSketch

  estimatedCardinality = sketch.estimateCardinality(query)

  if estimatedCardinality < threshold:
    // Skip detailed traversal - not enough data
    return emptyResult()

  traversalPath = traverseTree(rootNode, query) // Optimized traversal using sketch data
  results = aggregateData(traversalPath)
  return results
```

**4. Implementation Notes:**

*   Bloom filters and Count-Min Sketches can be tuned based on the expected data characteristics and query patterns to balance accuracy and memory usage.
*   Parallelization is crucial for rebuilding Bloom filters and Count-Min Sketches during write operations.
*   The `threshold` in the pseudocode should be dynamically adjusted based on the query cost and system resources.
*   Sketch and bloom filter metadata should be stored alongside the tree structure to enable fast access.
