## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Resource Access Granularity

**Concept:** Expand upon the trusted device concept by introducing a dynamic trust score for each device, coupled with granular resource access control *beyond* simple account lock/unlock. Instead of simply granting or denying access based on a lock state and trusted device flag, the system assesses *how much* access a device receives based on its current trust score.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Calculation:**

*   **Base Score:** Every device starts with a base trust score (e.g., 50).
*   **Positive Signals:**
    *   Successful logins: +5 points.
    *   Biometric authentication: +10 points.
    *   Consistent network location (within a defined radius): +2 points per session.
    *   Device health checks (OS updates, antivirus active): +5 points per check.
*   **Negative Signals:**
    *   Failed login attempts: -10 points.
    *   Sudden location change: -15 points.
    *   Malware detection: -25 points (immediate temporary lockout).
    *   Tampering with device software/hardware (detected via attestation): -50 points (permanent lockout – requires re-provisioning).
*   **Decay:** Trust score decays by 1 point per 24 hours of inactivity.
*   **Thresholds:** Define trust score thresholds for access levels (e.g., 0-30: Denied, 31-60: Limited Access, 61-80: Standard Access, 81-100: Full Access).

**2. Resource Access Granularity:**

*   **Resource Categorization:**  Divide resources into categories with varying sensitivity levels (e.g., Public Info, Personal Data, Financial Transactions, Critical System Controls).
*   **Access Level Mapping:** Associate each resource category with a required minimum trust score.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:** The system dynamically grants access to resources based on the user’s current trust score and the resource category. 
    *   Example: A device with a trust score of 40 might be able to access Public Info but be denied access to Financial Transactions.
    *   Example: If a device has a low trust score, it may be granted access to *view* personal data, but not *modify* it.

**3.  Implementation Details (Pseudocode):**

```
Function GrantAccess(userCredential, deviceIdentifier, resourceCategory)

    deviceTrustScore = GetDeviceTrustScore(deviceIdentifier)
    resourceAccessLevel = GetResourceAccessLevel(resourceCategory)

    If deviceTrustScore < resourceAccessLevel.minimumTrustScore Then
        Return AccessDenied
    End If

    If resourceCategory == FinancialTransactions AND deviceTrustScore < 80 Then
        // Implement additional verification steps (e.g., multi-factor authentication)
        // Or restrict access to view-only
    End If

    If resourceCategory == CriticalSystemControls AND deviceTrustScore < 90 Then
        Return AccessDenied
    End If

    //Access Granted
    Return AccessGranted
End Function
```

**4.  Additional Features:**

*   **Trust Score Visualization:** Provide users with a visual representation of their device's trust score within a dedicated settings panel.
*   **Explainable Trust:** Provide users with details about *why* their trust score is changing (e.g., “Trust score increased due to successful biometric login”).
*   **Trust Score Recovery:**  Allow users to proactively improve their trust score (e.g., by completing security challenges).
*   **Device Attestation Integration:** Integrate with device attestation mechanisms (e.g., Trusted Platform Module) to verify device integrity and trustworthiness.
