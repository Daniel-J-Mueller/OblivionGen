## Adaptive Pre-fetching based on Predicted User Engagement

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive retrieval rate system by *proactively* pre-fetching content fragments based on predicted user engagement with the current stream. This moves beyond simply matching retrieval to playback, and attempts to anticipate future needs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Engagement Prediction Module:**

   *   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data (e.g., seeking, pausing, re-watching, timestamps), content metadata (genre, actors, keywords), historical user viewing patterns, and current stream characteristics (resolution, bitrate).
   *   **Processing:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically an LSTM or GRU – trained on a large dataset of user interaction data. The network predicts a probability distribution over the next *N* fragments (where *N* is configurable – e.g., 5-10).  This distribution represents the likelihood of the user requesting each fragment. The prediction is updated continuously with new interaction data.
   *   **Output:** A prioritized list of fragments, ranked by predicted probability of request.  Each fragment includes a confidence score representing the certainty of the prediction.

**2. Pre-fetch Controller:**

   *   **Input:** Prioritized fragment list from the Engagement Prediction Module, current cache status, available bandwidth, and a configurable pre-fetch buffer size (in seconds of playback).
   *   **Processing:**
        *   Iterate through the prioritized list.
        *   For each fragment:
            *   If the fragment is *not* already in the cache:
                *   If available bandwidth exceeds a minimum threshold *and* the pre-fetch buffer is not full:
                    *   Request the fragment from the origin server using a retrieval rate determined as per the original patent’s specifications (based on playback time and bitrate).
                    *   Store the fragment in the cache.
                    *   Update the pre-fetch buffer occupancy.
                    *   Adjust retrieval rate based on network congestion (prioritize the predicted high engagement content).
        *   Implement a “decay” mechanism for fragments in the prioritized list. Fragments that haven’t been requested within a certain timeframe are removed or re-prioritized.
        *   The pre-fetch controller will maintain a secondary "fallback" system for requesting based on current fragment ID if engagement prediction fails or confidence scores are low.
   *   **Output:** Optimized pre-fetch requests to the origin server.

**3. Cache Management Enhancements:**

   *   Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache eviction policy with a “priority boost” for pre-fetched fragments. This ensures that pre-fetched content isn't prematurely evicted.
   *   Monitor cache hit rates for pre-fetched fragments. This data is used to refine the Engagement Prediction Module’s training process.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Engagement Prediction Module
function predictNextFragments(userInteractionData, contentMetadata, historicalData):
    //Train and run RNN model
    fragmentProbabilities = RNN(userInteractionData, contentMetadata, historicalData)
    prioritizedList = sort(fragmentProbabilities, descending) //Sort by probability
    return prioritizedList

//Pre-fetch Controller
function preFetch(prioritizedList, cacheStatus, availableBandwidth, bufferSize):
    for fragment in prioritizedList:
        if fragment not in cache:
            if availableBandwidth > MIN_BANDWIDTH and bufferSize < MAX_BUFFER_SIZE:
                requestFragment(fragment, retrievalRate)
                storeFragment(fragment, cache)
                updateBufferSize()

//requestFragment function will use existing retrieval logic
//storeFragment will implement cache storage
//updateBufferSize will manage prefetch buffer
```

**Potential Benefits:** Reduced playback interruptions, improved user experience, proactive content delivery, optimized network bandwidth usage, and valuable data for refining content recommendations.
