## Acoustic Mapping & Personalized Soundscapes

**Concept:** Extend the directional echo detection beyond simply indicating reflective surfaces. Create a dynamic acoustic map of the environment and leverage this map to generate personalized soundscapes, optimizing audio output for the user based on room acoustics *and* individual preferences.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Existing multi-microphone array (as described in patent) – critical for beamforming and echo cancellation.
*   **High-Resolution Speaker Array:**  A spherical or hemispherical array of small, individually controllable speakers. Minimum 32 speakers, ideally 64+ for fine-grained control.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** To track head orientation and movement for personalized sound positioning.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance processor capable of real-time acoustic mapping, beamforming, echo cancellation, and spatial audio rendering.
*   **User Interface:** Application for preference setting (soundscape types, EQ, preferred speaker positions, etc.)

**II. Software & Algorithms:**

1.  **Enhanced Acoustic Mapping:**
    *   Utilize the existing echo cancellation filter coefficients *not only* to identify reflective surfaces but also to estimate their *size, material properties (roughness, absorption coefficient), and distance*. This moves beyond simple directional indication to a richer understanding of the acoustic environment.
    *   Employ ray tracing algorithms to simulate sound propagation within the estimated environment.  
    *   Build a 3D point cloud representing the acoustic properties of the room.

2.  **Soundscape Generation:**
    *   Provide pre-set soundscapes (e.g., "Concert Hall", "Quiet Library", "Outdoor Cafe"). Each soundscape modifies audio output through a combination of:
        *   **Convolution Reverb:**  Apply convolution reverb using impulse responses derived from the acoustic map. This simulates the acoustic characteristics of different spaces.
        *   **EQ Profiles:** Apply pre-defined EQ profiles optimized for the soundscape.
        *   **Spatial Audio Rendering:** Utilize head tracking data from the IMU to render audio sources in 3D space, enhancing the sense of immersion.
    *   **Personalized Soundscapes:** Allow users to create custom soundscapes by adjusting reverb parameters, EQ settings, and spatial audio parameters.

3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Continuously update the acoustic map based on real-time microphone data.
    *   Dynamically adjust audio output to compensate for changes in the acoustic environment (e.g., someone entering or leaving the room, repositioning furniture).
    *   Implement a “learning mode” where the system adapts to the user’s preferences over time.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop

while (true) {
    // 1. Data Acquisition
    microphoneData = getMicrophoneData();
    imuData = getIMUData();

    // 2. Acoustic Mapping (Real-time)
    acousticMap = updateAcousticMap(microphoneData, imuData); //Utilize adaptive filter coefficients from AEC
    // acousticMap contains: position, size, material properties of reflective surfaces

    // 3. Soundscape Selection/Creation
    selectedSoundscape = getUserSoundscapePreference();  //Pre-set or custom

    // 4. Audio Rendering
    renderedAudio = renderAudio(audioInput, acousticMap, selectedSoundscape, imuData);

    // 5. Output to Speaker Array
    outputToSpeakerArray(renderedAudio);
}

//Function for rendering Audio
function renderAudio(audioInput, acousticMap, soundscape, imuData){
    //Ray trace the audio input throughout the acoustic map
    rayTracedAudio = rayTrace(audioInput, acousticMap);

    //Apply reverb and EQ based on selected soundscape
    reverberatedAudio = applyReverb(rayTracedAudio, soundscape.reverbParams);
    equalizedAudio = applyEQ(reverberatedAudio, soundscape.eqProfile);

    //Apply spatial audio processing based on imuData and audio source position
    spatializedAudio = spatializeAudio(equalizedAudio, imuData);

    return spatializedAudio;
}
```

**IV. Future Considerations:**

*   **Integration with Smart Home Systems:** Control soundscapes based on room occupancy, time of day, or user activity.
*   **AI-Powered Soundscape Generation:** Use machine learning to automatically generate soundscapes based on user preferences and environmental conditions.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrate haptic feedback to enhance the sense of immersion.
*   **Noise Cancellation/Masking:**  Intelligent sound masking to reduce distracting noises.
