## Dynamic Scan Domain Partitioning with AI-Driven Fault Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the flexible I/O allocation to enable *dynamic* partitioning of the scan domain during testing, driven by real-time AI fault prediction. Instead of pre-defined scan domains, the system learns which core circuitry blocks are most likely to contain faults and focuses scan testing resources on those areas *during* the test sequence.

**Specs:**

*   **AI Fault Prediction Engine:** A trained neural network (potentially a Convolutional Neural Network if block layouts are available) analyzing real-time scan test results (signature analysis, stuck-at fault detection) and historical fault data for the specific chip design. This engine provides a probability score for each core circuitry block indicating the likelihood of containing a fault.
*   **Dynamic Scan Domain Controller:** Hardware logic and software routines that can reconfigure the scan domain boundaries on-the-fly, guided by the AI Fault Prediction Engine. This involves selectively enabling/disabling scan chains for specific blocks.
*   **Fine-Grained Scan Chain Control:**  Each core circuitry block must have individually controllable scan chain enable/disable signals. This necessitates a more granular scan architecture than traditional designs.  Potentially utilize a network-on-chip (NoC) based scan architecture for maximum flexibility.
*   **Scan Chain Reconfiguration Time:** Critical parameter. Reconfiguration must be fast enough to not significantly impact test time. Hardware acceleration is essential. Target: < 100ns reconfiguration time for a large scan domain (e.g., >1000 flip-flops).
*   **Test Pattern Generation (TPG) Integration:** The TPG must be able to generate patterns tailored to the dynamically changing scan domain. Potentially utilize ATPG algorithms that can adapt to domain changes in real-time.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   **Scan Test Controller (STC):**  Manages overall scan test process, interfaces with ATE.
    *   **Dynamic Scan Domain Controller (DSDC):**  Receives fault prediction scores from AI Engine, reconfigures scan chains.
    *   **AI Fault Prediction Engine (AIPE):** Runs on dedicated hardware or software, processes scan results, outputs fault probabilities.
    *   **Fine-Grained Scan Interface (FGSI):** Hardware interface between scan chains and core circuitry blocks, enabling selective enabling/disabling.
*   **Pseudocode (DSDC):**

```
// Initialization
scanDomainMap = initialScanDomainMap; // Predefined initial scan domains
faultPredictionThreshold = 0.7; // Probability threshold for focusing testing

// Main Loop
while (testRunning) {
    // Get fault prediction scores from AIPE
    faultScores = AIPE.getFaultScores();

    // Identify blocks with high fault probability
    highRiskBlocks = [];
    for (block in faultScores) {
        if (faultScores[block] > faultPredictionThreshold) {
            highRiskBlocks.append(block);
        }
    }

    // Reconfigure scan domain
    if (highRiskBlocks.length > 0) {
        newScanDomainMap = createScanDomainFromBlocks(highRiskBlocks);
        reconfigureScanChains(newScanDomainMap);
    } else {
        // Use default scan domain
        reconfigureScanChains(scanDomainMap);
    }

    // Run scan test for current domain
    runScanTest();
}
```

*   **Potential Benefits:**
    *   Reduced test time by focusing on likely fault areas.
    *   Improved fault coverage by dynamically adapting to test results.
    *   Enhanced diagnostic capabilities by isolating faulty blocks more efficiently.
*   **Research Areas:**
    *   AI model selection and training for accurate fault prediction.
    *   Hardware architecture for fast scan chain reconfiguration.
    *   Development of ATPG algorithms that adapt to dynamic scan domains.
