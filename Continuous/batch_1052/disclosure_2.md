## Adaptive Packet Prioritization via Dynamic Header Rewriting

**Concept:** Implement a system where packets, based on observed network conditions and application-level signaling (if available), have their headers *dynamically rewritten* to influence routing decisions *beyond* traditional QoS markings. This goes beyond simply prioritizing; it actively shapes traffic flows by subtly altering perceived destination or cost.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Module: Adaptive Header Engine (AHE)**

*   **Input:** Packet stream, Network Condition Monitor (NCM) data, Application Signaling Interface (ASI) data.
*   **Output:** Modified packet stream.
*   **Core Components:**
    *   **Policy Decision Unit (PDU):** Configurable rules engine. Rules are based on NCM data (latency, loss, bandwidth), ASI data (application priority, urgency), and potentially packet content inspection (limited to header fields).
    *   **Header Rewrite Module (HRM):** Capable of modifying both MPLS labels *and* IP header fields (destination IP/port, DSCP, TTL).  Must support insertion/deletion of MPLS labels.  Hardware acceleration critical.
    *   **Virtual Router Table (VRT):** A shadow copy of the main routing table, used for temporary routing overrides.  VRT entries have TTLs to prevent indefinite routing loops.
    *   **Statistics Engine (SE):** Collects data on header modifications, routing changes, and network performance.

**2. Software API & Configuration**

*   **Policy Definition Language (PDL):**  A declarative language for defining traffic shaping policies. Example:

    ```pdL
    POLICY "Urgent Video" {
        CONDITION (APPLICATION == "VideoConference" AND URGENCY == "High")
        ACTION {
            REWRITE_MPLS_LABEL (0, "HighPriorityLabel"); //Replace MPLS label 0 with specific label
            MODIFY_IP_DSCP (EF); //Set DSCP to Expedited Forwarding
            INCREMENT_TTL (1); //Increase TTL by 1 to promote forwarding
        }
    }
    POLICY "Congestion Avoidance" {
        CONDITION (LINK_UTILIZATION > 80% AND DESTINATION_SUBNET == "CriticalDataCenter")
        ACTION {
            REWRITE_MPLS_LABEL (0, "LowPriorityLabel"); //Lower Priority
            MODIFY_IP_TTL (TTL - 2); //Reduce TTL to discourage long paths
            //Optionally add a temporary "detour" MPLS label for alternative route
        }
    }
    ```
*   **API Functions:**
    *   `policy_add(policy_definition)`: Adds a new policy.
    *   `policy_remove(policy_name)`: Removes a policy.
    *   `get_statistics(policy_name)`: Retrieves statistics for a policy.

**3. Operational Flow**

1.  Packet arrives at AHE.
2.  PDU evaluates applicable policies based on NCM data, ASI data, and packet header fields.
3.  If a policy matches, HRM modifies the packet header according to the policy rules. This might include:
    *   Changing the MPLS label to influence LSPs.
    *   Modifying the destination IP/port to steer traffic to less congested paths (potentially with dynamic DNS updates).
    *   Adjusting DSCP values for QoS.
    *   Modifying TTL to control packet lifetime.
4.  Modified packet is forwarded to the next hop.
5.  SE collects statistics on policy execution and network performance.

**4. Novel Aspects**

*   **Dynamic Routing Influence:** Goes beyond QoS by actively shaping routing decisions *within* the network.
*   **Application Awareness:**  Leverages application-level signaling for more intelligent traffic shaping.
*   **Adaptive Behavior:**  Reacts to changing network conditions in real-time.
*   **Policy-Driven:** Allows network operators to define flexible traffic shaping rules.
