## Adaptive Question Difficulty & Reward System

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust question difficulty and worker reward based on real-time performance metrics, creating a more efficient and engaging crowdsourcing experience. This builds on the patent's use of crowdsourcing but optimizes the human input loop.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Difficulty Assessment Module:**
    *   Input: Worker answer, question features (complexity, ambiguity, data characteristics).
    *   Process: Employs a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model to estimate worker skill level and question difficulty. BKT assigns probabilities to 'mastery' and 'guessing' based on answer history.
    *   Output:  Difficulty score for the question *and* a skill estimate for the worker.
*   **Reward Allocation Engine:**
    *   Input:  Difficulty score, worker skill estimate, answer accuracy, task completion time.
    *   Process: Calculates reward using a formula factoring in all inputs.  Higher difficulty & faster/accurate completion = higher reward. Skill estimate modulates the reward â€“ less skilled workers receive a slight boost for effort, more skilled workers are rewarded more heavily for efficiency.
    *   Output: Reward amount for the completed task.
*   **Question Pool Manager:**
    *   Input:  Question features, difficulty scores, worker performance data.
    *   Process: Dynamically selects questions for each worker based on their skill level. Questions are prioritized that provide the greatest information gain (i.e., are most likely to refine the skill estimate). Introduces questions of increasing difficulty as worker skill improves.
    *   Output:  A prioritized queue of questions for each worker.
*   **Data Logging & Analytics:**
    *   Logs all data related to question difficulty, worker performance, reward allocation, and question selection.
    *   Provides analytics dashboards to monitor system performance and identify areas for optimization.

**II. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// For each worker:
workerSkill = initialSkillEstimate  //e.g., 0.5

// For each question:
questionDifficulty = initialDifficultyEstimate // e.g., 0.5

// Question Selection:
selectedQuestion = QuestionPoolManager.selectQuestion(workerSkill, questionDifficulty)

// Worker receives question and submits answer

// Difficulty Assessment:
answerAccuracy = evaluateAnswer(submittedAnswer, correctAnswer)
newWorkerSkill = DifficultyAssessmentModule.updateSkill(workerSkill, answerAccuracy, selectedQuestion.complexity)
newQuestionDifficulty = DifficultyAssessmentModule.updateDifficulty(questionDifficulty, answerAccuracy)

// Reward Calculation:
rewardAmount = RewardAllocationEngine.calculateReward(newQuestionDifficulty, newWorkerSkill, answerAccuracy, taskCompletionTime)

// Update Question Pool:
QuestionPoolManager.updateQuestionDifficulty(selectedQuestion, newQuestionDifficulty)

// Log data for analytics
```

**III.  Implementation Details:**

*   **BKT Parameters:**  Tuning of BKT learning and guessing rates is critical.  Employ a reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically adjust these parameters based on system performance.
*   **Reward Function:** Experiment with different reward function formulations to optimize worker engagement and data quality.  Consider incorporating bonuses for completing multiple tasks in a row.
*   **Question Complexity:**  Develop metrics for quantifying question complexity, considering factors like data volume, feature interactions, and required reasoning steps.
*   **UI/UX:** Provide workers with clear feedback on their performance and reward earnings. Implement a gamified interface to enhance engagement.
*   **Data Anonymization:**  Ensure that all data used for analysis is anonymized to protect worker privacy.
