## Portable Environmental Data Beacon with Ephemeral Storage

**Concept:** A small, ruggedized device designed for remote environmental data collection (temperature, humidity, pressure, radiation, etc.) that prioritizes data security through a combination of capacitor-backed volatile storage *and* physical self-destruction triggered by environmental factors or time. 

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Roughly 3cm x 3cm x 1cm, sealed, impact-resistant polymer casing. Multiple mounting options (adhesive, screw mount, zip tie).
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M4.
*   **Sensors:** Integrated suite: Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Geiger-Müller tube (radiation detection), optional: accelerometer/gyroscope. Sensor selection configurable via software.
*   **Volatile Memory:** 8MB SRAM.  Utilized for all raw sensor data storage.
*   **Non-Volatile Memory:** 64KB Flash memory. Stores configuration parameters, device ID, calibration data, and a minimal bootloader.
*   **Capacitor:** Supercapacitor (5F, 3.7V).  Charged via inductive coupling or a limited-function USB-C port (charging only – no data transfer).  Powers SRAM retention *and* a self-destruction mechanism.
*   **Self-Destruction Mechanism:** Micro-pyro fuse or micro-explosive charge strategically placed to physically damage the SRAM and microcontroller. Activated based on a combination of factors:
    *   **Capacitor Discharge:** When the supercapacitor reaches a critically low voltage, indicating prolonged inactivity or tampering.
    *   **Time-Based Trigger:**  A pre-programmed lifespan.  The device is designed for a specific deployment duration.
    *   **Environmental Trigger:**  Tamper detection (acceleration/gyroscope identifying forced entry or movement) or exposure to specific environmental conditions (excessive temperature, pressure, or radiation).
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Used for initial configuration and data retrieval *before* the self-destruct sequence is initiated. BLE communication ceases *before* the self-destruct sequence.
*   **Power Management:** Highly optimized low-power sleep modes.  Sensors sampled at configurable intervals.  Periodic BLE advertising for data retrieval.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Deployment:** Device is placed in a remote location.
2.  **Data Collection:** Sensors sample data at specified intervals and store it in SRAM.
3.  **Configuration/Retrieval (Optional):**  A user can configure the device (sampling rate, lifespan, environmental triggers) and/or retrieve collected data via BLE before the self-destruct sequence is initiated.
4.  **Self-Destruct Trigger:** One or more of the following triggers the self-destruct sequence:
    *   Supercapacitor voltage drops below a threshold.
    *   Pre-programmed lifespan expires.
    *   Tamper detection is activated.
    *   Environmental conditions exceed pre-defined limits.
5.  **Self-Destruct Sequence:**
    *   The microcontroller initiates a controlled discharge of the supercapacitor into the micro-pyro fuse or micro-explosive charge.
    *   The fuse/charge physically damages the SRAM and microcontroller, rendering the stored data unrecoverable.

**Pseudocode (Self-Destruct Sequence):**

```
function selfDestruct() {
  disableAllPeripherals();
  setPyrofuseEnablePin(HIGH); // Enable the pyrofuse
  dischargeSupercapacitor();
  while(supercapacitorVoltage > criticalVoltage) {
    // Wait for supercapacitor to discharge
  }
  // SRAM and microcontroller damaged.
}

function dischargeSupercapacitor() {
  enableDischargePin(HIGH);
}
```

**Rationale:** This design addresses the need for secure environmental data collection in sensitive areas. The combination of capacitor-backed volatile storage and physical self-destruction ensures that the data remains confidential even if the device is compromised. The device’s low power consumption and ruggedized construction make it suitable for long-term deployment in harsh environments. The BLE communication allows for initial configuration and data retrieval before the self-destruct sequence is initiated.
