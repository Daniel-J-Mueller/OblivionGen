## Electrowetting Acoustic Lens

**Concept:** Utilize the electrowetting principle to dynamically control the shape of a fluid lens, creating an acoustic lens capable of focusing or steering sound waves. This goes beyond visual display and ventures into active acoustics – potentially for focused audio, non-destructive testing, or medical imaging.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Material:** Same layered structure as the base patent (Inorganic/Organic layers), but optimized for acoustic impedance rather than dielectric properties. The inorganic layer will be a high-density material (Tungsten, Barium Titanate) and the organic layer a carefully chosen polymer with low acoustic loss.
*   **Fluid:** A conductive, non-volatile fluid with a carefully tuned acoustic impedance. Ideally, this would be a ferrofluid with controlled particle alignment using the electric field.
*   **Array Architecture:** A 2D array of individually addressable electrowetting cells. Each cell forms a segment of the acoustic lens.
*   **Electrode Material:** Transparent Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) patterned on a flexible substrate.
*   **Acoustic Backing:** A sound-absorbing material behind the array to minimize reflections.
*   **Control System:** A microcontroller capable of driving the individual electrodes and managing the array’s shape.

**Detailed Functionality:**

1.  **Base State:** All electrodes are at a uniform voltage. The conductive fluid forms a flat, uniform surface. Sound waves pass through relatively unimpeded.
2.  **Lens Formation:** By selectively applying voltage to specific electrodes, the surface tension of the fluid is altered. This causes localized deformation of the fluid surface, forming a convex or concave lens shape. The degree of deformation is proportional to the applied voltage.
3.  **Steering:** By dynamically adjusting the voltage pattern across the array, the focal point of the acoustic lens can be moved in two dimensions, steering the sound beam.
4.  **Focusing/Defocusing:** Varying the voltage across the entire array will alter the curvature of the lens, adjusting the focal length and focusing or defocusing the sound.

**Pseudocode for Control System:**

```
// Array Dimensions
int arrayWidth = 64;
int arrayHeight = 64;

// Voltage Map - stores voltage for each cell
float voltageMap[arrayWidth][arrayHeight];

// Function to calculate desired lens shape (example: parabolic)
float calculateVoltage(int x, int y, float focalLength) {
    // Calculate distance from center of array
    float distance = sqrt(pow(x - arrayWidth/2, 2) + pow(y - arrayHeight/2, 2));

    // Calculate voltage based on distance and focal length
    float voltage = 1.0 / (1.0 + (distance - focalLength));

    return voltage;
}

// Main Control Loop
void loop() {
    // Get desired focal length from user input/sensor data
    float focalLength = 5.0;

    // Iterate through each cell in the array
    for (int y = 0; y < arrayHeight; y++) {
        for (int x = 0; x < arrayWidth; x++) {
            // Calculate voltage for this cell
            voltageMap[x][y] = calculateVoltage(x, y, focalLength);

            // Set voltage on corresponding electrode
            setElectrodeVoltage(x, y, voltageMap[x][y]);
        }
    }

    // Delay for stability
    delay(10);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Focused Audio:** Creating directional audio speakers that minimize sound leakage.
*   **Non-Destructive Testing:** Precise ultrasonic imaging for detecting flaws in materials.
*   **Medical Imaging:** High-resolution focused ultrasound for diagnostic imaging or targeted drug delivery.
*   **Underwater Communication:** Directional acoustic beams for underwater communication systems.
