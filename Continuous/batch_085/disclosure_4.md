## Dynamic Calibration & Multi-Spectral Analysis System

**Concept:** Extend the existing dimensional scanning system with dynamic calibration using structured light and integrate multi-spectral imaging to determine item material composition concurrently with dimensioning.

**Specifications:**

*   **Structured Light Projector:** Integrate a miniature, high-resolution projector capable of emitting structured light patterns (e.g., sinusoidal fringes, checkerboards) onto the gap area, perpendicular to the light emitting array. The projector must be dynamically adjustable in angle and intensity.
*   **Multi-Spectral Camera Array:**  Replace or supplement existing cameras with a multi-spectral camera array (visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared). These cameras should capture images synchronized with the structured light projection and the dimensioning light arrays. Cameras should be high framerate.
*   **Calibration Procedure:**
    1.  Prior to scanning, project a known calibration pattern (e.g., a grid of precisely measured points) through the gap.
    2.  Capture the projected pattern using the multi-spectral cameras.
    3.  Use image processing algorithms to determine any distortions or misalignments in the system (due to temperature changes, vibration, or mechanical drift).
    4.  Generate a calibration matrix to correct for these distortions in real-time during item scanning.
*   **Material Identification Module:**
    1.  Analyze the multi-spectral images of the item passing through the gap.
    2.  Utilize machine learning algorithms (trained on a database of material spectral signatures) to identify the itemâ€™s material composition (e.g., plastic type, cardboard grade, metal alloy).
    3.  Output material identification data alongside dimensional measurements.
*   **Data Fusion & Processing:**
    *   Develop a software module to fuse dimensional data (from light interruption/structured light) and material identification data into a unified data stream.
    *   Implement algorithms to compensate for material properties in dimensional measurements (e.g., thermal expansion/contraction).
*   **Hardware Integration:**
    *   Mount the structured light projector and multi-spectral camera array securely to the existing conveyor system frame.
    *   Provide power and data connections for all new components.
    *   Ensure the system is shielded to minimize interference.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   Modular design for easy maintenance and updates.
    *   API for integration with existing warehouse management systems.
    *   User-friendly interface for system configuration and data visualization.
