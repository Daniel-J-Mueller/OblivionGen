## Dynamic Key Sharding with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the key rotation concept by *sharding* the encryption key across multiple HSMs, with each shard valid only for a limited time. This creates a significantly more robust system against compromise, as an attacker would need to compromise multiple HSMs *within* their respective time windows to decrypt data. Furthermore, the temporal decay introduces a degree of automatic remediation â€“ compromised shards become irrelevant after their time window expires.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Generation & Sharding:**

*   **Master Key:** Generate a high-entropy master key within a secure key management system. This key *never* leaves the KMS.
*   **Shard Count:**  Define the number of key shards (e.g., 5, 10).  The higher the shard count, the greater the security, but also the greater the overhead.
*   **Shard Generation:**  Derive key shards from the master key using a robust key derivation function (KDF) like HKDF-SHA512.  Each shard is unique.
*   **Shard Distribution:** Distribute each shard to a separate HSM.  HSMs *must* be physically and logically isolated.
*   **Shard Validity Windows:** Assign a unique, non-overlapping validity window (e.g., 1 hour, 12 hours, 24 hours) to each shard. The window determines how long the shard is considered valid for decryption.
*   **Shard Metadata:** Each shard is accompanied by metadata containing: shard ID, validity start time, validity end time, and a checksum for integrity verification.

**2. Encryption Process:**

*   **Data Segmentation:** Divide the data to be encrypted into segments.
*   **Shard Selection:** For each data segment, dynamically select a set of *active* shards (shards whose validity window includes the current time). The number of shards selected can be configurable.  A minimum threshold of shards is required for encryption to proceed.
*   **Segment Encryption:** Encrypt each data segment using a symmetric key, derived from the combined active shards using a cryptographic function (e.g., a threshold secret sharing scheme).  The symmetric key is used for AES or similar symmetric encryption.
*   **Metadata Storage:** Store the encrypted data segment alongside metadata indicating which shards were used for encryption.

**3. Decryption Process:**

*   **Data Retrieval:** Retrieve the encrypted data segment and the associated shard metadata.
*   **HSM Coordination:**  Initiate a decryption operation by contacting the HSMs corresponding to the shards used for encryption.
*   **Partial Decryption:** Each HSM decrypts its portion of the symmetric key based on its shard.
*   **Key Reconstruction:** The decrypted portions of the symmetric key are securely combined to reconstruct the full symmetric key.
*   **Data Decryption:** The reconstructed symmetric key is used to decrypt the data segment.

**4. Key Rotation & Shard Renewal:**

*   **Automatic Renewal:**  As each shard's validity window approaches its end, a new shard is generated from the master key and distributed to the corresponding HSM, replacing the expiring shard.  This process is automated and continuous.
*   **Revocation:** If a shard is compromised, a revocation signal is sent to all HSMs, rendering the shard unusable.  New shards are generated and distributed to replace revoked shards.
*   **Master Key Rotation:** Periodically rotate the master key, and re-derive all shards from the new master key. This provides an additional layer of security.

**Pseudocode (Decryption):**

```
function decryptData(encryptedData, shardMetadataList) {
  partialKeys = []
  for each shardMetadata in shardMetadataList {
    HSM = getHSM(shardMetadata.HSM_ID)
    partialKey = HSM.decryptPartialKey(shardMetadata.shardID, shardMetadata.shardChecksum)
    partialKeys.append(partialKey)
  }

  symmetricKey = reconstructSymmetricKey(partialKeys) // Using a threshold secret sharing scheme

  cleartext = decryptDataWithSymmetricKey(encryptedData, symmetricKey)
  return cleartext
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated HSMs are *required*.
*   Secure, high-bandwidth communication channels between the application server and HSMs.
*   Tamper-resistant hardware.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased security against compromise.
*   Automated remediation of compromised shards.
*   Fine-grained access control.
*   Enhanced scalability.
