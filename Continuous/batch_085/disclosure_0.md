## Adaptive Annotation Difficulty & Gamification

**Concept:** Expand on the annotation system to dynamically adjust the difficulty of annotation tasks based on user skill and incorporate gamification elements to incentivize high-quality contributions and diverse perspectives.

**Specs:**

*   **User Skill Profiling:**
    *   Each user maintains a hidden skill profile based on annotation history.
    *   Metrics: accuracy (consensus with other annotations/ground truth), annotation detail (length, complexity of language), speed, and diversity of annotation types (factual corrections, thematic suggestions, stylistic edits).
    *   Skill levels: Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner, Expert, Master.
*   **Dynamic Annotation Assignment:**
    *   The system assigns annotation tasks based on user skill level and content complexity.
    *   Novices receive simpler, more focused tasks (e.g., identifying typos).
    *   Experts receive more complex tasks (e.g., evaluating thematic consistency, identifying subtle factual inaccuracies).
    *   Content is tagged with a difficulty score.  Matching algorithms prioritize assignments.
*   **Gamification System:**
    *   **Points/Experience:** Users earn points/experience for completing tasks.  Points are weighted by task difficulty and annotation quality.
    *   **Badges/Achievements:** Users unlock badges/achievements for specific milestones (e.g., "Fact Checker," "Style Guru," "Thematic Analyst").
    *   **Leaderboards:** Optional leaderboards displaying top annotators (with privacy controls).
    *   **Reputation System:** Annotators gain reputation based on peer review and consensus. Higher reputation unlocks access to more challenging/rewarding tasks.
    *   **Virtual Currency/Rewards:** Earn virtual currency that can be redeemed for digital rewards (e.g., early access to content, virtual items, discounts).
*   **Peer Review Mechanism:**
    *   Annotations are periodically reviewed by other annotators.
    *   Reviewers evaluate accuracy, clarity, and helpfulness.
    *   Review scores influence annotator reputation and task assignment.
*   **Annotation "Bounties":**
    *   Content creators can offer "bounties" for annotations on specific passages or issues.
    *   Bounties incentivize high-quality contributions and attract skilled annotators.
*   **AI-Assisted Annotation Quality Control:**
    *   AI models analyze annotations for consistency, accuracy, and potential bias.
    *   AI flags suspicious annotations for human review.

**Pseudocode (Annotation Assignment Algorithm):**

```
function assignAnnotationTask(user, content):
  userSkill = getUserSkillProfile(user)
  contentDifficulty = getContentDifficulty(content)

  # Calculate a "match score" based on skill and difficulty
  matchScore = abs(userSkill - contentDifficulty) * weightingFactor

  # Prioritize tasks with the best match score
  # (potentially combined with other factors like user preferences and task availability)
  sortedTasks = sortTasksByMatchScore(availableTasks)

  assignedTask = sortedTasks[0] # Select the highest-scoring task

  return assignedTask
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserSkillProfile`: {skillLevel: string, accuracy: float, detail: float, speed: float, diversity: float}
*   `ContentDifficulty`: {complexity: float, factuality: float, style: float}
*   `Annotation`: {userID: string, contentID: string, passage: string, type: string, comment: string, qualityScore: float}
