## Personalized "Content Fatigue" Buffering

**Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust content delivery frequency and variety based on predicted user “content fatigue” – a state where a user becomes less responsive to advertising or promotional content due to overexposure. This goes beyond simple frequency capping; it actively models user engagement *rate* and adapts accordingly.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User Identifier (as per the existing patent)
    *   Impression History: Records of all content impressions served to the user.
    *   Engagement Signals:  Click-through rates, dwell time, video completion rates, scroll depth (to assess content consumption), explicit feedback (likes/dislikes/skips).
    *   Content Metadata: Tags describing the content type, brand, product category, creative style.
    *   Time-Series Data: Capture engagement over time to model patterns.
*   **Fatigue Model:**
    *   A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, an LSTM – is used to predict future engagement rates. The RNN is trained on historical impression and engagement data.
    *   The LSTM considers the sequence of content presented, the time intervals between impressions, and user response.
    *   Output of the LSTM: A predicted "Fatigue Score" (0-1) indicating the likelihood of continued engagement. A higher score means less fatigue.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism:**
    *   **Impression Scheduling:** The system calculates an optimal time interval between impressions based on the Fatigue Score.  Lower scores trigger longer delays.
    *   **Content Diversification:**  Based on content metadata, the system identifies content categories that have been presented frequently to the user. The system prioritizes content from under-represented categories to increase variety.  This is done via a weighted random selection algorithm.
    *   **Creative Rotation:**  If multiple creative variations exist for the same product, the system dynamically rotates creatives, prioritizing those that have not been shown recently.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ScheduleNextImpression(userID)
    GET impressionHistory FROM database WHERE userID = userID
    GET engagementData FROM database WHERE userID = userID
    
    // Predict Fatigue Score
    fatigueScore = LSTM.predict(impressionHistory, engagementData)
    
    // Calculate optimal time interval
    timeInterval = baseInterval * (1 / fatigueScore) // Adjust base interval based on fatigue
    
    // Determine eligible content
    eligibleContent = GET content WHERE userID is eligible
    
    // Prioritize content based on frequency & variety
    weightedContent = calculateWeightedContent(eligibleContent, userID)
    
    selectedContent = selectContent(weightedContent)
    
    RETURN selectedContent, timeInterval
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateWeightedContent(contentList, userID)
    FOR each content in contentList
        frequencyScore = calculateFrequencyScore(content, userID)
        varietyScore = calculateVarietyScore(content, userID)
        weight = (1 - frequencyScore) * varietyScore // Higher weight for less frequent & diverse content
        content.weight = weight
    END FOR
    RETURN contentList
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateFrequencyScore(content, userID)
    // Calculate the proportion of recent impressions that have been for this content category
    // Example: Number of impressions for this category in the last 7 days / Total impressions in the last 7 days
    frequency = 0.0
    // logic to calculate frequency
    RETURN frequency
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateVarietyScore(content, userID)
    // Calculate the proportion of content categories the user has *not* seen
    // Example: Number of unseen categories / Total number of categories
    variety = 0.0
    // logic to calculate variety
    RETURN variety
END FUNCTION

```

*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   The LSTM model should be regularly retrained with fresh data to maintain accuracy.
    *   The system should be scalable to handle a large number of users and impressions.
    *   A/B testing should be conducted to optimize the parameters of the fatigue model and adjustment mechanisms.
    *   Privacy implications of data collection and model training should be carefully considered.
