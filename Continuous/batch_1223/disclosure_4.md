## Acoustic Scene Completion

**Concept:** Extend acoustic event detection beyond simple identification to *completion* â€“ inferring the likely continuation of an acoustic scene, even with limited input. This moves beyond "what is happening" to "what will likely happen next", providing a more robust and contextual understanding of the audio environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Feature vector representing a short audio frame (e.g., 100ms).
*   **Core Component: Scene Graph Generator:**
    *   Utilizes a pre-trained scene graph representing common acoustic environments (home, office, street, etc.). Nodes represent acoustic events (speech, music, car horn, dog bark), and edges represent co-occurrence probabilities and temporal relationships. This graph is NOT static; it learns and adapts based on incoming audio data.
    *   Input feature vector is used to activate relevant nodes in the scene graph. Activation strength is proportional to the likelihood of that event occurring in the current frame.
*   **Prediction Network:**
    *   A recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, is trained on a massive dataset of labeled acoustic scenes.
    *   Input: Activated scene graph nodes from the Scene Graph Generator, along with the history of previously predicted events.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over possible next events. This isn't just "car horn," but potentially "car horn *followed by* engine revving," or "speech *followed by* laughter."
*   **Multi-Modal Fusion (Optional):** Integrate visual data (from a camera) to refine the scene graph and prediction. For example, seeing a kitchen visually strengthens the likelihood of "cooking sounds" in the prediction.
*   **Output:** A sequence of predicted acoustic events, along with confidence scores.  This can be represented as a time-series prediction of event probabilities.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_acoustic_scene(feature_vector, scene_graph, prediction_network, history):
  # Activate relevant nodes in the scene graph based on the feature vector
  activated_graph = activate_scene_graph(feature_vector, scene_graph)

  # Combine activated graph with prediction history
  combined_input = concatenate(activated_graph, history)

  # Predict next events using the RNN
  predicted_probabilities = prediction_network.predict(combined_input)

  # Update prediction history with the most likely event
  next_event = argmax(predicted_probabilities)
  updated_history = append(history, next_event)

  return predicted_probabilities, updated_history
```

**Refinement & Novelty:**

This differs from the referenced patent by moving *beyond* detection of individual events to anticipating sequences of events. It's not just about identifying a "dog bark," but about predicting the potential for "dog barking *followed by* a door opening." The dynamic scene graph and sequential prediction network are key innovations, allowing for richer contextual understanding and proactive responses to the audio environment. Applications include improved smart home automation, predictive security systems, and enhanced virtual/augmented reality experiences. The integration with visual data adds another layer of robustness and accuracy.
