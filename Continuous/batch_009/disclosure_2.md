## Adaptive Notification Prioritization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the notification override system to incorporate real-time biofeedback from the user to dynamically adjust notification priority and presentation – going beyond simply allowing/blocking, to modulating *how* a notification is delivered.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Integration:** Requires a wearable device (smartwatch, fitness tracker, dedicated sensor) capable of capturing physiological data: heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance (GSR), and potentially brainwave activity (EEG - optional, higher complexity).
*   **Data Pipeline:**
    *   Wearable streams physiological data to a central processing unit (smartphone, server).
    *   Real-time analysis of biofeedback data to determine user’s stress level, cognitive load, and attention state.  Employ algorithms (e.g., time-domain HRV analysis, GSR peak detection, EEG band power analysis) to quantify these states.
    *   Data is normalized and fed into a machine learning model.
*   **ML Model:**  A personalized model trained to map biofeedback data to optimal notification parameters. Parameters include:
    *   **Notification Type:** (Visual, Audible, Haptic) – prioritizes modalities less disruptive to current state.
    *   **Presentation Style:**  (e.g., Subtle glow vs. full-screen alert, soft chime vs. loud ringtone, gentle vibration vs. strong pulse).
    *   **Content Summarization Level:** (Full message, short preview, icon only).
    *   **Delay/Batching:**  Notifications can be delayed or batched together if the user is under high cognitive load.
*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The existing notification override logic (DND settings, emergency contacts) remains functional.  The biofeedback system acts as an additional layer of modulation *on top* of these rules.
    *   The system must seamlessly integrate with the communications network system to modify notification delivery in real-time.
*   **User Profiles & Learning:**  The ML model learns user preferences over time. Users can also provide explicit feedback on notification delivery (e.g., "too disruptive," "helpful," "ignore for now").
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  All biofeedback data is processed locally on the device whenever possible. Only anonymized and aggregated data is sent to the server for model training.  Users have full control over data sharing settings.

**Pseudocode (Notification Processing Flow):**

```
function processNotification(notificationData):
    userAccount = getAssociatedUserAccount(notificationData)
    deviceProfile = getDeviceProfile(userAccount)
    dndSetting = getDNDSetting(deviceProfile)

    if dndSetting == enabled AND notificationType != emergency:
        return blockNotification()

    biofeedbackData = getBiofeedbackData(userAccount)
    userState = analyzeBiofeedbackData(biofeedbackData)

    optimalParameters = determineOptimalNotificationParameters(userState)

    modifyNotification(notificationData, optimalParameters)

    sendNotification(notificationData)
```

**Expansion Points:**

*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Integrate location data, calendar events, and app usage to further refine notification prioritization.
*   **Gamification:**  Reward users for maintaining focus and minimizing distractions.
*   **Cross-Device Synchronization:**  Synchronize biofeedback data and notification preferences across multiple devices.
*   **Emotional Tone Detection:**  Analyze the emotional tone of the notification content (e.g., using NLP) and adjust delivery accordingly.
