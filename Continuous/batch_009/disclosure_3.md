## Dynamic Payload Mutation for Chaos Engineering

**Concept:** Extend the data-driven testing framework to actively *mutate* payloads sent to the service under test, not just replay existing data. This facilitates more robust chaos engineering and fault injection testing beyond simply increasing load.

**Specs:**

1.  **Mutation Profile Definition:** Introduce a “Mutation Profile” – a JSON or YAML configuration file defining allowed payload alterations.  This profile is discovered via runtime annotations (similar to existing data source identification) within the transaction creator module. 
    *   `field_name`: Name of the field to mutate.
    *   `mutation_type`:  Type of mutation:
        *   `random_string`: Replace with a random string of specified length.
        *   `random_integer`: Replace with a random integer within a specified range.
        *   `flip_bits`:  Flip a specified number of bits in a numeric field.
        *   `delete_field`: Remove the field entirely.
        *   `swap_fields`: Swap the value of this field with another specified field.
        *   `gaussian_noise`: Add Gaussian noise to a numeric field.
    *   `mutation_probability`: Probability of this mutation being applied to this field during a given transaction.
    *   `mutation_range`:  Applicable for numeric mutations. Defines the range of allowed values.
    *   `mutation_length`:  Applicable for string mutations. Defines the length of the new string.

2.  **Mutation Engine Integration:** Modify the transaction generation framework to include a “Mutation Engine”.  This engine intercepts outgoing payloads *before* they are sent to the service.

3.  **Payload Interception & Mutation:**
    *   For each transaction, the Mutation Engine:
        *   Reads the Mutation Profile associated with the transaction (discovered via runtime annotations).
        *   Iterates through the fields of the payload.
        *   For each field, it determines if a mutation should be applied based on the `mutation_probability`.
        *   If a mutation is triggered, it applies the specified `mutation_type` to the field.

4.  **Transaction Creator Module Adaptation:**
    *   The transaction creator module exposes a method to retrieve the Mutation Profile associated with a given transaction type.
    *   Runtime annotations within the transaction creator module link transaction types to specific Mutation Profiles.

5.  **Data Source Integration (Optional):**  Allow Mutation Profiles to reference data sources (e.g., a list of invalid strings, boundary values) to enhance mutation realism.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateTestTransaction(transactionType, loadStepInfo) {
  mutationProfile = getMutationProfileForTransactionType(transactionType)
  payload = buildPayloadForTransactionType(transactionType, loadStepInfo)
  mutatedPayload = applyMutations(payload, mutationProfile)
  sendPayloadToService(mutatedPayload)
}

function applyMutations(payload, mutationProfile) {
  for each field in payload {
    if (random() < mutationProfile.field[field].mutation_probability) {
      mutationType = mutationProfile.field[field].mutation_type
      switch (mutationType) {
        case "random_string":
          payload.field = generateRandomString(mutationProfile.field[field].mutation_length)
          break
        case "random_integer":
          payload.field = generateRandomInteger(mutationProfile.field[field].mutation_range)
          break
        // ... other mutation types ...
      }
    }
  }
  return payload
}
```

**Rationale:** This system goes beyond simple data replay by introducing controlled payload corruption.  This can uncover vulnerabilities and resilience issues not exposed by standard load testing, simulating real-world error conditions or malicious inputs. The annotations-driven approach allows for easy configuration and adaptation of mutation strategies without code changes.
