## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Frame

**Concept:** Extend the composite frame concept to incorporate localized haptic feedback directly into the device’s structure. This goes beyond simple vibration and allows for nuanced tactile sensations across the device’s edges.

**Specs:**

*   **Frame Material:** Utilize the existing metal/glass-impregnated plastic composite, but integrate micro-actuators within the metal portion, specifically within the areas forming the device’s grip.
*   **Actuator Type:** Piezoelectric actuators – chosen for their small size, fast response time, and ability to generate localized deformation.  Arrayed densely along the sides of the metal frame.
*   **Power/Control:**  Thin-film flexible circuits embedded *within* the metal frame to power and control the actuators.  These circuits connect to the device’s main processor via a dedicated interface.  Interface will support variable frequency/amplitude control of each actuator.
*   **Software Integration:** SDK provided to app developers to access the haptic engine.  Functions include:
    *   `hapticWave(side, frequency, amplitude, duration)`: Generates a travelling wave sensation along a specified side of the device.
    *   `hapticPulse(location, intensity, duration)`: Triggers a localized pulse at a specific point along the frame.  `location` defined as a percentage along the side (0-100).
    *   `hapticTexture(side, texture_id)`: Applies a pre-defined texture pattern to a side of the device using sequenced actuator activation.
*   **Integration with existing features:**
    *   Volume control: Haptic feedback increases as volume is raised.
    *   Notification cues: Unique haptic patterns for different app notifications.
    *   Gaming:  Immersive haptic feedback for game events.

**Pseudocode (Notification Handling):**

```
function handleNotification(notificationType, intensity) {
  switch (notificationType) {
    case "EMAIL":
      // Activate a short pulse on the top and bottom sides
      triggerHapticPulse("top", intensity * 0.5, 0.1);
      triggerHapticPulse("bottom", intensity * 0.5, 0.1);
      break;
    case "SMS":
      // Create a travelling wave on the left side
      createHapticWave("left", 2Hz, intensity * 0.8, 0.5);
      break;
    case "CALL":
      // Pulsing haptic pattern on both sides
      loop {
        triggerHapticPulse("left", intensity * 1.0, 0.1);
        triggerHapticPulse("right", intensity * 1.0, 0.1);
        delay(0.3);
      }
      break;
  }
}
```

**Manufacturing Notes:**

*   Actuators will be embedded during the metal frame casting process using precision molds.
*   Flexible circuits will be laminated onto the inside of the metal frame.
*   Extensive testing required to ensure actuator reliability and durability.
*   Design for modularity – allow for future actuator upgrades and customization.
