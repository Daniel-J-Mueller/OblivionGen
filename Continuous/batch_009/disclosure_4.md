## Virtual Network 'Shadowing' & Predictive Cost Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand the existing cost-aware routing to include 'shadowing' of network traffic across multiple virtual network configurations *simultaneously*. This allows for predictive cost analysis and proactive adjustment of routing before performance degradation occurs. It’s like having a ‘flight simulator’ for network traffic.

**Specs:**

1.  **Virtual Network Duplication Module:**
    *   Function: Creates near real-time replicas of the active virtual network configuration. These 'shadow' networks operate with a reduced scale (e.g., 10-20% of live traffic) for resource efficiency.
    *   Input: Live network configuration data (topology, routing tables, cost assignments).
    *   Output: Identical virtual network instances operating in parallel.

2.  **Traffic Mirroring Engine:**
    *   Function: Selectively mirrors a portion of live network traffic to the shadow networks.  This is done on a per-flow basis, prioritizing critical applications.
    *   Input: Live network traffic, application prioritization rules.
    *   Output: Mirrored traffic streams directed to shadow networks.

3.  **Cost Prediction Algorithm:**
    *   Function: Runs the mirrored traffic through the shadow networks with *hypothetical* cost adjustments. This allows simulation of future network conditions (e.g., increased bandwidth costs, link failures).
    *   Input: Mirrored traffic, shadow network configurations, hypothetical cost changes.
    *   Output: Predicted network performance metrics (latency, throughput, cost) for each hypothetical cost scenario.  A 'cost curve' is generated representing performance vs. cost.

4.  **Proactive Routing Adjustment Module:**
    *   Function: Based on the cost prediction algorithm’s output, automatically adjusts routing rules in the *live* network to optimize performance and cost.
    *   Input: Cost prediction data, current network state, service level agreements (SLAs).
    *   Output: Updated routing tables and cost assignments for the live network.

5.  **Dynamic Shadow Scaling:**
    *   Function: Adjusts the scale of the shadow networks based on network load and the accuracy of the cost predictions. Higher load/lower accuracy = larger shadow networks.
    *   Input: Network load, cost prediction error rate, resource availability.
    *   Output: Adjusted shadow network scale (percentage of live traffic mirrored).

**Pseudocode (Proactive Routing Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjust_routing(predicted_costs, current_network_state, sla_requirements) {

  // 1. Identify critical paths based on current network state & SLA
  critical_paths = identify_critical_paths(current_network_state, sla_requirements);

  // 2. For each critical path, evaluate cost-performance tradeoff in predicted_costs
  for each path in critical_paths {
    best_route = find_best_route(path, predicted_costs); //Considers cost AND performance
    
    // 3. If a better route exists (based on a defined threshold)
    if (best_route != current_route) {
      update_routing_table(best_route);
    }
  }

  // 4. Implement failover/rollback procedures
  implement_failover_rollback();

  return updated_routing_table;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers to host shadow networks.
*   Software-defined networking (SDN) controller with API access.
*   Network monitoring and analytics tools.
*   Machine learning algorithms for cost prediction.
