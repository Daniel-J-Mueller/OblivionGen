## Adaptive Spectrum Allocation via Distributed AI Agents

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Mesh network nodes (as described in the patent) augmented with a dedicated, low-power AI accelerator (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU, NVIDIA Jetson Nano) per node. Each node retains existing WWAN/WLAN radios. Nodes also equipped with a software-defined radio (SDR) capable of receiving/analyzing a broad spectrum (500 MHz – 6 GHz).
*   **Software:** Distributed AI agent software stack. Each node runs an independent agent. Centralized orchestration layer (cloud-based, optional) for initial model deployment and aggregation of learning.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Mesh network utilizes existing 802.11/802.11ax standards for primary data communication. A secondary, low-bandwidth communication channel (e.g., BLE, Zigbee) for agent coordination and spectrum data exchange.

**Innovation Description:**

The core concept is a dynamic, distributed spectrum allocation system driven by AI agents residing on each mesh network node. These agents analyze the RF environment using the SDR, identify unused or underutilized spectrum bands, and collaboratively adjust node transmit frequencies to optimize overall network performance. This goes beyond simple channel selection; it’s about *proactive* spectrum management.

**Operational Flow (Pseudocode):**

```
// Per-Node Agent Loop

while (true) {
  // 1. Spectrum Sensing
  spectrumData = SDR.scanSpectrum(startFrequency, endFrequency, resolution);

  // 2. Interference Analysis
  interferenceLevel = analyzeInterference(spectrumData);

  // 3. Channel Quality Estimation
  channelQuality = estimateChannelQuality(interferenceLevel, signalStrength);

  // 4. Predictive Modeling
  predictedCongestion = predictFutureCongestion(historicalData, currentConditions);

  // 5. Cooperative Decision Making (using a distributed consensus algorithm - e.g., Raft or Paxos)
  // Each node broadcasts its spectrum data and congestion predictions
  broadcastData(spectrumData, congestionPredictions);

  // Receive data from neighboring nodes
  receivedData = receiveData();

  // Aggregate data from neighbors to create a 'global' spectrum map
  globalSpectrumMap = aggregateData(receivedData);

  // Run a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Network) to determine optimal frequency assignment
  optimalFrequency = reinforcementLearningAgent.selectFrequency(globalSpectrumMap);

  // 6. Frequency Adjustment
  radio.setFrequency(optimalFrequency);

  // 7. Performance Monitoring
  monitorPerformance(throughput, latency, packetLoss);
}
```
