## Secure Biometric Authentication Overlay

**Concept:** Expand the dual-display authentication concept by layering biometric data onto the token display *during* one-time password generation, creating a continuously verified authentication session. This moves beyond static OTPs to a dynamic, biometric-anchored system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Primary Display: Standard high-resolution display for general UI & OTP input prompt.
    *   Token Display: Smaller, transparent OLED display overlaid *directly* onto the primary display, positioned to cover the area where OTP input occurs.  Must support rendering of alphanumeric characters *and* real-time biometric data visualization.
    *   Biometric Sensor: Integrated, low-power fingerprint or vein pattern sensor located *beneath* the token display, making direct contact with the user’s finger during OTP input. Alternatively, utilize an under-display optical sensor for fingerprint/vein mapping.
    *   Secure Element: Dedicated hardware security module (HSM) integrated into the second circuitry, responsible for biometric template storage, matching, and OTP generation.
    *   Processing: Separate processing core for biometric data analysis within the secure element, ensuring isolation from the main processor.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   OTP Generation: Standard TOTP/HOTP algorithm implementation within the Secure Element.
    *   Biometric Enrollment:  User enrollment process to capture and store biometric templates within the Secure Element.
    *   Real-time Biometric Matching:  Continuous comparison of live biometric data (from the sensor) against the stored template *during* OTP generation. A confidence score is calculated and transmitted to the OTP generation algorithm.
    *   Dynamic OTP Adjustment: The generated OTP is adjusted based on the biometric confidence score. A higher score results in a longer, more complex OTP. A lower score prompts a re-scan or a simpler OTP.
    *   Visual Feedback: The token display visualizes biometric data during scanning. This could include a heat map, vein pattern visualization, or a simple "match/no match" indicator. The visual feedback is tied to the confidence score. A successful scan causes the token display to ‘fill’ with a recognizable pattern.
    *   Encryption: All communication between the biometric sensor, secure element, and token display is encrypted.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Enrollment Phase
function enrollBiometric() {
    captureBiometricData();
    createBiometricTemplate();
    storeTemplateInSecureElement();
}

// Authentication Phase
function authenticate() {
    displayOTPInputPrompt();
    startBiometricScanning();

    while (OTP not entered) {
        liveBiometricData = captureBiometricData();
        confidenceScore = matchBiometricData(liveBiometricData, storedTemplate);

        if (confidenceScore > threshold) {
            // Proceed with OTP Generation
            otp = generateOTP(confidenceScore); // OTP Complexity tied to score
            displayOTPOnPrimaryDisplay();
            displayBiometricVisualizationOnTokenDisplay(confidenceScore);
        } else {
            // Request re-scan
            displayRescanPromptOnTokenDisplay();
        }
    }

    // Verify OTP entered by user
}

function generateOTP(confidenceScore) {
    // TOTP/HOTP Algorithm
    // Adjust OTP length/complexity based on confidenceScore
    // Higher score = longer/more complex OTP
}
```

*   **Power:** Separate power supply to the second circuitry, with a dedicated battery for increased security and reliability.

**Potential Use Cases:** High-security applications, mobile banking, access control, and any scenario requiring strong authentication.
