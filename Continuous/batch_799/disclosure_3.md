## Adaptive Chromatic Emission Bulb

**Core Concept:** A light bulb capable of dynamically shifting its emitted color spectrum based on ambient environmental data and user-defined parameters, going beyond simple white temperature adjustment.

**Specs:**

*   **Bulb Form Factor:**  Maintain a standard Edison screw base (E26) for compatibility.  Physical dimensions will be slightly larger than a standard A19 bulb (~80mm diameter, 150mm length) to accommodate internal components.
*   **Emission Source:** Utilize a multi-chip LED array.  Individual LEDs will encompass a broad spectrum, including Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.  Each chip will have independent dimming control.  Phosphor coatings will be minimized to allow for greater spectral control.
*   **Sensory Input:**
    *   **Ambient Light Sensor:**  A high-resolution spectral sensor integrated into the bulb housing will analyze the color temperature *and* specific wavelengths of surrounding light.
    *   **Audio Sensor:** A miniature microphone will detect ambient sounds.
    *   **Temperature Sensor:** Internal and external temperature monitoring.
    *   **Humidity Sensor:** Integrated humidity detection.
*   **Processing Unit:** A low-power embedded processor (ARM Cortex-M7 or equivalent) will be responsible for:
    *   Data acquisition from sensors.
    *   Execution of algorithms to determine optimal color emission.
    *   Communication via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for user control and data logging.
*   **Algorithms & Modes:**
    *   **Environmental Mimicry:** Analyze ambient light and attempt to *match* the color profile of the surrounding environment. Useful for blending artificial light into natural settings.
    *   **Mood/Activity Presets:** User-selectable modes (e.g., “Relax,” “Focus,” “Energize,” “Party”) that trigger pre-defined color palettes and dynamic color shifts.
    *   **Biometric Synchronization (Optional):**  If paired with a wearable device (smartwatch, fitness tracker), the bulb can adjust its color temperature and spectrum to align with the user’s circadian rhythm or current physiological state (heart rate, stress levels).
    *   **Sound Reactive Mode:** The bulb’s color will shift and pulse in response to ambient sounds.  Algorithm will differentiate between speech, music, and other sounds.
    *   **Data Logging:**  Store sensor data (ambient light, sound, temperature, humidity) locally or transmit it to a cloud-based platform for analysis.
*   **Power Supply:** Standard 120V AC input, converted to appropriate DC voltages for LEDs and processor.
*   **Housing:**  Durable, heat-resistant polycarbonate with a semi-transparent finish to allow for some diffusion of light.

**Pseudocode (Color Algorithm - Environmental Mimicry):**

```
// Function: AdjustBulbColor(ambientLightSpectrum[])
// Input: Array of wavelength/intensity values representing ambient light
// Output: LED control signals (R,G,B,C,M,Y intensities)

// 1. Normalize Ambient Spectrum
normalizedSpectrum = Normalize(ambientLightSpectrum);

// 2. Calculate Target RGBCMY values
targetR = Sum(normalizedSpectrum[RedRange]);
targetG = Sum(normalizedSpectrum[GreenRange]);
targetB = Sum(normalizedSpectrum[BlueRange]);
targetC = Sum(normalizedSpectrum[CyanRange]);
targetM = Sum(normalizedSpectrum[MagentaRange]);
targetY = Sum(normalizedSpectrum[YellowRange]);

// 3.  Apply Gamma Correction & Color Temperature Adjustment
gammaCorrectedR = ApplyGamma(targetR);
gammaCorrectedG = ApplyGamma(targetG);
gammaCorrectedB = ApplyGamma(targetB);

// 4.  Output LED Control Signals
SetLEDIntensity(R, gammaCorrectedR);
SetLEDIntensity(G, gammaCorrectedG);
SetLEDIntensity(B, gammaCorrectedB);
SetLEDIntensity(C, targetC);
SetLEDIntensity(M, targetM);
SetLEDIntensity(Y, targetY);

```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   Integration with smart home ecosystems (e.g., Alexa, Google Home).
*   Advanced AI algorithms for personalized color recommendations.
*   Development of custom phosphor coatings to enhance spectral control.
*   Directional lighting control using micro-lens arrays.
