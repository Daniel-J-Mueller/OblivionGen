## Adaptive Relationship Weighting for Dynamic Classifiers

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple duplicate/variation detection to model *degrees* of relationship between documents, and dynamically adjust classifier weighting based on evolving relationship landscapes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Relationship Graph Construction:**

*   **Input:** Document corpus, initial duplicate/variation data (as in the provided patent).
*   **Process:** Create a weighted, directed graph representing document relationships.
    *   Nodes: Documents in the corpus.
    *   Edges: Relationships between documents (duplicate, variation, related topic, cited by, etc.).
    *   Weights:  Initially assigned based on provided data, then dynamically adjusted (see section 3).  Weight scale: 0.0 (no relationship) to 1.0 (strong relationship). Initial weights derived from manual decision data.
*   **Output:**  Relationship graph data structure.

**2. Feature Vector Expansion:**

*   **Input:** Documents in the corpus, relationship graph.
*   **Process:**  Augment standard document feature vectors (TF-IDF, embeddings, etc.) with *relationship features*.
    *   **Neighborhood Influence:** For each document, calculate the average relationship weight of its immediate neighbors in the graph.
    *   **Centrality Measures:** Incorporate graph centrality measures (degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality) as features.  These capture a document’s importance within the relationship network.
    *   **Relationship Type Distribution:**  Encode the distribution of relationship types connected to a document (e.g., 30% duplicate, 50% variation, 20% related topic).
*   **Output:**  Expanded feature vectors for each document.

**3. Dynamic Weighting & Classifier Ensemble:**

*   **Input:** Training documents, expanded feature vectors, relationship graph, initial ensemble of classifiers (e.g., duplicate detector, variation detector, topic classifier).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Relationship-Driven Weighting:**  Adjust the weights of individual classifiers in the ensemble based on the relationships between documents.
        *   If a training document has a strong 'duplicate' relationship with another document, increase the weight of the duplicate detector for that document.
        *   If a document has a strong 'variation' relationship, increase the weight of the variation detector.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning for Weight Optimization:** Utilize a reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal weighting strategies.
        *   **State:** Current document’s feature vector, relationship graph neighborhood.
        *   **Action:** Adjust weights of individual classifiers.
        *   **Reward:** Based on classifier accuracy and the strength of the relationships between documents.
*   **Output:** Weighted ensemble of classifiers.

**4. Continuous Learning & Graph Refinement:**

*   **Input:** New documents, classifier predictions, user feedback (if available).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Graph Update:**  Add new documents to the relationship graph.
    *   **Relationship Inference:**  Infer new relationships between documents based on classifier predictions and user feedback.
    *   **Weight Adjustment:** Continuously refine classifier weights using reinforcement learning and user feedback.
*   **Output:** Updated relationship graph and weighted ensemble of classifiers.

**Pseudocode (Weight Adjustment - Simplified):**

```
function adjust_weights(document, relationship_graph, classifier_weights):
  relationship_type = determine_dominant_relationship(document, relationship_graph) #e.g., "duplicate", "variation", "topic"

  if relationship_type == "duplicate":
    classifier_weights["duplicate_detector"] += 0.1
    classifier_weights["variation_detector"] -= 0.05
  elif relationship_type == "variation":
    classifier_weights["variation_detector"] += 0.1
    classifier_weights["duplicate_detector"] -= 0.05
  # ... other relationship types

  # Normalize weights to sum to 1.0

  return classifier_weights
```

This system allows for a more nuanced understanding of document relationships, adapting to evolving landscapes and improving classifier accuracy over time. The use of a relationship graph and dynamic weighting provides a flexible and robust framework for managing complex document corpora.
