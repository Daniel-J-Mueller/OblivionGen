## Dynamic Algorithm Composition via Predictive Entropy

**Concept:** Extend algorithm hopping beyond simply *switching* between pre-defined algorithms to dynamically *composing* new algorithms on-the-fly based on real-time entropy analysis of data streams. This isn't about choosing A or B, but building C from pieces of A and B, or even introducing entirely new components.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Algorithm Component Library:** A repository of cryptographic *components* (S-boxes, permutations, hashing functions, etc.) instead of entire algorithms. Each component is tagged with properties: computational cost, entropy contribution, vulnerability profile, and supported data types. This is a modular system.

2.  **Entropy Monitoring Module:** Continuously analyze incoming data streams to determine local entropy levels.  Different data types (image, text, financial transactions) may necessitate different entropy calculation methods.

3.  **Predictive Entropy Engine:**  Uses a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM network) trained on historical entropy data to *predict* future entropy levels.  This allows preemptive algorithm adaptation *before* security degrades.  Training data is continuously updated.

4.  **Composition Engine:**
    *   Takes predicted entropy as input.
    *   Based on entropy level, selects a set of cryptographic components from the library.
    *   Combines components into a custom algorithm.  Combination rules are flexible (e.g., sequential application, parallel execution, feedback loops).
    *   A 'fitness function' evaluates potential compositions based on security, performance, and resource constraints. Genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning can optimize composition rules.

5.  **Real-Time Compilation/Execution:** The composed algorithm is dynamically compiled (or interpreted) and executed.  Just-in-time (JIT) compilation optimizes performance.  Hardware acceleration (e.g., FPGAs) further improves speed.

6.  **Adaptive Trust Model:**  The system maintains a trust score for each component and composition.  Components with known vulnerabilities receive lower scores.  Compositions are tested against known attack vectors.  The trust model informs component selection and composition rules.

**Pseudocode (Composition Engine):**

```
function composeAlgorithm(predictedEntropy, currentTrustModel):
  componentPool = filterComponents(trustModel) // Remove low-trust components
  candidateComponents = selectComponents(componentPool, predictedEntropy) // Select based on entropy & component properties

  bestComposition = geneticAlgorithm(candidateComponents, fitnessFunction)

  // fitnessFunction considers:
  //   - Security strength (based on component properties)
  //   - Performance (computational cost)
  //   - Resource usage

  compiledAlgorithm = compile(bestComposition)
  return compiledAlgorithm
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Component`: {name, properties (cost, entropyContribution, vulnerabilityProfile), dataTypes}
*   `Composition`: {algorithmName, components[], connectionRules}

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Federated Learning:**  Share component properties and trust scores across a network of devices to improve overall security.
*   **Quantum-Resistant Components:** Include quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives in the component library.
*   **AI-Driven Vulnerability Detection:** Use machine learning to identify vulnerabilities in composed algorithms.
