## Spatial Audio Beacon Network

**Concept:** Establish a localized spatial audio network using the loudspeaker devices themselves as beacons, creating a dynamic, user-defined “sweet spot” for immersive audio regardless of listener position or room acoustics. This expands upon the relative positioning established in the patent to create a truly adaptive and personalized sound field.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Additions (per Loudspeaker Device):**

*   **Directional Microphone Array:**  Beyond the existing microphones, each loudspeaker receives a small array (3-5 microphones) enabling more precise localization of sound sources (user speech, ambient noise).
*   **Ultrasonic Transducers:** Each loudspeaker device is equipped with an ultrasonic transducer capable of emitting and receiving coded signals.  These operate outside the range of human hearing.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** A 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) tracks loudspeaker device orientation and movement.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Beacon Emission Module:**  Each loudspeaker periodically emits a unique ultrasonic “beacon” signal. The signal includes:
    *   Loudspeaker ID
    *   IMU data (orientation, subtle movement)
    *   Current audio channel assignment (e.g., "Front Left", "Surround Right")
*   **Time-of-Flight (ToF) Calculation Module:** Listener device (smartphone, dedicated receiver, integrated headset) receives beacon signals. The ToF between each beacon and the listener is calculated using the ultrasonic signals.
*   **Spatial Mapping Module:** The listener device constructs a 3D map of loudspeaker positions based on ToF and beacon ID. IMU data from loudspeakers helps refine this map in real-time.
*   **Adaptive Beamforming Module:** Based on the spatial map, the audio system adjusts the beamforming parameters of each loudspeaker.
    *   The goal is to create a focused audio "sweet spot" around the listener’s head.
    *   Audio is directed towards the listener, minimizing reflections and maximizing clarity.
*   **Dynamic Sweet Spot Adjustment:** Listener movement is tracked (using listener device sensors). The adaptive beamforming parameters are updated in real-time to maintain the sweet spot.
*   **User Override:** Listener can manually adjust beamforming parameters (e.g., widen the sweet spot for group listening).

**3. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Network Initialization:** When the audio system is powered on, each loudspeaker begins emitting ultrasonic beacons.
2.  **Spatial Map Creation:** The listener device receives beacons and constructs a 3D map of the loudspeaker network.
3.  **Listener Tracking:** Listener device tracks listener head position in 3D space.
4.  **Beamforming Adjustment:** The adaptive beamforming module adjusts the output of each loudspeaker to create a focused audio sweet spot around the listener’s head.
5.  **Dynamic Adaptation:** Listener movement triggers continuous adjustments to the beamforming parameters, maintaining the sweet spot.

**4. Pseudocode (Adaptive Beamforming Module):**

```
function adjustBeamforming(listenerPosition, loudspeakerPositions, audioChannels):
  for each loudspeaker in loudspeakerPositions:
    directionVector = normalize(listenerPosition - loudspeaker.position)
    phaseShift = dotProduct(directionVector, loudspeaker.forwardVector) // Calculate phase shift based on direction
    amplitudeScale = calculateAmplitudeScale(directionVector) // Adjust amplitude for optimal coverage

    // Apply phase shift and amplitude scale to the assigned audio channel signal
    loudspeaker.playChannel(audioChannels[loudspeaker.channelIndex], phaseShift, amplitudeScale)
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   The ultrasonic signals require careful frequency selection to minimize interference and ensure accurate ToF measurements.
*   Advanced signal processing techniques (e.g., Kalman filtering) can be used to smooth the spatial map and improve the accuracy of listener tracking.
*   This system could be integrated with room acoustic modeling to further optimize the beamforming parameters and create a truly immersive audio experience.
*   Integration with voice control enables a hands-free experience. “Widen the sweet spot” or “Focus on the center channel” commands could be implemented.
