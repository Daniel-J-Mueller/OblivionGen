## Dynamic Action Context via Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Expand the system to incorporate data streams from multiple sensors *beyond* audio, including, but not limited to: accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, camera (low resolution, for gesture/object detection only). This creates a “dynamic action context” which dramatically improves action eligibility determination and user intent prediction.

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, and low-resolution camera into devices interacting with the system.
*   **Edge Processing:** Implement lightweight sensor data processing on the device itself to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
*   **Secure Data Transmission:** Encrypt all sensor data transmitted to the central processing unit.

**III. Software Components:**

*   **Sensor Data Aggregator:** Software component responsible for collecting data from all sensors.
*   **Contextual Feature Extractor:** Extracts relevant features from sensor data streams (e.g., device orientation, movement speed, ambient light level, proximity to objects, detected gestures).
*   **Contextual Feature Vector:** Combines extracted features into a single vector representing the current dynamic action context.
*   **Context-Aware Eligibility Engine:** Modifies the existing eligibility engine to incorporate the contextual feature vector. Eligibility rules are now based on a combination of user input, device type, and dynamic action context.
*   **Adaptive Learning Module:** Continuously learns the relationships between dynamic action context, user input, and successful actions. This allows the system to improve its accuracy over time.

**IV. Pseudocode – Context-Aware Eligibility Engine:**

```
function determine_eligibility(user_input, device_type, context_vector):
  // 1. Retrieve base eligibility rules for device type
  base_rules = get_base_rules(device_type)

  // 2. Apply contextual modifiers
  modified_rules = apply_contextual_modifiers(base_rules, context_vector)

  // 3. Evaluate user input against modified rules
  eligibility_score = evaluate_input(user_input, modified_rules)

  // 4. Determine eligibility based on score
  if eligibility_score > threshold:
    return true
  else:
    return false

function apply_contextual_modifiers(base_rules, context_vector):
  // Iterate through base_rules
  for each rule in base_rules:
    // Check if the rule has contextual dependencies
    if rule.has_contextual_dependency:
      // Evaluate the contextual dependency using the context_vector
      context_match = evaluate_context(rule.context, context_vector)
      // Modify the rule's parameters based on context_match
      rule.modify_parameters(context_match)
    // Return the modified rule set
  return modified_rules

function evaluate_context(context_specification, context_vector):
  // Extract relevant features from the context_vector
  features = extract_features(context_vector, context_specification.required_features)
  // Compare features to the context_specification
  if features match context_specification.criteria:
    return true
  else:
    return false
```

**V. Example Use Cases:**

*   **"Do Not Disturb" Mode:** If the device detects it is face down on a surface (accelerometer/gyroscope) and the ambient light is low, the system automatically assumes the user is sleeping and silences notifications.
*   **Contextual Reminders:** If the device detects proximity to a specific object (e.g., coffee machine) and the time matches a scheduled reminder, the system activates the reminder.
*   **Adaptive Voice Control:** If the device detects the user is exercising (accelerometer/gyroscope) and speaking loudly, the system adjusts the voice recognition sensitivity accordingly.
*   **Smart Home Automation:** Detecting a user entering a room (proximity sensor combined with voice command) could automatically adjust lighting and temperature settings.
