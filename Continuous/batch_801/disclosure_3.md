## Dynamic Masking with Predictive Obfuscation

**Concept:** Expand upon the selective screen obscuration by adding predictive masking based on user input *before* it’s fully rendered on the screen. This moves beyond simply hiding sensitive data *after* it appears, creating a layered security approach.

**Specs:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

1.  **Input Stream Interception:** A system service intercepts the input stream (keyboard, mouse clicks, touch events) *before* it’s processed by the application.
2.  **Contextual Analysis:** Using a combination of pre-trained models and runtime analysis, the system determines the *likely* type of input field.  This goes beyond simple field type identification (password, text) to include probable data formats (credit card number, social security number, email address).
3.  **Pre-emptive Masking:**  Based on the contextual analysis, the system *immediately* applies a dynamic masking overlay to the relevant portion of the screen *before* the input is rendered. This overlay isn’t simply a black rectangle; it's a visually indicative placeholder—dots, dashes, or blurred shapes—that signify a secure input area.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  As the user types, the masking dynamically adjusts to reflect the input length and potentially the data type (e.g., different masking for a credit card number vs. a password).
5.  **Agent View:**  The remote agent sees the masked input area in real-time. The masking visually indicates that sensitive data is being entered but *prevents* the agent from viewing the actual input.

**II. Technical Details:**

1.  **Input Interception Module:**
    *   Operating System Level Hook: Kernel-mode driver or system-level hook to intercept input events.
    *   API Hooking: Intercepting relevant API calls (e.g., `WM_CHAR`, `WM_KEYDOWN`) used for input processing.
2.  **Contextual Analysis Engine:**
    *   Machine Learning Models: Trained on large datasets of input fields and their corresponding data types.
    *   Heuristic Rules: Rule-based system to complement the ML models and handle edge cases.
    *   Runtime Analysis: Monitoring the application's behavior to infer the input field's purpose.
3.  **Masking Overlay System:**
    *   Framebuffer Manipulation: Direct manipulation of the framebuffer to draw the masking overlay.
    *   Graphics API Interception: Intercepting graphics API calls to modify the rendering pipeline.
    *   Hardware Acceleration: Leveraging GPU acceleration for efficient rendering of the masking overlay.

**III. Pseudocode (Masking Application)**

```pseudocode
// Input Interception Module
On InputEvent(event) {
  fieldType = ContextualAnalysis(event.target, event.data);

  If (fieldType == "Sensitive") {
    CreateMaskingOverlay(event.target, event.data);
    RenderMaskingOverlay();
  }
}

//Contextual Analysis Engine
Function ContextualAnalysis(target, data) {
    //Check ML Models
    prediction = MLModel.Predict(target, data);
    //Check Heuristics
    heuristicsResult = Heuristics.Evaluate(target,data);

    if (prediction == "Sensitive" or heuristicsResult == "Sensitive"){
        return "Sensitive";
    }
    else {
        return "Not Sensitive";
    }
}

//Masking Overlay System
Function CreateMaskingOverlay(target, data){
    //Determine masking pattern based on data type (password, credit card, etc.)
    pattern = DetermineMaskingPattern(data);

    //Create overlay with the specified pattern and dimensions
    overlay = CreateOverlay(pattern, target.width, target.height);

    //Apply overlay to the framebuffer
    ApplyOverlay(overlay, target);
}
```

**IV. Agent Side Considerations**

*   The agent view should indicate that masking is active.
*   A 'masking indicator' light would be beneficial.
*   The agent might need a command to temporarily *reduce* masking (e.g., to confirm a field is being filled correctly) – this requires explicit user consent.
