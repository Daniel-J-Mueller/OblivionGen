## Adaptive Storage Mirroring with Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Extend the lease/status mechanism from the source patent to create a continuously mirrored storage volume with predictive failover capabilities. Instead of simply migrating, constantly replicate the storage, but with a dynamic weighting system determining which location (source or target) services read *and* write requests. This allows for a 'soft' migration – applications experience minimal disruption.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Replication Manager:** Runs on both source and target compute nodes. Responsible for block-level data replication. Uses a checksum/delta-encoding scheme for efficient transfer.
*   **Component 2: Health Monitor:** Continuously monitors health metrics (CPU, Memory, Network, Disk I/O) on both source and target nodes.  Also probes application responsiveness (simple HTTP GET requests to representative application endpoints).
*   **Component 3: Weighting Engine:** Calculates a ‘health weight’ for each node (source and target). Health weight is a composite score based on Health Monitor data.  Weights are normalized to sum to 100.
*   **Component 4: I/O Interceptor:**  Sits in front of the block storage device and intercepts all read and write requests.  Routes requests to either the source or target based on the current weights.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Setup:** Replication begins, copying the entire storage volume to the target node.
2.  **Continuous Replication:** The Replication Manager keeps the target volume synchronized with the source.
3.  **Weight Calculation:** The Health Monitor collects data, and the Weighting Engine calculates weights for each node. Initially, the source node will have a weight close to 100, and the target close to 0.
4.  **I/O Routing:** The I/O Interceptor intercepts requests:
    *   **Read Requests:** With probability equal to the target node’s weight, read from the target. Otherwise, read from the source.
    *   **Write Requests:**  Writes are *always* performed on both the source *and* the target simultaneously. This ensures consistency.
5.  **Predictive Failover:** If the Health Monitor detects a degrading health score on the source node, the Weighting Engine increases the target node’s weight. This shifts more read traffic to the target, reducing load on the source.
6.  **Automatic Failover:** If the source node fails (or falls below a critical health threshold), the Weighting Engine sets the target node’s weight to 100. All traffic is now served from the target.
7.  **Failback (Optional):** When the source node recovers, the system can gradually shift traffic back to the source, mirroring the failover process.  This may involve a period of dual-writes to ensure data consistency.

**Pseudocode (Weighting Engine):**

```
function calculate_weights(source_health, target_health):
  // Normalize health scores (0-100)
  normalized_source_health = map(source_health, 0, 100, 0, 100)
  normalized_target_health = map(target_health, 0, 100, 0, 100)

  // Apply weighting factors (adjust these based on testing)
  source_weight = normalized_source_health * 0.6
  target_weight = normalized_target_health * 0.4

  // Normalize weights to sum to 100
  total_weight = source_weight + target_weight
  source_weight = (source_weight / total_weight) * 100
  target_weight = (target_weight / total_weight) * 100

  return source_weight, target_weight
```

**Key Differences from Original Patent:**

*   **Continuous Replication:** The original patent focuses on a one-time migration. This concept involves constant data mirroring.
*   **Dynamic I/O Routing:** The system dynamically routes read and write requests based on node health, reducing downtime and improving application responsiveness.
*   **Proactive Failover:** Instead of waiting for a failure, the system proactively shifts traffic to the target node based on health predictions.
*   **Granular Control:**  Weighting factors allow fine-tuning of the failover behavior.
