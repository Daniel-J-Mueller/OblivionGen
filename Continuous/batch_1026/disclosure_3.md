## Dynamic Attestation via Hardware-Rooted "Shadow Memory"

**Concept:** Extend the context-dependent memory access security concept to not just *hide* memory, but to dynamically *attest* to the integrity of the more-privileged component's management data *before* allowing access, even within the permitted subset. This goes beyond preventing out-of-context access, and introduces a proactive integrity check.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Memory Region:** Designate a dedicated, hardware-protected region of physical memory ("Shadow Memory") associated with each less-privileged component's management data subset. The size of this Shadow Memory is configurable, possibly proportional to the size of the management data subset.

2.  **Cryptographic Hash Chain:**  The more-privileged component calculates a cryptographic hash of the initial management data for a less-privileged component. This hash is stored in the Shadow Memory region.  Every subsequent modification to the management data *must* be accompanied by recalculation of the hash, and storage of the *new* hash (potentially a chained hash for efficiency).

3.  **Attestation Logic in Address Translation:** Modify the address translation circuitry. Before granting access to any byte within the permitted management data subset, the circuitry:

    *   Reads the current hash from Shadow Memory.
    *   Calculates a hash of the *currently accessed* data block (e.g., a cache line).
    *   Compares the calculated hash with the stored hash.
    *   If the hashes match, access is granted. If they do not match, a hardware fault is triggered (similar to a translation fault, but specifically indicating data integrity failure).

4.  **Secure Hash Algorithm:**  Specify a hardware-accelerated, cryptographically secure hash algorithm (e.g., SHA-256, or a lightweight variant). The algorithm's key (if any) must be securely managed by the hardware.

5.  **Configuration Registers:** Add registers for:
    *   Enabling/Disabling Shadow Memory attestation per less-privileged component.
    *   Setting the size of the Shadow Memory region.
    *   Selecting the hash algorithm.
    *   Storing a key (if required by the selected algorithm).

6.  **Interrupt/Exception Handling:** Define a hardware interrupt/exception to be triggered upon hash mismatch. This allows the more-privileged component to handle the integrity failure (e.g., terminate the less-privileged component, log the event).

**Pseudocode (Address Translation Circuitry Modification):**

```
function translate_address(virtual_address, access_type):
  // Existing address translation logic...

  if (context_dependent_security_enabled):
    if (virtual_address within management_data_subset):
      // Check Shadow Memory
      shadow_memory_address = calculate_shadow_memory_address(virtual_address)
      stored_hash = read_memory(shadow_memory_address)
      accessed_data = read_memory(virtual_address)
      calculated_hash = hash(accessed_data)

      if (calculated_hash != stored_hash):
        raise integrity_failure_exception(virtual_address)

  // Continue with normal physical address translation
  return physical_address
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Integrity Protection:**  Detects tampering with management data *before* it can be used to compromise the system.
*   **Hardware-Rooted Trust:** Relies on hardware for integrity verification, making it more resistant to software attacks.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:**  Attestation can be enabled/disabled per less-privileged component.
*   **Scalability:** The system can be scaled by adjusting the size of the Shadow Memory regions.
