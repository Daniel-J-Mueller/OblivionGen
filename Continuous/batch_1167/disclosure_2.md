## Dynamic Schema-Based Access Control with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the identifier-based access control to incorporate a temporal decay mechanism, coupled with a dynamic schema generation system, to create self-expiring, contextually-relevant access permissions.  This moves beyond simple request denial to *adaptive* permissions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Permission Generator:**  Responsible for dynamically generating schemas based on user role, resource type, and time-to-live (TTL).
*   **Identifier Factory:** Creates unique identifiers (IDs) containing encoded schema fragments, TTL values, and a cryptographic signature.
*   **Request Interceptor:**  Examines incoming requests, extracts identifiers, validates signatures, and checks TTL.
*   **Schema Repository:** Stores base schemas and schema fragments used by the Permission Generator.
*   **Temporal Decay Engine:** Manages TTLs and invalidates outdated identifiers.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Permission Issuance:** When a user requests access to a resource, the system determines the appropriate base schema and any necessary schema fragments based on user role and resource type.  A TTL is assigned to the permission. The Permission Generator assembles the complete schema and embeds a fragment within the identifier.
2.  **Identifier Creation:** The Identifier Factory creates a unique identifier. This identifier incorporates:
    *   An encoded schema fragment representing the permitted data fields and/or operations.
    *   A TTL value indicating the permission's lifespan (e.g., in seconds).
    *   A cryptographic signature to ensure identifier integrity and prevent tampering.  (e.g. HMAC-SHA256)
3.  **Request Transmission:** The client includes the identifier in subsequent requests (e.g., as a URI query parameter, header, or within a JSON payload).
4.  **Request Interception & Validation:** The Request Interceptor receives the request and extracts the identifier. It validates the signature and checks if the TTL has expired.
5.  **Schema Reconstruction (if valid):** If the identifier is valid, the system reconstructs the complete schema based on the embedded fragment and stored base schemas. This schema is used to authorize the request.
6.  **Temporal Decay:** The Temporal Decay Engine continuously monitors identifier TTLs.  Expired identifiers are marked as invalid, and associated permissions are revoked.

**3.  Pseudocode (Request Interceptor):**

```
function interceptRequest(request):
  identifier = extractIdentifier(request)

  if identifier is null:
    denyRequest(request, "Missing Identifier")
    return

  if not validateSignature(identifier):
    denyRequest(request, "Invalid Signature")
    return

  ttl = extractTTL(identifier)
  if ttl is null or ttl <= currentTime():
    denyRequest(request, "Expired Permission")
    return

  schemaFragment = extractSchemaFragment(identifier)
  completeSchema = reconstructSchema(schemaFragment)

  authorizeRequest(request, completeSchema) // Apply schema to request

  return
```

**4. Schema Encoding:**

Schemas will be encoded in a compact format (e.g. Protocol Buffers, JSON Schema) to minimize identifier size.  Schema fragments will represent differential changes from base schemas, further reducing size.  

**5. Dynamic Schema Generation:**

The Permission Generator supports dynamic schema generation based on contextual factors beyond user role and resource type.  This includes:

*   **Data Sensitivity:**  Automatically redact or mask sensitive data fields based on user clearance level.
*   **Time-Based Access:**  Grant access to specific data fields only during certain time windows.
*   **Location-Based Access:** Restrict access based on the user's geographic location.
*   **Device-Based Access:**  Grant access only from trusted devices.

**6.  Considerations:**

*   **Identifier Size:**  Careful optimization of schema encoding and fragmenting is crucial to minimize identifier size.
*   **Scalability:** The Temporal Decay Engine must be scalable to handle a large number of identifiers.
*   **Security:**  Strong cryptographic signatures are essential to prevent identifier tampering.
*    **Schema Versioning:** Implement schema versioning to ensure compatibility across different system components.
