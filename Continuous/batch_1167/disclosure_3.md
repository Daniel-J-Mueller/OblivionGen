## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Profiles Linked to Input Type & Viewing Distance

**Concept:** Augment the dynamic UI generation described in the patent with localized haptic feedback tailored to the device input type *and* the calculated intended viewing distance. This isn't simply vibration; it's nuanced, spatially distributed haptic textures and forces.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Profile Database:** A cloud-hosted database containing pre-defined haptic profiles categorized by:
    *   Device Input Type (Touch, Mouse, Stylus, Voice, Gesture, etc.)
    *   Content Type (Text, Image, Video, Interactive Element, etc.)
    *   Intended Viewing Distance (quantized into ranges - e.g., < 30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm, >100cm).
    *   Interaction Type (Tap, Swipe, Long Press, Scroll, etc.).
*   **Haptic Engine API:** Software interface allowing applications to request haptic feedback based on:
    *   Content being displayed/interacted with.
    *   Current device input type (obtained via system APIs).
    *   Calculated intended viewing distance (from the patent’s system).
*   **Localized Haptic Actuator Control:**  System capable of driving a high-density array of micro-actuators (e.g., ultrasonic transducers, shape memory alloys, electrostatic actuators) embedded in or attached to the device screen or chassis. This allows for spatially varying haptic textures and forces.
*   **Haptic Profile Generation Tool:** A system (potentially AI-assisted) for creating and refining haptic profiles.  This tool would allow designers to define the shape, intensity, and timing of haptic feedback.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** Modify the existing UI rendering pipeline to incorporate haptic data.  The rendering engine generates not just visual instructions but also haptic instructions for the localized actuators.
*   **Adaptive Haptic Scaling:** Automatically adjust haptic intensity based on user preference (settings) and ambient noise levels (using device microphones).

**Pseudocode (Haptic Engine API Call):**

```
function requestHapticFeedback(contentType, interactionType, deviceInputType, viewingDistance):
    // 1. Query Haptic Profile Database
    profile = queryDatabase(contentType, interactionType, deviceInputType, viewingDistance)

    // 2. If profile found:
    if profile != null:
        // 3. Extract haptic parameters (e.g., texture, intensity, duration)
        texture = profile.texture
        intensity = profile.intensity
        duration = profile.duration

        // 4.  Translate parameters into actuator control signals
        actuatorSignals = translateToActuatorSignals(texture, intensity, duration)

        // 5. Send signals to localized actuator array
        sendActuatorSignals(actuatorSignals)
    else:
        // 6.  Fallback to default haptic feedback (e.g., simple vibration)
        playDefaultVibration()
```

**Example Application:**

*   **Text Reading:** When reading text up close (short viewing distance), a subtle “grainy” haptic texture simulating paper is applied to the screen under the finger as the user scrolls. As the user moves the device further away, the texture becomes smoother.
*   **Image Manipulation:** When zooming and panning an image, the haptic feedback provides a sense of “depth” and “texture” corresponding to the details of the image.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Buttons and sliders have distinct haptic “clicks” and “resistance” that vary depending on the input type (e.g., a sharper click for a stylus, a smoother slide for a touch gesture).
*   **Gaming:** Provides directional haptic feedback for in-game events, terrain changes, and collisions.
