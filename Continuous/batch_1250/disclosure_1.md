## Adaptive Request Sharding with Predictive Contextual Weighting

**Specification:** A system for dynamically partitioning incoming requests not just by context (as the base patent details), but by *predicted* future load associated with each context, adjusting queue weighting in real-time. This moves beyond static context-based sharding to a proactive system that anticipates demand fluctuations.

**Components:**

*   **Context Analyzer:**  Identifies context values from incoming requests (user ID, event source, location, event type â€“ as in the patent).
*   **Historical Load Database:** Stores a time-series of load metrics for *each* context value.  Load metrics include request volume, processing time, error rates, and resource utilization.
*   **Predictive Engine:** Uses time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future load for each context. It outputs a "Load Prediction Score" (LPS) for each context value.
*   **Dynamic Weighting Module:**  Calculates queue weights based on the LPS. Higher LPS values translate to higher queue weights. This is not simply proportional; a logarithmic or sigmoid function can prevent a single context from dominating the system.
*   **Sharding Logic:** Routes incoming requests to queues based on context *and* the dynamically adjusted queue weights. Requests are distributed probabilistically, favoring queues with higher weights.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitors actual queue lengths and processing times. Deviations from predicted load trigger adjustments to the forecasting models and/or weighting parameters.

**Pseudocode (Sharding Logic):**

```
function shardRequest(request):
  context = ContextAnalyzer(request)
  LPS = PredictiveEngine(context)
  weights = DynamicWeightingModule(LPS) // Returns a dictionary {context: weight}

  totalWeight = sum(weights.values())
  probability = weights[context] / totalWeight

  // Use a random number generator to determine which queue to route to
  randomNumber = random()
  if randomNumber < probability:
    queue = contextQueueMap[context] // Direct to relevant queue
  else:
    // Distribute the request to another queue, using a weighted random selection
    // This can prevent a single context from monopolizing a queue
    randomlySelectedQueue = weightedRandomSelection(queueMap, weights)
    queue = randomlySelectedQueue

  queue.enqueue(request)
  return queue
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `contextQueueMap`: Dictionary mapping context values to queue identifiers.
*   `queueMap`: Dictionary mapping queue identifiers to queue objects.
*   `HistoricalLoadDatabase`: Time-series database optimized for fast lookups and forecasting.

**Novelty:**

Existing systems typically use static or rule-based context sharding. This specification introduces proactive load prediction and dynamic weight adjustment.  This allows the system to *anticipate* demand fluctuations and optimize resource allocation, improving overall performance and responsiveness. It is especially useful in scenarios with volatile or unpredictable workloads. The feedback loop ensures the system adapts to changing patterns over time.
