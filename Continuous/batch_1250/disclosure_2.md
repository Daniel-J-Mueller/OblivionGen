## Dynamic Hardware Abstraction Layer for Peripheral Security

**Concept:** Expand the existing hardware-level filtering to include a dynamically configurable abstraction layer. Instead of policies directly targeting specific memory addresses or device addresses, introduce a layer that maps logical peripheral identifiers to physical addresses. This abstraction layer allows for security policies to be applied at a higher, more manageable level, *without* requiring changes to the underlying hardware or firmware when peripheral mappings change.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Dynamic Peripheral Mapping Unit (DPMU) - a dedicated hardware module integrated with the existing programmable logic device (PLD) or security device.
*   **Memory:** Non-volatile memory (e.g., flash) to store the peripheral mapping table.  Table size configurable, minimum 256 entries.
*   **Peripheral Identifier:** 32-bit identifier assigned to each peripheral device.
*   **Mapping Table Entry:**
    *   Peripheral Identifier (32 bits)
    *   Base Physical Address (64 bits) – start of the peripheral's memory-mapped region
    *   Region Size (32 bits) – size of the memory-mapped region
    *   Security Flags (8 bits) - define access restrictions (read-only, write-only, execute, etc.).  These flags are used in conjunction with existing policies.
*   **Policy Engine Modification:** Update the policy engine to operate on Peripheral Identifiers *instead* of physical addresses. Policies define actions based on Peripheral Identifier and desired operation (read, write, execute).
*   **Transaction Interception:**  PLD intercepts all hardware-level transactions.
*   **Address Translation:** PLD uses the DPMU to translate the physical address in the transaction to a Peripheral Identifier.
*   **Policy Lookup:** PLD looks up the relevant policy based on the Peripheral Identifier and transaction type.
*   **Action Execution:** PLD applies the policy action (block, mask, redirect, etc.).
*   **Dynamic Updates:**  A secure, authenticated API (e.g., over SMBus or a dedicated interface) allows authorized software to update the peripheral mapping table *without* requiring a system reboot.  Versioning and rollback mechanisms are essential.
*   **Secure Boot Integration:** The peripheral mapping table is cryptographically signed during system boot to prevent unauthorized modifications.

**Pseudocode (PLD Transaction Handling):**

```pseudocode
function handle_transaction(transaction):
    physical_address = transaction.address
    transaction_type = transaction.type  // read, write, execute

    peripheral_id = DPMU.translate_address(physical_address)

    if peripheral_id == null:
        // Address not mapped – deny access (default behavior)
        return deny_access()

    policy = policy_engine.lookup_policy(peripheral_id, transaction_type)

    if policy == null:
        // No policy defined – allow access (default behavior) - *logging required*
        return allow_access()

    action = policy.action

    switch action:
        case "block":
            return block_transaction()
        case "mask":
            masked_data = mask_data(transaction.data, policy.mask)
            transaction.data = masked_data
            return allow_access()
        case "redirect":
            redirect_address = policy.redirect_address
            transaction.address = redirect_address
            return allow_access()
        case "allow":
            return allow_access()
        default:
            // Invalid action – log error and deny access
            return deny_access()
```

**Innovation:** This approach decouples security policies from the physical hardware layout, increasing system flexibility and resilience.  It simplifies security management, especially in systems with dynamically reconfigurable peripherals or virtualized hardware. It also supports easier auditing and compliance by providing a centralized view of peripheral access controls.
