## Adaptive Propeller Geometry for Dynamic Airflow Harvesting

**Concept:** Instead of solely *orienting* existing propellers to harvest energy from airflow, actively *morph* the propeller blade geometry in real-time to maximize energy capture across a wider range of speeds and directions. This goes beyond simple pitch control, involving changes to blade chord length, twist, and even airfoil shape.

**Specifications:**

*   **Propeller Design:** Modular propeller blades constructed from shape memory alloy (SMA) segments and flexible composite materials. Each blade comprises 5-7 independent segments.
*   **Actuation System:** Micro-actuators (piezoelectric or miniature servo motors) embedded within each propeller hub. Each actuator controls the deformation of a corresponding blade segment.
*   **Sensing Suite:**
    *   **Airflow Sensors:** Miniature pitot-static tubes integrated along the leading edge of each blade to measure local airflow velocity and direction.
    *   **Strain Gauges:** Embedded within each blade segment to monitor stress and deflection.
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Integrated into the propeller hub to measure rotational speed, acceleration, and orientation.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Algorithm:** A reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained to optimize blade geometry for maximum power generation, given airflow conditions and vehicle state.
    *   **Data Input:** Airflow sensor data, strain gauge readings, IMU data, vehicle speed, battery charge level, and delivery destination.
    *   **Output:** Control signals for each micro-actuator, dictating the shape of each blade segment.
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Generated electricity is fed directly into the vehicle's power system, prioritizing battery charging.
    *   Excess energy can power onboard sensors or other auxiliary systems.
    *   A predictive algorithm anticipates power needs and adjusts blade geometry accordingly.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Cruise Mode:** Optimizes blade geometry for sustained energy harvesting during flight.
    *   **Maneuver Mode:** Prioritizes vehicle control and stability during maneuvers, while still attempting to capture energy.
    *   **Emergency Mode:** Maximizes energy generation to extend flight time in critical situations.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
// Initialize sensors and control system

while (true) {
  // Read sensor data
  airflow_data = read_airflow_sensors()
  strain_data = read_strain_gauges()
  imu_data = read_imu()
  battery_level = read_battery_level()

  // Process data and estimate optimal blade geometry using RL agent
  optimal_geometry = rl_agent.predict(airflow_data, strain_data, imu_data, battery_level)

  // Calculate actuator commands based on optimal geometry
  actuator_commands = calculate_actuator_commands(optimal_geometry)

  // Send commands to actuators
  send_actuator_commands(actuator_commands)

  // Monitor system performance and adjust parameters as needed
  monitor_performance()

  // Delay for a short period
  delay(0.01)
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple propeller orientation to *actively morph* blade geometry, enabling significantly higher energy capture efficiency and adapting to a wider range of flight conditions. The use of reinforcement learning allows the system to continuously optimize performance and learn from experience.
