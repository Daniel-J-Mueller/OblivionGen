## Dynamic Keyword Augmentation Based on User Intent Signals

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple conversion rate comparison by incorporating real-time user intent signals *before* keyword augmentation. This allows for predictive augmentation, tailoring keywords not just to past performance, but to current user behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Intent Signal Acquisition Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Internal Search Logs: Track user queries *immediately preceding* clicks on advertised items.
    *   External Search Data (via API integration): Access anonymized, aggregated search query data related to keywords triggering ads.
    *   Landing Page Behavior: Track user interactions on landing pages (e.g., time on page, scroll depth, elements clicked) after clicking on an ad.
*   **Signal Processing:**
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyze search queries & landing page content to identify user intent categories (e.g., informational, navigational, transactional).
    *   Sentiment Analysis: Determine user sentiment related to keywords/products.
    *   Behavioral Clustering: Group users with similar intent & behavior patterns.

**2. Predictive Augmentation Engine:**

*   **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., neural network, random forest) to predict the likelihood of conversion based on:
    *   Historical conversion data.
    *   Real-time intent signals (from Module 1).
    *   Keyword characteristics (e.g., length, specificity).
    *   Landing page characteristics (e.g., content, layout).
*   **Augmentation Logic:**
    *   For each candidate keyword:
        *   The model predicts conversion probability *with* and *without* potential augmentation terms.
        *   If the predicted probability *with* augmentation significantly exceeds the probability *without* augmentation (defined by a configurable threshold), augment the keyword.
        *   Augmentation terms are selected from a dynamically updated dictionary (see Module 3).

**3. Dynamic Augmentation Dictionary:**

*   **Sources:**
    *   Product Catalogs: Extract relevant attributes & synonyms for products.
    *   Trending Search Data: Identify popular related search terms.
    *   Competitor Analysis: Monitor competitor keywords & landing pages.
    *   NLP-based Synonym Generation: Generate potential augmentation terms based on semantic similarity.
*   **Maintenance:**
    *   Regularly update the dictionary with new terms & remove underperforming terms.
    *   Prioritize augmentation terms based on predicted impact (from the Predictive Augmentation Engine).
*   **Categorization:** Augmentation terms are categorized based on product type, user intent, and sentiment.

**4.  A/B Testing & Feedback Loop:**

*   Continuously A/B test different augmentation strategies and terms.
*   Track performance metrics (conversion rate, click-through rate, cost per acquisition).
*   Use feedback to refine the Predictive Augmentation Engine and Dynamic Augmentation Dictionary.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Augmentation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION predict_conversion_probability(keyword, augmentation_term, user_intent_signals, historical_data):
  //Input: Keyword, Augmentation Term, User Intent Signals, Historical Data
  //Output: Predicted Conversion Probability
  
  //Feature Engineering: Combine keyword, augmentation term, and user intent signals into a feature vector
  features = combine_features(keyword, augmentation_term, user_intent_signals)
  
  //Use a trained ML model to predict conversion probability
  probability = model.predict(features) 
  
  RETURN probability

FUNCTION augment_keyword(keyword):
  //Get user intent signals (from Intent Signal Acquisition Module)
  intent_signals = get_user_intent_signals()

  //Generate a list of potential augmentation terms (from Dynamic Augmentation Dictionary)
  augmentation_terms = get_augmentation_terms(keyword)

  //Calculate predicted conversion probability for each augmentation term
  probabilities = []
  FOR term IN augmentation_terms:
    probability = predict_conversion_probability(keyword, term, intent_signals, historical_data)
    probabilities.append((term, probability))

  //Select the augmentation term with the highest predicted probability
  best_term, best_probability = max(probabilities, key=lambda item: item[1])

  //Check if the best probability exceeds a predefined threshold
  IF best_probability > threshold:
    augmented_keyword = keyword + " " + best_term
    RETURN augmented_keyword
  ELSE:
    RETURN keyword //Do not augment
```

This system aims to move beyond reactive keyword augmentation to a proactive, intent-driven approach that maximizes conversion rates in real-time.
