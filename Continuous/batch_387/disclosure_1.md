## Modular PCB Stacking with Integrated Fluidic Channels

**Concept:** Extend the embedded connector concept to enable multi-PCB stacks *with* integrated microfluidic channels for thermal management and/or chemical sensing. The PCBs aren't just electrically connected, they're plumbed together.

**Specifications:**

**1. PCB Layer Stack (Base Unit):**

*   **Material:** FR4 or similar PCB substrate.
*   **Layers:** Minimum 6 layers.
    *   Layer 1 & 6: Copper planes (Power/Ground).
    *   Layers 2 & 5: Signal routing.
    *   Layers 3 & 4: Core Layer – Embedded Connector Pads *and* Microfluidic Channel Grooves. These grooves will be etched/milled into the core layer material.
*   **Embedded Connector:**  As per the referenced patent – lateral, male connector extending beyond the PCB edge.  Critical: Connector material must be chemically inert to fluids anticipated (water, glycol, oils, specific chemical sensors).

**2. Microfluidic Channel Design:**

*   **Channel Material:** Chemically inert polymer (e.g., PDMS, PTFE) or etched/milled FR4. Polymer layer bonded to Core Layer during PCB fabrication.
*   **Channel Dimensions:** Width: 0.5 - 2mm, Depth: 0.2 - 1mm (Scalable based on fluid flow requirements).
*   **Channel Network:** Channels run *horizontally* within the Core Layer, connecting from one lateral edge of the PCB to the other.  Multiple channels per PCB.  Channels are sealed by layers above and below.
*   **Inlet/Outlet Ports:** Integrated micro-connector ports at each lateral edge of the PCB.  These ports align when PCBs are stacked. Ports use a friction-fit or luer-lock style connection.

**3. Stacking Mechanism:**

*   **Alignment Features:** Precision alignment pins/holes on each PCB edge to ensure accurate stacking.
*   **Compression Contacts:**  Integrated spring-loaded contacts on each PCB, aligning with pads on adjacent PCBs. These contacts provide electrical connection *and* a sealing force on the microfluidic channel interfaces.
*   **Stacking Height:** PCBs are designed with standardized stacking height (e.g., 5mm increments).
*   **Retention Mechanism:**  Screw or clip-based retention to hold the stack together.

**4. Software/Control (Conceptual):**

*   **Thermal Monitoring:** Temperature sensors embedded within each PCB, communicating via I2C or SPI.
*   **Flow Rate Control:** Micro-pumps/valves integrated into the stack, controlled by a microcontroller.
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Chemical sensors integrated into the microfluidic channels, providing data on fluid composition.

**Pseudocode for Stack Control:**

```
// Initialize sensors, pumps, valves
Initialize();

while (true) {
  // Read temperature data from each PCB
  temperatureData = ReadTemperature();

  // Read sensor data from microfluidic channels
  sensorData = ReadSensorData();

  // Calculate optimal pump/valve settings based on temperature and sensor data
  pumpSettings = CalculatePumpSettings(temperatureData, sensorData);

  // Apply pump/valve settings
  ApplyPumpSettings(pumpSettings);

  // Log data
  LogData(temperatureData, sensorData, pumpSettings);

  // Delay
  Delay(100ms);
}
```

**Applications:**

*   **High-Density Computing:**  Liquid cooling for stacked processors/GPUs.
*   **Lab-on-a-Chip:**  Microfluidic analysis and sensing.
*   **Wearable Sensors:**  Fluid analysis for health monitoring.
*   **Environmental Monitoring:** Stacked sensor arrays for pollutant detection.
