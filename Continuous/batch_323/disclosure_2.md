## Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' & Predictive Restriction Adjustment

**Core Concept:** Expand upon individualized access restrictions by introducing a 'shadow network' for predictive behavior analysis and dynamically adjusting restrictions *before* a violation occurs. This goes beyond simply *reacting* to a device attempting access outside defined parameters – it proactively shapes the network experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Behavioral Profiler (BP):** Runs as a service on the access point/network controller. 
    *   Input: Raw network traffic data (timestamped packets, source/destination IPs, ports, data volume, application signatures) from *all* connected devices.
    *   Processing: Employs machine learning (specifically, recurrent neural networks – LSTMs or GRUs) to build individual behavioral profiles for each device. Profiles include:
        *   Typical access times (hourly/daily/weekly patterns).
        *   Commonly accessed websites/services (categorized - e.g., social media, streaming, work, gaming).
        *   Data usage patterns (volume/duration per category).
        *   Application usage frequency & bandwidth demands.
    *   Output:  A continuously updated ‘behavioral vector’ for each device, representing its typical network activity.
*   **Component 2: Predictive Restriction Engine (PRE):** 
    *   Input: Behavioral vector from BP, current access request details (device ID, requested resource, timestamp), existing restriction set for the device.
    *   Processing: 
        1.  **Anomaly Detection:** Compares the current access request to the device’s behavioral vector. Uses statistical measures (e.g., standard deviation, percentile analysis) to identify deviations from normal behavior.
        2.  **Risk Scoring:**  Assigns a ‘risk score’ based on the degree of anomaly detected.  Higher scores indicate a greater probability of violating existing restrictions.
        3.  **Proactive Restriction Adjustment:**  *Before* granting or denying access, PRE can dynamically adjust restrictions:
            *   **Temporary Bandwidth Throttling:**  If a device suddenly requests a large data transfer outside its normal pattern, PRE can temporarily reduce its bandwidth.
            *   **Content Filtering Enhancement:**  If a device starts accessing a category of content it rarely uses, PRE can increase the stringency of content filtering for that device.
            *   **Delayed Access:** Implement a small ‘delay’ to access requests with elevated risk scores, triggering a CAPTCHA or additional authentication step.
    *   Output:  Modified restriction set (if any) and access decision (allow/deny).
*   **Component 3: Shadow Network Emulator (SNE):** A virtualized network segment mirroring the production network. Used for testing and refining PRE algorithms without impacting live users.
    *   Functionality:  SNE ingests anonymized network traffic data. PRE algorithms are run against this data in a safe environment. Performance and accuracy are measured. Algorithms are automatically tuned to minimize false positives/negatives.
*   **Data Storage:** All behavioral data, restriction sets, and PRE algorithm parameters are stored in a centralized database (e.g., NoSQL database) for scalability and analysis.
*   **API Integration:**  A REST API enables integration with existing network management systems, security information and event management (SIEM) platforms, and user authentication services.

**Pseudocode (PRE – simplified):**

```
function adjustRestrictions(deviceID, requestDetails, currentRestrictions):
  behaviorVector = getBehaviorVector(deviceID)
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(requestDetails, behaviorVector)

  if anomalyScore > threshold:
    modifiedRestrictions = currentRestrictions  // Copy existing restrictions
    if requestDetails.type == "dataTransfer":
      modifiedRestrictions.bandwidth = currentRestrictions.bandwidth * 0.5 //Reduce bandwidth
    elif requestDetails.category == "uncommonCategory":
      modifiedRestrictions.contentFilterLevel = "strict" //Increase filtering
    return modifiedRestrictions
  else:
    return currentRestrictions
```

**Innovation:**  This system isn’t just about *enforcing* rules; it’s about *anticipating* potentially problematic behavior and proactively adapting the network to mitigate risks *before* they manifest.  It’s a shift from reactive security to predictive, adaptive control.
