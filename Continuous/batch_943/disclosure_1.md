## Dynamic Data Sharding via Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the single/multi-tenant architecture to incorporate *predictive* data sharding, proactively distributing table fragments across storage nodes *before* throughput demands necessitate it. This aims to smooth out load spikes and optimize resource utilization beyond simply reacting to observed throughput.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Model Component:**

*   **Input:** Historical request patterns (timestamped query types, data accessed), client profiles (predicted usage patterns), system load metrics (CPU, memory, I/O per node).
*   **Model Type:** Time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM). Train separate models per client or client group.
*   **Output:** Probability distribution of expected query load (queries/second) for each table fragment over a configurable time horizon (e.g., next 5 minutes, hour).  Fragments are defined by a partitioning key (e.g., user ID range, date range).

**2. Shard Management Service:**

*   **Responsibility:**  Monitor the predictive models, dynamically adjust data sharding, and orchestrate data movement.
*   **Sharding Strategy:**  Utilize a consistent hashing algorithm to map table fragments to storage nodes.  The hash ring is dynamically adjusted based on predicted load.
*   **Replication:** Maintain a configurable number of replicas for each shard, strategically placed on different storage nodes for fault tolerance.
*   **Movement Trigger:**  If the predicted load on a shard exceeds a configurable threshold on a given node, trigger a data movement operation.
*   **Data Movement Mechanism:** Implement a zero-downtime data migration strategy. Options:
    *   **Copy-on-write:**  New writes are directed to the destination node, while reads are served from both source and destination.  Once synchronization is complete, switch reads entirely to the destination.
    *   **Log shipping:** Continuously replicate transaction logs from the source to the destination.  Apply logs to the destination and perform a final synchronization.

**3. Query Router:**

*   **Responsibility:**  Intercept incoming queries, determine the location of the relevant data shards, and route the queries accordingly.
*   **Shard Location Cache:** Maintain a cache of shard locations to minimize lookup latency.
*   **Query Parallelization:**  If a query involves multiple shards, parallelize the execution across the relevant storage nodes.

**Pseudocode (Shard Management Service - Data Movement):**

```
function moveShard(shardKey, sourceNode, destinationNode):
  // 1. Update Shard Location Cache: Mark destinationNode as primary for shardKey
  updateCache(shardKey, destinationNode)

  // 2. Initiate Data Copy/Sync (Implementation depends on chosen strategy)
  if (strategy == "copy-on-write"):
    copyData(shardKey, sourceNode, destinationNode)
    syncData(shardKey, sourceNode, destinationNode)
  else if (strategy == "log-shipping"):
    startLogReplication(sourceNode, destinationNode)
    waitForReplicationCatchUp()

  // 3. Switch Read Traffic
  routeReadTraffic(shardKey, destinationNode)

  // 4. Monitor and Verify
  verifyDataConsistency(shardKey, sourceNode, destinationNode)
  decommissionSourceNode(sourceNode, shardKey)
```

**Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   Shard Management Service can be horizontally scaled by partitioning the shard space.
*   Replicate Shard Management Service instances for fault tolerance.
*   Utilize a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to maintain consistency of shard metadata.
