## Adaptive Prediction with Spatio-Temporal Attention

**Concept:** Enhance inter-frame prediction not through simple motion vectors, but by learning complex spatial and temporal relationships *before* applying traditional block-based compensation. This system moves beyond direct pixel comparisons, instead focusing on identifying *features* that correlate across frames, even with significant motion or occlusion.

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   **Feature Extraction Module:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to extract salient features from video frames. Outputs feature maps representing edges, textures, and other important visual cues.
    *   **Attention Mechanism:**  A spatio-temporal attention network. This network takes feature maps from the current frame and a set of reference frames as input. It learns to weight different spatial regions and temporal instances based on their relevance to predicting the current frame.
    *   **Prediction Refinement Module:** A secondary CNN that combines the weighted reference frame features with the current frame's features to generate a refined prediction.
    *   **Residual Encoding:** Standard residual encoding (e.g., using DCT) applied to the difference between the refined prediction and the original frame.

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  **Feature Extraction:** Current and reference frames undergo feature extraction using the CNN.
    2.  **Attention Weighting:** The attention network processes the feature maps. It outputs a set of attention weights for each spatial location and reference frame. These weights indicate the importance of each region and frame for prediction.
    3.  **Weighted Combination:** The reference frame features are multiplied by their corresponding attention weights. This emphasizes relevant features and suppresses noise or irrelevant information.
    4.  **Prediction Generation:** The weighted reference frame features are combined with the current frame’s features using another CNN. This generates a refined prediction for the current frame.
    5.  **Residual Encoding:** The residual (difference between the original frame and the refined prediction) is encoded using a standard method (e.g., DCT) for efficient compression.

*   **Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Input: Current Frame (CF), Reference Frames (RF[1...N])

// 1. Feature Extraction
CF_Features = CNN(CF)
RF_Features[i] = CNN(RF[i]) for i in range(N)

// 2. Spatio-Temporal Attention
Attention_Weights = AttentionNetwork(CF_Features, RF_Features) // Outputs weights for each spatial location & ref frame

// 3. Weighted Combination
Weighted_RF_Features = []
for i in range(N):
    Weighted_RF_Features[i] = RF_Features[i] * Attention_Weights[i]

Combined_Features = Concatenate(CF_Features, Weighted_RF_Features)

// 4. Prediction Generation
Predicted_Frame = PredictionCNN(Combined_Features)

// 5. Residual Encoding
Residual = CF - Predicted_Frame
Encoded_Residual = DCT(Residual)

// Output: Encoded_Residual
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:** Requires a GPU or dedicated AI accelerator for efficient CNN and attention network processing.  The system can be parallelized across multiple cores/processors.
*   **Novelty:** Moves beyond traditional block matching by leveraging deep learning to learn complex relationships between frames. The attention mechanism allows the system to focus on the most relevant information, potentially improving prediction accuracy and reducing compression artifacts. This is not simply motion estimation; it’s a learned prediction of visual *content*.
