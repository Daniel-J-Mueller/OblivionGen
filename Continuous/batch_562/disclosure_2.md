## Adaptive Multi-Modal Storytelling System

**Concept:** Expand upon the knowledge base querying and substitution logic to create an interactive, adaptive storytelling experience. Instead of *answering* questions, the system crafts a narrative that dynamically shifts based on user input, leveraging the entity/attribute association framework.

**Specs:**

**1. Narrative Core:**

*   **Storylet Database:** A database containing “storylets” – small, self-contained narrative units (1-5 sentences). Each storylet is tagged with:
    *   `Entities`:  List of entities relevant to the storylet (e.g., “King Arthur”, “Camelot”, “Excalibur”).
    *   `Attributes`: List of relevant attributes (e.g., “brave”, “ancient”, “magical”).
    *   `Connections`:  Pointers to other storylets that can logically follow, based on shared entities/attributes.  These connections are weighted, indicating probability of selection.
    *   `User Input Prompts`:  Optional prompts designed to elicit specific user input (e.g., “What does Arthur decide to do?”).
*   **Initial Storylet:** A designated starting point for the narrative.
*   **Narrative Manager:** A component responsible for:
    *   Selecting the next storylet based on the current storylet, user input, and connection weights.
    *   Rendering the storylet into natural language.
    *   Managing the overall narrative flow.

**2. User Interaction & Adaptation:**

*   **Input Parsing:** The system receives user input (speech or text).  This input is parsed to identify:
    *   `Entities`:  What the user is talking about.
    *   `Attributes`:  How the user describes those entities.
    *   `Actions`:  What the user wants to happen.
*   **Entity/Attribute Mapping:** Map identified entities and attributes to those in the knowledge base.
*   **Substitution Logic:**  If an entity or attribute is missing/ambiguous, leverage the substitution logic described in the provided patent.  However, instead of finding an *answer*, select a storylet where the substituted entity/attribute is relevant.  For example, if the user mentions a "powerful sword" but doesn't specify *which* sword, the system might select a storylet about Excalibur.
*   **Action Resolution:** If the user expresses an action, the system attempts to find a storylet that accommodates that action. This could involve:
    *   Selecting a storylet where the action is already happening.
    *   Selecting a storylet that sets up the conditions for the action to happen.
    *   Dynamically generating a new storylet (a more advanced feature).

**3. Knowledge Base Integration:**

*   The system utilizes the existing knowledge base to:
    *   Resolve entity and attribute ambiguity.
    *   Identify relevant storylets based on shared entities/attributes.
    *   Expand the narrative by introducing new entities/attributes based on user input.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Manager):**

```
function generate_narrative(user_input):
  current_storylet = initial_storylet

  while user wants to continue:
    display current_storylet.text

    parsed_input = parse_user_input(user_input)
    entities = parsed_input.entities
    attributes = parsed_input.attributes
    actions = parsed_input.actions

    relevant_storylets = find_relevant_storylets(current_storylet, entities, attributes, actions)

    if relevant_storylets is empty:
      # Use substitution logic to find a related storylet
      substituted_entities = perform_entity_substitution(entities)
      relevant_storylets = find_relevant_storylets(current_storylet, substituted_entities, attributes, actions)

    next_storylet = select_next_storylet(relevant_storylets) # Based on connection weights

    current_storylet = next_storylet

    user_input = get_user_input()
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Emotional State Modeling:** Incorporate an emotional state model to influence the narrative tone and content.
*   **Character Development:** Allow users to create and customize characters within the story.
*   **Branching Narratives:** Implement branching narratives where user choices have significant consequences.
*   **Multi-Modal Output:**  Integrate images, music, and sound effects to enhance the storytelling experience.
