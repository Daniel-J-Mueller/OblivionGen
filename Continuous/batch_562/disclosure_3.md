## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Personalized Echo Cancellation

**Concept:** Extend the multi-device arbitration to proactively establish ‘acoustic zones’ within a space, dynamically adjusting echo cancellation and speech enhancement based on individual user profiles and real-time detected positions. This moves beyond simply *selecting* a device to *shaping* the acoustic environment.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Enhanced Microphone Arrays:** Each voice-enabled device will incorporate a minimum of 8-microphone array capable of beamforming and sound source localization.
*   **Ultraband/ToF Sensors:** Integrate UWB or Time-of-Flight sensors into each device to improve user position tracking accuracy within the defined space.
*   **Edge Processing:** Each device must have sufficient processing power for real-time audio analysis, beamforming, localization, and echo cancellation algorithms.
*   **Wireless Mesh Network:** Robust, low-latency wireless mesh network interconnecting all devices.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Zone Mapping Module:** Creates a dynamic map of the space, defining acoustic zones based on furniture, walls, and detected user positions. Zones are not fixed; they shift and adapt.
*   **User Profile Database:** Stores individual user voiceprints, preferred audio settings (EQ, volume), and movement patterns.
*   **Real-Time Localization Engine:** Uses microphone array data and UWB/ToF sensor data to track user positions with centimeter-level accuracy. Kalman Filtering employed for smoothing and prediction.
*   **Adaptive Beamforming & Echo Cancellation:**
    *   Each device forms beams towards detected users.
    *   Echo cancellation is personalized based on user profiles *and* the acoustic characteristics of the zone the user is currently in.
    *   Beamforming patterns are continuously adjusted to minimize interference between users and maximize signal clarity.
*   **Zone Transition Handling:**  Algorithms to smoothly transition audio processing as users move between zones, preventing audio dropouts or jarring changes in sound quality.
*   **AI-Powered Acoustic Modeling:** Machine learning models trained on room acoustics data to predict and compensate for reflections and reverberation within each zone.

**3. Pseudocode - Zone-Aware Audio Processing:**

```
// Main Loop (executed on each device)

while (true) {
  // 1. Data Acquisition
  micData = getMicrophoneData();
  locationData = getUWBData();

  // 2. User Localization & Zone Identification
  userPosition = calculateUserPosition(locationData);
  currentZone = identifyZone(userPosition);

  // 3. Zone-Specific Audio Processing
  if (currentZone == 'LivingRoom_Seat1') {
      beamformingPattern = profileDB.getBeamPattern('UserA', 'LivingRoom_Seat1');
      echoCancellationProfile = profileDB.getECProfile('UserA', 'LivingRoom_Seat1');
  } else if (currentZone == 'Kitchen_Counter') {
      beamformingPattern = profileDB.getBeamPattern('UserB', 'Kitchen_Counter');
      echoCancellationProfile = profileDB.getECProfile('UserB', 'Kitchen_Counter');
  } else {
      // Default processing for unknown zones
      beamformingPattern = defaultBeamPattern;
      echoCancellationProfile = defaultECProfile;
  }

  processedAudio = applyBeamforming(micData, beamformingPattern);
  processedAudio = applyEchoCancellation(processedAudio, echoCancellationProfile);

  outputAudio(processedAudio);
}
```

**4. Advanced Features:**

*   **Acoustic Privacy Zones:**  Dynamically create zones that minimize audio leakage to surrounding areas.
*   **Multi-User Conferencing with Spatial Audio:**  Recreate the sense of being in the same room during virtual meetings.
*   **Predictive Acoustic Modeling:** Use machine learning to predict how sound will propagate within the space and proactively adjust audio processing.
