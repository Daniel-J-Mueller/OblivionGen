## Dynamic Forecast Scenario Generation & Simulation

**Concept:** Extend hierarchical forecasting not just with overrides, but with *simulated scenarios*. Allow users to define 'what-if' scenarios involving multiple, interrelated overrides at various hierarchy levels, then *automatically simulate* the impact on the forecasted time series data, generating multiple derived forecasts. This goes beyond simple disaggregation; it models complex dependencies.

**Specifications:**

**1. Scenario Definition Module:**

*   **Input:** User-defined scenario name, description, start/end dates.
*   **Override Definition:** A nested structure defining overrides.
    *   Level: Hierarchy level (e.g., Product Category, Specific Product, Location).
    *   Dimension: Specific dimension within that level (e.g., ‘Electronics’, ‘TV-55in’, ‘New York’).
    *   Override Type:
        *   Absolute Value: Set a specific value.
        *   Percentage Change: Modify the existing forecast by a percentage.
        *   Formula: Apply a mathematical function to the forecast. (e.g., “Forecast * 1.1 + 10”).
    *   Dependencies: Links to other overrides within the same scenario.  (e.g., "If 'Electronics' sales increase by 10%, then 'TV-55in' sales increase by 15%").
*   **Scenario Validation:** Automated checks for conflicting or illogical overrides. (e.g., An override that results in negative sales).

**2. Simulation Engine:**

*   **Dependency Graph:** Construct a directed graph representing the dependencies between overrides.
*   **Hierarchical Propagation:**  Starting from the lowest hierarchy level, apply overrides and propagate their effects *up* the hierarchy.  Account for the proportions defined in the original patent.
*   **Iterative Calculation:**  If the dependency graph contains cycles, use an iterative approach until convergence (stable forecasts).
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation (Optional):** Introduce randomness into the override values within a defined range, generating a distribution of possible forecasts. This adds robustness.

**3. Output & Visualization:**

*   **Scenario Comparison:** Display multiple derived forecasts (one for each scenario) alongside the baseline forecast.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Calculate and display KPIs (e.g., total sales, profit margin, inventory levels) for each scenario.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Identify the overrides that have the greatest impact on the KPIs.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** Allow users to drill down into the data and explore the impact of individual overrides. (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps).

**Pseudocode (Simulation Engine Core):**

```
function SimulateScenario(scenario, baselineForecast):
  derivedForecast = DeepCopy(baselineForecast)
  dependencyGraph = BuildDependencyGraph(scenario.Overrides)

  for each override in TopologicalSort(dependencyGraph):
    level = override.Level
    dimension = override.Dimension
    value = CalculateOverrideValue(override, derivedForecast) # applies % change, formula, etc

    DisaggregateOverride(derivedForecast, level, dimension, value) # uses proportions

    # Propagate effects up the hierarchy
    UpdateParentNodes(derivedForecast, level, dimension)

  return derivedForecast
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Scenario:** {Name, Description, StartDate, EndDate, Overrides}
*   **Override:** {Level, Dimension, OverrideType, Value, Dependencies}
*   **ForecastData:** Multi-dimensional array (Time, Product, Location, etc.) storing forecasted values.
