## Dynamic Environmental Role Assignment

**Concept:** Extend the device grouping and automation concept to consider *environmental* roles, not just device types or user routines. The system dynamically assigns devices to 'environmental roles' (e.g., 'comfort provider', 'security sentinel', 'entertainment hub') based on contextual data *beyond* just the trigger events described in the patent. This allows for more nuanced and intelligent automation, adapting to changes in the environment and user behavior.

**Specs:**

*   **Environmental Role Database:** A database defining various environmental roles. Each role contains:
    *   A description of the role (e.g., "Provides a comfortable temperature and air quality").
    *   A list of *preferred* device types for the role (e.g., Thermostat, Air Purifier, Humidifier).
    *   A list of *acceptable* device types for the role (allowing for flexibility).
    *   A weighting system for device selection within a role (e.g., prioritizing devices with energy-saving features).
    *   Associated actions (e.g., "Increase temperature to 22°C", "Activate air purification mode").
*   **Contextual Data Inputs:** The system ingests data from:
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality, light levels, noise levels).
    *   User presence/location data (from phones, wearables, smart home presence sensors).
    *   Calendar/schedule data.
    *   External data sources (weather forecasts, traffic conditions).
*   **Role Assignment Algorithm:**
    1.  Analyze contextual data to determine current environmental conditions and user needs.
    2.  Identify *potential* environmental roles that are relevant to the current context.
    3.  For each potential role:
        *   Identify all available devices.
        *   Filter devices based on preferred/acceptable types for the role.
        *   Rank devices based on a scoring system that considers:
            *   Device capabilities.
            *   Energy efficiency.
            *   User preferences.
            *   Proximity to relevant areas (e.g., user location).
        *   Assign the highest-ranked device(s) to the role.
    4.  Update the system state to reflect the new role assignments.
*   **Dynamic Automation Rules:** Automation rules are defined based on environmental roles, not just device states. Example: "When the 'comfort provider' role is assigned to the living room, set the thermostat to 22°C and dim the lights."
*   **User Interface:**
    *   A visual representation of environmental roles within the home.
    *   The ability to manually override role assignments.
    *   Customizable automation rules based on roles.
    *   A learning system that adapts role assignments based on user feedback.

**Pseudocode (Role Assignment):**

```
function assignRoles(contextData, devices, userPreferences):
  roles = identifyRelevantRoles(contextData)

  for role in roles:
    eligibleDevices = filterDevicesByType(devices, role.preferredTypes, role.acceptableTypes)
    scoredDevices = scoreDevices(eligibleDevices, userPreferences) // Considers capabilities, efficiency, proximity, etc.
    assignedDevice = getHighestScoredDevice(scoredDevice)
    assignDeviceToRole(assignedDevice, role)
```
