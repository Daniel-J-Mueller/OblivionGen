## Automated Predictive Maintenance System with Haptic Feedback

**System Overview:**

This system leverages the object/state tracking from the core patent to predict component failures *before* they occur, and then guides a technician through a repair using haptic feedback. It moves beyond simply *identifying* an activity and focuses on *preventing* downtime through proactive maintenance.

**Components:**

*   **Enhanced Imaging Array:** Multiple high-resolution cameras (RGB-D preferred) strategically positioned to capture comprehensive visual data of target equipment. More cameras than strictly necessary; data fusion handles redundancy.
*   **Edge Computing Node:** A dedicated computing node located near the equipment to perform initial image processing, object recognition, and state tracking in real-time.
*   **Predictive Failure Model:** A machine learning model trained on historical equipment data, sensor readings (if available), and visual data. This model predicts the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical components based on observed states and changes in state. The model needs to accommodate component "drift", learning the expected degradation curve over time.
*   **Haptic Guidance System:** A wearable device (glove or arm sleeve) providing localized force feedback to the technician. This guides their hands during disassembly, reassembly, and component replacement.
*   **Central Server:** A server responsible for model training, data storage, and remote monitoring.

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** The imaging array continuously captures visual data of the target equipment. The Edge Computing Node processes this data to identify and track critical components.
2.  **State Tracking & Prediction:** The system tracks the state of each component (e.g., position, orientation, wear, corrosion, vibration - inferred from visual cues).  The Predictive Failure Model analyzes this data to estimate the RUL of each component. A threshold is set for triggering maintenance alerts.
3.  **Maintenance Alert & Workflow Generation:** When a componentâ€™s RUL falls below the threshold, an alert is generated, and a customized maintenance workflow is created. This workflow includes a sequence of steps, necessary tools, and predicted repair time.
4.  **Haptic Guidance Integration:** The maintenance workflow is translated into a series of haptic instructions for the wearable device. These instructions guide the technician through each step of the repair, providing force feedback to indicate correct positioning, torque, and alignment. 
5.  **Real-Time Adjustment:**  The system monitors the technician's actions in real-time (using the imaging array and/or inertial measurement units on the wearable device). If the technician deviates from the prescribed workflow, the haptic guidance is adjusted accordingly.
6.  **Data Logging & Feedback:** All actions performed during the maintenance process are logged and used to refine the Predictive Failure Model and haptic guidance algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Guidance Loop):**

```
// Define target component and action
Component targetComponent = GetNextComponentInWorkflow()
Action currentAction = targetComponent.GetNextAction()

// Calculate ideal position/force for action
Vector3 idealPosition = currentAction.GetIdealPosition()
float idealForce = currentAction.GetIdealForce()

// Read technician's current position/force from wearable device
Vector3 currentPosition = GetTechnicianPosition()
float currentForce = GetTechnicianForce()

// Calculate error
Vector3 error = idealPosition - currentPosition
float forceError = idealForce - currentForce

// Apply proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control
float kp = 0.5  // Proportional gain
float ki = 0.1  // Integral gain
float kd = 0.2  // Derivative gain

float correctionForce = kp * forceError + ki * integral(forceError) + kd * derivative(forceError)

// Send correction force to haptic device
SetHapticForce(correctionForce)

// Check for completion
if (IsActionCompleted()) {
    MarkActionCompleted()
    // Move to next action
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple activity recognition to *proactive* maintenance.  The combination of predictive failure modeling with haptic guidance provides a unique and powerful solution for reducing downtime and improving technician efficiency.  The real-time adjustment of haptic guidance based on technician actions is also a key differentiator.
