## Attestation-Based Dynamic Hardware Root of Trust

**Concept:** Extend the attestation process to not just *verify* a system's configuration, but to *dynamically establish* a hardware Root of Trust (RoT) based on attested components. This moves beyond static RoT implementations tied to specific hardware and allows for a more flexible, adaptable security posture.

**Specification:**

**1. Component Inventory & Attestation Profile:**

*   Each host system maintains a dynamic inventory of its hardware components (CPU, memory modules, network interfaces, storage devices, peripherals).
*   A security policy defines "trusted component profiles" â€“ sets of acceptable hardware configurations. Profiles can be tailored to specific workloads or environments.
*   Initial system boot initiates an attestation process, reporting the current hardware inventory to a remote attestation service.

**2. Dynamic RoT Establishment:**

*   The attestation service validates the reported inventory against defined trusted component profiles.
*   If the inventory matches a valid profile, the service issues a "RoT authorization token." This token contains a cryptographic key (or key derivation material) and access control policies.
*   The authorization token is securely provisioned to a dedicated hardware security module (HSM) or a secure enclave on the host.
*   This HSM/enclave becomes the dynamic RoT, used for cryptographic operations, secure storage, and access control.

**3. Continuous Attestation & RoT Rotation:**

*   The host periodically re-attests its hardware configuration.
*   If a significant hardware change is detected (e.g., a memory module replaced), the attestation service revokes the existing RoT authorization token.
*   A new attestation and token issuance process is triggered, establishing a new dynamic RoT based on the updated hardware configuration.

**4. Tamper Detection & Remediation:**

*   The attestation service maintains a historical record of attested hardware configurations.
*   If the attestation process detects an unexpected hardware change (e.g., a component not listed in the historical record), it raises a tamper alert.
*   Automated remediation actions can be triggered, such as system shutdown, data wiping, or isolation of the compromised system.

**Pseudocode (Host-Side Attestation Loop):**

```
loop:
  HardwareInventory = GetHardwareInventory()
  AttestationRequest = CreateAttestationRequest(HardwareInventory)
  AttestationResponse = SendAttestationRequest(AttestationRequest)

  if AttestationResponse.Status == "Success":
    RoTAuthorizationToken = AttestationResponse.RoTAuthorizationToken
    SecurelyProvisionRoT(RoTAuthorizationToken)
  else:
    LogTamperAttempt()
    InitiateRemediation()

  Sleep(AttestationInterval)
  Goto loop
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Secure boot mechanisms are critical to ensure the integrity of the attestation process.
*   HSM/secure enclave selection should prioritize tamper resistance and cryptographic performance.
*   Attestation protocol should be designed to minimize communication overhead and latency.
*   Key management policies must address token rotation, revocation, and secure storage.
*   Scalability of the attestation service is crucial for supporting large deployments.
