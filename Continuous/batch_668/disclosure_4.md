## Adaptive Domain Synthesis for Proactive NLU

**Concept:** Extend the parallel domain activation to proactively *synthesize* new NLU domains on-the-fly, based on detected novel linguistic patterns or emerging user needs. This moves beyond selecting *from* pre-defined domains to *creating* domains dynamically.

**Specifications:**

**1. Novelty Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw query text stream.
*   **Process:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a transformer architecture – trained on a vast corpus of text and a dynamically updated knowledge graph.
*   **Output:**  A “novelty score” representing the degree to which the input deviates from known linguistic patterns and concepts.  The score is calculated by measuring the reconstruction error of the input text when passed through the RNN. Higher reconstruction error indicates greater novelty.

**2. Domain Synthesis Engine:**

*   **Input:** Query text, novelty score, and existing knowledge graph.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Concept Extraction:** Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) models to identify key concepts and relationships within the query text.
    *   **Domain Template Selection:** Based on the extracted concepts, select a relevant domain template from a library of predefined templates (e.g., "booking service", "information retrieval", "device control").
    *   **Domain Customization:**
        *   Generate training data for the new domain using a combination of:
            *   Back-translation of the query text.
            *   Data augmentation techniques (e.g., synonym replacement, random insertion).
            *   Knowledge graph expansion – identify related concepts and generate synthetic examples.
        *   Fine-tune a base NLU model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) using the generated training data.  This creates a domain-specific NLU component.
        *   Construct a knowledge base shard specific to the new domain.
    *   **Domain Activation:** Add the new NLU domain to the parallel processing pipeline.

**3. Dynamic Knowledge Graph:**

*   **Structure:**  A graph database (e.g., Neo4j) storing concepts, entities, relationships, and associated NLU models.
*   **Update Mechanism:** The knowledge graph is continuously updated based on:
    *   Novelty Detection Module output.
    *   User interaction data (e.g., implicit feedback, explicit ratings).
    *   External knowledge sources (e.g., Wikipedia, news articles).

**4. Orchestration & Scoring:**

*   **Parallel Execution:** The dynamically synthesized NLU domain is activated in parallel with existing domains, as described in the original patent.
*   **Weighted Scoring:** The scoring function combines the confidence scores from all activated NLU domains, weighted by:
    *   Domain relevance (based on the novelty score and knowledge graph relationships).
    *   Domain confidence (based on the NLU model’s output).
    *   User history and preferences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processQuery(queryText):
    noveltyScore = detectNovelty(queryText)
    if noveltyScore > threshold:
        newDomain = synthesizeDomain(queryText)
        activateDomain(newDomain)

    results = []
    for domain in activatedDomains:
        result = processTextWithNLU(domain, queryText)
        results.append(result)

    rankedResults = rankResults(results)
    return rankedResults
```

**Engineer Notes:** The core challenge lies in efficiently synthesizing high-quality NLU models on-the-fly.  Leveraging transfer learning and few-shot learning techniques is crucial.  A robust monitoring system is needed to detect and mitigate potential errors introduced by the dynamic domain synthesis process.
