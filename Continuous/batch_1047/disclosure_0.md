## Dynamic Interference Mapping & Predictive Bandwidth Allocation - 'ChameleonNet'

**System Overview:** A distributed network system leveraging localized interference mapping, predictive bandwidth allocation, and a multi-channel ‘chameleon’ approach to optimize wireless performance in dense environments.

**Core Innovation:** The existing patent focuses on *reacting* to interference. ‘ChameleonNet’ aims to *predict* and proactively avoid it. It does this via a multi-agent system wherein each WAP acts as a sensor and predictor, sharing localized interference data with a central (but distributed) learning model. This allows for predictive bandwidth allocation *before* interference manifests, and dynamic channel switching based on anticipated congestion.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Localized Interference Profiling (LIP) Agent:** Each WAP is equipped with a LIP agent.
    *   **Data Collection:** Continuously scans all available channels (beyond those currently in use) for RF energy. Captures RSSI, frequency, and basic signal characteristics.  This utilizes the existing I/Q sampling hardware but expands its scope.
    *   **Feature Extraction:**  Analyzes collected data to identify potential interference sources (e.g., Bluetooth, microwaves, other Wi-Fi networks) and categorize them.  Simple machine learning algorithms (e.g., k-means clustering) are used for categorization.
    *   **Local Interference Map (LIM):** Creates a real-time LIM representing interference levels across all scanned channels.
2.  **Predictive Bandwidth Allocation (PBA) Module:** Runs on a designated ‘coordinator’ WAP (rotating role for redundancy) or a cloud server.
    *   **Data Aggregation:**  Receives LIM data from all WAPs in the network.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM neural network) to predict future interference levels on each channel. This model is trained on historical LIM data.
    *   **Bandwidth Allocation:** Based on predicted interference, the PBA module allocates bandwidth to each WAP, prioritizing channels with the lowest predicted interference.
3.  **Dynamic Channel Switching Protocol (DCSP):**
    *   **Proactive Switching:** When predicted interference on the current channel exceeds a threshold, the DCSP initiates a channel switch to a channel with lower predicted interference *before* significant performance degradation occurs.
    *   **Seamless Handoff:** Utilizes fast BSS transition (802.11r) and pre-authentication to minimize disruption during channel switching.
    *   **Client Awareness:** DCSP communicates channel switch information to connected clients, enabling them to seamlessly transition to the new channel.
4.  **Distributed Learning Model:**
    *   **Federated Learning:** Employs federated learning to train the predictive model without sharing raw LIM data. Each WAP trains a local model on its own data, and only model updates are shared with the coordinator.
    *   **Continuous Improvement:** The federated learning model continuously improves its prediction accuracy as more data is collected and analyzed.
5.  **Adaptive Scanning:**
    *   **Prioritized Channels:** Based on historical data and network usage patterns, the LIP agent prioritizes scanning of specific channels that are more likely to experience interference.
    *   **Duty Cycling:** Adjusts the scanning frequency and duration based on network load and interference levels to minimize power consumption.

**Pseudocode (PBA Module):**

```
function allocateBandwidth(LIM_data):
  for channel in all_channels:
    predicted_interference[channel] = predictInterference(channel, LIM_data)

  sort channels by predicted_interference (ascending)

  for WAP in network:
    allocate WAP to channel with lowest predicted interference
    ensure no channel overlap between adjacent WAPs

  return bandwidth_allocation_plan
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires WAPs with multi-channel scanning capabilities.
*   Increased processing power for running predictive models.
*   Potential need for additional memory for storing historical interference data.
*   High-bandwidth backhaul for transmitting LIM data and bandwidth allocation plans.
