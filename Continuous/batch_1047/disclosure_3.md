## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leverage the signal rate synchronization techniques described in the patent not just for echo cancellation *within* a device, but to *reconstruct* the acoustic environment around the user. This goes beyond simple cancellation – we’re building a dynamic, localized acoustic map.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of 4-8 microphones integrated into a wearable device (e.g., headphones, glasses frame, collar).
    *   Dedicated low-latency digital signal processor (DSP).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer and gyroscope for head/body tracking.
    *   Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity for data logging/visualization.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**

    1.  **Signal Synchronization & Drift Compensation:** Implement the core signal rate synchronization algorithm from the patent across *all* microphones in the array. This ensures precise temporal alignment of captured audio.  Emphasis on real-time drift correction, exceeding the tolerances for basic AEC.

    2.  **Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) Calculation:** Using the synchronized signals, calculate the TDoA between each microphone pair for dominant sound sources. The IMU data provides a stable coordinate frame, correcting for device movement and head/body rotation.

    3.  **Spatial Mapping:**  Convert TDoA data into 3D spatial coordinates for sound sources. Create a dynamic point cloud representing the acoustic environment. The resolution of the point cloud is adaptable based on computational resources.

    4.  **Source Classification:** Employ machine learning (trained on a diverse audio dataset) to classify sound sources (speech, music, environmental sounds – traffic, construction, etc.). This allows for prioritizing certain sounds for reconstruction or suppression.

    5.  **Acoustic Rendering:** Reconstruct the acoustic scene using beamforming and spatial audio techniques. The user can "hear" a localized and enhanced version of their surroundings. This isn't about *cancelling* sounds, but about *remixing* them. We can emphasize desired sounds, suppress annoying ones, and even create a virtual acoustic “bubble” around the user.

    6.  **Adaptive Filtering:** Implement adaptive filters that modify the reconstructed audio based on user preferences (e.g., “boost speech,” “reduce traffic noise,” “enhance music”).

*   **Pseudocode (Simplified for core processing):**

```pseudocode
// Per Microphone:
loop:
    captureAnalogSignal()
    convertAnalogToDigital()
    calculateSignalIndex()
    transmitDigitalSignal()

// Central DSP:
receiveSignalsFromAllMicrophones()

synchronizeSignals(signals, signalIndices) //Use patent algorithm

calculateTDoA(synchronizedSignals)

createSpatialMap(TDoA)

classifySoundSources(spatialMap)

applyUserPreferences(spatialMap)

renderSpatialAudio(spatialMap)

outputAudio()
```

*   **Potential Applications:**

    *   **Augmented Reality:** Enhancing AR experiences with spatially accurate sound.
    *   **Accessibility:** Improving hearing for individuals with hearing impairments.
    *   **Noise Cancellation 2.0:**  Going beyond simple noise cancellation to create customized acoustic environments.
    *   **Virtual/Mixed Reality:** Creating immersive and realistic audio environments.
    *   **Security/Surveillance:**  Locating and identifying sound sources for security applications.
