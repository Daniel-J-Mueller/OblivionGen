## Adaptive Graph Resilience System

**Concept:** Leveraging dynamic graph reconstruction based on observed network behavior to proactively mitigate abusive node identification & propagation. The existing patent focuses on *detecting* abusive nodes through graph analysis. This system focuses on *preventing* effective propagation *despite* abusive nodes existing, increasing overall network resilience.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Behavioral Anomaly Monitor (BAM)**
    *   Function: Continuously monitors network traffic (packet headers, flow characteristics) for subtle deviations from baseline behavior. This isn't signature-based; it’s statistical anomaly detection using time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing).
    *   Data Inputs: Network telemetry (NetFlow, sFlow, packet captures – selectively).
    *   Outputs: Anomaly Scores (continuous values indicating deviation from normal) associated with each node.
*   **Component 2: Dynamic Graph Constructor (DGC)**
    *   Function:  Reconstructs the input graph (as in the original patent) *but* with adaptive edge weighting and reconstruction frequency.
    *   Data Inputs:
        *   Initial Graph Data (as per the patent).
        *   Anomaly Scores from BAM.
        *   Configuration Parameters (Reconstruction Interval, Weighting Factor).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Base Graph:** Start with the initial graph.
        2.  **Edge Weighting:** Edges connecting nodes with high Anomaly Scores (above a dynamic threshold) are *downweighted* (their value reduced). Edges connecting nodes with consistently *low* Anomaly Scores are *upweighted*.
        3.  **Adaptive Reconstruction:**  Instead of a fixed reconstruction interval, the DGC dynamically adjusts the frequency based on the rate of change of Anomaly Scores.  If anomaly rates increase rapidly, reconstruction occurs more frequently.
        4.  **Edge Pruning:** Edges with weights below a certain threshold are *removed* entirely, effectively isolating potentially abusive nodes.
*   **Component 3: Resilience Analyzer (RA)**
    *   Function: Measures the network's robustness to node failures/attacks on the dynamically reconstructed graph.
    *   Process:
        1.  **Simulated Attacks:** RA simulates the removal of nodes (starting with those with the highest anomaly scores) and measures the impact on network connectivity (using metrics like network diameter, average path length, and clustering coefficient).
        2.  **Resilience Score:** RA generates a "Resilience Score" based on the network's ability to maintain connectivity despite node removals.
        3.  **Feedback Loop:**  The Resilience Score is fed back to the DGC to adjust edge weighting and reconstruction frequency, optimizing the network for resilience.
*   **Pseudocode – DGC Update Loop:**

```
While (Network is Active):
  AnomalyData = BAM.GetAnomalyScores()
  CurrentGraph = GetCurrentGraph()
  For Each Node in CurrentGraph:
    AnomalyScore = AnomalyData[Node]
    For Each Neighbor in Node.Neighbors:
      EdgeWeight = Neighbor.EdgeWeight
      If (AnomalyScore > Threshold):
        EdgeWeight = EdgeWeight * DownweightFactor  // Reduce weight
      Else:
        EdgeWeight = EdgeWeight * UpweightFactor   // Increase weight
      Neighbor.EdgeWeight = Max(0, EdgeWeight)   // Ensure weight is non-negative

    Remove Edges with Weight < PruningThreshold

  ResilienceScore = RA.AnalyzeResilience(CurrentGraph)
  Adjust Reconstruction Interval based on rate of change of ResilienceScore
  Update CurrentGraph with new weights and connections
  Sleep(Reconstruction Interval)
```

**Innovation:**  This system moves beyond simply identifying abusive nodes to proactively mitigating their impact by dynamically adapting the network's topology. It is a form of self-healing network, creating a moving target for attackers. It doesn’t depend on *perfect* detection; it emphasizes resilience even in the presence of undetected abuse.
