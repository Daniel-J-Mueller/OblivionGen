## Adaptive Dependency Mirroring & Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the dependency management system to proactively *mirror* critical dependencies across availability zones or even data centers, coupled with a robust, automated rollback system based on real-time health monitoring. This isn't about simple replication; it's about creating a dynamically adjusted, resilient dependency network.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Graph Augmentation:**

*   The existing dependency graph must be expanded to include ‘dependency weight’ - a calculated value representing the criticality of a dependency. This weight considers factors like service tier, request frequency, and impact of failure.
*   Add ‘replication factor’ to each dependency. This dictates how many redundant instances of the dependency should be maintained. The replication factor is dynamically adjusted based on the dependency weight and current system health.
*   Introduce ‘dependency health score’ tracked via continuous monitoring. This score reflects the operational status, latency, and error rates of the dependency.

**2. Mirroring Engine:**

*   Develop a mirroring engine that automatically provisions and maintains mirrored instances of critical dependencies.  This engine utilizes containerization/virtualization for rapid deployment and scalability.
*   The engine will employ intelligent routing – directing traffic to the healthiest instance of a dependency, whether primary or mirrored. This routing is handled by a dedicated load balancing component.
*   Mirroring can be configured to be ‘active-active’ (both instances serving traffic) or ‘active-passive’ (passive instance in standby). The configuration is determined by the dependency weight and cost of maintaining redundancy.

**3. Automated Rollback System:**

*   Implement a rollback manager that monitors dependency health scores in real-time.  If a dependency falls below a defined threshold, the rollback manager automatically initiates a switchover to a mirrored instance.
*   The rollback process should be fully automated and non-disruptive to client applications. It involves updating routing tables and potentially migrating state (if necessary).
*   A ‘rollback history’ is maintained to track all rollback events. This data is used for analysis and optimization of the mirroring and rollback process.

**4. Dynamic Adjustment Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
function adjust_dependencies(system_health, dependency_weights) {
  for each dependency in dependency_graph {
    // Calculate adjusted_replication_factor based on dependency_weight & system_health
    adjusted_replication_factor = dependency_weight * (1 + system_health_impact)

    // If current_replication_factor < adjusted_replication_factor
    if (current_replication_factor < adjusted_replication_factor) {
      // Provision new mirrored instance
      provision_mirror(dependency)
    }

    // If current_replication_factor > adjusted_replication_factor
    if (current_replication_factor > adjusted_replication_factor) {
      // Decommission excess mirrored instances
      decommission_mirror(dependency)
    }
  }
}
```

**5. Integration with Existing System:**

*   The mirroring engine and rollback manager integrate with the existing dependency management service.
*   The existing system is extended to provide APIs for configuring replication factors, health thresholds, and rollback policies.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) can be used to manage the mirrored instances.
*   Service mesh technologies (Istio, Linkerd) can provide intelligent routing and traffic management.
*   Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) can be used to track dependency health and system performance.
*   Consider the cost implications of maintaining redundancy and factor this into the replication factor calculations.
