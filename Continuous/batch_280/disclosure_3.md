## Dynamic Test Instance ‘Swarming’ with Predictive Scaling

**Specification:** A system leveraging real-time telemetry from test instance execution to dynamically adjust the swarm size *during* test execution, prioritizing critical test paths.

**Core Innovation:** Current systems largely determine instance count *before* execution. This system monitors test progress and *shifts* resources to faster-completing or more critical test branches in real-time, prioritizing key functionality while deferring less vital tests if resource contention arises.

**System Components:**

1.  **Test Prioritization Engine:** Assigns priority levels to individual tests or test suites based on factors like functional importance, historical failure rates, and code change impact.  Uses a weighting system configurable via API.

2.  **Telemetry Collection Agent:** Deployed on each test instance, collects data including:
    *   CPU/Memory Utilization
    *   Test Execution Stage (e.g., setup, execution, teardown)
    *   Progress within the test (e.g., % complete for long-running tests)
    *   Error/Failure Signals
    *   Estimated Time to Completion (ETC) – calculated heuristically or via machine learning.

3.  **Swarm Controller:** Central component receiving telemetry data.  Implements the core scaling logic.
    *   **Resource Allocation Algorithm:**
        *   Continuously evaluates telemetry.
        *   Prioritizes test instances/branches with higher priority and lower ETC.
        *   Dynamically requests (or releases) test instances from the on-demand computing service.
        *   Uses a “budget” system – a total resource limit to prevent uncontrolled scaling.
    *   **Predictive Scaling Module:**  Employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) trained on historical test execution data.  Predicts future resource needs *during* execution and proactively scales the swarm.
    *   **Traffic Shaping:**  Manages the distribution of tests across available instances, ensuring load balancing and preventing bottlenecks.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Controller - Core Scaling Logic):**

```
// Global Variables
total_resource_budget = 1000  // Example
current_resource_usage = 0
swarm_size = initial_swarm_size

function scale_swarm(telemetry_data):
  // Calculate weighted priority score for each test
  priority_scores = calculate_priority_scores(telemetry_data)

  // Calculate estimated time to completion (ETC) for each test
  etcs = calculate_etcs(telemetry_data)

  // Calculate a combined "urgency" score: urgency = priority / ETC
  urgency_scores = [priority / etc for priority, etc in zip(priority_scores, etcs)]

  // Sort tests based on urgency
  sorted_tests = sorted(range(len(urgency_scores)), key=lambda i: urgency_scores[i], reverse=True)

  // Calculate desired resources for top N tests
  desired_resources = 0
  for i in range(min(N, len(sorted_tests))):
      desired_resources += telemetry_data[sorted_tests[i]]["resource_estimate"]

  // Adjust swarm size based on desired resources and current usage
  if desired_resources > current_resource_usage + scaling_threshold:
      // Request additional instances
      num_new_instances = int((desired_resources - current_resource_usage) / instance_resource_cost)
      request_new_instances(num_new_instances)
      current_resource_usage += num_new_instances * instance_resource_cost
  elif desired_resources < current_resource_usage - scaling_threshold and current_resource_usage > minimum_resource_usage:
      // Release instances
      num_instances_to_release = int((current_resource_usage - desired_resources) / instance_resource_cost)
      release_instances(num_instances_to_release)
      current_resource_usage -= num_instances_to_release * instance_resource_cost

  //Enforce resource budget
  if current_resource_usage > total_resource_budget:
      release_instances(int((current_resource_usage - total_resource_budget) / instance_resource_cost))
      current_resource_usage = total_resource_budget
```

**API Endpoints:**

*   `/api/swarm/config`: Configure scaling thresholds, resource budget, and priority weighting.
*   `/api/swarm/telemetry`:  Receive telemetry data from test instances.
*   `/api/swarm/status`: Retrieve current swarm size and resource usage.
