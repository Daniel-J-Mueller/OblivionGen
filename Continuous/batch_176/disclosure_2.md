## Dynamic Trust Scoring with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Expand the ‘throttled state’ beyond simply *detecting* aberrant behavior, to proactively *score* user trust in real-time using behavioral biometrics and device trust, dynamically adjusting access levels *before* a traditional ‘throttle’ is even considered. This is a shift from reactive security to predictive security.

**Specs:**

**I. Data Collection Modules:**

*   **Keystroke Dynamics:**
    *   Collect: Inter-key timing, key pressure, duration, and error rates.
    *   Frequency: Continuously during login/session (low-impact background process).
    *   Storage: Encrypted, short-term buffer (e.g., last 30 seconds of typing) for analysis.
*   **Mouse/Touch Movement:**
    *   Collect: Speed, acceleration, trajectory, pressure (if available).
    *   Frequency: Continuously during session.
    *   Storage: Encrypted, short-term buffer.
*   **Device Sensor Data (Optional):**
    *   Collect: Accelerometer, gyroscope (if device supports), ambient light sensor.
    *   Frequency: Sampled periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds).
    *   Storage: Encrypted, short-term buffer.
*   **Network Data:**
    *   Collect: IP address, geolocation (coarse), connection type (WiFi, cellular).
    *   Frequency: On session start/renewal.
    *   Storage: Session-specific metadata.

**II. Trust Scoring Engine:**

*   **Baseline Profile Creation:** Upon initial account creation/first successful login, establish a ‘normal’ behavioral profile for the user. This is a statistical model built from collected data (mean, standard deviation, distributions for all collected metrics).
*   **Real-time Deviation Analysis:** During each session, continuously compare current behavioral metrics to the user's baseline profile. Calculate a 'deviation score' for each metric.
*   **Weighted Trust Score Calculation:** Combine individual deviation scores into a single ‘Trust Score’. Weighting factors are adjustable and configurable based on the perceived importance of each metric (e.g., keystroke dynamics might be weighted higher than mouse movement).
    *   *Trust Score = w1 * KeystrokeDeviation + w2 * MouseDeviation + w3 * NetworkDeviation + …*
*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Based on the Trust Score, dynamically adjust access levels.
    *   *Trust Score > 90%: Full access.*
    *   *60% < Trust Score < 90%: Standard access.*
    *   *30% < Trust Score < 60%: Limited access (e.g., read-only, MFA required for sensitive actions).*
    *   *Trust Score < 30%: Account locked, administrator review required.*

**III. System Architecture:**

*   **Edge Processing:** Initial data collection and basic deviation analysis performed on the client device (browser, mobile app) to minimize latency and bandwidth usage.
*   **Centralized Trust Engine:** Central server responsible for:
    *   Baseline profile management.
    *   Advanced deviation analysis and Trust Score calculation.
    *   Access control policy enforcement.
    *   Anomaly detection and alert generation.
*   **Secure Communication:** All data transmission between client and server encrypted using TLS.

**IV. Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
FUNCTION calculateTrustScore(userID)
  baselineProfile = GET_BASELINE_PROFILE(userID)
  keystrokeDeviation = calculateDeviation(GET_KEYSTROKE_DATA(), baselineProfile.keystrokeData)
  mouseDeviation = calculateDeviation(GET_MOUSE_DATA(), baselineProfile.mouseData)
  networkDeviation = calculateDeviation(GET_NETWORK_DATA(), baselineProfile.networkData)

  trustScore = (weightKeystroke * keystrokeDeviation) + (weightMouse * mouseDeviation) + (weightNetwork * networkDeviation)

  // Normalize trust score to a range of 0-100
  normalizedTrustScore = (trustScore + 100) * (100 / 200)

  RETURN normalizedTrustScore
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateDeviation(currentData, baselineData)
  // Implement a statistical method to calculate the deviation
  // (e.g., Z-score, Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance)
  deviation = ...
  RETURN deviation
END FUNCTION
```

**V.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:** System should continuously learn and adapt to user behavior over time, refining baseline profiles and weighting factors.
*   **Privacy:** Transparency with users about data collection practices and providing options to opt-out (with reduced functionality).
*   **Fraud Detection:**  Integrate with existing fraud detection systems to correlate Trust Score with other risk indicators.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication Integration:**  Dynamically adjust MFA requirements based on Trust Score.
