## Dynamic Spectral Mapping for Biometric Spoofing Detection

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** High-resolution hyperspectral imaging module (400-1000nm), integrated with the existing multi-sensor assembly.  Resolution: 100µm pixel pitch.  Frame rate: 30Hz.
*   **Illumination Array:**  Programmable LED array emitting narrow-band light across the hyperspectral range (10nm bandwidth). LEDs controllable individually for intensity and wavelength.  Array positioned to provide diffuse, uniform illumination of the scanned area.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated FPGA with integrated DSP for real-time spectral analysis and pattern recognition. Minimum 1TB storage for spectral data.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Synchronized acquisition of hyperspectral data, RGB imagery, and infrared imagery.
*   **Sensor Window Enhancement:** Add a polarizing filter layer integrated *within* the sensor window to minimize glare and enhance contrast in the reflected spectral data.

**Innovation Description:**

This system layers hyperspectral imaging *onto* the existing multi-sensor platform to create a highly robust biometric spoofing detection system. The core idea is to map the spectral reflectance signature of the skin (or a potential spoofing material) across a wide range of wavelengths. 

1.  **Spectral Acquisition:** The programmable LED array systematically illuminates the scanned area with narrow-band light. The hyperspectral imager captures the reflected light at each wavelength, creating a 3D spectral cube (x, y, wavelength).
2.  **Feature Extraction:** The processing unit performs advanced spectral analysis on the acquired data. Key features include:
    *   **Spectral Reflectance Curves:** Generation of a unique spectral curve for each pixel.
    *   **Water Absorption Bands:** Analysis of the absorption bands around 970nm and 1450nm to assess hydration levels (a key differentiator between live skin and artificial materials).
    *   **Hemoglobin Absorption Peaks:** Detection of hemoglobin absorption peaks in the visible and near-infrared range to verify blood perfusion (indicating live tissue).
    *   **Collagen and Elastin Signatures:** Identification of spectral signatures associated with collagen and elastin, proteins present in skin but absent in many spoofing materials.
3.  **AI Model Integration:** A pre-trained deep learning model (Convolutional Neural Network) is employed to analyze the extracted spectral features and classify the scanned sample as either ‘live’ or ‘spoof’. The model will be continuously refined with a diverse dataset of spectral signatures from various skin types, ages, and potential spoofing materials.
4.  **Multi-Modal Fusion:** The spectral data is fused with the existing RGB and infrared data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the spoofing detection system. A weighted averaging or more advanced fusion algorithm (e.g., Kalman filtering) can be employed to combine the information from different sensors.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize sensors (Hyperspectral, RGB, IR)

LOOP:
    // Illuminate with first wavelength (LED array control)
    CAPTURE Hyperspectral Image
    // Repeat for all wavelengths in spectral range

    // Extract spectral reflectance curve for each pixel
    // Analyze water, hemoglobin, collagen/elastin signatures

    // Input spectral features + RGB + IR data into AI model
    OUTPUT: "Live" or "Spoof" classification with confidence score

    // Store data for model retraining
END LOOP
```

This approach goes beyond simple pattern recognition and provides a much deeper understanding of the scanned material's composition and properties, making it extremely difficult to bypass with even sophisticated spoofing techniques.
