## Dynamic Proximity-Based Micro-Loyalty System

**Concept:** A system leveraging environmental sensors – specifically, short-range radio frequency (RF) beacons and mobile device accelerometers – to create a dynamic, hyper-local loyalty program. Instead of generalized rewards, users earn micro-rewards simply by *being* near participating merchants at specific times, creating a "passive loyalty" system. This moves beyond traditional point-accumulation and discounts to incentivize foot traffic at slower periods.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Network:** Participating merchants deploy low-power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. These beacons broadcast unique identifiers and time-sensitive "opportunity codes."
*   **Mobile Application:** A dedicated mobile app runs in the background (with user permission). It continuously scans for BLE beacons.
*   **Accelerometer Integration:** The app monitors the device’s accelerometer data. If the device detects a period of inactivity (e.g., the user is stationary) *while* a beacon is detected, this confirms the user is physically present at the location.
*   **"Opportunity Codes":** These codes aren't simple identifiers. They contain:
    *   Merchant ID
    *   Time Window (e.g., 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM)
    *   Reward Value (e.g., 5 "Spark" credits)
    *   Reward Type (e.g., Percentage discount on next purchase, Free item, Entry into a raffle)
*   **"Spark" Credits:** A universal, app-based currency earned through proximity-based rewards.
*   **Dynamic Reward Adjustment:** The system automatically adjusts reward values based on foot traffic. If a merchant is crowded, the reward value decreases. If the merchant is empty, the reward value increases, incentivizing visits.
*   **Gamification Layer:** Points awarded for consecutive visits to the same merchant or for exploring new locations. Leaderboards and challenges further incentivize participation.
*   **API Integration:** Merchants can integrate with the system via an API to track foot traffic, manage rewards, and analyze customer behavior.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** All data collected is anonymized and aggregated. Users have full control over their privacy settings and can opt out of data collection at any time.

**Pseudocode (Mobile App):**

```
// Background Service
Loop {
    Scan for BLE Beacons
    If Beacon Found {
        Get Beacon Data (Merchant ID, Time Window, Reward Value, Reward Type)
        Get Current Time
        If Current Time within Time Window {
            Check Accelerometer Data for Inactivity (e.g., no significant movement for 10 seconds)
            If Inactive {
                Award Reward to User (Add Spark credits, Apply discount code)
                Log Visit to Merchant (Anonymized)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AR Integration:** Overlay AR experiences in the app based on location and reward codes.
*   **Social Sharing:** Allow users to share their rewards and experiences on social media.
*   **Cross-Promotion:** Enable merchants to cross-promote each other’s businesses.
*   **Real-Time Foot Traffic Heatmaps:** Provide merchants with real-time data on foot traffic patterns.
*   **Customizable Opportunity Codes:** Merchants can create custom codes for specific promotions or events.
