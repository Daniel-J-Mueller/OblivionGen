## Dynamic Capability Swapping & Persona Profiles

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond static capability advertisement to allow devices to *dynamically* swap capabilities based on user context (persona) and network conditions. This leverages the cloud discovery system to not just *find* devices with capabilities, but to *transform* devices into having different capabilities on-demand.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Profiles:** User accounts store "Persona" definitions. Personas are sets of preferred capability settings and priority rules. (e.g., "Work Persona" prioritizes conferencing capabilities and silences notifications; "Entertainment Persona" prioritizes high-fidelity audio and display settings).
*   **Capability Modules:**  Devices aren't simply listed with fixed capabilities. They host a library of "Capability Modules". Modules are software packages that unlock specific functionality.  Modules are versioned and managed via the cloud service.
*   **Dynamic Module Activation:**  When a device registers, it advertises *available* Capability Modules, not just active ones. The cloud service, aware of the requesting device's persona, analyzes available modules on registered devices and determines the optimal configuration.
*   **"Capability Request" Protocol:**  The discovery request expands to include a "Desired Persona" field.  The cloud service responds with a "Capability Activation Plan" – a sequence of module activations on the target device(s).
*   **Module Orchestration Engine:**  The target device hosts a "Module Orchestration Engine". This engine receives the activation plan and executes it – downloading, installing, and activating the required modules.  It handles dependencies and potential conflicts.
*   **Resource Negotiation:** If activating a module requires significant resources (e.g., processing power, bandwidth), the engine negotiates with the cloud service and potentially the user to ensure sufficient resources are available.
*   **"Ghost Capability" Provisioning:** The cloud can *provision* capabilities on a device before a request is even made, anticipating needs based on user history and contextual data.  This reduces latency.
*   **Network-Aware Module Selection:**  The cloud prioritizes module activations based on network conditions.  For example, if bandwidth is limited, it might activate lower-resolution video codecs or prioritize audio streaming.

**Pseudocode (Module Orchestration Engine):**

```
function activate_module(module_id, activation_plan):
    if module_id in installed_modules:
        enable_module(module_id)
        return

    if module_id in available_modules:
        download_module(module_id)
        install_module(module_id)
        enable_module(module_id)
        return

    request_module_download(module_id)  // Request from cloud service
    download_module(module_id)
    install_module(module_id)
    enable_module(module_id)
    return

function enable_module(module_id):
    // Load module's code and configurations
    // Modify device's runtime to activate the module's functionality

function download_module(module_id):
    // Download module package from cloud storage

function install_module(module_id):
    // Extract module package and install dependencies
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Adaptive Home Automation:** Devices dynamically adjust functionality based on user activity and time of day.
*   **Context-Aware Conferencing:** Meeting room devices automatically configure optimal audio/video settings based on the number of participants and their location.
*   **Mobile Device Customization:**  A phone transforms its interface and functionality based on the user's current task (e.g., driving mode, reading mode, gaming mode).
*   **Temporary Feature Unlocks:**  Offer trial periods or one-time access to premium features by dynamically activating modules.
