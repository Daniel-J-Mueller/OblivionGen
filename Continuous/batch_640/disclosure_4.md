## Real-Time Neural Network "Autopsy" & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the real-time visualization to include a system capable of performing a “neural network autopsy” – analyzing internal states to predict impending performance degradation or failure *before* it manifests as a loss function spike. This goes beyond simply *showing* metrics; it *interprets* them.

**Specs:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Internal State Logging:**  Modify training nodes to log not only loss function values and parameter values (as in the base patent) but also activation maps from key layers (user configurable - e.g., all convolutional layers, or a specific selection). Log these at defined intervals (e.g., every 100 iterations).
*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Implement a suite of dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) to compress activation map data.  The visualization manager must allow the user to dynamically select the desired technique and parameters. This reduces data volume for real-time analysis.
*   **Anomaly Detection Baseline:** Establish a “healthy” baseline for internal state representations. This could involve averaging internal states over a defined “burn-in” period of successful training, or using autoencoders to learn a compressed representation of normal behavior.

**II.  Real-Time Analysis Engine:**

*   **Deviation Scoring:**  Calculate a “deviation score” representing the difference between the current internal state representation (after dimensionality reduction) and the established baseline.  Multiple distance metrics (Euclidean, cosine similarity, etc.) should be available.
*   **Failure Mode Classification:** Train a lightweight classifier (e.g., decision tree, SVM) on historical deviation scores and corresponding failure modes (e.g., overfitting, vanishing gradients, dataset shift).  The classifier predicts the *type* of impending failure.
*   **Predictive Horizon:** Implement a time series analysis module (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) to extrapolate deviation scores into the future. This provides a predictive horizon, indicating *when* failure is likely to occur.

**III. Visualization Interface Enhancements:**

*   **Deviation Heatmaps:**  Display deviation scores as heatmaps overlaid on network architecture diagrams. High deviation scores highlight layers or neurons contributing most to the predicted failure.
*   **Predictive Failure Timeline:** Show a timeline visualizing the predicted failure horizon, including confidence intervals.
*   **“What-If” Analysis:**  Allow users to simulate the impact of different training interventions (e.g., learning rate adjustment, data augmentation) on the predicted failure horizon.
*   **Automated Alerting:** Configure automated alerts to notify users when deviation scores exceed predefined thresholds or when the predictive failure horizon falls below a critical level.

**Pseudocode (Core Analysis Loop):**

```
FOR each training iteration:
    Get activation maps from selected layers
    Apply dimensionality reduction
    Calculate deviation score from baseline
    Predict failure mode using classifier
    Extrapolate deviation score (predictive horizon)
    Update visualization interface
    IF alert conditions met:
        Trigger alert
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond *observing* training to *predicting* and *diagnosing* issues *before* they affect performance.  It's akin to a medical diagnostic tool for neural networks, going beyond simply displaying vital signs to offering a prognosis. The "what-if" analysis and automated alerting provide actionable insights for proactive intervention.
