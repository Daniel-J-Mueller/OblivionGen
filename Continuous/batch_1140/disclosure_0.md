## Adaptive Query Rewriting with Probabilistic Predicate Selection

**Concept:** Extend the disjunctive join condition optimization by incorporating a probabilistic model to *dynamically* rewrite queries at runtime, selecting the most promising disjuncts based on real-time data statistics and query execution history. This aims to reduce the exploration of less likely execution paths, improving performance beyond static plan optimization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Statistics Collection Module:**

*   **Purpose:** Continuously monitor and gather statistics on table data distributions, correlation between columns, and historical query execution data.
*   **Data Points:**
    *   Cardinality estimates for each table.
    *   Min/Max values for key columns.
    *   Column value frequency distributions (histograms).
    *   Correlation coefficients between columns across tables.
    *   Query execution times for various disjuncts.
    *   Frequency of query execution with specific predicate combinations.
*   **Implementation:** Background process that samples data periodically or on data updates. Utilizes lightweight data structures to minimize overhead.

**2. Probabilistic Predicate Selection Model:**

*   **Type:** Bayesian Network or similar probabilistic graphical model.
*   **Nodes:** Represent individual disjuncts within the query's disjunctive join condition.
*   **Edges:** Represent statistical dependencies between disjuncts (derived from data statistics).
*   **Parameters:** Probabilities representing the likelihood of a disjunct being the most efficient execution path given the query predicates and data statistics.
*   **Training:** Model is trained on historical query execution data and continuously updated with new data.

**3. Query Rewriting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Original query with disjunctive join condition, current data statistics, and trained probabilistic model.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Analyze the query and identify the disjunctive join condition.
    2.  Query the probabilistic model to obtain predicted probabilities for each disjunct.
    3.  Based on these probabilities, rewrite the query to prioritize the most promising disjuncts. This could involve:
        *   Reordering the disjuncts in the query plan to execute the most likely ones first.
        *   Materializing intermediate results for highly probable disjuncts to avoid redundant computation.
        *   Filtering out disjuncts with extremely low probabilities.
    4.  Generate the optimized query plan.

**4. Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism:**

*   **Purpose:** Monitor the performance of the rewritten query and dynamically adjust the probabilistic model and query plan if necessary.
*   **Metrics:** Query execution time, resource utilization, and data access patterns.
*   **Adjustment Strategies:**
    *   Increase the probability of a disjunct that consistently performs well.
    *   Decrease the probability of a disjunct that consistently performs poorly.
    *   Switch to a different query plan if the current plan is not performing well.

**Pseudocode (Query Rewriting Engine):**

```
function rewrite_query(query, data_stats, probabilistic_model):
    disjunctive_condition = extract_disjunctive_condition(query)
    disjunct_probabilities = probabilistic_model.predict(disjunctive_condition, data_stats)

    // Sort disjuncts by probability (descending)
    sorted_disjuncts = sort_by_probability(disjunct_probabilities)

    // Prioritize disjuncts in the query plan
    rewritten_query = prioritize_disjuncts(query, sorted_disjuncts)

    return rewritten_query
```
