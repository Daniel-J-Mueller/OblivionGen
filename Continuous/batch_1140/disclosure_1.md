## Adaptive Projection Mapping for Dynamic Environments

**Concept:** Expand the ability to determine relative device positioning by dynamically projecting augmented reality ‘markers’ onto the environment *from* the devices themselves, rather than relying solely on passively detected identifiers. These projections would be invisible to the naked eye (e.g., utilizing infrared or UV light) but detectable by the cameras of other devices. This creates a reciprocal positioning system, boosting accuracy and enabling functionality in areas with limited or no pre-existing reference points.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Low-power, high-frequency micro-projector integrated into each device. Capable of projecting modulated infrared or UV light patterns. (Consider pico-projector tech with modified emitters)
    *   Enhanced camera module with spectral filtering to specifically detect projected patterns (IR/UV).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – high precision accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Projection Pattern Generator:** Algorithm to create unique, time-varying projection patterns. Patterns should be designed for rapid identification and geometric calculation. Utilize a pseudo-random number generator seeded with device ID to ensure uniqueness.
    *   **Pattern Recognition Module:** Algorithm to detect and decode projected patterns in camera feed. Employ computer vision techniques (e.g., feature detection, template matching) optimized for low-light/specific spectra conditions.
    *   **Sensor Fusion Engine:** Integrate IMU data with visual pattern recognition data. Kalman filtering or similar techniques to smooth and refine position estimates. Account for device movement and environmental noise.
    *   **Communication Protocol:** Wireless protocol for devices to exchange projection pattern data (device ID, projection parameters). Bluetooth Low Energy or similar for minimal power consumption.
    *   **Dynamic Mapping System:** Maintain a local map of detected devices and their estimated positions. Update the map in real-time as devices move and new projections are detected.

**Pseudocode – Core Positioning Loop (Executed on Each Device):**

```
Initialize:
    device_id = GetDeviceID()
    projection_pattern = GenerateUniquePattern(device_id)

Loop:
    1.  Project projection_pattern onto surrounding environment (IR/UV)
    2.  Capture camera feed
    3.  Detect projected patterns from other devices in camera feed
    4.  For each detected pattern:
        a.  Get device_id from detected pattern
        b.  Calculate relative position based on pattern geometry
        c.  Update local map with new/updated position
    5.  Read IMU data
    6.  Use sensor fusion to refine position estimates
    7.  Broadcast device_id and current projection parameters (for improved detection)
    8.  Repeat
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Environmental Awareness:** Integrate data from ambient light sensors and depth cameras to improve projection pattern visibility and accuracy. Adjust projection brightness and pattern geometry based on environmental conditions.
*   **Multi-Spectral Projection:** Utilize multiple wavelengths of light (e.g., IR and UV) to create more robust and secure positioning systems.
*   **Occlusion Handling:** Implement algorithms to estimate device positions even when they are partially obscured by objects.
*   **Collaborative Mapping:** Allow multiple devices to share their local maps to create a larger, more comprehensive map of the environment.
*   **Security:** Employ encryption and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized devices from spoofing their positions.
