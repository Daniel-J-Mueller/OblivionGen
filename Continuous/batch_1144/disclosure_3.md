## Dynamic Node Coloring for Predictive Failure Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the node coloring scheme described in claim 3 by making it *dynamic* and *predictive*, tied to real-time system health and anticipated failure scenarios. Instead of static color assignments dictating communication pathways, nodes transition between colors based on monitored metrics and probabilistic failure predictions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Prediction Module:**

*   **Metrics:** Collect the following metrics from each node: CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network latency, error rates (disk, network, application), and historical performance data.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Implement a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict potential failures.  Model outputs a "failure probability score" for each node over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., next hour, next day).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Employ an anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify unusual behavior patterns that may indicate an impending failure, even if the forecasting model doesnâ€™t explicitly predict it.

**2. Dynamic Coloring Engine:**

*   **Color Mapping:** Define a color palette (e.g., Red, Yellow, Green, Blue).
*   **Color Assignment Logic:**
    *   **Green:** Node is healthy (low CPU, memory, errors, normal network latency).
    *   **Yellow:** Node exhibits warning signs (moderate CPU/memory, increased error rate, slightly elevated latency).
    *   **Red:** Node is nearing critical failure (high CPU/memory, high error rate, high latency, prediction model indicates high failure probability).
    *   **Blue:** Nodes actively flagged as likely to *cause* failures in others (e.g. if a node consistently sends corrupt data, it's colored blue to signal isolation).
*   **Transition Rules:**  Implement rules governing color transitions based on metric values and prediction scores.  Transitions should be continuous and responsive to changing conditions. A hysteresis factor should be applied to prevent rapid color oscillations.
*   **Color Propagation:** When a node changes color, proactively adjust the color of its immediate neighbors to optimize communication pathways and isolate potential issues.

**3. Communication Routing Layer:**

*   **Color-Aware Routing:** Modify the communication routing layer to prioritize communication between nodes of the same color, while minimizing communication with nodes of different colors.  For instance, traffic is *always* routed around red nodes.
*   **Adaptive Routing:** Implement an adaptive routing algorithm that dynamically adjusts communication paths based on node colors and network conditions.
*   **Quorum Adjustments:**  If a node turns red, the system should automatically attempt to shift quorum responsibilities to healthy nodes.

**4.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Storage:** Use a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) to store collected metrics.
*   **Programming Languages:** Python for data processing and machine learning, Go or Rust for high-performance routing layer.
*   **API:** Provide an API for monitoring node colors and dynamically adjusting routing configurations.

**Pseudocode (Color Assignment Logic):**

```
function assign_color(node):
  cpu_util = get_cpu_utilization(node)
  memory_util = get_memory_utilization(node)
  error_rate = get_error_rate(node)
  failure_prob = get_failure_probability(node)

  if cpu_util > 0.8 or memory_util > 0.8 or error_rate > 0.05 or failure_prob > 0.5:
    color = RED
  elif cpu_util > 0.5 or memory_util > 0.5 or error_rate > 0.01:
    color = YELLOW
  else:
    color = GREEN

  return color
```

**Novelty:** The dynamic and predictive coloring scheme allows the system to proactively mitigate failures by isolating potentially problematic nodes and adjusting communication pathways *before* a failure occurs. This is beyond static coloring as described in the patent. The predictive aspect, leveraging machine learning for failure probability estimation, adds a significant layer of intelligence and resilience.
