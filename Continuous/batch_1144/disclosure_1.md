## Dynamic Contextual ‘Shadow Modules’

**Concept:** Expand the modular content selection to include ‘shadow modules’ – modules that *observe* user interaction with currently displayed content without directly serving content themselves. These shadow modules build contextual profiles, allowing the primary selection modules to dynamically adjust their scoring and prioritization *during* a single displayable file’s lifetime, beyond initial scoring. This is a departure from static scoring based solely on historical data.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Types:** Define two core module types: ‘Active’ (content-serving) and ‘Shadow’ (observation-only).
*   **Shadow Module Functionality:**
    *   **Observation Metrics:** Shadow modules track granular user interactions: dwell time, scrolling depth, clicks, zoom levels, specific element interactions (e.g., video play/pause, image details), and even mouse movement patterns.
    *   **Contextual Profile Building:** Shadow modules aggregate observed interactions into a real-time contextual profile for the *current* displayable file session. This profile represents the user’s immediate interests and engagement patterns *within that specific context*.
    *   **Profile Transmission:** Shadow modules transmit their contextual profile to a central ‘Contextual Adjustment Engine’ (CAE). This transmission happens continuously, or at defined intervals (e.g. every 5 seconds, after a significant interaction).
*   **Contextual Adjustment Engine (CAE):**
    *   **Scoring Modifier:** The CAE receives contextual profiles from active shadow modules. It uses this data to *dynamically adjust* the scoring of active content-serving modules.
    *   **Adjustment Logic:** The logic will be a weighted system. Higher weighting is given to metrics considered most indicative of engagement. For example:
        *   Long dwell time on specific content = increase score of modules serving similar content.
        *   Rapid scrolling past content = decrease score of modules serving similar content.
        *   Specific element interaction (e.g., zooming on product image) = drastically increase score of modules serving similar items.
    *   **Prioritization Adjustment:**  The CAE doesn't just adjust scores; it can also *temporarily* adjust the priority of modules.  If a user consistently ignores a certain type of content, that module's priority might be lowered for the duration of the session.
*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The CAE sits between the module selection system and the active content-serving modules.
    *   Before selecting a module, the system queries the CAE for adjusted scores and priorities.
    *   The selection algorithm then uses these adjusted values to make its decision.

**Pseudocode (CAE Core Logic):**

```
function adjust_module_scores(module_list, contextual_profile):
  adjusted_scores = {}
  for module in module_list:
    base_score = module.score
    adjustment_factor = 0.0
    # Example: Dwell Time Adjustment
    dwell_time_weight = 0.2
    dwell_time = contextual_profile.get_dwell_time(module.content_type)
    adjustment_factor += dwell_time * dwell_time_weight

    # Example: Interaction Frequency Adjustment
    interaction_frequency_weight = 0.3
    interaction_count = contextual_profile.get_interaction_count(module.content_type)
    adjustment_factor += interaction_count * interaction_frequency_weight

    # Apply adjustment factor
    adjusted_score = base_score + adjustment_factor
    adjusted_scores[module.id] = adjusted_score

  return adjusted_scores
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static scoring based on historical data and introduces *real-time contextual adaptation*. It leverages passive observation modules to dynamically refine content selection during a single user session, potentially leading to significantly improved engagement and personalization. The idea is to create a learning loop that happens *during* the experience, rather than solely relying on past behavior.
