## Dynamic Haptic Feedback System - 'Feel the Distance'

**Core Concept:** Extend the distance-based UI adaptation from the patent by incorporating dynamic haptic feedback on the device, modulating intensity and texture based on perceived user distance. This aims to create a more intuitive and immersive interaction experience beyond visual changes.

**Device Specs:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** Integrate a high-resolution haptic actuator array beneath the entire display surface. This will require miniaturization and careful power management. Target resolution: 20 actuators per square inch.
*   **Proximity & Facial Tracking:** Utilize existing camera/sensor setup (as per patent) for distance estimation and facial tracking. Supplement with an infrared proximity sensor for increased accuracy, particularly in low-light conditions.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated processor core for real-time haptic pattern generation and control. Must interface seamlessly with the device’s main processor and sensor data.
*   **Software Library:** A comprehensive library of haptic textures and patterns, categorized by perceived distance and content type.

**Operation & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Distance Calculation:** The device continuously estimates user distance via camera/sensor fusion (as described in the base patent).
2.  **Content Analysis:** Analyze the currently displayed content (list, image, text, etc.).
3.  **Haptic Profile Selection:** Based on distance *and* content, select an appropriate haptic profile from the library.  Example Profiles:
    *   **Close (1-3ft):**  Fine-grained textures for list items, subtle vibrations for interactive elements.
    *   **Medium (3-7ft):**  Slightly broader textures, more pronounced vibrations for notifications.
    *   **Far (7-10ft):**  Minimal haptic feedback, focused on critical alerts or confirmations.
4.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:** Generate a specific haptic pattern based on the selected profile and the user interaction.  
5.  **Actuator Control:**  Send control signals to the haptic actuator array to generate the desired haptic effect.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Profile Selection):**

```
FUNCTION SelectHapticProfile(distance, content_type)

  IF distance <= 3 feet THEN
    IF content_type == "list" THEN
      RETURN "list_fine_texture"
    ELSE IF content_type == "image" THEN
      RETURN "image_subtle_vibration"
    ELSE
      RETURN "default_close"
    END IF
  ELSE IF distance <= 7 feet THEN
    IF content_type == "list" THEN
      RETURN "list_medium_texture"
    ELSE IF content_type == "notification" THEN
      RETURN "notification_pulse"
    ELSE
      RETURN "default_medium"
    END IF
  ELSE
    RETURN "default_far"
  END IF

END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**

The patent focuses on *visual* adaptation based on distance. This extends that by adding *haptic* adaptation. This combined sensory approach aims to create a more holistic and intuitive user experience. The granular control over the haptic array allows for complex textures and patterns, enhancing the sense of immersion and providing valuable feedback to the user.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Haptic Profiles:** Allow users to customize haptic profiles based on their preferences.
*   **Directional Haptics:** Utilize the haptic array to create directional feedback, guiding the user's attention to specific elements on the screen.
*   **Contextual Haptics:** Integrate with other sensors (e.g., accelerometer) to provide haptic feedback based on the device’s orientation and movement.
*   **Accessibility:** Fine-tune haptic patterns to be discernable for people with impaired vision.
