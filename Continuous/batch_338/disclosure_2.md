## Dynamic Wireless Network Segmentation via Bioacoustic Profiling

**Concept:** Implement a dynamic network segmentation system that leverages the unique "bioacoustic profile" of each wireless device – not audio *from* the device, but the subtle RF “signature” created by its internal components during operation. This signature is used to create dynamically adjusted network segments, improving security and mitigating insider threats *beyond* simple disconnect frame prevention.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on identifying malicious disconnect frames. This idea moves *proactively* by constantly assessing device authenticity and behavior, creating micro-segments based on continuously updated trust scores. It's more granular than typical VLANs or access control lists.

**System Components:**

1.  **RF Signature Acquisition Module (RSAM):** Integrated into the WAP. This module continuously monitors the RF emissions *of* connected devices during normal operation (beaconing, data exchange). It captures subtle variations in frequency, phase, amplitude, and timing jitter of the RF signal.  This is *not* standard signal strength – it’s a highly detailed analysis of the radio’s ‘fingerprint.’ 
2.  **Bioacoustic Profile Generator (BPG):** A dedicated processor (FPGA preferred) that analyzes the data from the RSAM. It extracts features (statistical moments, wavelet transforms, spectral characteristics) and constructs a unique ‘bioacoustic profile’ for each device.  This profile is a multi-dimensional vector representing the device’s RF fingerprint.
3.  **Trust Score Engine (TSE):**  Calculates a trust score for each device based on:
    *   **Profile Similarity:**  How closely the current bioacoustic profile matches the device’s established baseline profile. Significant deviation indicates potential tampering or device compromise.
    *   **Behavioral Anomalies:** Detects unusual data transmission patterns, access attempts, or resource utilization.
    *   **Historical Data:** Incorporates a history of trust scores and behavioral data for each device.
4.  **Dynamic Segmentation Manager (DSM):**  Controls network segmentation based on trust scores.
    *   **High Trust:** Devices remain on the primary network with full access.
    *   **Medium Trust:** Devices are moved to a restricted segment with limited access to resources.
    *   **Low Trust:** Devices are isolated or disconnected from the network.
5.  **Secure Profile Storage:** Encrypted storage for baseline bioacoustic profiles and historical data.

**Pseudocode (DSM Logic):**

```
// Device connects
deviceID = getDeviceID()
baselineProfile = loadBaselineProfile(deviceID)
currentProfile = acquireCurrentProfile()

trustScore = calculateTrustScore(baselineProfile, currentProfile)

IF trustScore > 0.8 THEN
    segment = PRIMARY_NETWORK
ELSE IF trustScore > 0.5 THEN
    segment = RESTRICTED_NETWORK
ELSE
    segment = ISOLATED_NETWORK
ENDIF

assignDeviceToSegment(deviceID, segment)
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The system requires significant processing power for real-time profile analysis. FPGA acceleration is highly recommended.
*   Baseline profiles must be established during device onboarding or initial network connection.
*   The algorithm must be robust against environmental noise and RF interference.
*   Regular profile updates are needed to account for device aging and component drift.
*   The system can be integrated with existing network security infrastructure (firewalls, intrusion detection systems).
