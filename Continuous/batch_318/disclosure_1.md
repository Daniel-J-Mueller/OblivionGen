## Adaptive Data Sheet Scaffolding

**Concept:** Dynamically generate and manage 'scaffolding' around data sheets to provide contextual tooling and intelligent assistance. This expands beyond simple expression evaluation to offer a proactive, user-guided experience directly within the data sheet interface.

**Specification:**

**1. Scaffolding Components:**

*   **Tool Palettes:** Context-sensitive palettes appear around selected cells or ranges, presenting relevant functions, formulas, or data transformations. Palettes are dynamically populated based on cell type, data content, and user role/permissions.
*   **Guidance Overlays:**  Subtle overlays appear on cells or ranges, providing hints, warnings, or suggested actions. These could indicate data quality issues (e.g., potential outliers, missing values), suggest related calculations, or highlight dependencies.
*   **Dynamic Mini-Views:** Small, embedded views display related data or visualizations directly within the data sheet.  For example, selecting a product ID cell might display a mini-chart of its recent sales performance.
*   **Actionable Annotations:** Users can create annotations directly on cells, triggering automated workflows or data updates.  An annotation flagging a price discrepancy could automatically initiate a price validation process.

**2.  Scaffolding Engine:**

*   **Context Analyzer:**  Analyzes cell content, data types, relationships to other cells, and user activity to determine relevant scaffolding elements.
*   **Rule Engine:**  Defines rules that map specific contexts to specific scaffolding elements. Rules can be customized based on user roles, data domains, and business requirements.
*   **Scaffolding Renderer:**  Dynamically renders the selected scaffolding elements within the data sheet interface.
*   **Expression-Awareness Module:** Integrates with the existing expression evaluation system to understand the impact of changes and proactively suggest updates or corrections.

**3.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Sheet Extension API:**  A new API allows third-party developers to create custom scaffolding elements and integrate them into the data sheet environment.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:**  Leverage machine learning to identify patterns and suggest relevant scaffolding elements based on user behavior and data trends.
*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to customize the scaffolding environment by creating their own rules, adding custom scaffolding elements, and configuring the appearance of the interface.

**4. Pseudocode (Scaffolding Engine - Context Analyzer):**

```
function analyzeContext(cellData, cellMetadata, userProfile):
  context = {}

  // Data Type Analysis
  if (cellMetadata.dataType == "numeric"):
    context.dataType = "numeric"
    context.potentialFunctions = ["sum", "average", "max", "min", "standard deviation"]
  else if (cellMetadata.dataType == "text"):
    context.dataType = "text"
    context.potentialFunctions = ["string manipulation", "data validation"]

  // Relationship Analysis (check adjacent cells and referenced expressions)
  relationships = findRelationships(cellData)
  context.relationships = relationships

  // Expression Analysis
  expressions = getExpressionsReferencingCell(cellData)
  context.expressions = expressions

  // User Role Analysis
  context.userRole = userProfile.role

  // AI-Powered Recommendations (optional)
  recommendations = getRecommendations(context)
  context.recommendations = recommendations

  return context
```

**5. Integration with Existing System:**

The Adaptive Data Sheet Scaffolding system builds upon the existing expression evaluation system. The scaffolding engine uses the expression identifiers to understand data dependencies and provide context-aware assistance. When a user interacts with a scaffolding element, the system leverages the expression evaluation system to perform calculations, update data, or trigger workflows. The system aims to make the data sheet more than just a grid of cells, transforming it into a dynamic, intelligent workspace that empowers users to analyze, interpret, and act on data.
