## Dynamic Obstacle Resonance Mapping & Predictive Avoidance

**Concept:** Extend the occupancy map beyond static inflation to include *dynamic* obstacle response modeling. Instead of simply inflating obstacle size, predict obstacle *movement* based on sensor data (beyond just presence) and incorporate that predicted trajectory into the navigation map. This moves beyond simply avoiding *current* obstacles to anticipating and avoiding potential future collisions.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Requires addition of at least one of: Doppler radar, lidar with velocity measurement, or stereoscopic cameras capable of accurate velocity estimation. Existing camera can contribute to velocity estimation via optical flow.
*   **Obstacle Classification & Prediction Module:**  AI model trained to classify obstacles (pedestrian, cyclist, vehicle, static object) and *predict* their likely movement.  Inputs: sensor data, obstacle classification, historical movement data (if available).  Output: Predicted trajectory (series of future positions with associated probability).
*   **Resonance Mapping:** The navigation map isn't built by static inflation, but by modeling a ‘resonance’ around each predicted obstacle trajectory. This resonance expands and contracts based on predicted velocity and probability. Fast-moving, high-probability obstacles create a larger, rapidly shifting resonance. Slow-moving or low-probability obstacles create a smaller, more stable resonance.
*   **Path Planning with Resonance Consideration:**  Path planning algorithm modified to *actively avoid* the resonance areas, not just the static inflated obstacle shapes.  Cost function weights the resonance probability and magnitude to prioritize avoidance of high-risk areas.  Algorithm needs to consider the time horizon of the prediction – longer horizons are more uncertain and require greater safety margins.
*   **Real-time Adaptation:** The prediction and resonance mapping must operate in real-time, constantly updating as new sensor data becomes available. Implement a Kalman filter or similar state estimator to fuse sensor data and improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Computational Requirements:** High – requires significant processing power for sensor fusion, AI inference, and real-time map updates. Target hardware: dedicated GPU or edge AI accelerator.

**Pseudocode - Resonance Map Update:**

```
function update_resonance_map(obstacle_data, current_map, time_delta):
  for obstacle in obstacle_data:
    obstacle_type = classify_obstacle(obstacle)
    predicted_trajectory = predict_trajectory(obstacle, obstacle_type)

    for point in predicted_trajectory:
      x, y, z, time_to_impact, probability = point

      resonance_radius = calculate_resonance_radius(obstacle_type, probability, velocity)
      for i in range(-resonance_radius, resonance_radius + 1):
        for j in range(-resonance_radius, resonance_radius + 1):
          map_x = x + i
          map_y = y + j

          current_map[map_x][map_y] = max(current_map[map_x][map_y], probability)
  return current_map
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Cooperative Mapping:** Share predicted obstacle trajectories between multiple AMDs to create a more comprehensive and accurate predictive map.
*   **Human-Like Anticipation:**  Train the AI model to anticipate human behavior (e.g., pedestrians looking at crosswalks) to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Dynamic Safety Margins:** Adjust the safety margins based on the AMD's speed and the perceived risk level.  Higher speeds require larger safety margins.
