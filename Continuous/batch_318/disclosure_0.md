## Adaptive Communication Filtering & Prioritization System

**Concept:** Extend the voice-controlled communication request system to dynamically filter and prioritize incoming requests based on contextual awareness and user-defined urgency levels. This goes beyond simple acceptance/rejection and introduces a nuanced system where requests are handled *differently* depending on the situation.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Awareness Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Device sensor data (location, motion, ambient sound, time of day).
    *   Calendar integration (meetings, appointments).
    *   Connected app data (e.g., driving mode detected via car integration, 'Do Not Disturb' status).
    *   User-defined profiles (work, home, travel, etc.).
*   **Processing:** A rule-based engine combined with machine learning algorithms assesses the current context. The ML models are trained on user interaction data (accepted/rejected requests in various contexts).
*   **Output:** A contextual "sensitivity" score (0-100) reflecting how disruptive an incoming communication would be.

**2. Urgency Level Assignment:**

*   **Initiating Device Input:** The *sender* assigns an urgency level to the request (Low, Medium, High, Emergency) via voice command or UI selection.
*   **Server Validation:** The server utilizes a reputation system. Frequent misuse of "Emergency" flags results in sender prioritization penalties.

**3. Adaptive Filtering & Routing:**

*   **Incoming Request Processing:** The server receives the communication request, urgency level, and context.
*   **Combined Score:** A "Disruption Score" is calculated: `Disruption Score = Urgency Level Weight * Urgency + Context Sensitivity Weight * Context Sensitivity`.  Weights are user-configurable.
*   **Action Determination:** Based on the Disruption Score:
    *   **Low Score:** Request is silently queued for later review. User receives a summarized notification ("You have pending communications").
    *   **Medium Score:** Request triggers a brief, non-intrusive notification (haptic feedback, subtle visual cue).  User can choose to accept, reject, or snooze.
    *   **High Score:**  Standard acceptance/rejection prompt (as in the original patent).
    *   **Emergency Score:** Immediate interruption of current activity, overriding all settings. (Requires explicit user confirmation to dismiss).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously learns from user behavior.  If a user consistently ignores "Medium" requests in a specific context, the context sensitivity score is adjusted downward.

**4.  "Communication Bubbles" - Visual & Audio Queuing**

*   Instead of direct prompts, introduce "Communication Bubbles" on the user’s device screen.
*   These bubbles visually represent incoming requests, colored by urgency (Green=Low, Yellow=Medium, Red=Emergency).
*   Users can swipe or tap the bubbles to view details and respond.  
*   Audio cues accompany the bubbles – a soft chime for low, a gentle alert for medium, and a clear signal for emergency.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Filtering Logic):**

```
function determineAction(urgencyLevel, contextSensitivity, userConfigurableWeights) {
  urgencyWeight = userConfigurableWeights.urgencyWeight;
  contextWeight = userConfigurableWeights.contextWeight;

  disruptionScore = (urgencyLevel * urgencyWeight) + (contextSensitivity * contextWeight);

  if (disruptionScore <= 30) {
    return "Queue for Later Review";
  } else if (disruptionScore <= 60) {
    return "Non-Intrusive Notification";
  } else if (disruptionScore <= 80) {
    return "Standard Acceptance/Rejection Prompt";
  } else {
    return "Immediate Interruption";
  }
}
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Integration with wearable devices for more granular context awareness (heart rate, activity levels).
*   "Trusted Contacts" list – certain contacts can bypass filtering rules.
*   "Communication Delegation" –  allow users to delegate communication handling to an assistant or another user.
