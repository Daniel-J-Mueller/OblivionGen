## Haptic Feedback Array - Modular & Reconfigurable

**Concept:** An electronic input device featuring a dynamically reconfigurable array of micro-haptic actuators embedded *within* the device casing, allowing for localized tactile feedback that isn't tied to a fixed button or surface. The array’s configuration is software-defined, creating 'virtual' buttons, sliders, or textured surfaces *anywhere* on the device.

**Specs:**

*   **Actuator Type:** Piezoelectric benders – chosen for their low power consumption, fast response time, and compact size. Density: 50 actuators per square centimeter.
*   **Array Dimensions:** Minimum 8cm x 8cm active area. Modular – comprised of 4cm x 4cm tiles that can be linked to create larger, custom-shaped surfaces.
*   **Control System:**  Microcontroller with dedicated DMA channels for real-time waveform generation and individual actuator control.
*   **Communication:** I2C/SPI interface for communication with host device.
*   **Power:** 3.3V/5V operation.  Individual actuator power control to minimize energy consumption.
*   **Software Interface:**  API allowing developers to:
    *   Define arbitrary “virtual” control regions.
    *   Assign haptic effects (vibration, texture simulation, force feedback) to these regions.
    *   Dynamically reconfigure the array layout.
*   **Casing Material:** Flexible polymer (TPU) over a rigid internal frame.  This allows for slight deformation of the device casing to enhance haptic perception.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Capacitive proximity sensors above the array. Allows the system to detect finger position and dynamically adjust haptic feedback accordingly.
*   **Waveform Generation:** System supports pre-defined haptic waveforms (pulse, sawtooth, sine) and allows for custom waveform upload. 

**Pseudocode (Haptic Effect Application):**

```
FUNCTION ApplyHapticEffect(x_coordinate, y_coordinate, effect_type, intensity)

  // Determine the actuators to activate based on the coordinates
  actuator_list = GetActuatorsNear(x_coordinate, y_coordinate)

  // Map the effect type to a waveform
  waveform = MapEffectToWaveform(effect_type)

  // Scale the waveform amplitude based on the intensity
  scaled_waveform = ScaleWaveform(waveform, intensity)

  // Send the scaled waveform to the actuators in the list
  FOR EACH actuator IN actuator_list
    SendWaveformToActuator(actuator, scaled_waveform)
  END FOR

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION GetActuatorsNear(x, y)
    //Algorithm to find nearest actuators based on x,y coords
    //returns list of actuators
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION MapEffectToWaveform(effect_type)
    //Mapping of various effects to waveforms
    //returns waveform
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ScaleWaveform(waveform, intensity)
    //Scales waveform based on intensity
    //returns scaled waveform
END FUNCTION
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond fixed haptic feedback points. The reconfigurable array allows for completely custom and dynamic interfaces. Imagine a device where the "buttons" appear only when needed, or a slider that smoothly transitions between different textures. This allows for a tactile experience that is intuitive, immersive, and adaptable to a wide range of applications.
