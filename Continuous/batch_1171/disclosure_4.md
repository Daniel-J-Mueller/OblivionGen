## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction via Multi-Device Phase Coherence

**Concept:** Leverage the phase information of audio signals captured by multiple devices (as described in the patent) to reconstruct a 3D acoustic "point cloud" representing the sound source and surrounding environment. This goes beyond simply identifying the closest device; it aims to *map* the acoustic space.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum 3 synchronized audio capture devices (microphones). More devices yield higher resolution reconstructions.
    *   High-precision time synchronization between devices (e.g., via PTP – Precision Time Protocol – or dedicated hardware sync).  Resolution of <100ns crucial.
    *   Processing unit with sufficient computational power for real-time FFT and beamforming operations.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Phase Extraction Module:**  Performs Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on audio data from each device.  Extracts phase information for each frequency bin.
    *   **Cross-Correlation & Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) Estimation:** Computes cross-correlation between phase spectra of different device pairs. Precisely estimates TDOA for each frequency bin. Utilize a robust phase alignment algorithm to mitigate phase ambiguity.
    *   **3D Localization:**  Triangulate the sound source position based on TDOA estimates from multiple device pairs. Employ a Least Squares or Kalman Filter approach for robust and accurate localization.  Account for microphone array geometry.
    *   **Acoustic Mapping (Point Cloud Generation):**  Extend the single point localization to map the soundscape.
        *   Divide the frequency spectrum into bands.
        *   For each band, calculate the sound source location.
        *   Assign a 'density' value to each location based on signal strength (amplitude).
        *   Generate a 3D point cloud where point density reflects acoustic energy distribution.
    *   **Environmental Feature Extraction:** Analyze the point cloud to identify and categorize acoustic features:
        *   Room dimensions (via reflections detected in the point cloud).
        *   Object detection (based on localized reflections and sound occlusion).
        *   Material identification (based on frequency-dependent reflection characteristics).
    *   **Real-time Streaming/Visualization:** Stream the generated 3D acoustic map to a visualization engine (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine) for real-time rendering.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Mapping):**

```pseudocode
// Input: Audio streams from multiple devices (deviceArray)
// Output: 3D Acoustic Point Cloud

function generateAcousticMap(deviceArray):
    pointCloud = empty 3D Point Cloud

    for frequencyBand in frequencyBands:
        for devicePair in devicePairs: // All possible device combinations
            tdoa = calculateTDOA(devicePair, frequencyBand)
            location = triangulateLocation(tdoa, devicePair.geometry) //Using device positions
            amplitude = calculateAmplitude(frequencyBand) //From audio signal

            //Create a 3D point at the location with intensity proportional to amplitude
            point = new Point3D(location, amplitude)
            pointCloud.addPoint(point)

    return pointCloud
```

**Novelty:**

The core innovation lies in reconstructing a *dynamic, 3D representation of the acoustic environment*, not just pinpointing the closest source.  This goes beyond simple voice command recognition and opens possibilities for applications like:

*   **Smart Home Automation:**  Automatically adjusting lighting/temperature based on detected occupancy and activity within a room.
*   **Security Systems:**  Detecting and localizing unusual sounds (e.g., breaking glass) within a defined space.
*   **Augmented Reality:**  Creating immersive AR experiences that respond to the surrounding acoustic environment.
*   **Robotics:** Enabling robots to navigate and interact with their environment based on sound localization and scene understanding.
