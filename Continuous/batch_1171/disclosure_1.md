## Dynamic Frame Prioritization Based on User Gaze Tracking

**Specification:** A system and method for dynamically adjusting the prioritization of content frames sent to a user device based on real-time gaze tracking data. This builds upon the concept of frame reordering, but moves beyond pre-determined prioritization and leverages immediate user attention.

**Components:**

*   **Gaze Tracker:** Integrated with the user device (camera-based, or dedicated hardware). Captures and processes gaze data (x, y coordinates of the user's focus).
*   **Page Decomposition Module:** Divides the web page content into discrete, trackable regions (tiles or blocks). Each region is associated with a unique identifier.
*   **Gaze-Region Mapping Module:** Correlates gaze data with the active page regions. Determines which region(s) the user is currently looking at.
*   **Frame Prioritization Engine:** Receives gaze-region mapping data and adjusts the transmission order of content frames. Frames containing content for the currently focused region(s) are prioritized and sent earlier.
*   **Adaptive Frame Rate Control:** Modifies the frame rate of prioritized regions to ensure smooth rendering. Reduced frame rates may be applied to non-focused regions.
*   **Predictive Gaze Modeling:** Implements a model to predict the userâ€™s next gaze location, enabling pre-fetching of relevant content.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Page Load:** The web page is loaded, and the Page Decomposition Module creates a map of trackable regions.
2.  **Gaze Tracking:** The Gaze Tracker continuously captures gaze data.
3.  **Region Mapping:** The Gaze-Region Mapping Module determines the currently focused region(s).
4.  **Frame Prioritization:** The Frame Prioritization Engine adjusts the frame transmission order, prioritizing frames containing content for the focused region(s).
5.  **Adaptive Frame Rate:** The system dynamically adjusts the frame rates of different regions.
6.  **Prediction & Prefetching:** The Predictive Gaze Modeling module anticipates the next gaze location and prefetches related content.
7.  **Continuous Loop:** Steps 2-6 are repeated continuously during page interaction.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Global Variables
pageRegions = // List of page regions with identifiers
frameQueue = // Queue of frames to be sent
gazeData = // Current gaze coordinates (x, y)

// Function: processGazeData()
function processGazeData() {
    focusedRegion = determineFocusedRegion(gazeData, pageRegions) // Based on x, y coordinates
    
    //Re-order frameQueue based on focusedRegion
    frameQueue = reorderFrameQueue(frameQueue, focusedRegion)
}

// Function: reorderFrameQueue(frameQueue, focusedRegion)
function reorderFrameQueue(frameQueue, focusedRegion) {
    prioritizedFrames = []
    nonPrioritizedFrames = []
    
    for frame in frameQueue {
        if frame.contains(focusedRegion) {
            prioritizedFrames.append(frame)
        } else {
            nonPrioritizedFrames.append(frame)
        }
    }
    
    return prioritizedFrames + nonPrioritizedFrames
}

//Main loop
while (pageLoading) {
    processGazeData()
    sendNextFrame(frameQueue)
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Frame:** Contains content for a specific region(s). Includes region identifiers, content data, and priority level.
*   **Region:** Represents a discrete section of the web page. Includes an identifier, bounding box coordinates, and content type.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-User Support:** Extend the system to track and prioritize content for multiple users viewing the same page.
*   **Content Type Awareness:** Adjust prioritization based on content type (e.g., prioritize images over text).
*   **Network Conditions:** Adapt prioritization based on network bandwidth and latency.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Train a model to predict user gaze patterns and optimize prioritization for specific page layouts.
