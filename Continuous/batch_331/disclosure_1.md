## Secure Data Sharding with Dynamic Quorum Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the secure search and storage system to dynamically adjust quorum sizes based on real-time network conditions and node availability, coupled with proactive data sharding. This tackles both performance bottlenecks and enhanced security against collusion/compromise.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sharding Module:**

*   **Function:** Divide incoming client data into ‘n’ shards.
*   **Method:** Employ a consistent hashing algorithm (e.g., Jump Consistent Hash) to distribute shards across available secret-sharing computing devices. Initial shard count ‘n’ is configurable.
*   **Metadata:** Store a mapping of data identifiers to shard locations in a distributed metadata store (e.g., a replicated key-value store).
*   **Replication:**  Each shard is replicated ‘r’ times (configurable) across different devices to ensure availability.

**2. Dynamic Quorum Adjustment Module:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor network latency, bandwidth, and node health (CPU, memory, disk I/O) of each secret-sharing computing device.
*   **Quorum Calculation:** Calculate an optimal quorum size ‘q’ based on:
    *   **Network Conditions:** Devices with high latency or low bandwidth contribute less to the quorum calculation.
    *   **Node Health:** Devices under high load are downweighted in the quorum calculation.
    *   **Security Policy:** A configurable security parameter dictates the minimum acceptable quorum size.
    *   **Formula (example):**  `q = max(min_quorum,  Σ (weight_i * availability_i))` where:
        *   `min_quorum` is a predefined minimum quorum size.
        *   `weight_i` represents the network and node health score of device 'i'.
        *   `availability_i` is a binary value indicating whether the device is online and responsive.
*   **Quorum Reconfiguration:**  Periodically (or on significant network/node changes) reconfigure the active quorum of devices for each shard.  Use a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft or Paxos) to ensure agreement on the new quorum.
*    **Ephemeral Quorums:** Upon each search request, a unique ephemeral quorum is constructed, preventing predictable access patterns. This adds a layer of protection against targeted attacks.

**3. Search Request Processing:**

*   **Shard Identification:**  Based on the search criteria, identify the shards relevant to the request using the distributed metadata store.
*   **Ephemeral Quorum Selection:** Construct an ephemeral quorum of devices holding shares of the relevant shards. This quorum can be different for each shard based on the real-time conditions of those specific devices.
*   **Share Retrieval:** Request shares from the selected ephemeral quorum.
*   **Secret Reconstruction:** Reconstruct the encrypted data using the received shares.
*   **Sorting and Results:** Sort the reconstructed data according to the sort criteria and return the results.

**4.  Security Enhancements:**

*   **Rotating Secret Shares:**  Regularly rotate the secret shares held by each device. This limits the damage from a potential compromise.
*   **Threshold Encryption:** Utilize threshold encryption to further enhance security. This ensures that a certain number of shares are required to decrypt the data, even if some shares are compromised.
*   **Attestation:** Implement remote attestation to verify the integrity of the secret-sharing computing devices before including them in the quorum.




**Pseudocode (Dynamic Quorum Calculation):**

```
function calculate_quorum(devices, min_quorum, security_policy):
  total_weight = 0
  for device in devices:
    weight = calculate_device_weight(device) // based on network latency, node health
    total_weight += weight

  quorum_size = max(min_quorum, int(total_weight * security_policy))

  // Select top 'quorum_size' devices with highest weight
  selected_devices = sort_devices_by_weight(devices)[0:quorum_size]
  return selected_devices

function calculate_device_weight(device):
  network_weight = 1.0 / (device.latency + 1) // Lower latency = higher weight
  node_weight = 1.0 - (device.cpu_load + device.memory_load) // Lower load = higher weight
  return network_weight * node_weight

```
