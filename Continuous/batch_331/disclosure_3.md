## Dynamic Contextual Highlighting & Predictive Summarization

**Concept:** Expand the predictive text highlighting to include dynamic contextual awareness, coupled with automated, predictive summarization driven by user interaction *around* highlighted sections. Instead of simply predicting what a user *might* highlight, predict what they might *do* with that highlighted text – share, summarize, ask questions about, etc. – and proactively offer relevant tools/actions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Real-time User Interaction Monitoring:** Capture not only text selections but also subsequent actions: copying, pasting, sharing (platform, recipient), note-taking, search queries immediately following a selection.
*   **Contextual Feature Extraction:** Beyond sentence structure & word types, incorporate:
    *   **Document Type:** (e.g., news article, academic paper, forum post).
    *   **User Profile:** (e.g., profession, interests, prior reading/interaction history).
    *   **Temporal Context:** (Time of day, day of week - influences reading/sharing behavior).
    *   **Network Context:** (Who else is reading/interacting with the same content?).
*   **Interaction Graph Construction:** Build a graph representing user interactions with text. Nodes are text segments. Edges represent actions (share, summarize, question, etc.), weighted by frequency and user profile.

**2. Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Multi-Task Learning:** Train a model to predict *multiple* outcomes simultaneously:
    *   **Highlight Probability:** (As in the original patent).
    *   **Action Probability:** (Probability of each action - share, summarize, question – for a given text segment).
*   **Model Architecture:** Use a transformer-based architecture (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) fine-tuned for the multi-task learning objective.
*   **Personalized Action Profiles:**  For each user, maintain a profile of their preferred actions for different content types.  This profile influences the action probability predictions.

**3. Dynamic Highlighting & Interface:**

*   **Multi-Tiered Highlighting:** Instead of a single highlight color, use a gradient or different visual cues to indicate predicted action probabilities.  (e.g., bright yellow = high highlight + share probability; light blue = high highlight + summarize probability).
*   **Proactive Action Buttons:**  Display a small set of predicted action buttons near highlighted segments. (e.g., "Summarize," "Share to Twitter," "Ask AI," "Define Term"). Buttons are dynamically ordered based on predicted probability.
*   **AI-Powered Summarization:** When "Summarize" is clicked, generate a concise summary of the highlighted text, tailored to the context and user profile.  Use a generative language model (e.g., GPT-3) fine-tuned for summarization.
*   **“AI-Ask” Functionality**: If "Ask AI" is selected, present the highlighted text to a natural language processing model for automated questioning. (e.g., model determines likely questions a user might have about the highlighted passage).
*   **Contextual Tooltips**: Display additional information or related content when the user hovers over a highlighted segment. (e.g., definitions, related articles, author information).

**4. Training & Refinement Loop:**

*   **Continuous Learning**:  Retrain the model periodically with new user interaction data.
*   **A/B Testing**: Experiment with different highlighting schemes, action button configurations, and summarization models to optimize performance.
*   **User Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to provide explicit feedback on the accuracy of predictions and the usefulness of actions. (e.g., "Was this prediction helpful?").



**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Input: Text content, User Profile, Current Context
function predict_and_highlight(text, user_profile, context) {

  // Extract features from text, user profile, and context
  features = extract_features(text, user_profile, context);

  // Predict highlight probability and action probabilities
  highlight_prob, action_probs = model.predict(features);

  // Apply multi-tiered highlighting based on probabilities
  highlighted_text = apply_highlighting(text, highlight_prob, action_probs);

  // Display proactive action buttons
  action_buttons = generate_action_buttons(action_probs);

  return highlighted_text, action_buttons;
}

function generate_action_buttons(action_probs) {
  // Sort action probabilities in descending order
  sorted_actions = sort_by_probability(action_probs);

  // Select top N actions to display as buttons
  top_n_actions = sorted_actions[:3]; // Display top 3 actions

  return top_n_actions;
}
```
