## Dynamic Search Contextualization via Temporal Tagging

**Concept:** Extend the persistent search functionality by not just *saving* results, but by saving the *context* of the search at a specific point in time. This allows users to replay their research process, see how results changed over time, and effectively ‘time travel’ through their information gathering.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Tagging:**  Whenever a user performs a search and saves results (using the existing toggle/tagging mechanism), the system records:
    *   Timestamp of the search.
    *   Complete search query string(s).
    *   Current filtering/sorting applied.
    *   User’s current category/hierarchy context (if applicable – see patent claims 21-23).
    *   A snapshot of the rendered results (URLs, titles, brief descriptions).

2.  **"Search Timeline" Interface:** A dedicated UI element (e.g., a sidebar or dropdown) displays a chronological list of saved search sessions.  Each entry shows:
    *   Timestamp.
    *   Search query summary (truncated if necessary).
    *   An icon indicating the category/hierarchy context.

3.  **Session Replay:** Selecting a session from the timeline will:
    *   Re-execute the original search query (or, if the source data is unavailable, load the cached snapshot).
    *   Re-apply the original filtering/sorting.
    *   Navigate the UI to the original category/hierarchy context.
    *   Highlight the saved results within the current results set.

4.  **“Delta View”:**  A mode allowing users to compare the current results set with a previously saved session. The UI will visually indicate:
    *   Results present in both sets (e.g., green highlight).
    *   Results unique to the current set (e.g., blue highlight).
    *   Results unique to the saved session (e.g., red highlight).

5.  **“Evolution” Mode:**  Allows users to step through saved search sessions chronologically, visualizing how the results evolved over time.  A timeline slider controls the progression.

6.  **Data Storage:**
    *   Temporal tags and session metadata are stored in a database (SQL or NoSQL).
    *   Cached result snapshots are stored in a persistent storage solution (e.g., cloud storage).
    *   Consider data compression techniques to minimize storage costs.

**Pseudocode (Session Replay):**

```
function replaySession(sessionId) {
  sessionData = database.getSessionData(sessionId);
  query = sessionData.query;
  filters = sessionData.filters;
  categoryContext = sessionData.categoryContext;

  //Navigate to category context (if applicable)
  if (categoryContext != null) {
    ui.navigateToCategory(categoryContext);
  }

  //Execute search query
  searchResults = searchEngine.execute(query);

  //Apply filters
  filteredResults = applyFilters(searchResults, filters);

  //Display results
  ui.displayResults(filteredResults);

  //Highlight saved results (if available)
  savedResultUrls = sessionData.resultUrls;
  highlightResults(savedResultUrls);
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simply *saving* search results to *preserving the research process itself*.  It enables users to not just find information, but to understand *how* their understanding of a topic evolved over time. This is particularly valuable for long-term projects, competitive intelligence, and knowledge management.
