## Dynamic Resource Presets via Generative Scene Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend resource determination not just by *analyzing* existing images, but by *generating* synthetic scenes based on user-defined aesthetic goals, then determining resources needed to *create* those scenes. This moves beyond identifying resources used *in* images to proactively suggesting resources for *future* image creation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Scene Goal Input:**

*   **Input Method:**  A multi-faceted interface.
    *   **Textual Prompt:**  Natural language description of desired aesthetic ("golden hour portrait," "dramatic cityscape," "soft, ethereal landscape").
    *   **Mood Board/Reference Image Upload:** Users upload images representing desired style, composition, color palette.
    *   **Parameter Sliders:** Fine-grained control over visual attributes (depth of field, color saturation, contrast, lighting direction, “dreaminess,” “realism,” etc.).
*   **Semantic Parsing:** An AI engine analyzes input (text, image, sliders) to create a semantic representation of the desired scene. This includes identification of key objects, lighting conditions, color schemes, and stylistic elements.

**2. Generative Scene Engine:**

*   **Technology:** Utilize a diffusion model (like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3) or a similar generative AI architecture.
*   **Conditioning:** The semantic representation from the Scene Goal Input is used to *condition* the generative model. This steers the model to create images aligning with user intent.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** A feedback loop allows users to refine the generated scene.  They can provide textual feedback ("more dramatic lighting," "add a person in the foreground"), adjust parameters, or upload additional reference images.

**3. Resource Determination & Configuration:**

*   **Scene Analysis:** Once the user approves a generated scene, an analysis module extracts key properties. This includes:
    *   Lighting requirements (intensity, color temperature, direction, source type).
    *   Depth of field and required aperture/lens characteristics.
    *   Color palette and required filters/post-processing effects.
    *   Object placement and required composition.
*   **Resource Mapping:**  A database maps scene properties to specific resources.
    *   **Cameras:**  Based on required resolution, dynamic range, and sensor size.
    *   **Lenses:** Based on focal length, aperture, and desired depth of field.
    *   **Lighting Equipment:** (strobes, softboxes, reflectors) Based on required intensity, color temperature, and direction.
    *   **Filters:** (polarizing, ND, color correction) Based on desired effects.
    *   **Post-Processing Software/Presets:** Based on desired color grading, effects, and stylistic adjustments.
*   **Configuration Value Generation:**  The system determines optimal configuration values for each resource.
    *   Camera: Aperture, ISO, Shutter Speed, White Balance.
    *   Lighting: Power Output, Color Temperature, Position.
    *   Software: Specific filter settings, color grading parameters.

**4. Output & Control:**

*   **Resource List:**  A comprehensive list of recommended resources, with links to purchase/rent.
*   **Configuration Guide:**  Detailed instructions on how to configure each resource to achieve the desired look. This includes diagrams, visualizations, and step-by-step instructions.
*   **Automated Control (Future):**  Integration with smart cameras and lighting equipment for automated configuration and control. The system could directly set camera settings and adjust lighting parameters.



**Pseudocode (Resource Determination):**

```
FUNCTION determineResources(sceneGoal, userPreferences):
  scene = generateScene(sceneGoal) //Using diffusion model
  sceneProperties = analyzeScene(scene)
  resources = []
  FOR each property in sceneProperties:
    resource = findResource(property, userPreferences)
    IF resource != null:
      configuration = calculateConfiguration(resource, property)
      resources.append((resource, configuration))
  RETURN resources
```

This system expands upon the original patent by shifting the focus from *analyzing* existing images to *creating* desired images, and then determining the resources needed to bring those visions to life.  It represents a proactive, rather than reactive, approach to resource recommendation.
