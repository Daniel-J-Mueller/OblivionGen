## Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' for Proactive Failure Mitigation & Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the existing traffic shifting system to *proactively* create 'shadow' paths for critical traffic flows *before* failures occur, and dynamically shift traffic onto these shadows based on predictive network health analysis. This differs from reactive shifting by anticipating issues instead of responding to them.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Health Analyzer (PHA)**
    *   Input: Real-time telemetry data from network devices (latency, bandwidth utilization, error rates, CPU/memory load). Historical performance data. External data feeds (weather patterns, scheduled maintenance).
    *   Process: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (time-series analysis, anomaly detection) to predict potential network degradations or failures. Output: Probability scores for different failure modes (link failure, device overload, congestion).
    *   Output:  "Shadowing Recommendations" – a prioritized list of critical traffic flows and recommended shadow paths. Flows identified by application type/priority. Shadow paths defined by alternate routes/devices. 

*   **Component 2: Shadow Path Manager (SPM)**
    *   Input: Shadowing Recommendations from PHA. Current network topology & resource availability.
    *   Process: Determines optimal shadow paths based on available resources, path cost, and latency.  Establishes shadow paths using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles (e.g., through OpenFlow or similar protocols).  Creates 'standby' forwarding rules on network devices to direct traffic onto shadow paths when needed.  Maintains a database of shadow path configurations.
    *   Output:  Shadow path configurations pushed to network devices. Active/Standby flags for shadow paths.

*   **Component 3: Traffic Steering Engine (TSE)**
    *   Input: Real-time telemetry. PHA failure predictions. Shadow path status (Active/Standby).
    *   Process: Monitors network health. When PHA predicts a likely failure or detects a degradation *before* a full outage, TSE activates corresponding shadow paths. Seamlessly shifts traffic onto shadow paths using established forwarding rules. 
    *   Output: Modified forwarding tables on network devices.  Traffic diverted onto shadow paths.

**Pseudocode (TSE - Core Logic):**

```
function handleNetworkEvent(eventData):
  if eventData.type == "prediction":
    predictedFailure = eventData.failureType
    affectedFlow = eventData.flowID
    
    if shadowPathExists(affectedFlow):
      activateShadowPath(affectedFlow)
      divertTraffic(affectedFlow)
      logEvent("Shadow path activated for flow " + affectedFlow)
  else if eventData.type == "degradation":
    degradedLink = eventData.linkID
    affectedFlows = getFlowsUsingLink(degradedLink)
    
    for flow in affectedFlows:
      if shadowPathExists(flow):
        activateShadowPath(flow)
        divertTraffic(flow)
        logEvent("Shadow path activated for flow " + flow + " due to link degradation")
  else if eventData.type == "recovery":
    recoveredLink = eventData.linkID
    #Revert traffic back to primary paths after a period of monitoring
    monitorLink(recoveredLink)
    if linkStable(recoveredLink):
      revertTraffic(recoveredLink)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers for PHA and SPM.
*   SDN-capable network devices.
*   Network monitoring infrastructure to collect telemetry data.

**Novelty:**

Proactive shadow path creation based on predictive network health analysis – moves beyond reactive traffic shifting to prevent outages and optimize performance. This leverages machine learning to anticipate issues and prepare for them *before* they occur, providing a significant advantage over existing solutions. It’s not simply about responding to failure, it's about preemptively mitigating risk.
