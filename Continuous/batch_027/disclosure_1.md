## Adaptive Multi-Channel Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** This system aims to reconstruct the full acoustic scene captured by a multi-channel microphone array *before* echo cancellation is applied. This reconstructed scene can then be used for more robust echo cancellation, noise reduction, and even source localization/separation. The patent focuses on synchronizing sample rates *after* signal processing begins. This shifts focus to *before* signal processing, leveraging the inherent redundancy of a multi-channel array.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-channel microphone array (minimum 4 microphones, optimally 8+).
    *   High-performance processing unit (GPU or dedicated DSP recommended).
    *   High-bandwidth, low-latency communication bus between microphones and processing unit.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) Estimation:** Module estimates TDOA between each microphone pair. Uses a generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) algorithm, but incorporates a dynamic weighting scheme based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each channel.
    *   **Scene Geometry Estimation:** Utilizing the TDOA estimates, the module estimates the location and characteristics (e.g., size, reflectivity) of sound sources in the environment. Employs a probabilistic approach (e.g., particle filter) to handle ambiguity and noise.
    *   **Wavefield Reconstruction:** This module synthesizes the acoustic wavefield at a virtual listening point, based on the estimated source locations and characteristics, and the TDOA information. Uses a boundary element method (BEM) or finite element method (FEM) for accurate wave propagation modeling.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering & Echo Cancellation:** Traditional adaptive filtering (e.g., LMS, RLMS) is applied to the reconstructed wavefield, *before* it reaches the output device. This allows for a more accurate separation of desired signal from echo, due to the clean reconstruction. The filter coefficients are adjusted based on the error signal between the reconstructed and actual output.
    *   **Multi-Resolution Analysis:** Employ wavelet transforms or similar techniques to decompose the audio signal into different frequency bands. This allows for separate processing and reconstruction of each band, improving accuracy and robustness.

**Pseudocode (Wavefield Reconstruction - Simplified):**

```
function reconstructWavefield(sourceLocations, sourceCharacteristics, microphoneData):
  // microphoneData: array of signals from each microphone
  // sourceLocations: array of 3D coordinates of sound sources
  // sourceCharacteristics: array of properties like amplitude, frequency

  wavefield = 0

  for each source in sourceLocations:
    // Calculate distance from source to each microphone
    distances = calculateDistances(source, microphones)

    // Calculate time delays based on distance and speed of sound
    delays = calculateDelays(distances)

    // Generate a signal based on source characteristics and delays
    sourceSignal = generateSourceSignal(sourceCharacteristics, delays)

    // Add the source signal to the wavefield
    wavefield += sourceSignal

  return wavefield
```

**Innovation:** The core novelty lies in reconstructing the entire acoustic scene *before* traditional echo cancellation. This allows for a 'cleaner' signal to be processed, resulting in more effective echo cancellation and improved audio quality. Further innovation comes from the dynamic weighting and probabilistic estimation employed, handling challenging acoustic environments. This is a departure from the patentâ€™s focus on synchronization *after* processing, and introduces a novel pre-processing step.
