## Adaptive Resolution Feature Mapping for Neural Networks

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of variable-bit encoding based on weight magnitude by introducing *adaptive resolution feature mapping*. Instead of just varying bit depth for individual weights, this system dynamically adjusts the granularity of feature representation *before* quantization.  This allows for more efficient compression, especially in scenarios with highly redundant or sparse features.

**Specifications:**

**1. Feature Granularity Control Module (FGCM):**

*   **Input:** Raw feature vector from the neural network layer.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** FGCM performs a rolling statistical analysis of feature variance over a defined window (e.g., 1000 iterations of training/inference).
    *   **Granularity Assignment:** Based on variance, each feature (or group of features) is assigned a "granularity level."  Levels range from 1 (coarse) to N (fine).  Lower variance = lower granularity.
    *   **Dimensionality Reduction/Expansion:**  For coarse granularity levels, features are subjected to dimensionality reduction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a limited number of components). For fine granularity levels, features may be *expanded* by introducing interpolated values or secondary features derived from the original.
*   **Output:** A modified feature vector with adjusted dimensionality and representation based on granularity levels.

**2. Adaptive Quantization Module (AQM):**

*   **Input:** Modified feature vector from FGCM and the original weight tensor.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Dynamic Range Calculation:** AQM calculates the dynamic range for each feature based on the modified vector (considering dimensionality changes).
    *   **Variable Bit-Width Assignment:** Based on the dynamic range, AQM assigns a bit-width for each feature.  Higher dynamic range = higher bit-width.
    *   **Quantization:** Weights associated with the feature are quantized using the assigned bit-width.
*   **Output:** Compressed weight tensor and a metadata table mapping features to assigned bit-widths and dimensionality adjustments.

**3. Metadata Table:**

*   Stores the following information for each feature:
    *   Original Feature Index
    *   Assigned Bit-Width
    *   Dimensionality Adjustment Factor (e.g., reduced to 2 components, expanded by interpolation)
    *   PCA Transformation Matrix (if applicable)

**Pseudocode (FGCM):**

```
function processFeatureVector(featureVector, windowSize):
  // Rolling Variance Calculation
  variances = calculateRollingVariance(featureVector, windowSize)

  // Granularity Assignment
  for each featureIndex in range(len(featureVector)):
    if variances[featureIndex] < thresholdLow:
      granularityLevel = 1 // Coarse
    elif variances[featureIndex] > thresholdHigh:
      granularityLevel = N // Fine
    else:
      granularityLevel = intermediateLevel

    // Dimensionality Adjustment
    if granularityLevel == 1:
      featureVector[featureIndex] = applyPCA(featureVector[featureIndex], numComponents = 2)
    elif granularityLevel == N:
      featureVector[featureIndex] = interpolate(featureVector[featureIndex])

  return featureVector
```

**System Architecture:**

*   FGCM and AQM are integrated as preprocessing steps within the neural network pipeline.
*   The metadata table is stored alongside the compressed weight tensor.
*   During inference, the metadata table is used to reconstruct the original feature representation before applying the quantized weights.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved compression ratios, especially for sparse or redundant features.
*   Reduced model size and memory footprint.
*   Potential for faster inference speeds due to reduced data transfer.
*   Adaptability to changing data distributions during training.
