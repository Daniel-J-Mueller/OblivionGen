## Dynamic Interference Graph Partitioning for Heterogeneous Memory

**Concept:** Extend the interference graph concept to explicitly model and utilize the varying characteristics of different memory types (SRAM, DRAM, Flash) within an integrated circuit. The existing patent focuses on color selection *within* a single memory space. This expands that to *across* heterogeneous memory spaces, partitioning the interference graph to optimize data placement based on access patterns and memory constraints.

**Specification:**

**1. Graph Augmentation:**

*   **Memory Node Types:** Introduce node types to the interference graph representing different memory regions (e.g., L1 Cache, L2 Cache, DRAM, Non-Volatile Memory).  Each node will have associated parameters: `capacity`, `access_latency`, `power_consumption`.
*   **Edge Weighting:**  Edge weights between variables are no longer simply binary (interference/no interference). They represent the *frequency* and *type* of data transfer between variables.  Additionally, edges *between* variable nodes and memory nodes represent the cost (latency, power) of placing a variable in that memory region.

**2. Partitioning Algorithm:**

*   **Initial Graph Construction:** Standard interference graph construction as described in the source patent.
*   **Cost-Aware Partitioning:**  Employ a graph partitioning algorithm (e.g., METIS, KaHyPar) modified to consider the edge weights and memory node parameters. The objective is to minimize the *total cost* of data access and transfer.
    *   **Cost Function:** `TotalCost = Σ (EdgeWeight * TransferCost) + Σ (VariablePowerConsumption)`.  `TransferCost` is determined by the latency and power consumption of accessing the target memory region.
*   **Dynamic Re-Partitioning:** Monitor runtime data access patterns.  If access patterns shift significantly, trigger a re-partitioning process. This could be triggered by performance monitoring hardware or software probes.

**3. Color Assignment Refinement:**

*   **Memory-Aware Coloring:** Modify the color selection schemes (color reuse, color rotation) to account for the memory region assigned to each variable.
    *   **Color Prioritization:**  Prioritize colors that correspond to memory regions with lower access latency for frequently accessed variables.
    *   **Spill Candidate Selection:** When selecting spill candidates, consider the cost of spilling variables to different memory regions. Spill to the least expensive available memory.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function partition_graph(interference_graph, memory_regions):
  // Assign each variable to a memory region
  variable_to_memory = perform_graph_partitioning(interference_graph, memory_regions)

  // Modify color assignment based on memory region
  for each variable in interference_graph:
    memory_region = variable_to_memory[variable]
    variable.color = select_color_for_memory(variable, memory_region)

  return variable_to_memory

function select_color_for_memory(variable, memory_region):
  // Prioritize colors based on memory latency and capacity.
  // Implement color reuse or rotation schemes adjusted for memory constraints.

  // Example: if memory_region is 'fast_cache', prioritize lower color numbers (more frequent reuse).
  if memory_region == 'fast_cache':
    return select_lowest_available_color(variable)
  else:
    return select_color_from_rotation_scheme(variable)
```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   **Performance Monitoring Units (PMUs):** Integrate PMUs to track data access patterns and trigger re-partitioning events.
*   **Memory Controllers:** Modify memory controllers to support heterogeneous memory spaces and optimized data placement.
*   **Cache Coherency:**  Ensure cache coherency across different memory regions.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced memory access latency.
*   Lower power consumption.
*   Improved overall system performance.
*   Flexibility to adapt to changing workloads.
