## Autonomous Compartment Reconfiguration & Item Pairing

**Concept:** Expand upon the adjustable membrane concept to enable dynamic compartment resizing *and* automated item pairing within the SCV, optimizing space and preventing damage during transit.

**Specifications:**

**1. Compartment Actuation System:**

*   **Mechanism:** Integrate a network of miniature linear actuators surrounding each storage compartment. These actuators, controlled by the central control system, will adjust the rigid frame *around* the membrane, physically resizing the compartment volume.
*   **Sensing:**  Pressure sensors *within* the membrane and proximity sensors *around* the compartment walls will provide real-time feedback to the control system, preventing collisions or over-compression of items.
*   **Range:** Compartment volume adjustment range: 20% reduction to 50% expansion of nominal size.
*   **Material:** Actuators utilize shape-memory alloys or piezoelectric elements for compact size and responsiveness.

**2. Item Identification & Pairing System:**

*   **Scanning:** Each compartment includes a high-resolution 3D scanner and weight sensor. Upon item placement (or retrieval detection), the system creates a digital twin of the item, including dimensions, weight, and fragility assessment.
*   **AI Pairing Logic:** The control system uses an AI algorithm to identify items that can be safely paired within a compartment. Criteria include:
    *   Compatible fragility levels.
    *   Complementary shapes (to minimize wasted space).
    *   Order association (items going to the same customer are prioritized for pairing).
*   **Internal Padding:** The system deploys a network of inflatable, air-filled pockets *around* paired items to provide cushioning and prevent movement during transit. Pocket inflation level is dynamically adjusted based on item fragility and SCV acceleration/deceleration.

**3. Control System Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Item Placement Event
on ItemPlaced(compartmentID, itemData) {
  scanItem(compartmentID, itemData);
  itemProfile = createItemProfile(itemData);
  findCompatibleItems(compartmentID, itemProfile);

  if (compatibleItemFound) {
    calculateOptimalArrangement(itemProfile, compatibleItemProfile);
    deployInternalPadding(compartmentID, arrangementData);
    adjustCompartmentSize(compartmentID, arrangementData);
  } else {
    adjustCompartmentSize(compartmentID, itemProfile); // Default to minimal size
  }
}

// Transit Event (SCV acceleration/deceleration detected)
on TransitEvent(accelerationData) {
  for each compartment in SCV {
    adjustPaddingLevel(compartment, accelerationData);
  }
}
```

**4. Materials:**

*   Compartment Frames: Lightweight carbon fiber composite.
*   Membrane:  Self-healing polymer with embedded pressure sensors.
*   Padding Material:  Shape-memory foam encased in a flexible, air-tight membrane.

**5. Power Requirements:**

*   Dedicated power subsystem with redundant battery backups to ensure continuous operation of the actuation and sensing systems.
*   Energy harvesting from SCV movement (e.g., piezoelectric generators) to supplement battery power.
