## Adaptive Lock Granularity with Predictive Session Decay

**Concept:** The provided patent centers on distributed locks and session staleness. This design expands on that by introducing *dynamic* lock granularity based on predicted session activity and a tiered locking mechanism. Instead of a binary locked/unlocked state, we introduce multiple levels of lock contention, and dynamically adjust the scope of the lock based on anticipated access patterns.

**Motivation:** Current approaches often err on the side of caution, holding locks for longer than necessary to avoid contention. This can severely impact performance. This design aims to reduce contention by releasing locks earlier when session activity is predicted to be low, while automatically increasing lock scope when bursts of activity are anticipated.

**System Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Session Activity Predictor (SAP):**
    *   Input: Historical session access logs (item IDs, timestamps, user IDs). Real-time session access data.
    *   Processing: Employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future session access frequency and patterns for each item.  Predictive horizon: configurable (e.g., 5 seconds, 1 minute).
    *   Output: Predicted Access Score (PAS) for each item, representing the likelihood of access within the predictive horizon. A "confidence interval" associated with the PAS.
*   **Component 2: Adaptive Lock Manager (ALM):**
    *   Input: PAS from SAP. Current lock state of items. Session metadata (staleness, user ID).
    *   Processing:
        *   **Lock Granularity Levels:**
            *   **Level 0 (Unlocked):** No lock held.
            *   **Level 1 (Optimistic Lock):**  A lightweight marker indicates intent to access. Conflicts are resolved with retry/fallback. (CAS operation).
            *   **Level 2 (Shared Lock):**  Multiple readers allowed.
            *   **Level 3 (Exclusive Lock):** Single writer allowed.
        *   **Lock Adjustment Algorithm:**
            *   If PAS < Threshold_Low:  Downgrade lock to Level 1 or 0.
            *   If Threshold_Low < PAS < Threshold_Med: Maintain current lock level.
            *   If PAS > Threshold_Med: Upgrade lock level (up to Level 3).
            *   Lock escalation and de-escalation are performed non-blocking.
    *   Output: Lock state changes.
*   **Component 3: Lock Contention Resolver:**
    *   Input: Lock contention events (e.g., conflicting access requests).
    *   Processing:
        *   Priority-based contention resolution. Clients with higher priority (e.g., critical transactions) preempt lower-priority clients.
        *   Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.
        *   Fallback to optimistic locking (Level 1) if contention persists.
    *   Output: Resolved access requests.

**Data Structures:**

*   **Item Lock Table:**  Stores the current lock level for each item.  Concurrent hash map.
*   **Session Activity Profile:** Stores historical access patterns for each session.
*   **Prediction Model:** Stores the parameters for the time-series forecasting model.

**Pseudocode (ALM Lock Adjustment):**

```
function adjustLock(itemID, currentLockLevel, PAS):
    if PAS < Threshold_Low:
        if currentLockLevel > 0:
            releaseLock(itemID) // Downgrade to Level 0
    else if PAS > Threshold_Med:
        if currentLockLevel == 0:
            acquireLock(itemID, Level 1) // Upgrade to Level 1
        else if currentLockLevel == 1:
            upgradeLock(itemID, Level 2)
        else if currentLockLevel == 2:
            upgradeLock(itemID, Level 3)

    return currentLockLevel
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Threshold\_Low and Threshold\_Med are configurable parameters that can be tuned based on application workload.
*   The time-series forecasting model should be retrained periodically to adapt to changing access patterns.
*   The lock escalation and de-escalation algorithms should be implemented carefully to avoid race conditions.
*   Consider using a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure consistency of the lock state.
