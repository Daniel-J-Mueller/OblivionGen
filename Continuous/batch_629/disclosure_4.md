## Adaptive Link Contextualization via Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust link validation parameters based on observed user behavior, creating a risk score influencing application invocation.

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing certificate-based validation by layering behavioral biometrics. This moves beyond static trust (certificate authority) to *dynamic* trust (user behavior). The system learns a user's typical interaction patterns and flags deviations as potential hijacking attempts.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Sensor Suite:**
    *   Keystroke Dynamics: Capture typing speed, rhythm, and error rates.
    *   Touch/Mouse Movement Analysis: Track speed, pressure (if applicable), trajectory, and pauses.
    *   Device Orientation & Movement: Utilize accelerometer/gyroscope to detect unusual device handling.
    *   Application Usage Patterns: Log frequency and sequence of application launches.

2.  **Behavioral Profile Builder:**
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) that creates a personalized behavioral profile for each user.
    *   Continuously updates the profile based on observed behavior.
    *   Stores profile data securely (encrypted) on the device and/or a remote server.

3.  **Risk Scoring Engine:**
    *   Calculates a real-time risk score based on the deviation of current behavior from the established profile.
    *   Considers multiple behavioral factors and weights them based on their predictive power.
    *   Provides a risk score ranging from 0 (low risk) to 100 (high risk).

4.  **Adaptive Validation Policy:**
    *   Configurable thresholds for risk score levels.
    *   Different validation policies triggered based on the risk score:
        *   **Low Risk (0-30):** Standard certificate validation as per existing patent. Link invoked directly.
        *   **Medium Risk (31-70):** Multi-factor authentication prompt (e.g., biometric scan, PIN entry) before invoking the link.
        *   **High Risk (71-100):** Block link invocation and display a warning message to the user. Log event for security analysis.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function handleLinkActivation(link, callingApp):
    riskScore = calculateRiskScore(callingApp, link)

    if riskScore <= 30:
        // Standard certificate validation (existing patent logic)
        if isValidCertificate(targetApp):
            invokeApp(targetApp, link.data)
        else:
            displayError("Invalid certificate")

    else if riskScore <= 70:
        // Multi-factor authentication
        promptUserForAuthentication()
        if authenticationSuccessful():
            if isValidCertificate(targetApp):
                invokeApp(targetApp, link.data)
            else:
                displayError("Invalid certificate")
        else:
            displayError("Authentication failed")

    else:
        displayWarning("Suspicious link activity.  Link blocked.")
        logSecurityEvent("Blocked link due to high risk score")
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserProfile`:
    *   `userId`: Unique identifier for the user.
    *   `keystrokeModel`: Trained model for keystroke dynamics.
    *   `movementModel`: Trained model for touch/mouse movement.
    *   `appUsageHistory`: Log of launched applications and their frequency.

*   `RiskScore`:
    *   `keystrokeDeviation`: Score reflecting deviation from normal keystroke patterns.
    *   `movementDeviation`: Score reflecting deviation from normal movement patterns.
    *   `appUsageAnomaly`: Score reflecting unusual application launch sequences.
    *   `totalScore`: Weighted sum of individual scores.

**Future Considerations:**

*   Integration with threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious links.
*   Federated learning to improve behavioral models without sharing sensitive user data.
*   Adaptive learning: Adjust weighting of behavioral factors based on their effectiveness in detecting hijacking attempts.
