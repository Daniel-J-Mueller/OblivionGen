## Dynamic Message ‘Skinning’ for Contextual Security

**Concept:** Extend the security processing to dynamically alter message content *before* delivery, adding or removing data based on recipient device context and current environmental factors. This goes beyond simple routing/filtering to proactive data manipulation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Contextual Data Gathering Module:**
    *   Collects real-time data from recipient device (with permission): Location, network conditions (bandwidth, latency, security type - WiFi, cellular), active applications, user profile (role, preferences), device health (battery level, CPU load).
    *   Collects environmental data: Time of day, geographic location, external threat intelligence feeds (known malware, phishing attempts).

2.  **‘Skin’ Definition Language (SDL):**
    *   A declarative language for defining ‘skins’ – rules that specify how a message is altered based on contextual data. 
    *   SDL allows definition of:
        *   Data masking: Replace sensitive data with placeholders or obfuscated values.
        *   Data enrichment: Add contextual information (e.g., current time, location) to the message.
        *   Data compression/expansion: Adjust message size based on network bandwidth.
        *   Payload switching: Deliver different message payloads based on recipient context (e.g. a simplified payload for low-bandwidth connections).
        *   Instruction set alterations: Dynamically change the instructions included within the message to optimize for the recipient device capabilities.

    *   Example SDL Rule:
        ```sdl
        IF device.location == "high_threat_area" AND message.type == "financial_transaction" THEN
          mask message.account_number
          add security_warning("Potential fraud risk detected.")
        ENDIF
        IF device.bandwidth < 500kbps THEN
          compress message.image_data
          replace message.video_data with message.thumbnail
        ENDIF
        ```

3.  **Message Interception & Processing Engine:**
    *   Intercepts messages as described in the patent.
    *   Retrieves relevant contextual data from the Contextual Data Gathering Module.
    *   Parses the message.
    *   Applies the appropriate ‘skin’ (determined by message type and recipient context) using the SDL rules.
    *   Modifies the message content accordingly.
    *   Publishes the modified message.

4.  **Dynamic Skin Management:**
    *   Administrative client can upload, modify, and deploy ‘skins’ to the Message Interception & Processing Engine.
    *   Versioning and A/B testing of ‘skins’ for optimization and security.
    *   Ability to define ‘skins’ based on broad categories (e.g., “emergency alerts”) or specific user groups.

**Pseudocode Example (Message Processing):**

```
function processMessage(message, recipientDevice) {
  contextData = getContextData(recipientDevice);
  applicableSkins = getApplicableSkins(message.type, contextData);

  for each skin in applicableSkins {
    message = applySkin(message, skin, contextData);
  }

  publishMessage(message);
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security by proactively removing or masking sensitive data based on real-time threats.
*   Improved user experience by optimizing message content for device capabilities and network conditions.
*   Increased resilience against attacks by dynamically altering message payloads.
*   Greater control over message content and delivery.
