## Dynamic Resource Negotiation via Predictive PSPs

**Concept:** Extend the Parameter Selection Policy (PSP) system to include predictive elements. Instead of solely reacting to client requests with predefined policies, proactively *negotiate* resource configurations based on predicted future needs, learned from client behavior.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Model Component:**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously monitor client resource request patterns – frequency, duration, resource types, associated metadata (application, user role, time of day, etc.).
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict future resource demand for each client (or client segment).  Model output: predicted resource requirements (CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth) over a defined horizon (e.g., next hour, next day).
*   **Confidence Interval:** Generate a confidence interval around the prediction to represent the uncertainty.

**2. Proactive PSP Generation:**

*   **PSP Trigger:** When the predicted resource need *exceeds* a pre-defined threshold (based on current allocation *and* confidence interval), trigger the creation of a "Proactive PSP".
*   **Proactive PSP Contents:** This PSP defines a resource configuration *in advance* of the actual client request.  It focuses on *optimizing* for the *predicted* need, not just fulfilling the immediate request. The PSP should include:
    *   Target Resource Configuration: CPU, memory, storage, network – optimized for the prediction.
    *   Activation Condition:  A time window. This PSP is only active during the predicted high-demand period.
    *   Rollback Condition: A condition to revert to the original configuration if the predicted demand does not materialize (e.g., monitored utilization falls below a threshold).
*   **Client Notification:** Notify the client (via an API) about the pending configuration change and the reason (predicted demand). Allow the client to *opt-out* (but log the opt-out for future model training).

**3. PSP Application & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Request Interception:** When a client request arrives during the Proactive PSP’s active window, *prioritize* the PSP’s configuration over the client’s specified parameters.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the allocated resources and actual utilization.
*   **Model Retraining:** Feed the actual utilization data back into the predictive model to refine its accuracy.  Include data on client opt-outs as negative feedback.
*   **PSP Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the PSP's configuration (e.g., scale up/down resources) based on real-time utilization.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Predictive Model Component
function predict_resource_demand(client_id, historical_data) {
  // Run time-series forecasting model
  predicted_demand = model.predict(historical_data)
  confidence_interval = model.get_confidence_interval(predicted_demand)
  return predicted_demand, confidence_interval
}

// Proactive PSP Generation
function generate_proactive_psp(client_id, predicted_demand, confidence_interval) {
  if (predicted_demand > current_allocation + confidence_interval) {
    psp = {
      target_configuration: optimize_resources(predicted_demand),
      activation_condition: "time window: next hour",
      rollback_condition: "utilization < threshold",
    }
    return psp
  } else {
    return null
  }
}

// Request Interception
function intercept_request(client_request, client_id) {
  psp = get_active_psp(client_id)
  if (psp != null) {
    // Apply PSP configuration to client request
    modified_request = apply_psp_configuration(client_request, psp)
    return modified_request
  } else {
    return client_request
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency for clients during peak demand.
*   Improved resource utilization.
*   Proactive problem solving.
*   Enhanced client experience.
*   Opportunity for tiered service offerings based on predictive capabilities.
