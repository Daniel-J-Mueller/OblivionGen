## Adaptive Database Sharding Based on Query Pattern Analysis

**Concept:** Dynamically shard a database not based on pre-defined key ranges, but on *real-time* query patterns. The system analyzes incoming queries, identifies frequently accessed data combinations, and *automatically* creates temporary shards optimized for those specific access patterns. This is in contrast to static sharding which requires pre-planning and can be inefficient for unpredictable workloads.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Query Pattern Analyzer (QPA)**
    *   Input: Raw SQL queries from application layer.
    *   Processing:
        *   Parse SQL queries to identify accessed tables, columns, and WHERE clause predicates.
        *   Aggregate query statistics (frequency of table/column access, predicate combinations).
        *   Employ a sliding window to track changing query patterns over time.
        *   Output:  "Access Profiles" – data structures representing frequently co-accessed data (e.g., {table: "Orders", columns: ["customer_id", "order_date"], predicate: "order_date > '2024-01-01'"}).
*   **Component 2: Dynamic Shard Manager (DSM)**
    *   Input: Access Profiles from QPA.
    *   Processing:
        *   Maintain a "Shard Blueprint" – a dynamic mapping of data subsets to physical shards.
        *   Based on Access Profile frequency and data co-access scores:
            *   **Shard Creation:** If a significant new Access Profile emerges, create a new temporary shard containing the relevant data.
            *   **Data Replication:** Replicate data subsets to the newly created shard. Use asynchronous replication to minimize impact on primary database.
            *   **Shard Promotion:** Temporarily promote the new shard to handle incoming queries matching the Access Profile.
            *   **Shard Demotion:** Monitor shard usage. If the Access Profile becomes infrequent, demote the shard and merge data back into the primary database.
        *   Utilize a cost model to determine optimal shard creation/demotion thresholds (consider replication cost, query performance gains, storage overhead).
*   **Component 3:  Query Router/Rewriter**
    *   Input: Incoming SQL queries, Shard Blueprint.
    *   Processing:
        *   Analyze queries to determine if they match any defined Access Profiles.
        *   If a match is found, rewrite the query to target the corresponding shard.
        *   If no match is found, route the query to the primary database.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Access Profile:*  { profile\_id: INT, tables: LIST\[STRING], columns: LIST\[STRING], predicates: STRING, frequency: INT }
    *   *Shard Blueprint:* { shard\_id: INT, profile\_id: INT, data\_location: STRING, status: ENUM\["active", "inactive"] }

**Pseudocode (Query Router/Rewriter):**

```
function route_query(query):
  access_profile = find_matching_access_profile(query)
  if access_profile != null:
    shard_id = access_profile.shard_id
    rewritten_query = rewrite_query_for_shard(query, shard_id)
    return rewritten_query, shard_id
  else:
    return query, primary_database_id
```

**Novelty:**

Existing sharding strategies are largely static or based on pre-defined keys. This design dynamically adapts to query patterns in real-time, offering significant performance gains for unpredictable workloads. The automatic shard creation and demotion minimize overhead and maximize resource utilization. It shifts from *data-centric* sharding to *query-centric* sharding.
