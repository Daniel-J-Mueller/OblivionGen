## Dynamic Focus-Stacked Video Generation

**Concept:** Extend the focal region modification to create dynamically focus-stacked video. Instead of simply cropping or resizing, leverage depth data (estimated or captured) to generate a video where the focal region remains sharply in focus *while* the out-of-focus regions subtly shift *as if* the focal plane is sweeping across the scene. This simulates a cinematic “rack focus” effect, but automated and driven by user-defined focal regions.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Standard video stream (RGB or similar) + Depth Map (either captured via depth sensor – LiDAR, structured light – or estimated via AI models).  If depth data isn’t directly available, integrate an AI-powered depth estimation module.
*   **Focal Region Definition:** User defines a focal region (polygon, rectangle, freeform selection) within each frame.  The system tracks this region’s movement across subsequent frames.
*   **Depth-Based Blurring:**  For each pixel *outside* the focal region:
    *   Calculate the pixel’s distance from the perceived focal plane (based on depth map data).
    *   Apply a Gaussian blur proportional to this distance.  Pixels further from the focal plane receive more blur.
    *   Blur radius dynamically adjusts *per frame* based on the depth map and focal region position.
*   **Rack Focus Simulation:**
    *   Subtly shift the focal plane between frames, creating the illusion of a “rack focus”.
    *   Shift amount controlled by a “focus speed” parameter.  Higher speed = faster focus shift.
    *   Option to constrain the focus shift to a specific trajectory (e.g., linearly, smoothly following an object).
*   **Output:** Modified video stream with simulated rack focus effect.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**  GPU acceleration highly recommended for real-time processing, particularly depth map processing and Gaussian blurring.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FOR each frame IN video_stream:
    depth_map = get_depth_map(frame)
    focal_region = get_focal_region(frame)

    FOR each pixel (x, y) IN frame:
        IF (x, y) IS NOT IN focal_region:
            depth = depth_map[x, y]
            distance_from_focal_plane = abs(depth - focal_plane_depth) // calculate distance from focal plane
            blur_radius = distance_from_focal_plane * blur_scale // adjust blur radius
            pixel_color = apply_gaussian_blur(pixel_color, blur_radius)
        ELSE:
            pixel_color = original_pixel_color
    
    output_frame = combine_pixels(pixel_colors)
    
    focal_plane_depth = smoothly_adjust_focal_depth(focal_plane_depth, focus_speed) // smoothly change focal plane
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Driven Focal Region Selection:** Automatically identify and highlight interesting objects or regions within the video, suggesting them as potential focal regions.
*   **Stylized Focus Effects:**  Experiment with different blurring algorithms and color grading techniques to create unique and artistic focus effects.
*   **Depth Map Generation from Stereo Video:**  If depth data isn’t available, utilize stereo vision techniques to estimate depth from multiple camera views.
*   **Integration with VR/AR:**  Apply the dynamic focus-stacked effect to VR/AR experiences to enhance realism and immersion.
