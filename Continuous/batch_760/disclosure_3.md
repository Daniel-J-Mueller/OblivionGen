## Adaptive Log Compaction with Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically adjusting log compaction frequency and prefetching data pages based on predicted access patterns.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on reclaiming space *after* a reclamation point. This specification focuses on *anticipating* reclamation needs and proactively managing data movement to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

**Components:**

1.  **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** Continuously monitors read requests for data pages. APA maintains a sliding window of recent access patterns, categorizing access frequency (hot, warm, cold), access sequence (sequential, random), and access correlation (frequently accessed together).

2.  **Log Compaction Scheduler (LCS):** Dynamically adjusts compaction frequency based on APA output. LCS uses a tiered approach:
    *   **Tier 1 (Critical):** If APA detects a sustained increase in access to log records within a specific data block *before* the current reclamation point, LCS immediately triggers compaction for that block. This prioritizes frequently accessed log data.
    *   **Tier 2 (Adaptive):** LCS calculates an optimal compaction frequency for each data block based on its access frequency and rate of change. Blocks with high access frequency and rapid change are compacted more often.
    *   **Tier 3 (Background):** Regular, low-priority compaction runs are scheduled to reclaim space from cold blocks and maintain overall system health.

3.  **Predictive Prefetcher (PP):** Based on APAâ€™s access sequence data, PP predicts which data pages will be required in the near future. PP proactively fetches these pages from base page storage and caches them in a read-optimized layer. This minimizes latency for subsequent read requests.

4.  **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Enhancement:** Modify the WAL mechanism to include metadata indicating the likelihood of future access. This metadata is used by PP to prioritize prefetching and LCS to optimize compaction.

**Pseudocode (LCS):**

```
function schedule_compaction(data_block):
  access_pattern = APA.get_access_pattern(data_block)
  frequency = access_pattern.frequency
  rate_of_change = access_pattern.rate_of_change
  
  if rate_of_change > threshold_critical:
    trigger_immediate_compaction(data_block)
    return
  
  compaction_frequency = calculate_adaptive_frequency(frequency, rate_of_change)
  schedule_compaction_run(data_block, compaction_frequency)
  
function calculate_adaptive_frequency(frequency, rate_of_change):
  # Use a function (linear, exponential, etc.) to map frequency and rate of change
  # to a compaction frequency.
  return base_frequency * (1 + frequency_multiplier * frequency + change_multiplier * rate_of_change)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Access Pattern Record:** {block_id, access_frequency, rate_of_change, access_sequence, correlation_data}
*   **Compaction Schedule:** {block_id, next_compaction_time}

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The thresholds for critical compaction and adaptive frequency calculation must be tuned based on system workload and hardware characteristics.
*   Consider using a machine learning model to predict access patterns with higher accuracy.
*   The predictive prefetcher should be designed to avoid excessive caching and wasted resources.
*   Monitor the performance of the adaptive compaction and prefetching mechanisms to ensure they are improving system efficiency.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency for read requests.
*   Increased throughput for write operations.
*   Improved overall system efficiency.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing workloads.
