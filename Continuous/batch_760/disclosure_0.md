**Dynamic Policy Inheritance & Reputation Scoring**

**Concept:** Extend the policy management system to incorporate a reputation-based scoring system for both users and applications, allowing for dynamic policy adjustments based on real-time behavior and trust levels. This moves beyond static policy assignments and enables a more fluid, adaptive security model.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Reputation Engine:**
    *   A dedicated service component responsible for calculating and maintaining reputation scores.
    *   Input factors for user reputation:
        *   Successful/Failed Authentication Attempts
        *   Access Patterns (frequency, time of day, sensitivity of accessed resources)
        *   Compliance with usage policies (data handling, acceptable use)
        *   Reported incidents/flags (from security monitoring or user reports)
    *   Input factors for application reputation:
        *   Vulnerability scans & patch levels
        *   User feedback/ratings
        *   Resource consumption patterns (detecting malicious behavior)
        *   Compliance with security standards.

2.  **Dynamic Policy Adjustment Module:**
    *   Monitors reputation scores for both users and applications in real-time.
    *   Applies weighted adjustments to existing policies based on reputation levels.
    *   Policy adjustments can include:
        *   Increasing/Decreasing Access Privileges
        *   Requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
        *   Restricting Access to Sensitive Data
        *   Triggering Security Alerts or Automated Remediation.

3.  **Policy Inheritance Graph:**
    *   Extend the policy mapping database to represent a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of policy inheritance.
    *   Allows policies to be inherited from multiple sources (e.g., user groups, roles, devices, application contexts).
    *   Dynamic policy adjustments propagate through the inheritance graph, automatically updating policies for all affected entities.

4.  **Behavioral Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Integrate machine learning models to detect anomalous behavior based on user and application activity.
    *   Anomaly detection triggers policy adjustments or security alerts, providing proactive threat mitigation.
    *   The system learns from both positive and negative behavior to refine anomaly detection models.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Policy Adjustment):**

```
function adjustPolicy(user, application) {
  userReputation = getReputation(user);
  appReputation = getReputation(application);

  basePolicy = getBasePolicy(user, application);

  // Weight factors for reputation adjustment
  userWeight = 0.6;
  appWeight = 0.4;

  adjustedPolicy = basePolicy;

  // Adjust access privileges based on reputation
  if (userReputation > 0.8 && appReputation > 0.8) {
    adjustedPolicy.accessLevel = "Full";
  } else if (userReputation < 0.2 || appReputation < 0.2) {
    adjustedPolicy.accessLevel = "Restricted";
    adjustedPolicy.requireMFA = true;
  } else {
    adjustedPolicy.accessLevel = "Standard";
  }

  return adjustedPolicy;
}

function getReputation(entity) {
  // Fetch reputation score from Reputation Engine
  // (Implementation details depend on the specific data model)
  return ReputationEngine.getScore(entity);
}

```

**Data Structures:**

*   **User Profile:** Stores user attributes, reputation score, and group memberships.
*   **Application Profile:** Stores application attributes, reputation score, and security vulnerabilities.
*   **Policy Object:** Defines access rights, security requirements, and inheritance relationships.
*   **Policy Graph:** Represents the DAG of policy inheritance.
