## Dynamic Landing Page Personalization via Multi-Modal Input

**Concept:** Expand beyond keyword-driven landing page selection to incorporate real-time user context derived from multiple input modalities (visual, auditory, behavioral) to dynamically construct a hyper-personalized landing page layout and content.

**Specifications:**

**1. Input Modules:**

*   **Visual Input:**
    *   Camera access (optional, user permission required).
    *   Object/Scene Recognition: Identify objects, scenes, or activities within the userâ€™s immediate environment (e.g., home office, kitchen, outdoor recreation).
    *   Facial Expression Analysis: Detect user emotional state (e.g., happiness, frustration, focus) from facial cues.
*   **Auditory Input:**
    *   Microphone access (optional, user permission required).
    *   Speech-to-Text: Transcribe spoken words/phrases.
    *   Ambient Sound Analysis: Identify environmental sounds (e.g., music, traffic, children playing).
*   **Behavioral Input:**
    *   Browser History: Track recent browsing activity (websites visited, searches performed).
    *   Application Usage: Monitor currently running applications.
    *   Device Sensors: Access accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS data (with user permission) to infer user activity (e.g., walking, driving, stationary).
*   **Traditional Input:**
    *   Keyword from initial search query (as in the base patent).

**2. Contextual Analysis Engine:**

*   **Data Fusion:** Combine data from all input modules.
*   **Machine Learning Models:** Employ pre-trained and fine-tuned ML models for:
    *   Scene Understanding: Interpret visual scenes.
    *   Sentiment Analysis: Gauge user emotional state.
    *   Intent Recognition: Determine user goals based on combined data.
    *   Activity Inference: Predict user activity based on sensor data.

**3. Dynamic Landing Page Generation:**

*   **Content Blocks:** A library of pre-designed content blocks (text, images, videos, interactive elements) categorized by theme, product, service, and emotional tone.
*   **Layout Templates:** A set of responsive layout templates that adapt to different screen sizes and content arrangements.
*   **Personalization Rules:** A rule engine that maps contextual insights to content blocks and layout templates.
    *   Example: If user is detected to be in a "home office" environment and expresses "frustration" through facial expression analysis, prioritize content blocks related to productivity tools and stress relief resources.
*   **A/B Testing Integration:** Automatically conduct A/B testing of different landing page configurations to optimize for user engagement and conversion rates.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side:**
    *   JavaScript SDK for capturing input data (with user permission).
    *   Real-time data transmission to the server.
*   **Server-Side:**
    *   API endpoints for receiving input data and returning personalized landing page configurations.
    *   Machine learning models for contextual analysis.
    *   Content management system for managing content blocks and layout templates.
    *   Database for storing user preferences and historical data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateLandingPage(userInput, visualInput, auditoryInput, behavioralInput) {

  context = analyzeContext(userInput, visualInput, auditoryInput, behavioralInput);

  // Determine optimal content blocks and layout based on context.
  contentBlocks = selectContentBlocks(context.environment, context.emotion, context.intent);
  layoutTemplate = selectLayoutTemplate(context.deviceType, contentBlocks.length);

  // Assemble landing page.
  landingPage = assembleLandingPage(layoutTemplate, contentBlocks);

  return landingPage;
}

function analyzeContext(userInput, visualInput, auditoryInput, behavioralInput) {
  //  Combine inputs and use ML models to infer context.
  environment = analyzeVisualInput(visualInput);
  emotion = analyzeFacialExpression(visualInput);
  intent = analyzeUserInput(userInput, auditoryInput, behavioralInput);

  return { environment: environment, emotion: emotion, intent: intent };
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Proactive Content Delivery:** Pre-fetch content blocks based on predicted user intent.
*   **Interactive Landing Pages:** Incorporate interactive elements (e.g., quizzes, polls, games) to increase user engagement.
*   **Voice-Activated Landing Pages:** Allow users to navigate landing pages using voice commands.
