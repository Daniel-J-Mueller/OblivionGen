## Multi-Layered Fluidic Logic Display

**Concept:** A display system utilizing multiple immiscible fluid layers within a single cavity, each layer representing a color channel (Red, Green, Blue), and controlled by a 3D array of microelectrodes. This allows for true volumetric pixel control and eliminates the need for traditional backlights or color filters.

**Specs:**

*   **Cavity Material:** Transparent polymer (PMMA or similar) with high dielectric strength. Dimensions scalable for various display sizes.
*   **Fluid Layers:** Three immiscible fluids: Red-dyed oil, Green-dyed oil, Blue-dyed oil.  Fluids must exhibit stable interfaces and minimal mixing.  Viscosity optimized for electrostatic responsiveness.
*   **Electrode Array:** Microelectrode array fabricated on a transparent substrate (ITO or similar).  Electrode pitch scaled for desired resolution. Each electrode individually addressable. Electrodes partially embedded within the cavity wall for closer fluid interaction. Electrode shape optimized for directional fluid movement.
*   **Layer Thickness:** Each fluid layer maintained at a consistent thickness (e.g., 50-100 microns) through precise cavity geometry and capillary action during filling.
*   **Control System:** High-voltage, high-frequency driver circuit capable of independently addressing each electrode in the array.  Control algorithm to map pixel data to electrode voltages.
*   **Addressing Scheme:** Volumetric pixels formed by selectively actuating electrodes within each fluid layer.  Brightness controlled by voltage level and pulse-width modulation.
*   **Interface:**  Data input via standard video interface (HDMI, DisplayPort).

**Pseudocode (Pixel Control):**

```
// Function to set pixel color (R, G, B) at coordinates (x, y)
function setPixelColor(x, y, red, green, blue) {

  // Calculate electrode addresses for the specified pixel coordinates
  redX = calculateRedElectrodeX(x);
  redY = calculateRedElectrodeY(y);
  greenX = calculateGreenElectrodeX(x);
  greenY = calculateGreenElectrodeY(y);
  blueX = calculateBlueElectrodeX(x);
  blueY = calculateBlueElectrodeY(y);

  // Apply voltage to red electrodes based on red intensity
  setVoltage(redX, redY, map(red, 0, 255, 0, maxVoltage));

  // Apply voltage to green electrodes based on green intensity
  setVoltage(greenX, greenY, map(green, 0, 255, 0, maxVoltage));

  // Apply voltage to blue electrodes based on blue intensity
  setVoltage(blueX, blueY, map(blue, 0, 255, 0, maxVoltage));
}

// Function to map a value from one range to another
function map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh) {
  return (value - fromLow) * (toHigh - toLow) / (fromHigh - fromLow) + toLow;
}
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond 2D fluidic displays towards true volumetric imaging, creating the potential for 3D displays without the need for glasses or specialized viewing angles. The multi-layer approach maximizes color gamut and brightness.  The microelectrode array enables precise control over fluid movement and pixel formation, allowing for high resolution and fast refresh rates.
