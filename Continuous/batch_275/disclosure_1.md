**Personalized Binaural Resonance Mapping & Amplification**

**Concept:** Expand individualized hearing compensation beyond frequency-specific gain adjustments to incorporate personalized binaural resonance mapping and amplification. This aims to restore not just *what* is heard, but *how* sound is spatially perceived, improving localization and overall sound quality, particularly for those with asymmetrical hearing loss.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires binaural (left/right) in-ear monitors (IEMs) or headphones with integrated high-precision microphones (at least 8kHz sampling rate), and a dedicated processing unit (integrated into a smartphone or external device).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Resonance Mapping:** The system performs a series of binaural recordings of the user in a controlled acoustic environment. This isn’t a typical audiogram. Instead, it captures the user's unique head-related transfer function (HRTF) – how their head, ears, and torso shape sound waves.  Microphones capture sound directly into each ear canal, and an external source emits sweeps. Analysis identifies resonant frequencies within the ear canal and skull – unique ‘fingerprints’ affected by hearing loss.  This creates a personalized resonance map for each ear.
    *   **Loss Compensation Engine:** Integrates the audiogram data (thresholds at various frequencies) *with* the resonance map. This is key. Rather than simply boosting frequencies where loss is detected, the engine determines how that loss *alters* the user’s natural resonance characteristics.  The algorithm calculates adjustments that restore not just amplitude, but also the phase and timing cues critical for spatial hearing.
    *   **Binaural Amplifier:** A digital signal processor (DSP) applies the individualized equalization and resonance restoration in real-time.  The amplification is applied *binaurally*, meaning the left and right channels are processed independently, accounting for any asymmetry in hearing loss.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously monitors the user’s listening environment using the IEM microphones.  Machine learning algorithms adapt the equalization and resonance restoration based on the environment (e.g., quiet room, noisy street, concert hall), and the user’s stated preferences (e.g., “more natural,” “more clear”).

*   **Data Representation:** Resonance map stored as a complex frequency response function for each ear, with resolution down to 100Hz.  Compensation data stored as a set of FIR filter coefficients, updated in real-time.

*   **User Interface:** App-based control with adjustable parameters:
    *   Correction Strength (0-100%)
    *   Listening Profile (e.g., “Music,” “Speech,” “Natural”)
    *   Environment Adaptation (automatic/manual)
    *   Visual representation of resonance map (for advanced users)

**Pseudocode (Compensation Engine):**

```
function compensateAudio(audioData, resonanceMapLeft, resonanceMapRight, audiogramDataLeft, audiogramDataRight):
  // 1. Apply Audiogram Correction
  correctedAudioLeft = applyAudiogram(audioData, audiogramDataLeft)
  correctedAudioRight = applyAudiogram(audioData, audiogramDataRight)

  // 2. Apply Resonance Restoration
  restoredAudioLeft = restoreResonance(correctedAudioLeft, resonanceMapLeft)
  restoredAudioRight = restoreResonance(correctedAudioRight, resonanceMapRight)

  // 3. Binaural Mixing
  binauralAudio = mixBinaural(restoredAudioLeft, restoredAudioRight)

  return binauralAudio

function restoreResonance(audioData, resonanceMap):
  // Analyze audio spectrum
  spectrum = FFT(audioData)

  // Calculate phase correction based on resonance map
  phaseCorrection = calculatePhaseCorrection(spectrum, resonanceMap)

  // Apply phase correction to audio spectrum
  correctedSpectrum = applyPhaseCorrection(spectrum, phaseCorrection)

  // Convert back to time domain
  restoredAudio = IFFT(correctedSpectrum)

  return restoredAudio
```

**Innovation:**  Moving beyond simple frequency equalization to address *how* sound is perceived, restoring spatial cues and providing a more natural, immersive listening experience, especially for those with complex or asymmetrical hearing loss. The personalized resonance mapping creates a truly individualized sonic profile.
