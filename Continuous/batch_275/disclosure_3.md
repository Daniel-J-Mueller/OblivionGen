## Dynamic Policy Inheritance via Tag Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the signed tagging metadata concept to enable *dynamic* policy inheritance between resources, creating a reactive and adaptable security/access control framework. Instead of policies being directly *applied* via tags, tags act as *triggers* for policy propagation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Policy Definition Language (PDL):** A new language is needed to express policies not as static rules, but as *propagation rules*. These rules define *how* tags on one resource influence the policies of other resources. 

    *   Example: `IF resource.tag == "sensitive_data" THEN propagate policy "encryption_required" to all dependent resources.`
    *   PDL supports wildcards, regular expressions, and logical operators for complex rule creation.
    *   PDL integrates with existing policy engines (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure Policy).

2.  **Tag Propagation Service (TPS):**  A dedicated service responsible for monitoring tag changes and executing propagation rules.

    *   TPS subscribes to tag update events within the resource environment.
    *   Upon tag change, TPS analyzes the updated resource and identifies applicable propagation rules.
    *   TPS identifies dependent resources (defined by relationships established during system configuration - see below).
    *   TPS applies or modifies policies on dependent resources based on the propagation rules.

3.  **Resource Dependency Mapping:** A system to define relationships between resources.  This could be implemented as a graph database or a metadata store.

    *   Resources are nodes in the graph.
    *   Edges represent dependencies (e.g., a virtual machine depends on a storage volume, a database depends on a network firewall).
    *   Dependencies are discoverable through automated scanning (e.g., analyzing network traffic, examining configuration files).

4.  **Signed Propagation Requests:**  Propagation actions are digitally signed by the TPS to ensure integrity and prevent unauthorized policy changes. 

    *   Each propagation request includes the source resource, target resource(s), the applied policy change, and a digital signature.
    *   Receiving resources verify the signature before applying the policy change.

5.  **Policy Versioning & Rollback:**  Maintain a history of policy changes applied through tag propagation.  Enable rollback to previous versions if necessary.

**Pseudocode (TPS core logic):**

```
on TagUpdateEvent(resource, tagKey, tagValue):
  propagationRules = getPropagationRulesForTag(tagKey, tagValue)
  for rule in propagationRules:
    dependentResources = getDependentResources(resource, rule.dependencyType)
    for targetResource in dependentResources:
      policyChange = rule.generatePolicyChange(resource, targetResource)
      signedRequest = sign(policyChange)
      send(targetResource, signedRequest)
      logPolicyChange(resource, targetResource, policyChange)
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Automated Data Protection:** Tag data as "confidential" – automatically encrypt dependent storage volumes and enforce access control policies.
*   **Compliance Enforcement:** Tag resources with compliance requirements (e.g., "HIPAA") – automatically configure logging, auditing, and security settings.
*   **Dynamic Security Zones:**  Create security zones based on tags – automatically update firewall rules and network policies.
*   **Automated Disaster Recovery:** Tag resources as "critical" – automatically prioritize replication and failover in disaster recovery scenarios.
