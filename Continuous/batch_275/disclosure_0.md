## Adaptive Resolution Streaming with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the screen data sharing to leverage variable resolution streaming coupled with a predictive pre-fetch system. The goal is to dynamically adjust the resolution of streamed screen data based on network conditions *and* predicted user focus within the shared screen, optimizing bandwidth usage and perceived latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Streaming Engine:**

*   **Variable Bitrate Encoding:**  Implement a video encoder (e.g., H.265/HEVC, AV1) capable of dynamically adjusting the bitrate and resolution of streamed screen data.  The base resolution will match the primary display, but can scale down significantly.
*   **Per-Region Resolution Control:** Divide the shared screen into a grid of configurable regions (e.g., 8x8, 16x16). Each region can have its own quality setting (resolution and bitrate).  Higher-quality regions will receive more bandwidth.
*   **Region Priority:** Each region will have a priority level, determined by the system.  Initial priority will be uniform.

**2. Focus Prediction Module:**

*   **Eye-Tracking Integration (Optional):** If available, utilize eye-tracking data from either the sharing or receiving device to identify the user's gaze location.
*   **Motion Vector Analysis:** Analyze motion vectors within the screen data to identify areas of high activity or change (e.g., a moving cursor, game character, rapidly updating UI).
*   **UI Element Detection:** Implement an algorithm to detect common UI elements (buttons, text fields, scrollbars) and assign priority based on element type (interactive elements get higher priority).
*   **Heuristic Combination:** Combine data from eye-tracking (if available), motion vector analysis, and UI element detection to calculate a “focus score” for each region.

**3. Adaptive Streaming Logic:**

*   **Bandwidth Estimation:** Continuously estimate available network bandwidth between the sharing and receiving devices.
*   **Priority-Based Allocation:** Allocate bandwidth to regions based on their focus score and the estimated network capacity. Regions with high focus scores receive a larger share of bandwidth.
*   **Dynamic Resolution Adjustment:** Adjust the resolution of each region based on its allocated bandwidth. Higher-bandwidth regions can be rendered at higher resolutions, while lower-bandwidth regions are downscaled.
*   **Pre-Fetch Buffer:** Maintain a pre-fetch buffer of screen data for each region. This buffer will contain several frames of data at different resolutions.
*   **Predictive Fetching:** Utilize the focus prediction module to anticipate where the user will look next and pre-fetch screen data for that region at a high resolution.
*   **Quality Switching:** Dynamically switch between different quality levels (resolution and bitrate) for each region based on network conditions and the focus prediction.  Seamless transitions are crucial.

**4.  Communication Protocol:**

*   **Real-time Control Channel:** Establish a real-time control channel between the sharing and receiving devices to exchange focus prediction data, bandwidth estimates, and quality control commands.
*   **Region Metadata:** Include metadata with each streamed region indicating its resolution, bitrate, and priority.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// On Receiving Device

loop:
  bandwidth = estimateNetworkBandwidth()
  focusScores = calculateFocusScores(screenData)

  for each region:
    allocatedBandwidth = calculateAllocatedBandwidth(bandwidth, focusScores[region])
    regionQuality = determineRegionQuality(allocatedBandwidth) // Determines resolution and bitrate
    requestRegionData(region, regionQuality)

  displayRegionData()
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced bandwidth consumption.
*   Lower latency.
*   Improved user experience, particularly in low-bandwidth environments.
*   Enhanced responsiveness for interactive applications.
*   Potential for increased framerates.
