## Adaptive Encryption Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of data encryption based on real-time risk assessment and data sensitivity. Current systems generally encrypt at a file or block level. This proposes encryption at the *field* or even *sub-field* level within data structures, allowing for minimized exposure in case of compromise.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Structure Analysis Module:** A component responsible for parsing incoming data structures (JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers, etc.) and identifying individual data fields and their associated sensitivity levels (defined by metadata tags or policies).
*   **Real-time Risk Assessment Engine:** This engine calculates a risk score based on factors like user access levels, network conditions, data location, and threat intelligence feeds. The risk score dictates the level of granularity for encryption.
*   **Granularity Control Layer:** This layer implements the actual encryption/decryption based on the risk score and the data structure analysis.  It supports multiple encryption algorithms and key management systems.
*   **Dynamic Key Rotation System:** Keys are rotated frequently, especially for high-risk data fields, based on the risk score.
*   **Metadata Tagging Standard:** A standardized system for tagging data fields with sensitivity levels. This can be based on existing standards or a new custom system.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Control Layer):**

```
function encryptData(data, riskScore, metadata) {
  // metadata is a list of {field_name: sensitivity_level} pairs
  encryptedData = {}

  for each field in data {
    sensitivity = metadata[field.name]
    if (sensitivity == "high" && riskScore > 0.7) {
      // Field-level encryption with strong algorithm
      encryptedData[field.name] = encryptField(field.value, strongKey)
    } else if (sensitivity == "medium" && riskScore > 0.4) {
      // Sub-field level encryption with moderate algorithm
      encryptedData[field.name] = encryptSubField(field.value, moderateKey)
    } else {
      // No encryption (or simple hashing)
      encryptedData[field.name] = field.value
    }
  }

  return encryptedData
}

function decryptData(encryptedData, riskScore, metadata) {
  //Similar logic to encryptData, but in reverse
}
```

**Key Management Considerations:**

*   Separate key pools for different sensitivity levels and granularity levels.
*   Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for secure key storage and management.
*   Automated key rotation policies based on risk score and data sensitivity.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Protecting sensitive data in cloud environments.
*   Securing Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
*   Enhancing data privacy in financial applications.
*   Improving data security in healthcare systems.
