## Vehicle Swarm Acoustic Mapping & Predictive Hazard System

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the vehicle-based sensor data collection described in the provided patent to create a dynamic, real-time acoustic map of the surrounding environment. This map isn’t visually rendered, but exists as a data structure used for predictive hazard analysis. It leverages the combined microphone arrays of multiple vehicles (a “swarm”) to detect and classify sounds *before* they become visually apparent to any single vehicle.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **High-Density Microphone Array:** Each vehicle equipped with the system will have a minimum of 64 MEMS microphones strategically placed around the vehicle's perimeter (roof, bumpers, wheel wells). These are synchronized using a high-precision time protocol (e.g., PTP).
*   **Edge Compute Unit:** A dedicated onboard computer handles pre-processing of audio data, feature extraction, and local hazard assessment.
*   **Secure Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication:** Dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) or C-V2X for low-latency data exchange between vehicles.
*   **Central Server (Optional):** For long-term data aggregation, model refinement, and fleet-level hazard prediction. However, the core system is designed to function effectively *without* a constant cloud connection.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Acoustic Feature Extraction Module:**
    *   Performs Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) on the raw audio data to convert it into the frequency domain.
    *   Extracts features such as spectral centroid, spectral bandwidth, spectral roll-off, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and chroma features. These represent the ‘acoustic fingerprint’ of the sounds.
2.  **Sound Event Detection (SED) Module:**
    *   Uses pre-trained machine learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks) to classify detected sounds into categories such as:
        *   Emergency vehicle sirens
        *   Construction sounds (jackhammers, reversing beepers)
        *   Animal sounds (wildlife near roadways)
        *   Human voices (shouting, distress calls)
        *   Impact sounds (collisions, debris strikes)
        *   Mechanical failures (tire blowouts, engine knocking)
    *   Assigns confidence scores to each detected sound event.
3.  **Swarm Acoustic Mapping Module:**
    *   Aggregates sound event data from multiple vehicles within a defined radius.
    *   Uses triangulation or time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) techniques to estimate the *location* of the sound source.
    *   Creates a dynamic acoustic map representing the probability of hazards in different areas. The map isn’t a visual representation; it’s a spatial data structure.
4.  **Predictive Hazard Analysis Module:**
    *   Analyzes the acoustic map, vehicle speed, trajectory, and road conditions.
    *   Predicts potential hazards *before* they become visually apparent (e.g., a hidden pedestrian approaching an intersection, an animal about to cross the road).
    *   Generates warnings for the driver or triggers automated safety systems (e.g., automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Hazard Analysis):**

```
FUNCTION predict_hazard(vehicle_data, acoustic_map):
  // vehicle_data contains: speed, trajectory, road_conditions
  // acoustic_map is a spatial data structure of hazard probabilities
  
  hazard_risk = 0
  
  // Check for high-probability hazards within a certain radius of the vehicle
  FOR hazard IN acoustic_map.get_hazards_within_radius(vehicle_data.speed, 100):
    IF hazard.probability > 0.7:
      hazard_risk += hazard.severity * (1 - (hazard.distance / 50)) // Higher risk for closer hazards
      
  // Adjust risk based on vehicle speed and road conditions
  IF vehicle_data.speed > 60 AND vehicle_data.road_conditions == "wet":
    hazard_risk *= 1.2
    
  // Generate warning if hazard risk exceeds threshold
  IF hazard_risk > 0.8:
    GENERATE_WARNING("Potential hazard detected", hazard.type, hazard.distance)
    
  RETURN hazard_risk
```

**Data Exchange Protocol:**

Vehicles will broadcast the following data packets:

*   Vehicle ID
*   Timestamp
*   GPS Coordinates
*   List of detected sound events (type, confidence, estimated location)

These packets will be transmitted using a dedicated V2V communication channel. Data will be prioritized based on urgency (e.g., emergency vehicle sirens will have the highest priority). A simple consensus algorithm can be used to filter out spurious or conflicting data from different vehicles.
