## Dynamic Webpage Component 'Provenance' Visualization – Temporal Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the component-tracing functionality to capture a *temporal* history of component interactions during page generation. Instead of simply showing *what* components were used, visualize *when* they were invoked relative to each other, creating a dynamic timeline layered onto the webpage. This creates a "provenance" view of the page’s creation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Instrumentation:** Modify the trace utility to record not only component invocation, but also precise timestamps (down to milliseconds) for start and completion of each component's execution.  Capture parent-child relationships between components as they occur during the generation process.

2.  **Data Structure:**  A `ComponentInvocation` object will hold:
    *   `componentID`: Unique identifier for the component.
    *   `startTime`: Timestamp of invocation.
    *   `endTime`: Timestamp of completion.
    *   `parentComponentID`: ID of the component that initiated this one (null for the root component).
    *   `dataPayload`:  Any data passed *to* the component.
    *   `returnValue`: Any data returned *from* the component.

3.  **Provenance Graph Generation:**  A server-side process will take the `ComponentInvocation` data and construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the execution flow. Nodes are components, and edges represent invocation dependencies with edge weights corresponding to execution time (duration).

4.  **Webpage Integration:**
    *   Embed a “Provenance View” toggle button on the webpage.
    *   When enabled, inject a JavaScript module that fetches the provenance graph (either statically embedded or fetched via API).
    *   The JavaScript module renders the graph using a visual library (e.g., D3.js, Vis.js) overlaid *onto* the existing webpage.
    *   Components on the webpage are dynamically linked to corresponding nodes in the provenance graph.

5.  **Interactive Features:**
    *   **Timeline Scrubbing:** Allow the user to “scrub” through the timeline of page generation. As the user moves the scrub bar, the webpage visually highlights the components that were actively executing at that point in time.
    *   **Component Highlighting:** Clicking a component on the webpage will highlight its node in the provenance graph and vice versa.
    *   **Data Inspection:** Hovering over a node in the graph will display the `dataPayload` and `returnValue` associated with that component.
    *   **"What-If" Analysis (Advanced):** Allow users to manually adjust component execution times or even disable components to observe the impact on the overall page generation process. This functionality could be used for performance tuning and debugging.

**Pseudocode (JavaScript - simplified):**

```javascript
// Assume 'provenanceData' is the fetched provenance graph (array of ComponentInvocation objects)

function renderProvenanceView(provenanceData) {
  // Create a graph visualization using a library like D3.js or Vis.js

  const nodes = provenanceData.map(component => ({
    id: component.componentID,
    label: component.componentID,
    start: component.startTime,
    end: component.endTime
  }));

  const edges = provenanceData.filter(component => component.parentComponentID != null).map(component => ({
    from: component.parentComponentID,
    to: component.componentID,
    arrows: 'to'
  }));
  
  // Use visualization library to create a dynamic graph representation on the webpage
  // Overlay this graph on top of the existing webpage content
  // Implement interactive features (timeline scrubbing, component highlighting, etc.)
}

// Event listener to toggle the provenance view
document.getElementById('toggleProvenance').addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Fetch provenance data from server (if not already available)
  fetch('/provenanceData')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => renderProvenanceView(data));
});
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with performance monitoring tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
*   Anomaly detection: Automatically highlight components that deviate from expected execution patterns.
*   User-defined events: Allow developers to inject custom events into the provenance graph to track specific application logic.
*   Cross-browser compatibility testing: Visualize component execution across different browsers and devices.
