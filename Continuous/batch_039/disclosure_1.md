## Adaptive Query Shaping with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the cooperative preemption concept by introducing predictive resource allocation based on query characteristics and historical performance data. Rather than *reacting* to resource constraints, proactively shape queries *before* execution to minimize preemption likelihood and optimize resource utilization.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Query Profiler Module:**
    *   Input: Incoming SQL query.
    *   Process: Analyzes query structure (joins, filters, aggregations), estimated data size, and historical execution statistics for similar queries.
    *   Output: Query profile – a data structure containing metadata about the query’s resource requirements and potential execution paths.

2.  **Resource Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Query profile, current resource pool state (available nodes, load), historical resource usage data, and provider network capacity.
    *   Process: Uses a machine learning model (e.g., time-series forecasting, regression) to predict resource availability *during* the query’s estimated execution time. Predicts contention points and potential for preemption.
    *   Output: Resource availability forecast – a time-series prediction of resource availability for the duration of the query.

3.  **Query Shaping Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Query profile, resource availability forecast.
    *   Process: Dynamically modifies the query to reduce resource consumption or shift execution patterns. Possible transformations include:
        *   **Query Decomposition:** Breaking down a complex query into smaller, independent subqueries.
        *   **Data Sampling/Sketching:** Using sampling techniques to estimate results without processing the entire dataset.
        *   **Join Reordering:** Altering the order of joins to minimize intermediate data sizes.
        *   **Pushdown Optimization:** Pushing filters and aggregations closer to the data source.
        *   **Resource Hinting:** Adding hints to the query execution engine to prioritize specific resources or execution strategies.
    *   Output: Shaped query – a modified SQL query optimized for predicted resource availability.

4.  **Preemption Negotiation Protocol:**
    *   If, despite query shaping, preemption remains likely, initiate a negotiation with the query execution service.
    *   The negotiation protocol will determine whether the query can be safely paused and resumed without data corruption or significant performance degradation.
    *   If preemption is unavoidable, the protocol will facilitate a smooth handover of state and resources.

**Pseudocode (Query Shaping Algorithm):**

```
function shapeQuery(queryProfile, resourceForecast) {
  shapedQuery = query // Initial query
  contentionPoints = detectContention(resourceForecast)

  for each contentionPoint in contentionPoints {
    if (contentionPoint.type == "CPU") {
      // Apply CPU optimization techniques (e.g., query decomposition)
      shapedQuery = decomposeQuery(shapedQuery, contentionPoint.time)
    } else if (contentionPoint.type == "Memory") {
      // Apply memory optimization techniques (e.g., data sampling)
      shapedQuery = sampleData(shapedQuery, contentionPoint.time)
    } else if (contentionPoint.type == "IO") {
      // Apply IO optimization techniques (e.g., pushdown optimization)
      shapedQuery = pushdownFilters(shapedQuery, contentionPoint.time)
    }
  }
  return shapedQuery
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Sufficient compute resources to run the machine learning models and query analysis algorithms.
*   Real-time monitoring of resource pool state.
*   Integration with existing query execution service.
*   Database profiling tools to collect historical execution statistics.
