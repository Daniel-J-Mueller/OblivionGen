## Adaptive Cookie Partitioning via Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend cookie classification beyond network classification (internal/external) to include user behavior biometrics. This allows for dynamic, granular cookie access control, increasing security and privacy without sacrificing usability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Biometric Data Collection:**

*   **Data Points:** Collect data on keystroke dynamics, mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns), scrolling behavior, and time spent on pages. Device orientation and touch pressure (if applicable) should also be included.  Data is gathered *after* explicit user consent.
*   **Collection Method:**  A lightweight JavaScript component embedded in web pages will collect the data. Data is anonymized and aggregated locally before transmission.
*   **Frequency:** Data collection occurs in the background without impacting page load times.  Data is sampled at a rate of 10-20 Hz.
*   **Storage:**  Collected data is stored locally in encrypted browser storage.

**2. Biometric Profile Creation:**

*   **Baseline Establishment:** A user's baseline biometric profile is created after a learning period (e.g., 1-2 weeks) of typical behavior.
*   **Profile Storage:** The biometric profile is encrypted and stored on the user's device or, with explicit user consent, on a privacy-respecting server.
*   **Profile Updates:** The profile is continuously updated to reflect changes in user behavior.

**3. Cookie Access Control:**

*   **Cookie Tagging:** Cookies are tagged with a “Behavioral Trust Score” (BTS) based on the behavior observed during cookie creation.  Initial BTS is low.
*   **Real-time Behavior Analysis:** When a website attempts to access a cookie, the system analyzes the user’s *current* behavior.
*   **Behavioral Matching:** The current behavior is compared to the stored biometric profile.  A similarity score is calculated.
*   **Dynamic BTS Adjustment:** The cookie’s BTS is adjusted based on the similarity score. High similarity increases BTS; low similarity decreases BTS.
*   **Access Thresholds:** Cookie access is granted or denied based on the BTS.  A configurable threshold determines the minimum acceptable BTS.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  If the current behavior deviates significantly from the stored profile (indicating potential fraud or account takeover), cookie access is automatically denied and the user is prompted for re-authentication.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Browser Extension/Component:** A lightweight browser extension or JavaScript component will handle data collection, profile storage, and cookie access control.
*   **Backend Service (Optional):** A backend service can be used for:
    *   Secure profile storage (with user consent).
    *   Aggregation of behavioral data for improved anomaly detection.
    *   Sharing of threat intelligence across users.

**Pseudocode (Cookie Access Control):**

```
function accessCookie(cookie, website):
  currentBehavior = collectBehavioralData()
  profile = loadUserProfile()
  similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(currentBehavior, profile)
  cookie.BTS = adjustBTS(cookie.BTS, similarityScore)

  if cookie.BTS >= accessThreshold:
    return cookieData //Grant access
  else:
    logAccessDenied()
    denyAccess()
    promptReauthentication()
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User visits a website.
2.  Browser component collects behavioral data.
3.  Component loads user profile (if available).
4.  Component calculates similarity score.
5.  Component adjusts cookie BTS.
6.  Component grants or denies cookie access based on BTS and threshold.
7.  Behavioral data is used to update the user profile.

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond simple network-based cookie classification by incorporating *user behavior* as a key factor in access control. This provides a more dynamic and robust security mechanism that can adapt to changing user behavior and potential threats. It offers a stronger privacy benefit, as it doesn't rely solely on categorization, but on verified identity based on behavior.
