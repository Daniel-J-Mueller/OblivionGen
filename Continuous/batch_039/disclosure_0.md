## Dynamic Authentication Beaconing with Spatial Awareness

**Concept:** Augment the existing authentication scheme with a localized, time-sensitive beaconing system utilizing low-energy Bluetooth (LE) or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signals. This creates a "trusted zone" around the user, adding a spatial dimension to authentication.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Hardware:** Small, low-power BLE/UWB beacons deployed in known, secure locations (user's home, office, car, trusted retail locations).
*   **User Device Integration:** The userâ€™s computing device (phone, laptop) continuously scans for these beacons.
*   **Beacon Identification:** Each beacon broadcasts a unique ID and a timestamp.
*   **Authentication Workflow:**
    1.  Initiate authentication request (as per existing patent).
    2.  User device checks for nearby beacons.
    3.  If a beacon is detected *within a defined range* (e.g., 5 meters) and the timestamp is recent (e.g., within the last 30 seconds):
        *   The beacon ID and timestamp are included in the authentication data sent to the remote system.
        *   The remote system verifies the beacon ID against a registered list and validates the timestamp.
        *   Authentication is granted, *with increased trust*.
    4.  If no beacon is detected, or the timestamp is stale: Fallback to existing authentication methods.
*   **Trust Levels:** Authentication can be tiered based on beacon presence:
    *   **High Trust:** Beacon present and validated. Enables frictionless transactions, access to sensitive data, etc.
    *   **Medium Trust:** Existing authentication methods pass. Standard access.
    *   **Low Trust:**  Authentication fails. Requires multi-factor authentication or intervention.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Beacon Spoofing:** Use signal strength and triangulation to verify beacon location. Regularly rotate beacon IDs. Implement cryptographic challenges.
    *   **Relay Attacks:** Limit beacon range. Implement time-of-flight (ToF) measurements to verify proximity.
    *   **Privacy:** Beacon IDs should be pseudonymous and rotated. User should have control over beacon association.

**Pseudocode (User Device):**

```
FUNCTION scanForBeacons():
    beaconList = BLE/UWB scan()
    filteredBeacons = []
    FOR beacon IN beaconList:
        IF isValidBeacon(beacon):  //Signal strength, ID check, Timestamp check
            filteredBeacons.append(beacon)
    RETURN filteredBeacons

FUNCTION isValidBeacon(beacon):
  // Check signal strength
  IF beacon.signalStrength < MIN_SIGNAL_STRENGTH:
    RETURN FALSE
  // Check beacon ID against registered list
  IF beacon.id NOT IN registeredBeaconIDs:
    RETURN FALSE
  // Check timestamp
  IF (currentTime - beacon.timestamp) > MAX_TIMESTAMP_DELAY:
    RETURN FALSE
  RETURN TRUE

FUNCTION initiateAuthentication():
  beacons = scanForBeacons()
  authenticationData = getExistingAuthenticationData()

  IF beacons.length > 0:
    authenticationData.beaconID = beacons[0].id
    authenticationData.beaconTimestamp = beacons[0].timestamp
    trustLevel = HIGH
  ELSE:
    trustLevel = MEDIUM

  sendAuthenticationData(authenticationData, trustLevel)
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Dynamic Beacon Assignment:** Assign beacons to users based on their location history and activity patterns.
*   **Predictive Beaconing:** Use machine learning to predict when a user is likely to be near a trusted beacon and proactively initiate authentication.
*   **Integration with IoT Devices:** Leverage existing IoT devices (smart speakers, smart locks) as authentication beacons.
*   **Geofencing:** Implement geofencing as a fallback or complementary authentication method.
