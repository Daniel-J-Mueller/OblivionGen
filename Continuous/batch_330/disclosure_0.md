## Dynamic Document Reconstruction with Temporal Anchors

**Concept:** Extend the overlay system to not just annotate *existing* document states, but to facilitate reconstruction of prior document states, essentially creating a "time machine" for collaborative editing. This is achieved by recording not just the overlay *data*, but also the *changes* made to the base document alongside associated timestamps, forming a temporal anchor system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Temporal Anchor Data Structure:**  Each overlay will be associated with a series of "Temporal Anchors."  A Temporal Anchor consists of:
    *   `AnchorID`: Unique identifier for the anchor.
    *   `Timestamp`:  Precise timestamp of the document state change.
    *   `ChangeSet`: A diff/patch representing the changes made to the document since the *previous* anchor (or initial document state). This could be line-based, character-based, or object-based, depending on the document type.
    *   `OverlayData`: The overlay data *at this specific point in time*.
    *   `UserIdentifier`: The user responsible for this change.

*   **API Extensions:**
    *   `CreateAnchor()`: API call to create a new Temporal Anchor. This should be triggered automatically on significant document changes (e.g., after each keystroke, paste operation, formatting change). The system must intelligently batch changes to minimize overhead.
    *   `ReconstructDocument(AnchorID)`:  API call to reconstruct the document to the state it was at the specified AnchorID. The system will apply the ChangeSets sequentially from the initial document state up to the requested AnchorID.
    *   `GetAnchorTimeline()`: Returns a list of AnchorIDs sorted by Timestamp. Useful for creating a visual timeline of document evolution.
    *   `DiffAnchors(AnchorID1, AnchorID2)`: Returns a diff/patch representing the changes between two Anchor states.

*   **System Architecture:**
    *   A dedicated “Temporal Database” will store the Temporal Anchor data. This could be a time-series database or a relational database with appropriate indexing.
    *   A "Reconstruction Engine" will handle the application of ChangeSets to reconstruct the document. This should be optimized for performance, potentially using caching and parallel processing.
    *   The system should support branching and merging of document timelines, allowing for experimentation and parallel editing streams.  Branching would involve creating a new root Anchor and diverging from the existing timeline.

*   **Pseudocode (ReconstructDocument):**

```
function ReconstructDocument(AnchorID, InitialDocument):
    // Fetch all Anchors up to AnchorID
    AnchorList = FetchAnchors(0, AnchorID)

    CurrentDocument = InitialDocument

    for each Anchor in AnchorList:
        ApplyPatch(CurrentDocument, Anchor.ChangeSet) // Apply the change
        CurrentDocument = CurrentDocument // Update for next iteration

    return CurrentDocument
```

*   **User Interface Considerations:**
    *   A visual timeline allowing users to scrub through document history.
    *   “Diff View” showing the changes made between any two Anchor states.
    *   Ability to revert to any previous document state.
    *   Branch/Merge visualization.

This system creates a fully auditable, version-controlled document environment, opening up opportunities for advanced collaboration features like conflict resolution, blame tracking, and predictive editing.
