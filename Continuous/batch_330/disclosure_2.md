## Secure Data Sharding with Dynamic Key Orchestration

**Concept:** Leverage the secure storage capabilities to enable a data sharding system where data is fragmented, encrypted with unique, short-lived internal keys, and distributed across multiple storage devices.  This differs from traditional sharding by tightly integrating the key management with the storage itself, providing a higher degree of security and potentially performance benefits.

**Specs:**

*   **Sharding Engine API:** Expose a public API for applications to initiate sharding operations.  Parameters include: data to shard, desired number of shards, security policy (lifetime of keys, allowed operations on shards).
*   **Key Orchestration Module:**  Responsible for generating, distributing, and managing the unique internal keys for each shard.  Each key should have a short, pre-defined lifetime (e.g., hours, days).  Keys are generated *within* the storage device's secure enclave (using existing cryptographic hardware).
*   **Shard Distribution Protocol:** Defines how shards are distributed across multiple storage devices.  A hash function determines the destination storage device for each shard, ensuring data is spread evenly.  Protocol must be fault tolerant.
*   **Data Reconstruction API:** Provides a mechanism for applications to request the reconstruction of the original data. The API requires authentication and authorization.
*   **Key Revocation Mechanism:**  Implement a secure key revocation mechanism to invalidate compromised or expired keys.  Revocation lists are maintained and enforced by each storage device.

**Workflow:**

1.  Application calls the Sharding Engine API with the data to shard and security policy.
2.  Sharding Engine generates a unique shard ID for each fragment.
3.  Key Orchestration Module generates a unique unexportable internal key for each shard ID. The key's lifetime is determined by the security policy.
4.  Data is encrypted with the corresponding internal key.
5.  The encrypted shard is sent to a designated storage device (determined by the shard ID and distribution protocol).
6.  The storage device securely stores the shard and the associated metadata (shard ID, key lifetime, revocation status).
7.  When reconstruction is requested, the Sharding Engine determines the location of each shard.
8.  The Sharding Engine requests the shards from the respective storage devices.
9.  Each storage device decrypts the shard using the associated internal key and returns the decrypted data.
10. The Sharding Engine reassembles the shards to reconstruct the original data.

**Pseudocode (Sharding Engine â€“ Simplified):**

```
function shardData(data, numShards, securityPolicy):
  shardSize = data.length / numShards
  shards = []
  for i = 0 to numShards - 1:
    shard = data.substring(i * shardSize, (i + 1) * shardSize)
    shardId = generateUniqueId()
    internalKey = keyOrchestration.generateKey(shardId, securityPolicy)
    encryptedShard = crypto.encrypt(shard, internalKey)
    targetDevice = distributionProtocol.selectDevice(shardId)
    sendShardToDevice(encryptedShard, targetDevice, shardId)
    shards.append(shardId)
  return shards

function reconstructData(shardIds):
  decryptedShards = []
  for shardId in shardIds:
    device = distributionProtocol.locateDevice(shardId)
    encryptedShard = requestShardFromDevice(device, shardId)
    internalKey = keyOrchestration.retrieveKey(shardId)
    decryptedShard = crypto.decrypt(encryptedShard, internalKey)
    decryptedShards.append(decryptedShard)
  return concatenate(decryptedShards)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security through short-lived, unexportable keys.
*   Improved data availability and resilience to device failure.
*   Potential performance gains through parallel decryption and reconstruction.
*   Simplified key management for applications.
