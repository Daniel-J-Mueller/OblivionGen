## Query Shadowing & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Specification:** Implement a system for ‘query shadowing’ – creating lightweight, near-real-time replicas of incoming queries and executing them across a distributed cluster *before* full resource commitment. This allows for accurate prediction of resource needs (CPU, memory, I/O) and preemptive allocation, reducing latency and improving throughput.

**Components:**

*   **Shadow Query Engine (SQE):** A lightweight, distributed service receiving a copy of all incoming queries. The SQE utilizes a simplified execution model, sacrificing some precision for speed.
*   **Resource Prediction Module (RPM):** Analyzes SQE execution data (estimated execution time, memory footprint, I/O patterns) to predict resource requirements. Utilizes historical data and machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Preemptive Resource Allocator (PRA):**  Based on RPM predictions, PRA proactively reserves resources (CPU, memory, I/O bandwidth) across the cluster *before* the primary query engine begins execution. Prioritization is based on query importance (user, SLA, business impact).
*   **Primary Query Engine (PQE):** Receives the original query and executes it on the pre-allocated resources.
*   **Resource Adjustment Module (RAM):** Monitors actual resource consumption during PQE execution and adjusts allocations dynamically. Can reclaim unused resources or request additional resources as needed.

**Workflow:**

1.  PQE receives a query.
2.  PQE sends a copy of the query to SQE.
3.  SQE executes the query using a simplified execution model.
4.  SQE sends execution metrics to RPM.
5.  RPM analyzes metrics and predicts resource requirements.
6.  PRA reserves resources based on predictions.
7.  PQE executes on the pre-allocated resources.
8.  RAM monitors and adjusts resource allocation dynamically.

**Pseudocode (Resource Prediction Module):**

```
function predict_resources(query_metrics, historical_data):
    # Features: estimated execution time, memory usage, I/O operations
    features = extract_features(query_metrics)

    # Load trained ML model for resource prediction
    model = load_model("resource_prediction_model")

    # Predict resource requirements using the model
    predicted_resources = model.predict(features)

    # Adjust prediction based on historical data (e.g., cluster load)
    adjusted_resources = adjust_for_cluster_load(predicted_resources, historical_data)

    return adjusted_resources
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **QueryMetadata:** {query_id, query_text, arrival_timestamp, user_id, priority}
*   **ResourceRequest:** {query_id, cpu_cores, memory_gb, io_bandwidth_mbps}
*   **ResourceAllocation:** {query_id, allocated_cpu_cores, allocated_memory_gb, allocated_io_bandwidth_mbps, allocation_timestamp}

**Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   SQE and PRA are designed as distributed microservices, allowing for horizontal scaling.
*   Utilize a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft) for maintaining consistency of resource allocations.
*   Implement automatic failover mechanisms for critical components.
*   Data replication and redundancy for high availability.
