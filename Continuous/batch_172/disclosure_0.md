## Dynamic Event Propagation with Predictive Impact Scoring

**Concept:** Expand upon the relationship graph to not only *react* to events, but *predict* potential cascading impacts and proactively disseminate information *before* secondary failures occur. This moves beyond simple event notification to anticipatory risk mitigation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Enrichment:**

*   **Sources:** Integrate data beyond user/network element relationships. Incorporate:
    *   Real-time performance metrics (CPU load, network latency, disk I/O).
    *   Historical incident data (root cause analysis, resolution times).
    *   External threat intelligence feeds (vulnerability databases, known exploits).
    *   Scheduled maintenance windows.
*   **Data Modeling:** Extend the node types in the relationship graph:
    *   'Service Node': Represents a logical service spanning multiple network elements.
    *   'Dependency Node': Captures explicit dependencies between services and network elements (e.g., ‘Service A requires Database B’).
    *   ‘Vulnerability Node’: Links network elements to known vulnerabilities.

**2. Predictive Impact Analysis Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** Implement a modified Dijkstra's algorithm on the relationship graph, weighted by:
    *   Edge Weight: Operational dependency (as in the original patent).
    *   Node Vulnerability Score: Derived from ‘Vulnerability Nodes’.
    *   Real-time Performance Metrics: Incorporate current load and health.
    *   Historical Impact Data: Use incident history to estimate potential downtime/impact.
*   **Impact Scoring:** Assign each node a ‘Predicted Impact Score’ based on the algorithm's results. This score represents the probability and severity of impact if a failure occurs at the source node.
*   **Cascading Failure Prediction:**  The algorithm will identify potential cascading failures by tracing the path with the highest accumulated impact score.

**3. Proactive Notification System:**

*   **Tiered Alerting:** Define alert tiers based on the Predicted Impact Score:
    *   Tier 1: Critical – Immediate action required.
    *   Tier 2: High – Potential for significant disruption.
    *   Tier 3: Medium – Monitor closely.
*   **Preemptive Notification:**  For Tier 1 & 2 alerts, send notifications *before* the incident occurs to:
    *   Affected users: Provide a warning and potential workaround.
    *   Responsible teams: Trigger automated remediation scripts or manual intervention.
*   **Dynamic Notification Routing:** Route notifications based on:
    *   User role: Send technical details to engineers, executive summaries to managers.
    *   Preferred communication channel: Email, SMS, Slack, etc.
    *   Time of day/on-call schedule.

**4. Adaptive Learning & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Incident Validation:** After an incident occurs, validate the Predictive Impact Analysis's accuracy.
*   **Weight Adjustment:** Automatically adjust edge weights and vulnerability scores based on validation results.
*   **Algorithm Refinement:**  Use machine learning to optimize the Predictive Impact Analysis algorithm over time.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Impact Analysis):**

```
function predictImpact(sourceNode):
  impactScores = initialize(all nodes, 0)
  impactScores[sourceNode] = 100 // Initial impact

  priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue()
  priorityQueue.add(sourceNode, 100)

  while !priorityQueue.isEmpty():
    currentNode = priorityQueue.poll()

    for each neighbor in currentNode.neighbors:
      edgeWeight = getEdgeWeight(currentNode, neighbor)
      vulnerabilityScore = getVulnerabilityScore(neighbor)
      performanceFactor = getPerformanceFactor(neighbor)

      newImpactScore = impactScores[currentNode] * edgeWeight * vulnerabilityScore * performanceFactor

      if newImpactScore > impactScores[neighbor]:
        impactScores[neighbor] = newImpactScore
        priorityQueue.add(neighbor, newImpactScore)

  return impactScores
```

This expands the original patent's reactive system to a proactive, predictive one, reducing downtime and improving overall system resilience. The combination of dynamic impact scoring, predictive analysis, and pre-emptive notification offers a significant improvement over existing event management systems.
