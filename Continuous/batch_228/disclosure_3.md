## Data Blob ‘Shadowing’ with Predictive Versioning

**Concept:** Extend the versioning system to include ‘shadow’ data blobs pre-populated with likely future states. This allows for extremely fast read access and potential conflict avoidance in high-concurrency scenarios.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadow Blob Creation:**
    *   A background process monitors application access patterns to data blobs.
    *   Based on historical data (read/write frequency, modification types), the system predicts future states of frequently accessed blobs.
    *   These predicted states are materialized as ‘shadow’ blobs, stored alongside the primary data blob. Each shadow blob is tagged with a ‘confidence score’ representing the likelihood of its accuracy and a ‘valid-from’ timestamp.
    *   The prediction algorithm can leverage machine learning models trained on access logs.
2.  **Read Path Modification:**
    *   Upon a read request, the system first checks for a shadow blob matching the requested data blob identifier.
    *   If a shadow blob is found:
        *   Check if the shadow blob’s ‘valid-from’ timestamp is in the past.
        *   If valid, return the data from the shadow blob *without accessing the primary data blob*.
        *   If invalid, access the primary data blob.
3.  **Write Path Integration:**
    *   When a write request occurs:
        *   Attempt to write to the primary data blob.
        *   *Simultaneously*, asynchronously create a new shadow blob based on the updated data.
        *   If the write to the primary blob fails (conflict), the new shadow blob is still available for subsequent reads.
4.  **Version Reconciliation:**
    *   A background process periodically compares the contents of shadow blobs with the primary data blobs.
    *   If a discrepancy is found, the shadow blob is either updated or discarded.
5.  **Versioning Update:**
    *   Both primary and shadow blobs utilize the existing versioning system.
    *   A new version number is assigned to each blob upon modification.

**Pseudocode (Read Operation):**

```
function readDataBlob(blobId):
  shadowBlob = findShadowBlob(blobId)
  if shadowBlob != null:
    if shadowBlob.validFrom <= currentTime:
      return shadowBlob.data
    else:
      primaryData = readPrimaryDataBlob(blobId)
      return primaryData
  else:
    primaryData = readPrimaryDataBlob(blobId)
    return primaryData

function findShadowBlob(blobId):
  //Search for shadow blob based on blobId
  //Return the shadowBlob object if found, otherwise return null
```

**Infrastructure:**

*   Dedicated storage tier for shadow blobs (potentially faster storage media).
*   Background processes for shadow blob creation, validation, and deletion.
*   Monitoring system to track shadow blob hit rates and prediction accuracy.
*   Configuration options to control shadow blob creation frequency and storage limits.
