## Dynamic Access Revocation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system for augmenting targeted denial of access with continuous, real-time behavioral biometric analysis to refine and automate access control.

**Core Concept:** Rather than simply revoking access based on pre-defined user sessions or device identification, the system *continuously* assesses user behavior – typing cadence, mouse movements, scrolling speed, application usage patterns – to detect anomalies indicative of compromised accounts or unauthorized access *even if* the device and session appear legitimate. This creates a dynamic risk score influencing access permissions.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Sensor Suite:** A software component installed on user devices. Captures the following data streams:
    *   Typing Dynamics: Key press timings, durations, and patterns.
    *   Mouse/Touch Movement: Speed, acceleration, trajectory, and pressure (if available).
    *   Scrolling Behavior: Speed, direction, and frequency.
    *   Application Usage:  Applications opened and time spent within them.
    *   Network Activity: Timing and destination of network requests.

2.  **Risk Engine:**  A central server component responsible for processing behavioral data and generating a risk score.
    *   **Baseline Establishment:**  During initial user activity, the Risk Engine establishes a behavioral baseline for each user, device, and application combination.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Continuously compares real-time behavioral data against the established baseline. Utilizes statistical analysis (e.g., standard deviation, outlier detection) and machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to identify anomalous behavior.
    *   **Risk Score Calculation:** Assigns a risk score based on the severity and frequency of detected anomalies. The score should be weighted based on the criticality of the accessed resource.

3.  **Access Control Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the existing document management system.
    *   **Dynamic Access Adjustment:** Modifies access permissions based on the real-time risk score.  Examples:
        *   Low Risk:  Unrestricted access.
        *   Medium Risk:  Multi-factor authentication prompt. Reduced download/editing privileges.
        *   High Risk:  Complete access denial. Session termination.
    *   **Adaptive Authentication:** Triggers additional authentication steps (e.g., biometric scan, security questions) when the risk score exceeds a certain threshold.

**Pseudocode (Risk Engine):**

```
function CalculateRiskScore(user_id, device_id, application_id, behavior_data):
  baseline = GetBaseline(user_id, device_id, application_id)

  anomaly_score = 0
  for behavior_type in behavior_data:
    deviation = CalculateDeviation(behavior_data[behavior_type], baseline[behavior_type])
    anomaly_score += weight_factor[behavior_type] * deviation

  risk_score = anomaly_score + contextual_risk_factor[application_id] #Add document sensitivity
  return risk_score

function GetBaseline(user_id, device_id, application_id):
  #Retrieve historical behavioral data for the user, device, and application
  #Calculate statistical metrics (mean, standard deviation, etc.)
  return baseline_data

function CalculateDeviation(current_behavior, baseline_behavior):
  #Compare current behavior to baseline using appropriate statistical methods
  #Return a score indicating the degree of deviation
  return deviation_score
```

**Novelty:** Existing solutions focus on device/session-based access control or static risk profiles. This system offers a *dynamic* and *adaptive* approach based on continuous behavioral biometrics, significantly enhancing security and reducing false positives. The Risk Engine adapts to individual user behavior over time, improving accuracy and minimizing disruption.
