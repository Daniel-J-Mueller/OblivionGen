## Dynamic Sandbox Personality Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the sandbox system to incorporate "personality profiles" that dynamically adjust resource allocation and security parameters based on observed task behavior *within* the sandbox. This moves beyond static isolation to a responsive, self-tuning execution environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Personality Profile Data Structure:**
    *   `profile_id`: Unique identifier for the profile.
    *   `resource_limits`:  Dynamic caps on CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk I/O. Initialized with defaults, updated via observation.
    *   `security_posture`:  Levels of access control, network restrictions, and data isolation. Adjusted based on observed behavior.  Enum: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `paranoid`.
    *   `behavioral_signatures`:  A rolling window of observed system calls, API requests, and resource usage patterns.  Used for anomaly detection. Stored as a time-series data structure.
    *   `trust_score`: A numerical value representing the system’s confidence in the task’s benign nature. Initialized to a default value, updated during execution.
*   **Observation Engine:** Runs *within* each sandbox, monitoring task behavior.
    *   System Call Interception: Log all system calls made by the task.
    *   API Request Monitoring: Track all external API requests.
    *   Resource Usage Tracking: Monitor CPU, memory, network, and disk I/O.
    *   Anomaly Detection: Compare observed behavior to established baselines and known malicious patterns.  Utilize machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders) for outlier detection.
*   **Profile Adjustment Algorithm:** Executes periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds) or in response to detected anomalies.
    *   `If` anomaly detected `and` trust\_score < threshold:
        *   Lower resource limits.
        *   Increase security posture (e.g., stricter network restrictions).
        *   Decrease trust\_score.
    *   `Else If` resource usage consistently below thresholds `and` trust\_score > threshold:
        *   Increase resource limits.
        *   Relax security posture (e.g., allow more network access).
        *   Increase trust\_score.
    *   `Else`: Maintain current profile settings.
*   **Sandbox Request Protocol Enhancement:** The worker manager should accept a `desired_trust_level` parameter in the sandbox reservation request. The system will attempt to provision a sandbox that can *achieve* that trust level during execution, and adjust resource allocation to achieve it.
*   **Worker Manager Integration:**
    *   The worker manager must track the current profile settings for each sandbox it manages.
    *   The worker manager must enforce the resource limits and security posture specified by the profile.
    *   The worker manager must provide an API for querying and updating profile settings.
*   **Pseudocode - Profile Adjustment Algorithm:**

```
function adjust_profile(sandbox_id, observed_behavior, current_profile):
  anomaly_score = detect_anomaly(observed_behavior)
  trust_score = current_profile.trust_score + anomaly_score // Negative anomaly score decreases trust

  if trust_score < low_trust_threshold:
    current_profile.resource_limits = lower_resource_limits(current_profile.resource_limits)
    current_profile.security_posture = stricter_security_posture(current_profile.security_posture)
  elif trust_score > high_trust_threshold:
    current_profile.resource_limits = increase_resource_limits(current_profile.resource_limits)
    current_profile.security_posture = relaxed_security_posture(current_profile.security_posture)

  return current_profile
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced Security: Adaptive security measures respond to evolving threats.
*   Optimized Resource Allocation: Resources are dynamically allocated based on task needs.
*   Improved System Stability: Resource limits prevent rogue tasks from impacting other sandboxes.
*   Fine-grained Control: Offers greater control over sandbox execution.
