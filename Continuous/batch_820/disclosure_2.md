## Adaptive Contextual Embedding with Knowledge Graph Injection

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust word embeddings based on real-time knowledge graph lookups, enhancing named entity recognition, particularly for ambiguous or evolving entities.

**Core Concept:**  The existing patent focuses on concatenating different embedding lookups (case sensitive, insensitive, capitalized).  This design expands on that by *replacing* a portion of the embedding with information pulled from a knowledge graph *during inference*.  Instead of static embedding variations, we introduce a dynamic, context-aware component.

**System Architecture:**

1.  **Input:** Document text, pre-processed into tokens.
2.  **Character & Word Embedding Layer:**  As per the original patent – Character-level CNN, concatenated word embeddings (case sensitive, insensitive, capitalized).  This forms the ‘base embedding’ (BE).
3.  **Knowledge Graph Query Module:**
    *   For each token, construct a query to a knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia).  The query should leverage the token's text, surrounding context (n-grams), and potentially part-of-speech tags.
    *   The knowledge graph returns a ranked list of entities matching the query.  We select the top 'k' entities (e.g., k=3) as potential candidates.
4.  **Entity Embedding Layer:**
    *   Each candidate entity from the Knowledge Graph is mapped to a pre-trained entity embedding vector. This could be learned via techniques like TransE or similar knowledge graph embedding methods.
5.  **Attention Mechanism:**
    *   An attention mechanism calculates attention weights between the base embedding (BE) and each candidate entity embedding.  This effectively scores how well each entity embedding aligns with the token’s context. The attention weights sum to 1.
6.  **Dynamic Embedding Generation:**
    *   A weighted sum of the base embedding and the entity embeddings, using the attention weights. This generates a ‘dynamic embedding’ (DE).  
    *   `DE = α * BE + Σ(αᵢ * EntityEmbeddingᵢ)` where α is the base embedding weight and αᵢ is the weight for the ith entity embedding, and the sum is over the k candidate entities. The values of α and αᵢ are the output of the attention mechanism.
7.  **Tag Decoder:** The dynamic embedding is fed into the tag decoder (LSTM as in the patent) for named entity classification.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def generate_dynamic_embedding(token, base_embedding, knowledge_graph, k=3):
  """
  Generates a dynamic embedding for a token using knowledge graph information.

  Args:
    token: The input token (string).
    base_embedding: The pre-computed base embedding (vector).
    knowledge_graph: A knowledge graph object with query capabilities.
    k: The number of candidate entities to consider.

  Returns:
    A dynamic embedding vector.
  """

  candidate_entities = knowledge_graph.query(token, k=k)  # Returns a list of entity IDs
  entity_embeddings = [get_entity_embedding(entity_id) for entity_id in candidate_entities]

  attention_weights = calculate_attention_weights(base_embedding, entity_embeddings)
  
  dynamic_embedding = attention_weights[0] * base_embedding # attention weight for base embedding
  for i in range(len(entity_embeddings)):
      dynamic_embedding += attention_weights[i+1] * entity_embeddings[i]

  return dynamic_embedding
```

**Training Considerations:**

*   The attention mechanism and entity embeddings should be jointly trained with the rest of the NER system.
*   A loss function should be included to encourage the attention mechanism to select relevant entity embeddings.
*   Regularization techniques may be needed to prevent overfitting.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved accuracy for ambiguous or evolving entities.
*   Ability to leverage external knowledge sources.
*   Enhanced robustness to spelling errors and variations in entity names.
