## Virtual Network "Shadowing" and Adaptive Policy Replication

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic network configuration described in the patent by introducing a “shadowing” mechanism. This allows a virtual network to proactively mirror (or partially mirror) the routing and security policies of another virtual network, even across different clients or within the same client. This creates adaptive policy replication, enabling rapid response to security threats or performance bottlenecks.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Policy Shadowing Manager (PSM) – a module within the configurable network service.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Policy Template*: Defines the structure of routing and security policies (firewall rules, NAT configurations, QoS settings, etc.).
    *   *Shadowing Profile*: Specifies the source virtual network, the destination virtual network, and the level of policy mirroring (full, partial, customized).  Includes a weighting factor to prioritize certain policy aspects.
    *   *Policy Delta*: Tracks differences between the source and destination policies, facilitating incremental updates.

*   **Functionality:**
    1.  **Shadowing Profile Creation:** An administrator (or automated system) defines a Shadowing Profile, identifying the source and destination virtual networks and the desired mirroring level.
    2.  **Policy Extraction:** The PSM extracts the relevant policies from the source virtual network.
    3.  **Policy Transformation:** The PSM transforms the extracted policies to be compatible with the destination virtual network's configuration. This includes address translation, firewall rule adaptation, and QoS parameter mapping.
    4.  **Policy Application:** The PSM applies the transformed policies to the destination virtual network.
    5.  **Delta Tracking:** The PSM continuously monitors changes in the source virtual network's policies and generates Policy Deltas.
    6.  **Incremental Updates:** The PSM applies Policy Deltas to the destination virtual network, ensuring it remains synchronized with the source.
    7.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** PSM employs a feedback mechanism that analyzes network performance metrics (latency, throughput, security alerts) to dynamically adjust the mirroring level and/or the transformation rules.  This allows for optimization based on real-world conditions.

*   **Pseudocode (Delta Application):**

```
function applyPolicyDelta(delta, destinationNetwork):
    for rule in delta.rules:
        if rule.type == "firewall":
            destinationNetwork.addFirewallRule(rule.source, rule.destination, rule.port, rule.action)
        elif rule.type == "nat":
            destinationNetwork.addNATRule(rule.internalIP, rule.externalIP, rule.port)
        elif rule.type == "qos":
            destinationNetwork.addQoSSetting(rule.trafficType, rule.priority)
        else:
            log("Unknown rule type:", rule.type)
```

*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   The Policy Template should be extensible to support new policy types and parameters.
    *   The transformation rules should be configurable and customizable to support different mirroring scenarios.
    *   Security considerations are paramount. Access control and authentication mechanisms should be implemented to prevent unauthorized modification of policies.
    *   Integration with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems will provide valuable insights into network activity and potential threats.

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Rapid Disaster Recovery:** Replicate security policies to a backup virtual network in case of a primary network failure.
    *   **Staging Environments:** Create a replica of a production virtual network for testing and development purposes.
    *   **Threat Containment:** Isolate a compromised virtual network by replicating its security policies to a clean network.
    *   **Multi-Tenancy:** Dynamically enforce security policies based on tenant requirements.
