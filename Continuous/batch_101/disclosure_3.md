## Adaptive Data Tiering with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the non-local block data storage system to incorporate adaptive data tiering based on predicted access patterns, prefetching data to faster storage tiers *before* itâ€™s requested. This aims to reduce latency and improve application performance, particularly for read-intensive workloads.

**Specs:**

*   **Tiered Storage:** Introduce multiple storage tiers beyond the primary block storage:
    *   **Tier 0:** High-performance NVMe SSDs (local to compute node if available, otherwise fast remote SSD).
    *   **Tier 1:** Standard SSDs (remote).
    *   **Tier 2:** High-capacity HDDs (remote, archival).
*   **Access Pattern Analysis:** Implement a machine learning module (integrated with the Node Manager software module) to analyze I/O patterns of each application/virtual machine. This module will:
    *   Track read/write ratios.
    *   Identify frequently accessed blocks.
    *   Detect sequential vs. random access.
    *   Predict future block access based on historical data (time-series forecasting).
*   **Prefetching Engine:** A dedicated engine within the Node Manager module that:
    *   Receives predictions from the Access Pattern Analysis module.
    *   Proactively fetches predicted blocks from slower tiers to faster tiers.
    *   Employs a Least Recently Used (LRU) or similar caching algorithm to manage the prefetch cache.
    *   Supports configurable prefetch depth (number of blocks to prefetch) and prefetch window (timeframe for predictions).
*   **Intelligent Tiering Policy:** An automated policy engine that:
    *   Dynamically migrates blocks between tiers based on access frequency and prediction accuracy.
    *   Prioritizes hot data (frequently accessed) to faster tiers.
    *   De-prioritizes cold data (infrequently accessed) to slower tiers.
    *   Supports user-defined tiering policies.
*   **Data Deduplication & Compression:** Integrate data deduplication and compression techniques at each tier to reduce storage costs and bandwidth usage.
*   **API Extensions:** Provide APIs for applications to:
    *   Query the current tier of a block.
    *   Hint the system about expected access patterns.

**Pseudocode (Node Manager integration):**

```
// Within Node Manager's Data Access Request Handling:

function handleDataAccessRequest(blockId, operationType):
  tier = getBlockTier(blockId)

  if (tier == 0): // Data already in Tier 0 (fastest)
    // Serve request directly from Tier 0
    serveRequest(blockId, operationType)

  else: // Data in slower tier
    //Check if prefetch is in progress or if prefetching is enabled
    if(prefetchingEnabled && prefetchQueue.contains(blockId)) {
      // Block is being prefetched. Wait until completed.
      waitForPrefetchCompletion(blockId);
      serveRequest(blockId, operationType);
    } else {
      // Fetch from slower tier, prefetch for future access.
      fetchFromSlowerTier(blockId);
      prefetchBlock(blockId);
      serveRequest(blockId, operationType);
    }

function prefetchBlock(blockId):
  //Add blockId to the prefetch queue
  prefetchQueue.add(blockId);

  //Initiate background task to copy block from slower tiers to tier 0
  backgroundTask(blockId);

function backgroundTask(blockId):
  //copy block data from tier 1 or 2 to tier 0.
  copyBlock(blockId);
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency for read-intensive applications.
*   Improved overall system performance.
*   Optimized storage utilization.
*   Enhanced user experience.
*   Scalability and flexibility for diverse workloads.
