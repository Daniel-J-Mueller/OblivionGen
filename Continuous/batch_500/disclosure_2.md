## Adaptive Mesh Network Resilience via Predictive Disruption Mapping

**Concept:** Proactively identify and mitigate potential mesh network disruptions by predicting link failures based on environmental data and historical performance, dynamically adjusting routing and signal strength to maintain connectivity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensor Integration Module:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrate a suite of environmental sensors into mesh nodes:
    *   Microphone (acoustic event detection - construction, weather)
    *   Vibration Sensor (structural instability, movement)
    *   Temperature/Humidity Sensor (environmental factors)
    *   Light Sensor (obstruction detection, day/night cycle)
*   **Software:**
    *   Data Acquisition: Collect sensor readings at configurable intervals (1Hz - 60Hz).
    *   Data Preprocessing: Noise filtering, outlier removal, normalization.
    *   Data Fusion: Combine sensor data into a unified environmental profile.

**2. Predictive Disruption Engine:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – using historical mesh network performance data (link quality, throughput, latency) *combined* with the environmental profiles from the Sensor Integration Module.
*   **Feature Set:**
    *   Historical Link Quality (RSSI, SNR)
    *   Historical Throughput
    *   Historical Latency
    *   Environmental Data (Sensor Integration Module output)
    *   Time-of-Day/Seasonality
*   **Training Data:** Collect data over a prolonged period (at least 6 months) representing diverse environmental conditions and network traffic patterns.
*   **Prediction Output:** Generate a “Disruption Probability Map” for each node, predicting the likelihood of link failure to neighboring nodes within a specified time window (e.g., 5-30 minutes). This map should include a confidence score for each prediction.

**3. Dynamic Routing and Signal Adjustment Module:**

*   **Routing Protocol Adaptation:** Modify the existing Hybrid Wireless Mesh Path (HWMP) selection protocol. Instead of relying solely on immediate link quality, the protocol now incorporates the Disruption Probability Map.
*   **Cost Function Modification:** The routing cost calculation should include a “Disruption Penalty” based on the predicted probability of link failure. Higher disruption probability = higher cost.
*   **Signal Strength Adjustment:** Nodes can dynamically adjust their transmit power based on the Disruption Probability Map. If a link is predicted to become unreliable, the node increases its transmit power to compensate.
*   **Adaptive Frequency Selection:** Nodes can scan for and switch to less congested frequencies to improve link stability.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Within the HWMP routing process:

CalculateCost(NodeA, NodeB) {
  baseCost = calculateBaseCost(linkQuality);
  disruptionPenalty = DisruptionProbabilityMap[NodeA][NodeB] * penaltyFactor;
  totalCost = baseCost + disruptionPenalty;
  return totalCost;
}

// On a periodic basis:
AdjustSignalStrength() {
  For each neighbor node {
    If (DisruptionProbabilityMap[thisNode][neighborNode] > threshold) {
      IncreaseTransmitPower();
      ScanForLessCongestedFrequency();
    } else {
      DecreaseTransmitPower(); // Energy saving
    }
  }
}
```

**4. System Monitoring & Reporting:**

*   **Dashboard:** A central dashboard displays the Disruption Probability Maps, signal strength adjustments, and overall network health.
*   **Alerting:**  The system generates alerts when predicted disruptions exceed a critical threshold.
*   **Data Logging:** All sensor data, prediction results, and system adjustments are logged for analysis and model improvement.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond reactive routing by proactively identifying and mitigating potential disruptions *before* they occur. The integration of environmental sensors and predictive modeling is a key differentiator, enabling a more resilient and reliable mesh network. The constant readjustment to compensate for estimated problems should make it viable.
