## Dynamic Dataset Composition for Federated Learning

**Concept:** Extend the patent's training pipeline by incorporating a dynamic dataset composition layer *before* filtering. Instead of starting with a single, large dataset, utilize a system that actively requests and integrates data from diverse, edge-based sources in real-time, tailored to specific model performance needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Edge Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   API endpoints for edge devices (cameras, sensors, mobile phones, etc.) to register and submit data.
    *   Metadata tagging: Each data submission includes metadata detailing source device, environment conditions (lighting, weather), and data type.
    *   Secure data transfer protocols (TLS 1.3 or higher).
*   **Performance Monitoring Agent:**
    *   Continuous monitoring of the trained ML model's performance on a validation set.
    *   Identification of 'blind spots' - specific scenarios or data types where the model performs poorly.  (e.g., low accuracy for images captured in low light).
    *   Quantification of performance deficits (e.g., "Accuracy decreased by 15% on images with rain detected").
*   **Dynamic Dataset Composer:**
    *   Receives performance data from the Performance Monitoring Agent.
    *   Formulates data requests based on identified blind spots. (e.g., "Request 100 images of cars in heavy rain from edge devices in Seattle").
    *   Prioritizes requests based on the severity of the performance deficit and available edge device resources.
    *   Dynamically adjusts request parameters (location, time of day, data type) to optimize data acquisition.
*   **Data Integration Layer:**
    *   Receives data from edge devices.
    *   Applies automated quality control checks (blur detection, outlier removal).
    *   Normalizes data formats and resolutions.
    *   Adds data provenance information (source device, capture time, processing steps).
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  Trained ML model deployed and monitored.
    2.  Performance Monitoring Agent identifies performance deficit (e.g., poor object detection in foggy conditions).
    3.  Dynamic Dataset Composer formulates a data request: "Request 500 images of pedestrians in foggy conditions from edge devices in London and San Francisco."
    4.  Edge Data Acquisition Module distributes the request to registered edge devices.
    5.  Edge devices capture and submit relevant data.
    6.  Data Integration Layer validates and normalizes the data.
    7.  The newly acquired data is integrated into the training pipeline *before* the existing filtering stage.
    8.  The ML model is retrained with the augmented dataset.
    9.  Repeat from step 2.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Dataset Composer):**

```
function compose_dataset(performance_data):
  blind_spots = identify_blind_spots(performance_data)
  requests = []
  for blind_spot in blind_spots:
    request = generate_request(blind_spot)  # Generates request with location, data type, etc.
    requests.append(request)
  return requests
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved model robustness and accuracy in challenging conditions.
*   Reduced reliance on large, static datasets.
*   Adaptability to changing environments and use cases.
*   Enhanced privacy by leveraging decentralized data sources.
