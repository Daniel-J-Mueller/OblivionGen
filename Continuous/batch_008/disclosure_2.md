## Dynamic Privacy Zones with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Extend customizable intrusion zones to actively *predict* and mask areas likely to enter the field of view, offering proactive privacy and reduced false alarms. This moves beyond static zone definitions to dynamically adjust based on learned movement patterns and environmental factors.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **A/V Device:** Existing camera/microphone unit.
*   **Depth Sensor:** Short-range depth sensor (e.g., time-of-flight) integrated into or adjacent to the A/V device.  Range: 0.5m - 5m. Resolution: Minimum 320x240.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded system capable of running machine learning models.  Minimum: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72.  RAM: 4GB. Storage: 32GB.
*   **Optional: Environmental Sensors:** Light sensor, temperature sensor (for differentiating heat signatures).

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Zone Definition GUI:**  Expanded from the original patent’s GUI. Allows user-defined privacy/intrusion zones *and* a “Prediction Radius” around the zone.
*   **Depth Data Acquisition:** Driver and processing pipeline for the depth sensor.
*   **Object Tracking & Prediction:**  Machine learning model (e.g., Kalman filter, LSTM) to track moving objects within the field of view and predict their trajectories.  Training dataset: Crowd-sourced movement data.
*   **Occlusion Mapping:** Algorithm to determine the likelihood of an object occluding (blocking) a defined privacy zone based on predicted trajectory and depth data.
*   **Dynamic Masking:**  Software module to apply a visual or audio mask (blurring, silencing) to areas predicted to be occluded by an object entering the privacy zone. This masking occurs *before* data is transmitted or stored.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  System continuously learns from user interactions (adjustments to zones, confirmations/rejections of predictions) to refine prediction accuracy.

**3.  Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
DEFINE PrivacyZones[n] // User-defined zones
DEFINE PredictionRadius // User-defined radius around zones
LOAD TrainedPredictionModel // From cloud or local storage

// Main Loop
ACQUIRE Frame from Camera
ACQUIRE Depth Map from Depth Sensor
FOR EACH PrivacyZone in PrivacyZones:
    CALCULATE PredictionArea = PrivacyZone + PredictionRadius
    DETECT Moving Objects within PredictionArea
    FOR EACH Moving Object:
        PREDICT Trajectory of Moving Object
        CALCULATE Probability of Object entering PrivacyZone
        IF Probability > Threshold:
            CALCULATE OcclusionMap = Predicted Object Position + Object Size
            APPLY Mask to OcclusionMap within Frame (Blur/Silence)
END FOR
TRANSMIT/STORE Masked Frame
UPDATE PredictionModel based on User Feedback
```

**4.  User Interface Extensions:**

*   **Prediction Visualization:** Overlay on the Zone Definition GUI showing the predicted paths of commonly detected objects.
*   **Sensitivity Control:**  Slider to adjust the sensitivity of the prediction algorithm.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:**  Buttons to indicate whether the prediction was accurate (thumbs up/down).

**5.  Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Home Security:**  Dynamically mask areas where family members frequently move, reducing false alarms triggered by pets or children.
*   **Privacy in Open Workspaces:** Mask colleagues moving in the background during video conferences.
*   **Retail Analytics:**  Mask customers' faces while tracking their movement patterns.
