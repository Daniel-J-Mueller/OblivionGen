**Adaptive Semantic Highlighting & Contextual Expansion**

**Concept:** Extend the search functionality beyond simple term matching to understand *semantic relationships* within the text and dynamically highlight/expand content based on user interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Semantic Analysis Engine (SAE). Utilizes a pre-trained large language model (LLM) optimized for ebook content. LLM operates locally on the device (or optionally utilizes a privacy-preserving cloud connection).
*   **Highlighting Modes:**
    *   *Standard:* Existing term-based highlighting.
    *   *Semantic:* Highlights not just the search term, but semantically related concepts.  SAE identifies synonyms, hyponyms (more specific terms), hypernyms (more general terms), and related entities within a configurable radius (e.g., +/- 50 words) of the search term.  Highlight colors differentiate the original search term vs. related concepts.
    *   *Contextual:* Expands highlights to entire sentences or paragraphs containing the search term and its related concepts, providing greater context.
*   **Interaction Layer:**
    *   *Tap & Expand:* Tapping a highlighted term (original or related) triggers a popup displaying a brief definition/explanation sourced from a local/cloud knowledge base.
    *   *Swipe & Explore:* Swiping on a highlighted term initiates a dynamic exploration interface.  This interface displays:
        *   A ‘concept map’ visualizing semantic relationships between the search term and related concepts.
        *   Links to external resources (Wikipedia, dictionary entries, etc.).
        *   An option to perform a new search based on a related concept.
*   **Dynamic Indexing:**
    *   The SAE continuously analyzes ebook content in the background, building a ‘semantic index’ alongside the existing term index.  This semantic index stores relationships between concepts, enabling faster semantic searches.
    *   User interactions (taps, swipes) contribute to refining the semantic index, personalizing the experience.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All semantic analysis is performed locally by default.
    *   Optional cloud integration uses differential privacy techniques to protect user data.

**Pseudocode (SAE – Semantic Search):**

```
function semanticSearch(query, ebookText, semanticIndex):
  // 1. LLM-based concept extraction
  concepts = extractConcepts(query, ebookText) // returns list of related concepts & weights

  // 2. Retrieve relevant passages using both term & semantic indices
  termResults = searchTermIndex(query, ebookText)
  semanticResults = searchSemanticIndex(concepts, semanticIndex)

  // 3. Combine & rank results (weighted scoring based on relevance)
  combinedResults = mergeResults(termResults, semanticResults)

  // 4. Highlight results in ebookText
  highlightResults(combinedResults, ebookText)

  return ebookText // with highlighted semantic results
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Sufficient onboard processing power (multi-core CPU, dedicated NPU) to run LLM efficiently.
*   Increased memory capacity to store semantic index and LLM model.
*   Fast storage (SSD) for quick access to ebook content and index.
