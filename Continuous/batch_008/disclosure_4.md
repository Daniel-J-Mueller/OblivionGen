## Dynamic Credential Sharding & Temporal Access Graphs

**Concept:** Extend the temporary credential system by *sharding* credentials across multiple virtual devices, each authorizing access to only a *subset* of the requested resources.  Couple this with a time-based access graph that dynamically adjusts authorized resource access based on usage patterns and predicted needs.

**Specification:**

**1. Credential Shard Generation:**

*   Upon request for credentials, the service *does not* issue a single set. Instead, it analyzes the requested resources (identified by resource type, owner, sensitivity level, etc.).
*   The service divides the requested resources into ‘access groups’ based on commonalities (e.g., all database read operations, all compute instances in a specific availability zone, etc.).
*   For *each* access group, a unique, temporary credential shard is generated.  Each shard grants access only to resources within its defined group.
*   Each shard is cryptographically signed and includes metadata defining the access group and its validity period.

**2. Virtual Device Distribution & Management:**

*   A ‘Credential Manager’ component within the on-premises environment receives the shards.
*   The Credential Manager dynamically provisions virtual devices (lightweight VMs or containerized units) – one for each shard.
*   Each virtual device stores *only* its assigned credential shard.
*   The Credential Manager attaches these virtual devices to the requesting virtual computing system(s).
*   A ‘Shard Routing Table’ is maintained by the requesting system, mapping resource access requests to the appropriate virtual device containing the necessary shard.

**3. Temporal Access Graph & Dynamic Adjustment:**

*   A ‘Usage Monitoring Agent’ running within the on-premises environment tracks resource access patterns over time.
*   This data feeds into a ‘Temporal Access Graph’ – a directed graph representing resource dependencies and access frequencies.
*   A ‘Graph Analyzer’ component continuously analyzes the graph.
*   Based on analysis (predictive modeling of future resource needs), the Graph Analyzer dynamically adjusts the shard assignments.  This includes:
    *   **Pre-fetching Shards:** Proactively attaching virtual devices with shards for resources likely to be needed soon.
    *   **Revoking Shards:** Detaching virtual devices with shards for resources that are no longer being used or are unlikely to be needed in the near future.
    *   **Re-Sharding:** Splitting or merging access groups and re-distributing shards accordingly.

**4. Security Considerations:**

*   **Shard Rotation:**  Shards should be rotated frequently to minimize the impact of a compromised shard.
*   **Virtual Device Isolation:**  Virtual devices should be securely isolated from each other and from the host system.
*   **Auditing:**  All shard access and modification events should be audited.
*   **Differential Access:** The system should restrict the actions a shard can authorize.

**Pseudocode (Shard Routing):**

```
function accessResource(resourceID, operation):
  shardID = lookupShardID(resourceID) // Map resource to shard
  if shardID == NULL:
    logError("No shard found for resource")
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  virtualDevice = getVirtualDevice(shardID)
  if virtualDevice == NULL:
    logError("Virtual device not found")
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  credential = virtualDevice.getCredential()
  if credential == NULL:
    logError("Credential not found")
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  // Use credential to authorize access
  if authorize(credential, resourceID, operation):
    return ACCESS_GRANTED
  else:
    return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**Engineer Notes:** This system introduces complexity but offers significant security and performance benefits. The dynamic adjustment of shard assignments requires a robust and scalable graph analysis engine. The Credential Manager and Usage Monitoring Agent can be implemented as microservices for improved scalability and maintainability.
