## Adaptive Scene Reconstruction via Multi-View Temporal Fusion

**Concept:** Extend the viewport system to dynamically reconstruct a 3D scene representation *from* the streaming camera feeds, rather than simply displaying them *within* a pre-defined scene. This reconstructed scene serves as the primary display, with the original viewports acting as selectable "entry points" or designated viewpoints.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Synchronization:**

*   Each viewport camera stream is treated as a potential data source for 3D reconstruction.
*   A synchronization module ensures temporal alignment of frames across all active viewport streams.  This includes timestamping and potential frame interpolation to minimize drift.
*   Camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (position, orientation, field of view, distortion coefficients) are either pre-configured or dynamically estimated through visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques.

**2. 3D Reconstruction Engine:**

*   Employs a real-time 3D reconstruction algorithm (e.g., Structure from Motion, Multi-View Stereo) to generate a point cloud or mesh representation of the scene.  Prioritize algorithms that handle dynamic scenes effectively.
*   The reconstruction process is adaptive – the level of detail is adjusted based on viewport density and the amount of observed motion.  Areas with more viewports or significant movement receive higher resolution.
*   Output is a dynamic, editable 3D scene graph.

**3. Viewport Integration & Selection:**

*   The original viewport representations are retained as visual cues within the reconstructed 3D scene. They are rendered as semi-transparent bounding boxes or stylized "windows."
*   Selecting a viewport representation triggers a switch in the primary rendering viewpoint – the view from that camera is adopted as the current perspective.  Smooth transitions are implemented.
*   The system supports "blended views" – merging the perspective of multiple viewports in real-time, creating a combined, multi-perspective view. This could involve weighted averaging of pixel data.

**4. Dynamic Scene Editing & Annotation:**

*   Users can interact directly with the reconstructed 3D scene. This includes:
    *   Adding annotations (text, markers, 3D models).
    *   Measuring distances and areas.
    *   Creating virtual "cutaways" to reveal hidden structures.
*   All edits are persistent and synchronized across all connected clients (if applicable).

**5.  AI-Assisted Scene Understanding & Completion**

*   Implement an AI module that analyzes the reconstructed scene to identify objects, surfaces, and patterns.
*   Utilize this information to "fill in" gaps in the reconstruction, creating a more complete and coherent scene representation.  For example, if a wall is partially obscured, the AI could attempt to extrapolate its shape and texture.
*   The AI could also generate semantic labels for different parts of the scene (e.g., "table," "chair," "window").

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
For each frame:
    1. Acquire camera frames from all active viewports.
    2. Synchronize frames based on timestamps.
    3. Estimate camera poses (if not pre-configured).
    4. Perform 3D reconstruction using synchronized frames.
    5. Update the dynamic 3D scene graph.
    6. Render the 3D scene graph with viewport representations overlaid.
    7. Handle user interactions (viewport selection, scene editing, etc.).
    8. Apply AI-assisted scene understanding and completion.
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU for real-time rendering and reconstruction.
*   Sufficient RAM to store the 3D scene graph and textures.
*   Network connectivity for multi-client synchronization (optional).
