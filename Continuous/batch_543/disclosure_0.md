## Automated Dependency Graph Visualization & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the configuration change monitoring to automatically construct and visualize a dependency graph of the database instance, then use this graph to predict potential failure points *before* a restore operation is attempted, and proactively suggest remediation steps.

**Specs:**

1.  **Dependency Graph Builder Module:**
    *   Input: Configuration change logs (as detailed in the patent), database schema information, database access patterns (collected via lightweight tracing).
    *   Process: Analyze configuration changes, schema changes, and access patterns to identify dependencies between database components (tables, views, stored procedures, functions), infrastructure components (virtual machines, storage, network), and external services.
    *   Output: A dynamic, directed graph representation of dependencies.  Nodes represent components, edges represent dependencies.  Edge weight represents the strength of the dependency (e.g., frequency of access, criticality of the component).

2.  **Predictive Failure Analysis Engine:**
    *   Input: Dependency graph, restore request (including target point-in-time), historical failure data (from logs and monitoring systems).
    *   Process:
        *   Simulate the restore operation on the dependency graph.
        *   Identify potential failure points:
            *   Components with high out-degree (many dependencies) â€“ failure impacts many others.
            *   Components with critical dependencies on services unavailable at the restore point-in-time.
            *   Components with known failure patterns at the target point-in-time (based on historical data).
        *   Score each potential failure point based on its likelihood and impact.
    *   Output: Ranked list of potential failure points with associated scores and suggested remediation steps.

3.  **Remediation Suggestion Module:**
    *   Input: Potential failure points, remediation knowledge base (containing pre-defined remediation steps for common failures).
    *   Process:  Match potential failure points to pre-defined remediation steps.  For complex failures, generate a sequence of remediation steps.
    *   Output:  List of suggested remediation steps, including estimated time to completion and potential risks.

4.  **Visualization Dashboard:**
    *   Display the dependency graph with highlighted potential failure points.
    *   Show the suggested remediation steps.
    *   Allow users to drill down into specific components to view detailed information.
    *   Provide a timeline of configuration changes and their impact on the dependency graph.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Failure Analysis Engine):**

```
function analyze_restore(dependency_graph, restore_point, historical_data):
  potential_failures = []

  for node in dependency_graph.nodes:
    failure_score = 0

    # Check for high out-degree
    if dependency_graph.out_degree(node) > threshold:
      failure_score += weight_high_out_degree

    # Check for dependencies on unavailable services
    for dependency in dependency_graph.neighbors(node):
      if not service_available(dependency, restore_point):
        failure_score += weight_unavailable_service

    # Check for historical failure patterns
    if historical_data.contains_failure(node, restore_point):
      failure_score += weight_historical_failure

    if failure_score > threshold:
      potential_failures.append((node, failure_score))

  # Sort potential failures by score (descending)
  potential_failures.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  return potential_failures
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Dependency Graph:** Adjacency list or matrix. Nodes represent database components and infrastructure elements. Edges represent dependencies.
*   **Historical Data:** Time-series database or log file containing information about past failures.
