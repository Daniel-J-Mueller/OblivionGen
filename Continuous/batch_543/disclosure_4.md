## Dynamic Event-Based Product Bundling & Anticipatory Shipping

**Concept:** Leverage tag/hashtag associations *not* just for search, but to proactively bundle products anticipating user needs based on upcoming events *and* initiate shipping *before* the user explicitly orders.

**Specs:**

**1. Event Calendar Integration:**

*   **Data Source:** Integrate with public and private event calendars (Google Calendar, Facebook Events, user-defined events).
*   **Event Parsing:** AI-driven parsing of event titles and descriptions to identify event *type* (birthday, anniversary, graduation, baby shower, etc.) and associated details (date, recipient age/gender, estimated guest count).
*   **Event Trigger:**  System monitors event dates within a configurable timeframe (e.g., 2 weeks prior).

**2. Dynamic Bundle Creation:**

*   **Bundle Profiles:** Pre-defined bundle profiles for each event type (e.g., “8th Birthday - Boy”, “10th Anniversary - Couple”, “New Baby - Girl”).  These profiles contain a weighted list of potential products.
*   **Tag Association Weighting:**  Utilize existing tag data. Products associated with frequently used event-specific tags (e.g., #8thbirthday, #firsttimedad) receive higher weight in bundle creation.
*   **Personalization Layer:**  Integrate user purchase history, browsing data, and social media information (with consent) to refine bundle composition.  For example, if a user frequently purchases LEGO sets, prioritize LEGO products in a birthday bundle.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:**  Calculate bundle price based on individual item prices and offer a small discount for purchasing as a bundle.

**3. Anticipatory Shipping & Fulfillment:**

*   **Confidence Threshold:**  System calculates a “Confidence Score” based on event proximity, user behavior (e.g., viewing related products), and bundle composition.  Shipping is initiated *only* if the Confidence Score exceeds a pre-defined threshold.
*   **Staging & Regionalization:**  Inventory is pre-staged at fulfillment centers geographically closest to the user.
*   **“On the Way” Notification:** User receives a notification that their anticipated bundle is “On the Way” with an option to cancel or modify the order *before* it’s delivered.  If no action is taken, the order is finalized and charged.
*   **Cancellation/Modification Window:** A 24-48 hour window for users to adjust or cancel pre-shipped orders.

**4.  AI-Driven Bundle Optimization:**

*   **A/B Testing:** Continuously A/B test different bundle compositions based on user acceptance rates and feedback.
*   **Demand Forecasting:**  Predict demand for specific products based on upcoming events and adjust inventory levels accordingly.
*   **Tag Suggestion Engine:**  AI-powered engine suggesting relevant tags to users when they are browsing products, further refining tag data and improving bundle accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Creation):**

```
function create_bundle(event_data, user_data):
  event_type = event_data.type
  bundle_profile = get_bundle_profile(event_type)
  weighted_product_list = bundle_profile.products

  // Apply user personalization
  for product in weighted_product_list:
    product.weight += calculate_user_affinity(user_data, product)

  // Sort products by weight
  sorted_products = sort_by_weight(weighted_product_list)

  // Select top N products for the bundle (N configurable)
  selected_products = sorted_products[:N]

  return selected_products
```
