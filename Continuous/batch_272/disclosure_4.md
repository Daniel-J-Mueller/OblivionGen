## Dynamic Network ‘Health’ Visualization & Predictive Capacity Allocation

**Concept:** Extend path availability scoring beyond simple ‘up/down’ status to represent network ‘health’ as a multi-dimensional, real-time visualization, and proactively adjust resource allocation based on predicted health degradation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Health Metric Definition:**

*   **Core Metrics:** Latency, Jitter, Packet Loss, Bandwidth Utilization (existing in patent).
*   **Derived Metrics:**
    *   *Congestion Score:*  Calculated using a weighted average of bandwidth utilization and packet loss. Higher score = higher congestion.
    *   *Stability Score:*  Measure of variance in latency and jitter over a defined period. Lower score = more stable.
    *   *Capacity Margin:*  Remaining available bandwidth on a path, expressed as a percentage.
    *   *Anomaly Detection:* Employ statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, moving averages) to identify unusual patterns in core and derived metrics.

**2. Visualization Layer:**

*   **Network Topology Map:**  Display network nodes and paths.
*   **Path Coloring/Shading:**  Paths colored based on composite ‘Health Score’ (see Calculation section).  Green = healthy, Yellow = warning, Red = critical.  Intensity reflects severity.
*   **Data Overlays:**  Ability to toggle overlays displaying specific metric values (latency, jitter, bandwidth) on paths.
*   **Time-Series Graphs:**  Display historical data for selected paths and metrics.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Visualize predicted health degradation (e.g. shading path darker over time to suggest capacity issues) using trending and historical data.

**3. Predictive Capacity Allocation Engine:**

*   **Historical Data Storage:**  Store historical data for all core and derived metrics.
*   **Trending Analysis:**  Identify long-term trends in metric values.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   Employ time series forecasting models (e.g. ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to predict future metric values.
    *   Model capacity degradation based on historical data and predicted traffic patterns.
*   **Automated Resource Adjustment:**
    *   Dynamically adjust bandwidth allocation to paths based on predicted health degradation.
    *   Proactively reroute traffic to alternative paths with higher predicted health.
    *   Trigger alerts when predicted health falls below a defined threshold.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Collection Agents:**  Deployed on network devices to collect connectivity, performance, and topology data.
*   **Centralized Processing Server:**  Receives data from agents, calculates health metrics, runs predictive models, and controls resource allocation.
*   **Visualization Server:**  Generates the network topology map and data overlays.
*   **API Integration:**  Allow integration with existing network management systems and orchestration platforms.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Capacity Adjustment):**

```
// For each path in network:
    // Get historical data for: bandwidth utilization, latency, packet loss
    historicalData = getHistoricalData(path)

    // Predict future bandwidth utilization
    predictedBandwidth = predictBandwidth(historicalData)

    // Calculate capacity margin
    capacityMargin = calculateCapacityMargin(predictedBandwidth, path.bandwidth)

    // If capacity margin falls below threshold:
        // Identify alternative paths
        alternativePaths = findAlternativePaths(path)

        // Evaluate health of alternative paths
        alternativePathHealth = evaluatePathHealth(alternativePaths)

        // Reroute traffic to the healthiest alternative path
        rerouteTraffic(path, alternativePathHealth.healthiestPath)

        // Log event
        logEvent("Traffic rerouted from " + path + " to " + alternativePathHealth.healthiestPath)
```

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond simple path availability to a more nuanced representation of network ‘health’. Predictive capacity allocation is a proactive approach to prevent performance degradation before it occurs, leveraging historical data and machine learning to optimize resource utilization. The dynamic, visual interface provides a real-time overview of network health, enabling operators to quickly identify and address potential issues.
