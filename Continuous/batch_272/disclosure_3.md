## Dynamic Utterance Decomposition & Predictive Action Sequencing

**Concept:** Expand upon the conditional command processing to *proactively* anticipate user needs by decomposing complex utterances into micro-actions, initiating those actions *before* full utterance completion, and dynamically adjusting the action sequence based on contextual feedback.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** ‘Preemptive Executor’. This module runs alongside the existing NLU pipeline.
*   **Decomposition Engine:** Leverages a hierarchical state machine (HSM) trained on utterance patterns. The HSM maps utterance fragments (detected in real-time from ASR output) to potential micro-actions. Actions are prioritized based on statistical likelihood and contextual relevance (user history, environment sensors).
*   **Action Buffer:** A queue holding predicted micro-actions. The buffer has a configurable ‘time-to-live’ for each action – if the remainder of the utterance contradicts the prediction, the action is discarded.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Integrates multiple feedback channels:
    *   **ASR Confidence:** High ASR confidence for subsequent words strengthens action commitment. Low confidence triggers reconsideration.
    *   **Sensor Data:**  Environmental sensors (cameras, microphones, proximity sensors) provide real-time context. Example: User says “turn on…”, camera detects user looking at a lamp – increase the probability of “turn on the lamp” being the correct action.
    *   **User Gaze Tracking:**  If available, track user gaze to further refine action prediction.
    *   **Implicit Confirmation:** Monitor for micro-actions being implicitly confirmed by user behavior (e.g., user physically moves towards the predicted target).
*   **Dynamic Sequence Adjustment:**  The system dynamically re-sequences or cancels actions in the buffer based on incoming feedback.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns from user interactions to improve the accuracy of utterance decomposition and action prediction.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Existing processor, microphone, optional camera and/or gaze tracking hardware.
*   **Software Requirements:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, ASR library (e.g., Whisper), HSM implementation.

**Pseudocode – Preemptive Executor:**

```python
# Initialize HSM and action buffer
HSM = HierarchicalStateMachine()
action_buffer = []

def process_utterance_fragment(fragment, confidence):
    predicted_actions = HSM.get_predicted_actions(fragment)
    for action in predicted_actions:
        action_buffer.append(action)
        # Adjust action priority based on confidence and context
        action.priority = confidence * context_relevance

def process_sensor_data(sensor_data):
    # Update context relevance scores for actions in the buffer
    for action in action_buffer:
        action.context_relevance = calculate_context_relevance(action, sensor_data)

def check_and_execute_actions():
    # Sort actions by priority
    action_buffer.sort(key=lambda x: x.priority, reverse=True)
    # Execute highest priority action (if priority exceeds threshold)
    if action_buffer and action_buffer[0].priority > threshold:
        execute_action(action_buffer[0])
        action_buffer.pop(0)
    # Time-to-live check. Remove stale actions
    action_buffer = [action for action in action_buffer if action.time_to_live > 0]
    action.time_to_live -=1
```

**Use Case:**  User says “order me a pizza…”.  The system, based on past orders, location, and time of day, *immediately* starts pre-filling the pizza order form (size, toppings, delivery address) *before* the user finishes the utterance.  If the user then says “…with pepperoni and mushrooms”, the system confirms those toppings. If the user says “…actually, make it pasta”, the pre-filled pizza order is discarded, and the system switches to a pasta ordering flow.
