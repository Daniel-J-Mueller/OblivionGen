**Adaptive Transaction Prioritization via Dynamic Decode Window Resizing**

**Specification:**

**1. Core Concept:**  Extend the address decoder’s functionality to dynamically resize decode windows *during* transaction processing, enabling transaction prioritization based on real-time system conditions.  Instead of static window assignments, windows can expand or contract to favor critical transactions.

**2. System Components:**

*   **Adaptive Decode Window Controller (ADWC):** A new hardware module integrated with the existing address decoder.  The ADWC monitors system performance metrics (e.g., latency, queue depth at target nodes, resource utilization) in real-time.
*   **Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU):**  Dedicated hardware or firmware to collect system performance data.  Interfaces with the ADWC.
*   **Window Resize Table (WRT):** A memory-mapped table within the ADWC storing resize factors for each decode window.  Resize factors are applied to the window’s address range.
*   **Decode Window Logic (DWL):** Modified decode window comparison logic within the address decoder.  Applies the resize factor to the window boundaries *before* comparing the transaction address.
*   **Priority Signal Input:**  An input line allowing external sources (e.g., a scheduler) to signal the importance of a transaction. This signal triggers a review of window sizing.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Baseline Configuration:** The system begins with a pre-defined static decode window configuration.  These windows are stored in the WRT with an initial resize factor of 1.0 (no change).
2.  **Performance Monitoring:** The PMU continuously collects system performance metrics.
3.  **ADWC Evaluation:** The ADWC periodically (or event-driven, based on priority signals) analyzes performance data. It identifies congested or critical target nodes.
4.  **Window Resizing:** Based on the analysis, the ADWC adjusts the resize factors in the WRT.  
    *   **Expanding a Window:** If a target node is critical (low latency required), the ADWC increases the corresponding resize factor.  This expands the window’s address range, giving transactions destined for that node a higher probability of matching and being routed quickly.
    *   **Contracting a Window:** If a target node is congested, the ADWC decreases the resize factor, shrinking the window and reducing the likelihood of routing additional transactions to that node.
5.  **Dynamic Decode:** As transactions arrive, the DWL applies the current resize factor to each window’s boundaries *before* performing the address comparison.  This effectively modifies the active address range of each window on the fly.
6.  **Priority Override:** A high-priority signal can override the dynamic resizing.  This temporarily expands the corresponding window to ensure immediate routing.

**4. Pseudocode (DWL Modification):**

```
function compareAddress(transactionAddress, windowBaseAddress, windowSize, resizeFactor):
  effectiveWindowSize = windowSize * resizeFactor
  effectiveWindowEndAddress = windowBaseAddress + effectiveWindowSize

  if (transactionAddress >= windowBaseAddress and transactionAddress < effectiveWindowEndAddress):
    return true // Address matches the window
  else:
    return false // Address does not match
```

**5.  AXI Integration:**  Leverage AXI USER bits to signal priority and potentially fine-tune resize factors.  Specific USER bit patterns could indicate transaction criticality or specific window adjustments.

**6.  Implementation Notes:**

*   The resize factor can be a floating-point value or a fixed-point representation to balance precision and hardware complexity.
*   A safety mechanism should be in place to prevent resize factors from becoming negative or exceeding a maximum value.
*   Consider a hysteresis mechanism to avoid rapid window resizing oscillations.
*   The ADWC and PMU can share a common clock domain, or use appropriate synchronization mechanisms if operating in different domains.
