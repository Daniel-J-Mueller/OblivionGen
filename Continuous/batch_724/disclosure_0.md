## Adaptive Camouflage Motion Sensor

**Concept:** A motion sensor integrated with a dynamically changing surface capable of visual camouflage, blending with the immediate surroundings to become nearly invisible when inactive. Activation is indicated by subtle, patterned illumination *through* the camouflaged surface, rather than traditional LEDs.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Core:** Standard PIR or microwave motion detection module. Dimensions: 5cm x 5cm x 2cm.
*   **Surface Material:** Electrochromic polymer layer, approximately 0.5mm thick.  Capable of displaying a broad spectrum of colors and patterns.  Must be durable and weather-resistant (IP65 rating minimum).
*   **Camera System:** Miniature, low-power CMOS camera (resolution 640x480) embedded *within* the sensor housing, pointing outwards.  Field of view: 90 degrees. Data rate: 5fps.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Low-power ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller.  
    *   **Algorithm:** Real-time image processing to analyze surrounding environment via camera feed.  The algorithm will identify dominant colors and textures, then instruct the electrochromic layer to mimic them.  Focus is on *averaging* surrounding patterns, not exact replication. This reduces processing load and creates a 'blended' camouflage.
    *   **Activation Indicator:** When motion is detected, the system doesnâ€™t illuminate external LEDs. Instead, a low-intensity, geometric pattern (e.g., a radial gradient, a spiraling line) will *illuminate through* the camouflaged surface.  Color of the pattern is adjustable. Intensity is low enough to avoid creating a bright visible signal at a distance.
*   **Power:**  Battery powered (lithium-ion, 3.7V, 2000mAh) or wired connection (5V DC).
*   **Housing:** Ruggedized ABS plastic. Dimensions: 8cm x 8cm x 4cm. Mountable via screws or adhesive.
*   **Communication:** Optional Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module for configuration and data logging.

**Pseudocode (Camouflage Algorithm):**

```
LOOP
    CAPTURE_IMAGE
    EXTRACT_DOMINANT_COLORS(IMAGE, num_colors=5)  // Returns list of RGB values
    EXTRACT_TEXTURE_FEATURES(IMAGE) //Returns metrics of 'busy-ness', gradient, etc.
    CALCULATE_AVERAGE_COLOR(dominant_colors)  //Returns RGB value
    ADJUST_ELECTROCHROMIC_LAYER(average_color, texture_features) //Sets surface color & pattern
    DELAY(100ms)
END LOOP

// Motion Detection Interrupt:
IF motion_detected == TRUE THEN
    ILLUMINATE_PATTERN(pattern_type="radial", color="blue", intensity=0.2)
    DELAY(2 seconds)
    TURN_OFF_PATTERN()
END IF
```

**Novelty:** Existing motion sensors rely on visible indicators. This design prioritizes concealment and subtle alerts, leveraging advanced materials and image processing for a unique user experience. The average color and pattern technique lowers processing load and maintains a natural visual effect.
