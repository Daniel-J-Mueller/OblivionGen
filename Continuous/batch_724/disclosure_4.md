**Dynamic Scene Emphasis via Biofeedback Integration**

**Concept:** Expand the closed captioning/scene ranking system to *dynamically* adjust emphasis based on real-time biometric data from the viewer. This creates a personalized viewing experience that highlights moments most impactful *to that individual*.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Input:** Integrate with wearable sensors (smartwatches, headbands, etc.) to capture physiological data: heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA - skin conductance), and potentially EEG (brainwave activity).  Data transmission via Bluetooth/WiFi.

2.  **Real-time Data Processing:** Develop a module that filters and analyzes incoming biometric data. Establish baseline levels for each viewer.  Focus on detecting spikes or significant deviations from the baseline.  Consider a rolling average to smooth out noise.

3.  **Scene Segmentation & Analysis:** Leverage existing scene change detection (from claim 5) and closed captioning analysis (claims 1-4). Extract keywords, sentiment (claim 9), and dialog presence.

4.  **Impact Score Calculation:**  Combine biometric data with scene analysis.  Develop a weighted scoring system:

    `Impact Score = (Biometric Weight * Biometric Response) + (Caption Weight * Caption Significance)`

    *   `Biometric Response`:  Normalized value representing the magnitude of biometric deviation.
    *   `Caption Significance`:  Score derived from keyword frequency, sentiment intensity, and dialog presence.

5.  **Dynamic Emphasis Mechanisms:** Based on the Impact Score, dynamically alter the viewing experience:

    *   **Visual Enhancement:** Subtle color grading shifts, brightness adjustments, or object highlighting within the scene.
    *   **Audio Modulation:**  Volume adjustments, EQ tweaks focusing on specific frequencies (e.g., emphasize voices during high-impact dialog), or subtle sound effects.
    *   **Subtitle Styling:**  Increase font size, change color, add background highlighting to subtitles during high-impact moments.
    *   **Haptic Feedback (optional):** If paired with wearable devices that support haptic feedback, provide subtle vibrations during key moments.
    *   **Automated Highlight Reel Generation:** After viewing, automatically generate a personalized highlight reel based on scenes with the highest cumulative Impact Scores.

6.  **Personalized Calibration:** Implement a machine learning component that calibrates the weighting factors (Biometric Weight, Caption Weight) based on individual viewer preferences and viewing history.  Allow viewers to provide feedback (“Was this moment more/less impactful than the system indicated?”) to refine the model.

**Pseudocode (Impact Score Calculation):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateImpactScore(scene, biometricData, viewerProfile)
  biometricResponse = Normalize(biometricData) // Scale biometric data 0-1
  captionSignificance = CalculateCaptionSignificance(scene, viewerProfile) //Uses keywords, sentiment etc.
  biometricWeight = GetWeight(viewerProfile, "biometric")
  captionWeight = GetWeight(viewerProfile, "caption")

  impactScore = (biometricWeight * biometricResponse) + (captionWeight * captionSignificance)

  RETURN impactScore
END FUNCTION
```

**Further Exploration:**

*   Investigate the use of more advanced biometric sensors (fMRI, eye tracking) for even more precise impact assessment.
*   Develop algorithms to predict emotional responses based on content characteristics and viewer history.
*   Explore the potential for adaptive storytelling, where the narrative subtly shifts based on viewer engagement.
