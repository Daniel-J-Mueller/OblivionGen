## Adaptive Partitioning Based on Predictive Load

**Specification:** Implement a system to predict future load on time-series data partitions, proactively adjusting partition boundaries *before* resource saturation occurs. This expands on the reactive partitioning described in the source material by introducing a predictive element.

**Components:**

1.  **Historical Load Profiler:** A module that analyzes historical time-series query patterns and data ingestion rates for each partition. Stores data in a time-series database optimized for rapid aggregation and querying.
2.  **Load Forecaster:** Uses machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) trained on the Historical Load Profiler's data to predict future query load and ingestion rates for each partition over a configurable prediction horizon (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day).  Multiple models can be maintained per partition and weighted based on recent performance.
3.  **Capacity Planner:**  Defines resource capacity limits (CPU, memory, I/O) for each partition based on hardware configurations and desired service level objectives (SLOs).
4.  **Partition Adjustment Engine:**  Based on predictions from the Load Forecaster and capacity limits defined by the Capacity Planner, this engine determines if a partition split or merge is required. It calculates optimal split points to distribute load evenly and minimize data movement.  It also considers a 'cooldown' period to avoid thrashing (repeated splits/merges).
5.  **Split/Merge Coordinator:** Orchestrates the physical split or merge of partitions, coordinating with the storage layer to ensure data consistency and minimal downtime. Uses a two-phase commit protocol.

**Pseudocode (Partition Adjustment Engine):**

```
function adjust_partitions(partition_list, prediction_horizon):
  for partition in partition_list:
    predicted_load = LoadForecaster.predict(partition, prediction_horizon)
    capacity = CapacityPlanner.get_capacity(partition)
    if predicted_load > capacity * threshold:  //Threshold to account for variance
      split_point = calculate_optimal_split_point(partition, predicted_load)
      if cooldown_expired(partition):
        SplitMergeCoordinator.schedule_split(partition, split_point)
        set_cooldown(partition)
    elif predicted_load < capacity * low_threshold: //Low threshold for merges
        if cooldown_expired(partition):
            merge_candidates = find_merge_candidates(partition)
            if merge_candidates:
                SplitMergeCoordinator.schedule_merge(partition, merge_candidates)
                set_cooldown(partition)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PartitionMetadata`:  Stores historical load data, predicted load, capacity limits, cooldown status, and split/merge schedules.
*   `PredictionModel`: Represents a trained time-series forecasting model.

**Implementation Details:**

*   The system should support dynamic adjustment of the prediction horizon and thresholds.
*   A robust error handling mechanism should be implemented to handle failed splits or merges.
*   Monitoring and alerting should be integrated to track the performance of the adaptive partitioning system.
*   Consider using a 'shadow' partitioning system for testing changes before applying them to production.
*   The system should be designed to scale horizontally to handle large volumes of time-series data.
