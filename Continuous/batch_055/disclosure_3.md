## Secure Enclave Assisted Dynamic Root of Trust Provisioning

**Concept:** Leverage the inter-processor communication queue (IPQ) described in the patent not just for cryptographic operations, but to dynamically establish and rotate a Root of Trust (RoT) within a secure enclave, enhancing security against compromised firmware or physical attacks.  This expands the secure compute layer's capabilities beyond simple key generation, toward a more robust and adaptable security posture.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Real-Time Processor (RTP): Primary processor managing I/O and initiating secure operations.  Must support secure boot and attestation.
    *   Additional Processor (AP):  Secure enclave processor (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) with dedicated memory and cryptographic capabilities.
    *   Inter-Processor Communication Queue (IPQ):  High-speed, low-latency queue for secure message passing. Bi-directional communication is critical.
    *   Tamper-Resistant Hardware Random Number Generator (TRNG): Essential for RoT generation.
*   **Software:**
    *   RTP Firmware: Includes a secure bootloader, attestation module, and IPQ client.
    *   AP Firmware: Contains a secure enclave runtime, RoT manager, and IPQ server.
    *   RoT Manager:  Software within the secure enclave responsible for RoT generation, storage, rotation, and attestation.
*   **Protocol:**

    1.  **Initial Boot & RoT Provisioning:**
        *   RTP performs secure boot and attestation of the AP.
        *   RTP enqueues a "Generate RoT" request onto the IPQ, including seed material (from TRNG or external source).
        *   AP dequeues the request and generates a new RoT using the seed and internal algorithms.
        *   AP enqueues a "RoT Available" message onto the IPQ, including a digitally signed RoT public key.
        *   RTP verifies the signature and stores the RoT public key securely.
    2.  **Dynamic RoT Rotation:**
        *   RTP periodically (or upon security event detection) enqueues a "Rotate RoT" request onto the IPQ.
        *   AP dequeues the request, generates a new RoT, and securely transitions to the new RoT *without system downtime*.  The transition leverages internal enclave attestation mechanisms.
        *   AP enqueues a "RoT Rotated" message onto the IPQ, including a digitally signed RoT public key for the new RoT.
        *   RTP verifies the signature and updates its stored RoT public key.
    3.  **Attestation & Key Derivation:**
        *   When establishing a secure connection (as described in the patent), the RTP requests attestation from the AP via the IPQ.
        *   The AP signs a challenge from the RTP using the *current* RoT and returns the signature via the IPQ.
        *   RTP verifies the signature, confirming the integrity of the AP and the current RoT.
        *   A session key is derived using a Key Derivation Function (KDF) based on the RoT, the session challenge, and other relevant parameters.

**Pseudocode (RTP - Enqueue RoT Rotation Request):**

```
function enqueue_rot_rotation_request() {
  request = create_request(REQUEST_TYPE_ROTATE_ROT, null); // No data needed for rotation
  send_ipq_message(request);
  log("Sent RoT rotation request to AP");
}
```

**Pseudocode (AP - Handle RoT Rotation Request):**

```
function handle_rotate_rot_request() {
  new_rot = generate_new_root_of_trust();
  log("Generated new RoT");
  // Securely transition to new RoT (internal enclave operation)
  transition_to_new_rot(new_rot);
  signed_rot_public_key = sign_public_key(new_rot.public_key, current_rot);
  response = create_response(RESPONSE_TYPE_ROT_ROTATED, signed_rot_public_key);
  send_ipq_message(response);
  log("Sent RoT rotated response to RTP");
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply offloading cryptographic *operations*. It establishes a dynamic security layer where the foundation of trust (RoT) is actively managed and rotated within a secure enclave, increasing resilience against attacks that target firmware or physical compromise. The IPQ becomes the control plane for this dynamic RoT management. It also supports a level of separation of duties and attack surface reduction.
