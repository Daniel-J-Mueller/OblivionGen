## Adaptive Frequency Masking for Personalized Assistant Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the selective encryption based on frequency ranges described in claim 3 by dynamically adjusting the masking *based on real-time emotional analysis of the user's voice*. The goal is to prioritize transmission of frequencies crucial for conveying emotional state while further obscuring non-essential data, enhancing both privacy and assistant responsiveness.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Device (Voice Capture/Transmission)
    *   Emotional Analysis Module (EAM) - Local or Cloud-Based
    *   Frequency Partitioning & Encryption Engine (FPEE)
    *   Assistant Processing Systems (APS) - Multiple potential targets.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  User utters a command. Audio data is captured by the device.
    2.  A portion of the audio data is *immediately* sent to the EAM for real-time emotional state analysis (e.g., detecting anger, joy, sadness, neutrality).  This analysis focuses on prosodic features (pitch, tone, rhythm) rather than semantic content.
    3.  The EAM outputs an "Emotional Significance Map" (ESM) – a weighted distribution indicating the relative importance of different frequency ranges for conveying emotional state.  Example: `ESM = {0-200Hz: 0.8, 200-800Hz: 0.5, 800-2kHz: 0.2, 2kHz+: 0.1}`.  Values range from 0.0 to 1.0.
    4.  The FPEE partitions the audio data into multiple frequency bands (e.g., 0-200Hz, 200-800Hz, 800-2kHz, 2kHz+).
    5.  The FPEE generates multiple encryption keys (K1, K2, K3, K4…), one for each frequency band.  The keys are initially identical.
    6.  The FPEE *modifies* the encryption keys based on the ESM. Keys corresponding to higher-significance frequency bands (as indicated by the ESM) receive *increased* complexity (e.g., longer key length, stronger algorithm).  Keys for lower-significance bands receive *reduced* complexity.
    7.  Each frequency band is encrypted using its corresponding modified key.
    8.  The encrypted frequency bands are combined into a single encrypted audio stream.
    9.  The encrypted audio stream is sent to the target assistant(s).
    10. Only the encryption key(s) for the frequencies prioritized by the ESM are sent *initially* to the selected assistant.  Remaining keys are withheld or sent with a delay, giving priority to emotional nuance.
*   **Key Management:**
    *   Initial key generation: Device generates a base key.
    *   Key modification: ESM weights are used to modulate key complexity.
    *   Selective transmission: Keys corresponding to prioritized frequencies are sent first.
*   **Adaptive Behavior:**
    *   If the assistant *requires* higher fidelity audio (as in claim 3), the remaining keys are released.
    *   If the assistant determines the utterance is irrelevant to its function, no additional keys are sent.
*   **Pseudocode (Device):**

```
function processAudio(audioData):
  esm = analyzeEmotion(audioData)
  frequencyBands = partitionAudio(audioData)
  keys = generateBaseKeys(len(frequencyBands))

  for i in range(len(frequencyBands)):
    keys[i] = modifyKeyComplexity(keys[i], esm[i]) // Higher ESM weight -> more complex key

  encryptedBands = encrypt(frequencyBands, keys)
  encryptedAudio = combineBands(encryptedBands)

  sendEncryptedAudio(encryptedAudio)
  sendKey(keys[priorityBand]) // Send the key for the highest emotional significance band
```

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond simple frequency partitioning by dynamically adapting encryption strength based on *emotional context*. It prioritizes transmission of emotionally salient frequencies, potentially improving assistant responsiveness to user intent while maintaining a strong privacy baseline. It also allows for a graduated release of audio fidelity, offering a dynamic trade-off between security and accuracy.
