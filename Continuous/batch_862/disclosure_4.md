## Adaptive Data Block Granularity & Tiering

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the physical data block size and storage tier based on access patterns *and* data entropy/predictability, optimizing for both read performance and storage cost. Existing systems appear fixed in block size. This adapts.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Entropy Analysis Module:**  A background process that continuously analyzes data within physical data blocks. This isnâ€™t just frequency analysis, but an attempt to *predict* future data values within a block given historical values. Higher predictability = lower entropy.
*   **Granularity Adjustment Engine:** Capable of splitting or merging physical data blocks *without* full data movement. This will leverage a combination of copy-on-write and metadata redirection.  Initial implementation will target adjustments in powers of 2 (e.g., 64KB, 32KB, 16KB).
*   **Tiering Policy Manager:** Defines storage tiers (e.g., NVMe, SSD, HDD, Object Storage) with associated costs and performance characteristics.  Policy rules are based on data entropy *and* access frequency.
*   **Metadata Extension:** Existing block metadata is extended to include:
    *   Entropy Score (0-100, 100 being highly predictable)
    *   Current Block Size
    *   Storage Tier
    *   Last Entropy Calculation Timestamp
*   **Access Pattern Monitor:** Tracks read/write frequency for each block.  Used in conjunction with entropy score to trigger tiering or granularity adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Adjustment Engine):**

```
function adjust_granularity(block_id):
  entropy_score = get_entropy_score(block_id)
  access_frequency = get_access_frequency(block_id)

  if entropy_score > 80 and access_frequency < 10:  //Highly predictable, low access
    new_size = current_size * 0.5  //Reduce block size
    if new_size < min_block_size:
       new_size = min_block_size
    split_block(block_id, new_size)
  elif entropy_score < 20 and access_frequency > 50: //Unpredictable, high access
    new_size = current_size * 2 //Increase block size
    if new_size > max_block_size:
       new_size = max_block_size
    merge_block(block_id, new_size)
  else:
    //No change
    pass

function split_block(block_id, new_size):
  //Use copy-on-write to create a new block.
  //Redirect metadata pointers to the new smaller blocks.
  //Update metadata to reflect the new block size.

function merge_block(block_id, new_size):
  //Combine data from adjacent blocks into a larger block.
  //Update metadata pointers to reflect the new merged block.
  //Update metadata to reflect the new block size.
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Copy-on-write is critical to minimizing disruption during block splitting and merging.
*   The entropy calculation should be efficient and use a rolling window to avoid full data scans.
*   Tiering policies need to be configurable and allow administrators to define cost/performance trade-offs.
*   The system needs to handle concurrent access and ensure data consistency during adjustments.
