## Dynamic Resonance Mapping for Internal Cavity Cleaning – Autonomous System

**Concept:** Expand the passive brush cleaning concept into an *active* system capable of autonomously mapping resonant frequencies within complex internal cavities (e.g., engine intakes, drone bodies) and dynamically adjusting excitation frequencies to maximize debris removal.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Miniature Accelerometers: Distributed along the internal surfaces of the target cavity (can be pre-installed during manufacture or deployed via robotic arm). High sensitivity, broad frequency range.
    *   Microphone Array:  Strategically placed to capture acoustic responses within the cavity.  Used for initial frequency sweep and resonance identification.
    *   Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) / Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS): (Optional) – Integrated to verify debris removal and material composition changes.
*   **Excitation System:**
    *   Array of Piezoelectric Actuators:  Mounted internally, strategically positioned to create complex vibrational patterns.  Capable of individual control and phased excitation.
    *   Electromagnetic Shakers: (Alternative) – For larger cavities or frequencies beyond piezoelectric capabilities.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Embedded Processor: High-speed processing for real-time data acquisition, analysis, and control.
    *   AI/Machine Learning Algorithm: (Core component) – Trained to:
        *   Identify resonant frequencies based on accelerometer/microphone data.
        *   Map resonance patterns within the cavity.
        *   Dynamically adjust actuator frequencies and phases to maximize debris dislodgement.
        *   Compensate for changes in cavity conditions (temperature, pressure).
        *   Predict debris location based on initial scans.
*   **Brush System:**
    *   Micro-Brush Array: Deployable through small access ports. Utilizing the brush design from the provided patent, these are the active element interacting with dislodged particles.  Formed from flexible materials (e.g., silicone, polyurethane).  Brush density and stiffness customizable based on cavity geometry and debris type.
    *   Brush Deployment/Retrieval Mechanism: Miniaturized robotic arm or pneumatic system for precise brush placement and removal.
*   **Power System:**
    *   Wireless Power Transfer: Preferred for remote operation and reduced cabling.
    *   Battery Backup: For emergency operation and prolonged use.

**Novelty:**

The system moves beyond passive resonance cleaning to *active* resonance mapping and dynamic control. The AI-driven algorithm adapts to the specific geometry of the cavity and the type of debris present, maximizing cleaning efficiency.  Integration of debris mapping sensors enhances targeting and verification. This isn’t just shaking something to clean it, but intelligently *finding* the cleaning frequencies and maximizing their effect.
