## Dynamic Narrative Stitching with Emotional Resonance Mapping

**System Overview:** A system designed to create highly personalized video sequences by not only analyzing scene and shot types but also mapping and responding to emotional cues within the source video and potentially external biometric data. This goes beyond simple scene/shot similarity – it attempts to construct a narrative *feeling* tailored to the viewer.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Emotional Feature Extractor (EFE):** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a massive dataset of video frames paired with emotional annotations (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise).  The EFE extracts a multi-dimensional emotional feature vector for each frame. This differs from basic facial expression recognition; it's about the *overall* emotional tone of the scene, considering lighting, color palettes, and scene composition.

2.  **Biometric Data Integration Module (BDIM):** This module accepts real-time biometric data from a connected wearable device (e.g., heart rate variability, skin conductance).  It translates this data into a “viewer emotional state” vector, representing the viewer’s current emotional level.  This is optional; the system can function without biometric input, relying solely on video analysis.

3.  **Dynamic Narrative Graph (DNG):**  Instead of a simple trellis graph, this is a weighted graph where nodes represent video segments (potentially as small as a few seconds). Edge weights are calculated based on *multiple* factors:

    *   Scene Similarity (using the original patent's encoder networks)
    *   Shot Similarity (using the original patent’s encoder networks)
    *   *Emotional Transition Cost*:  This is a novel metric. It measures the “emotional distance” between the end emotional state of one segment and the beginning emotional state of the next. A transition from joy to sadness would have a high cost; a transition from joy to neutral would have a lower cost.
    *   *Biometric Resonance*:  If biometric data is available, this weight reflects how well the emotional tone of the segment aligns with the viewer’s current emotional state.  Segments that match the viewer’s mood receive a higher weight.

4.  **Sequence Optimization Engine (SOE):** An optimization algorithm (e.g., a genetic algorithm or reinforcement learning) that searches the DNG for the video sequence with the lowest total cost. The cost function combines all the edge weights – maximizing emotional coherence, minimizing jarring transitions, and, if applicable, maximizing biometric resonance.

**Pseudocode - SOE:**

```
function OptimizeSequence(DNG, StartNode, EndNode, ViewerEmotionalState) {
  // Initialize population of potential sequences (paths through DNG)
  Population = GenerateRandomPaths(DNG, StartNode, EndNode, PopulationSize)

  for (Generation = 0; Generation < MaxGenerations; Generation++) {
    // Evaluate fitness of each sequence
    for (Sequence in Population) {
      Sequence.Fitness = CalculateSequenceFitness(Sequence, ViewerEmotionalState)
    }

    // Select best sequences for reproduction
    SelectedSequences = SelectBestSequences(Population, SelectionPressure)

    // Crossover and Mutation to create new population
    NewPopulation = CrossoverAndMutate(SelectedSequences)

    Population = NewPopulation
  }

  // Return best sequence found
  return GetBestSequence(Population)
}

function CalculateSequenceFitness(Sequence, ViewerEmotionalState) {
  TotalCost = 0
  for (i = 0; i < Sequence.Length - 1; i++) {
    Node1 = Sequence[i]
    Node2 = Sequence[i+1]
    Cost = CalculateEdgeCost(Node1, Node2, ViewerEmotionalState)
    TotalCost += Cost
  }
  return 1 / (1 + TotalCost) // Higher fitness for lower cost
}

function CalculateEdgeCost(Node1, Node2, ViewerEmotionalState) {
  SceneSimilarity = GetSceneSimilarity(Node1, Node2)
  ShotSimilarity = GetShotSimilarity(Node1, Node2)
  EmotionalDistance = GetEmotionalDistance(Node1, Node2)
  BiometricResonance = GetBiometricResonance(Node1, Node2, ViewerEmotionalState)

  Cost = (1 - SceneSimilarity) + (1 - ShotSimilarity) + EmotionalDistance + (1 - BiometricResonance)
  return Cost
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply stitching together visually similar clips. It actively constructs a narrative that resonates with the viewer’s emotional state, potentially creating a deeply personalized and emotionally engaging experience. The incorporation of biometric data and emotional feature extraction represents a significant advance over existing video editing techniques.
