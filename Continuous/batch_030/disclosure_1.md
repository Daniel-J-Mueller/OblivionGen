## Dynamic CDC Schema Evolution & Predictive Augmentation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically evolving Change Data Capture (CDC) schemas and proactively augmenting CDC logs with predicted related data based on historical patterns and AI inference.

**Core Concept:**  The existing patent focuses on *configured* augmentation – specifying *which* data from related tables to include. This expands on that by automatically discovering *relevant* data and predicting future augmentation needs. 

**Components:**

1.  **CDC Schema Monitor:**  Continuously analyzes incoming CDC events. It tracks schema changes in source tables (new columns, data type alterations, etc.).
2.  **Relationship Discovery Engine:** Uses statistical analysis and graph database techniques to automatically identify relationships between tables beyond simple foreign key constraints.  This includes functional dependencies, common data elements, and temporal correlations.
3.  **AI Inference Model:** Trained on historical CDC data and relationship data. The model predicts which related data *should* be included in the CDC log for a given event, even if it wasn’t explicitly configured.
4.  **Augmentation Pipeline:**  Dynamically adds data to CDC logs based on the AI Inference Model’s predictions.  This pipeline integrates with the existing augmentation mechanisms, allowing for both configured and predicted data to be included.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** Monitors the usage of augmented data by downstream consumers (data lakes, warehouses, applications). If augmented data is frequently used, the AI model reinforces the relationship. If unused, it weakens the connection.

**Pseudocode - AI Inference Model:**

```
function predict_augmentation(cdc_event, historical_data, relationship_graph):
    // 1. Extract key attributes from cdc_event
    attributes = extract_attributes(cdc_event)

    // 2. Identify potential related tables via relationship_graph
    related_tables = find_related_tables(attributes, relationship_graph)

    // 3. For each related table, find relevant records based on attributes
    candidate_records = []
    for table in related_tables:
        records = query_table(table, attributes)
        candidate_records.append(records)

    // 4.  Score each candidate record based on historical usage patterns & AI model
    scored_records = score_records(candidate_records, historical_data, AI_model)

    // 5.  Select top N scored records based on a confidence threshold
    selected_records = select_top_n(scored_records, confidence_threshold)

    return selected_records
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Relationship Graph:**  A graph database storing relationships between tables. Nodes represent tables; edges represent relationships (foreign keys, functional dependencies, statistical correlations). Edge weights represent the strength of the relationship.
*   **Historical Data:** Stores usage statistics of augmented data.  Records include: CDC event ID, augmented data ID, access count, last accessed timestamp.

**Implementation Details:**

*   The AI Inference Model could be a combination of machine learning algorithms:  Recommendation systems (collaborative filtering), graph neural networks, time series forecasting.
*   The augmentation pipeline should be designed for low latency to avoid impacting CDC performance.
*   A monitoring dashboard should provide insights into the effectiveness of the AI model and the usage of augmented data.
