**Dynamic Skill-Based Proximity Search & Mentorship Pairing**

**Concept:** Extend the proximity search beyond location and department to incorporate skill sets and mentorship opportunities.  Instead of just finding people *near* you, find people *with the skills you need help with*, or *who could benefit from your skills*.  This transforms the system from a simple directory into a dynamic mentorship and collaborative network.

**Specs:**

*   **Skill Profile Database:** Each user profile will include a detailed, tagged skill profile. Skills will be categorized (e.g., programming languages, project management methodologies, specific software expertise) and ranked by proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, expert).  This data can be self-reported, validated through internal assessments, or inferred from project history.
*   **Need/Offer Flags:** Users can flag specific skills they *need help with* or skills they are *willing to mentor others in*. These flags create a searchable "need/offer" matrix.
*   **Proximity Scoring Algorithm (Revised):** The proximity score will be a weighted sum of four components:
    *   **Location Weight:** (As in the original patent - decreasing weight) – Physical proximity.
    *   **Department Weight:** (As in the original patent - decreasing weight) – Organizational alignment.
    *   **Skill Match Weight:** – A score based on the overlap between the user’s "needed skills" and the potential mentor’s "offered skills."  Higher overlap = higher score.  Consider using semantic similarity algorithms to account for related skills (e.g., "Python" is related to "data science").
    *   **Mentorship Compatibility Weight:** – A score calculated from shared interests (optional profile field), career goals, and perhaps even personality assessments (optional). This aims to identify individuals who not only have the skills but are also a good fit for a mentorship relationship.
*   **Search Interface:** A new search interface allowing users to:
    *   Specify skills they need help with.
    *   Specify skills they are willing to mentor in.
    *   Adjust the weighting of the proximity score components (e.g., prioritize skill match over location).
    *   Filter results by seniority, team, or other criteria.
*   **Automated Mentorship Suggestions:**  The system will proactively suggest potential mentors or mentees based on user profiles and skill gaps.
*   **Collaboration Tools Integration:**  Integrate with existing collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing between paired individuals.

**Pseudocode (Proximity Scoring Algorithm):**

```
function calculateProximityScore(userProfile, potentialMatchProfile):
  locationScore = calculateLocationScore(userProfile, potentialMatchProfile)  //Weight: 10%
  departmentScore = calculateDepartmentScore(userProfile, potentialMatchProfile) //Weight: 10%
  skillMatchScore = calculateSkillMatchScore(userProfile, potentialMatchProfile) //Weight: 50%
  mentorshipCompatibilityScore = calculateMentorshipCompatibilityScore(userProfile, potentialMatchProfile) //Weight: 30%

  proximityScore = (0.1 * locationScore) + (0.1 * departmentScore) + (0.5 * skillMatchScore) + (0.3 * mentorshipCompatibilityScore)

  return proximityScore
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserProfile`: {`userID`, `location`, `department`, `skills` (list of skill objects), `neededSkills` (list of skill objects), `interests`, `careerGoals`}
*   `SkillObject`: {`skillName`, `proficiencyLevel`}
*   `MentorshipCompatibilityScore` : (derived from interest, career goal, etc)
