## Dynamic Password & Reputation-Based Access Control for Physical Spaces

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic password & predefined rule system not to financial transactions, but to physical access control â€“ buildings, rooms, secured areas. Integrate reputation scoring based on access history and user behavior.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Key Fob/Wearable Device: Generates time-based or event-based dynamic passwords. Bluetooth/NFC communication. Minimal display for password visualization.
    *   Access Point: Door/entryway reader. Communicates with central server. Receives password & identifier from key fob.
    *   Central Server:  Stores user profiles, access rules, reputation scores, dynamic password generation algorithms.

*   **Software:**
    *   Key Fob Firmware:  Password generation, communication protocol, encryption.
    *   Access Point Firmware:  Password reception, identifier reading, communication with central server.
    *   Server Application:
        *   User Management:  Create/manage user accounts, associate identifiers (employee ID, key fob serial number) with accounts.
        *   Rule Engine: Define access rules based on identifiers, time of day, location, user reputation.
        *   Reputation Scoring Algorithm: Tracks access history (successful/failed attempts), time sensitivity, anomalous behavior (e.g., attempting access outside authorized hours, multiple failed attempts).  Points awarded/deducted based on actions.
        *   Dynamic Password Generation:  Algorithm to generate time-based or event-based dynamic passwords.  Encryption/decryption keys securely stored.
        *   Communication Protocol: Secure communication between access points and server.

**Workflow:**

1.  User approaches access point.
2.  Key fob generates dynamic password.
3.  Key fob transmits identifier and dynamic password to access point.
4.  Access point transmits identifier and password to central server.
5.  Server:
    *   Authenticates user based on identifier.
    *   Retrieves user's reputation score.
    *   Retrieves access rules associated with the identifier.
    *   Validates dynamic password.
    *   Evaluates combined criteria (password match, reputation score, access rules).
6.  Server sends approval/denial signal to access point.
7.  Access point unlocks/locks the door accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Validation):**

```
function validateAccess(identifier, dynamicPassword):
    user = getUser(identifier)
    if user == null:
        return false

    reputationScore = user.reputationScore
    accessRules = getAccessRules(identifier)

    if dynamicPassword != generateCurrentPassword(identifier):
        return false

    if reputationScore < accessRules.minimumReputation:
        return false

    if currentTimeNotInAllowedAccessWindow(accessRules):
        return false

    return true
```

**Novelty:**

This system expands the dynamic password concept beyond financial transactions, applying it to physical security. The integration of a reputation scoring system adds an extra layer of security and provides a dynamic risk assessment.  A user with a consistently positive access history might have more leeway than a user with a history of failed attempts or suspicious activity. This could even allow for temporary override of access restrictions in emergency situations based on established trust.
