## Adaptive Feature Stream Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the contribution of each feature stream (first, second, combined) based on real-time performance feedback, utilizing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. This moves beyond simple max-pooling to a more nuanced, adaptive system.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Core Speech Recognition Pipeline:** Existing system (as described in the patent) forms the base.
*   **RL Agent:** A Q-learning or Policy Gradient agent responsible for weighting the feature streams.
*   **State Space:**  Represents the current ‘health’ of each feature stream. This will be a vector including:
    *   Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) estimate for each stream (first, second, combined).
    *   Variance of feature vectors within each stream.
    *   Prediction Confidence (from the acoustic model) for each stream’s contribution.
*   **Action Space:** Discrete values representing weighting coefficients for each feature stream.  Example:  [0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%] contribution.  The sum of the weighting coefficients *must* equal 100%.  Actions will control the weights applied to the combined vector *before* max-pooling.
*   **Reward Function:**  Based on the change in Word Error Rate (WER) of the speech recognition output. A *decrease* in WER yields a positive reward. A *increase* yields a negative reward. A zero change yields a neutral reward.  Magnitude of the change will affect reward intensity.
*   **Environment:** The speech recognition pipeline itself.  The RL agent interacts with the pipeline by adjusting weights and observing the WER.

**2.  Algorithm/Process Flow:**

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize the RL agent with random Q-values (or policy parameters).  Set initial feature stream weights to equal values (e.g., 33.3% each).
2.  **Data Input:** Receive audio data and generate the first and second feature streams as described in the patent.
3.  **Weighted Combination:** Apply the current weights (determined by the RL agent) to each feature stream.  This produces a weighted combined vector.
4.  **Max Pooling:** Apply max-pooling to the weighted combined vector and the first transformed vector.
5.  **Speech Recognition:**  Process the max-pooled vector through the existing acoustic and language models.
6.  **WER Calculation:** Calculate the Word Error Rate (WER) of the transcribed utterance.
7.  **Reward Assignment:** Calculate the reward based on the change in WER since the previous iteration.
8.  **Q-Value Update (or Policy Gradient Step):** Update the Q-values (or policy parameters) of the RL agent based on the reward received.
9.  **Iteration:** Repeat steps 2-8 for each utterance or a sliding window of utterances.

**3.  Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
RL_Agent = new Q_Learning_Agent()
Initial_Weights = [0.33, 0.33, 0.33] // Weights for [First Stream, Second Stream, Combined Stream]

// For each utterance:
Audio_Data -> First_Feature_Stream, Second_Feature_Stream
Weighted_First_Stream = First_Feature_Stream * RL_Agent.Current_Weights[0]
Weighted_Second_Stream = Second_Feature_Stream * RL_Agent.Current_Weights[1]
Weighted_Combined_Stream = Combined_Stream * RL_Agent.Current_Weights[2]

Combined_Vector = Weighted_First_Stream + Weighted_Second_Stream

Max_Pooled_Vector = MaxPool(First_Transformed_Vector, Combined_Vector)

Transcription = SpeechRecognition(Max_Pooled_Vector)

WER = CalculateWordErrorRate(Transcription, GroundTruthTranscription)

Reward = CalculateReward(PreviousWER, WER)

RL_Agent.UpdateQValues(Reward)

// Update weights for next iteration
RL_Agent.Current_Weights = RL_Agent.ChooseAction()
```

**4. Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   This system can be implemented in software on existing hardware infrastructure.
*   Requires sufficient processing power to run the RL agent and speech recognition pipeline concurrently.
*   A large dataset of audio data is needed to train the RL agent effectively.
*   The reward function and state space may require careful tuning to achieve optimal performance.
