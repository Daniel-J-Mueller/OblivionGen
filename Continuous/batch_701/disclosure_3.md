## Automated Contextual Question Re-Framing & Proactive Forum Suggestion

**System Specifications:**

**Core Function:** To dynamically re-frame unanswered questions in a source forum to maximize answerability *before* cross-posting, and to proactively identify and ‘warm up’ target forums for increased response likelihood.

**Components:**

1.  **Question Analysis Module (QAM):**
    *   Input: Unanswered question text from source forum.
    *   Process:
        *   **Semantic Dissection:** Employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify key concepts, entities, and implicit assumptions within the question.
        *   **Answerability Assessment:** Evaluate the question’s current form for potential barriers to answering (ambiguity, lack of context, overly broad scope, technical jargon).
        *   **Re-Framing Engine:**  Based on assessment, automatically generate several alternative phrasings of the question.  These variations prioritize clarity, specificity, and contextual grounding. Examples: expanding abbreviations, defining key terms, breaking down complex questions into simpler sub-questions.  Maintain a ‘proven phrasing’ database based on historical response rates.
        *   **Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score to each re-framed question, indicating the likelihood of eliciting a response.
2.  **Forum Health & Affinity Engine (FHE):**
    *   Input:  Semantic representation of the question (from QAM).
    *   Process:
        *   **Semantic Forum Index:** A dynamically updated index of all monitored forums, indexed by semantic topics.
        *   **Forum Health Metrics:** Track key forum health indicators (active users, response time, recent thread activity, sentiment analysis of discussions).
        *   **Affinity Scoring:** Calculate an affinity score between the question’s semantic representation and each forum’s indexed topics, weighted by forum health.  Higher scores indicate better potential for engagement.
        *   **'Warm-Up' Protocol:** *Proactively* seed the top-scoring target forum with related (but not identical) content *before* posting the question.  This could include sharing relevant articles, initiating a brief discussion thread, or prompting a few users with related expertise. The goal is to increase forum awareness of the topic and encourage engagement.
3.  **Cross-Posting & Monitoring Module (CPM):**
    *   Input:  Highest-confidence re-framed question, top-scoring target forum, 'warm-up' results.
    *   Process:
        *   Automatic cross-posting of the re-framed question to the target forum.
        *   Real-time monitoring of responses in both the source and target forums.
        *   Intelligent response aggregation and presentation (e.g., highlighting the most helpful answers, combining responses from multiple forums).
        *   Feedback loop: Use response rates and user engagement metrics to refine the QAM and FHE algorithms.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessUnansweredQuestion(questionText, sourceForum):
  reframeOptions = QAM.GenerateReframeOptions(questionText)
  scoredOptions = QAM.ScoreReframeOptions(reframeOptions)
  bestReframe = scoredOptions.HighestConfidenceOption

  targetForums = FHE.IdentifyTargetForums(bestReframe)
  warmUpResults = FHE.WarmUpTargetForums(targetForums)

  CPM.PostQuestion(bestReframe, targetForums, warmUpResults)
  CPM.MonitorResponses(bestReframe, sourceForum, targetForums)
  CPM.AggregateAndPresentResponses(sourceForum, targetForums)

  CPM.UpdateModels(responseMetrics, engagementMetrics)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply *finding* a better forum. It actively *prepares* both the question and the forum to maximize the likelihood of a helpful response. The 'warm-up' protocol is a key differentiator, addressing the issue of forum cold starts and increasing engagement. The dynamic feedback loop ensures continuous improvement of the system’s accuracy and effectiveness.
