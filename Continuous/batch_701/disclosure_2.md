## Dynamic Projection Mapping with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend the shape-based edge detection system to incorporate real-time biofeedback data (heart rate, skin conductance, muscle tension) from a user to dynamically alter projected content and the projection mapping itself. This creates an immersive, responsive environment that adapts to the user’s emotional and physiological state.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrated wearable sensors (wristband, headband) to capture biofeedback data. Data transmission via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the processing unit.
*   **Data Processing Unit:** A dedicated processor (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) responsible for receiving, filtering, and analyzing biofeedback data. Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to map physiological signals to emotional states (e.g., calm, excited, anxious).
*   **Mapping Algorithm Enhancement:** Modify the shape alignment algorithm to incorporate a "responsiveness factor" derived from the biofeedback data.
    *   *Responsiveness Factor:* A scalar value between 0 and 1. Higher values indicate a greater degree of dynamic adjustment to the projected content and mapping. This is determined via the ML algorithm.
    *   *Dynamic Adjustment:* 
        *   **Shape Warping:**  Subtle, real-time warping of the detected surface shape based on the responsiveness factor.  For instance, a calming state might result in a smoother, more organic shape, while an excited state could introduce sharper edges or more exaggerated features.  Implemented using non-rigid deformation techniques (e.g., Thin Plate Splines).
        *   **Content Modulation:** Alter projected visuals (color, brightness, texture, animation) in response to the user’s state. This can be achieved through procedural generation or dynamic asset selection.
        *   **Projection Intensity Control:** Adjust the brightness and focus of the projector to emphasize or de-emphasize specific areas of the projected content.
*   **Point Cloud Synchronization:** The system must maintain a synchronized point cloud representation of the target surface, updated at a minimum rate of 60Hz to ensure smooth dynamic adjustments. Utilize a Kalman filter to fuse data from multiple sensors (cameras, depth sensors) for improved accuracy and robustness.
*   **Content Library:** A library of procedural content and adaptive assets designed to respond to biofeedback input. Content categories include: ambient visuals, interactive games, guided meditations, and therapeutic exercises.
*   **User Interface:** A simple user interface for calibrating the system, selecting content, and adjusting responsiveness settings.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    1.  Capture Biofeedback Data (Heart Rate, Skin Conductance, Muscle Tension)
    2.  Process Biofeedback Data -> Determine Emotional State -> Calculate Responsiveness Factor
    3.  Capture Image Data -> Generate Point Cloud
    4.  Detect Surfaces & Boundaries using existing patent algorithm.
    5.  Align Shape Model to Detected Surface.
    6.  Apply Dynamic Adjustment:
        a.  Warp Shape Model based on Responsiveness Factor and Emotional State.
        b.  Select & Modulate Content based on Responsiveness Factor and Emotional State.
        c.  Adjust Projection Intensity.
    7.  Render & Project Content onto Surface.
    8.  Repeat from Step 1.
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Entertainment:** Create personalized and emotionally engaging gaming and entertainment experiences.
*   **Therapeutic Environments:** Develop therapeutic applications for stress reduction, anxiety management, and pain relief.
*   **Enhanced Training:** Improve training simulations by dynamically adapting to the user’s cognitive and emotional state.
*   **Artistic Installations:** Create interactive art installations that respond to the audience’s emotions.
