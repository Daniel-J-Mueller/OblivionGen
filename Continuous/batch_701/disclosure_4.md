## Dynamic Network Traffic Shaping via Predictive AI

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** AI-powered Predictive Traffic Shaper (PTS).
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Network Traffic Logs (as per provided patent – source/destination IP, firewall decisions).
    *   Virtual Machine (VM) Performance Metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O).
    *   Application-Level Metrics (e.g., database query latency, web server response times – accessible via agents within VMs).
    *   Historical Traffic Patterns (long-term storage of traffic data).
    *   External Threat Intelligence Feeds.
*   **AI Model:** A hybrid approach:
    *   **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:**  For time-series forecasting of network traffic volume and patterns *per VM*.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent:** To dynamically adjust traffic shaping parameters (bandwidth limits, QoS priorities) *per VM* based on predicted traffic and application performance.
*   **Traffic Shaping Implementation:** Integration with existing firewall/network infrastructure via standard APIs (e.g., NetFlow, sFlow, OpenFlow).
*   **Management Interface:** Web-based dashboard for monitoring, configuration, and anomaly detection.

**Innovation Description:**

The system proactively shapes network traffic *before* congestion occurs, rather than reacting to it.  It moves beyond simple bandwidth allocation to intelligent traffic prioritization based on *predicted* application needs.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (executed continuously)

FOR EACH VM IN System:

  // 1. Data Collection
  traffic_data = GetNetworkTrafficLogs(VM)
  vm_metrics = GetVMPerformanceMetrics(VM)
  app_metrics = GetApplicationPerformanceMetrics(VM)

  // 2. Prediction
  predicted_traffic = LSTM_Predict(traffic_data, vm_metrics, app_metrics)

  // 3. RL-Based Decision Making
  action = RL_Agent_Decide(predicted_traffic, current_traffic_shape) // Returns new traffic shape parameters

  // 4. Apply Traffic Shaping
  ApplyTrafficShape(VM, action)

  // 5. Monitoring and Feedback
  MonitorPerformance(VM)
  RL_Agent_Feedback(actual_performance, predicted_performance) // Train RL agent
```

**Detailed Components:**

*   **LSTM Network:** Trained on historical data to predict future traffic volume and patterns for each VM.  Input features include time-of-day, day-of-week, application type, VM resource usage, and historical traffic data.
*   **RL Agent:** A Deep Q-Network (DQN) or similar algorithm.  The state space includes predicted traffic volume, current traffic shape, VM resource usage, and application performance.  The action space includes adjusting bandwidth limits, QoS priorities, and traffic shaping rules.  The reward function encourages minimizing latency, maximizing throughput, and preventing congestion.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  A separate module that analyzes traffic patterns for deviations from the norm.  Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., isolation forests, one-class SVMs) to identify potential security threats or performance issues.
*   **Real-time Alerting:**  Sends alerts to administrators when anomalies are detected or when performance thresholds are exceeded.

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond passive logging and reactive traffic shaping. By combining predictive AI with reinforcement learning, it *proactively* optimizes network performance and prevents congestion before it occurs. The per-VM granularity allows for fine-grained control and personalized optimization. The integration of application-level metrics provides a more holistic view of performance and enables more intelligent decision-making.
