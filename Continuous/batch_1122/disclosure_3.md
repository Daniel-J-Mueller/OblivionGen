## Dynamic Resource Proxying with Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the multi-security level concept to incorporate a dynamic proxy layer. Instead of *just* differing security levels based on resource type, introduce a reputation-based proxy that intercepts resource requests and dynamically applies security measures *based on the requesting client’s assessed trustworthiness*.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Reputation Engine:**
    *   Input: Client IP address, User-Agent string, historical request patterns (frequency, resource types, time of day), and potentially user login credentials (if available).
    *   Processing: Machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on a dataset of known malicious/benign clients.  Features should include request frequency, resource type, time-based patterns, geolocation, and any available user data.
    *   Output:  A trustworthiness score (0-100).  Higher scores indicate greater trustworthiness.  This score should be persistent (cached with a TTL) for the client.

2.  **Dynamic Proxy Layer:**
    *   Interception: All resource requests pass through this proxy.
    *   Reputation Lookup: Proxy queries the Reputation Engine to obtain the client's trustworthiness score.
    *   Security Policy Selection: Based on the score and the requested resource type, the proxy selects a security policy.  Policies are defined in a configuration file.  Example policies:

        *   **High Trust (80-100):** Minimal security – Direct connection to the resource server.  (Similar to default behavior).
        *   **Medium Trust (50-79):**  TLS 1.3 with standard cipher suites. Rate limiting.
        *   **Low Trust (20-49):** TLS 1.3 with stronger cipher suites.  Two-Factor Authentication prompt.  Resource content filtering.
        *   **Very Low Trust (0-19):**  Resource access denied.  IP address blocked.  Alert sent to security team.

    *   Policy Enforcement:  The proxy enforces the selected security policy by:
        *   Establishing a new secure connection to the resource server.
        *   Performing content filtering (if required).
        *   Applying rate limiting.
        *   Forwarding the request to the resource server.
        *   Returning the response to the client.

3.  **Resource Server Integration:**
    *   Resource servers remain largely unchanged. They respond to requests as before.  The proxy handles all security concerns.
    *   Resource servers should log all requests, including the client’s IP address and the security policy applied by the proxy.  This data can be used to improve the Reputation Engine's accuracy.

4.  **Configuration File Format (JSON):**

```json
{
  "security_policies": [
    {
      "trust_level": "high",
      "min_score": 80,
      "tls_version": "1.3",
      "cipher_suites": ["TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256", "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"],
      "rate_limit": 100, //requests per minute
      "content_filtering": false
    },
    {
      "trust_level": "medium",
      "min_score": 50,
      "tls_version": "1.3",
      "cipher_suites": ["TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"],
      "rate_limit": 50,
      "content_filtering": false
    },
    {
      "trust_level": "low",
      "min_score": 20,
      "tls_version": "1.3",
      "cipher_suites": ["TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"],
      "rate_limit": 20,
      "content_filtering": true
    },
    {
      "trust_level": "very_low",
      "min_score": 0,
      "tls_version": "1.3",
      "cipher_suites": [],
      "rate_limit": 0,
      "content_filtering": false,
      "block_access": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pseudocode (Proxy Layer):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  clientIP = request.getClientIP()
  trustScore = getTrustScore(clientIP)
  policy = selectSecurityPolicy(trustScore)

  if policy.block_access:
    return error("Access Denied")

  secureConnection = establishSecureConnection(policy)
  forwardRequest(request, secureConnection)
  response = receiveResponse(secureConnection)
  return response
```

This adds a dynamic layer of security that adapts to the client's trustworthiness, potentially reducing the overhead for trusted clients while providing stronger protection against malicious actors. It’s a behavioral extension of the original patent, rather than just resource categorization.
