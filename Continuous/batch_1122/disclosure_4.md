## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predictive Failure Analysis

**Specification:** A system to proactively adjust resource allocation to code executions *before* failures occur, leveraging real-time execution telemetry and predictive modeling.

**Components:**

1.  **Telemetry Agent:** Integrated into the virtual machine instances. Collects metrics like CPU utilization, memory pressure, I/O latency, network bandwidth, and custom application-specific metrics. Data is streamed in real-time.
2.  **Predictive Failure Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, LSTM) trained on historical execution data. This model learns to identify patterns preceding failures for *specific* program codes. Inputs are telemetry data streams. Outputs are a probability score indicating the likelihood of failure within a defined time window.  Model should be dynamically updated with each new execution.
3.  **Resource Allocation Manager:** Monitors failure probability scores from the Predictive Failure Model. When a threshold is exceeded, the manager dynamically adjusts resource allocation for *current and future* executions of the affected code.
4.  **Execution Queue Monitor:** Watches incoming code execution requests. If the Resource Allocation Manager has increased resource allocation for a particular code, the Execution Queue Monitor prioritizes those requests and allocates the increased resources *before* execution begins.
5.  **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Integration:** When a failure *does* occur despite proactive resource allocation, the system logs detailed telemetry data to the DLQ for model retraining and refinement.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Telemetry Agent (within VM)
loop:
  collect_metrics()
  stream_metrics_to_central_server()
  sleep(100ms)

// Central Server - Predictive Failure Model
model = load_pretrained_model()
loop:
  metrics = receive_metrics()
  prediction = model.predict(metrics)
  if prediction.failure_probability > threshold:
    signal_resource_allocation_manager(code_id, increased_resource_allocation)
  model.update(metrics) // Continuous learning

// Resource Allocation Manager
loop:
  signal = receive_signal()
  update_resource_allocation(signal.code_id, signal.increased_allocation)

// Execution Queue Monitor
loop:
  request = receive_execution_request()
  code_id = request.code_id
  allocation = get_resource_allocation(code_id)
  allocate_resources(request, allocation)
  add_request_to_queue(request)
```

**Resource Allocation Levels:**

*   **CPU:** Increase/decrease the number of cores allocated.
*   **Memory:** Adjust the memory limit.
*   **Network Bandwidth:** Prioritize network traffic.
*   **I/O Priority:** Give preferential access to storage resources.

**Novelty:** This differs from the provided patent by *proactively* adjusting resources *before* a failure based on predictive modeling, rather than reacting to failures and routing requests to a DLQ. The intent is to *prevent* failures, not simply manage them. The dynamic, code-specific resource allocation is also a key distinction.
