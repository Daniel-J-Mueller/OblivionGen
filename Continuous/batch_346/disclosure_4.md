## Modular Docking Station Ecosystem - "Guardian Nodes"

**Concept:** Expand the docking station functionality beyond simple security device charging/connection to create a distributed network of "Guardian Nodes" throughout a building or campus. These nodes aren't just for the security device; they act as localized data hubs, environmental sensors, and interactive points.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Form Factor:**  Spherical, approximately 15cm diameter.  Material:  Polycarbonate shell with embedded conductive charging surface.  Color customizable via RGB LED array visible through semi-transparent sections.
*   **Communication:** Mesh network using low-power Bluetooth 5.2 and Zigbee.  Each node communicates with neighboring nodes and a central server.  WiFi connectivity as backup.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Microphone array for sound event detection (glass break, shouting).
    *   Passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor.
    *   Air quality sensors (VOC, CO2, particulate matter).
    *   Temperature and humidity sensor.
    *   Ambient light sensor.
*   **Security Device Interface:**  Inductive charging pad conforming to Qi standard, optimized for the security device (D978855).  Data synchronization via secure Bluetooth pairing.
*   **Power:**  Nodes can be powered via AC adapter, PoE (Power over Ethernet), or rechargeable battery (with wireless charging capability).
*   **User Interaction:**
    *   Proximity sensor: Activates a customizable LED greeting or provides basic information (time, weather) via a small OLED display.
    *   Haptic feedback:  Subtle vibrations to indicate status or alerts.
    *   Voice control: Integration with voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant) for basic commands.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Over-the-air (OTA) updates for firmware and security patches.
    *   Local data processing: Basic event detection and data filtering performed on the node itself.
    *   Secure communication protocol: Encrypted data transmission to the central server.
    *   API: Open API for third-party integration.

**Pseudocode (Event Detection):**

```
// Node processes audio input
audioData = getAudioData()

// Check for predefined sound events
if (detectGlassBreak(audioData)) {
    triggerAlert("Glass Break Detected", nodeID)
    sendDataToServer(nodeID, "Glass Break", timestamp)
}

if (detectShouting(audioData)) {
    triggerAlert("Shouting Detected", nodeID)
    sendDataToServer(nodeID, "Shouting", timestamp)
}

// Check for motion
if (detectMotion()) {
    sendDataToServer(nodeID, "Motion Detected", timestamp)
}

// Check air quality
airQuality = getAirQualityData()
if (airQuality.VOC > threshold) {
    sendDataToServer(nodeID, "High VOC Levels", timestamp)
}

```

**Refinement:**  Nodes could be clustered to form a more robust network.  Different node types could be created with specialized sensors (e.g., smoke detector node, water leak node).  Nodes could be programmed to trigger automated actions (e.g., turn on lights, adjust thermostat) based on sensor data.  Security device could act as a mobile key to unlock/control networked devices.
