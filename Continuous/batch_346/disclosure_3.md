## Dynamic Semantic Anchors & Personalized Lexical Drift Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to not only determine *current* meaning but to model and predict *future* meaning shifts for terms, personalized to user interaction and evolving corpus data. This will allow proactive vocabulary adaptation and anticipatory search refinement.

**Specs:**

**1. Semantic Anchor Generation:**

*   **Input:** Electronic book content, metadata, user query, user interaction data (clicks, dwell time, explicit feedback), timestamp.
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify key terms in query and target passage.
    *   Establish “Semantic Anchors” – vector representations of term meaning *at a specific point in time*. These are based on contextual embeddings derived from the target passage, metadata, and potentially broader corpus data. Metadata weightings configurable via user preference.
    *   Store Semantic Anchors with associated timestamp, user ID (if available), and context identifier.
*   **Output:**  A time-stamped Semantic Anchor representing the term’s meaning within the specific context.

**2. Lexical Drift Modeling:**

*   **Input:**  Series of Semantic Anchors for a term, corpus data updates, user interaction data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to model the evolution of term meaning over time.
    *   Train the LSTM on the historical series of Semantic Anchors.  The LSTM learns to predict the *next* Semantic Anchor in the sequence, effectively modeling ‘lexical drift’.
    *   Incorporate external corpus data updates (new books, revised editions) to refine the model.  Weighting factor for external data configurable.
    *   Personalize drift models based on user interaction. If a user consistently disambiguates a term in a certain way (via corrections or dwell time on specific definitions), adjust their personal model accordingly.
*   **Output:**  A personalized Lexical Drift Model for each term. This model can predict the likely meaning of the term at a future point in time.

**3. Proactive Search & Disambiguation:**

*   **Input:** User query, current time, Lexical Drift Model.
*   **Process:**
    *   Predict the likely meaning of terms in the query *at the current time* using the Lexical Drift Model.
    *   Present multiple search results, ranked not only by relevance but also by the predicted semantic distance between the query term’s predicted meaning and the document’s term usage.
    *   Dynamically adjust search weighting based on user interaction.
    *   Present “Meaning Evolution Timeline” for key terms, visualizing how the meaning has shifted over time, with links to contextual examples.

**4. Adaptive Vocabulary Building:**

*   **Process:**  Implement a gamified vocabulary learning system that presents words in the context of their historical and predicted semantic evolution.
*   **Features:**
    *   “Future Meaning Challenge” – Predict how the meaning of a word will change in the next year.
    *   “Historical Context Explorer” – Trace the etymology and semantic shifts of a word over centuries.
    *   Personalized vocabulary lists based on predicted future usage and user learning patterns.

**Pseudocode (Lexical Drift Prediction):**

```python
def predict_future_meaning(term, current_time, user_id, drift_model, corpus_data):
    # Fetch historical semantic anchors for the term
    anchors = get_semantic_anchors(term, user_id)

    # If not enough anchors, use corpus data to estimate initial meaning
    if len(anchors) < threshold:
        initial_meaning = estimate_meaning_from_corpus(term, corpus_data)
        anchors.append(initial_meaning)

    # Predict next semantic anchor using the LSTM
    predicted_anchor = drift_model.predict(anchors, current_time)

    return predicted_anchor
```
