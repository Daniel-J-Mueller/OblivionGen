## Dynamic Content Source "Blending"

**Concept:** Extend the content source ranking system by allowing *simultaneous* streaming from multiple ranked sources, dynamically blending the streams based on real-time quality metrics. This moves beyond simple failover/switching and aims for consistently optimal playback, even under fluctuating network conditions.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Client Device:** Equipped with multi-stream decoding/buffering capabilities.
*   **Merchant Server:** Maintains the content source ranking, but now also manages “blend profiles”.
*   **Content Sources:** Standard streaming providers (CDNs, etc.).
*   **Blend Profile:**  A JSON object defining:
    *   `primary_source_id`: The ID of the highest-ranked source.
    *   `secondary_source_ids`: An ordered list of IDs for sources to blend with the primary.
    *   `blend_weights`:  A list of floating-point numbers (0.0 – 1.0) corresponding to the `secondary_source_ids`, defining the initial weight given to each source in the blend.  These sum to 1.0 with the primary source implicitly weighted.
    *   `metric_sensitivity`:  A list of floating-point numbers associated with specific quality metrics (e.g., rebuffering rate, resolution, bitrate). Higher values indicate greater sensitivity to changes in that metric.
    *   `adaptation_rate`: A floating-point value defining how quickly the blend weights are adjusted (slower = more stable, faster = more responsive).

**2. Data Flow & Processing:**

1.  **Initial Request:** Client requests content. Merchant server provides a blend profile based on client’s location, device, and network conditions.
2.  **Multi-Stream Download:** Client initiates downloads from all sources defined in the blend profile.  Each stream is buffered separately.
3.  **Real-time Quality Monitoring:** Client continuously measures quality metrics for *each* stream (rebuffering rate, resolution, bitrate, packet loss, etc.).
4.  **Weighted Blend Calculation:** Client combines the buffered stream segments using the current blend weights.
5.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**
    *   Calculate a “quality delta” for each secondary source relative to the primary source, based on the observed metrics and `metric_sensitivity`.
    *   Adjust the blend weights using a smoothing function (e.g., exponential moving average) to converge toward weights that favor sources with higher quality.  The `adaptation_rate` controls the speed of this adjustment.
    *   If a source consistently underperforms, its weight is reduced, potentially to zero, effectively removing it from the blend.
6.  **Playback & Reporting:** Client plays the blended stream and reports updated quality metrics to the merchant server. The server uses this data to refine blend profiles for similar clients.

**3.  Pseudocode (Client-Side Blend Calculation):**

```pseudocode
// Assume 'streams' is an array of buffered stream segments from each source
// 'weights' is an array of blend weights corresponding to each source
// 'current_segment_index' is the index of the segment to be played

function blend_segments(streams, weights, current_segment_index):
  blended_segment = {}
  for i in range(len(streams)):
    if streams[i] is not null and streams[i].segment_index == current_segment_index:
      blended_segment = blended_segment + (streams[i] * weights[i])
  return blended_segment
```

**4.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Predictive Blending:**  Use machine learning to predict future network conditions and proactively adjust blend weights.
*   **Source Diversity:**  Prioritize blend profiles that include sources from different geographical locations and infrastructure providers to improve resilience.
*   **Content-Aware Blending:**  Adjust blending strategies based on the content type (e.g., prioritize resolution for high-motion video, prioritize stability for live streams).
