## Adaptive Quorum with Predictive Re-replication

**Specification:** Implement a system where storage nodes not only maintain complete/incomplete data views but also *predict* data access patterns to proactively re-replicate data segments *before* durability is threatened. This goes beyond reactive reclamation.

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely reacting to data availability based on quorum failures or reclamation triggers, the system anticipates potential data loss based on access history and proactively re-replicates segments to nodes with lower current load and higher predicted access probability.

**Components:**

1.  **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** A distributed service monitoring data access patterns across all storage nodes.  APA collects metrics like read/write frequency, time of day access, user/application initiating access, and data segment accessed. This data is aggregated and analyzed using time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM networks). The output is a prediction of future access probability for each data segment.

2.  **Load Balancer & Predictor (LBP):** Each storage node runs an LBP component. It monitors local load (CPU, I/O, network) and combines this with the access probability predictions from the APA. The LBP calculates a "re-replication score" for each data segment *not* fully replicated on the node.  Higher scores indicate a greater need for re-replication.

3.  **Re-replication Manager (RM):** A centralized service that coordinates re-replication tasks.  It receives re-replication scores from all LBPs, prioritizes re-replication tasks based on score and available resources, and assigns tasks to appropriate storage nodes.  RM also manages conflict resolution (e.g., if multiple nodes request the same segment).

**Pseudocode (RM Task Assignment):**

```
function assign_re_replication_tasks(scores, available_nodes):
  sorted_scores = sort(scores, descending=True)  // Prioritize highest scores
  tasks = []
  for segment, score in sorted_scores:
    best_node = find_best_node(segment, available_nodes) // Considers load, proximity, existing replicas
    if best_node:
      tasks.append((segment, best_node))
      remove_node(best_node, available_nodes) //Prevent double assignment
  return tasks

function find_best_node(segment, available_nodes):
  // Score each available node based on:
  //   - Current Load
  //   - Proximity to existing replicas (reduce network latency)
  //   - Predicted Access Probability (from APA)
  //   - Capacity
  best_node = node with highest score
  return best_node
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Access Pattern Data:**  `{segment_id: {timestamp: access_count, ...}, ...}`
*   **Replication Score:** `(segment_id, score)`
*   **Node Load:**  `(node_id, cpu_load, io_load, network_load)`

**Operational Flow:**

1.  APA continuously collects access pattern data.
2.  APA generates access probability predictions.
3.  Each nodeâ€™s LBP calculates re-replication scores based on local load and predicted access.
4.  LBPs send scores to the RM.
5.  RM prioritizes tasks and assigns re-replication to nodes.
6.  Data is proactively re-replicated *before* potential durability issues arise.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond reactive reclamation by proactively re-replicating data based on *predicted* access patterns and node load. It optimizes for both durability and performance. The combination of access pattern analysis, load balancing, and predictive re-replication creates a more resilient and efficient data store. It's a step beyond simply trying to reclaim space after a failure or nearing capacity.
