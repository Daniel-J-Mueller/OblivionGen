## Hierarchical Data "Bloom" – Predictive Prefetching & Tiered Encoding

**Concept:** Leverage query patterns *across* users to proactively "bloom" hierarchical data into optimized tiers *before* a query is even received. This moves beyond reactive optimization to a predictive, multi-tiered storage structure.

**Specs:**

*   **Query Pattern Aggregator:** A service that passively monitors incoming queries (anonymized, naturally) across the entire system. This isn’t about *individual* user profiles, but aggregate trends. It identifies frequently accessed data *paths* within the hierarchical structure.  Data paths are represented as node IDs and attribute selections.

*   **Bloom Tier:** A fast, in-memory (or SSD-backed) tier dedicated to holding the *most probable* data paths identified by the Query Pattern Aggregator.  Data is stored in a highly optimized, columnar format.  This tier is small – the goal isn’t to hold *all* data, but the 95th percentile most likely access paths.

*   **Transitional Tier:** A mid-tier utilizing NVMe storage.  Data here is a larger set of probable data paths than the Bloom Tier, and represents the "next level down" in predicted access. Data encoding here utilizes a lossy compression algorithm tailored to the data type (e.g. delta encoding for time series, reduced precision floats for scientific data) to maximize storage efficiency.

*   **Archive Tier:** The existing storage system. Standard columnar storage with potentially more aggressive compression.

*   **Dynamic Tiering Engine:** This is the core of the system.
    *   **Prediction Module:** Receives data path predictions from the Query Pattern Aggregator.
    *   **Tier Assignment:**  Assigns data paths to tiers based on prediction confidence and data size. Highly confident, small data paths go to the Bloom Tier.  Less confident or large paths are routed to the Transitional or Archive tiers.
    *   **Eviction Policy:**  A Least Recently Predicted (LRP) policy determines which data paths are evicted from the Bloom and Transitional tiers as new predictions arrive.
    *   **Prefetch Scheduler:**  Initiates prefetching of data paths to the appropriate tiers *before* a query is received.

*   **Query Routing:** Incoming queries are intercepted.
    *   **Bloom Tier Check:**  First, the query checks the Bloom Tier. If all required data is present, the query is served immediately.
    *   **Transitional Tier Check:** If data is missing from the Bloom Tier, the Transitional Tier is checked.
    *   **Archive Tier Access:**  If data is missing from both tiers, access to the Archive Tier occurs.
    *   **Tier Update:**  As data is accessed, the Dynamic Tiering Engine updates predictions and adjusts tier assignments accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Tiering Engine):**

```
function processQuery(query):
  bloomData = checkBloomTier(query)
  if bloomData.complete:
    return bloomData.results

  transitionalData = checkTransitionalTier(query)
  if transitionalData.complete:
    return transitionalData.results

  archiveData = accessArchiveTier(query)
  updatePredictions(query, archiveData)
  return archiveData

function updatePredictions(query, data):
  # Analyze query and data to refine prediction model
  # Update prediction scores for relevant data paths
  # Trigger prefetching of updated data paths
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond reactive optimization. Most systems optimize data *after* a query arrives.  This system *predicts* access patterns and proactively prepares the data *before* the query is received. The tiered approach allows for balancing speed, storage cost, and prediction accuracy. The focus on aggregate patterns, rather than individual user profiles, addresses privacy concerns.
