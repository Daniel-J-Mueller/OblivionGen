## Adaptive Resonance Docking Station – Project: ‘Chameleon’

**Concept:** A docking station that physically morphs its connector interface to accommodate a wider variety of devices *without* relying solely on internal adapters. This is achieved through a network of micro-actuators and a malleable, conductive polymer surface.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Roughly cuboidal, 150mm x 100mm x 75mm. Base unit constructed of aluminum alloy (6061-T6) for rigidity and heat dissipation.
*   **Interface Surface:** Top surface covered in a layer of conductive polymer (e.g., a carbon nanotube composite with adjustable conductivity). Polymer layer thickness: 2mm. Shore hardness: 30A.
*   **Actuation System:** Beneath the conductive polymer, a grid of 10x10 (100 total) micro-actuators (piezoelectric or shape memory alloy). Actuator spacing: 10mm. Each actuator is individually addressable.
*   **Device Recognition:** Integrated miniature LiDAR or time-of-flight sensor array scans the connected device's connector profile. Resolution: 0.5mm.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M7) processes the scan data and generates actuator commands.
*   **Power Delivery:** Integrated USB-PD 3.1 controller with programmable power profiles up to 240W.
*   **Data Transfer:** USB 4.0 and Thunderbolt 4 support.
*   **Cooling:** Small internal fan and heat pipes to dissipate heat generated by power delivery and data transfer.
*   **Software Interface:** Companion application for customization and firmware updates.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialisation
scanForDevice()
determineConnectorType()

// Main Loop
while (deviceConnected) {
    readDeviceRequirements() // Power, data protocol, physical dimensions
    adjustActuators(deviceRequirements) // Morph polymer surface to match
    establishConnection()
    monitorConnection() // Continuously monitor for signal degradation/disconnection
    if (signalDegradation) {
        fineTuneActuators() //Micro-adjust actuators for optimal connection
    }
}
```

**Actuator Adjustment Algorithm:**

1.  **Scan:** LiDAR/ToF sensor scans the device's connector.
2.  **Mapping:**  Scan data is mapped to the actuator grid.
3.  **Calculation:** Algorithm calculates the required displacement for each actuator to conform to the connector shape. This utilizes a finite element analysis (FEA) model of the conductive polymer.
4.  **Execution:** Microcontroller sends commands to actuators.
5.  **Feedback:**  Integrated current sensors monitor conductivity and adjust actuators for optimal contact.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuous monitoring and adjustment based on connection stability.

**Potential Materials:**

*   Conductive Polymer: Carbon nanotube composite with varying concentration for adjustable conductivity.
*   Actuators: Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) piezoelectric actuators or shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators.
*   Housing: Aluminum alloy 6061-T6 for heat dissipation and structural rigidity.
*   Connectors: High-quality USB-C, Thunderbolt 4, and potentially proprietary connectors for future compatibility.
