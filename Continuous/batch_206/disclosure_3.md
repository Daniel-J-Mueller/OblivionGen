**Dynamic Foveated Rendering with Predictive Auditory Occlusion**

**Concept:** Extend foveated rendering beyond visual cues by incorporating predicted auditory occlusion to dynamically adjust rendering priority. This creates a more realistic and efficient experience, focusing computational resources where the user *will* likely be looking and listening.

**Specs:**

1.  **Audio Source Mapping & Propagation:**
    *   System maintains a 3D map of all active audio sources within the VR/AR environment.
    *   Raycasting performed from each audio source to simulate sound propagation.
    *   Obstacles in the environment (virtual objects, walls, user’s own body) are identified along these rays.
    *   Attenuation factors calculated based on material properties and distance.
    *   Binaural audio processing simulates realistic sound localization and occlusion.

2.  **Predictive Occlusion Modeling:**
    *   Utilize user head/body tracking data to predict future audio occlusion.
    *   Machine learning model (trained on user movement patterns & environment geometry) predicts which objects will likely obstruct sound before they visually obstruct the user’s view.
    *   Prediction horizon: 200-500ms.
    *   Confidence score assigned to each prediction, indicating the likelihood of actual occlusion.

3.  **Dynamic Rendering Priority Adjustment:**
    *   Combine visual foveation data (eye tracking, gaze prediction) with auditory occlusion predictions.
    *   Rendering priority assigned to individual scene elements based on:
        *   Visual prominence (gaze direction, object size, contrast).
        *   Auditory prominence (sound intensity, direction, predicted occlusion).
    *   Higher priority elements receive more detailed rendering (higher resolution textures, increased polygon count, more complex shaders).
    *   Lower priority elements receive reduced rendering detail (lower resolution textures, simplified geometry, basic shaders).
    *   Priority map updated every frame based on tracking data and predictions.

4.  **Rendering Pipeline Integration:**
    *   Custom shader system capable of dynamically adjusting rendering parameters based on priority.
    *   Multi-resolution texture streaming to efficiently manage texture memory.
    *   Level-of-detail (LOD) selection algorithm based on priority and distance.
    *   Shader allows for dynamic adjustment of number of light bounces/ray tracing depth based on priority, saving computational costs.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Every Frame

// 1. Update Audio Scene
UpdateAudioScene(audioSources, environmentGeometry);

// 2. Predict Audio Occlusion
occlusionPredictions = PredictAudioOcclusion(audioSources, userTrackingData, environmentGeometry);

// 3. Calculate Rendering Priority
priorityMap = CalculateRenderingPriority(visualFoveationData, occlusionPredictions, sceneElements);

// 4. Render Scene
RenderScene(sceneElements, priorityMap);
```

**Example:**

User is walking towards a virtual door. A conversation is happening *behind* the door.

*   Visual Foveation: User's gaze is focused on the door.
*   Audio Occlusion Prediction: System predicts the door will soon occlude the conversation.
*   Rendering Priority: System prioritizes rendering the door in high detail, while reducing detail of the area *behind* the door.  As the user opens the door, priority dynamically shifts.

**Potential benefits:**

*   Increased rendering efficiency.
*   Enhanced realism through improved audio-visual synchronization.
*   Reduced latency.
*   More immersive VR/AR experiences.
