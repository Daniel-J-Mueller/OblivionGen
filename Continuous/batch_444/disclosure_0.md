## Personalized Sensory Augmentation via Telephony

**Concept:** Expand the telephony interaction beyond audio to incorporate subtle sensory stimuli delivered *through* the phone itself, personalized to the respondent's profile and the query's subject matter, creating a more immersive and impactful experience. This builds on the respondent profiling established in the patent, but moves beyond simply selecting respondents, to actively modulating *their experience* during the query.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Modified telephony device (smartphone or dedicated hardware) with integrated micro-haptic actuators, scent diffusion module, and subtle temperature control. The phone itself becomes a multi-sensory output device.
*   **Software – Core Module:**
    *   **Sensory Profile Generation:** Builds on existing respondent profiling, adding data points related to sensory preferences (e.g., preferred scents, textures, temperature ranges) and potential sensitivities. This data is gathered through optional onboarding questionnaires and inferred from existing behavioral data.
    *   **Query-Sensory Mapping:** AI module maps query content (identified via NLP) to appropriate sensory stimuli. For example:
        *   A query about a tropical fruit might trigger a subtle scent of pineapple and a slight warming of the phone’s surface.
        *   A query about a rough terrain vehicle might trigger a subtle haptic texture mimicking gravel.
        *   A query about a calming meditation app might trigger a cool temperature, lavender scent, and a slow, pulsing haptic rhythm.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Real-time monitoring of respondent’s physiological responses (using phone’s existing sensors like accelerometer, microphone for vocal stress analysis) to adjust sensory output. If stress is detected, stimuli is reduced or removed.
    *   **Personalization Engine:**  Learns respondent’s preferences over time, refining the sensory mapping for future queries.
*   **Software - API & Integration:**
    *   API for query creators to define desired sensory profiles for their queries. This allows for precise control over the experience.
    *   Seamless integration with existing query platform.
*   **Pseudocode (Sensory Stimulus Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    1. Receive Query Data (text, categories, etc.)
    2. Analyze Query Data using NLP -> Identify Relevant Sensory Themes
    3. Retrieve Respondent Profile (including Sensory Preferences)
    4. Generate Sensory Stimulus Profile (based on Query Themes & Respondent Profile)
    5. Activate Sensory Actuators (haptics, scent, temperature) according to Stimulus Profile
    6. Monitor Respondent Physiological Data (Accelerometer, Mic Stress)
    7. IF Stress Detected: Reduce/Remove Sensory Stimuli
    8. Continue monitoring & adjusting stimuli throughout query duration
    9. Log Respondent Response & Physiological Data for Learning
ENDLOOP
```

*   **Future Expansion:** Integration with AR/VR technologies for more immersive experiences, and personalized scent blending to create unique olfactory profiles. Development of an 'emotional feedback' system, utilizing respondent's vocal and physiological data to dynamically alter the sensory environment, creating a truly responsive and personalized query experience.
