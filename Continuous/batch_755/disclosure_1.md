## Adaptive Propeller Bio-Mimicry - 'Fin Ray' Propulsion

**Concept:**  Instead of segmented, pivoting propeller blades, create a propeller blade that mimics the fin rays of a fish. This leverages inherent flexibility and allows for complex airfoil shaping *without* discrete moving parts, reducing mechanical complexity and potential failure points.  The inspiration comes from observing how fish achieve nuanced control over thrust and drag using minimal muscular effort â€“ bending and flexing entire fins.

**Specs:**

*   **Blade Material:**  A composite material combining a flexible polymer backbone (e.g., TPU or a similar elastomer) with embedded shape memory alloy (SMA) wires running the length of the blade. These SMA wires act as 'muscles', contracting/expanding upon electrical stimulation.  The outer skin will be a durable, waterproof coating (e.g., polyurethane).
*   **Blade Structure:**  The blade is not a solid sheet.  It consists of a series of interconnected 'cells' or segments arranged along the blade length. These cells are defined by flexible membranes. Think of a very flat, elongated honeycomb.
*   **'Muscles' (SMA Wiring):**  Each cell contains a network of SMA wires running in multiple directions.  Precise control of current to these wires allows for localized bending and shaping of the cell.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller manages the current flow to each SMA wire network. Input parameters include desired thrust, yaw, and pitch adjustments.  A learning algorithm optimizes the SMA activation patterns for maximum efficiency.
*   **Hub Integration:** The propeller hub will incorporate slip rings to provide electrical power and control signals to the rotating blades.
*   **Sensor Suite:**  Each blade integrates micro-sensors (strain gauges, accelerometers) providing real-time feedback on blade deformation and aerodynamic forces. This data feeds back into the control system for closed-loop performance optimization.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Logic):**

```
// Input: desired_thrust, desired_yaw, desired_pitch
// Output: SMA_activation_pattern (array of current values for each SMA wire network)

function calculate_activation_pattern(desired_thrust, desired_yaw, desired_pitch):

    // 1. Baseline activation for desired thrust
    baseline_pattern = calculate_baseline_thrust_pattern(desired_thrust)

    // 2. Yaw correction:  Asymmetrically bend trailing edges of blades
    yaw_offset = calculate_yaw_offset(desired_yaw)
    apply_yaw_offset(baseline_pattern, yaw_offset)

    // 3. Pitch correction: Adjust camber along blade length
    pitch_offset = calculate_pitch_offset(desired_pitch)
    apply_pitch_offset(baseline_pattern, pitch_offset)

    // 4. Sensor feedback integration
    sensor_data = read_blade_sensors()
    refined_pattern = refine_pattern_with_feedback(refined_pattern, sensor_data)

    return refined_pattern
```

**Refinements/Future Work:**

*   **Bio-inspired Skin:** Explore textures and coatings that mimic shark skin to reduce drag.
*   **Energy Harvesting:** Integrate piezoelectric materials into the blade structure to harvest energy from vibrations and airflow.
*   **Modular Design:** Allow individual blade sections to be replaced or repaired without disassembling the entire propeller.
*   **AI-driven Optimization:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the propeller to adapt its shape in real-time based on environmental conditions and flight dynamics.
