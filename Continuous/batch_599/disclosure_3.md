## Dynamic Network Slice Orchestration via Intent-Based Routing

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic routing capabilities to facilitate automated creation and management of network slices tailored to specific application needs, leveraging a higher-level "intent" definition from the client.

**Specification:**

**1. Intent Definition:**

*   **Data Structure:** A JSON-based intent definition will be exposed via the programmatic interface.
    ```json
    {
      "slice_name": "video_streaming",
      "qos_profile": "high_bandwidth_low_latency",
      "security_profile": "isolated_segment",
      "geographic_constraints": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"],
      "applications": ["video_player", "streaming_server"],
      "priority": "critical"
    }
    ```
*   **API Endpoint:**  `/api/v1/slices` (POST to create, GET to retrieve status, DELETE to remove).

**2. Routing Policy Generation:**

*   **Intent Parser:** A dedicated module will parse the intent definition, translating high-level requirements into concrete routing policies.
*   **Policy Templates:** Utilize pre-defined policy templates for common QoS, security, and geographic constraints.  These templates will contain BGP attribute configurations, CIDR block assignments, and filter rules.
*   **Dynamic Policy Composition:**  Combine and modify policy templates based on the specific intent definition.  For example:
    *   `QoS = bandwidth(100Mbps) + latency(50ms)`
    *   `Security = isolate(video_streaming_slice)`
    *   `Geo = constrain(us-east-1, us-west-2)`
*   **BGP Attribute Manipulation:** Generate a set of BGP attributes (local preference, AS path prepending, community tags) to enforce the desired routing behavior.

**3. Virtual Router Integration:**

*   **Policy Push:** The generated routing policies (BGP attribute sets and filter rules) will be dynamically pushed to the virtual routers (first and second virtual router mentioned in the patent).
*   **Control Plane Interaction:** Utilize a dedicated control plane protocol (e.g., NETCONF/YANG) to configure the virtual routers.
*   **Policy Validation:** Implement a mechanism to validate the policy configuration on the virtual routers.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Track the performance of the network slice using metrics such as bandwidth utilization, latency, and packet loss.

**4. Network Slice Lifecycle Management:**

*   **Automated Creation:** Upon receiving a slice creation request, the system will automatically configure the virtual routers and establish the necessary routing policies.
*   **Dynamic Scaling:**  Monitor the load on the network slice and dynamically adjust the bandwidth allocation and routing policies to meet the demand.
*   **Automated Removal:** Upon receiving a slice removal request, the system will automatically remove the routing policies and deallocate the resources.

**Pseudocode (Slice Creation):**

```
function create_slice(intent_definition):
  policy = parse_intent(intent_definition)
  router1_config = generate_router_config(policy)
  router2_config = generate_router_config(policy)
  push_config_to_router(router1, router1_config)
  push_config_to_router(router2, router2_config)
  validate_config(router1, router1_config)
  validate_config(router2, router2_config)
  monitor_slice_performance(intent_definition.slice_name)
  return success
```

**Innovation:**  This extends dynamic routing beyond simply facilitating connectivity between isolated networks. It introduces intent-based networking, allowing clients to define desired network characteristics (QoS, security, geography) and the system to automatically configure the network to meet those requirements.  This enables rapid provisioning of customized network slices, simplifying network management and optimizing application performance.
