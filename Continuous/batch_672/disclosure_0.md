## Dynamic I/O Shadowing & Replay

**Concept:** Extend the I/O proxy functionality to not only filter but also *shadow* and *replay* I/O operations for debugging, performance analysis, and automated testing.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:**  Shadowing Module integrated within existing I/O Proxy Device. Requires additional persistent storage (local SSD or network share) for shadow data.
*   **Configuration:**  Admin interface (API/GUI) to define shadowing policies. Policies specify:
    *   **Target Volumes/Files:**  Volumes or specific files to be shadowed.
    *   **Shadowing Mode:**
        *   *Full Shadow:* Capture all I/O operations.
        *   *Filtered Shadow:* Capture I/O based on criteria (user, application, file type, etc.).
        *   *Error-Based Shadow:*  Capture I/O operations resulting in errors.
    *   **Shadow Data Retention:** Time-based or size-based retention policy.
    *   **Replay Speed Control:**  Ability to replay shadowed I/O at varying speeds (slow, normal, fast).
*   **Data Format:** I/O data captured as a standardized, timestamped log of:
    *   I/O Type (Read/Write)
    *   Source/Destination Address
    *   Data Size
    *   Data Payload (Optional, configurable per policy - risk of large storage requirements)
    *   Metadata (User, Application, etc.)
*   **Replay Engine:**  Component capable of replaying captured I/O data to the original storage device or to a staging environment.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /shadowing/policy`: Create a new shadowing policy.
    *   `GET /shadowing/policy/{id}`: Retrieve a shadowing policy.
    *   `PUT /shadowing/policy/{id}`: Update a shadowing policy.
    *   `DELETE /shadowing/policy/{id}`: Delete a shadowing policy.
    *   `POST /shadowing/replay/{id}`: Start replaying captured I/O data.
    *   `GET /shadowing/status/{id}`: Get the status of a replay operation.

**Pseudocode (Replay Engine):**

```
function replayIOLog(logFile, targetDevice, speedFactor):
  log = loadIOLog(logFile)
  for ioEntry in log:
    currentTime = ioEntry.timestamp
    delay = (currentTime - lastTime) * speedFactor
    sleep(delay)

    if ioEntry.type == "READ":
      data = readFromTarget(targetDevice, ioEntry.address, ioEntry.size)
    else if ioEntry.type == "WRITE":
      writeToTarget(targetDevice, ioEntry.address, ioEntry.size, ioEntry.data)
    lastTime = currentTime

  return success
```

**Potential Uses:**

*   **Root Cause Analysis:**  Replay I/O leading up to a system failure.
*   **Performance Optimization:**  Identify I/O bottlenecks.
*   **Automated Testing:**  Validate storage system functionality.
*   **Security Auditing:** Monitor I/O patterns for suspicious activity.
