## Adaptive Policy Inheritance & Conflict Resolution System

**Concept:** Extend the existing identity & access management to allow for *dynamic* policy inheritance across nested accounts and service entities, coupled with an AI-driven conflict resolution engine. This goes beyond simple policy application and enables a system that *learns* from policy conflicts and adapts inheritance rules accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Account & Entity Graph:**

*   Establish a directed graph representing the relationships between accounts, service entities (applications, databases, etc.), and users.  
*   Nodes: Account, Service Entity, User.
*   Edges:  "Manages," "Uses," "InheritsPolicyFrom".
*   Each node will have associated metadata including security context, resource usage, and policy tags.

**2. Policy Tagging System:**

*   Policies are no longer monolithic blocks. They are broken down into granular, tagged statements (e.g., “Allow Read:DataSensitivity:Low”, “Deny Write:Resource:Critical”).
*   Tags will categorize policy statements based on resource, action, data sensitivity, compliance requirements, etc.
*   Tags will be machine-readable and facilitate automated policy analysis.

**3. Dynamic Inheritance Engine:**

*   A service continuously monitors the Account & Entity Graph for changes (new accounts, users added/removed, service deployments).
*   Based on the graph relationships, the engine determines the applicable policies for each entity.
*   Policies are inherited *transitively* – an entity inherits policies from its parent, its parent’s parent, and so on.
*   Inheritance weights can be assigned to each edge in the graph to prioritize policies from certain parents. (e.g., a ‘Critical Systems’ account parent will have a higher weight).

**4. Conflict Detection & Resolution (AI-Driven):**

*   Whenever conflicting policies are detected for an entity, the system triggers an AI-powered conflict resolution engine.
*   **AI Model:** Train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model.
    *   **State:**  The set of conflicting policy statements, entity metadata, graph context (parent/child relationships), and compliance requirements.
    *   **Actions:**  A set of resolution strategies:
        *   *Precedence:*  Apply a pre-defined precedence rule (e.g., stricter policy wins).
        *   *Override:*  Override the conflicting policy with a more specific policy.
        *   *Merge:*  Combine the policies into a single, unified policy. (Requires careful analysis to avoid unintended consequences.)
        *   *Escalate:* Flag the conflict for human review.
    *   **Reward:** The reward function will be based on several factors:
        *   *Compliance:*  Ensuring that the resolved policy meets all applicable compliance requirements.
        *   *Security:*  Minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
        *   *Least Privilege:*  Granting only the necessary permissions.
        *   *User Experience:* Minimizing disruption to user access.
*   The RL model will learn over time to select the optimal resolution strategy for each conflict.

**5. Adaptive Inheritance Rules:**

*   Based on the outcomes of the conflict resolution process, the system will automatically adjust the inheritance rules.
*   For example, if the RL model consistently resolves conflicts in a certain way, the system may create a new inheritance rule to prevent similar conflicts from occurring in the future.
*   This creates a self-learning and adaptive access control system.

**Pseudocode (Conflict Resolution Engine):**

```
function resolveConflict(conflictingPolicies, entityMetadata, graphContext):
  state = createState(conflictingPolicies, entityMetadata, graphContext)
  action = aiModel.selectAction(state) // RL model selects an action
  resolvedPolicy = applyAction(action, conflictingPolicies)
  reward = calculateReward(resolvedPolicy, entityMetadata, graphContext)
  aiModel.updateModel(state, action, reward) // Update RL model
  return resolvedPolicy
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Policy Statement:** {Resource: string, Action: string, Condition: string, Tags: array}
*   **Entity:** {ID: string, Type: string, Metadata: object}
*   **Graph Edge:** {Source: string, Target: string, Weight: float}

This system moves beyond static access control toward a dynamic and intelligent system capable of adapting to changing security requirements and organizational structures.
