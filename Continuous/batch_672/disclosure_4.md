## Dynamic Projection Mapping Clock – “Aura”

**Concept:** Expand the clock face beyond physical limitations using projection mapping onto surrounding surfaces to create an immersive, contextually aware time display.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Ultra-short-throw projector (UST) embedded within a clock housing. Resolution: 4K minimum. Brightness: 2000 lumens.
    *   Wide-angle camera integrated into the clock housing for environment mapping and user detection.
    *   Depth sensor (ToF or structured light) for accurate surface detection and dynamic projection adjustment.
    *   Microphone array for voice control and ambient sound analysis.
    *   Edge computing module (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 or similar) for on-device processing.
    *   Connectivity: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2.
*   **Software:**
    *   Real-time environment mapping engine. Algorithm: SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) or similar.
    *   Projection warping and blending algorithms for seamless image distortion.
    *   Contextual awareness engine. Integrates time, calendar data, location, and sensor input.
    *   User interface (UI) driven by voice commands and gesture recognition.
    *   API for integration with third-party services (calendar, weather, news, smart home).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Core Time Display:** Projects traditional clock face onto a nearby wall or surface. User configurable projection size and positioning.
    *   **Dynamic Projection Mapping:** Adapts the projected clock face and surrounding visuals to the environment.
        *   **Surface Awareness:** Corrects projection based on surface texture, angles, and obstructions.
        *   **Object Interaction:** Projects visuals *around* objects in the room (furniture, plants, etc.).
        *   **Immersive Visuals:** Projects animated backgrounds, weather patterns, or abstract art to complement the time display.
    *   **Contextual Information Layer:** Overlays relevant information on top of the clock face or surrounding projection area.
        *   **Calendar Integration:** Displays upcoming appointments or events directly on the clock face.
        *   **Weather Information:** Displays current weather conditions and forecast.
        *   **News Headlines:** Displays scrolling news headlines.
        *   **Smart Home Control:** Displays smart home device status and allows for voice-controlled actions.
    *   **User Personalization:**
        *   **Customizable Themes:** Allows users to select from a library of pre-designed themes or create their own.
        *   **Gesture Control:** Allows users to control the clock and its features with hand gestures.
        *   **Voice Control:** Allows users to control the clock and its features with voice commands.
        *   **Ambient Lighting Synchronization:** Synchronizes the projection colors and intensity with ambient lighting conditions.

**Pseudocode – Contextual Information Layer Update:**

```
function updateContextualLayer() {
  currentTime = getCurrentTime();
  calendarEvents = getCalendarEvents(currentTime);
  weatherData = getWeatherInfo();
  newsHeadlines = getNewsHeadlines();

  if (calendarEvents.length > 0) {
    displayEventOnClock(calendarEvents[0], clockFace);
  }

  if (weatherData != null) {
    displayWeatherIcon(weatherData.icon, clockFace);
    displayTemperature(weatherData.temperature, clockFace);
  }

  if (newsHeadlines.length > 0) {
    displayNewsHeadline(newsHeadlines[0], projectionArea); //Separate area around the clock
  }
}

//Execute this function on a timer (e.g., every minute)
setInterval(updateContextualLayer, 60000);
```

**Novelty:**

This concept moves beyond simply displaying time on a clock face. It transforms the surrounding environment into an extension of the clock, creating a dynamic, immersive, and informative experience. The use of projection mapping, combined with contextual awareness and user personalization, differentiates it from existing time display solutions.
