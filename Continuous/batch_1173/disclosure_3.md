## Dynamic Content Insertion via Generative AI

**Concept:** Leverage identified static content portions not as errors to *correct*, but as opportunities to dynamically insert generated content, creating a personalized or contextually relevant viewing experience. This moves beyond simply replacing static segments and into a realm of augmenting the existing content.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Integration:** Integrate a Generative AI Module (GAIM) into the existing video analysis pipeline *after* static content detection. The GAIM will be responsible for content generation.
*   **Static Segment Analysis:** Upon detection of a static segment (as per the existing patent), the system extracts metadata about the segment – duration, preceding/following scene context (determined via scene detection algorithms), audio characteristics, dominant colors, and identified objects/entities.
*   **Prompt Generation:** Based on the extracted metadata, a prompt is constructed for the GAIM. The prompt aims to guide the AI in generating content that seamlessly integrates with the existing video. Example: "Generate a 5-second animated sequence featuring a [dominant color] [identified object] that complements the preceding scene's emotional tone." The emotional tone can be derived from audio analysis and/or object/scene understanding.
*   **Content Generation:** The GAIM receives the prompt and generates a video segment. The GAIM should support multiple generation modes – animation, realistic video, abstract visual effects, etc. – selectable based on user preference or content type.
*   **Seamless Integration:** The generated segment is seamlessly spliced into the original video, replacing the static content. Advanced blending and transition effects are applied to ensure smooth visual flow. Audio levels are adjusted to match.
*   **Personalization:** User profiles are leveraged to personalize the generated content. For example, if a user is known to enjoy a particular genre or artist, the generated content can be themed accordingly.
*   **Real-time Generation:** For live streams or on-demand content, the system should be capable of generating content in near real-time, minimizing latency.
*   **User Control:** Allow users to control the level of dynamic content insertion. Options could include: "Off", "Subtle", "Moderate", "Aggressive".
*   **AI Training Data:** The system will collect data on user engagement with dynamically inserted content to refine the AI's content generation algorithms.



**Pseudocode:**

```
function processVideo(video):
  segments = detectStaticContent(video)
  for segment in segments:
    metadata = extractMetadata(segment)
    prompt = generatePrompt(metadata)
    generatedContent = generateAIContent(prompt)
    integratedVideo = spliceContent(video, segment, generatedContent)
  return integratedVideo
```
