## Adaptive Filesystem Sharding with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the filesystem proxy concept to dynamically shard client filesystems across multiple proxy servers based on access patterns, coupled with a predictive prefetching mechanism that anticipates data needs and proactively stages data closer to the virtual machine. This aims to reduce latency, increase throughput, and improve scalability beyond what a single proxy server can achieve.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sharding Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Client filesystem metadata (directory structure, file sizes, modification times), access logs (files accessed, access frequency, access times), VM resource allocation (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
*   **Process:**
    *   Filesystem represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
    *   Node weight: Access frequency * File size.
    *   Edge weight: Access latency between files.
    *   Graph partitioning algorithm (e.g., METIS, spectral clustering) used to divide the graph into shards.
    *   Shards assigned to available proxy servers. Assignment prioritizes minimizing inter-shard communication.
    *   Dynamic re-sharding triggered by significant changes in access patterns or proxy server load.
*   **Output:** Shard assignment map (file/directory -> proxy server ID).

**2. Proxy Server Communication:**

*   **Inter-Proxy Protocol:**  Lightweight RPC protocol for requesting and transferring data between proxy servers.
*   **Data Consistency:** Use optimistic locking with version numbers to handle concurrent access and updates. Conflicts resolved by reverting to the last known good version.
*   **Metadata Synchronization:**  Proxy servers maintain a consistent view of the filesystem metadata using a distributed hash table (DHT) or a consistent key-value store.

**3. Predictive Prefetching:**

*   **Access Pattern Analysis:**  Machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) trained on historical access logs to predict future file accesses.
*   **Prediction Confidence:** Model provides a confidence score for each prediction.
*   **Prefetching Trigger:** Prefetch initiated if prediction confidence exceeds a threshold.
*   **Prefetch Destination:** Data prefetched to the proxy server serving the VM, or a dedicated caching layer.
*   **Prefetch Prioritization:** Prefetch requests prioritized based on prediction confidence, file size, and estimated access time.

**4. VM Integration:**

*   **Filesystem Virtualization:** VM sees a unified filesystem view, transparently accessing data from multiple proxy servers.
*   **Data Locality Optimization:** Filesystem driver prioritizes accessing data from the local proxy server whenever possible.
*   **Caching Layer:** VM maintains a local cache to reduce latency for frequently accessed data.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Logic - executed on the Proxy Server):**

```
function prefetch_file(file_path):
  access_pattern = analyze_access_logs() // Returns likely next files
  prediction = access_pattern.predict_next_file(file_path)

  if prediction.confidence > PREFETCH_THRESHOLD:
    if file_exists(file_path):
      // Fetch file from remote filesystem
      file_data = fetch_file(file_path)
      // Store file in local cache
      cache_file(file_path, file_data)
      log("Prefetched " + file_path)
    else:
      log("File not found: " + file_path)

```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multiple Proxy Servers (scale horizontally).
*   High-bandwidth network connectivity between proxy servers and VMs.
*   Sufficient storage capacity on each proxy server to accommodate cached data.
*   Fast storage media (e.g., SSDs) for low-latency access.

**6. Software Stack:**

*   Operating System: Linux
*   Programming Languages: Python, C++, Go
*   Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow, PyTorch
*   Distributed Key-Value Store: Redis, etcd
*   RPC Framework: gRPC, Thrift
