## Dynamic Zone Prioritization & Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply avoiding a mobile entity. Implement a system that *prioritizes* zones within the facility based on predicted entity movement and dynamically buffers mobile drive unit (MDU) paths to optimize overall throughput *while* maintaining safety. This goes beyond reactive avoidance to proactive flow management.

**Specs:**

*   **Zone Map:** Maintain a high-resolution zone map of the facility, segmented not just by physical layout, but also by historical and predicted traffic density. Zones are tagged with “priority” levels (High, Medium, Low) adjustable in real-time.
*   **Predictive Entity Modeling:** Implement a Kalman filter or similar predictive algorithm to forecast the entity's (and assigned mobile location unit's) trajectory based on current speed, direction, historical paths, and known destination (if available). Update prediction every 50ms.
*   **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:** The system continuously adjusts zone priorities based on predicted entity movement. Zones along the predicted path receive increased priority (e.g., from Low to Medium, or Medium to High).  Priority decays over time if the entity deviates from the prediction.
*   **Buffering Algorithm:** MDUs are not simply rerouted *around* the entity. Instead, a buffering algorithm temporarily *slows* or *holds* MDUs approaching higher-priority zones. This creates a “cushion” around the entity, preventing congestion and ensuring smooth flow.
    *   MDUs are assigned a ‘hold time’ based on distance to the prioritized zone and predicted entity arrival time.
    *   Holding MDUs utilize onboard sensors to maintain safe distances from each other and the buffered zone.
*   **Communication Protocol:** MDUs, mobile location units, and the central computing device communicate via a low-latency, high-bandwidth wireless protocol (e.g., 802.11ax or 5G). Critical data (position, speed, hold time) is broadcast at a frequency of 20Hz.
*   **User Interface (UI):**  A visual UI displays the facility layout, MDU positions, predicted entity path, zone priorities, and MDU hold times.  Administrators can manually override zone priorities or MDU hold times if needed.

**Pseudocode (Buffering Algorithm):**

```
// For each MDU:
function bufferMDU(mdu, entityPrediction, zoneMap) {
    // Calculate distance to prioritized zone
    distance = calculateDistance(mdu.location, zoneMap.location)

    // Calculate time to arrival at prioritized zone (based on current speed)
    timeToArrival = distance / mdu.speed

    // Calculate predicted entity arrival time
    entityArrivalTime = entityPrediction.arrivalTime

    // Calculate hold time
    if (timeToArrival < entityArrivalTime) {
        holdTime = entityArrivalTime - timeToArrival
    } else {
        holdTime = 0
    }

    // If hold time > 0, send instruction to decelerate
    if (holdTime > 0) {
        sendDecelerationInstruction(mdu, holdTime)
    } else {
        // Continue on current path
    }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Enhanced access point network (higher density, lower latency).
*   MDUs equipped with high-precision positioning sensors (e.g., LiDAR, UWB).
*   Powerful central computing device with GPU acceleration for predictive modeling.
*   Real-time operating system (RTOS) on MDUs for precise control.
