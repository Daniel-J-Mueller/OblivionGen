## Bistable Cell Array for Probabilistic Computing

**Concept:** Expand the bistable cell concept beyond random number generation into a probabilistic computing fabric. Instead of solely relying on random outputs, engineer an array of interconnected bistable cells where the probability of each cell settling into a particular state is *controllable and programmable*. This allows the system to perform computations based on probabilities, rather than strict boolean logic.

**Specs:**

*   **Cell Type:** Modified bistable cell based on the provided patent’s core architecture (inverters, tristate buffers). Crucially, add digitally controlled resistors in series with the tristate buffer control lines. These resistors will determine the strength of the control signal, influencing the probability of the buffer being active or high impedance.
*   **Array Topology:** 2D grid arrangement of these modified bistable cells. Grid size is programmable (e.g., 8x8, 16x16).
*   **Interconnect:** Each cell connects to its immediate neighbors (North, South, East, West).  Connections are bidirectional, allowing signal propagation in either direction.
*   **Programmability:** A dedicated controller provides the following programmability features:
    *   **Individual Cell Control:** Set the resistance value for each cell’s tristate buffer control lines, individually tuning the probability of settling to 0 or 1.  Resistance range: 10 Ohms to 10k Ohms (digital control – e.g. 10-bit resolution).
    *   **Neighbor Weighting:** Assign weights to neighboring cells' influence on a central cell.  This allows for complex probabilistic relationships. (e.g., Cell A influences Cell B with 70% probability, Cell C with 30%).
    *   **Global Bias:** Apply a global bias to the entire array, shifting the overall probability distribution.
*   **Input/Output:**
    *   **Input Cells:** Designated cells along the array edges act as input.  Apply a voltage to an input cell to represent a ‘1’ or ‘0’. Input cells override the probabilistic behavior, forcing a defined state.
    *   **Output Cells:** Designated cells along the array edges act as output. Read the voltage level of output cells to determine the probabilistic result of the computation.
*   **Clocking:** Synchronous operation. A global clock signal governs state transitions within the array.
*   **Power:** 3.3V operation.

**Pseudocode Example: Probabilistic AND gate implemented in the array**

```pseudocode
// Assume a 4x4 array. Cells (0,0) and (0,1) are inputs. Cell (0,2) is the output.

// 1. Initialize all cells to a default resistance (e.g., 500 Ohms)
// 2. Input (0,0) = 1: Set resistance of (0,0) to 0 Ohms.
// 3. Input (0,1) = 1: Set resistance of (0,1) to 0 Ohms.
// 4. Configure Neighbor Weights:
//    - Cell (0,0) influences Cell (0,2) with 50%
//    - Cell (0,1) influences Cell (0,2) with 50%
// 5. Run the array for 'N' clock cycles.
// 6. Read the voltage level of Cell (0,2).
//    - If voltage > threshold, output = 1 (high probability).
//    - If voltage < threshold, output = 0 (low probability).
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Approximate Computing:** Execute tasks requiring high throughput but tolerating some errors (e.g., image processing, machine learning).
*   **Optimization Problems:** Find near-optimal solutions to complex problems where exhaustive search is impractical.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Implement parallel Monte Carlo simulations for scientific modeling.
*   **Neuromorphic Computing:** Emulate biological neural networks.
