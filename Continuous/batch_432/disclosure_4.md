## Adaptive Model Composition via Reinforcement Learning

**Specification:** A system for dynamically composing and optimizing ML inference applications based on real-time performance feedback, leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). This builds upon the concept of orchestrating models and transformations but introduces a learning agent to *automatically* discover optimal workflows.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Environment:** The provider network, including access to available ML models, data transformation operations, and computational resources.  The environment provides feedback (reward/penalty) based on the performance of a deployed application. Performance metrics include latency, cost, accuracy, and resource utilization.

2.  **Agent:** A Reinforcement Learning agent (e.g., a Deep Q-Network or a Policy Gradient method).  This agentâ€™s state space represents the current composition of the inference application (e.g., a sequence of models and transformations). The action space consists of operations to modify the composition:
    *   *Add Model*: Selects and adds a new ML model from the available catalog.
    *   *Remove Model*: Removes an existing model from the composition.
    *   *Swap Model*: Replaces one model with another.
    *   *Add Transformation*: Adds a data transformation operation.
    *   *Remove Transformation*: Removes a data transformation operation.
    *   *Reorder Operations*: Changes the order of models and transformations.

3.  **Reward Function:**  A configurable function that assigns a reward/penalty based on the performance metrics.  This could be a weighted sum of latency, cost, and accuracy.  The reward function is critical for guiding the learning process.  For instance:

    `Reward = w1 * Accuracy - w2 * Latency - w3 * Cost`

    Where `w1`, `w2`, and `w3` are configurable weights.

4.  **Model Repository:** A catalog of available ML models and data transformation operations, along with metadata (e.g., input/output data types, performance characteristics, cost).

5.  **Deployment Engine:** Responsible for deploying and executing the composed inference application in the provider network.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:** The RL agent starts with a randomly initialized inference application composition (e.g., a single model).
2.  **Exploration & Exploitation:** The agent explores different application compositions by taking actions (adding/removing/reordering models/transformations).  A balance between exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (using what it already knows) is maintained using techniques like epsilon-greedy or softmax action selection.
3.  **Evaluation:**  The deployed application is evaluated based on a set of representative input data. Performance metrics are collected.
4.  **Reward Calculation:**  The reward function calculates a reward based on the performance metrics.
5.  **Learning:** The RL agent updates its policy based on the reward.  This involves adjusting the probabilities of taking different actions in different states.
6.  **Iteration:** Steps 3-5 are repeated for a large number of iterations.  Over time, the agent learns to compose inference applications that maximize the reward.

**Pseudocode (Agent Update):**

```python
# Assume state is a representation of the current application composition
# Assume action is the operation to perform (add/remove/swap model, etc.)

def update_agent(state, action, reward, next_state):
    # Q-Learning Example
    Q(state, action) = Q(state, action) + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * max(Q(next_state, a)) - Q(state, action))
    # (Alternatively, use Policy Gradient methods for continuous action spaces)
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

*   **Automated Optimization:**  Automatically discovers optimal inference application compositions without manual tuning.
*   **Adaptability:** Adapts to changing data distributions and evolving model catalogs.
*   **Cost Efficiency:**  Optimizes for both performance and cost.
*   **Dynamic Composition:** Allows for dynamic composition of inference applications in real-time.
*   **Exploration of Complex Workflows:** Facilitates the exploration of complex workflows that might not be considered by human designers.
