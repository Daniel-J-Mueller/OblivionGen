**Adaptive Content 'Buds' with Predictive Delivery**

**Concept:** Extend the idea of delivering content to multiple devices, but introduce a concept of 'content buds' - small, AI-driven agents that *reside* on destination devices. These buds proactively anticipate user needs and pre-fetch/prepare content *before* explicit requests. This shifts from reactive delivery to predictive anticipation, increasing perceived responsiveness and reducing latency.

**Specs:**

*   **Bud Architecture:** Lightweight software agents installed on user devices (phones, tablets, smart TVs, etc.). These buds have limited local processing power and rely on cloud-based AI models.
*   **Profile Building:** Buds build user profiles based on usage patterns, time of day, location (with permission), calendar events, and social media activity (opt-in).
*   **Predictive Modeling:** A central server hosts AI models that predict content needs based on user profiles and external data (news, weather, traffic). These models generate 'content anticipation scores' for various content items.
*   **Pre-fetching & Preparation:** Based on anticipation scores, the server pre-fetches content (or portions of it) and prepares it for delivery. This could involve transcoding video, generating summaries, or pre-loading web pages.
*   **Adaptive Delivery:** The server delivers the pre-fetched content to the buds *before* the user explicitly requests it. The delivery is adaptive, prioritizing content with the highest anticipation scores and adjusting to network conditions.
*   **Local Caching & Rendering:** Buds locally cache the pre-fetched content and render it when the user interacts with it. This reduces latency and improves the user experience.
*   **Dynamic Bud Configuration:** The central server can dynamically configure the buds, adjusting their behavior based on user feedback and system performance.

**Pseudocode (Bud Agent - simplified):**

```
// Initialization
userID = get_user_id()
device_id = get_device_id()
connect_to_server()
request_initial_profile()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Receive updates from server (profile, anticipation scores)
  update = server.receive_update()

  // Check for explicit requests
  request = user_input()
  if (request != null) {
      // Serve request (potentially from cache)
      serve_request(request)
  } else {
    // Check for anticipated content
    for (content in anticipated_content) {
      if (content.score > threshold) {
        // Display anticipated content (subtly)
        display_anticipated_content(content)
      }
    }
  }

  // Report usage data to server
  report_usage_data()
}
```

**Novelty:** This differs from the reference patent by not just *enabling* delivery to multiple devices, but by *proactively* preparing and delivering content based on prediction. The 'bud' concept introduces a layer of localized intelligence and anticipation, shifting from a pull-based system to a push-based system with predictive capabilities. Itâ€™s less about selecting delivery destinations, and more about *anticipating* what content the user will want *before* they ask for it.
