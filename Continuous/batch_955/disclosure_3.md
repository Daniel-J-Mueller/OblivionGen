## Secure Key Sharding with Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Expand on the key management service to implement a key sharding mechanism *combined* with fine-grained, time-based access control. Instead of a single encrypted key token, the customer key is split into multiple shares, each encrypted with a different domain key and associated with a specific time window and/or access policy.

**Specifications:**

*   **Key Sharding Algorithm:** Employ a Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) or similar algorithm to divide the customer key into *n* shares.  The threshold *k* dictates the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the original key.
*   **Domain Key Pool:** Maintain a dynamically updated pool of domain cryptographic keys. Each key is assigned metadata: creation date, expiration date, access control list (ACL), and a unique identifier.
*   **Share Encryption & Assignment:** Each key share is encrypted using a *different* domain key selected from the pool. The selection process considers:
    *   **Temporal Access:** The desired time window for which the share is valid. Domain keys nearing expiration are avoided.
    *   **Access Policies:** The specific ACL associated with the share, allowing for granular control over who/what can access a portion of the key.
    *   **Redundancy:** Distribute shares across multiple domain keys to increase resilience against key compromise.
*   **Share Distribution:** Distribute the encrypted shares to multiple, geographically diverse storage locations or trusted third parties. The client receives only *a subset* of the shares.
*   **Key Reconstruction Process:**
    1.  Client requests the customer key.
    2.  The service identifies the necessary shares based on the clientâ€™s credentials and current time.
    3.  The service retrieves the shares from their respective storage locations.
    4.  The service decrypts each share using the corresponding domain key.
    5.  The service combines the decrypted shares using the SSS algorithm to reconstruct the original customer key.
*   **Domain Key Rotation:** Implement automated rotation of domain keys. New keys are added to the pool, and old keys are revoked.  During rotation, ensure that existing shares remain accessible until their expiration date.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Integrate with an access control policy engine. Policies define who can request shares, which shares they are authorized to receive, and the conditions under which access is granted.
*    **Auditing:** Log all key share requests, access events, and policy enforcement decisions for auditing and security analysis.

**Pseudocode (Key Share Retrieval):**

```
function retrieveKeyShares(clientID, requestedOperation, currentTime) {
  // 1. Authenticate client (omitted for brevity)

  // 2. Determine authorized shares based on clientID, requestedOperation, and currentTime
  authorizedShares = accessControlPolicyEngine.evaluatePolicy(clientID, requestedOperation, currentTime);

  // 3. Retrieve encrypted shares from storage
  encryptedShares = storage.retrieveShares(authorizedShares);

  // 4. Decrypt shares using corresponding domain keys
  decryptedShares = [];
  for each share in encryptedShares {
    domainKey = getKeyFromPool(share.domainKeyID);
    decryptedShare = decrypt(share.shareData, domainKey);
    decryptedShares.add(decryptedShare);
  }

  return decryptedShares;
}

function reconstructKey(decryptedShares) {
  // Use Shamir Secret Sharing algorithm to reconstruct the original key
  originalKey = SSS.reconstruct(decryptedShares);
  return originalKey;
}
```

**Innovation:** This approach enhances security by reducing the attack surface. Compromising a single domain key does not reveal the entire customer key. The temporal aspect introduces a dynamic layer of access control, limiting the window of opportunity for attackers. The policy-driven share assignment allows for fine-grained control over key access, supporting various use cases such as least privilege access and data segregation.
