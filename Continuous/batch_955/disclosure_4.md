## Dynamic Quality Metric Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on static quality metrics (repeat customer ratio, review rating, impression count). This design proposes a system that *dynamically adjusts the weight* of these metrics – and potentially introduces new ones – based on real-time feedback from user interactions and market performance. This is achieved using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent.

**Specifications:**

1.  **RL Agent:**
    *   **Environment:**  The “environment” is the digital marketplace and its users. State is defined by a vector including current quality metric values for products, user engagement metrics (click-through rates, time spent viewing product pages, add-to-cart rates, purchase rates), and external market data (competitor pricing, seasonality).
    *   **Action Space:** The action space consists of a set of weighting coefficients for each quality metric (e.g., weight\_repeat\_customer, weight\_review\_rating, weight\_impression\_count). The sum of these weights must equal 1.  The action space also includes the potential to introduce *new* metrics, derived from data not currently used.
    *   **Reward Function:**  The reward is based on an aggregate metric reflecting marketplace health. This might be a weighted combination of:
        *   Overall sales revenue.
        *   Customer satisfaction (derived from surveys/feedback).
        *   Inventory turnover rate.
        *   Conversion rate.
        *   A penalty for displaying low-quality products (identified through returns, negative reviews, or manual flagging).

2.  **Data Pipeline:**
    *   Real-time data feeds from the digital marketplace (website, app, transaction systems).
    *   Historical data storage (product performance, user behavior, market trends).
    *   Feature engineering module to derive relevant inputs for the RL agent (e.g., moving averages, seasonality indicators).

3.  **Model Training & Deployment:**
    *   Off-policy RL algorithm (e.g., Deep Q-Network (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)).
    *   Continuous training loop: The RL agent is constantly learning from new data and adjusting the metric weights.
    *   A/B testing framework to validate the performance of the RL-driven weighting scheme against a baseline (e.g., the static weights used in the original patent).
    *   Deployment via API endpoint that provides the dynamically adjusted metric weights to the product ranking system.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize RL Agent (DQN, PPO, etc.) with initial weights
agent = create_rl_agent()

while True:
  // Observe current state (product metrics, user behavior, market data)
  state = get_current_state()

  // Agent selects action (adjusts metric weights)
  action = agent.choose_action(state)

  // Apply updated weights to product ranking system
  apply_weights(action)

  // Observe reward (marketplace health metric)
  reward = calculate_reward()

  // Agent learns from experience (updates its policy)
  agent.learn(state, action, reward)
```

**Novelty:** This design introduces a *dynamic*, adaptive approach to quality assessment, moving beyond static weighting schemes. The RL agent can learn to optimize metric weights in response to changing market conditions and user preferences, potentially leading to significant improvements in marketplace performance and customer satisfaction.  It’s not simply ranking *based* on quality, but *defining* what quality *is* through learning.
