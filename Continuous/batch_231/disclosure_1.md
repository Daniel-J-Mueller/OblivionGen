## Adaptive Password Complexity based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system that dynamically adjusts password complexity requirements *not* based on static policies or breach notifications, but on real-time behavioral biometric analysis of the user interacting with the account.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Sensor Suite:** Captures keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, error rate), mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, trajectory), and potentially, subtle device motion data (gyroscope, accelerometer – optional, privacy considerations).
*   **Baseline Profile Generator:**  During initial account setup and a learning phase, the system builds a personalized behavioral profile for each user. This profile represents their typical interaction patterns.
*   **Real-time Anomaly Detector:** Continuously monitors user interactions for deviations from their baseline profile. Anomalies are scored based on severity (magnitude of deviation, duration, frequency).
*   **Dynamic Complexity Controller:**  Adjusts password complexity requirements *on the fly* based on the anomaly score. Lower anomaly scores = lower complexity requirements (e.g., shorter password length, fewer special characters). Higher anomaly scores = increased complexity (longer, more complex passwords, multi-factor authentication prompt).
*   **Adaptive Challenge System:**  When anomaly scores reach a threshold, instead of *immediately* demanding a new, complex password, the system presents adaptive challenges – small, behavioral tasks designed to verify user identity (e.g., drag-and-drop puzzle, simple math problem presented with a unique visual style based on the user’s established preferences). Successful completion lowers the anomaly score.
*   **Privacy Shield:** Local processing of behavioral data whenever feasible. Anonymization and aggregation of data for model training. Transparent user control over data collection and usage.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
UserBehaviorProfile = {} // Initialize empty profile for each user

//On User Login
Fetch UserBehaviorProfile

//Real-time Monitoring Loop
While (User Active) {
    BehavioralData = CaptureKeystrokeDynamics() + CaptureMouseMovement() //Add other sensors as needed
    AnomalyScore = CalculateAnomalyScore(BehavioralData, UserBehaviorProfile)
    
    If (AnomalyScore > ThresholdLow) {
        //Present Adaptive Challenge
        ChallengeResult = PresentAdaptiveChallenge(AnomalyScore)
        If (ChallengeResult == Success) {
            AnomalyScore = 0 //Reset anomaly score
        }
    }
    
    //Dynamic Complexity Adjustment
    If (AnomalyScore > ThresholdHigh) {
        RequireComplexPassword = True
    } Else {
        RequireComplexPassword = False
    }
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond reactive security measures (password resets after breaches) to *proactive* security, continuously assessing user identity based on how they interact with the system. It balances security with usability by dynamically adjusting requirements based on observed behavior, reducing friction for legitimate users while increasing protection against unauthorized access. The adaptive challenge system offers a non-disruptive way to verify identity without always forcing password changes.
