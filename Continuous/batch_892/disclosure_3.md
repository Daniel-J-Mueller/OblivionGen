## Dynamic Inventory Mapping & Personalized Retail Navigation

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Real-time Inventory & Customer Location Fusion Engine.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   High-density Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon network throughout the retail space. Beacons must support iBeacon & Eddystone protocols.
    *   Overhead camera system (existing infrastructure can be leveraged, requires calibration). Resolution: 4K minimum. Frame Rate: 30fps.
    *   Mobile App (iOS & Android).
    *   Dedicated server infrastructure (cloud-based preferred) for data processing & storage.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   BLE Beacon Signal Processing Module: Filters noise, calculates proximity, and estimates item quantity based on beacon signal strength.
    *   Computer Vision Module: Analyzes overhead camera feed to identify customer location, movement patterns, and potentially ‘interest’ via gaze tracking (optional).
    *   Dynamic Inventory Map: A constantly updated digital representation of the store layout *and* inventory levels.  Data sourced from BLE beacons *and* sales data.
    *   Personalized Navigation Engine:  Generates turn-by-turn directions *within the store* based on customer shopping list, preferences, and real-time inventory.
    *   Mobile App Interface: Displays store map, personalized directions, item location, and alternative product suggestions.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Customer opens mobile app and enters shopping list/preferences.
    2.  App requests current location (BLE & GPS).
    3.  Server generates optimal path through store, factoring in inventory levels.
    4.  App displays route and updates dynamically based on customer movement.
    5.  BLE beacon data continuously refines customer location and identifies items nearby.
    6.  Computer vision tracks customer gaze and analyzes potential interest in products.
    7.  Server adjusts route and provides relevant product suggestions via app.

**Pseudocode (Navigation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION generate_route(customer_preferences, shopping_list, inventory_map, customer_location):
    // 1. Filter inventory_map to items in shopping_list
    filtered_inventory = filter(inventory_map, shopping_list)

    // 2. Calculate shortest path to first item in filtered_inventory
    path_to_first_item = shortest_path(customer_location, filtered_inventory[0])

    // 3. Initialize route with path_to_first_item
    route = path_to_first_item

    // 4. Iterate through remaining items in filtered_inventory
    FOR each item IN filtered_inventory[1:]:
        // 5. Calculate shortest path from last point in route to current item
        path_to_item = shortest_path(route.last_point, item)

        // 6. Append path_to_item to route
        route.append(path_to_item)

    // 7. Optimize route based on store traffic & known congestion (dynamic adjustment)
    route = optimize_route(route, store_traffic_data)

    RETURN route
```

**Innovation Detail:**

The system transcends simple in-store navigation. By fusing real-time inventory data with precise customer location tracking, it creates a genuinely *dynamic* shopping experience.  Customers aren't just guided to items; they're guided to *available* items, minimizing frustration and maximizing efficiency. The system anticipates needs based on gaze tracking, proactively suggesting alternative products when items are out of stock.  Further iterations could incorporate AR overlays to visually highlight items on shelves. This isn't about automation; it's about hyper-personalization and making the physical retail experience more enjoyable and productive.
