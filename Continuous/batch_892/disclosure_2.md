## Modular, Bio-Integrated Mobile Drive Unit - “Symbiotic Motion”

**Concept:** A mobile drive unit that incorporates bio-luminescent algae within a transparent, impact-resistant polymer chassis. The algae provide ambient lighting and, critically, contribute to a passive cooling system via evapotranspiration. The system is designed for modularity – allowing swapping of chassis components (wheels, tracks, legs) and algae ‘cartridges’ for varied functionality and aesthetic customization.

**Specs:**

*   **Chassis Material:** Transparent, high-impact acrylic polymer infused with UV filters.  Minimum wall thickness: 8mm.  Modular connection points: standardized dovetail joints with locking mechanism (force to disengage: 50N minimum).  Internal cavity volume: 5 Liters.
*   **Algae Cartridge:** Sealed, cylindrical reservoir (dimensions: 20cm diameter x 10cm height) containing *Pyrocystis fusiformis* algae suspended in nutrient-rich saltwater solution.  Cartridge material: UV-resistant polycarbonate.  Integrated micro-pump (power draw: <1W) for circulation, preventing algae settling.  Integrated optical sensor measuring bioluminescence intensity.
*   **Cooling System:** Cartridge positioned directly adjacent to drive motor and electronics. Evapotranspiration from algae colony regulated by humidity sensor and miniature fan (variable speed, 0-1000 RPM). Target temperature reduction: 10-15°C under load.
*   **Drive System Interface:** Standardized mounting flange compatible with various wheel/track/leg modules.  Power delivery: 24V DC.  Data communication: I2C protocol for algae bioluminescence/humidity/temperature readings.
*   **Power Source:** Internal rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery (capacity: 10Ah, 24V).  Wireless charging capability (Qi standard).  Solar panel integration optional (surface area: 200cm², efficiency: 20%).
*   **Aesthetic Customization:** Chassis design allows for interchangeable colored polymer inserts and customizable LED lighting patterns (synchronized with algae bioluminescence).
*   **Bio-Security:** Cartridge designed with multiple layers of containment to prevent algal escape.  UV sterilization cycle for cartridge upon removal/replacement.



**Pseudocode (Algae Bioluminescence Control):**

```
// Function: Adjust LED brightness based on algae bioluminescence
function adjustLEDs() {
  // Read bioluminescence intensity from optical sensor
  bioluminescenceIntensity = readSensorData("bioluminescence");

  // Scale LED brightness (0-100%) based on bioluminescence intensity
  ledBrightness = map(bioluminescenceIntensity, 0, 1000, 0, 100); // Assuming sensor maxes at 1000

  // Apply LED brightness to LED control module
  setLEDIntensity(ledBrightness);
}

// Function: Run monitoring loop
function monitoringLoop() {
  while (true) {
    adjustLEDs();
    delay(100ms); // Sample every 100ms
  }
}

// Main program
function main() {
  initializeSensors();
  monitoringLoop();
}
```
