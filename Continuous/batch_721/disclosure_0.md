## Dynamic Virtual Machine 'Shadowing' & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Implement a system where launched virtual machines actively "shadow" a pre-allocated, minimally running "shadow VM" on the *same* host. This shadow VM passively observes the resource demands of the active VM, predicting future needs *before* they occur. This allows for preemptive resource allocation, reducing latency and improving overall performance, especially during dynamic workloads.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow VM Creation & Lifecycle:**

*   **Initial Setup:** Upon customer account creation/initial VM deployment, a minimal “shadow VM” is automatically provisioned on a designated host server. This shadow VM has minimal CPU, memory, and I/O assigned.
*   **Association:** Each active VM is linked to its corresponding shadow VM. This link is maintained throughout the active VM's lifecycle.
*   **Passive Monitoring:** The shadow VM runs a lightweight agent that passively monitors the active VM’s resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O) via hypervisor APIs. No data is actively *pulled*; the agent subscribes to performance events.
*   **Resource Prediction:** The agent utilizes a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, or a simple moving average) to predict future resource demands based on historical data.  The algorithm adapts over time.
*   **Pre-Allocation Request:**  Based on the prediction, the shadow VM agent sends requests to the hypervisor for *pre-allocation* of resources (CPU cycles, memory pages, I/O bandwidth). These requests are *non-blocking* and are fulfilled if available.
*   **Resource Handover:** When the active VM requests resources, the hypervisor first checks if pre-allocated resources are available. If so, they are immediately assigned. Otherwise, the hypervisor follows its standard allocation procedures.
*   **Shadow VM Scaling:** The shadow VM itself is dynamically scaled (CPU, Memory) based on the *predicted* peak resource demands of the active VM.
*   **VM Termination:** Upon active VM termination, the associated shadow VM is either suspended or terminated, depending on configuration (e.g., auto-scaling policies).

**2. System Architecture:**

*   **Host Server:** Each host server hosts both active VMs and their associated shadow VMs.
*   **Hypervisor:** The hypervisor must expose APIs for monitoring VM resource usage and requesting pre-allocation of resources.
*   **Monitoring Agent (within Shadow VM):** Lightweight agent responsible for monitoring, prediction, and pre-allocation requests.  Written in a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust, Go).
*   **Central Management Server:** Responsible for initial shadow VM provisioning, VM-Shadow VM association, and configuration management.
*   **Time-Series Database:** Stores historical resource usage data for training the prediction models.

**3.  Pseudocode (Monitoring Agent – Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
Connect to Hypervisor API
Connect to Time-Series Database
Initialize Prediction Model (e.g., Exponential Smoothing)

// Main Loop
While VM is Running:
  Get Current Resource Usage (CPU, Memory, I/O)
  Update Prediction Model with Current Usage
  Predict Future Resource Usage (next 5 seconds)
  Calculate Resource Delta (Predicted - Current)
  If Resource Delta > Threshold:
    Request Pre-Allocation from Hypervisor
    Log Request and Response
  Sleep(1 second)
```

**4.  Configuration Parameters:**

*   `ShadowVM_BaseResources`: Base CPU/Memory allocated to the shadow VM.
*   `PredictionHorizon`: Time horizon for resource prediction (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds).
*   `PreAllocationThreshold`: Minimum resource delta required to trigger pre-allocation.
*   `ScalingPolicy`:  Algorithm for dynamically scaling the shadow VM.
*   `MonitoringInterval`: Frequency of resource monitoring.
*   `HistoryRetentionPeriod`:  Length of time to retain historical resource usage data.
