## Dynamic Persona-Based Search Refinement

**Concept:** Extend the relevance feedback loop by incorporating dynamic user personas derived from implicit behavioral data, and using these personas to *proactively* tailor search results *before* explicit feedback is received. This moves beyond simply reacting to ‘thumbs up/down’ and anticipates user intent.

**Specification:**

**1. Persona Derivation Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**  Collect data on:
    *   **Search History:** Queries, dwell time on results, click-through rates.
    *   **Purchase History:**  Items bought, categories, price points.
    *   **Browsing Behavior:** Pages visited within the retailer's site, products viewed.
    *   **Demographic Data (Optional):** Age range, location (with user consent).
*   **Clustering Algorithm:** Employ a k-means or hierarchical clustering algorithm to group users into distinct personas based on the collected data.  The number of personas (k) can be dynamically adjusted based on data variance.
*   **Persona Profile:**  Each persona is represented by a feature vector containing weighted values for categories, price ranges, brands, product attributes (e.g., color, size), and search term preferences.  These weights are updated continuously as new data is collected.
*   **Real-Time Persona Assignment:** When a user initiates a search, assign them to the closest persona based on their current session behavior (e.g., items in their cart, pages recently visited).  This assignment should be probabilistic (e.g., 80% confidence in Persona A, 10% in Persona B, 10% in Persona C) to allow for shifting preferences.

**2. Proactive Search Refinement Module:**

*   **Query Expansion:** Before performing the initial search, expand the query with terms commonly associated with the assigned persona. This expansion is weighted; terms highly relevant to the persona receive higher weight.
*   **Result Ranking Adjustment:**  After the initial search, re-rank the results based on the assigned persona's preferences. This can be achieved by:
    *   **Feature Scoring:** Assign each result a score based on how well it matches the persona's feature vector.
    *   **Boosting/Demotion:**  Boost the ranking of results that strongly align with the persona and demote those that don’t.
*   **Personalized Filtering:** Apply personalized filters based on the persona’s preferences. For example, if the persona consistently purchases eco-friendly products, automatically filter for sustainable options.

**3. Feedback Integration:**

*   **Explicit Feedback:** Continue to collect explicit feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down) as before.
*   **Implicit Feedback:**  Track implicit feedback signals such as:
    *   **Dwell Time:** How long the user spends on a result page.
    *   **Add to Cart:**  Whether the user adds the item to their cart.
    *   **Purchase:** Whether the user completes the purchase.
*   **Persona Refinement:**  Use the collected feedback to refine the persona profiles and improve the accuracy of the persona assignment algorithm.



**Pseudocode:**

```
function performSearch(user, query):
  persona = assignPersona(user)
  expandedQuery = expandQuery(query, persona)
  searchResults = performInitialSearch(expandedQuery)
  rankedResults = rankResults(searchResults, persona)
  filteredResults = filterResults(rankedResults, persona)
  return filteredResults

function assignPersona(user):
  // Analyze user's session behavior, purchase history, browsing history
  // Use clustering algorithm to assign user to closest persona
  // Return persona with associated confidence level

function expandQuery(query, persona):
  // Identify terms commonly associated with the persona
  // Add these terms to the query with appropriate weights
  // Return expanded query

function rankResults(searchResults, persona):
  // Calculate a score for each search result based on how well it matches the persona's preferences
  // Re-rank the search results based on their scores
  // Return re-ranked search results

function filterResults(rankedResults, persona):
  // Apply personalized filters based on the persona's preferences
  // Return filtered search results
