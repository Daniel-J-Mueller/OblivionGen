## Predictive Network Resilience via Simulated Incident Propagation

**Concept:** Extend incident fingerprinting to proactively simulate incident spread and predict potential impact *before* it fully manifests. This moves beyond reactive remediation to preemptive resilience.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Network Graph Integration:** Incorporate a dynamic network topology map. This map should represent device interdependencies, bandwidth capacities, and critical path identification. Data sources include network management systems (NMS), configuration files, and real-time traffic analysis.

2.  **Incident Propagation Model:** Develop a probabilistic model that simulates incident spread. Factors considered:
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation Probability:** Based on CVSS scores, known exploits, and threat intelligence feeds.
    *   **Propagation Vector:** Method of spread (e.g., lateral movement, DDoS, worm propagation).
    *   **Bandwidth Saturation:** Impact on network performance during propagation.
    *   **Device Criticality:** Prioritized impact assessment based on service dependencies.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** Model the impact of existing security controls (firewalls, IPS, etc.).

3.  **Fingerprint-Triggered Simulation:** When a current incident fingerprint is generated (as per the existing patent), *initiate* a simulation based on that fingerprint's characteristics. The simulation doesn't attempt to *solve* the current incident, but rather models the *potential* cascade effect.

4.  **Simulation Engine:**
    *   Input: Current incident fingerprint, network graph, propagation model parameters.
    *   Process: Simulate incident propagation across the network graph, calculating impact on various services and devices. Utilize a multi-threaded approach to accelerate simulation.
    *   Output: A “propagation heatmap” visualizing the potential spread, along with predicted service degradation/outage times.

5.  **Proactive Mitigation Recommendations:** Based on the simulation results, generate proactive mitigation recommendations *before* impacts are realized:
    *   **Traffic Redirection:** Dynamically reroute traffic around potentially impacted areas.
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Increase bandwidth to critical services.
    *   **Service Isolation:** Temporarily isolate affected segments.
    *   **Automated Security Policy Adjustments:** Update firewall rules and IPS signatures.

6.  **Real-Time Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor network performance during the incident and compare it to the simulation predictions. Use this feedback to refine the propagation model and improve future predictions.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function simulate_propagation(current_incident_fingerprint, network_graph):
  propagation_heatmap = initialize_heatmap(network_graph)
  initial_affected_nodes = identify_affected_nodes(current_incident_fingerprint)

  for node in initial_affected_nodes:
    propagation_heatmap[node].severity = current_incident_fingerprint.severity

  for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    for node in network_graph:
      if propagation_heatmap[node].severity > 0:
        for neighbor in network_graph[node].neighbors:
          probability = calculate_propagation_probability(node, neighbor, current_incident_fingerprint)
          if random.random() < probability:
            propagation_heatmap[neighbor].severity += propagation_heatmap[node].severity * probability
            # Apply resource constraints and mitigation effects

  return propagation_heatmap
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `NetworkGraph`:  Represents network topology. Nodes are devices, edges are connections.
*   `IncidentFingerprint`: (As defined in patent)
*   `PropagationHeatmap`: A mapping of network nodes to severity levels.
