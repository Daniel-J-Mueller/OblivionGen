## Adaptive Content "Provenance" Layer

**Concept:** Extend the authority ranking system to not just *score* content, but to create a dynamic, visual "provenance" layer overlaid on content as it's displayed to the user. This goes beyond simply indicating authority; it *shows* the user *why* content is considered authoritative, and *how* that authority has evolved.

**Specs:**

1.  **Provenance Data Structure:**  A graph database structure. Nodes represent:
    *   Content Items (URLs, document hashes)
    *   Users (anonymized IDs)
    *   Authority Signals (explicit ratings, social shares, expertise scores, linking content, time since creation, etc.)
    *   Categories/Topics (taxonomy used for expertise scoring)
2.  **Real-time Provenance Calculation:** As a user navigates to a content item:
    *   The system queries the graph database for the content item's provenance.
    *   It retrieves the top N most influential authority signals (weighted by signal type and recency).
    *   It identifies the users most strongly associated with confirming the authority of the content (based on signal contribution).
3.  **Visual Overlay:** A configurable user interface element, activated by a browser extension or integrated directly into a content platform.  Options:
    *   **"Authority Timeline":** Displays a chronological sequence of authority signals. Each signal is represented as a node on the timeline, with details on the source (user/site) and type (rating/share/link).  Users can hover over nodes for more information.
    *   **"Influence Network":** A force-directed graph showing the users and content items most connected to the current item. Node size represents influence (based on weighted signal contribution).  Edges represent relationships (e.g., "User A shared Content B").
    *   **"Expert Highlights":**  If the system can identify users with demonstrated expertise in the relevant topic, their contributions to the authority score are visually emphasized (e.g., a special badge or color).
4.  **User Customization:**
    *   Users can control the level of detail displayed in the provenance layer (e.g., show only explicit ratings, or include all signals).
    *   Users can filter the provenance layer by signal type, user group, or time period.
5.  **API for Integration:** Provide an API for content platforms to seamlessly integrate the provenance layer into their existing infrastructure.  This API should allow platforms to:
    *   Request provenance data for a given content item.
    *   Customize the visual appearance of the provenance layer.
    *   Receive user feedback on the provenance layer (e.g., "This provenance layer is helpful").

**Pseudocode (Provenance Calculation):**

```
function calculateProvenance(contentItemURL, userPreferences) {
  // 1. Query graph database for provenance data
  provenanceData = graphDB.query(contentItemURL)

  // 2. Filter provenance data based on user preferences
  filteredSignals = filterSignals(provenanceData.signals, userPreferences)

  // 3. Calculate weighted authority score for each signal
  weightedSignals = calculateWeightedScore(filteredSignals)

  // 4. Identify top N influential signals
  topSignals = sortSignals(weightedSignals).slice(0, N)

  // 5. Identify influential users
  influentialUsers = identifyInfluentialUsers(topSignals)

  // 6. Return provenance data
  return {
    topSignals: topSignals,
    influentialUsers: influentialUsers
  }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **"Reputation Trails":**  Track the provenance of *users*, not just content. Show a user's history of sharing/rating authoritative content.
*   **"Dispute Resolution":**  Allow users to flag potentially inaccurate or misleading provenance data. Implement a community-based dispute resolution system.
*   **"Predictive Authority":**  Use machine learning to predict the future authority of content based on its current provenance.
