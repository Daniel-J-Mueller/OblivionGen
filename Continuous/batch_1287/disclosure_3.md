## Dynamic Codebase 'Personality' Profiling & Targeted Mutation Testing

**Concept:** Expand the codebase analysis beyond static characteristics (language, complexity, etc.) to create a 'personality profile' representing *how* the code behaves. This profile drives a targeted mutation testing system, creating highly relevant and impactful test cases.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Feature Extraction Module:**
    *   Input: Source code repository.
    *   Process:
        *   Dynamic analysis via controlled execution with instrumentation (e.g., tracing function calls, data flow, control flow).
        *   Identify frequently used code paths.
        *   Measure code 'stickiness' – how often specific code blocks are executed relative to total execution time.
        *   Detect code 'hotspots' – areas with high cyclomatic complexity *and* high execution frequency.
        *   Analyze data dependencies between functions/modules.
        *   Calculate ‘code entropy’ – measure of code unpredictability based on execution patterns.
    *   Output: Behavioral feature vector representing the codebase personality.

2.  **Mutation Operator Library (Enhanced):**
    *   Existing mutation operators (arithmetic, relational, logical) + new operators focused on behavioral characteristics.
    *   **Behavioral Mutation Operators:**
        *   **'Sticky Path' Mutation:**  Inject faults *specifically* into frequently executed code paths identified by the Behavioral Feature Extraction Module.
        *   **'Hotspot' Mutation:**  Target mutations to code within identified 'hotspots', prioritizing areas of high impact.
        *   **'Dependency Disruption' Mutation:**  Modify data dependencies between modules to test system resilience.
        *   **‘Entropy Injection’ Mutation:** Introduce small, randomized changes to code in areas of high entropy, testing robustness against unpredictable behavior.
    *   Operator prioritization based on behavioral feature scores.

3.  **Targeted Mutation Testing Engine:**
    *   Input: Source code, Behavioral Feature Vector, Mutation Operator Library.
    *   Process:
        *   Select mutation operators based on behavioral feature scores (e.g., prioritize 'Sticky Path' mutations for code with high 'stickiness').
        *   Apply mutations to the source code.
        *   Run existing unit/integration tests against the mutated code.
        *   Identify failing tests – indicate potential defects.
        *   Calculate a ‘mutation score’ based on the percentage of surviving mutations.
    *   Output: Mutation score, list of failing tests, and flagged mutated code.

4.  **Feedback Loop & Model Refinement:**
    *   Integrate results of mutation testing into the Behavioral Feature Extraction Module.
    *   Refine the behavioral model based on identified defects.
    *   Adjust operator prioritization to improve mutation effectiveness.

**Pseudocode (Targeted Mutation Testing Engine):**

```
function run_targeted_mutation_test(source_code, behavioral_features):
  mutation_library = load_mutation_library()
  prioritized_operators = prioritize_mutation_operators(mutation_library, behavioral_features)
  mutated_code_list = []

  for operator in prioritized_operators:
    mutated_code = apply_mutation(source_code, operator)
    mutated_code_list.append(mutated_code)

  test_results = run_tests(mutated_code_list)

  killed_mutants = 0
  for mutant, result in test_results:
    if result == "FAILED":
      killed_mutants += 1

  mutation_score = (killed_mutants / len(mutated_code_list)) * 100

  return mutation_score, test_results
```

**Novelty:**  Traditional mutation testing applies mutations randomly. This system moves beyond randomness by generating mutations based on a *dynamic* behavioral profile of the codebase, leading to more focused and impactful testing.  The integration of a feedback loop allows the system to learn and adapt over time, improving the effectiveness of mutation testing.
