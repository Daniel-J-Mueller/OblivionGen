## Secure Key Sharding with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Expand on the key management by introducing key *sharding* coupled with *temporal decay*. Rather than a single import key token, break the original key into multiple shares, each encrypted with different domain keys and having independent expiration times.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Shard Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Original cryptographic key (K), number of shares (N), maximum shard lifetime (Tmax), variance factor (V) (0 < V < 1)
*   **Process:**
    1.  Generate N unique domain keys (DKi), where i = 1 to N.
    2.  For each share i:
        a.  Generate a random lifetime (Ti) within a range: `Tmax * (1 - V) <= Ti <= Tmax`.  This introduces variance in expiration times.
        b.  Split K into N shares (Ki) using a secret sharing algorithm (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing).
        c.  Encrypt Ki with DKi to create encrypted share (ESi).
        d.  Associate ESi with its expiration timestamp (Ti).
*   **Output:** List of encrypted shares (ESi) with associated expiration timestamps (Ti).

**2. Secure Storage Module:**

*   **Input:** List of encrypted shares (ESi) with associated expiration timestamps (Ti).
*   **Process:** Distribute encrypted shares across multiple secure storage locations. Each location stores a subset of the shares. Implement a redundancy scheme to ensure availability even if some storage locations are compromised or unavailable.
*   **Output:** Securely stored key shares.

**3. Key Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Input:** Request for the original key, list of available key shares, domain keys (DKi).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Retrieve a sufficient number of valid (not expired) key shares from secure storage. A threshold 'k' of shares is required for reconstruction, where k <= N.
    2.  Decrypt the retrieved shares using the corresponding domain keys (DKi).
    3.  Reconstruct the original key (K) from the decrypted shares using the secret sharing algorithm.
*   **Output:** Original cryptographic key (K).

**4. Domain Key Rotation Module:**

*   **Input:** Schedule for rotating domain keys.
*   **Process:** Regularly rotate domain keys (DKi) based on a predefined schedule.  Re-encrypt existing key shares with the new domain keys.  Maintain a history of domain keys for decryption of older key shares.
*   **Output:** Updated domain keys and re-encrypted key shares.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
FUNCTION reconstructKey(request, availableShares, domainKeys):
  requiredShares = threshold  // Minimum number of shares needed
  decryptedShares = []

  IF length(availableShares) < requiredShares:
    RETURN "Insufficient shares available"

  FOR EACH share IN availableShares:
    IF share.expiration > currentTime:
      decryptedShare = decrypt(share.encryptedData, domainKeys[share.domainKeyIndex])
      decryptedShares.append(decryptedShare)
    ELSE:
      // Log expired share attempt
      CONTINUE

  IF length(decryptedShares) < requiredShares:
    RETURN "Insufficient valid shares"

  originalKey = reconstructKeyFromShares(decryptedShares) // Using Shamir's or similar
  RETURN originalKey
```

**Novelty:** This approach adds a layer of security by distributing the key across multiple shares, each with an independent expiration.  If one share is compromised, the entire key isn't exposed.  The temporal decay ensures that even compromised shares have a limited lifespan.  The combination of sharding, temporal decay, and domain key rotation creates a robust and adaptable key management system. This moves beyond a single point of failure inherent in the original patent.
