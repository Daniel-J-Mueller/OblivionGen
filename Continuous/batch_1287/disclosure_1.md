## Adaptive Resonance Tagging & Spatial Audio Localization

**Concept:** Augment the existing system with resonant frequency tagging of objects/people and combine this with spatial audio localization to create a dynamic, interactive spatial map within a facility. This isn’t about precise location, but *resonant identity* and perceived proximity.

**Specs:**

*   **Resonant Tagging System:**
    *   Each tracked entity (person, asset, etc.) is assigned a unique, low-power resonant frequency. This could be a modulated ultrasonic or RF signal.
    *   Small, lightweight resonant tags are affixed to or worn by tracked entities. These tags are passively powered via inductive coupling from strategically placed readers.
    *   Readers broadcast a scanning signal. Tags respond at their assigned frequency, enabling identification.
*   **Spatial Audio Engine:**
    *   The server incorporates a spatial audio engine capable of simulating sound sources in 3D space.
    *   Each tag's identity is linked to a unique audio ‘signature’ - a short sound or musical phrase.
    *   Sound ‘volume’ is inversely proportional to estimated distance from the user – derived from RSSI/triangulation (existing system), and refined by resonant tag signal strength.
*   **Directional Speakers/Headphones:**
    *   Facility equipped with strategically placed directional speakers. Alternatively, users equipped with bone-conduction headphones.
*   **Server Software:**
    *   Real-time processing of tag data and location estimates.
    *   Spatial audio engine generates soundscapes based on tag positions and identities.
    *   User interface to adjust audio profiles, filter tags, and explore the spatial map via sound.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Tag Data Structure
struct Tag {
  tagID: integer;
  frequency: float;
  audioSignature: string;
  lastSeen: timestamp;
  estimatedLocation: (x, y, z);
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Receive tag data from readers
  tagData = receiveTagData();

  // Update tag locations (using existing triangulation/RSSI)
  updateTagLocations(tagData);

  // Calculate distance to user
  distance = calculateDistance(userLocation, tagLocation);

  // Adjust audio volume based on distance
  volume = 1.0 / distance; // Inverse relationship

  // Play audio signature
  playAudio(tag.audioSignature, volume);

  // Filter tags based on user preferences (e.g., show only assets, ignore certain people)
  filteredTags = filterTags(tags, userPreferences);
}
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   **Interactive Soundscapes:** Soundscapes can evolve based on tag interactions.  Two tagged people approaching each other might trigger a blend of their audio signatures. A tagged asset being moved could generate a distinct sound.
*   **Accessibility:** The system could provide audio cues for visually impaired users to navigate the facility, identifying obstacles or points of interest.
*   **Security:**  The resonant frequencies can be encrypted and authenticated to prevent spoofing.
*   **Material Interaction:** Tagged objects could be linked to haptic feedback systems - a tagged shelf being touched could generate a vibration.
*   **Procedural Audio Generation:**  Instead of pre-recorded signatures, procedural audio algorithms can create dynamic sounds that change based on the entity’s state or environment.
