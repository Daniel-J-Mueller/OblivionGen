## Dynamic Resolution Prioritization Network

**Concept:** Expand the multi-camera network functionality beyond triggering a high-resolution camera and implement a dynamic resolution prioritization system. Instead of solely activating a high-resolution camera upon detecting a person of interest via a lower-resolution camera, the system dynamically adjusts the resolution of *all* cameras in the network based on perceived threat level, network bandwidth, and processing availability.

**Specifications:**

*   **Camera Nodes:** Each camera in the network will be assigned a baseline resolution setting (low, medium, high).
*   **Threat Assessment Module:** Centralized module (potentially leveraging existing person-of-interest database access) to assign a threat score to detected individuals. Score ranges from 0-100.
*   **Resolution Mapping Table:** A table defining the resolution assigned to each camera node based on the current threat score. Example:
    *   Threat Score 0-30: All cameras operate at low resolution.
    *   Threat Score 31-60: Key cameras (defined by admin) operate at medium resolution, others low.
    *   Threat Score 61-80: Key cameras operate at high resolution, others medium.
    *   Threat Score 81-100: All cameras operate at high resolution.
*   **Bandwidth Monitoring:** Continuously monitor network bandwidth availability. If bandwidth is constrained, the system will automatically reduce resolution levels across the network *before* experiencing performance degradation.
*   **Processing Load Balancing:** Monitor the processing load on the central server. If the load is high, reduce resolution levels.
*   **Adaptive Frame Rate Control:** In addition to resolution, dynamically adjust frame rates per camera. Lower frame rates during low-threat situations to conserve resources.
*   **Camera Grouping:** Allow administrators to define camera groups and assign different resolution priorities to each group (e.g., “perimeter cameras” vs. “interior cameras”).
*   **AI-Driven Resolution Adjustment:** Implement a machine learning model that learns to optimize resolution settings based on historical data and real-time events. The model considers factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and the number of people present in the scene.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    threatScore = assessThreat(videoFeeds); // Returns a score 0-100
    bandwidthAvailable = checkNetworkBandwidth();
    processingLoad = checkServerLoad();

    if (bandwidthAvailable == false || processingLoad == true) {
        // Reduce resolution across all cameras.
        adjustResolution(cameras, "low");
    } else {
        if (threatScore <= 30) {
            adjustResolution(cameras, "low");
        } else if (threatScore <= 60) {
            adjustResolution(keyCameras, "medium");
            adjustResolution(otherCameras, "low");
        } else if (threatScore <= 80) {
            adjustResolution(keyCameras, "high");
            adjustResolution(otherCameras, "medium");
        } else {
            adjustResolution(cameras, "high");
        }
    }

    delay(100ms);
}

function adjustResolution(cameraList, resolution) {
    for each camera in cameraList {
        camera.setResolution(resolution);
    }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced security systems.
*   Smart city surveillance.
*   Traffic monitoring.
*   Retail analytics.
