## Adaptive Resource Topology Projection

**Concept:** Extend the 3D network visualization to dynamically project *potential* resource topologies based on predictive analytics and ‘what-if’ scenarios. Instead of solely visualizing the current state, the system forecasts network configurations responding to anticipated load, failures, or scaling events.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:**
    *   Real-time resource metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O, storage utilization).
    *   Historical performance data (trend analysis).
    *   Predictive models (AI/ML algorithms forecasting resource demand).
    *   User-defined ‘what-if’ scenarios (e.g., "simulate a 50% increase in database queries," "model the impact of a server outage").
*   **Processing:**
    *   The system runs predictive models to forecast future resource states under various conditions.
    *   It generates a ‘potential topology graph’ representing the predicted network configuration.  Nodes represent resources, edges represent connections/dependencies, and node/edge attributes reflect predicted resource utilization/performance.
    *   The system applies a cost function to evaluate different potential topologies (e.g., minimizing latency, maximizing throughput, reducing cost).
*   **Visualization:**
    *   The 3D visualization displays *multiple* overlaid topologies:
        *   **Current Topology:** Represents the real-time network state.
        *   **Predicted Topologies:**  Displays several potential future states (e.g., best-case, worst-case, most-likely). Each predicted topology is rendered with a distinct visual style (e.g., different color, transparency level).
        *   **Scenario-Based Topologies:** Visualizes the network configuration resulting from specific user-defined scenarios.
    *   **Dynamic Projection:** The system dynamically projects the predicted topologies onto the current network, highlighting changes and potential bottlenecks. For example, if a predictive model forecasts a resource overload, the affected resource in the current topology is highlighted, and the predicted replacement resource is displayed as a ‘ghosted’ overlay.
    *   **Time-Series Visualization:** Introduce a time slider allowing the user to step through time and observe the evolution of the predicted topologies. This allows for proactive identification of potential issues and informed decision-making.
*   **Interactive Elements:**
    *   **Scenario Editor:** A user interface allowing the creation and modification of ‘what-if’ scenarios.
    *   **Cost Function Editor:**  A user interface allowing the customization of the cost function used to evaluate potential topologies.
    *   **Topology Blending:** Controls allowing the user to blend between different predicted topologies and the current topology.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** The system automatically identifies anomalies in the predicted topologies and highlights them in the visualization.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Gather real-time resource metrics
  metrics = getRealTimeMetrics()

  // 2. Run predictive models
  predictions = runPredictiveModels(metrics)

  // 3. Generate potential topology graph
  potentialTopology = generateTopology(predictions)

  // 4. Evaluate potential topology (cost function)
  cost = evaluateTopology(potentialTopology)

  // 5. Render current topology and potential topologies
  renderCurrentTopology()
  renderPotentialTopology(potentialTopology, cost)

  // 6. Handle user interactions (scenario editor, time slider, etc.)
  handleUserInteractions()

  // 7. Delay
  delay(100ms)
}
```
