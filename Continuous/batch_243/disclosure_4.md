## Dynamic Translation Granularity & Contextual Prioritization

**Concept:** Instead of translating entire content items (paragraphs, sections) at once, break them down into smaller "semantic units" – phrases or clauses – and translate *those* individually.  Simultaneously, prioritize translation based on user focus – what the user is *currently* looking at.

**Specs:**

*   **Semantic Unit Segmentation:**  A natural language processing (NLP) module responsible for dividing content into semantic units.  This isn’t just splitting on punctuation; it needs to identify clauses and phrases with coherent meaning.  Parameters: Minimum unit length (e.g., 3 words), Maximum unit length (e.g., 20 words),  Contextual boundary detection (identifying where a semantic break *likely* occurs, even without perfect grammar). Output: List of semantic units with start/end character offsets within the original content.
*   **User Focus Tracking:**  Utilize eye-tracking (if hardware available) or cursor position/scroll position/mouse movement to determine what the user is actively viewing.  Calculate a "focus score" for each semantic unit based on its proximity to the user's focus point.
*   **Prioritized Translation Queue:** Maintain a queue of semantic units to be translated. The queue is sorted by the "focus score" – those the user is currently viewing have the highest priority.  Also include a "quality level" assigned to each unit, to allow for cascading translation (initially low quality, then higher).
*   **Dynamic Quality Adjustment:**  If the user dwells on a specific semantic unit for a certain duration (e.g., 3 seconds), automatically request a higher-quality translation for that unit.  This avoids wasting resources on translating content the user isn’t interested in.
*   **UI Integration:**
    *   Units should be rendered *incrementally* as translations become available.
    *   A visual indicator (subtle highlight, color change) shows which units have been translated, and their quality level.
    *   Users should have the option to *force* translation of specific units, overriding the prioritization logic.

**Pseudocode (Translation Loop):**

```
Initialize: Content = Original Content, Translation Queue = Empty

Loop:
  1. Update User Focus: Calculate Focus Score for each Semantic Unit in Content
  2. Prioritize Queue: Sort Translation Queue based on Focus Score (descending)
  3.  If Queue is empty:
        Segment Content into Semantic Units
        Add Semantic Units to Queue
  4.  Select Top N Semantic Units from Queue (N = user-defined concurrency)
  5. For each selected unit:
        If unit has not been translated OR last translation is below desired quality:
            Request Translation (Unit, Desired Quality)
        Receive Translation(Unit, Translation Result)
        Update UI(Unit, Translation Result)
        Remove Unit from Queue
```

**Possible Extensions:**

*   **Multimodal Prioritization:** Integrate data from other sensors (e.g., microphone – if the user is reading aloud) to refine the focus score.
*   **Personalized Translation Profiles:**  Adapt translation quality and style based on the user's language proficiency and preferences.
*   **Offline Translation Cache:** Store translated semantic units locally to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.

This moves beyond translating entire "chunks" of content, to a much more granular and responsive system. It also allows for efficient resource allocation, prioritizing the parts of the content the user is *actively* engaged with.
