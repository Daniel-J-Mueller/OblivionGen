## Adaptive Node Granularity for Contextual Drift

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on evaluating node *homogeneity*. This builds on that by dynamically adjusting the *granularity* of nodes themselves to maintain relevant homogeneity *over time*, specifically addressing contextual drift – where the meaning or relevance of information within a node changes.

**Specs:**

**1. Drift Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Node containing a plurality of items, a time-series of item metadata (creation date, source, user interaction data), descriptive term weighting from the existing system.
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate a "semantic drift score" for each item based on:
        *   Changes in item metadata over time (e.g., declining user engagement, obsolescence of source).
        *   Shifts in the weighted importance of descriptive terms associated with the item (calculated using a sliding window of recent time). A significant change in term weighting implies a shift in context.
    *   Aggregate item-level drift scores to produce a node-level drift score.
*   **Output:** Node drift score (float), item-level drift scores (list of floats).

**2. Granularity Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:** Node drift score, item-level drift scores, node containing a plurality of items, pre-defined granularity thresholds (low, medium, high), homogeneity threshold from existing system.
*   **Process:**
    *   **If** Node drift score exceeds a high threshold **then**:
        *   Split the node into sub-nodes based on item-level drift scores (items with high drift scores are seeded into new nodes). Utilize a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means) based on item similarity (based on descriptive term presence/weighting) to form cohesive sub-nodes.
    *   **Else if** Node drift score exceeds a medium threshold **then**:
        *   Identify outlier items (using existing outlier detection logic).  Move outliers to a dedicated “drift buffer” node.
    *   **Else if** Node drift score exceeds a low threshold **then**:
        *   Re-weight descriptive terms.  Down-weight terms associated with items exhibiting high drift.
    *   **Monitor** homogeneity of sub-nodes/drift buffer.  If homogeneity falls below a predefined threshold, recursively apply granularity adjustment.
*   **Output:** Adjusted node structure (potentially multiple sub-nodes and/or a drift buffer node), updated descriptive term weights.

**3. Contextual Enrichment Module:**

*   **Input:** Drift buffer node, external knowledge sources (e.g., news feeds, topic models).
*   **Process:**  Analyze the content of the drift buffer to identify emerging topics or changes in context. Enrich the original node (or sub-nodes) with information from the external knowledge sources to provide context for the drifting items.
*   **Output:**  Enriched node content (potentially updated descriptive terms, added metadata).

**Pseudocode (Granularity Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjustGranularity(node, driftScore, itemDriftScores, granularityThresholds):

    if driftScore > granularityThresholds["high"]:
        subNodes = splitNode(node, itemDriftScores)  // Use clustering algorithm
        return subNodes

    else if driftScore > granularityThresholds["medium"]:
        outlierItems = detectOutliers(node, itemDriftScores)
        driftBuffer = createNode(outlierItems)
        return [node, driftBuffer]

    else if driftScore > granularityThresholds["low"]:
        reweightedTerms = reweightDescriptiveTerms(node, itemDriftScores)
        updateNodeTerms(node, reweightedTerms)
        return [node]

    else:
        return [node]
```

**Innovation:**  The system isn't merely *evaluating* nodes; it's *adapting* their structure in response to dynamic information. This anticipates and mitigates the effects of contextual drift, maintaining the relevance and usefulness of knowledge over time. This builds on the existing system’s foundation of homogeneity assessment to enable a proactive, self-organizing knowledge structure.
