## Dynamic Data Masking with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand code execution to incorporate behavioral biometrics for *dynamic* data masking. Instead of simply excluding or transforming data based on context (location, access rights), the system continuously analyzes user behavior during interaction with data and adjusts masking *in real-time*. This goes beyond static rules to create a continuously adapting security layer.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Behavioral Analysis Module (BAM) integrated into the Code Execution Service.
*   **Data Input:** BAM receives streams of user interaction data: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, time spent on data elements, copy/paste actions, etc. This is captured on the client-side (browser/application) and transmitted securely.
*   **Model Training:** BAM utilizes machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) trained on *individual* user behavior profiles. This allows for highly personalized sensitivity analysis. Baseline behavior is established during initial interactions.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** BAM continuously compares current user behavior to the established baseline. Deviations from the baseline are scored as "anomaly levels."
*   **Dynamic Masking Levels:** Anomaly levels directly influence data masking.
    *   **Level 0 (Normal):** No masking. Data is displayed normally.
    *   **Level 1 (Slight Anomaly):** Redaction of sensitive fields (e.g., social security numbers, credit card details) with subtle blurring or replacement with asterisks.
    *   **Level 2 (Moderate Anomaly):** Increased redaction, pixelation of images, removal of metadata, data obfuscation (e.g., replacing names with aliases).
    *   **Level 3 (High Anomaly):** Complete data blocking, access denied, security alert triggered.
*   **Code Execution Integration:** When a request for data is received:
    1.  The request passes through the standard Code Execution Service.
    2.  Before data is returned, the request is routed to the BAM.
    3.  The BAM analyzes user behavior and assigns an anomaly level.
    4.  The Code Execution Service receives the anomaly level.
    5.  The service applies the corresponding masking level to the data before returning it to the user.
*   **Caching:** Anomaly scores and masked data can be cached (with appropriate security measures) to improve performance and reduce computational load.
*   **Scalability:** The BAM must be designed to handle a large number of concurrent users and data streams. Distributed processing and microservices architecture are recommended.

**Pseudocode (within Code Execution Service):**

```
function processDataRequest(request, dataObjectGroup):
    // ... standard data retrieval ...

    anomalyLevel = BehavioralAnalysisModule.getAnomalyLevel(request.userId, request.interactionData)

    if anomalyLevel == 0:
        responseData = dataObjectGroup // No masking
    else if anomalyLevel == 1:
        responseData = maskSensitiveFields(dataObjectGroup) //Redact
    else if anomalyLevel == 2:
        responseData = obfuscateData(dataObjectGroup) //Obfuscate
    else:
        responseData = null // Block Access

    return responseData
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   Privacy:  User behavior data must be collected and processed with strict adherence to privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). Anonymization and data minimization techniques should be employed.
*   False Positives:  Careful tuning of the machine learning models is necessary to minimize false positives (incorrectly flagging legitimate behavior as anomalous).
*   Adaptive Learning: The system should continuously learn and adapt to changing user behavior patterns over time.
*   Sensor Fusion: Incorporate data from multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones) to improve the accuracy of behavioral analysis. (With user consent, of course.)
