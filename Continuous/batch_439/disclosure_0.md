## Integrated Environmental Wellness Hub – “Aura”

**Concept:** Expand the functionality of a smoke/CO sensor beyond simple alerting. Create a localized environmental wellness hub, integrating air quality *and* biometric data to provide personalized insights and proactive safety measures. The physical design emphasizes calming aesthetics and subtle integration into living spaces.

**I. Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Core Sensor Suite:** Existing smoke/CO detection (compliant with UL 2115 & UL 2075 standards).
*   **Air Quality Module:**
    *   Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10) sensor (laser scattering).
    *   Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) sensor (metal oxide semiconductor).
    *   Humidity & Temperature sensor (capacitive).
    *   Carbon Dioxide (CO2) sensor (NDIR).
*   **Biometric Integration (Optional, User-Configurable):**
    *   Low-intensity radar module for heart rate & respiration rate detection (privacy-focused, no video capture). Range: 3-5 meters.
    *   Skin conductance sensor (integrated into optional wristband accessory, Bluetooth connected).
*   **Processing Unit:** ARM Cortex-A72 (or equivalent) – sufficient for local data processing & AI inference.
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2.
*   **Power:** AC adapter with battery backup (lithium-ion, 3+ days runtime).
*   **Enclosure:**
    *   Material: Bio-plastic composite with fabric cover (user-replaceable).
    *   Form Factor: Spherical or ovoid (approx. 15cm diameter).  Modular design for easy sensor replacement.
    *   Integrated ambient light (RGB LED, dimmable).
    *   E-ink display for status & basic information (low power consumption).
*   **Audio Output:** Small, high-quality speaker for alerts & notifications.

**II. Software & Functionality:**

*   **Local Data Processing:** All sensor data processed locally for privacy.  Aggregated data transmitted to cloud (optional, user consent required) for trend analysis & remote access.
*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Baseline establishment for each user based on historical data.
    *   Alerts triggered not just by threshold exceedance (e.g., high CO levels), but also by deviations from user’s established baseline (e.g., sudden increase in heart rate combined with elevated VOCs, potentially indicating a health issue).
    *   Machine learning algorithms to differentiate between normal activities and genuine emergencies.
*   **Wellness Insights:**
    *   Personalized recommendations based on air quality & biometric data (e.g., “Air quality is poor, consider closing windows and using an air purifier.”, “Your heart rate is elevated, consider taking a break.”).
    *   Long-term trend analysis and reporting.
*   **Smart Home Integration:** Compatibility with major smart home platforms (Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Alexa).
*   **Emergency Response:**
    *   Automatic notification to emergency services in case of critical events (e.g., high CO levels, prolonged lack of movement).
    *   Integration with smart locks and lighting systems to facilitate safe evacuation.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Mobile app for remote monitoring, configuration, and data analysis.
    *   Voice control integration.

**III. Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Define baseline data structure
struct BaselineData {
  float avgHeartRate;
  float stdDevHeartRate;
  float avgVOC;
  float stdDevVOC;
  // Add other relevant metrics
};

// Function to update baseline
function updateBaseline(heartRate, voc, baseline) {
  baseline.avgHeartRate = (baseline.avgHeartRate * 0.9) + (heartRate * 0.1);
  baseline.stdDevHeartRate = calculateStandardDeviation(historicalHeartRates); // Implement calculation
  // Update other metrics similarly
}

// Function to detect anomaly
function detectAnomaly(heartRate, voc, baseline) {
  // Calculate Z-scores for heart rate and VOC
  float heartRateZScore = (heartRate - baseline.avgHeartRate) / baseline.stdDevHeartRate;
  float vocZScore = (voc - baseline.avgVOC) / baseline.stdDevVOC;

  // Define anomaly thresholds (adjust as needed)
  float heartRateThreshold = 2.0;
  float vocThreshold = 2.0;

  // Check for anomalies
  if (abs(heartRateZScore) > heartRateThreshold || abs(vocZScore) > vocThreshold) {
    return true; // Anomaly detected
  } else {
    return false; // No anomaly
  }
}
```

**IV. Aesthetic Considerations:**

*   Organic shapes and soft materials to blend seamlessly into living spaces.
*   Subtle ambient lighting to provide calming visual cues.
*   Replaceable fabric covers to allow for customization and personalization.
*   Minimalist design to avoid drawing unwanted attention.
