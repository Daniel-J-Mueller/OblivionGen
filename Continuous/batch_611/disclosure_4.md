## Adaptive Temporal Masking for Multi-Camera Interference Rejection

**Concept:** Expand on the modulated light sensor idea, but instead of *just* detecting interference, actively shape the illumination patterns to minimize cross-talk *before* it happens. This leverages a dynamic, learned "temporal mask" applied to each camera's illumination schedule.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera equipped with:
        *   Standard ToF illuminator and sensor.
        *   Modulated light sensor array (as per patent), *plus* a dedicated, high-speed micro-controller.
        *   Micro-LED array overlaid on the standard illuminator. This array can modulate illumination intensity *per LED* with high precision. Resolution minimum: 64x64 LEDs.
        *   Dedicated communication channel (e.g. UWB radio) between cameras.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Initial Calibration Phase:** Cameras scan the environment passively, identifying potential interference sources (other cameras, strong light sources). This generates a baseline interference map.
    2.  **Dynamic Mask Generation:**
        *   Each camera's micro-controller continuously monitors the modulated light sensor array for interference signals.
        *   Based on detected interference, the micro-controller calculates a "temporal mask". This mask is a time-series array representing the intensity modulation pattern for each LED in the Micro-LED array.
        *   The goal of the mask is to minimize illumination *during* periods when another camera is actively illuminating that same area.  Think of it as a dynamic, spatial/temporal anti-aliasing filter for light.
        *   Algorithm: 
            ```pseudocode
            function generate_temporal_mask(interference_data, camera_schedule):
                mask = all_LEDs_ON // Initial state
                for each LED in LED_array:
                    for each time_slot in time_horizon:
                        if interference_data[time_slot] > threshold:
                            mask[LED, time_slot] = OFF // or reduced intensity
                        else:
                            mask[LED, time_slot] = ON
                return mask
            ```
    3.  **Illumination Control:** The micro-controller drives the Micro-LED array according to the calculated temporal mask, modulating the illumination pattern in real-time.
    4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Cameras exchange interference data and mask parameters via the UWB channel. They collaboratively refine their masks based on the observed performance of neighboring cameras.  A central coordinating algorithm could be implemented:
        ```pseudocode
        function collaborative_mask_refinement(camera_A_mask, camera_B_mask, interference_data):
            // Compare interference data received from camera B
            if camera_B_interference > threshold:
                // Adjust camera A mask to reduce conflict
                camera_A_mask = adjust_mask(camera_A_mask, camera_B_interference)
            return camera_A_mask
        ```

*   **Data Exchange Protocol:**
    *   Cameras broadcast basic information (ID, position, current illumination schedule) periodically.
    *   Upon detecting significant interference, cameras transmit detailed interference data (modulation frequency, intensity, time-of-arrival) to neighboring cameras.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Micro-LED array must have a fast refresh rate (kHz or higher) to achieve effective interference rejection.
    *   UWB communication range: 10-20 meters.
    *   Algorithm can be trained offline using simulated interference scenarios.



This approach moves beyond simply detecting interference to actively *shaping* the illumination to minimize it. The dynamic temporal mask provides a flexible and adaptive solution that can handle complex interference patterns in real-time.
