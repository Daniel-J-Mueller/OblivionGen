## Adaptive Content Routing Based on Biofeedback

**Specification:** A system extending the content routing concepts to incorporate real-time biofeedback from the user, dynamically adjusting content delivery *and* device selection based on emotional and cognitive state.

**Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor Integration:** Integration with wearable sensors (EEG, GSR, heart rate variability) to collect physiological data from the user.
*   **Real-Time State Analysis Module:**  An AI-powered module that analyzes the biofeedback data to determine the user's emotional (e.g., calm, stressed, excited) and cognitive (e.g., focused, distracted, fatigued) state.  This module uses pre-trained models and ongoing personalization.
*   **Content Adaptation Engine:** A module that dynamically modifies content *characteristics* (e.g., pacing, complexity, emotional tone, modality - visual/audio/tactile) based on the user’s state.  This goes beyond simply selecting different content; it *transforms* existing content.
*   **Device Prioritization Logic:** Logic that dynamically prioritizes output devices based on the user’s state and content type.  For example:
    *   High stress + complex information = prioritize audio output to reduce cognitive load.
    *   Low focus + visual content = prioritize haptic feedback on a wearable device to regain attention.
    *   Calm state + immersive experience = utilize a high-resolution display and surround sound.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** The system must integrate with environmental sensors (e.g., ambient light, noise level) and calendar information to provide even more nuanced adaptation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (user_active) {
    // Collect Data
    biofeedback_data = get_biofeedback_data()
    environmental_data = get_environmental_data()
    calendar_data = get_calendar_data()

    // Analyze State
    user_state = analyze_user_state(biofeedback_data, environmental_data, calendar_data) // Returns object with emotional & cognitive state.

    // Content Adaptation
    adapted_content = adapt_content(current_content, user_state) // Modifies content characteristics

    // Device Selection
    selected_device = select_device(adapted_content, user_state) // Chooses best output device.

    // Output Content
    output_content(adapted_content, selected_device)
}
```

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **State Analysis:** The AI model will be trained on a diverse dataset of biofeedback data correlated with labeled emotional and cognitive states. Continuous learning will refine the model for each individual user.
*   **Content Adaptation:** Adaptation techniques could include:
    *   **Pacing:** Adjusting the speed of narration or visual transitions.
    *   **Complexity:** Simplifying language or reducing visual clutter.
    *   **Emotional Tone:** Shifting the emotional valence of music or narration.
    *   **Modality Switching:** Dynamically switching between visual, audio, and haptic feedback.
*   **Device Prioritization:** The system will maintain a ranked list of available output devices, considering factors such as screen size, audio quality, and haptic capabilities. The ranking will be dynamically adjusted based on the user's state and the content type.
*   **API Integration:**  A robust API will allow integration with a wide range of content sources, biofeedback sensors, and output devices.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  All biofeedback data will be anonymized and securely stored, with user consent required for data collection and usage.
