## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Command Prioritization

**Concept:** Leveraging the external signaling device not just for command activation, but for establishing temporary, localized acoustic zones and prioritizing commands based on user proximity/context.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of miniature, directional microphones integrated into the primary device (speaker/mic apparatus). Minimum 4, optimally 8-16.
    *   External signaling device (button/soft button) with integrated Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio for precise location tracking (within centimeters).
    *   Primary device equipped with UWB receiver.
    *   Dedicated onboard DSP for beamforming and audio processing.
*   **Software/Logic:**
    *   **Zone Creation:** Upon receiving the signal from the external device, the system uses UWB data to calculate the user's location relative to the primary device.
    *   A dynamically adjustable ‘acoustic zone’ is established centered on the user’s location. This zone utilizes beamforming with the microphone array to focus audio capture towards the user and attenuate sounds from other directions. Zone size is configurable based on ambient noise and desired sensitivity.
    *   **Command Prioritization:** Incoming audio is analyzed *within* the defined acoustic zone. A confidence score is generated for any detected voice commands. Commands originating *outside* the zone are suppressed or given very low priority.
    *   **Multi-User Differentiation:** If multiple users are detected within range, the system attempts to differentiate them based on voice biometrics and UWB proximity data. Commands from the closest, authenticated user are prioritized.
    *   **Command Stacking/Sequencing:**  The system can interpret a sequence of commands as a single, complex operation. For example, “Dim lights, then play jazz” would be interpreted as a single unit.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** The system utilizes data from other sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) to infer user activity and adjust acoustic zone parameters. For example, if the user is walking, the zone may be widened and dynamically tracked.
    *    **Ambient Noise Filtering:**  Active noise cancellation adapted in real time based on zone definition.
*   **Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// External device sends signal
onSignalReceived() {
  userLocation = getUWBLocation();
  createAcousticZone(userLocation, zoneSize);
  focusMicrophoneArray(userLocation);
}

processAudio() {
  audioData = captureAudio();
  filteredAudio = applyAcousticZone(audioData);
  command = analyzeVoiceCommand(filteredAudio);
  if (command.confidence > threshold) {
    executeCommand(command);
  } else {
    discardCommand();
  }
}

createAcousticZone(location, size) {
  // Adjust microphone array beamforming parameters
  // based on user location and desired zone size.
  // Apply weighting to microphone signals to focus capture.
}

applyAcousticZone(audioData) {
  // Apply spatial filtering to attenuate sounds outside the zone.
  // Use beamforming weights to enhance sounds within the zone.
}
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simple command activation. It creates a personalized acoustic environment that improves command accuracy and reduces false positives, especially in noisy or multi-user settings.  The system adapts to the user's location and activity, offering a more intuitive and seamless voice control experience.
