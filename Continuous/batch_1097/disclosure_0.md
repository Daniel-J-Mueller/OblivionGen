## Satellite Swarm Orchestration via Distributed Ledger

**System Specs:** A distributed ledger (DLT) integrated into satellite onboard computing, facilitating autonomous swarm coordination and resource allocation.

**Components:**

*   **Satellite Node:** Each satellite possesses a lightweight DLT node (e.g., a permissioned blockchain) storing local state (resource availability - compute, storage, bandwidth, power - and task completion status).
*   **Ground Station Coordinator:** A ground station maintaining a ‘master’ copy of the DLT and initiating high-level tasks.
*   **Inter-Satellite Communication (ISC) Protocol:** Standardized ISC protocol for secure DLT transaction propagation.
*   **Smart Contracts:** Onboard smart contracts managing resource requests, task assignments, and conflict resolution.

**Operation:**

1.  **Task Initiation:** Ground station defines a task (e.g., wide-area imagery collection) and broadcasts a request to the swarm via the DLT.
2.  **Resource Negotiation:** Satellites analyze the task requirements and their available resources. They propose bids (in a standardized ‘credit’ system defined by the DLT) for task execution.
3.  **Task Allocation:** Smart contracts autonomously select the optimal satellite(s) based on bid price, resource availability, and task dependencies. Contracts mint ‘credits’ to the winning satellite(s).
4.  **Data Processing & Transmission:** Satellites perform payload operations. Processed data fragments are registered on the DLT.
5.  **Data Assembly:** Ground station retrieves data fragment metadata from the DLT and orchestrates data assembly/download.
6.  **Credit Settlement:** Credits earned by satellites are reconciled and used for resource replenishment or future task bidding.

**Pseudocode (Smart Contract - Task Allocation):**

```
contract TaskAllocator {

  struct Task {
    taskId: uint,
    requirements: { compute: uint, storage: uint, bandwidth: uint },
    reward: uint
  }

  mapping (uint => Task) public tasks;
  mapping (address => uint) public satelliteCredits;

  function createTask(uint taskId, uint compute, uint storage, uint bandwidth, uint reward) public {
    tasks[taskId] = Task(taskId, Task.requirements(compute, storage, bandwidth), reward);
  }

  function bidForTask(uint taskId, uint price) public {
    require(tasks[taskId].reward > price, "Bid too high");
    // Logic to verify satellite resources meet task requirements
    // Update satellite credit balance
    satelliteCredits[msg.sender] -= price;
  }

  function allocateTask(uint taskId) public {
    // Find the lowest bidder
    // Verify resource availability
    // Mint credits to the winning bidder
    // Update task status
  }
}
```

**Refinement:** Integrate a reputation system based on task completion quality. Allow satellites to ‘stake’ credits to increase bidding priority. Enable dynamic task decomposition for parallel processing across the swarm. Explore using zero-knowledge proofs for secure resource verification.
