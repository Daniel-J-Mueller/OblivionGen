## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System – “AirTouch”

**System Overview:**

This system expands on the concept of sensing objects external to a screen by adding dynamically generated, localized air pressure changes to simulate tactile feedback *without* physical contact. It leverages the external sensor array from the base patent, but instead of *just* predicting intent or displaying visual cues, it creates miniature, focused ‘air jets’ or localized low-pressure zones.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Sensor Grid:** Existing sensor grid as described in the patent – Infrared/Ultrasonic array.
*   **Micro-Airjet Array:** A dense array of micro-pumps and nozzles positioned *around* the screen edges, facing inwards.  Each nozzle is independently controllable.  Consider piezoelectric micro-pumps for fast response times.
*   **Pressure Sensors:**  Miniature pressure sensors embedded within the screen bezel to monitor and calibrate air pressure distribution.
*   **Processing Unit:**  High-speed processor to manage sensor data, calculate airjet activation patterns, and control the micro-pumps.

**Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Object Tracking:** Sensor grid tracks the object’s position and velocity.
2.  **Haptic Profile Selection:** Based on the application and the object being tracked, a ‘haptic profile’ is loaded.  These profiles define the desired tactile sensation (e.g., “soft brush,” “firm push,” “textured surface”).
3.  **Airjet Activation:**  Algorithm calculates the precise airjet activation pattern needed to simulate the haptic profile at the object’s perceived contact point on the screen.  This requires real-time adjustment of airjet intensity and direction.
4.  **Pressure Calibration:**  Pressure sensors provide feedback, allowing the system to dynamically calibrate the airjet array and compensate for environmental factors (e.g., air currents, temperature).
5.  **Intensity Mapping:** The system will not simply *create* pressure. It will map intensity based on movement. For example, if something moves quickly across the surface, the 'touch' becomes lighter. Conversely, slow, deliberate motion will result in a more firm sensation.

**Pseudocode (Core Airjet Control Loop):**

```
loop:
  object_data = sensor_grid.get_object_data() // Position, velocity, size
  haptic_profile = application.get_haptic_profile(object_data)

  target_pressure_map = haptic_profile.generate_pressure_map(object_data)

  // Calculate airjet activation levels based on target pressure map
  airjet_levels = calculate_airjet_levels(target_pressure_map, screen_dimensions)

  // Activate airjets
  airjet_array.activate(airjet_levels)

  // Read pressure sensor data
  pressure_data = pressure_sensors.read_data()

  // Calibrate airjet array based on pressure data
  calibration_factor = calibrate_airjet_array(pressure_data)
  apply_calibration(calibration_factor)

  delay(1ms) // Update loop frequency
end loop
```

**Applications:**

*   **Gaming:**  Simulate the feel of weapons, textures, and impacts without a controller.
*   **Design/CAD:**  Provide tactile feedback when manipulating 3D models.
*   **Accessibility:**  Allow visually impaired users to “feel” on-screen elements.
*   **Medical Training:**  Simulate surgical procedures with realistic tactile feedback.
*   **Remote Manipulation:**  Provide haptic feedback for controlling robots or drones remotely.
