## Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' for Proactive User Experience Management

**Concept:** Extend the adverse event impact assessment to *proactively* simulate user experience degradation *before* events fully manifest, and personalize remediation beyond simple redirection.

**Specs:**

1.  **Baseline Performance Profiling:**
    *   Continuously monitor user network traffic (as per patent claims 2-4) to establish baseline performance metrics: latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput. Store historical data – minimum 30 days, ideally 90+.
    *   Create a per-user ‘experience profile’ – a statistical model of expected performance. This model is dynamic, adapting to user behavior (time of day, application usage, etc.).
    *   Weight performance metrics based on application type. (e.g., real-time video conferencing is *much* more sensitive to latency/jitter than email).

2.  **Predictive Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Monitor network telemetry (device CPU/memory, link utilization, queue depths) in addition to traffic data.
    *   Employ a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, time series forecasting) to *predict* potential network degradations *before* they impact users. This model is trained on historical telemetry *and* historical incident data. The goal is to predict resource saturation or link congestion.
    *   Develop a ‘confidence score’ for each prediction. (e.g., 80% probability of increased latency on path X within 5 minutes).

3.  **Simulated Experience Degradation:**
    *   When a predictive anomaly is detected (above a configurable threshold), *simulate* the predicted degradation for the user. This is done *before* the real event occurs.
    *   Inject artificial latency, packet loss, or bandwidth limitation into the user's traffic stream, mimicking the predicted impact. (This can be done in a sandbox environment or using virtual network functions (VNFs)). The level of simulation is based on the confidence score and predicted severity.
    *   Monitor the user’s application performance *during* the simulation. (Are they experiencing buffering? Failed connections? Increased response times?).

4.  **Personalized Remediation Engine:**
    *   Based on the simulated experience and observed application behavior, the system selects the *optimal* remediation strategy, which goes beyond simple traffic redirection (claim 10).
    *   Remediation options:
        *   **Adaptive Codec Selection:**  For video conferencing, dynamically switch to a lower-bandwidth codec.
        *   **Application Prioritization:** Increase priority for critical applications (e.g., VoIP) at the expense of less critical ones.
        *   **QoS Adjustment:** Adjust Quality of Service (QoS) settings on network devices.
        *   **Pre-emptive CDN Caching:**  If the predicted issue affects content delivery, proactively cache content closer to the user.
        *   **Dynamic DNS Resolution:**  If a DNS server is predicted to be overloaded, dynamically switch to a different, healthy server.
    *   The system *learns* which remediation strategies are most effective for each user and application through reinforcement learning.

5.  **User Notification & Control:**
    *   Notify the user about the predicted issue and the remediation actions being taken.
    *   Allow the user to override the automated actions or specify their preferred remediation strategy.

**Pseudocode (Remediation Engine):**

```
function select_remediation(user_profile, predicted_issue, application_type):
  remediation_options = get_available_remediations(application_type)
  best_option = null
  highest_reward = -infinity

  for option in remediation_options:
    simulated_impact = simulate_remediation(user_profile, option, predicted_issue)
    reward = calculate_reward(simulated_impact, user_preferences) #User preferences pulled from profile

    if reward > highest_reward:
      highest_reward = reward
      best_option = option

  return best_option
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `User_Profile`: Contains historical performance data, application usage patterns, preferred remediation strategies, and QoS profiles.
*   `Predicted_Issue`:  Contains details about the predicted network degradation (location, severity, duration).
*   `Remediation_Option`:  Describes a specific remediation strategy (e.g., codec switch, QoS adjustment) and its associated parameters.
