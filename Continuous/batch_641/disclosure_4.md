## Autonomous Vehicle Interior Ecosystem - “Mood Weaver”

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A multi-modal sensor array integrated into the autonomous vehicle's cabin. Includes:
    *   High-resolution, low-light cameras (x4 – forward, rear, side, overhead)
    *   Microphone array (minimum 8 elements) for spatial audio capture
    *   Bio-metric sensors embedded in seat cushions and steering wheel (heart rate variability, skin conductance, subtle muscle tension – optional)
    *   Environmental sensors (cabin temperature, humidity, air quality)
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge computing device (high-performance GPU and CPU) within the vehicle.  Local processing prioritised, with cloud connectivity for model updates and data aggregation (anonymised).
*   **Actuator Network:**
    *   Dynamic ambient lighting system (full RGB spectrum, individually addressable LEDs)
    *   Integrated aromatherapy diffuser (cartridge-based, multiple scent options)
    *   Haptic feedback system in seats and steering wheel
    *   Sound system capable of spatial audio reproduction
    *   Climate control system with zonal temperature adjustment
    *   Window tinting – electrochromic glass capable of variable opacity.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Mood Recognition Engine:** AI model trained on multi-modal data (video, audio, biometric) to infer passenger emotional state.  Includes:
        *   Facial expression recognition
        *   Voice tone and sentiment analysis
        *   Biometric data analysis (stress, relaxation, engagement)
        *   Contextual awareness (time of day, location, route)
    *   **Ecosystem Control Module:**  Translates inferred emotional state into actuator commands. Utilizes pre-defined “Moodscapes” (see below) and allows for customisation.
    *   **Moodscape Library:** A collection of pre-configured environmental settings (“Moodscapes”) designed to enhance or modify passenger mood. Examples:
        *   **“Zen Mode”:** Soft blue lighting, calming ambient music, lavender scent, gentle seat massage, stable climate.
        *   **“Energy Boost”:** Bright white lighting, upbeat music, citrus scent, invigorating climate control, dynamic seat adjustments.
        *   **“Focus Zone”:** Cool white lighting, minimal ambient sound, peppermint scent, firm seat support, consistent climate.
        *   **“Social Spark”:** Warm, vibrant lighting, upbeat music, energising scent, comfortable climate.
    *   **Learning & Adaptation:** System continuously learns passenger preferences and adjusts Moodscape parameters accordingly.

LOOP:
    CAPTURE multi-modal data (video, audio, biometric, environment)
    ANALYZE data using Mood Recognition Engine -> DETERMINE passenger emotional state
    IF emotional state deviates from PREFERRED state:
        SELECT appropriate Moodscape based on desired emotional shift
        APPLY Moodscape settings to actuator network (lighting, audio, scent, haptics, climate)
    ELSE:
        MAINTAIN current settings
    RECORD data for learning & adaptation
    UPDATE passenger preference profile based on observed responses
END LOOP
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

This system moves beyond simple pre-set configurations and creates a genuinely responsive and dynamic cabin environment.  The combination of multi-modal sensing, AI-driven emotion recognition, and precise actuator control allows for real-time mood modulation. This could significantly enhance passenger comfort, reduce stress, and improve the overall autonomous vehicle experience.  Furthermore, the data collected could be anonymised and used to develop more effective therapeutic interventions for stress and anxiety.
