## Adaptive Content 'Bubbles' – Location & Social Proximity

**Concept:** Extend location-based decryption to create ephemeral, shared content experiences. Instead of solely unlocking content based on proximity to a fixed reference object, dynamically generate and distribute 'content bubbles' visible to users within a localized, socially-defined radius. Content within these bubbles is encrypted and only decryptable by devices within the bubble *and* possessing specific social connections (e.g., friends list, group membership).

**Specs:**

*   **Device Requirements:** Media device with location sensor, communication module (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, UWB), secure element for key storage, display.
*   **Bubble Creation:** A 'Bubble Host' user designates a location (GPS coordinates) and a radius (configurable, e.g., 5m to 100m). They also define content (video, audio, images, text) and access rules based on social graph data.
*   **Content Encryption:** Content is encrypted using a symmetric key. This key is *not* transmitted directly. Instead, a key derivation function (KDF) utilizes a shared secret (derived from mutual social connections between the Bubble Host and potential viewers) and location data as inputs. The location data ensures that the derived key is only valid within the bubble's radius.
*   **Bubble Discovery & Joining:** Devices continuously scan for active bubbles. Upon detecting a bubble, the device compares its social graph with the bubble’s access rules. If authorized, the device calculates the derived decryption key using its location and the shared secrets.
*   **Dynamic Key Refresh:** The decryption key is refreshed periodically (e.g., every 5-15 seconds) using updated location data, preventing replay attacks and maintaining security as users move within the bubble.
*   **Content Persistence:** Content within a bubble is ephemeral. Once the Bubble Host terminates the bubble or exits the defined radius, the content is automatically deleted from all viewers’ devices. The decryption key becomes invalid, rendering the content inaccessible.
*   **Social Graph Integration:** The system leverages existing social networking APIs (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, custom platforms) to manage user connections and facilitate secure key derivation.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A mesh network protocol (e.g., Bluetooth Mesh, Wi-Fi Direct) is employed to facilitate communication between devices within the bubble, enabling content sharing and key synchronization.

**Pseudocode (Decryption Process - Device within Bubble):**

```
function decryptContent(encryptedContent):
  location = getLocationData()
  socialConnections = getSocialConnections()
  bubbleInfo = getBubbleInfo()  // Retrieved from bubble broadcast

  if (isValidBubble(location, bubbleInfo)):
    sharedSecret = deriveSharedSecret(socialConnections, bubbleInfo)
    derivedKey = KDF(sharedSecret, location)
    decryptedContent = decrypt(encryptedContent, derivedKey)
    return decryptedContent
  else:
    return "Content Unavailable"
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Localized augmented reality experiences
*   Ephemeral social events (e.g., concerts, festivals)
*   Interactive storytelling within physical spaces
*   Secret messaging and private content sharing in crowded areas
*   Location-based gaming experiences.
