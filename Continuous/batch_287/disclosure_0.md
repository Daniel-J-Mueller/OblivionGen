## Adaptive Network Address 'Shadowing' for Predictive Security

**Concept:** Extend the range-based storage to include ‘shadow’ ranges – predicted future address allocations. This allows for proactive security policy application *before* addresses are officially assigned, mitigating certain types of attacks and simplifying network provisioning.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Structure Extension:** The core range storage (bit fields, hash tables, range trees – use existing implementation) will support a ‘time-to-live’ (TTL) field for each range entry. This TTL indicates the predicted validity duration of the range.
*   **Predictive Input:** A dedicated input stream (API, message queue) will receive predictions of future address allocations. These predictions may originate from:
    *   DHCP lease forecasting.
    *   VM/Container orchestration systems (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) – anticipating address needs for newly deployed instances.
    *   Manual configuration inputs from network administrators.
*   **Shadow Range Creation:** Upon receiving a prediction, a ‘shadow’ range entry is created in the storage system. This entry is marked as ‘inactive’ or ‘predicted.’
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Security policies (firewall rules, intrusion detection signatures) can be configured to apply to both active *and* predicted ranges. This allows the system to block malicious traffic targeting addresses *before* they are officially assigned.
*   **Range Activation/Deactivation:**  When an address is officially allocated (e.g., DHCP lease granted), the corresponding shadow range is activated. Conversely, when an address is released, the range is deactivated or removed.
*   **TTL Management:** A background process monitors TTL values. Expired shadow ranges are automatically removed or marked for review.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /predictions`:  Submit a new address range prediction (range, TTL, source).
    *   `GET /ranges?status=predicted`:  Retrieve a list of currently predicted ranges.
    *   `PUT /ranges/{range_id}/activate`:  Activate a predicted range.
    *   `DELETE /ranges/{range_id}`: Deactivate/Remove a range.

**Pseudocode (Range Activation/Deactivation Logic):**

```
function activateRange(range_id):
  range = getRangeById(range_id)
  if range.status == "predicted":
    range.status = "active"
    applySecurityPolicies(range) // Enforce policies
    log("Range activated: " + range_id)
  else:
    log("Error: Range " + range_id + " is not in 'predicted' state.")

function deactivateRange(range_id):
  range = getRangeById(range_id)
  if range.status == "active":
    range.status = "inactive"
    removeSecurityPolicies(range) // Release policies
    log("Range deactivated: " + range_id)
  else:
    log("Error: Range " + range_id + " is not in 'active' state.")
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Proactive security against attacks targeting unassigned addresses.
*   Simplified network provisioning – policies can be applied before addresses are live.
*   Reduced latency for security policy enforcement.
*   Improved network visibility – tracking predicted address usage.
