## Temporal Data Reconstruction with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the buffering and translation system to not just maintain compatibility with older schema versions, but proactively *reconstruct* data as if it *always* existed in the current schema, even before the schema change. This leverages prediction to minimize translation overhead and provide a seamless user experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Predictive Buffer:** Introduce a “Predictive Buffer” alongside the existing “Legacy Buffer”. The Predictive Buffer holds data reconstructed *as if* the current schema was always in effect.

2.  **Schema Change Event Listener:** Implement a listener that triggers reconstruction upon schema change. This listener analyzes the change and determines how to map data from the old schema to the new.

3.  **Reconstruction Engine:**
    *   Input: Old schema data, Schema Change Delta (describing the change).
    *   Process:
        *   Analyze the schema change delta.
        *   For each data item, determine the necessary transformations to map it to the current schema.
        *   Apply these transformations, creating a new data item conforming to the current schema.
        *   Store the reconstructed data item in the Predictive Buffer.

4.  **Hybrid Read Path:** Implement a hybrid read path:
    *   First check the Predictive Buffer. If the data exists there, serve it directly.
    *   If the data is not in the Predictive Buffer, check the Legacy Buffer.
    *   If the data is in the Legacy Buffer, translate it *on the fly* and serve it.
    *   Simultaneously, store the translated data in the Predictive Buffer for future requests.

5.  **Sequence Number Synchronization:** Maintain synchronization between sequence numbers in all buffers (Legacy, Predictive). A global sequence number manager ensures consistent ordering.

6.  **Intelligent Prefetching:**  Monitor client request patterns. If a client repeatedly requests data that requires on-the-fly translation, proactively reconstruct that data and store it in the Predictive Buffer.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Engine):**

```
function reconstructData(oldData, schemaChangeDelta) {
  newData = oldData.copy()

  for each transformation in schemaChangeDelta {
    if (transformation.type == "rename") {
      newData[transformation.newFieldName] = newData[transformation.oldFieldName]
      delete newData[transformation.oldFieldName]
    } else if (transformation.type == "split") {
      // Example: split "name" field into "firstName" and "lastName"
      parts = newData["name"].split(" ")
      newData["firstName"] = parts[0]
      newData["lastName"] = parts[1]
      delete newData["name"]
    } else if (transformation.type == "aggregate") {
      // Combine fields
      newData["fullName"] = newData["firstName"] + " " + newData["lastName"]
      delete newData["firstName"]
      delete newData["lastName"]
    }
  }

  return newData
}
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Resource Management:** Implement mechanisms to limit the size of the Predictive Buffer and prevent excessive memory usage.
*   **Data Consistency:** Ensure data consistency between buffers, particularly during schema changes.
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Develop strategies to handle conflicts that may arise during data reconstruction.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to scale horizontally to handle large volumes of data and high request rates.
