## Adaptive Morphology Container – Specs

**Core Concept:** A foldable container with dynamically adjustable internal volume *and* external shape, moving beyond simple expansion/contraction to accommodate irregular or shifting payloads. Leveraging shape memory alloys and a network of internal actuators.

**I. Structural Components:**

*   **Frame:** Constructed from high-strength aluminum alloy with integrated channels for actuator wiring and shape memory alloy (SMA) cabling. Modular segments for repair/replacement.
*   **Panels:**  Multi-layered composite material. Outer layer: abrasion-resistant polymer. Middle layer: embedded SMA wires arranged in a grid pattern. Inner layer: flexible, food-grade liner.
*   **Actuators:** Miniature linear actuators (servo or pneumatic) positioned at key frame junctions, providing initial movement and force amplification.
*   **Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) Network:**  Dense grid of pre-stressed SMA wires woven *through* the composite panels. Controlled by individual electrical currents, allowing for localized deformation and shape alteration.
*   **Sensors:**  Array of strain gauges and proximity sensors integrated into the frame and panels, providing real-time feedback on container shape, load distribution, and potential stress points.
*   **Control Unit:** Embedded microcontroller with wireless communication capabilities. Receives sensor data, executes control algorithms, and manages actuator/SMA activation.
*   **Power Source:** High-capacity rechargeable battery pack integrated into the base of the container. Optional solar charging capability.

**II. Operational Parameters:**

*   **Volume Adjustment:** Container volume dynamically adjusts from 50% to 200% of standard capacity.
*   **Morphological Adaptation:**  Container capable of morphing its shape to conform to irregularly shaped payloads. Examples: extending a ‘neck’ to accommodate a tall object, widening one side to avoid obstacles, creating internal partitions to isolate delicate items.
*   **Load Balancing:** Internal sensors detect load distribution and automatically adjust SMA activation to maintain stability.
*   **Obstacle Avoidance:**  Proximity sensors detect obstacles in the container's path and adjust container shape to navigate around them.
*   **Self-Repair:**  In case of minor panel damage, SMA activation can be used to pull damaged sections back into alignment.
*   **Stacking Protocol:** Container can adapt its upper surface to create a stable interlocking connection with other adapted containers, maximizing storage density.

**III. Control Algorithm – Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION AdaptContainer(PayloadShape, ObstacleMap)

  // 1. Analyze Payload Shape:
  PayloadData = GetPayloadShape(Payload); // Returns 3D data of payload
  TargetVolume = CalculateTargetVolume(PayloadData);

  // 2. Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:
  ObstacleData = GetObstacleMap(Environment); // Returns data of obstacles
  SafePath = PlanSafePath(ObstacleData);

  // 3. Volume Adjustment:
  AdjustContainerVolume(TargetVolume);  // Activates actuators to adjust overall size

  // 4. Morphological Adaptation:
  FOR each point in PayloadData DO
    TargetPoint = TransformToContainerCoordinates(point);
    ActivateSMA(TargetPoint, DeformationAmount); // Adjusts panel shape locally
  END FOR

  // 5. Load Balancing
  FOR each Sensor in SensorArray DO
    Load = Sensor.GetLoad();
    IF Load > Threshold THEN
      ActivateSMA(SensorLocation, CounterLoadAmount);
    END IF
  END FOR

  // 6. Stack Stabilization
  IF IsStacking() THEN
    AdjustUpperSurface(StackingProtocol);
  END IF

END FUNCTION
```
