## Adaptive Schema Evolution with Conditional Updates

**Concept:** Extend the conditional update system to dynamically evolve the schema of items within the non-relational data store *based* on the conditions being met or unmet during update requests. This moves beyond simply updating values *within* a fixed schema, to *changing* the schema itself on the fly, enabling a truly flexible data model.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Schema Definition Language (SDL):** A lightweight SDL for describing item schema evolution rules. This SDL should integrate with the existing conditional update logic. Rules will define how the schema changes when certain update conditions are met or unmet. Example SDL snippet:

```sdl
item: UserProfile
condition: age > 65
action: add attribute "retirement_plan" type String
condition: last_login < 30 days ago
action: remove attribute "active_subscription"
```

2.  **Conditional Schema Update Module:** A new module within the storage engine responsible for interpreting SDL rules and executing schema changes. This module should:
    *   Parse SDL rules associated with a given table.
    *   Intercept conditional update requests.
    *   Evaluate if any SDL rules apply based on the request's condition.
    *   Execute the schema changes (adding/removing attributes) *atomically* with the data update.
    *   Manage schema versioning to avoid conflicts.

3.  **Atomic Schema Modification:** Crucially, schema modifications *must* be atomic with the data updates. This prevents inconsistencies where data exists for attributes that arenâ€™t yet defined in the schema, or vice versa. Use optimistic locking and/or multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) to achieve this.

4.  **Schema Discovery API:** An API endpoint allowing clients to discover the current schema of a table. This ensures clients can adapt to schema changes without hardcoding assumptions. Response should include attribute names, types, and optional metadata.

5.  **Eventing System:** An eventing system to notify clients about schema changes. Clients can subscribe to events for specific tables and react accordingly. (e.g., cache invalidation, UI updates)

**Pseudocode (Conditional Schema Update Module):**

```pseudocode
function processUpdateRequest(request, item):
  // 1. Access schema rules for item's table
  schemaRules = getSchemaRules(item.table)

  // 2. Evaluate update condition
  conditionMet = evaluateCondition(request.condition)

  // 3. Identify applicable schema rules
  applicableRules = filterRules(schemaRules, conditionMet)

  // 4. Apply schema changes (atomically with data update)
  beginAtomicTransaction()
  try:
    for rule in applicableRules:
      if rule.action == "add_attribute":
        addAttribute(item, rule.attributeName, rule.attributeType)
      elif rule.action == "remove_attribute":
        removeAttribute(item, rule.attributeName)

    // Perform data update
    updateItemData(item, request.updates)
    commitTransaction()

  catch Exception as e:
    rollbackTransaction()
    raise e

  // 5. Publish schema change event
  publishSchemaChangeEvent(item.table, applicableRules)
```

**Novelty:** This is distinct from standard schema migrations because the schema evolution is driven by real-time data updates and their associated conditions. It creates a *reactive* schema, rather than a *proactive* one. It enables highly dynamic and personalized data models, optimized for individual item characteristics. It's a shift from schema-first to data-first design.
