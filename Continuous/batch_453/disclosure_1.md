## Adaptive Contextual ‘Echo’ for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend the contextual sharing paradigm to *proactively* anticipate user needs based on ‘echoes’ of past interactions, even across seemingly unrelated tasks. This moves beyond simply *using* context for a specific request to *building* a predictive model of user intent.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** ‘Echo Store’ – A distributed key-value store. Keys are user IDs + a hashed representation of the contextual information (see below). Values are time-stamped lists of contextual data ‘fragments’.
*   **Contextual Fragment:** A lightweight data structure representing a single piece of relevant contextual information. Example: `{type: "entity", value: "Italian Restaurant", confidence: 0.85, modality: "audio"}`.  Other types include: `action`, `parameter`, `preference`.
*   **Hashing Function:**  A Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) function is applied to the contextual fragments.  This groups similar contexts together, even if they aren't exact matches. The hash is used as the key in the Echo Store.
*   **Echo Generation:** After *every* user interaction, relevant contextual fragments are extracted and added to the Echo Store using the LSH key. This happens *even if* the fragments seem unrelated to the current task.
*   **Proactive Matching:** When a new user request comes in, the system performs speech recognition and extracts initial contextual fragments. It then queries the Echo Store using LSH to find similar contexts from the user’s past.
*   **Intent Prediction & Suggestion:** Based on the matched echoes, the system predicts likely user intents beyond the immediate request. It then proactively suggests relevant actions or information.
*   **Modality Bridging:** The system attempts to bridge modalities. For example, if a past audio interaction involved a map location, and the current request is text-based, the system might proactively display a map snippet.
*   **Confidence Scoring:**  Each suggestion is assigned a confidence score based on the strength of the echo match, the recency of the past interaction, and the user’s historical acceptance rate of similar suggestions.
*   **User Feedback Loop:** The system tracks user acceptance or rejection of suggestions, and uses this data to refine the echo matching process and improve prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Suggestion Engine):**

```
function generateProactiveSuggestions(user_id, speech_recognition_results):
  initial_context_fragments = extractContextFragments(speech_recognition_results)
  lsh_key = hashContextFragments(initial_context_fragments)
  echoes = queryEchoStore(user_id, lsh_key) // Returns list of relevant echoes

  potential_intents = []
  for echo in echoes:
    intent = predictIntent(echo) //Predict intent based on past interaction
    potential_intents.append((intent, echo.confidence))

  sorted_intents = sortIntentsByConfidence(potential_intents)

  suggestions = []
  for intent, confidence in sorted_intents[:3]: //Return top 3 suggestions
    suggestion = generateSuggestion(intent)
    suggestions.append(suggestion)

  return suggestions
```

**Novelty:** The emphasis on *proactive* intent prediction based on echoes of *all* past interactions, rather than simply leveraging context within a single dialog. This introduces a ‘memory’ component to the dialog system that enables it to anticipate user needs beyond the immediate task, and to bridge modalities in a more seamless way. The LSH keying strategy allows for flexible matching of similar contexts, even if they aren’t exact matches.
