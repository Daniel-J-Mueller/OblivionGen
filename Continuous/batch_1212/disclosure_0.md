## Dynamic Puzzle Difficulty via AI-Driven Piece Morphing

**Concept:** Expand the core puzzle mechanic by allowing individual puzzle pieces to *slightly* morph in shape and texture in real-time, guided by an AI assessing player performance. This introduces a dynamic difficulty adjustment that isn't simply about reducing the number of pieces or altering the image. It creates an emergent gameplay experience where pieces subtly ‘help’ or ‘hinder’ placement.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** An AI difficulty engine (ADE) monitoring player actions: time taken per piece placement, number of incorrect attempts, areas of the puzzle with longest engagement, and player pause frequency.
*   **Morphing Parameters:** Each puzzle piece is represented as a mesh with editable control points. The ADE subtly adjusts these control points, altering the piece's shape within a narrow tolerance (e.g., 2-5% deviation from the original).  Texture can also be subtly altered – blurring, sharpening, minor color shifts – to affect edge detection.
*   **Morphing Types:**
    *   **Assist Morph:**  If the player struggles, the ADE applies slight ‘easing’ morphs to pieces in the problematic area, making edges more obviously complementary to surrounding pieces.
    *   **Challenge Morph:** If the player excels, the ADE introduces more irregular morphs, making pieces less immediately obvious to place. This could even introduce very subtle ‘false fits’ – edges that *almost* match, creating momentary confusion.
    *   **Adaptive Texture:** ADE dynamically adjusts the texture of the edges, making them more or less distinguishable.
*   **Game Interface Integration:**  A hidden ‘difficulty scale’ visually representing the level of morphing applied.  This should *not* be directly exposed to the player.
*   **Image Processing Pipeline:**  Original image is pre-processed to identify key features and edges. This data is used by the ADE to ensure morphing doesn't create impossible fits or visually jarring inconsistencies.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Morphing calculations are performed on a dedicated thread to avoid impacting the main game loop. Mesh complexity is dynamically adjusted based on the device's capabilities.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Game Loop
while (puzzleNotSolved) {
    processPlayerInput()
    updateGameWorld()

    // Difficulty Adjustment Thread
    difficultyEngine.analyzePlayerPerformance(playerData)
    morphingParams = difficultyEngine.calculateMorphingParameters()

    for each piece in puzzlePieces {
        piece.applyMorph(morphingParams)
    }

    renderPuzzle()
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PlayerData`:  `timePerPiece`, `incorrectAttempts`, `engagementArea`, `pauseFrequency`.
*   `MorphingParams`: `shapeDeviation`, `textureBlur`, `textureSharpen`, `falseFitProbability`.
*   `PuzzlePiece`:  `mesh`, `texture`, `originalShape`, `currentShape`.
