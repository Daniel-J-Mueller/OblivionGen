## Dynamic Content 'Shells' & Procedural Detail Generation

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive content delivery concept beyond simple format (resolution, audio channels) adjustments. Implement a system where content isn't merely *delivered* in different formats, but fundamentally *re-authored* at delivery via procedural generation techniques driven by device capabilities *and* real-time environmental data.

**Specifications:**

*   **Content Structure:** All core content will be authored with a layered structure. Think base 'story beats', core character models, primary audio tracks, and a 'procedural generation directive' (PGD) file accompanying each asset. PGDs contain rules, parameters, and data ranges governing how the asset can be modified.
*   **Environmental Sensor Integration:** Devices will optionally provide environmental data to the content server: ambient lighting, detected noise levels, detected movement, proximity to other devices, and even biometric data (if user-approved and privacy-compliant).
*   **Procedural Generation Engine (Server-Side):** A robust server-side engine that interprets PGDs and uses environmental data to dynamically generate content variations. 
*   **‘Shell’ System:**  Content is delivered as a ‘shell’ – a minimal base package – combined with instructions to request procedural variations from the server.
*   **Real-Time Variation Request:** Device requests variations based on current capabilities *and* environmental data. Server generates the necessary assets in real-time.
*   **Caching & Prefetching:** Heavily optimized caching system for frequently requested variations. Prefetching of potential variations based on predicted user behavior and location.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Server-Side Variation Generation):**

```
function generateContentVariation(contentID, deviceCapabilities, environmentalData) {
  // 1. Load Core Content & PGD
  coreContent = loadCoreContent(contentID);
  pgd = loadPGD(contentID);

  // 2. Apply Device Capability Modifiers
  resolution = determineResolution(deviceCapabilities.screenResolution, pgd.resolutionRanges);
  audioChannels = determineAudioChannels(deviceCapabilities.audioChannels, pgd.audioChannelRanges);
  textureQuality = determineTextureQuality(deviceCapabilities.gpuPerformance, pgd.textureQualityRanges);

  // 3. Apply Environmental Modifiers
  ambientLightModifier = map(environmentalData.ambientLightLevel, 0, 100, -0.2, 0.2); // Adjust color temperature based on ambient light
  noiseLevelModifier = map(environmentalData.noiseLevel, 0, 80, -0.1, 0.1); // Subtle audio adjustments to mask or enhance noise
  motionModifier = environmentalData.motionDetected ? 0.1 : 0.0; // Add slight camera shake during detected motion

  // 4. Procedural Generation
  generatedTexture = applyProceduralTexture(coreContent.texture, textureQuality, ambientLightModifier);
  generatedAudio = applyProceduralAudio(coreContent.audio, audioChannels, noiseLevelModifier);
  generatedScene = applyProceduralScene(coreContent.scene, motionModifier);

  // 5. Return Generated Content
  return {
    texture: generatedTexture,
    audio: generatedAudio,
    scene: generatedScene
  };
}
```

**Example Use Case:** A horror game.

*   On a high-end device in a quiet room: The game delivers a highly detailed visual experience with immersive 7.1 surround sound.
*   On a low-end device in a noisy environment: The game delivers a simplified visual experience with a focus on impactful audio cues designed to cut through the background noise. Procedural generation may adjust the visual style to be more abstract or minimalist to reduce rendering load.
*   If the device detects nearby players: Procedural generation could introduce new gameplay elements or dynamically adjust the difficulty to encourage cooperative play.
