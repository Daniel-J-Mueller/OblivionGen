## Dynamic Neural Network Re-Routing with Predictive Branching

**Concept:** Extend the conditional execution concept to proactively predict optimal execution paths *before* a layer is fully computed, allowing for pipelined execution and reduced latency. This builds upon the conditional layer idea but moves from reactive branching to predictive branching.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrated circuit incorporating an array of processing engines (as in the source patent), memory for weights/instructions, *and* a dedicated “Path Prediction Engine” (PPE).
*   **PPE Functionality:** The PPE operates in parallel with the main processing engine array. It receives partial results from each layer *before* the entire layer's output is available. The PPE uses a lightweight “Routing Neural Network” (RNN) trained to predict the optimal path (next layer) based on these partial results. The RNN's output is a probability distribution over possible next layers.
*   **Dynamic Weight Allocation:** Memory is segmented into regions for each layer’s weights. Based on the PPE’s prediction, the memory controller proactively pre-fetches the weights for the most likely next layer *before* the current layer completes.
*   **Pipeline Stage Integration:** The pre-fetched weights are loaded into a “Next Layer Buffer” (NLB). The output of the current layer is then directly fed into the NLB, initiating computation of the next layer *without waiting for full layer completion or conditional evaluation.*
*   **Error Correction/Rollback:** A “Verification Engine” (VE) compares the actual conditional evaluation result (from the main processing array) with the PPE’s prediction. If there’s a mismatch, the VE signals a rollback mechanism:
    *   The computation for the incorrectly predicted path is discarded.
    *   The correct path’s weights are loaded from memory.
    *   Computation resumes from the point of divergence.
*   **RNN Training Data:** The RNN is trained using a dataset of input data and corresponding optimal execution paths. Training focuses on minimizing the latency of the entire neural network, not just the accuracy of the path prediction.
*   **Scalability:**  Multiple PPEs can be instantiated for very large neural networks, each responsible for a subset of the layers.

**Pseudocode (PPE Operation):**

```
// For each layer computation:

partial_results = receive_partial_results_from_layer(current_layer)
predicted_path = RNN.predict_next_layer(partial_results) // Returns path with highest probability

prefetch_weights(predicted_path.weights) // Load weights into Next Layer Buffer

// After layer completion & conditional evaluation:

actual_path = determine_actual_path(conditional_evaluation_result)

if (actual_path != predicted_path):
  rollback_computation(predicted_path)
  prefetch_weights(actual_path.weights) //Load correct weights

begin_computation_next_layer(actual_path)
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond reactive conditional branching to *proactive* path prediction, enabling pipelined execution and significantly reducing latency. The rollback mechanism addresses prediction errors without halting computation. This architecture optimizes for speed, rather than purely for accuracy.
