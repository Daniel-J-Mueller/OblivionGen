## Adaptive Acoustic Fingerprinting for Environmental Context

**Concept:** Extend the ‘sound profile’ concept to not just identify repetitive commands, but to build a dynamic acoustic fingerprint of the *environment* a voice assistant operates in. This allows for proactive noise cancellation/adaptation *before* a wakeword is even detected, improving accuracy in challenging conditions, and offering new features related to environmental awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Environmental Acoustic Profiler (EAP)**
    *   Function: Continuously monitors ambient audio.
    *   Algorithm: Uses a combination of:
        *   **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT):** For frequency analysis.
        *   **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs):** For feature extraction, focusing on perceptual characteristics of sound.
        *   **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs):** To model the distribution of acoustic features in the environment.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identifies sounds *outside* the established environmental profile.  (e.g., a dog barking, construction noise).
    *   Output:  A dynamic ‘Environmental Acoustic Profile’ (EAP) - a probabilistic model of the soundscape.  Updated continuously, with weighting towards recent data.
*   **Component 2: Predictive Noise Cancellation (PNC)**
    *   Input: EAP, incoming audio stream.
    *   Function:  Before processing for a wakeword, PNC predicts potential noise interference based on the EAP.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   **Spectral Subtraction:**  Estimates noise spectrum from EAP, subtracts from incoming audio.
        *   **Wiener Filtering:**  Optimizes filtering based on signal and noise power spectral densities (estimated from EAP and incoming audio).
        *   **Adaptive Beamforming (Optional):** If multiple microphones are available, steers the microphones to maximize signal and minimize noise based on the EAP (identifying dominant noise sources).
*   **Component 3: Contextual Awareness Engine (CAE)**
    *   Input: EAP, anomaly detection results, wakeword detection, command processing.
    *   Function:  Provides environmental context to the voice assistant.
    *   Features:
        *   **Automatic Noise Gate Adjustment:** Dynamically adjusts the noise gate threshold for wakeword detection based on the EAP.
        *   **Smart Home Integration:**  Triggers actions based on identified environmental events (e.g., “Someone is knocking,” “Baby is crying”).
        *   **Environmental Reporting:**  Provides a summary of the soundscape to the user (e.g., “It’s currently noisy outside,” “There’s a lot of traffic”).
        *    **"Sound Event Recognition"** - Identifies specific sounds *before* a command is even issued. (e.g., glass breaking, a siren, a specific musical instrument)

**Pseudocode:**

```
// EAP - continuously running in background
function updateEAP(audioData):
    features = extractMFCC(audioData)
    updateGMM(features)

// PNC - pre-processes audio before wakeword detection
function preProcessAudio(audioData, EAP):
    noiseEstimate = estimateNoiseFromEAP(EAP)
    filteredAudio = subtractNoise(audioData, noiseEstimate)
    return filteredAudio

// Main Loop
while True:
    audioData = captureAudio()
    filteredAudio = preProcessAudio(audioData, EAP)
    wakewordDetected = detectWakeword(filteredAudio)
    if wakewordDetected:
        command = processCommand(filteredAudio)
        executeCommand(command)
    updateEAP(audioData)

```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a microphone array for optimal performance, particularly for adaptive beamforming.
*   Needs sufficient processing power to run the EAP and PNC in real-time.  Potentially offload some processing to the cloud.
*   Utilizes existing microphone hardware on current devices.

**Novelty:**  Existing systems primarily focus on noise cancellation *after* speech detection. This proposes a *proactive* approach, using environmental modeling to optimize speech processing *before* the wakeword is even detected. The contextual awareness features further differentiate it from existing solutions. It expands the “sound profile” concept beyond just repetitive commands to represent the entire environmental soundscape.
