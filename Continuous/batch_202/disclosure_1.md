## Dynamic Manifest Stitching for Personalized Live Streams

**Concept:** Extend the embedded manifest idea to enable real-time, personalized live stream experiences by dynamically stitching together manifests tailored to individual user preferences *before* the first chunk is requested. 

**Specs:**

**1. User Preference Profiles:**

*   Data Structure: JSON object.
*   Fields:
    *   `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.
    *   `content_interests`: Array of strings representing user's preferred content categories (e.g., "sports", "news", "comedy").
    *   `preferred_languages`: Array of language codes (e.g., "en", "es", "fr").
    *   `ad_block_level`: Integer (0-3) indicating the user's tolerance for advertisements (0 = no ads, 3 = maximum ads).
    *   `resolution_preference`: String ("720p", "1080p", "4k").

**2. Content Metadata Enrichment:**

*   All content chunks (video, audio, advertisements) must be tagged with metadata:
    *   `content_category`: String (e.g., "sports", "news", "comedy").
    *   `language`: Language code (e.g., "en", "es", "fr").
    *   `ad_flag`: Boolean (True if advertisement, False otherwise).
    *   `resolution`: String ("720p", "1080p", "4k").

**3. Manifest Stitching Service:**

*   Input: User Preference Profile, Live Stream Manifest (base manifest describing available chunks), Current Timecode of Live Stream.
*   Process:
    1.  Filter the base manifest to include only chunks that match the user's preferences (content categories, languages).
    2.  Adjust advertisement frequency based on `ad_block_level`.  (e.g. Level 0: Remove all ads, Level 1: Reduce ad frequency by 50%, Level 2: Standard frequency, Level 3: Increased frequency)
    3.  Select chunks with the `resolution_preference` if available; otherwise, select the highest available resolution.
    4.  Create a personalized manifest containing the filtered and prioritized chunks.
    5.  Embed the personalized manifest into the response to the userâ€™s request for the live stream.

**4. Client-Side Logic:**

*   Receive embedded personalized manifest.
*   Request content chunks based on the order and locations specified in the personalized manifest.
*   Continuously request updated personalized manifests (e.g., every 5-10 seconds) to adapt to changing user preferences or live stream content.

**Pseudocode (Manifest Stitching Service):**

```
function stitch_manifest(user_profile, base_manifest, current_timecode):
  filtered_chunks = []
  for chunk in base_manifest.chunks:
    if (chunk.content_category in user_profile.content_interests and
        chunk.language in user_profile.preferred_languages):
      filtered_chunks.append(chunk)

  # Adjust advertisement frequency
  ad_count = 0
  for chunk in filtered_chunks:
    if chunk.ad_flag:
      ad_count += 1

  if user_profile.ad_block_level == 0:
    filtered_chunks = [chunk for chunk in filtered_chunks if not chunk.ad_flag]
  elif user_profile.ad_block_level == 1:
    # Reduce ad frequency by 50% (remove half of the ads)
    # Implement logic to randomly remove ads
    pass
  
  # Select resolution
  resolution_chunks = [chunk for chunk in filtered_chunks if chunk.resolution == user_profile.resolution_preference]
  if not resolution_chunks:
      resolution_chunks = sorted(filtered_chunks, key=lambda x: x.resolution, reverse=True)

  # Create personalized manifest
  personalized_manifest = Manifest()
  personalized_manifest.chunks = resolution_chunks
  personalized_manifest.timestamp = current_timecode
  return personalized_manifest
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Highly personalized live stream experience.
*   Reduced latency by eliminating unnecessary content requests.
*   Improved user engagement and satisfaction.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing user preferences.
*   Enhanced advertising effectiveness (or complete ad blocking).
