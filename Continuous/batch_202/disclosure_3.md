## Dynamic Log Template Composition via Genetic Algorithm

**Concept:** Instead of a static log template pool, evolve log templates *during* parsing using a genetic algorithm. This addresses the limitations of predefined templates and allows adaptation to unseen log formats.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Log Entry Feature Extractor:**
    *   Input: Raw log entry (string).
    *   Output: Feature vector.
    *   Functionality: Identifies key characteristics of the log entry. Examples: frequency of alphanumeric characters, presence of IP addresses, timestamps, error codes, keyword density, and structural elements (e.g., delimited fields).
*   **Component 2: Template Representation (Genome):**
    *   A template is represented as a series of 'instruction blocks' encoded as a string. These blocks define how to parse the log entry.
    *   Instruction blocks:
        *   `REGEX(pattern)`: Matches a regular expression pattern.
        *   `DELIMITER(character)`: Splits the string by a character.
        *   `SKIP(n)`: Skips the next 'n' characters.
        *   `CAPTURE()`: Captures the matched/delimited/skipped value.
        *   `TYPE(data_type)`: Defines the data type of the captured value (e.g., INT, STRING, FLOAT).
*   **Component 3: Fitness Function:**
    *   Takes a log entry and a template (genome) as input.
    *   Executes the template against the log entry.
    *   Calculates a fitness score based on:
        *   **Parse Success Rate:** Percentage of log entry successfully parsed.
        *   **Data Type Accuracy:**  How well the inferred data types match expected types (using heuristics or a pre-defined schema).
        *   **Coverage:**  Percentage of log entry covered by the parsing.
*   **Component 4: Genetic Algorithm Engine:**
    *   **Population:** Maintains a population of log templates (genomes).
    *   **Selection:** Selects templates based on fitness score (e.g., tournament selection, roulette wheel selection).
    *   **Crossover:** Combines parts of two parent templates to create offspring (e.g., single-point crossover, multi-point crossover).
    *   **Mutation:** Randomly alters parts of a template (e.g., change a regex pattern, add/remove an instruction block).
    *   **Replacement:** Replaces low-fitness templates with new offspring.
*   **Component 5: Log Entry Parser:**
    *   Input: Raw log entry.
    *   Process: 
        1.  Extract features from the log entry.
        2.  Select the best template from the current population (based on feature similarity).
        3.  Apply the template to parse the log entry.
        4.  Output parsed log data.
*   **Component 6: Population Update Mechanism:**
    *   The population of templates is constantly updated as new log entries are processed.
    *   Templates that consistently perform well are retained and used as the basis for new templates.
    *   Templates that consistently perform poorly are removed from the population.

**Pseudocode (Population Update):**

```
function update_population(log_entry, population):
  best_template = select_best_template(log_entry, population)
  fitness = evaluate_fitness(log_entry, best_template)

  if fitness > threshold:
    # Encourage the best template
    offspring = create_offspring(best_template)
    add_offspring_to_population(offspring, population)
  else:
    # Introduce diversity through mutation
    mutated_template = mutate_template(select_random_template(population))
    replace_worst_template(mutated_template, population)

  return population
```

**Refinement:** The `threshold` is dynamic, based on the average fitness of the population. This allows the system to adapt to changing log formats. The system can also incorporate feedback from human operators to improve the accuracy of the templates.
