## Adaptive Data Granularity & Predictive Prefetching

**System Specification:** A distributed data aggregation layer operating *ahead* of service calls, utilizing a learned model of request patterns to proactively assemble and cache data at varying granularities.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of waiting for a service call to determine the necessary data, the system predicts *potential* requests and pre-fetches data, assembling it into multiple “views” representing different levels of detail. These views are cached, and the arriving service request is served from the most appropriate view – minimizing data transfer and processing.  This is accomplished through a multi-tiered cache – a fast, small “hot” cache for frequently requested granularities, and a larger, slower cache for less common ones.

**Components:**

1.  **Request Pattern Analyzer:** A machine learning module (e.g., LSTM network) that ingests historical service request data (input parameters, requested fields, frequency) to predict future requests.  Output: Probability distribution over potential request parameters and fields.

2.  **Data Assembly Engine:**  Responsible for fetching data from underlying services based on the predicted request distributions.  It dynamically assembles data into multiple granularities – e.g., full object, specific fields, aggregated summaries.

3.  **Multi-Tiered Cache:**
    *   **Hot Cache:** Small, fast in-memory cache storing the most frequently requested granularities.
    *   **Warm Cache:** Larger, slower storage (e.g., SSD) storing less frequent granularities.
    *   **Cold Cache:**  Archival storage (e.g., cloud object storage) for rarely accessed data.

4.  **Granularity Selector:**  Upon receiving a service request, this component assesses the request's parameters and selects the pre-assembled granularity from the cache that best matches the request. If no suitable granularity exists, it triggers a fetch from the underlying service *and* initiates pre-assembly of relevant granularities for future requests.

5. **Data Versioning and Invalidation:** Each cached data view is tagged with a version number. Changes in the underlying data trigger invalidation of relevant versions, prompting re-assembly. A lightweight change propagation mechanism is used to minimize the impact of updates.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Selector):**

```
function select_granularity(request_params, request_fields) {
  // 1. Attempt to find an exact match in the Hot Cache
  cached_data = hot_cache.get(request_params, request_fields);
  if (cached_data != null) {
    return cached_data;
  }

  // 2. Attempt to find a close match in the Warm Cache (e.g., same params, different fields)
  warm_data = warm_cache.get_close_match(request_params, request_fields);
  if (warm_data != null) {
    // Optionally transform warm_data to match request_fields
    return warm_data;
  }

  // 3. Fetch data from underlying service
  data = fetch_from_service(request_params, request_fields);

  // 4. Assemble multiple granularities of data
  granularities = assemble_granularities(data, request_params);

  // 5. Cache the granularities
  cache_granularities(granularities);

  // 6. Return the requested data
  return data;
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Cache Entry:**  {data: object, params: object, fields: array, version: int, timestamp: timestamp}
*   **Granularity Profile:** {params: object, fields: array, cache_tier: string} – defines which granularity is stored in which cache tier.

**Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   The system should be deployed as a distributed cluster, with data partitioned across multiple nodes.
*   Data replication should be used to ensure fault tolerance.
*   A consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft) should be used to maintain consistency across nodes.
