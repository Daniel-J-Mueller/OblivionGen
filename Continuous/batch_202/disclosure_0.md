## Dynamic Complexity-Adaptive Encoding Ladders with Per-Frame Ladder Selection

**Concept:** Extend the cluster-based encoding ladder approach by introducing per-frame ladder selection *within* a media presentation, based on real-time complexity analysis. Rather than locking to a single cluster ladder for an entire presentation, the system dynamically switches between pre-computed ladders *or* generates a ladder on the fly, for each frame (or small group of frames) based on its unique characteristics.

**Specs:**

1.  **Complexity Metrics:**
    *   Spatial Complexity: Standard Deviation of pixel intensity, edge density, texture analysis (using algorithms like Local Binary Patterns).
    *   Temporal Complexity: Motion vector variance, scene change detection probability (based on histogram differences between consecutive frames), optical flow magnitude.
    *   Perceptual Complexity:  Utilize a learned model (e.g., a convolutional neural network trained on subjective video quality assessments) to predict perceptual complexity.

2.  **Ladder Generation/Selection Pool:**
    *   Pre-computed Ladders: Maintain a library of encoding ladders optimized for different complexity ranges (low, medium, high, very high) *and* content types (animation, sports, film, etc.). These ladders would be created using the original patentâ€™s cluster-based methodology, but extended to cover a wider range of complexity and content diversity.
    *   Dynamic Ladder Generation: Implement a fast encoding profile optimization algorithm (e.g., Bayesian optimization) that can generate a tailored encoding ladder for a specific frame or small group of frames *on the fly*.  This is more computationally intensive but offers maximum adaptation.

3.  **Per-Frame/Group Decision Logic:**
    *   Complexity Score Calculation:  Combine the spatial, temporal, and perceptual complexity metrics into a single complexity score.  Weighted averaging or a learned model can be used.
    *   Ladder Selection/Generation Trigger: Define thresholds for the complexity score.
        *   Low Complexity: Select a pre-computed ladder optimized for low-complexity content.
        *   Medium Complexity: Select a pre-computed ladder optimized for medium-complexity content.
        *   High Complexity: Dynamically generate a tailored encoding ladder using the fast optimization algorithm.
    *   Smoothing Filter:  Apply a smoothing filter (e.g., moving average) to the selected ladder sequence to prevent abrupt changes in encoding parameters, thereby maintaining visual consistency.

4.  **Encoding Pipeline Integration:**
    *   Pre-Analysis Stage: Before encoding each frame/group, calculate the complexity score.
    *   Ladder Retrieval/Generation Stage: Retrieve the appropriate pre-computed ladder or generate a new one.
    *   Encoding Stage: Encode the frame/group using the selected ladder.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
FOR each frame/group in media presentation:
    Calculate spatial complexity
    Calculate temporal complexity
    Calculate perceptual complexity
    complexityScore = weightedAverage(spatialComplexity, temporalComplexity, perceptualComplexity)

    IF complexityScore < lowThreshold:
        selectedLadder = retrieveLadder(complexityRange="low")
    ELSE IF complexityScore < mediumThreshold:
        selectedLadder = retrieveLadder(complexityRange="medium")
    ELSE:
        selectedLadder = generateLadder(complexityScore)

    smoothLadder = applySmoothingFilter(selectedLadder)
    encode(frame, smoothLadder)
END
```

**Novelty:**  This extends the static cluster-based approach to a dynamic, per-frame adaptation, offering potentially significant gains in compression efficiency and visual quality, particularly for content with varying levels of complexity.  The combination of pre-computed ladders and on-the-fly generation provides a balance between computational cost and adaptation accuracy.
