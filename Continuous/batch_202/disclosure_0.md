## Dynamic Subtitle "Mood" Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the translation system to dynamically adjust subtitle *style* (font, color, size, animation) based on detected emotional content of the audio. This goes beyond simple translation, offering a more immersive and emotionally resonant experience for the viewer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Emotional Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Audio stream from the data stream.
*   **Process:** Utilize an AI-powered emotion detection engine (API or locally hosted model) to analyze the audio in real-time.  Output a confidence score for a range of emotions (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Neutral, etc.).
*   **Output:** Emotion data – an array or object containing emotion types and corresponding confidence scores, updated at a rate of at least 10 times per second.

**2.  Style Mapping Table:**

*   A configurable table (JSON or similar format) defining stylistic mappings for each emotion.
*   Example:

```json
{
  "Joy": {
    "font": "Arial",
    "size": "24px",
    "color": "#FFFF00",
    "animation": "fade-in-out",
    "background": "transparent"
  },
  "Sadness": {
    "font": "Times New Roman",
    "size": "20px",
    "color": "#0000FF",
    "animation": "slow-fade",
    "background": "#E6E6FA"
  },
  "Anger": {
    "font": "Impact",
    "size": "28px",
    "color": "#FF0000",
    "animation": "shake",
    "background": "#F08080"
  },
  "Fear": {
    "font": "Courier New",
    "size": "22px",
    "color": "#800080",
    "animation": "pulse",
    "background": "#D8BFD8"
  },
  "Neutral": {
    "font": "Verdana",
    "size": "24px",
    "color": "#FFFFFF",
    "animation": "none",
    "background": "#000000"
  }
}
```

**3.  Subtitle Styling Engine:**

*   **Input:** Translation output (text) *and* Emotion Data from the Emotional Analysis Module.
*   **Process:** 
    *   Determine the dominant emotion based on the confidence scores from the Emotion Data (e.g., highest score, weighted average).
    *   Lookup the corresponding style settings from the Style Mapping Table.
    *   Apply these style settings to the translation output before displaying it as a subtitle.
*   **Output:** Styled subtitle text ready for rendering.

**4.  Integration with Existing System:**

*   The Subtitle Styling Engine intercepts the translation output *before* it’s associated with the video signal.
*   The styled subtitle text is then associated with the video signal, along with the delay.
*   The system supports dynamic updates to the style settings while the video is playing (allowing for real-time emotional adjustments).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function applyEmotionalStyling(translationText, emotionData, styleMappingTable):
    dominantEmotion = determineDominantEmotion(emotionData)
    styleSettings = styleMappingTable[dominantEmotion]
    styledText = applyStyleSettings(translationText, styleSettings)
    return styledText

function determineDominantEmotion(emotionData):
    //Logic to identify the emotion with the highest confidence score.
    //Could also implement a weighted average for smoother transitions.
    return dominantEmotion

function applyStyleSettings(text, settings):
    //Apply font, size, color, animation, and background to the text.
    return styledText
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   User customization of the Style Mapping Table.
*   Integration with user biofeedback (heart rate, facial expressions) to personalize the emotional experience.
*   Support for multiple languages and emotional nuances.
*   AI-powered style suggestion based on video content.
