## Acoustic Holography for Dynamic Environment Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the surface-based sonic location system to create real-time, dynamic 3D maps of the surrounding environment using a dense array of ultrasonic emitters and detectors. This isn't just about locating *devices*, it's about understanding the space itself â€“ identifying obstacles, open areas, and even material properties through acoustic reflection analysis.

**Specifications:**

*   **Array Configuration:** Implement a phased array of at least 64 ultrasonic transducers (32 emitters, 32 receivers) integrated into a portable surface (e.g., a mat, a panel).  Transducers should operate in a range of 20kHz - 40kHz, optimized for both air and surface propagation.
*   **Emission Protocol:** Implement a chaotic or pseudo-random emission sequence. Instead of simple pings, generate complex waveforms.  This combats interference and allows for better spatial resolution. Each emitter will have a unique, subtly varying emission profile.
*   **Reception System:** High-speed, multi-channel analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) capable of sampling at >1MHz per channel. Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) calculated via cross-correlation. Signal processing hardware (FPGA or dedicated DSP) for real-time processing.
*   **Acoustic Reflection Profiling:** Analyze the received signal to determine:
    *   **Time of Flight (TOF):** Distance to reflecting surfaces.
    *   **Amplitude:** Strength of reflection (related to material).
    *   **Phase Shift:** Material properties (density, elasticity).
    *   **Doppler Shift:** Movement of objects.
*   **Data Fusion & Mapping:** Implement a Kalman filter-based data fusion algorithm to combine TOF, amplitude, phase, and Doppler data. Generate a 3D point cloud representation of the environment. This requires dedicated GPU processing.  The point cloud is converted into a mesh for visualization.
*   **Dynamic Object Tracking:** Utilize optical flow algorithms (applied to the point cloud) to track moving objects in real-time. Predict trajectories for collision avoidance.
*   **Surface Mode Enhancement:**  Implement a piezoelectric vibration plate underlying the array, enhancing signal propagation along surfaces. Control the vibration frequency and amplitude to optimize signal penetration.
*   **Environmental Calibration:** Pre-programmed calibration routines to account for temperature, humidity, and surface characteristics. Automatic calibration using known reference objects.

**Pseudocode (Mapping & Tracking):**
