## Adaptive Parcel Interaction System

**Concept:** Extend parcel monitoring beyond simple theft detection to enable proactive, automated interaction with delivered parcels. The system leverages A/V data and machine learning to categorize parcel state (e.g., delivered, partially opened, damaged) and trigger actions accordingly.

**Hardware Components:**

*   Existing A/V device (camera and microphone)
*   Small robotic actuator – integrated into/mountable near the A/V device. This actuator has limited degrees of freedom – pan/tilt for basic manipulation. Payload capacity of ~500g.
*   Small, integrated lighting system (controllable brightness/color).
*   Optional: Weatherproof enclosure for outdoor deployment.

**Software Components:**

*   **Parcel State Engine:** A machine learning model trained on images and audio data to classify parcel state. States include: ‘Delivered – Sealed’, ‘Delivered – Opened (Partial)’, ‘Delivered – Opened (Full)’, ‘Damaged’, ‘Moved/Removed’.
*   **Action Planner:** Based on the identified parcel state, the Action Planner determines the appropriate response.
*   **Actuator Control Module:** Translates Action Planner instructions into actuator commands (pan, tilt, light control).
*   **User Interface:** Allows users to customize action plans, view parcel state, and review event logs.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Parcel Detection:** The A/V device detects a parcel.
2.  **State Analysis:** The Parcel State Engine analyzes A/V data to determine the parcel’s current state.
3.  **Action Selection:** The Action Planner selects an appropriate action based on the state and user-defined preferences.
4.  **Actuation (Examples):**
    *   **‘Delivered – Sealed’:** No action. Periodic status updates to the user.
    *   **‘Delivered – Opened (Partial)’:** Activate the lighting system to illuminate the parcel. Send a notification to the user with a snapshot of the open parcel.
    *   **‘Damaged’:** Capture detailed images/video of the damage. Automatically initiate a claim with the delivery service (integration with APIs).
    *   **‘Moved/Removed’:** Initiate recording of the removal and send an alert.

**Pseudocode (Action Planner):**

```
function plan_action(parcel_state, user_preferences):
  if parcel_state == "Delivered - Sealed":
    action = "monitor"
  elif parcel_state == "Delivered - Opened (Partial)":
    action = "illuminate_and_notify"
  elif parcel_state == "Damaged":
    action = "capture_details_and_claim"
  elif parcel_state == "Moved/Removed":
    action = "record_and_alert"
  else:
    action = "unknown"

  return action
```

**System Specifications:**

*   **Power:** PoE or dedicated power supply.
*   **Communication:** Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet.
*   **Data Storage:** Local storage (SD card) and cloud storage options.
*   **API Integration:** Support for third-party delivery services and smart home platforms.

**Novelty:** This system expands beyond simple parcel theft alerts. It provides proactive monitoring and automated interaction, turning the A/V device into an active participant in the parcel delivery process. This creates an innovative experience for the end-user.
