## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Personalized Soundscapes

**Concept:** Extend the open microphone system to create dynamically adjustable acoustic zones within a space, coupled with personalized soundscape generation for each user. This builds on the patent’s focus on localized audio processing but moves beyond simple voice transmission to encompass a richer, context-aware audio experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of miniature, low-power beamforming microphones distributed throughout the space (e.g., integrated into lighting fixtures, furniture). Minimum density: 1 microphone per 100 sq ft.
    *   Dedicated edge processing unit (integrated into central hub or distributed amongst 'smart' fixtures) for real-time audio analysis and beamforming.  Minimum processing capability: 100 TOPS.
    *   Multiple low-latency wireless audio transmitters (Bluetooth 5.3 or similar) for individualized audio output.
    *   Optional: Haptic feedback devices (wristbands, chairs) for subtle directional cues.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping:** Algorithm to dynamically create a 3D map of the environment, identifying sound sources and reflections. Uses microphone array data and potentially visual input (cameras). Resolution: 10cm.
    *   **Zone Definition:** User-definable acoustic zones. Users can create zones using voice commands ("Create zone 'living room'"), gestures, or a dedicated app. Zones can be static or dynamic (e.g., follow a user). Zone size/shape adjustable via app/voice.
    *   **Source Localization:**  Real-time identification and localization of sound sources within each zone. Uses beamforming and advanced signal processing techniques. Accuracy: +/- 5 degrees.
    *   **Sound Isolation/Enhancement:** Algorithm to isolate or enhance audio within specific zones. Can suppress noise from outside a zone, prioritize speech from within a zone, or augment audio with effects.
    *   **Personalized Soundscape Generation:**  AI-driven module that generates individualized soundscapes based on user preferences, context (time of day, activity, location), and environmental audio. Soundscape elements: ambient sounds, music, spoken word.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrates data from other sensors (motion, temperature, light) to adjust soundscapes and zone behavior.
    *   **Voice Trigger/Control:**  Seamless integration with the existing voice trigger system. Users can control zones, adjust soundscapes, and initiate actions using voice commands.
*   **Operational Flow:**
    1.  System continuously maps the acoustic environment using the microphone array.
    2.  Users define acoustic zones.
    3.  For each zone:
        *   System identifies sound sources.
        *   System applies sound isolation/enhancement algorithms.
        *   Personalized soundscape generator creates an individualized audio experience.
        *   Audio is transmitted to the user’s wireless audio device (headphones, speakers).
    4.  System dynamically adjusts zones and soundscapes based on user activity, location, and environmental conditions.

**Pseudocode (Zone Adjustment Logic):**

```
function adjustZone(userID, zoneID, eventType, eventData) {
  if (eventType == "userMovement") {
    newLocation = eventData.location;
    // Calculate the distance between the user and the zone's center
    distance = calculateDistance(newLocation, zoneCenter);

    // If the user is moving rapidly away from the zone:
    if (distance > threshold && velocity > threshold) {
      // Shrink the zone or move its center to follow the user
      adjustZoneSize(zoneID, newSize);
      adjustZoneCenter(zoneID, newLocation);
    }
  } else if (eventType == "environmentalChange") {
    noiseLevel = eventData.noiseLevel;
    if (noiseLevel > threshold) {
      // Increase sound isolation for the zone
      adjustIsolation(zoneID, increasedIsolationLevel);
    }
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Open-plan offices: Create acoustic privacy for individuals or small groups.
*   Smart homes: Deliver personalized audio experiences in each room.
*   Retail spaces: Create immersive and engaging environments.
*   Healthcare: Reduce noise levels and improve patient comfort.
