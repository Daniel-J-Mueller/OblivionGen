## Temporal Access Point Policies

**Specification:** Implement time-based expiry and activation for access point policies. Beyond simple permissions (read/write/VPC restriction), policies should define a 'valid from' timestamp and a 'valid until' timestamp. The system must maintain a history of active/inactive policies per access point.

**Details:**

*   **Policy Structure:** Each access point policy will include:
    *   `policy_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `access_point_address`: The address the policy applies to.
    *   `permissions`: (Existing permission structure â€“ read, write, VPC etc.)
    *   `valid_from`:  ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the policy becomes active.
    *   `valid_until`: ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the policy expires.
*   **API Extensions:**
    *   `POST /access_points/{address}/policies`:  Create a policy with `valid_from` and `valid_until`.
    *   `GET /access_points/{address}/policies?time={timestamp}`: Retrieve policies active at a given timestamp.  This allows auditing of permissions at a specific moment in time.
    *   `PUT /access_points/{address}/policies/{policy_id}`: Modify `valid_from` and `valid_until` for existing policies.
*   **Request Handling Logic:**
    1.  When a request arrives at an access point, the system retrieves *all* policies associated with that access point.
    2.  The system filters the policies to include only those where the current time falls between `valid_from` and `valid_until`.
    3.  The effective permissions are determined by combining the permissions from the active policies (e.g., using a priority or least privilege model).
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Temporary Access:** Granting access to a consultant or contractor for a specific duration.
    *   **Scheduled Policy Changes:** Automating policy updates based on time (e.g., escalating access permissions during peak hours).
    *   **Compliance:** Enforcing time-bound access restrictions to meet regulatory requirements.
    *   **Automated Revocation:** Automatically revoking access after a defined period.
*   **Pseudocode (Request Handling):**

```
function handleRequest(accessPointAddress, request):
    policies = getPolicies(accessPointAddress)
    activePolicies = filterPoliciesByTime(policies, currentTime())
    effectivePermissions = combinePermissions(activePolicies)
    if requestAllowed(request, effectivePermissions):
        processRequest(request)
    else:
        denyRequest(request)
```
