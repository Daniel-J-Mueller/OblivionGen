## Modular, Self-Calibrating Power Distribution Network for Heterogeneous Compute

**Concept:** A dynamically reconfigurable power network that not only distributes DC voltage but also *learns* the optimal voltage delivery profile for each connected compute module â€“ even as those modules change or are added/removed. This goes beyond simple load balancing; it aims for per-module power efficiency maximization.

**Specs:**

*   **Network Topology:**  A meshed network of DC-DC converters (bidirectional) forming a distributed power fabric.  Each converter node connects to multiple neighboring nodes, and to one or more compute modules.  No central power distribution unit.
*   **Compute Modules:** Designed with standardized power input/output connectors, allowing hot-swap and dynamic connection to the network.  Modules report their current voltage/current draw *and* performance metrics (e.g., processing speed, error rate).
*   **Converter Nodes:**  Each node contains:
    *   High-efficiency, wide-range DC-DC converter (capable of stepping up or down voltage).
    *   Microcontroller with communication interface (e.g., I2C, SPI) for network control.
    *   Current/Voltage sensors.
    *   Small, local energy storage (supercapacitor) for transient load support and resilience.
*   **Control System:**  A distributed reinforcement learning (RL) agent running on each converter node.
    *   **State:** Current voltage/current draw of the connected module, reported performance metrics, voltage/current levels of neighboring nodes.
    *   **Action:** Adjust DC-DC converter duty cycle to modify voltage/current delivery.
    *   **Reward:** Performance metric improvement *minus* energy loss in the converter. (Encourages both performance and efficiency.)
*   **Calibration Procedure:**
    1.  **Initial Sweep:** Upon module connection, the node performs a voltage/current sweep, monitoring performance metrics.
    2.  **RL Training:** The RL agent iteratively adjusts voltage/current, learning the optimal delivery profile.
    3.  **Continuous Adaptation:**  The agent continuously monitors performance and adapts to changing workloads or module characteristics.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A low-latency, reliable communication protocol for exchanging state information and control signals between nodes. Potential use of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Redundant paths and node monitoring. If a node fails, neighboring nodes can automatically re-route power and take over its load.
*   **Scaling:**  The meshed topology allows for easy scaling.  New modules can be added or removed without disrupting the network.

**Pseudocode (RL Agent):**

```
// Agent Initialization
Initialize Q-Table (maps state-action pairs to Q-values)
Learning Rate = 0.1
Discount Factor = 0.9
Exploration Rate = 0.2

// Main Loop
While Module Connected:
    Get Current State (voltage, current, performance)
    
    If Random Number < Exploration Rate:
        // Explore: Choose random action (duty cycle adjustment)
        Action = Random Action
    Else:
        // Exploit: Choose action with highest Q-value for current state
        Action = Argmax(Q-Table[State])

    Apply Action (adjust duty cycle)
    Get New State (voltage, current, performance)
    Reward = Performance Improvement - Energy Loss

    // Update Q-Table
    Q-Table[State][Action] = Q-Table[State][Action] + Learning Rate * (Reward + Discount Factor * Max(Q-Table[New State]) - Q-Table[State][Action])

    State = New State
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Power Efficiency:** Per-module optimization minimizes energy waste.
*   **Improved Performance:** Tailored voltage delivery maximizes performance for each module.
*   **Enhanced Resilience:** Fault tolerance and redundancy protect against failures.
*   **Scalability:** Easily accommodate new modules and changing workloads.
*   **Dynamic Adaptability:** The network continuously learns and adapts to changing conditions.
