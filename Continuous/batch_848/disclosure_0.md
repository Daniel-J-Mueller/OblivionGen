**Dynamic Perspective Correction & Predictive Stabilization for Multi-Camera Arrays**

**Concept:** Extend the single-camera stabilization concept to a multi-camera array, creating a system that not only corrects for jitter but dynamically adjusts perspectives *between* cameras to create a more immersive and stabilized multi-view experience. This is particularly useful for volumetric capture, VR/AR applications, and advanced telepresence.

**Specs:**

*   **Camera Array:** Minimum of 3, maximum of 16 cameras arranged in a configurable geometry (e.g., spherical, cubical, linear). Each camera has a known intrinsic and extrinsic calibration relative to a central coordinate system.
*   **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs):** Each camera is equipped with a 9-DOF IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) to provide high-frequency motion data.
*   **Processing Unit:** A high-performance embedded system or edge server with multi-core CPU and GPU acceleration for real-time processing.
*   **Synchronization:** Precise time synchronization between all cameras and IMUs using a hardware trigger or network time protocol (NTP).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **IMU Fusion:** Kalman filtering or similar algorithm to integrate IMU data and estimate camera pose (position and orientation) with high accuracy.
    *   **Feature Tracking:** Computer vision algorithms (e.g., ORB-SLAM, Structure from Motion) to track visual features in the scene and refine camera pose estimates.
    *   **Dynamic Perspective Warp:** Algorithm to dynamically adjust the perspective of each camera view based on estimated pose and intended viewing geometry.
    *   **Predictive Stabilization:**  Uses a short-term prediction model (e.g., LSTM neural network) to anticipate camera motion and pre-warp the image before the motion occurs, reducing latency and improving smoothness.
    *   **Multi-View Fusion:**  Combines warped and stabilized views into a seamless multi-view display or volumetric reconstruction.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Stabilization):**

```
// Input: IMU data stream, camera image stream
// Output: Stabilized and pre-warped image stream

loop:
    // 1. IMU Data Processing
    imu_data = read_imu_data()
    predicted_pose = predict_pose(imu_data, previous_poses) // LSTM model

    // 2. Image Acquisition
    image = acquire_image()

    // 3. Perspective Warp based on predicted pose
    warped_image = apply_perspective_transform(image, predicted_pose)

    // 4.  Optional: Real-Time Feedback Correction
    //       -  Track features in warped image.
    //       -  Compare to expected positions based on predicted pose.
    //       -  Adjust warp parameters to minimize error.

    // 5. Output stabilized image
    output_image = warped_image

    // Update previous poses for next iteration
    previous_poses.append(imu_data)
    previous_poses.pop(0) // Maintain a fixed-size history

```

**Novelty:**

The combination of predictive stabilization, dynamic perspective correction *across multiple cameras*, and the ability to adjust viewing geometry in real-time represents a significant advancement over existing stabilization techniques. The system aims to create a truly immersive and comfortable multi-view experience by actively mitigating jitter and adapting to the user's viewing preferences.
