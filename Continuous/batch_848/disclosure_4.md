## Autonomous Device Swarm Coordination via Predictive Occupancy Grids

**Concept:** Expand the single-robot occupancy grid concept into a swarm-level predictive system. Instead of each robot building *its own* local occupancy grid, they share data to create a globally consistent, *predictive* occupancy grid. This grid isn’t just about *what is* currently occupied, but *what will likely be* occupied in the near future, based on observed trajectories of dynamic obstacles (people, other robots).

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Each robot equipped with LiDAR, RGB-D camera, and ultra-wideband (UWB) radio for precise localization relative to the swarm.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Dedicated, low-latency wireless mesh network for data sharing amongst robots. Prioritized for occupancy grid updates and trajectory predictions.
*   **Global Occupancy Grid:** A distributed, multi-layered occupancy grid.
    *   *Static Layer:*  Long-term persistent map of static obstacles.  Low update frequency.
    *   *Variable Layer:* Represents obstacles that change infrequently (e.g., open/closed doors). Medium update frequency.
    *   *Dynamic Layer:* High-resolution, short-term prediction of moving obstacles. Updated multiple times per second.
*   **Trajectory Prediction Algorithm:**  Kalman filtering or recurrent neural network (RNN) used to extrapolate the paths of dynamic obstacles. Factors in velocity, acceleration, and observed behavior.  Output is a probability distribution over possible future locations.
*   **Swarm Coordination Protocol:**
    *   Each robot continuously broadcasts its estimated position, velocity, and observed obstacle trajectories.
    *   A designated “grid manager” (rotating role among robots) aggregates data, refines the occupancy grid, and broadcasts updates.
    *   Robots utilize the shared occupancy grid for path planning, prioritizing paths that minimize predicted collisions with dynamic obstacles.
*   **Cost Function for Path Planning:**
    *   Standard cost for distance traveled.
    *   Collision risk cost based on the probability of collision with predicted obstacle locations.
    *   “Social force” cost to maintain a desired distance from other robots and humans.
*   **Failure Handling:**
    *   If a robot loses communication, it reverts to a local occupancy grid and informs the swarm.
    *   If the grid manager fails, another robot automatically assumes the role.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Robot code
loop:
    scan_environment()
    detect_obstacles()
    estimate_obstacle_trajectories()
    broadcast_data(position, velocity, trajectories)
    receive_grid_update()
    plan_path(grid_update)
    move_robot(path)

// Grid Manager code
loop:
    receive_data_from_robots()
    aggregate_data()
    refine_occupancy_grid()
    broadcast_grid_update()
```

**Novelty:** The combination of predictive occupancy grids, distributed processing amongst a swarm, and dynamic cost functions for path planning is, to my knowledge, unaddressed. Existing systems rely on localized occupancy grids and reactive obstacle avoidance. This system aims for proactive, coordinated navigation in complex, dynamic environments.
