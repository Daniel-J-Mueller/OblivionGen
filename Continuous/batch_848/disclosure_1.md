## Dynamic Zone-of-Interest with Predictive Occlusion Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the zone-of-interest definition beyond static boundary markers by incorporating predictive occlusion mapping based on real-time depth data and learned environmental models. This allows the system to intelligently adjust the zone of interest, anticipating where objects might appear or disappear due to occlusion, even *before* they fully enter or exit the camera’s field of view.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing Camera System (as per provided patent)
    *   Depth Sensor (e.g., Time-of-Flight, Structured Light) - integrated or external to camera.  Resolution minimum 640x480.
    *   Edge Processing Unit – capable of running lightweight AI models (see software specs) – minimum 8-core processor with dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Environmental Model Builder:**  A learning algorithm that builds a 3D representation of the environment based on depth data collected over time. This isn't a full SLAM system, but a simplified occupancy grid or point cloud representation focused on static elements.  Uses a Kalman Filter for smoothing and noise reduction.
    *   **Occlusion Prediction Module:**  Based on the environmental model and real-time depth data, this module predicts areas of potential occlusion.  Uses a raycasting algorithm to determine if objects are likely to be hidden behind other objects.  Output is a probability map indicating the likelihood of occlusion in each pixel.
    *   **Dynamic Zone-of-Interest Controller:**  This module receives the occlusion probability map and adjusts the zone of interest accordingly. It prioritizes areas with low occlusion probability, expanding the zone of interest to capture potential objects before they are fully visible, and contracts it in areas with high probability of obstruction. Algorithm:
        *   `Zone_Expansion_Factor = 1 + (1 – Occlusion_Probability) * 0.2`  (adjusts zone size based on occlusion)
        *   Zone boundaries are defined by Bezier curves, allowing for smooth, organic adjustments.
        *   Minimum Zone Size: 100 pixels x 100 pixels.
    *   **Data Fusion Module:** Integrates RGB images from the camera with depth data from the depth sensor. Uses a color-weighted depth map to improve the accuracy of occlusion prediction.
    *   **API:** Provides an API for external applications to define custom zone-of-interest shapes and behavior.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Environment Mapping:**  The system continuously collects depth data and builds a simplified 3D environmental model.
2.  **Real-time Depth Analysis:**  The system analyzes real-time depth data to identify potential occlusions.
3.  **Zone Adjustment:** The Dynamic Zone-of-Interest Controller adjusts the zone boundaries based on the occlusion probability map, expanding or contracting the zone as needed.
4.  **Object Tracking:** The object tracking algorithm operates within the dynamically adjusted zone of interest, improving object detection and tracking accuracy.
5.  **Data Output:** The system outputs the adjusted zone boundaries and the detected objects within the zone.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved parking management – anticipate vehicle arrivals and departures even when partially obscured.
*   Advanced robotics – enable robots to navigate and interact with objects in cluttered environments.
*   Security systems – track moving objects even when they are temporarily hidden behind obstacles.
*   Autonomous drones – improve object avoidance and obstacle tracking.
