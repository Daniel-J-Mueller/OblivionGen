## Modular Kinetic Energy Harvesting & Transfer System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple electrical connections facilitated by the connector. Integrate a micro-kinetic energy harvesting system within the device and accessory, enabling bidirectional energy transfer *and* data communication. This goes beyond powering a device; it allows the accessory to *contribute* energy or act as a power reservoir.

**Specs:**

*   **Connector Element (Device Side):**  Modified cylindrical connector as per the patent, but housing a miniature electromagnetic induction coil & piezoelectric generator. Core material: High permeability alloy. Coating: Conductive polymer for both electricity & kinetic energy transfer.
*   **External Contact Element (Accessory Side):**  Concave contact area as described, incorporating a matching electromagnetic induction coil & piezoelectric generator.  Embedded micro-capacitor for temporary energy storage. Housing material:  Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with embedded conductive traces.
*   **Energy Management Unit (Device):**
    *   Microcontroller with analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for monitoring voltage/current from the connector.
    *   DC-DC boost converter to regulate harvested energy for device operation.
    *   Bidirectional power flow control â€“ allows device to draw energy *or* supply energy to the accessory.
    *   Data communication interface (Bluetooth Low Energy) for transmitting energy status and accessory identification.
*   **Accessory Power Profile:** Accessories will have pre-defined power profiles (draw/supply capacity) to optimize energy transfer. This is communicated via a unique identifier upon connection.
*   **Kinetic Energy Harvesting:** Piezoelectric generators embedded in both connector and external contact element will harvest energy from the physical connection/disconnection. This supplements electromagnetic induction.
* **Engagement Mechanism:** Utilize a linear actuator (solenoid or shape-memory alloy) to ensure precise alignment between the connector and external contact element for optimal energy transfer. 

**Pseudocode (Device-Side Energy Management):**

```
ON_CONNECTION:
  accessory_id = READ_ACCESSORY_ID()
  accessory_profile = LOAD_PROFILE(accessory_id)

  IF accessory_profile.power_needed:
    supply_power(accessory_profile.request)
  ELSE IF accessory_profile.power_available:
    receive_power(accessory_profile.output)

  WHILE connected:
    harvest_kinetic_energy()
    monitor_voltage_current()
    adjust_power_flow()

  ON_DISCONNECTION:
    stop_power_flow()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Self-Powered Accessories:**  Wireless earbuds, styluses, or remote controls drawing power from the host device.
*   **Battery Boosting:**  An external battery pack providing supplemental power to the device.
*   **Data Transfer:** Utilizing the kinetic energy connection as a secure, short-range data link.
*   **Haptic Feedback Enhancement:**  Accessory providing enhanced haptic feedback powered by the device.
