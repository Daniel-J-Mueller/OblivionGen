## Kinetic Energy Harvesting Cart with Modular Tool Integration

**Concept:** Expand the wheel-based charging concept to include a modular tool interface powered by harvested kinetic energy, creating a self-sufficient mobile workstation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Cart Frame:** Heavy-duty steel alloy frame, modular design with standardized mounting rails (NATO standard preferred). Dimensions: 36” L x 24” W x 36” H. Weight capacity: 250lbs.
*   **Wheel System:** Four omni-directional wheels, each incorporating a high-efficiency DC generator (brushless preferred). Generators rated for 5-12V output. Integrated regenerative braking system.  Wheel diameter: 6”.
*   **Energy Storage:**  Lithium-ion battery pack (48V, 10Ah). Battery management system (BMS) with overcharge, discharge, and thermal protection.  Dedicated charging circuitry for external devices. Wireless charging pad integrated into the cart surface.
*   **Power Distribution:**  Modular power distribution board with multiple output ports:
    *   4x 12V DC ports (Anderson Powerpole connectors).
    *   2x 110V AC outlets (modified sine wave inverter).
    *   USB-A and USB-C charging ports (quick charge 3.0).
    *   Dedicated power supply for onboard computer (see below).
*   **Onboard Computer:** Ruggedized, fanless mini-ITX computer (Intel NUC or equivalent).  Operating system: Linux (Ubuntu preferred).  Wireless network connectivity (802.11ax).  Software: Customizable dashboard displaying energy generation, battery status, and tool power usage. Remote monitoring/control via smartphone app.
*   **Tool Integration:**
    *   Standardized mounting rails along cart sides and top.
    *   Universal tool mounts compatible with common power tools (drills, saws, grinders, etc.).
    *   Automatic tool detection and power activation upon mounting.
    *   Dedicated power ports for each tool mount, regulated to tool's voltage/current requirements.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to track cart motion and calculate energy generation potential.
    *   Load sensors to detect weight distribution and adjust power output accordingly.
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality).

**Pseudocode - Energy Management System:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Read Wheel Generator Output (Voltage, Current)
    wheel_voltage = read_wheel_voltage();
    wheel_current = read_wheel_current();

    // Calculate Instantaneous Power Generated
    power_generated = wheel_voltage * wheel_current;

    // Read Battery State of Charge (SOC)
    battery_soc = read_battery_soc();

    // Prioritize Battery Charging
    if (battery_soc < 95%) {
        charge_battery(power_generated);
    } else {
        // Distribute Power to Tools
        for each tool in tools {
            if (tool.active) {
                power_to_tool = min(tool.power_demand, power_generated);
                tool.apply_power(power_to_tool);
            }
        }
        // Store Excess Power (Future use – e.g., heating/cooling module)
        store_excess_power(power_generated - tool_power_consumption);
    }

    // Monitor System Health (Temperature, Voltage, Current)
    monitor_system_health();
}
```

**Potential Applications:** Construction, maintenance, field repair, disaster relief, mobile robotics platform.
