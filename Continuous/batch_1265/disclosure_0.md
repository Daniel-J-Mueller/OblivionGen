## Automated Resource ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to not only provision resources *during* a deployment pipeline, but to proactively ‘shadow’ resource usage in production environments and preemptively scale resources *before* a deployment, anticipating potential bottlenecks. This creates a ‘warm’ production environment ready for new code.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadow Resource Provisioner Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O, disk I/O) of currently deployed instances of an application.
*   **Data Sources:** Production environment monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic).
*   **Algorithm:** Employs time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future resource demand based on historical data and identified patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal). Incorporates external factors (e.g., marketing campaigns, known events) as inputs to the prediction model.
*   **Output:**  A projected resource demand curve for each resource type.

**2. Predictive Scaling Engine:**

*   **Input:** Projected resource demand curve from the Shadow Resource Provisioner, current resource allocation, defined scaling policies (min/max instances, scaling thresholds).
*   **Function:**  Compares projected demand to current allocation.  If projected demand exceeds current allocation within a defined timeframe, triggers resource provisioning requests *before* the deployment begins. Utilizes a "shadow" infrastructure – a scaled-up version of the production environment existing alongside the live instances. This shadow environment is kept warm and ready to switch over.
*   **Scaling Policies:** Support for:
    *   **Reactive Scaling:** Trigger scaling based on predefined thresholds.
    *   **Proactive Scaling:** Schedule scaling events based on predicted demand.
    *   **Cost-Optimized Scaling:** Balance performance and cost by utilizing spot instances or reserved instances during scaling events.
*   **Output:** Provisioning requests for additional resources.

**3. Deployment Switchover Mechanism:**

*   **Function:** Seamlessly switch traffic from live instances to scaled-up shadow instances.
*   **Implementation:** Leverage load balancers (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancing, Nginx) to gradually shift traffic to the shadow environment.
*   **Health Checks:** Continuous health checks on both live and shadow instances to ensure smooth transition and prevent downtime.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** Automated rollback mechanism to revert to live instances in case of failures.

**4.  Resource Dependency Mapping & Propagation:**

*   **Function:**  Dynamically map dependencies between resources (e.g., database, cache, message queue). During shadow provisioning, automatically provision dependent resources alongside the application resources.
*   **Implementation:** Utilize a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Consul, etcd) to track resource dependencies.
*   **Propagation:** Ensure that configuration changes are propagated to both live and shadow environments.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Scaling Engine):**

```
function predictAndScale(projectedDemand, currentAllocation, scalingPolicies):
  for resourceType in resourceTypes:
    predictedDemandValue = projectedDemand[resourceType]
    currentAllocationValue = currentAllocation[resourceType]

    if predictedDemandValue > currentAllocationValue:
      requiredAdditionalResources = predictedDemandValue - currentAllocationValue
      scalingThreshold = scalingPolicies[resourceType].threshold
      if requiredAdditionalResources > scalingThreshold:
        provisioningRequest = createProvisioningRequest(resourceType, requiredAdditionalResources)
        sendProvisioningRequest(provisioningRequest)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Chaos Engineering Integration:** Simulate failure scenarios in the shadow environment to validate the resilience of the application.
*   **Machine Learning Optimization:** Use machine learning algorithms to optimize scaling policies and reduce resource waste.
*   **Multi-Region Support:** Extend the system to support multi-region deployments and scale resources across multiple regions.
