## Autonomous PDU Load Balancing & Predictive Failure Mitigation

**Concept:** Integrate real-time power consumption data from PDUs with an AI-driven load balancing system *and* predictive failure analysis. This goes beyond simple monitoring; it actively redistributes load to prevent outages *before* they happen and optimizes power usage based on anticipated needs.

**Hardware Specs:**

*   **Enhanced PDU Power Monitors:** Existing PDU power monitors are upgraded with edge computing capabilities (ARM processor, 2GB RAM, 32GB storage). These will handle initial data aggregation and pre-processing. Communication will be via 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) for low latency.
*   **Centralized AI Engine:** A dedicated server cluster (minimum 4 nodes, each with 2x NVIDIA A100 GPUs, 256GB RAM, 4TB NVMe storage) running the load balancing and predictive algorithms.
*   **Programmable Power Distribution Units (P-PDUs):**  Newly deployed PDUs will feature digitally controlled breakers/outlets, allowing for remote power cycling and load redistribution. These must support Modbus TCP/IP and SNMP for communication with the AI Engine.  Standard PDU models can be retrofitted with smart breaker modules if necessary.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Integrate temperature and humidity sensors within each rack to correlate environmental factors with power consumption and potential failures.  Zigbee or Z-Wave protocol for communication.

**Software/Algorithm Specs:**

1.  **Data Acquisition & Pre-processing:**
    *   PDU monitors collect real-time power consumption (voltage, current, power factor) per outlet.
    *   Environmental sensor data collected.
    *   Data normalized and time-stamped.
    *   Edge processing on PDU monitors filters noise and outliers.
2.  **Load Balancing Algorithm:**
    *   **Objective:** Minimize power imbalance across PDUs and prevent exceeding PDU capacity.
    *   **Method:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) â€“ a Q-learning agent learns the optimal policy for redistributing load.
    *   **State:** PDU utilization (%), PDU temperature, environmental conditions (temp, humidity), application priority.
    *   **Action:** Shift workload from one PDU outlet to another.
    *   **Reward:** Positive reward for balanced load, negative reward for exceeding capacity or causing application disruption.
3.  **Predictive Failure Analysis:**
    *   **Method:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network.
    *   **Training Data:** Historical power consumption data, environmental data, failure logs.
    *   **Prediction:** LSTM predicts the probability of failure for each PDU outlet based on current and historical data.
    *   **Thresholds:**  Configurable failure probability thresholds trigger proactive actions (e.g., workload migration, maintenance scheduling).
4.  **Automated Response System:**
    *   Based on prediction and thresholds, the system automatically:
        *   Migrates workloads from at-risk PDUs to healthy ones.
        *   Sends alerts to operators.
        *   Triggers automated maintenance requests.

**Communication Protocol:**

*   PDU monitors -> Central AI Engine: MQTT over TLS for secure, reliable communication.
*   AI Engine -> P-PDUs: Modbus TCP/IP or SNMP for controlling breakers.

**Pseudocode (Workload Migration):**

```
FUNCTION migrateWorkload(PDU_at_risk, PDU_healthy):
    // Get list of VMs/applications running on PDU_at_risk
    VM_list = getVMList(PDU_at_risk)

    // Sort VMs by priority (critical, high, medium, low)
    VM_list.sort(priority)

    FOR each VM in VM_list:
        // Check if VM can be migrated to PDU_healthy
        IF checkMigrationFeasibility(VM, PDU_healthy):
            // Initiate VM migration
            migrateVM(VM, PDU_healthy)
            PRINT "Migrated VM: " + VM.name + " to " + PDU_healthy.name
        ELSE:
            PRINT "Migration failed for VM: " + VM.name
```
