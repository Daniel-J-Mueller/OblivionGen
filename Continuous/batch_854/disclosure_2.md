## Dynamic Contextual Resource ID Projection

**Concept:** Augmenting physical spaces with dynamically generated, short-form resource identifiers projected onto surfaces, triggered by user proximity and contextual awareness. This extends the core idea of shortened URLs beyond digital displays and integrates it seamlessly into the physical world.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Miniature, low-power laser/LED projection units (integrated into existing infrastructure – signage, retail displays, building facades, vehicles). Units should support color projection and variable intensity.
    *   Proximity sensors (Bluetooth beacons, LiDAR, ultrasonic) for detecting user presence and determining distance/angle.
    *   Ambient light sensors to adjust projection brightness for optimal visibility.
    *   Edge computing devices (integrated within projection units) for local data processing and URL generation.
    *   Secure wireless communication module (Wi-Fi 6E, 5G) for synchronization with a central server and access to contextual data.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Context Engine:** Central server responsible for collecting and analyzing contextual data (location, time of day, weather, user demographics – with appropriate privacy controls, current events, trending topics, nearby points of interest).
    *   **Dynamic URL Generator:** Algorithm that generates short-form, memorable resource identifiers based on the contextual data and a defined set of criteria (e.g., relevance, memorability, brand consistency). Utilize a hierarchical system of keywords and a robust shortening service.
    *   **Projection Control Software:** Manages the projection units, synchronizes with the Context Engine, and dynamically adjusts the projected resource identifier (content, color, brightness, animation) based on real-time conditions.
    *   **User Authentication/Personalization (Optional):** Allows users to authenticate via smartphone app to receive personalized resource identifiers (e.g., tailored promotions, relevant information). Privacy must be paramount.

**Workflow:**

1.  A user approaches a physical space equipped with the projection system.
2.  The proximity sensors detect the user's presence and transmit data to the edge computing device.
3.  The edge computing device queries the Context Engine for relevant contextual data.
4.  The Context Engine analyzes the data and transmits it to the edge computing device.
5.  The Dynamic URL Generator creates a short-form resource identifier based on the contextual data.
6.  The edge computing device instructs the projection unit to display the generated resource identifier on a nearby surface.
7.  The user scans the projected resource identifier with their smartphone camera or manually enters it into a web browser.
8.  The shortened URL resolves to the appropriate web page or online resource.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic URL Generation):**

```
function generateDynamicURL(contextData) {
  keywords = extractKeywords(contextData);
  //keywords will be a weighted list
  //weighting is based on importance to customer & context
  priorityKeywords = getTopNKeywords(keywords, 3);
  baseURL = "brand.com/";
  filePath = "";
  for (keyword in priorityKeywords) {
      filePath += keyword + "-";
  }
  filePath = filePath.substring(0, filePath.length - 1); //remove trailing dash
  fullURL = baseURL + filePath;
  shortenedURL = shortenURL(fullURL); // using a 3rd party service
  return shortenedURL;
}

function shortenURL(longURL) {
  // calls a URL shortening API.
  // Implemented using bit.ly or similar.
  return shortenedURL;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Retail:** Displaying product-specific URLs on shelves or displays.
*   **Transportation:** Providing real-time travel information or promotional offers on train platforms or bus stops.
*   **Events:** Linking attendees to event schedules, speaker bios, or interactive maps.
*   **Tourism:** Offering location-based information or directions to nearby attractions.
*   **Emergency Services:** Providing critical information or assistance during emergencies.

This builds on the original patent’s idea of creating memorable shortened URLs, but extends it beyond the digital realm and leverages contextual awareness to create a truly immersive and interactive experience.
