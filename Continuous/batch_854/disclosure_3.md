## Dynamic Texture Shifting Cover

**Concept:** An electronic device cover incorporating microfluidic channels and electrochromic materials to allow for dynamic, user-customizable texture and visual patterns on the cover’s surface.

**Specs:**

*   **Material:** Base layer of rigid polycarbonate. Overlay of transparent, durable elastomer (e.g., silicone) containing embedded microfluidic channels (channel width: 200-500μm, depth: 50-150μm).  Embedded electrochromic polymers within the elastomer, positioned to be visible through the microfluidic channels and from the exterior surface.
*   **Microfluidic System:**  A miniature pump (piezoelectric or peristaltic, dimensions < 1cm³) integrated into the cover.  Reservoir for working fluid (clear, non-conductive, low viscosity) capacity: 0.5ml.  Network of microfluidic channels routed to control areas beneath the elastomer surface.
*   **Electrochromic Control:**  Individual electrodes positioned near each section of electrochromic material.  Electrodes are addressable via a Bluetooth connection to the host device.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging receiver integrated into the cover. Power delivered to microfluidic pump and electrochromic control circuitry.
*   **Software/API:** SDK allowing users to design custom textures and patterns.  Preset library of textures/patterns (wood grain, leather, geometric shapes, animated designs).  API allowing integration with device notifications/alerts (e.g., pulsating texture for incoming calls).  Integration with voice assistant for texture control.

**Operation:**

1.  User selects or designs a texture/pattern via app.
2.  App sends commands to the cover.
3.  Microfluidic pump circulates fluid through designated channels, creating raised/lowered areas on the elastomer surface, changing the tactile texture.
4.  Electrodes activate the electrochromic polymers in corresponding areas, altering the color and visual appearance.
5.  Combination of tactile texture and visual pattern provides a dynamic, customizable user experience.

**Pseudocode (Texture/Pattern Control):**

```
function applyTexture(textureID):
  // Load texture data from library or user design
  textureData = loadTexture(textureID)

  // Iterate through texture data (grid of texture elements)
  for each element in textureData:
    x = element.x
    y = element.y
    height = element.height //desired height for the microfluidic channel
    color = element.color

    //Control Microfluidic Pump
    setPumpFlow(x,y,height) //Actuate pump to create desired height

    //Control Electrochromic material
    setColor(x,y,color)
  end for
end function

function setPumpFlow(x, y, height):
    //Calculate pump rate and duration based on 'height' and channel geometry
    pumpRate = calculatePumpRate(height)
    pumpDuration = calculatePumpDuration(height)
    activatePump(x, y, pumpRate, pumpDuration)
end function

function setColor(x, y, color):
    //Apply voltage to electrodes to activate electrochromic material
    electrodeVoltage = calculateVoltage(color)
    applyVoltage(x, y, electrodeVoltage)
end function
```
