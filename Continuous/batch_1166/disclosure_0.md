## Dynamic Complexity Weighting for Predictive Statmuxing

**Specification:**

This design introduces a system for dynamically weighting complexity and quality data based on predicted future frame characteristics, rather than solely relying on current frame data. This aims to improve statmux efficiency and reduce buffering/latency issues, particularly with content exhibiting rapid complexity changes (e.g., fast action scenes, scene transitions).

**Components:**

1.  **Frame Prediction Module:** This module analyzes past frame data (complexity, quality, motion vectors, scene cuts) for each channel to predict the complexity and quality of *future* frames (e.g., the next 3-5 frames).  Prediction can utilize time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) trained per channel type/content source.

2.  **Weighted Data Aggregation:**  Instead of directly using current frame complexity and quality scores, the system calculates a weighted average incorporating *predicted* future values.  The weighting function prioritizes future frames, diminishing the weight of past frames.

    *   `WeightedComplexity(t) = α * Complexity(t) + β * PredictedComplexity(t+1) + γ * PredictedComplexity(t+2) + ...`
    *   `WeightedQuality(t) = α * Quality(t) + β * PredictedQuality(t+1) + γ * PredictedQuality(t+2) + ...`

    Where:
    *   `t` = current frame
    *   `α`, `β`, `γ`… are weighting coefficients (summing to 1) that define the emphasis on current vs. future frames. These coefficients can be dynamically adjusted based on content type or observed prediction accuracy.

3.  **Adaptive Weighting Control:** This component monitors the accuracy of the Frame Prediction Module. If predictions consistently deviate from actual frame characteristics, the weighting coefficients are adjusted to reduce the influence of future predictions.  Metrics used for accuracy assessment include:

    *   Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between predicted and actual complexity/quality scores.
    *   Frequency of prediction errors exceeding a defined threshold.

4.  **Statmux Integration:** The weighted complexity and quality data are then fed into the existing statmux algorithm to determine channel activation and bitrate allocation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Per Channel
FOR each frame t:

    //Frame Prediction Module
    predictedComplexity = FramePredictionModule(pastFrames)
    predictedQuality = FramePredictionModule(pastFrames)

    //Adaptive Weighting Control
    error = CalculateError(predictedComplexity, predictedQuality, actualComplexity, actualQuality)
    IF error > threshold:
        α = 0.7  // Increase weight of current frame
        β = 0.2
        γ = 0.1
    ELSE:
        α = 0.3
        β = 0.4
        γ = 0.3

    //Weighted Data Aggregation
    weightedComplexity = α * Complexity(t) + β * predictedComplexity(t+1) + γ * predictedComplexity(t+2)
    weightedQuality = α * Quality(t) + β * predictedQuality(t+1) + γ * predictedQuality(t+2)

    //Statmux Input
    StatmuxAlgorithm(weightedComplexity, weightedQuality)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved statmux efficiency by anticipating channel demands.
*   Reduced buffering and latency due to proactive resource allocation.
*   Enhanced quality of service for channels with rapidly changing content.
*   Greater resilience to network fluctuations.
