## Dynamic Resource Swapping & Predictive Transcoding

**Concept:** Expand upon the unused resource utilization by introducing a system that *predicts* resource needs *before* they arise and proactively swaps resources between customers – even *before* a transcoding job is explicitly requested. This moves beyond reactive utilization of spare capacity and towards a dynamic, predictive allocation model.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical transcoding request data (customer, file type, duration, complexity).
    *   Real-time monitoring of customer workloads (CPU, memory, network usage).
    *   Calendar data (scheduled events, known peak times).
    *   External data sources (news events impacting video consumption – sporting events, breaking news).
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network) to predict future transcoding demand for each customer. The model should learn patterns in historical data and adjust predictions based on real-time factors.
*   **Output:** A probabilistic forecast of transcoding resource requirements (CPU cores, memory, storage) for each customer over a defined time horizon (e.g., next 12 hours).  Include confidence intervals for each prediction.

**2. Resource Swapping Mechanism:**

*   **Resource Pool:** Maintain a pool of reservable resource instances.
*   **Swap Trigger:** If the predictive engine forecasts increased demand for customer A *and* forecasts excess capacity for customer B, initiate a resource swap.
*   **Swap Procedure:**
    1.  Identify available resource instances that can be seamlessly moved from customer B to customer A.
    2.  Migrate the virtual machines/containers hosting the resources. Minimize downtime using live migration techniques.
    3.  Update resource allocation metadata to reflect the new ownership.
*   **Swap Priority:** Prioritize swaps based on the potential for cost savings and performance improvements.

**3. Transcoding Job Scheduling & Optimization:**

*   **Preemptive Scheduling:** When a swap is predicted, the system may preempt lower-priority transcoding jobs on customer B to free up resources.
*   **Job Fragmentation Avoidance:** Distribute transcoding jobs across available resource instances to minimize fragmentation and maximize resource utilization.
*   **Dynamic Bitrate Selection:** Automatically select optimal bitrates based on network conditions and device capabilities.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Segment large media files and transcode them in parallel using multiple resource instances.

**Pseudocode (Resource Swap):**

```
FUNCTION InitiateResourceSwap(CustomerA, CustomerB, ForecastedDemandA, ExcessCapacityB):
  IF ForecastedDemandA > CurrentResourcesA AND ExcessCapacityB > 0:
    IdentifyAvailableInstances(CustomerB, ExcessCapacityB)
    FOR EACH Instance IN AvailableInstances:
      IF Instance.Priority < CurrentJob.Priority:
        LiveMigrate(Instance, CustomerA)
        UpdateResourceAllocation(Instance, CustomerA)
        LogSwapEvent(CustomerA, CustomerB, Instance)
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION LiveMigrate(Instance, DestinationCustomer):
  // Implementation details of live migration (VMware vMotion, KVM live migration, etc.)
  // Capture Instance state, transfer to DestinationCustomer, resume execution
ENDFUNCTION
```

**4.  Constraint Integration:**  Extend existing constraints (bid price, maximum timeframe) to incorporate a “resource swap tolerance” – a willingness to accept temporary resource relocation for cost savings.
