## Dynamic Workload Shaping via Predictive Token Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the token bucket system to *proactively* adjust token fill rates based on predicted workload demands *before* latency increases are observed, coupled with a tiered token system reflecting workload priority. This aims to move beyond reactive throttling to anticipatory resource management, optimizing for both performance and efficient resource utilization.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Workload Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical workload data (request rates, request sizes, request types), real-time system metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, network I/O), external event feeds (e.g., scheduled batch jobs, marketing campaign launches).
*   **Processing:**  Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM neural network) to predict future workload demands for each customer (or customer segment).  The model outputs a predicted request rate and estimated resource consumption for a defined future time window (e.g., next 5 minutes, next hour).
*   **Output:**  Predicted workload demand profile for each customer/segment â€“ a time series of expected request rates and resource usage.

**2. Tiered Token System:**

*   **Token Types:** Implement multiple token types (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold) representing different priority levels.  Each token type has a corresponding fill rate and potential resource allocation.
*   **Dynamic Allocation:** The predictive workload module determines the optimal mix of token types to allocate to each customer.  Customers with predicted high workloads receive a larger proportion of higher-priority tokens (e.g., Silver/Gold).  Low-priority tasks can be allocated Bronze tokens.
*   **Token Exchange:**  Allow customers to *exchange* token types (within limits) based on their evolving needs.  This provides flexibility and allows them to prioritize critical tasks.

**3. Adaptive Fill Rate Control:**

*   **Base Fill Rate:** Establish a base fill rate for each token type.
*   **Predictive Adjustment:**  The system adjusts the fill rate for each token type *proactively* based on the predicted workload.  If the predictive workload module forecasts an increase in demand, the fill rate is increased *before* latency increases. Conversely, if demand is predicted to decrease, the fill rate is reduced.
*   **Reactive Override:**  Maintain the existing reactive throttling mechanism as a safety net.  If the predictive model is inaccurate and latency does increase, the reactive throttling kicks in to prevent performance degradation.
*   **Fill Rate Calculation (Pseudocode):**
    ```
    function calculateFillRate(customer, tokenType, predictedWorkload):
      baseFillRate = getTokenBaseFillRate(tokenType)
      workloadFactor = scale(predictedWorkload)  //Scale workload to a factor between 0 and 1
      adjustmentFactor = workloadFactor * adjustmentMultiplier //adjustMultiplier tuned empirically
      adjustedFillRate = baseFillRate + (adjustmentFactor * baseFillRate)
      return max(0, adjustedFillRate) //Ensure fill rate is not negative
    ```

**4.  Resource Allocation Mapping:**

*   Establish a mapping between token types and resource allocation. For example, Silver tokens might guarantee a certain percentage of CPU and memory resources.
*   The system dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on the number of active tokens of each type.

**5. Monitoring and Feedback Loop:**

*   Continuously monitor system performance metrics (latency, CPU usage, memory usage).
*   Use this data to refine the predictive model and improve its accuracy.
*   Implement an automated feedback loop to adjust the adjustmentMultiplier in the fill rate calculation to optimize performance.
