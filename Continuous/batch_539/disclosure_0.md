## Dynamic Contextual Action Proposals - 'Ripple'

**Core Concept:** Extend beyond pre-defined application templates. Instead, dynamically *propose* actions to users based on semantic understanding of the message thread, and allow user ‘steering’ of action generation.  This goes beyond template *selection* – it’s template *creation* on-the-fly, guided by user feedback.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Contextual Semantic Graph (CSG):**  Construct a CSG for the message thread. Nodes represent entities (people, places, times, objects, activities). Edges represent relationships between entities, weighted by semantic strength derived from NLP analysis.  Crucially, include ‘intention’ nodes inferred from user language – e.g., “planning,” “requesting,” “offering”.

2.  **Action Proposal Engine (APE):** The APE traverses the CSG, identifying potential actions based on node/edge configurations.  It doesn't rely on pre-defined templates. Instead, it uses a knowledge base of *atomic actions* (e.g., "create calendar event," "send email," "search maps," "order food," "play music," "initiate video call").  It *combines* these atomic actions to form composite action proposals.

3.  **Proposal Ranking & Filtering:**  Rank action proposals based on:
    *   **CSG Strength:**  How strongly the proposal is supported by the CSG (i.e., how many relevant nodes/edges it utilizes).
    *   **User History:**  The user's past action preferences (e.g., they always use a specific food delivery app).
    *   **Contextual Relevance:**  How well the proposal fits the current conversation (avoiding irrelevant suggestions).

4.  **User Steering Interface (USI):**  Present the top-ranked action proposals to the user in a non-intrusive UI element (e.g., a subtle suggestion bar).  Critically, allow the user to:
    *   **Accept/Reject:**  Simple acceptance or rejection of a proposal.
    *   **Modify:**  Edit the proposal before accepting it (e.g., change the time of a calendar event, specify a different restaurant).
    *   **Explore Alternatives:**  Request the APE to generate more action proposals, potentially refining the search based on user feedback.

5.  **Action Execution Engine (AEE):**  Once the user accepts a proposal, the AEE handles the actual execution of the action, interacting with relevant apps and services.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Action Proposal Generation):**

```
function generateActionProposals(CSG):
  proposals = []
  for each node in CSG:
    for each edge connected to node:
      action = findPossibleActions(node, edge) // Retrieves actions based on node/edge type
      if action != null:
        proposal = createProposal(action)
        proposals.append(proposal)

  // Rank proposals based on CSG strength, user history, contextual relevance
  rankedProposals = rankProposals(proposals)
  return rankedProposals

function findPossibleActions(node, edge):
  // Knowledge base lookup based on node and edge types
  // Example: If node = "Restaurant" and edge = "Nearby", return "Search Maps", "Order Food"
  return actionList

function createProposal(action):
  // Construct a proposal object with action details, required data fields, etc.
  return proposalObject
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond *selecting* from pre-defined actions. It dynamically *creates* action proposals based on a deep understanding of the conversation, guided by user feedback. This allows for a much more flexible and personalized experience.  It isn't just anticipating needs; it’s *collaboratively* defining them.  The user effectively ‘trains’ the system to understand their preferences and anticipates their needs over time.
