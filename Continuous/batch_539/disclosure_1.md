## Adaptive Protocol Swarm for Distributed Rendering

**Concept:** Extend dynamic protocol switching beyond simply adjusting *to* a client. Instead, orchestrate a *swarm* of protocols and rendering tasks, distributing load and optimizing for fluctuating client and network conditions, *across multiple edge servers*. This isn't about choosing *one* protocol; it's about intelligently layering and coordinating several, dynamically.

**Specifications:**

**1. Protocol Suite:**

*   **Core Protocols:** HLS, DASH, WebRTC, SRT.
*   **Adaptive Sub-Protocols:** Within each core protocol, variations based on resolution, bitrate, error correction level, and transport mechanisms (TCP, UDP, QUIC).  Each sub-protocol is treated as a distinct “rendering slice.”

**2. Rendering Slice Management:**

*   **Content Segmentation:**  The video stream is segmented into small “tiles” or “slices” (e.g., 64x64 pixels).
*   **Slice Assignment:** Each slice is assigned a protocol/sub-protocol combination based on real-time client conditions (bandwidth, latency, CPU load) *and* edge server load/capabilities.
*   **Dynamic Re-Assignment:** Slices can be *re-assigned* to different protocols/servers mid-stream, based on changing conditions.  This is crucial for handling transient network issues or server congestion.

**3. Edge Server Coordination:**

*   **Distributed Rendering Engine:** Each edge server hosts a portion of the rendering pipeline.
*   **Slice Orchestrator:** A central (or distributed) orchestrator manages slice assignment and communication between edge servers.
*   **Load Balancing:** The orchestrator dynamically balances load across edge servers, considering both network proximity to the client and server capacity.

**4. Client-Side Composition:**

*   **Adaptive Receiver:** The client receives slices via multiple protocols.
*   **Composition Engine:** The client-side (or a proxy) reassembles the slices into a coherent video stream.  Error concealment and frame interpolation are employed to minimize the impact of packet loss or jitter.

**Pseudocode (Slice Orchestrator):**

```
function assign_slices(client_profile, server_list, content_info):
  slices = segment_content(content_info)
  assignment = {}

  for slice in slices:
    best_server = null
    best_protocol = null
    best_score = -1

    for server in server_list:
      for protocol in server.supported_protocols:
        score = calculate_score(client_profile, server, protocol)
        if score > best_score:
          best_score = score
          best_server = server
          best_protocol = protocol

    assignment[slice] = (best_server, best_protocol)

  return assignment

function calculate_score(client_profile, server, protocol):
  bandwidth_score =  (client_profile.bandwidth / protocol.max_bandwidth) * weight_bandwidth
  latency_score = (server.latency_to_client / protocol.max_latency) * weight_latency
  server_load_score = (1 - server.current_load) * weight_server_load
  #Add additional factors (CPU load, memory)
  return bandwidth_score + latency_score + server_load_score
```

**5. Protocol “Fitness” Tracking:**

*   Real-time monitoring of each protocol’s performance (packet loss, jitter, throughput) on different client profiles.
*   Dynamic adjustment of the `calculate_score` function based on observed performance.  Less reliable protocols are penalized.
*   The system learns which protocols perform best under different conditions, improving future slice assignments.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple protocol switching to actively *orchestrate* a multi-protocol rendering environment.  By distributing rendering tasks across multiple servers and dynamically adapting to changing conditions, it can significantly improve resilience, scalability, and user experience, especially in challenging network environments.
