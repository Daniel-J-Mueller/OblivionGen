## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System – “EchoTouch”

**Concept:** Extend audio tap detection to trigger localized haptic feedback, creating an ‘echo’ of the tap sensation.  This moves beyond simple action initiation (projecting content, audio output) to a more immersive, sensory experience.  Imagine tapping a table to ‘feel’ a virtual button press, or receiving tactile confirmation of a voice command.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar) integrated into a surface (table, desk, wearable band, screen bezel). Actuator density: variable, targeted at 50-100 actuators per square foot for localized effects, lower density for broader feedback.
    *   High-resolution surface mapping system (capacitive or optical) to track tap location with millimeter accuracy.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (integrated with existing audio processing) for real-time event detection and actuator control.
    *   Wireless communication module (Bluetooth 5.0 or Wi-Fi 6) for potential integration with external devices.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Tap Location Algorithm:** Refines tap location from surface mapping data, accounting for surface irregularities and user input force.
    *   **Haptic Waveform Generator:** Translates detected tap characteristics (duration, power) into a corresponding haptic waveform.  Waveform parameters: amplitude, frequency, duration, decay.
    *   **Actuator Control System:** Dynamically adjusts the activation of individual actuators to create the illusion of a localized ‘pulse’ emanating from the tap location.  Implementation: phased array activation for beamforming effect.
    *   **Adaptive Learning Module:** Uses machine learning to personalize the haptic feedback experience based on user preferences and tap style. Factors: tap force, tap duration, preferred waveform characteristics.
    *   **API for Developer Integration:** Provides tools for developers to integrate EchoTouch into their applications and create custom haptic experiences.

*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Waveform Generation):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION GenerateHapticWaveform(tapDuration, tapPower)

    // Define base waveform parameters
    baseAmplitude = tapPower * 0.5  // Scale amplitude to power
    baseFrequency = 200 Hz
    baseDuration = tapDuration * 0.8

    // Apply adaptive modifications based on user profile (if available)
    IF UserProfile.PreferredAmplitude > 0 THEN
        amplitude = UserProfile.PreferredAmplitude * amplitude
    ELSE
        amplitude = amplitude
    ENDIF

    IF UserProfile.PreferredFrequency > 0 THEN
        frequency = UserProfile.PreferredFrequency
    ELSE
        frequency = baseFrequency
    ENDIF

    // Create waveform (e.g., sine wave with envelope)
    waveform = SineWave(frequency, amplitude, baseDuration)

    // Apply decay envelope for realistic pulse
    waveform = ApplyDecay(waveform, 0.2 seconds)

    RETURN waveform

END FUNCTION
```
