## Automated Database Canary Deployment & Rollback via Predictive Analysis

**Specification:** A system extending the described self-service control environment to incorporate predictive analytics for automated canary deployments and rollbacks of database schema changes, minimizing downtime and risk.

**Components:**

*   **Schema Change API:** An extension of the existing API to accept database schema change requests (DDL statements). This API will enforce mandatory tagging of changes with a "risk score" (1-10) based on impact assessment by the requesting user.
*   **Predictive Analysis Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical database performance metrics (CPU utilization, memory usage, query latency, error rates), change logs (DDL statements, user tagging), and rollback events. This engine predicts the potential impact of a proposed schema change *before* deployment.
*   **Canary Deployment Manager:** A workflow component responsible for automatically deploying the schema change to a small subset of the database instances (the “canary” group).
*   **Real-time Monitoring & Alerting:** Continuous monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) in both the canary and production environments. KPIs include query latency, error rates, and resource utilization.
*   **Automated Rollback System:** Triggered by the Real-time Monitoring & Alerting component when KPIs deviate significantly from baseline in the canary environment, or if the Predictive Analysis Engine detects a high probability of failure.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Schema Change Request:** A user submits a schema change request via the Schema Change API, including the DDL statement and a risk score.
2.  **Predictive Analysis:** The Predictive Analysis Engine analyzes the DDL statement, risk score, and historical data to predict the potential impact of the change. It generates a "confidence score" for successful deployment.
3.  **Deployment Decision:** If the confidence score is above a predefined threshold (e.g., 80%), the Canary Deployment Manager proceeds with deployment. Otherwise, the request is flagged for manual review.
4.  **Canary Deployment:** The Canary Deployment Manager deploys the schema change to the designated canary group.
5.  **Real-time Monitoring:** The Real-time Monitoring component continuously monitors KPIs in both the canary and production environments.
6.  **Performance Comparison:** KPIs are compared between the canary and production environments. Significant deviations trigger an alert.
7.  **Automated Rollback (if needed):** If KPIs in the canary environment deviate significantly from baseline or if the Predictive Analysis Engine detects a high probability of failure, the Automated Rollback System automatically reverts the schema change in the canary group.
8.  **Full Deployment (if successful):** If the canary deployment is successful and KPIs remain stable, the system automatically deploys the schema change to the remaining production instances.
9.  **Model Retraining:** The Predictive Analysis Engine is continuously retrained with new data to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Automated Rollback System):**

```
function rollback_schema_change(canary_group, previous_schema):
  // Stop all new writes to the canary group
  disable_writes(canary_group)

  // Revert schema changes to the previous version
  apply_schema(canary_group, previous_schema)

  // Restart database instances in the canary group
  restart_instances(canary_group)

  // Enable writes to the canary group
  enable_writes(canary_group)

  // Log the rollback event
  log_event("Schema change rollback successful")

  return success
```

**Data Stores:**

*   Historical Database Performance Metrics
*   Schema Change Logs
*   Rollback Event Logs
*   Predictive Analysis Model

**Novelty:** This system extends the self-service environment with proactive risk assessment and automated mitigation.  Existing database change management tools typically rely on manual review or simple rollback procedures. The predictive analysis component and automated rollback system provide a significant improvement in reliability and reduce downtime.
