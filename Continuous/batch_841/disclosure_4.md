**Adaptive Volumetric Display with Haptic Feedback**

**Concept:** Extend the structured light system to create a true volumetric display, not just a 2D projection onto a surface. Integrate localized haptic feedback using focused ultrasound, synchronized with the projected structured light.

**Specifications:**

*   **Light Source:** Array of micro-projectors (Digital Micromirror Devices or Liquid Crystal on Silicon) emitting both visible and non-visible (IR, potentially UV) light.  The array will be dense to create a high-resolution volumetric space.
*   **Wavelength Modulation:**  Individual control of wavelength for each micro-projector.  Visible light for image creation, IR for structured light. UV for potential localized excitation of phosphorescent materials within the volumetric display space (described below).
*   **Volumetric Display Space:**  Filled with a non-toxic, optically clear fluid containing microscopic, biocompatible phosphorescent particles. The density of particles will be calibrated for optimal light scattering and persistence of vision.
*   **Structured Light Pattern Generation:**  Algorithms generating complex, dynamic structured light patterns for both 3D scene reconstruction *and* localized excitation of the phosphorescent particles. The IR structured light will rapidly scan and illuminate particles at precise coordinates to “draw” 3D images that persist after the IR light is removed.
*   **Haptic Feedback System:** Array of focused ultrasound transducers. Each transducer is aligned with a micro-projector/phosphorescent particle volume. The system generates localized pressure waves that create tactile sensations on the surface of the hand or object interacting with the volumetric display.  The intensity and frequency of the ultrasound will be controlled by the same algorithms driving the light sources, creating synchronized visual and haptic experiences.
*   **Camera System:** Multi-camera array capturing the IR structured light reflections and visible light emissions. Provides real-time 3D scene reconstruction and hand/object tracking.
*   **Computing Device:** High-performance computing cluster running algorithms for:
    *   3D Scene Reconstruction
    *   Hand/Object Tracking
    *   Structured Light Pattern Generation
    *   Haptic Feedback Control
    *   Synchronization of all components

**Pseudocode – Core Loop:**

```
LOOP:
  // Capture scene data with camera array
  scene_data = capture_scene()

  // Reconstruct 3D scene from camera data
  point_cloud = reconstruct_scene(scene_data)

  // Detect hands/objects in point cloud
  objects = detect_objects(point_cloud)

  // Calculate desired visual and haptic effects based on objects
  effects = calculate_effects(objects)

  // Generate structured light patterns for visual and haptic feedback
  structured_light_pattern = generate_structured_light_pattern(effects)
  haptic_pattern = generate_haptic_pattern(effects)

  // Project structured light pattern onto the volumetric space
  project_structured_light(structured_light_pattern)

  // Activate focused ultrasound transducers to generate haptic feedback
  activate_ultrasound_transducers(haptic_pattern)

  // Repeat
ENDLOOP
```

**Innovation:**  This combines true volumetric display with localized haptic feedback, creating a fully immersive experience where users can “touch” and interact with projected 3D images. The use of phosphorescent particles enhances persistence of vision and reduces flicker, while focused ultrasound enables precise tactile sensations.  This surpasses existing holographic or 2D projection-based AR systems.
