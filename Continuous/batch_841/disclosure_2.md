## Dynamic Trust Scoring with Behavioral Biometrics & Predictive Posture Analysis

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:** Integrate continuous behavioral biometric analysis with predictive security posture assessments to dynamically adjust access permissions *during* a session, rather than relying solely on initial authentication and posture checks.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Biometrics Engine (BBE):**
    *   **Data Sources:** Keyboard dynamics (keystroke timing, pressure), mouse movement (speed, acceleration, patterns), touchscreen interactions (pressure, swipe speed, multi-touch gestures), scrolling behavior, application usage patterns.
    *   **Machine Learning Models:**  Anomaly detection models (autoencoders, isolation forests) trained on per-user baseline behavior.  Models continuously updated with real-time data.  Output: A “Behavioral Risk Score” (0-100, lower is better) representing deviation from established norms.
    *   **API:** Provides real-time Behavioral Risk Score to the Policy Enforcement Engine.

2.  **Predictive Posture Analysis Module (PPAM):**
    *   **Data Sources:** System logs, network traffic analysis, real-time application monitoring, threat intelligence feeds.  Focus on identifying changes in system configuration, newly installed software, unusual network connections, and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Machine Learning Models:**  Predictive models trained on historical security incident data.  Models identify potential security risks *before* they are exploited. Output: A “Predictive Risk Score” (0-100, lower is better) indicating the likelihood of a security breach.
    *   **API:** Provides real-time Predictive Risk Score to the Policy Enforcement Engine.

3.  **Policy Enforcement Engine (PEE):**
    *   **Input:** Behavioral Risk Score, Predictive Risk Score, Initial Posture Assessment, User Identity, Service Requested.
    *   **Logic:** Implements a dynamic policy engine that adjusts access permissions based on a combined risk score.
        *   **Combined Risk Score =  w1 * Behavioral Risk Score + w2 * Predictive Risk Score + w3 * Initial Posture Score** (Weights w1, w2, w3 configurable per service/application).
        *   **Permission Adjustment Levels:**
            *   **Level 1 (Combined Risk Score < 30):** Full access.
            *   **Level 2 (30 <= Combined Risk Score < 60):**  Limited access (e.g., read-only access to sensitive data).  Multi-factor authentication challenge.
            *   **Level 3 (60 <= Combined Risk Score < 90):**  Restricted access (e.g., session monitoring, application restrictions).  Immediate session termination warning.
            *   **Level 4 (Combined Risk Score >= 90):**  Immediate session termination.
    *   **API:** Enforces permission adjustments based on policy rules.

4.  **Client Agent:**
    *   Collects behavioral biometric data.
    *   Monitors system events (application launches, network connections).
    *   Sends data to the Behavioral Biometrics Engine and Predictive Posture Analysis Module.

**Pseudocode (Policy Enforcement Engine):**

```
function enforcePolicy(userID, serviceID, behavioralScore, predictiveScore, initialPostureScore):
  w1 = getConfigValue("weight_behavioral", serviceID)  // Retrieve weight from configuration
  w2 = getConfigValue("weight_predictive", serviceID)
  w3 = getConfigValue("weight_initial", serviceID)

  combinedScore = (w1 * behavioralScore) + (w2 * predictiveScore) + (w3 * initialPostureScore)

  if combinedScore < 30:
    accessLevel = "FULL"
  else if combinedScore < 60:
    accessLevel = "LIMITED"
    triggerMFAChallenge(userID)
  else if combinedScore < 90:
    accessLevel = "RESTRICTED"
    logSessionActivity(userID)
  else:
    accessLevel = "TERMINATED"
    terminateSession(userID)

  return accessLevel
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User authenticates (initial posture assessment).
2.  Client Agent collects behavioral data and system events.
3.  Data sent to BBE and PPAM.
4.  BBE and PPAM calculate risk scores.
5.  PEE receives risk scores and applies dynamic policy.
6.  Access permissions adjusted accordingly.
7.  Continuous monitoring and adaptation.

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static security postures to provide a *dynamic* security layer that adapts to user behavior and system conditions in real-time. It leverages behavioral biometrics and predictive analysis to identify and mitigate threats *during* a session, rather than solely relying on initial authentication.
