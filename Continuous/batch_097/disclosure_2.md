## Dynamic Audio Scene Composition for Live Events

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple audio *descriptions* to full dynamic audio *scene composition* layered *over* or alongside the original live event audio. The system doesn't just describe *what* is happening, but actively remixes and augments the audio to create a more immersive and informative experience tailored to the user’s preferences.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Audio Scene Composer (ASC).
*   **Input:** Video stream (same as patent), user profile (preference data – see below).
*   **Output:** Dynamically generated multi-channel audio stream.

**User Profile Data:**

*   **Descriptive Level:** (None, Minimal, Standard, Detailed, Hyper-Detailed). Controls verbosity of audio additions.
*   **Sensory Focus:** (Visual, Tactical, Emotional). Bias the audio towards specific types of information. Example: “Tactical” would prioritize sound cues relating to player positioning and movement.
*   **Audio Preference:** (Realistic, Stylized, Abstract).  Controls the *style* of additional audio.  “Realistic” would use authentic sound effects; “Stylized” might use synthesized sounds or music; “Abstract” could involve non-literal sound representations of events.
*   **Accessibility Needs:** (Visually Impaired, Hearing Impaired, Cognitive Differences).  Triggers specific audio augmentation strategies.
*   **Team/Player Focus**: User can prioritize audio focus on specific players or teams.

**Processing Pipeline:**

1.  **Visual Element Identification:** (Uses the patent’s ML models).  Identifies players, objects, field markings, referees, etc.
2.  **Semantic Representation:** (Same as patent).  Understands *what* is happening (e.g., “player shooting a ball”, “referee making a call”).
3.  **Audio Cue Selection:** Based on semantic representation *and* user profile.  This module chooses appropriate audio cues (sound effects, music, synthesized sounds, verbal announcements) to represent the event.  A cue database is required.
4.  **Spatial Audio Mixing:**  Crucially, audio cues are positioned *spatially* in a 3D audio space. This creates the illusion that sounds are coming from specific locations on the field, mirroring the visual scene. The system needs precise tracking of player positions and movement.
5.  **Dynamic Mixing & Layering:** The ASC dynamically adjusts the volume and panning of audio cues in real-time, based on:
    *   The intensity of the event (e.g., louder sounds for a slam dunk, quieter sounds for a player walking).
    *   The proximity of objects to the "listener" (virtual position of the user).
    *   Competing audio in the original live stream. (Automatic Ducking).
6.  **Original Audio Integration:** The dynamically generated audio is mixed *with* the original live event audio.  The mix ratio is adjustable by the user, allowing them to prioritize the added audio or the original broadcast.
7.  **Output:** Multi-channel audio stream delivered to the client device.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Cue Selection):**

```
function selectCue(semanticRepresentation, userProfile):
  if semanticRepresentation == "player shooting a ball":
    if userProfile.audioPreference == "Realistic":
      cue = "basketball_shot_realistic.wav"
    elif userProfile.audioPreference == "Stylized":
      cue = "basketball_shot_synthesized.wav"
    else:
      cue = "basketball_shot_abstract.wav"

  elif semanticRepresentation == "referee making a call":
    if userProfile.sensoryFocus == "Tactical":
      cue = "referee_whistle_directional.wav"
    else:
      cue = "referee_announcement.wav"

  else:
    cue = null

  return cue
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance processors for real-time audio processing.
*   Spatial audio rendering engine.
*   Large, curated sound effects library.
*   Machine learning models for visual element identification.
*   Network infrastructure for low-latency audio streaming.
