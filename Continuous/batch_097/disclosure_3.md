**Dynamic Parameter Weighting for Predictive Caching**

**Concept:** Expand on the normalization concept by introducing *dynamic* parameter weighting during request modification. Instead of simply replacing a numeric parameter with a fixed value, the system learns to *weight* parameters based on historical request patterns and service responses. This allows for more nuanced normalization and better prediction of cache hits.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Continuously logs incoming requests, including all parameters and their values.
    *   Records corresponding service responses.
    *   Stores data in a time-series database.

2.  **Weighting Model (Machine Learning):**
    *   Employs a regression-based model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on the logged data.
    *   Model inputs: Request parameters (numeric and categorical).
    *   Model output: Weights assigned to each parameter. Higher weight = greater influence on normalization.
    *   Retraining schedule: Weekly/Daily based on performance metrics (cache hit rate, response time).

3.  **Normalization Engine:**
    *   Receives incoming request.
    *   Fetches current parameter weights from the Weighting Model.
    *   For each numeric parameter:
        *   Calculate a modified value: `Modified Value = Original Value * (1 + Weight)`
        *   Apply clipping to prevent excessive modification (e.g., limit the modified value within a +/- 20% range of the original).
    *   For categorical parameters: Assign probabilities based on weight.
    *   Construct normalized request using modified parameters.

4.  **Cache Interaction:**
    *   Store the *normalized request* as the cache key, along with the corresponding service response.
    *   When a request arrives:
        *   Normalize the request using the Weighting Model.
        *   Check if the normalized request exists in the cache.
        *   If found, return the cached response.

5.  **A/B Testing & Evaluation:**
    *   Implement A/B testing to compare the performance of the dynamic weighting system against the original normalization approach (fixed replacement values).
    *   Metrics: Cache hit rate, average response time, system throughput.
    *   Automated monitoring and alerting to identify performance regressions.

**Pseudocode (Normalization Engine):**

```
function normalizeRequest(request, weightingModel):
  normalizedRequest = request.copy()

  for each parameter in request.parameters:
    if parameter.type == "numeric":
      weight = weightingModel.getWeight(parameter.name)
      modifiedValue = parameter.value * (1 + weight)
      modifiedValue = clamp(modifiedValue, parameter.minValue, parameter.maxValue) //Prevent extreme values
      parameter.value = modifiedValue
    else if parameter.type == "categorical":
      probabilities = weightingModel.getProbabilities(parameter.name)
      // Sample a new value based on the probabilities
      parameter.value = sampleFromDistribution(probabilities)

  return normalizedRequest
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Cache Hit Rate:** More intelligent normalization can lead to a greater number of successful cache lookups.
*   **Adaptive Behavior:** The system automatically adapts to changing request patterns and data distributions.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Parameter weighting provides fine-grained control over the normalization process.
*   **Reduced Latency:** Higher cache hit rates result in lower average response times.
