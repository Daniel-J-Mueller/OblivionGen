**Adaptive Keyboard Macro Generation via Behavioral Analysis**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Behavioral Analysis Engine (BAE) â€“ Software module running in the background, monitoring keyboard and mouse input patterns.
*   **Data Storage:** Local user profile database storing observed input sequences, application context (active window title, process ID), and timestamps.  Data is anonymized and optionally cloud-synchronized for cross-device learning (user opt-in required).
*   **Keyboard Interface:** Modified keyboard driver/overlay allowing for dynamically generated macro keys/shortcuts.  Visual indication of active macro learning/suggestion.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated thread within the keyboard driver/application to execute BAE and manage macro generation/assignment.
*   **Communication:** API for external applications to provide contextual hints to the BAE (e.g., a website indicates a specific form field is being focused).

**Innovation Description:**

The system learns user behavior by observing repeated keyboard and mouse input sequences within specific application contexts.  Instead of relying on pre-defined macros or user-created shortcuts, it *predicts* likely input sequences and suggests corresponding automated actions.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Background Thread: Behavioral Analysis Engine

Loop:
    InputEvent = GetNextKeyboardOrMouseEvent()
    If InputEvent:
        Context = GetApplicationContext() //Window title, process ID, etc.
        Sequence = BuildInputSequence(InputEvent, Context) //Concatenate recent inputs
        SimilarityScore = CalculateSequenceSimilarity(Sequence, HistoricalSequences[Context])
        If SimilarityScore > Threshold:
            PredictedSequence = IdentifyMostFrequentSequence(HistoricalSequences[Context], Sequence)
            If PredictedSequence Exists and Not Currently Active:
                SuggestMacroActivation(PredictedSequence) //Visual prompt on keyboard
                If UserAcceptsMacro:
                    ExecuteMacro(PredictedSequence)
                    RecordSuccessfulPrediction(PredictedSequence)
        Else:
            RecordNewInputSequence(Sequence, Context)
        UpdateHistoricalSequences(Sequence, Context)
```

**Macro Execution:**

When a predicted sequence is accepted, the system simulates the corresponding keyboard/mouse events.  This is done by injecting the appropriate input events directly into the operating system, bypassing the need for the user to physically perform the actions.

**Dynamic Macro Key Assignment:**

The keyboard driver dynamically assigns unused or remappable keys to the most frequently predicted macros.  The user can customize this assignment or disable the automatic feature.

**Adaptive Learning:**

The BAE continuously learns and adapts to the user's behavior.  If a predicted macro is frequently rejected, its priority is lowered. If a new sequence is consistently performed, it is added to the historical data and considered for future prediction.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated form filling
*   Code completion
*   Game automation
*   Streamlined data entry
*   Accessibility enhancements
*   Context-aware shortcuts
*   AI-assisted task automation
