## Multi-Modal User State Prediction & Proactive Response System

**Specification:** A system designed to predict user intent *before* a wake word is detected, using a combination of audio, visual, and environmental data, enabling truly proactive assistance.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multiple (3+) distributed microphone arrays (similar to existing smart speaker setups).
*   Low-resolution, wide-angle cameras (fish-eye lenses preferred) positioned alongside microphone arrays. These are *not* for facial recognition, but for general scene understanding.
*   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, light levels, motion detectors) integrated with the microphone/camera units.
*   Edge computing devices at each microphone/camera unit for pre-processing data.
*   Central processing server with high-bandwidth network connection.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Data Acquisition Module:** Collects audio, visual, and environmental data from all units.  Real-time streaming to edge devices and central server.

2.  **Feature Extraction Module:** (Runs on edge devices)
    *   *Audio:* Extracts MFCCs, spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate. Focuses on *non-speech* sounds –  typing, footsteps, object movement, etc.
    *   *Visual:*  Object detection (using a lightweight model optimized for edge processing) – identify common objects, count people in the room, track object movement.  Basic scene analysis to determine room type (kitchen, living room, office).  Movement detection.
    *   *Environmental:*  Stores sensor readings.

3.  **User State Prediction Model:** (Runs on central server)
    *   A recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM or GRU cells.
    *   Input: Time-series data from all feature extraction modules.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over a set of predefined user states (e.g., “cooking,” “watching TV,” “working,” “reading,” “sleeping,” "idle").
    *   The model is trained using a large dataset of labeled user activities, correlated with audio, visual, and environmental data.

4.  **Proactive Response Engine:**
    *   Monitors the output of the User State Prediction Model.
    *   If the predicted probability of a specific user state exceeds a threshold, the engine initiates a proactive response.
    *   Responses can include:
        *   Pre-fetching information relevant to the predicted activity (e.g., recipes if “cooking” is predicted).
        *   Adjusting environmental settings (e.g., dimming lights if “watching TV” is predicted).
        *   Presenting relevant information on a display (e.g., calendar appointments if “working” is predicted).
        *   *Silently* preparing to respond to a likely spoken request (e.g., pre-loading a music streaming app if “listening to music” is likely).

5.  **Wake Word Integration Module:**
    *   Standard wake word detection.
    *   If a wake word is detected *after* a proactive response has been initiated, the system seamlessly transitions into voice interaction mode.
    *   If no wake word is detected within a time window, the proactive response is quietly retracted.



**Pseudocode (Proactive Response Engine):**

```
while (true):
    user_state_probabilities = UserStatePredictionModel.predict()
    for state, probability in user_state_probabilities.items():
        if probability > PROACTIVE_THRESHOLD:
            InitiateProactiveResponse(state)
            startTime = currentTime()
            while(currentTime() - startTime < PROACTIVE_TIMEOUT):
                if WakeWordDetected():
                    break
            if not WakeWordDetected():
                RetractProactiveResponse()
```

**Novelty:** This system shifts from *reactive* voice assistance to *proactive* assistance. By anticipating user needs before they are expressed, it offers a more seamless and intuitive experience. The combination of multi-modal data (audio, visual, environmental) and a predictive model allows the system to understand user context with greater accuracy.
