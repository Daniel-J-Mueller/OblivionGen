**Dynamic Subgraph Fusion for Parallel Compilation**

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This design expands upon the concept of subgraph identification and optimization, introducing a dynamic fusion mechanism during compilation to exploit both compute and memory parallelism. It moves beyond simply choosing between compute *or* memory optimizations per subgraph, and instead aims to intelligently *combine* subgraphs based on real-time analysis of target hardware capabilities and compilation progress.

**II. Core Components:**

1.  **Subgraph Analyzer:** Similar to the existing patent, identifies subgraphs within the neural network description. However, the Analyzer includes a profiling stage *during* compilation, not just static analysis. This stage monitors the actual resource usage (compute, memory bandwidth, etc.) of each operator as it is processed.

2.  **Fusion Engine:** This is the key new component. It evaluates pairs of adjacent subgraphs (initially) based on the following criteria:
    *   **Resource Complementarity:** Does fusing the subgraphs create opportunities for shared resource usage?  (e.g., one subgraph is compute-bound, the other is memory-bound â€“ combining them allows for pipelining).
    *   **Data Locality:** Is there significant data transfer between the two subgraphs? Fusing can reduce this transfer.
    *   **Hardware Constraints:**  Can the target processor handle the fused subgraph without exceeding resource limits? (memory size, number of cores, etc.).
    *   **Parallelism Potential:** Does fusing expose more opportunities for parallel execution?

3.  **Dynamic Compilation Graph:** The compilation process no longer operates on a static graph of subgraphs. Instead, it maintains a dynamic graph that changes as the Fusion Engine makes decisions. This graph represents the current state of the compilation, with subgraphs potentially being fused, split, or reordered.

4.  **Resource Scheduler:**  Responsible for allocating resources (CPU cores, memory) to the various subgraphs and operators in the dynamic compilation graph. It must adapt to changes in the graph caused by the Fusion Engine.

**III. Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```pseudocode
// Main Compilation Loop
function compile_network(network_description):
  subgraphs = SubgraphAnalyzer(network_description)
  dynamic_graph = create_dynamic_graph(subgraphs)

  while dynamic_graph is not complete:
    // Find eligible subgraph pairs for fusion
    eligible_pairs = find_eligible_pairs(dynamic_graph)

    if eligible_pairs is not empty:
      best_pair = select_best_pair(eligible_pairs) // Based on criteria above

      if can_fuse(best_pair):
        fuse_subgraphs(best_pair, dynamic_graph)
      else:
        // Apply individual optimizations to subgraphs (as in the original patent)
        optimize_subgraph(dynamic_graph.current_subgraph)
    else:
      optimize_subgraph(dynamic_graph.current_subgraph)

  generate_machine_instructions(dynamic_graph)
```

**IV. Hardware Considerations:**

*   This design benefits from heterogeneous hardware (CPUs, GPUs, specialized accelerators). The Resource Scheduler should be aware of the capabilities of each device and allocate subgraphs accordingly.
*   High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is crucial for supporting the data transfer requirements of fused subgraphs.
*   The Resource Scheduler needs to be tightly integrated with the hardware resource management system of the target platform.

**V. Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced compilation time by exploiting both compute and memory parallelism.
*   Improved resource utilization.
*   Greater flexibility in adapting to different hardware platforms.
*   Potential for generating more optimized machine instructions.
