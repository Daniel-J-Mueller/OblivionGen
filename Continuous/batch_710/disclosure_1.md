## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Gesture Control

**System Overview:**

This system expands on the gesture control concept by integrating localized haptic feedback directly correlated to the detected gestures and selected device. It moves beyond simply *recognizing* a gesture to *feeling* the interaction, enhancing precision and intuitiveness. The goal is to create a system where a user doesn’t just *see* a device selected but *feels* the selection occur.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Haptic Grid/Array:** A flexible, low-profile array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric, shape memory alloy, or microfluidic) integrated into a wearable (glove, wristband, or even a chair armrest). The grid provides localized tactile stimulation.
2.  **Directional Sound Source:** An array of micro-speakers capable of beamforming, emitting sound localized to the ‘direction’ of the selected device. This augments haptic feedback.
3.  **Proximity & Gesture Sensors:** Existing BLE beacon and motion sensor infrastructure, as described in the provided patent.
4.  **Processing Unit:**  Embedded system (e.g., smartphone, smartwatch, or dedicated module) for sensor data fusion, gesture recognition, and haptic/audio control.
5.  **Device Database:** Mapping of devices to specific haptic patterns, audio profiles, and spatial locations.

**Functional Specifications:**

1.  **Gesture Mapping:** Each gesture is associated with a unique haptic pattern. This pattern might be a localized vibration, a series of taps, a subtle pressure change, or a combination. The intensity and frequency of the pattern are adjustable.
2.  **Directional Haptic Feedback:**  When a gesture selects a device, the haptic pattern is delivered to the portion of the haptic grid that corresponds to the device’s spatial location. The BLE beacon data from the patent is used to determine this location.
3.  **Directional Audio Cue:**  Simultaneously with the haptic feedback, a directional audio cue (e.g., a short, localized “ping” or chime) is emitted from the micro-speaker array, reinforcing the sense of selection.
4.  **Proximity-Based Haptic Previews:** As the user’s hand approaches potential devices, subtle haptic previews (e.g., a gentle pulsing) are activated, indicating available options.
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The haptic and audio feedback are dynamically adjusted based on environmental noise and user preferences.
6.  **Multi-User Support:** The system can distinguish between multiple users based on individual profiles and hand signatures.

**Pseudocode for Haptic Feedback Control:**

```
// Initialize System
Initialize Haptic Grid
Initialize Speaker Array
Load Device Database
Load User Profiles

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {
  // Read Sensor Data
  motionData = Read Motion Sensors()
  beaconData = Read BLE Beacons()

  // Gesture Recognition
  gesture = Recognize Gesture(motionData)

  // Device Selection
  if (gesture != null) {
    selectedDevice = Determine Device(beaconData, gesture) // Uses beacon data for location

    // Activate Haptic & Audio Feedback
    if (selectedDevice != null) {
      hapticPattern = Get Haptic Pattern(selectedDevice)
      audioProfile = Get Audio Profile(selectedDevice)

      Activate Haptic Grid(hapticPattern, selectedDevice.location) // Location dictates grid activation
      Play Audio(audioProfile, selectedDevice.location) // Location dictates audio direction
    }
  }

  // Proximity Preview (if no gesture is active)
  availableDevices = Detect Available Devices(beaconData)
  for each device in availableDevices {
    Activate Proximity Haptic(device.location)
  }
}
```
