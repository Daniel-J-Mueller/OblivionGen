## Dynamic Virtual Network Weaving

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network management beyond simple association of external nodes to a system where virtual networks themselves can be dynamically 'woven' together, creating temporary, secure connections between disparate virtual networks, managed by the online network service.  This isn't about adding nodes *to* a network, but temporarily *connecting* networks.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Network Weaver Module (NWM) – A software component residing within the online network service infrastructure.
*   **Function:** Facilitates temporary, secure connections between two or more virtual computer networks managed by the online network service.
*   **Trigger:**  API call from a client or automated system, specifying source virtual network, destination virtual network, connection duration, and security parameters.
*   **Underlying Mechanism:** Leverages existing translation manager modules.  Instead of translating to an external network, the NWM programs the translation managers to act as 'bridges' between the specified virtual networks.
*   **Security:** Utilizes a dynamic, key exchange protocol (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) *between* the translation managers acting as bridges to establish a secure tunnel.  All traffic traversing the woven connection is encrypted.
*   **Topology Awareness:** The NWM must be aware of the topology of each virtual network involved, including existing firewall rules and security groups. It must dynamically adjust these rules to allow traffic to flow through the woven connection, and revert them upon connection termination.
*   **QoS Management:** The NWM should allow clients to specify QoS parameters for the woven connection, such as bandwidth and latency.  This will involve prioritizing traffic traversing the connection.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:**  Detailed logs of all woven connections, including connection duration, traffic volume, and security events, must be maintained.

**Pseudocode (NWM – Initiate Weave):**

```
function initiateWeave(sourceNetworkID, destinationNetworkID, duration, securityParams, qosParams):
  // 1. Verify source and destination networks exist and are managed by the service.
  if (networkExists(sourceNetworkID) == false or networkExists(destinationNetworkID) == false):
    return "Error: Invalid network ID."

  // 2. Allocate Translation Manager resources for the bridge.
  tm1 = allocateTranslationManager()
  tm2 = allocateTranslationManager()

  // 3. Configure TM1 to translate traffic from sourceNetworkID to tm2.
  configureTranslationManager(tm1, sourceNetworkID, tm2)

  // 4. Configure TM2 to translate traffic from tm1 to destinationNetworkID.
  configureTranslationManager(tm2, tm1, destinationNetworkID)

  // 5. Initiate secure key exchange between tm1 and tm2.
  keyExchange(tm1, tm2)

  // 6.  Dynamically adjust firewall rules on source and destination networks to allow traffic through the translation managers.
  adjustFirewallRules(sourceNetworkID, tm1)
  adjustFirewallRules(destinationNetworkID, tm2)

  // 7. Set timer for connection termination.
  setTimer(duration, terminateWeave(tm1, tm2))

  return "Weave connection established."
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simple node integration and creates a dynamic network fabric.  This allows for temporary, secure connections between disparate virtual networks, enabling new use cases such as:

*   **Secure temporary collaboration:**  Quickly connect virtual networks used by different teams or organizations for a limited time.
*   **Automated disaster recovery:**  Dynamically weave a secondary virtual network into operation in the event of a primary network failure.
*   **Micro-segmentation:**  Dynamically connect and disconnect micro-segments of a virtual network as needed.
