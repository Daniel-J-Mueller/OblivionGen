## Dynamic Event Reconstruction & Predictive Summarization

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply summarizing *existing* video, to reconstructing likely events *surrounding* captured footage, and predictively summarize what *might* have happened before/after, filling in gaps in coverage.

**Specifications:**

**1. Multi-Stream Input:**

*   **Input 1:** Existing video data (as per the patent) – multiple sources accepted.
*   **Input 2:** Real-time sensor data - GPS coordinates, time, weather, ambient sound levels, accelerometer data (from device holding camera), connected IoT device streams.
*   **Input 3:** Publicly available data - Social media feeds (filtered for location/time), news reports, event calendars, traffic data.

**2. Event Probability Engine:**

*   **Core Algorithm:** Bayesian Network –  Nodes represent potential events (e.g., "car accident", "birthday party", "protest"), sensor data, and contextual information. Edges represent probabilistic relationships.  Initial probabilities seeded from large event databases.
*   **Sensor Fusion:** Algorithm weights sensor data based on relevance and reliability.  Example: GPS data strongly influences “location-based event” probability.  Accelerometer data influences “impact event” probability.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** Analyzes publicly available data for corroborating evidence or competing hypotheses. Example: News reports of a parade near the video location increase the probability of a "parade event".
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Flags sensor data or contextual information that deviates significantly from expected norms, increasing the probability of unexpected events.

**3. Predictive Video Generation:**

*   **AI-Driven Scene Synthesis:** Using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), the system generates short, plausible video clips representing likely events *before* or *after* the captured footage. GAN trained on a vast database of video scenes and event types.
*   **Scene Coherence:** GAN constrained by the Event Probability Engine.  Generated scenes must be consistent with the most probable event hypothesis.
*   **Dynamic Clip Length:** Clip length determined by the Event Probability Engine – higher probability events warrant longer generated clips.

**4.  Summarization & Presentation:**

*   **Hybrid Summarization:** Combines existing video clips with generated predictive clips.
*   **Timeline View:** Presents a unified timeline of events, distinguishing between captured footage and predicted sequences.
*   **Probability Score Overlay:** Displays the Event Probability Engine’s confidence score for each event on the timeline.
*   **Interactive Exploration:** Allows users to rewind/fast-forward through the timeline, explore alternative event hypotheses, and view supporting sensor data.

**Pseudocode (Event Probability Engine - Simplified):**

```
function calculateEventProbability(videoData, sensorData, publicData):
  eventProbabilities = {} // Dictionary to store probabilities for each event

  //Initialize probabilities from a database (e.g., a probability that a car accident will occur near a certain street corner)
  for event in eventDatabase:
    eventProbabilities[event] = eventDatabase[event]

  //Update probabilities based on video data
  for feature in extractFeaturesFromVideo(videoData):
      for event in eventProbabilities:
          if feature is relevant to event:
              eventProbabilities[event] *= featureWeight(feature)

  //Update probabilities based on sensor data
  for sensor in sensorData:
      for event in eventProbabilities:
          if sensor is relevant to event:
              eventProbabilities[event] *= sensorWeight(sensor)

  //Update probabilities based on public data
  for publicEvent in publicData:
      for event in eventProbabilities:
          if publicEvent is relevant to event:
              eventProbabilities[event] *= publicEventWeight(publicEvent)

  //Normalize Probabilities
  totalProbability = sum(eventProbabilities.values())
  for event in eventProbabilities:
    eventProbabilities[event] /= totalProbability

  return eventProbabilities
