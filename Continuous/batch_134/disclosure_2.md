## Dynamic Skill-Based Queueing & Proactive Agent Support

**Concept:** Expand upon the agent transfer system by introducing a dynamic queueing system based on *both* customer need *and* real-time agent skill assessment, coupled with proactive support tools delivered *to* the receiving agent.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Queueing & Matching Engine:**

1.  **Skill Matrix:** A continuously updated matrix defining agent skills (expertise, languages, product knowledge, soft skills – empathy, de-escalation) weighted by proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, expert).  Skill levels are derived from a combination of self-assessment, supervisor evaluation, and *real-time performance analytics* (see section III).
2.  **Customer Need Profiling:**  The system analyzes incoming contact (IVR input, initial chatbot interaction, call recording analysis) to build a profile of the customer’s need. This profile includes:
    *   **Problem Category:** (e.g., billing, technical support, sales)
    *   **Complexity Level:** (estimated based on keywords, sentiment analysis, and predicted resolution time)
    *   **Customer Sentiment:** (positive, neutral, negative – measured via voice/text analysis)
    *   **Priority Level:** (based on customer value, SLA agreements, issue severity)
3.  **Matching Algorithm:**  The algorithm prioritizes agents based on a weighted score derived from:
    *   **Skill Match:**  How closely the agent’s skill profile matches the customer’s needs.  Higher weight to specialized skills.
    *   **Availability:**  Agent status (available, busy, on break).
    *   **Workload:**  Current number of active contacts and estimated resolution time.
    *   **Performance Metrics:** (see section III). A 'cool-down' period is implemented for agents with consistently low scores.
4.  **Proactive Queue Adjustment:**  The system continuously monitors queue performance and dynamically adjusts the weighting of skills in the matching algorithm to optimize resolution times and customer satisfaction.

**II.  Agent Support System – 'Contextual Briefing'**

1.  **Pre-Transfer Data Package:** *Before* a contact is transferred, a “Contextual Briefing” package is assembled and delivered to the receiving agent’s interface. This package includes:
    *   **Customer History:**  Past interactions, purchases, known issues.
    *   **Problem Summary:** A concise summary of the current issue.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:**  Real-time sentiment score from the initial interaction.
    *   **Suggested Resolution Paths:**  AI-generated recommendations based on the problem summary and customer history. (Linked to Knowledge Base)
    *   **Script Snippets:** Relevant phrases or scripts for handling the issue.
2.  **Dynamic Knowledge Base Integration:** The ‘Contextual Briefing’ pulls data from a dynamically updated Knowledge Base. This KB is populated by:
    *   AI-powered analysis of successful past interactions.
    *   Manual input from subject matter experts.
    *   Real-time feedback from agents on the effectiveness of suggested resolutions.
3.  **Real-time Assistance:** During the interaction, the agent interface provides:
    *   **AI-powered transcription & summarization:** Captures key points and provides a running summary of the conversation.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard:** Tracks customer sentiment in real-time and alerts the agent to potential escalation risks.
    *   **Suggested Next Best Actions:** Provides context-aware recommendations for resolving the issue.

**III. Performance Analytics & Agent Skill Assessment**

1.  **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  The system tracks a comprehensive set of KPIs, including:
    *   Resolution Time
    *   First Call Resolution Rate
    *   Customer Satisfaction Score
    *   Sentiment Change During Interaction
    *   Adherence to Scripting
2.  **Real-time Performance Monitoring:** Agent performance is monitored in real-time and visualized on a dashboard for supervisors.
3.  **Skill Gap Identification:**  The system identifies skill gaps based on performance data and suggests personalized training modules to address them.
4.  **Gamification:**  Points and badges are awarded for achieving performance goals, promoting healthy competition and continuous improvement.

**Pseudocode (Matching Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION MatchAgent(CustomerNeedProfile, AvailableAgents):
  FOR EACH Agent IN AvailableAgents:
    SkillMatchScore = CalculateSkillMatchScore(CustomerNeedProfile, Agent.SkillProfile)
    WorkloadScore = CalculateWorkloadScore(Agent)
    PerformanceScore = CalculatePerformanceScore(Agent)

    TotalScore = (SkillMatchScore * SkillWeight) + (WorkloadScore * WorkloadWeight) + (PerformanceScore * PerformanceWeight)

    Agent.Score = TotalScore

  SORT Agents BY Score DESCENDING

  RETURN First(Agents) // Return the highest-scoring agent
```
