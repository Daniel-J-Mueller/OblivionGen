**Dynamic Data Obfuscation Profiles**

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust data obfuscation (beyond encryption) based on real-time threat intelligence and data sensitivity classifications.

**Components:**

*   **Threat Intelligence Feed:** Integrates with external threat feeds (e.g., known data breach patterns, emerging attack vectors).
*   **Data Sensitivity Classifier:**  Automatically classifies data based on content analysis (using ML) and pre-defined sensitivity levels (e.g., PII, financial data, internal memos).  Supports custom classification rules.
*   **Obfuscation Policy Engine:**  Translates threat intelligence, data sensitivity, and user-defined policies into a dynamic obfuscation profile.  This profile specifies a *combination* of transformations applied to the data *before* encryption (if encryption is used).
*   **Transformation Library:**  A collection of data transformation functions.  Examples:
    *   **Tokenization:** Replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens.
    *   **Redaction:** Removing portions of data.
    *   **Data Masking:** Partially hiding data (e.g., showing only the last four digits of a credit card number).
    *   **Format Shifting:** Altering data formats (e.g., converting dates to different formats).
    *   **Data Perturbation:** Adding controlled noise to numeric data.
    *   **Syntactic Transformation:**  Reordering or rewriting data while preserving meaning.
*   **API Gateway:** Exposes an API for application integration.
*   **Audit Log:** Records all obfuscation actions, including the applied transformations and the justification based on threat intelligence and data classification.

**Workflow:**

1.  A data object is received by the API Gateway.
2.  The Data Sensitivity Classifier analyzes the data object and assigns a sensitivity level.
3.  The Threat Intelligence Feed provides real-time threat information.
4.  The Obfuscation Policy Engine selects an obfuscation profile based on the sensitivity level and threat intelligence. This profile specifies a sequence of transformations from the Transformation Library.
5.  The selected transformations are applied to the data object.
6.  Optionally, the transformed data object is encrypted.
7.  The transformed (and optionally encrypted) data object is stored or transmitted.
8.  All actions are logged to the Audit Log.

**Pseudocode (Obfuscation Policy Engine):**

```
function select_obfuscation_profile(data_sensitivity, threat_intelligence):
  if data_sensitivity == "High":
    if threat_intelligence.contains("ransomware"):
      profile = [tokenize, data_perturbation, encrypt]
    elif threat_intelligence.contains("data_breach"):
      profile = [tokenize, encrypt]
    else:
      profile = [data_perturbation, encrypt]
  elif data_sensitivity == "Medium":
    if threat_intelligence.contains("phishing"):
      profile = [data_masking, encrypt]
    else:
      profile = [data_masking]
  else: # Low Sensitivity
    profile = [format_shifting]

  return profile
```

**Extensibility:**

*   The Transformation Library should be easily extensible with new transformation functions.
*   The Threat Intelligence Feed should support multiple sources.
*   The Data Sensitivity Classifier should be trainable with custom data.
*   Support for different compliance regimes (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) should be configurable.
*   A visual policy editor could be provided for creating and managing obfuscation policies.
