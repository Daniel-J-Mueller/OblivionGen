## Temporal Log Reconstruction & Simulation

**Concept:** Extend the logging system to not just *store* log statements, but to reconstruct and *simulate* past system states based on those logs. This moves beyond simply *searching* logs to actively *replaying* and *analyzing* historical behavior.

**Specs:**

1.  **Log Statement Enhancement:** Modify the log statement structure to include:
    *   `timestamp_ms`: Millisecond-level timestamp. Critical for accurate reconstruction.
    *   `component_id`: Unique identifier for the originating system component (e.g., service name, module ID).
    *   `state_delta`:  A serialized diff or change to the component's state.  This could be JSON, Protocol Buffers, or another compact format.  This *isn't* the full state, just what *changed* since the last log entry.
    *   `dependency_ids`: List of `component_id` values that this component depends on *at the time of the log entry*.
    *   `log_level`: Standard log level (debug, info, warn, error).

2.  **State Reconstruction Engine:**
    *   `reconstruct_state(component_id, start_time, end_time)`:  Function to reconstruct the state of a given component over a time range.
        *   Input: `component_id`, `start_time` (ms), `end_time` (ms)
        *   Process:
            *   Query the log storage for all log entries with `component_id` within `start_time` and `end_time`.
            *   Sort entries by `timestamp_ms`.
            *   Initialize an empty state object for the component.
            *   Iterate through the log entries:
                *   Apply the `state_delta` to the current state object.
            *   Return the reconstructed state object.
    *   `simulate_session(session_id, start_time, end_time)`:  Function to simulate a complete system session (defined by `session_id`) over a given time range.
        *   Input: `session_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`
        *   Process:
            *   Identify all `component_id` values associated with the `session_id` (potentially through a separate metadata store).
            *   For each `component_id`:
                *   Reconstruct the component's state over the time range.
            *   Using the reconstructed states, simulate the session's behavior. This may involve:
                *   Inter-component communication based on the dependency information from the log entries.
                *   Execution of simulated business logic (potentially defined separately).

3.  **Dependency Management:**  A module to track and resolve dependencies between components. This allows for accurate state reconstruction and simulation.  Key functions:
    *   `resolve_dependencies(component_id, time)`: Return a list of `component_id` values that the given component depends on at the given time.  Uses the `dependency_ids` from the log statements.
    *   `validate_dependencies(component_ids)`: Check for circular dependencies.

4.  **Log Storage Adaptation:**  Modify the log storage system to efficiently store and query logs based on `component_id` and `timestamp_ms`. Consider using a time-series database or a columnar database.

5.  **User Interface:** A UI to allow users to:
    *   Select a `session_id`.
    *   Specify a `start_time` and `end_time`.
    *   Initiate a simulation.
    *   View the reconstructed state of components.
    *   Step through the simulation.

**Pseudocode (simulation step):**

```pseudocode
function simulate_step(current_time):
  // Get all log entries for all components at current_time
  log_entries = query_logs(current_time)

  // Apply state deltas to reconstruct component states
  for entry in log_entries:
    component_state = get_component_state(entry.component_id)
    apply_state_delta(component_state, entry.state_delta)

  // Simulate inter-component communication based on dependency information
  for component_id in component_states:
    dependencies = resolve_dependencies(component_id, current_time)
    for dependency_id in dependencies:
      send_message(component_id, dependency_id, get_message(component_id))

  // Return updated component states and simulation events
  return component_states, simulation_events
```

**Novelty:** This system isn't just about *finding* information in logs, but *recreating* the past. It allows for ‘time travel’ debugging and a deeper understanding of system behavior. This has implications for root cause analysis, performance optimization, and security auditing.
