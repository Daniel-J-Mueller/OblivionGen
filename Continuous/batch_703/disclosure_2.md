## Interactive Camera Device - Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback directly into the camera housing, responding to on-screen object tracking and scene analysis. The camera *feels* what it *sees*.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Actuators:** Array of micro-vibrational actuators (piezoelectric or similar) embedded within the camera grip and potentially extending across the rear surface where the user's fingers rest. Density: 20 actuators per 10cm<sup>2</sup>.
*   **Scene Analysis Module:** Software module utilizing computer vision to identify objects, edges, textures, and motion within the cameraâ€™s field of view. This module feeds data to the Haptic Control Module.
*   **Haptic Control Module:**  Microcontroller responsible for translating the scene analysis data into specific haptic patterns. 
    *   **Object Proximity:**  As the camera focuses on an object, actuators closest to the focal point vibrate with increasing intensity.
    *   **Edge Detection:**  Stronger vibrations along edges of detected objects to provide a tactile representation of shape.
    *   **Texture Mapping:** Different vibration frequencies and patterns to simulate the texture of the focused surface (e.g., rough, smooth, bumpy). Algorithm to convert image pixel variance into haptic feedback intensity.
    *   **Motion Tracking:**  Vibrations that 'follow' the motion of tracked objects. Adjustable sensitivity for varying speeds.
*   **User Customization:**  Software interface allowing users to adjust haptic intensity, vibration patterns, and disable specific feedback types. Presets for different shooting scenarios (e.g., wildlife, portraits, landscapes).
*   **Power:** Integrated rechargeable battery providing at least 4 hours of continuous haptic feedback operation.
*   **Materials:** Camera housing must be constructed of materials that effectively transmit vibrations (aluminum alloy, specific polymers). Internal dampening layers to prevent unwanted resonance.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Control Module - simplified):**

```
function process_frame(frame_data):
  objects = scene_analysis.detect_objects(frame_data)
  edges = scene_analysis.detect_edges(frame_data)
  texture = scene_analysis.analyze_texture(frame_data)
  motion = scene_analysis.track_motion(frame_data)

  for actuator in actuator_array:
    actuator.intensity = 0

  for object in objects:
    distance = calculate_distance(object, actuator)
    actuator.intensity = max(0, 100 - distance) #Closer = stronger

  for edge in edges:
    if edge is near actuator:
      actuator.intensity = 50 #Constant intensity for edges

  actuator.frequency = texture.variance * 10 #Texture simulation

  actuator.pattern = motion.direction #Motion Tracking
