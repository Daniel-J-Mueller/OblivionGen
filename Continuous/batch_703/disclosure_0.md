## Adaptive Multi-Path Streaming with Predictive Congestion Avoidance

**Specification:** System for dynamically selecting and blending multiple network paths for streaming data, incorporating predictive congestion avoidance based on machine learning.

**Core Concept:** Rather than switching between streaming and non-streaming protocols or underlying transports as the patent describes, this system *concurrently* utilizes multiple network paths and intelligently blends the data streams from each to optimize for bandwidth, latency, and reliability. This goes beyond simple multi-path TCP and incorporates proactive congestion prediction.

**Components:**

*   **Path Discovery Module:** Continuously probes for available network paths (Wi-Fi, Cellular, Ethernet, Satellite). Assesses bandwidth, latency, packet loss, and jitter for each.
*   **ML-Powered Congestion Predictor:** Trained on network telemetry data, predicts potential congestion events on each path *before* they occur. Considers time of day, geographic location, and application-specific traffic patterns.
*   **Stream Segmentation & Encoding Module:** Breaks down the streaming data into small, independently decodable segments. Encodes each segment multiple times with varying bitrates and codecs.
*   **Adaptive Path Allocation Engine:**  Based on path characteristics and congestion predictions, dynamically allocates segments to different paths. Segments are assigned to paths where they are most likely to be delivered reliably and with low latency.
*   **Data Blending & Reassembly Module:** Receives segments from different paths. Reassembles the data stream, prioritizing segments delivered via lower-latency paths and utilizing forward error correction to mitigate packet loss.
*   **Feedback & Learning Loop:**  Monitors delivery performance on each path.  Feeds this data back to the ML-Powered Congestion Predictor to improve its accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Path Allocation Engine):**

```
function allocatePath(segment, pathList, congestionPredictions):
  // pathList is a sorted list of available paths (by bandwidth)
  // congestionPredictions is a map of path -> predicted congestion level (0-100)

  bestPath = null
  bestScore = -1

  for each path in pathList:
    // Calculate a score based on bandwidth, latency, and predicted congestion
    score = path.bandwidth * (1 - (congestionPredictions[path] / 100)) - path.latency

    if score > bestScore:
      bestScore = score
      bestPath = path

  // Assign segment to best path
  segment.assignedPath = bestPath

  return segment
```

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **Supported Transport Protocols:** TCP, UDP, QUIC, SCTP (simultaneous use is key)
*   **Encoding Formats:** H.264, H.265/HEVC, AV1 (dynamic codec selection based on path characteristics)
*   **Error Correction:** FEC (Forward Error Correction) codes (Reed-Solomon, LDPC)
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting congestion.  Trained on historical network data and real-time telemetry.
*   **Data Channel Management:** Utilizes a separate control channel (e.g., WebSockets) for real-time telemetry and control signals.
*   **Scalability:** Designed to support a large number of concurrent users and streaming sessions.

**Novelty:**  Existing solutions focus on *switching* between transports or single-path optimization. This system leverages multiple paths *concurrently* and proactively avoids congestion using ML, resulting in a more robust and reliable streaming experience. It is not a "failover" system; it's a parallel system.
