## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** Expand the multi-path energy level calculation to create a dynamic, layered acoustic scene composition for enhanced audio experiences. Instead of simply determining energy levels for speech or ambient sound, the system will identify *multiple* distinct acoustic events (e.g., car passing, dog barking, music playing, human speech) and compose them into a layered soundscape. This goes beyond simple source separation; it’s about *orchestrating* the acoustic environment.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Acoustic Event Library:** Develop a comprehensive library of labeled acoustic events, categorized by type (e.g., transportation, animal, environmental, human) and acoustic characteristics (e.g., frequency spectrum, temporal patterns).  This will require a massive dataset and ongoing updates.
2.  **Multi-Path Event Detection:** Implement a multi-path signal processing pipeline, similar to the referenced patent, but expanded to identify multiple concurrent acoustic events. Each ‘path’ analyzes a portion of the audio data for specific event signatures. 
    *   **Path Assignment:** AI-driven path assignment algorithm dynamically allocates processing paths based on initial audio characteristics.  High-frequency transient sounds trigger paths optimized for sharp transients, while sustained low-frequency sounds trigger paths focused on tonal analysis.
    *   **Path Specialization:** Each path is specialized to detect a subset of acoustic events from the Acoustic Event Library.
3.  **Acoustic Scene Graph:** Construct a dynamic Acoustic Scene Graph (ASG) representing the identified events and their relationships.  
    *   **Nodes:** Represent individual acoustic events (e.g., "car passing", "speech", "birdsong"). Each node contains event type, confidence score, estimated location (if possible with multiple microphones), and temporal boundaries.
    *   **Edges:** Represent relationships between events (e.g., "car passing" *occurs during* "speech", "birdsong" *mixes with* "ambient noise").
4.  **Scene Composition Engine:**  Develop an engine that leverages the ASG to *compose* a layered acoustic experience.
    *   **Priority Levels:** Assign priority levels to different event types (e.g., speech is usually highest priority).
    *   **Dynamic Mixing:** Algorithmically mix the audio streams of detected events based on priority, proximity, and user preferences.
    *   **Spatialization:**  Employ spatial audio techniques (e.g., head-related transfer functions - HRTFs) to create a realistic 3D soundscape.
5.  **User Customization:** Allow users to customize the scene composition experience.
    *   **Event Suppression:** Allow users to suppress specific event types (e.g., block out traffic noise).
    *   **Event Amplification:**  Allow users to amplify specific event types (e.g., enhance birdsong).
    *   **Scene Presets:** Provide pre-defined scene presets for different environments (e.g., "focus", "relax", "outdoor").

**Pseudocode (Scene Composition Engine):**

```
function composeScene(acousticSceneGraph, userPreferences):
  sceneMix = new AudioMix()
  events = acousticSceneGraph.getEvents()

  for event in events:
    priority = event.getPriority() + userPreferences.getEventPriority(event)
    volume = calculateVolume(priority, event.getDistance(), userPreferences.getVolumeLevel())

    # Apply spatialization based on event location
    spatializedAudio = applySpatialization(event.getAudio(), event.getLocation())
    sceneMix.addTrack(spatializedAudio, volume)
  end for

  return sceneMix
end function
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Hearing Aids:**  Automatically adapt to complex acoustic environments, improving speech intelligibility and reducing noise.
*   **Immersive Gaming:** Create dynamic and realistic soundscapes that respond to in-game events.
*   **Smart Home Audio:**  Automatically adjust audio levels and equalization based on the acoustic environment and user preferences.
*   **Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality:** Create truly immersive audio experiences.
