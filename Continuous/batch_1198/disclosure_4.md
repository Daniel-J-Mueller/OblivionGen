## Personalized Sensory Augmentation Profiles

**Concept:** Extend personalized data beyond spoken language understanding to encompass a wider range of sensory inputs and augmentations, creating dynamic, user-specific sensory profiles.  The goal is to tailor not just *what* a system understands, but *how* a user experiences information through all senses.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensory Data Sources:**
    *   Expand data ingestion to include biometric data (heart rate, skin conductance, EEG), environmental data (ambient light, sound levels, air quality), and active user settings (preferred color palettes, font sizes, audio equalization).
    *   Support API integration with wearable sensors, smart home devices, and application settings.

2.  **Sensory Profile Creation:**
    *   Develop a “Sensory Profile” data structure. This profile is a composite of weighted sensory preferences.  Example:
        ```
        SensoryProfile {
            userId: "12345",
            biometricsWeight: 0.2,
            environmentWeight: 0.1,
            applicationSettingsWeight: 0.7,
            preferences: {
                visual: {
                    colorPalette: ["#222222", "#EEEEEE", "#FFA000"],
                    contrastLevel: "high",
                    brightnessLevel: 75
                },
                audio: {
                    equalization: [0, 0, 10, 5, 0, -5],
                    volumeLevel: 60,
                    spatialization: "binaural"
                },
                haptic: {
                    intensityLevel: 50,
                    pattern: "pulse"
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    *   Implement algorithms for automatic profile generation based on observed user behavior and explicitly stated preferences.
    *   Allow manual profile editing and customization.

3.  **Dynamic Sensory Adjustment:**
    *   Create a “Sensory Adjustment Engine” that monitors user state (e.g., stress levels detected through heart rate variability, ambient noise levels, current application) and dynamically adjusts sensory output.
    *   Prioritize adjustments based on profile weighting.  For example, if “applicationSettingsWeight” is high, prioritize maintaining application-defined preferences even if environmental factors suggest otherwise.
    *   Support “Sensory Events” – triggers that initiate specific sensory adjustments. Example:
        ```
        SensoryEvent {
            trigger: "highStressDetected",
            adjustments: {
                audio: {
                    volumeLevel: 40,
                    spatialization: "mono"
                },
                visual: {
                    colorPalette: ["#000000", "#FFFFFF"],
                    brightnessLevel: 50
                }
            }
        }
        ```

4.  **Contextual Awareness:**
    *   Integrate location data and calendar information to anticipate user needs and pre-load appropriate sensory profiles. For instance, a "meeting" context might activate a profile with muted audio notifications and a calm visual palette.
    *   Support user-defined "scenes" – combinations of sensory settings that can be activated manually or automatically.

5.  **API for Application Integration:**
    *   Provide an API that allows applications to query and modify the current sensory profile.
    *   Enable applications to register for notifications when the sensory profile changes.

**Pseudocode (Sensory Adjustment Engine):**

```
function adjustSensoryOutput(userId, sensorData, currentProfile) {
  // Calculate priority weights based on sensorData and currentProfile
  priorityWeights = calculatePriorityWeights(sensorData, currentProfile);

  // Apply adjustments based on priority weights
  adjustedOutput = applyAdjustments(priorityWeights, currentProfile);

  // Output adjusted sensory signal
  outputSensorySignal(adjustedOutput);
}

function calculatePriorityWeights(sensorData, currentProfile) {
  // Combine data from sensorData and currentProfile
  // with defined weights for each factor

  // Example:
  biometricsWeight = sensorData.stressLevel * 0.3 + currentProfile.biometricsWeight * 0.7
  environmentWeight = sensorData.ambientNoise * 0.2 + currentProfile.environmentWeight * 0.8
  // ...

  return {
    biometricsWeight: biometricsWeight,
    environmentWeight: environmentWeight,
    // ...
  }
}

function applyAdjustments(priorityWeights, currentProfile) {
  // Use priority weights to determine which adjustments to apply
  // to the currentProfile

  // Example:
  if (priorityWeights.stressLevel > 0.7) {
    currentProfile.audio.volumeLevel = 40
    currentProfile.visual.colorPalette = ["#000000", "#FFFFFF"]
  }
  // ...

  return currentProfile
}
