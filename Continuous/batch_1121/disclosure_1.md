## Haptic Network Confirmation System

**Concept:** Expand the audible provisioning concept to include haptic feedback, creating a multi-modal confirmation system for network connections, especially in environments where audio feedback is insufficient or undesirable.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Component:** Integrate a small, low-power haptic engine (linear resonant actuator - LRA or eccentric rotating mass - ERM) into the device.
*   **Network Scan Mode:** When initiating network provisioning (via button press, as in the source patent), the device scans for available networks. 
*   **Haptic Network List:** As each network is discovered, the device emits a unique haptic pattern (e.g., a short pulse, a double pulse, a specific frequency/intensity vibration). The duration of the scan and the number of patterns are limited to prevent user overwhelm.
*   **Audio/Haptic Synchronization:**  Simultaneously with the haptic output, the device delivers the corresponding network identifier via audio (as in the source patent).  Audio and haptic should be closely synchronized (under 50ms latency).
*   **Selection Protocol:** After the network scan, the device prompts the user for selection.  User input is accepted via voice (as in the source patent) *or* a single button press corresponding to the network's order in the scan (e.g., first network = one press, second network = two presses).
*   **Connection Confirmation:** Upon successful connection to the network, the device delivers a distinct, prolonged haptic pattern (e.g., a wave-like vibration) *and* audio confirmation.
*   **Security Protocol Indication:** Different security protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2, etc.) are indicated by *varying the intensity* of the connection confirmation haptic pattern. A stronger vibration represents a more secure protocol.
*   **Remote Control Mode:** As in the source patent, once connected, speech processing is limited. However, a *short* haptic pulse is used to indicate the device is actively listening for voice commands sent to a remote device. This avoids the need for a constant audio indicator.
*   **Password Entry Confirmation:** After each alphanumeric character entered via voice, the device provides a brief, distinct haptic 'tick' confirming reception and processing.
*   **Error Indication:** If the password entered doesn't match, a unique, rapidly repeating haptic pattern indicates an error.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Network List Generation):**

```
function generateHapticPatterns(networkList) {
  patterns = []
  for (i = 0; i < networkList.length; i++) {
    pattern = generateUniqueHapticPattern() // Function to create a unique vibration
    patterns.push(pattern)
  }
  return patterns
}

function generateUniqueHapticPattern() {
  // Randomize parameters like frequency, duration, intensity.
  frequency = random(50, 200)
  duration = random(50, 200) // milliseconds
  intensity = random(50, 100) // percentage
  return { frequency: frequency, duration: duration, intensity: intensity }
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Low-power haptic engine to minimize battery drain.
*   Microcontroller with PWM output for precise control of haptic motor.
*   Software library for generating and controlling haptic patterns.
