## Dynamic Attribute Importance via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Extend the attribute scoring system to dynamically adjust attribute weights based on user interaction and feedback. Instead of static weights defined in rules, employ a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn optimal weights for each attribute within different item categories.

**Specifications:**

1.  **RL Agent Integration:**
    *   Integrate an RL agent (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, or Policy Gradient) into the matching engine.
    *   The agent's state space represents the current attributes of the item description and item definition, plus contextual information (e.g., item category, user profile).
    *   The agent's action space represents adjusting the weight of each attribute used in the similarity score calculation.
    *   The reward function is based on user feedback:
        *   Positive Reward: User confirms a successful match.
        *   Negative Reward: User rejects a suggested match.
        *   Neutral Reward: No user interaction.
2.  **Attribute Weight Adjustment:**
    *   The RL agent observes the item attributes and their current weights.
    *   Based on its current policy, the agent selects an attribute and adjusts its weight (increase or decrease).
    *   The matching engine recalculates the similarity score with the adjusted weights.
    *   The agent receives a reward based on user feedback on the new match suggestion.
    *   The agent updates its policy based on the reward received (e.g., using Q-learning update rule).
3.  **Category-Specific Models:**
    *   Maintain separate RL agents for different item categories (e.g., electronics, clothing, books).
    *   This allows the system to learn category-specific attribute importance.  An agent trained on electronics will be distinctly separate from one trained on clothing.
4.  **Exploration vs. Exploitation:**
    *   Implement an exploration strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann exploration) to balance exploring new weight combinations with exploiting the current best weights.
    *   Adjust exploration rate over time, decreasing it as the agent learns.
5.  **User Profiling:**
    *   Incorporate user profile data (e.g., purchase history, browsing behavior) into the agent's state space.
    *   This allows the system to personalize attribute weights based on individual user preferences.
6.  **Pseudocode (Agent Update):**

    ```
    function update_agent(item_description, item_definition, user_feedback, category, user_profile):
        state = get_state(item_description, item_definition, category, user_profile)
        action = select_action(state) //  Choose attribute to adjust weight on
        new_weights = adjust_weights(weights, action)
        similarity_score = calculate_similarity(item_description, item_definition, new_weights)
        reward = get_reward(similarity_score, user_feedback)
        Q(state, action) = Q(state, action) + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * max(Q(next_state, all_actions)) - Q(state, action))
        return new_weights
    ```

7.  **Data Requirements:**
    *   Historical data on item descriptions, item definitions, user feedback (match confirmations/rejections).
    *   Item category data.
    *   User profile data.

8.  **Scalability Considerations:**
    *   Distributed training of RL agents to handle large item catalogs and user bases.
    *   Model compression techniques to reduce memory footprint and improve inference speed.
