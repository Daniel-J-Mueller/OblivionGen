## Dynamic Storyboard 'Living' Environments

**Concept:** Expand beyond static storyboards to create dynamic, interactive environments representing scenes. These aren't pre-rendered animations, but real-time, simplified 3D spaces populated with AI-driven characters enacting the screenplay. 

**Specs:**

**I. Core Engine:**

*   **Rendering:** Utilize a highly optimized, stylized rendering engine (think *Fortnite* or *Minecraft* aesthetic – low poly, bright colors). Focus on readability and quick iteration, *not* photorealism.
*   **Scene Graph:**  Each storyboard panel translates into a simplified 3D ‘set’ constructed from modular assets (walls, furniture, props).  Scene descriptions from the screenplay drive asset selection and arrangement.
*   **Character Representation:** Characters are represented as simplified, rigged 3D models (avatars).  Initial appearance determined by character descriptions.
*   **Timeline Integration:**  The screenplay's timeline becomes the central control for the environment.  Events (dialogue, actions) trigger character animations and scene changes.

**II. AI Behavior Engine:**

*   **Dialogue-Driven Animation:**  Dialogue from the screenplay triggers corresponding facial animations and lip-sync for characters. 
*   **Action Interpretation:**  Action lines are parsed by an AI engine to determine character movements, gestures, and interactions with the environment.  (e.g., “John walks to the window” -> character pathfinding to window, animation of walking).
*   **Emotional State Mapping:** Analyze dialogue (and potentially audio cues) to determine character emotional state. This impacts facial expressions, body language, and even color palettes in the scene (e.g., anger = red tint).
*   **Procedural Reactions:** Implement a system where characters react to each other and the environment procedurally, even if not explicitly stated in the screenplay. This adds a layer of realism and dynamism.

**III. User Interaction:**

*   **"Director Mode":** Users can step *into* the storyboard environment (VR/AR preferred, but 2D control also available) to adjust camera angles, character positions, and animation parameters in real-time.
*   **"What-If" Scenarios:**  Users can modify dialogue or action lines and see the immediate impact on the scene's unfolding.
*   **Collaborative Storyboarding:** Multiple users can simultaneously interact with the same environment, offering suggestions and making changes.

**IV. Pseudocode – Action Interpretation**

```
function interpretAction(actionString):
  keywords = extractKeywords(actionString)
  if "walk" in keywords:
    destination = extractDestination(actionString)
    character.pathfindTo(destination)
    character.playAnimation("walk")
  else if "look at" in keywords:
    target = extractTarget(actionString)
    character.lookAt(target)
  else if "pick up" in keywords:
    object = extractObject(actionString)
    character.pickUp(object)
  else:
    //Handle more complex actions or unknown keywords
    //Potentially use a large language model to infer intent
    pass
```

**V. Potential Expansion**

*   **Soundscape Generation:** Procedurally generate ambient soundscapes based on the scene’s setting and emotional tone.
*   **Music Integration:** Automatically select or compose music tracks to complement the scene's mood.
*   **AI-Driven Cinematography:**  Develop an AI agent that automatically directs the "camera" to create compelling shots.
