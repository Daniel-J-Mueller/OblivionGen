## Dynamic Seed Rotation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Enhance OTP security by dynamically rotating the seed value used for OTP generation *and* tying the rotation schedule to user behavioral biometrics. This makes compromise significantly harder – not only would an attacker need the seed, they’d need to accurately mimic the user’s behavior to predict when the seed will change.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrates with device sensors: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements/touchscreen pressure, scrolling speed, app usage patterns, gyroscope/accelerometer data.
*   **Data Processing:** Employs machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to create a baseline behavioral profile for each user. Features extracted: typing rhythm, mouse acceleration, common app sequences, device holding/movement patterns.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Data is processed locally on the device where possible. Minimal data transmission to central servers; when transmission is necessary, data is encrypted and anonymized.  User consent is required.

**2. Seed Rotation Engine:**

*   **Initial Seed:**  A strong, randomly generated seed is established during initial user setup.
*   **Rotation Trigger:** Seed rotation is *not* time-based.  Instead, the Behavioral Data Collection Module monitors for significant deviations from the established baseline. Deviations could indicate compromised credentials, unusual access attempts, or potential malware.
*   **Deviation Threshold:**  A configurable threshold determines the severity of deviation required to trigger rotation.  Adaptive learning algorithms adjust the threshold based on individual user behavior.
*   **Rotation Algorithm:**  The new seed is generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). The input to the CSPRNG includes:
    *   The previous seed.
    *   A timestamp.
    *   A "behavioral entropy" value derived from the behavioral data during the last rotation cycle.
*   **Seed Distribution:**  The new seed is securely communicated to the authentication server and to the user's device.  Key exchange protocols (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) are used to protect the seed during transmission.

**3. Authentication System Integration:**

*   **OTP Generation:** The user's device uses the current seed to generate OTPs.
*   **Verification:** The authentication server verifies OTPs using the same seed.
*   **Seed Synchronization:**  A secure, real-time synchronization mechanism ensures that the authentication server and the user's device have the most up-to-date seed.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:**  In case of behavioral data collection failure, a time-based fallback mechanism is implemented.  Rotation frequency is increased as a precaution.

**Pseudocode (Seed Rotation Engine):**

```
function rotateSeed(userProfile, behavioralData, previousSeed) {
  // Calculate behavioral entropy
  behavioralEntropy = calculateBehavioralEntropy(behavioralData)

  // Generate new seed
  newSeed = CSPRNG(previousSeed, timestamp(), behavioralEntropy)

  // Securely transmit new seed to authentication server & user device
  transmitSeed(newSeed)

  // Update user profile with new seed
  userProfile.currentSeed = newSeed

  return newSeed
}

function calculateBehavioralEntropy(behavioralData) {
  // Analyze behavioral data for patterns and anomalies
  // Use machine learning models to estimate the entropy of the data
  // Higher entropy indicates more unpredictable behavior
  // Return entropy score
}

```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly enhanced security by tying seed rotation to user behavior.
*   Reduced risk of compromise due to stolen or predicted seeds.
*   Adaptive security that adjusts to individual user behavior.
*   Increased resilience against advanced attacks.
