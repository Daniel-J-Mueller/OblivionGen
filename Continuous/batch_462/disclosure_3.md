## Dynamic Focus Stacking with AI-Driven Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Expand the multi-image capture concept beyond simple setting adjustments to create a dynamically focused image *after* capture, leveraging AI to reconstruct a full scene depth map and allowing the user to define the focal plane post-capture.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-camera array (minimum 3, optimally 5+) with known baseline distances. Cameras should have fast autofocus and reasonably high resolution (12MP+).
    *   Dedicated image processing unit (IPU) or high-performance CPU/GPU for real-time depth map generation and image blending.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to track device movement during multi-image capture.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Capture Mode:** A dedicated "Dynamic Focus" capture mode, triggered through the camera app.
    *   **Multi-Image Sequence:** Upon activation, the device rapidly captures a sequence of images (5-10) while subtly shifting the camera array's position (via micro-actuators or deliberate small hand movements tracked by the IMU). Each image represents a slightly different perspective and focal point.
    *   **AI-Driven Depth Map Generation:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a massive dataset of scenes and corresponding depth maps processes the image sequence. The CNN identifies corresponding features in each image and estimates the distance to objects in the scene, generating a dense depth map. Considerations for handling occlusions and reflective surfaces should be implemented.
    *   **Interactive Focal Plane Selection:** The generated depth map is displayed to the user as an overlay on the captured images. The user can interactively define the focal plane using a slider or by directly "painting" the desired focal area on the image.
    *   **Refocusing and Blending:** Based on the user's focal plane selection, the software selects the sharpest pixels from each image in the sequence for each point in the scene. A seamless blending algorithm combines these pixels to create a final image with a significantly expanded depth of field and user-defined focus.
    *   **Post-Processing Options:** Options for adjusting the strength of the refocusing effect, adding bokeh (blur) to out-of-focus areas, and adjusting color and tone.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Capture Sequence
function captureDynamicFocusSequence():
  images = []
  for i = 0 to numImages:
    image = captureImage()
    images.append(image)
    delay(captureDelay)
  return images

// Depth Map Generation
function generateDepthMap(images):
  depthMap = CNN(images) // Apply trained CNN
  return depthMap

// Interactive Focal Plane Selection
function selectFocalPlane(depthMap):
  // User interface for defining focal plane (slider, painting)
  focalPlane = getUserInput()
  return focalPlane

// Refocusing and Blending
function refocusAndBlend(images, depthMap, focalPlane):
  finalImage = createEmptyImage()
  for each pixel in image:
    depth = depthMap[pixel]
    if depth is within focalPlane range:
      // Select sharpest pixel from all images
      sharpestPixel = findSharpestPixel(pixel, images)
      finalImage[pixel] = sharpestPixel
    else:
      // Apply blur to pixel
      blurredPixel = applyBlur(pixel, depth)
      finalImage[pixel] = blurredPixel
  return finalImage
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Live Preview:** Render a near-real-time preview of the refocused image on the deviceâ€™s screen.
*   **3D Model Generation:** Use the depth map to generate a basic 3D model of the scene.
*   **Lighting Adjustment:** Adapt lighting settings post-capture to optimize the refocused image.
*   **Integration with AR/VR:** Utilize the depth information for Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) applications.
