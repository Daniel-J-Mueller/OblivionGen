## Dynamic Thread ‘Mood’ Visualization

**Specification:** A system for visually representing the collective sentiment or ‘mood’ of a discussion thread in real-time, integrated directly into the forum interface.

**Components:**

*   **Sentiment Analysis Engine:** A continuously running process analyzing each post in a thread for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). This could utilize existing NLP libraries or a custom trained model. Output: A sentiment score (-1 to 1) for each post.
*   **Mood Aggregator:**  This component receives sentiment scores from the Sentiment Analysis Engine.  It calculates a running average or weighted average (recent posts weighted more heavily) to determine the overall ‘mood’ of the thread. Output: A single ‘mood’ value (e.g., -1 to 1).
*   **Visual Indicator:** A dynamic visual element displayed alongside each thread in the forum listing *and* within the thread view itself.  This could be a color gradient (red for negative, green for positive), an animated icon (e.g., a ‘smiley face’ morphing based on mood), or a wave-like animation.
*   **User Filtering:** A user-adjustable slider or toggle allowing users to filter threads based on mood.  For example, a user might choose to only see threads with a positive mood or hide threads with a strongly negative mood.
*   **Mood History:** A small, interactive graph displaying the mood of the thread over time. Users can hover over points on the graph to see the sentiment of posts at specific moments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Sentiment Analysis Engine
function analyzeSentiment(postText):
  // Use NLP library or model to calculate sentiment score (-1 to 1)
  return sentimentScore

// Mood Aggregator
function calculateThreadMood(thread):
  totalSentiment = 0
  for post in thread.posts:
    sentiment = analyzeSentiment(post.text)
    totalSentiment += sentiment
  mood = totalSentiment / thread.posts.count
  return mood

// Visual Indicator Update Function (runs continuously)
function updateThreadMoodVisual(thread):
  mood = calculateThreadMood(thread)
  // Map mood value to color, icon state, or animation parameters
  visualState = mapMoodToVisual(mood)
  // Update thread listing/view with visualState
  display.updateThreadVisual(thread, visualState)

// User Filter Function
function filterThreadsByMood(threads, minMood, maxMood):
  filteredThreads = []
  for thread in threads:
    mood = calculateThreadMood(thread)
    if mood >= minMood and mood <= maxMood:
      filteredThreads.append(thread)
  return filteredThreads
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   The sentiment analysis engine should be optimized for speed to avoid impacting forum performance. Caching sentiment scores for recently analyzed posts could be beneficial.
*   The visual indicator should be unobtrusive and easily customizable.
*   The user filtering functionality should be integrated seamlessly into the forum interface.
*   The mood history graph should be interactive and allow users to zoom and pan.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Help users quickly identify threads that are likely to be positive or negative.
*   Facilitate more constructive and engaging discussions.
*   Provide insights into the overall health and sentiment of the forum community.
*   Allow moderators to quickly identify and address potentially problematic threads.
