**Automated Schema Drift Detection & Remediation**

**Concept:** Extend the multi-stage deployment pipeline to *actively monitor* deployed directory schemas for drift from the intended state, and automatically initiate remediation steps, including rolling back to known-good states or applying targeted fixes. This moves beyond simple deployment to continuous schema integrity.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Schema Fingerprinting:**
    *   Upon successful deployment of a directory schema (Stage 2 of the existing pipeline), create a “schema fingerprint” - a cryptographic hash (SHA-256) of the schema definition (LDIF, JSON, or equivalent). This fingerprint serves as the baseline.
    *   Store the fingerprint alongside the deployment metadata.

2.  **Periodic Drift Monitoring:**
    *   Introduce a "Drift Monitor" service.
    *   This service periodically (configurable interval - e.g., hourly, daily) connects to each directory instance.
    *   It extracts the current schema definition.
    *   It calculates a new hash of the current schema.
    *   It compares the new hash with the stored baseline fingerprint.

3.  **Drift Detection Logic:**
    *   If the hashes *do not* match, drift is detected.
    *   Implement a configurable sensitivity level:
        *   **Low:**  Log the drift event. Alert administrators for review.
        *   **Medium:**  Automatically initiate a rollback to the last known-good schema fingerprint.
        *   **High:**  Quarantine the affected directory instance (prevent writes) and alert administrators immediately.

4.  **Automated Remediation – Rollback:**
    *   The rollback process:
        *   Identify the last known-good schema fingerprint.
        *   Provision a temporary compute instance.
        *   Apply the known-good schema to the temporary instance.
        *   Verify the temporary instance is functioning correctly.
        *   Replace the affected directory instance with the verified temporary instance.

5.  **Automated Remediation – Targeted Fixes (Advanced):**
    *   If drift is caused by a small, well-defined change (e.g., a new attribute), attempt a targeted fix:
        *   Analyze the differences between the current and baseline schemas.
        *   Apply the change to the baseline schema.
        *   Verify the change is valid.
        *   Deploy the updated baseline schema.

6.  **Integration with Existing Pipeline:**
    *   The Drift Monitor should integrate seamlessly with the existing multi-stage deployment pipeline.
    *   Add a "Schema Integrity Check" stage to the pipeline.
    *   This stage validates the schema against the baseline fingerprint after each deployment.

**Pseudocode (Drift Monitor):**

```
FUNCTION MonitorSchemaDrift(directory_instance, baseline_fingerprint):
    current_schema = ExtractSchema(directory_instance)
    current_fingerprint = HashSchema(current_schema)

    IF current_fingerprint != baseline_fingerprint:
        drift_detected = TRUE
        LogDriftEvent(directory_instance, baseline_fingerprint, current_fingerprint)

        # Implement Rollback/Remediation Logic based on configuration
        IF configuration.rollback_enabled:
            RollbackToKnownGood(directory_instance, baseline_fingerprint)

        IF configuration.remediate_enabled:
            AttemptTargetedFix(directory_instance, baseline_fingerprint, current_fingerprint)
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION
