## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Wake Word

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple wake word detection to *reconstruct* the acoustic environment surrounding the device, creating a personalized "sound fingerprint" for enhanced accuracy and contextual awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum 8-microphone circular array, densely packed (spacing < 2cm) at the top of the device. Include at least 2 low-noise, high-sensitivity microphones angled 45 degrees downward.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with at least 20 TOPS for real-time audio processing.
*   **Storage:** 64GB non-volatile storage for acoustic scene profiles and model parameters.
*   **Speaker:** Full-range driver capable of reproducing frequencies from 20Hz to 20kHz.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Acoustic Scene Capture:** Upon device initialization (and periodically thereafter), the microphone array actively *listens* for 60 seconds, capturing ambient audio. This data isn't processed for wake words initially.
2.  **Spatial Audio Mapping:** Using beamforming techniques (similar to the patent, but significantly more refined), the system creates a 3D map of the acoustic environment. This includes identifying sound source locations, distances, and reverberation characteristics.
3.  **Soundprint Generation:** A deep neural network analyzes the spatial audio map and generates a unique "soundprint" representing the device's typical acoustic environment. This soundprint is stored in non-volatile storage.
4.  **Dynamic Noise Cancellation & Adaptive Beamforming:** In standard operation, the system *continuously* compares incoming audio to the stored soundprint. Any deviations (e.g., new noises, changes in room acoustics) are identified. Adaptive beamforming and noise cancellation algorithms are dynamically adjusted to filter out non-essential sounds *before* wake word detection.
5.  **Personalized Wake Word Detection:**  The wake word detection model is trained *specifically* on audio data filtered by the dynamic noise cancellation system and adapted to the current acoustic environment. The model should include a confidence threshold that automatically adjusts based on the deviation between the current acoustic environment and the stored soundprint.
6.  **Contextual Awareness:** The system records *what* sounds are present during wake word activations (e.g., TV, music, other voices). This data is used to improve the accuracy of subsequent wake word detections and to provide contextual responses (e.g., "Do you want me to pause the music?").
7. **Pseudo Code:**

```pseudocode
//Initialization
captureAmbientAudio(60 seconds)
soundprint = generateSoundprint(ambientAudio)
storeSoundprint(soundprint)

//Real-Time Operation
while (deviceActive) {
    audioData = captureAudioData()
    currentAcousticEnvironment = analyzeAudioData(audioData)
    deviation = calculateDeviation(currentAcousticEnvironment, soundprint)
    noiseCancellationProfile = generateNoiseCancellationProfile(deviation)
    filteredAudio = applyNoiseCancellation(audioData, noiseCancellationProfile)
    wakeWordDetected = detectWakeWord(filteredAudio)

    if (wakeWordDetected) {
        contextualData = analyzeAudioContext(audioData)
        processCommand(contextualData)
    }
}
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond simple wake word detection to create a dynamically adaptive acoustic environment tailored to the user and their surroundings. The integration of acoustic scene reconstruction and contextual awareness significantly improves accuracy and provides a more intuitive and responsive user experience. Itâ€™s not simply hearing the wake word, it's *understanding* where and how it's being said.
