## Dynamic Narrative Stitching & Temporal Blending

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond selecting keyframes for still images. Create short, dynamically stitched video "scenes" based on user interaction and predicted interest, blending temporal information for a more immersive experience.  Instead of just picking *a* frame, we construct a mini-video.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Stitched 360° video data (as per the patent), user feedback data (likes/dislikes, modification requests). Crucially, incorporate *dwell time* – how long a user focuses on a particular area of the 360° video.
*   **Scene Segmentation:**  Develop an algorithm to segment the stitched video not by fixed time intervals, but by *content coherence* and user attention. This will require analyzing optical flow, object detection, and the user’s gaze direction (inferred from dwell time & potentially head tracking data from a VR/AR headset).
*   **Temporal Blending Engine:** Instead of simply selecting a keyframe, this engine will construct a short video clip (2-5 seconds) centered around the identified "moment of interest."
    *   **Frame Selection:** Select a series of frames *around* the keyframe, weighting frames closer to the keyframe more heavily.
    *   **Optical Flow Compensation:** Use optical flow to warp/blend frames together, smoothing transitions and creating a more fluid experience.  This combats the jarring effect of abrupt cuts between frames.
    *   **Dynamic Masking:** Apply dynamic masking to focus the blending on regions of high interest, determined by object detection, user gaze, and optical flow density.
*   **Interest Curve Refinement:** Enhance the existing interest value determination by incorporating a decay function. Recent positive feedback should have a higher weighting than older feedback. This allows the system to adapt quickly to changing user preferences.
*   **Procedural Soundscape Generation:** Generate a localized soundscape for each dynamically stitched scene. Use sound source localization based on object detection within the scene and apply spatial audio processing to create an immersive sound experience.
*   **User Interaction Loop:**
    *   Present the short, dynamically stitched scene to the user.
    *   Collect user feedback (like/dislike, request to re-stitch, request to explore a different area of the 360° video).
    *   Refine the interest curve and the stitching algorithm based on the feedback.
*   **Output:** A stream of short, dynamically stitched video scenes, tailored to the user's interests and presented in a seamless and immersive manner.

**Pseudocode (Scene Stitching):**

```
function stitchScene(stitchedVideo, keyframe, userFeedback, dwellTime):

  sceneDuration = 3 seconds  // Adjustable
  startTime = keyframe.timestamp - (sceneDuration / 2)
  endTime = keyframe.timestamp + (sceneDuration / 2)

  frames = getFrames(stitchedVideo, startTime, endTime)

  weightedFrames = []
  for frame in frames:
    weight = calculateWeight(frame.timestamp, keyframe.timestamp) // Higher weight closer to keyframe
    weightedFrames.append((frame, weight))

  blendedFrame = blendFrames(weightedFrames, keyframe)

  // Apply dynamic masking based on object detection & user gaze

  soundscape = generateSoundscape(blendedFrame)

  return blendedFrame, soundscape
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond static image selection to dynamic video scene construction, leveraging temporal information and user interaction for a more immersive and personalized experience.  It introduces a feedback loop that continuously refines the stitching algorithm and adapts to the user’s changing preferences.
