## Secure Boot with Dynamic Root of Trust Partitioning

**Concept:** Expand the dual authentication scheme to incorporate a dynamically partitioned Root of Trust (RoT). Instead of a static division between controller and processor authentication, the system analyzes firmware characteristics *during* boot to determine which authentication stages are performed by which hardware. This adds a layer of resilience against supply chain attacks and allows for more granular security policies.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   SOC: Processor, Secure Storage (e.g., eFuses, TPM), Memory Controller, dedicated Crypto Engine.
    *   External Controller: Secure element with cryptographic capabilities, communication interface to SOC.
*   **Firmware Structure:**
    *   Firmware image partitioned into multiple blocks.
    *   Each block tagged with metadata indicating required authentication level/authority (Controller/Processor/None).
    *   Metadata digitally signed by a master key during image creation.
*   **Boot Process:**
    1.  **Initial Verification:** Controller verifies the master key signature on the firmware metadata. This confirms image integrity and unlocks access to block-level authentication requirements.
    2.  **Dynamic Partitioning:**  Based on the parsed metadata, the controller dynamically determines which firmware blocks it will authenticate and which it will delegate to the processor.
    3.  **Controller Authentication:** The controller authenticates its assigned blocks using an updatable key. Authentication is performed *before* any code from those blocks is executed. Results are communicated to the SOC.
    4.  **Processor Authentication:** The processor, using a hardwired boot key, authenticates its assigned blocks. Authentication is initiated only after the controller confirms successful authentication of its blocks.
    5.  **Execution:**  Only blocks passing *both* authentication stages (where applicable) are marked as executable.  The SOCâ€™s memory controller enforces these permissions.
*   **Key Management:**
    *   Processor Boot Key: Hardwired in eFuses.
    *   Controller Authentication Key: Updatable, stored securely within the controller.
    *   Master Key: Used for signing firmware metadata; managed via a secure key lifecycle process.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Controller Side:

function verify_metadata(firmware_image):
    metadata = extract_metadata(firmware_image)
    if verify_signature(metadata, master_key):
        return True
    else:
        return False

function authenticate_blocks(firmware_image, authenticated_blocks):
    block_index = 0
    while block_index < length(firmware_image):
        block_metadata = extract_block_metadata(firmware_image[block_index])
        if block_metadata.authority == "Controller":
            if verify_block_signature(firmware_image[block_index], controller_key):
                authenticated_blocks.add(block_index)
            else:
                // Authentication Failed - Halt Boot
                return False
        block_index += 1
    return True

// SOC Side:

function authenticate_blocks(firmware_image, authenticated_blocks):
    block_index = 0
    while block_index < length(firmware_image):
        block_metadata = extract_block_metadata(firmware_image[block_index])
        if block_metadata.authority == "Processor":
            if verify_block_signature(firmware_image[block_index], boot_key):
                authenticated_blocks.add(block_index)
            else:
                // Authentication Failed - Halt Boot
                return False
        block_index += 1
    return True

function enforce_execution_permissions(firmware_image, authenticated_blocks):
    for block_index in range(length(firmware_image)):
        if block_index not in authenticated_blocks:
            mark_block_as_non_executable(firmware_image[block_index])
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Security:**  Dynamic partitioning makes it harder for attackers to target a single authentication authority.
*   **Flexible Security Policies:** Enables granular control over which firmware components are trusted by which hardware.
*   **Resilience to Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromised firmware components can be isolated and prevented from executing.
*   **Adaptability:**  The system can be configured to adapt to changing security threats and requirements.
