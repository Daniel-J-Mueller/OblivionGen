**Adaptive Proactive Shopping Assistant - "WishChain"**

**Core Concept:** Extend the email-based shopping initiation into a continuously learning, proactive system that anticipates user needs and builds ‘WishChains’ – dynamic, evolving shopping lists sourced from multiple data streams, not just email.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion Modules:**
    *   *Email Parser:* (Existing functionality – refined for deeper semantic understanding of requests).
    *   *Social Media Listener:* Monitors public social media posts (with user permission) for expressed desires, needs, or problems. (e.g., “Need a new coffee maker”, “My dog ripped my favorite blanket”).
    *   *Web Browsing History Analyzer:* (With user permission) Analyzes browsing history for patterns, saved items, and search queries.
    *   *Calendar Integration:* (With user permission) Integrates with user calendars to anticipate needs based on upcoming events (e.g., birthday party = potential gift needs, vacation = travel supplies).
    *   *Smart Home Device Integration:* (With user permission) Learns from smart home device usage (e.g., coffee maker usage increases = anticipate coffee bean replenishment).
*   **"WishChain" Construction & Management:**
    *   Each user has a unique, dynamically updated “WishChain” - a prioritized list of potential items.
    *   Items are added to the WishChain based on signals from all data ingestion modules.
    *   Items are assigned a "Relevance Score" (0-100) based on frequency of signals, semantic analysis, and user preferences.
    *   WishChain is presented to the user via a dedicated app/web interface.
    *   Users can manually edit the WishChain (add, remove, prioritize items).
*   **Proactive Shopping Suggestions:**
    *   System proactively sends personalized shopping suggestions to the user via email or app notification.
    *   Suggestions include:
        *   Items nearing depletion (based on usage data).
        *   Items relevant to upcoming calendar events.
        *   Items matching expressed desires on social media.
        *   Items identified as potential gifts for contacts (based on social media & calendar data).
    *   Each suggestion includes a direct link to purchase the item.
*   **"Intent Confirmation" Loop:**
    *   Before automatically adding items to the WishChain, the system uses a "Intent Confirmation" loop.
    *   Example: User posts "Need a new pair of running shoes". System sends: "We noticed you mentioned running shoes. Are you looking to purchase a new pair now? [Yes] [No] [Remind me later]".
    *   This prevents unwanted items from cluttering the WishChain.
*   **Dynamic Pricing & Availability Alerts:**
    *   System monitors prices and availability of items on the WishChain.
    *   Sends alerts when prices drop or items are back in stock.
*   **"Gift Recommendation Engine"**:
    *   Analyzes user's social network and calendar to identify potential gift recipients and their interests.
    *   Suggests gifts based on recipient's profile and user's budget.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - WishChain Update):**

```
Function UpdateWishChain(userData, incomingSignal) {

  // Extract relevant data from incomingSignal (e.g., item name, category, sentiment)
  extractedData = ProcessSignal(incomingSignal);

  // Check if item already exists in WishChain
  existingItem = FindItem(userData.WishChain, extractedData.itemName);

  If (existingItem == null) {
      // New item - Calculate initial Relevance Score
      relevanceScore = CalculateRelevanceScore(extractedData, userData);
      // Add item to WishChain with initial relevance score
      AdditemToWishChain(userData.WishChain, extractedData, relevanceScore);
  } else {
      // Item exists - Update relevance score
      updatedRelevanceScore = UpdateRelevanceScore(existingItem.relevanceScore, extractedData);
      existingItem.relevanceScore = updatedRelevanceScore;
  }
  Sort WishChain by relevance score (highest to lowest)
}

Function CalculateRelevanceScore(extractedData, userData) {
    score = 0
    //Base score for item matches
    score += 20
    //Add based on frequency of data ingestion.
    score += (UserData.SocialMediaMentions * 10)
    score += (UserData.BrowserHistory * 5)
    score += (UserData.CalendarEventRelavance * 15)
    return score
}
```

**Novelty:** Extends simple email parsing into a multifaceted, proactive shopping assistant that anticipates user needs across multiple data streams. The “Intent Confirmation” loop addresses privacy concerns and prevents unwanted additions to the WishChain.
