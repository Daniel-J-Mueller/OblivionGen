## Multi-UAV Swarm-Based Predictive Collision Avoidance with Bio-Inspired Signaling

**System Specifications:**

*   **UAV Platform:** Minimum of 3 UAVs operating in a coordinated swarm. Each UAV equipped with:
    *   High-resolution LiDAR (200m range, 0.1° resolution).
    *   RGB-D camera (100m range).
    *   Onboard processing unit (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier or equivalent).
    *   Dedicated short-range, high-bandwidth communication module (802.11ad or similar) – 200m range.
    *   Standard flight control system.
*   **Signaling Mechanism:**  Inspired by bioluminescence in fireflies. Each UAV emits a modulated infrared signal (invisible to human eyes) representing its predicted trajectory and uncertainty.
    *   Signal Modulation:  Frequency of the infrared pulse represents predicted velocity. Pulse width represents predicted rate of turn. Amplitude represents uncertainty in prediction (based on sensor data and maneuverability limits).
    *   Communication Protocol:  UAVs broadcast their signal 5 times per second.  Signals are received and decoded by neighboring UAVs.
*   **Trajectory Prediction Algorithm:**
    *   Utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture.
    *   Input:  Historical position, velocity, acceleration data, sensor readings (LiDAR, RGB-D), and internal state (battery level, payload weight).
    *   Output:  Predicted trajectory for the next 5 seconds, represented as a series of waypoints, and associated uncertainty bounds.
*   **Collision Risk Assessment:**
    *   Each UAV receives trajectory predictions from neighboring UAVs.
    *   Calculates Time-To-Closest-Point-of-Approach (TCPA) and Distance-To-Closest-Point-of-Approach (DCPA) for each potential collision pair.
    *   Incorporates uncertainty bounds in the risk assessment. Higher uncertainty increases the estimated collision probability.
*   **Decentralized Collision Avoidance:**
    *   Each UAV independently determines if a collision risk exceeds a predefined threshold.
    *   If a risk is detected, the UAV generates a local avoidance maneuver.
        *   Maneuver Generation: Utilizes a rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm to identify a safe trajectory avoiding the predicted path of the other UAV.
        *   Maneuver Execution: Smoothly blends the planned avoidance maneuver with the UAV’s original flight plan.
*   **Swarm Coordination:**
    *   A simple consensus algorithm (e.g., averaging the heading changes of nearby UAVs) is used to prevent excessive maneuvering by individual UAVs and maintain swarm cohesion.

**Pseudocode (Collision Avoidance Logic – Single UAV):**

```
loop:
    sensorData = getSensorData()
    predictedTrajectory = predictTrajectory(sensorData)
    neighborTrajectories = receiveNeighborTrajectories()

    for each neighborTrajectory in neighborTrajectories:
        tcpa, dcpa = calculateTCPA_DCPA(predictedTrajectory, neighborTrajectory)
        collisionProbability = assessCollisionProbability(tcpa, dcpa)

        if collisionProbability > threshold:
            avoidanceManeuver = generateAvoidanceManeuver(neighborTrajectory)
            executeAvoidanceManeuver(avoidanceManeuver)
            break  // Prioritize avoiding the first detected threat

    //Swarm Coordination:
    averageHeadingChange = calculateAverageHeadingChange(neighborTrajectories)
    applySwarmCoordination(averageHeadingChange)
end loop
```

**Innovation Description:**

This system goes beyond simple detect-and-avoid by proactively sharing predicted trajectories and uncertainty. The bio-inspired signaling mechanism provides a robust and energy-efficient means of communication. The decentralized approach minimizes reliance on a central controller, making the system more resilient to failures. The swarm coordination element ensures that the UAVs maintain cohesion while avoiding collisions. The probabilistic risk assessment accounts for uncertainty in trajectory predictions, leading to more conservative and safer maneuvers.

This system could be deployed for inspection of large structures, search and rescue missions, or autonomous delivery in cluttered environments. The focus is on *anticipating* collisions rather than reacting to them.
