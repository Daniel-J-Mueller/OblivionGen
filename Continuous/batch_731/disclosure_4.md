## Predictive Rendering for Foveated VR with Dynamic Detail Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the prediction model to not only prioritize *views*, but to proactively render increasingly detailed versions of predicted gaze points *within* those views, dynamically scaling detail based on predicted dwell time and user behavior. This moves beyond simply selecting which views to decode and starts anticipating where *within* those views the user will focus.

**Specs:**

*   **Gaze Prediction Module:** Integrate a short-term gaze prediction model (based on velocity, acceleration, and past fixations) within the client device. This model generates a probability distribution for likely gaze locations within a defined time window (e.g., 100ms-500ms).
*   **Multi-Resolution Texture System:** Implement a texture streaming system capable of delivering textures at multiple resolutions (LoD â€“ Level of Detail) on demand. Base layer uses compressed low-resolution textures. Enhancement layers provide progressively sharper details.
*   **Foveated Rendering Pipeline:** Modify the rendering pipeline to dynamically adjust texture resolution and mesh detail based on gaze prediction.
    *   High detail is rendered for the predicted gaze point.
    *   Detail smoothly degrades radially outward from the gaze point.
    *   The rendering pipeline should *pre-render* frames for areas of high gaze probability, storing these as 'ready' frames.
*   **Dynamic Detail Scaling Algorithm:**
    1.  Receive gaze prediction probability distribution.
    2.  For each pixel within the viewport:
        *   Calculate the probability of the gaze falling on that pixel.
        *   Determine the corresponding detail level (LoD) based on the probability.
        *   Request the appropriate texture and mesh data.
    3.  Blend detail levels to create a smooth visual transition.
*   **Behavioral Adaptation Module:** Track user behavior (e.g., saccade patterns, dwell times) and refine the prediction model accordingly. Faster saccades require faster LoD transitions. Longer dwell times justify more aggressive detail rendering.
*   **Buffering and Pipelining:** Implement a frame buffer capable of storing multiple frames at different detail levels. Use a rendering pipeline that prioritizes pre-rendering high-probability areas.
*   **Network Optimization:** Optimize network communication to prioritize transmission of high-detail textures for predicted gaze points. Use compression techniques to minimize bandwidth usage.

**Pseudocode (within rendering loop):**

```
function RenderFrame() {
  gaze_prediction = PredictGaze();
  viewport = GetViewport();

  for each pixel in viewport {
    probability = gaze_prediction.GetProbability(pixel);
    lod = CalculateLOD(probability);
    texture = GetTexture(lod);
    mesh = GetMesh(lod);
    RenderPixel(pixel, texture, mesh);
  }

  PresentFrame();
}

function CalculateLOD(probability) {
  if (probability > 0.8) {
    return LOD_High;
  } else if (probability > 0.5) {
    return LOD_Medium;
  } else {
    return LOD_Low;
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced bandwidth usage due to selective rendering of high-detail areas.
*   Improved visual fidelity in areas of focus.
*   Enhanced immersion and presence in VR environments.
*   Potential for creating 'super-resolution' VR experiences by focusing detail where it matters most.
