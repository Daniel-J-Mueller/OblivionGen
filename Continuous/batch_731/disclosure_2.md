## Dynamic Throttling Based on Predictive Load

**System Specs:**

*   **Components:** Load Balancer, Server Nodes (identical hardware/software configuration), Prediction Engine, Historical Data Store, Real-time Monitoring Agent (per server node).
*   **Data Streams:** Real-time request rate (per server node), CPU utilization (per server node), Memory utilization (per server node), Response times (per server node), Historical request data (timestamped, per server node).

**Innovation Description:**

Instead of *reacting* to throttling limits being exceeded, proactively adjust acceptance rates based on *predicted* load.

1.  **Prediction Engine:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) trained on historical request data. This engine predicts future request rates for each server node over a short horizon (e.g., next 5-15 minutes).  The prediction horizon is configurable.
2.  **Adaptive Thresholds:**  Each server node has a baseline throttling limit.  The Prediction Engine’s output modifies this baseline.  If the predicted load approaches the baseline, the server node *proactively* reduces its acceptance rate (using the Load Balancer) *before* exceeding the limit. Conversely, if predicted load is low, the acceptance rate can be temporarily increased (within safety margins).
3.  **Load Balancing Integration:** The Load Balancer receives modified acceptance rates from each server node. It distributes requests accordingly, prioritizing nodes with available capacity. The Load Balancer tracks "lost" requests due to proactive throttling (these are counted but not dropped – see "Compensation Mechanism").
4.  **Compensation Mechanism:**  "Lost" requests are queued with a priority boost. When a server node recovers capacity (due to completed tasks or predictive load decreasing), it pulls prioritized requests from the queue.  This ensures fairness and responsiveness.
5.  **Real-time Feedback:** The Real-time Monitoring Agent sends actual performance data (CPU, Memory, Response Time) to the Prediction Engine.  This allows the model to self-correct and refine its predictions.
6.  **Health Status Integration:**  Standard health checks are used in conjunction with predictive data to ensure the system remains stable. Nodes in a degraded state receive even more aggressive throttling adjustments.
7.  **Configuration:** System-wide parameters (prediction horizon, maximum acceptance rate increase, aggressiveness of throttling adjustment) are configurable via a central management interface.



**Pseudocode (Load Balancer):**

```
// Per server node
nodeAcceptanceRate = baselineAcceptanceRate;

loop:
    predictedLoad = PredictionEngine.getPredictedLoad(nodeID);
    nodeAcceptanceRate = adjustAcceptanceRate(baselineAcceptanceRate, predictedLoad); // function to calculate adjusted rate

    //Distribute requests to node based on nodeAcceptanceRate
    request = getNextRequest();
    if (random() < nodeAcceptanceRate):
        forwardRequest(request, nodeID);
    else:
        addToPriorityQueue(request);
```

**Novelty:**

Traditional throttling is reactive. This system is proactive, using predictive analysis to *anticipate* load and adjust acceptance rates *before* issues occur. This minimizes latency, improves overall throughput, and provides a more responsive user experience. The priority queue compensation mechanism mitigates the impact of proactive throttling on individual requests.
