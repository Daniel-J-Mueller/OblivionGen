## Adaptive Content Resonance Mapping for Cross-Media Recommendation

**Concept:** Extend the originality scoring beyond text-based similarity to encompass cross-media resonance. Instead of solely comparing books to books, map content "signatures" across *all* media types (text, audio, video, images) and recommend based on unexpected, but resonant, connections. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Signature Generation:**

*   **Multi-Modal Feature Extraction:** Develop algorithms to extract key features from each media type.
    *   **Text:** Utilize existing methods (TF-IDF, LSA, word embeddings) and expand to include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and narrative structure analysis.
    *   **Audio:** Extract features like pitch, tempo, timbre, and vocal characteristics. Incorporate speech-to-text for lyrical/dialogue analysis.
    *   **Video:** Analyze visual elements (color palettes, shot composition, motion tracking) alongside audio features. Utilize object recognition.
    *   **Images:** Extract color histograms, texture analysis, and object/scene recognition. 
*   **Signature Vector Creation:** Combine these features into a high-dimensional vector representing the “signature” of each content item.  Employ dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE) to manage complexity.
*   **Normalization:** Normalize all vectors to a common scale.

**2. Resonance Mapping:**

*   **Resonance Metric:** Define a "resonance" metric that quantifies the similarity *not* in content, but in *effect*.  This goes beyond simply comparing features. 
    *   Consider incorporating psychological models of emotion, mood, and aesthetic preference. (e.g. valence, arousal).
    *   Use machine learning (e.g. neural networks) trained on user response data (ratings, watch time, purchase history) to learn what content evokes similar responses, even if the content *appears* different.
*   **Resonance Graph:** Construct a graph where nodes represent content items and edges represent the strength of the resonance between them.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the resonance threshold based on user preferences and context. 

**3. Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Query Expansion:** When a user selects an item, expand the query to include not just similar items (based on traditional similarity metrics), but also items that resonate with the selected item based on the Resonance Graph.
*   **Serendipity Factor:** Introduce a “serendipity factor” that prioritizes unexpected but resonant recommendations. This could be implemented by weighting the resonance score higher than the similarity score.
*   **Multi-Media Recommendation:**  The system should be able to recommend items across all media types. (e.g., If a user likes a book, the system might recommend a song, a movie, or a painting that resonates with the book's themes and mood).

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Algorithm):**

```
function recommend(user, item, items_list):
  // item is the item the user selected
  // items_list is the list of all available items

  similarity_scores = calculate_similarity(item, items_list)
  resonance_scores = calculate_resonance(item, items_list)

  // Combine scores with weighting. alpha controls the balance between similarity and resonance
  combined_scores = (1 - alpha) * similarity_scores + alpha * resonance_scores

  // Sort items by combined score
  sorted_items = sort(combined_items)

  // Return top N items
  return sorted_items[:N]
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large dataset of content items across all media types.
*   User interaction data (ratings, views, purchases, etc.).
*   Psychological models of emotion, mood, and aesthetic preference.
