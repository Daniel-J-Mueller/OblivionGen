## Personalized Robotic Companion – Affective Resonance System

**System Overview:** A mobile robot designed to exhibit empathetic responses to human emotional states via multi-modal sensory input and nuanced physical expression. This goes beyond simple “emotional mirroring” to proactively offer comforting or stimulating interactions.

**Core Components:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution facial expression analysis camera (detects micro-expressions).
    *   Voice tone/inflection analyzer (identifies emotional cues in speech).
    *   Bio-sensor array (detects heart rate variability, skin conductance – integrated into a wearable accessory for enhanced accuracy - optional).
    *   Environmental sensors (ambient light, temperature, sound – contextual awareness).
*   **Affective Processing Unit (APU):** A neural network trained on a vast dataset of human emotional expressions, physiological data, and contextual information. The APU maps sensor inputs to a probabilistic assessment of the user’s emotional state (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, frustration, boredom).
*   **Expressive Robotic Platform:**  (Building upon the patent's base – the 'moveable component' is significantly enhanced.)
    *   **Bio-Mimetic Head:**  A highly articulated head with a soft, flexible “skin” capable of subtle muscle-like movements.  This is *not* merely tilting or rotating, but micro-movements replicating human facial expressions (raising/lowering eyebrows, subtle lip curves, slight head tilts).  The 'display screen' becomes a dynamic element *within* the face, capable of displaying emotive 'eyes' – not static images, but animated pupils and irises reflecting the perceived emotional state.
    *   **Haptic Feedback System:**  Integrated into the robot's chassis (and potentially a small, detachable “comfort module”). Provides gentle, localized vibrations and temperature changes to offer tactile reassurance or stimulation.
    *   **Dynamic Lighting System:**  Ambient lighting surrounding the head and chassis that adjusts color and intensity to complement the expressed emotion.
    *   **Aroma Diffusion System:** Small, contained cartridge system capable of releasing subtle scents (lavender for calming, citrus for energizing – user-customizable).

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Acquire Sensory Data
  facialExpression = analyzeFace();
  voiceTone = analyzeVoice();
  bioData = getBioData(); // Optional
  environmentData = getEnvironmentData();

  // Process Data with APU
  emotion = APU.inferEmotion(facialExpression, voiceTone, bioData, environmentData);
  confidence = APU.getConfidence(emotion);

  // Determine Response
  if (confidence > 0.75) { // High Confidence
    response = generateResponse(emotion); //See Response Generation Function
  } else {
    response = generateNeutralResponse(); //Default to a calm, inquisitive state
  }

  // Execute Response
  executeResponse(response);
  delay(100ms);
}

// Response Generation Function
function generateResponse(emotion) {
  switch (emotion) {
    case "sadness":
      return {
        headMotion: "tiltDownSlightly",
        eyeExpression: "downcast",
        hapticFeedback: "gentleVibration",
        lighting: "warmBlue",
        aroma: "lavender",
        verbalCue: "I sense you are feeling down. Would you like to talk about it?"
      };
    case "anger":
      return {
        headMotion: "tiltAwaySlightly",
        eyeExpression: "neutral",
        hapticFeedback: "none",
        lighting: "softWhite",
        aroma: "none",
        verbalCue: "I detect frustration. Perhaps we should take a break."
      };
    case "joy":
      return {
        headMotion: "tiltUpSlightly",
        eyeExpression: "bright",
        hapticFeedback: "gentlePulse",
        lighting: "warmYellow",
        aroma: "citrus",
        verbalCue: "That's wonderful! I'm happy to see you smiling."
      };
    // ... other emotions
  }
}

// Execute Response Function
function executeResponse(response) {
  moveHead(response.headMotion);
  setEyeExpression(response.eyeExpression);
  setHapticFeedback(response.hapticFeedback);
  setLighting(response.lighting);
  releaseAroma(response.aroma);
  speak(response.verbalCue);
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple reactive cues (nodding, tilting) to create a holistic, multi-sensory experience that aims to *resonate* with the user’s emotional state. The bio-mimetic head and nuanced expression capabilities are key differentiators. It’s not just about *displaying* emotion, but *embodying* empathetic understanding.
