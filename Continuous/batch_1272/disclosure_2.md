## Adaptive Memory Resonance Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the anomaly detection beyond static memory comparisons to analyze *how* memory is accessed and mutated over time – its ‘resonance’. This creates a dynamic behavioral profile.

**Specifications:**

**1. Resonance Data Collection:**

*   **Instrumentation:** Insert lightweight instrumentation within the target execution environments (VMs). This instrumentation captures the following for each memory access:
    *   Memory Address
    *   Access Type (Read/Write/Execute)
    *   Timestamp (high resolution)
    *   Calling Function/Code Block (minimal stack trace)
    *   Access Size (bytes)
*   **Granularity:** Data is collected in short, overlapping time windows (e.g., 10ms).
*   **Compression:** Employ lossless compression techniques to minimize overhead.
*   **Filtering:** Configure filters to exclude accesses to known benign memory regions (e.g., standard libraries, OS kernel).

**2. Resonance Profile Generation:**

*   **Hashing:** For each memory address within a time window, generate a hash value based on:
    *   Access Type
    *   Timestamp
    *   Access Size
    *   Calling Function (hashed)
*   **Aggregation:** Aggregate hash values within a time window to create a ‘resonance signature’ for that memory region.  Use a Bloom filter or similar probabilistic data structure to efficiently store and compare signatures.
*   **Baseline Profiling:** Establish a baseline resonance profile for each execution environment during normal operation.  Calculate statistical measures (mean, standard deviation) for each memory region’s signature.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The baseline profiles are *continually* updated to account for legitimate changes in application behavior.  Implement a sliding window mechanism and exponential smoothing.

**3. Anomaly Detection:**

*   **Deviation Scoring:** Calculate a deviation score for each memory region based on the difference between its current resonance signature and the baseline profile. Use a distance metric suitable for Bloom filters (e.g., Jaccard index).
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Identify correlated deviations across multiple memory regions. This helps distinguish between localized errors and systemic attacks.
*   **Resonance ‘Echoes’:** Analyze how deviations ‘propagate’ through memory over time. An attacker may attempt to mask their activity by spreading it across multiple regions.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Resonance Agent:**  A lightweight agent running within each execution environment responsible for data collection and pre-processing.
*   **Resonance Collector:**  A central service that receives data from Resonance Agents and stores it in a time-series database.
*   **Resonance Analyzer:**  A service that analyzes the collected data, generates profiles, detects anomalies, and triggers alerts.
*   **API Integration:**  Provide an API for integrating Resonance Analyzer with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(currentSignature, baselineProfile, threshold):
  deviationScore = calculateDeviation(currentSignature, baselineProfile)
  if deviationScore > threshold:
    return True
  else:
    return False

function calculateDeviation(currentSignature, baselineProfile):
  # Example: Jaccard index for Bloom filters
  intersectionSize = size(currentSignature INTERSECT baselineProfile)
  unionSize = size(currentSignature UNION baselineProfile)
  return 1.0 - (intersectionSize / unionSize)
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond static memory comparison to capture the *behavior* of memory access. It leverages the idea that malicious activity will often manifest as unusual patterns of memory access, even if the data itself appears benign. The use of resonance signatures and correlation analysis provides a more robust and accurate means of anomaly detection.
