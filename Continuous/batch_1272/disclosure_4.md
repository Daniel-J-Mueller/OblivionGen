## Dynamic Phoneme Weighting Based on User Physiological State

**Concept:** Integrate real-time user physiological data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial muscle activity) to dynamically adjust phoneme weighting within the speech recognition and error reduction framework. The goal is to improve accuracy in noisy environments or when the user is experiencing stress, fatigue, or other conditions that affect speech production.

**Specs:**

1.  **Physiological Sensor Integration:**
    *   Hardware: Integrate with wearable sensors (smartwatch, fitness tracker, headset with bio-sensors) capable of measuring HRV, skin conductance (GSR), and/or facial EMG.
    *   Data Acquisition: Develop a module to receive and preprocess physiological data streams. Data must be timestamped and synchronized with audio input.
    *   Calibration: Implement a user-specific calibration process to establish baseline physiological values and sensitivity ranges.

2.  **Physiological State Estimation:**
    *   Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from physiological data streams (e.g., RMSSD, mean HRV, GSR peak amplitude, EMG activation levels of articulatory muscles).
    *   State Classification: Develop a model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) to classify the userâ€™s physiological state into categories such as:
        *   Neutral/Baseline
        *   Stress/Anxiety
        *   Fatigue/Drowsiness
        *   Cognitive Load
    *   Confidence Scoring: Assign a confidence score to each state classification.

3.  **Dynamic Phoneme Weighting:**
    *   Phoneme Error Profiles: Build a database of phoneme error profiles *correlated with each physiological state*. This requires collecting speech data from users *while* in different physiological states. (e.g., users mispronounce /s/ more frequently when stressed)
    *   Weight Adjustment: Based on the estimated physiological state and the confidence score, dynamically adjust the weights assigned to each phoneme during speech recognition.
        *   Increase weight for phonemes the user reliably pronounces correctly in that state.
        *   Decrease weight for phonemes the user tends to mispronounce in that state.
    *   Weighting Algorithm:
        ```pseudocode
        function adjust_phoneme_weights(physiological_state, confidence_score, base_weights):
            state_profile = lookup_state_profile(physiological_state)
            adjusted_weights = {}
            for phoneme, base_weight in base_weights.items():
                adjustment_factor = state_profile.get(phoneme, 1.0)  # Default no adjustment
                adjusted_weight = base_weight * adjustment_factor * confidence_score
                adjusted_weights[phoneme] = adjusted_weight
            return adjusted_weights
        ```

4.  **Integration with Existing Framework:**
    *   Modify the existing FST-based error reduction system to accept dynamically adjusted phoneme weights as input.
    *   Ensure the weighting adjustments are applied during the composition of the input FST, edit FST, and grammar FST.

5.  **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   Implement a feedback loop to continuously refine the phoneme error profiles based on user interactions and corrections.
    *   Use reinforcement learning to optimize the weighting adjustments over time.
