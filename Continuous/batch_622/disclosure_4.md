## Personalized Haptic Attention Alerts

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Haptic Feedback System integrated into vehicle seating and steering wheel. Multiple actuators distributed across contact surfaces.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Spare Attention Capacity (from existing system - patent 10893010).
    *   Message Priority (from existing system - patent 10893010).
    *   Message Category (e.g., Navigation, Safety, Entertainment, Personal).
    *   Occupant Physiological Data (Heart Rate Variability, Skin Conductance - via wearable integration or seat sensors).
    *   Vehicle Dynamics Data (Acceleration, Braking, Steering Angle).
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded processor within the vehicle’s central control system.
*   **Output:** Dynamically generated haptic patterns delivered via actuators.

**Innovation Description:**

Instead of solely filtering *what* information reaches the occupant, this system manipulates *how* information is delivered, acknowledging that even critical alerts can be overwhelming. The core principle is to convey urgency and information via distinct haptic ‘signatures’ tailored to both the message and the occupant’s current attentional state.

**Haptic Signature Generation Logic:**

1.  **Base Signature:** Each message category (Navigation, Safety, etc.) has a predefined base haptic signature (e.g., Navigation – gentle pulsing on the seat bolster; Safety – sharp, localized tap on the steering wheel).
2.  **Attentional Modulation:**
    *   **High Spare Capacity:** Base signature is delivered as intended.
    *   **Medium Spare Capacity:** Signature amplitude is reduced; frequency is increased (more rapid, but less intense).
    *   **Low Spare Capacity:** Signature is transformed into a subtle, prolonged vibration – a ‘nag’ rather than a ‘notification’ – designed to be felt peripherally without demanding immediate attention. Critical Safety alerts *always* break through with a pre-defined override.
3.  **Physiological Integration:**
    *   **High Stress (HRV low, Skin Conductance high):** Haptic signatures are smoothed and dampened, prioritizing clarity over urgency.
    *   **Low Stress:** Haptic signatures can be more dynamic and engaging.
4.  **Vehicle Dynamics Integration:** During aggressive maneuvers (hard braking, sharp turns), haptic feedback is minimized or paused to avoid sensory overload.
5. **Directional Haptics:** Use actuator placement to subtly indicate message origin or direction. (e.g. a left turn notification pulses the left side of the seat).

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateHapticFeedback(messagePriority, messageCategory, spareAttentionCapacity, occupantStressLevel, vehicleDynamics)

    // Define base haptic signature for message category
    baseSignature = GetBaseSignature(messageCategory)

    // Modulate signature based on spare attention capacity
    IF spareAttentionCapacity == HIGH THEN
        hapticSignature = baseSignature
    ELSE IF spareAttentionCapacity == MEDIUM THEN
        hapticSignature = ReduceAmplitude(baseSignature)
        hapticSignature = IncreaseFrequency(hapticSignature)
    ELSE // spareAttentionCapacity == LOW
        hapticSignature = ProlongedVibration()
        IF messageCategory == SAFETY THEN
          hapticSignature = OverrideWithSafetySignature()
    ENDIF

    //Adjust for occupant stress level
    IF occupantStressLevel == HIGH THEN
        hapticSignature = SmoothSignature(hapticSignature)
        hapticSignature = DampenSignature(hapticSignature)
    ENDIF

    // Adjust for vehicle dynamics
    IF vehicleDynamics == AGGRESSIVE THEN
        hapticSignature = PauseSignature()
    ENDIF

    DeliverHapticFeedback(hapticSignature)

END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Learned Preferences:**  System learns occupant’s preferred haptic feedback patterns over time.
*   **Multi-Occupant Support:** Individualized haptic profiles for each seat.
*   **Integration with AR/VR Heads-Up Displays:**  Haptic feedback synchronized with visual cues.
