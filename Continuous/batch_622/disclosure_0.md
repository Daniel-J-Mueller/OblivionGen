## Dynamic Contextual Bandits for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend the multi-armed bandit framework to *proactively* offer assistance to users *before* they initiate a cancellation process, based on real-time behavioral signals. Instead of reacting to a cancellation request, the system anticipates potential dissatisfaction and intervenes with targeted content.

**Specs:**

*   **Input Data:**
    *   User activity logs (page views, feature usage, time spent on pages)
    *   Real-time behavioral signals (mouse movements, scrolling speed, hesitation patterns, error rates). These signals are fed into a feature extractor.
    *   User profile data (subscription tier, demographics, past interactions).
*   **Feature Extraction Module:**
    *   Extracts features from user activity logs, behavioral signals, and profile data. Example features:
        *   Time spent on pricing page
        *   Number of help articles viewed related to a specific feature.
        *   Frequency of error messages encountered
        *   Hesitation time before clicking “Cancel Subscription”
        *   Scroll depth on support pages
*   **Contextual Bandit Models:**
    *   A series of contextual bandit models, one per anticipated issue (e.g., pricing concerns, feature usability, customer support responsiveness).
    *   Each model utilizes the extracted features as context.
    *   Arms represent proactive assistance options:
        *   Personalized discount offer
        *   Link to relevant tutorial or help article
        *   Proactive chat initiation with support agent
        *   Highlighting of underutilized premium features
        *   Simple "Are you sure?" dialog with options to pause subscription instead.
*   **Reward Function:**
    *   Positive reward: User remains subscribed.
    *   Negative reward: User initiates cancellation.
    *   Intermediate rewards: Positive signal if the user engages with the proactive assistance (e.g., clicks on a tutorial, starts a chat session). This helps guide model learning.
*   **Model Training & Update:**
    *   Models are trained offline using historical data.
    *   Online learning: Models are continuously updated in real-time based on user interactions.
    *   A/B testing: Continuously evaluate the performance of different assistance options and bandit models.
*   **Deployment Architecture:**
    *   A microservice architecture for scalability and resilience.
    *   Real-time data streaming using a message queue (e.g., Kafka).
    *   Model serving using a dedicated inference server.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (executed for each user session)

UserActivity = GetUserActivityData()
BehavioralSignals = GetBehavioralSignals()
UserProfile = GetUserProfile()

Features = ExtractFeatures(UserActivity, BehavioralSignals, UserProfile)

// For each potential issue (e.g., Pricing, Usability, Support)
For issue in [Pricing, Usability, Support]:
    Model = LoadContextualBanditModel(issue)
    Action = Model.SelectAction(Features) // Select assistance option based on features
    PresentActionToUser() // Display the chosen assistance
    Reward = GetRewardBasedOnUserResponse() // Cancellation, Engagement, etc.
    Model.Update(Features, Action, Reward)

// Output: Proactively offered assistance and updated models
```

**Innovation:**  Moves beyond reactive cancellation mitigation to *predictive* intervention. Integrates real-time behavioral data to personalize assistance and maximize user retention. The contextual bandits adapt to individual user needs and continuously improve effectiveness.
