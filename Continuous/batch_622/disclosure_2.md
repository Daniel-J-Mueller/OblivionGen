## Adaptive Snapshotting with Predictive Pre-fetching

**Concept:** Extend the existing snapshotting system by introducing predictive pre-fetching of change log segments *before* a backup is requested. This aims to reduce latency for on-demand backups and improve the overall responsiveness of the system, particularly under high load. The system will learn access patterns to anticipate future backup requests and pre-fetch relevant data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Access Pattern History:** A time-series database storing records of backup requests, including:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Table ID
    *   Partition IDs (if applicable)
    *   Target Time
    *   Requesting Entity
*   **Prediction Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory network) trained on the Access Pattern History. This model predicts the probability of a backup request for each table/partition within a defined time window.
*   **Prefetch Queue:** A prioritized queue containing table/partition IDs to be prefetched, ordered by the prediction probability from the Prediction Model.
*   **Prefetch Worker Threads:** Multiple threads dedicated to fetching change log segments based on the Prefetch Queue.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Background Training:** The Prediction Model is continuously trained on the Access Pattern History. This training process should be asynchronous to avoid impacting backup performance.
2.  **Prediction Generation:** Every 'X' seconds (configurable), the Prediction Model generates probability scores for each table/partition.
3.  **Prefetch Queue Update:** The Prefetch Queue is updated based on the prediction scores. Table/partitions with higher probabilities are added to the queue with higher priority.
4.  **Prefetching:** Prefetch Worker Threads pull table/partition IDs from the Prefetch Queue and fetch the corresponding change log segments from durable storage. These segments are cached in a dedicated prefetch cache (in-memory or SSD-backed).
5.  **Backup Request Handling:** When an on-demand backup request is received:
    *   The system first checks the prefetch cache for the required change log segments.
    *   If the segments are found in the cache, they are used immediately, significantly reducing backup latency.
    *   If the segments are not in the cache, the system falls back to the standard change log fetching process.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
// Background Training (Continuous)
function trainPredictionModel(accessPatternHistory):
  model = new RNN()
  model.train(accessPatternHistory)
  return model

// Prediction Generation (Scheduled)
function generatePredictions(model, tableList):
  predictions = {}
  for table in tableList:
    predictions[table] = model.predict(table) // Returns probability score
  return predictions

// Prefetch Queue Update
function updatePrefetchQueue(predictions, queueCapacity):
  sortedTables = sort(predictions, byValueDescending) // Sort by probability score
  queue = new PriorityQueue()
  for i in range(min(queueCapacity, length(sortedTables))):
    queue.add(sortedTables[i])
  return queue

// Prefetch Worker Thread
function prefetchChangeLogs(prefetchQueue):
  while (true):
    table = prefetchQueue.poll()
    if table is null:
      sleep(1 second)
      continue
    fetchChangeLogs(table)
    cacheChangeLogs(table)

// Backup Request Handler
function handleBackupRequest(table, targetTime):
  cachedLogs = getCachedChangeLogs(table)
  if cachedLogs is not null:
    applyChanges(cachedLogs, targetTime)
    acknowledgeSuccess()
    return

  logs = fetchChangeLogs(table)
  applyChanges(logs, targetTime)
  acknowledgeSuccess()
```
