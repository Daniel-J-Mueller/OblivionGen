**Dynamic Affective Response System for Product Reviews**

**Specification:** A system that extends real-time semantic analysis to include *affective* (emotional) analysis of user-submitted text, triggering dynamic UI adjustments and personalized responses.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Real-time Text Input Monitoring:** Identical to the base patent – monitors free-text fields in a user interface.

2.  **Affective Analysis Engine:** Integrates with the semantic analysis. This engine uses natural language processing (NLP) to identify not just *what* is being said, but *how* it’s being said. Key elements:
    *   **Sentiment Detection:** Standard positive/negative/neutral.
    *   **Emotion Classification:** Goes beyond sentiment – identifies specific emotions (joy, anger, frustration, sadness, fear, etc.). Uses a lexicon and machine learning models trained on emotional language.
    *   **Intensity Quantification:** Assigns a numerical value to the intensity of detected emotions (e.g., "mild annoyance" vs. "extreme rage").

3.  **Dynamic UI Adjustment Module:** This module receives data from the Affective Analysis Engine and dynamically alters the UI:
    *   **Visual Feedback:** Changes in color scheme, animation, or visual elements based on detected emotion. (e.g., Red for anger, calming blue for frustration).
    *   **Content Adaptation:** Dynamically displays relevant help articles, FAQs, or support options based on the user's emotional state. (e.g., if a user expresses frustration with a setup process, show a targeted "troubleshooting" guide).
    *   **Response Prompting:** Suggests pre-written phrases or responses tailored to the user's emotion. (e.g., "We understand your frustration. Our team is here to help.")

4.  **Personalized Support Routing:** Analyzes the user's emotional state and routing them to appropriate support resources.
    *   **Escalation:** If intense negative emotions are detected, automatically escalate the case to a human agent.
    *   **Skill-Based Routing:** Route the case to an agent specialized in handling the identified emotion or issue. (e.g., an agent trained in de-escalation techniques for angry customers).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyzeReview(reviewText) {
  semanticAnalysisResult = performSemanticAnalysis(reviewText)
  affectiveAnalysisResult = performAffectiveAnalysis(reviewText)

  emotion = affectiveAnalysisResult.dominantEmotion
  intensity = affectiveAnalysisResult.intensity

  if (emotion == "anger" && intensity > 0.7) {
    escalateToHumanAgent()
    displayCalmingVisuals()
    suggestResponse("We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience...")
  } else if (emotion == "frustration") {
    displayTroubleshootingGuide()
    suggestResponse("Let's try to resolve this together...")
  } else if (semanticAnalysisResult.qualityIssue == "safetyConcern") {
    // Existing patent logic for safety concerns
  } else {
    // Standard processing
  }
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Cloud-based NLP processing engine.
*   Real-time data streaming infrastructure.
*   Client-side JavaScript for UI adjustments.
*   Machine learning models for emotion classification.
*   Secure data storage for user interaction history.
