## Dynamic Snapshot Materialization with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand upon the snapshot generation by introducing a predictive prefetching mechanism that anticipates future data needs based on historical query patterns and transaction rates. Instead of solely reacting to changes, proactively materialize potential future snapshot views, significantly reducing latency for analytical queries.

**Specification:**

**1. Historical Query Analyzer (HQA):**

*   **Input:** Audit logs of all queries executed against the snapshot data store (or a representative sample).
*   **Process:**
    *   Tracks query frequency, execution time, data access patterns (tables, columns, filters).
    *   Identifies commonly accessed data combinations.
    *   Predicts future query patterns based on time-series analysis and machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
*   **Output:** Ranked list of predicted high-demand snapshot views with estimated data access patterns.  Also outputs confidence levels for predictions.

**2. Predictive Snapshot Builder (PSB):**

*   **Input:** Ranked list of predicted snapshot views from HQA, current master data store state.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Tiered Materialization:**
        *   **Tier 1 (High Confidence):**  Fully materialize predicted views in a dedicated "Prefetched Snapshot Store". This store is optimized for read performance (e.g., columnar database).
        *   **Tier 2 (Medium Confidence):**  Partially materialize views by pre-calculating and storing frequently used aggregations or filters.  Requires on-demand calculation for the remaining data.
        *   **Tier 3 (Low Confidence):**  No pre-materialization. Standard snapshot generation process.
    *   **Incremental Updates:**  Continuously update prefetched snapshots with changes from the master data store. Uses a change data capture (CDC) mechanism.
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Dynamically adjust the level of pre-materialization based on available resources (CPU, memory, storage). Prioritizes views with the highest predicted demand and confidence levels.

**3. Query Router:**

*   **Input:** Incoming analytical queries.
*   **Process:**
    *   **View Identification:** Determines if a prefetched snapshot exists that can satisfy the query.
    *   **Route Optimization:**
        *   If a full prefetched snapshot exists, routes the query directly to the Prefetched Snapshot Store.
        *   If a partial snapshot exists, routes the query to the Prefetched Snapshot Store for the pre-calculated data and to the standard snapshot generation process for the remaining data.
        *   If no snapshot exists, routes the query to the standard snapshot generation process.

**Pseudocode (PSB - Incremental Update):**

```
function updatePrefetchedSnapshot(predictedView, changedRecords):
  if predictedView.materializationTier == 1:
    for record in changedRecords:
      // Apply record to prefetched snapshot
      updatePrefetchedData(record, predictedView.dataStore)
  else if predictedView.materializationTier == 2:
    // Calculate any required aggregations/filters based on changedRecords
    updatedAggregations = calculateAggregations(changedRecords, predictedView.filters)
    storeAggregations(updatedAggregations, predictedView.dataStore)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PredictedView`: {`viewName`, `materializationTier`, `filters`, `dataStore`, `confidenceLevel`}
*   `ChangeRecord`: {`table`, `recordID`, `fieldsChanged`, `timestamp`}

**Technology Stack:**

*   **CDC:** Debezium, Kafka Connect
*   **Data Store:** Columnar database (e.g., ClickHouse, Apache Druid)
*   **Machine Learning:** Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
*   **Queue:** Kafka, RabbitMQ
