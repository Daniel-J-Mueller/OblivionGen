## Adaptive Network Topology Mirroring & Predictive Shifting

**Concept:** Extend the traffic shifting idea beyond reactive adjustments to *proactively* mirror network topology and traffic flows *before* issues arise, utilizing predictive analytics to anticipate congestion or failures. This isn't just moving traffic *away* from a problem; it's having a shadow network ready to take over seamlessly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Topology Mirroring Service (TMS):**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors network topology (links, devices, capacities) and creates a mirrored representation. This mirror exists as a software-defined overlay, not physical duplication.
*   **Data Sources:** SNMP, NetFlow/sFlow, BGP peering data, device telemetry, and historical traffic patterns.
*   **Mirroring Granularity:** Configurable – full mirror, critical path mirror, application-specific mirror.
*   **Overlay Technology:**  Utilize a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller (e.g., OpenDaylight, ONOS) to manage the mirrored topology.
*   **Mirror State:** Active (mirrored topology fully functional), Standby (mirrored topology minimal resource allocation), Off (mirroring disabled).

**2. Predictive Traffic Analysis Engine (PTAE):**

*   **Function:**  Analyzes historical and real-time traffic data to predict congestion, failures, and capacity bottlenecks.
*   **Algorithms:** Time series analysis, machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks, LSTM) trained on network performance data.  Anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual traffic patterns.
*   **Prediction Horizon:** Configurable – short-term (minutes), medium-term (hours), long-term (days).
*   **Triggering Conditions:**  Configurable thresholds for predicted congestion, packet loss, latency increases, or device failures.

**3.  Proactive Shifting Protocol (PSP):**

*   **Function:** Orchestrates the shifting of traffic to the mirrored topology *before* a problem occurs, based on predictions from the PTAE.
*   **Shifting Granularity:**  Per-flow, per-application, per-subnet.
*   **Shifting Methods:**  Adjust routing metrics (cost, weight), modify BGP paths, redirect traffic via SDN controller.
*   **Verification:**  Real-time monitoring of traffic flow on both the primary and mirrored networks to ensure successful shifting and minimal disruption.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** Automated rollback to the primary network if the mirrored network performs poorly or a problem is detected.

**4.  Dynamic Cost Parameter Adjustment (DCPA):**

*   **Function:** Refines the PSP by intelligently adjusting cost parameters on interfaces in *both* the primary and mirrored networks.
*   **Algorithm:** A reinforcement learning agent optimizes cost parameters based on real-time performance data and predicted traffic patterns.  Agent rewards successful shifts and penalizes disruptions.
*   **Interface Focus:** Cost parameter adjustments are applied to specific interfaces associated with critical paths or applications.

**Pseudocode (PSP - core logic):**

```
function proactiveTrafficShift(predictedEvent, shiftGranularity, targetTopology):
    if PTAE.predict(predictedEvent) > threshold:
        if targetTopology == "mirror":
            // Adjust routing policies/metrics in primary network
            adjustRouting(shiftGranularity, interfaces, cost = highCost)
            // Activate mirrored topology
            activateTopology(targetTopology)
            // Adjust routing policies/metrics in mirrored network
            adjustRouting(shiftGranularity, interfaces, cost = lowCost)
        else:
            // revert to primary topology
            deactivateTopology(targetTopology)
            adjustRouting(shiftGranularity, interfaces, cost = defaultCost)
        monitorTraffic(primaryNetwork, mirroredNetwork)
        if disruptionDetected():
            rollbackToPrimary()

    return
```

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources for data analysis and topology mirroring.
*   Integration with existing network management systems (NMS) is crucial.
*   Security considerations – ensure the mirrored topology is protected from unauthorized access.
