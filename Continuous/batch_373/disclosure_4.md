## Adaptive Query Weighting via Document Embedding Similarity

**Concept:** The patent focuses on identifying potential duplicates via query execution and ranking. This adaptation introduces a dynamic query weighting system based on the semantic similarity between the source document and documents returned in initial results sets. The intention is to refine searches, reduce noise, and prioritize queries that demonstrably align with the source document's core topic.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Document Embedding Generation:**
    *   Utilize a pre-trained document embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers, Doc2Vec) to generate vector representations for both the source document and all documents retrieved from initial query results sets.

2.  **Similarity Metric:**
    *   Employ cosine similarity to quantify the semantic relatedness between the source document embedding and each retrieved document embedding.

3.  **Query Weight Adjustment:**
    *   For each query in the original list, calculate a weighting factor based on the average cosine similarity of documents returned by that query.  Specifically:

        `Weight(Query_i) = Average(Cosine_Similarity(Source_Document, Document_j) for Document_j in Results(Query_i))`

        *   Queries yielding high average similarity receive increased weights.
        *   Queries with low similarity receive decreased weights.
        *   Weights are normalized to sum to 1.

4.  **Weighted Query Execution:**
    *   Re-execute queries with adjusted weights. This can be implemented in two ways:

        *   **Score Aggregation:**  Combine relevance scores from each query, weighted by their calculated weight.
        *   **Iterative Refinement:** Use the highest-weighted queries first, progressively adding lower-weighted queries if necessary.

5.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Based on the weighted query results, dynamically adjust the score threshold for selecting potential duplicates.  Higher-weighted queries contributing to strong matches could warrant a lower threshold, while lower-weighted queries may require a higher threshold.

6.  **Feedback Loop (Optional):**
    *   If user feedback is available (e.g., confirmation of duplicate or non-duplicate), incorporate this feedback into the weighting system.  Queries leading to confirmed duplicates receive increased weights, while queries leading to false positives receive decreased weights.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function AdaptiveQueryWeighting(SourceDocument, QueryList, DocumentCorpus):
  // Generate embedding for SourceDocument
  SourceEmbedding = GenerateDocumentEmbedding(SourceDocument)

  // Calculate weights for each query
  QueryWeights = {}
  for Query in QueryList:
    Results = ExecuteQuery(Query, DocumentCorpus)
    TotalSimilarity = 0
    for Document in Results:
      DocumentEmbedding = GenerateDocumentEmbedding(Document)
      TotalSimilarity += CosineSimilarity(SourceEmbedding, DocumentEmbedding)
    AverageSimilarity = TotalSimilarity / Length(Results)
    QueryWeights[Query] = AverageSimilarity

  // Normalize weights
  TotalWeight = Sum(QueryWeights.values())
  for Query in QueryWeights:
    QueryWeights[Query] /= TotalWeight

  // Re-execute queries with weights
  WeightedResults = {}
  for Query in QueryWeights:
    Results = ExecuteQuery(Query, DocumentCorpus)
    WeightedResults[Query] = Results

  // Aggregate scores based on weights and relevance
  CombinedScores = {}
  for Query in WeightedResults:
    for Document in WeightedResults[Query]:
      Score = RelevanceScore(Document, Query) * QueryWeights[Query]
      CombinedScores[Document] += Score

  // Select potential duplicates based on combined scores and dynamic threshold
  PotentialDuplicates = SelectDuplicates(CombinedScores, DynamicThreshold)
  return PotentialDuplicates
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Incorporate a decay factor into the weight calculation to prioritize recent results.
*   Utilize a more sophisticated similarity metric, such as semantic textual similarity (STS).
*   Explore the use of reinforcement learning to optimize the query weighting system.
*   Implement a collaborative filtering approach to leverage weights learned from other users.
