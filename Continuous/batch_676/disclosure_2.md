## Dynamic Knowledge Graph Construction from Web Content

**Concept:** Augment the attribute extraction system with a dynamically constructed knowledge graph built from the target web corpus itself. Instead of relying solely on a pre-existing knowledge base, the system actively learns relationships and attributes *within* the documents being processed. This allows for extraction of attributes not present in the initial knowledge base and handles evolving terminology/concepts.

**Specs:**

1.  **Web Content Parsing Module:**
    *   Input: Raw HTML of a web page.
    *   Output:  A structured representation of the page content.  This involves identifying key sections (headings, paragraphs, lists, tables), extracting text, and associating text with its structural context. Use a combination of DOM parsing and potentially computer vision (for image-based text).

2.  **Relationship Extraction Engine:**
    *   Input:  Structured web content (from step 1).
    *   Method: Utilize a transformer-based model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) fine-tuned for relation extraction.  The model identifies entity pairs (e.g., "company X" and "CEO Y") and the relationship between them (e.g., "is CEO of").  This is performed at the constituent object level.
    *   Output: A list of (entity1, relationship, entity2) triples.

3.  **Knowledge Graph Construction:**
    *   Input:  Extracted triples.
    *   Method:  Use a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to store the extracted knowledge. Nodes represent entities (attributes, values, objects), and edges represent relationships.  Implement a confidence scoring mechanism for each edge based on the relation extraction modelâ€™s confidence score.
    *   Output: A dynamic knowledge graph representing the information extracted from the web corpus.

4.  **Attribute Value Scoring Enhancement:**
    *   Input: Candidate constituent object, derived probabilistic labels, dynamic knowledge graph.
    *   Method:  Modify the existing attribute value presence probability score assignment. Incorporate path-based similarity analysis *within* the constructed knowledge graph.  Instead of only comparing constituent object content to example values in the pre-existing knowledge base, also compare paths of related entities in the dynamic knowledge graph. If a constituent object is strongly connected to entities with known attribute values, its probability score increases. Implement a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., breadth-first search) to identify relevant connections.
    *   Output: Adjusted attribute value presence probability scores.

5.  **Adaptive Knowledge Base Update:**
    *   Input: Dynamic knowledge graph, confidence scores of edges.
    *   Method: Implement a mechanism to periodically review the dynamic knowledge graph and identify potential updates to the pre-existing knowledge base.  Edges with high confidence scores and consistent occurrences across multiple documents could be candidates for inclusion in the main knowledge base.  Implement a validation process to ensure the accuracy of the proposed updates.
    *   Output: Proposed updates to the pre-existing knowledge base.

**Pseudocode (Attribute Value Scoring Enhancement):**

```
function calculate_enhanced_score(constituent_object, derived_label_score, knowledge_graph):
  base_score = derived_label_score

  # Perform graph traversal to find related entities
  related_entities = knowledge_graph.traverse(constituent_object, depth=3)

  # Calculate a graph connectivity score
  connectivity_score = 0
  for entity in related_entities:
    if entity.has_attribute(target_attribute):
      connectivity_score += entity.attribute_value_confidence

  # Combine base score with connectivity score
  enhanced_score = base_score + (connectivity_score * weight_factor)

  return enhanced_score
```

**Weight Factor:** A tunable parameter to control the influence of the dynamic knowledge graph on the attribute value scoring process.
