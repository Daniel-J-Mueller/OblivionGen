## Dynamic ASR Persona Synthesis

**Concept:** Augment the ASR system with a real-time “persona” construction module that influences language model selection *and* acoustic model adaptation. This goes beyond simply identifying entity classes – it aims to synthesize a *behavioral* profile of the speaker based on linguistic style, emotional cues, and identified entities.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Module:** A dedicated component operating in parallel with the core ASR pipeline.
*   **Input:** Raw audio data (pre-ASR) and initial ASR output (first word/phrase).
*   **Feature Extraction:**
    *   *Linguistic Style:* Analyze sentence structure, vocabulary richness, use of slang/idioms, and common phrasing. Implement a vector representation of these features.
    *   *Emotional Analysis:* Detect emotional tone (happiness, sadness, anger, etc.) from speech prosody. Output a weighted emotion vector.
    *   *Entity Linking:* Identify named entities (people, places, organizations) as in the base patent, but also infer relationships between entities (e.g., “John works at Acme”). Store in a graph database.
*   **Persona Vector Construction:** Combine the linguistic style vector, emotion vector, and entity graph representation into a single, high-dimensional “persona vector”. Employ a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., autoencoder) to compress the vector while preserving relevant information.
*   **LM/AM Weighting & Blending:**
    *   *LM Selection:*  Map the persona vector to a cluster of pre-trained language models (general, technical, informal, etc.). Assign weights to multiple LMs based on proximity in the persona vector space. Blend the outputs of these LMs.
    *   *AM Adaptation:* Utilize the persona vector to adapt the acoustic model.  Employ a technique like feature-space adaptation or model mixing to shift the acoustic space towards the speaker’s characteristics.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Incorporate the ASR confidence scores (from the weighted LM outputs) into the persona vector construction. This refines the persona model over time.
*   **Hardware:**  High-performance compute with GPU acceleration for vector processing.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function process_audio(audio_data):
  persona_vector = construct_persona_vector(audio_data)
  
  // LM Selection and Weighting
  selected_LMs = find_nearest_LMs(persona_vector)
  LM_weights = calculate_LM_weights(persona_vector, selected_LMs)

  // Acoustic Model Adaptation
  adapted_AM = adapt_acoustic_model(persona_vector)

  // ASR Pipeline
  ASR_output = run_ASR(audio_data, adapted_AM, selected_LMs, LM_weights)

  return ASR_output

function construct_persona_vector(audio_data):
  linguistic_style = analyze_linguistic_style(audio_data)
  emotion_vector = analyze_emotion(audio_data)
  entity_graph = build_entity_graph(audio_data)

  persona_vector = combine_vectors(linguistic_style, emotion_vector, entity_graph)
  persona_vector = reduce_dimensionality(persona_vector)

  return persona_vector
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond static LM selection based on entity *type*.  It constructs a dynamic, multi-faceted speaker profile, enabling a more personalized and accurate ASR experience.  The feedback loop allows the system to learn and adapt to individual speakers over time.
