## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Notification Orchestration

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply routing notifications to a ‘best’ device within an acoustic region. Instead, reconstruct a dynamic, spatially-aware acoustic scene model, enabling granular, personalized notification delivery based on user activity *within* that scene.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from multiple device microphones (as in the patent), but *also* incorporate data from other onboard sensors: accelerometers, gyroscopes, cameras (RGB/Depth), and potentially even proximity sensors.  Data streams are time-synchronized via network time protocol (NTP) or similar.
*   **Acoustic Scene Analysis (ASA) Module:** Employ machine learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks trained on audio event datasets) to identify acoustic events within each device’s audio capture. Events include: speech, music, appliance operation, environmental sounds (traffic, construction), etc.
*   **Spatial Audio Processing:** Utilize beamforming and sound source localization techniques to estimate the 3D position of sound sources within the acoustic region.  Microphone array geometry is crucial. Kalman filtering can be employed to track sound source movement.
*   **Activity Recognition:**  Combine ASA output with sensor data to infer user activities.  Example: "User is cooking at the stove," "User is watching TV on the couch," "User is engaged in a phone call at the desk.”  Use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for activity classification.
*   **Scene Graph Construction:**  Dynamically build a scene graph representing the acoustic environment. Nodes represent objects (user, appliances, furniture) and sound sources. Edges represent spatial relationships and acoustic interactions.  This provides a contextual understanding of the environment.
*   **Personalized Notification Orchestration:**  Based on the scene graph and user activity, orchestrate notifications in a granular and personalized way:
    *   **Device Selection:**  Notifications are routed to the device *most relevant* to the user’s current activity.  For example, a timer notification for cooking is sent to a smart speaker in the kitchen, while a video call notification is sent to a smart display in the living room.
    *   **Notification Modality:**  Adapt the notification modality (audio, visual, haptic) based on the context.  A gentle chime might be used while the user is engaged in a phone call, while a more prominent visual alert might be used when the user is watching TV.
    *   **Spatial Audio Cueing:**  Employ spatial audio rendering techniques to simulate the direction of a sound source, drawing the user's attention to a specific location.  For example, the sound of an incoming notification might appear to originate from the location of the smart device initiating the alert.
    *   **Contextual Information Overlay:**  Augment notifications with contextual information relevant to the user's activity.  For example, a smart display might show a recipe step-by-step while the user is cooking.
*   **User Profile Integration:**  Store user preferences and activity patterns in a user profile.  The system learns over time to anticipate user needs and proactively deliver relevant information.

**Pseudocode (Notification Orchestration):**

```
function orchestrateNotification(notificationData, userProfile, sceneGraph):
  activity = getActivity(sceneGraph)
  device = selectBestDevice(activity, notificationData, userProfile)
  modality = determineModality(activity, notificationData, userProfile)
  spatialCue = generateSpatialCue(device, sceneGraph)

  if modality == "audio":
    renderSpatialAudio(audioData, spatialCue)
  else if modality == "visual":
    displayNotification(notificationData)
    overlayContextualInfo(notificationData, sceneGraph)
  else if modality == "haptic":
    triggerHapticFeedback(hapticPattern)

  sendNotification(notificationData, device)
```

**Expansion:**

*   Integrate with smart home devices (lights, thermostats) to create a more immersive and responsive notification experience.
*   Develop a privacy-preserving mode that allows users to control how their data is collected and used.
*   Explore the use of generative AI to create personalized notification sounds and visual effects.
