## Dynamic Scene Graph Construction with Affective Computing Integration

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon video segmentation by incorporating real-time affective computing to refine scene understanding and create a dynamically updating scene graph. Instead of solely relying on visual and audio cues, the system analyzes facial expressions, body language, and vocal tone of individuals *within* the video to infer emotional context and adjust scene boundaries accordingly.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Feature Extraction:**  Captures features from video frames (visual), audio tracks (acoustic), and facial/body pose estimation (kinematic). Existing visual segmentation techniques (like those in the provided patent) serve as a foundational layer.

2.  **Affective State Estimation:**  A deep learning model (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network – CRNN) trained on extensive datasets of facial expressions, vocal intonation, and body language, predicts the emotional state (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, neutral) of each detected individual in each frame. This model outputs a probability distribution over a defined set of emotional categories.

3.  **Emotion-Aware Segmentation Refinement:** The system uses the affective state estimations to *refine* initial segmentation boundaries.  A key innovation is the “Emotional Cohesion” metric.

    *   **Emotional Cohesion Calculation:** For each potential scene boundary, the system calculates the average emotional state *difference* between the frames on either side.  If the emotional states are significantly divergent (e.g., a sudden shift from joy to sadness), the boundary is strengthened. If emotional states are similar, the boundary is weakened or potentially merged.

    *   **Dynamic Thresholding:** The "significance" of an emotional difference isn't static.  It adapts based on the overall "emotional energy" of the video.  A highly emotionally charged video will have a higher threshold for boundary creation, while a more subdued video will require a more pronounced emotional shift.

4.  **Dynamic Scene Graph Construction:** The refined segmentation data feeds into a dynamic scene graph. Each node in the graph represents a scene, and edges represent relationships between scenes. Node attributes include:

    *   Dominant Emotional State: The average emotional state of the scene.
    *   Key Actors/Objects:  Identified through object detection and facial recognition.
    *   Temporal Duration: Start and end times.
    *   Emotional Transition Type:  Describes the emotional shift between adjacent scenes (e.g., "positive to neutral," "anger to sadness").

**Pseudocode – Emotion-Aware Segmentation Refinement:**

```
function refine_segmentation(video_frames, initial_segments, affective_estimates):
  refined_segments = initial_segments
  for i from 0 to length(refined_segments) - 1:
    boundary_frame = refined_segments[i].end_frame
    next_scene_frame = boundary_frame + 1

    emotional_state_before = calculate_average_emotional_state(frames_in_range(refined_segments[i].start_frame, refined_segments[i].end_frame), affective_estimates)
    emotional_state_after = calculate_average_emotional_state(frames_in_range(next_scene_frame, next_scene_frame + segment_length), affective_estimates) # segment_length = default/adaptive length

    emotional_difference = calculate_emotional_distance(emotional_state_before, emotional_state_after) # e.g., Euclidean distance in emotional space

    if emotional_difference > emotional_threshold:
      strengthen_boundary(refined_segments[i]) # Increase confidence, prevent merging
    else:
      consider_merging(refined_segments[i], refined_segments[i+1]) # Evaluate if frames should be combined

  return refined_segments
```

**Output and Applications:**

The dynamic scene graph facilitates:

*   **Emotion-Based Video Navigation:**  Users can navigate videos based on emotional themes (e.g., "show me all the happy scenes," "skip to the suspenseful moments").
*   **Enhanced Content Recommendation:** Recommendation systems can leverage emotional context to suggest videos with similar emotional profiles.
*   **Real-Time Emotion-Aware Editing:**  Automated video editors can dynamically adjust pacing, music, and visual effects based on the emotional content.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:**  Applications in security, healthcare, and customer service can analyze emotional cues to detect anomalies or understand user behavior.
