## Adaptive Propeller Resonance System

**Concept:** Utilize the magnetic alignment principles from the patent not for static positioning, but for *dynamic* resonance tuning of propeller blades, increasing efficiency and reducing noise.

**Specifications:**

*   **Components:**
    *   **Propeller Hub (Static):**  Contains a ring of electromagnets (at least 12, evenly spaced) powered by a dedicated microcontroller. These electromagnets are the "tuning" elements. Each electromagnet has a small range of field strength adjustment.
    *   **Blade Roots (Rotating):** Each propeller blade will have a corresponding magnetic element integrated into its root â€“ a high-strength permanent magnet with a precisely calibrated polarity.
    *   **Sensor Suite:** Accelerometers and strain gauges embedded within each blade near the root.
    *   **Microcontroller & DSP:** Dedicated processing unit to manage electromagnet power, analyze sensor data, and implement resonance tuning algorithms.
    *   **Power Supply:** Integrated into the propeller hub, supplying power to electromagnets and the microcontroller/DSP.

*   **Operation:**
    1.  **Initial Calibration:** During system initialization, a 'sweep' is performed. The microcontroller systematically adjusts the current to each electromagnet, varying its magnetic field strength.  Sensor data (acceleration, strain) from the blades is recorded for each setting. This builds a 'resonance map' identifying the frequencies at which each blade is most susceptible to vibration.
    2.  **Real-time Tuning:**  During operation, the microcontroller continuously monitors the sensor data. It then adjusts the current to the electromagnets to subtly *counteract* unwanted vibrations and/or *amplify* desired resonant frequencies.
    3.  **Adaptive Algorithm:** The algorithm should consider flight parameters (airspeed, engine RPM, angle of attack) to optimize resonance tuning for various conditions.
    4.  **Feedback Loop:** A closed-loop feedback system ensures accurate and stable resonance control.

*   **Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
//Initialization
build_resonance_map() {
    for each electromagnet {
        set_field_strength(electromagnet, current_level)
        record_sensor_data(sensor_suite)
        increment_current_level
    }
}

//Real-time control
adjust_resonance() {
    read_sensor_data(sensor_suite)
    calculate_error(sensor_data)
    adjust_electromagnet_current(error)
}

adjust_electromagnet_current(error) {
    for each electromagnet {
        current_adjustment = error * gain * weighting_factor
        current = current + current_adjustment
        set_electromagnet_current(electromagnet, current)
    }
}
```

*   **Materials:**
    *   High-strength permanent magnets (Neodymium Iron Boron recommended)
    *   Lightweight, high-conductivity materials for electromagnets (copper coils)
    *   Carbon fiber reinforced polymer for structural components

*   **Potential benefits:**
    *   Increased propeller efficiency
    *   Reduced noise levels
    *   Improved flight stability
    *   Reduced blade stress & fatigue.
