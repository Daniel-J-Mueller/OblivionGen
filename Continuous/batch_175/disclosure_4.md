## Dynamic Data Center 'Digital Twin' Projection & Augmented Reality Interface

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core:** Expand upon the graph-based data center analysis by integrating real-time sensor data feeds (temperature, power, network latency, physical security) into a continuously updating 3D ‘digital twin’ model of the data center.
*   **Rendering Engine:** Utilize a high-fidelity rendering engine (Unity, Unreal Engine) capable of representing the data center layout, equipment, and operational status visually.
*   **Data Ingestion:** API endpoints for receiving data from various sources:
    *   Existing data store (as described in the patent)
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, airflow)
    *   Power Distribution Units (PDU) - real-time load, voltage, current
    *   Network switches/routers – bandwidth utilization, latency, errors
    *   Security systems – camera feeds, access logs, intrusion detection
    *   Equipment logs (servers, storage arrays) – CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O
*   **Graph Database Integration:** The existing graph database serves as the foundational data structure. Real-time data updates the node and edge attributes within the graph.
*   **AR/VR Interface:** Develop an Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) application to overlay the digital twin onto the physical data center environment, or to allow immersive exploration within a VR simulation.
*   **User Roles & Permissions:** Implement role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality.
*   **Alerting & Visualization:**
    *   Critical thresholds are defined for key metrics.
    *   Alerts are triggered when thresholds are exceeded.
    *   AR/VR interface highlights the affected equipment.
    *   Visualizations (heatmaps, graphs) display real-time status.
*   **Predictive Analytics Integration:** Integrate machine learning models to predict potential failures, optimize power usage, and improve overall data center efficiency.
*   **Remote Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to view and interact with the digital twin remotely.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {

    // 1. Data Ingestion
    sensorData = ReceiveSensorData();
    eventLogs = ReceiveEventLogs();

    // 2. Graph Update
    UpdateGraph(sensorData, eventLogs); //Update node/edge attributes.

    // 3. Anomaly Detection
    anomalies = DetectAnomalies(sensorData);

    // 4. Visualization Update
    UpdateVisualization(anomalies);

    // 5. AR/VR Rendering
    RenderARVRScene();

    // 6. Alerting
    if(anomalies present) {
        TriggerAlerts(anomalies);
    }
}

// Function: UpdateGraph(sensorData, eventLogs)
for each sensor in sensorData {
    node = FindNodeByID(sensor.deviceID);
    node.temperature = sensor.temperature;
    node.powerUsage = sensor.powerUsage;
    //Update other attributes
}
for each event in eventLogs {
    node = FindNodeByID(event.deviceID);
    node.status = event.status; //e.g. "online", "offline", "error"
}

// Function: DetectAnomalies(sensorData)
//Implement anomaly detection algorithms (e.g. thresholding, statistical analysis, machine learning)
//Return list of anomalies with details (deviceID, metric, value, threshold)
```

**Novelty:** 

This moves beyond static graph analysis to a dynamic, interactive, and visually immersive representation of the data center. The integration of AR/VR provides a new way for operators to monitor, diagnose, and manage the data center infrastructure.  The predictive analytics component allows for proactive maintenance and optimization.
