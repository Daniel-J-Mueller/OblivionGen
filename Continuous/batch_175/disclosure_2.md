**Dynamic Content ‘Sharding’ Based on Predicted User Behavior**

**Concept:** Extend the pre-loading concept to not just *where* content is preloaded, but *how* it’s preloaded – breaking content into dynamically sized ‘shards’ based on predicted user engagement patterns. Instead of caching full files, the system anticipates *which parts* of a resource users will likely consume, and pre-loads those segments.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Prediction Engine:** A module integrated into the CDN that analyzes user interaction data (clicks, scrolls, time spent on page, etc.) to build predictive models for resource consumption.  This is built on top of the existing observed behavior used to define 'classes'.

    *   Input: User interaction logs, content metadata (e.g., video length, article word count, image resolution).
    *   Output: Probability distribution for content segment access – e.g., “User is 80% likely to view the first 20% of this video, 60% likely to view the next 30%, 30% for the remainder”.
    *   Algorithm: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer-based model trained on historical user data.

2.  **Dynamic Sharding Module:** This module receives the predicted access probabilities and divides content into variable-length ‘shards’.

    *   Input: Content file, predicted access probabilities.
    *   Process:
        *   Algorithm:  A greedy algorithm that maximizes the cumulative probability of pre-loaded content. Start with the most probable segment, then add segments until a pre-defined total probability threshold is met or a maximum shard count is reached.
        *   Shard Size: Variable, determined by the algorithm.  Minimum shard size configurable.
        *   Metadata: Each shard is associated with metadata indicating its position within the original content and its predicted access probability.

3.  **Adaptive Pre-loading:**  The CDN pre-loads the dynamically generated shards to the selected cache components (as in the original patent).

    *   Cache Component Selection:  Utilizes the existing class-based CDN selection logic.
    *   Pre-load Prioritization:  Shards with higher predicted access probabilities are pre-loaded first.
    *   Shard Reassembly:  The client requests segments, and the CDN reassembles them into the complete resource.

4.  **Real-time Adjustment:**  The Behavioral Prediction Engine continuously monitors user interaction and adjusts shard generation and pre-loading in real-time.

    *   Feedback Loop: User interactions with pre-loaded shards are fed back into the Behavioral Prediction Engine to refine the models.
    *   Dynamic Shard Creation:  New shards can be created or existing ones adjusted on-the-fly based on observed behavior.

**Pseudocode (Shard Generation):**

```
function generateShards(content, probabilityDistribution, maxShards, minShardSize):
  shards = []
  currentShard = []
  currentProbability = 0

  for segment in content:
    if (currentProbability + segment.probability < threshold) and (len(currentShard) < maxShards) and (len(currentShard) > minShardSize):
      currentShard.append(segment)
      currentProbability += segment.probability
    else:
      if len(currentShard) > 0:
        shards.append(currentShard)
      currentShard = [segment]
      currentProbability = segment.probability

  if len(currentShard) > 0:
    shards.append(currentShard)

  return shards
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced bandwidth usage: By only pre-loading the most likely content segments.
*   Improved user experience: Faster initial load times for frequently accessed content.
*   Enhanced scalability: More efficient use of cache resources.
*   Adaptive to changing user behavior: Real-time adjustment of pre-loading strategies.
