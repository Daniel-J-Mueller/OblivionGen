## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping & Spatial Audio Beaconing

**Concept:** Leverage the speaker’s microphone array (inherent for voice control) and the wireless provisioning system to create a real-time acoustic map of the environment *and* utilize directional audio beaconing to guide user placement for optimal A/V device connectivity and performance.

**Specifications:**

**Hardware:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Existing speaker microphone array (minimum 4 elements).
*   **Directional Speaker Driver:** Utilize existing speaker driver, enhanced with software beamforming capabilities.
*   **Processing Unit:** Existing speaker processor, with increased RAM allocation for acoustic mapping.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Existing wireless communication module.

**Software:**

*   **Acoustic Mapping Module:**
    *   **Data Acquisition:** Continuously samples audio from the microphone array.
    *   **Signal Processing:** Performs Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) analysis to identify sound source locations (walls, furniture, A/V device).
    *   **Map Generation:** Creates a 3D acoustic map of the room, identifying reflective surfaces and potential interference zones.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Updates the acoustic map in real-time based on environmental changes (moving furniture, people).
*   **Beaconing Module:**
    *   **Connectivity Assessment:** Uses the acoustic map to determine optimal placement for the A/V device for best wireless signal strength and minimal interference.
    *   **Directional Audio Beacon:** Generates directional audio cues (chimes, spoken instructions) to guide the user to the optimal A/V device location. The intensity and direction of the beacon dynamically adjusts based on the acoustic map and the user’s estimated position.
    *   **Beacon Customization:** Allows users to select different beacon sounds or voices.
    *   **Range Adjustment:** Provides a way to adjust the effective range of the directional beacon.
*   **Provisioning Integration:**
    *   The provisioning process (as described in the patent) is triggered *after* the directional beaconing process has guided the user to the optimal A/V device location. This ensures a stronger initial connection.

**Pseudocode (Beaconing Module):**

```
FUNCTION GuideUser(A/V_Device_ID)

    // Get Current Acoustic Map
    acoustic_map = GetAcousticMap()

    // Calculate Optimal A/V Device Location
    optimal_location = CalculateOptimalLocation(acoustic_map, A/V_Device_ID)

    // Get User Estimated Position (using microphone triangulation)
    user_position = GetUserPosition()

    // Calculate Direction to Optimal Location
    direction = CalculateDirection(user_position, optimal_location)

    // Set Beamforming Parameters (direction, intensity)
    SetBeamformingParameters(direction, intensity)

    // Play Beacon Sound (directional)
    PlayBeaconSound()

    // Monitor User Movement (using microphone triangulation)
    WHILE UserHasNotReachedOptimalLocation() DO
        user_position = GetUserPosition()
        direction = CalculateDirection(user_position, optimal_location)
        SetBeamformingParameters(direction, intensity)
        PlayBeaconSound()
    ENDWHILE

    // Play Confirmation Sound
    PlayConfirmationSound()

END FUNCTION
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   The system could be expanded to support multiple A/V devices, providing individualized guidance for each.
*   Integration with smart home platforms could allow for automated device placement suggestions based on room layout and usage patterns.
*   The acoustic map could be used for other purposes, such as automatically adjusting speaker equalization for optimal sound quality.
*   The beamforming aspect could be refined using machine learning to tailor the acoustic guidance to individual user preferences.
