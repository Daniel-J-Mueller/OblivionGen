## Adaptive Data Tiering via Predictive Subsequence Splitting

**Concept:** Extend the prefix/subsequence tracking to enable *proactive* data tiering based on predicted access patterns, rather than purely reactive splitting. This isn't just about load balancing, but about intelligently moving data closer to anticipated access points *before* contention arises.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Historical subsequence access logs, subsequence counter values, key size distributions, time-of-day patterns, user profiles (if available).
*   **Algorithm:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict future subsequence access frequency. The LSTM will model temporal dependencies in access patterns.  A separate model could be trained per user profile, if that data is available.
*   **Output:**  A "tiering score" for each subsequence, representing the predicted probability of high access in a defined future window (e.g., the next 5 minutes).

**2. Tiering Levels:**

*   **Tier 0 (Fastest):**  In-memory cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached).  Limited capacity.  Reserved for subsequences with the highest tiering scores.
*   **Tier 1 (Fast):**  NVMe SSD storage.  Larger capacity than Tier 0.  For subsequences with high tiering scores, but not fitting in Tier 0.
*   **Tier 2 (Standard):**  SATA SSD storage.  Large capacity.  For subsequences with moderate tiering scores.
*   **Tier 3 (Archive):**  HDD storage.  Very large capacity. For subsequences with low tiering scores.

**3. Adaptive Tiering Process:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor subsequence access patterns and update tiering scores using the prediction engine.
*   **Tiering Thresholds:** Define thresholds for each tier (e.g., Tier 0: Tiering Score > 0.9, Tier 1: 0.7 < Tiering Score <= 0.9, etc.).  These thresholds can be dynamically adjusted based on system load and available resources.
*   **Data Movement:**
    *   **Promotion:** If a subsequence’s tiering score exceeds a threshold for a higher tier, automatically move the corresponding data to that tier. This movement should be asynchronous and non-blocking.  Employ a write-back cache strategy during the move to minimize latency.
    *   **Demotion:** If a subsequence’s tiering score falls below a threshold for a lower tier, automatically move the corresponding data to that tier.
*   **Subsequence Splitting Integration:**  The existing subsequence splitting logic should be *influenced* by the tiering scores. Subsequences in higher tiers should have a *lower* splitting threshold. This prevents premature splitting of frequently accessed data and optimizes cache hit rates.  Conversely, subsequences in lower tiers can tolerate a higher splitting threshold.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
// Main loop - executed periodically
for each subsequence in tracked_subsequences:
    tiering_score = predict_tiering_score(subsequence.access_logs, subsequence.counter_value)
    current_tier = get_current_tier(subsequence)
    target_tier = determine_target_tier(tiering_score)

    if target_tier != current_tier:
        move_data(subsequence, target_tier)
        update_current_tier(subsequence, target_tier)

    // Adjust split threshold based on tier
    if current_tier == 0:
        split_threshold = low_threshold
    elif current_tier == 1:
        split_threshold = medium_threshold
    else:
        split_threshold = high_threshold

    if subsequence.counter_value > split_threshold:
        split_subsequence(subsequence)
```

**5.  Considerations:**

*   **Cold Starts:** Handling new subsequences with no access history. A default tier and a gradual learning period can mitigate this.
*   **Data Consistency:** Ensuring data consistency during asynchronous tiering. Versioning and write-back caching are essential.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Dynamically allocating resources to each tier based on demand and cost.
*   **Machine Learning Model Retraining:** Regularly retraining the LSTM model with updated access logs to maintain accuracy.
