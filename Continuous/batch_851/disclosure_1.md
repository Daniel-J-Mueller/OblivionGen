## Dynamic Content Complexity Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the data set size variation approach to include not just *how much* data is used, but *how complex* the data is processed *before* being used for content generation. This introduces a second axis of load management – computational complexity.

**Specification:**

**1. Complexity Profiles:**

*   Define a series of 'Complexity Profiles' associated with each data element or category of data. These profiles represent varying levels of pre-processing applied to the data.
    *   **Level 0 (Raw):** Data used directly, minimal pre-processing (e.g., simple filtering).
    *   **Level 1 (Basic):** Moderate pre-processing (e.g., normalization, simple aggregation).
    *   **Level 2 (Advanced):** Complex pre-processing (e.g., feature extraction, machine learning models applied).
    *   **Level 3 (High):** Intensive pre-processing (e.g., full semantic analysis, model training).
*   Each Complexity Profile has an associated ‘Computational Cost’ metric – an estimated measure of CPU cycles, memory usage, and time required for pre-processing.

**2. Load-Aware Complexity Selection:**

*   The Load Regulation System (as described in the original patent) expands to incorporate Complexity Profile selection.
*   In addition to selecting data set size, the system *also* selects the Complexity Profile to apply to the selected data.
*   The selection algorithm prioritizes minimizing the combined cost of data set size *and* computational complexity.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function select_complexity_and_size(load_level, user_score):
  target_cost = calculate_target_cost(load_level) // Determined by system performance targets
  
  best_size = null
  best_complexity = null
  min_cost = infinity
  
  for size in [small, medium, large]:
    for complexity in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
      cost = calculate_data_cost(size) + calculate_complexity_cost(complexity)
      
      if cost <= target_cost and cost < min_cost:
        min_cost = cost
        best_size = size
        best_complexity = complexity
  
  //If no valid combinations were found, scale down both size and complexity until viable
  if best_size == null:
      //Scale down until viable
      
  return best_size, best_complexity
```

**3. Data Pre-processing Pipeline:**

*   A data pre-processing pipeline is established.
*   The pipeline receives raw data.
*   Based on the selected Complexity Profile, the pipeline applies the appropriate pre-processing steps before passing the data to the content generation system.

**4. Dynamic Adaptation:**

*   Continuously monitor the performance of both data pre-processing and content generation.
*   Dynamically adjust Complexity Profiles and data set sizes based on real-time system load and performance metrics.
*   Implement a feedback loop to refine the selection algorithm over time.

**5. User Score Integration:**

*   The ‘user score’ (as mentioned in the patent) can influence both data set size *and* complexity.
    *   High user score = larger data set, higher complexity (for personalized, high-quality content).
    *   Low user score = smaller data set, lower complexity (for faster, basic content).



This system moves beyond simply varying data volume to actively manage the *computational burden* of content generation. It allows for finer-grained control over server load and enables a more responsive and adaptable content delivery system.
