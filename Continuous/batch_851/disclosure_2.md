## Dynamic Workstation Morphing & Projection

**Concept:** Extend the projection system to *physically* reconfigure workstation elements based on task demands, in conjunction with projected visual cues. The system anticipates task needs by observing item flow and worker actions, then autonomously adjusts workstation layout via robotic elements *underneath* the work surface.

**Specs:**

*   **Workstation Surface:** Modular, interlocking hexagonal tiles forming the primary work surface. Tiles have embedded magnets and small linear actuators.
*   **Substrate Layer:** Beneath the tiles, a grid of miniature, independently controlled robotic 'fingers' or actuators. These actuators raise, lower, and rotate individual tiles.
*   **Projection System:** High-resolution, short-throw projectors integrated into the workstation structure, capable of projecting onto the dynamic tile surface.  Must support both visible and potentially infrared/UV light for specialized cues.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Depth cameras (Time-of-Flight or Stereo Vision) for 3D reconstruction of the workstation surface and object detection.
    *   Weight sensors integrated into each tile to determine object weight and distribution.
    *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) on worker wristbands (optional) to track hand movements and gestures.
*   **Control System:** High-performance computing platform with real-time image processing and robotic control capabilities.

**Operation:**

1.  **Task Prediction:** The control system analyzes item flow data, worker actions (via sensors), and pre-programmed task sequences to predict the next required workstation configuration.
2.  **Surface Morphing:** Based on the prediction, the control system activates the robotic actuators beneath the tiles, raising, lowering, or rotating them to create customized support structures, guides, or containment areas.  For example:
    *   Raising tiles to create a temporary cradle for a delicate component.
    *   Lowering tiles to form a channel to guide an item along a specific path.
    *   Rotating tiles to create angled surfaces for ergonomic access.
3.  **Projection Mapping:** Simultaneously, the projection system dynamically adjusts its output to account for the altered surface geometry. Visual cues are projected onto the morphed surface, providing guidance, highlighting areas of interest, or indicating required actions. Projection adapts in real-time to the tile movement.
4.  **Adaptive Feedback:** The system continuously monitors the worker's actions and adjusts the workstation configuration and visual cues accordingly.  If a worker deviates from the expected workflow, the system can provide corrective feedback or suggest alternative solutions.
5.  **Gesture Recognition Integration:** Hand gestures (detected via IMU or cameras) can trigger specific workstation configurations or visual cues, providing hands-free control.

**Pseudocode (Workstation Adaptation Loop):**

```
loop:
  // 1. Acquire Data
  image_data = depth_camera.capture()
  weight_data = tile_weight_sensors.read()
  worker_pose = worker_tracking_system.get_pose() //optional
  task_state = task_scheduler.get_next_state()

  // 2. Analyze Data & Predict Configuration
  predicted_configuration = configuration_predictor(image_data, weight_data, worker_pose, task_state)

  // 3. Calculate Actuator Commands
  actuator_commands = calculate_actuator_commands(predicted_configuration)

  // 4. Execute Actuator Commands
  actuator_system.execute(actuator_commands)

  // 5. Project Visual Cues
  visual_cues = generate_visual_cues(task_state, image_data)
  projector.project(visual_cues)

  // 6.  Wait/Delay
  delay(0.1 seconds)
end loop
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased worker efficiency.
*   Reduced errors.
*   Improved ergonomics.
*   Enhanced flexibility for handling diverse tasks.
*   Automated adaptation to changing production demands.
