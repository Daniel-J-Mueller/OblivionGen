## Adaptive Metric Resolution Based on Predictive Load

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity (resolution) of collected performance metrics *before* data is stored, based on a predictive model of system load. The goal is to minimize storage costs and network bandwidth while maintaining sufficient data for meaningful analysis, particularly during periods of low activity.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Load Model:**
    *   Input: Historical performance data (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network), system events (deployments, scheduled tasks), and potentially external factors (time of day, day of week).
    *   Algorithm:  A time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) trained to predict future system load (defined as a composite metric representing overall system utilization).
    *   Output:  A predicted load score for a specified future time window (e.g., next 5 minutes, next hour).

*   **Component 2: Resolution Controller:**
    *   Input: Predicted load score from the Predictive Load Model, configurable resolution levels (e.g., 1 second, 5 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes), and a hysteresis threshold.
    *   Logic:
        *   High Load (score > threshold): Use the highest resolution setting (e.g., 1 second).
        *   Medium Load (score between thresholds): Use a medium resolution setting (e.g., 5 seconds).
        *   Low Load (score < threshold): Use a low resolution setting (e.g., 1 minute or 5 minutes).  Aggregation performed *before* storage.
        *   Hysteresis: Prevents rapid switching between resolution levels due to minor load fluctuations.
    *   Output:  Configuration parameter specifying the current resolution level.

*   **Component 3: Metric Collection Agent:**
    *   Input: Configuration parameter from the Resolution Controller, list of metrics to collect.
    *   Logic:
        *   Collects metrics at the specified resolution.
        *   If the resolution is greater than 1 second, performs pre-aggregation (e.g., calculating averages, sums, percentiles) over the specified time window *before* sending the data to the storage system.  The agent needs to support configurable aggregation functions.
    *   Output:  Aggregated or raw metric data.

**Pseudocode (Metric Collection Agent):**

```
function collect_metrics(metric_list, resolution, aggregation_function):
  for metric in metric_list:
    data = read_metric_data()
    if resolution > 1:
      aggregated_data = aggregate(data, resolution, aggregation_function)
      send_to_storage(aggregated_data)
    else:
      send_to_storage(data)

function aggregate(data, resolution, aggregation_function):
  # Implement time-windowing and aggregation logic
  # e.g., average, sum, percentile, etc.
  aggregated_data = []
  for i in range(0, len(data), resolution):
    window = data[i:i+resolution]
    aggregated_value = calculate(window, aggregation_function)
    aggregated_data.append(aggregated_value)
  return aggregated_data
```

**Storage Implications:**

*   The storage system doesn't need to be aware of the adaptive resolution. It simply receives aggregated or raw data as configured.
*   Metadata should be stored alongside the data indicating the resolution used for each time window. This is essential for accurate analysis.

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced storage costs: Lower resolution during low-load periods significantly reduces storage requirements.
*   Reduced network bandwidth: Transmitting less data during low-load periods reduces network congestion.
*   Improved analysis efficiency: Storing only the necessary level of detail simplifies data analysis.
*   Scalability: Allows the system to handle larger volumes of performance data without increasing storage or network costs.
