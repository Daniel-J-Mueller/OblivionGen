## Dynamic Product "Mood Boards" & AI-Driven Style Recommendations

**Concept:** Expand beyond customizable *attributes* to offer dynamically generated "mood boards" for products, driven by AI analysis of user preferences and trending styles. These mood boards aren't static images; they're interactive, linking to customizable product options and providing style recommendations.

**Specs:**

**1. Mood Board Generation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Product Category, User Profile (purchase history, browsing data, explicitly stated preferences - color palettes, styles, keywords), Trending Style Data (scraped from social media, fashion blogs, design publications).
*   **Process:**
    *   AI algorithm (e.g., Generative Adversarial Network or diffusion model) generates a visual mood board incorporating colors, textures, patterns, and product imagery relevant to the input data.
    *   Mood board elements are tagged with links to corresponding customizable product options.  For example, a specific fabric swatch in the mood board links to a fabric selection dropdown for a sofa.
    *   Mood boards are generated *on the fly* â€“ not pre-designed.
*   **Output:** Interactive mood board displayed on the product customization page.

**2. Style Recommendation System:**

*   **Process:** AI analyzes user interactions with the mood board (e.g., which elements they click on, how long they hover over them) and provides personalized style recommendations.
*   **Recommendation Types:**
    *   "Complete the Look": Suggests complementary products to go with the customized item.
    *   "Similar Styles": Displays mood boards with similar aesthetic themes.
    *   "Trending Now": Highlights current style trends relevant to the product category.
*   **Integration with Customization:**  Style recommendations directly influence available customization options. For example, if a user interacts with a "Coastal" mood board, the system prioritizes blue and white fabrics, natural wood finishes, and nautical-themed accessories.

**3.  User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX):**

*   **Mood Board Display:** Interactive canvas with draggable/rearrangeable elements. Elements can be swapped out with alternatives.
*   **Style Recommendation Carousel:**  Displays suggested products and mood boards in a visually appealing carousel.
*   **"Mood Match" Algorithm:**  Allows users to upload images (e.g., from Pinterest or Instagram) to generate a mood board based on their desired aesthetic.
*   **Real-time Customization Preview:**  As users interact with the mood board and select customization options, a 3D model or high-fidelity rendering of the product updates in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Mood Board Generation):**

```
function generateMoodBoard(productCategory, userProfile, trendingStyles) {

  // 1. Extract relevant features from userProfile & trendingStyles
  userPreferences = analyze(userProfile); // color palettes, preferred styles, keywords
  currentTrends = analyze(trendingStyles); // trending colors, patterns, materials

  // 2.  Generate base aesthetic using AI (e.g., GAN)
  moodBoardBase = generateAesthetic(userPreferences, currentTrends);

  // 3. Populate mood board with product imagery (from catalog)
  //     Filter products in catalog based on productCategory
  //     Select images based on aesthetic similarity to moodBoardBase
  productImages = selectProductImages(catalog, moodBoardBase);

  // 4. Combine aesthetic elements and product imagery
  moodBoard = combineElements(moodBoardBase, productImages);

  // 5.  Tag elements with links to customizable options
  taggedMoodBoard = tagElements(moodBoard, catalog);

  return taggedMoodBoard;
}
