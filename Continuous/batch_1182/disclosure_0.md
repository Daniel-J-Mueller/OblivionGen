## Dynamic Access Contextualization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Enhance document access security and user experience by incorporating real-time biofeedback data into the authentication and authorization process. This moves beyond static credentials and device attributes to a more dynamic and personalized security layer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Integration:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor:** Integrate support for a range of commercially available biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), facial expression analysis via camera) which connect via Bluetooth or USB to the user's computing device. The system should be agnostic to specific sensor models, utilizing standardized data formats where possible.
*   **Sensor Data Acquisition Module:** A software module responsible for receiving, cleaning, and normalizing sensor data.  This module will handle data streaming from multiple sensors concurrently.
*   **Secure Enclave Communication:** All raw and processed biofeedback data *must* be handled within a secure enclave (e.g., TrustZone, SGX) on the client device to protect user privacy. Only aggregated, derived features are transmitted to the document management system.

**2. Software Components (Client-Side):**

*   **Baseline Calibration:**  Upon initial setup, the system establishes a personalized baseline for each user based on their biofeedback metrics during a period of relaxed activity. This baseline serves as a reference point for anomaly detection.
*   **Contextual Biofeedback Analysis:**  Monitor biofeedback data *during* the document access request.  Analyze data for deviations from the established baseline, and interpret these deviations in relation to the type of document being accessed and the user's stated intent. For example, accessing a highly sensitive financial document should trigger a more rigorous analysis than accessing a public-facing marketing document.
*   **Confidence Score Augmentation:** Integrate the biofeedback analysis result as an additional factor into the existing confidence score calculation (as detailed in the provided patent). Assign a weighting to the biofeedback factor based on the sensitivity of the document and the user's profile.
*   **Adaptive Authentication:** Dynamically adjust the authentication requirements based on the biofeedback analysis. For example, if the analysis indicates high stress or anxiety, the system may prompt for additional authentication factors (e.g., multi-factor authentication) or temporarily restrict access.

**3. Software Components (Server-Side):**

*   **Biofeedback Data Integration Module:**  A secure module responsible for receiving and integrating the biofeedback-derived confidence score from the client device.  This module will validate the data and ensure it meets security requirements.
*   **Policy Engine Enhancement:**  Modify the existing policy engine to incorporate biofeedback-derived confidence scores into access control decisions. Define policies that specify the minimum acceptable confidence score for accessing different types of documents.
*   **Anomaly Detection & Alerting:**  Implement anomaly detection algorithms that monitor biofeedback confidence scores over time.  Alert administrators to suspicious patterns, such as consistently low confidence scores or sudden drops in confidence.

**4. Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function requestDocumentAccess(documentId, credentials) {
  // 1. Gather Biofeedback Data
  bioData = getBiofeedbackData() // Collect HRV, EDA, facial expression data

  // 2. Analyze Biofeedback Data
  baseline = getUserBaseline()
  deviationScore = calculateDeviationScore(bioData, baseline)

  // 3. Calculate Biofeedback Confidence Score
  bioConfidenceScore = mapDeviationScoreToConfidence(deviationScore)

  // 4. Augment Existing Confidence Score
  existingConfidence = calculateExistingConfidence(credentials, deviceAttributes)
  combinedConfidence = (existingConfidence * weightExisting) + (bioConfidenceScore * weightBio)

  // 5. Send Access Request with Combined Confidence
  sendAccessRequest(documentId, credentials, combinedConfidence)
}

function getBiofeedbackData() {
  // Code to acquire data from biofeedback sensors
  // Handle sensor connection, data streaming, and error handling
}

function calculateDeviationScore(bioData, baseline) {
  // Code to compare bioData to baseline and calculate a deviation score
  // Use statistical methods to quantify the difference between current and baseline data
}

function mapDeviationScoreToConfidence(deviationScore) {
  // Code to map deviationScore to a confidence score
  // Use a sigmoid function or other mapping function to scale the score
}
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Data Encryption:** All biofeedback data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
*   **Secure Enclave:**  All sensitive processing must occur within a secure enclave to protect user privacy.
*   **Sensor Spoofing Detection:** Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent sensor spoofing attacks.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Provide users with granular control over their biofeedback data and the ability to opt-out of the system.
