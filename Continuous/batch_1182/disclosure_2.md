## Adaptive Credential Reset Orchestration via Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Enhance security and user experience by dynamically adjusting the credential reset process based on real-time behavioral biometric analysis. The system learns typical user behavior (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, touch pressure, etc.) and uses deviations from this baseline to trigger or modify the credential reset flow.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Engine:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuously monitor user interactions across all devices and applications (web, mobile, desktop) – keystroke dynamics, mouse/touch movements, scrolling behavior, application usage patterns, and timing.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from the raw data – keystroke dwell time, inter-key timing, mouse acceleration, scroll speed variance, application launch sequences, and time spent within applications.
*   **Baseline Establishment:** Establish a personalized behavioral baseline for each user utilizing machine learning (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) – creating a probabilistic model of typical behavior.  The baseline is continually updated to adapt to natural behavioral changes.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Real-time comparison of current user behavior against the established baseline – calculating anomaly scores based on deviations from expected patterns. A threshold dictates sensitivity (false positives vs. security breaches).
*   **Data Storage:** Encrypted storage of behavioral profiles.  Data minimization principles are employed – only essential features are stored. Profiles can be optionally deleted by the user.

**2. Dynamic Credential Reset Flow Orchestration:**

*   **Integration Point:** Intercepts credential reset requests (initiated by user or system).
*   **Behavioral Assessment:** Triggers the Behavioral Profile Engine to assess current user behavior.
*   **Reset Flow Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjusts the complexity and type of credential reset challenges based on the anomaly score:
    *   **Low Anomaly (Normal Behavior):**  Standard email/SMS reset with a temporary password or link.
    *   **Medium Anomaly (Slight Deviation):**  Multi-factor authentication (MFA) via a trusted device, knowledge-based questions (KBQ), or biometric verification (fingerprint, face recognition). Increased scrutiny of the reset request.
    *   **High Anomaly (Significant Deviation):**  Full account lock-down, mandatory in-person verification (e.g., at a physical branch), or escalation to a security analyst. The reset request is automatically flagged for manual review.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns from successful and failed reset attempts – refining the anomaly detection thresholds and reset flow adjustments over time.  Reinforcement learning techniques could be employed to optimize the system’s performance.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assigns a risk score to each reset attempt based on the anomaly score, user profile, and contextual factors (e.g., location, time of day).

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Modular Design:**  The Behavioral Profile Engine and Dynamic Reset Flow Orchestration are implemented as separate microservices.
*   **API Integration:**  Standard APIs for integration with existing identity and access management (IAM) systems and applications.
*   **Scalability:**  Designed to handle high volumes of credential reset requests.
*   **Security:**  End-to-end encryption of all sensitive data.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Reset Flow Orchestration):**

```
function handleCredentialResetRequest(user_id, reset_type):
  anomaly_score = BehavioralProfileEngine.getAnomalyScore(user_id)

  if anomaly_score < low_threshold:
    sendStandardReset(user_id, reset_type)
  elif anomaly_score < medium_threshold:
    triggerMFA(user_id)
    if MFA_successful:
      sendStandardReset(user_id, reset_type)
    else:
      logSuspiciousActivity(user_id)
      escalateToSecurityAnalyst(user_id)
  else:
    logSuspiciousActivity(user_id)
    escalateToSecurityAnalyst(user_id)
    lockAccount(user_id)
```

**Data Flows:**

*   User interaction data -> Behavioral Profile Engine -> Anomaly Score
*   Anomaly Score -> Dynamic Reset Flow Orchestration -> Reset Flow Adjustment
*   Reset Flow Adjustment -> IAM System -> Credential Reset Completion
