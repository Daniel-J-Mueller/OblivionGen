## Autonomous Swarm Negotiation & Task Allocation – ‘Digital Pheromones’

**Concept:** Extend the inter-UAV communication beyond simple message exchange to enable a distributed negotiation system for optimal task allocation within a swarm, utilizing a ‘digital pheromone’ model.

**Specifications:**

**1. Pheromone Emission Module:**

*   **Function:** Each UAV continuously emits ‘digital pheromones’ representing its current task status, resource availability (battery, payload capacity, sensor data type), and estimated task completion time.
*   **Data Structure:** Pheromone data packets contain:
    *   UAV ID
    *   Task ID (if assigned)
    *   Task Priority (1-10, 10 being highest)
    *   Resource Vector (Battery %, Payload Capacity kg, Sensor Types)
    *   Estimated Completion Time (seconds)
    *   Geographic Coordinates (current location)
    *   "Willingness to Negotiate" flag (boolean – indicates openness to task reassignment)
*   **Emission Rate:** Variable, based on task criticality and swarm density. Higher criticality/density = faster emission rate.
*   **Transmission Protocol:**  Short-range, ad-hoc mesh network utilizing a dedicated frequency band to minimize interference.

**2. Pheromone Reception & Analysis Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously scan for and receive pheromone packets from neighboring UAVs.
*   **Filtering:** Implement noise reduction and redundancy filtering to ensure data integrity. Prioritize packets from closer UAVs.
*   **Trust Scoring:** Integrate trust scores (as per the original patent) to assess the reliability of received pheromone data.
*   **"Need" Calculation:** Determine the UAV's own ‘need’ for assistance based on its current task requirements and resource limitations.  This is a vector representing missing resources.
*   **"Offer" Calculation:** Calculate what resources the UAV can offer to other UAVs.

**3. Negotiation Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** Employ a distributed auction-based negotiation algorithm. UAVs ‘bid’ for tasks based on their ability to fulfill them efficiently (minimize completion time, maximize resource utilization).
*   **Bid Calculation:** Bids are weighted based on:
    *   Resource match between UAV 'offer' and task 'need'.
    *   Estimated task completion time.
    *   UAV’s trust score.
    *   Distance to the task location.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a priority system based on task criticality and a tie-breaking mechanism (e.g., UAV with the highest trust score wins).
*   **Task Reassignment:** Once a bid is accepted, the UAV receiving the task updates its internal task list and the original UAV removes the task.  A broadcast message confirms the reassignment.

**4. Dynamic Swarm Formation Module:**

*   **Function:** Facilitate swarm formation and reconfiguration based on task requirements and resource availability.
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft or Paxos) to ensure that all UAVs agree on the swarm structure.
*   **Roles:** Assign roles to UAVs within the swarm (e.g., leader, scout, worker) based on their capabilities and task requirements.

**Pseudocode (Negotiation Engine – simplified):**

```
// UAV A receives task T
calculate_need(T)
broadcast_need(T)

while (task_not_assigned) {
  receive_offers()
  best_offer = find_best_offer(offers) // Based on resource match, completion time, trust
  if (best_offer != null) {
    accept_offer(best_offer)
    broadcast_task_assigned(best_offer.UAV_ID)
    task_not_assigned = false
  }
  if (timeout) {
    // escalate to swarm leader
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Search and Rescue: Optimize coverage and resource allocation in disaster areas.
*   Precision Agriculture: Adaptively allocate UAVs to monitor crop health and apply treatments.
*   Environmental Monitoring: Dynamically adjust swarm formation to track pollution plumes or wildlife movements.
