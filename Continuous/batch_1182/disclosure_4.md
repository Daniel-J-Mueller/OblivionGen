## Dynamic Haptic Character Sculpting

**Concept:** Expand the multi-directional input system beyond visual highlighting to include dynamic haptic feedback that 'sculpts' the character being selected, providing a tactile representation of the character's shape. This aims to accelerate character selection and reduce cognitive load.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-directional input device with integrated micro-actuators capable of localized force feedback. The display surface is overlaid with a thin, flexible haptic layer (e.g., piezoelectric polymers or electroactive materials).
*   **Software – Character Data:** Each character (letter, number, symbol) is associated with a 3D “shape profile” stored in a database. This profile defines the force distribution required to ‘form’ the character on the haptic layer. This isn't necessarily a detailed model, but rather a set of force vectors that define key features (e.g., the loop in a 'b', the vertical line of a 'l').
*   **Software – Input Processing:**
    *   Upon receiving a directional swipe, the system identifies the associated character group as in the original patent.
    *   The system loads the 3D shape profile for the *potential* character corresponding to the identified angle.
    *   As the user continues to move the input device (even slightly), the system dynamically updates the force applied to the haptic layer, ‘building’ the character’s shape under the user’s finger. This will be driven by a physics engine.
    *   The system tracks swipe magnitude *and* velocity. These contribute to the ‘depth’ or ‘strength’ of the haptic shape. A faster, longer swipe could create a more pronounced, easily distinguishable shape.
*   **Software – Selection Confirmation:**
    *   A ‘tap’ or ‘hold’ on the input device confirms the sculpted character.
    *   Alternatively, the system can detect a deliberate ‘tracing’ action that completes the character’s shape (e.g., completing the loop in a 'b').
*   **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function SculptCharacter(swipeAngle, swipeMagnitude, swipeVelocity):
    characterGroup = GetCharacterGroup(swipeAngle)
    character = characterGroup[0] // Initial character candidate
    characterShape = LoadCharacterShape(character)
    
    // Physics Engine – Update haptic force based on shape and input
    for each point in characterShape:
        force = CalculateHapticForce(point, swipeMagnitude, swipeVelocity)
        ApplyForceToHapticLayer(point, force)
    
    // Selection confirmation
    if userTap():
        SendCharacterToTextEntry()
    else if userTraceCompletedShape():
        SendCharacterToTextEntry()
```

*   **Variations:**
    *   **Character Complexity Levels:** Allow the user to select a ‘complexity’ level for haptic feedback. This would simplify or detail the character shape to suit individual preferences or disabilities.
    *   **Multi-Layer Haptics:** Use multiple layers of haptic actuators to create more nuanced and detailed shapes.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:** The system could learn user preferences and adapt the haptic shapes accordingly.
