## Dynamic N-gram Weighting Based on Contextual Embedding Similarity

**Concept:** Enhance language prediction accuracy by dynamically weighting n-grams based on the semantic similarity between the contextual embedding of the n-gram within the sample text and the contextual embedding of the same n-gram within the language reference corpora.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

1.  **Contextual Embedding Model:** Utilize a pre-trained language model (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) to generate contextual embeddings for each n-gram encountered in both the sample text and the language reference corpora.  The model should be capable of producing embeddings representing the meaning of the n-gram *in its surrounding context*.

2.  **N-gram Frequency Database:** A database storing n-gram frequencies within each language reference (as in the original patent). This remains a core component.

3.  **Similarity Metric:** Implement a similarity metric (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) to quantify the semantic similarity between the contextual embedding of a sample n-gram and its corresponding embeddings in the language reference corpora.

4.  **Dynamic Weighting Function:** A function that calculates a dynamic weight for each n-gram based on its similarity score.  Higher similarity scores translate to higher weights, emphasizing n-grams that are semantically consistent across languages.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Sample Text Processing:**
    *   Identify all n-grams within the sample text.
    *   Generate contextual embeddings for each n-gram using the pre-trained language model.

2.  **Language Reference Processing (Pre-computation):**
    *   For each language reference:
        *   Identify all n-grams.
        *   Generate contextual embeddings for each n-gram.
        *   Store the n-gram, its frequency, and its contextual embedding in the database.

3.  **Language Prediction:**
    *   For each language reference:
        *   Initialize a language score to zero.
        *   For each sample n-gram:
            *   Retrieve the corresponding n-gram embeddings from the database for the current language reference.
            *   Calculate the similarity score between the sample n-gram embedding and the retrieved language reference n-gram embeddings.
            *   Calculate a weighted probability contribution: `Probability = Frequency * SimilarityScore`.
            *   Add the weighted probability to the language score.
        *   Normalize the language score to obtain a probability for the language.

4.  **Language Determination:**
    *   Compare the probabilities for all languages.
    *   Select the language with the highest probability as the predicted language.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
// Pre-compute embeddings for language references
FOR EACH language IN language_references:
    FOR EACH n_gram IN language.n_grams:
        n_gram.embedding = generate_embedding(n_gram.text) // Using pre-trained model
        store_in_database(language, n_gram.text, n_gram.frequency, n_gram.embedding)

// Language prediction for sample text
FUNCTION predict_language(sample_text):
    sample_n_grams = extract_n_grams(sample_text)
    language_scores = {}

    FOR EACH language IN language_references:
        score = 0
        FOR EACH sample_n_gram IN sample_n_grams:
            retrieved_n_grams = retrieve_n_grams_from_database(language, sample_n_gram.text)
            IF retrieved_n_grams:
                similarity_score = calculate_cosine_similarity(sample_n_gram.embedding, retrieved_n_grams.embedding)
                weighted_probability = retrieved_n_grams.frequency * similarity_score
                score += weighted_probability
            ELSE:
                score += 0 // Penalize unseen n-grams?
        language_scores[language] = score

    predicted_language = argmax(language_scores)
    RETURN predicted_language
```

**IV. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Adaptive Embedding Model:** Fine-tune the pre-trained language model on a corpus of multilingual text to improve the quality of the embeddings.
*   **Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning:** Explore techniques to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages.
*   **Contextual Windowing:**  Consider the broader context surrounding the n-gram when calculating the similarity score.
*    **Dynamic N-gram Size:** Algorithmically determine the optimal n-gram size based on the characteristics of the input text.
