## Dynamic Precision Weighting & Activation

**Concept:** Leverage variable precision for weights and activations *during* inference, adapting to the sensitivity of each node in the neural network. This minimizes computational load and power consumption without sacrificing accuracy.

**Specs:**

*   **Weight Encoding:** Weights are initially stored in a high-precision format (e.g., FP32). A pre-inference analysis phase (calibration) determines the minimum precision needed for each weight *without* impacting the networkâ€™s output. Weights are then quantized to this determined precision (e.g., FP16, INT8, or even lower).
*   **Activation Encoding:**  Activations are dynamically adjusted in precision. Each node tracks its gradient magnitude during a small calibration run. Nodes with low gradient magnitudes (indicating low sensitivity) have their activations reduced to lower precision formats (e.g., INT4). Nodes with high gradient magnitudes retain higher precision (e.g., FP16).
*   **Hardware Implementation:**
    *   **Precision Control Units (PCUs):** Dedicated hardware units associated with each node.  PCUs monitor gradient magnitude (or a proxy, like the variance of activation values) and control the precision of activation values.
    *   **Dynamic Quantization/Dequantization:**  PCUs contain fast quantization and dequantization circuits for activations, operating on-the-fly.
    *   **Mixed-Precision Arithmetic Units:**  Arithmetic units capable of handling multiple precision formats simultaneously.  This avoids performance bottlenecks from format conversions.
    *   **Weight Storage:**  Weights are stored in a hierarchical memory system.  Frequently accessed weights (high-precision) are cached in faster memory. Lower-precision weights reside in slower, denser memory.
*   **Calibration Phase:**
    1.  Run a small representative dataset through the network.
    2.  For each weight, record the range of values it produces in the output of its node.
    3.  Determine the minimum number of bits required to represent this range without significant quantization error.
    4.  For each node, measure the variance (or gradient magnitude) of its activations.  This serves as a sensitivity metric.

**Pseudocode (Node Processing):**

```
function process_node(inputs, weights):
  // 1. Load Weights (potentially from hierarchical memory)
  weights = load_weights(weights)

  // 2. Dynamic Activation Precision
  activation_precision = determine_activation_precision(node_sensitivity) //Based on pre-calculated or runtime sensitivity

  // 3. Quantize Inputs (based on activation_precision)
  quantized_inputs = quantize(inputs, activation_precision)

  // 4. Compute Dot Product (mixed-precision arithmetic)
  dot_product = mixed_precision_dot_product(quantized_inputs, weights)

  // 5. Dequantize Dot Product (if necessary)
  dequantized_dot_product = dequantize(dot_product, activation_precision)

  // 6. Apply Activation Function
  output = activation_function(dequantized_dot_product)

  return output
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant reduction in computational complexity and power consumption.
*   Minimal impact on network accuracy (if implemented carefully).
*   Adaptability to different network architectures and datasets.
