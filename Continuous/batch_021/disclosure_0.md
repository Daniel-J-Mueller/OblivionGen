## Dynamic Query Shaping with Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically alters database query construction based on real-time behavioral biometrics of the user initiating the request. This extends the existing concept of limiting queries to single results by adding a layer of continuous authentication *during* query construction, not just at the initial login.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Sensor Suite:** Captures data points like keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns, scroll speed, and typing cadence.  This can be client-side (browser-based) or integrated within dedicated hardware.
*   **Biometric Profile Database:** Stores established behavioral profiles for each user. These are built through an initial learning phase and continuously updated.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:**  Compares real-time behavioral data to the user's established profile.  Generates an "authenticity score" reflecting the likelihood the current user is the legitimate account holder.
*   **Query Shaper:**  A component intercepting database queries *before* they are sent.  It modifies query parameters based on the authenticity score.

**Operation:**

1.  **Continuous Authentication:** The Behavioral Sensor Suite continuously collects biometric data during user interaction.
2.  **Authenticity Score Calculation:** The Anomaly Detection Engine calculates an authenticity score.
3.  **Query Interception:** Before a query reaches the database, the Query Shaper intercepts it.
4.  **Dynamic Query Modification:**
    *   **High Authenticity (e.g., > 0.9):**  The query proceeds as normal, potentially with relaxed constraints (e.g., allowing more complex queries where appropriate).
    *   **Medium Authenticity (e.g., 0.6-0.9):**  The Query Shaper modifies the query to prioritize speed and simplicity. This could involve adding index hints, simplifying complex joins, or limiting the number of returned fields.
    *   **Low Authenticity (e.g., < 0.6):** The Query Shaper drastically simplifies the query, potentially reducing it to a lookup by a primary key or requiring multi-factor authentication before proceeding. It could also inject “noise” into the query parameters to obfuscate intent.
5.  **Query Execution:** The modified query is sent to the database.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** Query execution time and database load are monitored and fed back into the Anomaly Detection Engine to refine the behavioral model and improve accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Query Shaper):**

```
function shapeQuery(query, authenticityScore) {
  if (authenticityScore > 0.9) {
    return query; // No modification
  } else if (authenticityScore >= 0.6) {
    // Add index hints, simplify joins, reduce fields
    modifiedQuery = addIndexHint(query, "user_id");
    modifiedQuery = simplifyJoins(modifiedQuery);
    modifiedQuery = reduceFields(modifiedQuery, ["id", "username", "email"]);
    return modifiedQuery;
  } else {
    // Simplify to primary key lookup
    primaryKey = getPrimaryKey(query);
    modifiedQuery = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = " + primaryKey;
    return modifiedQuery;
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security by adding a continuous authentication layer.
*   Adaptive performance based on user behavior.
*   Proactive detection of potential attacks or compromised accounts.
*   Dynamic optimization of database queries based on real-time conditions.
