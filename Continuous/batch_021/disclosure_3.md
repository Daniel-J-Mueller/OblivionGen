## Dynamic Feature Bundling & Tiered Allotment

**Concept:** Instead of individual feature allotment, bundle features into tiers with dynamically adjusted allotment based on conference context and participant roles.

**Specification:**

**1. Tier Definition:**

*   Define feature tiers (e.g., "Basic", "Enhanced", "Premium").
*   Each tier comprises a set of features (noise suppression, background blur, etc.).
*   Tier assignment is configurable server-side.

**2. Role-Based Tier Assignment:**

*   Participants are assigned roles (e.g., "Presenter", "Moderator", "Attendee").
*   Each role is mapped to a specific tier.  Moderators/Presenters receive higher tiers.
*   Tier assignment is done during conference join.

**3. Contextual Allotment Adjustment:**

*   Server monitors conference characteristics:
    *   Number of active video streams
    *   Bandwidth usage
    *   CPU load on server
*   Based on these metrics, the server *dynamically* adjusts allotment for each tier:
    *   High load -> Reduced allotment across all tiers.
    *   Low load -> Increased allotment.
*   Allotment adjustments happen periodically (e.g., every 30 seconds) and are communicated to clients.

**4. Client-Side Implementation:**

*   Client receives tier assignment and initial allotment during join.
*   Client receives periodic allotment updates from server.
*   Client manages feature activation/deactivation based on tier and remaining allotment.
*   Client can request additional allotment, but server prioritizes requests based on role and overall conference load.

**5. Allotment Granularity:**

*   Instead of a single allotment for the entire tier, use granular allotments per *category* of features within the tier (e.g., audio processing, video effects).
*   This allows for more precise control and prevents one resource-intensive feature from exhausting the entire tier allotment.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// On Conference Join:
tier = receiveTierAssignmentFromServer()
allotment = receiveAllotmentFromServer()
activeFeatures = []

// Periodic Update (every 30 seconds):
newAllotment = receiveAllotmentUpdateFromServer()
allotment = newAllotment

// Feature Activation/Deactivation:
function activateFeature(featureName):
  if featureName in activeFeatures:
    return

  if allotment > 0:
    activeFeatures.append(featureName)
    decrementAllotment(featureName)
  else:
    //Notify user feature unavailable
    return

function decrementAllotment(featureName):
  //Based on feature, decrement appropriate allotment category.
  //(e.g. Audio/Video/Effects)
  allotment -= featureCost[featureName]

//Feature request:
if featureRequest():
  activateFeature(feature)
```

**Rationale:** This approach moves beyond individual feature metering towards a more dynamic and adaptive system. By tying allotment to conference context and participant roles, it ensures a better user experience and more efficient resource allocation. The granular allotment system allows for finer-grained control and prevents resource exhaustion. This provides an opportunity to design a system that adapts to the real-time demands of a media conference, rather than simply limiting feature usage based on predefined allotments.
