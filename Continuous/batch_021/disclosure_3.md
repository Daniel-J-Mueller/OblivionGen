## Dynamic Proxy Reputation & Tiered Access

**Concept:** Expand the proxy system to incorporate a reputation score and tiered access levels. This isn’t simply about verifying *if* a proxy is active, but *how trustworthy* it is, and granting/restricting communication privileges accordingly.

**Specification:**

**1. Reputation Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Communication history associated with the proxy (volume, frequency, content analysis – flagging potentially malicious/fraudulent patterns).
    *   User reports/flags associated with communication originating through the proxy.
    *   External threat intelligence feeds (blacklists, known spam sources).
    *   Validation of sender information against known databases/authorities.
*   **Scoring:**
    *   A weighted scoring algorithm calculates a reputation score (0-100) for each proxy.
    *   Weights assigned to each data source adjustable via admin panel.
    *   Score decay mechanism to prevent static high scores for infrequently used proxies.
*   **Tier Assignment:**
    *   Based on reputation score, proxies assigned to tiers:
        *   Tier 1 (90-100): Highest trust, unrestricted communication.
        *   Tier 2 (70-89): Standard trust, default communication.
        *   Tier 3 (50-69): Reduced trust, limited communication features (e.g., no URL rendering, attachment size restrictions).
        *   Tier 4 (0-49): Low trust, communication blocked/flagged for review.

**2. Tiered Communication Controls:**

*   **Sender Tier:** When a communication originates *from* a sender using a proxy, the system determines the sender’s proxy tier.
*   **Recipient Tier:** The system also determines the recipient’s proxy tier.
*   **Policy Engine:** Based on the sender/recipient tier combination, a policy engine applies communication controls:
    *   **Tier 1 <-> Tier 1:** Unrestricted communication.
    *   **Tier 1 <-> Tier 2:** Standard communication.
    *   **Tier 1 <-> Tier 3:** Limited features (e.g., no URL rendering, reduced attachment size).
    *   **Tier 1 <-> Tier 4:** Communication blocked.
    *   **Tier 3 <-> Tier 4:** Communication blocked.
*   **Dynamic Adjustments:**  The policy engine can dynamically adjust communication controls based on real-time risk assessments (e.g., flagging communications with suspicious content).

**3. System Architecture & Pseudocode:**

```
// Communication Interception
InterceptCommunication(message) {
  senderProxy = message.senderProxy
  recipientProxy = message.recipientProxy

  senderTier = GetProxyTier(senderProxy)
  recipientTier = GetProxyTier(recipientProxy)

  ApplyCommunicationPolicies(senderTier, recipientTier, message)

  TransmitMessage(message)
}

// Get Proxy Tier
GetProxyTier(proxyAddress) {
  reputationScore = ReputationEngine.CalculateReputation(proxyAddress)
  //Tier assignment logic based on score (0-100)
  if (reputationScore >= 90) {
      return "Tier 1"
  } else if (reputationScore >= 70) {
      return "Tier 2"
  } else if (reputationScore >= 50) {
      return "Tier 3"
  } else {
      return "Tier 4"
  }
}

// Apply Communication Policies
ApplyCommunicationPolicies(senderTier, recipientTier, message) {
  //Policy Logic (example)
  if (senderTier == "Tier 3" && recipientTier == "Tier 1") {
    message.disableURLRendering = true;
    message.maxAttachmentSize = 1MB;
  }
  if (senderTier == "Tier 4" || recipientTier == "Tier 4") {
    message.blockCommunication = true;
  }
}
```

**4.  Admin Interface:**

*   Dashboard displaying overall proxy health and distribution across tiers.
*   Detailed proxy information (reputation score, communication history, associated users).
*   Policy configuration (adjusting tier access levels, setting communication restrictions).
*   Real-time monitoring of flagged communications.
