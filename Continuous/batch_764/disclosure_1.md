## Adaptive Lock Screen 'Mood' Display

**Concept:** Extend the lock screen countdown timer functionality by dynamically altering the *visual style* and *content emphasis* of the lock screen based on user activity *prior* to locking the device, and integrating with external data sources (weather, calendar). The core idea is to create a more engaging and personalized lock screen experience beyond simple recommendations.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   **App Usage History:** Track the last 3-5 apps used before device lock. Categorize apps (e.g., Productivity, Entertainment, Communication, Navigation).
    *   **Calendar Integration:** Access upcoming appointments/events.
    *   **Location Data (Optional):** Current location for weather/local event data.
    *   **Time of Day:**  (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
*   **'Mood' Profiles:** Define pre-set visual/content profiles. Examples:
    *   **'Productivity' Mood:** Dark theme, prominent calendar appointments, quick access to note-taking app. Countdown timer color: Blue. Recommended content: Work-related news snippets.
    *   **'Entertainment' Mood:** Vibrant colors, display recently played music/video, access to streaming apps. Countdown timer color: Pink/Purple. Recommended content: Trending entertainment news.
    *   **'Communication' Mood:** Emphasis on messaging/social media apps, display unread message count. Countdown timer color: Green. Recommended content:  Recent social media updates.
    *   **'Travel' Mood:** Map view with current location/destination (if navigation app was last used), weather information. Countdown timer color: Orange. Recommended content: Traffic updates/local attractions.
    *   **'Relaxation' Mood:** Calm colors, display nature imagery, access to meditation/music apps. Countdown timer color: Lavender. Recommended content:  Positive affirmations/mindfulness exercises.
*   **Dynamic Mood Selection Algorithm:**
    1.  Analyze app usage history.  Assign weights to each app category (e.g., Productivity = 3, Entertainment = 2, Communication = 1).
    2.  Calculate a weighted score based on the last 3-5 apps used.
    3.  Consider calendar events: If an upcoming appointment is labeled 'Important', boost the 'Productivity' score.
    4.  Factor in time of day: Prioritize 'Relaxation' mood in the evening, 'Productivity' in the morning.
    5.  Select the mood profile with the highest score.
*   **Lock Screen Display:**
    *   Apply visual theme (colors, fonts, imagery) of the selected mood profile.
    *   Display relevant content (calendar appointments, unread messages, etc.).
    *   Integrate the countdown timer seamlessly into the visual theme.
    *   Recommended content should be relevant to the selected mood.
*   **User Customization:**
    *   Allow users to override the automatic mood selection.
    *   Provide options to customize the visual themes.
    *   Enable/disable data sources (calendar, location, etc.).

**Pseudocode (Mood Selection):**

```
function selectMood(appHistory, calendarEvents, timeOfDay):
  moodScores = {
    "Productivity": 0,
    "Entertainment": 0,
    "Communication": 0,
    "Travel": 0,
    "Relaxation": 0
  }

  for app in appHistory:
    if app.category == "Productivity":
      moodScores["Productivity"] += 3
    elif app.category == "Entertainment":
      moodScores["Entertainment"] += 2
    elif app.category == "Communication":
      moodScores["Communication"] += 1

  if calendarEvents.hasImportantEvent():
    moodScores["Productivity"] += 2

  if timeOfDay == "Evening":
    moodScores["Relaxation"] += 1

  bestMood = max(moodScores, key=moodScores.get)

  return bestMood
```

This system creates a more engaging and helpful lock screen experience by dynamically adapting to the user's context and preferences. It moves beyond simple recommendations to offer a personalized and immersive experience.
