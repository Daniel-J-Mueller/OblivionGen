## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping with Directional Beamforming & AI-Driven Environmental Profiling

**Concept:** Augment the autonomously motile device with a multi-microphone array *not* solely for noise suppression, but to *actively map* the acoustic environment, building a 3D profile of sound sources & reflections. This profile informs a dynamic beamforming algorithm, optimizing signal capture and noise rejection beyond simple masking. Furthermore, integrate AI to *predict* acoustic behavior based on environment type (office, street, concert hall) and device movement, pre-adjusting beamforming parameters.

**Hardware Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum 8-element array, strategically placed for 360° coverage. High sensitivity, low noise floor microphones required.  Spacing optimized for frequencies relevant to speech (300Hz – 3kHz).
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) for real-time signal processing. Minimum 1 GHz clock speed. Capable of performing FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms) and beamforming calculations.
*   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** 6-axis IMU (accelerometer & gyroscope) to track device orientation & movement. High precision required for accurate beamforming.
*   **Environmental Sensors:**  Basic sensors (light, temperature, humidity) to provide contextual data for AI model.
*   **Memory:** 8GB RAM for data buffering and AI model storage.

**Software/Algorithm Specs:**

1.  **Acoustic Mapping Module:**
    *   Utilize Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Angle of Arrival (AOA) algorithms to identify sound source locations.
    *   Generate a 3D point cloud representation of the acoustic environment.
    *   Update the point cloud in real-time based on sensor data & ongoing analysis.
2.  **Dynamic Beamforming Module:**
    *   Utilize a Delay-and-Sum beamforming algorithm.
    *   Calculate beamforming weights based on acoustic map data and device orientation.
    *   Adapt beamforming direction and focus in real-time to maximize signal capture from the desired source.
3.  **AI-Driven Environmental Profiling Module:**
    *   Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset of acoustic environments (labeled with environment types).
    *   Input:  Sensor data (light, temperature, humidity), IMU data (movement), and acoustic map data.
    *   Output: Predicted environment type and optimal beamforming parameters (beam width, direction, focus).
4.  **Noise Suppression Module:** (integrates with existing tech)
    *   Apply the learned mask data to the cleaned audio signal.
    *   Adaptive thresholding based on the acoustic environment (e.g., more aggressive masking in noisy environments).

**Pseudocode – AI Environmental Profiling**

```
FUNCTION predict_environment(sensor_data, imu_data, acoustic_map)

  // Preprocess data
  processed_sensor_data = normalize(sensor_data)
  processed_imu_data = smooth(imu_data)
  processed_acoustic_map = downsample(acoustic_map)

  // Concatenate features
  features = concatenate(processed_sensor_data, processed_imu_data, processed_acoustic_map)

  // Forward pass through CNN
  output = CNN(features)

  // Softmax to get probability distribution over environment types
  probabilities = softmax(output)

  // Get the most likely environment type
  predicted_environment = argmax(probabilities)

  // Look up optimal beamforming parameters for the predicted environment
  beamforming_parameters = lookup_table(predicted_environment)

  RETURN beamforming_parameters
END FUNCTION
```

**Further Enhancements:**

*   **Sound Event Detection:** Integrate sound event detection algorithms to identify and locate specific sounds (e.g., sirens, speech, music).
*   **Acoustic Holography:** Utilize acoustic holography techniques to reconstruct the sound field and improve noise suppression.
*   **Multi-Device Collaboration:** Enable multiple motile devices to collaborate and create a shared acoustic map of a larger environment.
