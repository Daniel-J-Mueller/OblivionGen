## Predictive Sender Segmentation & Dynamic Content Injection

**Concept:** Extend deliverability prediction beyond broad mailbox provider assessments to *individual sender* level risk & dynamically adjust content to mitigate predicted issues *before* transmission. This moves from reactive deliverability management to proactive content optimization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sender Risk Profile Generation:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical message status data (as per the base patent).
    *   Sender reputation scores (existing, but enhanced – see section 3).
    *   Content analysis: Natural Language Processing (NLP) on email subject lines & body text. Identify keywords/phrases commonly flagged by spam filters (e.g., financial terms, urgent requests, excessive capitalization).
    *   Link analysis: Identify URLs within emails and assess their reputation (blacklist checks, domain age, association with known malicious sites).
    *   Engagement metrics: Open rates, click-through rates, bounce rates, unsubscribe rates – segmented by recipient.
*   **Risk Scoring:** A weighted scoring system combining the above factors. Weights are dynamically adjusted via machine learning based on observed deliverability outcomes.  Scoring bands: Low, Medium, High, Critical.
*   **Segmentation:**  Senders are categorized based on their Risk Score and content characteristics.

**2. Dynamic Content Injection Engine:**

*   **Rules Engine:**  A set of predefined rules triggered by sender segmentation and predicted deliverability risk. Examples:
    *   *High Risk, Financial Keywords:* Automatically insert a disclaimer stating "This email is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice."
    *   *Medium Risk, URL Shortener Used:* Expand the short URL to its full, canonical form.
    *   *Critical Risk, Recipient History of Marking as Spam:*  Add a personalized note acknowledging the recipient’s previous feedback and offering an easy unsubscribe option.
    *   *High Risk, Excessive Use of Exclamation Points:* Reduce the number of exclamation points.
*   **A/B Testing:**  The system automatically A/B tests different content injection strategies to optimize deliverability and engagement.
*   **Content Library:**  A repository of pre-approved content snippets that can be dynamically injected into emails.

**3. Enhanced Sender Reputation Scoring:**

*   **Granular Scoring:**  Move beyond a single sender reputation score to a multi-dimensional score incorporating:
    *   *Content Quality Score:* Based on NLP analysis (spaminess, readability).
    *   *Link Reputation Score:*  Based on link analysis.
    *   *Engagement Score:* Based on recipient engagement metrics.
    *   *Deliverability Score:* Based on historical deliverability performance.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:**  The sender reputation score is updated in real-time based on recipient feedback (opens, clicks, bounces, spam reports).
*   **Attribution Model:**  Develop a model to attribute deliverability issues to specific content elements or sender behavior.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Content Injection):**

```
FUNCTION InjectContent(email, sender, recipient)
    senderRiskScore = GetSenderRiskScore(sender)
    emailContent = GetEmailContent(email)

    IF senderRiskScore == "High" AND ContainsSpamKeywords(emailContent) THEN
        emailContent = AddDisclaimer(emailContent)
    ENDIF

    IF senderRiskScore == "Critical" AND RecipientHasMarkedAsSpam(sender, recipient) THEN
        emailContent = AddUnsubscribeNotice(emailContent)
    ENDIF

    // Expand short URLs
    expandedUrls = ExpandShortUrls(emailContent)
    emailContent = ReplaceShortUrlsWithExpandedUrls(emailContent, expandedUrls)

    RETURN emailContent
END FUNCTION

```

**System Architecture:**

*   **Integration with Existing Email Delivery Module:** Seamless integration with the existing email delivery infrastructure.
*   **Real-time Data Processing:**  Low-latency data processing to enable real-time content injection and sender reputation scoring.
*   **Machine Learning Pipeline:**  Automated machine learning pipeline for training and updating risk models.
*   **API Access:**  API access for third-party integration and customization.
