## Dynamic Scene Graph Integration for Interactive Live Streams

**Concept:** Extend the interactive live stream experience by not just linking products to *discussion* of them, but to *visual instances* of them *within* the live video feed itself. This moves beyond simple product placement/tagging towards a dynamically updated 3D or 2.5D scene graph representing the live environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Scene Graph Generation:**
    *   A dedicated "Scene Understanding" module analyzes the live video stream in real-time. This module utilizes object detection, semantic segmentation, and potentially depth estimation (from stereo cameras or algorithms) to construct a scene graph.
    *   The scene graph represents objects, their positions, orientations, and relationships within the video frame.  Example node types: `Object(id, type, position, rotation, scale)`, `Relationship(subject_id, predicate, object_id)`.  Predicates: `is_part_of`, `near`, `occludes`.
    *   A key aspect is *temporal consistency*. Object tracking algorithms (Kalman filters, deep SORT) maintain object IDs across frames, ensuring a stable scene graph over time.

*   **Interactive Element Binding:**
    *   The system allows producers to *bind* interactive elements (e.g., product info panels, AR overlays, direct purchase links) to specific nodes within the scene graph.  This binding is done via a dedicated UI.
    *   Binding can be done manually (producer clicks on an object in a preview and associates an element) or automatically (based on object type and semantic understanding).

*   **Client-Side Rendering & Interaction:**
    *   Clients receive, alongside the video stream and manifest, *sparse* updates to the scene graph.  Full scene graph transmission is impractical. Updates are delta-encoded to minimize bandwidth.
    *   The client reconstructs a limited portion of the scene graph around the user's focus (potentially guided by eye-tracking or mouse position).
    *   When a user clicks or interacts with a portion of the video frame, the client checks if the corresponding region contains a bound interactive element. If so, the interaction is triggered.
    *   AR overlays are rendered in 3D space, aligned with the tracked objects in the scene.

*   **Manifest Extension:**
    *   The manifest is extended to include:
        *   Metadata describing the supported scene graph format and update frequency.
        *   URLs for retrieving scene graph updates.
        *   A schema defining the data structure of the scene graph nodes and relationships.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Interaction):**

```
function handleUserInteraction(x, y):
  sceneGraph = getCurrentSceneGraph()
  for node in sceneGraph.nodes:
    if node.bounds.contains(x, y):
      if node.interactiveElement != null:
        triggerInteraction(node.interactiveElement)
        return
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Driven Scene Graph Completion:** Use generative AI models to *fill in* missing information in the scene graph, improving the robustness of the system.
*   **Multi-View Support:**  Synchronize scene graphs from multiple camera angles to enable truly immersive interactions.
*   **Real-Time 3D Modeling:**  Allow producers to create or modify 3D models of objects in the scene in real-time, enhancing the AR experience.
*   **Personalized Interactions:** Tailor the interactive elements based on user preferences and viewing history.
