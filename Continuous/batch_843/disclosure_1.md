## Adaptive Directory Federation via Predictive Authentication

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to proactively federate directories and pre-authenticate users *before* a request is even made, based on predicted access patterns. This minimizes latency and improves security by leveraging machine learning.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Access Modeling Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Logs of all API requests (access tokens, directories accessed, operations performed), user profiles (roles, groups, attributes), contextual data (time of day, location, device type), and historical access patterns.
*   **ML Algorithm:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – is preferred due to its ability to model sequential data and identify long-term dependencies.
*   **Output:**  A probabilistic model predicting the likelihood of a user accessing specific directories and performing specific operations within a defined time window.  Output is a vector containing probabilities for each directory/operation pair.
*   **Training:** The model will be continuously retrained with new data in near real-time.
*   **API:** `PredictAccess(userID, timestamp)` returns a probability vector.

**2. Proactive Federation Manager:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the output of the Predictive Access Modeling Module.
*   **Thresholds:**  Configurable thresholds for probability scores to trigger proactive federation.
*   **Federation Initiation:** When a probability score exceeds a threshold for a directory *not currently* federated, the Proactive Federation Manager initiates a federation handshake with that directory. This handshake establishes a secure connection and pre-loads relevant user data (e.g., group memberships, permissions).
*   **Pre-Authentication:** During federation, pre-authentication tokens are generated and exchanged, allowing the system to validate access *before* a request arrives.
*   **Cache:** Maintain a cache of pre-authenticated tokens and federated directory connections for rapid access.

**3. Modified API Gateway:**

*   **Intercept:** All incoming API requests are intercepted.
*   **Pre-Authentication Check:** Before translating the request, the API Gateway checks if the user is pre-authenticated for the target directory.
*   **Bypass:** If pre-authenticated, the request bypasses the normal authentication process, reducing latency.
*   **Fallback:** If not pre-authenticated, the request proceeds through the standard authentication flow.

**4.  Directory Agent Enhancement:**

*   **Federation Handshake Support:**  The Directory Agent must support a new handshake protocol for proactive federation.
*   **Pre-Authentication Token Validation:** The Agent must be able to validate pre-authentication tokens.
*   **Reporting:**  Provide feedback to the Proactive Federation Manager regarding federation success/failure rates and pre-authentication validation success/failure rates.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Federation Manager):**

```
function MonitorAccessPredictions() {
  while (true) {
    for each user in ActiveUsers {
      prediction = PredictiveAccessModel.PredictAccess(user.ID, CurrentTimestamp);
      for each directory in Directories {
        probability = prediction[directory];
        if (probability > FederationThreshold and not IsFederated(directory)) {
          InitiateFederation(directory);
        }
      }
    }
    sleep(FederationCheckInterval); // e.g., 5 seconds
  }
}

function InitiateFederation(directory) {
  try {
    FederationResult = DirectoryAgent.EstablishFederation(directory);
    if (FederationResult == Success) {
      Log("Federation established with " + directory);
      CacheFederation(directory);
    } else {
      Log("Federation failed with " + directory + ": " + FederationResult);
    }
  } catch (exception) {
    Log("Error initiating federation with " + directory + ": " + exception);
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced Latency: Eliminates the need for authentication on every request.
*   Improved Security: Pre-authentication reduces the attack surface.
*   Scalability: Proactive federation offloads authentication processing.
*   Enhanced User Experience: Faster access to resources.
