**Dynamic Key Weaving with Temporal Drift**

**Concept:** Extend the revocable key approach by introducing a system of overlapping, dynamically generated "woven" keys, each with a controlled "drift" rate, enabling continuous, granular access control and obfuscation without full re-encryption.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Key Structure:** Instead of a single intermediate key, generate a "Key Weave" – a sequence of N intermediate keys (Ki, where i = 1 to N). Each Ki is derived not just from the current first key (K1) and a "seed" intermediate key, but also from a temporal component (T).  T represents the current time, or a time slice.

2.  **Key Generation (pseudocode):**

    ```
    function generate_key_weave(K1, SeedKey, T, N):
        KeyWeave = []
        for i in range(N):
            Ti = T + (i * DriftRate)  // DriftRate is a configurable parameter
            Ki = Hash(K1 + SeedKey + Ti)  //Secure hash function
            KeyWeave.append(Ki)
        return KeyWeave
    ```

3.  **Data Encryption/Decryption:** Data isn’t re-encrypted with a *single* new key. Instead, a sliding window of the Key Weave is applied.  To access data:

    *   Derive the current active Key Weave slice based on current time.
    *   Apply a cascading XOR operation (or similar mixing function) on the encrypted data using each key in the current slice.
    *   The number of keys in the slice and the order they are applied are defined by a configuration parameter.

4.  **Drift Rate Control:** The `DriftRate` parameter allows tuning the speed at which the key weave changes. A faster drift rate increases security (more frequent key changes) but also increases computational overhead.

5.  **Access Control Granularity:** Different users or data segments can be assigned different `DriftRate` values, providing fine-grained access control.  A user with a slower `DriftRate` effectively has longer-term access to a particular data segment, while a user with a faster `DriftRate` has more limited, temporary access.

6.  **Key Revocation:**  Revocation is handled by invalidating a user's SeedKey. This immediately disrupts their ability to generate the Key Weave correctly.

7.  **Data Tagging:** Associate each data block with a timestamp indicating when it was encrypted with a specific Key Weave slice. This allows for efficient filtering of outdated data.

8.  **Implementation Considerations:**

    *   Use a cryptographically secure hash function (SHA-256, Argon2) for key derivation.
    *   Implement a robust time synchronization mechanism to ensure consistent key generation across all nodes.
    *   Optimize the cascading XOR operation for performance.
    *   Develop a monitoring system to track key drift rates and detect potential security breaches.



This system moves beyond simple key replacement to create a dynamically evolving security layer. The continuous key drift makes it significantly harder for attackers to compromise data, even if they obtain a key at a specific point in time.
