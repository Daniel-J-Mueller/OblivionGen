## Adaptive Schema Evolution with Conflict-Driven Migration

**Concept:** Extend the conflict resolution system to actively participate in schema evolution, dynamically adjusting data structures *during* mutation conflicts, rather than simply rejecting or prompting for a value. This allows for more robust handling of evolving data formats without downtime or complex pre-migration procedures.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Schema Evolution Agent (SEA) â€“ a new module integrated within the data proxy.
*   **Trigger:** Activated *during* conflict resolution when the conflict analysis indicates a schema mismatch.  This is differentiated from 'normal' data conflicts.
*   **Schema Repository:** SEA maintains a history of schema versions for each data entity. This could be a distributed key-value store.
*   **Migration Functions:** A library of pre-defined migration functions for common schema transformations (e.g., adding a field, renaming a field, changing data type). These are registered with the SEA. New functions can be dynamically added.
*   **Conflict Analysis:**  Expanded conflict detection to include schema-level mismatches.
*   **Dynamic Migration:** Upon detecting a schema conflict:
    1.  The SEA analyzes the incoming mutation and the current schema.
    2.  It identifies the necessary migration path to reconcile the mutation with the existing schema.
    3.  The SEA selects the appropriate migration function.
    4.  The function is executed *within* the data proxy, transforming the incoming mutation.
    5.  The transformed mutation is then applied to the data store.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If the migration fails, a rollback mechanism is triggered to revert the mutation and optionally log the error.
*   **Schema Versioning:** Automatic schema versioning is managed by the SEA.  Each successful migration increments the schema version.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `migration_function_path`: Path to the directory containing custom migration functions.
    *   `default_migration_strategy`:  Strategy for handling unknown schema conflicts (e.g., reject, attempt auto-migration with limited transformations).
    *   `max_migration_attempts`: Maximum number of attempts to auto-migrate before rejecting the mutation.

**Pseudocode (SEA Conflict Handler):**

```
function handleConflict(mutation, conflictMessage) {
  if (conflictMessage.type == "SCHEMA_MISMATCH") {
    schemaMismatchDetails = conflictMessage.details
    migrationPath = determineMigrationPath(mutation, schemaMismatchDetails)

    if (migrationPath != null) {
      try {
        transformedMutation = applyMigration(mutation, migrationPath)
        applyMutationToDataStore(transformedMutation)
        updateSchemaVersion(schemaMismatchDetails.entityName)
        return SUCCESS
      } catch (error) {
        rollbackMutation()
        logError("Migration failed: " + error)
        return FAILURE
      }
    } else {
      // No known migration path - reject or use default strategy
      rejectMutation(conflictMessage)
      return FAILURE
    }
  } else {
    // Standard conflict - handle as before
    return baseHandleConflict(mutation, conflictMessage)
  }
}

function determineMigrationPath(mutation, schemaMismatchDetails) {
  // Query schema repository for possible migration paths
  // based on current schema version and desired mutation structure
  return migrationPath;
}

function applyMigration(mutation, migrationPath) {
  // Execute the appropriate migration function(s)
  // to transform the mutation
  return transformedMutation;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced downtime for schema evolution.
*   Improved resilience to evolving data formats.
*   Simplified data migration processes.
*   Increased application agility.
