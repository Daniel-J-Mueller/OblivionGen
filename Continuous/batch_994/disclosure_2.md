## Distributed Acoustic Scene Classification with Federated Learning

**Concept:** Expand the distributed processing framework to *not* just speech recognition, but to acoustic scene classification (ASC) – identifying environments like ‘car interior’, ‘office’, ‘beach’, etc. – and implement this with a federated learning approach for enhanced privacy and model generalization. The existing difference coding can be leveraged for reduced bandwidth, but now for scene-specific feature vectors instead of speech features.

**Specifications:**

**1. Client Device (Edge Node):**

*   **Input:** Raw audio stream.
*   **Preprocessing:**
    *   Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) applied to the audio.
    *   Feature extraction:  Calculate Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and spectral contrast.  (Expandable feature set).
    *   Local Model:  A small, pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for initial scene classification.  This model is *not* the global model.
    *   Difference Vector Calculation: Calculate the difference between the feature vectors output by the local model *and* the raw extracted features (MFCCs, Chroma, Spectral Contrast).  This creates a ‘residual feature vector’.
*   **Compression:**
    *   Compress the residual feature vector using lossless compression (e.g., Zstandard).
    *   Compress the raw audio signal using a low-bitrate lossy codec (e.g., Opus).
*   **Transmission:** Transmit the compressed residual feature vector *and* the compressed audio to the server.

**2. Server Device (Central Aggregator):**

*   **Reception:** Receive compressed residual feature vectors and compressed audio streams from multiple client devices.
*   **Decompression:** Decompress received data.
*   **Feature Reconstruction:** For each client, reconstruct the full feature vector by adding the decompressed residual feature vector to the decompressed raw features.
*   **Global Model Training:** Utilize the reconstructed feature vectors to train a central, global ASC model (e.g., a larger CNN or Transformer network). Implement Federated Averaging for training, updating the global model based on contributions from each client without directly accessing their raw data.
*   **Model Distribution:** Periodically distribute updated global model weights back to the client devices.

**3. Client-Side Model Update & Inference:**

*   **Model Download:** Client devices download the updated global model.
*   **Fine-Tuning (Optional):** Allow limited, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of the global model on the client device using a small local dataset. (Differential Privacy techniques may be employed to further protect data).
*   **Inference:** Client device performs ASC using the fine-tuned (or directly downloaded) global model and the locally reconstructed feature vectors.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Feature Calculation & Transmission):**

```
function processAudio(audioStream):
    stftOutput = STFT(audioStream)
    mfccs = MFCC(stftOutput)
    chroma = Chroma(stftOutput)
    spectralContrast = SpectralContrast(stftOutput)

    rawFeatures = concatenate(mfccs, chroma, spectralContrast)

    localModelOutput = localModel.forward(rawFeatures)

    residualFeatures = localModelOutput - rawFeatures

    compressedResidual = losslessCompress(residualFeatures)
    compressedAudio = lossyCompress(audioStream)

    transmit(compressedResidual, compressedAudio)
```

**Novelty:**

The combination of:

*   Difference coding applied to *model output* (not raw audio) in an ASC context.
*   Federated Learning architecture for privacy-preserving scene classification.
*   Leveraging the residual feature vector to reduce bandwidth while maintaining accuracy.

This approach goes beyond just improving speech recognition bandwidth and tackles a broader problem – distributed acoustic analysis – with a focus on data privacy and model generalization. It allows for training ASC models on diverse datasets without requiring centralized data collection.
