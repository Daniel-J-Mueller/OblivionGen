## Dynamic Software Partitioning & Execution Profiles

**Specification:** A system enabling dynamic allocation of user and system partitions *during* runtime, coupled with execution profiles tailored to the allocated partitions.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of fixed partition sizes and locations, the system dynamically adjusts the user/system split based on application demand *and* user behavior. This is paired with "execution profiles" which dictate how an application runs based on *where* it’s installed – whether a standard user partition, a temporary ‘fast’ partition, or a secured enclave partition.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Non-volatile memory with fast read/write capabilities (NVMe SSD recommended).
*   Memory Management Unit (MMU) capable of fine-grained memory protection.
*   Secure boot process to verify partition integrity.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Partition Manager:**  A kernel-level service responsible for managing memory partitions.  Functions:
    *   Dynamically resizing user and system partitions.
    *   Creating temporary, ephemeral partitions ("fast partitions") for performance-critical tasks.
    *   Creating secured enclave partitions (using technologies like Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone) for sensitive applications.
    *   Monitoring memory usage and triggering partition adjustments based on pre-defined thresholds.
2.  **Execution Profile Manager:** Reads application metadata (or determines application type) and selects an appropriate execution profile.  Profiles include:
    *   **Standard Profile:** Application runs in the standard user partition with typical permissions.
    *   **Fast Profile:** Application (or specific components) are copied to a "fast" partition (RAM disk or NVMe SSD) for faster access.  Data is automatically synchronized back to the standard partition.
    *   **Secure Profile:** Application runs within a secured enclave partition, isolating it from the rest of the system.
3.  **Application Metadata Service:**  Stores metadata about applications, including:
    *   Recommended execution profile.
    *   Resource requirements (CPU, memory, storage).
    *   Dependencies.
    *   Security level.

**Pseudocode (Partition Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
function adjust_partitions(current_user_partition_size, current_system_partition_size, user_memory_usage, system_memory_usage):
  max_user_partition_size = 80% of total memory
  min_user_partition_size = 20% of total memory
  max_system_partition_size = 80% of total memory
  min_system_partition_size = 20% of total memory

  if user_memory_usage > 80% of current_user_partition_size and current_user_partition_size < max_user_partition_size:
    increase user_partition_size by 10%, decrease system_partition_size by 10% 
    //Ensure system partition stays above min_system_partition_size

  if system_memory_usage > 80% of current_system_partition_size and current_system_partition_size < max_system_partition_size:
    increase system_partition_size by 10%, decrease user_partition_size by 10%
    //Ensure user partition stays above min_user_partition_size

  if user_memory_usage < 20% of current_user_partition_size and current_user_partition_size > min_user_partition_size:
    decrease user_partition_size by 10%, increase system_partition_size by 10%

  if system_memory_usage < 20% of current_system_partition_size and current_system_partition_size > min_system_partition_size:
    decrease system_partition_size by 10%, increase user_partition_size by 10%
end function
```

**Workflow:**

1.  System boots and initializes default partitions.
2.  Partition Manager monitors memory usage in real-time.
3.  Execution Profile Manager analyzes applications being launched.
4.  Based on application type and memory usage, Partition Manager dynamically adjusts partition sizes.
5.  Applications are launched with the appropriate execution profile, leveraging the dynamically allocated partitions.
6.  Data synchronization mechanisms ensure data consistency between partitions.
