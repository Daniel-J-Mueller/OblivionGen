## Dynamic Authentication Context via Physiological Signal Integration

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Non-invasive physiological sensor suite integrated into common client devices (smartphones, laptops, wearables). Includes:
        *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor for heart rate variability (HRV) measurement.
        *   Microphone array for voice stress analysis & ambient sound detection.
        *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope for motion/activity detection.
    *   Edge processing unit within client device for preliminary data filtering and feature extraction.
    *   Secure enclave for storage of biometric keys and encrypted data transmission.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Baseline Profile Generator:**  Server-side module.  Collects physiological data during *normal* user activity (with explicit consent and privacy controls).  Establishes baseline ranges for HRV, vocal patterns, motion profiles, and environmental noise levels.  Dynamic updating based on continuous learning.
    *   **Real-time Anomaly Detector:** Runs on the client device edge processing unit.  Analyzes incoming physiological signals.  Compares to the userâ€™s baseline profile.  Flags deviations *before* action requests are processed.
    *   **Contextual Authentication Broker:** Server-side. Receives anomaly flags and contextual data (e.g., action type, time of day, location).  Determines authentication level.  Initiates appropriate authentication challenge.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication Integration:** Supports existing MFA methods (push notifications, biometrics, OTP). Prioritizes/adjusts based on detected anomaly level.  e.g., low anomaly = silent step-up authentication; high anomaly = full MFA challenge.
    *   **Adaptive Thresholding Engine:** Continuously adjusts anomaly detection thresholds based on user behavior and environment.  Reduces false positives and adapts to changing user patterns.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(physiologicalData, userBaseline) {
  // Extract features (HRV, vocal stress, motion features)
  features = extractFeatures(physiologicalData)

  // Calculate deviation from baseline
  deviation = calculateDeviation(features, userBaseline)

  // Apply adaptive threshold
  threshold = adjustThreshold(deviation, userHistory, environment)

  if (deviation > threshold) {
    return true // Anomaly detected
  } else {
    return false // No anomaly
  }
}

function adjustThreshold(deviation, userHistory, environment) {
  // Example: Increase threshold if user is frequently active.
  // Decrease threshold in quiet environments.
  baseThreshold = 0.5
  activityModifier = getUserActivityLevel(userHistory) * 0.2
  environmentModifier = getAmbientNoiseLevel(environment) * -0.1
  return baseThreshold + activityModifier + environmentModifier
}
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simple behavioral or performance metrics. By directly integrating physiological signals, it creates a significantly more robust and nuanced authentication context.  It isn't just detecting *what* the user is doing, but *how* they are doing it, adding a layer of authenticity that is difficult to spoof. The adaptive thresholding engine ensures the system remains effective over time and across diverse user environments.
