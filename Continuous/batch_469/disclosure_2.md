## Dynamic Watermark & Data Encoding via Per-Pixel Chromatic Aberration

**Concept:** Instead of embedding timecode or data as distinct, interpretable color regions, subtly manipulate the chromatic aberration *within* the existing image. This creates a data stream imperceptible to the casual viewer but detectable with specialized software.

**Specs:**

*   **Aberration Profile Library:** Develop a library of pre-defined chromatic aberration profiles. Each profile represents a unique bit or byte sequence. These profiles aren’t simply ‘add X amount of red/blue shift’; they’re complex distortion patterns. Each profile must be mathematically unique, even if visually similar, to ensure robust decoding.
*   **Encoding Algorithm:**
    1.  **Data Segmentation:** Divide the data stream to be embedded into manageable chunks (e.g., 8-bit bytes).
    2.  **Profile Selection:**  For each byte, select the corresponding aberration profile from the library.
    3.  **Local Distortion Application:** Apply the selected profile to a localized region of the frame (e.g., a macroblock). This isn’t a uniform application; incorporate a pseudorandomness function based on the frame number and macroblock coordinates to distribute the aberration subtly. The pseudorandomness prevents easy pattern recognition.
    4.  **Blending & Compensation:** Implement a blending algorithm to smoothly integrate the aberration into the existing image. Simultaneously, apply a reverse distortion filter *globally* to minimize the visual impact on the overall image. The global filter is crucial for maintaining image quality.
*   **Decoding Algorithm:**
    1.  **Region Segmentation:** Divide the encoded video frame into the same region segments used during encoding (macroblocks).
    2.  **Aberration Analysis:** Analyze each region for chromatic aberration patterns. This requires a sensitive algorithm to differentiate between naturally occurring aberration (from lenses, etc.) and the embedded signal. Utilize Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to identify specific frequency components related to the embedded profiles.
    3.  **Profile Matching:** Compare the detected aberration pattern to the known aberration profiles in the library. This is a pattern recognition task.
    4.  **Data Reconstruction:** Reconstruct the encoded data stream based on the matched profiles.
*   **Hardware/Software Requirements:**
    *   High-resolution image processing hardware (GPU preferred) for encoding and decoding.
    *   Specialized software with aberration analysis and pattern recognition capabilities.
    *   Calibration tool to account for naturally occurring aberrations in the video source.
*   **Pseudocode (Encoding):**

```
function encodeFrame(frame, data, frameNumber):
  dataBytes = splitDataIntoBytes(data)
  for each macroblock in frame:
    byteIndex = frameNumber % length(dataBytes) // cyclical data
    dataByte = dataBytes[byteIndex]
    aberrationProfile = getAberrationProfile(dataByte)
    randomOffset = generateRandomOffset(frameNumber, macroblockCoordinates)
    applyAberrationProfile(macroblock, aberrationProfile, randomOffset)
  applyGlobalReverseDistortion(frame)
  return frame
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Advanced watermarking
    *   Secure video transmission
    *   Steganographic communication
    *   Tamper detection (by checking embedded checksums)

* **Novelty**: Existing methods focus on visible color regions. This method leverages subtle distortions almost imperceptible to humans, making it more secure and robust against accidental or intentional removal. It moves away from 'adding' data and toward 'modifying' existing data imperceptibly.
