## Temporal Anomaly Prediction & Pre-emptive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the system to not only *store* metrics for performance monitoring but to *predict* potential resource bottlenecks or system failures based on historical data and real-time trends.  The system then proactively allocates resources to mitigate these predicted issues *before* they impact performance. This moves beyond reactive monitoring to proactive prevention.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:**  Existing metric stream (CPU utilization, network throughput, storage I/O, response latency, etc.).  Add a 'health' signal per monitored component (pass/fail, warning) derived from basic threshold checks.
*   **Temporal Modeling Engine:**
    *   **Algorithm:**  Hybrid approach combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting with Bayesian networks to model dependencies between metrics.
    *   **Training:** Continuous training using historical data.  New data integrated incrementally to adapt to changing system behavior.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  LSTM predicts future metric values.  Bayesian network assesses the probability of anomalies based on deviations from predictions *and* correlations between metrics.  A 'risk score' is generated.
*   **Resource Allocation Engine:**
    *   **Resource Pool:** Access to a pool of available resources (CPU cores, memory, network bandwidth, storage capacity). These resources can be virtualized or physical.
    *   **Allocation Strategy:** Based on the risk score, the engine dynamically allocates resources to components predicted to experience bottlenecks.  Priority is based on component criticality and potential impact.  Allocation is done *before* metrics exceed predefined thresholds.
    *   **Resource Types:** Support allocation of various resource types:
        *   CPU affinity/scheduling priority adjustment
        *   Memory allocation/caching adjustments
        *   Network bandwidth reservation (QoS)
        *   Storage I/O prioritization
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor the impact of resource allocation.
    *   Adjust allocation strategies based on observed performance improvements.
    *   Update the Temporal Modeling Engine with new data to refine predictions.
*   **API Interface:**
    *   Expose an API for external systems to query predicted risks and resource allocation status.
    *   Allow external systems to influence allocation strategies (e.g., specify resource preferences).

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION AllocateResources(riskScores, resourcePool, componentCriticality)
  // riskScores: Dictionary of component IDs -> risk score
  // resourcePool: Dictionary of resource type -> available amount
  // componentCriticality: Dictionary of component ID -> criticality level

  FOR each componentID, riskScore IN riskScores:
    IF riskScore > threshold AND componentCriticality[componentID] > minimumCriticality:
      // Determine resource requirements based on predicted bottleneck
      resourceRequest = CalculateResourceRequest(componentID, riskScore)

      // Check resource availability
      IF resourceRequest.cpu > resourcePool.cpu OR resourceRequest.memory > resourcePool.memory:
        // Resource contention - prioritize allocation or defer
        IF componentCriticality[componentID] > highCriticality:
          // Preempt lower-priority component
          PreemptComponent(lowerPriorityComponent)
        ELSE:
          DeferAllocation(componentID)

      ELSE:
        // Allocate resources
        Allocate(componentID, resourceRequest)
        UpdateResourcePool(resourceRequest)

  END FOR
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems primarily focus on *monitoring* and *alerting*. This expands the paradigm to *predictive prevention* through dynamic resource allocation driven by sophisticated temporal modeling. It proactively addresses potential issues before they manifest as performance degradations.
