**Dynamic Contextual Clip Stitching for Immersive Environments**

**Concept:** Extending the idea of stitching video clips based on location and time, this system focuses on building *immersive* experiences by dynamically adjusting clip selection and transitions based on user gaze/head tracking within a virtual or augmented reality environment. It isn’t just about assembling a timeline; it’s about creating a seamless experience that feels natural and responsive.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multiple video streams (from various sources - potentially the same as the patent, but extended to include 360° cameras, drones, user-generated content), user head/gaze tracking data (VR/AR headset), environmental data (depth sensors, ambient light levels).
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   **Spatial Mapping:**  Create a 3D map of the environment from sensor data. This map serves as the core reference for clip alignment.
    *   **Annotation Enhancement:** Expand annotation data beyond location, time, and objects to include “viewpoints” – pre-defined camera angles/positions within each video clip.  Also include “aesthetic qualities” - metadata describing lighting, color palettes, and mood.
    *   **Predictive Gaze Analysis:** Implement a short-term gaze prediction algorithm. Anticipate where the user will look next based on their current gaze direction, head movement, and environmental context.
*   **Clip Selection & Stitching:**
    *   **Priority Matrix:** Develop a priority matrix for clip selection, weighting factors like:
        *   **Spatial Proximity:** Distance between the user’s current position and the viewpoint in the clip.
        *   **Temporal Proximity:** Time difference between the clip's timestamp and the current time.
        *   **Aesthetic Similarity:** Match aesthetic qualities between the current view and potential clips.
        *   **Gaze Prediction:** Prioritize clips that align with the predicted gaze direction.
    *   **Dynamic Transitioning:**
        *   Implement cross-dissolve, morph, or other smooth transition effects.
        *   Transition speed adapts to user movement - faster transitions during rapid movement, slower transitions during stationary viewing.
        *   Blend audio from different clips for a more seamless experience.
*   **Output:**  A dynamically generated video stream displayed on a VR/AR headset or other display device.

**Pseudocode (Clip Selection):**

```
function selectClip(userPosition, userGazeDirection, currentTime, availableClips):
  bestClip = null
  highestScore = -1

  for each clip in availableClips:
    score = 0

    // Spatial Proximity
    distance = calculateDistance(userPosition, clip.viewpoint)
    score += (1 / distance) * weight_spatial

    // Temporal Proximity
    timeDifference = abs(currentTime - clip.timestamp)
    score += (1 / timeDifference) * weight_temporal

    // Aesthetic Similarity
    aestheticScore = calculateAestheticSimilarity(currentView, clip)
    score += aestheticScore * weight_aesthetic

    // Gaze Prediction
    gazeScore = calculateGazeAlignment(userGazeDirection, clip.viewpoint)
    score += gazeScore * weight_gaze

    if score > highestScore:
      highestScore = score
      bestClip = clip

  return bestClip
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **AI-Powered Annotation:**  Use machine learning to automatically annotate video clips with relevant metadata (objects, scenes, landmarks, aesthetic qualities).
*   **Real-Time Rendering:**  Use real-time rendering techniques to seamlessly blend and transition between clips.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to customize the clip selection criteria and aesthetic preferences.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of video clips and users.
