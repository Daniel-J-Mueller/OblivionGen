## Dynamic Sonic Environments – Adaptive Audio for Spatial Storytelling

**Concept:** Extend the personalized music selection beyond simple playlist generation. Create dynamically shifting "sonic environments" layered with ambient sounds and musical textures, responsive to both user preferences *and* the virtual/physical environment’s narrative context. This goes beyond background music; it's world-building through sound.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core System:**  A layered audio engine operating alongside the existing music preference AI.
*   **Environment Mapping:**  Integration with environment sensors (virtual or physical).  This could include:
    *   Location data (GPS, virtual coordinates)
    *   Object/Actor Detection (e.g., identifying "forest," "city street," “a character entered the room”).
    *   Time of day/Weather data.
    *   User activity (walking, sitting, interacting with objects).
*   **Sound Palette:** A vast library of ambient sounds, foley effects, musical loops, and generative audio assets categorized by environment type, mood, and narrative function.  Assets should support dynamic parameter control (volume, pan, pitch, filtering, etc.)
*   **Narrative Engine Integration:** API access to a narrative or game engine to receive "scene descriptions" or "emotional cues" (e.g., “tension building,” “peaceful exploration,” “a chase sequence”).
*   **AI Director:** A separate AI model responsible for blending the music layer with the environmental sounds *and* modulating parameters based on user preferences and narrative cues. The Director dynamically adjusts:
    *   Music intensity/complexity
    *   Ambient sound density/variety
    *   Spatialization of sounds (3D audio)
    *   Parameter modulation (e.g. filter sweeps, delays)
*   **User Preference Weights:**  Allow users to specify weighting between music, ambient sounds, and narrative responsiveness. 
*   **Realtime Adaptation:**  All adaptation happens in real-time, seamless transitions and no jarring changes.

**Pseudocode (AI Director – simplified):**

```
function generateSonicEnvironment(userPreferences, narrativeCue, environmentData):

    musicTrack = selectMusicTrack(userPreferences)
    ambientSoundscape = createAmbientSoundscape(environmentData)

    // Blend Music and Ambient soundscape
    outputMix = blend(musicTrack, ambientSoundscape, userPreferences.musicWeight)

    //Modulate based on narrative Cue
    if narrativeCue == "tension":
        outputMix.addEffect("lowpassFilter", cutoff=500Hz)
        outputMix.increaseIntensity()
    else if narrativeCue == "peaceful":
        outputMix.addEffect("reverb", decayTime=2s)
        outputMix.decreaseIntensity()

    //Spatialize Sounds based on environmentData
    for each sound in outputMix:
        sound.position = environmentData.soundPositions[sound.name]
        sound.attenuation = environmentData.attenuationFactors[sound.name]

    return outputMix
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Multi-channel audio output (at least 5.1 surround).
*   Spatial audio rendering engine.
*   High-performance audio processing capabilities (DSP).
*   Robust API for integration with external engines and sensors.
*   Large storage capacity for sound assets.
*   AI/ML frameworks for preference learning and environment adaptation.
