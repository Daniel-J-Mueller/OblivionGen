## Adaptive Data Partitioning & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand code execution system to dynamically partition data objects *not* based on fixed blocks, but on access patterns *predicted* by the owner-defined code itself.  Instead of simply streaming blocks, the system anticipates what portions of the data the code will need *next* and prefetches those portions. This drastically reduces latency and improves throughput, particularly for complex data manipulations.

**Specs:**

*   **Code-Driven Partitioning Hints:** The owner-defined code can include “partition hints” – metadata that suggests how the data object *should* be partitioned for optimal access.  These aren’t rigid requirements, but strong recommendations.  Example: a code segment analyzing a video might suggest partitioning by keyframes or scene changes. These hints are transmitted along with the initial I/O request.
*   **Access Pattern Analyzer:** A component within the staging environment monitors the owner-defined code’s data access during initial execution.  It builds a probabilistic model of future access patterns. This model is refined over time.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning Engine:** Based on the partition hints *and* the access pattern model, the dynamic partitioning engine breaks down the data object into variable-sized partitions.  It prioritizes partitions likely to be needed soon.
*   **Prefetching Mechanism:**  A dedicated prefetching thread monitors the execution environment’s memory access.  When it detects that the execution environment is nearing the end of a currently loaded partition, it proactively fetches the next predicted partition.
*   **Staging Area Enhancements:** The input staging location now supports storing partitions of varying sizes. It maintains a cache of recently accessed partitions for even faster retrieval.
*   **Adaptive Granularity:** The system dynamically adjusts the partition size based on the data type and the owner-defined code’s access pattern. Small, frequent access -> small partitions. Large, sequential access -> large partitions.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  If a prefetch fails (e.g., network issue), the execution environment can fall back to a blocking read, but with a prefetch error penalty.
*   **Output Aggregation:** The output staging location receives data in variable-sized chunks from the execution environment. An aggregation component reassembles these chunks into a coherent output object.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Thread):**

```
while (system_running):
    access_info = get_execution_environment_memory_access();

    if (access_info.current_partition_end_approaching()):
        predicted_partition = predict_next_partition(access_info, access_pattern_model);

        if (predicted_partition.valid()):
            prefetch_partition(predicted_partition);
        else:
            // Log warning - prediction failed
            pass

    sleep(10ms);
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PartitionHint`:  {data_type, suggested_size, access_pattern, metadata}
*   `AccessPatternModel`:  Probabilistic model of data access (e.g., Markov Chain)
*   `Partition`: {partition_id, data, size}
*   `AccessInfo`: {current_partition_id, current_access_offset, access_pattern}
