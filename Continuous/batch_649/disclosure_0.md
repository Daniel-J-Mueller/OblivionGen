## Dynamic Resource ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the template-driven update system with a ‘shadowing’ mechanism. Instead of directly modifying live resources, create near-identical ‘shadow’ resources based on the *second template* alongside the existing stack.  Simultaneously run both stacks (live & shadow) and compare performance metrics/state. Upon successful shadow validation, seamlessly switch traffic to the new stack.  If issues arise in the shadow stack, automatically rollback to the initial stack *without any downtime*.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadow Stack Creation:**
    *   Upon receiving the second template, the system automatically provisions a complete ‘shadow’ stack alongside the existing ‘live’ stack.
    *   Resource provisioning should mirror the live stack as closely as possible, utilizing identical configurations where appropriate (except for those dictated by the second template).
    *   Shadow resources are provisioned with unique identifiers to avoid conflicts.

2.  **Parallel Execution & State Comparison:**
    *   Route a small percentage of live traffic to the shadow stack for real-world testing (configurable threshold).
    *   Implement a continuous state comparison engine. This engine monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) – latency, error rates, throughput – across both stacks.
    *   Comparison engine utilizes a configurable weighting system for KPIs, allowing prioritization of specific metrics.
    *   The system flags discrepancies exceeding defined thresholds.

3.  **Automated Traffic Switching:**
    *   If the shadow stack consistently demonstrates superior or equivalent performance (based on KPI weights) for a predefined duration, initiate a seamless traffic switch.
    *   Traffic switch utilizes a load balancing mechanism (e.g., DNS updates, load balancer configuration changes) to redirect 100% of traffic to the shadow stack.
    *   Upon successful switch, the original live stack is deprovisioned or retained as a warm standby.

4.  **Predictive Rollback:**
    *   If the shadow stack fails validation criteria at *any* point, the system automatically initiates a rollback to the original live stack *without user intervention*.
    *   Rollback is performed via the same traffic switching mechanism used for the initial switch.
    *   The system logs all rollback events and associated error details for analysis.
    *   Automated alerting system notifies administrators of rollback events.

5.  **Dependency Resolution Enhancement:**
    *   Expand the existing dependency resolution to include a ‘rollback cost’ metric.
    *   If cascading changes introduce high rollback complexity (e.g., significant data migration), the system flags a warning and allows administrators to override the update.

**Pseudocode (Rollback Logic):**

```
function performRollback(originalStackID, shadowStackID) {
  // 1. Stop all traffic to shadow stack
  stopTraffic(shadowStackID)

  // 2. Redirect all traffic to original stack
  redirectTraffic(originalStackID)

  // 3. Deprovision shadow stack
  deprovisionStack(shadowStackID)

  // 4. Log rollback event with details (error messages, timestamps)
  logEvent("Rollback Successful", details)

  // 5. Send alert to administrators
  sendAlert("Rollback Completed")
}

function monitorShadowStack(shadowStackID, originalStackID) {
  while (shadowStackActive) {
    metrics = getMetrics(shadowStackID)
    originalMetrics = getMetrics(originalStackID)

    if (compareMetrics(metrics, originalMetrics) == FAILURE) {
      performRollback(originalStackID, shadowStackID)
      return
    }
  }
}
```
