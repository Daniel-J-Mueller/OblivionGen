## Dynamic Vocabulary Expansion via Generative Phonetic Priming

**Concept:** Extend the system’s ability to handle rare/out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words not just through phonetic similarity *after* initial transcription, but proactively *during* the beam search decoding process by leveraging a generative model to 'prime' phonetic expectations.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses heavily on biasing probabilities based on prefixes and phonetic alignment *after* candidate sequences are generated. This design aims to shift some of that computation forward, anticipating OOV word pronunciations *during* the search itself. This is particularly useful for domain-specific jargon or neologisms where phonetic similarity to known words may be limited.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Generative Phonetic Model (GPM):** A transformer-based generative model trained on a massive corpus of speech and text. The GPM’s primary function is to predict plausible phonetic sequences given a partial sub-word sequence (prefix) or even a contextual embedding.  This model isn't for *transcription*; it's for generating phonetic probabilities.

2.  **Contextual Embedding Integration:** The existing acoustic embedding representation (from claim 12) is used as input to the GPM. This allows the GPM to generate phonetic predictions *conditioned* on the broader utterance context.

3.  **Dynamic Probability Adjustment:**
    *   During beam search decoding, when a partial sub-word sequence (prefix) is encountered, a request is sent to the GPM.
    *   The GPM generates a probability distribution over possible next phonemes, given the acoustic embedding and the current prefix.
    *   These GPM-generated probabilities are *combined* with the standard CTC decoder probabilities.  A weighted sum can be used, with the weight being a learned parameter adjusted during training.  (e.g.,  `P_combined = alpha * P_CTC + (1 - alpha) * P_GPM`)
    *   This combined probability distribution is then used to guide the beam search.

4.  **Vocabulary-Agnostic Phoneme Set:** The GPM operates on a standardized phoneme set, independent of the specific vocabulary used for the CTC decoder. This allows it to generalize to OOV words.

5. **Adaptive GPM Weighting:** Implement a mechanism to dynamically adjust the weight (`alpha` in the equation above) given the confidence of the CTC decoder. If the CTC decoder is highly confident about a particular sub-word sequence, the GPM's influence is reduced. If the CTC decoder is uncertain, the GPM’s influence is increased.

**Pseudocode (within the beam search loop):**

```
function beam_search_step(partial_sequence, current_probabilities):

  prefix = extract_prefix(partial_sequence)
  context_embedding = get_acoustic_embedding() #From claim 12

  gpm_probabilities = generate_phoneme_probabilities(gpm, context_embedding, prefix) #GPM output

  combined_probabilities = alpha * current_probabilities + (1 - alpha) * gpm_probabilities

  next_candidates = expand_beam(combined_probabilities)

  return next_candidates
```

**Training Data:**

*   Large-scale speech and text corpus.
*   A dedicated dataset of OOV words with corresponding pronunciations (for fine-tuning the GPM).
*   Data augmentation techniques to simulate variations in pronunciation.

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   The GPM may require a dedicated GPU or accelerator to achieve real-time performance.
*   Efficient communication between the CTC decoder and the GPM is crucial.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved accuracy for rare and OOV words.
*   Reduced reliance on large custom vocabularies.
*   Enhanced robustness to noisy or accented speech.
*   Greater adaptability to new domains and use cases.
