**Personalized Item ‘Evolution’ System**

**Concept:** Extend the data-driven recommendation system to allow users to actively ‘evolve’ catalog items, shaping them based on their preferences and needs, creating personalized variants.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Item Decomposition Module:**
    *   Input: Catalog item data (including existing user-submitted information).
    *   Process:  Decompose the item into its constituent features/attributes (e.g., for a jacket: material, color, style, length, pockets, hood).  This decomposition is dynamic, using NLP on existing user descriptions to identify key attributes.
    *   Output:  Structured representation of item features, flagged for user modification.

2.  **User Modification Interface:**
    *   Display: Presents the decomposed item features to the user.
    *   Controls:
        *   Attribute Sliders:  Allow adjustment of numerical attributes (e.g., sleeve length, material thickness).
        *   Dropdown Menus:  Select from pre-defined options (e.g., color, style).
        *   Text Fields:  Add/Modify descriptive tags.
        *   Image Upload: Upload images of desired modifications (e.g., different button styles).
        *   "AI Assist" Button:  Generates modification suggestions based on user history and preferences.

3.  **Variant Creation & Storage:**
    *   Process:  When a user completes modifications, a new ‘variant’ of the item is created.
    *   Storage:  Variants are stored with:
        *   Original Item ID
        *   User ID (of the modifier)
        *   Modification Data (detailed record of changes)
        *   “Popularity” Score (based on views, purchases, and other user interactions)

4.  **Variant Discovery & Display:**
    *   Search/Filtering: Users can search for variants based on specific modifications.
    *   “Evolved From” Link:  Displays a link from a variant back to the original item.
    *   Variant Feed:  A personalized feed of new and popular variants.

5.  **Gamification & Rewards:**
    *   "Evolution Points": Users earn points for creating and popularizing variants.
    *   Badges:  Awarded for specific achievements (e.g., “Master Tailor”, “Style Innovator”).
    *   Exclusive Access: Top contributors gain early access to new items and features.

**Pseudocode - Variant Creation:**

```
FUNCTION CreateVariant(itemID, userID, modifications):
  variantID = GenerateUniqueId()
  variantData = {
    "itemID": itemID,
    "userID": userID,
    "modifications": modifications,
    "popularity": 0
  }
  StoreVariant(variantID, variantData)
  UpdateItemPopularity(itemID) //Increment original item's popularity
  RETURN variantID
```

**Extended Functionality:**

*   **Collaborative Evolution:** Allow multiple users to contribute to a single variant.
*   **AI-Driven Suggestion Engine:** Predict what modifications users might want to make based on their behavior.
*   **Integration with Manufacturing:**  Enable on-demand manufacturing of popular variants.
