## Automated Dependency Injection via Machine Image ‘Layers’

**Concept:** Extend the machine image concept to a layered dependency injection system. Rather than a monolithic image, a base image is established, then ‘layers’ containing specific dependencies (software packages, configurations, runtime environments) are applied *on top* of it during instantiation.  This enables highly customized instances without redundant image creation and storage.

**Specifications:**

*   **Base Image:** Minimal operating system installation. Serves as the foundation.
*   **Dependency Layers:** Containerized or virtualized packages encapsulating a specific dependency. Each layer includes metadata describing its dependencies, resource requirements, and activation scripts.  Layers are stored in a centralized repository.
*   **Layer Activation:** Scripts within each layer activate and configure the dependency *after* the layer is applied to the base image. These scripts use operating system instrumentation (similar to claim 10) to dynamically modify variables and settings.
*   **Layer Ordering:** A dependency graph defines the required order of layer application.  The system enforces this order to ensure dependencies are met.
*   **Dynamic Layer Selection:** Customers can select layers through a GUI (similar to claim 5), specifying desired software, configurations, and runtime environments.
*   **Layer Caching:** Applied layers are cached locally on the instantiation server to speed up deployment.
*   **Layer Versioning:** Multiple versions of each layer are maintained to support different application requirements and rollbacks.
*   **Automated Layer Creation:** Tooling exists to automatically package software and configurations into standardized layers.
*   **Layer ‘Chaining’:** Support combining multiple layers to create highly customized environments. 
*   **Resource Management:** Each layer defines its resource requirements (CPU, memory, storage). The instantiation system allocates resources based on the combined requirements of all applied layers.

**Pseudocode (Instantiation Process):**

```
function instantiate_instance(customer_config, base_image_id, layer_ids):
    // 1. Load base image
    image = load_image(base_image_id)

    // 2. Load dependency graph
    graph = build_dependency_graph(layer_ids)

    // 3. Apply layers in dependency order
    for layer_id in graph.ordered_layers:
        layer = load_layer(layer_id)
        apply_layer(image, layer)  // Executes layer activation scripts

    // 4. Apply customer-defined networking configuration (similar to claim 1)
    configure_network(image, customer_config)

    // 5. Generate reusable formation template (similar to claim 1)
    template = generate_template(image, customer_config)

    // 6. Return configured instance
    return image
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simply pre-baking dependencies into images. It shifts the focus to *dynamic* dependency injection at instantiation time, enabling greater flexibility, reduced storage requirements, and faster deployment. It introduces a ‘layer’ paradigm, creating modular, reusable, and customizable instances. This is particularly useful for environments requiring frequent updates or variations in software stacks.
