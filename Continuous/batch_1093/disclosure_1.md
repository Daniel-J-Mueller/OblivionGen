## Adaptive Data Tiering with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the scalable data storage service to automatically tier data across different storage media (e.g., NVMe SSD, SATA SSD, HDD, Tape/Object Storage) *based on predicted access patterns* rather than solely on committed throughput. This allows for cost optimization while maintaining performance for frequently accessed data.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Access Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical access patterns (read/write frequency, latency sensitivity, data size) for each table/partition. This engine predicts future access likelihood for data blocks.  Prediction horizon configurable per table.
*   **Tier Definitions:**  Admin-configurable tiers with associated storage media, cost per GB, and performance characteristics (IOPS, latency).  A 'default' tier is always present.
*   **Tiering Policies:** Policies define rules for automatically moving data between tiers based on predicted access frequency and cost thresholds.  Examples:
    *   "Move data predicted to be accessed less than once per month to the lowest cost tier."
    *   "Maintain data predicted to be accessed more than 100 times per day on NVMe."
*   **Intelligent Prefetching:**  Based on access predictions, proactively prefetch data into faster tiers *before* a request is received. This minimizes latency and maximizes throughput. Prefetching aggressiveness configurable per table/partition.
*   **Background Rebalancing:**  A continuous background process that monitors access patterns, adjusts tier assignments, and rebalances data across tiers. This ensures optimal cost and performance.
*   **API Extensions:**
    *   `getTableTieringPolicy(tableName)`: Returns the current tiering policy for a table.
    *   `setTableTieringPolicy(tableName, policyName)`: Sets a new tiering policy for a table.
    *   `getTieringPolicyStats(policyName)`: Returns statistics about the performance and cost savings of a specific tiering policy.

**Pseudocode (Background Rebalancing):**

```
FOR EACH table IN allTables:
    accessHistory = getAccessHistory(table, last 24 hours)
    prediction = dataAccessPredictionEngine.predict(accessHistory)
    currentTier = getTableTier(table)
    recommendedTier = determineRecommendedTier(prediction)

    IF recommendedTier != currentTier:
        IF recommendedTier is faster than currentTier:
            moveDataToFasterTier(table, dataToMove)  // Prioritize hot data
        ELSE:
            moveDataToSlowerTier(table, dataToMove)  // Archive cold data

    //Trigger prefetching based on predicted access for the next hour
    prefetchData(table, predictedAccessPatterns)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `TierDefinition`: {`tierName`:String, `storageMedia`:String, `costPerGB`:Float, `IOPS`:Int, `latencyMs`:Int}
*   `TieringPolicy`: {`policyName`:String, `rules`:Array<Rule>}
*   `Rule`: {`condition`:String, `action`:String, `parameters`:Map<String, String>}

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Data Access Prediction Engine must be horizontally scalable.
*   Background Rebalancing must be distributed across multiple nodes to handle large datasets.
*   Metadata about tier assignments and prediction data must be stored in a highly available and scalable key-value store.
