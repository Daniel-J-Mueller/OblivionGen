## Adaptive Bioluminescence Doorbell

**Concept:** A doorbell incorporating genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria encased in a transparent, weatherproof resin panel. The light emitted by the bacteria changes intensity and color based on detected sound and user-defined preferences.

**Specs:**

*   **Panel Material:** UV-stabilized, optically clear epoxy resin with embedded microfluidic channels.
*   **Bacterial Culture:** *Vibrio fischeri* or similar bioluminescent bacteria, genetically modified for enhanced light output and color variation (RGB capability achieved through gene editing). Bacteria contained within sealed microfluidic channels.
*   **Nutrient Delivery:** Microfluidic channels integrated with a miniature peristaltic pump. Nutrient solution (optimized bacterial growth medium) circulated continuously to sustain bioluminescence. Reservoir capacity: 30 days. Refillable via a hidden access panel.
*   **Sound Detection:** Integrated microphone array. Processing algorithms differentiate doorbell ring from ambient noise.
*   **Light Control:** Arduino-compatible microcontroller. Receives signal from microphone array. Adjusts nutrient flow rate to modulate bioluminescence intensity & color. Pre-programmed light sequences (e.g., pulsing blue for a standard ring, green for a service person, red for emergency). User-customizable via smartphone app.
*   **Power Source:** Wireless power transfer (Qi standard) or low-voltage wired connection. Battery backup for temporary operation during power outages.
*   **Housing:** Weatherproof, impact-resistant ABS plastic or aluminum enclosure. Modular design for easy maintenance and component replacement.
*   **Dimensions:** Customizable, but typical dimensions: 15cm x 10cm x 5cm.
*   **Waterproofing:** IP67 rating or higher.
*   **Microcontroller Firmware:**
    ```pseudocode
    //Initialization
    setupMicrophone()
    setupLightControl()
    setupWirelessCommunication()
    loadUserPreferences()

    //Main Loop
    while (true) {
        soundLevel = readMicrophone()
        if (soundLevel > threshold) {
            ringType = detectRingType() //Analyze sound frequency/pattern
            lightSequence = getUserPreference(ringType)
            activateLightSequence(lightSequence)
        } else {
            //Maintain a subtle, ambient glow
            setAmbientGlow()
        }
        //Monitor nutrient levels and adjust pump speed accordingly
        monitorNutrientLevels()
    }
    ```

*   **Nutrient Monitoring:** Miniature optical sensor integrated within the microfluidic network. Measures nutrient concentration and triggers a low-nutrient warning via the smartphone app.
*   **Smartphone App Features:**
    *   Customizable light sequences for different ring types.
    *   Nutrient level monitoring and refill reminders.
    *   Remote control of light intensity and color.
    *   Firmware updates.
    *   Diagnostics and troubleshooting.
