## Adaptive Request Sharding with Predictive Cancellation

**Concept:** Extend the cancellation token system to proactively *shard* requests based on predicted processing time, and employ a tiered cancellation strategy based on shard criticality.

**Specification:**

**I. Components:**

*   **Request Profiler:** A module that analyzes incoming requests, estimating processing time based on request type, payload size, historical data, and current system load.
*   **Shard Manager:** Responsible for dividing requests into shards based on predicted processing time.  
    *   *Fast Shard:* Requests predicted to complete quickly (e.g., under 50ms).  Low priority, easily cancelled.
    *   *Standard Shard:*  Requests with moderate processing time (50ms-500ms). Medium priority, standard cancellation.
    *   *Critical Shard:* Requests expected to take significant time (over 500ms). High priority, requires confirmation before cancellation.
*   **Distributed Processing Network:** A cluster of processing nodes.
*   **Cancellation Orchestrator:** Manages cancellation tokens and executes cancellation strategies.
*   **Confirmation Network:** Dedicated network for confirming completion of Critical Shard requests.  A simple acknowledgement system.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Request Ingestion:** Client sends a request.
2.  **Profiling:** Request Profiler estimates processing time.
3.  **Sharding:** Shard Manager assigns the request to a shard (Fast, Standard, or Critical).
4.  **Token Generation:** A primary cancellation token is generated and associated with the request *before* distribution.  Each shard receives a copy of this token.
5.  **Distribution:** The request (and cancellation token) is distributed to multiple processing nodes within the Distributed Processing Network.
6.  **Processing:** Nodes process the request.
7.  **Completion Detection:**
    *   For Fast and Standard shards: Node signals completion directly. Cancellation Orchestrator confirms.
    *   For Critical shards: Node signals completion. A message is sent over the Confirmation Network to a designated confirmation node. This node then confirms completion to the Cancellation Orchestrator.
8.  **Cancellation Orchestration:**
    *   Upon receiving completion signals (from one or more nodes), the Cancellation Orchestrator generates *secondary* cancellation tokens specific to each processing node *receiving the request*.
    *   The Orchestrator distributes these secondary tokens to the processing nodes, along with cancellation instructions. This allows for granular cancellation, even if some nodes have already begun processing.

**III. Cancellation Strategy**

*   **Fast Shard:**  Immediate cancellation upon receiving completion from *any* node.
*   **Standard Shard:** Cancellation initiated after receiving completion from a majority of nodes.
*   **Critical Shard:** Requires confirmation of completion from *all* processing nodes *and* confirmation from the Confirmation Network before cancellation.

**IV. Pseudocode (Cancellation Orchestrator - Core Logic)**

```pseudocode
function handleCompletion(requestID, nodeID, shardType):
  completionCount = getCompletionCount(requestID)
  incrementCompletionCount(requestID)

  if shardType == "Critical":
    if completionCount == totalNodes:
      //Critical Shard Complete
      sendConfirmationRequest(requestID)
  elif shardType == "Standard":
    if completionCount > (totalNodes / 2):
      //Standard Shard Complete, initiate cancellation
      initiateCancellation(requestID)
  else: // Fast Shard
    initiateCancellation(requestID)

function initiateCancellation(requestID):
    //Retrieve all nodes processing this request
    nodeList = getNodeList(requestID)
    for node in nodeList:
        sendCancellationSignal(node, requestID)

function sendCancellationSignal(node, requestID):
    //Send a cancellation signal to the node, including the requestID and primary token
    sendRequest(node, "cancel", requestID, primaryToken)

function sendConfirmationRequest(requestID):
    //Send request for confirmation to Confirmation Network
    sendRequest(ConfirmationNetwork, "confirm", requestID)
```

**V.  Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved resource utilization through adaptive prioritization.
*   Reduced latency by quickly cancelling redundant processing.
*   Increased resilience to node failures.
*   Enhanced scalability through optimized request distribution.
