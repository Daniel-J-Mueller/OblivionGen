## Dynamic Key Derivation via Environmental Entropy

**Concept:** Leverage environmental noise – radio frequency (RF) signals, thermal sensor readings, accelerometer data – as direct input to the key derivation function, effectively creating keys that are unique not just to operation count, but to the *physical context* in which the operation occurs. This moves beyond probabilistic rotation to a system where key existence is tied to transient environmental conditions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Entropy Sources:** Integrate access to the following:
    *   RF Spectrum Analyzer: Capture ambient RF noise in a defined frequency band.
    *   Thermal Sensor: Measure ambient temperature fluctuations.
    *   Accelerometer: Detect subtle vibrations and motion.
*   **Entropy Aggregation:** Implement a dedicated hardware module to:
    *   Sample each entropy source at a high frequency (e.g., 100Hz).
    *   Apply noise reduction and signal conditioning to raw data.
    *   Concatenate processed data into a combined entropy vector.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):** Modify the existing KDF to accept the entropy vector as an additional input.  A suitable algorithm might be HKDF with the entropy vector as the 'info' field.
*   **Key Lifecycle:** 
    1.  When an operation requiring encryption is requested.
    2.  Capture a snapshot of entropy data from all sources.
    3.  Derive a key using the KDF and the entropy snapshot.
    4.  Perform the encryption operation.
    5.  Discard the derived key *immediately* after use.  Do *not* cache or store.
*   **Failover Mechanism:** If entropy sources are unavailable or produce insufficient entropy, fall back to a secondary, deterministic key derivation method (e.g. counter-based) with limited operational duration.
*   **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration:**  HSM is responsible for:
    *   Entropy source access and pre-processing.
    *   KDF execution.
    *   Key management (generation, destruction).
    *   Secure storage of KDF parameters.

**Pseudocode (HSM module):**

```
function derive_and_encrypt(request, data):
    entropy_vector = capture_environmental_entropy()

    if entropy_vector is valid:
        key = HKDF(secret, entropy_vector, request.algorithm)
        encrypted_data = encrypt(data, key, request.algorithm)
        return encrypted_data
    else:
        //Fallback to deterministic key derivation
        key = generate_deterministic_key(request.counter)
        encrypted_data = encrypt(data, key, request.algorithm)
        increment_counter()
        return encrypted_data
```

**Rationale:** This drastically increases the attack surface compared to counter-based or purely probabilistic rotation. An attacker must not only compromise the HSM, but also accurately recreate the *exact* environmental conditions at the time of encryption to derive the same key.  The ephemeral nature of the keys minimizes the impact of any potential compromise.  It's a shift from 'key rotation' to 'key evanescence'.
