## Adaptive Cache Granularity for Loop Nests

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of cached analysis results based on data dependencies *within* loop nests. The provided patent focuses on caching at the statement level, keyed by control statements. This expands on that by considering *data* flow and modifying the cache key, or even creating multiple levels of caching, based on how data is used and transformed within the loop nest.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Dependency Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Intermediate Representation (IR) of the loop nest.
*   **Process:**
    *   Perform data dependency analysis within the loop nest to identify read-after-write (RAW), write-after-read (WAR), and write-after-write (WAW) dependencies.
    *   Construct a data dependency graph (DDG) representing these dependencies within the loop.
    *   Identify strongly connected components (SCCs) within the DDG. These represent sections of the loop where data flow is complex and dependencies are high.
*   **Output:** Data Dependency Graph and SCC identification.

**2. Adaptive Cache Key Generation:**

*   **Input:** IR of the loop nest, Data Dependency Graph, SCC Identification.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Base Key:** Control statements bounding the execution statement (as in the original patent).
    *   **Granularity Adjustment:**
        *   If the execution statement belongs to a single SCC, expand the base key to include a hash of the statements *within* that SCC. This creates a more specific key, acknowledging the data dependencies within that block.
        *   If the execution statement *bridges* multiple SCCs, the key includes a hash of the statements involved in the inter-SCC data transfer.
        *   If the execution statement is isolated (no dependencies within or between SCCs), use the original base key.
*   **Output:** Adaptive Cache Key.

**3. Multi-Level Cache Hierarchy:**

*   **Level 1 (L1): Fine-Grained Cache:** Stores analysis results using the *adaptive* cache key.  Designed for high hit rates within complex data flow sections. Small capacity, fast access.
*   **Level 2 (L2): Coarse-Grained Cache:** Stores analysis results using the original *base* key (control statements only).  Larger capacity, slower access. Acts as a fallback for less complex sections and reduces overall cache misses.
*   **Cache Lookup:**
    1.  Attempt lookup in L1 using adaptive key.
    2.  If L1 miss, attempt lookup in L2 using base key.
    3.  If both miss, perform analysis and store result in both L1 (with adaptive key) and L2 (with base key).

**4. Dynamic Adjustment Policy:**

*   **Monitoring:** Track cache hit rates for L1 and L2.
*   **Adjustment:**
    *   If L1 hit rate is low, *coarsen* the granularity of the cache key (reduce the amount of information included in the hash) for that SCC or bridge. This increases the chances of a hit in L2.
    *   If L2 hit rate is low for a specific SCC, *fine-tune* the granularity (increase hash information) to improve L1 hit rate.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function analyzeLoopNest(loopNest):
  dependencyGraph = performDataDependencyAnalysis(loopNest)
  sccs = identifyStronglyConnectedComponents(dependencyGraph)

  for statement in loopNest:
    adaptiveKey = generateAdaptiveCacheKey(statement, sccs)
    result = lookupCache(adaptiveKey, L1)

    if result == null:
      result = lookupCache(generateBaseCacheKey(statement), L2)

      if result == null:
        result = performAffineAnalysis(statement)
        storeCache(adaptiveKey, result, L1)
        storeCache(generateBaseCacheKey(statement), result, L2)

    modifyStatement(statement, result)

function generateAdaptiveCacheKey(statement, sccs):
  if statement belongs to SCC:
    return hash(SCC statements)
  else if statement bridges SCCs:
    return hash(bridging statements)
  else:
    return hash(control statements)
```

This approach moves beyond simple control statement-based caching to consider data dependencies, potentially significantly improving performance for complex loop nests, while also dynamically adapting to the characteristics of the code being compiled.
