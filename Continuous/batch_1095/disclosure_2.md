## Adaptive Illumination Mesh for Dynamic Stereo Calibration

**Concept:** Extend the calibration light source beyond a single point or array to a deformable, networked mesh of micro-LEDs embedded within the vehicle/rig’s surface. This mesh actively adjusts its illumination pattern to maximize feature detection and calibration accuracy *during* operation, compensating for environmental changes and dynamic vehicle movement.

**Specs:**

*   **Mesh Material:** Flexible, transparent polymer embedded with individually addressable micro-LEDs (density: 100 LEDs per square centimeter). Polymer formulated for UV resistance and temperature stability.
*   **Mesh Dimensions:** Conforms to key exterior surfaces of the vehicle/rig (e.g., around camera housings, leading edges of wings/body). Maximum coverage area: 1 square meter.
*   **Micro-LED Specs:** RGB micro-LEDs with peak wavelength accuracy of ±2nm. Brightness range: 0.1 – 1000 nits. Pulse width modulation (PWM) control for precise intensity adjustment.
*   **Communication:** Wireless mesh network (Bluetooth Low Energy or similar) for communication between micro-LEDs and central processor.
*   **Power:** Distributed power supply with local energy storage (thin-film batteries) integrated into the mesh.
*   **Processor:** Dedicated onboard processor (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano) responsible for:
    *   Real-time environment analysis (using camera data and IMU).
    *   Dynamic illumination pattern generation.
    *   Communication with micro-LED network.
    *   Calibration data processing.
*   **Software:**
    *   Illumination pattern library: Predefined patterns optimized for various environmental conditions and surface textures.
    *   Adaptive algorithm: Adjusts illumination pattern based on real-time environment analysis and calibration error metrics.
    *   Calibration routine: Integrates with existing stereo calibration algorithm to refine parameters based on adaptive illumination data.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Connect to Camera System
Connect to IMU
Initialize Mesh Network
Load Illumination Pattern Library

//Main Loop
While (Vehicle Operational) {
    //Environment Analysis
    Capture Camera Image
    Read IMU Data (Orientation, Velocity)
    Analyze Image for Texture, Lighting Conditions, Obstacles

    //Illumination Pattern Selection
    Select Base Pattern from Library (based on environment analysis)
    Apply Dynamic Adjustments:
        Adjust Brightness based on Ambient Light
        Shift Pattern based on Vehicle Orientation (compensate for tilt)
        Focus Illumination on Specific Features (identified in image analysis)

    //Mesh Activation
    Transmit Illumination Commands to Mesh Network

    //Calibration Routine
    Capture Stereo Images with Adaptive Illumination
    Run Stereo Calibration Algorithm
    Refine Calibration Parameters based on error metrics
}
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

The static light source in the referenced patent provides a fixed reference for initial calibration. This design addresses *dynamic* calibration, compensating for vibrations, thermal drift, and environmental changes *during* operation. The deformable mesh allows for targeted illumination, maximizing feature detection in challenging conditions and significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of stereo ranging systems. The ability to actively shape the illumination can also reveal subtle surface features, enhancing depth perception and object recognition.
