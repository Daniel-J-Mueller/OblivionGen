## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Modulation for Subsystem Health Monitoring

**Concept:** Integrate resonant frequency modulation into the power delivery system to continuously assess the health of individual vehicle subsystems *without* relying solely on direct electrical signal analysis. This builds on the existing power supply controller network but shifts the monitoring paradigm to a more passive, physics-based approach.

**Specification:**

1.  **Resonant Cavity Integration:** Each vehicle subsystem’s power connection incorporates a micro-fabricated resonant cavity tuned to a unique, pre-determined frequency. These cavities are integrated into the power connectors themselves, forming a non-intrusive part of the power delivery path. The cavity’s resonant frequency is highly sensitive to changes in the impedance of the subsystem it powers (indicating load, internal component failures, or physical stress).
2.  **Modulation & Demodulation:** The supervisor power supply controller modulates a carrier frequency transmitted *through* the main power supply lines.  This carrier frequency interacts with the resonant cavities of each subsystem.  The modulated signal's reflection/transmission characteristics change based on each cavity’s resonant frequency and any impedance shifts within that subsystem. Dedicated demodulation circuitry within each power supply controller (or integrated into the supervisor controller via multiplexing) analyzes these changes.
3.  **Baseline Calibration & Anomaly Detection:** During vehicle initialization/pre-flight checks, a baseline resonant profile is established for each subsystem. The system continuously monitors any deviation from this baseline.  Deviation thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on flight conditions (e.g., increased vibration during maneuvers).
4.  **Fault Prediction via Spectral Analysis:** Implement Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis on the reflected/transmitted signals from each resonant cavity. Subtle shifts in the spectral components can indicate *early* stage failures *before* they manifest as measurable electrical anomalies. This allows for preemptive fault mitigation.
5.  **Self-Healing Power Distribution:** In the event of a detected anomaly, the supervisor controller can intelligently redistribute power load to healthy subsystems, isolating the faulty one *without* a complete system shutdown.  This is achieved through dynamic adjustment of power supply controller settings.
6.  **Data Logging & AI Integration:** Collect resonant profile data (baseline and real-time) and feed it into a machine learning model to improve anomaly detection accuracy and predict potential failures based on historical trends.
7.  **Materials Specification:** Resonant cavities will be constructed from high-Q materials (e.g., silicon nitride, sapphire) to maximize sensitivity.  Power connectors will be designed to minimize signal interference and ensure stable resonant frequencies.



**Pseudocode (Supervisor Controller - Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Initialization
Establish baseline resonant profiles for each subsystem

// Real-time monitoring loop
For each subsystem:
    Transmit modulated carrier frequency through power line
    Receive reflected/transmitted signal
    Perform FFT analysis
    Compare current spectral profile to baseline
    Calculate anomaly score (deviation from baseline)

    If anomaly score exceeds threshold:
        Log anomaly event
        Initiate diagnostic routine
        If anomaly is critical:
            Isolate subsystem
            Redistribute power load
            Alert operator
