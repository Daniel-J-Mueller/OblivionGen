## Secure Peripheral Data Mirroring with Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the peripheral security model beyond simple storage redirection to create a continuously assessed, dynamic trust relationship between the mobile device and peripheral. This moves beyond ‘store *on* the peripheral’ to ‘mirror *with* the peripheral’, establishing redundancy *and* security.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Mobile Device: Standard smartphone/tablet with peripheral interface (USB-C, Bluetooth 5.x+, potentially UWB).
    *   Peripheral: Purpose-built device (or adaptable existing device – external SSD, specialized dongle).  Includes:
        *   Secure Element: Hardware-based security module (e.g., TPM, secure enclave).
        *   Tamper Detection: Physical tamper detection circuitry.
        *   Biometric Sensor:  Fingerprint or other biometric authentication for physical access.
        *   Connectivity:  Matches mobile device peripheral interface.
*   **Software – Mobile Device:**
    *   Data Security Module (DSM):  Existing module from provided patent, extended with Dynamic Trust Assessment (DTA) functionality.
    *   DTA Engine:  Responsible for ongoing assessment of peripheral trust.
    *   Mirroring Manager: Handles data synchronization and mirroring between device and peripheral.
    *   Encryption Module: AES-256 (or equivalent) for data-at-rest and data-in-transit.
*   **Software – Peripheral:**
    *   Secure Bootloader:  Verifies firmware integrity.
    *   Peripheral Agent: Handles communication with mobile device, encryption/decryption, and data mirroring.
    *   Tamper Detection Handler: Reports tamper events to the mobile device.
    *   Biometric Authentication Handler: Verifies physical access.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Pairing:** Mobile device initiates pairing with peripheral.  Secure channel established (e.g., Bluetooth Secure Simple Pairing, USB authentication).  Initial trust score assigned (baseline).
2.  **Continuous Trust Assessment (DTA):**
    *   **Hardware Integrity:**  Peripheral periodically reports status of tamper detection circuitry.  Any tampering event immediately reduces trust score.
    *   **Firmware Verification:** Mobile device requests cryptographic signature of peripheral firmware.  Signature verified against known good signature. Failure reduces trust score.
    *   **Biometric Verification:** Upon physical access to peripheral, biometric scan performed.  Data transmitted to mobile device for verification against registered biometric data. Successful verification increases trust score; failure reduces it.
    *   **Network Monitoring:**  Peripheral monitors its network activity. Unusual traffic patterns (e.g., excessive data exfiltration attempts) reduce trust score.
    *   **Data Consistency Checks:**  Mirroring Manager performs periodic data consistency checks between device and peripheral. Discrepancies (indicating potential tampering) reduce trust score.
3.  **Dynamic Access Control:**
    *   Data mirroring and access controlled based on current trust score.
    *   High Trust Score: Full mirroring and unrestricted access.
    *   Medium Trust Score: Limited mirroring (e.g., only non-sensitive data) and restricted access (e.g., require multi-factor authentication).
    *   Low Trust Score: Mirroring disabled, data on peripheral encrypted with key only accessible after successful biometric authentication and mobile device verification.
4.  **Data Mirroring & Synchronization:**
    *   Data mirrored to peripheral in real-time or near real-time.
    *   Encryption performed *before* data is transmitted to peripheral.
    *   Mirroring Manager manages data synchronization and conflict resolution.
5.  **Emergency Wipe:**
    *   Remote wipe capability triggered by mobile device in case of lost or stolen peripheral.

**Pseudocode (DTA Engine):**

```
function assessTrust(peripheralData) {
  trustScore = baselineTrustScore;

  if (peripheralData.tamperDetected) {
    trustScore -= tamperPenalty;
  }

  if (peripheralData.firmwareVerificationFailed) {
    trustScore -= firmwarePenalty;
  }

  if (peripheralData.biometricVerificationFailed) {
    trustScore -= biometricPenalty;
  }

  if (peripheralData.unusualNetworkActivity) {
    trustScore -= networkPenalty;
  }

  if (peripheralData.dataConsistencyError) {
    trustScore -= dataConsistencyPenalty;
  }

  trustScore = clamp(trustScore, 0, 100); // Ensure score within bounds

  return trustScore;
}

function applyAccessControl(trustScore) {
  if (trustScore > 80) {
    accessLevel = "full";
  } else if (trustScore > 50) {
    accessLevel = "limited";
  } else {
    accessLevel = "restricted";
  }

  return accessLevel;
}
```

**Innovation:** This system goes beyond simple data redirection to establish a dynamic trust relationship with the peripheral. This enables continuous security assessment and adaptive access control, enhancing data protection and reducing the risk of data breaches. This is more than storage, it's a security ecosystem.
