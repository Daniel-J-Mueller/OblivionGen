## Dynamic Workspace Mapping & Predictive Obstacle Zones

**Concept:** Augment the mobile drive unit sensor data with predictive modeling of potential obstacle *zones* – areas likely to become blocked based on historical data, scheduled events (maintenance, deliveries), and even learned patterns of human behavior.  This shifts from reactive obstacle *detection* to proactive workspace *anticipation*.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time sensor data from all mobile drive units (existing).
    *   Scheduled maintenance logs (facility management system integration).
    *   Delivery schedules (WMS/TMS integration).
    *   Historical obstacle data (database storing timestamps, locations, types of obstructions).
    *   Pedestrian/Human movement tracking (optional: camera/beacon-based, anonymized data).
*   **Obstacle Zone Generation:**
    *   **Historical Analysis:** Analyze historical obstacle data to identify frequently blocked areas and times.  Assign probability scores.
    *   **Schedule Integration:**  Overlay scheduled events (deliveries, maintenance) onto the workspace map, marking zones as potentially blocked during specific time windows.
    *   **Behavioral Modeling:** (Optional) Use machine learning to predict pedestrian/human movement patterns based on time of day, day of week, and historical data. Create “high probability congestion zones”.
    *   **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:**  Continuously update zone probabilities based on real-time sensor data. If a zone is consistently clear, its probability decreases.
*   **Path Planning Integration:**
    *   **Cost Function Modification:**  Modify the path planning algorithm’s cost function to *penalize* paths that intersect with high-probability obstacle zones.  The penalty is proportional to the zone's probability.
    *   **Multi-Path Generation:** Generate multiple potential paths, each with a different risk profile (i.e., different degrees of intersection with obstacle zones).  The resource scheduling module can then select the path that balances risk and efficiency.
    *   **Path Smoothing:**  Even if a path *must* intersect a low-probability zone, employ path smoothing techniques to minimize the time spent within that zone.
*   **Data Structure:**
    *   Workspace represented as a grid map.
    *   Each grid cell stores:
        *   Obstacle probability (0.0 – 1.0).
        *   Obstacle type (e.g., static, dynamic, scheduled).
        *   Timestamp of last update.
*   **Pseudocode (Path Planning Modification):**

```
function calculatePathCost(path, gridMap) {
  cost = 0;
  for each segment in path {
    // Base cost (distance, energy consumption, etc.)
    segmentCost = calculateBaseCost(segment);
    cost += segmentCost;

    // Add penalty for intersecting obstacle zones
    for each cell in segment {
      if (cell.obstacleProbability > 0) {
        penalty = cell.obstacleProbability * penaltyMultiplier; // penaltyMultiplier is tunable
        cost += penalty;
      }
    }
  }
  return cost;
}

function generateMultiplePaths(start, end, gridMap, numPaths) {
  paths = [];
  for (i = 0; i < numPaths; i++) {
    path = pathPlanningAlgorithm(start, end, gridMap); // Existing path planning algorithm
    paths.append(path);
  }
  return paths;
}
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Existing mobile drive unit sensors. Increased processing power on the resource scheduling module to handle the increased computational load.  Potentially a dedicated data ingestion pipeline to handle the variety of data sources.
