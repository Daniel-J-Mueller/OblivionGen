## Personalized Audio "Mood Extension" System

**System Overview:** This system extends the core audio message extraction concept by adding a dynamic emotional layer to outgoing messages. Instead of *just* delivering the spoken payload, the system modifies the audio to reflect or amplify the sender’s perceived emotional state, or even *impose* a desired emotional state, creating a more impactful communication experience.

**Core Components:**

*   **Emotion AI Module:** Real-time analysis of audio input to detect sender emotion (joy, sadness, anger, urgency, etc.). Utilizes a combination of acoustic features (pitch, tone, intensity, speech rate) *and* potentially ASR output for semantic analysis.
*   **Mood Palette:** A curated library of audio effects (EQ presets, reverb types, chorus, subtle pitch shifting, ambient soundscapes) associated with different emotional states. Each effect is designed to subtly enhance or convey a specific mood.
*   **Mood Control Interface:**  Allows the user to either accept the automatically detected mood from the Emotion AI Module, or *manually* select a desired emotional “extension” for their message. This allows for intentional emotional manipulation (e.g., adding urgency to a reminder, softening a criticism).
*   **Dynamic Audio Processor:**  Applies the selected mood extension effect to the extracted message payload.  The intensity of the effect is adjustable based on the confidence level of the emotion detection, or user preference.
*   **Recipient Profile Integration:**  Stores information about recipient preferences. Some recipients may prefer "raw" audio delivery, while others may be more receptive to emotional extensions. The system adapts accordingly.

**Technical Specifications:**

1.  **Input:** Raw audio data (as per the provided patent).
2.  **Emotion Detection:**
    *   Acoustic Feature Extraction: MFCCs, pitch, energy, spectral centroid.
    *   ASR:  Utilize a robust ASR engine to transcribe the audio (for semantic analysis).
    *   Emotion Classification: Train a machine learning model (e.g., RNN, LSTM) on a large dataset of emotionally labeled speech.
3.  **Mood Palette:**
    *   Effects: EQ presets (brightening for joy, darkening for sadness), reverb (small room for intimacy, large hall for authority), chorus (subtle for warmth, pronounced for excitement), pitch shifting (slight upshift for enthusiasm, downshift for seriousness), ambient soundscapes (rain for melancholy, birdsong for tranquility).
    *   Parameterization:  Each effect has a set of adjustable parameters (depth, intensity, frequency) to fine-tune the mood.
4.  **Dynamic Audio Processing:**
    *   Algorithm: Apply the selected mood extension effect to the extracted message payload using a digital signal processing (DSP) library.
    *   Real-time Processing: Ensure minimal latency to avoid disrupting the natural flow of the message.
5.  **Output:** Modified audio message with the applied mood extension.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processAudioMessage(audioInput, recipientProfile) {

  intent = detectMessagingIntent(audioInput)

  if (intent) {
    payload = extractMessagePayload(audioInput)

    emotion = detectEmotion(payload) // using Emotion AI Module

    // Check for user override in recipient profile
    if (recipientProfile.preferRawAudio == false) {

      moodEffect = selectMoodEffect(emotion)

      modifiedPayload = applyMoodEffect(payload, moodEffect)

    } else {
      modifiedPayload = payload
    }

    sendAudioMessage(modifiedPayload, recipientProfile)
  }
}
```

**Future Extensions:**

*   **AI-Generated Moods:**  The system could dynamically *create* mood extensions based on the context of the message and the recipient’s emotional state.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:**  Pair the audio message with subtle haptic vibrations to further enhance the emotional impact.
*   **Cross-Modal Emotion Transfer:**  Analyze other data sources (text messages, emails, social media) to create a more comprehensive emotional profile of the sender and recipient.
