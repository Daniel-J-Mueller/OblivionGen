## Dynamic Request Fingerprinting & Behavioral Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Extend the fraud detection system to not just analyze *what* is requested (characteristics of the request itself), but *how* it’s requested – the temporal patterns, request rates, and sequential dependencies within a session. This moves beyond static “fingerprints” to a dynamic, behavioral profile.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** Capture a time-series of request characteristics *per user session*. This includes:
    *   Request type (API call, resource access, etc.).
    *   Payload size.
    *   Inter-request time.
    *   Source IP address.
    *   User agent.
    *   Geographic location (derived from IP).
*   **Feature Engineering:**  Generate behavioral features from the time-series data. Examples:
    *   Request rate (requests/second).
    *   Inter-request time variance.
    *   Sequential request patterns (e.g., accessing resource A then B with high probability).  Utilize n-gram analysis on request sequences.
    *   "Burstiness" – measure the tendency to send many requests in a short period followed by inactivity.
    *   Entropy of request types (high entropy suggests unpredictable behavior).
*   **Behavioral Profiling:**
    *   Establish “normal” behavior profiles for each user (or user group) based on historical data.  Employ a sliding window approach to adapt to changing behavior over time.
    *   Use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model sequential request patterns. The HMM will learn the probability of transitioning between different request states.
    *   Maintain a baseline of statistical features (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) for each behavioral feature.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Calculate a “behavioral anomaly score” for each incoming request (or session) based on how much it deviates from the established normal profile. This score is a weighted combination of individual feature anomaly scores.
    *   Use a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on normal user behavior to identify outliers.
    *   Flag requests or sessions with anomaly scores exceeding a defined threshold.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust anomaly score thresholds based on real-time system load and known attack patterns.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate human feedback (e.g., security analyst labeling of fraudulent requests) to refine the behavioral profiles and anomaly detection algorithms.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** Modify the existing fraud score heuristic to incorporate the behavioral anomaly score as a weighting factor.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Score Calculation):**

```
function calculate_anomaly_score(request, user_profile):
  feature_anomalies = []
  for feature in user_profile.features:
    anomaly_score = calculate_feature_anomaly(request, feature)  // Uses statistical methods (Z-score, etc.)
    feature_anomalies.append(anomaly_score)

  weighted_anomaly_score = 0
  for i in range(len(feature_anomalies)):
    weighted_anomaly_score += feature_anomalies[i] * user_profile.feature_weights[i]

  return weighted_anomaly_score
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability: The system must be able to handle a high volume of requests and user sessions. Consider distributed processing and caching.
*   Real-time Performance: Anomaly detection must be performed with minimal latency.
*   Data Storage:  Efficient storage of historical request data and behavioral profiles is crucial.
*   Model Retraining:  Regularly retrain the behavioral models to adapt to evolving user behavior and attack patterns.
