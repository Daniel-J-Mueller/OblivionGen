## Dynamic Attribute Weighting & Predictive Filtering

**Concept:** Enhance search refinement by dynamically weighting attribute importance based on user interaction history *and* predicting likely refinements *before* full voice processing, leading to faster, more accurate results.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   **User Profile:**
    *   `user_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `interaction_history`: List of (search_query, refined_attribute, timestamp) tuples.  This tracks which attributes users refine *after* initial searches.
    *   `attribute_weights`: Dictionary mapping attribute names to weights (0.0 - 1.0). Initialized with uniform weights, updated via interaction history.
*   **Attribute Dependency Graph:** A directed graph representing relationships between attributes.  Nodes are attributes. Edges represent probabilistic dependencies (e.g., “if color is selected, size is likely relevant”).  Dependencies derived from product catalog data and user behavior.
*   **Refinement Prediction Model:** A trained machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or transformer) that predicts potential refined attributes based on the initial search query *and* the Attribute Dependency Graph.  Input: Initial search query string, current department. Output: Probability distribution over possible refined attributes.

**II. System Components:**

1.  **Voice Input Module:** Receives and transcribes voice input.
2.  **Initial Query Processor:**  Identifies keywords and potential department(s) (as in the base patent).
3.  **User Profile Loader:** Retrieves the user's profile (if available) or creates a new one.
4.  **Attribute Weighting Engine:**
    *   Loads the user's `attribute_weights`.
    *   Updates weights based on `interaction_history`.  (e.g., exponentially decaying average of attribute refinement frequency).
    *   Normalizes weights to sum to 1.0.
5.  **Refinement Prediction Engine:**
    *   Takes initial query & current department as input.
    *   Consults the Attribute Dependency Graph.
    *   Runs the Refinement Prediction Model.
    *   Outputs a ranked list of predicted refined attributes.
6.  **Hybrid Filtering Engine:**
    *   Receives user’s voice input *and* the ranked list from the Refinement Prediction Engine.
    *   Simultaneously processes the voice input (as in the base patent) *and* pre-filters results based on the top-N predicted attributes. This allows parallel processing.
    *   Combines results from voice processing and pre-filtering using a weighted scoring system.  The weights are based on the confidence score of the voice processing *and* the prediction confidence score.
7.  **Result Ranking & Presentation:**  Ranks the final results and presents them to the user.

**III. Pseudocode – Hybrid Filtering Engine:**

```
function hybrid_filter(voice_input, predicted_attributes, current_department, catalog):
  // Process voice input (as per base patent)
  voice_results = process_voice_input(voice_input, catalog, current_department)
  voice_confidence = voice_results.confidence

  // Pre-filter based on predicted attributes
  prefiltered_results = []
  for attribute in predicted_attributes:
    temp_results = filter_catalog(catalog, attribute, voice_input) //Uses the voice input as a secondary filter
    prefiltered_results.append(temp_results)

  // Combine results
  combined_results = []
  for result in voice_results.results:
    combined_results.append(result)

  for result in prefiltered_results:
    combined_results.append(result)

  // Score and rank results (weighting based on confidence)
  ranked_results = rank_results(combined_results, voice_confidence, prediction_confidence)
  return ranked_results
```

**IV.  Novelty:**

This system moves beyond reactive refinement (responding *after* the user speaks) to *predictive* refinement. It utilizes user history and attribute dependencies to anticipate likely refinements, enabling parallel processing and potentially faster, more accurate results.  The dynamic weighting of attributes personalizes the search experience. The fusion of prediction and reactive filtering creates a hybrid approach offering the benefits of both.
