## Modular Spherical Rotor Arrays for 3D Object Sorting

**Concept:** Expand the single-axis rotation of spherical rotors into a configurable 3D sorting matrix. Instead of diverting objects laterally on a 2D plane, utilize a dense array of individually controlled spherical rotors to 'sculpt' a 3D force field, guiding objects in any direction.

**Specs:**

*   **Rotor Modules:** Spherical rotors, 15cm diameter, constructed with a paramagnetic core containing distributed, high-density ferrous slugs. Outer shell: high-impact polymer. Each rotor has an integrated Hall effect sensor to provide precise rotational feedback.
*   **Module Arrangement:**  Hexagonal close-packing arrangement within a 1m x 1m x 1m cubic frame. Each module is independently mounted and can rotate 360 degrees around its central axis. Approximately 500-700 modules per cubic meter.
*   **Drive System:**  Each module driven by a miniature brushless DC motor with integrated planetary gearbox.  Motors connected to a distributed power and control network.
*   **Control System:**  A multi-core processor-based controller with real-time image processing capabilities. Input from overhead cameras (stereoscopic vision) to track object position and velocity. The controller calculates the required force field to guide objects to designated destinations.
*   **Force Field Generation:**  The controller adjusts the rotational speed and direction of each spherical rotor.  Ferrous slugs within rotors create localized magnetic fields. By precisely controlling these fields, an object is ‘held’ and guided through the array.  Object guidance accomplished through a combination of attraction, repulsion, and deflection.
*   **Power Delivery:** Wireless power transfer (inductive coupling) to each rotor module to eliminate wiring complexity and enable modularity.
*   **Object Detection:** Utilize time-of-flight sensors integrated into the frame to detect object presence and size, adjusting the force field accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Object Guidance):**

```
// Input: Object position (x, y, z), target position (x_target, y_target, z_target)
// Output: Array of rotor speeds (rotor_speed[i])

function guideObject(x, y, z, x_target, y_target, z_target) {

  // Calculate vector from object to target
  vectorToTarget = (x_target - x, y_target - y, z_target - z)

  // Calculate force required to move object along vector
  force = normalize(vectorToTarget) * acceleration

  // Assign force components to nearest rotors
  for (i = 0; i < numRotors; i++) {
    distance = calculateDistance(objectPosition, rotorPosition[i])
    influence = 1 / distance^2  // Inverse square law

    // Calculate force component to apply to this rotor
    forceComponent = force * influence

    // Calculate rotor speed based on force component
    rotorSpeed[i] = calculateRotorSpeed(forceComponent)
    rotorDirection[i] = calculateRotorDirection(forceComponent)
  }

  return (rotorSpeed, rotorDirection)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-speed, 3D package sorting in fulfillment centers.
*   Automated assembly of complex products.
*   Robotic manipulation of fragile objects.
*   Dynamic obstacle avoidance for autonomous vehicles.
*   Creation of complex geometries with granular materials.
