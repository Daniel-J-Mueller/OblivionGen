## Adaptive Multi-Hop Mesh for Low-Latency Streaming

**Concept:** Extend the patent's network selection logic beyond direct AP-to-device connections to a dynamic, self-healing mesh network. This aims to provide *guaranteed* low latency and increased robustness for streaming video, especially in dense environments or areas with interference.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Types:**
    *   **Streaming Client:** The device receiving the video stream (like the 'first streaming video device' in the patent).
    *   **Edge Node:** APs (like the 'first AP', 'second AP', 'third AP' in the patent) that can act as relays. These nodes must be capable of basic mesh networking functionality (802.11s or similar).
    *   **Source Node:** The device originating the video stream (the DVR in the patent).

*   **Discovery & Beaconing:** Each node periodically broadcasts a beacon containing:
    *   Node ID
    *   Available Frequency Bands
    *   Estimated Link Quality (Signal Strength, Throughput, Congestion) – derived from continuous monitoring.
    *   Hop Count (initialized to 0 for the Source Node, incremented for each hop).
    *   Latency Estimate (calculated based on recent packet transmission times).

*   **Path Calculation (Client-Side):**
    *   The Streaming Client maintains a constantly updated graph of the network topology based on received beacons.
    *   Upon stream initiation, the Client runs a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the lowest-latency path to the Source Node, *considering both bandwidth and hop count*.  A weighting factor allows prioritization of low hop count over higher bandwidth if necessary.
    *   The algorithm dynamically adjusts based on reported link qualities and latency estimates.

*   **Dynamic Path Switching:**
    *   The Client continuously monitors the performance of the current path (packet loss, jitter, latency).
    *   If performance degrades below a threshold, the Client re-runs the path calculation algorithm.
    *   Seamless path switching is achieved using a dual-path approach: maintaining a secondary path in parallel for a short period to validate its performance *before* fully switching over.

*   **Bandwidth Negotiation:**
    *   Each hop in the path negotiates bandwidth allocation with its neighbors. This prevents congestion and ensures smooth streaming.
    *   Quality of Service (QoS) prioritization is used to prioritize video traffic over other network traffic.

*   **Remote Control Integration:** The remote control device acts as a 'path quality reporter'. It periodically transmits beacon-like signals reflecting its own connection quality to the Streaming Client. This helps the Client identify potential bottlenecks or weak links in the path *from the user's perspective*.

*   **Self-Healing:** Nodes can detect and report link failures to their neighbors. The network automatically re-routes traffic around failed nodes.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Path Calculation):**

```
function calculateBestPath(sourceNode, destinationNode):
  // Initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except source
  distances = {}
  for node in networkGraph:
    distances[node] = infinity
  distances[sourceNode] = 0

  // Initialize visited set
  visited = {}

  while unvisited nodes exist:
    // Select unvisited node with smallest distance
    currentNode = selectMinDistanceNode(distances, visited)
    visited[currentNode] = True

    // Update distances to neighbors
    for neighbor in getNeighbors(currentNode):
      //Calculate potential distance through current node
      potentialDistance = distances[currentNode] + getLinkCost(currentNode, neighbor)

      //If potential distance is shorter than current distance to neighbor
      if potentialDistance < distances[neighbor]:
        distances[neighbor] = potentialDistance
        previousNode[neighbor] = currentNode

  //Return the path and cost
  return reconstructPath(destinationNode, previousNode), distances[destinationNode]

function reconstructPath(destinationNode, previousNode):
  path = []
  currentNode = destinationNode
  while currentNode is not None:
    path.insert(0, currentNode)
    currentNode = previousNode[currentNode]
  return path
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Path Prediction:** Use machine learning to predict network congestion and proactively adjust the path before performance degrades.
*   **Multi-Radio Support:** Utilize multiple radio interfaces on each node to create parallel paths and increase bandwidth.
*   **Integration with Edge Computing:** Offload video processing tasks to edge servers to reduce latency and improve video quality.
