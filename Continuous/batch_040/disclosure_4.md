## Dynamic Resource Mirroring & Federation

**Concept:** Extend the virtual directory concept beyond simple resource *representation* to active, dynamic *mirroring* and federation of resources across web service accounts, facilitating near-real-time data synchronization and collaborative workflows.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Mirroring Engine:** A service component responsible for monitoring changes within a source directory and replicating those changes to a mirrored virtual directory. Operates on a configurable schedule (real-time, near-real-time, scheduled).
*   **Federation Manager:** A service component enabling the creation of "federated views" comprised of resources originating from multiple source directories (potentially belonging to different web service accounts) combined into a single virtual directory.
*   **Conflict Resolution Module:**  A system for handling conflicts arising during mirroring or federation.  Strategies include: Last Write Wins, Timestamp Prioritization, User-Defined Resolution Rules, and Request for Manual Intervention.
*   **Access Control Layer (Extended):** Modification to existing access control to support fine-grained permissions on mirrored/federated resources.  Permissions can be inherited from source or defined specifically for the virtual directory.
*   **Change Tracking System:** Logs all changes made to mirrored/federated resources for auditing, debugging, and potential rollback.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Configuration:**  Admin defines a mirroring/federation policy.  This includes:
    *   Source Directory (and Account).
    *   Destination Virtual Directory (and Account).
    *   Mirroring/Federation Strategy (Full, Incremental, Selective).
    *   Conflict Resolution Rules.
    *   Synchronization Schedule.
    *   Access Control Policies for the Virtual Directory.
2.  **Synchronization:** The Mirroring Engine monitors the source directory for changes. Upon detection, changes are replicated to the virtual directory.  Incremental synchronization leverages change tracking to minimize data transfer.
3.  **Access:** Users/Applications access resources through the virtual directory. The Access Control Layer enforces permissions defined in the configuration.
4.  **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicts arise during synchronization, the Conflict Resolution Module applies the configured rules.
5.  **Auditing:** All changes and conflict resolutions are logged in the Change Tracking System.

**III. Pseudocode - Mirroring Engine (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
function mirrorDirectory(sourceDirectory, virtualDirectory, synchronizationInterval) {
  while (true) {
    // 1. Get changes since last synchronization
    changes = getChanges(sourceDirectory, lastSyncTimestamp);

    // 2. For each change:
    for each change in changes {
      // 3. Determine operation type (Create, Update, Delete)
      operationType = change.operationType;

      // 4. Apply operation to virtual directory
      if (operationType == "Create") {
        createResource(virtualDirectory, change.resource);
      } else if (operationType == "Update") {
        updateResource(virtualDirectory, change.resource);
      } else if (operationType == "Delete") {
        deleteResource(virtualDirectory, change.resource);
      }
    }

    // 5. Update last synchronization timestamp
    lastSyncTimestamp = currentTime();

    // 6. Wait for synchronization interval
    sleep(synchronizationInterval);
  }
}
```

**IV. Extensions & Considerations:**

*   **Cross-Region Replication:** Extend mirroring/federation to span different geographic regions.
*   **Data Transformation:** Incorporate data transformation capabilities during synchronization.
*   **Real-Time Collaboration:** Support real-time collaborative editing of synchronized resources.
*   **Version Control:** Integrate version control to track changes and enable rollbacks.
*   **Granular Synchronization:** Allow synchronization of specific resource types or attributes.
*   **Automated Policy Enforcement:** Employ AI/ML to analyze usage patterns and automatically adjust synchronization policies.
