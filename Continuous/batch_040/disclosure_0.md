## Adaptive Timer Granularity & Contextual Payload Shifting

**Concept:** Extend the virtual partitioning concept to dynamically adjust timer granularity *within* partitions, and introduce a mechanism for contextually shifting payload execution based on system load & resource availability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Granularity Profiles:**

*   Each virtual partition maintains a set of “Granularity Profiles”.
*   A Granularity Profile defines the minimum time resolution for timers stored within it (e.g., 1ms, 10ms, 100ms, 1s).
*   The system dynamically selects the appropriate Granularity Profile for a timer based on its expiration time. Shorter-lived timers utilize finer-grained profiles, longer-lived timers coarser profiles.
*   Profile selection is a background process, migrating timers between profiles as needed. Migration involves re-queueing the timer record with updated metadata.

**2. Contextual Payload Shifting (CPS):**

*   Timer payloads are categorized based on resource needs (CPU, Memory, Network).
*   A “Resource Availability Monitor” continuously tracks system load.
*   A “Payload Shifter” intercepts payload execution requests.
*   Based on current system load and payload resource needs, the Payload Shifter can:
    *   **Defer Execution:** Delay the payload for a short period.
    *   **Throttle Execution:** Reduce the priority of the payload process.
    *   **Redirect Execution:** Send the payload to a secondary, less loaded system (if available).
    *   **Downscale Execution:** Execute a simplified version of the payload (if multiple versions exist).

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Timer Record Enhancement:** Add fields to the timer record to store:
    *   Original Granularity Profile
    *   Current Granularity Profile
    *   Payload Resource Requirements (CPU, Memory, Network)
    *   Payload Version (for downscaling)
*   **Sweeper Worker Modification:** The sweeper worker should:
    *   Monitor timer expirations within its assigned virtual partition.
    *   Trigger granularity profile adjustments as needed.
*   **Payload Shifter Component:** A dedicated component responsible for intercepting payload execution requests and applying the appropriate resource management strategies.
*   **Resource Availability Monitor:** Monitors system resource utilization (CPU, Memory, Network) and publishes this information to the Payload Shifter.

**Pseudocode (Payload Shifter):**

```
function executePayload(timerRecord):
    resourceNeeds = timerRecord.resourceNeeds
    systemLoad = ResourceAvailabilityMonitor.getSystemLoad()

    if systemLoad > threshold:
        if resourceNeeds.priority == "low":
            deferExecution(timerRecord)
        elif resourceNeeds.priority == "medium":
            throttleExecution(timerRecord)
        else:
            // High priority - execute immediately
            executePayloadDirectly(timerRecord)
    else:
        executePayloadDirectly(timerRecord)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced system load by optimizing timer granularity.
*   Improved system stability and responsiveness under heavy load.
*   Increased resource utilization by dynamically adapting to system conditions.
*   Enhanced scalability by distributing load across multiple systems (with redirection).
