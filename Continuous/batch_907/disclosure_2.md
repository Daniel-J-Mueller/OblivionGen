## Dynamic Hazard Prediction via Multi-Agent Simulation & Federated Learning

**Concept:** Extend the virtual track data to include not just *observed* vehicle maneuvers and potential hazards, but *predicted* hazard probabilities derived from a continuously running, federated multi-agent simulation. This allows proactive hazard avoidance beyond simply reacting to previously recorded events.

**System Specs:**

*   **Federated Simulation Network:** A distributed network of vehicle-embedded simulators (VES). Each VES runs a localized, high-fidelity simulation of the immediate environment (100m radius), incorporating real-time sensor data from the host vehicle, virtual track data (from the core system), and historical traffic patterns.
*   **Agent Model:** Within each VES, individual agents represent vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and other dynamic entities. Agents utilize behavioral models informed by both real-world data and learned patterns from the virtual track. These models will simulate realistic driving/movement behaviors.
*   **Data Exchange Protocol:** VES periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds) transmit aggregated *hazard probability maps* to a central server. These maps represent the likelihood of specific hazard events occurring within the simulation horizon (e.g., a pedestrian crossing the street, a vehicle changing lanes abruptly). *Raw simulation data is not transmitted*. Only aggregated hazard probabilities.
*   **Central Hazard Map Fusion:** The central server fuses the hazard probability maps received from multiple vehicles, weighting contributions based on data quality, vehicle density, and environmental conditions (weather, time of day). This creates a high-resolution, real-time hazard prediction map.
*   **Virtual Track Data Augmentation:** The central hazard prediction map is integrated into the virtual track data, adding a layer of *proactive* hazard information. This goes beyond simply annotating locations where hazards *have* occurred; it *predicts* where they *might* occur.
*   **Autonomous Vehicle Integration:** The autonomous vehicle receives the augmented virtual track data and uses it to adjust its driving behavior *before* a potential hazard materializes. This could involve reducing speed, changing lanes, or increasing following distance.

**Pseudocode (Autonomous Vehicle Control Logic):**

```
// Receive augmented virtual track data (VTD) with hazard probabilities (HP)

function controlVehicle(sensorData, VTD) {
  // Analyze sensor data to detect immediate hazards
  immediateHazards = detectImmediateHazards(sensorData);

  // Evaluate predicted hazards from VTD
  predictedHazards = evaluatePredictedHazards(VTD.HP, sensorData.position);

  // Combine immediate and predicted hazards
  combinedHazards = combineHazards(immediateHazards, predictedHazards);

  // Adjust driving behavior based on combined hazards
  if (combinedHazards.severity > threshold) {
    // Initiate avoidance maneuver (e.g., braking, lane change)
    performAvoidanceManeuver(combinedHazards.type);
  } else {
    // Maintain current driving behavior
    maintainDrivingBehavior();
  }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance embedded processors in each vehicle for running the VES.
*   Secure communication channels for transmitting hazard probability maps.
*   Central server with sufficient processing power and storage capacity for fusing data from multiple vehicles.
