## Temporal Drift Compensation via Adaptive Resonance

**Concept:** Expand on the probabilistic decision-making framework to create a system that actively compensates for ‘temporal drift’ in input data streams, specifically targeting applications where data meaning subtly changes over time (e.g., sensor networks, financial modeling, long-form content analysis).  The core idea is to dynamically adjust the probabilistic thresholds based on a rolling window of recent data, effectively ‘learning’ the expected drift rate and mitigating its impact on classification accuracy.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Adaptive Resonance Unit (ARU) – adds to the existing probabilistic circuit.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `input_data`: The primary data stream.
    *   `weight`:  As defined in the source patent.
    *   `drift_rate_alpha`: A tuning parameter controlling responsiveness to drift. (0.0-1.0)
    *   `history_window`:  Size of the rolling window for drift calculation.
*   **Internal Components:**
    *   **Drift Estimator:**
        *   Maintains a rolling window of `history_window` data points.
        *   Calculates a ‘drift score’ based on the variance of classifications within the window. Higher variance implies faster drift. Can be a simple standard deviation or a more sophisticated metric.
        *   Applies exponential smoothing to the drift score with a smoothing factor determined by `drift_rate_alpha`.
    *   **Threshold Adjuster:**
        *   Receives the drift score from the Drift Estimator.
        *   Dynamically adjusts the comparison thresholds within the probabilistic circuit (as defined in Claim 2).  The adjustment is proportional to the drift score.  Higher drift scores lead to wider thresholds, allowing the system to tolerate more variation in input data.
        *   Threshold Adjustment Formula: `adjusted_threshold = base_threshold + (drift_score * threshold_sensitivity)` where `threshold_sensitivity` is a fixed tuning parameter.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   `output_data`: As defined in the source patent, but now incorporating the dynamically adjusted probabilistic thresholds.
    *   `drift_score`:  The calculated drift score, for monitoring and potential system-level adjustments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function AdaptiveResonanceUnit(input_data, weight, drift_rate_alpha, history_window):
    // Initialize rolling window
    window = []

    // Calculate Drift Score
    function CalculateDriftScore(window, drift_rate_alpha):
        // Calculate variance of classifications in window
        variance = CalculateVariance(window)
        // Apply exponential smoothing
        drift_score = (1 - drift_rate_alpha) * previous_drift_score + drift_rate_alpha * variance
        return drift_score

    // Adjust Thresholds
    function AdjustThresholds(base_threshold, drift_score, threshold_sensitivity):
        adjusted_threshold = base_threshold + (drift_score * threshold_sensitivity)
        return adjusted_threshold

    // Main Processing Loop
    while data_stream_active:
        // Append current data to window
        window.append(input_data)
        if length(window) > history_window:
            window.remove(window[0])

        // Calculate Drift Score
        drift_score = CalculateDriftScore(window, drift_rate_alpha)

        // Adjust Thresholds
        adjusted_threshold = AdjustThresholds(base_threshold, drift_score, threshold_sensitivity)

        //Probabilistic circuit operates with adjusted_threshold (as per source patent)
        output_data = ProbabilisticCircuit(input_data, weight, adjusted_threshold)

        //Output results
        return output_data, drift_score
```
