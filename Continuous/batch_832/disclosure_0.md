## Adaptive Data Stream ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive sampling concept to create ‘shadow’ data streams, not just for monitoring, but for predictive load balancing across multiple monitoring systems. Instead of *just* reducing load on a single monitoring system, we proactively distribute anticipated load based on stream content analysis.

**Specification:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Stream Source(s):**  Any system generating time series data (as in the base patent).
*   **Adaptive Sampling & Shadowing Module (ASSM):**  This module replaces the existing sampling logic.  It analyzes incoming data streams *before* sampling.
*   **Multiple Monitoring Systems (MMS):**  A cluster of monitoring systems (minimum of 3) capable of receiving and processing time series data. Each MMS has a defined capacity (transactions per second, CPU usage, memory, etc.).
*   **Load Prediction Engine (LPE):**  A component within the ASSM responsible for predicting the load each MMS will experience based on the content of the incoming data stream.
*   **Dynamic Routing Table (DRT):**  A table maintained by the ASSM that maps data stream segments to specific MMS based on predicted load and MMS capacity.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Stream Ingestion:**  Data streams are received by the ASSM.
2.  **Content Analysis:**  The ASSM analyzes the incoming data stream (e.g., identifying item types, frequency of events, severity levels, correlated metrics).  This is a critical step—we aren't just looking at *rate* of data, but *what* the data represents.
3.  **Load Prediction:** The LPE, using historical data and real-time stream analysis, predicts the computational cost of processing each segment of the data stream on each MMS.  Different item types have different processing costs. High-severity events cost more. Correlated metrics might trigger cascade processing.
4.  **DRT Update:** Based on the load predictions and MMS capacity, the DRT is dynamically updated. Segments of the data stream are assigned to the MMS with the lowest predicted load.
5.  **Adaptive Sampling (as in base patent):** If the total incoming rate exceeds the combined capacity of the MMS, adaptive sampling is applied *before* routing to individual MMS.  The base patent’s logic for protecting certain item types still applies.
6.  **Data Routing:** Data segments are routed to the assigned MMS.
7.  **MMS Processing:** Each MMS processes the data segments it receives, generating performance metrics.

**III. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// ASSM Core Loop

FOR each incoming data segment:
    AnalyzeSegment(segment)  // Extract ItemTypes, Severity, Correlation
    PredictLoad(segment, MMS1, MMS2, MMS3)  // Calculate load for each MMS
    AssignToMMS(segment, MMS with lowest predicted load)
    IF TotalIncomingRate > CombinedMMSCapacity:
        ApplyAdaptiveSampling(data stream)
    RouteSegment(segment, assigned MMS)

//PredictLoad function
FUNCTION PredictLoad(segment, MMS):
    cost = 0
    FOR each item in segment:
        cost += ItemCost(item)  // Lookup table for item processing cost
    return cost

//ItemCost function:
FUNCTION ItemCost(item):
    IF item.type == "HighSeverityAlert":
        return 10
    ELSE IF item.type == "CorrelatedMetric":
        return 5
    ELSE:
        return 1
```

**IV. Novel Aspects:**

*   **Proactive Load Balancing:**  Shifts from reactive sampling to proactive distribution of workload.
*   **Content-Aware Routing:**  Routes data based on *what* the data is, not just *how much* there is.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Uses historical data and real-time analysis to anticipate load on each MMS.
*   **Scalability:**  Easily scales by adding more MMS to the cluster.
