## Dynamic Wavelength Allocation via Integrated Micro-Ring Resonators

**System Overview:**

The goal is to create an optical transceiver capable of *dynamically* allocating wavelengths to multiple server racks, moving beyond simple switching between pre-defined paths. This builds upon the concept of built-in optical switching but introduces granular control over individual wavelengths, enhancing bandwidth utilization and network flexibility.

**Core Component:** Integrated Silicon Photonics Micro-Ring Resonators (MRRs).

*   **Quantity:** Array of 16-64 MRRs (scalable based on rack density & bandwidth needs) fabricated on a single silicon photonic integrated circuit (PIC).
*   **Wavelength Range:** C-band (1530-1565nm), with potential expansion to L-band.
*   **Tunability:** Each MRR is thermally or electrically tunable across a narrow bandwidth (~50-100GHz) to selectively add or drop specific wavelengths.
*   **Coupling:** MRRs are coupled to a shared input/output waveguide via Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs). MZIs act as optical switches, controlling whether a wavelength passes through a specific MRR.

**Transceiver Architecture:**

1.  **Input Stage:** High-bandwidth optical signal entering the transceiver.
2.  **Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM):** Divides the input signal into individual wavelengths.
3.  **MRR Array:** This is the core of the dynamic allocation system. Each MRR is responsible for routing a specific wavelength to the appropriate server rack.
4.  **Optical Amplifiers (Optional):** Integrated amplifiers to compensate for insertion loss within the PIC.
5.  **Output Stage:** Multiplexed output signals directed to the server racks.
6.  **Control System:** A microcontroller embedded within the transceiver (or external controller).

**Control Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
//Data Structures
Rack_Request = {Rack_ID, Wavelength_Needed, Bandwidth_Request}
MRR_State = {MRR_ID, Tuned_Wavelength, Connected_Rack}

//Initialization
Initialize MRR_State for all MRRs: Tuned_Wavelength = default, Connected_Rack = NULL

//Main Loop
While (Network Active) {
    //Monitor Rack Requests
    For Each Rack in Network {
        If (Rack has new Request) {
            Rack_Request = Get Rack Request
            //Find Available MRR
            MRR = Find Available MRR (matching wavelength & bandwidth)
            If (MRR Found) {
                //Tune MRR to Request Wavelength
                Tune_MRR(MRR, Rack_Request.Wavelength_Needed)
                //Connect MRR to Rack
                Connect_MRR_to_Rack(MRR, Rack_Request.Rack_ID)
                //Update MRR State
                MRR.Connected_Rack = Rack_Request.Rack_ID
            } Else {
                //Request Queueing/Negotiation (Outside scope of this design)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Rate:** 400Gbps – 800Gbps per wavelength.
*   **Channel Spacing:** 100GHz – 200GHz.
*   **Switching Time:** < 100 microseconds per wavelength.
*   **Power Consumption:** < 5 Watts.
*   **Integration:** Silicon Photonics PIC.
*   **Control Interface:** I2C/SPI.
*   **Operating Temperature:** 0°C to 70°C.

**Novelty:** This differs from simple optical switching by enabling *granular wavelength allocation*. Rather than switching entire paths, it allows the transceiver to dynamically assign individual wavelengths to different racks based on real-time demand, maximizing bandwidth efficiency and supporting flexible network topologies. The use of MRRs provides a compact and energy-efficient solution for wavelength selection. This creates a network that isn't merely reactive, but anticipatory to some extent.
