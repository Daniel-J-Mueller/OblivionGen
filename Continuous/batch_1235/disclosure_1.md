## Dynamic Offer Sequencing via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biometric data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial muscle tension) into the offer sequencing algorithm. This allows the system to dynamically adjust offers *during* a program segment, rather than simply switching to the next segment after a decline.  The goal is to optimize engagement and increase the likelihood of acceptance by tailoring the experience to the customer's *immediate* emotional state.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Sensor Integration:**
    *   Support for integration with commercially available biometric sensors (wearables, webcams with emotion detection, dedicated skin conductance sensors).
    *   API for data ingestion and normalization. Data must be pre-processed to remove noise and artifacts.
    *   Secure data transmission and storage, adhering to privacy regulations.

2.  **Emotional State Model:**
    *   Develop a model mapping biometric data to emotional states (e.g., interest, frustration, excitement, anxiety).  This can be achieved through machine learning, trained on labeled biometric data.
    *   Model should output a probability distribution over emotional states.

3.  **Dynamic Offer Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   **Core Logic:**  The algorithm continuously monitors the customer's emotional state *during* a single program segment.
    *   **Adjustment Triggers:**
        *   **High Frustration:** If frustration levels exceed a threshold, the algorithm presents a "cooling off" option (e.g., a short video, a humorous distraction, a simpler offer) *before* withdrawing the offer.
        *   **Low Interest:** If interest is consistently low, the algorithm can subtly adjust the offer itself (e.g., change the presented image, offer a smaller discount, highlight different features).  This happens *within* the segment, before prompting a decline.
        *   **High Interest/Excitement:**  If the customer exhibits high engagement, the algorithm can immediately present a more aggressive offer (e.g., a limited-time bonus, a complementary product).
    *   **Offer "Micro-Adjustments":** The algorithm must be capable of making small changes to the offer parameters in real-time without requiring a full page reload.  This includes text, images, prices, and call-to-action buttons.
    *   **A/B Testing Framework:** Integrated A/B testing to compare the performance of the dynamic offer adjustment algorithm against the static offer sequencing approach.

4.  **User Interface (UI) Considerations:**
    *   Minimal UI elements related to biometric data collection and processing.
    *   Clear visual feedback to the customer regarding the progress of the current offer segment.
    *   Option for the customer to opt-out of biometric data collection.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
sensor = InitializeBiometricSensor()
emotionModel = LoadEmotionModel()

// Main Loop (within a program segment)
while (timeLimitNotReached() && offerNotAccepted() && offerNotDeclined()) {
  biometricData = sensor.readData()
  emotionState = emotionModel.predict(biometricData)

  if (emotionState.frustration > frustrationThreshold) {
    displayCoolingOffOption()
    pauseExecution(5 seconds)
  } else if (emotionState.interest < interestThreshold) {
    adjustOffer(emotionState) // Modify offer based on emotional state
  } else if (emotionState.excitement > excitementThreshold) {
    presentAggressiveOffer()
  } else {
    // Default: display offer as configured
    displayOffer()
  }

  // Check for user input (accept/decline)
  userInput = getUserInput()
  if (userInput == "accept") {
    processPurchase()
    break
  } else if (userInput == "decline") {
    break
  }

  delay(100 milliseconds)
}

if (offerNotAccepted()) {
  withdrawOffer()
}
```

This adaptation moves beyond static sequencing and introduces a reactive system. It's less about predicting what the customer *will* like and more about adapting the experience *as* they're interacting with it.
