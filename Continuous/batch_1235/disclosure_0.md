## Dynamic Attribute Weighting for Cluster Refinement

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust attribute weights within the cluster detection application, based on real-time feedback from item classification performance.

**Core Concept:** The patent centers around identifying user affinity through purchase history. This adaptation aims to *improve* cluster quality by allowing the system to learn which attributes are *most* predictive of genuine affinity, and adjust weighting accordingly. Currently, thresholds seem static. This introduces dynamism.

**System Components:**

1.  **Performance Monitor:**  Continuously tracks the accuracy of item classification. Specifically, it monitors how frequently items assigned to a cluster *should* have been assigned, as determined by manual review (initially) and then by subsequent user interactions (e.g., returns, negative feedback).  Accuracy is measured as a 'Cluster Confidence Score' (CCS).

2.  **Attribute Weight Adjustment Module:**  This module receives CCS data from the Performance Monitor.  For each cluster, it analyzes which attributes contributed most strongly to its formation. If CCS is low, it *reduces* the weight of the contributing attributes. If CCS is high, it *increases* their weight.

3.  **Attribute Vector:** Each product will now be associated with an attribute vector containing all potential attributes, but with associated weights.  These weights are initialized equally, then adjusted by the Attribute Weight Adjustment Module.

4.  **Dynamic Threshold Calculation:** The initial threshold percentages (for purchase history and opposing attributes) are no longer fixed. They are calculated dynamically based on the weighted attributes within each cluster.  Clusters with high-weighted attributes will have more stringent threshold requirements.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
FOR each product P in database:
    Initialize Attribute Vector AV(P) with all potential attributes, weight = 1

// Real-time Monitoring
WHILE system running:
    Monitor Item Classification Accuracy -> Calculate CCS for each cluster
    
    // Attribute Weight Adjustment
    FOR each cluster C:
        IF CCS(C) < threshold_low:
            FOR each attribute A contributing to C:
                Reduce weight(A) in AV(products in C) by factor alpha
        ELSE IF CCS(C) > threshold_high:
            FOR each attribute A contributing to C:
                Increase weight(A) in AV(products in C) by factor beta

        //Dynamic Threshold Calculation
        Calculate new purchase_threshold based on sum of weights of attributes in cluster
        Calculate new opposing_attribute_threshold based on sum of weights of attributes in cluster
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Cluster:**  {Cluster ID, Products, Attributes, CCS, Attribute Weights}
*   **Product:** {Product ID, Attributes, Attribute Vector}

**Engineer Notes:**

*   The values of `alpha` and `beta` (reduction/increase factors) will require experimentation and tuning.
*   The `threshold_low` and `threshold_high` values for CCS will also require tuning.
*   Consider implementing a decay function for attribute weights to prevent them from becoming excessively dominant.
*   The system should be designed to handle a large number of attributes and products efficiently.
*   Implement logging and monitoring to track attribute weight changes and CCS values.
