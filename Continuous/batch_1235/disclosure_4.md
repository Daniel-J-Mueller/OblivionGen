## Adaptive Frequency-Based Stabilization Blending

**Concept:** Enhance stabilization by dynamically weighting OIS and EIS contributions not just on *amplitude* of excursion, but also on the *frequency* of the movement. High-frequency jitters are often better addressed by EIS due to its responsiveness, while lower frequencies benefit from the smoother correction of OIS. This system will actively *blend* between these systems based on a real-time spectral analysis of the movement data.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** High-precision 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – gyroscope *and* accelerometer – sampling at minimum 200Hz.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated Digital Signal Processor (DSP) or FPGA for real-time spectral analysis and stabilization control.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Frequency Domain Analysis:** Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) module to analyze the raw IMU data and identify dominant frequencies of camera movement.
    *   **Bandpass Filter Array:**  A configurable array of bandpass filters to isolate specific frequency ranges (e.g., <5Hz, 5-20Hz, >20Hz).
    *   **Weighting Function:** A dynamic weighting function that assigns a stabilization weight (0.0 to 1.0) to both OIS and EIS based on the energy detected within each frequency band. 
        *   High energy in low-frequency bands (<5Hz) = Higher OIS weight.
        *   High energy in high-frequency bands (>20Hz) = Higher EIS weight.
        *   Mid-range frequencies (5-20Hz) =  Balanced weighting, potentially with a dynamic adjustment based on amplitude.
    *   **Stabilization Control:** Module to apply the calculated weights to the OIS and EIS systems, controlling their respective levels of correction.
*   **OIS/EIS Interface:**  Communication protocol (e.g., SPI, I2C) to control the OIS and EIS drivers. Must support granular control of correction strength.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Automated calibration process to account for sensor biases, mounting imperfections, and system-specific characteristics.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Incorporate a machine learning component (e.g., reinforcement learning) to optimize the weighting function based on user feedback and observed stabilization performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
IMU_Sample_Rate = 200Hz
FFT_Size = 1024
Frequency_Bands = {Low: <5Hz, Mid: 5-20Hz, High: >20Hz}

// Main Loop
while (Camera_Active) {
  // 1. Acquire IMU Data
  IMU_Data = Read_IMU()

  // 2. Perform FFT Analysis
  Frequency_Spectrum = FFT(IMU_Data, FFT_Size)

  // 3. Calculate Energy in Each Frequency Band
  Energy_Low = Calculate_Energy(Frequency_Spectrum, Frequency_Bands.Low)
  Energy_Mid = Calculate_Energy(Frequency_Spectrum, Frequency_Bands.Mid)
  Energy_High = Calculate_Energy(Frequency_Spectrum, Frequency_Bands.High)

  // 4. Normalize Energy Levels
  Total_Energy = Energy_Low + Energy_Mid + Energy_High
  Normalized_Low = Energy_Low / Total_Energy
  Normalized_Mid = Energy_Mid / Total_Energy
  Normalized_High = Energy_High / Total_Energy

  // 5. Calculate OIS/EIS Weights
  OIS_Weight = Normalized_Low * 0.6 + Normalized_Mid * 0.2
  EIS_Weight = Normalized_High * 0.7 + Normalized_Mid * 0.3

  // 6. Apply Weights to OIS/EIS Systems
  Set_OIS_Strength(OIS_Weight)
  Set_EIS_Strength(EIS_Weight)
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Scene Detection:** Integrate scene detection algorithms to adjust stabilization parameters based on the type of scene (e.g., static, panning, zooming).
*   **User Profiles:** Allow users to customize stabilization preferences based on their shooting style and preferences.
*   **Advanced Filtering:** Explore more advanced filtering techniques, such as Kalman filtering, to further reduce noise and improve stabilization accuracy.
