## Dynamic Encoding Profile Prediction & Automated A/B Testing

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic encoding profile generation to *predict* optimal encoding settings based on content analysis *before* encoding begins, then automatically A/B test these predictions against baseline settings.

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw media content (video, audio).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Scene Detection:** Identify scene changes and shot boundaries.
    *   **Motion Vector Analysis:** Calculate the average and peak motion vectors per scene.
    *   **Complexity Metric:** Develop a "visual complexity" metric based on motion, color variance, and detail.  Higher values indicate more complex scenes.  Formula example: `Complexity = (AvgMotionVector * ColorVariance) + DetailLevel`. Each component should be normalized.
    *   **Audio Analysis:** Analyze audio complexity (dynamic range, frequency spread).
    *   **Content Type Classification:**  Utilize a pre-trained ML model to classify content type (e.g., sports, animation, documentary, talking head). This informs initial setting biases.
*   **Output:**  A "Content Profile" containing: Complexity Score, Audio Complexity Score, Content Type, Scene Change Rate.

**2. Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Content Profile, Encoder Version, Desired Output Resolution/Bitrate Targets.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Historical Data:** Access a database of previously encoded content, their settings, and resulting quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, VMAF).
    *   **Model Training:** Train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict optimal encoding settings (bitrate, QP, GOP size, etc.) based on the Content Profile and historical data. This model *must* be specific to the encoder version.
    *   **Setting Prediction:**  Use the trained model to predict optimal settings for the current content.
    *   **Constraint Application:** Ensure predicted settings fall within acceptable ranges defined by the encoder and desired output targets.
*   **Output:**  Predicted Encoding Profile (a set of settings).

**3. Automated A/B Testing Framework:**

*   **Process:**
    *   **Parallel Encoding:** Encode the content *twice* â€“ once with the predicted settings, and once with a baseline encoding profile (e.g., a pre-defined standard profile).
    *   **Quality Assessment:**  Automated quality assessment using objective metrics (PSNR, SSIM, VMAF) and, optionally, subjective quality scoring (using a small pool of human testers).
    *   **Performance Comparison:**  Compare the quality and encoding time of the two versions.
    *   **Feedback Loop:**
        *   If the predicted settings yield significantly better quality or faster encoding with comparable quality, update the historical data and re-train the prediction model.
        *   If the baseline profile performs better, log the discrepancy for further analysis and potential model refinement.
*   **Output:** A/B Test Results (quality metrics, encoding time, performance comparison) & Updated Prediction Model.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservice Design:** Implement each module (Content Analysis, Prediction Engine, A/B Testing) as a separate microservice for scalability and maintainability.
*   **API Communication:**  Use REST APIs for communication between microservices.
*   **Data Storage:**  Use a scalable database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) to store historical data, A/B test results, and prediction models.
*   **Orchestration:**  Use a workflow orchestration tool (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Compose) to manage the deployment and execution of the microservices.
