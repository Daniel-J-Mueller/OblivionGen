**Dynamic Emotional Resonance Rendering**

**Core Concept:** Extend the dynamic rendering system to modulate presentation not just based on cognitive difficulty (word length, definitions) and reading speed, but also *emotional valence* detected within the text, and project this onto the rendering – subtly shifting color palettes, character spacing, and even introducing micro-animations designed to enhance emotional engagement.

**Specs:**

*   **Emotional Analysis Module:** Integrate a sentiment analysis engine (pre-trained or custom) capable of identifying emotional tone (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutrality, etc.) within each sentence or paragraph.  Output a valence score (-1.0 to 1.0) and an arousal level (0.0 to 1.0).
*   **Rendering Palette Mapping:** Define a mapping between emotional valence/arousal levels and color palettes.  Example:
    *   High Valence/High Arousal (Joy): Warm colors (yellows, oranges), increased character spacing, subtle pulsing animation.
    *   Low Valence/Low Arousal (Sadness): Cool colors (blues, grays), decreased character spacing, gentle fading animation.
    *   Negative Valence/High Arousal (Anger):  Red/black palette, sharper character edges, rapid flickering animation.
*   **Character-Level Modulation:**  Extend the existing color modulation to work on sub-character levels – highlighting specific phonemes or morphemes based on their emotional contribution to the word.  (e.g., if “un-happy” is presented, subtly darken the "un-" prefix).
*   **Micro-Animation Library:** Develop a library of short, unobtrusive animations (e.g., subtle character scaling, slight vertical drift, momentary glow) triggered by specific emotional cues. Animations should be asynchronous and non-disruptive.
*   **User Calibration:** Implement a calibration phase where the user rates emotional stimuli to personalize the rendering rules. This accounts for individual emotional sensitivity and preferences.
*   **Content Category Aware Adaptation:** Different content categories (e.g., technical manual vs. fictional narrative) will necessitate different rendering rules. A content category classifier will dynamically adjust the rendering parameters.
*   **Dynamic Range Control:** Implement a dynamic range control to limit the intensity of the emotional rendering. This prevents overwhelming the user and ensures readability.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** Modify the existing rendering pipeline to accept emotional data and apply the appropriate rendering parameters.

**Pseudocode:**

```
For each sentence in content:
    emotional_data = AnalyzeSentiment(sentence)  // Returns valence, arousal
    category = ClassifyContent(content) //determine content category

    For each word in sentence:
        difficulty = CalculateWordDifficulty(word)
        base_time_interval = CalculateBaseTimeInterval(reading_speed, difficulty)

        valence = emotional_data.valence
        arousal = emotional_data.arousal

        color_palette = GetColorPalette(valence, arousal, category)
        character_color = color_palette.GetCharacterColor()
        animation = color_palette.GetAnimation()

        time_adjustment = CalculateTimeAdjustment(difficulty, valence, arousal)
        final_time_interval = base_time_interval + time_adjustment

        RenderWord(word, character_color, final_time_interval, animation)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   GPU acceleration for real-time rendering.
*   Sentiment analysis library (e.g., VADER, SpaCy with sentiment extensions).
*   Machine learning framework for content classification (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Custom rendering engine capable of dynamic color and animation control.
*   User interface for calibration and preference settings.
