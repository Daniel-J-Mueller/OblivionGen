## Dynamic Capability Swapping via Encrypted Micro-Firmware

**Concept:** Extend the provisioning and certificate-based authentication to enable *runtime* swapping of device capabilities via small, encrypted firmware updates. This moves beyond static provisioning to a dynamically adaptable device.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Capability Modules:** Small, self-contained firmware modules implementing specific device functions (e.g., a specific audio codec, a networking protocol, a sensor driver). Modules are signed with a capability-specific key.
*   **Capability Manifest:** A digitally signed list detailing available/authorized capability modules for the device. This manifest is part of the initial provisioning but can be updated.
*   **Secure Bootloader:** Modified to verify both the core OS image *and* the capability modules before execution.
*   **Capability Manager:** A core OS component responsible for loading, unloading, and managing capability modules.
*   **Remote Capability Server:** A server hosting available capability modules and associated metadata (compatibility, dependencies, signing information).
*   **Encrypted Tunnel:** A secure communication channel between the device and the Remote Capability Server.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Provisioning:** Device receives initial OS image, initial capability manifest, and root certificates (as per the provided patent).
2.  **Capability Request:** Device identifies a need for a new capability or an update to an existing one.
3.  **Server Query:** Device queries the Remote Capability Server for compatible modules.  The query includes device identifiers, current firmware version, and requested capability.
4.  **Module Selection & Encryption:** Server selects the appropriate module, encrypts it using a device-specific key (derived from initial provisioning data â€“ perhaps a combination of serial number and a dynamically generated key), and transmits it to the device via the encrypted tunnel.
5.  **Verification & Loading:** Device verifies the module signature using the server's public key (obtained during initial provisioning). Upon successful verification, the Capability Manager loads the module.  A secure memory region is allocated.
6.  **Runtime Capability Swap:** The new capability module becomes active, potentially replacing or augmenting existing functionality. The original capability module can be archived (compressed and stored in non-volatile memory) or removed.
7.  **Revocation Mechanism**: A blacklist of revoked capability module hashes, signed by a trusted authority, is periodically distributed and checked by the device.

**3.  Pseudocode (Capability Manager - Module Load):**

```
function LoadCapabilityModule(moduleData, moduleSignature):
    if VerifySignature(moduleSignature, moduleData, serverPublicKey):
        // Allocate secure memory region
        memoryRegion = AllocateSecureMemory(moduleData.size)

        // Write module data to memory region
        WriteToMemory(memoryRegion, moduleData)

        // Mark module as loaded and active
        SetModuleStatus(moduleData.moduleID, "active")

        // Update device capability map
        UpdateCapabilityMap(moduleData.moduleID, memoryRegion)

        return True
    else:
        Log("Module verification failed")
        return False
```

**4. Security Considerations:**

*   Device-Specific Encryption Keys: Key derivation must be robust and resistant to compromise.  Hardware security modules (HSMs) should be used to protect keys.
*   Secure Bootloader Verification:  The bootloader *must* verify all loaded modules before execution.
*   Tamper Detection: Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent tampering with the device's firmware and hardware.
*   Regular Security Audits:  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Secure Element/HSM: For key storage and cryptographic operations.
*   Sufficient Non-Volatile Memory: To store capability modules and manifest data.
*   Powerful Processor: To handle encryption/decryption and module execution.
