## Acoustic Camouflage System

**Core Concept:** Extend the directional audio output beyond simple symmetric projection to create an “acoustic bubble” – a zone where perceived sound sources are manipulated to appear *elsewhere* in the environment. This aims to create a localized sound illusion, effectively masking or redirecting sound.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing voice assistant housing (cylindrical as per patent).
    *   Array of *at least* 16 micro-speakers, radially distributed around the base circumference, each independently controllable.  These are *in addition* to the existing speaker.
    *   High-resolution microphone array (minimum 8 microphones) – both top-mounted *and* a secondary array placed around the base circumference, facing outwards. This is in addition to existing microphones.
    *   Dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) with sufficient processing power for real-time beamforming, spatial audio rendering, and environmental acoustic modeling.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to track device orientation and movement, crucial for accurate spatial audio rendering.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Environmental Acoustic Mapping:** The system continuously analyzes incoming audio through the microphone arrays to build a dynamic 3D acoustic map of the surrounding environment. This map identifies reflective surfaces, obstacles, and ambient noise sources.
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:**  This engine utilizes the environmental map, IMU data, and user-defined parameters to calculate optimal speaker configurations. It simulates how sound waves would propagate from a desired virtual source location, accounting for reflections, diffraction, and attenuation.
    *   **Beamforming & Phase Control:** Each micro-speaker’s output is individually controlled in terms of amplitude, frequency, and *phase*. This allows the creation of constructive and destructive interference patterns to shape the sound field.
    *   **Sound Source Virtualization:** The core algorithm. Based on a desired virtual sound source location (user defined, or triggered by an event – e.g., a phone call), the system synthesizes the appropriate audio signal and distributes it to the micro-speaker array.
    *   **‘Acoustic Shadow’ Generation:**  The system actively suppresses sound originating from a specific direction by generating destructive interference patterns. This creates an "acoustic shadow" effectively masking the true sound source.
    *   **User Interface:** Simple controls to define virtual sound source locations, acoustic shadow zones, and overall system intensity.

**Pseudocode (Sound Source Virtualization):**

```
function VirtualizeSound(virtualSourceX, virtualSourceY, virtualSourceZ, audioSignal):
  // 1. Calculate distances from each micro-speaker to the virtual source.
  for each microSpeaker in microSpeakerArray:
    distance = calculateDistance(microSpeaker.x, microSpeaker.y, microSpeaker.z, virtualSourceX, virtualSourceY, virtualSourceZ)
    delay = distance / speedOfSound // Calculate time delay for each speaker
    amplitude = calculateAmplitude(distance) // Adjust amplitude based on distance (attenuation)
    phase = calculatePhase(distance) // Calculate phase shift

  // 2. Apply delays, amplitude scaling, and phase shifts to the audio signal.
  for each microSpeaker in microSpeakerArray:
    delayedSignal = delayAudio(audioSignal, delay)
    scaledSignal = scaleAudio(delayedSignal, amplitude)
    phaseShiftedSignal = applyPhaseShift(scaledSignal, phase)
    outputSpeaker(microSpeaker, phaseShiftedSignal)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Private Listening:** Create a localized "bubble" of sound around the user, without disturbing others.
*   **Augmented Reality Audio:**  Place virtual sound sources within the user's environment.
*   **Sound Masking:**  Block out unwanted noise in a specific area.
*   **Security/Deterrence:**  Create the illusion of movement or activity in a secure area.
*   **Directional Alerts:** Deliver targeted audio alerts to specific individuals.
