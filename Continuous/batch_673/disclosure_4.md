## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping for Media

**Concept:** Extend the existing "relevant content" system to not just consider *what* is being consumed, but *how* the user is reacting to it, and dynamically alter the content suggestions based on detected emotional states. This moves beyond simple topical association and enters the realm of emotional storytelling and personalized experiences.

**Specs:**

1.  **Emotional Input Module:**
    *   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from multiple sources:
        *   **Facial Expression Analysis:** Utilize the client's camera (with user permission) to analyze facial micro-expressions.
        *   **Voice Analysis:** Analyze vocal tone, pitch, and speed during user interaction (e.g., speaking to a voice assistant, commenting on content).
        *   **Physiological Data (Optional):** If the client device supports it (e.g., smartwatches, fitness trackers), integrate heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance data.
        *   **Input Data Weighting:** Implement a weighted algorithm to prioritize input sources. Facial expression may have the highest weight, followed by voice analysis, and then physiological data.
    *   **Emotional State Classification:** Employ a machine learning model to classify detected emotional states. Core emotions to include: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Neutral. Model should output a probability distribution across these emotions.

2.  **Content Resonance Database:**
    *   **Emotional Tagging:** Expand existing content metadata to include "emotional resonance tags." This involves analyzing content (videos, music, articles, etc.) to determine the emotions it typically evokes in viewers/listeners/readers. This could be done via:
        *   **Automated Sentiment Analysis:** Utilize natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to analyze content and assign emotional scores.
        *   **Crowdsourced Emotional Labeling:** Allow users to rate the emotional impact of content.
        *   **Expert Emotional Analysis:** Employ human experts to analyze content and assign emotional labels.
    *   **Emotional Profile Creation:** For each piece of content, create an emotional profile consisting of a vector of emotional scores (e.g., Joy: 0.7, Sadness: 0.2, Anger: 0.1).

3.  **Dynamic Content Suggestion Engine:**
    *   **Emotional Matching Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm to match the user's current emotional state with the emotional profiles of available content. Algorithm should consider:
        *   **Emotional Congruence:** Suggest content that evokes similar emotions to the user's current state (e.g., if the user is feeling joyful, suggest more joyful content).
        *   **Emotional Contrast:** Suggest content that evokes contrasting emotions to the user's current state (e.g., if the user is feeling angry, suggest calming content). Algorithm parameters should allow the user to customize the preference between congruence and contrast.
        *   **Emotional Arc Consideration:** Analyze the emotional arc of the current media file. If the media file is building towards a climax, the algorithm should suggest content that complements the building tension.
    *   **Real-time Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the user's emotional state and adjust content suggestions in real-time.
    *   **Personalized Emotional Profile:** Maintain a personalized emotional profile for each user, tracking their emotional responses to different types of content. This will allow the algorithm to learn the user's emotional preferences over time.

4.  **User Interface Integration:**
    *   **Emotional Visualization (Optional):** Provide an optional visualization of the user's detected emotional state in the UI (e.g., a subtle color change or an animated icon). This should be user-configurable to ensure privacy and avoid being distracting.
    *   **"Mood-Based" Content Filtering:** Allow users to explicitly filter content based on desired emotional outcomes (e.g., "Show me content that will make me laugh," "Show me content that will help me relax").
    *   **Dynamic "Related Content" Panel:** Update the relevant content listing in real-time based on the user's emotional state.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function suggest_content(current_media, user_emotional_state, content_database):
  // Analyze current_media to determine emotional arc (e.g., building tension, climax, resolution)
  emotional_arc = analyze_media_arc(current_media)

  // Find content in content_database that matches user_emotional_state and emotional_arc
  candidate_content = find_matching_content(user_emotional_state, emotional_arc, content_database)

  // Rank candidate_content based on relevance, user preferences, and historical data
  ranked_content = rank_content(ranked_content, user_preferences, user_history)

  // Return top N ranked_content suggestions
  return ranked_content[:N]
```
