## Dynamic Wavelength-Multiplexed OTDR Network with AI-Driven Fiber Health Prediction

**Concept:** A distributed fiber optic sensing network employing multiple OTDRs operating at dynamically allocated wavelengths, coupled with an AI to predict fiber degradation *before* failures occur. This builds on the patent's use of OTDRs for CD estimation but moves toward proactive, predictive maintenance and significantly increased network capacity.

**Specifications:**

*   **Node Architecture:** Each network node (similar to the ‘first’ and ‘second’ nodes in the patent) will house a tunable multi-wavelength OTDR.  The OTDR will be capable of rapidly switching between a pre-defined set of wavelengths (e.g., 1530nm - 1570nm with 1nm steps). This tuning will be managed by a central node controller. Each node will also feature a high-bandwidth wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) and demultiplexer.
*   **Fiber Infrastructure:**  Existing fiber pairs will be utilized. However, each fiber will be treated as multiple logical fibers via WDM.  Each wavelength will be allocated to a specific function: data communication, OTDR probing, and potentially dedicated monitoring channels.
*   **OTDR Operation:**
    *   **Dynamic Wavelength Assignment:** The node controller will dynamically assign wavelengths to each OTDR based on network traffic and monitoring requirements. High-priority data channels will be allocated stable wavelengths. OTDR probing will occur on less-utilized wavelengths, minimizing disruption.
    *   **Coherent OTDR Enhancement:**  Employ coherent detection within the OTDR to improve signal-to-noise ratio and allow for more precise measurement of fiber characteristics.
    *   **Polarization Diversity:** Implement polarization diversity within the OTDR to account for polarization mode dispersion (PMD) effects and provide more accurate measurements.
*   **AI-Driven Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Data Acquisition:**  The system will continuously acquire OTDR data (backscatter traces, temporal delays, amplitude changes) from all nodes.
    *   **Feature Extraction:**  Extract relevant features from the backscatter traces, including:
        *   Attenuation levels
        *   Backscatter coefficients
        *   Splice and connector loss estimates
        *   Chromatic dispersion coefficients (as in the patent)
        *   Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) estimations
    *   **AI Model:** Train a deep learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network or Long Short-Term Memory network) to predict fiber degradation based on the extracted features. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical fiber performance data, including failures.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns in the OTDR data that may indicate early signs of fiber degradation.
    *   **Predictive Maintenance:**  The AI will provide proactive alerts when it predicts a fiber failure, allowing maintenance personnel to address the issue before it impacts network service.
*   **Node Controller Software:**
    *   **Wavelength Allocation Algorithm:**  An algorithm to optimize wavelength allocation based on network load, OTDR monitoring requirements, and AI predictions.
    *   **OTDR Scheduling:**  A scheduler to coordinate OTDR probing across multiple nodes, minimizing interference.
    *   **AI Integration:**  An interface to receive predictions from the AI engine and adjust OTDR parameters and wavelength allocation accordingly.
    *   **Remote Configuration & Monitoring:**  A web-based interface for remote configuration, monitoring, and control of the network.
*   **Data Storage:** A centralized data storage system to store all OTDR data, AI predictions, and historical fiber performance data. This data will be used to improve the accuracy of the AI model and provide long-term insights into fiber network health.

**Pseudocode (AI Predictive Model Training):**

```python
# Data Acquisition
data = acquire_otdr_data(nodes) # Returns a list of ODTDR data from each node

# Feature Extraction
features = extract_features(data)

# Data Preprocessing: Normalization, Cleaning
processed_features = preprocess_features(features)

# Data Splitting: Training/Validation/Test sets
train_data, val_data, test_data = split_data(processed_features)

# Model Selection: LSTM, RNN, etc
model = create_lstm_model(input_shape=train_data.shape[1], hidden_units=64, output_units=1)

# Model Compilation
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Model Training
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=100, validation_data=(val_data, val_labels))

# Model Evaluation
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)

# Prediction
predicted_degradation = model.predict(new_otdr_data)

# Alerting: Trigger maintenance if predicted degradation exceeds a threshold
if predicted_degradation > threshold:
  send_maintenance_alert()
```

This system moves beyond simply estimating CD. It leverages the OTDR technology for continuous fiber health monitoring and predictive maintenance, increasing network reliability and reducing downtime.
