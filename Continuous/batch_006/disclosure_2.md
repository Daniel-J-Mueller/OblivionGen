## Adaptive Sleep Environment Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the sleep score system to actively *influence* sleep quality via a dynamically adjusted environment. The core idea is to use the generated sleep score (and embedding vector) not just as an assessment, but as input to a control system governing various environmental factors.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Smart Bed: Integrated sensors (pressure, temperature, movement) for refined sleep stage detection & biofeedback.
    *   Environmental Control Unit: Controls smart lighting (color temperature, intensity), HVAC (temperature, humidity), sound system (white noise, nature sounds, personalized audio), aromatherapy diffuser.
    *   Wearable Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing wearables (smartwatches, fitness trackers) for comprehensive data collection (HRV, SpO2, skin temperature, activity).
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   Sleep Stage Prediction Refinement: A reinforcement learning model trained on individual user data and environmental responses to *predict* optimal environmental settings for transitioning between and maintaining desired sleep stages (e.g., increasing deep sleep duration).
    *   Environmental Parameter Mapping: A multi-dimensional mapping algorithm that links specific sleep score components (e.g., REM density, deep sleep duration, wakefulness frequency) to corresponding environmental adjustments.  This mapping is individualized through user feedback and machine learning.
    *   Personalized Soundscape Generation: An algorithm that creates dynamic, personalized soundscapes based on real-time sleep stage detection and user preferences. This can include binaural beats, isochronic tones, or adaptive white/pink noise.
    *   Aromatherapy Integration: A system that releases specific aromatherapy scents based on sleep stage and user preferences (e.g., lavender for relaxation, peppermint for alertness during light sleep).
    *   Sleep Score-Driven Environmental Control Loop:

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (Sleep Session Active) {
    // 1. Data Acquisition
    user_data = get_user_data_from_sensors()
    // 2. Sleep Score Calculation (Existing System)
    sleep_score, embedding_vector = calculate_sleep_score(user_data)
    // 3. Environmental Parameter Adjustment
    environmental_parameters = adjust_environment(sleep_score, embedding_vector)
    // 4. Apply Parameters
    apply_environmental_parameters(environmental_parameters)
    // 5. Log Data
    log_data(user_data, sleep_score, environmental_parameters)
}
```

```pseudocode
// adjust_environment function
function adjust_environment(sleep_score, embedding_vector) {
    // 1. Determine Target Sleep Stage (based on embedding vector & user goals)
    target_stage = determine_target_sleep_stage(embedding_vector)

    // 2. Access Personalized Parameter Mapping
    parameter_mapping = get_personalized_parameter_mapping(user_id)

    // 3. Calculate Optimal Parameters
    optimal_parameters = calculate_optimal_parameters(sleep_score, target_stage, parameter_mapping)

    // 4. Apply Constraints (e.g., temperature limits, noise level preferences)
    constrained_parameters = apply_constraints(optimal_parameters)

    return constrained_parameters
}
```

*   **Data Logging & Analysis:** Comprehensive logging of all sensor data, sleep scores, environmental parameters, and user feedback for continuous model refinement and personalization.
*   **User Interface:** Intuitive mobile app for monitoring sleep data, customizing environmental preferences, providing feedback, and tracking progress.

**Novelty:** This extends the static sleep score to an *active* sleep improvement system. It moves beyond assessment to intervention, creating a closed-loop system that dynamically adjusts the environment to optimize sleep quality based on individual needs and real-time feedback. It is not simply about *knowing* how well someone sleeps, but *helping* them sleep better.
