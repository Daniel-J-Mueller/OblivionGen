## Dynamic Compartment Morphology System

**Concept:** Adapt the columnar compartments within the inner tray to actively conform to the item’s shape *during* the sealing process, maximizing protection and minimizing wasted space.

**Specs:**

*   **Inner Tray Material:** Shape-memory polymer (SMP) blend, specifically a polyurethane-based SMP chosen for its relatively low activation temperature and high elasticity.
*   **Compartment Design:** Initial compartment geometry is a low-profile, interconnected network of hexagonal cells (akin to a honeycomb) instead of discrete columns. Each hexagonal cell incorporates microfluidic channels.
*   **Microfluidic System:** Integrated within the inner tray is a network of microfluidic channels connecting to a small, rechargeable micro-pump/reservoir system. The reservoir contains a thermally-activated, non-Newtonian fluid (shear-thickening fluid).
*   **Activation Sequence:**
    1.  Item placed in outer tray. Inner tray positioned above.
    2.  Vacuum sealing initiates. Simultaneously, the micro-pump activates, injecting the shear-thickening fluid into the microfluidic channels within the inner tray.
    3.  As the vacuum increases, the fluid-filled channels expand, exerting pressure on the hexagonal cells.
    4.  The SMP responds to the combination of vacuum pressure and fluid expansion, causing the cells to deform *around* the item, creating a custom-fit enclosure.  The shear-thickening fluid ensures even pressure distribution and prevents localized deformation.
    5.  Once the desired vacuum level is reached, fluid flow ceases. The SMP retains the deformed shape, providing a tight, protective fit.
*   **Cover Integration:** Cover design incorporates a pressure sensor.  If the pressure within the air compartments deviates from a pre-set range (indicating potential damage or compromise of the seal), an audible/visual alert is triggered.
*   **Material Thickness:**
    *   Inner Tray (SMP): 200μm - 300μm
    *   Microfluidic Channels: 50μm - 100μm
    *   Outer Tray (PET): 450μm (existing spec)
*   **Micro-Pump/Reservoir:** Lithium-ion polymer battery, dimensions: 20mm x 15mm x 5mm.  Pump output: 5mL/min.
*   **Control System:** Embedded microcontroller programmed with pre-set vacuum levels, fluid flow rates, and pressure thresholds.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
SET vacuum_target = 650 millibar
SET fluid_flow_rate = 2 mL/min
SET pressure_threshold = 1000 millibar

// Sealing Sequence
FUNCTION seal_item(item, outer_tray, inner_tray) {
  PLACE inner_tray ON item INSIDE outer_tray
  ACTIVATE micro-pump, START fluid flow
  START vacuum pump
  WHILE vacuum_level < vacuum_target {
    MONITOR vacuum_level
    MONITOR pressure_inside_compartments
    IF pressure_inside_compartments > pressure_threshold THEN {
        STOP vacuum pump
        ALERT user
        RETURN ERROR
    }
  }
  STOP vacuum pump
  STOP micro-pump
  APPLY cover
}
```

**Potential Applications:** Electronics packaging, fragile goods, medical device protection. This system could significantly reduce product damage during shipping and handling while minimizing packaging material usage.
