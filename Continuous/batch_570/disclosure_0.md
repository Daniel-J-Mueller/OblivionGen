## Dynamic Resource Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the mapping rule concept to not just *translate* API requests, but to dynamically construct a "persona" for the resource being accessed. This persona defines not only *how* the resource responds to requests but *what* data it presents and *to whom*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Definition Language (PDL):**

*   A declarative language (YAML or JSON-based) for defining resource personas.  The PDL will specify:
    *   `name`: Persona identifier (string).
    *   `description`: Human-readable description (string).
    *   `request_mapping`: Mapping rules (similar to existing patent claims) – transforms incoming requests.
    *   `data_filter`: Rules defining how the resource's underlying data is filtered/transformed *before* it's returned to the client. (e.g., redact sensitive fields, aggregate data, change units).  This can leverage a simple expression language or scripting capability.
    *   `access_control`: Fine-grained access control rules *beyond* the authorization rules. (e.g., “Users in group X can only see data related to region Y”).
    *   `response_format`:  Specifies the desired response format (JSON schema, XML, CSV).
*   Example PDL snippet:

```yaml
name: "CustomerSupportPersona"
description: "Persona for customer support representatives – shows limited customer details."
request_mapping:
  - source_field: "customer_id"
    target_field: "internal_customer_id"
data_filter:
  - field: "credit_card_number"
    action: "redact"
  - field: "purchase_history"
    action: "limit_to_last_3_months"
access_control:
  - group: "support_team"
    allowed_fields: ["name", "email", "last_order"]
response_format: "JSON"
```

**2. Persona Manager Service:**

*   A dedicated service responsible for:
    *   Storing and managing personas.
    *   Providing an API for creating, updating, and deleting personas.
    *   Dynamically applying personas to requests.

**3. Request Interception & Persona Application:**

*   The existing request handling pipeline will be modified to include:
    *   **Persona Selection:** Before processing a request, determine the appropriate persona based on:
        *   Client identity (user, application, etc.).
        *   Resource being accessed.
        *   Contextual factors (time of day, location, etc.).  This allows for dynamic persona assignment.
    *   **Request Transformation:** Apply the `request_mapping` rules from the selected persona.
    *   **Resource Access:** Access the resource.
    *   **Data Filtering & Transformation:** Apply the `data_filter` rules.
    *   **Response Formatting:** Format the response according to the `response_format`.
    *   **Authorization Check:** Perform the existing authorization check *after* data filtering to ensure access control is still enforced.

**Pseudocode (Request Handling Pipeline):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  persona = personaManager.selectPersona(request)
  transformedRequest = persona.applyRequestMapping(request)
  resourceResponse = resource.access(transformedRequest)
  filteredResponse = persona.applyDataFilter(resourceResponse)
  formattedResponse = persona.formatResponse(filteredResponse)

  if (authorizationService.isAuthorized(request, formattedResponse)):
    return formattedResponse
  else:
    return error("Unauthorized")
```

**4. Dynamic Persona Updates:**

*   Allow personas to be updated in real-time without service interruption.
*   Implement a versioning system for personas to allow for rollback to previous versions.
*   Leverage a pub/sub mechanism to notify clients of persona updates.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:**  Fine-grained access control and data redaction.
*   **Improved User Experience:**  Tailored responses based on user roles and preferences.
*   **Increased Flexibility:**  Easily adapt to changing business requirements.
*   **Simplified Application Development:**  Clients don't need to handle complex data filtering and formatting logic.
