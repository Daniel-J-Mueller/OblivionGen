## Adaptive Encryption Granularity & Priority

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on delaying encryption until post-processing. This expands on that by *dynamically* adjusting the granularity of audio segments encrypted, and prioritizing encryption based on detected audio characteristics *during* processing. Instead of a blanket delay, specific segments are prioritized for faster or deferred encryption.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing speech interface device hardware with processor, volatile memory, non-volatile memory. Addition of a dedicated, low-power co-processor for basic audio feature extraction (described below).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Real-time Audio Feature Extractor (RAFE):** Runs on the co-processor. Extracts basic features from audio in real-time:
        *   **Speech Presence:** Is speech detected? (Boolean)
        *   **Emotional Tone:** Rough estimate of emotional valence (Positive/Negative/Neutral).
        *   **Keyword Spotting:** Detects pre-defined keywords (e.g., banking terms, personal identifiers).
        *   **Audio Event Classification:** Identifies common audio events (e.g., glass break, baby cry).
    *   **Encryption Prioritization Manager (EPM):** Receives features from RAFE and manages encryption queue.
    *   **Adaptive Segmentation Module (ASM):** Divides audio stream into variable-length segments.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  Audio input is fed into both the speech processing pipeline (ASR, NLU) *and* RAFE.
    2.  RAFE extracts features in real-time.
    3.  EPM receives features and assigns a priority level to each audio segment based on the following:
        *   **High Priority:** Segments containing keywords (banking, names, etc.) or identified as emotionally sensitive (e.g., distressed voice). These segments are encrypted *immediately* after processing is complete.
        *   **Medium Priority:** Segments identified as containing speech but lacking high-priority triggers. Encryption is scheduled but may be deferred slightly if system load is high.
        *   **Low Priority:** Segments identified as background noise or non-speech audio events. Encryption is deferred significantly, potentially batched for later processing.
    4.  ASM adjusts segment lengths based on priority. High-priority segments are kept short for faster processing and encryption. Low-priority segments may be combined or extended.
    5.  Encrypted data is stored in non-volatile memory.

**Pseudocode (EPM):**

```
function prioritize_segment(audio_segment, rafE_features):
    priority = DEFAULT_PRIORITY
    if rafE_features.contains_keyword():
        priority = HIGH_PRIORITY
    elif rafE_features.emotional_tone() == NEGATIVE:
        priority = HIGH_PRIORITY
    elif rafE_features.speech_presence() == TRUE:
        priority = MEDIUM_PRIORITY
    else:
        priority = LOW_PRIORITY

    return priority

function manage_encryption_queue(audio_segment, rafE_features):
    priority = prioritize_segment(audio_segment, rafE_features)

    segment_length = determine_segment_length(priority)

    add_to_encryption_queue(audio_segment, priority, segment_length)
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simple delayed encryption by *proactively* identifying sensitive audio and prioritizing its protection. It allows for a trade-off between latency and security â€“ potentially encrypting less critical audio at a lower priority to maintain responsiveness for high-priority interactions. It's a dynamic, risk-based approach to audio security.
