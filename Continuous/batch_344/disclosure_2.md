## Dynamic Content Authenticity with Blockchain Anchoring

**Specification:** A system for verifying media content authenticity by dynamically generating and anchoring cryptographic hashes of content segments on a blockchain, coupled with a tiered validation system.

**Components:**

1.  **Content Segmenter:** Divides incoming media streams (video, audio, etc.) into short, manageable segments (e.g., 2-5 seconds).
2.  **Hash Generator:**  Calculates a SHA-256 (or similar) hash of each content segment. This hash acts as a unique fingerprint.
3.  **Blockchain Anchor:**  Periodically (e.g., every 10-20 segments) submits a Merkle tree root hash (calculated from the individual segment hashes) to a designated blockchain (public or permissioned).  The blockchain transaction includes a timestamp.
4.  **Manifest Generator:**  Creates a manifest file containing:
    *   List of content segment URLs.
    *   Blockchain transaction ID for the Merkle root hash.
    *   Blockchain network details (RPC endpoint, etc.).
    *   Public key for verifying digital signatures (as per original patent).
5.  **Tiered Validation Engine (Client-Side):**
    *   **Tier 1: Signature Verification:**  Verify digital signature of each content segment using the public key from the manifest. (Existing functionality from original patent).
    *   **Tier 2: Blockchain Hash Verification:**  Retrieve the Merkle root hash from the blockchain using the transaction ID in the manifest.  Reconstruct the Merkle tree from the segment hashes and verify that the segment hash matches its position within the tree.
    *   **Tier 3: Timestamp Validation:** Check the timestamp of the blockchain transaction against the current time. Implement a tolerance window to account for network latency.  Reject segments if the timestamp is significantly in the past or future.

**Pseudocode (Tiered Validation Engine):**

```
function validateSegment(segmentData, segmentHash, manifest):
    // Tier 1: Signature Verification (as in original patent)
    if (!verifySignature(segmentData, segmentHash, manifest.publicKey)):
        return false

    // Tier 2: Blockchain Hash Verification
    merkleRoot = getMerkleRootFromBlockchain(manifest.blockchainTransactionId, manifest.blockchainNetwork)
    if (merkleRoot is null):
        return false // Blockchain unavailable or transaction not found

    calculatedMerkleRoot = calculateMerkleRoot(segmentHash, otherSegmentHashes) //Need to track other hashes
    if (calculatedMerkleRoot != merkleRoot):
        return false // Hash mismatch

    // Tier 3: Timestamp Validation
    transactionTimestamp = getTransactionTimestamp(manifest.blockchainTransactionId, manifest.blockchainNetwork)
    currentTime = getCurrentTime()
    if (abs(currentTime - transactionTimestamp) > acceptableToleranceWindow):
        return false // Timestamp out of range

    return true // Segment is valid
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Merkle Tree:** Standard Merkle tree implementation using SHA-256 hashing.
*   **Manifest File (JSON):**

```json
{
    "contentSegments": [
        {"url": "segment1.mp4", "hash": "hash1"},
        {"url": "segment2.mp4", "hash": "hash2"},
        ...
    ],
    "publicKey": "...",
    "blockchainTransactionId": "...",
    "blockchainNetwork": {
        "rpcEndpoint": "...",
        "chainId": "..."
    }
}
```

**Rationale:** This system strengthens content authentication by layering cryptographic verification with blockchain immutability. Blockchain anchoring prevents tampering with the hashes themselves. The tiered approach allows for flexible validation â€“ clients with blockchain access can perform full verification, while those without can rely on the initial digital signature check. This increases resilience against attacks and provides a higher degree of trust in the delivered media content.
