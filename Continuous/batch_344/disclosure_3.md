## Dynamic Haptic Feedback & Shape Recognition Scale

**Concept:** Expand the pressure-sensitive touch screen scale to not only *measure* weight, but also *identify* the object’s shape and material through a combination of advanced haptic feedback and machine learning.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution, multi-point capacitive touch screen with integrated micro-actuators. Actuators must be capable of variable stiffness and localized deformation. (Think a surface that can momentarily ‘mimic’ the texture of what’s placed upon it).
    *   Array of miniature force sensors *beneath* the touch screen, providing detailed pressure mapping.
    *   Edge-mounted, high-frequency vibration emitters (piezoelectric transducers) for surface wave generation.
    *   Integrated camera (RGB-D) to capture visual data of objects placed on the scale.
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time data analysis and haptic pattern generation.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Baseline Calibration:** The system establishes a ‘zero’ pressure profile when no object is present.
    2.  **Initial Contact Detection:** Detects the presence of an object and maps initial pressure distribution.
    3.  **Surface Wave Analysis:** Emit surface waves across the touch screen. Analyze the wave propagation patterns – how they are reflected, diffracted, and absorbed – to infer the object's geometry.  Areas of high resistance to wave propagation indicate protrusions or density.
    4.  **Haptic Feedback Simulation:** Based on the surface wave analysis and camera data, the micro-actuators dynamically adjust the screen's surface to *simulate* the object’s shape. This creates a localized haptic impression for the user.
    5.  **Material Identification (ML Integration):** 
        *   Train a machine learning model (Convolutional Neural Network or similar) using a dataset of pressure signatures, surface wave responses, visual data, and known material properties.
        *   The model analyzes the combined sensor data and predicts the object’s material composition (e.g., wood, metal, plastic, fruit, etc.).
    6.  **Weight Calculation:** Utilizing the existing pressure difference method from the base patent.
    7.  **Output:** Display weight, identified shape, and material composition on the screen. Option to provide additional information (e.g., nutritional facts for food items).

*   **Pseudocode (Material Identification)**

```
FUNCTION IdentifyMaterial(pressureData, waveResponse, visualData)

    // Load pre-trained ML model

    // Preprocess input data (normalize, feature extraction)

    // Predict material class using ML model

    RETURN predictedMaterialClass
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Grocery shopping – identify produce and display nutritional information.
    *   Manufacturing – quality control by identifying material defects.
    *   Accessibility – assist visually impaired individuals by providing tactile object recognition.
    *   Art/Design - digital sculpting/modeling directly on the scale.
    *   Authentication - verifying material authenticity (e.g. currency, precious metals)
