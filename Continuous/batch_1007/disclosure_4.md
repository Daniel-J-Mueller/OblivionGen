**Dynamic Taxonomy Generation via User Interaction & Temporal Drift Analysis**

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *matching* search queries to a *predefined* taxonomy. This system proposes a dynamic taxonomy that *evolves* based on user interactions and identifies ‘temporal drift’ in search intent. Essentially, we’re building a taxonomy that learns *with* the users, rather than being static.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Interaction Logging:** Every user interaction (clicks, purchases, dwell time on category pages, refined searches) is logged, associated with the original search query, and tagged with a confidence score indicating the relevance of that interaction to specific taxonomy nodes.

2.  **Node Mutation Engine:** A core component responsible for dynamically adjusting the taxonomy. This engine operates on two primary principles:
    *   **Node Splitting:**  If a node consistently receives high interaction volume *across* diverse interaction types (clicks on varied items, multiple refined searches), the engine proposes a split. The split is governed by clustering of interaction data – items frequently clicked together, search refinements focusing on specific attributes.
    *   **Node Merging:** If a node receives consistently *low* interaction volume *and* its interactions strongly correlate with another node (high cosine similarity of interaction vectors), the engine proposes a merge.

3.  **Temporal Drift Detection:** The system continuously monitors the distribution of search query segments *mapped* to taxonomy nodes over time.  A statistical test (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) is used to detect significant shifts in these distributions. A drift signal is generated, indicating the magnitude and direction of the change.

4.  **Confidence Thresholding & Human-in-the-Loop:**  Node splits and merges are *not* executed automatically. The system generates a ‘mutation proposal’ with a confidence score (based on statistical significance and magnitude of the change) and presents it to human curators for review and approval.  Curators can override the proposal or suggest modifications.

5.  **Personalized Taxonomy Layers:** The system maintains a *personalized* taxonomy layer for each user, overlaying the global taxonomy. This layer adapts more rapidly to individual preferences and search behavior, creating a more tailored search experience. Personalized layers are created through weighted application of user interactions to alter the global taxonomy.

**Pseudocode (Node Mutation Engine – Simplified):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION MutateTaxonomy(interactionData, globalTaxonomy):
    // Calculate interaction vectors for each taxonomy node
    nodeVectors = CalculateNodeVectors(interactionData, globalTaxonomy)

    // Identify potential splits: nodes with high interaction volume & variance
    potentialSplits = FindPotentialSplits(nodeVectors, threshold_split_volume, threshold_split_variance)

    // Identify potential merges: nodes with low interaction volume & high correlation
    potentialMerges = FindPotentialMerges(nodeVectors, threshold_merge_volume, threshold_merge_correlation)

    // Generate mutation proposals with confidence scores
    mutationProposals = GenerateProposals(potentialSplits, potentialMerges, interactionData)

    // Return proposals for human review
    RETURN mutationProposals
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `TaxonomyNode`: {nodeID, label, parentID, childrenIDs}
*   `InteractionEvent`: {userID, query, nodeID, interactionType (click, purchase, refine), timestamp}
*   `NodeVector`: {nodeID, interactionCounts (per interactionType), totalInteractionCount}

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Scalable database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) to store interaction data and taxonomy structure.
*   Distributed computing framework (e.g., Spark) for processing large volumes of interaction data.
*   Real-time data streaming platform (e.g., Kafka) for capturing user interactions in real-time.
