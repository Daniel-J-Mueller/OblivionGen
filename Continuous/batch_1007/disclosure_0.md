## Modular Environmental Power Harvesting Adapter

**Concept:** An adapter that combines retractable prongs *with* integrated miniature environmental energy harvesting modules – solar, kinetic (vibration), and thermal – to supplement or even replace reliance on traditional AC power. It’s a self-sustaining power source for low-draw devices.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Module:** A central housing containing the AC-to-DC converter, USB-C/A outputs, and environmental harvesting circuitry. Dimensions: 75mm x 50mm x 25mm. Material: Recycled ABS plastic.
*   **Plug Module:** A rotating, retractable plug unit (Type A/G/I selectable) as described in the provided patent. This serves as the primary power input when available. Includes a mechanical lock for secure extension/retraction.
*   **Solar Module:** Thin-film solar cells laminated onto the top surface of the core module. Surface area: 75mm x 50mm. Efficiency: 20% minimum. Includes a light sensor to optimize charging.
*   **Kinetic Module:** Piezoelectric generators integrated into the housing base. Activated by vibration and movement. Generates power from handling and transportation.
*   **Thermal Module:** Miniature thermoelectric generators (TEGs) positioned on the housing sides. Harnesses temperature differentials between the device and its surroundings.
*   **Power Management System:**
    *   Microcontroller: ESP32-S3.
    *   Battery: 3.7V 2000mAh LiPo.
    *   Charging Circuitry: MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) for solar, boost converters for kinetic/thermal.
    *   Power Prioritization: AC input > Solar > Kinetic/Thermal.  Automatic switching based on availability.
    *   Output Regulation: Stable 5V/3A USB output.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   LED Indicators: Power status, charging status (AC, Solar, Kinetic/Thermal), battery level.
    *   Button: Force-start harvesting (useful in low-light/low-movement conditions).
*   **Materials:**
    *   Housing: Recycled ABS plastic with textured finish for grip.
    *   Connectors: Gold-plated USB connectors for reliability.
    *   Internal Components: RoHS-compliant materials.

**Pseudocode (Power Management System):**

```
FUNCTION main()
  INITIALIZE batteryLevel = 0
  INITIALIZE acPowerAvailable = FALSE
  INITIALIZE solarPowerAvailable = FALSE
  INITIALIZE kineticPowerAvailable = FALSE
  INITIALIZE thermalPowerAvailable = FALSE

  WHILE TRUE
    acPowerAvailable = checkACInput()
    solarPowerAvailable = checkSolarInput()
    kineticPowerAvailable = checkKineticInput()
    thermalPowerAvailable = checkThermalInput()

    IF acPowerAvailable THEN
      chargeBatteryFromAC()
    ELSEIF solarPowerAvailable THEN
      chargeBatteryFromSolar()
    ELSEIF kineticPowerAvailable OR thermalPowerAvailable THEN
      chargeBatteryFromKineticThermal()
    ENDIF

    IF batteryLevel < 20% THEN
      activateLowPowerMode() //Reduce LED brightness etc.
    ENDIF

    providePowerToUSB()
    updateLEDIndicators()
    delay(100ms)
  ENDWHILE
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This combines the physical adaptability of a retractable plug adapter with energy harvesting capabilities, creating a truly self-sufficient power source.  It’s not just a converter; it’s a miniature power station. The intelligent power management system ensures optimal energy usage and prioritization.
