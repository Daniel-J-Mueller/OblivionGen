## Adaptive Credential Orchestration via Biofeedback

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Biofeedback Sensor Integration Module (BSIM). Hardware/Software stack capable of interfacing with a range of biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), EEG).  Supports both wired and wireless sensor connectivity (Bluetooth Low Energy preferred).
*   **Authentication Service Extension:**  "Contextual Trust Engine" (CTE).  An extension to the existing authentication service. Receives authentication requests *and* real-time biofeedback data from the BSIM.
*   **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    *   **Real-Time Feature Extraction:** BSIM transmits raw biofeedback data. CTE performs real-time feature extraction (e.g., HRV metrics, EDA peak frequency, EEG alpha/theta band power).
    *   **Baseline Calibration:** Upon initial setup, the system establishes a personalized baseline for each user’s biofeedback signals during a period of neutral activity.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  CTE employs machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, one-class SVMs) to detect deviations from the user’s baseline during authentication attempts.
*   **Dynamic Credential Adjustment:**
    *   **Trust Score Calculation:**  Based on the degree of deviation from the baseline, the CTE calculates a “trust score.” Lower deviation = higher trust score.
    *   **Credential Tiering:**  Security credentials are tiered (e.g., Tier 1 – Low Security, Tier 3 – High Security).
    *   **Adaptive Authentication:** The system dynamically adjusts the required authentication strength based on the trust score.
        *   High Trust Score:  Passwordless authentication or weak multi-factor authentication (MFA) is permitted.
        *   Medium Trust Score: Standard MFA is enforced.
        *   Low Trust Score: Strong MFA (e.g., biometric verification, hardware security key) is required, *or* access is temporarily denied.
*   **Session Management Enhancement:** The session generation process is augmented. Validation of security credentials is now weighed by the ‘trust score.’
*   **Experience Data Integration:** Include "calmness score" or “cognitive load” derived from biofeedback data in experience data transmitted to the client UI. Display a visual representation of the user’s current physiological state alongside authentication prompts.

**Pseudocode (CTE - Authentication Flow):**

```
function authenticate(authenticationRequest):
    user = getUserFromRequest(authenticationRequest)
    baseline = loadBaseline(user)
    biofeedbackData = getBiofeedbackData() //From BSIM
    deviationScore = calculateDeviation(biofeedbackData, baseline)
    trustScore = calculateTrustScore(deviationScore)

    if trustScore > 0.8:
        //High Trust – Passwordless or Weak MFA
        credentialValidationResult = validatePasswordless(authenticationRequest)
        if credentialValidationResult:
            generateSession(authenticationRequest, credentialValidationResult)
            return sessionToken
        else:
            requestMFA(authenticationRequest, "weak")
            return "MFA Required"
    else if trustScore > 0.5:
        //Medium Trust – Standard MFA
        requestMFA(authenticationRequest, "standard")
        //Handle MFA response
        if MFAValid:
            generateSession(authenticationRequest, MFAValid)
            return sessionToken
        else:
            return "Authentication Failed"
    else:
        //Low Trust – Strong MFA or Deny
        requestMFA(authenticationRequest, "strong")
        //Handle MFA response
        if MFAValid:
            generateSession(authenticationRequest, MFAValid)
            return sessionToken
        else:
            denyAccess()
            return "Access Denied"

```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Compatible Biofeedback Sensors (HRV, EDA, EEG).
*   Secure hardware enclave for sensitive data storage and processing.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Biofeedback data is inherently sensitive. Implement robust encryption and access controls.
*   Protect against spoofing attacks (e.g., fake biofeedback signals).
*   Regularly audit the system for vulnerabilities.
