## Adaptive Manifest Stitching for Multi-Resolution Live Event Coverage

**Specification:** A system to dynamically assemble live event coverage from multiple, geographically dispersed camera feeds, presented to the viewer as a single, seamless experience. This builds upon the concept of manifests defining available fragments, but adds layers of intelligent stitching and adaptive resolution selection.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of a single manifest defining fragments *of a single stream*, the system utilizes a *collection of manifests*, each representing a camera feed covering the same event. A central “Director” service analyzes incoming video from each camera – prioritizing framing, focus, and overall visual quality in real-time.  Based on this analysis, the Director dynamically generates a *composite manifest* tailored to each viewer’s device and network conditions.

**System Components:**

*   **Camera Feeds:** Multiple geographically dispersed cameras capturing the live event.
*   **Ingest Servers:** Receive camera feeds, encode them into multiple resolutions (e.g., 360p, 720p, 1080p), and generate individual manifests for each camera/resolution combination. Each manifest details fragments corresponding to short video clips.
*   **Director Service:** The core intelligence of the system.  Analyzes video quality from each camera, determines the optimal camera for each moment (e.g., a close-up during a speech, a wide shot during action), and dynamically creates a composite manifest for each viewer.
*   **Fragment Stitcher:**  Combines fragments from different camera feeds according to the composite manifest, ensuring smooth transitions. Handles potential audio synchronization issues.
*   **Viewer Device:**  Receives the composite manifest and requests fragments.

**Data Structures:**

*   **Camera Manifest:** Standard manifest file (e.g., HLS, DASH) detailing available fragments for a single camera. Includes metadata: camera ID, location, resolution.
*   **Composite Manifest:** A manifest generated by the Director. It references fragments from *multiple* Camera Manifests. Includes:
    *   Fragment ID (pointing to a fragment in a Camera Manifest)
    *   Camera ID (identifying the source camera)
    *   Transition Type (e.g., cut, fade, wipe)
    *   Transition Duration
*   **Quality Map:** A data structure maintained by the Director, mapping each viewer device to its current network conditions and preferred resolution.

**Pseudocode - Director Service:**

```
function generateCompositeManifest(viewerDevice, eventTime) {
  quality = getViewerQuality(viewerDevice) // Get network conditions/preferences
  bestCamera = determineBestCamera(eventTime, quality) // AI-driven camera selection

  compositeManifest = new Manifest()
  currentFragmentTime = eventTime - playbackOffset

  while (currentFragmentTime < eventTime + manifestDuration) {
    fragment = bestCamera.getNextFragment(currentFragmentTime)

    compositeManifest.addFragment(fragment, bestCamera.cameraID, 'cut', 0)

    currentFragmentTime += fragmentDuration
  }

  return compositeManifest
}

function determineBestCamera(eventTime, quality) {
  // AI algorithm to analyze video from all cameras in real-time
  // Factors: framing, focus, lighting, action, audience reactions
  // Returns the camera providing the best visual experience for the current moment
  // Incorporates viewer quality (resolution) to select the appropriate camera source
}
```

**Key Features:**

*   **Dynamic Camera Switching:** Seamless transitions between cameras to provide the most engaging viewing experience.
*   **Adaptive Resolution:** Automatically adjust video resolution based on viewer’s network conditions.
*   **AI-Powered Camera Selection:** Intelligent algorithm to identify the best camera for each moment, enhancing overall viewing quality.
*   **Scalability:** System designed to handle a large number of camera feeds and viewers.
*   **Multi-Perspective Viewing:** Viewers can optionally switch between individual camera feeds for a more personalized experience.
