## Adaptive Interconnect Fabric with Dynamic Topology

**Specification:** A multi-chip system utilizing a dynamically reconfigurable interconnect fabric, extending the concept of coherent/non-coherent connections. This fabric moves beyond static SoC-to-SoC links, enabling runtime topology adjustments optimized for workload characteristics.

**Core Components:**

*   **Reconfigurable Interconnect Modules (RIMs):** Each SoC possesses RIMs. These are FPGA-like fabric blocks capable of establishing direct peer-to-peer connections with RIMs on other SoCs. They support both coherent and non-coherent protocols. RIMs include dedicated DMA engines.
*   **Global Topology Manager (GTM):** A dedicated processor (potentially distributed across SoCs) responsible for monitoring system workload, predicting communication patterns, and reconfiguring the interconnect fabric. Uses machine learning to optimize topology.
*   **Virtual Channels:** RIMs support multiple virtual channels, allowing prioritization of traffic and isolation of communication streams.
*   **Protocol Adapters:** RIMs house protocol adapters for translating between different interconnect standards (e.g., AXI, UCIe) enabling heterogeneous integration.

**Operation:**

1.  **Baseline Topology:** The system boots with a default, static topology (similar to the provided patent – coherent links for processors, non-coherent for I/O).
2.  **Workload Monitoring:** The GTM continuously monitors application behavior (communication graphs, data access patterns).
3.  **Topology Prediction:** The GTM utilizes machine learning models (e.g., graph neural networks) to predict future communication needs.
4.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Based on predictions, the GTM instructs RIMs to establish/break direct connections.  RIMs dynamically reconfigure their internal routing to create optimized pathways.
5.  **Traffic Steering:**  The GTM programs data steering tables within each SoC to route traffic through the reconfigured fabric.

**Pseudocode (GTM – Simplified):**

```
function optimize_topology(workload_data):
    communication_graph = build_communication_graph(workload_data)
    predicted_graph = predict_future_communication(communication_graph)
    optimal_topology = calculate_optimal_topology(predicted_graph)

    for SoC1, SoC2 in optimal_topology:
        if connection_exists(SoC1, SoC2) == false:
            establish_connection(SoC1, SoC2, protocol = determine_protocol(SoC1, SoC2))
        else:
            if needs_protocol_update(SoC1, SoC2):
                update_protocol(SoC1, SoC2)

    remove_unused_connections()

function remove_unused_connections():
    for connection in all_connections:
        if connection.traffic_level < threshold:
            break_connection(connection)
```

**Novelty & Benefits:**

*   **Adaptive Performance:** The fabric dynamically adjusts to workload demands, maximizing bandwidth and minimizing latency.
*   **Heterogeneous Integration:** The protocol adapters enable seamless integration of diverse SoCs with different interconnect standards.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  The dynamic topology allows the system to route around failed connections, increasing reliability.
*   **Scalability:** The modular nature of the RIMs allows the system to scale to a larger number of SoCs.
* **Energy Efficiency:** By only maintaining necessary connections, the system reduces power consumption.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   High-performance computing (HPC) clusters
*   Data center applications
*   Edge computing platforms
*   AI/ML acceleration systems.
