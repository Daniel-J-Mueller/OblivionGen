## Dynamic Column Generation & Federated Indexing

**Concept:** Extend the globally scoped column indexing to allow *dynamic* column creation *during* query execution and leverage federated indexing across multiple graph databases. This moves beyond pre-defined schemas and enables exploration of data without upfront modeling.

**Specs:**

**1. Dynamic Column Definition Protocol:**

*   **Trigger:** When a query references a column name not present in the database schema, a "Column Definition Request" is initiated.
*   **Request Payload:** Includes the column name, data type inference hints (if available from the query context – e.g., comparing to a known integer), and a source identifier (the originating query/client).
*   **Resolution:** A Column Definition Service (CDS) receives the request. CDS performs:
    *   **Data Type Inference:** If hints are absent, CDS scans a sample of related data (e.g., from the same subject identifiers) to infer the data type.  This may involve statistical analysis of value distributions.
    *   **Schema Update:** CDS adds the new column name and inferred data type to the database schema.  A versioning system tracks schema changes.
    *   **Index Creation:** CDS initiates index creation for the new column.
    *   **Response:** CDS sends a confirmation to the originating query, including the column name and data type.

**2. Federated Indexing Architecture:**

*   **Index Sharding:**  Indices are sharded across multiple graph databases (nodes). Sharding key: hash of the column name.
*   **Index Synchronization:** A distributed consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft) ensures index consistency across nodes.
*   **Query Routing:** Query planner identifies relevant index nodes based on the column names in the query. The query is distributed to those nodes.
*   **Result Aggregation:** Results from each index node are aggregated to produce the final query result.

**3. Pseudocode – Query Planner Modification:**

```
function planQuery(query):
  // Existing query planning logic...

  for column in query.columns:
    if column not in database.schema:
      // Initiate Column Definition Request (as described above)
      waitForColumnDefinition(column)

  // Determine index nodes based on sharding key (column name)
  indexNodes = getIndexNodes(query.columns)

  // Distribute query to index nodes
  distributedQuery = createDistributedQuery(query, indexNodes)

  // Execute distributed query
  results = executeDistributedQuery(distributedQuery)

  // Aggregate results
  finalResult = aggregateResults(results)

  return finalResult
```

**4. Data Structures:**

*   **Column Definition Request:**  `{columnName: string, dataTypeHints: array, sourceIdentifier: string}`
*   **Column Definition Response:** `{columnName: string, dataType: string}`
*   **Distributed Query:** `{query: string, targetNodes: array}`
*   **Index Node:** `[IP address, port, responsible columns]`

**5. Considerations:**

*   **Data Type Conflicts:** Implement a robust data type validation mechanism to prevent conflicts when dynamically adding columns.
*   **Index Update Propagation:**  Ensure that index updates are propagated efficiently across all shards.
*   **Schema Versioning:**  Maintain a version history of the database schema to support rollback and auditing.
*   **Security:** Implement access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized column creation.
