## Adaptive Policy Mirroring & Cross-VM Learning

**Concept:** Extend the learning mode concept to not only define rules for a *single* VM, but to create a dynamic, mirrored policy set across *multiple* VMs, and learn from the network activity of all of them. This allows for proactive policy creation for new VMs based on observed behavior of existing, similar systems.

**Specification:**

**1. VM Categorization & Tagging:**

*   Each VM will be assigned one or more categories/tags (e.g., "Web Server", "Database", "Analytics", "Dev Environment"). These tags are user-defined and can be dynamically updated.
*   Tags represent functional roles and common characteristics.

**2.  Policy Mirroring Profiles:**

*   Administrators define “Policy Mirroring Profiles”. These profiles specify:
    *   A source VM category (e.g., “Web Server”).
    *   A target VM category (e.g., “New Web Server”).
    *   A mirroring “strength” (0-100%). This determines how aggressively policies from source VMs are applied to target VMs. 100% means a full copy (with potential overrides, see section 4).

**3.  Learning Mode Enhancement:**

*   Extend the learning mode to operate on *groups* of VMs matching specific categories.
*   During learning, network traffic is analyzed *across all VMs in the group*.
*   The system builds a consolidated policy set representing the *collective* network behavior of the group.
*   This consolidated policy is represented as a directed graph, where nodes are network connections (source/destination IP/Port) and edges represent permitted/denied traffic.

**4.  Policy Application & Overrides:**

*   When a new VM is created and assigned a target category, the system automatically applies the mirrored policy from the source category.
*   A "policy override" system allows administrators or automated processes to selectively modify the mirrored policy for specific VMs.
*   Overrides are logged and can be audited.

**5.  Dynamic Policy Adaptation:**

*   Monitor network traffic *continuously* across all VMs.
*   If a new, previously unseen network connection is observed, the system flags it for review.
*   Administrators can approve/deny the new connection, which automatically updates the consolidated policy and applies it to all mirrored VMs.

**Pseudocode (Policy Application):**

```
function applyMirroredPolicy(newVM, sourceCategory, mirroringStrength) {
  // Get consolidated policy for sourceCategory
  consolidatedPolicy = getConsolidatedPolicy(sourceCategory)

  // Apply policy to newVM
  for each rule in consolidatedPolicy {
    // Apply rule with probability mirroringStrength
    if (random() < mirroringStrength) {
      applyRule(newVM, rule)
    }
  }

  // Add default deny rule (all traffic blocked unless explicitly allowed)
  addDefaultDenyRule(newVM)
}

function applyRule(vm, rule) {
  // Implement rule application (e.g., add firewall rule)
  // based on rule's source/destination IP/Port/Protocol
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **VM Metadata:**  { VM ID, Category Tags }
*   **Policy Mirroring Profile:** { Source Category, Target Category, Mirroring Strength }
*   **Consolidated Policy:**  Directed graph representing permitted/denied network connections.  Nodes: { Source IP, Destination IP, Port, Protocol }.  Edges: { Permitted/Denied }.
*   **Policy Override:** { VM ID, Override Rule }
