## Adaptive Query Plan ‘Shadowing’ & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the engine-independent optimization by introducing ‘shadow’ query execution alongside live queries. This allows for real-time performance prediction and pre-emptive plan adjustments *before* resource contention impacts user experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** ‘Shadow Executor’ - a lightweight process mirroring the primary query engine. Receives a copy of all incoming query requests *before* they are dispatched to the primary engine.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Query Request arrives.
    2.  Request is duplicated. One copy goes to the primary engine, the other to the Shadow Executor.
    3.  The Shadow Executor generates its own optimized plan (using the system described in the patent), but *does not execute it fully*.  It executes enough to gather key performance metrics: estimated execution time, I/O operations, CPU usage, memory allocation.
    4.  Metrics are fed into a ‘Performance Prediction Model’ – a machine learning algorithm trained on historical query performance and resource availability.
    5.  The Prediction Model forecasts the likely performance of *both* the original plan and the Shadow Executor’s plan.
    6.  If the Shadow plan is predicted to significantly outperform the original, a ‘Plan Swap’ mechanism intervenes, replacing the original plan with the Shadow plan *before* the query reaches the primary engine’s resource allocation stage.
*   **Plan Swap Mechanism:** A real-time plan replacement system with built-in rollback capabilities. If the swapped plan fails or performs poorly, the original plan is automatically reinstated.
*   **Performance Prediction Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a dataset of query characteristics (complexity, data size, filters), resource availability (CPU, memory, disk I/O), and historical query performance metrics.
*   **Resource Prioritization:**  The Shadow Executor runs at a low priority to minimize impact on live query performance.  It only needs to execute enough of the plan to gather sufficient performance data.
*   **Monitoring & Feedback:** Continuous monitoring of both live and Shadow query performance.  Data is fed back into the Performance Prediction Model to improve its accuracy.
*   **Pseudocode (Plan Swap Decision):**

```
function decidePlanSwap(originalPlan, shadowPlan, predictionModel) {
  predictedOriginalPerformance = predictionModel.predict(originalPlan)
  predictedShadowPerformance = predictionModel.predict(shadowPlan)

  if (predictedShadowPerformance.estimatedExecutionTime < originalPerformance.estimatedExecutionTime * threshold) {
    // Threshold is a configurable parameter (e.g., 0.8)
    swapPlans(originalPlan, shadowPlan)
    return shadowPlan
  } else {
    return originalPlan
  }
}
```

*   **Configuration Parameters:**  Threshold for plan swap, Shadow Executor priority, data sampling rate for Performance Prediction Model.
