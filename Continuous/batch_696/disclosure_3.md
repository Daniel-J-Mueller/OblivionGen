## Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Orchestration for Dynamic Network Topology

**Concept:** Expand the network's capacity and resilience by dynamically establishing temporary network locations ("nodes") using a swarm of smaller, specialized autonomous vehicles. These 'node' vehicles aren’t transporting *items* directly, but deploying temporary infrastructure to facilitate transport – think mini-landing pads, charging stations, or even localized weather shielding.

**Specifications:**

*   **Vehicle Types:**
    *   **Transport Vehicles (TV):** Similar to existing autonomous vehicles in the patent – primary item carriers.
    *   **Node Deployment Vehicles (NDV):** Smaller, highly agile vehicles carrying modular infrastructure components (landing pads, charging coils, weather shields, communication relays). NDVs have limited item carrying capacity, focusing on infrastructure deployment.
    *   **Central Orchestration System (COS):** Cloud-based system managing the overall network, including NDV and TV allocation, route planning, and dynamic node creation.
*   **Node Infrastructure Modules:**
    *   **Landing Pad Module:** Lightweight, rapidly deployable landing surface for TV.
    *   **Charging Coil Module:** Wireless charging capability for TV.
    *   **Weather Shield Module:** Deployable shield protecting items from rain, snow, or strong winds.
    *   **Communication Relay Module:** Extends communication range in areas with poor signal.
*   **Dynamic Node Creation Procedure:**
    1.  COS identifies a congested route or an area lacking infrastructure.
    2.  COS dispatches NDVs to the identified location.
    3.  NDVs autonomously assemble the required infrastructure modules, creating a temporary network node.
    4.  COS updates the network topology and reroutes TVs through the new node.
    5.  After a defined period or when demand decreases, NDVs disassemble the infrastructure and return to a central depot, or relocate to another area needing support.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Vehicles communicate via a mesh network utilizing both direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication and a centralized server.
    *   Communication packets contain location data, status information, and infrastructure availability.
*   **Path Planning Algorithm:**
    *   Modified A* algorithm incorporating:
        *   Real-time traffic data.
        *   Infrastructure availability (nodes, charging stations).
        *   Weather conditions.
        *   Vehicle capabilities (e.g., payload capacity, battery life).
        *   Estimated cost of using different nodes/routes.
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Wireless charging at nodes utilizing standard charging protocols.
    *   Battery swapping at central depots.
    *   Energy harvesting technologies (solar, wind) on NDVs to supplement power.

**Pseudocode (COS Node Creation):**

```
function createNode(location, infrastructureList):
  // Check available NDVs
  availableNDVs = getAvailableNDVs()

  // Dispatch NDVs to location
  for each ndv in availableNDVs:
    dispatchNDV(ndv, location)

  // NDVs autonomously assemble infrastructure
  for each ndv in dispatchedNDVs:
    ndv.assembleInfrastructure(infrastructureList)

  // Update network topology
  updateNetworkTopology(location, infrastructureList)

  return success
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond fixed network locations, creating a fluid, adaptable network that can respond to changing conditions in real-time. This increases network capacity, resilience, and efficiency.
