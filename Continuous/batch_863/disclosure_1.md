## Dynamic Psychoacoustic Masking Profile for Multi-Channel Audio

**Concept:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts gain *not* based on RMS alone, but on a psychoacoustic model of masking. This means identifying frequencies masked by other, louder frequencies in *different channels* and attenuating those masked frequencies to improve clarity and perceived loudness. It builds on the existing RMS leveling but adds a layer of perceptual optimization.

**Specs:**

1.  **Input:** Multi-channel audio stream (stereo, 5.1, 7.1, etc.). Sample rate must be configurable (e.g., 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 96 kHz).
2.  **Psychoacoustic Model:** Implement a model based on critical bands and masking thresholds.  Utilize a model like the Zwicker model or a simplified variant. The system needs configurable parameters for masking threshold calculation.
3.  **Frequency Analysis:**
    *   Perform a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on each audio channel. Window size configurable (e.g., 2048 samples, 4096 samples) with overlap (e.g., 50%, 75%).
    *   Convert STFT data to critical band representation.
4.  **Masking Calculation:**
    *   For each critical band in each channel, determine the masking threshold based on the energy in surrounding bands *across all channels*.  
    *   The masking threshold is the level below which a sound is inaudible due to masking.
    *   This will require a matrix calculation to account for inter-channel masking effects.
5.  **Gain Control:**
    *   For each critical band in each channel, compare the energy of the signal to the calculated masking threshold.
    *   If the signal energy is *below* the masking threshold, apply gain to boost the signal.
    *   If the signal energy is *above* the masking threshold, apply gain reduction to prevent clipping or distortion.
    *   Gain control should be smooth to avoid audible artifacts. Implement a time constant (e.g., 50ms - 200ms) for gain adjustments.
6.  **Output:** Modified multi-channel audio stream with dynamically adjusted gain per critical band.
7.  **Parameters:**
    *   `window_size`: STFT window size (samples).
    *   `overlap`: STFT overlap percentage.
    *   `time_constant`: Gain adjustment time constant (ms).
    *   `masking_model_type`: Selectable masking model (Zwicker, simplified, etc.).
    *   `critical_band_count`: Number of critical bands to use.
    *   `channel_count`: Input number of audio channels.
8.  **Pseudocode (simplified):**

```pseudocode
// For each audio frame:
for each channel in channels:
    stft_data = perform_stft(channel.audio_data, window_size, overlap)
    critical_bands = convert_stft_to_critical_bands(stft_data, critical_band_count)

    for each critical_band in critical_bands:
        //Calculate inter channel masking
        masking_threshold = calculate_masking_threshold(critical_band, channels)

        //Calculate gain needed
        gain = calculate_gain(critical_band.energy, masking_threshold)

        //Apply gain
        critical_band.energy = critical_band.energy * gain

    //Convert back to time domain
    modified_channel = convert_critical_bands_to_time_domain(critical_bands)

//Output modified channel
```

9.  **Hardware Requirements:**  Sufficient processing power to perform real-time STFT analysis and masking calculations.  A multi-core processor is recommended. Memory requirements depend on the number of channels and window size.
