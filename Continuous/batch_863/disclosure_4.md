## Adaptive Content Reconstruction for Fragmented Displays

**Concept:** Extend adaptive content delivery to accommodate displays comprised of physically separated or fragmented panels (e.g., automotive HUDs with multiple projected elements, large-scale modular displays, dynamic architectural facades). The system reconstructs content *after* delivery, tailoring it to the specific physical arrangement of the display.

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Segmentation & Metadata:**

*   Content is authored or pre-processed with segmentation data.  Each segment corresponds to a logical visual element (e.g., speedometer, navigation arrow, text block).
*   Each segment is tagged with:
    *   Visual priority (critical, important, optional).
    *   Geometric constraints (minimum/maximum size, aspect ratio).
    *   Rendering dependencies (e.g., requires transparency, uses specific shaders).
    *   Semantic meaning (e.g., “speed indicator”, “turn signal”).

**2. Display Mapping Service:**

*   A central service maintains a registry of display configurations.  Configurations include:
    *   Panel count.
    *   Panel physical dimensions & location (coordinates in 3D space).
    *   Panel resolution & capabilities.
    *   Panel connectivity (how panels communicate).
*   Receives a request for content display, including device identifier.
*   Queries registry for the device's current display configuration.
*   Calculates optimal content mapping. This involves:
    *   Determining which segments can fit within each panel.
    *   Prioritizing critical segments.
    *   Handling segments that span multiple panels (e.g., wrapping text).
    *   Adjusting segment scale and orientation to fit available space.

**3. Reconstruction Engine (Client-Side):**

*   Receives content segments (media files) and display mapping data from the service.
*   Dynamically recomposes the content based on the mapping. This involves:
    *   Loading appropriate media assets for each segment.
    *   Applying transformations (scale, rotation, translation) to fit segments into allocated panel spaces.
    *   Handling overlapping or clipped segments (e.g., smooth transitions, partial rendering).
    *   Rendering the reconstructed content onto the fragmented display.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Engine):**

```
function reconstructContent(segments[], mappingData) {
  for each segment in segments {
    panelID = mappingData.getPanelForSegment(segment.id)
    if (panelID == null) {
      // Segment cannot be displayed
      continue
    }
    transform = mappingData.getTransformForSegment(segment.id)
    // Apply transform to segment’s rendering data
    segment.render(transform)
    // Render segment onto corresponding panel
    panel.render(segment)
  }
}
```

**4.  Dynamic Adjustment & Error Handling:**

*   The system monitors panel status (online/offline, brightness, color calibration).
*   If a panel fails, the reconstruction engine dynamically re-maps content to remaining panels, prioritizing critical segments.
*   Error handling includes:
    *   Displaying error messages on available panels.
    *   Reducing content complexity to fit remaining display space.
    *   Automatically contacting support services.

**Innovation:** Extends the concept of adaptive delivery beyond simple resolution/bandwidth constraints to address physically fragmented displays.  Enables seamless content experiences on emerging display technologies, providing a flexible and robust solution for dynamic environments.
