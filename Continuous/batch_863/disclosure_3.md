## Automated Inventory Rotation System – ‘ShelfLife’

**System Overview:** A fully automated system for managing inventory expiration dates and proactively rotating stock based on ‘First Expired, First Out’ (FEFO) principles. This builds upon image-based inventory counting by adding predictive analysis and robotic actuation.

**Core Components:**

*   **Multi-Spectral Imaging Array:** A camera array integrated into shelving units capturing not only visual RGB data but also near-infrared (NIR) and potentially UV spectrum data. NIR/UV data assists in identifying subtle variations in packaging materials which may indicate degradation even *before* visual defects appear.
*   **AI-Powered Degradation Prediction Module:** A machine learning model trained on datasets of product degradation patterns (visual, spectral, and environmental factors). This module analyzes image data to *predict* remaining shelf life for each item, not simply relying on expiration dates.
*   **Robotic Actuator System:** Miniature, shelf-integrated robotic arms capable of gently moving items forward or laterally to facilitate FEFO. These arms operate within the shelving structure, minimizing disruption to ongoing inventory operations.
*   **Centralized Inventory Management System (CIMS):** A software platform integrating image analysis, degradation prediction, robotic control, and order fulfillment.
*   **Environmental Sensor Suite:** Integrated temperature, humidity, and light sensors providing real-time environmental data to refine degradation prediction models.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Continuous Scanning:** Multi-spectral cameras continuously scan inventory, capturing images and environmental data.
2.  **Image Processing & Object Recognition:** AI algorithms identify individual items and their positions within the shelving unit.
3.  **Degradation Prediction:** The AI module analyzes image data (visual & spectral) combined with environmental data to predict the remaining shelf life of each item.
4.  **FEFO Prioritization:** The CIMS prioritizes items based on predicted expiration dates, implementing a FEFO strategy.
5.  **Robotic Actuation:** Miniature robotic arms automatically move items to the front of the shelf, ensuring that items closest to expiration are selected first for picking/fulfillment.
6.  **Alert System:** CIMS generates alerts for items approaching expiration, allowing for proactive intervention (e.g., price reduction, targeted marketing).

**Pseudocode (Robotic Actuation Module):**

```
FUNCTION ActuateShelf(shelfID, itemID)

  // Retrieve item coordinates (x, y, z) and dimensions from inventory database
  item_coords = GetItemCoordinates(itemID)
  item_dims = GetItemDimensions(itemID)

  // Calculate desired final coordinates (front of shelf, aligned)
  final_coords = CalculateFinalCoordinates(item_coords, shelfID)

  // Generate robot motion path (smooth, collision-avoidance)
  motion_path = GenerateMotionPath(item_coords, final_coords, shelfID)

  // Execute motion path using robotic arm
  ExecuteMotionPath(motion_path)

  // Update inventory database with new item coordinates
  UpdateItemCoordinates(itemID, final_coords)

END FUNCTION
```
