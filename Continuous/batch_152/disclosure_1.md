## Decentralized Key Sharding with Biometric Attestation

**Concept:** Expand the two-key system to a distributed key sharding system combined with biometric attestation for enhanced security and user control. Instead of a single first and second private key, the user’s encryption key is split into multiple “shares” distributed across secure enclaves on the user’s devices (phones, laptops, dedicated hardware tokens). Decryption requires a quorum of shares *and* biometric verification before assembly and use.

**Specs:**

1.  **Key Sharding Algorithm:** Employ a Shamir's Secret Sharing (or similar) algorithm. The original encryption key is split into *n* shares. Any *k* shares (where *k* < *n*) are required to reconstruct the key.
2.  **Secure Enclave Distribution:** Each share is stored within a dedicated secure enclave (e.g., ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX) on a user-owned device. These enclaves prevent key material from being exposed to the main operating system.
3.  **Biometric Attestation Layer:** Before a share is released for decryption participation, the device *must* pass biometric attestation. This involves verifying the user's identity via fingerprint, facial recognition, voice analysis, or a combination. This verifies physical presence and authorization.
4.  **Dynamic Quorum Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts the required quorum (*k*) based on risk assessment. Factors include location (e.g., high-risk area), network conditions, and user behavior. Higher risk = higher quorum requirement.
5.  **Decentralized Assembly:** When the user requests decryption, a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Raft, Paxos) is initiated among the devices holding shares. Each device verifies biometric attestation before contributing its share.
6.  **Temporary Key Reconstruction:** The encryption key is reconstructed *only* within a secure, temporary enclave. The key is never stored in a persistent state outside the enclave. Reconstruction duration is minimized.
7.  **Partial Decryption Protocol:** The system leverages a layered cryptographic approach. The reconstructed key decrypts a layer of encryption. The initial data encryption uses a more robust encryption schema to safeguard data even with key compromise.
8.  **Adaptive Share Distribution:** Algorithmically redistribute key shares based on usage patterns and device accessibility. If a device is rarely used or inaccessible, its share is moved to a more reliable device.
9. **Off-Chain Data Validation:** Utilize a decentralized identity (DID) framework to validate device and user identities before any key sharing occurs.

**Pseudocode (Decryption Flow):**

```
function decryptData(encryptedData):
    // 1. Initiate decryption request
    requestShares()

    // 2. Gather shares from devices
    shares = gatherShares()

    // 3. Verify biometric attestation on each device
    for each share in shares:
        if not verifyBiometricAttestation(share.device):
            rejectRequest("Biometric verification failed")

    // 4. Reconstruct encryption key
    key = reconstructKey(shares)

    // 5. Decrypt data
    decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData, key)

    // 6. Return decrypted data
    return decryptedData
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Devices with secure enclaves (ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX)
*   Biometric sensors (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.)
*   Secure communication channels between devices
*   Distributed consensus protocol implementation
*   Cryptographic libraries
*   Decentralized identity (DID) framework integration

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security: Key compromise is much harder as multiple devices/factors are required.
*   User control: User controls access via biometric verification.
*   Resilience: System can tolerate the loss of some devices.
*   Scalability: System can be scaled to a large number of devices.
