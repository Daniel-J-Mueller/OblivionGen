## Temporal Resource Shadowing & Predictive Recovery

**Concept:** Extend the resource recovery system to not only retain deleted resources but also proactively *shadow* resources nearing deletion based on predicted user behavior, creating a "temporal shadow" enabling rollback to states *before* a delete request is even issued.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** User activity logs (API calls, console actions, etc.) associated with resource creation, modification, and deletion. Metadata includes timestamps, user ID, resource type, and operation type.
*   **Process:** Employ time-series analysis and machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, transformers) to predict the probability of resource deletion within defined time windows (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week). Consider seasonality, daily patterns, and individual user habits. Generate a "Deletion Risk Score" for each resource.
*   **Output:** Deletion Risk Score, predicted deletion timestamp (if applicable), and resource metadata.

**2. Shadowing Service:**

*   **Input:** Deletion Risk Score, resource metadata, configured threshold for triggering shadowing.
*   **Process:** If the Deletion Risk Score exceeds the threshold, initiate resource shadowing. Shadowing involves creating point-in-time copies (snapshots, clones, or differential backups) of the resource at regular intervals.  Store these shadow copies in a separate, high-performance storage tier.  The frequency of shadow copy creation is dynamically adjusted based on the Deletion Risk Score – higher risk = more frequent copies.
*   **Output:**  Confirmation of shadowing initiation, ID of shadow copies created, and ongoing monitoring of shadow copy creation.

**3.  Predictive Recovery Interface:**

*   **Input:**  User request for resource recovery.
*   **Process:**
    *   If a resource has been officially deleted (via delete request), proceed as in the existing system.
    *   If a resource *hasn’t* been deleted, but shadowing was active, present the user with a timeline of available shadow copies. Allow the user to "rollback" to any point in the past represented by a shadow copy.
    *   Initiate a restoration process that leverages the shadow copies to revert the resource to the selected point in time.  This may involve restoring a full copy, applying differential backups, or recreating the resource from the available data.
*   **Output:** Restored resource, confirmation of restoration, and a record of the restoration event.

**4.  Retention Policy Extension:**

*   **Integration:** Expand the resource retention policy to include shadow copies. Define separate retention periods for shadow copies vs. officially deleted resources. Allow administrators to configure shadowing behavior (e.g., enable/disable shadowing for specific resource types, adjust shadowing frequency, set maximum shadow copy retention).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Recovery Interface):**

```
function recoverResource(resourceId, recoveryPoint):
  if resourceIsDeleted(resourceId):
    // Existing recovery process
    recoverFromRecoveryBin(resourceId)
  else:
    shadowCopies = getShadowCopies(resourceId)
    if shadowCopies is empty:
      displayMessage("No shadow copies available")
    else:
      selectedShadowCopy = findShadowCopy(shadowCopies, recoveryPoint)
      if selectedShadowCopy is null:
        displayMessage("Invalid recovery point")
      else:
        restoreResourceFromShadowCopy(resourceId, selectedShadowCopy)
        displayMessage("Resource restored to " + recoveryPoint)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced data loss risk
*   Faster recovery times
*   Proactive data protection
*   Increased user control over data retention
*   Enable "what-if" scenarios and experimentation.
