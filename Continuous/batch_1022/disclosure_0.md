## Dynamic Skill Trees for Applications

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive application behavior described in the patent by introducing a ‘skill tree’ concept. Instead of simply presenting choices to move a user toward a goal, the system learns *how* a user prefers to achieve goals and branches out possibilities, essentially creating a personalized “skill tree” within the application itself. This goes beyond simple A/B testing of choices; it’s about building a user’s proficiency *within* the application based on their choices.

**Specifications:**

**1. Skill Node Definition:**

*   Each potential user action (as currently defined in the patent) is represented as a "Skill Node."
*   Each Skill Node has attributes:
    *   `node_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `description`: Text describing the action.
    *   `goal_affinity`: Numerical value indicating how closely the action contributes to the overall goal.
    *   `difficulty`: Numerical value representing the complexity or effort required to execute the action.
    *   `prerequisites`: List of `node_id`s that must be completed before this node can be unlocked.
    *   `unlock_condition`: Boolean expression. Used to determine if the node should even be *displayed* to the user. Can incorporate user profile data, time of day, application state, etc.
    *   `adjacent_nodes`: List of `node_id`s representing possible next steps after completing this node.  (Creates branching paths.)
    *   `reward_function`:  Function that defines the 'reward' given to the user upon completion of the node. This reward affects the user's skill profile (see section 3).

**2. User Skill Profile:**

*   Each user has a "Skill Profile," represented as a dictionary (or similar data structure).
*   Keys in the dictionary are skill categories (e.g., "Data Analysis," "Creative Writing," "Problem Solving").
*   Values are numerical scores representing the user's proficiency in that category.
*   Initial skill scores are based on initial user profile information (if available) or default values.

**3. Skill Tree Generation & Adaptation:**

*   When the application starts or the user reaches a new state, a local skill tree is generated.
*   The root node of the tree is the current application state.
*   The system recursively builds the tree by finding Skill Nodes that meet these criteria:
    *   The node’s prerequisites are met (based on the user’s completed actions).
    *   The node’s unlock condition evaluates to `True`.
*   Nodes are sorted based on a combination of factors:
    *   `goal_affinity` (higher is better).
    *   `difficulty` (balanced with goal affinity – don’t always suggest the easiest option).
    *   User skill scores (suggest nodes that align with existing skills, or challenge the user appropriately).
*   The system presents the top N nodes to the user as choices.
*   Upon user selection, the system updates the user’s skill profile using the `reward_function` associated with the selected node.
*   This update impacts future skill tree generation.

**4.  Dynamic Node Creation & Refinement:**

*   The system monitors user behavior.
*   If a user consistently performs a sequence of actions *not* represented in the existing skill nodes, the system can dynamically create a new skill node to represent that sequence.
*   This new node can then be integrated into the skill tree, enriching the user experience.
*   The system should also *refine* existing nodes based on user behavior. For example, if a certain node consistently leads to positive outcomes, its `goal_affinity` score can be increased.

**Pseudocode (Skill Tree Generation):**

```
function generate_skill_tree(user_profile, current_app_state, existing_skill_nodes):
  local skill_tree = new SkillTree()
  skill_tree.root = current_app_state

  function populate_tree(node, depth):
    if depth > max_depth:
      return

    eligible_nodes = []
    for node in existing_skill_nodes:
      if node.prerequisites_met(user_profile) and node.unlock_condition_true():
        eligible_nodes.append(node)

    eligible_nodes.sort(by: [goal_affinity, difficulty, user_skill_alignment])

    for node in eligible_nodes:
      skill_tree.add_node(node)
      populate_tree(node, depth + 1)

  populate_tree(skill_tree.root, 0)
  return skill_tree
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   Requires a robust data model to represent skill nodes and user profiles.
*   Efficient algorithms are needed to search and sort skill nodes.
*   A mechanism for persisting user skill profiles is necessary.
*   The system should be designed to handle a large number of skill nodes.
*   Consider using machine learning techniques to automatically refine skill node attributes and personalize the skill tree.
