## Real-time Proximity-Based Collaborative Annotation System

**Concept:** Leverage real-time location data & visual capture to facilitate collaborative annotation *directly onto* a shared augmented reality view of a physical space during a meeting. This expands beyond individual attendee annotation to a dynamically shared, spatial canvas.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Mobile devices with:
    *   High-resolution cameras
    *   GPS/Location Services
    *   ARKit/ARCore compatibility
    *   Microphones
*   Optional: Dedicated AR Headsets (for enhanced experience, but not required)
*   Network connectivity (WiFi/Cellular)

**Software Components:**

*   **Central Server:** Manages meeting sessions, participant data, location data synchronization, annotation storage, and AR scene broadcasting.
*   **Mobile Client Application:** Captures camera feed, acquires location data, renders AR scene, manages user annotations, facilitates audio communication.
*   **AR Scene Engine:** Renders a dynamic, shared AR representation of the meeting space based on sensor data and server-provided geometry.
*   **Annotation Module:** Handles creation, editing, and synchronization of annotations (text, drawings, 3D models) within the AR scene.

**System Architecture:**

1.  **Meeting Initiation:** A host initiates a meeting through the mobile application or web interface, specifying a physical location (or allowing automatic detection based on participant locations).
2.  **Participant Join:** Participants join the meeting. The system acquires their location and associates them with their device.
3.  **AR Scene Generation:** The server generates an initial AR scene representing the meeting space. This could involve using pre-loaded 3D models of the space, or reconstructing it from live sensor data (cameras, LiDAR).
4.  **Location Tracking & Synchronization:** The system continuously tracks the location of each participant's device and synchronizes their positions within the AR scene.
5.  **Collaborative Annotation:** Participants can create annotations directly onto surfaces and objects within the AR scene using the mobile appâ€™s touch interface or voice commands. These annotations are immediately visible to all other participants in real-time.
6.  **Spatial Audio Integration:** Audio communication is spatially localized within the AR scene.  Participants hear each other's voices as if they were physically present at their location within the space.
7.  **Persistent Annotation Storage:** Annotations are stored persistently, allowing meetings to be revisited and annotations to be reviewed or updated later.

**Pseudocode (Mobile Client - Annotation Creation):**

```
function onSurfaceDetected(surfaceID, surfaceCoordinates):
    // Get user input (text, drawing, 3D model)
    userInput = getUserInput()

    // Create annotation object
    annotation = {
        type: userInput.type,
        content: userInput.content,
        position: surfaceCoordinates,
        owner: userID
    }

    // Send annotation to server
    sendAnnotationToServer(annotation)

function sendAnnotationToServer(annotation):
    // Establish network connection
    connection = establishNetworkConnection()

    // Serialize annotation object
    serializedAnnotation = serialize(annotation)

    // Send serialized annotation to server
    send(connection, serializedAnnotation)

    // Close connection
    close(connection)

function receiveAnnotationFromServer():
    // Establish network connection
    connection = establishNetworkConnection()

    // Receive serialized annotation
    serializedAnnotation = receive(connection)

    // Deserialize annotation
    annotation = deserialize(serializedAnnotation)

    // Render annotation in AR scene
    renderAnnotationInARScene(annotation)

    // Close connection
    close(connection)
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply displaying attendee locations or individual annotations. It creates a shared, persistent AR canvas that is anchored to the physical space. This allows for truly collaborative brainstorming, design reviews, and problem-solving.  The spatial audio component further enhances the sense of presence and collaboration. A 'history' layer is enabled in the AR system, where previous annotations, and user 'paths' are recorded in space.
