## Predictive Hot-Swap & Load Balancing with Distributed Sensing

**Concept:** Expand the redundant UPS control system to proactively identify failing components *before* discrepancies trigger a swap, and dynamically balance load across UPS units based on predicted health and efficiency. This moves beyond reactive redundancy to *predictive* resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Distributed Sensor Network:**

*   **Sensor Types:** Each UPS unit will be equipped with an expanded sensor suite beyond voltage/current/temp. Include:
    *   **Acoustic Emission Sensors:** Detect subtle changes in fan/component vibration indicative of wear/failure.
    *   **Partial Discharge Sensors:**  Monitor for insulation breakdown in capacitors/transformers.
    *   **Thermal Gradient Sensors:** Identify hotspots *before* exceeding thermal limits.
    *   **Gas Sensors:** (Within enclosed UPS units) – Detect early signs of component overheating/decomposition.
*   **Sensor Placement:** Strategically place sensors on critical components (capacitors, transformers, fans, power supplies) and within airflow paths.
*   **Communication:** Sensors connect via a localized, high-speed communication bus (e.g., EtherCAT, TSN) to a dedicated edge processing unit within each UPS.

**2. Edge Processing & Local Model Training:**

*   **Edge Unit:** Each UPS will house a small form factor computer with GPU acceleration.
*   **ML Models:** Locally train machine learning models (e.g., anomaly detection, regression) on sensor data. Models should learn the normal operating characteristics of each individual UPS unit.
*   **Model Types:**
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify deviations from baseline sensor readings.
    *   **Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction:** Estimate the time remaining before a component is likely to fail.
    *   **Efficiency Modeling:** Track UPS efficiency based on load and operating conditions.
*   **Federated Learning:** Periodically aggregate model updates from all UPS units to a central server for global model improvement, without sharing raw sensor data.

**3. Centralized Predictive Analytics & Load Balancing:**

*   **Central Server:** A central server collects aggregated model updates and health scores from all UPS units.
*   **Predictive Health Scoring:** Assign a health score to each UPS based on RUL predictions, efficiency metrics, and anomaly detection.
*   **Load Balancing Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm to dynamically redistribute load across UPS units based on health scores and predicted efficiency.
    *   Prioritize healthy UPS units with high efficiency.
    *   Gradually reduce load on units with declining health.
    *   Implement a “graceful degradation” strategy – shift load *before* a unit reaches critical failure.
*   **Hot-Swap Orchestration:**  Automate the hot-swap process based on predictive health scores.  Initiate replacement of failing components *proactively*, before outages occur.

**4. System Communication & Control:**

*   **Communication Protocol:** Utilize a secure, high-bandwidth communication protocol (e.g., OPC UA, MQTT) for communication between UPS units, the central server, and building management systems.
*   **API Integration:** Provide a REST API for integration with existing power monitoring and control systems.
*   **Alerting & Visualization:**  Develop a dashboard for visualizing UPS health, load distribution, and predictive maintenance recommendations.  Provide real-time alerts for potential failures.

**Pseudocode (Load Balancing Algorithm):**

```
// Define weights for health score and efficiency
health_weight = 0.6
efficiency_weight = 0.4

// Calculate a combined score for each UPS
for each UPS in UPS_list:
    combined_score = (health_score * health_weight) + (efficiency * efficiency_weight)
    UPS.score = combined_score

// Sort UPS units by score in descending order
sorted_UPS_list = sort(UPS_list, key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True)

// Distribute load proportionally to score
total_load = calculate_total_load()
for each UPS in sorted_UPS_list:
    UPS.target_load = (UPS.score / total_score) * total_load

// Implement load shifting mechanism
// (e.g., migrate virtual machines, adjust power distribution)
