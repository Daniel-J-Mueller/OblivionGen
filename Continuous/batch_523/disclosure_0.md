## Dynamic Regional Sharding with Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Extend the existing failover capability to a dynamic regional sharding system. Instead of simply failing *to* a region, actively shard traffic *across* multiple regions based on predicted load *and* potential failure scenarios. This moves beyond pure redundancy to proactive optimization and resilience.

**Specs:**

*   **Component: Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE)**
    *   Input: Real-time metrics from all regions (CPU, memory, network latency, disk I/O, application-specific metrics). Historical performance data. Geo-location of data sources/clients. External data feeds (e.g., weather patterns impacting regional connectivity).
    *   Processing: Machine learning models to predict regional load *and* probability of failure (using time-series analysis, anomaly detection, correlation with external events). Models should be continuously trained and updated.
    *   Output:  Dynamic sharding weights for each region. A prioritized list of failover regions, beyond the primary/secondary designation.
*   **Component: Sharding Proxy (SP)**
    *   Location: Deployed as a front-end proxy for all incoming requests.
    *   Functionality:
        *   Receives requests.
        *   Consults PAE for current sharding weights.
        *   Routes requests to appropriate region(s) based on weights.
        *   Monitors health of backend servers in each region.
        *   Adjusts routing dynamically based on health checks and PAE updates.
    *   Configuration:
        *   `ShardingPolicy`: Configurable policy defining how requests are distributed (e.g., round robin, weighted random, geographic proximity).
        *   `HealthCheckInterval`:  Interval for performing health checks.
        *   `PAEUpdateInterval`: Interval for receiving updates from the PAE.
*   **Component: Regional Endpoint Manager (REM)**
    *   Location: Deployed in each region.
    *   Functionality:
        *   Registers available backend servers with the SP.
        *   Reports health status of backend servers.
        *   Handles request routing within the region.
        *   Applies regional-specific policies (e.g., security rules, data residency requirements).
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Client sends request to SP.
    2.  SP queries PAE for sharding weights.
    3.  PAE returns weights based on predicted load/failure.
    4.  SP routes request to REM in appropriate region.
    5.  REM routes request to available backend server.
    6.  Backend server processes request and returns response.
    7.  REM forwards response to SP.
    8.  SP forwards response to client.
*   **Pseudocode (SP â€“ Request Routing):**

```
function routeRequest(request):
  weights = PAE.getShardingWeights()
  region = selectRegion(weights)  // Weighted random selection
  REM = getREM(region)
  REM.forwardRequest(request)
```

*   **Failure Scenario Adaptation:**  If a region becomes unavailable, the PAE immediately recalculates sharding weights and directs all traffic to the remaining healthy regions. The system automatically scales resources in the surviving regions to handle the increased load.

*   **Policy Integration:** REMs can enforce regional-specific policies (e.g., data residency) during request processing. This ensures compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
