## Dynamic Audio Scene Reconstruction for Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Leveraging the bandwidth-saving techniques described in the patent (sending duration instead of full audio) to create a real-time, localized audio scene reconstruction for augmented reality applications. Instead of solely focusing on wakeword detection, we capture and transmit *summary data* of the surrounding soundscape to build a dynamic 3D audio model.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Primary Device: Wireless earbud with multi-microphone array (minimum 4 mics for spatial audio capture).  Dedicated low-power audio processing unit.
    *   Secondary Device: Wireless earbud (paired with primary).
    *   Host Device: Mobile phone or AR glasses with processing capabilities.
*   **Data Capture & Transmission:**
    1.  The primary earbud continuously captures ambient audio.
    2.  Real-time spectral analysis (FFT or similar) is performed on the audio.
    3.  Dominant frequency bands and their amplitudes are identified.  Instead of transmitting raw audio, the system transmits the following data packets:
        *   Frequency Band ID (e.g., 250Hz-500Hz, 1kHz-2kHz, etc.)
        *   Amplitude (dB)
        *   Estimated Direction of Arrival (DoA) â€“ derived from microphone array processing.
        *   Duration/Timestamp of the detected sound event within that frequency band.
    4.  Transmission is prioritized based on changes in the soundscape. Significant amplitude changes or new frequency bands trigger immediate data transmission.  Smaller changes are aggregated and sent in periodic batches.
    5.  Transmission utilizes a compressed data format to minimize bandwidth usage, building on the existing 'duration' transmission strategy of the original patent.
*   **Host Device Processing:**
    1.  The host device receives the summarized audio data from the primary earbud.
    2.  A 3D audio scene reconstruction algorithm builds a spatial audio model of the surrounding environment. This model represents the location and intensity of different sound sources.
    3.  The host device utilizes the spatial audio model to render augmented reality sounds realistically, enhancing the sense of immersion. For example, if an AR application places a virtual object in the room, the device can simulate sound emanating from that object as if it were physically present.
    4.  The system dynamically adjusts the spatial audio rendering based on the user's head movements (using IMU data from the host device).
*   **Synchronization:**
    *   The system employs a precise time synchronization protocol between the primary earbud, the secondary earbud, and the host device to ensure accurate spatial audio rendering.
    *   The secondary earbud receives the summarized scene data to mirror the soundscape reconstruction performed on the host device.
*   **Pseudocode (Host Device):**

```
function process_audio_data(frequency_band, amplitude, doa, timestamp):
  scene_model.update_sound_source(frequency_band, amplitude, doa, timestamp)

function render_spatial_audio():
  head_rotation = get_head_rotation()
  spatial_audio_output = scene_model.render(head_rotation)
  play_audio(spatial_audio_output)
```

**Innovation & Differentiation:**

This expands the bandwidth-saving concept beyond wakeword detection to create a fully dynamic, localized audio scene reconstruction. It transforms the earbuds from simple audio playback devices into spatial audio capture and rendering systems, enabling new AR experiences and improving immersion. It also introduces a new method for environmental awareness, allowing AR applications to react to the user's sonic surroundings.
