## Personalized Auditory Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leverage the personalization framework to dynamically reconstruct auditory scenes tailored to a user's cognitive state and environmental context, beyond simple content ranking or classification. This moves beyond *what* content is presented, to *how* it is perceived.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Feature Engineering:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data streams from:
    *   Speech processing system (existing – user vocal characteristics, spoken content).
    *   Wearable physiological sensors (EEG, heart rate variability, skin conductance – indicating cognitive load, emotional state).
    *   Environmental sensors (microphones, cameras, location data – capturing ambient sound, visual context, spatial awareness).
2.  **Cognitive State Modeling:**
    *   Train a machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network preferred) to infer user cognitive state (e.g., focused, relaxed, distracted, stressed) from physiological data. Output a vector representing the cognitive state.
3.  **Environmental Soundscape Analysis:**
    *   Employ source separation techniques to decompose the ambient soundscape into individual sound events (e.g., speech, music, traffic, nature sounds).
    *   Analyze each sound event’s characteristics (frequency, amplitude, duration, spatial location).
4.  **Feature Vector Creation:** Combine features from:
    *   User cognitive state vector.
    *   Analyzed environmental soundscape (sound event types, characteristics).
    *   User profile data (preferences, history – existing in the personalization framework).

**II. Auditory Scene Reconstruction Engine:**

1.  **Generative Audio Model:** Utilize a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on a large dataset of audio scenes.
2.  **Dynamic Scene Generation:**
    *   Input the combined feature vector (from I) into the generative model.
    *   The model generates a modified auditory scene, altering characteristics of existing sound events and/or introducing new ones.  Specifically:
        *   **Emphasis/Suppression:** Increase or decrease the amplitude of specific sound events based on the user’s cognitive state (e.g., suppress distracting noises when focused, enhance calming sounds when stressed).
        *   **Spatialization:** Adjust the perceived spatial location of sound events to create a more immersive or focused listening experience.
        *   **Acoustic Environment Simulation:**  Simulate different acoustic environments (e.g., adding reverb to create a sense of spaciousness, filtering out background noise to improve clarity).
        *   **Sound Event Augmentation:**  Introduce subtle sound events (e.g., white noise, nature sounds) to mask distractions or promote relaxation.
3.  **Real-Time Processing:** The entire process (data acquisition, feature engineering, scene reconstruction) must operate in real-time to provide a seamless and responsive listening experience.

**III. System Architecture & Integration:**

1.  **Modular Design:** The system should be designed as a set of independent modules (sensor interface, feature extractor, generative model, audio renderer) to facilitate flexibility and scalability.
2.  **API Integration:** Integrate with the existing personalization framework via a well-defined API to access user profile data and control the generated audio scenes.
3.  **Edge Computing:**  Deploy key components (feature extraction, generative model) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones, smart speakers) to minimize latency and preserve user privacy.

**Pseudocode (Scene Reconstruction Engine):**

```
function reconstructScene(userCognitiveState, environmentalSoundscape, userProfile):
  combinedFeatureVector = concatenate(userCognitiveState, environmentalSoundscape, userProfile)
  generatedAudio = generativeModel.predict(combinedFeatureVector)
  return generatedAudio
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Enhanced Focus & Productivity:**  Dynamically suppress distractions and create a calming auditory environment to improve concentration.
*   **Stress Reduction & Relaxation:**  Generate soothing soundscapes to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation.
*   **Immersive VR/AR Experiences:**  Create realistic and personalized auditory environments for virtual and augmented reality applications.
*   **Assistive Listening Devices:**  Enhance speech clarity and suppress background noise for individuals with hearing impairments.
