## Autonomous Swarm Weight & Balance Calibration System

**Concept:** Extend the PMA functionality to a distributed, self-calibrating system for UAV swarms *before* and *during* flight. This leverages the existing weight/CoM calculation but applies it to multiple, interacting UAVs, and uses that data to dynamically adjust swarm formations and power distribution.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware – Distributed Load Cells & Communication:**

*   **Micro-Load Cell Grid:** Each UAV equipped with a miniature, high-resolution load cell grid embedded into its landing gear/docking interface.  Resolution: 0.1g (0.1 grams) minimum.  Coverage: Minimum 75% of footprint area.
*   **Proximity Communication:** Each UAV utilizes a short-range, high-bandwidth communication protocol (e.g., UWB, 60GHz) to communicate weight/force data *directly* to neighboring UAVs and a designated “Swarm Lead” UAV. Range: 5 meters minimum.
*   **Swarm Lead UAV:**  A designated UAV with enhanced processing and communication capabilities.  This UAV aggregates data from the entire swarm, performs global weight/CoM calculations, and distributes control commands.
*   **Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) Integration:**  Each UAV and docking station equipped with WPT coils. Used for continuous, low-level power delivery to the load cells and communication modules, reducing battery dependence.

**2. Software – Swarm Weight & Balance Algorithm:**

*   **Local Weight Measurement:** Each UAV calculates its *individual* weight distribution across the load cell grid. Data format: Array of force readings (N) for each cell.
*   **Neighboring Force Detection:** Each UAV’s software detects force applied *through* its load cell grid from neighboring UAVs (e.g., if UAVs are docked or closely clustered). Algorithm: Threshold-based force detection + proximity validation.
*   **Distributed Weight Estimation:** Algorithm to estimate the weight and CoM of *adjacent* UAVs, based on detected forces and known footrpints.  Uses Kalman filtering to reduce noise and improve accuracy.
*   **Swarm-Level Weight & CoM Calculation:** Swarm Lead UAV aggregates individual and adjacent UAV data to calculate the total swarm weight, CoM, and moment of inertia.
*   **Dynamic Formation Adjustment:** The Swarm Lead uses the swarm-level weight & CoM data to dynamically adjust the swarm formation to optimize stability, aerodynamic efficiency, and power consumption. Algorithm: Real-time formation control based on particle swarm optimization or other bio-inspired algorithms.
*   **Power Distribution Optimization:** Swarm Lead dynamically allocates power to individual UAVs based on their contribution to the swarm’s load and their remaining battery capacity. Algorithm:  Linear programming or similar optimization technique.
*   **Fault Detection & Isolation:** Software detects abnormal weight distributions or force readings to identify potential UAV malfunctions or structural damage. Triggers alerts and initiates corrective actions.

**3.  Calibration & Training:**

*   **Initial Ground Calibration:** Each UAV undergoes ground calibration using a high-precision scale to establish a baseline for its load cell readings.
*   **Swarm Calibration Routine:** A dedicated routine allows the swarm to calibrate its weight estimation capabilities in-flight, using known reference weights or formations.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Training:** Algorithm learns to optimize swarm formations and power distribution based on real-world performance data and feedback from the environment.



**Pseudocode (Swarm Lead – Power Distribution):**

```
function distributePower(swarmData):
  totalWeight = swarmData.totalWeight
  individualWeights = swarmData.individualWeights
  batteryLevels = swarmData.batteryLevels
  flightTask = swarmData.flightTask

  //Calculate power contribution of each UAV
  for each uav in swarmData.uavs:
    powerContribution[uav] = (individualWeights[uav] / totalWeight) * flightTask.powerRequirement

  //Adjust for battery levels
  for each uav in swarmData.uavs:
    powerAdjustment = (1 - (batteryLevels[uav] / maxBatteryLevel)) * powerContribution[uav]
    powerAllocation[uav] = powerContribution[uav] - powerAdjustment

  //Normalize power allocation
  totalAllocation = sum(powerAllocation)
  for each uav in swarmData.uavs:
    powerAllocation[uav] = (powerAllocation[uav] / totalAllocation) * flightTask.totalPowerBudget

  return powerAllocation
