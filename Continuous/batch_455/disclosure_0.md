## Dynamic Frequency Modulation for Drone Swarm Coordination

**Concept:** Implement a system where individual drones within a swarm modulate the *frequency* of the AC power sent via the wires (as described in the patent) to establish a localized, short-range communication network *in addition* to data embedding within the amplitude/phase. This creates a dynamic, frequency-based 'beacon' system for incredibly precise swarm positioning and coordination, particularly in GPS-denied environments. 

**Specs:**

*   **Frequency Range:** 50kHz - 150kHz.  This range is selected to minimize interference with typical drone motor control frequencies while still providing sufficient bandwidth for basic communication.
*   **Modulation Scheme:** Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) with 4 distinct frequencies representing:
    *   ID Signal (Drone Identifier)
    *   Relative Position Request
    *   Relative Position Update
    *   Emergency Stop/Collision Avoidance
*   **Power Amplification:** Each drone has a small, dedicated amplifier to boost the modulated frequency signal *without* significantly altering the power delivered to the motor.  This amplifier must be highly efficient to minimize power draw.
*   **Receiver Circuitry:** Each drone has a narrow-band receiver tuned to the designated frequency range. The receiver decodes the FSK signal and extracts the drone ID and positional data.
*   **Synchronization:**  A master drone (or external base station) initiates a synchronization sequence.  Each drone transmits its ID signal at a specific time slot. This establishes a baseline timing for the swarm.
*   **Positioning Algorithm:** 
    *   **Trilateration:**  Receiving drones calculate their relative positions based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the frequency signals from neighboring drones.
    *   **Kalman Filtering:** Implemented to smooth out positional data and predict future positions, improving accuracy and responsiveness.
*   **Data Embedding:** Amplitude/phase modulation (as per the patent) is *still* used for transmitting sensor data and control commands, running alongside the frequency modulation.
*   **Wire Configuration:** Maintain the single/few wire connection(s) to each motor, carrying both power and modulated signals.
*   **Antenna:** Utilize the existing motor wires as an antenna. Wire length and configuration must be optimized for this purpose (experimentation required).

**Pseudocode (Position Calculation):**

```
//Drone A receives signal from Drone B
function calculateDistance(timeOfArrivalB, speedOfLight):
  distance = (timeOfArrivalB * speedOfLight)
  return distance

function trilaterate(droneA, droneB, droneC):
  distanceAB = calculateDistance(timeOfArrivalB, speedOfLight)
  distanceAC = calculateDistance(timeOfArrivalC, speedOfLight)
  distanceBC = calculateDistance(timeOfArrivalD, speedOfLight)

  //Solve for X,Y coordinates using trilateration equations
  // (Complex calculation, requires geometry libraries)

  return (X,Y)  //Estimated coordinates of Drone A relative to Drone B,C

function updatePosition():
  //Receive signals from neighboring drones
  //Calculate distances using trilateration
  //Apply Kalman filter to smooth and predict position
  //Update internal position estimate
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Robustness:** Frequency-based communication is less susceptible to electromagnetic interference than traditional radio signals.
*   **Precision:**  Precise timing and trilateration enable accurate swarm positioning.
*   **Scalability:**  Can support a large number of drones in a coordinated swarm.
*   **Reduced Complexity:**  Eliminates the need for separate radio communication modules.
