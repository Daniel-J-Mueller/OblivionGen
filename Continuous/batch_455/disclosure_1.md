## Dynamic Spreadsheet 'Context Cards'

**Concept:** Extend the personalized spreadsheet viewing described in the patent to incorporate dynamic, context-aware 'cards' that appear alongside spreadsheet data, providing just-in-time information and actions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Data Structure: Context Card**

*   **Card Type:** (Enum) – ‘Information’, ‘Action’, ‘Visualization’, ‘Reference’
*   **Triggering Data:** (String) – Specific cell value(s), formula, or data range that initiates card display.  Can include regex patterns for flexible matching.
*   **Card Content:** (JSON) –  Flexible content definition. Includes:
    *   **Title:**  (String) – Card Header.
    *   **Body:** (String/HTML) –  Content of the card.  Supports basic HTML formatting and embedded data references.
    *   **Action Buttons:** (Array of Objects) – Each object defines:
        *   **Label:** (String) – Button text.
        *   **Action Type:** (Enum) – ‘Navigate’, ‘Execute Function’, ‘Open URL’, ‘Update Cell’.
        *   **Parameters:** (JSON) – Data passed to the Action Type.
*   **User Role Filter:** (Array of Strings) – Roles that can see the card. (e.g. ‘Sales’, ‘Finance’, ‘Admin’)
*   **Visibility Rule:** (Boolean Expression) – Advanced conditional visibility based on spreadsheet data or user profile.
*   **Positioning Rule:** (Enum) – ‘Above’, ‘Below’, ‘Left’, ‘Right’ relative to triggering data.  Also 'Floating'.

**2. Spreadsheet Editor Integration**

*   **Card Editor Panel:** Within the spreadsheet editor, a new panel allows users to:
    *   Create new Context Cards.
    *   Define Triggering Data (with cell selection and formula editor).
    *   Design Card Content (WYSIWYG editor).
    *   Define Action Buttons.
    *   Set User Role Filters and Visibility Rules.
*   **Automatic Card Generation (AI Assisted):**  The editor analyzes spreadsheet data and *suggests* potential Context Cards. For example:
    *   If a cell contains a product ID, suggest a card displaying product details from an external database.
    *   If a cell contains a date, suggest a card displaying related tasks or appointments.
    *   If a cell contains a currency value, suggest a card displaying historical exchange rates.

**3. Runtime Behavior**

*   **Dynamic Card Display:** When a user views the spreadsheet, the system identifies Triggering Data and displays corresponding Context Cards.
*   **Card Interaction:** Users can interact with Action Buttons, triggering actions within the spreadsheet or external systems.
*   **Floating Cards:**  Cards can 'float' above the spreadsheet and be re-positioned by the user.
*   **Card Groups:**  Related cards can be grouped together for better organization.

**4.  Pseudocode (Card Rendering)**

```
function renderCards(spreadsheetData, userData) {
  cards = []
  for each cell in spreadsheetData {
    for each card in cardDefinitions {
      if (card.triggeringData matches cell.value) {
        if (userData.role is in card.userRoleFilter or card.userRoleFilter is empty) {
          if (evaluateBooleanExpression(card.visibilityRule, spreadsheetData, userData)) {
            cardInstance = createCardInstance(card, spreadsheetData, userData)
            cardInstance.position = determineCardPosition(card.positioningRule, cell)
            cards.push(cardInstance)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  return cards
}
```

**5.  Extended Functionality (Future Development)**

*   **Card Templates:** Pre-built card templates for common use cases.
*   **Card Marketplace:** A platform for sharing and selling custom card templates.
*   **AI-Powered Card Generation:**  Automatically generate context cards based on user intent and data analysis.
*   **Real-Time Card Updates:**  Update card content in real-time based on data changes.
