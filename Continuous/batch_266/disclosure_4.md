## Dynamic Initialization Vector Watermarking

**Concept:** Extend the initialization vector (IV) not just for content type, but to embed a dynamic, per-sample watermark imperceptible to standard decryption, bolstering content authentication and tracking.

**Specification:**

1.  **Watermark Generation:**
    *   A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded with a master key and a unique content ID generates a watermark value for each media sample.
    *   The watermark value is a bitstring.
2.  **IV Structure:**
    *   The IV will be expanded to include:
        *   2 bits: Content Type (as in the original patent).
        *   8 bits: Watermark Value (from the generated bitstring).
        *   Remaining bits: Cryptographic Nonce & Counter (AES-CTR mode compatible).
3.  **Encryption Process:**
    *   For each sample:
        *   Generate watermark value.
        *   Construct IV with content type, watermark, nonce, and counter.
        *   Encrypt sample using AES-CTR with constructed IV and encryption key.
4.  **Decryption & Verification:**
    *   Upon decryption:
        *   Extract content type, watermark, nonce, and counter from IV.
        *   Verify content type.
        *   Extract watermark value.
        *   A separate watermark extraction module (seeded with the master key and content ID) regenerates the expected watermark value for that sample.
        *   Compare extracted watermark with regenerated watermark. A mismatch indicates potential tampering or unauthorized distribution.

**Pseudocode (Decryption & Verification):**

```
function VerifyWatermark(IV, ContentID, MasterKey, EncryptedSample, EncryptionKey):
  // Extract values from IV
  ContentType = IV[0:2]
  Watermark = IV[2:10]
  Nonce = IV[10:32]
  Counter = IV[32:64]

  // Regenerate expected watermark
  RegeneratedWatermark = PRNG(MasterKey, ContentID, SampleIndex) 

  // Compare
  if Watermark != RegeneratedWatermark:
    return False // Tampered/Unauthorized
  
  // Decrypt using standard AES-CTR with IV & EncryptionKey
  DecryptedSample = AES_CTR_Decrypt(EncryptedSample, EncryptionKey, IV)
  
  return True // Valid
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The size of the watermark can be adjusted based on desired security and overhead.
*   The PRNG should be cryptographically secure.
*   The master key should be securely managed.
*   SampleIndex would be a variable incremented per-sample during processing, to drive the PRNG.
*   This system allows for tracking of leaked/copied content, as each copy will have a unique watermark.
