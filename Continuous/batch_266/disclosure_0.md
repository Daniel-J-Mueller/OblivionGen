## Dynamic Creative Assembly with Generative AI

**System Overview:** A system for dynamically assembling advertisement creative content *entirely* through generative AI models, moving beyond metadata-driven selection and towards AI-composed visuals and messaging. This goes beyond the described patent's reliance on *selecting* events/metadata; it *creates* the advertisement based on those events.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Event Feature Extractor:**  Similar to the patent's event gathering, this component collects user interaction data (website visits, product views, purchases, etc.). However, instead of simply storing metadata, it transforms this data into a vector embedding representing the user's "interest profile." This profile encapsulates not just *what* the user interacted with, but *how* (dwell time, scrolling behavior, clicks, etc.).

2.  **AI Creative Generator:**  This is the core of the innovation.  A suite of generative AI models (image, text, video) are trained on a massive dataset of advertising assets and marketing copy. This suite accepts the user's interest profile vector as input.  

    *   **Image Generation:**  Models like DALL-E 3 or Stable Diffusion create visuals relevant to the interest profile.  Parameters control style (photorealistic, cartoonish, abstract), composition, and color palette.
    *   **Text Generation:**  Large Language Models (LLMs) generate ad copy (headlines, descriptions, calls to action). The LLM is conditioned on the interest profile to ensure relevance and persuasive messaging. Multiple variations are created and scored (see 'A/B Testing Module').
    *   **Video Generation:** (Optional, but powerful)  If sufficient data exists, models like RunwayML Gen-2 create short video clips based on the interest profile.  These could be product demonstrations, lifestyle visuals, or animated explainers.

3.  **A/B Testing Module:**  The AI Creative Generator produces multiple ad variations. This module automatically launches A/B tests in real-time, showing different variations to different users and tracking performance metrics (CTR, conversion rate). This allows the system to continuously optimize ad creative.

4.  **Bid Adjustment Engine:** The performance data from the A/B Testing Module feeds into a bid adjustment engine. This engine dynamically adjusts bids based on the predicted effectiveness of different ad variations. Higher bids are placed on creatives that are performing well, maximizing ROI.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// User Session Begins
event_extractor = new EventFeatureExtractor()
user_profile = event_extractor.extract_features(user_session_data)

// Creative Generation Loop
while (ad_slot_available) {
    creative_generator = new AICreativeGenerator()
    image = creative_generator.generate_image(user_profile)
    headline = creative_generator.generate_headline(user_profile)
    description = creative_generator.generate_description(user_profile)
    
    ad_creative = combine(image, headline, description)
    
    // A/B Testing
    ad_variation_index = random(0, num_variations)
    selected_ad = ad_variations[ad_variation_index]
    
    // Bid Adjustment
    predicted_ctr = model.predict(selected_ad, user_profile)
    bid_amount = calculate_bid(predicted_ctr)
    
    transmit_bid(bid_amount, selected_ad)
    
    // Track performance
    if (bid_won) {
      track_impression(selected_ad)
      track_click(selected_ad)
      track_conversion(selected_ad)
    }
}
```
