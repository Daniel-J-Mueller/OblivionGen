## Dynamic Skill-Based Item Synthesis - "The Forge"

**Concept:** Extend the existing skill-level customization beyond *descriptions* to dynamically synthesize entirely new item *features* or functionalities based on user skill. Instead of just *telling* a user about an item, *change* the item itself to suit their capabilities.

**Specifications:**

**1. Item Feature Database:**
   *  A database of modular item features, categorized by skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert).
   *  Each feature defined by:
        * Feature ID
        * Skill Level Requirement
        * Functional Code (e.g., a script, API call, configuration change)
        * User Interface elements (if applicable)
        * Dependencies (other features required)
        * Resource Cost (virtual/in-game currency, materials – for implementation in a game/sim)

**2. Skill Level Assessment Module:**
   *  Expanded assessment beyond historical actions. Incorporate *interactive challenges* within the system.
   *  Skill level is a vector (e.g., [Engineering: 7, Tactics: 3, Resource Management: 9]) - representing proficiency across multiple dimensions.
   *  Challenges dynamically adjust difficulty based on real-time performance.
   *  Challenges are context-aware – related to the item category.

**3. Item Synthesis Engine:**
   *  Input: Item base model, User Skill Vector
   *  Process:
        1. Identify applicable features based on the user’s skill vector.
        2. Prioritize features based on:
            *  Skill level match (higher match = higher priority)
            *  Feature synergy (features that work well together)
            *  Resource cost (limit total cost)
        3. Apply selected features to the item base model. This might involve:
            *  Adding new functions/methods to a software object.
            *  Enabling/disabling existing functionalities.
            *  Modifying UI elements.
            *  Changing item statistics (e.g., damage, speed, capacity).
        4.  Generate a customized item instance.

**4. Dynamic UI Adaptation:**
    * UI changes to reflect synthesized features. (Tooltips, help menus, in-game overlays)
    * Adaptive tutorials to guide the user through new features.
    * UI elements that display feature activation conditions (e.g. 'Requires level 5 Engineering to activate Overdrive').

**Pseudocode (Item Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesizeItem(itemBase, userSkillVector):
  applicableFeatures = []
  for feature in featureDatabase:
    if feature.skillLevelRequirement <= userSkillVector[feature.skillCategory]:
      applicableFeatures.append(feature)

  // Sort features by skill level match and synergy
  sortedFeatures = sortFeatures(applicableFeatures, userSkillVector)

  // Apply features based on resource cost
  currentCost = 0
  synthesizedItem = itemBase
  for feature in sortedFeatures:
    if currentCost + feature.resourceCost <= maxResourceCost:
      applyFeature(synthesizedItem, feature)
      currentCost += feature.resourceCost

  return synthesizedItem
```

**Example:**

A user purchasing a "Drone" item.

*   **Beginner:** Drone provides basic reconnaissance.
*   **Intermediate:**  Drone gains cloaking and limited hacking capabilities.
*   **Advanced:** Drone can deploy small defensive turrets and remotely disable enemy systems.
*   **Expert:**  Drone can construct temporary shields, actively hack enemy drones, and broadcast jamming signals.

The system dynamically adjusts the drone's functionality based on the user's assessed skill levels in areas like Engineering, Hacking, and Tactics.
