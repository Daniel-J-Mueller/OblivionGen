## Dynamic Request Data Mutation for Chaos Engineering

**Concept:** Expand the replay system to not just *replay* captured request data, but to *mutate* it in real-time, creating a dynamic chaos engineering system directly integrated with production traffic replay. This allows for testing edge cases and failure scenarios not present in the original production data.

**Specs:**

*   **Mutation Engine:** A modular component inserted between the job queue and the worker nodes.
*   **Mutation Profiles:** Configurable profiles defining the types and probabilities of data mutations. Profiles are associated with test plans. Examples:
    *   **Latency Injection:** Introduce random delays to specific request parameters or entire requests.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Randomly flip bits, introduce errors into numerical data, or corrupt string fields.
    *   **Boundary Value Testing:** Modify input parameters to their minimum, maximum, or invalid values.
    *   **Rate Limiting Simulation:** Artificially reduce the rate of specific request types.
    *   **Dependency Failure Simulation:**  Modify request targets to simulate failures of downstream services.
*   **Mutation Control Plane:** A centralized control plane for managing and deploying mutation profiles.  Allows for A/B testing of different mutation strategies.
*   **Real-time Feedback Loop:**  Monitor production service metrics (error rates, latency, throughput) during mutation testing and dynamically adjust mutation parameters to optimize test coverage and avoid service disruptions.
*   **Data Sanitization Layer:**  A layer within the mutation engine to prevent the injection of malicious or sensitive data during mutation. This is critical for security and compliance.
*   **Request Data Versioning:** Track versions of original captured request data alongside mutations, allowing for rollback or comparison.

**Pseudocode (Mutation Engine):**

```
function mutateRequest(requestData, mutationProfile) {
  mutatedRequest = requestData.clone() // Create a copy to avoid modifying original data

  for each mutation in mutationProfile.mutations {
    if (random() < mutation.probability) {
      switch (mutation.type) {
        case "latency_injection":
          delay = random(mutation.min_delay, mutation.max_delay)
          mutatedRequest.addDelay(delay)
        case "data_corruption":
          field = selectRandomField(mutatedRequest)
          corruptData(field, mutation.corruption_rate)
        case "boundary_value":
          parameter = selectRandomParameter(mutatedRequest)
          setParameterToBoundary(parameter, mutation.boundary_value)
        // ... other mutation types ...
      }
    }
  }
  return mutatedRequest
}

function processJob(job) {
  requestData = job.getRequestData()
  mutatedRequest = mutateRequest(requestData, job.getMutationProfile())
  worker.sendRequest(mutatedRequest)
}
```

**Integration Points:**

*   **Test Plan Definition:**  Mutation profiles are specified within the test plan.
*   **Job Queue:** The job queue passes the associated mutation profile along with the request data to the mutation engine.
*   **Worker Nodes:**  Worker nodes receive mutated request data and replay it to the production service.
*   **Monitoring System:** Production service metrics are monitored to provide feedback for dynamic adjustment of mutation parameters.
