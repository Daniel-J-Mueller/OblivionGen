## Dynamic Authorization Delegation with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the multi-party authorization system to allow for *delegated* authorization, where users can temporarily grant authorization rights to other users, with those rights automatically decaying over time.  This adds a layer of flexibility and responsiveness to update processes, especially in dynamic environments.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `AuthorizationDelegation`:
    *   `delegator_id`: User ID of the user granting delegation.
    *   `delegate_id`: User ID of the user receiving delegation.
    *   `scope`:  String defining the scope of delegation (e.g., specific resource, data type, or function).  Supports wildcards.
    *   `expiration_timestamp`: Unix timestamp indicating when the delegation expires.
    *   `original_request_id`: ID of the original agreement request this delegation applies to.
*   `DelegationStore`: In-memory or persistent store for `AuthorizationDelegation` objects.  Indexed by `delegate_id`, `scope`, and `expiration_timestamp`.

**2. API Extensions:**

*   `DelegateAuthorization(delegator_id, delegate_id, scope, duration)`:  Allows a user to delegate authorization for a specified duration.  `duration` is in seconds. This function calculates `expiration_timestamp` and creates an `AuthorizationDelegation` object, storing it in the `DelegationStore`.
*   `RevokeDelegation(delegator_id, delegate_id, scope)`: Allows a user to explicitly revoke a delegation before its expiration.
*   `EvaluateResponsesWithDelegation(agreement_request, responses)`:  Modified evaluation function. This function checks both the explicitly approved users *and* valid delegations for each user in `responses`.

**3. Pseudocode: `EvaluateResponsesWithDelegation`**

```pseudocode
function EvaluateResponsesWithDelegation(agreement_request, responses):
  required_approvers = GetRequiredApprovers(agreement_request)
  approved_users = []

  for response in responses:
    user_id = response.user_id
    approval_status = response.approval_status

    if approval_status == "approved":
      approved_users.append(user_id)

    else: 
      continue # skip if not approved.

  # Check for Delegated Authority
  for user_id in approved_users:
    #Check for Valid Delegations
    delegations = DelegationStore.GetDelegationsForUser(user_id)

    for delegation in delegations:
      if delegation.expiration_timestamp > CurrentTime() and  
         WildcardMatch(delegation.scope, agreement_request.scope):
        #Delegation Valid, add Delegator to approved users
        approved_users.append(delegation.delegator_id)

  # Check if Enough Approvers
  if Length(approved_users) >= Length(required_approvers):
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**4. Wildcard Matching:**

Implement a flexible wildcard matching function (`WildcardMatch`) for the `scope` attribute. Supports `*` (matches any sequence of characters) and `?` (matches any single character).

**5. Implementation Details:**

*   The `DelegationStore` should be efficiently indexed for fast lookup of delegations by user, scope, and expiration.
*   Consider implementing a background process to periodically prune expired delegations from the `DelegationStore`.
*   Integration with existing notification mechanisms to inform delegators when their delegations are used.
