## Electronic Device - Haptic Projection System

**Concept:** An electronic device incorporating localized haptic feedback *projected* onto the user's skin via focused ultrasound, creating the illusion of texture, shape, and even force without physical contact. This moves beyond simple vibration and allows for complex, dynamic tactile experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Technology:** Phased array ultrasound transducers, miniaturized and integrated into the device housing. Array dimensions: 100mm x 50mm, with a density of 500 transducers per cm².
*   **Power Source:** Integrated solid-state battery – 3.7V, 5000 mAh. Wireless charging capability (Qi standard).
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated co-processor for ultrasound waveform generation and control. Minimum: ARM Cortex-A72 quad-core @ 2.0 GHz. Real-time processing is *critical*.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Capacitive proximity sensors (range: 0-5cm) to detect skin surface.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – 9-axis (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) for device orientation and movement tracking.
    *   Ambient light sensor for dynamic intensity adjustment.
*   **Interface:** Bluetooth 5.2 for connection to host device (smartphone, computer).
*   **Housing Material:** Medical-grade silicone with embedded heat dissipation channels.
*   **Cooling System:** Microfluidic cooling system utilizing a biocompatible fluid.
*   **Software:** SDK for developers to create haptic “textures” and interactions. Includes waveform editor and simulation tools.

**Operation:**

1.  Device is held or positioned near the target skin area.
2.  Proximity sensors detect skin surface.
3.  IMU data determines device orientation and movement.
4.  Host device sends instructions (texture parameters, force feedback) via Bluetooth.
5.  Co-processor generates appropriate ultrasound waveforms.
6.  Phased array transducers focus ultrasound energy onto specific skin locations, creating localized pressure and tactile sensations.
7.  Microfluidic cooling system dissipates heat generated by transducers.

**Pseudocode (Waveform Generation):**

```
function generateHapticWaveform(texture_type, intensity, location_x, location_y):
    // texture_type: "rough", "smooth", "bump", "edge", etc.
    // intensity: 0-100 (percentage)
    // location_x, location_y: coordinates on skin surface

    if texture_type == "rough":
        frequency = 40kHz + random(-5kHz, 5kHz)  // Introduce frequency modulation
        pulse_width = 50us + random(-10us, 10us) // Introduce pulse width modulation
    elif texture_type == "smooth":
        frequency = 30kHz
        pulse_width = 100us
    elif texture_type == "bump":
        frequency = 50kHz
        pulse_width = 25us
    elif texture_type == "edge":
        frequency = 60kHz
        pulse_width = 15us

    amplitude = intensity * 0.1  // Scale amplitude based on intensity

    waveform = generate_sine_wave(frequency, amplitude, pulse_width)
    focused_waveform = focus_ultrasound(waveform, location_x, location_y)

    return focused_waveform
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Gaming: Realistic tactile feedback for in-game events.
*   Virtual/Augmented Reality: Enhance immersion through realistic tactile experiences.
*   Accessibility: Assist visually impaired individuals with navigation and object recognition.
*   Medical: Non-invasive diagnostics and therapeutic applications.
*   Remote Interaction:  "Feel" objects and textures remotely via haptic data transmission.
