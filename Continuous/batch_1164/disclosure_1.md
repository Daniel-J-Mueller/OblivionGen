## Adaptive Lease Granularity for Distributed Consensus

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on a fairly rigid lease model for master node election. This design proposes dynamically adjusting the lease duration based on observed network conditions and workload. Shorter leases react quickly to failures but introduce more overhead. Longer leases reduce overhead but are less responsive. This system balances these tradeoffs *automatically*.

**Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   *Lease Manager:* A dedicated module on each node responsible for lease negotiation, monitoring, and adjustment.
    *   *Network Observer:* Monitors network latency, packet loss, and bandwidth between nodes.
    *   *Workload Analyzer:*  Tracks request rates, transaction sizes, and data access patterns.
    *   *Lease Database:* Stores lease parameters (duration, renewal thresholds) and historical performance data.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `LeaseRecord`:  {`nodeID`, `currentLeaseDuration`, `renewalThreshold`, `lastRenewalTimestamp`, `performanceMetrics` }
    *   `NetworkMetrics`: {`avgLatency`, `packetLossRate`, `bandwidth`}
    *   `WorkloadMetrics`: {`requestRate`, `transactionSize`, `dataAccessPattern`}

*   **Algorithm:**

    1.  **Initial Lease Negotiation:** When a node becomes master, it proposes an initial lease duration based on predefined system defaults.
    2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The Network Observer and Workload Analyzer continuously collect data.
    3.  **Performance Calculation:**  The Lease Manager calculates a performance score based on the NetworkMetrics and WorkloadMetrics.
        *   `PerformanceScore = (NetworkWeight * NetworkScore) + (WorkloadWeight * WorkloadScore)`
        *   `NetworkScore` is inversely proportional to latency and packet loss.
        *   `WorkloadScore` is proportional to request rate and transaction size.
    4.  **Lease Adjustment:**
        *   If `PerformanceScore` exceeds a high threshold: *Reduce* lease duration to prioritize responsiveness.
        *   If `PerformanceScore` falls below a low threshold: *Increase* lease duration to reduce overhead.
        *   Adjustment is incremental to avoid instability.  (e.g., +/- 10% of current duration)
    5.  **Lease Renewal Negotiation:** During lease renewal, the master node broadcasts its adjusted lease duration. Quorum of nodes must acknowledge.
    6. **Adaptive Quorum:**  Dynamically adjusts the required quorum size for lease renewal based on network stability. More stable networks allow for smaller quorums, reducing latency.

*   **Pseudocode (Lease Manager - Core Logic):**

    ```pseudocode
    function adjustLease(currentLeaseDuration):
        networkScore = calculateNetworkScore()
        workloadScore = calculateWorkloadScore()
        performanceScore = (networkWeight * networkScore) + (workloadWeight * workloadScore)

        if performanceScore > highThreshold:
            newLeaseDuration = currentLeaseDuration * 0.9 // Reduce by 10%
        elif performanceScore < lowThreshold:
            newLeaseDuration = currentLeaseDuration * 1.1 // Increase by 10%
        else:
            newLeaseDuration = currentLeaseDuration

        return newLeaseDuration
    ```

*   **Failure Handling:**  If lease negotiation fails (due to network issues or node failures), fall back to a predefined default lease duration.

*   **Considerations:**  Requires careful tuning of weights (`networkWeight`, `workloadWeight`) and thresholds (`highThreshold`, `lowThreshold`) to optimize performance for specific workloads and network environments.
