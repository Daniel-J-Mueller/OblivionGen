## Adaptive Sensory Substitution for Sensitive Data

**Concept:** Expand the system’s sensitivity handling beyond visual/auditory redaction/omission to include *sensory substitution* – converting sensitive data into non-linguistic, non-visual, non-auditory sensory signals. This allows the user to *experience* data is sensitive without directly perceiving its content.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensory Mapping Profiles:** Develop a library of sensory mapping profiles. Each profile defines a mapping between data types and a chosen sensory modality (e.g., haptic vibration patterns, thermal fluctuations, subtle electrotactile stimulation).  These profiles are configurable per-application and/or per-user.  Examples:
    *   Financial data (account numbers, amounts) -> Complex haptic vibration patterns on the wrist. Intensity correlates with amount, pattern with account type.
    *   Personal Identification Information (PII) -> Gradual temperature changes on the forearm. Rate of change indicates sensitivity level.
    *   Medical diagnoses -> Specific sequences of low-frequency sound waves perceived as bone conduction (bypassing typical auditory processing).
    *   Legal case details -> Patterns of localized pressure applied to the back of the hand.
2.  **Sensitivity Engine Integration:** The existing sensitivity detection engine is expanded to classify data *not just* as sensitive or not, but also by a *sensory substitution suitability score*.  This score determines if sensory substitution is a viable option based on data type, user preferences, and available hardware.
3.  **Hardware Abstraction Layer:** A HAL is created to support multiple sensory output devices:
    *   Haptic wristbands/gloves
    *   Thermoelectric pads (for localized temperature control)
    *   Bone conduction transducers
    *   Electrotactile stimulators
4.  **User Configuration Panel:** A user interface allowing the following:
    *   Enable/Disable sensory substitution globally.
    *   Configure preferred sensory modality for different data types.
    *   Adjust intensity/pattern parameters for each modality.
    *   Create custom sensory profiles.
5.  **Data Transformation Module:**  This module receives flagged sensitive data. It applies a transformation algorithm based on the selected sensory profile.  The output is a sequence of control signals for the chosen sensory output device.
6.  **Communication Protocol:** Establish a secure communication protocol between the remote system and the sensory output device. Encryption and authentication are required.
7.  **Example Pseudocode (Data Transformation Module):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION transform_data(data, profile)
  IF profile.modality == "haptic" THEN
    intensity = scale(data.amount, 0, 100) // Scale data to intensity range
    pattern = generate_haptic_pattern(data.type) // Select pattern based on data type (e.g., account number, transaction)
    output = create_haptic_signal(intensity, pattern)
  ELSE IF profile.modality == "thermal" THEN
    rate_of_change = scale(data.sensitivity_level, 0, 10) // Scale sensitivity level to rate of change
    output = create_thermal_signal(rate_of_change)
  ELSE IF profile.modality == "bone_conduction" THEN
    frequency = map_diagnosis_to_frequency(data.diagnosis)
    output = create_bone_conduction_signal(frequency)
  ENDIF
  RETURN output
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply concealing or altering data. It *re-presents* it in a fundamentally different form, allowing the user to receive an indication of the data's presence and potentially its characteristics (e.g., magnitude, urgency) without directly accessing the sensitive information itself. This offers a new dimension of privacy and security.
