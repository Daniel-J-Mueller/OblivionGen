## Adaptive Predictive Stabilization & Rendering Pipeline

**Concept:** Extend depth-based stabilization to *proactively* adjust rendering based on predicted motion, combining stabilization with a dynamic, per-object rendering pipeline. Instead of solely reacting to offsets in subsequent frames, predict motion *during* rendering and pre-warp the image before display.

**Specifications:**

**1. Motion Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Depth map, historical frame data (minimum 3 frames), object segmentation data (foreground/background), accelerometer/gyroscope data from the computing device.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a Kalman filter or similar predictive tracking algorithm. Initial state estimation derived from the accelerometer/gyroscope data.
    *   Track foreground object feature points (corners, edges) across frames using optical flow.  Weight optical flow data based on depth – closer objects receive higher weight.
    *   Predict future object positions (x, y, z) and orientations (roll, pitch, yaw) for the next N frames (N=2-5).
    *   Calculate a 'motion confidence' score for each foreground object based on the consistency of predictions across different algorithms (Kalman filter, optical flow). Low confidence objects trigger a fallback to reactive stabilization.
*   **Output:** Predicted object positions/orientations, motion confidence score.

**2. Pre-Warp Rendering Engine:**

*   **Input:** Current frame data, predicted object positions/orientations, depth map, motion confidence score.
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on predicted motion, apply a geometric transformation (translation, rotation, scale) to the rendered image region corresponding to each foreground object *before* compositing the final frame. This 'pre-warps' the image to counteract anticipated movement.
    *   Implement a dynamic mesh warping algorithm. Apply a local mesh deformation based on the predicted motion. The deformation is localized to the foreground object to minimize distortion of the background.
    *   Employ a ‘rendering budget’ system. Allocate rendering resources based on motion confidence. High confidence objects receive higher-resolution pre-warping.
*   **Output:** Pre-warped frame data.

**3. Adaptive Blending & Reactive Stabilization:**

*   **Input:** Pre-warped frame data, current frame data, motion confidence score.
*   **Process:**
    *   If motion confidence is high (>80%), primarily display the pre-warped frame. Use a feathering/alpha blending technique to smoothly transition between the pre-warped and current frames.
    *   If motion confidence is low, fall back to reactive stabilization (as described in the original patent). Blend the current frame with the reactively stabilized frame.
    *   Implement a ‘dynamic blending weight’ based on the difference between predicted and actual object positions. If there’s a significant discrepancy, increase the weight of the reactively stabilized frame.

**4. Pseudocode – Pre-Warp Rendering:**

```
function preWarpRender(frameData, predictedMotion, depthMap):
  for each object in frameData:
    if object is foreground:
      motionVector = predictedMotion[object]
      depth = depthMap[object]
      // Calculate transformation matrix based on motionVector and depth
      transformationMatrix = calculateTransformationMatrix(motionVector, depth)

      // Apply transformation to object's region in frameData
      warpedObjectRegion = applyTransformation(frameData, transformationMatrix)

      // Replace original object region with warped region in frameData
      frameData = replaceRegion(frameData, warpedObjectRegion)

  return frameData
```

**5. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance CPU/GPU for real-time rendering and processing.
*   Depth sensor (stereo camera, Time-of-Flight sensor, LiDAR).
*   Accelerometer/Gyroscope for motion tracking.
*   Machine learning libraries for motion prediction.
*   Optimized rendering engine for efficient mesh warping and blending.
