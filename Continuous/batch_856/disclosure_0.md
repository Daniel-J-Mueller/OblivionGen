## Adaptive Rotor Cooling System â€“ Specification

**Concept:** Integrate a microfluidic cooling system *within* the rotor itself, leveraging the diameter-altering capability to modulate coolant flow and heat dissipation. This is an extension of the variable-diameter rotor concept, not just for performance adjustment but for thermal management.

**Components:**

*   **Rotor Core:** Constructed from a high-thermal-conductivity material (e.g., copper-aluminum alloy). Internal channels are machined or 3D printed within the rotor core.
*   **Microfluidic Channels:** A network of interconnected microchannels embedded within the rotor core.  Channel dimensions: 0.2-0.5mm diameter.  Channel material: Polymer with high thermal conductivity and chemical resistance.
*   **Coolant:** Dielectric fluid with high specific heat capacity and low viscosity.
*   **Reservoir:** Small, sealed reservoir integrated into the motor base or within the rotor itself. Capacity: 5-10 ml.
*   **Micro-Pump:** Miniature, brushless DC micro-pump positioned within the base, connected to the reservoir and microfluidic channels.  Flow rate adjustable from 0-5 ml/min.
*   **Diameter-Sensing System:** Hall-effect sensors or similar, detecting the rotor diameter. Output feeds into control system.
*   **Control System:** Microcontroller with programmed logic. Inputs: Rotor diameter, motor load, temperature sensors (integrated into stator & rotor). Outputs: Micro-pump speed control, potential heating element control (from original patent).
*   **Sealing:** Robust sealing materials between rotor and stator to prevent coolant leakage.

**Operation:**

1.  **Baseline:** At lower loads or speeds, the rotor maintains a smaller diameter (as per original patent concept). Coolant flow is minimal.
2.  **Load Increase/High Speed:** As load increases or speed rises, the rotor expands, increasing the channel volume within the rotor.
3.  **Control Loop:** The diameter-sensing system detects the expansion. The control system increases the micro-pump speed, pushing more coolant through the expanded channels.
4.  **Thermal Management:**  The increased coolant flow removes heat generated within the rotor, preventing overheating and maintaining optimal performance.
5.  **Adaptive Flow:** The control system adjusts the coolant flow rate *dynamically*, based on rotor diameter, motor load, and temperature readings. This ensures efficient cooling at all operating conditions.
6.  **Diameter & Flow Correlation:** The control system applies a lookup table or equation mapping rotor diameter to optimal coolant flow rate.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Variables
rotorDiameter = 0.0 // measured diameter in mm
motorLoad = 0.0 // measured motor load (arbitrary units)
statorTemp = 0.0 // Temperature sensor reading
rotorTemp = 0.0 // Temperature sensor reading
pumpSpeed = 0.0

// Lookup table or equation for optimal pump speed based on diameter and load
function calculatePumpSpeed(diameter, load):
  if diameter < 20 and load < 0.5:
    return 10 // Minimal flow
  else if diameter < 20 and load >= 0.5:
    return 20
  else if diameter >= 20:
    pumpSpeed = (diameter / 5) + (load * 10)  // Example calculation
    return pumpSpeed

// Main loop
while (true):
  rotorDiameter = readDiameterSensor()
  motorLoad = readLoadSensor()
  statorTemp = readStatorTempSensor()
  rotorTemp = readRotorTempSensor()

  pumpSpeed = calculatePumpSpeed(rotorDiameter, motorLoad)
  setPumpSpeed(pumpSpeed)

  // Safety check
  if (rotorTemp > 80):
    setPumpSpeed(100) // Max pump speed
  end if
end while
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced thermal management, allowing for higher sustained power output.
*   Increased motor lifespan by reducing heat stress.
*   Potential for silent operation (liquid cooling).
*   Synergistic integration with the variable-diameter rotor concept for optimized performance and thermal control.
