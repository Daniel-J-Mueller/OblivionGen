## Adaptive Device Naming & Contextual Awareness System

**Concept:** Expand on the device identification and naming functionality (Claim 5 & 15) by creating a system that doesn’t just *name* devices based on location or type, but actively adapts the naming *and* functionality based on observed user behavior and environmental context. This goes beyond simple ‘Living Room Lamp’ to something like ‘Reading Lamp - Warm’ or ‘Security Camera - Front Yard - Motion Detected’.

**System Components:**

*   **Contextual Sensor Suite:** Beyond basic location data, incorporate sensors for:
    *   Ambient light levels
    *   Temperature
    *   Sound (voice, music, general noise)
    *   Motion (beyond simple presence detection - tracking speed/direction)
    *   User proximity (using BLE beacons or UWB)
*   **Behavioral Analysis Engine:** A machine learning model that learns user preferences and routines. This engine tracks:
    *   Device usage patterns (time of day, duration, frequency)
    *   User interaction with devices (voice commands, app control)
    *   Correlation between environmental factors and device usage.
*   **Dynamic Naming Module:** This module generates and updates device names based on input from the Behavioral Analysis Engine and Contextual Sensor Suite. 
*   **Adaptive Functionality Module:**  This module adjusts device settings (brightness, temperature, sensitivity) *proactively* based on learned behavior and environmental context.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Functionality Module):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustDeviceSettings(deviceId, contextData, behaviorData):
  // contextData:  {lightLevel: 200 lux, temperature: 22C, soundLevel: 60dB}
  // behaviorData: {preferredBrightness: 70%, preferredColorTemp: Warm, motionSensitivity: High}

  IF deviceType == "Lamp":
    brightness = behaviorData.preferredBrightness + (contextData.lightLevel * 0.01) // Adjust brightness based on ambient light
    colorTemp = behaviorData.preferredColorTemp // Use preferred color temperature
    IF contextData.soundLevel > 70dB:
       colorTemp = Cool // Switch to cooler temperature for increased focus
  ELSE IF deviceType == "SecurityCamera":
    motionSensitivity = behaviorData.motionSensitivity
    IF timeOfDay == "Night" AND motionDetected == TRUE:
       startRecording()
       sendNotification("Motion detected - Front Yard")
  ELSE
      //Default settings
      brightness = 50%
      motionSensitivity = Medium

  //Apply settings to device
  setDeviceSettings(deviceId, brightness, colorTemp, motionSensitivity)
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **DeviceProfile:**
    *   deviceId (unique identifier)
    *   deviceType (Lamp, Camera, Thermostat, etc.)
    *   location (x, y coordinates)
    *   preferredSettings (brightness, temperature, sensitivity, colorTemp, etc.)
    *   usageHistory (timestamped logs of device usage)
*   **ContextData:**
    *   timestamp
    *   lightLevel (lux)
    *   temperature (Celsius)
    *   soundLevel (dB)
    *   motionDetected (boolean)
    *   userProximity (meters)

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Privacy considerations are paramount.  User data should be anonymized and stored securely.
*   The system should be configurable to allow users to override automated settings.
*   Machine learning models should be regularly updated with new data to improve accuracy.
*   Edge computing could be used to process sensor data locally, reducing latency and improving privacy.
