## Dynamic Packet Provenance & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the packet processing cluster’s capabilities beyond simple rule-based processing by introducing a dynamic packet provenance and trust scoring system. Instead of just *processing* packets, the cluster *assesses* them, building a history and trust score that informs downstream actions, even beyond the initial ruleset.

**Specs:**

1.  **Provenance Data Store:**
    *   A distributed, immutable ledger (blockchain-inspired, but doesn’t *need* to be a full blockchain) accessible to all compute instances within the packet processing cluster.
    *   Data Structure:  Each packet (or a representative hash) is associated with a provenance record.
    *   Provenance Record Fields:
        *   `timestamp`:  When the packet was first observed.
        *   `source_interface`: Interface where the packet was initially received.
        *   `initial_trust_score`: Baseline trust score (configurable).
        *   `processing_node_history`: List of compute instances that have processed the packet, with timestamps.
        *   `rule_matches`:  List of rules that matched the packet on each processing node.
        *   `modification_history`: Any modifications made to the packet (e.g., NAT, encryption) and the node performing the modification.
        *   `anomaly_flags`: Flags raised by anomaly detection modules (see below).
        *   `external_threat_intelligence_matches`: Matches against external threat feeds.

2.  **Anomaly Detection Modules:**
    *   Each compute instance runs one or more configurable anomaly detection modules.
    *   Modules analyze packet content, headers, and behavior (e.g., packet size, frequency, destination).
    *   Anomaly detection can be signature-based, behavioral, or statistical.
    *   Upon detection of an anomaly, the module updates the `anomaly_flags` field in the provenance record.

3.  **Trust Scoring Engine:**
    *   A central engine (or a distributed consensus mechanism) that calculates a trust score for each packet based on its provenance record.
    *   Trust Score Calculation Factors:
        *   Age of the packet (older packets may have lower trust).
        *   Number of processing nodes visited (more nodes may indicate increased scrutiny).
        *   Rule matches (matching known malicious patterns reduces trust).
        *   Anomaly flags (raise significant concerns).
        *   External threat intelligence matches (major reductions in trust).
    *   The Trust Scoring Engine should be configurable to prioritize different factors.

4.  **Dynamic Rule Enforcement:**
    *   Downstream processing (firewall, NAT, etc.) should be informed by the packet’s trust score.
    *   Rules can be dynamically adjusted based on the trust score.  For example:
        *   Packets with high trust scores are processed with minimal inspection.
        *   Packets with low trust scores are subjected to deep packet inspection and potentially blocked.
        *   Trusted sources can bypass certain security checks.

5.  **API Integration:**
    *   An API allows external systems to query the provenance and trust score of packets.
    *   This enables integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems, threat intelligence platforms, and other security tools.

**Pseudocode (Trust Scoring Engine):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(provenanceRecord):
  trustScore = 100  // Base score

  // Age Penalty (example)
  if (currentTime - provenanceRecord.timestamp > 3600):
    trustScore -= 5

  // Rule Match Penalty
  for ruleMatch in provenanceRecord.ruleMatches:
    if ruleMatch.severity == "critical":
      trustScore -= 50
    elif ruleMatch.severity == "high":
      trustScore -= 20

  // Anomaly Penalty
  if provenanceRecord.anomalyFlags.contains("malformed_packet"):
    trustScore -= 30

  // Threat Intel Penalty
  if provenanceRecord.externalThreatIntelligenceMatches:
    trustScore = 0

  return max(0, min(100, trustScore)) // Ensure score is within 0-100 range
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security through dynamic rule enforcement.
*   Improved threat detection and response.
*   Reduced false positives.
*   Greater visibility into network traffic.
*   More informed security decisions.
