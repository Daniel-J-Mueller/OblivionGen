## Dynamic Application Behavior Profiling & Predictive Mitigation

**Concept:** Expand the runtime security evaluation beyond *what* code is loaded, to *how* the application intends to *use* that code. Predict potential malicious behavior based on observed API call sequences *before* execution of the dynamically loaded code, and proactively mitigate risk through selective function hooking or sandboxing adjustments.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Behavior Profiler (BP) - integrated into the existing security verification service.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Application API Call Traces: Real-time monitoring of API calls made *before* dynamically loaded code is fully executed. Focus on calls related to memory manipulation, network access, and inter-process communication.
    *   Behavioral Database (BD): A continuously updated database containing known good and malicious API call sequences correlated with dynamically loaded code origins. Includes weighted risk scores for each sequence.
    *   Dynamic Code Analysis Module (DCAM): Performs lightweight static analysis on the *entry point* of the dynamically loaded code to identify potential sensitive functions (e.g., crypto routines, system calls).

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  **API Call Interception:** The BP intercepts all API calls made by the application *after* the decision to load dynamic code but *before* the codeâ€™s main execution loop.
    2.  **Sequence Generation:** The intercepted API calls are assembled into sequences. Sequence length configurable (e.g., 3-5 calls).
    3.  **Risk Scoring:**  
        *   The sequence is compared against the BD using a fuzzy matching algorithm.
        *   A risk score is generated based on:
            *   Sequence match strength.
            *   Risk score associated with matching sequences in the BD.
            *   DCAM results: presence of sensitive functions increases risk.
            *   Source reputation of the dynamically loaded code.
    4.  **Proactive Mitigation:** Based on the risk score:
        *   **Low Risk:** Allow normal execution.
        *   **Medium Risk:**  
            *   **Selective Function Hooking:**  Intercept specific API calls identified as potentially dangerous within the dynamically loaded code (e.g., network send, file write).  Log calls, modify parameters, or block entirely.
            *   **Sandboxing Adjustment:** Increase isolation level of the sandboxed environment (e.g., restrict network access, limit file system access).
        *   **High Risk:**  
            *   **Code Quarantine:** Prevent execution of the dynamically loaded code.
            *   **Alerting:** Notify the application marketplace and/or user about potential security threat.

*   **Pseudocode (Risk Scoring):**

    ```
    function calculate_risk_score(api_call_sequence, code_source, dcam_results):
        sequence_match_score = fuzzy_match(api_call_sequence, behavioral_database)
        source_risk_score = get_code_source_risk(code_source)
        dcam_risk_score = calculate_dcam_risk(dcam_results)

        risk_score = (sequence_match_score * 0.5) + (source_risk_score * 0.25) + (dcam_risk_score * 0.25)

        return risk_score
    ```

*   **Data Structures:**

    *   `API_CALL_SEQUENCE`: List of API call names and parameters.
    *   `BEHAVIORAL_DATABASE_ENTRY`: {`sequence`: `API_CALL_SEQUENCE`, `risk_score`: float, `confidence`: float}
    *   `DCAM_RESULTS`: List of sensitive functions identified by the Dynamic Code Analysis Module.

*   **Integration Points:**

    *   Integrate with the existing security verification service.
    *   Expose API for application marketplaces to submit new behavioral data for the BD.
    *   Provide reporting interface for security analysts to review risk scores and mitigation actions.
