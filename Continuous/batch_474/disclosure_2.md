## Dynamic Proximity-Based Role Assignment System

**Concept:** Expand upon the proximity detection and grouping to implement dynamic role assignment within a facility based on detected user interactions and location. This creates a system where access permissions, task assignments, and even automated guidance change *in real-time* based on who is near whom.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing portal sensors (as per the provided patent) – refined for higher precision location tracking (cm-level).
    *   Wearable devices for all users – small, low-power Bluetooth/UWB beacons integrated into ID badges or wristbands.  These beacons transmit unique identifiers and minimal status data (e.g., 'available', 'busy', 'requires assistance').
    *   Localized Edge Computing Nodes: Distributed throughout the facility to process sensor data and manage role assignments.
    *   Digital Signage/AR Overlays: Displays updated task assignments, guidance, or relevant information to users based on assigned roles.

*   **Software/Logic:**

    1.  **Role Database:** A central database defining various roles within the facility (e.g., ‘Security Responder’, ‘Maintenance Technician’, ‘Guide’, ‘First Aid Provider’). Each role has associated permissions, required skills, and default task assignments.
    2.  **Proximity Graph Construction:** Edge computing nodes continuously build a dynamic graph representing user proximity.  Nodes are users, and edges represent real-time proximity based on beacon signals and sensor data. Edge weights reflect distance.
    3.  **Event Detection & Role Triggering:**  Algorithms analyze the proximity graph for specific events. Examples:
        *   **“Distress Signal”:** If a user broadcasts a distress signal (via wearable button or automated analysis of movement patterns) and another user is within a defined proximity, the system *temporarily* assigns the role of “First Aid Provider” to the nearby user, triggering AR guidance to the distressed individual’s location.
        *   **“Escort Request”:** A user requests an escort to a specific location. The system identifies the nearest available user with “Guide” permissions and temporarily assigns them the escort task.
        *   **“Equipment Failure”:** Sensor data detects equipment malfunction. The system identifies the nearest available user with “Maintenance Technician” skills and temporarily assigns a repair task.
    4.  **Dynamic Permission Adjustment:** Based on temporary role assignments, user access permissions are dynamically adjusted. A “Security Responder” assigned to an incident gains temporary access to restricted areas needed for response.
    5.  **Confidence Scoring:** A confidence score is assigned to each role assignment based on proximity, skill set, and task criticality. This score influences the system’s decision-making and allows for graceful fallback scenarios (e.g., if a primary responder is unavailable, a secondary responder with lower confidence is assigned).
    6.  **Conflict Resolution:** An algorithm handles conflicting role assignments (e.g., multiple users being assigned to the same task). Priority rules, skill set matching, and distance are used to resolve conflicts.

*   **Pseudocode (Role Assignment Logic):**

```
function assign_role(user, event, proximity_graph):
  // Find potential role candidates within proximity_graph
  candidates = find_candidates(user, event, proximity_graph)

  // Score candidates based on skills, distance, and confidence
  scored_candidates = score_candidates(candidates, event)

  // Select the highest-scoring candidate
  best_candidate = select_best_candidate(scored_candidates)

  if best_candidate:
    // Assign role to best_candidate
    assign_temporary_role(best_candidate, event)
    // Adjust permissions accordingly
    adjust_permissions(best_candidate, event)
    return best_candidate
  else:
    // No suitable candidate found
    // Initiate alert or fallback procedure
    return null
```

*   **Data Storage:**
    *   User Profiles: Skill sets, permissions, current role assignments.
    *   Facility Map: Digital representation of the facility layout.
    *   Event Logs: History of events and role assignments for analysis and optimization.



This system moves beyond simple user grouping to create a responsive, adaptive facility environment where users are dynamically empowered to address real-time needs. It facilitates faster response times to emergencies, improves operational efficiency, and enhances the overall user experience.
