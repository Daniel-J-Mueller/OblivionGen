## Adaptive Lock Core with Biometric & Environmental Response

**Concept:** A lock core that doesnâ€™t just respond to key manipulation or tampering, but *learns* and adapts its security profile based on user biometrics, environmental conditions, and usage patterns. This moves beyond simple mechanical lockout to a dynamic security system.

**Core Components:**

*   **Biometric Scanner:** Integrated into the keyway or cylinder housing. Supports multiple biometric inputs (fingerprint, vein pattern, thermal signature) for user identification.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Miniature sensors detect temperature, humidity, vibration, and atmospheric pressure.
*   **Microcontroller/FPGA:** Processes sensor data, biometric input, and controls internal security mechanisms.
*   **Adaptive Pin Field:** Replace traditional tumbler pins with individually controllable micro-pins. These pins can be raised/lowered/rotated via micro-actuators, creating a dynamically changing keyway profile.
*   **Electromagnetic Clutch:** Controls the rotation of the plug. Can be engaged/disengaged electronically.
*   **Tamper Detection Array:** An array of micro-switches and strain gauges integrated into the lock body to detect physical attacks.
*   **Secure Communication Module:** Enables remote monitoring, configuration, and software updates.

**Operational Logic:**

1.  **User Enrollment:** The system captures and stores biometric data for authorized users.
2.  **Authentication:** Upon key insertion, the biometric scanner authenticates the user.
3.  **Environmental Assessment:** Environmental sensors gather data.
4.  **Adaptive Keyway Profile Generation:** The microcontroller generates a unique keyway profile based on user ID, environmental conditions, and usage history. This profile adjusts the position of the micro-pins.
5.  **Rotation Enablement:** If the key matches the generated profile *and* no tampering is detected, the electromagnetic clutch is disengaged, allowing the plug to rotate.
6.  **Learning & Adaptation:** The system continuously learns user habits (time of day, location, typical manipulation force) and environmental patterns to refine the keyway profile.
7.  **Security Escalation:**  If tampering is detected or unusual activity is observed (e.g., forced entry attempt), the system can:
    *   Activate the electromagnetic clutch, locking the plug.
    *   Send an alert to a remote monitoring system.
    *   Temporarily modify the keyway profile to further resist manipulation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
enroll_user(user_id, biometric_data)
store_user_data(user_id, biometric_data)

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    key_inserted = detect_key_insertion()
    if (key_inserted) {
        user_id = authenticate_user(biometric_data)
        if (user_id != null) {
            environmental_data = read_environmental_sensors()
            keyway_profile = generate_keyway_profile(user_id, environmental_data)
            set_micro_pin_positions(keyway_profile)

            tamper_detected = detect_tamper()
            if (tamper_detected) {
                activate_lockout()
                send_alert()
                modify_keyway_profile() // increase resistance
            } else {
                enable_rotation()
            }
        } else {
            //invalid user
            disable_rotation()
        }
    }
}

function generate_keyway_profile(user_id, environmental_data){
   //complex profile generation based on history, environment, user
   return profile
}
```
