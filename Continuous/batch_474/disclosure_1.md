## Dynamic Texture Cover - "Chameleon Case"

**Concept:** A phone case incorporating microfluidic channels and electrochromic materials to allow the user to dynamically change the texture *and* visual appearance of the case surface.

**Specs:**

*   **Material:** TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) base layer for flexibility and impact absorption. Embedded within the TPU, a network of microfluidic channels (channel width: 0.2-0.5mm, channel depth: 0.1-0.3mm) fabricated via micromolding.
*   **Microfluidic Fluid:** Non-conductive, biocompatible fluid (e.g., silicone oil) tinted with various color pigments. Multiple reservoirs integrated into the case design for different color/texture combinations.
*   **Texture Generation:** Integrated micro-actuators (piezoelectric or micro-pumps) control fluid flow within the microfluidic channels. Varying the fluid distribution creates raised or lowered patterns on the case surface, changing the texture (e.g., smooth, ribbed, bumpy, patterned).
*   **Visual Appearance:**  Electrochromic layer applied *above* the microfluidic channel network, sandwiched between a transparent protective layer (polycarbonate) and the microfluidics.  Applying a voltage to the electrochromic layer changes its opacity and color, creating dynamic visual effects that complement the texture.
*   **Control System:** Bluetooth connection to a mobile app. App allows the user to:
    *   Select pre-defined texture/color combinations.
    *   Customize texture patterns via a simple editor (drag-and-drop interface).
    *   Set dynamic themes (e.g., case changes color/texture based on music, notifications, or ambient lighting).
    *   Control refresh rate of texture/color changes.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable battery integrated into the case (wireless charging compatible). Battery life: Minimum 8 hours of continuous dynamic use, 24 hours of standby.
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Optional: Haptic feedback sensors integrated into the case surface to provide tactile feedback based on the displayed texture/visuals.
*   **Manufacturing:**  Two-part molding process. TPU base layer molded with integrated microfluidic channels. Electrochromic layer and protective layer applied via lamination. Micro-actuators and battery/control circuitry integrated and sealed within the case.

**Pseudocode (App Control Logic):**

```
FUNCTION updateCaseDisplay(texturePattern, colorScheme, refreshRate):
  // texturePattern:  2D array representing texture map (0-1 intensity)
  // colorScheme: RGB values for desired color
  // refreshRate:  Updates per second

  // Calculate fluid flow rates for each microfluidic channel based on texturePattern
  channelFlowRates = calculateFlowRates(texturePattern)

  // Activate micro-actuators to achieve desired fluid flow rates
  activateActuators(channelFlowRates)

  // Set voltage to electrochromic layer to achieve desired color
  setElectrochromicColor(colorScheme)

  // Loop: Repeat above steps at specified refreshRate
  WHILE (case is active):
    delay(1000 / refreshRate)
    // Handle user input for changing texture/color
    IF (user input detected):
       updateCaseDisplay(newTexturePattern, newColorScheme, newRefreshRate)
END
