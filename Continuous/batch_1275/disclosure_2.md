## Dynamic Contextual Persona Generation for Speech Recognition

**Concept:** Leverage user interaction data – beyond simple digital work context – to construct a dynamic “persona” profile influencing speech recognition. This goes beyond adapting to *what* is being read/viewed, and attempts to model *how* the user speaks *while* interacting with it.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Streaming data from user devices including:
    *   Utterances (speech input)
    *   Interaction type (scrolling, tapping, highlighting, annotation creation, search queries *within* the digital work)
    *   Timestamp data for all interactions.
    *   Device sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope - to infer user activity - stationary, walking, driving, etc.).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Segment utterances corresponding to specific interaction events.  Example: Utterance uttered immediately after a highlight is marked.
    *   Extract acoustic features (MFCCs, pitch, energy) from utterances.
    *   Categorize interaction type (Highlight, Annotation, Search, Scroll Speed, Dwell Time on element).
    *   Correlate acoustic features with interaction types.

**2. Persona Profile Construction Module:**

*   **Data Structure:** Persona profile represented as a probabilistic model (e.g., Bayesian Network or Hidden Markov Model).
    *   **Nodes:** Represent acoustic features (e.g., speech rate, pitch range, vocal effort), interaction types, and contextual features (e.g., subject matter category of digital work, time of day).
    *   **Edges:** Represent conditional dependencies between nodes. For example: "High scroll speed increases probability of faster speech rate." "Annotation creation increases the likelihood of detailed/precise articulation".
*   **Learning:** Continuously update the probabilistic model based on incoming data using online learning techniques (e.g., Kalman Filtering, Expectation-Maximization).
*   **Persona Vectors:** Output a "persona vector" representing the current user state. This vector encapsulates the learned preferences and tendencies related to speech patterns.

**3. Speech Recognition Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Captured utterance, base language model, language model difference information (as per the provided patent). Persona Vector.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Weighted Model Blending:** Combine the base language model, language model difference information, *and* the persona vector into a single, unified acoustic model.  The weights assigned to each component are dynamically adjusted based on the strength of the persona signal (e.g., high confidence in persona vector = higher weight).  Pseudocode:

        ```
        final_acoustic_model = (weight_base * base_acoustic_model) +
                               (weight_context * context_acoustic_model) +
                               (weight_persona * persona_acoustic_model)
        ```

    *   **Feature Space Transformation:** Use the persona vector to transform the input acoustic features. For example, if the persona profile indicates a tendency for reduced vowel articulation, the system could amplify certain frequency bands in the speech signal to compensate.
    *   **Beam Search Optimization:** Incorporate the persona vector into the beam search algorithm used for speech recognition. The persona vector could be used to prioritize hypotheses that align with the user's predicted speech patterns.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Distributed Processing:**  Persona profile construction and maintenance performed on the user device or edge server. Speech recognition performed on a central server or cloud.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Secure communication channel to transmit persona vectors and speech data.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Anonymize persona data to protect user privacy.  Allow users to control data collection and usage.
