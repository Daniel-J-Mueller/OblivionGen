## Creative Work “Mood” Matching for Service Provider Selection

**Concept:** Expand the service provider recommendation system to incorporate emotional “mood” analysis of creative works, and match those moods to service provider “styles” or specialties. This goes beyond genre and keyword analysis to understand the *feeling* a creative work evokes, allowing for a more nuanced and satisfying match between creator and service provider.

**Specifications:**

**1. Mood Analysis Module:**

   *   **Input:** Creative work text (or other media - image/audio descriptors).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Utilize a pre-trained sentiment analysis model *and* an “emotion detection” model (e.g., Ekman’s six basic emotions – happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust).
        *   Combine sentiment scores (positive/negative) with emotion intensity levels to create a “mood vector.”  This vector represents the emotional landscape of the work.
        *   Employ a “subjectivity” score to determine how heavily the mood vector influences the recommendation. Highly factual or technical works would have a lower subjectivity weight.
   *   **Output:** A mood vector representing the emotional profile of the creative work.

**2. Service Provider “Style” Profiling:**

   *   **Data Collection:** Gather data about service providers based on:
        *   Samples of their previous work.
        *   Client feedback (analyze text for emotional language).
        *   Self-described “style” or “approach” (free-text input, processed with NLP).
   *   **Style Vector Creation:**  Generate a “style vector” for each service provider, mirroring the format of the mood vector. This vector represents the emotional tone *of their work*.
   *   **Style Tagging:** Allow service providers to manually tag their work with emotional descriptors (e.g., “whimsical,” “serious,” “dark,” “optimistic”). This provides supplemental data for the style vector.

**3. Matching Algorithm:**

   *   **Similarity Calculation:** Utilize a distance metric (e.g., cosine similarity) to compare the mood vector of the creative work to the style vectors of potential service providers.
   *   **Weighted Scoring:** Combine the mood similarity score with existing factors (genre, keyword match, historical data, location).  Adjust weights based on the subjectivity score of the creative work.
   *   **Recommendation Ranking:** Rank service providers based on the combined score. Present the top-ranked providers to the user.

**4. User Feedback Loop:**

   *   **Post-Service Rating:** After a service is completed, ask the user to rate not only the quality of the work but also how well the service provider’s “style” matched their creative vision.
   *   **Data Refinement:** Use the feedback to refine the mood analysis models, style vector creation process, and weighting algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Matching Algorithm):**

```
function recommendServiceProvider(creativeWork, serviceProviders) {

  moodVector = analyzeMood(creativeWork)
  subjectivity = calculateSubjectivity(creativeWork)

  for each serviceProvider in serviceProviders {
    styleVector = getStyleVector(serviceProvider)
    moodSimilarity = cosineSimilarity(moodVector, styleVector)
    genreMatch = calculateGenreMatch(creativeWork, serviceProvider)
    keywordMatch = calculateKeywordMatch(creativeWork, serviceProvider)
    historicalScore = getHistoricalScore(creativeWork, serviceProvider)

    // Weighted Scoring
    moodWeight = subjectivity * 0.4
    genreWeight = 0.2
    keywordWeight = 0.1
    historicalWeight = 0.3

    combinedScore = (moodWeight * moodSimilarity) + (genreWeight * genreMatch) + (keywordWeight * keywordMatch) + (historicalWeight * historicalScore)

    serviceProvider.score = combinedScore
  }

  // Sort service providers by score (descending)
  sortedServiceProviders = sort(serviceProviders, descending by score)

  return sortedServiceProviders
}
```

**Potential Expansion:** Allow users to *specify* a desired emotional tone for the service (e.g., “I want an illustrator who can capture a sense of melancholy”). This user-defined preference would be incorporated into the mood vector and matching process.
