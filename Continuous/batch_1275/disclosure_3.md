## Automated Issue ‘Genealogy’ & Predictive Branching

**Concept:** Extend the version control graph concept to create a dynamic ‘issue genealogy’ system. This goes beyond simply linking resolved issues to new ones based on similarity. It predicts *potential* issues in different branches of development based on the historical resolution patterns observed in the graph.

**Specs:**

1.  **Issue Node Creation:** Every issue (bug, feature request, task) is represented as a node.  Nodes store metadata: description, severity, affected files, developer assignments, resolution details (commits, tests), and timestamps (creation, resolution).

2.  **Commit-Issue Linking:**  Automated linking between commits and issues is crucial. If a commit message references an issue ID (e.g., "Fixes bug #123"), the link is established.  AI-powered analysis of commit messages and code changes can identify implicit links.

3.  **Historical Resolution Pattern Database:** Build a database capturing how issues are *typically* resolved. This includes:
    *   **File-Issue Correlation:** Which files are most frequently associated with specific issue types?
    *   **Developer Expertise:** Which developers consistently resolve particular types of issues?
    *   **Resolution Time:**  Average time to resolve issues of a given severity/type.
    *   **Code Change Signatures:**  What kinds of code changes (patterns, complexity) are most effective at resolving certain issues?

4.  **Branch Prediction Engine:** This is the core innovation.
    *   **Branch Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor all active branches of the software component.
    *   **Change Delta Analysis:**  Compare changes in the current branch to the main branch (or other designated baselines).
    *   **Risk Scoring:**  Assign a "risk score" to each change based on the Historical Resolution Pattern Database.  Changes that introduce code similar to previously problematic areas receive higher scores.
    *   **Predictive Issue Generation:**  Based on the risk score, *automatically generate* "preemptive issues" in the issue tracking system *before* they are reported by QA or users. These issues include a predicted severity, affected files, and a list of developers with relevant expertise.

5.  **Genealogical Visualization:** A user interface displaying the ‘issue genealogy’. Users can trace the history of an issue, identify related issues, and explore the connections between branches.  The interface should highlight predicted issues and potential risks.  Interactive exploration of the graph.

**Pseudocode (Branch Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_issues(branch_changes) {
  risk_profile = {}
  for each change in branch_changes {
    affected_files = get_affected_files(change)
    for each file in affected_files {
      historical_data = get_historical_data(file)
      risk_score = calculate_risk_score(historical_data)
      risk_profile[file] = risk_score
    }
  }

  predicted_issues = []
  for each file, score in risk_profile {
    if score > threshold {
      issue = create_predicted_issue(file, score)
      predicted_issues.add(issue)
    }
  }
  return predicted_issues
}

function calculate_risk_score(historical_data) {
  // Combine data from historical data: frequency of issues in this file,
  // average resolution time, severity of past issues, etc.
  // Use a weighted scoring system.
  score = 0
  score += historical_data.issue_frequency * weight_frequency
  score += historical_data.avg_resolution_time * weight_time
  score += historical_data.avg_severity * weight_severity
  return score
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Proactive bug prevention.
*   Reduced QA costs.
*   Faster resolution times.
*   Improved code quality.
*   Better resource allocation.
*   Automated knowledge transfer between teams.
