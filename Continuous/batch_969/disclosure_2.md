## Dynamic Rule Set Orchestration via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Concept:** Extend the rule set application beyond centralized control by leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and a distributed ledger (blockchain or similar) for rule set management. This creates a system where multiple entities can contribute to, verify, and enforce supplemental content rules, fostering a more transparent and robust ecosystem.

**Specs:**

1.  **Rule Set as Verifiable Credentials:** Each rule set is packaged as a Verifiable Credential (VC) cryptographically signed by the rule set author (e.g., a content publisher, an ad network, a security firm). The VC includes:
    *   `subject`: A DID representing the rule set author.
    *   `predicate`:  Identifies the type of rule set (e.g., “ad safety rules”, “content moderation rules”).
    *   `object`: The actual rule set data (JSON, YAML, or other structured format).
    *   `revocation status`:  Flag indicating if the rule set is currently valid.

2.  **DID Resolver Integration:**  Client devices (browsers, apps) integrate a DID resolver to locate and verify the authenticity of rule set authors.

3.  **Distributed Ledger for Rule Set Discovery & Revocation:** A distributed ledger (DLT) stores:
    *   **Rule Set Hashes:**  The cryptographic hash of each rule set VC is registered on the DLT, creating a tamper-proof record of its existence.
    *   **Revocation Lists:**  When a rule set is revoked, its hash is added to a revocation list on the DLT.
    *   **DID Ownership Records**: Maintains a public record of DID ownership, allowing for verification of the rule set creator.

4.  **Client-Side Enforcement Engine:**  The client device maintains an enforcement engine that operates as follows:
    *   **Request Rule Set:** Upon receiving primary content with supplemental content indicators, the engine queries the DLT for the latest rule set hash associated with the supplemental content source (identified via URL, domain, or other identifier).
    *   **Retrieve & Verify VC:** The engine uses the DID resolver to locate the DID of the rule set author and retrieves the VC using the hash found on the DLT.
    *   **Signature Validation:** The engine validates the signature on the VC to ensure authenticity and integrity.
    *   **Rule Application:** If the VC is valid, the engine applies the rules to the supplemental content.
    *   **Revocation Check:**  Before applying the rules, the engine checks the DLT for the rule set hash on the revocation list. If found, the supplemental content is blocked or handled according to predefined fallback rules.

5.  **Dynamic Rule Set Updates:** Rule set authors can update their rules by creating a new VC, registering its hash on the DLT, and optionally marking the previous VC as revoked. Client devices automatically fetch the latest valid rule set.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Enforcement Engine):**

```
function enforceSupplementalContentRules(supplementalContentURL) {
  ruleSetHash = getRuleSetHashFromDLT(supplementalContentURL);

  if (ruleSetHash == null) {
    // No rule set found, apply default/safe settings
    handleSupplementalContent(defaultRules);
    return;
  }

  ruleSetVC = fetchRuleSetVC(ruleSetHash);

  if (ruleSetVC == null) {
    // Rule set not found, apply default settings
    handleSupplementalContent(defaultRules);
    return;
  }

  if (isRuleSetRevoked(ruleSetHash)) {
    // Rule set revoked, apply default settings
    handleSupplementalContent(defaultRules);
    return;
  }

  if (verifySignature(ruleSetVC)) {
    rules = extractRules(ruleSetVC);
    handleSupplementalContent(rules);
  } else {
    // Signature invalid, apply default settings
    handleSupplementalContent(defaultRules);
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Transparency:**  Publicly verifiable rule sets promote accountability.
*   **Decentralized Control:**  Multiple entities can contribute to and enforce rules.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Cryptographic signatures and tamper-proof ledger reduce the risk of malicious rule manipulation.
*   **Improved Scalability:**  Distributed architecture reduces reliance on central servers.
*   **Interoperability:**  Standardized VC format enables seamless integration across different platforms.
