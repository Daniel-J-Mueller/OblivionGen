## Dynamic Service Mesh Prioritization with Predictive Failure Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the importance ranking system to operate within a dynamic service mesh, coupled with a predictive failure modeling system. This allows for proactive adjustment of service requests *before* failures occur, optimizing for user experience and system stability.  The existing patent focuses on reacting to health & importance; this aims for prediction & pre-emptive action.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Failure Model (PFM)**: A machine learning model trained on historical service performance data (response times, error rates, resource utilization, dependency health) to predict the probability of service failure within a configurable time window (e.g., next 5 seconds, next 30 seconds). Output is a “Failure Risk Score” (FRS) between 0 and 1.
*   **Component 2: Dynamic Service Mesh Controller (DSMC)**: Operates within a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd). Receives FRS from PFM, importance rankings of service requests, and real-time service health data.
*   **Component 3: Request Prioritization Engine (RPE)**:  Embedded within DSMC. Adjusts request prioritization based on FRS, importance ranking, and a configurable “Risk Tolerance” level.

**Pseudocode (RPE):**

```
function prioritizeRequest(request, serviceFRS, requestImportance, riskTolerance) {
  // Calculate a weighted score combining FRS and importance
  weightedScore = (serviceFRS * riskTolerance) + (requestImportance * (1 - riskTolerance));

  // Normalize weighted score to a priority level (e.g., 1-5)
  priorityLevel = map(weightedScore, 0, 1, 1, 5);

  //Adjust Request based on priorityLevel
  if (priorityLevel == 1){
    //Delay Request
    delayRequest(request, 500ms); //500ms delay
  } else if (priorityLevel == 2){
    //Lower Thread Priority
    setThreadPriority(request, LOW);
  } else if (priorityLevel == 3){
    //Send as Normal
    sendRequest(request);
  } else if (priorityLevel == 4){
    //Increase Thread Priority
    setThreadPriority(request, HIGH);
    sendRequest(request);
  } else if (priorityLevel == 5){
    //Bypass Queue
    bypassQueue(request);
    sendRequest(request);
  }
}

function map(value, in_min, in_max, out_min, out_max) {
  // Linear mapping function
  return (value - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min;
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Services report performance metrics to PFM.
2.  PFM calculates FRS for each service and sends it to DSMC.
3.  Clients send service requests.
4.  DSMC intercepts requests and retrieves request importance.
5.  RPE within DSMC calculates priority based on FRS, importance, and risk tolerance.
6.  DSMC adjusts request handling (delay, prioritization, queuing) based on calculated priority.
7.  Requests are forwarded to services.

**Configuration:**

*   `riskTolerance`:  A global setting (0-1) controlling the weight given to FRS vs. importance. Higher values prioritize avoiding failures, even at the cost of delaying less important requests.
*   Per-service configuration for PFM training data and prediction window.
*   Per-request configuration for importance ranking.
*   Configurable thresholds for priority levels (e.g., delay thresholds, queue bypass thresholds).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved user experience by proactively avoiding failures for critical requests.
*   Increased system stability by reducing load on failing services.
*   Fine-grained control over service prioritization based on both health and importance.
*   Adaptive behavior based on real-time system conditions.
