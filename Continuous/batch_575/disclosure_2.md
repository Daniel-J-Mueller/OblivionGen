## Dynamic Stack Morphing with Contextual Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the card stack navigation concept by allowing stacks to *morph* – not just reveal/collapse – based on contextual data derived from user behavior, external APIs, or sensor input. This moves beyond simple display of more detailed information to fundamentally altering the stack *content* and presentation.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Data Integration Layer:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with multiple data sources:
    *   User profile data (preferences, history)
    *   Real-time location data (GPS, Wi-Fi)
    *   Environmental sensors (light, noise, temperature - if device has them)
    *   External APIs (weather, news, social media trends, etc.)
*   **Context Engine:** A rules-based and/or machine learning-driven engine to interpret data from the sources and determine appropriate stack morphing actions.  This engine will need adjustable sensitivity thresholds.

**2. Morphing Actions:**

*   **Content Swap:** Replace items within a stack based on context.  Example: A “Restaurants” stack morphs to prioritize nearby open restaurants during lunchtime.
*   **Stack Splitting/Merging:**  Dynamically split or merge stacks based on contextual relevance. Example: A “Travel” stack splits into “Flights”, “Hotels”, and “Activities” when a user begins planning a trip.
*   **Stack Re-ordering:** Change the order of stacks based on predicted user need. Example:  “News” stack moves to the top during major world events.
*   **Visual Theme Adaptation:** Adjust the visual style of a stack (colors, icons, animations) to match the current context or user preference. Example: Dark mode activation based on ambient light levels.
*   **Augmented Stack Elements:** Add interactive elements *to* the stacks themselves, beyond simply revealing more information. Examples: Mini-maps integrated into a “Points of Interest” stack; real-time stock tickers embedded into a “Finance” stack.

**3. Interaction Model:**

*   **Predictive Morphing:**  The system anticipates user needs and proactively morphs stacks *before* a user explicitly interacts with them.
*   **User Override:** Users can manually override the system’s predictive morphing and control stack behavior.  A simple “lock” icon to prevent automatic changes.
*   **Morphing History:**  A log of stack morphing events is maintained, allowing users to review past changes and understand the system’s behavior.
*    **"Why This Changed" Feature:** A tooltip or pop-up explaining *why* a stack morphed, based on the context engine’s rules.

**4. Pseudocode (Context Engine):**

```
function determineStackMorphing(userData, locationData, sensorData, apiData):
    morphingActions = []

    // Example: Restaurant Stack
    if (timeOfDay == "lunchtime" and locationData.nearbyRestaurants > 0):
        morphingActions.add("RestaurantStack: prioritizeNearbyOpenRestaurants")

    // Example: News Stack
    if (apiData.majorWorldEvent == True):
        morphingActions.add("NewsStack: moveTop")

    // Example: Weather Stack
    if (sensorData.temperature < 0 and apiData.weatherForecast == "snow"):
        morphingActions.add("WeatherStack: displayWinterAlert")

    return morphingActions
```

**5. Implementation Notes:**

*   The system should be designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy addition of new data sources and morphing actions.
*   Privacy considerations are crucial.  Users should have control over the data that is collected and used.
*   Performance optimization is essential to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
*   A robust error handling mechanism is needed to gracefully handle unexpected data or system failures.
