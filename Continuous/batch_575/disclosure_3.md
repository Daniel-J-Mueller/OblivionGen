## Dynamic Multi-Perspective Replay

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple tagging of moments to allow for dynamic reconstruction of events from multiple, potentially incomplete, video streams. Imagine a scenario with several independently recording devices (phones, cameras) capturing the same event. This system leverages tagging *and* relative positioning data to build a coherent, navigable replay experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:** Accepts video data from N independent capture devices. Each device provides:
    *   Video stream.
    *   Timestamp data (accurate to at least 100ms).
    *   Positional data (GPS, WiFi triangulation, visual SLAM - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Accuracy target: 1 meter.
    *   User-generated tags, similar to the provided patent (identifying ‘memorable moments’).
*   **Spatial-Temporal Alignment Module:**
    *   Uses positional data to establish the relative positions of each capture device at any given time.
    *   Employs timestamp synchronization to align video streams. Algorithms: Kalman filtering, cross-correlation of audio tracks.
    *   Creates a 3D "event space" where video feeds are spatially anchored.
*   **Tag Consolidation & Prioritization:**
    *   Aggregates tags from all devices.
    *   Calculates tag priority based on:
        *   Number of devices tagging the same moment.
        *   User profile settings (as in the provided patent).
        *   Confidence level of tag (e.g., duration of tagging, consistency across devices).
*   **Dynamic Replay Engine:**
    *   Allows users to "move" through the event space as if they were present at the event.
    *   Provides multiple "viewpoints" based on the positions of the capture devices.
    *   Prioritizes video feeds based on tag priority and user selection.
    *   Seamlessly transitions between video feeds to create a coherent replay.
    *   Option to view “ghosted” representations of other capture devices' perspectives.
*   **AI-Assisted Stitching (Optional):**
    *   If overlapping viewpoints exist, utilize computer vision techniques to stitch together a wider field of view. This is computationally expensive but creates an immersive experience.
*   **Output:**
    *   Interactive 3D replay experience (desktop/mobile app).
    *   Automated generation of "highlight reels" based on prioritized tags.
    *   Exportable video with dynamic switching between viewpoints.

**Pseudocode (Replay Engine):**

```
function replayEvent(eventID, userViewpoint) {
  eventData = loadEventData(eventID) // Load positional data, video feeds, tags

  currentTimestamp = eventData.startTime

  while (currentTimestamp < eventData.endTime) {
    // 1. Determine best viewpoint:
    bestViewpoint = findBestViewpoint(currentTimestamp, userViewpoint, eventData.tags)

    // 2. Select video feed from best viewpoint
    selectedFeed = bestViewpoint.getVideoFeed(currentTimestamp)

    // 3. Render frame from selected feed
    renderFrame(selectedFeed.frame)

    // 4. Advance timestamp
    currentTimestamp += frameDuration
  }
}

function findBestViewpoint(timestamp, userViewpoint, tags) {
  // Calculate scores for each viewpoint based on:
  // - Tag priority at timestamp
  // - Proximity to userViewpoint
  // - Visual clarity (e.g., avoiding occlusions)
  scores = calculateViewpointScores(timestamp, tags)

  // Select viewpoint with highest score
  bestViewpoint = selectMax(scores)

  return bestViewpoint
}
```
