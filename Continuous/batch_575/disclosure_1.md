## Dynamic Reviewer Specialization & Tiering

**Concept:** The existing system assesses review helpfulness generally. This expands on that by dynamically identifying reviewer *specializations* based on item categories reviewed and positive/negative feedback patterns, then tiers reviewers based on specialization and demonstrated reliability. This feeds into a dynamic weighting system for review display.

**Specs:**

**1. Specialization Profiler Module:**

*   **Input:** Review text, item category, user ID, positive/negative feedback counts for each review.
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize NLP to extract key attributes/features discussed in the review.
    *   Categorize reviews based on item attributes (e.g., “battery life”, “screen resolution”, “comfort”).
    *   Calculate a specialization score for each user per item category based on:
        *   Number of reviews in that category.
        *   Average positive feedback received on reviews in that category.
        *   Consistency of attribute coverage (do they consistently address key aspects of items in that category?).
    *   Maintain a user profile storing specialization scores for multiple item categories.
*   **Output:** User profile with dynamic specialization scores per category.

**2. Tiering System:**

*   **Input:** User profiles (from Specialization Profiler), overall positive feedback rate.
*   **Process:**
    *   Define tiers (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) based on:
        *   Specialization scores – higher scores equate to higher tiers within relevant categories.
        *   Overall positive feedback rate.
        *   Review volume.
    *   Dynamically adjust tier assignments based on ongoing performance.
*   **Output:** Tier assignments for each user.

**3. Dynamic Review Weighting System:**

*   **Input:** Item being viewed, list of reviews, user tiers of review authors.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each review:
        *   Determine the reviewer's tier *within the item's category*. If no specialization exists in that category, assign a base weight.
        *   Apply a weighting multiplier based on tier:
            *   Bronze: x0.5
            *   Silver: x1.0
            *   Gold: x1.5
            *   Platinum: x2.0
        *   Additionally:
            *   Prioritize reviews from users with demonstrable purchase history of similar items.
            *   Slightly boost reviews from first-time reviewers of an item to encourage broader participation.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of reviews based on weighted score, to be displayed to the user.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Review Weighting):**

```
function calculateReviewScore(review, itemCategory, userProfile):
  tier = getUserTier(userProfile, itemCategory)
  baseWeight = 1.0
  if tier == "Bronze":
    weightMultiplier = 0.5
  else if tier == "Silver":
    weightMultiplier = 1.0
  else if tier == "Gold":
    weightMultiplier = 1.5
  else if tier == "Platinum":
    weightMultiplier = 2.0
  
  score = baseWeight * weightMultiplier
  
  if userHasPurchasedSimilarItem(userProfile, itemCategory):
    score += 0.1
  
  if isFirstReviewForItem(review):
    score += 0.05
  
  return score
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserProfile`: {`userID`, `reviewCount`, `positiveFeedbackRate`, `specializationScores`: {`category1`: `score`, `category2`: `score`, ...}}
*   `Review`: {`reviewID`, `userID`, `itemID`, `reviewText`, `positiveFeedbackCount`, `negativeFeedbackCount`, `isFirstReviewForItem`: `boolean`}
