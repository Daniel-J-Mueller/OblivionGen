## Dynamic Mood-Based Media Curation & Shared Experience

**Concept:** Extend the social media integration beyond simply *sharing* what you're listening to, to actively *curating* a shared listening experience based on aggregated emotional responses.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Data Acquisition:**

*   **Input:** Integrate with wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers) to gather biometric data – heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance, facial muscle activity (via device cameras - optional, user-opt-in).
*   **Algorithm:**  Develop an AI model (trained on labeled biometric/emotional datasets) to infer the user's emotional state in real-time. States: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Calm, Energetic, Focused. Confidence scoring for each state is crucial.
*   **Privacy:** All biometric data processing *must* be local to the device whenever feasible. Aggregated, anonymized data for trend analysis only is permitted to be sent to the server.  Granular user control over data sharing is paramount.

**2. Shared Mood Profile Creation:**

*   **Group Definition:** Allow users to create "Mood Circles" – groups of friends/family.
*   **Mood Aggregation:**  For each Mood Circle, calculate a *dominant mood* based on the aggregated emotional states of its members *at a given time*.  Weighted averaging based on user-defined "influence" levels within the circle is a key feature.  (e.g., a user might designate a friend as a strong "music influencer").
*   **Time Sensitivity:** Mood profiles are dynamic and updated continuously (e.g., every 5-10 minutes) to reflect current group emotional states.

**3. Dynamic Playlist Generation & Synchronization:**

*   **Mood-to-Music Mapping:** Develop a vast database mapping emotional states to music characteristics (tempo, key, instrumentation, lyrics, genre). The database should be continuously updated based on user feedback.
*   **Playlist Generation:**  Given a dominant mood for a Mood Circle, generate a playlist designed to *enhance* that mood or *shift* it in a desired direction (e.g., from Sadness to Calm).
*   **Synchronized Playback:**  Enable synchronized playback of the generated playlist across all devices of Mood Circle members.  A "DJ" role (rotatable) allows manual override/skipping.
*   **AI-Driven Transitions:** Implement AI algorithms to smoothly transition between songs, minimizing jarring changes and maximizing the emotional flow.

**4. Mood-Based Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Personalized Recommendations:**  Based on a user's personal emotional history *and* the collective mood patterns of their Mood Circles, provide highly personalized music recommendations.
*   **"Vibe Check" Feature:** A "Vibe Check" button allows a user to instantly share their current emotional state with their Mood Circle and request music suggestions tailored to that state.

**Pseudocode (Playlist Generation):**

```
function generatePlaylist(dominantMood, userPreferences, moodCircleHistory):
  // Fetch music characteristics associated with dominantMood
  moodCharacteristics = getMusicCharacteristics(dominantMood)

  // Filter music library based on moodCharacteristics and userPreferences
  filteredMusic = filterMusic(musicLibrary, moodCharacteristics, userPreferences)

  // Rank songs based on relevance to moodCircleHistory
  rankedSongs = rankSongs(filteredMusic, moodCircleHistory)

  // Select top N songs (e.g., 20-30)
  playlist = selectSongs(rankedSongs, N)

  // Apply AI-driven song ordering for optimal emotional flow
  orderedPlaylist = orderPlaylist(playlist)

  return orderedPlaylist
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Ambient Lighting Integration:** Synchronize ambient lighting (smart bulbs) with the playlist's emotional tone.
*   **AR/VR Integration:** Create immersive AR/VR experiences that complement the music and enhance the shared emotional experience.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Utilize haptic feedback (vibrations) to subtly reinforce the emotional tone of the music.
