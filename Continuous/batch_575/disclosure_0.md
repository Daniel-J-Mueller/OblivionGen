## Dynamic Evaporator Surface Modulation

**Concept:** Enhance two-phase thermal management efficiency by actively modulating the evaporator surface properties – specifically, its wettability – to optimize working fluid distribution and heat transfer rates.

**Specs:**

*   **Evaporator Material:** Micro-structured copper alloy coated with a dielectric material (e.g., PTFE).
*   **Microstructure:**  Array of micro-pillars (height: 50-150μm, diameter: 20-50μm) on the evaporator surface. Pillar density is variable across the evaporator plate.
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Embedded array of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) actuators beneath the evaporator surface. Each actuator controls the height of a localized region of the micro-pillar array.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated control unit receives data from multiple temperature sensors:
    *   Evaporator surface temperature (multiple points)
    *   Working fluid temperature (inlet/outlet)
    *   Electronic component temperature
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    ```pseudocode
    FUNCTION ModulateEvaporatorSurface(componentTemp, fluidInletTemp, evaporatorTempMap):
        // Target: Maximize heat transfer rate while preventing dry-out
        
        // Calculate local heat flux based on temp differences
        heatFluxMap = CalculateHeatFlux(componentTemp, fluidInletTemp, evaporatorTempMap)
        
        // Identify hotspots and areas with low fluid coverage
        hotspotMap = IdentifyHotspots(heatFluxMap)
        lowCoverageMap = IdentifyLowCoverage(heatFluxMap, fluidInletTemp)
        
        // Combine maps to prioritize modulation areas
        priorityMap = CombineMaps(hotspotMap, lowCoverageMap)
        
        // Determine actuator adjustments based on priority
        actuatorAdjustments = CalculateAdjustments(priorityMap)
        
        // Apply adjustments to MEMS actuators
        ApplyActuatorAdjustments(actuatorAdjustments)
    END FUNCTION
    ```
*   **Wettability Control:** Actuator adjustments change the effective surface area and geometry visible to the working fluid, effectively altering the surface wettability. Increasing height enhances fluid contact, reducing height minimizes it.
*   **Fluid Type:** Compatible with common two-phase fluids (e.g., water, fluorocarbons).
*   **Power Requirement:** Low-voltage DC power for MEMS actuators and control system.
*   **Coolant Distribution:** Integrated micro-channel network beneath the evaporator surface to ensure even coolant distribution.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Add a capacitance sensor array to monitor working fluid film thickness over the evaporator, providing feedback for real-time control.
*    **Materials:**  Use a biocompatible coating for MEMS actuators to prevent contamination of the working fluid.

**Operational Principle:** The system dynamically adjusts the evaporator surface to optimize working fluid distribution.  In areas with high heat flux, the micro-pillars are raised to maximize fluid contact and enhance heat transfer. In areas with low heat flux or potential for dry-out, the pillars are lowered to redistribute fluid and prevent overheating.  The control system continuously monitors temperatures and adjusts the surface accordingly, creating a self-optimizing thermal management solution.
