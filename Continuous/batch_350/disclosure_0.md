## Dynamic Magnetic Focusing Array

**Concept:** Expand the single magnet focusing concept to a dynamically adjustable array of micro-magnets, controlled electronically, to steer and focus the NFC field. This allows for beamforming – directing the NFC signal towards a specific target area, and adapting to changing device orientations or environmental interference.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:** 3x3 or 5x5 grid of micro-electromagnets (MEMS-fabricated) positioned around the NFC antenna coil.  Each electromagnet is individually addressable.
*   **Magnet Material:** High remanence material for each micro-magnet, combined with a low-power control circuit.  Consider materials with high magnetic permeability.
*   **Control System:** Microcontroller with dedicated DMA for rapid current adjustments to each electromagnet.  Must be capable of operating at frequencies relevant to NFC communication (13.56 MHz and harmonics).
*   **Sensing:** Integrate a low-resolution capacitance or magnetic field sensor array *beneath* the NFC antenna. This array provides feedback about the proximity and relative position of a target device (e.g., another NFC-enabled device, a payment terminal).  
*   **Algorithm:**  Implement a beamforming algorithm based on the sensor data. The algorithm will calculate the optimal current to apply to each micro-magnet in order to maximize the signal strength at the target location. Consider algorithms inspired by phased array radar systems.
*   **Power Management:** Design a power-efficient system to minimize battery drain. Explore pulsed activation of electromagnets to reduce average power consumption.
*   **Physical Integration:** The micro-magnet array should be integrated into a flexible PCB to conform to curved surfaces within the device.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Implement a communication protocol that allows the host device to control the beamforming parameters (e.g., target location, signal strength).
*   **Materials:** Use a ferrite sheet *above* the array, similar to the original patent, to further concentrate the magnetic field.
*   **Antenna Design:** The original spiral antenna will be retained, and optimized for operation with the dynamic magnetic focusing array.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Algorithm):**

```
// Input: Sensor Data (proximity and relative position of target)
// Output: Current settings for each micro-magnet

function calculate_magnet_currents(sensor_data) {
    // 1. Process sensor data to determine target location and orientation.

    // 2. Calculate the ideal magnetic field distribution needed to focus signal on target.

    // 3. Implement an iterative optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent) to 
    //    find the current settings for each micro-magnet that produce the desired
    //    magnetic field distribution.
    //    Use a cost function that penalizes deviations from the target field.

    // 4. Apply constraints to current settings (e.g., maximum current limits).

    // 5. Output the calculated current settings for each micro-magnet.
}

// Main loop:
while (true) {
    sensor_data = read_sensor_data();
    magnet_currents = calculate_magnet_currents(sensor_data);
    apply_magnet_currents(magnet_currents);
    transmit_NFC_signal();
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved NFC range and reliability, especially in challenging environments.
*   Secure NFC pairing – directing the signal to a specific target device.
*   Directional NFC payments – preventing accidental payments to nearby devices.
*   Adaptive NFC communication – automatically adjusting the signal direction based on device orientation and movement.
