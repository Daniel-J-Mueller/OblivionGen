## Sonic Scene Reconstruction & Layered Audio Manipulation

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond single-voice enhancement to reconstruct a full sonic scene, identifying and isolating *all* prominent sound sources (not just voice & noise), then allow for granular, layered manipulation of those sources *after* reconstruction.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones, configurable geometry).  Emphasis on spatial resolution, not simply quantity.
    *   High-fidelity ADCs (24-bit/96kHz minimum) with low noise floor.
    *   Dedicated DSP/FPGA for real-time processing.
    *   Optional: IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to compensate for device/user movement.

*   **Software Modules:**
    1.  **Acoustic Scene Analyzer (ASA):**  Utilizes advanced beamforming, source localization algorithms (e.g., MUSIC, ESPRIT), and machine learning (trained on diverse soundscapes) to identify and isolate individual sound sources within the environment.  Outputs:
        *   Spatial coordinates (X, Y, Z) for each detected source.
        *   Time-frequency representation of each source's audio signal.
        *   Source classification (e.g., human speech, music, vehicle, animal, etc.).
    2.  **Layered Audio Representation (LAR):**  Organizes the extracted audio signals into distinct layers based on their spatial location and classification. Each layer represents a single sound source or a coherent group of sources (e.g., a band playing).
    3.  **Granular Audio Manipulation Engine (GAME):**  Provides a user interface (GUI or API) for manipulating individual layers in real-time.  Features:
        *   **Volume Control:**  Per-layer volume adjustment.
        *   **EQ/Filtering:**  Per-layer equalization and filtering.
        *   **Spatial Panning:**  Adjust the perceived spatial location of each layer.
        *   **Time Stretching/Pitch Shifting:**  Modify the tempo and pitch of individual layers.
        *   **Acoustic Reverb/Ambience Control:**  Simulate different acoustic environments for each layer.
        *   **Layer Masking/Mixing:**  Selectively mute or blend layers together.
        *   **Harmonic/Inharmonic Synthesis**: Ability to create entirely new layers based on existing harmonic or inharmonic content.
    4.  **Acoustic Reconstruction Module (ARM):**  Recombines the manipulated layers to generate a reconstructed acoustic scene.

*   **Pseudocode (ARM - Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructScene(layers[], targetAcousticProfile):
  //layers is an array of processed audio layers
  //targetAcousticProfile defines desired reverb, ambience, etc.

  combinedSignal = initializeEmptyAudioBuffer()

  for each layer in layers:
    //Apply layer-specific spatialization
    spatializedLayer = applySpatialization(layer, layer.position, targetAcousticProfile)

    //Apply layer-specific effects
    effectedLayer = applyEffects(spatializedLayer, layer.effects)

    //Mix effected layer into combined signal
    combinedSignal = mix(combinedSignal, effectedLayer, layer.volume)

  //Apply final mastering effects (compression, EQ)
  masteredSignal = applyMastering(combinedSignal)

  return masteredSignal
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   **Immersive Audio Experiences:** Create realistic and customizable soundscapes for VR/AR.
    *   **Assistive Listening Devices:** Enhance speech clarity and suppress noise in challenging environments.
    *   **Audio Restoration:** Isolate and repair damaged or corrupted audio recordings.
    *   **Interactive Sound Design:** Allow users to dynamically shape and manipulate soundscapes in real-time.
    *   **Security & Surveillance:** Isolate specific sounds (e.g., gunshots, breaking glass) in a noisy environment.
