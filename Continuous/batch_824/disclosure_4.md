## Adaptive Haptic Scroll Resistance

**Concept:** Integrate haptic feedback with gaze-tracked scrolling, dynamically altering scroll resistance based on content type *and* predicted user cognitive load.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing gaze tracking system (as per the referenced patent).
    *   Haptic layer integrated into the device's scroll surface (e.g., electroactive polymers, micro-actuators, or textured surface with variable friction). Resolution: 1mm granularity. Force range: 0-5N.
    *   Biometric sensor suite (heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA)) – integrated into the device’s grip/frame.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Content Analysis Module:*  Analyzes displayed content in real-time, categorizing it (e.g., dense text, image gallery, video feed, map).  Assigns a ‘cognitive complexity’ score based on visual density, information rate, and structural complexity.
    *   *Gaze Pattern Analyzer:* Monitors gaze dwell time, saccade frequency, and pupil dilation to infer user engagement and cognitive load.  Calculates a ‘cognitive load’ score.
    *   *Haptic Control Algorithm:*  Combines content complexity and cognitive load scores to dynamically adjust scroll resistance.  
        *   Low Complexity / Low Load: Minimal resistance, ‘smooth scrolling’.
        *   High Complexity / High Load: Increased resistance, forcing slower, more deliberate scrolling.
        *   Adaptive Zones:  Resistance increases *progressively* as the user approaches areas of high information density (identified by the content analysis module).
        *   Personalization: Algorithm learns user preferences over time, adjusting resistance curves based on individual scrolling habits and biometric responses.
    *   *Biometric Integration Module:* Calibrates baseline biometric data for each user. Processes HRV and EDA data to refine the cognitive load score.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Control Algorithm):**

```
function adjustHapticResistance(contentComplexity, cognitiveLoad, userPreferences):
    # Normalize scores to a range of 0-1
    normalizedComplexity = clamp(contentComplexity, 0, 1)
    normalizedLoad = clamp(cognitiveLoad, 0, 1)
    
    # Weighted average of complexity and load (adjust weights as needed)
    combinedScore = (0.6 * normalizedComplexity) + (0.4 * normalizedLoad)

    # Apply user preferences (learned resistance curve)
    resistanceMultiplier = getUserPreference(user) # returns a function of combinedScore

    # Calculate final resistance value
    baseResistance = 0.1 N (default)
    finalResistance = baseResistance * (1 + (combinedScore * resistanceMultiplier))

    # Clamp resistance to a safe range
    finalResistance = clamp(finalResistance, 0.1 N, 5 N)

    # Set haptic actuator force
    setHapticForce(finalResistance)
```

**Operational Modes:**

*   *Focus Mode:* Maximizes resistance to encourage deliberate reading/viewing of complex content.
*   *Flow Mode:* Minimizes resistance for quick browsing of less demanding content.
*   *Adaptive Mode:* Dynamically adjusts resistance based on content and user state (default).
