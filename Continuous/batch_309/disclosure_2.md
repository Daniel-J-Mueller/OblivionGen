## Autonomous Inventory Orchestration with Dynamic Mesh Networking

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Mobile Robotic Units (MRUs) – scaled down versions of the drive units described in the patent, but modular.
*   **Communication:** IEEE 802.11s mesh networking protocol. Each MRU acts as a node, dynamically establishing and maintaining a self-healing network.
*   **Sensing:**
    *   Upward-facing wide-angle camera for ceiling-mounted beacon detection (described below).
    *   Standard obstacle avoidance sensors (LiDAR, ultrasonic).
    *   RFID/NFC reader/writer for item-level tracking.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for dead reckoning.
*   **Beacon System:** Ceiling-mounted, low-power beacons emitting unique identifiers. Beacons provide absolute positioning reference points *in addition to* the floor marker grid. Beacons are wirelessly powered (inductive charging).
*   **Inventory Holders:** Standardized, modular “pods” that attach to the MRUs. Pods are equipped with weight sensors and RFID/NFC tags.
*   **Central Management System (CMS):** Cloud-based platform for task assignment, fleet management, and data analytics.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** Upon power-up, each MRU establishes a mesh network connection with neighboring units. It performs a localization process, combining floor marker data with beacon triangulation.
2.  **Task Assignment:** CMS assigns tasks to MRUs based on proximity, battery level, and pod capacity. Tasks include: picking, delivering, restocking, and inventory auditing.
3.  **Path Planning:** MRU uses a hybrid path planning algorithm:
    *   **Global Path:** CMS generates a high-level path between origin and destination, utilizing the 2D floor grid.
    *   **Local Path:** MRU utilizes real-time sensor data (obstacle avoidance, beacon triangulation) and the mesh network to refine the path. Mesh network facilitates collaborative obstacle avoidance – if one MRU detects an obstruction, it broadcasts the information to neighboring units.
4.  **Inventory Handling:**
    *   MRU docks with inventory locations (shelves, conveyors).
    *   Utilizes robotic arm (integrated into the MRU) to manipulate inventory pods.
    *   Weight sensors and RFID/NFC tags verify item counts and identify items.
5.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** The mesh network allows for dynamic reconfiguration of the workspace. If a section of the floor grid is blocked (e.g., due to maintenance), the MRUs automatically reroute and the CMS updates the global path planning accordingly.

**Pseudocode (MRU Local Path Refinement):**

```
FUNCTION refinePath(currentLocation, destination, sensorData, meshData):
  // sensorData: Data from LiDAR, IMU, etc.
  // meshData: Obstacle/rerouting information from neighboring MRUs

  IF obstacleDetected(sensorData) OR reroutingRequired(meshData):
    // Find a viable alternate path based on sensor data, mesh data, and the 2D floor grid
    alternatePath = findAlternatePath(currentLocation, destination)

    IF alternatePathFound:
      RETURN alternatePath
    ELSE:
      // Request assistance from CMS (e.g., to clear the obstruction)
      requestAssistance()
      RETURN currentPath  // Continue on original path if no alternate found

  ELSE:
    // Continue moving towards destination using current path
    RETURN currentPath
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond static path planning and utilizes a dynamic mesh network for truly collaborative and adaptive inventory orchestration. The ceiling beacon system provides an additional layer of localization accuracy and enables operation in environments with poor floor marker visibility.  The collaborative obstacle avoidance and dynamic reconfiguration capabilities significantly improve the efficiency and resilience of the inventory management process.
