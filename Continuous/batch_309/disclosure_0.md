## Adaptive Layer Prediction & Pre-Rendering

**Concept:** Extend the layer-based rendering system to predict user viewport movement and pre-render layers *before* they are requested, dramatically reducing perceived latency and improving responsiveness, especially on mobile devices or high-latency connections.

**Specifications:**

**1. Client-Side Motion Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** User input (touch, mouse, gyro data), Layer tree (received from intermediary system), historical viewport data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a Kalman filter or similar predictive algorithm to estimate the user's future viewport position/scale/rotation.  Prioritize prediction smoothness over absolute accuracy to minimize jarring shifts.
    *   Maintain a queue of predicted viewport states (e.g., next 5 states, each 30ms apart).
    *   Analyze layer dependencies within the layer tree.  Identify layers that *will likely* become visible in the predicted viewport states.
*   **Output:** List of layers to pre-render, associated predicted viewport state.

**2. Intermediary System Integration – Pre-Render Request:**

*   The client sends a “Pre-Render Request” message to the intermediary system.
*   This message includes:
    *   List of layers to pre-render.
    *   Associated predicted viewport state(s).
    *   A ‘priority’ flag (high, medium, low) derived from prediction confidence & layer complexity.

**3. Intermediary System – Accelerated Pre-Rendering:**

*   The intermediary system receives the pre-render request.
*   It prioritizes rendering the requested layers *ahead of* normal rendering requests.
*   Rendering can be optimized based on the predicted viewport – for example, by reducing rendering resolution for parts of the layer outside the viewport.
*   The rendered layers are cached *separately* from the regular layer cache.

**4. Client-Side – Smart Layer Switching:**

*   When the user's actual viewport position matches a predicted state:
    *   The client immediately switches to the pre-rendered layers for that state. This happens *before* any rendering request is sent to the server.
*   If the prediction is incorrect:
    *   The client reverts to requesting the layers normally.  The pre-rendered layers are discarded.
*   A dynamic ‘prediction confidence’ metric adjusts the aggressiveness of the pre-rendering system.  Lower confidence means fewer layers are pre-rendered.

**5. Data Structures:**

*   `PredictedViewportState`:  {timestamp (ms), x, y, scale, rotation}
*   `PreRenderRequest`: {layerIDs (array), viewportStates (array of PredictedViewportState), priority (enum: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)}
*   `PredictionConfidence`:  A floating-point value between 0.0 (low confidence) and 1.0 (high confidence).  Calculated based on user input consistency and historical prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function updatePrediction(inputData) {
    predictedViewport = predictNextViewport(inputData);
    layersToPreRender = determineLayersVisibleInViewport(predictedViewport);
    sendPreRenderRequest(layersToPreRender, predictedViewport);
}

function handleServerResponse(layerData, viewportState) {
  if(currentViewportState == viewportState) {
    renderLayer(layerData);
  }
}
```

**Refinement:**

*   Extend the system to predict *entire scenes* by identifying relationships between layers and pre-fetching associated assets.
*   Implement a ‘collaborative prediction’ system where multiple clients share prediction data to improve accuracy.
*   Add support for pre-rendering different levels of detail (LOD) based on predicted distance from the viewport.
