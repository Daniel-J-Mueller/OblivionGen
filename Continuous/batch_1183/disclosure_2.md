## Automated Network 'Health' Prediction & Preemptive Remediation

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the existing network testing framework by incorporating predictive analytics to forecast potential network failures *before* they occur, and then autonomously initiates remediation steps. It moves beyond reactive testing to proactive maintenance.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Historical Data Collector:** Continuously monitors and logs all test results from the existing testing framework (as detailed in the provided patent), including timestamps, specific test failures/successes, device identifiers, connection types, and network load metrics. This data is stored in a time-series database.
2.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:**  Utilizes machine learning algorithms (specifically, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and/or time-series forecasting models) to learn baseline network behavior based on the historical data. It identifies deviations from this baseline that may indicate developing issues. The engine assigns a 'health score' to each network connection and device.
3.  **Predictive Failure Module:**  Based on identified anomalies and health scores, this module predicts the probability of future failures.  It focuses on trends rather than isolated incidents.  Algorithms consider the interconnectedness of devices and potential cascading failures.
4.  **Automated Remediation Engine:**  Upon predicting a likely failure, this engine initiates pre-defined remediation actions. These actions are configurable and range from simple (e.g., restarting a service, rerouting traffic) to complex (e.g., adjusting device configurations, initiating software updates).
5.  **Dynamic Test Plan Adjustment:** Based on predictions and remediation actions, the system can dynamically adjust the existing test plan (as detailed in the provided patent).  If a specific connection is predicted to be problematic, the system can increase the frequency and/or intensity of tests on that connection.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** The results of remediation actions are fed back into the system to improve the accuracy of predictions and refine the remediation strategies.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Collect Data
  historicalData = collectNetworkData();

  // 2. Anomaly Detection
  anomalies = detectAnomalies(historicalData);

  // 3. Predictive Failure Analysis
  predictions = predictFailures(anomalies);

  // 4. Remediation
  for each prediction in predictions {
    if (prediction.probability > threshold) {
      remediationAction = selectRemediationAction(prediction);
      executeRemediationAction(remediationAction);
      logRemediationAction(remediationAction);
    }
  }

  // 5. Dynamic Test Plan Adjustment
  adjustTestPlanBasedOnPredictions(predictions);
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **NetworkConnection:** {id, devices, connectionType, healthScore, historicalData, predictedFailureProbability}
*   **RemediationAction:** {actionType, targetDevice, parameters}
*   **TestPlanEntry:** {testName, testParameters, frequency}

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance server with large storage capacity (for historical data).
*   Dedicated network interface for monitoring traffic.
*   Integration with existing network management systems.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Self-Learning Remediation:** Utilize reinforcement learning to allow the system to learn optimal remediation strategies over time.
*   **Security Integration:** Incorporate security threat detection into the prediction engine.
*   **Integration with Network Virtualization Platforms:** Allow for automated remediation actions within virtualized network environments.
*   **AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis:** Employ AI to automatically identify the root cause of network failures.
