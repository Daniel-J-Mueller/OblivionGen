## Adaptive Environmental Storytelling via Proximal Presence

**Concept:** Extend the "pre-staged communication" idea beyond just video/audio to subtly manipulate the environment of the receiving household based on inferred emotional state/activity of the transmitting household. Think of it as a 'digital ambiance' extension of the existing tech.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors (Transmitting Device):**
    *   High-resolution camera for activity recognition (beyond just presence). Focus on body language, facial expressions.
    *   Microphone array for speech analysis (tone, emotion detection, keyword spotting).
    *   Environmental sensors: Temperature, light level, ambient sound.
    *   Connectivity: High bandwidth, low latency connection to receiving device.
*   **Sensors (Receiving Device):**
    *   Smart home integration: Control over lighting, sound system, thermostat, scent diffuser (optional).
    *   Microphone for local voice commands/cancellation.
*   **Processing (Both Devices):**
    *   Edge AI processing: Minimize latency.
    *   Emotion/Activity Inference Engine: Trained model to interpret sensor data and infer emotional state/activity (e.g., "relaxed," "focused," "excited," "cooking," "reading").
*   **Communication Protocol:** Secure, encrypted connection.
*   **User Interface (Both Devices):**
    *   Configuration: Allow users to define "proximal ambiance" profiles. These profiles map inferred transmitting household states to receiving household environmental changes.
    *   Privacy Controls: Granular control over which data is shared and which environmental changes are allowed.

**Pseudocode (Receiving Device - Main Loop):**

```
while (true) {
  // Receive data from transmitting device
  data = receiveData();

  // Infer emotional state/activity of transmitting household
  state = inferState(data);

  // Retrieve corresponding ambiance profile
  profile = getAmbianceProfile(state);

  // Apply environmental changes
  if (profile != null) {
    setLighting(profile.lighting);
    setSoundLevel(profile.soundLevel);
    setTemperature(profile.temperature);
    //Optional: setScent(profile.scent);
  }
}
```

**Ambiance Profile Example:**

```json
{
  "state": "relaxed",
  "lighting": "dim, warm",
  "soundLevel": "low, ambient music",
  "temperature": "22C",
  "scent": "lavender"
}
```

**Novelty:**

This isn't just about *seeing* someone, it's about *feeling* their presence in a more holistic way. It moves beyond simple communication to create a shared atmosphere. The user is *not* simply enabling communication, but is also controlling how the *environment* interacts with their remote counterpart. The AI inference combined with environmental control creates a unique, personalized experience. While smart homes exist, and video calls exist, this merges the two to create a novel 'proximal presence' system.
