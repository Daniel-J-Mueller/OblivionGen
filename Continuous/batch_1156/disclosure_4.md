## Dynamic Quadtree Mesh Generation for Procedural Content

**Concept:** Extend the quadtree methodology beyond map tile representation to serve as a foundational structure for *generating* and dynamically adapting 3D meshes representing procedural content – landscapes, cityscapes, interiors – not just visualizing pre-existing data. This moves beyond encoding relationships *of* existing tiles to *creating* geometry based on those relationships.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Quadtree Mesh Generation:**

   *   **Data Structure:** A quadtree where each node doesn't simply *reference* a tile, but *defines* a geometric primitive (initially a simple plane).  Leaf nodes represent the finest level of detail.
   *   **Mesh Construction:**  Traverse the quadtree.  For each node, create a geometric mesh from the primitive it represents.  Neighboring nodes at the same level are stitched together seamlessly.
   *   **Level of Detail (LOD):**  The quadtree structure inherently provides LOD.  Distance from the "camera" (or active viewpoint) determines which levels of the tree are rendered.  Lower levels are simplified or culled.

**2. Procedural Content Rules:**

   *   **Node Attributes:**  Each quadtree node gains attributes defining its content. Examples:
        *   `TerrainType`: (Grass, Rock, Water, Sand) – dictates material and vertex displacement.
        *   `BuildingDensity`: (0-1) – probability of a building spawning at this location.
        *   `RoadAlignment`: (Vector) – indicates road direction.
        *   `VegetationType`: (Tree, Bush, Flower) - dictates vegetation spawned within the node.
   *   **Rule Engine:** A rule engine applies these attributes to generate content.  Example rule: "If `TerrainType` is 'Grass' and `BuildingDensity` > 0.5, spawn a small building."
   *   **Content Spawning:** The rule engine instantiates prefabs or generates procedural geometry based on the rules, attaching them to the quadtree node’s mesh.

**3. Dynamic Adaptation & Real-Time Modification:**

   *   **Node Splitting/Merging:** The quadtree can dynamically split nodes for increased detail or merge nodes for simplification.  This is triggered by proximity to the viewpoint or by content changes.
   *   **Content Modification:**  Rules can be applied in real-time to modify existing content.  Example: "If a building is destroyed, replace it with rubble."
   *   **Event Propagation:**  Events (e.g., explosions, construction) propagate through the quadtree, triggering rule applications in neighboring nodes.

**4. Pseudocode (Dynamic Node Splitting):**

```
function DynamicSplit(node, detailThreshold) {
  if (distanceToViewpoint(node) < detailThreshold) {
    if (node is a leaf node) {
      // Subdivide the node into four children
      children = createChildren(node)
      // Apply procedural rules to each child
      for (child in children) {
        applyProceduralRules(child)
      }
      // Replace the original node with the children
    } else {
      // Recursively split the children
      for (child in node.children) {
        DynamicSplit(child, detailThreshold)
      }
    }
  }
}

function applyProceduralRules(node) {
  // Get node attributes (TerrainType, BuildingDensity, etc.)
  attributes = getNodeAttributes(node)

  // Evaluate rules based on attributes
  if (attributes.TerrainType == "Grass" && attributes.BuildingDensity > 0.5) {
    // Spawn a building
    spawnBuilding(node)
  }

  // Add more rules as needed
}
```

**5. Technical Considerations:**

*   **Multithreading:** Parallelize quadtree traversal and content generation to improve performance.
*   **GPU Instancing:** Use GPU instancing to efficiently render large numbers of procedurally generated objects.
*   **Streaming:** Stream quadtree data and content from disk to reduce memory usage.
