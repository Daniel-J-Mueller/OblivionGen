## Dynamic Task Decomposition & Re-Assembly

**Concept:** Expand the task categorization to include *sub-task* definitions, allowing tasks to be broken down into smaller, independently executable units. Then, dynamically re-assemble these sub-task results based on dependencies, potentially across heterogeneous hardware. This goes beyond simple categorization; it's about actively *deconstructing* and *reconstructing* work.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sub-Task Definition Language (STDL):**

*   A JSON-based schema for defining tasks and their constituent sub-tasks.
*   Each task contains:
    *   `task_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `task_description`: Human-readable description.
    *   `sub_tasks`: Array of sub-task objects.
*   Each sub-task object contains:
    *   `sub_task_id`: Unique identifier within the parent task.
    *   `execution_requirements`: Specifies hardware/software prerequisites (CPU cores, GPU memory, OS version, specific libraries).
    *   `input_dependencies`: Array of `sub_task_id`s that must complete before this sub-task can start.
    *   `output_dependencies`: Array of `sub_task_id`s that depend on this sub-task's completion.
    *   `execution_code`: Pointer to executable code (script, binary, function).  Can be a URL for remote execution.
    *   `estimated_runtime`:  Predicted execution time.
*   Example STDL:

```json
{
  "task_id": "image_process_123",
  "task_description": "Process a large image",
  "sub_tasks": [
    {
      "sub_task_id": "resize_1",
      "execution_requirements": { "cpu_cores": 4 },
      "input_dependencies": [],
      "output_dependencies": ["sharpen_1"],
      "execution_code": "resize_script.py",
      "estimated_runtime": 60
    },
    {
      "sub_task_id": "sharpen_1",
      "execution_requirements": { "gpu_memory": "2GB" },
      "input_dependencies": ["resize_1"],
      "output_dependencies": ["upload_1"],
      "execution_code": "sharpen_script.py",
      "estimated_runtime": 30
    },
    {
      "sub_task_id": "upload_1",
      "execution_requirements": {},
      "input_dependencies": ["sharpen_1"],
      "output_dependencies": [],
      "execution_code": "upload_script.py",
      "estimated_runtime": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Dynamic Task Scheduler:**

*   Receives a task described in STDL.
*   Parses the task and creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the dependencies between sub-tasks.
*   Monitors available resources (CPU, GPU, memory) across the heterogeneous system.
*   Assigns sub-tasks to available resources based on `execution_requirements` and resource availability, prioritizing tasks with fewer dependencies.
*   Implements a queuing system for tasks that cannot be immediately executed due to resource constraints.
*   Tracks sub-task execution status (pending, running, completed, failed).
*   Collects results from completed sub-tasks.

**3. Result Assembly Module:**

*   Receives results from the Dynamic Task Scheduler.
*   Based on `output_dependencies` and the DAG, assembles the sub-task results into the final task output.
*   Handles error conditions – if a sub-task fails, the module should attempt to recover or notify the user.
*   Supports intermediate result caching for performance optimization.

**4. Resource Discovery & Profiling:**

*   A background service that continuously discovers and profiles available resources in the heterogeneous system.
*   Collects data on CPU speed, GPU memory, OS version, installed libraries, and network bandwidth.
*   Stores this information in a central repository.
*   Provides the Dynamic Task Scheduler with up-to-date resource information.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Task Scheduler):**

```
function schedule_task(task_description):
  task_graph = create_dependency_graph(task_description)
  ready_tasks = find_ready_tasks(task_graph)

  while ready_tasks:
    task = ready_tasks.pop()
    resource = find_available_resource(task.execution_requirements)
    if resource:
      execute_task(task, resource)
      update_task_status(task, "completed")
      update_ready_tasks(task, task_graph)
    else:
      add_task_to_queue(task)

  return assemble_results(task_graph)
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simply matching tasks to *capable* devices, to actively *deconstructing* complex tasks and dynamically *re-assembling* results. It’s about maximizing resource utilization and adapting to a changing system environment. This allows truly parallel work on a single task utilizing the most efficient hardware available.
