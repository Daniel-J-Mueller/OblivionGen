## Dynamic Model Stitching for Personalized AI Agents

**Core Concept:** Instead of a single, globally updated ML model, create a system of rapidly stitched-together, personalized model fragments based on real-time user interaction and inferred cognitive state. This allows for extreme adaptation *during* a single user session, far beyond incremental or weakly supervised learning.

**Specifications:**

**1. Cognitive State Inference Module:**
   * **Input:** Raw user input (speech, gesture, text), interaction history (past N turns), device sensor data (e.g., gaze tracking, heart rate variability - *optional*).
   * **Process:** Utilize a dedicated, lightweight ML model (e.g., LSTM or Transformer) to infer a *cognitive state vector*. This vector represents the user’s current mental state – levels of frustration, confusion, engagement, cognitive load, emotional valence, etc.  Normalization and scaling of components within the vector is critical.
   * **Output:** Cognitive State Vector (a numerical representation of the user’s current cognitive state).

**2. Model Fragment Library:**
   * **Structure:** A repository of small, specialized ML models ("fragments"). Each fragment is trained on a specific task or user demographic/cognitive state.  Examples:
      * "Short-Form Query Resolution" - Optimized for brief, direct questions.
      * "Detailed Explanation" - Focuses on providing comprehensive answers.
      * “Empathic Response” - Prioritizes emotional understanding.
      * “Technical Jargon Reduction” – Simplifies complex language.
      * "High Cognitive Load Assistance" - Delivers information in a highly structured, easily digestible format.
   * **Metadata:** Each fragment must have associated metadata, including:
      * Task Specialization (e.g., Q&A, task completion, entertainment).
      * Cognitive State Compatibility (range of cognitive state vectors where the fragment performs optimally).
      * Performance Metrics (accuracy, latency, resource consumption).

**3. Dynamic Stitching Engine:**
   * **Input:** Cognitive State Vector, User Input, Current Active Fragment(s).
   * **Process:**
      1. **Fragment Selection:** Based on the Cognitive State Vector, select the N most compatible fragments from the Model Fragment Library. Prioritize fragments with the highest performance metrics for the current input type.
      2. **Fragment Blending:**  Utilize a weighted averaging or a more complex ensemble method (e.g., stacking, boosting) to combine the outputs of the selected fragments. The weights are determined by the degree of cognitive state compatibility *and* the fragment’s performance score.
      3. **Output Generation:** Generate the final response/action based on the blended output.
      4. **Real-time Adaptation:** Continuously monitor user interaction (e.g., response time, explicit feedback) to refine the fragment selection weights and potentially add or remove fragments from the active ensemble.
   * **Output:** Response/Action.

**4. Fragment Learning Pipeline:**
   * **Data Source:** Anonymized user interaction data (input, context, output, feedback).
   * **Process:**
      1. **Segmentation:** Divide interaction data into segments based on user cognitive state (inferred from historical data).
      2. **Fragment Training:** Train new ML model fragments on each segment, optimizing for performance within that specific cognitive state.
      3. **Fragment Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate the performance of new fragments using a holdout dataset.
      4. **Fragment Integration:**  Automatically integrate high-performing fragments into the Model Fragment Library.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateResponse(userInput, userContext):
  cognitiveState = inferCognitiveState(userInput, userContext)
  compatibleFragments = selectFragments(cognitiveState)
  blendedOutput = blendFragmentOutputs(compatibleFragments, userInput)
  return blendedOutput

function selectFragments(cognitiveState):
  fragments = ModelFragmentLibrary.getFragments()
  sortedFragments = sortFragmentsByCompatibility(fragments, cognitiveState)
  return sortedFragments[:N] // Select top N fragments

function blendFragmentOutputs(fragments, userInput):
  outputs = []
  for fragment in fragments:
    outputs.append(fragment.predict(userInput))
  weightedSum = weightedAverage(outputs, fragmentCompatibilityScores)
  return weightedSum
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond continuous model adaptation (incremental/weakly supervised learning) towards *real-time model composition*.  It dynamically stitches together specialized model fragments to provide a highly personalized and context-aware experience, reacting to subtle changes in the user’s cognitive state *during* a single interaction. This offers a significant advantage in scenarios requiring nuanced and adaptive responses, such as mental health support, personalized education, or complex task assistance.
