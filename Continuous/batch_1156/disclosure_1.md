## Adaptive Code Coverage Weighting Based on Module Interdependency

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting code coverage metrics based on the identified interdependencies between software modules during testing and promotion evaluation.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *achieving* coverage thresholds. This expands on that by acknowledging that not all code is created equal – coverage in a highly interdependent module carries more weight than coverage in a relatively isolated one. This allows for more nuanced promotion decisions and potentially reduces the need for blanket high coverage requirements.

**System Components:**

1.  **Dependency Analysis Engine:**  A static analysis tool that examines the codebase to identify module dependencies. This engine creates a directed graph representing those dependencies. Node = Module. Edge = Dependency (Module A depends on Module B). The output is a dependency graph.

2.  **Coverage Weighting Algorithm:** This algorithm uses the dependency graph to calculate weights for each module's code coverage. Modules with high *in-degree* (many dependencies *on* them) receive higher weights. Modules with high *out-degree* (many dependencies *from* them) also receive increased weight – representing potential cascading impacts from uncovered code.

    *   **Weight Calculation:**
        *   `Module Weight = (In-Degree / Max(In-Degree)) * WeightFactor_In + (Out-Degree / Max(Out-Degree)) * WeightFactor_Out`
        *   `WeightFactor_In` and `WeightFactor_Out` are configurable parameters.  Values range from 0.0 to 1.0.

3.  **Weighted Code Coverage Aggregator:** This component receives code coverage data from testing environments (as described in the provided patent) and applies the module weights to calculate an *overall weighted code coverage score*.

    *   `Weighted Coverage = Σ (Module Coverage * Module Weight)` for all modules.

4.  **Dynamic Promotion Thresholds:**  Promotion criteria are no longer fixed.  Instead, thresholds are adjusted based on the weighted coverage score.  A module with a lower absolute coverage, but a high weighted score (due to critical dependencies), could still be promoted.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Dependency Analysis - Outputs a dependency graph
Graph = AnalyzeDependencies(Codebase)

// Calculate Module Weights
For Each Module in Graph:
    InDegree = GetInDegree(Module, Graph)
    OutDegree = GetOutDegree(Module, Graph)
    MaxInDegree = Max(InDegree of all Modules in Graph)
    MaxOutDegree = Max(OutDegree of all Modules in Graph)
    Module.Weight = (InDegree / MaxInDegree) * WeightFactor_In + (OutDegree / MaxOutDegree) * WeightFactor_Out

// Receive Code Coverage Data
CoverageData = GetCoverageDataFromTestEnvironment()

// Calculate Weighted Coverage Score
WeightedCoverageScore = 0
For Each Module in CoverageData:
    WeightedCoverageScore += Module.Coverage * Module.Weight

// Determine Promotion Eligibility
If WeightedCoverageScore >= PromotionThreshold:
    ApprovePromotion()
Else:
    ReportFailure()
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   More accurate reflection of code quality and risk.
*   Reduced need for excessively strict coverage requirements.
*   Improved promotion decision-making.
*   Focus testing effort on the most critical areas of the codebase.
*   Adaptive thresholds allow for more nuanced risk assessment.
