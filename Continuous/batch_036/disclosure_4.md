## Modular Kinetic Stand System

**Concept:** A stand that isn't static, but *reacts* to the device it supports, and/or user input, through kinetic articulation. It's built from a system of interconnected, magnetically-coupled modules.

**Modules:**

*   **Base Module:** Circular or polygonal base, containing the primary power source (inductive charging coil for supported devices) and a microcontroller. Features multiple magnetic coupling points on its upper surface.
*   **Articulating Module:** Core building block. Contains a miniature, low-power motor/actuator, a magnetic coupling point on each face, and a 9-axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit).  Can rotate on multiple axes.
*   **Support Module:**  The module that directly holds the device. Includes a compliant gripping mechanism (e.g., expandable silicone 'fingers' or a flexible cradle) that adapts to various device shapes and sizes. Magnetic coupling points on all faces.
*   **Sensor Module:** Optional module containing additional sensors (light, proximity, touch) that feed data to the microcontroller.

**Functionality & Control:**

1.  **Magnetic Coupling:** Modules connect via strong neodymium magnets embedded within the coupling points. This allows for easy assembly/disassembly and reconfiguration.
2.  **Kinetic Response:** The microcontroller processes data from the IMU and optional sensors. If the device on the stand is moved (e.g., tilted, bumped), the microcontroller activates the actuators in the articulating modules to *counteract* the movement, keeping the device stable and level.
3.  **User Control:** A companion app allows users to customize the stand's behavior. Options include:
    *   **'Active Stabilization':** Enables the kinetic response.
    *   **'Follow Mode':** The stand *intentionally* mirrors the userâ€™s movements with the device (e.g., for hands-free viewing while exercising).
    *   **'Gesture Control':**  Use hand gestures detected by the sensor module to control the device (e.g., adjust volume, skip tracks).
    *   **'Dynamic Display':** Modules can articulate to change the viewing angle of the device or create a 'wave' or 'ripple' effect for aesthetic purposes.
4.  **Power:** Wireless power transfer (inductive charging) from the base module to the device. Modules themselves are powered via the base, or incorporate small, rechargeable batteries.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Module Control):**

```
// Within each Articulating Module

function updateOrientation() {
  // Read IMU data (acceleration, gyroscope)
  imuData = readIMU();

  // Calculate desired adjustment based on imuData & target orientation
  adjustment = calculateAdjustment(imuData);

  // Activate motor to achieve adjustment
  activateMotor(adjustment);
}

function receiveCommand(command) {
  // Process commands from the microcontroller (e.g., angle, speed)
  // Update internal target orientation
}
```

**Materials:**

*   High-strength polymer for module housings.
*   Neodymium magnets.
*   Miniature motors/actuators.
*   9-axis IMUs.
*   Wireless charging coil.
*   Silicone/flexible material for device grips.
