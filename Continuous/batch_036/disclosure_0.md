## Dynamic OS Profile Generation & “Ghosting” for VM Image Import

**Specification:** A system to dynamically generate OS profiles from imported VM images, then use these profiles to “ghost” or selectively remove client-specific data *before* the image is provided to a client, creating a base image ready for personalization.

**Core Concept:** Instead of just modifying configuration files, we’ll deeply analyze the imported VM image to build a comprehensive OS profile, detailing installed applications, common configuration patterns, and even typical user data locations. This profile isn’t just for identification – it’s used to intelligently scrub client-specific data *without* breaking the OS.

**System Components:**

1.  **Image Intake Module:** Receives the VM image (as per the existing patent).
2.  **Deep Analysis Engine:**  This is the core new component. It performs:
    *   **Application Inventory:** Scans for installed applications via registry keys, package managers (apt, yum, etc.), and common installation directories.
    *   **Configuration Mapping:** Identifies key configuration files and their associated application settings.  Focuses on identifying *default* values versus user-modified values.
    *   **Data Signature Analysis:** Identifies common user data locations (Documents, Pictures, etc.) and analyzes the *type* of data stored there – looking for patterns indicative of personal data (document types, image metadata, etc.).  This *doesn’t* require reading the contents, but rather analyzing file extensions, sizes, and creation dates.
3.  **OS Profile Builder:** Consolidates the output of the Deep Analysis Engine into a structured OS Profile. This profile includes:
    *   Application List (with versions).
    *   Configuration Defaults (for each application).
    *   Data Signature Definitions (defining common personal data patterns).
4.  **“Ghosting” Engine:**  Takes the VM image and the OS Profile and performs the following:
    *   **Data Scrubbing:**  Identifies and removes data matching the Data Signature Definitions.  This *isn’t* a simple delete – it’s a replacement with generic placeholder files or empty directories.
    *   **Configuration Reset:** Resets application configurations to the defined defaults from the OS Profile.
    *   **User Account Neutralization:** Creates a new, generic user account and removes any client-specific user accounts.
5.  **Image Delivery Module:** Delivers the “ghosted” VM image to the client.

**Pseudocode (Ghosting Engine):**

```
function GhostImage(image, osProfile):
  for each directory in image:
    for each file in directory:
      if file matches signature in osProfile.DataSignatures:
        replaceFileWithPlaceholder(file)
  for each application in osProfile.Applications:
    resetConfigToDefault(application, image)
  removeClientUserAccounts(image)
  createDefaultUserAccount(image)
  return image
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems primarily focus on OS identification and basic configuration modifications. This system *deeply analyzes* the image to understand the OS and user patterns, allowing for intelligent data scrubbing and configuration reset. This ensures a clean, generic base image ready for personalization.  It moves beyond simply removing data to *understanding* what constitutes client-specific data and acting accordingly.
