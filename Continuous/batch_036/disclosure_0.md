## Adaptive Morphing Wing Surfaces – Bio-Inspired Control

**Concept:** Implement dynamically morphing wing surfaces using embedded shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators and a bio-inspired feather-like segmented surface. This allows for real-time adjustments to wing camber, surface area, and even the creation of localized vortex generators, exceeding the capabilities of traditional flaps or control surfaces.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Wing Surface Segmentation:**
    *   Divide each wing (front, rear x2) into overlapping, segmented panels – mimicking bird feathers.
    *   Each segment (approx. 5cm x 10cm) constructed from a lightweight composite material (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) with integrated SMA wire mesh.
    *   Overlapping arrangement (approx. 20% overlap) allows for smooth surface transition despite individual segment movement.
    *   Segment attachment utilizes a flexible, yet durable polymer 'hinge' allowing for controlled articulation.

2.  **SMA Actuator Network:**
    *   Each segment contains a bidirectional SMA wire mesh embedded within the composite structure.
    *   SMA wires oriented along both primary axes of the segment.
    *   Electrical current controls SMA wire contraction/expansion, inducing segment curvature.
    *   Precise current control allows for independent control of each segment’s angle of attack and camber.

3.  **Control System:**
    *   Onboard microcontroller (STM32 series) manages SMA actuator network.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) & GPS provide flight data.
    *   Aerodynamic sensors (pressure sensors embedded in wing surface) provide real-time airflow data.
    *   Control algorithm utilizes a neural network trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to optimize wing shape for current flight conditions (speed, altitude, wind).
    *   Algorithm prioritizes energy efficiency and maneuverability based on pre-defined flight profiles or user input.

4.  **Power Supply:**
    *   High-density lithium polymer battery pack integrated into central frame.
    *   Power management system distributes power to actuators, sensors, and control system.
    *   Regenerative braking system captures energy during descent and deceleration to extend flight time.

5.  **Software/Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Main Control Loop
while (true) {
  // Read sensor data
  IMUData = ReadIMU();
  GPSData = ReadGPS();
  WingPressureData = ReadWingPressureSensors();

  // Calculate desired wing shape based on flight conditions and neural network output
  DesiredWingShape = NeuralNetwork.Predict(IMUData, GPSData, WingPressureData);

  // Calculate actuator commands for each segment
  for (each segment in WingSegments) {
    ActuatorCommand = CalculateActuatorCommand(segment, DesiredWingShape);
    SendActuatorCommand(segment, ActuatorCommand);
  }
  // Check battery level and adjust flight profile accordingly
  BatteryLevel = ReadBatteryLevel();
  if (BatteryLevel < 20%) {
    EngagePowerSavingMode();
  }
}
```

6.  **Materials:**
    *   Wing Segments: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer
    *   Hinges: Flexible Polyurethane
    *   Actuators: Nickel-Titanium Shape Memory Alloy
    *   Frame: Lightweight Aluminum Alloy

7.  **Integration with Existing Design:**
    *   Replace existing fixed wings with segmented morphing wings.
    *   Integrate the control system and power supply into the existing central frame.
    *   Modify existing lifting and thrusting motor control algorithms to account for morphing wing effects.
