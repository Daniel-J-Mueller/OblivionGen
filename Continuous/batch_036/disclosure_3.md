## Adaptive Texture Synthesis with Procedural Detail Injection

**Concept:** Extend the reference-based texture replacement concept by dynamically synthesizing textures *between* reference frames, injecting procedural detail to enhance realism and reduce reliance on pre-existing reference images. This moves beyond simple replacement towards *creation* of visual content.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Input Stream Processor:** Receives the primary video stream.
*   **Reference Stream Processor:** Manages the lower-frame-rate, high-quality reference stream.
*   **Feature Extraction Module:** Extracts key visual features (normals, albedo, roughness, etc.) from both input and reference frames.  Utilize a multi-scale approach.
*   **Procedural Detail Generator:** A suite of procedural algorithms capable of generating realistic micro-details – scratches, dust, imperfections, surface variations – parameterized by surface properties (roughness, material type).  This will employ noise functions (Perlin, Simplex, Worley) and fractal algorithms.
*   **Texture Synthesis Engine:**  Core component - blends reference textures with procedural details, using the extracted features as guidance. Implements a diffusion-based approach for seamless blending and detail injection.
*   **Temporal Coherence Module:** Ensures that synthesized textures maintain consistency between frames, minimizing flickering or jarring transitions.  Utilizes optical flow analysis to track surface movement.
*   **Output Frame Generator:** Combines the synthesized texture with other visual effects (lighting, shadows) to create the final enhanced frame.

**2. Algorithm Flow:**

1.  **Feature Extraction:** For each input frame, extract visual features.
2.  **Reference Selection:** Identify the closest reference frame in time (or based on scene content analysis – rudimentary scene detection).
3.  **Feature Mapping:** Map features from the input frame to the selected reference frame. This may involve transformations and warping to account for camera movement or scene changes.
4.  **Procedural Detail Generation:** Based on the mapped features and material properties, generate procedural details. Parameterize the detail generation algorithms based on feature values (e.g., higher roughness values lead to more pronounced micro-details).
5.  **Texture Synthesis:**
    *   Initialize a new texture by blending the reference texture with a base color derived from the input frame.
    *   Iteratively apply the procedural details to the texture using a diffusion-based approach.  The diffusion process smooths out the details while preserving their overall shape and structure.  This will be a multi-pass operation.
    *   Control the blending between reference and procedural content using the feature map.
6.  **Temporal Smoothing:**  Apply a temporal filter to the synthesized texture to reduce flickering and ensure consistency between frames.  This filter will leverage optical flow information to warp the previous frame’s texture onto the current frame.
7.  **Output Generation:** Render the enhanced frame by applying lighting, shadows, and other visual effects.

**3. Pseudocode (Texture Synthesis Engine - Core Loop):**

```
function synthesizeTexture(inputFeatures, referenceTexture, proceduralParams):
  newTexture = blend(referenceTexture, inputFeatures.albedo)  // Initial blend
  
  for i in range(numDiffusionSteps):
    detailMap = generateDetailMap(proceduralParams) // Based on input features
    
    // Apply detail map using diffusion
    newTexture = diffuse(newTexture, detailMap, diffusionRate)
  
  return newTexture
```

**4. Data Structures:**

*   **Feature Map:** A multi-channel image representing visual features (normals, albedo, roughness, etc.).
*   **Detail Map:** A grayscale image representing the procedural details to be applied.
*   **Procedural Parameters:** A set of parameters controlling the procedural detail generation algorithms.

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Driven Parameter Optimization:** Use machine learning to optimize the procedural parameters based on the input video content and user preferences.
*   **Style Transfer:** Apply stylistic variations to the synthesized textures.
*   **Real-time Performance:** Optimize the algorithm for real-time performance on mobile devices.
*   **Integration with Neural Rendering:** Use neural rendering techniques to generate even more realistic and detailed textures.
