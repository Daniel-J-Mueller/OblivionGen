## Decentralized Key Rotation with Temporal Merkle Roots

**Concept:** Expand the Merkle tree-based key rotation to incorporate a time-sensitive element, creating a system where public keys are valid only within specific temporal windows. This enhances security by limiting the blast radius of compromised keys and enabling automated key revocation based on time.

**Specs:**

*   **Temporal Leaf Nodes:** In addition to standard leaf nodes representing signing keys and the initial public key, introduce ‘temporal leaf nodes.’ These nodes contain both a signing key *and* a validity timestamp range (start & end).
*   **Time-Weighted Hashing:**  Implement a hashing algorithm that incorporates the validity timestamp range into the Merkle node hash.  This means a slight change in the timestamp *completely* alters the node’s hash, ensuring temporal integrity.  Example: `Hash(signing_key + start_timestamp + end_timestamp)`.
*   **Rolling Root Commitment:** The Merkle root (public key) is not static. It's recalculated and ‘committed’ periodically (e.g., hourly, daily) based on currently valid temporal leaf nodes.  This produces a series of Merkle roots, each valid for a defined time window.
*   **Root Chain & Proof of Validity:** Maintain a ‘root chain’ – a chronological sequence of Merkle roots.  A signature verification process requires *both* the signature, and a ‘proof of validity’ demonstrating that the Merkle root used to verify the signature was indeed valid *at the time of signature creation*. This proof consists of the relevant root from the root chain *and* the Merkle path demonstrating its validity.
*   **Automated Key Revocation:** When a key's validity window expires, it is automatically removed from the Merkle tree during the next root recalculation. No manual revocation is needed.
*   **Threshold Signature with Temporal Constraints:** Extend the system to support threshold signatures. Each signing key's validity window is a factor in the overall signature validity. A signature is only valid if a sufficient number of keys within their validity windows participated.

**Pseudocode (Signature Verification):**

```
function verifySignature(signature, message, timestamp, merkleRoot, merklePath):
  // 1. Calculate the expected Merkle root from the message, signature, and key
  expectedRoot = calculateMerkleRoot(message, signature)

  // 2. Verify the Merkle Path against the provided Merkle Root
  if (verifyMerklePath(merklePath, expectedRoot)) {

    // 3. Check root validity for timestamp
    rootValidity = checkRootValidity(merkleRoot, timestamp)

    if(rootValidity){
        return TRUE // Signature is valid
    } else {
        return FALSE // Root is expired
    }

  } else {
    return FALSE // Merkle path verification failed
  }
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   Consider a blockchain-inspired data structure for the root chain to ensure immutability.
*   Optimize the time-weighted hashing algorithm for performance.
*   Implement robust error handling for invalid timestamps or expired roots.
*   Explore hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure key storage and hashing operations.
*   Investigate using verifiable delay functions (VDFs) to ensure tamper-proof timestamps.
