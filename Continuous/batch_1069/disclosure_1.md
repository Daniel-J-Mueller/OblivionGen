## Adaptive Metadata Prefetching with Predictive Slot Ownership

**Specification:** Implement a system that proactively prefetches metadata pages based on predicted access patterns *and* anticipated slot ownership transitions between LL and HT metadata servers. This differs from standard caching by focusing on *future* ownership, not just recent access.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Analyzer:** Monitors file system request streams to identify sequential reads/writes, random access patterns, and access locality. Operates on a per-file/directory basis.
*   **Ownership Prediction Engine:**  Utilizes a time-series model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) trained on historical mode conversion data (LL to HT, HT to LL). Input features include file system request rates, I/O patterns, and current mode. Outputs a probability distribution of future mode changes and associated server assignments.
*   **Prefetch Queue:** Prioritized queue containing metadata page requests. Priority is determined by:
    *   Access Pattern Analyzer score (higher score = higher priority).
    *   Ownership Prediction Engine probability (higher probability of needing the page on a specific server = higher priority).
    *   Distance from current server (pages likely needed on a remote server are prioritized).
*   **Metadata Prefetcher Daemon:** Runs on each metadata server (LL and HT).  Periodically polls the Prefetch Queue and initiates asynchronous metadata page fetches from storage.
*   **Slot ID Shadowing:** Each LL server maintains a “shadow copy” of the Slot ID information for files *potentially* migrating to HT mode, and vice-versa. This allows faster validation during mode transitions.

**Pseudocode (Metadata Prefetcher Daemon):**

```
loop:
  queue = PrefetchQueue.poll(timeout=5s)
  if queue is not empty:
    for page_request in queue:
      predicted_server = OwnershipPredictionEngine.get_predicted_server(page_request.file_id)
      if predicted_server == current_server:
        # Local server, fetch from cache or storage
        metadata_page = Cache.get(page_request.page_id)
        if metadata_page is None:
          metadata_page = Storage.fetch(page_request.page_id)
          Cache.put(page_request.page_id, metadata_page)
      else:
        # Remote server, initiate asynchronous fetch
        async_fetch(page_request.page_id, predicted_server)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PrefetchRequest`:  {file_id, page_id, priority}
*   `SlotIDShadow`:  {file_id, slot_id} (maintained by LL servers for potential HT migration)

**Novelty:**  Standard caching is reactive; this system proactively fetches metadata based on predicted *future* ownership and access patterns.  The slot ID shadowing component minimizes overhead during mode transitions. This focuses on *anticipating* changes, not just responding to them, optimizing performance during LL/HT switching.
