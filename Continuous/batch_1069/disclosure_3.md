**Adaptive Haptic Feedback System Integrated with Near-Field Sensing**

**Concept:** Expand the near-field sensing capability beyond positional tracking to provide localized haptic feedback directly on the display surface. This creates a more immersive and interactive user experience, especially for gaming, creative applications, and accessibility features.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Layer:** Utilize the existing optically transmissive sheet with diffraction patterns. Enhance this layer with micro-actuators – piezoelectric or electrostatic – embedded within or directly coupled to the diffraction elements. These actuators create localized deformation of the sheet, altering light diffraction and producing subtle surface textures perceivable by the user's touch.
*   **Actuator Density:** Minimum of 100 actuators per square inch, configurable via software. Variable density mapping possible based on application and user preferences.
*   **Light Modulation:** Actuators precisely manipulate the diffraction pattern, creating localized changes in light intensity and diffusion. This can simulate edges, textures, or even subtle movements under the user’s finger.
*   **Feedback Modes:**
    *   *Texture Simulation:*  Create the sensation of touching different materials (wood, metal, fabric) by modulating light diffraction to mimic surface imperfections.
    *   *Edge Enhancement:*  Sharpen the perceived edges of virtual objects for improved precision in drawing, gaming, or map navigation.
    *   *Force Feedback:* (Limited) Simulate slight resistance or 'bumps' by rapidly modulating actuator height and light diffraction.
    *   *Directional Cues:* Use actuator arrays to create localized 'pressure' gradients indicating the direction of movement or interaction.
*   **Integration with Camera System:** Combine near-field sensor data with camera tracking to predict user intent and preemptively activate haptic feedback.
*   **Software API:**
    *   *Haptic Primitives:* A library of pre-defined haptic effects (e.g., “rough,” “smooth,” “click,” “vibrate”).
    *   *Custom Haptic Profiles:* Allow developers to create and load custom haptic textures and effects.
    *   *Real-time Haptic Rendering:* Enable dynamic haptic feedback based on user input and application state.
*   **Power Management:** Low-power actuator control to minimize battery drain. Implement adaptive power scaling based on haptic effect complexity.
*   **Materials:** Optically clear polymer base with embedded micro-actuators. Durable and scratch-resistant coating.
*   **Pseudocode Example (Texture Simulation):**

```
function generateHapticTexture(textureData, positionX, positionY):
    for each pixel in textureData:
        intensity = pixel.intensity
        //Convert pixel intensity to actuator height adjustment
        actuatorHeight = map(intensity, 0, 255, 0, maxActuatorHeight)
        //Activate actuators at positionX, positionY with adjusted height
        setActuatorHeight(positionX, positionY, actuatorHeight)
```
