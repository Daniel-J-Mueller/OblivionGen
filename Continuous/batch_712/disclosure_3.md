## Dynamic Versioning Granularity & Temporal Queries

**Specification:** Implement a system allowing versioning to be applied not just to objects or containers, but to *specific data fields within objects*. Furthermore, introduce a temporal query language that allows retrieval of object states *as they existed at a specific point in time*, including reconstruction of field values.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on toggling versioning on/off. This expands beyond that binary state to offer *selective* versioning â€“ versioning only the critical fields of an object, reducing storage overhead and improving performance. The temporal query language takes this further by allowing analysis of data evolution, not just access to past versions.

**Components:**

*   **Field-Level Versioning Metadata:** Each object will have associated metadata indicating which fields are versioned. This metadata will be stored alongside the object data.
*   **Differential Storage:** When a versioned field is modified, only the *difference* between the old and new values will be stored, minimizing storage space.  A configurable compression algorithm will handle these deltas.
*   **Temporal Index:**  A specialized index structure (e.g., a modified B-tree or a time-series database) will track the changes to each versioned field over time.  This index will map timestamps to field values.
*   **Query Parser & Engine:** A new query language extension will be added to parse temporal queries. The query engine will use the temporal index to retrieve the appropriate field values for the specified timestamp.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Query):**

```
//Temporal Query Language Extension
query(object_id, timestamp, field1, field2, ...);

//Example Query:
//Retrieve the 'price' and 'quantity' fields of object '123' as they existed on '2024-10-27 10:00:00'
query("123", "2024-10-27 10:00:00", "price", "quantity");

//Internal Query Processing:

function processTemporalQuery(objectId, timestamp, fields):
  //1. Fetch Temporal Index for objectId
  temporalIndex = fetchTemporalIndex(objectId);

  //2. For each requested field:
  for field in fields:
    //3. Lookup field value in temporal index at specified timestamp
    value = temporalIndex.getValue(field, timestamp);

    //4. If value not found, return the most recent known value (or a default)

  //5. Return reconstructed object with requested fields at specified time
  return reconstructedObject;
```

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   **Data Format:** Support various data types for versioned fields (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.).
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a strategy for handling concurrent modifications to versioned fields.
*   **Scalability:** Design the temporal index to handle large volumes of data and high query loads.
*   **API Integration:** Provide a clear API for enabling/disabling field-level versioning and executing temporal queries.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Data Lineage Tracking:** Extend the system to track the origin and transformation of data over time.
*   **Auditing & Compliance:**  Use the temporal data to meet auditing and compliance requirements.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** Analyze historical data to predict future trends.
