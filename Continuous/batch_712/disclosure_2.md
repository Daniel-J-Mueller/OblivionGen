## Dynamic Content Provenance & Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the feedback mechanism to not just identify *malicious* content sources, but to build a dynamic provenance and reputation scoring system for *all* supplemental content – ads, embedded videos, linked resources, etc. – based on user interaction *beyond* just reporting problems. This creates a continuously updated “trust web” for content.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Collection Layer – Enhanced User Agent:**

*   **Function:** Modify user agent code to passively collect interaction metrics for all supplemental content loaded during a browsing session.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Load Time:** Time taken to load the content.
    *   **Resource Usage:** CPU/Memory consumption during loading/playback.
    *   **User Engagement:** (Where appropriate) Time spent viewing video, clicks on links, mouse movements over ad banners, completion of forms.
    *   **User Actions:** (Explicit) User reports (as in the original patent), “helpful”/“not helpful” ratings, “block this source” actions.
    *   **Content Attributes:**  Extracted metadata (e.g., ad category, video length, linked website topic).
*   **Data Transmission:** Data aggregated and transmitted periodically (configurable interval) to a central scoring engine.  Minimize data transmitted for privacy (consider differential privacy techniques).  Data should be anonymized/pseudonymized.

**2. Scoring Engine – Bayesian Network & Reputation Calculation:**

*   **Model:** Implement a Bayesian Network to model the relationship between content attributes, interaction metrics, and a “reputation score.”
*   **Parameters:**
    *   **Prior Probabilities:**  Initial reputation scores assigned based on known content provider reputation (e.g., using existing blocklists/whitelists).
    *   **Conditional Probabilities:** Learned from historical data (interaction metrics).  These probabilities represent the likelihood of a particular interaction metric given a certain reputation score.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Reputation scores updated in real-time based on incoming interaction data.
*   **Scoring Formula:**
    *   `Reputation(Content Source, Time) = PriorReputation + Σ (Weight_i * Influence(Metric_i, Time))`
    *   `Weight_i`: Importance assigned to each metric (configurable).
    *   `Influence(Metric_i, Time)`: Change in reputation score based on the value of Metric_i at Time.  (e.g. High load time decreases reputation. Positive user engagement increases reputation.)
*   **Decay Mechanism:** Implement a decay factor to reduce the influence of older data.

**3. Content Delivery Integration:**

*   **Filtering:** Integrate the scoring engine with content delivery mechanisms (e.g., ad servers, CDN).
*   **Thresholds:** Configure thresholds for reputation scores.  Content sources falling below a certain threshold are automatically blocked or served with a warning message.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Allow for A/B testing of different threshold values to optimize user experience and security.
*   **Client-Side Override:** Allow the user to manually override the system's recommendations (e.g., whitelist a specific content source).

**4. Data Visualization & Reporting:**

*   **Dashboard:** Provide a dashboard for monitoring content source reputation scores.
*   **Trend Analysis:**  Display trends in reputation scores over time.
*   **Alerting:**  Generate alerts when content source reputation scores fall below a certain threshold.

**Pseudocode (Scoring Engine - simplified):**

```
function calculateReputation(contentSource, metrics) {
  priorReputation = getContentSourcePrior(contentSource);
  reputation = priorReputation;

  //Example - adjust weights as appropriate
  loadTimeWeight = -0.2;
  engagementWeight = 0.5;

  reputation += loadTimeWeight * metrics.loadTime;
  reputation += engagementWeight * metrics.userEngagement;

  //Apply decay factor
  reputation = reputation * decayFactor;

  return reputation;
}
```
