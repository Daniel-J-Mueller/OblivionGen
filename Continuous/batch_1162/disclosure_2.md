## Dynamic Shard Allocation Based on Predictive Load

**Concept:** Extend the queue distribution logic to *predictively* allocate shards (queue servers) based not just on current load, but anticipated message volume *per strict order parameter*. This moves beyond reactive rebalancing to proactive optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Load Balancer (PLB) – a service operating alongside the existing queue system.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Real-time queue server load metrics (CPU, memory, I/O).
    *   Historical message arrival rates *segmented by strict order parameter*. (e.g., OrderParamA: 1000 msg/sec, OrderParamB: 50 msg/sec).
    *   External event data (if applicable) – e.g., scheduled campaigns, known peak hours.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Time Series Forecasting:** PLB uses time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) on historical message rates per strict order parameter. Generate short-term (5-15 minute) and medium-term (1-24 hour) predictions.
    2.  **Resource Estimation:** For each strict order parameter, estimate the required resources (CPU, memory, I/O) based on predicted message volume.  Model resource usage per message (can be dynamically adjusted based on message size/complexity).
    3.  **Shard Allocation:** Based on resource estimates, dynamically allocate shards to strict order parameters. A mapping is maintained: {OrderParamA: [Shard1, Shard2], OrderParamB: [Shard3]}.
    4.  **Proactive Shard Migration:** If predicted load on a shard exceeds capacity, proactively migrate strict order parameters to underutilized shards *before* congestion occurs. Migration must maintain strict ordering guarantees.
    5.  **Dynamic Mapping Adjustment:** Continuously monitor actual load vs. predicted load. Adjust the mapping and shard allocation accordingly. Implement a feedback loop to improve forecasting accuracy.

*   **Communication Protocol:**  PLB communicates with the existing queue system via a gRPC or similar API. Commands include:
    *   `AllocateShards(orderParam, shardList)`: Assigns shards to an order parameter.
    *   `MigrateOrderParam(orderParam, sourceShard, destinationShard)`: Initiates a shard migration.
    *   `GetLoadMetrics(shardList)`: Retrieves load metrics for a list of shards.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `OrderParamForecast`: {orderParam: String, forecast: TimeSeriesData}
    *   `ShardAllocation`: {orderParam: String, shards: List<ShardID>}
*   **Pseudocode (Migration):**

```
function MigrateOrderParam(orderParam, sourceShard, destinationShard):
    // 1. Pause incoming messages for orderParam on sourceShard
    pause_messages(sourceShard, orderParam)

    // 2. Copy message backlog for orderParam from sourceShard to destinationShard
    copy_backlog(sourceShard, destinationShard, orderParam)

    // 3. Update ShardAllocation mapping to point orderParam to destinationShard
    update_mapping(orderParam, destinationShard)

    // 4. Resume message processing on destinationShard
    resume_messages(destinationShard, orderParam)

    // 5. Drain and decommission sourceShard for orderParam (optional)
    drain_and_decommission(sourceShard, orderParam)
```

*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and rollback mechanisms for failed migrations. Logging and monitoring are crucial for debugging and performance analysis.

This system aims to shift from a reactive load balancing approach to a proactive, predictive one, improving queue throughput, reducing latency, and optimizing resource utilization. It builds upon the strict order parameter concept by leveraging that parameter for more intelligent shard allocation.
