## Dynamic Application "Auras" & Predictive Input

**Concept:** Extend the multi-application input recognition to incorporate visual and haptic "auras" around active applications, combined with predictive input filtering based on application state & user behavior.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Extended RGB Camera Array:** A wider field-of-view RGB camera array (minimum 3 cameras, optimally 5) to achieve accurate spatial mapping of the user’s hands, head, and the display area. Supports depth sensing for rudimentary gesture tracking.
*   **Haptic Feedback Array:** A series of micro-actuators embedded in the device bezel and/or a wearable wristband, capable of delivering localized, low-intensity haptic feedback.
*   **Ambient Light Sensor:** High-precision sensor to dynamically adjust aura intensity.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Aura Rendering Engine:**  Software module responsible for generating and displaying dynamic visual "auras" around each active application window.
    *   **Aura Shape:** Customizable aura shapes – circles, polygons, flowing lines.
    *   **Aura Color:** Application-specific or user-defined aura colors.  Color intensity is proportional to application activity (CPU/GPU usage, network traffic).
    *   **Aura Animation:**  Subtle animations within the aura to indicate application state (e.g., pulsing for active processing, shimmering for incoming notifications).
*   **Haptic Driver:**  Software module to control the haptic feedback array.
    *   **Haptic Mapping:** Associate specific haptic patterns with application types or states (e.g., short pulse for notification, sustained vibration for ongoing operation).
    *   **Proximity-Based Haptics:**  Increase haptic intensity as the user’s hand approaches an application’s aura.
*   **Predictive Input Filter (PIF):**  AI-powered module that anticipates user input based on application state and historical behavior.
    *   **State Vectors:**  Each application maintains a state vector representing its current mode, data being processed, and UI elements being displayed.
    *   **Behavioral Models:**  The PIF learns the user’s typical interaction patterns with each application.
    *   **Confidence Scoring:**  Assigns a confidence score to each potential input based on the application’s state vector, the user’s behavioral model, and current sensor data (hand position, gaze direction, etc.).
    *   **Input Prioritization:**  Prioritizes input based on confidence score.  Low-confidence input is either ignored or presented as a suggestion.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Application State Tracking:** The system continuously monitors the state of all active applications.
2.  **Aura & Haptic Generation:** Based on application state, the Aura Rendering Engine generates visual auras and the Haptic Driver activates haptic feedback.
3.  **User Input Capture:**  The system captures user input from various sources (voice, gestures, mouse, keyboard).
4.  **PIF Analysis:** The Predictive Input Filter analyzes the captured input in conjunction with the application’s state and user behavior.
5.  **Input Prioritization & Filtering:** The PIF prioritizes and filters the input, discarding low-confidence or irrelevant input.
6.  **Command Execution:** The prioritized input is sent to the appropriate application for execution.

**Pseudocode (PIF):**

```
function processInput(input, applicationState, userBehaviorModel):
    confidenceScore = calculateConfidenceScore(input, applicationState, userBehaviorModel)
    if confidenceScore > threshold:
        return input // Accept input
    else:
        // Suggest input or ignore
        displaySuggestion(input) // Optional
        return null
```

**Novelty:** The combination of dynamic, interactive auras with an AI-powered predictive input filter creates a more intuitive and efficient multitasking experience. The system anticipates user needs and filters out irrelevant input, reducing cognitive load and improving productivity.  Focus shifts from *recognizing* input to *anticipating* intent.
