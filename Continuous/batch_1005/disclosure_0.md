## Adaptive Predictive Batching for Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** The core idea is to move beyond fixed-size data portions for anomaly detection and instead dynamically batch data based on *predictive entropy*. This allows for more efficient processing, especially in scenarios with variable data rates and complex patterns. Instead of processing fixed time windows, the system learns to identify "natural" breaks in data complexity, grouping data until a predictive model reaches a certain confidence threshold, then triggering anomaly detection.

**Specs:**

*   **Predictive Model:** A lightweight, rapidly trainable model (e.g., a shallow neural network or decision tree) responsible for predicting the next data point in the time series. This isn't the anomaly *detection* model, but a predictive model used to determine batch boundaries.
*   **Entropy Metric:** The predictive model calculates an entropy score for each potential batch. Higher entropy indicates greater unpredictability and suggests a natural boundary for the batch.
*   **Adaptive Batching Algorithm:**
    1.  Start with an empty batch.
    2.  Receive a new data point.
    3.  Add the data point to the current batch.
    4.  Retrain the predictive model on the current batch.
    5.  Calculate the entropy of the predictive model on the current batch.
    6.  If the entropy exceeds a predefined threshold *or* the batch reaches a maximum size, trigger anomaly detection on the batch and reset the batch to empty.
    7.  Repeat steps 2-6.
*   **Anomaly Detection Integration:** The existing anomaly detection model (from the provided patent) is applied to the adaptively batched data.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The entropy threshold is dynamically adjusted based on the overall data stream characteristics. A control loop monitors the average batch size and adjusts the threshold to maintain a desired batch size distribution.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Multiple adaptive batching streams can run in parallel, processing different data sources or different segments of the same data source.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Global Parameters
entropy_threshold = initial_threshold
max_batch_size = 1000
learning_rate = 0.01

// Initialize Predictive Model (e.g., shallow neural network)

while true:
    data_point = receive_data_point()
    current_batch.append(data_point)

    retrain_predictive_model(current_batch, learning_rate)
    entropy = calculate_entropy(predictive_model, current_batch)

    if entropy > entropy_threshold or len(current_batch) > max_batch_size:
        // Trigger Anomaly Detection Workflow
        detect_anomalies(current_batch)

        // Reset Batch
        current_batch = []

    // Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (example - simplified)
    average_batch_size = calculate_average_batch_size()
    if average_batch_size > target_batch_size:
        entropy_threshold *= 0.95  // Lower threshold
    elif average_batch_size < target_batch_size:
        entropy_threshold *= 1.05  // Raise threshold
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Efficiency:** By adapting to data complexity, the system avoids unnecessary processing of homogeneous data segments and focuses on areas where anomalies are more likely to occur.
*   **Enhanced Accuracy:**  Adaptive batching can capture more meaningful patterns in the data, leading to more accurate anomaly detection.
*   **Scalability:** Parallel processing of multiple adaptive batching streams enables the system to handle large volumes of data.
*   **Reduced Latency:**  Processing data in smaller, more relevant batches can reduce the time it takes to detect anomalies.
