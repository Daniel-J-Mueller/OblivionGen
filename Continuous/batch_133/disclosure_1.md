## Modular Data Center Cooling & Power ‘Pods’

**Concept:** Develop self-contained, modular ‘pods’ integrating ATS functionality *with* direct-to-chip liquid cooling, power conversion, and monitoring, designed for rapid deployment and scalability within data centers. These pods bypass traditional overhead power distribution and cooling infrastructure, significantly reducing capital expenditure and improving power usage effectiveness (PUE).

**Pod Specifications:**

*   **Dimensions:** 19” rack compatible (42U height, variable width – 24”, 36”, 48” options).
*   **Cooling:** Direct-to-chip liquid cooling manifolds integrated within the pod structure. Supports various liquid cooling technologies (single-phase, two-phase, dielectric fluids). Closed-loop system with integrated pump, reservoir, and heat exchanger. Capable of removing up to 100kW of heat per pod.
*   **Power:**
    *   Dual redundant ATS modules (similar principle to the patent, but integrated *within* the pod). Accepts dual power feeds.
    *   Integrated DC-DC converters (high efficiency >97%) to convert incoming power to voltages required by server components (e.g., 48V, 12V).
    *   Total power capacity: 20kW - 40kW per pod (scalable).
    *   Power factor correction (PFC) to minimize harmonic distortion.
*   **Networking/Monitoring:**
    *   Integrated BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) for remote monitoring and control.
    *   Real-time monitoring of power consumption, temperature, flow rates, and other critical parameters.
    *   Secure remote access and management via a dedicated API.
    *   Integration with existing data center infrastructure management (DCIM) systems.
*   **Physical Construction:**
    *   Lightweight aluminum chassis for structural rigidity and heat dissipation.
    *   Modular design for easy maintenance and upgrades.
    *   Sealed enclosure to prevent contamination and improve reliability.
    *   Integrated cable management system.
    *   Front and rear access panels for easy installation and servicing.

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Pod Initialization
ON POD_POWER_ON:
    INITIALIZE ATS MODULES
    INITIALIZE DC-DC CONVERTERS
    INITIALIZE COOLING SYSTEM
    ESTABLISH NETWORK CONNECTION
    REPORT STATUS TO DCIM

// Power Management
ON POWER_FEED_A_LOST:
    SWITCH TO POWER_FEED_B
    REPORT POWER_FAILURE
ON POWER_FEED_B_LOST:
    INITIATE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN
    REPORT CRITICAL_FAILURE

// Cooling Management
ON SERVER_TEMPERATURE > THRESHOLD:
    INCREASE PUMP SPEED
    INCREASE COOLANT FLOW RATE
    REPORT TEMPERATURE_WARNING

// Monitoring
LOOP:
    READ SERVER_TEMPERATURE
    READ POWER_CONSUMPTION
    READ COOLANT_FLOW_RATE
    READ POWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE
    TRANSMIT DATA TO DCIM
ENDLOOP
```

**Deployment Strategy:**

Pods are deployed in rows adjacent to server racks. Liquid cooling lines are connected directly to server CPUs, GPUs, and other heat-generating components. Power cables are connected directly to server power supplies. Pods are interconnected via a redundant network.

**Scalability:**

Additional pods can be added as needed to scale capacity. Pods can be combined to create larger cooling and power blocks.

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced capital expenditure (CAPEX)
*   Improved power usage effectiveness (PUE)
*   Increased density
*   Simplified deployment
*   Enhanced reliability
*   Scalability
*   Reduced cooling infrastructure costs
