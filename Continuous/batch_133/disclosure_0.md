## Dynamic Spectrum Allocation via Mesh Negotiation

**Concept:** A system where mesh nodes actively negotiate and bid for radio spectrum slices, optimizing for local congestion and data throughput. This goes beyond simply selecting the least congested channel, and introduces a dynamic allocation system influenced by real-time bidding and node ‘reputation’.

**Specifications:**

*   **Node Classification:** Each mesh node maintains a ‘reputation’ score. This isn’t simply uptime or bandwidth, but a calculated metric reflecting historical data transmission success rates *and* adherence to negotiated spectrum agreements. Nodes that consistently deliver reliable data and honor agreements gain higher reputation.
*   **Spectrum Slicing:** The available frequency spectrum is divided into multiple slices (e.g., 20MHz slices). These slices are not statically assigned.
*   **Auction Protocol:** When a node needs to transmit data, it initiates a localized auction. The node broadcasts a ‘request for spectrum’ message containing:
    *   Data size
    *   Desired Quality of Service (QoS) – priority, latency requirements
    *   Maximum bid (expressed as a temporary reputation cost – nodes ‘spend’ reputation to secure bandwidth).
*   **Bid Evaluation:** Neighboring nodes evaluate the request and submit bids. Bids consist of:
    *   Available bandwidth in their current slice.
    *   Bid price (reputation cost) – nodes offer bandwidth for a temporary reputation gain.
    *   Potential interference impact (calculated based on distance, obstacles, and current channel usage).
*   **Auction Winner Determination:** The requesting node selects the winning bid based on a weighted score:
    *   Bandwidth availability (highest weight)
    *   Bid price (lower weight - incentivizes competition)
    *   Interference impact (lowest weight – encourages efficient use)
*   **Temporary Spectrum Lease:** The winning node gains temporary access to the selected spectrum slice for the duration of the transmission. A ‘spectrum lease’ record is created and distributed to all neighboring nodes, indicating the temporary allocation.
*   **Reputation Adjustment:**
    *   The requesting node’s reputation is temporarily reduced by the bid amount.
    *   The winning node’s reputation is temporarily increased by the bid amount.
    *   If a node fails to deliver on its promised bandwidth (due to interference or other issues), its reputation is negatively impacted.
*   **Distributed Ledger:** A lightweight distributed ledger (potentially using a Directed Acyclic Graph – DAG) stores spectrum lease records and reputation adjustments. This ensures transparency and prevents disputes.
*   **Adaptive Slice Width:** The width of spectrum slices is not fixed. The system dynamically adjusts slice widths based on demand and available spectrum. Wider slices are used for high-bandwidth applications, while narrower slices are used for low-bandwidth applications.

**Pseudocode (Auction Process - Requesting Node):**

```
function initiate_auction(data_size, qos_requirements, max_bid):
  broadcast("REQUEST_SPECTRUM", data_size, qos_requirements, max_bid)
  received_bids = listen_for_bids()
  best_bid = null
  best_score = -1

  for each bid in received_bids:
    score = calculate_bid_score(bid)  // Based on bandwidth, price, interference
    if score > best_score:
      best_score = score
      best_bid = bid

  if best_bid != null:
    allocate_spectrum(best_bid)
    update_reputation(best_bid) // Pay the bid amount
    transmit_data()
  else:
    // No bids received - attempt retransmission or backoff
    retransmit_data()
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Powered Bidding:**  Nodes could use machine learning to predict optimal bid prices based on historical data and network conditions.
*   **Reputation-Based Prioritization:** Nodes with higher reputations could receive preferential treatment in the auction process.
*   **Spectrum Pooling:** Nodes could collaborate to pool their spectrum resources and offer larger bandwidth slices.
