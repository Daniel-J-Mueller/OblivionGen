## Dynamic Environmental Mapping via Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Create a real-time, dynamic environmental map layered with object identification and predicted trajectories, leveraging the wireless device identification from the patent as a core data point, but augmenting it with ambient audio analysis and low-resolution thermal imaging.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Distributed network of A/V devices (cameras with microphones, optionally with low-resolution thermal sensors) – existing security cameras, modified smartphones, custom-built nodes.
    *   Edge computing devices (Raspberry Pi-class) attached to each A/V device for pre-processing.
    *   Central server with GPU cluster for map compilation and prediction.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Data Acquisition Module:** Receives video, audio, and thermal data streams from A/V devices. Extracts wireless device identifiers (as per the patent) from the video data (using object detection). Extracts ambient audio features (keywords, sounds of distress, etc.).
    *   **Sensor Fusion Engine:** Combines video object detection data, audio analysis, and thermal signatures. Prioritizes data based on confidence levels. For example, a wireless device detected visually *and* aurally (e.g., a phone ringing) carries more weight. Thermal signatures detect heat sources (people, vehicles, running engines).
    *   **Dynamic Map Generator:** Creates a layered environmental map. Layers include:
        *   **Visual Layer:** Standard 2D/3D map representation from video feeds.
        *   **Wireless Device Layer:**  Displays location of identified wireless devices (updated in real-time).  Allows filtering by device type (phone, vehicle key fob, etc.).
        *   **Acoustic Layer:** Visualizes sound sources (e.g., gunshot detection, shouting, vehicle alarms). Uses heatmap-style visualization.
        *   **Thermal Layer:**  Displays thermal signatures overlaid on the visual layer.
    *   **Trajectory Prediction Module:**  Utilizes Kalman filtering and/or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict object trajectories based on historical data.  Accounts for environmental factors (obstacles, known pathways).
    *   **Alerting System:** Triggers alerts based on:
        *   Unexpected object behavior (e.g., rapid movement, entering restricted areas).
        *   Detection of anomalous sounds (e.g., gunfire, breaking glass).
        *   Presence of multiple wireless devices associated with known 'interest' profiles (e.g., known criminals).

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  A/V devices capture video, audio, and thermal data.
    2.  Edge computing devices perform initial processing (object detection, audio feature extraction, thermal signature analysis).
    3.  Processed data is transmitted to the central server.
    4.  Central server fuses data, generates the dynamic map, and performs trajectory prediction.
    5.  Alerts are triggered as needed.

*   **Pseudocode (Alert Trigger – Simplified):**

```
function triggerAlert(object, predictedTrajectory, environment) {
  if (object.isOfInterest()) {
    if (predictedTrajectory.intersectsWithRestrictedArea(environment)) {
      sendAlert("Object of interest entering restricted area");
    }
  }
  if (object.audioSignature.isAnomalous()) {
    sendAlert("Anomalous audio detected near object");
  }
  // Add more alert conditions as needed
}
```

*   **Potential Applications:** Security systems, search and rescue, smart cities, autonomous vehicle navigation, wildlife monitoring.
