**Adaptive Credential Swapping with Behavioral Biometrics**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Components:** Managed Directory Service (MDS), Identity Management Service (IMS), Behavioral Analysis Engine (BAE), Credential Swapper (CS).
*   **Data Inputs:** User credentials, access requests, user behavior data (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, application usage patterns), policy definitions.
*   **Data Outputs:** Temporary credentials, access grants/denials, risk scores, behavioral profiles.

**Innovation Description:**

The existing patent focuses on obtaining temporary credentials based on defined policies. This expands on that by introducing a dynamic credential adjustment system fueled by real-time behavioral biometrics. The goal is *proactive* security – anticipating and responding to anomalies *before* access is fully granted or while it is in progress.

1.  **Baseline Profiling:** During initial login/authentication, the BAE establishes a behavioral baseline for each user. This captures typical interaction patterns.

2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The BAE continuously monitors user behavior *after* initial authentication but *before* and *during* access to requested services.

3.  **Risk Scoring:** The BAE assigns a risk score based on deviations from the established baseline. Significant deviations trigger alerts and/or automatic credential adjustments.

4.  **Credential Swapping (CS):** This is the core innovation. Based on the risk score, the CS component *dynamically swaps* the user's temporary credentials with credentials providing different levels of access.
    *   **High Risk:** Swap for credentials granting *limited* access – read-only mode, access to non-critical data only.
    *   **Moderate Risk:** Swap for credentials with slightly restricted permissions.
    *   **Low Risk:** Maintain existing credentials or potentially *upgrade* them for increased functionality.

5.  **Adaptive Policy Enforcement:**  The MDS and IMS collaborate to define policies that govern the credential swapping process. These policies can be customized based on user roles, data sensitivity, and risk tolerance.

6.  **Feedback Loop:**  User activity and security events are fed back into the BAE to refine the behavioral models and improve the accuracy of risk assessments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
EstablishUserBaseline(UserID, BehaviorData)

// Access Request Handling
On AccessRequest(UserID, Service, Resource)
{
    RiskScore = BehavioralAnalysisEngine.CalculateRiskScore(UserID, CurrentBehaviorData);

    If (RiskScore > HighThreshold)
    {
        NewCredentials = GenerateLimitedAccessCredentials(UserID, Service, Resource);
        SwapCredentials(UserID, CurrentCredentials, NewCredentials);
        GrantAccess(UserID, Service, Resource, NewCredentials);
        LogSecurityEvent("High Risk Access Attempt - Credentials Swapped");
    }
    Else If (RiskScore > ModerateThreshold)
    {
        NewCredentials = GenerateRestrictedAccessCredentials(UserID, Service, Resource);
        SwapCredentials(UserID, CurrentCredentials, NewCredentials);
        GrantAccess(UserID, Service, Resource, NewCredentials);
        LogSecurityEvent("Moderate Risk Access Attempt - Credentials Swapped");
    }
    Else
    {
        GrantAccess(UserID, Service, Resource, CurrentCredentials);
    }
}

// Continuous Monitoring
On UserActivity(UserID, ActivityData)
{
    UpdateBehaviorData(UserID, ActivityData);
    RecalculateRiskScore(UserID);

    If (RiskScoreExceedsThreshold(RiskScore))
    {
        TriggerCredentialSwap();
    }
}
```
