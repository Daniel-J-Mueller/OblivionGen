## Adaptive Sparsity via Dynamic Inter-Layer Routing

**Concept:** Extend node removal to encompass *dynamic* routing of activations between layers, creating a sparse, adaptive network topology that shifts during inference. Rather than permanently removing nodes, activations are directed *around* less important nodes/layers based on input data characteristics. This allows the network to adjust its computational graph on the fly.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** "Routing Modules" inserted *between* each layer of the existing neural network. These modules don’t perform computation themselves; they dictate how activations flow.
*   **Routing Module Functionality:** Each module receives the activation vector from the previous layer. It calculates a “routing score” for each potential path (direct pass-through, or bypass via a dedicated ‘skip connection’ around a layer). The routing score is determined by a small, trainable sub-network (e.g., a 1-layer MLP) that analyzes the input activation vector.
*   **Skip Connections:** Dedicated connections are added between layers, allowing activations to bypass entire layers. These are initially weighted with zero, but become trainable during network training.
*   **Softmax Activation:** A softmax function is applied to the routing scores, producing a probability distribution over possible paths. The activation vector is then multiplied by this distribution, effectively weighting the different paths.
*   **Training Procedure:** The routing modules are trained *concurrently* with the main network weights. The loss function includes a sparsity penalty term that encourages the network to favor fewer, higher-probability paths.  L1 regularization on the skip connection weights will also promote sparsity.
*   **Inference Procedure:** During inference, the routing scores are calculated for each input. The network dynamically adjusts its topology based on these scores, directing activations along the most efficient paths.
*   **Hardware Implications**:  The routing modules introduce a small computational overhead, but the overall reduction in computations from skipping layers should outweigh this cost.  Specialized hardware could be developed to accelerate the routing score calculations.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Routing Module):**

```python
class RoutingModule:
    def __init__(self, input_size, skip_connection_size):
        self.routing_network = SimpleMLP(input_size, skip_connection_size) #Small NN to calc routing scores
        self.skip_connection_weight = 0.0 #Initialized to zero. Trainable
    
    def forward(self, activation_vector):
        routing_scores = self.routing_network(activation_vector)
        
        # Softmax to get probabilities
        probabilities = softmax(routing_scores)
        
        # Calculate weighted activation vector
        weighted_activation = probabilities * activation_vector
        
        # Apply skip connection
        skip_connection_output = self.skip_connection_weight * weighted_activation
        
        output = weighted_activation + skip_connection_output
        
        return output
```

**Innovation Refinement**:  Implement ‘attention’ mechanisms within the routing sub-network. The sub-network learns to focus on the most relevant features of the input activation vector when calculating routing scores, leading to more informed decisions about which paths to activate.
