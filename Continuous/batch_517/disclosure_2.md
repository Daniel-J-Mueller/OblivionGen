## Spectral Fingerprinting & Adaptive Calibration

**Concept:** Expand the calibration system to not just *measure* light intensity at specific wavelengths, but to create a complete “spectral fingerprint” of the ambient light source *during* calibration, then adapt the calibration profile accordingly. This addresses variations in light source color temperature and spectral distribution.

**Specs:**

1.  **Spectrometer Integration:** Integrate a miniature spectrometer *within* the opaque housing, positioned to receive light from the same port as the ambient light sensor under test. This spectrometer needs a resolution of at least 10nm to capture sufficient spectral detail.

2.  **Spectral Data Acquisition:**  During calibration, *before* emitting calibration light, the spectrometer captures a full spectral scan of the ambient light.  This data is stored as a reference profile.

3.  **Calibration Light Modification:** The existing multi-wavelength emitters are augmented with a tunable filter array.  This array allows the emitted light’s spectrum to be *adjusted* to closely match the ambient light’s spectral profile, as determined by the spectrometer. Pseudocode:
    ```
    FUNCTION AdjustCalibrationLight(AmbientSpectrum, TargetSpectrum)
    // Input: AmbientSpectrum - Spectral data from spectrometer
    //        TargetSpectrum - Desired calibration light spectrum
    // Output: Adjustment parameters for tunable filter array

    DeltaSpectrum = TargetSpectrum - AmbientSpectrum

    // Calculate filter array settings to minimize DeltaSpectrum
    FilterSettings = OptimizeFilterArray(DeltaSpectrum)

    RETURN FilterSettings
    END FUNCTION
    ```

4.  **Adaptive Calibration Algorithm:** The calibration algorithm now incorporates the ambient light spectral profile.  Instead of a fixed intensity calibration for each wavelength, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the calibration based on the spectral characteristics of the ambient light. Pseudocode:
    ```
    FUNCTION CalibrateSensor(SensorData, AmbientSpectrum, CalibrationLightSpectrum)
    // Input: SensorData - Raw sensor readings
    //        AmbientSpectrum - Spectral data from spectrometer
    //        CalibrationLightSpectrum - Spectrum of calibration light
    // Output: Calibrated sensor value

    // Calculate weighting factors based on spectral overlap
    WeightingFactors = CalculateSpectralWeighting(AmbientSpectrum, CalibrationLightSpectrum)

    // Apply weighted calibration values to sensor data
    CalibratedValue = Sum(SensorData * WeightingFactors * CalibrationValues)

    RETURN CalibratedValue
    END FUNCTION
    ```

5.  **Housing Modifications:**
    *   Add a small aperture to the opaque housing for the spectrometer’s optical input.
    *   Space for mounting the spectrometer and associated electronics.
    *   A heatsink for the spectrometer's sensor.

6.  **Software Integration:**
    *   Software to control the spectrometer and acquire spectral data.
    *   Software to implement the adaptive calibration algorithm.
    *   User interface to display the spectral profiles and calibration results.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved calibration accuracy in varying lighting conditions.
*   Reduced need for manual calibration adjustments.
*   Ability to calibrate sensors in real-world environments.
*   Potentially enables more accurate color sensing and image capture.
