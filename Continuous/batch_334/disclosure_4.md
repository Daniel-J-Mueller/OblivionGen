## Adaptive Bundle Prefetching based on User Interaction Prediction

**Specification:** A system that extends proactive bundle delivery by incorporating predicted user interaction data to prioritize content within bundles and dynamically adjust bundle composition *before* delivery. This differs from the patent by moving beyond purely caching parameters and versioning to anticipating *what* the user will likely interact with.

**Components:**

*   **Interaction Prediction Engine (IPE):**  A machine learning model residing on the server side, trained on aggregated, anonymized user interaction data (clicks, scrolls, dwell time, form submissions).  The IPE takes as input:
    *   Content Page URL
    *   User Agent/Device Type
    *   Time of Day/Week
    *   Geographic Location (coarse-grained)
    *   Prior User History (anonymized and aggregated)
    *   Current Session Data (mouse movements, scroll speed - limited, privacy focused)
    *   *Output:*  A ranked list of content elements (images, scripts, sections) *within* the content page with a probability score representing likely user interaction.

*   **Dynamic Bundle Generator (DBG):**  Resides on the server.
    *   Input: Content Page URL, IPE output (ranked content list), caching parameters.
    *   Process:
        1.  Retrieve all referenced content items for the page.
        2.  Apply caching parameters to initially filter items.
        3.  Sort remaining items based on IPE probability scores.
        4.  Select the top *N* items (configurable) for inclusion in the bundle. *N* can be dynamically adjusted based on estimated bundle size and network conditions.
        5.  Generate the bundle.

*   **Client-Side Bundle Handler (CSBH):** Modified browser module.
    *   Receives the dynamically generated bundle.
    *   Extracts and caches content as per the original patent.
    *   Maintains a “priority queue” of content based on the IPE-assigned scores (embedded in the bundle metadata).
    *   When the content page loads, the CSBH prioritizes rendering content from the high-priority queue *first*, even if it’s not in the immediate viewport. This creates the illusion of faster page loading and responsiveness.

**Pseudocode (DBG - Server Side):**

```
function generateDynamicBundle(pageURL, userContext):
  contentItems = retrieveContentItems(pageURL)
  filteredItems = applyCachingParameters(contentItems)
  interactionScores = InteractionPredictionEngine.predict(pageURL, userContext) // Returns a dictionary: {itemID: score}
  sortedItems = sortItemsByInteractionScore(filteredItems, interactionScores)
  bundleSizeLimit = calculateBundleSizeLimit(userContext.networkSpeed)
  selectedItems = takeTopNItems(sortedItems, bundleSizeLimit)
  bundle = createBundle(selectedItems)
  return bundle
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Bundles:** Utilize user-specific data (with appropriate privacy controls) to further refine the IPE model and generate highly personalized bundles.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate real-time contextual data (location, time, device type) into the IPE model.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Continuously A/B test different IPE models and bundle generation strategies to optimize performance.
*   **Bundle Splitting:**  For very large pages, split the bundle into multiple smaller bundles, delivered in parallel.
*   **Prefetching Beyond the Page:**  Predict likely navigation and proactively prefetch bundles for subsequent pages.
