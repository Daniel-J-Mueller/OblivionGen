## Adaptive Power Allocation via Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Expand the idea of proactively disconnecting failing subsystems to encompass *dynamic* power allocation based on predicted subsystem load, optimizing for both efficiency *and* preemptive failure mitigation. Instead of just reacting to faults, anticipate them and proactively shift power to critical functions.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Load Balancing (PLB) Module – Software running on the Supervisor Power Supply Controller.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time subsystem power draw (Voltage, Current).
    *   Subsystem operational state (active, standby, fault).
    *   Vehicle state data (flight mode, altitude, speed, sensor readings).
    *   Historical subsystem performance data (power consumption patterns, failure rates).
    *   Environmental data (temperature, humidity – potentially from external sensors).
*   **PLB Module Functionality:**
    1.  **Load Prediction:** Utilizing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on historical data and real-time inputs, the RNN predicts the power demand of each subsystem over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 5-30 seconds). The RNN architecture should include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to handle temporal dependencies.
    2.  **Criticality Assessment:** Assigns a criticality score to each subsystem based on vehicle state. For example:
        *   Navigation system: High criticality during landing, low during cruise.
        *   Sensor suite: Variable criticality based on flight mode & objectives.
        *   Non-essential systems (entertainment): Low criticality.
    3.  **Power Budget Management:** Maintains a dynamic power budget based on main power supply capacity (battery level, generator output).
    4.  **Proactive Power Shifting:**  If predicted total power demand exceeds the power budget, the PLB Module proactively shifts power *before* a fault occurs. This is done by:
        *   Reducing power to low-criticality subsystems.
        *   Temporarily suspending non-essential functions.
        *   Gradually reducing power to subsystems with predicted lower imminent need, based on their prediction curve.
        *   If necessary, pre-emptively isolating a subsystem *before* it reaches a critical failure point, based on a fault prediction algorithm.
    5.  **Adaptive Power Allocation Algorithm (Pseudocode):**
        ```
        function adaptivePowerAllocation(vehicleState, subsystemPredictions, currentPowerLevels, powerBudget)
        {
            predictedTotalDemand = sum(subsystemPredictions.powerDemand)

            if (predictedTotalDemand > powerBudget)
            {
                // Sort subsystems by criticality (highest to lowest)
                sortedSubsystems = sortSubsystemsByCriticality(vehicleState, subsystemPredictions)

                // Iterate through subsystems from lowest criticality to highest
                for each subsystem in sortedSubsystems
                {
                    reductionPotential = subsystem.currentPowerLevel * reductionFactor
                    newPowerLevel = subsystem.currentPowerLevel - reductionPotential

                    if (newPowerLevel >= minimumOperationalLevel)
                    {
                        adjustPowerLevel(subsystem, newPowerLevel)
                        powerBudget += reductionPotential
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        // Subsystem critical – skip power reduction
                    }

                    if(powerBudget >= predictedTotalDemand)
                        break
                }

                //If insufficient power still, begin preemptive isolation.
                if(powerBudget < predictedTotalDemand)
                    beginPreemptiveIsolation(highestPredictedLoadSubsystem)
            }
        }
        ```
*   **Communication Protocol:** A high-speed, bi-directional communication bus (e.g., CAN bus, Ethernet) connecting all power supply controllers and the Supervisor Power Supply Controller.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Redundant communication channels and fail-safe mechanisms to ensure continued operation in the event of communication failures.
*   **Data Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all power allocation decisions and subsystem performance data for post-flight analysis and model refinement.
