## Dynamic Inventory Projection & "Ghost Mode"

**Concept:** Leverage the time-based location awareness to *predict* inventory needs at the physical store based on user browsing habits *before* they even arrive, and create a "Ghost Mode" experience tailored to anticipated demand.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection:** Application passively tracks user searches, viewed items, and add-to-cart actions *while* in e-commerce mode. This data is associated with a user profile (with appropriate privacy controls).
*   **Demand Prediction:** A machine learning model (running server-side) analyzes this historical data *and* real-time browsing activity of users approaching a physical store (determined via the time/location triggering of the patent). This model predicts the likely demand for specific items *within* that store.
*   **Dynamic Inventory Adjustment (Server-Side):** Based on predictions, the system proactively communicates with store inventory management systems (via API). This isn't about physical restocking *immediately*, but about flagging anticipated shortages or high-demand items.  The system can also generate “soft blocks” – preventing online orders for items predicted to be out of stock *in-store* to avoid fulfillment complications.
*   **“Ghost Mode” UI/UX:**
    *   **Pre-Arrival Notification:** As the user approaches the store, the app displays a personalized notification: “Based on your interests, we’re expecting high demand for [Item A] and [Item B] at this location.  We’ve flagged them for our team!”
    *   **In-Store "Heat Map":** Once in "in-store mode", the app presents a visual "heat map" of the store (using a simplified floorplan) highlighting sections where anticipated high-demand items are located.  Items predicted to be low-stock are indicated with a different visual cue.
    *   **“Virtual Reserve” Option:** Allow users to "virtually reserve" a predicted-low-stock item for a short period (e.g., 15 minutes).  This triggers a notification to a store associate to prioritize locating the item.  (Requires integration with store associate mobile devices/systems).
    *   **“Find Alternate” Suggestions:** If a predicted-high-demand item is actually out of stock, the app proactively suggests similar items available in-store or offers to ship an alternative directly to the user.

**Pseudocode (Demand Prediction - Simplified):**

```
function predictDemand(userProfile, storeLocation, browsingHistory) {
  // 1. Feature Extraction:
  features = extractFeatures(userProfile, browsingHistory);  // e.g., preferred categories, brands, price range

  // 2. Historical Data Lookup:
  historicalData = queryDatabase(storeLocation, features); // Get past demand for similar items at that store

  // 3. Real-time Trend Analysis:
  realtimeTrends = analyzeRealtimeBrowsing(storeLocation, features); // What are others browsing *now*?

  // 4. Model Prediction:
  predictedDemand = machineLearningModel(historicalData, realtimeTrends, features); // Uses a trained model

  // 5. Return Predicted Demand
  return predictedDemand;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Server-side infrastructure for data processing, machine learning model training/hosting.
*   Integration with store inventory management systems (API).
*   Integration with store associate mobile devices/systems (optional – for “Virtual Reserve” feature).
*   Mobile app updates to support the new UI/UX features.
*   Robust data privacy and security measures.
