## Dynamic Interface Port Prioritization via Predictive Queue Length

**Concept:** Extend the existing congestion avoidance by *predicting* queue lengths *before* packets arrive, and dynamically prioritizing interface ports based on those predictions. This moves beyond reactive congestion avoidance to *proactive* congestion management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Modeling Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical queue length data for each interface port (sampled at high frequency - e.g., 1ms intervals).  Flow statistics (source/destination addresses, port numbers - as already collected). Time-of-day/day-of-week information.
*   **Process:**  Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network, ARIMA) *per interface port*.  Train the model to predict the queue length *t* milliseconds into the future (configurable *t*, initial value 50ms).  The model ingests historical data and current flow statistics.  Output: Predicted queue length for each interface port.
*   **Hardware:** Dedicated FPGA or accelerator card for model execution.  The model itself should be relatively small and optimized for low-latency inference.

**2. Dynamic Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted queue lengths (from Predictive Modeling Module). Current flow statistics.
*   **Process:**  Calculate a "priority score" for each interface port. Priority score =  (1 / Predicted Queue Length) * Weighting Factor. The Weighting Factor is a configurable parameter (initial value 1.0) allowing for adjustment of the sensitivity to queue length.
*   **Interface Port Allocation:**  Establish a sorted list of interface ports based on priority score (highest to lowest).  
    *   For each incoming packet:
        *   Hash the packet header to select an initial interface port (as in the existing patent).
        *   Check the priority score of the hashed interface port.
        *   If the priority score is below a threshold (configurable), select the next highest priority interface port in the sorted list.
        *   If all ports are below the threshold, revert to round-robin allocation.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Monitor actual queue lengths and adjust the priority score threshold dynamically.  If queue lengths consistently exceed a target value, lower the threshold. If queue lengths are consistently low, raise the threshold.

**3. Flow-Aware Learning:**

*   **Process:**  Categorize flows based on their impact on queue length (high-impact, medium-impact, low-impact).
*   **Learning:** Train a separate model (e.g., simple decision tree) to predict the impact of a new flow based on its source/destination addresses and port numbers.
*   **Integration:**  When allocating an interface port, give preference to ports with lower predicted impact from existing flows.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
For each interface port:
    Train LSTM model with historical queue length data
    Initialize priority score threshold

//Per packet processing
packet = receivePacket()
hashValue = hash(packet.header)
initialPort = hashValue % numberOfInterfacePorts
priorityScore = calculatePriorityScore(initialPort)

if priorityScore < threshold:
    sortedPorts = sortInterfacePortsByPriorityScore()
    for port in sortedPorts:
        if port != initialPort:
            selectedPort = port
            break
    if selectedPort == null:
        selectedPort = roundRobinSelect()
else:
    selectedPort = initialPort

routePacket(packet, selectedPort)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   FPGA or accelerator card for low-latency predictive modeling.
*   High-speed memory for storing historical queue length data and model parameters.
*   Dedicated processing cores for hash calculation and packet routing.
