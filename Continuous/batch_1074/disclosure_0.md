**Dynamic Resource Shaping via Predictive Load Balancing & Inter-Request Dependency Mapping**

**Concept:** Extend proactive resource allocation by not only anticipating *how much* resource is needed, but *what shape* that resource should take, based on predicted inter-request dependencies and real-time load balancing.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Dependency Mapping & Prediction Engine
    *   **Function:** Analyze request queues (as mentioned in claim 11, 16, 19) to identify common data access patterns, execution dependencies (e.g., request A needs data processed by request B), and potential bottlenecks.
    *   **Input:** Request queue, historical request data, data source schema, resource utilization metrics.
    *   **Output:** Dependency graph, predicted resource requirements (CPU, Memory, Network I/O, specific libraries/tools), recommended resource shaping (see below).
*   **Component:** Dynamic Resource Shaper
    *   **Function:**  Adjust resource allocation *shape* in addition to size.  This includes:
        *   **Co-location:**  Group requests with high data dependencies on the same physical/virtual machine.  Prioritize this for requests identified by the Dependency Mapping Engine.
        *   **Specialized Node Provisioning:** If a request requires a specific tool or library (e.g., a particular version of TensorFlow for a machine learning task), dynamically provision a node with that dependency or migrate the request to one.
        *   **Network Prioritization:**  Establish QoS rules to prioritize network traffic between co-located requests, reducing latency for data transfer.
        *   **Memory Allocation Strategy:** Implement a memory manager that prefetches data dependencies based on the dependency graph, reducing memory access times.
    *   **Input:** Dependency graph, predicted resource requirements, current resource utilization.
    *   **Output:** Resource configuration parameters (CPU cores, memory size, network bandwidth, software dependencies), migration instructions.
*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The Dependency Mapping & Prediction Engine integrates with the request queue monitoring system (claim 11, 16, 19).
    *   The Dynamic Resource Shaper interacts with the resource allocation manager to provision/modify virtual machines (claim 6, 14) and configure network settings (claim 7, 15).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Resource Shaper):**

```
function allocate_resources(request_queue):
  for request in request_queue:
    dependency_graph = get_dependency_graph(request)
    resource_requirements = get_resource_requirements(request)
    
    // Identify co-dependent requests
    co_dependent_requests = find_co_dependent_requests(dependency_graph, request_queue)
    
    // Determine optimal resource shape
    resource_shape = determine_resource_shape(resource_requirements, co_dependent_requests)
    
    // Provision resources
    provision_resources(resource_shape)
    
    // Assign request to resources
    assign_request(request, provisioned_resources)
    
    // Monitor resource utilization
    monitor_utilization(provisioned_resources)

function determine_resource_shape(resource_requirements, co_dependent_requests):
  // Combine resource requirements for co-dependent requests
  combined_requirements = combine_requirements(resource_requirements, co_dependent_requests)
  
  // Choose node type based on combined requirements (CPU, Memory, GPU, specialized libraries)
  node_type = choose_node_type(combined_requirements)

  // Configure network prioritization rules
  network_rules = configure_network_prioritization(node_type)
  
  return node_type, network_rules
```

**Novelty:**  While the patent focuses on *how much* resource to allocate proactively, this design focuses on *what shape* that resource should take to optimize performance by considering inter-request dependencies and co-location. This allows for more efficient resource utilization and reduced latency. The ability to dynamically provision specialized nodes based on request requirements is a key differentiator.
