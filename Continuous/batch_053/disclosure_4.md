## Adaptive Cache Poisoning Resilience via Predictive Forensics

**Concept:** Extend the forensic trail concept to *predict* potential cache poisoning events before they fully propagate, using machine learning to identify anomalous patterns in forensic data.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Collection & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Extended Forensic Data:** Augment existing forensic trails with:
    *   **Requestor IP Reputation:** Integrate IP reputation scores (e.g., from abuse databases) into the forensic trail.
    *   **Request Rate:** Capture the request rate from each client IP over a sliding window.
    *   **Content Type/Size:** Track the type and size of requested content.
    *   **Geographic Location:** Derive geographic location from IP addresses.
    *   **Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB):** Record TTFB for each request.
*   **Feature Engineering Pipeline:** A dedicated pipeline will automatically compute the following features from the raw data:
    *   **Anomaly Scores:** Calculate anomaly scores for each feature (request rate, TTFB, content size) based on historical data.  Use techniques like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM.
    *   **Reputation-Weighted Scores:** Combine IP reputation scores with anomaly scores to create a combined risk score.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring patterns in feature combinations. (e.g., sudden spike in requests from low-reputation IPs for large files.)

**II. Predictive Model:**

*   **Model Type:** Employ a time-series forecasting model combined with a classification model.
    *   **Time-Series Component:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to predict future request rates and TTFB based on historical data.
    *   **Classification Component:** Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to classify requests as either "benign" or "potentially malicious" based on the features described above and the predictions from the LSTM.
*   **Training Data:** Historical cache request logs, augmented with known poisoning events (if available) and labeled with “benign” or “malicious”.
*   **Model Retraining:** Continuously retrain the model with new data to adapt to evolving attack patterns. Frequency: Weekly.

**III. Implementation & Integration:**

*   **Forensic Trail Enrichment:** Modify the lowest-level servers to collect and store the extended forensic data.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Deploy a dedicated Prediction Engine that receives forensic data, runs the predictive model, and generates risk scores.
*   **Adaptive Cache Control:** Integrate the Prediction Engine with the cache servers.  Based on the risk score:
    *   **Threshold-Based Actions:**
        *   **Low Risk:**  Serve the content as normal.
        *   **Medium Risk:**  Introduce a short delay before serving the content, or request a verification from a higher-level cache.
        *   **High Risk:**  Evict the content from the cache and potentially block the requesting IP address.
    *   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Implement an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the risk thresholds based on the overall system load and observed attack patterns.

**IV. Pseudocode (Cache Server - Adaptive Control Logic):**

```
function serve_request(request):
  forensic_data = get_forensic_data(request)
  risk_score = prediction_engine.predict_risk(forensic_data)

  if risk_score < LOW_THRESHOLD:
    return cached_content
  elif risk_score < MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    verification_result = request_verification_from_higher_cache(request)
    if verification_result == VALID:
      return cached_content
    else:
      evict_from_cache(request)
      return error_response
  else:
    evict_from_cache(request)
    block_requesting_ip(request.ip_address)
    return error_response
```

**V.  Monitoring and Alerting:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor the number of requests classified as "potentially malicious" and the number of cache evictions triggered by the predictive model.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify administrators when the number of malicious requests exceeds a predefined threshold, or when the predictive model's accuracy drops below a certain level.
