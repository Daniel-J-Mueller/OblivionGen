## Dynamic Interface Prioritization with AI-Driven Flow Steering

**Specification:** A system for dynamically prioritizing network interfaces based on real-time AI-driven analysis of flow characteristics, going beyond simple congestion detection.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of *reacting* to congestion by rerouting flows to alternative multipath groups, proactively *predict* interface saturation and steer traffic based on a learned understanding of application behavior and traffic patterns. This builds upon the existing multipath concepts but introduces a predictive, application-aware element.

**Components:**

*   **Flow Characterization Module:** Captures detailed information about each network flow (e.g., packet size distribution, inter-arrival times, application type identified via deep packet inspection, source/destination addresses, port numbers). This goes beyond basic statistics used for congestion control.
*   **AI/ML Prediction Engine:**  A trained machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or long short-term memory network) that consumes the flow characterization data and predicts future interface utilization.  The model will be trained offline on historical network data and continuously updated with real-time information.  Specifically, it predicts *when* an interface will become saturated for a given flow.
*   **Dynamic Interface Weighting System:** Based on the AI predictions, assign dynamic weights to each interface within a multipath group.  Higher weights indicate a preferred interface for new flows. This replaces the equal-cost or weighted-cost approach with a *predicted*-cost approach.
*   **Flow Steering Logic:**  Incoming flows are steered to interfaces based on their dynamic weights. This can be implemented using a modified hashing algorithm or a flow-based policy engine.  New flows are directed to lower-weighted interfaces, preventing congestion before it happens.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor interface utilization and refine the AI model and dynamic weights based on actual performance.

**Pseudocode (Flow Steering Logic):**

```
// Hash Function (Modified to incorporate weights)
function steerFlow(flowInfo, interfaceList, weights) {
    combinedHash = hash(flowInfo.sourceIP, flowInfo.destinationIP, flowInfo.port)
    weightedSum = 0
    for (i = 0; i < interfaceList.length; i++) {
        weightedSum += combinedHash * weights[i]
    }
    selectedInterfaceIndex = weightedSum % interfaceList.length
    return interfaceList[selectedInterfaceIndex]
}

// Initialization
interfaceList = [interface1, interface2, interface3] // List of available interfaces
weights = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0] // Initial equal weights

// Real-time Update (based on AI predictions)
function updateWeights(aiPredictions) {
    // aiPredictions: Array of predicted interface utilization for each interface
    for (i = 0; i < aiPredictions.length; i++) {
        weights[i] = 1.0 - aiPredictions[i] // Lower utilization = higher weight
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This approach differs significantly from the provided patent by moving from *reactive* congestion avoidance to *proactive* flow steering. It leverages AI to understand application behavior and predict interface saturation *before* it occurs, enabling more efficient resource utilization and improved network performance. The dynamic weighting system offers a more granular and adaptable approach to multipath routing than traditional methods.
