## Adaptive Sensitivity Profiles & Contextual Redaction

**Concept:** Extend the privacy control system to dynamically adjust redaction levels based on inferred user context *and* a proactive sensitivity profile. Instead of binary sensitive/non-sensitive, introduce granular sensitivity levels and a system that learns user preferences for disclosure.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensitivity Profile Generation:**

*   **Data Sources:**  Collect data from multiple sources:
    *   User-explicit preferences (e.g., "I'm comfortable sharing my location with family, but not publicly").
    *   Behavioral data (e.g., frequency of sharing certain data types, context of sharing – work vs. personal).
    *   Social Network Analysis: Infer sensitivity based on the audience. Larger/more public audiences suggest higher sensitivity.
    *   Environmental Context: Location, time of day, activity (inferred from sensors – movement, audio).
*   **Sensitivity Levels:** Define a spectrum (e.g., 1-5, Low-High) for each data type.  Each level represents a different degree of redaction/obfuscation.
*   **Profile Storage:**  Store as a dynamic data structure – constantly updated with new information.

**2. Contextual Analysis Engine:**

*   **Input:** Real-time data streams – location, time, activity, recipient list, communication channel.
*   **Processing:** Utilize a combination of:
    *   Rule-based system:  Predefined rules based on common scenarios (e.g., "If location is a hospital, increase sensitivity of medical information").
    *   Machine Learning Model (trained on user behavior): Predict optimal sensitivity level based on context.
*   **Output:**  Contextual Sensitivity Score – a weighted score representing the overall sensitivity required for the current situation.

**3. Adaptive Redaction System:**

*   **Input:**  Output data (text, images, audio), Contextual Sensitivity Score.
*   **Redaction Techniques:** Implement a variety of techniques, selectable based on sensitivity level and data type:
    *   **Complete Redaction:**  Remove sensitive data entirely.
    *   **Partial Redaction:**  Mask portions of the data (e.g., redact digits in a phone number, blur faces in an image).
    *   **Data Generalization:** Replace specific data with broader categories (e.g., "age 35" -> "age 30-40").
    *   **Semantic Obfuscation:**  Rephrase sentences to remove sensitive keywords without changing the overall meaning (using Natural Language Generation).
    *   **Differential Privacy:** Add noise to data to protect individual privacy while preserving overall trends.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor user interaction with redacted content. If the user requests more information, progressively reduce redaction levels (with explicit consent).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Redaction Process):**

```
function redact_data(data, context):
  sensitivity_level = calculate_sensitivity_level(context)

  if sensitivity_level == HIGH:
    redacted_data = complete_redaction(data)
  else if sensitivity_level == MEDIUM:
    redacted_data = partial_redaction(data)
  else:
    redacted_data = data // No redaction

  return redacted_data

function calculate_sensitivity_level(context):
  location = context.location
  recipient = context.recipient
  activity = context.activity

  //Rule-based rules
  if location == "Hospital":
    sensitivity += 2
  if recipient == "PublicSocialMedia":
    sensitivity += 3

  //ML model prediction
  predicted_sensitivity = ML_model.predict(location, recipient, activity)
  sensitivity = sensitivity + predicted_sensitivity

  return sensitivity
```

**Engineer Considerations:**

*   Requires a robust machine learning model trained on diverse datasets.
*   Scalability is crucial – the system must handle real-time processing of large data streams.
*   A user-friendly interface for managing sensitivity profiles and providing feedback is essential.
*   Ethical considerations:  Ensure the system is transparent and respects user privacy.
