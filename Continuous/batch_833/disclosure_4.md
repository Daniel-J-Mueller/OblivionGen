## Adaptive Metamaterial Lens Array for ToF Modules

**Concept:** Integrate a dynamically reconfigurable metamaterial lens array *above* the existing VCSEL/SPAD/camera sensor arrangement to actively shape the illumination and detection volume for Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensing. This moves beyond passive lenses and enables complex 3D scene understanding.

**Specifications:**

*   **Metamaterial Material:** Utilize a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) matrix with embedded metallic resonators (e.g., split-ring resonators) capable of dynamically shifting resonance frequencies under applied voltage.
*   **Array Configuration:**  A 5x5 array of individually addressable metamaterial 'pixels' positioned directly above the camera module’s sensor stack. Each pixel acts as a miniature lens.
*   **Pixel Control:** Each metamaterial pixel controlled by an integrated micro-controller unit (MCU). MCU receives commands from the host processor to adjust pixel resonance frequencies.
*   **Illumination Shaping:** By dynamically adjusting the resonance frequencies of metamaterial pixels, the VCSEL illumination pattern can be sculpted to prioritize specific regions of interest (ROI) or to create complex light sheets.  
    *   *Function:* `shape_illumination(ROI_coordinates, illumination_intensity_map)` – adjusts pixel resonances to concentrate light on the specified ROI according to the intensity map.  Intensity map could dynamically change depending on the environment or the objects detected.
*   **Detection Volume Shaping:** Similar to illumination, pixel resonance shifts can dynamically reshape the SPAD's field of view.
    *   *Function:* `shape_detection(detection_volume_coordinates)` – adjusts pixel resonances to focus SPAD sensitivity on the specified 3D detection volume.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Embedded calibration routine to map pixel resonance frequencies to precise illumination/detection volume shapes. This is crucial for accuracy.
*   **Power Management:** Low-power design for MCU and LCE control circuitry to minimize energy consumption.
*   **Housing Integration:** Integrate metamaterial array into existing camera module housing with minimal modifications. The housing must allow for appropriate voltage application to the metamaterial elements.
*    **Communication Protocol:** I2C or SPI interface for communication with the host processor.
*   **Voltage Requirements:** <5V for LCE control, minimizing power demands.

**Operation:**

1.  Host processor analyzes scene data (e.g., from a conventional camera).
2.  Host processor determines ROI or complex 3D detection volumes.
3.  Host processor sends commands to the metamaterial array controller.
4.  Controller adjusts voltage applied to individual metamaterial pixels, shifting resonance frequencies and shaping illumination and/or detection volumes.
5.  ToF sensor data is captured with optimized illumination and detection.
6.  Data is processed to create 3D maps or perform object recognition.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Autonomous navigation
*   Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)
*   Robotics
*   Gesture recognition
*   Augmented reality/virtual reality
