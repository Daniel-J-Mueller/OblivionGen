## Dynamic Network Address Prefixes for Mobile Edge Compute (MEC) & Drone Swarms

**Specification:** A system enabling dynamically allocated and rapidly reconfigurable network address prefixes (specifically IPv6) tailored for transient compute resources within a MEC environment, with specific focus on supporting drone swarms operating as a distributed compute fabric.

**Problem:** The provided patent focuses on associating a static IPv6 address from a CSP with a compute instance. This works for largely stationary edge resources. However, drone swarms are *highly* mobile and require rapidly changing network configurations as they move between cell towers and form/dissolve compute clusters. Static allocation is inefficient and creates unnecessary overhead. Furthermore, a swarm acting as a distributed compute fabric needs internal addressing independent of external CSP addressing.

**Innovation:** Implement a system where the edge location acts as a “prefix delegator” for IPv6 addresses, dynamically assigning /112 or smaller prefixes to individual drones or drone clusters based on their current location (cell tower connection) and compute role. This is conceptually similar to DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, but optimized for high-frequency allocation/deallocation and distributed coordination.

**System Components:**

1.  **Edge Prefix Manager (EPM):** Runs within the edge location. Maintains a pool of available IPv6 prefixes (e.g., /48 or larger allocated from the CSP).  The EPM exposes an API for requesting and releasing prefixes.
2.  **Drone Network Agent (DNA):** Runs on each drone. Responsible for requesting a network prefix from the EPM upon entering the range of an edge location, configuring the drone’s network interfaces with the allocated prefix, and releasing the prefix upon leaving range or entering a different edge location.
3.  **Swarm Coordinator:** (Optional, for swarm compute) A designated drone within the swarm manages the internal addressing scheme *within* the allocated prefix. This allows drones to communicate directly without traversing the external network.
4.  **Cell Tower Integration:** The system integrates with the cell tower infrastructure to determine the drone's current location.  This allows the EPM to delegate prefixes based on cell tower ID or proximity.

**Pseudocode (DNA - Drone Network Agent):**

```pseudocode
function on_edge_location_entered(edge_location_id):
    request_prefix = create_prefix_request(edge_location_id)
    prefix_response = send_request_to_EPM(request_prefix)

    if prefix_response.status == "success":
        allocated_prefix = prefix_response.prefix
        configure_network_interface(allocated_prefix)
        register_with_swarm_coordinator(allocated_prefix) //If part of a swarm

        //Start timer to release prefix when leaving range
        start_leave_range_timer(edge_location_id)
    else:
        log_error("Failed to allocate prefix")

function on_leave_range(edge_location_id):
    release_prefix(edge_location_id)
    deconfigure_network_interface()

function release_prefix(edge_location_id):
    send_release_request_to_EPM(edge_location_id)

function configure_network_interface(prefix):
    // Configure network interface with allocated prefix
    // Set up routing table
    // etc.

function deconfigure_network_interface():
    // Remove prefix from network interface
    // Clear routing table
    // etc.
```

**Key Features & Advantages:**

*   **Scalability:** Supports a large number of drones/clusters.
*   **Efficiency:** Minimizes address space usage by allocating only the necessary prefix size.
*   **Mobility Support:** Enables seamless handover between cell towers and dynamic cluster formation/dissolution.
*   **Security:**  Prefixes can be rotated frequently to enhance security.
*   **Internal Addressing:** Enables direct communication within the swarm, reducing latency and bandwidth consumption.

**Further Exploration:**

*   Integration with Software Defined Networking (SDN) to automate prefix allocation and network configuration.
*   Development of a predictive algorithm to pre-allocate prefixes based on drone trajectory.
*   Implementation of a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to track prefix allocations and prevent conflicts.
