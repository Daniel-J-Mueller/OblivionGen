**Dynamic Cell Morphology & Haptic Feedback Integration**

**Concept:** Expand upon the curved cell displays by introducing dynamically morphing cell shapes coupled with localized haptic feedback. Instead of static curves, cells shift and reshape in real-time based on user gaze, interaction, or underlying data.  Combine this with subtle, localized haptic pulses to enhance the sense of depth and interaction.

**Specifications:**

*   **Morphing Algorithm:** Implement a physics-based simulation for cell deformation. Cells aren't merely scaled or rotated, but *bend* and *flex* under simulated forces. These forces are driven by:
    *   **Gaze Tracking:** Cells nearest the user’s gaze subtly “bulge” forward, increasing the illusion of proximity.
    *   **Interaction:**  When a user interacts (e.g., selects) a cell, it exhibits a more pronounced deformation – a ‘ripple’ or ‘pulse’ effect.
    *   **Data Visualization:**  Cell shape directly represents underlying data.  For example, a stock price graph could be visualized as the height/curvature of a cell.
*   **Haptic Integration:**  VR headset must have localized haptic actuators (e.g., micro-pneumatic or electroactive polymer).
    *   Actuators correspond to individual cells or groups of cells.
    *   Haptic pulses are synchronized with visual cell deformations. A 'bulge' is accompanied by a subtle pressure on the user’s face.
    *   Variable intensity haptics convey data – stronger pulses for higher values, distinct patterns for different types of events.
*   **Cell Subdivision Enhancement:** Divide cells into dynamically sized subcells. The subcell size adjusts based on content *and* user focus.  Higher resolution rendering is applied to subcells under direct gaze. This creates a ‘sweet spot’ effect.
*   **Material Simulation:** Cells should visually *appear* constructed from varying materials – glass, metal, fabric.  Reflections, textures, and light scattering contribute to the realism. A system to simulate different material properties based on the underlying data represented by the cell.
*   **Spatial Audio Integration:** Cells emit subtly directional audio cues that change based on cell shape and proximity. This further reinforces the 3D illusion.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Per-cell update function
function updateCell(cell, userGazePosition, deltaTime) {

    // Calculate distance from cell to gaze
    distance = distanceBetween(cell.position, userGazePosition);

    // Apply gaze-based deformation
    deformationMagnitude = map(distance, 0, maxDistance, 0, maxDeformation);
    cell.applyDeformation(deformationMagnitude);

    // Calculate haptic feedback intensity
    hapticIntensity = map(deformationMagnitude, 0, maxDeformation, 0, maxHapticIntensity);
    applyHapticFeedback(cell.hapticActuator, hapticIntensity);

    // Subcell Resolution Adjustment:
    if(isCellUnderGaze(cell, userGazePosition)){
        increaseSubcellResolution(cell);
    } else {
        decreaseSubcellResolution(cell);
    }
}

// Main loop
for each cell in cellArray {
    updateCell(cell, userGazePosition, deltaTime);
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   High frame rate rendering is crucial to maintain the illusion of smooth deformation.
*   Haptic actuator placement and calibration require precision.
*   Efficient collision detection is needed to prevent visual artifacts during deformation.
*   Optimized rendering pipeline for dynamically sized subcells.
