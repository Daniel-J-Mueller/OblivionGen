## Dynamic Multi-Market Pricing with Predictive Currency Fluctuation

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive currency adjustments to *proactively* price items across multiple foreign markets, factoring in predicted currency fluctuations *and* competitor pricing, presented as a unified “optimal price surface”.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time exchange rates (multiple sources).
    *   Historical exchange rate data (5+ years, granular).
    *   Merchant-defined base price (in home currency).
    *   Merchant-defined minimum/maximum acceptable profit margins (in home currency).
    *   Competitor pricing data (scraped/API access – multiple competitors per market).
    *   Sales velocity data (historical item sales in each market).
    *   Macroeconomic indicators (GDP growth, inflation rates, political stability – per country).
    *   Event data (major holidays, local events impacting demand).
*   **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Time series forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM) to predict short-term (1-7 day) exchange rate fluctuations.  Models trained *per currency pair*.
    *   Bayesian regression to incorporate macroeconomic indicators and event data into exchange rate predictions.
    *   Competitor pricing prediction (based on historical data and identified competitor behaviors).
*   **Optimal Price Surface Calculation:**
    *   **Cost Calculation:** Convert base price to local currency using *predicted* exchange rate.
    *   **Demand Modeling:**  Estimate demand elasticity based on price, competitor pricing, and historical sales data.
    *   **Profit Maximization:** Implement a multi-variable optimization algorithm (e.g., genetic algorithm, simulated annealing) to determine the price that maximizes expected profit *across all markets*.  Constrained by merchant-defined minimum/maximum profit margins.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Continuously recalculate optimal prices (every 1-6 hours) based on updated data and predictions.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Microservices architecture (for scalability and resilience).
    *   Message queue (e.g., Kafka) for asynchronous communication between services.
    *   Distributed database (e.g., Cassandra) for storing historical data.
    *   API endpoints for:
        *   Receiving merchant pricing and margin data.
        *   Retrieving optimal prices per market.
        *   Monitoring prediction accuracy.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Dashboard displaying:
        *   Optimal prices per market.
        *   Predicted exchange rate fluctuations.
        *   Competitor pricing landscape.
        *   Prediction accuracy metrics.
        *   Profit margin projections.

**Pseudocode (Price Calculation):**

```
FUNCTION calculateOptimalPrice(item, market, predictedExchangeRate, competitorPrices, merchantMargins):
  localCost = item.basePrice * predictedExchangeRate
  demandEstimate = estimateDemand(localCost, competitorPrices)
  predictedRevenue = localCost * demandEstimate
  predictedProfit = predictedRevenue - item.costOfGoodsSold
  
  IF predictedProfit < merchantMargins.minimum:
    price = merchantMargins.minimum * predictedExchangeRate
  ELSE IF predictedProfit > merchantMargins.maximum:
    price = merchantMargins.maximum * predictedExchangeRate
  ELSE:
    price = optimizePrice(localCost, competitorPrices, merchantMargins)
  
  RETURN price
END FUNCTION
