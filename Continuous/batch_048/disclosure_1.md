## Dynamic Inventory Shadow Mapping & Predictive Relocation

**Concept:** Extend the illumination mapping to not just *detect* high illumination, but to actively predict shadow movement within a materials handling facility and proactively relocate inventory to optimize visibility for automated systems (robots, cameras, scanners) and human pickers.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Multi-camera system (as per patent base – at least 2 overhead, strategically positioned).
    *   Ambient Light Sensors: Distributed throughout the facility to measure overall light levels and directionality.
    *   IMU/Orientation Sensors: Mounted near cameras to accurately track camera angle & orientation in real-time.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge computing devices located throughout the facility, communicating with a central server.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Enhanced Illumination Mapping:* Utilizes the patent’s foundational illumination map generation but expands to model shadow *volume* instead of just pixel-level illumination. This involves creating a 3D representation of potential shadows based on object geometry (see 'Object Reconstruction' below) and light source direction.
    *   *Object Reconstruction:*  Leverages multi-view stereo vision to create basic 3D models of inventory items. Doesn’t need to be high-fidelity; approximate bounding boxes or convex hulls are sufficient. The aim is to understand object size and shape for shadow casting.
    *   *Shadow Propagation Engine:* A physics-based simulation engine that propagates shadows based on simulated light source movement (sun’s trajectory, artificial light adjustments) and object geometry.  Calculates shadow paths and areas of occlusion.
    *   *Predictive Visibility Analysis:* Assesses the impact of shadows on critical areas of the facility: robot navigation paths, scanner fields of view, picking stations. Quantifies the reduction in visibility.
    *   *Relocation Recommendation Engine:* Generates recommendations for inventory relocation to minimize shadow interference.  Prioritizes relocation based on the criticality of the affected area and the cost of relocation.
    *   *Automated Relocation Control:* (Optional) Integrates with automated material handling systems (AMHS) to automatically execute relocation recommendations.

**Pseudocode - Relocation Recommendation Engine:**

```
function generate_relocation_recommendations(shadow_map, visibility_analysis_results, inventory_data, amhs_status):
  # shadow_map: 3D map of predicted shadow coverage
  # visibility_analysis_results: Areas with low visibility due to shadows
  # inventory_data: Location, size, and priority of each inventory item
  # amhs_status: Current status of automated material handling systems

  recommendations = []

  for item in inventory_data:
    if item.location in visibility_analysis_results:
      # Calculate potential relocation targets (open spaces with good visibility)
      targets = find_viable_relocation_targets(item.size, amhs_status)

      # Evaluate relocation cost (distance, AMHS availability, etc.)
      relocation_cost = calculate_relocation_cost(item.location, target)

      # Assign a score based on shadow impact and relocation cost
      score = (shadow_impact_score * weight_shadow) - (relocation_cost * weight_cost)

      recommendations.append((item, target, score))

  # Sort recommendations by score (highest score first)
  sorted_recommendations = sort(recommendations, key=lambda x: x[2])

  return sorted_recommendations
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution cameras with global shutter (to minimize motion blur).
*   Powerful edge computing devices with GPUs for real-time simulation.
*   Robust wireless communication infrastructure.
*   Integration with existing AMHS control systems.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased efficiency of automated material handling systems.
*   Improved accuracy of inventory scanning and picking.
*   Reduced labor costs.
*   Enhanced safety.
*   Optimized space utilization.
