## Dynamic Character Customization via Spectator-Driven Morph Targets

**Concept:** Extend the spectator interaction beyond simple audience member representation and user input actions. Allow spectators to *directly* influence the visual appearance of in-game characters – both player-controlled and non-player characters (NPCs) – using a system of morph targets.

**Specs:**

*   **Morph Target Library:** A pre-defined library of blend shapes/morph targets for all characters in the game. These targets should represent subtle (and not-so-subtle) facial expressions, body modifications (muscle flex, slight height changes, etc.), and accessory additions (temporary tattoos, glowing effects).  A baseline "neutral" state exists for each character.
*   **Spectator Voting System:**  Integrated within the spectator viewing interface. Spectators can "vote" on which morph targets to apply to a designated character (either a player character they’ve linked to, or a globally designated NPC). Voting could be weighted based on a "spectator influence" score - determined by factors like viewing duration, chat activity, or in-game purchases.
*   **Real-Time Blending:** The game engine must dynamically blend the morph targets based on the weighted spectator votes. A smoothing algorithm will be necessary to prevent jarring visual changes.
*   **Character Designation System:** A mechanism to allow players to “open up” their character for spectator influence. This could be a toggleable option or a limited-time “spectator mode” activation.  NPCs may be pre-designated as “spectator influenced” by game designers.
*   **Influence Limits:** A safety mechanism to prevent extreme or disruptive character modifications.  Maximum blend weight limits for each morph target, and a “veto” system for inappropriate or game-breaking modifications.  A "restore to default" button is also needed.
*   **Visual Feedback:** The game interface must visually indicate which morph targets are being applied, and by whom (e.g., displaying the usernames of influential spectators near the character).
*   **Monetization Potential:** "Premium" morph targets could be introduced, unlocked via in-game currency or real-money purchases.  This allows players to create more elaborate or unique character customizations.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Character Structure
Character {
  Mesh;
  MorphTargets[ ]; // Array of blend shapes
  InfluenceLevel; // 0.0 - 1.0 (How much spectator input affects the character)
}

// Spectator Voting
SpectatorVote {
  MorphTargetID;
  Weight; // 0.0 - 1.0 (How strongly the spectator wants this target applied)
}

// Update Character Appearance
function UpdateCharacterAppearance(Character, SpectatorVotes) {
  TotalVoteWeight = 0;
  for each Vote in SpectatorVotes {
    TotalVoteWeight += Vote.Weight;
  }

  for each MorphTarget in Character.MorphTargets {
    TargetVoteWeight = 0;
    for each Vote in SpectatorVotes {
      if (Vote.MorphTargetID == MorphTarget.ID) {
        TargetVoteWeight += Vote.Weight;
      }
    }

    // Normalize and apply influence
    BlendWeight = (TargetVoteWeight / TotalVoteWeight) * Character.InfluenceLevel;
    ApplyMorphTarget(MorphTarget, BlendWeight);
  }
}
```

**Expansion:**

*   **Procedural Morph Target Generation:** Explore the use of procedural generation to create new morph targets dynamically, based on spectator suggestions.
*   **AI-Driven Morph Target Suggestion:** An AI could analyze spectator chat and suggest morph targets that align with the current mood or theme of the game.
*   **“Morph Target Challenges”:**  Introduce in-game challenges that reward players for creating unique and visually appealing character customizations using spectator influence.
