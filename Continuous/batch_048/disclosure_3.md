## Dynamic Network Topology Mirroring & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the overlay network concept to proactively mirror and *predict* network topology changes, allowing for pre-emptive routing adjustments and significantly reduced latency during network events. This moves beyond simple address translation to a dynamic, self-optimizing network fabric.

**Specs:**

1.  **Topology Discovery Agents (TDAs):** Each communication manager module hosts a TDA. These agents actively probe the underlying physical networks, discovering links, bandwidth, and latency. TDAs operate asynchronously, constantly updating a local topology map.

2.  **Topology Prediction Engine (TPE):** A centralized (or distributed) TPE receives topology data from all TDAs. It employs machine learning algorithms (time series analysis, graph neural networks) to *predict* potential network disruptions (link failures, congestion) *before* they occur.  The TPE outputs predicted topology changes with associated confidence levels and estimated time-to-impact.

    *   *Input:* TDA Topology Data (real-time), Historical Network Event Data, Network Configuration Data
    *   *Output:* Predicted Topology Changes (link state, bandwidth, latency), Confidence Level, Time-to-Impact

3.  **Preemptive Routing Controller (PRC):** The PRC receives predicted topology changes from the TPE. Based on this information, it dynamically adjusts routing tables *within the overlay network*. This involves:

    *   Creating alternative paths *before* disruptions occur.
    *   Weighting paths based on predicted latency and bandwidth.
    *   Implementing failover mechanisms.

4.  **Overlay Network Path Diversity:** Encourage path diversity within the overlay.  Instead of always selecting the "shortest" path, the PRC prioritizes paths that offer redundancy and resilience. 

5.  **Data Structures:**

    *   `TopologyMap`:  Graph data structure representing the underlying physical network. Nodes represent network devices, edges represent links with associated attributes (bandwidth, latency, status).
    *   `PredictedTopologyChange`: Object containing:
        *   `AffectedNode`: Node ID.
        *   `ChangeType`: (Link Failure, Congestion, etc.).
        *   `ConfidenceLevel`: (0.0 - 1.0).
        *   `TimeToImpact`: (Seconds).
        *   `AlternativePaths`: List of potential alternative paths.

6.  **Pseudocode (PRC â€“ AdjustRoutingTable):**

```pseudocode
function AdjustRoutingTable(PredictedTopologyChange ptc) {
  if (ptc.ConfidenceLevel > Threshold) {
    //Retrieve current routing path
    currentPath = GetRoutingPath(destinationNode)

    //Determine Alternative Path
    alternativePath = FindBestAlternativePath(ptc.AffectedNode, currentPath, ptc.AlternativePaths)

    //Update routing table to use alternative path.
    UpdateRoutingTable(destinationNode, alternativePath)

    //Send proactive route update to destination node.
    SendRouteUpdate(destinationNode, alternativePath)

  }
}

function FindBestAlternativePath(affectedNode, currentPath, alternativePaths) {
  bestPath = null
  bestScore = -1
  for each path in alternativePaths {
    score = CalculatePathScore(path) // considers latency, bandwidth, hop count
    if (score > bestScore) {
      bestScore = score
      bestPath = path
    }
  }
  return bestPath
}

function CalculatePathScore(path) {
  // Combine metrics: latency, bandwidth, hop count
  latencyScore = 1 / path.latency
  bandwidthScore = path.bandwidth
  hopCountScore = 1 / path.hopCount

  //Weighted Sum
  return (0.5 * latencyScore) + (0.3 * bandwidthScore) + (0.2 * hopCountScore)
}
```

7.  **Security Considerations:**  Implement robust authentication and encryption mechanisms to protect the topology information and routing updates.  Prevent malicious actors from injecting false topology data or hijacking routing decisions.
