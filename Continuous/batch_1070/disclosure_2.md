## Adaptive Packet Reconstruction via Temporal Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the parsing engine to not just *interpret* packets, but *reconstruct* them over time, handling fragmentation and out-of-order delivery more robustly. This moves beyond simple header parsing to a more holistic, stateful packet understanding.

**Specs:**

*   **Temporal Buffer:** A dedicated high-speed buffer (SRAM preferred) associated with each active flow (identified by a 5-tuple: source/destination IP/port, protocol). Size configurable per-flow (e.g., 1KB - 64KB) based on observed RTT and expected fragmentation levels.
*   **Fragment Tracking Table:** A hash table keyed on a 'fragment ID' (derived from packet header fields – IP ID, UDP/TCP stream ID, etc.). Each entry stores:
    *   `expected_total_length`: The total length of the fragmented packet, initially unknown.
    *   `received_fragments`: A linked list of received fragment payloads.
    *   `fragment_order`: The expected order of this fragment within the overall packet.
    *   `completion_flag`: Boolean indicating if all fragments are received.
*   **Parsing Engine Modification:**
    *   Upon receiving a packet, determine if it's fragmented (IP flags, etc.).
    *   If fragmented:
        *   Extract the fragment ID.
        *   Lookup in the Fragment Tracking Table. If not found, create a new entry.
        *   Append the current packet’s payload to the `received_fragments` list.
        *   Update `fragment_order` and `expected_total_length` as needed.
        *   **Defer parsing:**  Do *not* immediately process the packet. Mark the flow as “fragmented/pending”.
    *   If not fragmented, proceed with standard parsing.
*   **Reassembly Engine (Dedicated Thread/Core):**
    *   Periodically scans the Fragment Tracking Table.
    *   For each flow marked “fragmented/pending”:
        *   Checks if all expected fragments have been received (based on fragment order and `expected_total_length`).
        *   If complete:
            *   Concatenates the fragments in the correct order.
            *   Triggers full packet parsing on the reassembled packet.
            *   Removes the flow from the Fragment Tracking Table.
*   **Out-of-Order Handling:** The reassembly engine must handle fragments arriving out of order. Fragments are stored in the `received_fragments` list, and reordered based on `fragment_order` *before* concatenation.
*   **Timeout Mechanism:** Fragments with a TTL expiration must be removed from the reassembly buffer after an appropriate timeout.
*   **Flow Identification:** Robust flow identification is critical. The system needs to accurately associate fragments belonging to the same flow, even under heavy load and network fluctuations. This requires careful selection of the 5-tuple, and possibly incorporating additional flow tracking mechanisms.

**Pseudocode (Reassembly Engine):**

```
function reassemble_packets():
  for each flow in fragment_tracking_table:
    if flow.status == "fragmented/pending":
      if all_fragments_received(flow):
        reassembled_packet = concatenate_fragments(flow)
        parse_packet(reassembled_packet)
        remove_flow_from_table(flow)
      else:
        check_fragment_timeouts(flow)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased resilience to network fragmentation and out-of-order delivery.
*   Improved performance for applications sensitive to packet loss and delay.
*   Enhanced security by detecting and mitigating fragmented packet attacks.
*   Allows more accurate deep packet inspection, as complete packets are available for analysis.
