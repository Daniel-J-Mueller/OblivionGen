## Holographic Volumetric Display with Dynamic Light Field Generation

**Concept:** A display system creating true holographic-like volumetric images by dynamically generating and projecting light fields, leveraging micro-lens array modulation alongside wavelength-selective reflection as described in the referenced patent. The system aims to move beyond simple directional projection towards reconstructing light waves to create images appearing to float in space.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Volume:** 30cm x 30cm x 30cm cubic volume.
*   **Resolution:** 1000x1000x1000 voxels (1 billion total voxels).
*   **Refresh Rate:** 60 Hz.
*   **Light Source:** Array of 10,000+ micro-LEDs, each individually addressable. Emission spectrum range: 400nm – 700nm (visible light).
*   **Modulation Layer 1 (Wavelength Selection):** Dichroic micro-mirror array (1000x1000 elements) integrated *behind* the micro-LED array. Mirrors are dynamically tilted via MEMS actuators. Designed to reflect specific wavelengths of light from the micro-LEDs towards the volumetric space.  Each mirror can be independently tuned to reflect a narrow bandwidth of light.
*   **Modulation Layer 2 (Phase/Amplitude Control):** Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) with a high fill factor (90%+) placed *in front* of the micro-LED and dichroic mirror array.  This SLM will modulate the phase and amplitude of light to fine-tune the light field. Resolution must match the micro-LED array.
*   **Viewing Window:** A transparent, anti-reflective coated, durable polycarbonate sheet forming the front of the display.
*   **Computational Unit:** High-performance GPU cluster for real-time rendering of light field data and control of all display elements.  Required processing power: >50 Teraflops.
*   **Software:** Custom software pipeline:
    1.  3D model input.
    2.  Light field rendering – Ray tracing or wave optics based rendering to calculate light propagation through the volume.
    3.  Light field decomposition – Breaking down the light field into individual ray/wave components.
    4.  Control signal generation – Mapping light field data to micro-LED, SLM, and MEMS actuator control signals.
    5.  Real-time synchronization of all display elements.
*   **Calibration System:** Integrated camera system for automatic calibration of the micro-LED array, SLM, and MEMS actuators to compensate for manufacturing variations and environmental effects.

**Innovation Details:**

1.  **Multi-Layered Modulation:** Combining wavelength-selective reflection (dichroic mirrors) with phase/amplitude modulation (SLM) allows for precise control of both the color and the direction of light rays, creating a more realistic and detailed light field.
2.  **Computational Light Field Rendering:** Leveraging advanced rendering techniques to generate a light field that accurately simulates the behavior of light waves, resulting in a more immersive and realistic 3D experience.
3.  **Dynamic Calibration:** The integrated camera system automatically calibrates the display, ensuring optimal performance and image quality over time and under varying environmental conditions.
4.  **High-Density Volumetric Display:** The use of a micro-LED array and a high-resolution SLM allows for a very high voxel density, resulting in a more detailed and realistic 3D image.
5.  **Potential Applications:** Medical imaging (visualization of anatomical structures), scientific visualization (complex data sets), entertainment (holographic gaming and movies), and telepresence (realistic 3D video conferencing).
