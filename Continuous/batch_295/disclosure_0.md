## Dynamic Network Resilience Scoring & Predictive Re-Routing

**Concept:** Expand predictive capabilities beyond just traffic load to assess overall network *resilience* given various failure scenarios, and proactively implement re-routing *before* failures occur based on resilience scores, not just predicted load.

**Specifications:**

**I. Resilience Metric Development:**

1.  **Factor Identification:** Define key factors contributing to network resilience. These go beyond bandwidth and include:
    *   **Path Diversity:** Number of disjoint paths between nodes.
    *   **Node Criticality:**  A metric quantifying how much traffic *must* flow through a given node (high criticality = single point of failure).
    *   **Link Capacity Utilization:** Current load vs. capacity.
    *   **Geographic Distribution:** Distance/separation of network infrastructure, accounting for environmental risks (e.g., natural disasters).
    *   **Dependency Mapping:** Identification of dependencies between network services and physical infrastructure.

2.  **Weighted Scoring:** Assign weights to each factor based on organizational priorities (e.g., high availability vs. cost optimization). Weights are configurable.

3.  **Resilience Score Calculation:**  Compute an overall resilience score for each network path (or segment) using a weighted sum of the factors.  Normalize scores to a common scale (e.g., 0-100).

**II. Predictive Re-Routing Engine:**

1.  **Scenario Generation:** Simulate various failure scenarios (single link failures, node outages, multi-failure events, DDoS attacks, etc.). This builds on the existing failure-case prediction in the base patent.

2.  **Resilience Impact Assessment:** For each scenario, evaluate how the failure impacts the resilience score of affected paths.

3.  **Proactive Re-Routing Algorithm:**
    *   Continuously monitor resilience scores.
    *   If a pathâ€™s resilience score falls below a predefined threshold (configurable), trigger the re-routing algorithm.
    *   Identify alternate paths with higher resilience scores.
    *   Dynamically shift traffic to these alternate paths *before* the failure occurs.
    *   Re-routing decisions should consider not only resilience but also cost, latency, and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Data Sources:**
    *   Network monitoring tools (traffic data, link status).
    *   Topology database (network map, device information).
    *   Geographic information systems (GIS) (infrastructure locations, environmental risks).
    *   Historical failure data (identify recurring vulnerabilities).

2.  **Processing Pipeline:**
    *   **Data Ingestion:** Collect data from various sources.
    *   **Data Processing & Analysis:** Calculate resilience metrics, identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Prediction Engine:** Simulate failure scenarios, predict resilience impact.
    *   **Re-Routing Engine:**  Determine optimal re-routing paths, dynamically adjust traffic flow.

3.  **API & Integration:**
    *   Expose API for integration with existing network management systems.
    *   Support integration with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controllers for automated traffic control.

**IV. Pseudocode (Re-Routing Engine):**

```
function proactive_reroute(path):
  resilience_score = calculate_resilience(path)
  if resilience_score < threshold:
    alternate_paths = find_alternate_paths(path)
    best_path = select_best_path(alternate_paths, criteria: [resilience, cost, latency])
    if best_path != null:
      shift_traffic(path, best_path, percentage: incremental_shift_rate) //Gradual shift
      log_reroute(path, best_path)
```

**V. Future Enhancements:**

*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Use ML to predict future failures based on historical data and identify patterns.
*   **Self-Healing Networks:**  Develop algorithms for automated network recovery in the event of failures.
*   **Adaptive Weighting:**  Dynamically adjust the weights of resilience factors based on network conditions and organizational priorities.
