## Dynamic Contextual Echo System

**Specification:** A system augmenting user input with probabilistic contextual echoes, proactively suggesting completions *before* the user finishes articulating their request, and adjusting suggestions based on real-time biometric data.

**Core Concept:** Instead of passively waiting for an error condition (as the provided patent addresses), this system *anticipates* user intent, presenting subtle, dynamic 'echoes' of possible completions. These aren't just lexical suggestions, but contextual extrapolations informed by biometric data.

**Components:**

1.  **Biometric Sensor Integration:**  A multi-modal sensor array (microphone, potentially camera for lip/facial muscle movement, galvanic skin response, even subtle EEG via a wearable device) collects data reflecting user cognitive load and emotional state.
2.  **Intent Prediction Engine:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on vast datasets of user interaction *and* correlated biometric data. This network predicts the user's likely intent *during* input, not just after.
3.  **Echo Generation Module:**  Based on the intent prediction, this module generates multiple potential completions (text, voice commands, even graphical actions).  These are prioritized based on prediction confidence *and* a ‘surprise’ factor – presenting slightly unexpected, but potentially useful, completions to encourage exploration.
4.  **Dynamic Presentation Layer:** This layer presents the echo completions subtly.  Consider:
    *   **Sub-audible audio cues:** Very short, almost imperceptible sounds indicating possible completions.
    *   **Micro-haptic feedback:** Tiny vibrations on a wearable device.
    *   **Ambient lighting shifts:** Subtle color changes indicating completion probabilities.
    *   **Peripheral display cues:**  Small, non-intrusive visual hints on a nearby screen.
5.  **Adaptive Learning Loop:** The system continuously learns from user interactions – what echoes were accepted, rejected, or modified. This feedback refines the intent prediction model and the echo generation strategy.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (user_input_active) {
  biometric_data = collect_biometric_data()
  intent_prediction = predict_intent(user_input, biometric_data)

  candidate_completions = generate_completions(intent_prediction)
  prioritized_completions = prioritize_completions(candidate_completions, intent_prediction)

  //Present top 3 prioritized completions using a blend of sub-audible audio, haptics, and ambient lighting
  present_completions(prioritized_completions)

  if (user_accepts_completion) {
    log_successful_completion(user_input, accepted_completion)
    update_model(user_input, accepted_completion)
  } else {
    log_rejected_completion(user_input)
    //Potentially increase "surprise" factor in subsequent suggestions
  }

  delay(0.1 seconds) //Adjust as needed
}
```

**Novelty:** The existing patent reacts *to* errors. This system proactively anticipates needs, offering subtle guidance *before* errors occur. Biometric data integration is key – the system doesn't just understand *what* the user is saying, but *how* they are saying it (e.g., stress level, cognitive load), allowing for more nuanced and adaptive suggestions.  The dynamic, multi-sensory presentation layer is also unique – moving beyond simple text or voice prompts.
