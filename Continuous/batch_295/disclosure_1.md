**Personalized Product ‘Wishlist’ Prediction & Proactive Sourcing**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** ‘Anticipatory Demand Engine’ (ADE).
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User Search History (across all connected platforms – not just the e-commerce system).
    *   User Browsing History (explicitly opted-in data).
    *   Social Media Activity (publicly available, opted-in data).
    *   Purchase History (internal).
    *   ‘Wishlist’ Data (internal).
    *   Trending Product Data (aggregated from multiple sources – Google Trends, social media, news feeds).
    *   Real-time Inventory Data (from internal and external suppliers).
*   **AI Model:** Hybrid approach:
    *   Collaborative Filtering (for identifying similar users).
    *   Content-Based Filtering (analyzing product features).
    *   Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically LSTM – for time-series analysis of user behavior and trend prediction.
    *   Transformer Model – for natural language processing of user queries and social media data.
*   **User Interface Integration:**
    *   ‘Predicted Wishlist’ section on the user’s account page.
    *   Proactive push notifications (opt-in) – “We think you might like…” with direct links to product pages.
    *   ‘Pre-Order’ option for predicted products (even if not currently in stock).
    *   ‘Sourcing Request’ button – allows users to explicitly request a product that isn't available.
*   **Sourcing Module:**
    *   Automated scanning of supplier databases.
    *   API integration with external marketplaces.
    *   ‘Negotiation Bot’ – automated price negotiation with suppliers.
    *   ‘Quality Control’ module – automated review of supplier ratings and product reviews.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Data Collection:** ADE continuously collects and analyzes data from all sources.
2.  **Demand Prediction:** AI model predicts products a user is likely to desire based on their historical behavior and current trends. Prediction confidence is assigned to each product.
3.  **‘Predicted Wishlist’ Generation:** A curated list of predicted products is presented to the user.
4.  **Proactive Sourcing:** If a predicted product is unavailable, the sourcing module automatically searches for it.
5.  **Pre-Order/Sourcing Request:** Users can pre-order unavailable products or submit sourcing requests.
6.  **Supplier Negotiation & Quality Control:** Sourcing module negotiates prices and assesses supplier quality.
7.  **Inventory Management:** System adjusts inventory levels based on predicted demand.

**Pseudocode (Core Prediction Loop):**

```
function predict_user_demand(user_id):
  user_data = get_user_data(user_id)
  trending_data = get_trending_data()
  
  # Feature engineering: combine user data and trending data
  features = combine_data(user_data, trending_data)
  
  # Run data through the AI model
  predictions = AI_model.predict(features)
  
  # Filter predictions by confidence score
  filtered_predictions = filter_predictions(predictions, confidence_threshold=0.7)
  
  # Sort predictions by confidence score
  sorted_predictions = sort_predictions(filtered_predictions)
  
  return sorted_predictions
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply responding to searches. It proactively *anticipates* user needs and sources products before they even explicitly request them. The combination of multi-source data analysis, sophisticated AI modeling, and automated sourcing creates a truly personalized and predictive shopping experience.
