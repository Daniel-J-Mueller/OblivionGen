**Adaptive Metamaterial Projection System**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core:** A dynamically reconfigurable metamaterial surface acting as the light source. This surface consists of an array of individually controllable meta-atoms.
*   **Control System:** A high-speed FPGA-based controller. This controller manages the excitation of each meta-atom, determining both amplitude *and* phase.
*   **Scanning Mechanism:** No mechanical scanning. Pattern projection is achieved entirely through electronic control of the metamaterial surface. The pattern is “painted” onto the surface in real-time.
*   **Image Sensor:** Existing rolling shutter camera integrated with the system. (Existing camera functionality is utilized, but is not being modified)
*   **Wavelength:** Operates in the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400nm – 1000nm).
*   **Resolution:** Dynamically adjustable, up to 1024x1024 meta-atoms.
*   **Power:** Low-power consumption (<5W) due to the inherent efficiency of metamaterials.
*   **Cooling:** Passive cooling.
*   **Materials:** Metamaterial constructed from high-refractive-index dielectric materials (e.g., titanium dioxide, silicon). Substrate: Flexible polymer.

**Operational Description:**

1.  **Scene Analysis:** The system begins by analyzing the target scene. This is achieved via a separate, low-resolution camera.
2.  **Pattern Generation:** A computational algorithm generates a structured light pattern optimized for the scene geometry and desired illumination characteristics.
3.  **Metamaterial Excitation:** The algorithm translates the structured light pattern into a control signal that modulates the excitation of each meta-atom in the metamaterial surface.
4.  **Dynamic Projection:** The metamaterial surface emits a structured light pattern with precise control over amplitude, phase, and polarization. The pattern is dynamically updated in synchronization with the rolling shutter camera.
5.  **Image Acquisition:** The rolling shutter camera captures the reflected light from the scene.
6.  **Data Processing:** The captured image is processed to reconstruct a 3D map of the scene, or to enhance the image quality.

**Pseudocode (Pattern Generation Algorithm):**

```
function generatePattern(sceneData, resolution):
  // sceneData: Contains information about the scene geometry and desired illumination
  // resolution: Target resolution of the structured light pattern

  pattern = emptyArray(resolution x resolution)

  for each pixel (x, y) in pattern:
    // Calculate the desired intensity and phase for the pixel based on sceneData
    intensity = calculateIntensity(x, y, sceneData)
    phase = calculatePhase(x, y, sceneData)

    // Map the intensity and phase to the control signal for the meta-atom
    controlSignal = mapToMetaAtomControl(intensity, phase)

    pattern[x, y] = controlSignal

  return pattern
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

Traditional structured light systems rely on mechanical scanning or spatial light modulators (SLMs). This introduces limitations in speed, resolution, and reliability. This system leverages the unique properties of metamaterials to create a fully electronic, dynamically reconfigurable light source. The elimination of mechanical parts leads to increased speed, higher resolution, and improved robustness. It could be used for high speed 3D scanning, LIDAR, and advanced imaging applications. The dynamic control also allows for beam shaping and adaptive illumination.
