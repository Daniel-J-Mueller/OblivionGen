## Dynamic Worker Skill Allocation & Predictive Task Assignment

**Concept:** Extend the system to not just *recommend* worker numbers, but to dynamically allocate workers *with specific skills* to processing stages based on predicted task complexity and worker proficiency.  The system currently considers worker presence/absence. This expands that to consider *worker capability*.

**Specs:**

*   **Skill Database:** Create a database storing worker skill profiles.  Skills are tagged (e.g., "welding - certified," "quality inspection - level 2," "robotics - maintenance").  Proficiency levels are numerically rated (1-5, 1 being novice, 5 being expert).
*   **Task Complexity Analysis:**  Implement an algorithm that analyzes incoming work (buffer state data) and assigns a ‘complexity score’ to each task. This could be based on part type, required operations, tolerance levels, etc. This utilizes machine vision and/or data from work orders.
*   **Predictive Assignment Engine:** This engine correlates task complexity scores with worker skill profiles. It predicts the time required to complete a task *by a specific worker*.  This prediction incorporates the worker’s proficiency in required skills.
*   **Real-Time Adjustment:** Continuously monitor task completion times.  Adjust worker assignments in real-time to optimize throughput and minimize bottlenecks. If a worker is consistently taking longer than predicted, the system reassigns them or suggests training.
*   **Simulation Module:** A module allowing for ‘what-if’ scenarios.  Managers can simulate changes in work volume, worker availability, or skill levels to predict the impact on production.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Assignment Engine):**

```
FUNCTION AssignWorkerToTask(Task, WorkerList):
  TaskComplexityScore = CalculateTaskComplexity(Task)
  BestWorker = NULL
  ShortestEstimatedTime = INFINITY

  FOR EACH Worker IN WorkerList:
    WorkerSkills = GetWorkerSkills(Worker)
    SkillMatchScore = CalculateSkillMatchScore(WorkerSkills, TaskComplexityScore) 
    EstimatedTime = CalculateEstimatedCompletionTime(Task, Worker, SkillMatchScore)

    IF EstimatedTime < ShortestEstimatedTime:
      ShortestEstimatedTime = EstimatedTime
      BestWorker = Worker

  RETURN BestWorker
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `WorkerProfile`: {WorkerID, Skills[], ProficiencyLevels[], Availability}
*   `TaskProfile`: {TaskID, ComplexityScore, RequiredSkills[], EstimatedDuration}

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Increased processing power for real-time analysis and prediction.
*   Integration with machine vision systems (for task complexity analysis).
*   Wireless communication network for worker tracking and data transmission.
