## Autonomous Vehicle Intent Projection via Dynamic Light Field Sculpting

**Concept:** Augment the strategy mode broadcasting with a dynamic, projected light field emanating *around* the vehicle, visually communicating not just *what* the vehicle is doing (uncoupled, permissive, etc.) but *where* it intends to go, and for *how long*. This moves beyond simple signaling to a predictive display, enhancing situational awareness for surrounding agents (human drivers, other AVs, pedestrians).

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Light Field Projector Array:** Multiple solid-state LiDAR-driven micro-projectors embedded within the vehicle’s exterior panels (front, sides, rear). These are not simple headlights, but create volumetric light displays. Resolution: 500x500 points per projector, with 8 projectors minimum.
*   **Predictive Trajectory Algorithm:** A real-time path planning module that generates not just the immediate trajectory, but a projected path for the next 5-10 seconds. This considers speed, acceleration, steering angle, and predicted behavior of surrounding objects.
*   **Light Field Rendering Engine:** Software that converts the predicted trajectory into a dynamic light field. This includes color-coding for different maneuver types (e.g., green for maintaining course, yellow for lane change, red for braking).
*   **Environmental Sensor Suite:** LiDAR, radar, cameras to accurately map the surrounding environment and detect objects.
*   **High-Bandwidth Communication Module:** For sharing predicted trajectory data with other connected vehicles (V2V communication).

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Trajectory Prediction:** The core algorithm estimates the vehicle’s future path. Input: current state (position, velocity, acceleration, steering angle), environmental data. Output: a series of 3D points representing the predicted trajectory.

    ```pseudocode
    function predictTrajectory(currentState, environmentalData):
      predictedPoints = []
      currentTime = 0
      while currentTime < predictionHorizon: //e.g., 10 seconds
        nextState = motionModel(currentState) //predict next state based on current state & controls
        obstacleAvoidance(nextState, environmentalData) //adjust for obstacles
        predictedPoints.append(nextState.position)
        currentState = nextState
        currentTime += timeStep
      return predictedPoints
    ```

2.  **Light Field Rendering:**  This module converts the trajectory data into a visual light field.  Key parameters:

    *   **Intensity:** Represents the probability of the vehicle following that specific path. Higher intensity indicates a more likely path.
    *   **Color:**  Maps maneuver types to colors: Green (straight), Yellow (lane change), Red (braking), Blue (turning).
    *   **Field of View:**  The area around the vehicle where the light field is projected. 

    ```pseudocode
    function renderLightField(predictedPoints, maneuverType):
      lightPoints = []
      for point in predictedPoints:
        intensity = calculateIntensity(point) //Based on probability and distance from vehicle
        color = mapManeuverToColor(maneuverType)
        lightPoints.append(LightPoint(position=point, intensity=intensity, color=color))
      return lightPoints
    ```

3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The light field is updated in real-time based on changes in the vehicle’s trajectory and the surrounding environment.  Update rate: 30 Hz.

4.  **V2V Communication Integration:** Share trajectory data with nearby vehicles. Other vehicles can integrate this data into their own path planning algorithms and render a fused light field, creating a shared awareness space.

**Operational Modes:**

*   **Normal Operation:** Displays predicted trajectory with appropriate color-coding.
*   **Emergency Maneuver:** Flashes the light field with red and uses a more aggressive visual pattern to signal urgent intent.
*   **Communication Failure:**  If V2V communication is lost, the light field reverts to a simpler display of current trajectory and maneuver type.
*   **Pedestrian Mode:** Projects a larger, more visible light field around the vehicle to enhance pedestrian awareness.
