## Adaptive Macroblock Splitting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust macroblock size *before* feature extraction, guided by a reinforcement learning agent, to optimize encoding efficiency. Current systems operate on fixed or pre-defined macroblock sizes. This proposes adapting the granularity based on content complexity *prior* to analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Raw video frame data.
*   **Macroblock Splitter:**  A module capable of dividing a frame into macroblocks of varying sizes (e.g., 16x16, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2). Initial frame division is a uniform 16x16 grid.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** A Deep Q-Network (DQN) trained to predict optimal macroblock splitting.
    *   **State:**  A localized region of the frame (e.g., 32x32 pixels) surrounding the current macroblock. Features extracted: Variance, edge density, texture complexity (using a pre-trained convolutional neural network – frozen weights).
    *   **Actions:**  Split the current macroblock into four equal quadrants (effectively halving the size). No split.
    *   **Reward:**  Derived from the rate-distortion cost *after* encoding the frame using the determined macroblock configuration.  Lower rate-distortion = higher reward.
*   **Feature Extractor:** Extracts features (as described in the original patent) from the *split* macroblocks.
*   **Encoding Mode Selector:**  The existing machine learning model (from the original patent) used for selecting the best encoding mode.
*   **Encoder:** The video encoder.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FOR each frame in video:
  FOR each macroblock in frame (starting with 16x16 grid):
    state = extract_localized_region(frame, macroblock)
    action = RL_agent.predict_action(state)

    IF action == "split":
      split_macroblock(macroblock)  // Divide into 4 quadrants
      #Recursively repeat from the start of the block to optimize granularity
    
    features = feature_extractor.extract_features(macroblock)
    encoding_mode = encoding_mode_selector.predict(features)
    encode_macroblock(encoding_mode)

  encoded_frame = assemble_encoded_macroblocks()
  
  #Calculate rate distortion cost for reward signal.
```

**Training Procedure:**

1.  **Dataset:** Large video dataset with diverse content.
2.  **Environment:**  Simulated encoder pipeline.
3.  **Reward Function:** Rate-distortion cost (trade-off between compression ratio and visual quality).
4.  **Optimization:** Train the DQN agent using standard reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration).

**Novelty:** Current systems optimize *within* fixed macroblock sizes. This system proposes pre-optimization *of* macroblock sizes *before* feature extraction and encoding, potentially enabling more efficient compression by adapting granularity to local content complexity. This is a hierarchical system of adaptation – a system which adapts *before* the existing adaptation.
