## Dynamic Contextual Product Bundling

**System Overview:** A system for automatically creating and presenting dynamically generated product bundles to a user, leveraging real-time behavioral data and predictive modeling to maximize conversion rates and average order value. This goes beyond simply suggesting alternatives; it *creates* new product combinations the user might not have considered.

**Core Components:**

*   **Behavioral Data Ingestion:** Collects real-time user data – browsing history, purchase history, items in cart, dwell time on product pages, search queries, demographic data (if available and permissible), and even micro-interactions like mouse movements and scrolling patterns.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:** Employs machine learning algorithms (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, association rule mining, and potentially deep learning models) to predict:
    *   **Complementary Products:** Products frequently purchased together or viewed in the same session.
    *   **Substitute Products:** Products that address the same user need.
    *   **'Missing' Products:** Products the user *might* need based on their current selections (e.g., buying a camera? Suggest a memory card, tripod, or camera bag).
    *   **Bundle Affinity Score:**  A score representing the probability a user will purchase a specific product bundle.
*   **Bundle Generation Module:**  Creates product bundles based on the predictions from the Predictive Modeling Engine.  Bundles can vary in size and composition.
*   **Dynamic Pricing Engine:** Adjusts bundle prices in real-time based on demand, inventory levels, and user-specific price sensitivity. Offers tiered discounts for larger bundles.
*   **Presentation Layer:** Displays the dynamic bundles to the user through various channels (website, mobile app, email, push notifications). Bundles are presented with clear pricing, descriptions, and compelling visuals.

**Pseudocode – Bundle Generation:**

```
function generate_bundle(user_id, current_cart_items) {
  // 1. Fetch user data and browsing history
  user_data = get_user_data(user_id)
  browsing_history = get_browsing_history(user_id)

  // 2. Predict complementary, substitute, and missing products
  complementary_products = predict_complementary_products(user_data, browsing_history, current_cart_items)
  substitute_products = predict_substitute_products(user_data, browsing_history, current_cart_items)
  missing_products = predict_missing_products(user_data, browsing_history, current_cart_items)

  // 3. Create potential bundles
  potential_bundles = []
  potential_bundles.push(combine(current_cart_items, complementary_products, max_bundle_size=5))
  potential_bundles.push(combine(current_cart_items, substitute_products, max_bundle_size=5))
  potential_bundles.push(combine(current_cart_items, missing_products, max_bundle_size=5))

  // 4. Calculate bundle affinity scores
  for each bundle in potential_bundles:
    bundle.affinity_score = calculate_affinity_score(bundle, user_data)

  // 5. Sort bundles by affinity score (descending)
  sorted_bundles = sort_bundles(sorted_bundles, by='affinity_score', ascending=False)

  // 6. Return the top N bundles
  return sorted_bundles[0:3] // Return the top 3 bundles
}

function calculate_affinity_score(bundle, user_data) {
  // This function would incorporate several factors:
  // - Historical purchase data for similar bundles
  // - User's price sensitivity
  // - Product ratings and reviews
  // - Real-time demand and inventory levels
  // - Predicted likelihood of purchase for each item in the bundle

  // (Detailed implementation would require a more complex model)
  return score;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers for data processing and model training.
*   Scalable database for storing user data and product information.
*   Machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for model development.
*   Real-time data streaming platform (Kafka, Apache Flink) for ingesting behavioral data.
*   API integration with e-commerce platform.

**Differentiation:**

This system goes beyond simple cross-selling and upselling. It dynamically *creates* bundles tailored to each user's needs and preferences, increasing the likelihood of conversion and maximizing revenue. The use of real-time data and predictive modeling ensures that the bundles are relevant and compelling.
