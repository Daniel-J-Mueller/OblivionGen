## Adaptive Error Recovery via Multi-Modal Contextual Embedding

**Concept:** Extend error attribution beyond ASR/NLU data to incorporate real-time visual context (if available) and user physiological data (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) to create a richer contextual embedding for more accurate error diagnosis and adaptive recovery strategies.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Synchronization Module:**

*   **Input:** Audio data (ASR input), NLU data, optional video stream (from device camera), optional physiological data stream (from wearable sensor).
*   **Function:**  Synchronizes data streams based on timestamps. Handles potential data stream dropouts or inconsistencies.  Normalizes data formats.
*   **Output:** Time-synchronized, normalized multi-modal data stream.

**2. Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **ASR/NLU Features:**  Utilize features as described in the provided patent (ASR confidence, slot scores, intent scores, etc.).
*   **Visual Features:**
    *   **Object Detection:** Identify objects present in the video stream (e.g., "lamp", "remote", "door").
    *   **Facial Expression Analysis:** Detect user's facial expressions (e.g., confusion, frustration, happiness).  Utilize action unit (AU) detection.
    *   **Gaze Tracking:** Determine where the user is looking.
*   **Physiological Features:**
    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Calculate HRV metrics (RMSSD, SDNN).
    *   **Skin Conductance (SC):** Measure SC levels.
    *   **Electrodermal Activity (EDA):**  Analyze EDA patterns.

**3. Contextual Embedding Module:**

*   **Input:** Feature vectors from ASR/NLU, visual features, physiological features.
*   **Process:**  Fuse feature vectors into a single contextual embedding vector.  Employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or transformer-based architecture for fusion.  Attention mechanisms should weigh the importance of different modalities based on the current context.
*   **Output:** High-dimensional contextual embedding vector.

**4. Error Attribution & Recovery Module:**

*   **Input:** Contextual embedding vector.
*   **Process:**
    *   Train a classifier (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) to map contextual embedding vectors to specific error types (ASR error, NLU intent misclassification, entity recognition failure, etc.).
    *   Based on the predicted error type, select an appropriate recovery strategy.  Recovery strategies can include:
        *   **Re-prompting with clarification:** "Did you say 'turn on the lamp' or 'turn off the lamp'?"
        *   **Providing alternative interpretations:** "I think you meant to say 'set the thermostat to 72 degrees'. Is that correct?"
        *   **Requesting visual confirmation:**  (If visual data is available) "Can you please point to the device you are referring to?"
        *   **Adaptive Dialogue:** Adjust the dialogue flow based on the user's physiological state (e.g., slow down the pace if the user is showing signs of frustration).

**5. Adaptive Learning Module:**

*   **Process:** Continuously refine the error attribution model and recovery strategies based on user feedback and interaction data.  Reinforcement learning can be employed to optimize recovery strategies over time.

**Pseudocode (Error Attribution):**

```
function attributeError(contextualEmbedding):
  errorType = classifier.predict(contextualEmbedding)
  return errorType
```
