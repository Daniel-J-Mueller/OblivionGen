## Neighborhood-Aware Predictive Security System

**System Overview:** This builds upon the neighborhood video sharing concept but adds proactive security features leveraging shared data and predictive AI. The goal is to shift from reactive monitoring to *anticipating* potential incidents.

**Core Components:**

*   **Neighborhood Security Mesh:** Extends the existing video sharing infrastructure. All participating A/V devices form a local, encrypted mesh network.
*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** A distributed AI engine residing on participating A/V devices *and* a central server.  The distributed aspect minimizes latency and bandwidth usage.
*   **Predictive Risk Scoring:**  Each A/V device and the central server generates a “risk score” for its immediate surroundings, factoring in historical data, real-time events, and learned patterns.
*   **Smart TV Integration:** Extends the existing playback functionality with proactive alerts and control options.
*   **User Preference Profiles:** Users define acceptable/unacceptable activities and sensitivity levels (e.g., “Alert me if a person approaches the front door after 10 PM”).

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**
    *   Each A/V device captures video and audio.
    *   On-device processing:
        *   Object detection (people, vehicles, animals).
        *   Activity recognition (walking, running, loitering, etc.).
        *   Sound analysis (breaking glass, shouting, alarms).
        *   Data is timestamped and tagged with location metadata.
    *   Local Mesh Network: Data is shared *within* the neighborhood mesh.  Sharing is configurable per user.
2.  **Distributed AI Engine (On A/V Devices):**
    *   Model Type:  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – specifically LSTMs – for time-series analysis.
    *   Training Data:  Historical video and audio data *from the neighborhood*.
    *   Function:
        *   Anomaly Detection: Identify events that deviate from learned “normal” behavior.
        *   Risk Score Calculation: Assign a risk score based on the severity and frequency of anomalies.
        *   Local Alerting:  Trigger immediate alerts to the homeowner for high-risk events.
3.  **Central Server AI Engine:**
    *   Model Type:  Federated Learning – combines data from multiple neighborhoods *without* sharing raw video.
    *   Training Data:  Aggregated risk scores and metadata from multiple neighborhoods.
    *   Function:
        *   Cross-Neighborhood Pattern Recognition: Identify emerging threats or unusual activity patterns that span multiple neighborhoods.
        *   Predictive Modeling: Forecast potential incidents based on historical data and current trends.
        *   Resource Allocation:  Optimize emergency response based on predicted risk.
4.  **Smart TV Interface:**
    *   Real-time Risk Map: Display a visual representation of the neighborhood's risk score, highlighting areas of concern.
    *   Proactive Alerts: Notify users of potential threats, providing relevant video footage and context.
    *   Remote Control: Allow users to remotely control A/V devices (pan, tilt, zoom) and activate alarms.
    *   Two-Way Communication: Enable communication with emergency services or neighbors through the Smart TV interface.
    *   Event History:  Provide a searchable log of all detected events.

**Pseudocode (Alert Generation):**

```
//On Device
function processFrame(frame) {
  objects = detectObjects(frame);
  activity = recognizeActivity(objects);
  sound = analyzeSound(frame);

  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(objects, activity, sound);

  if (riskScore > threshold) {
    sendAlert(riskScore, frame, objects, activity, sound);
  }
}

//Central Server
function aggregateRisk(neighborhoodData) {
    totalRisk = sum(neighborhoodData.riskScores);
    predictedRisk = applyPredictiveModel(totalRisk, historicalData);

    if (predictedRisk > globalThreshold) {
      dispatchEmergencyResources(neighborhood);
    }
}
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond simple video sharing and reactive monitoring to proactive threat prediction and prevention.  The use of distributed AI and federated learning enhances privacy and scalability. The integration of neighborhood data creates a more holistic and effective security solution.
