## Dynamic Frame Weighting & Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple frame repetition by dynamically weighting frame importance based on content analysis and *predictively* buffering likely needed frames *before* bandwidth dips occur. This moves beyond reactive repetition to proactive smoothing.

**Specs:**

**I. Core Modules:**

*   **Content Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Video Frame stream.
    *   Output:  `FrameWeight` (0.0 - 1.0) for each frame, indicating importance.
    *   Logic:
        *   **Motion Vector Analysis:** Higher motion = Higher weight.  (Scale: 0.1 - 0.4). Complex scenes require more data.
        *   **Scene Change Detection:** Significant scene changes = Higher weight. (Scale: 0.2 - 0.5).  These require more bandwidth.
        *   **Object Importance (AI-Driven):** Utilize a pre-trained object recognition AI (integrated or cloud-based). Prioritize frames containing important objects (e.g., faces, action elements) - scale: 0.1 - 0.3.
        *   Combine these weighted factors to generate `FrameWeight`.

*   **Predictive Buffer Manager:**
    *   Input: `FrameWeight`, Network Bandwidth data, Buffer occupancy.
    *   Output: Buffer management commands (prioritization, pre-fetching).
    *   Logic:
        *   **Bandwidth Prediction:** Analyze historical bandwidth data to predict future dips (short-term & long-term). Employ a Kalman filter or similar algorithm.
        *   **Weighted Pre-fetching:**  Based on `FrameWeight` & bandwidth prediction, proactively request/decode and store frames likely needed soon. Higher `FrameWeight` = Higher prioritization.
        *   **Dynamic Buffer Allocation:**  Allocate more buffer space to higher-priority frames (based on `FrameWeight`).  Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for lower-priority frames.
        *   **Adaptive Prediction:** Adjust prediction aggressiveness based on accuracy of previous predictions. If predictions are consistently inaccurate, reduce prediction horizon.

*   **Presentation Engine:**
    *   Input: Buffer contents, Network Bandwidth.
    *   Output: Video Frames for display.
    *   Logic:
        *   **Prioritized Frame Selection:** Select frames from the buffer based on priority (determined by `FrameWeight`).
        *   **Smooth Transitioning:** If bandwidth dips necessitate repetition, prioritize repetition of frames with *lower* `FrameWeight` (less critical to visual quality) before repeating high-`FrameWeight` frames.
        *    **Frame Dropping (Last Resort):** If repetition and prioritization fail, selectively drop frames with the *lowest* `FrameWeight`.
        *   **Repeatable Frame Tracking:** Store flags within the buffer to indicate how many times each frame has been presented.

**II. Data Structures:**

*   `FrameData`:
    *   `Frame`: Video Frame Data
    *   `FrameWeight`: Float (0.0 - 1.0)
    *   `PresentationCount`: Integer
    *   `Priority`: Integer (derived from `FrameWeight`)
*   `BufferEntry`: Queue of `FrameData`.

**III. Pseudocode (Predictive Buffer Manager):**

```pseudocode
function manageBuffer(frameWeight, networkBandwidth, bufferOccupancy):
  predictedBandwidth = predictFutureBandwidth(networkBandwidth)
  if predictedBandwidth < requiredBandwidth:
    // Proactive buffering
    prefetchFrames(frameWeight, bufferOccupancy)
  else:
    // Normal operation
    maintainBuffer(bufferOccupancy)

function prefetchFrames(frameWeight, bufferOccupancy):
  // Request/decode and store frames with high frameWeight
  // Prioritize based on frameWeight and predicted bandwidth dip severity
  // Allocate additional buffer space if available

function maintainBuffer(bufferOccupancy):
  // Maintain optimal buffer occupancy using LRU eviction policy
  // Evict frames with lowest frameWeight if buffer is full
```

**IV. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Cloud-Based Frame Weighting:** Offload the Content Analyzer to the cloud for more sophisticated analysis and object recognition.
*   **Collaborative Buffering:** Share buffer data between clients to improve buffering efficiency and reduce overall bandwidth usage.
*   **AI-Driven Bandwidth Prediction:** Utilize machine learning to improve the accuracy of bandwidth predictions.
*   **Per-Tile Buffering:** Adapt buffer sizes for different portions of the screen to optimize for areas of high visual complexity.
