## Autonomous Robotic Dunnage Adjustment

**System Overview:** A robotic system integrated with radiographic scanning to dynamically adjust dunnage *within* a moving container based on identified void spaces and shifting contents.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent identifies contents via radiographic imaging. This builds upon that by *actively responding* to the information, preventing damage during transit.

**System Components:**

*   **Robotic Arm:** A multi-axis, lightweight robotic arm capable of navigating within standard container dimensions. End effector will be modular â€“ inflatable/deflateable air bags, small granular material dispensers, or miniature compliant grippers.
*   **Miniature Radiographic Scanner:** A compact, low-power radiographic scanner mounted on the robotic arm, offering localized scanning of container sections. Operates in conjunction with the larger system scans.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Integrated within the robotic arm for precise position and orientation tracking *within* the moving container. Compensates for container motion.
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** Handles data from radiographic scans, IMU, and container tracking system. Executes algorithms for dunnage adjustment.
*   **Dunnage Material Reservoir:**  Internal reservoir containing inflatable air bags, granular fill material (e.g. biodegradable packing peanuts), or expandable foam.
*   **Container Tracking System:** System to track the container's position and orientation in real-time using external sensors (e.g. cameras, RFID tags).

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - Runs continuously as container is in motion

1.  Receive Container Position/Orientation Data from Container Tracking System
2.  Receive Robotic Arm Position/Orientation Data from IMU
3.  Initiate Local Radiographic Scan of target container section using robotic arm mounted scanner
4.  Process Radiographic Image:
    a. Identify Void Spaces and Shifting Contents
    b. Calculate Dunge Adjustment Needs (amount/type of material required)
5.  Plan Robotic Arm Path: 
    a. Optimize path to designated adjustment location within container
    b. Avoid obstacles (contents, existing dunnage)
6.  Execute Robotic Arm Movement
7.  Deploy Dunge Material:
    a. Inflate/deflate air bag, dispense granular material, or deploy expandable foam.
    b. Monitor adjustment via real-time radiographic imaging
8.  Repeat Steps 3-7 for multiple container sections/adjustment points
9.  Log Adjustment Data (material deployed, location, time) for future analysis
```

**Dunnage Adjustment Modes:**

*   **Void Fill:** Fill identified empty spaces to prevent shifting during transport.
*   **Pressure Distribution:** Redistribute dunnage to evenly support contents and prevent concentrated stress.
*   **Shock Absorption:** Deploy specialized dunnage materials to dampen vibrations and impacts.
*   **Real-time Compensation:** Continuously adjust dunnage based on detected movement and shifting during transit.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced Product Damage: Minimize the risk of breakage, dents, and scratches during transport.
*   Optimized Space Utilization: Efficiently utilize container space by dynamically adjusting dunnage.
*   Automated Process: Eliminate the need for manual dunnage adjustments.
*   Data-Driven Optimization: Leverage adjustment data to improve packaging designs and dunnage strategies.
