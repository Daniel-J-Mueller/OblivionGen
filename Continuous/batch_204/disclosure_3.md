## Dynamic Memory Dependency Graph Partitioning for Heterogeneous Accelerators

**Concept:** Extend the memory dependency graph concept to facilitate instruction scheduling *across* heterogeneous accelerator devices. The original patent focuses on optimizing scheduling *within* a single system. This builds upon that foundation by partitioning the dependency graph to exploit the specialized capabilities of multiple accelerators.

**Specification:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Host Processor:** Standard CPU responsible for overall program control, graph generation, and partitioning.
*   **Accelerator Pool:** A collection of heterogeneous accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs) each with unique strengths (e.g., GPU excels at dense matrix multiplication, FPGA at custom dataflows).
*   **Interconnect:** High-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect (e.g., NVLink, PCIe) facilitating data transfer between host and accelerators.

**2. Data Structures:**

*   **Memory Dependency Graph (MDG):**  A directed graph where nodes represent memory objects (tensors) and edges represent dependencies (read-after-write, write-after-read, write-after-write).  Edges will now include *cost estimates* for operations on different accelerator types.
*   **Accelerator Profile:** Data structure storing the capabilities of each accelerator in the pool. Includes supported data types, peak performance for key operations, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth.
*   **Partitioned MDG:** The original MDG divided into subgraphs, where each subgraph is assigned to a specific accelerator.

**3. Algorithm (Partitioning & Scheduling):**

```pseudocode
function partition_and_schedule(MDG, AcceleratorPool):
  PartitionedMDG = {}  // Dictionary mapping Accelerator to Subgraph

  for Accelerator in AcceleratorPool:
    PartitionedMDG[Accelerator] = empty_subgraph()

  // Initial Assignment: Assign nodes randomly to accelerators
  for Node in MDG.nodes():
    Accelerator = random_choice(AcceleratorPool)
    PartitionedMDG[Accelerator].add_node(Node)

  // Iterative Refinement: Improve partitioning based on cost
  for iteration in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
    for Node in MDG.nodes():
      current_accelerator = find_accelerator_for_node(Node, PartitionedMDG)
      best_accelerator = current_accelerator
      min_cost = calculate_cost(Node, current_accelerator, PartitionedMDG)

      for Accelerator in AcceleratorPool:
        if Accelerator != current_accelerator:
          # Calculate cost of moving Node to Accelerator
          new_cost = calculate_cost(Node, Accelerator, PartitionedMDG)
          if new_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = new_cost
            best_accelerator = Accelerator

      # Move Node if it improves the overall cost
      if best_accelerator != current_accelerator:
        move_node(Node, current_accelerator, best_accelerator, PartitionedMDG)

  // Scheduling within each accelerator
  for Accelerator in AcceleratorPool:
    Subgraph = PartitionedMDG[Accelerator]
    schedule_instructions(Subgraph, Accelerator)

  return PartitionedMDG
```

**4. Cost Calculation:**

The `calculate_cost` function evaluates the cost of executing the operations associated with a node on a specific accelerator. This cost includes:

*   **Execution Time:** Estimated time to perform the operations on the accelerator.
*   **Data Transfer Cost:** Cost of moving data to and from the accelerator. This considers communication bandwidth and data size.
*   **Synchronization Cost:** Overhead associated with synchronizing data between accelerators.

**5. Scheduling within Accelerators:**

The `schedule_instructions` function utilizes a technique similar to the original patent, prioritizing instructions based on memory dependencies *within* the assigned subgraph.

**6. Implementation Notes:**

*   **Data Placement:** The algorithm needs to consider data placement strategies to minimize data transfer costs.  Techniques like data replication or tiling may be employed.
*   **Communication Optimization:** Overlap communication with computation to hide communication latency.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Monitor performance during runtime and dynamically adjust the partitioning to adapt to changing workloads.
