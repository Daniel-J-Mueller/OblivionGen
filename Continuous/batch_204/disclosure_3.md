## Adaptive Multi-Modal Contextual Scoring

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting hypothesis scoring based on real-time multi-modal sensor data, beyond solely text/audio. This expands the existing scoring framework to incorporate environmental, physiological, and behavioral data.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Sensor Suite:** Integrated sensors capturing:
    *   **Environmental:** Ambient light, temperature, noise level, proximity to objects (using depth sensors/LiDAR).
    *   **Physiological (Wearable):** Heart rate, skin conductance, pupil dilation, brainwave activity (EEG â€“ optional).
    *   **Behavioral (Camera/Motion):** Head pose, gaze direction, facial expressions, body language, hand gestures.

2.  **Feature Extraction Modules:** Dedicated modules for each sensor type, extracting relevant features. Examples:
    *   *Environmental:* Light intensity, temperature gradient, noise spectrum.
    *   *Physiological:* Heart rate variability, skin conductance response amplitude, alpha/theta brainwave power.
    *   *Behavioral:* Gaze fixation points, facial action unit activations, hand velocity/acceleration.

3.  **Contextual Feature Vector:**  All extracted features are combined into a single, high-dimensional vector representing the current contextual state.

4.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment Module:** This module dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to the intent, NER, and domain scores *based on the contextual feature vector*. This is the core innovation.

    *   **Weight Adjustment Function:** A trained machine learning model (e.g., neural network, random forest) that takes the contextual feature vector as input and outputs a set of adjusted weights for the intent, NER, and domain scores.  
        *   *Training Data:*  The model is trained on a large dataset of utterances paired with corresponding contextual data and ground truth labels.  Reinforcement learning can be used.
        *   *Output:*  A scaling factor or direct weight value for each of the intent, NER, and domain scores.

5.  **Hypothesis Scoring Engine:**  The existing hypothesis scoring engine is modified to incorporate the adjusted weights.
    *   `new_score = (intent_score * adjusted_intent_weight) + (ner_score * adjusted_ner_weight) + (domain_score * adjusted_domain_weight)`

6.  **Calibration and Feedback Loop:**
    *   A continuous calibration process monitors the performance of the system and adjusts the weight adjustment function to improve accuracy.
    *   User feedback (explicit or implicit) is incorporated into the calibration process.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Weight Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjust_weights(context_vector):
  # context_vector: Multi-dimensional array of contextual features

  # Trained Model: weight_model (e.g., neural network)
  adjusted_weights = weight_model.predict(context_vector)

  # adjusted_weights: Array of 3 values: [adjusted_intent_weight, adjusted_ner_weight, adjusted_domain_weight]

  return adjusted_weights
```

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a user is in a noisy environment (high noise level in the context vector). The system might *increase* the weight assigned to the domain score (e.g., prioritizing noise-cancellation commands) and *decrease* the weight assigned to the intent score (reducing reliance on nuanced intent understanding). If a user exhibits physiological indicators of frustration (high skin conductance), the system could prioritize simpler commands or offer help.
