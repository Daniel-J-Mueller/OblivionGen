## Dynamic Biometric Authentication Mesh

**Concept:** Expand the facial recognition and barcode system into a dynamic, localized mesh network for enhanced security and personalized access control, moving beyond simple entry/exit authorization.

**Specs:**

**1. Network Infrastructure:**

*   **Node Type 1: Fixed Nodes:** Strategically placed throughout the facility (entry points, hallways, specific zones).  Equipped with:
    *   High-resolution RGB-D cameras (for 3D facial mapping and depth sensing).
    *   Short-range, secure wireless communication (e.g., UWB, 60GHz).
    *   Local processing unit (edge computing capable).
    *   Tamper detection sensors.
*   **Node Type 2: Mobile Nodes:** Integrated into user devices (phones, badges, wearables). Equipped with:
    *   Front-facing camera.
    *   Bluetooth/UWB/NFC transceiver.
    *   Secure element for credential storage.
    *   Processing unit capable of running authentication algorithms.

**2. Authentication Protocol:**

*   **Initial Enrollment:** User enrolls via app/portal. Captures high-resolution facial scan + biometric template. Generates a unique, rotating digital "key" – a cryptographic token bound to the user’s device and biometric data.
*   **Proximity Detection:** Mobile Node broadcasts a low-power beacon signal. Fixed Nodes detect beacon.
*   **Challenge-Response:** Fixed Node initiates a challenge.  Mobile Node responds with:
    *   Encrypted biometric data.
    *   Current digital key.
    *   Timestamp.
*   **Verification:** Fixed Node:
    *   Decrypts data.
    *   Verifies digital key and timestamp (prevents replay attacks).
    *   Compares live facial scan with enrolled template.
    *   Calculates a “trust score” based on biometric matching and temporal data.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Based on the trust score, the system grants or denies access to specific zones. Access isn't binary; it's graded.  High trust = full access.  Low trust = limited access or alerts security.
*   **Mesh Network Validation:** Each Fixed Node validates data from neighboring nodes. This provides redundancy and detects compromised nodes.

**3. Software Components:**

*   **Node Manager:** Central server responsible for managing all Fixed and Mobile Nodes.
*   **Biometric Engine:**  Sophisticated facial recognition algorithm with anti-spoofing measures.  Capable of adapting to changing lighting conditions and facial expressions.  Includes 3D facial mapping.
*   **Key Management System:** Securely generates, stores, and distributes digital keys.
*   **Trust Score Calculator:**  Weighted algorithm considering biometric matching, temporal data, network validation, and user behavior.
*   **Access Control Policy Engine:** Defines granular access control rules based on user roles, time of day, location, and trust score.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Monitors network traffic and user behavior for suspicious activity.

**4. Pseudocode (Simplified Authentication)**

```
// On Fixed Node
function receiveBeacon(mobileNodeID) {
  sendChallenge(mobileNodeID);
}

function receiveResponse(mobileNodeID, encryptedData, timestamp) {
  decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData);
  if (verifyTimestamp(timestamp)) {
    biometricMatch = compareBiometrics(decryptedData.facialScan, enrolledTemplate);
    trustScore = calculateTrustScore(biometricMatch);
    if (trustScore > threshold) {
      grantAccess(mobileNodeID);
    } else {
      denyAccess(mobileNodeID);
      alertSecurity();
    }
  } else {
    alertSecurity();
  }
}

// On Mobile Node
function broadcastBeacon() {
  // Send beacon signal with device ID
}

function receiveChallenge(fixedNodeID) {
  captureFacialScan();
  encryptedData = encrypt(facialScan);
  sendResponse(fixedNodeID, encryptedData, currentTime());
}
```

**Novelty:**

This expands beyond simple entry/exit to create a dynamic, localized security mesh. It’s not just *who* you are, but *where* you are *and* how confident the system is in your identity *in that moment*. The dynamic trust score enables granular access control and proactive security. It's adaptable to changing circumstances and minimizes the impact of compromised nodes.
