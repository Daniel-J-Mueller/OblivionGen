## Dynamic Pricing & Bundling via Predicted Cart Abandonment

**Concept:** Leverage cart data *before* purchase to proactively offer dynamic pricing & bundling, minimizing cart abandonment & maximizing revenue.  The system doesnâ€™t wait for abandonment to *react*; it *predicts* it and intervenes.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User profile data (demographics, purchase history).
    *   Real-time cart contents (items, quantities).
    *   User browsing behavior *within* the virtual shopping cart (time spent on each item, back-and-forth between items, use of comparison features).
    *   External data feeds (competitor pricing, promotional events).
    *   Time of day/week/year.
*   **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network or LSTM) trained on historical cart data, purchase outcomes, and user behavior. The model outputs a probability score for cart abandonment *during the current session*.  Key features will be browsing duration *within* the cart, number of item comparisons, and time since last item added.
*   **Dynamic Pricing/Bundling Module:**
    *   **Price Adjustment:** If the abandonment probability exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%), the system automatically reduces the price of one or more items in the cart. The reduction amount is calculated based on item margin, competitor pricing, and user price sensitivity (estimated from past purchases).
    *   **Bundle Creation:** If the abandonment probability is high, the system suggests a bundle of complementary items, offering a discounted price for the entire bundle. Bundle recommendations are generated based on association rule mining (e.g., "customers who bought X also bought Y").
    *   **Free Shipping Threshold Adjustment:** Dynamically lowers the free shipping threshold based on cart value and abandonment probability.
*   **User Interface Integration:**
    *   Non-intrusive display of price adjustments/bundle offers within the shopping cart.
    *   Clear communication of the reason for the offer (e.g., "Limited-time offer to help you complete your purchase").
    *   A/B testing of different UI variations to optimize offer effectiveness.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function process_cart(user_id, cart_contents, browsing_behavior):
    abandonment_probability = predict_abandonment(user_id, cart_contents, browsing_behavior)

    if abandonment_probability > 0.6:
        # Price Adjustment
        for item in cart_contents:
            if item.margin > threshold:
                discounted_price = item.price * (1 - discount_rate)
                apply_discount(item, discounted_price)

        # Bundle Creation
        recommended_bundles = generate_bundles(cart_contents)
        if recommended_bundles:
            best_bundle = select_best_bundle(recommended_bundles)
            display_bundle_offer(best_bundle)

        # Free Shipping Adjustment
        if cart_value < free_shipping_threshold:
            adjusted_threshold = cart_value * (1 - shipping_discount_rate)
            display_free_shipping_offer(adjusted_threshold)
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Standard server infrastructure. GPU acceleration recommended for training the prediction engine.

*   **Scalability:** System designed for horizontal scalability to handle large volumes of concurrent users.

*   **Privacy Considerations:**  User data used for prediction purposes is anonymized and aggregated.  Compliance with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
