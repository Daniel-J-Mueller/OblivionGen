## Adaptive Configuration Rollback & Canary Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the configuration application system to include automated rollback capabilities triggered not just by failure *count*, but by performance degradation detected *during* configuration application. Integrate a “canary” deployment stage where configurations are applied to a small, monitored subset of systems before wider rollout.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** "Performance Sentinel" - A module integrated with the existing configuration server.
*   **Data Input:** Real-time performance metrics from virtual computer system instances (CPU usage, memory utilization, network latency, application response times – configurable list).
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   Baseline Performance Capture: Establish baseline performance metrics *before* configuration application begins for each target system.
    *   Anomaly Detection: Continuously compare real-time metrics against baseline during configuration.  Employ statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, moving averages) to identify significant deviations indicating performance degradation.  Configurable sensitivity levels.
    *   Degradation Score: Calculate a “Degradation Score” for each system based on the severity and duration of performance anomalies.
*   **Rollback Trigger:**
    *   Threshold-Based: Initiate rollback if the average Degradation Score across a defined percentage (configurable) of the configured systems exceeds a configurable threshold.
    *   Individual System Rollback:  Optionally enable automatic rollback for *individual* systems exhibiting extreme performance degradation, even if the overall average remains acceptable.
*   **Canary Deployment Stage:**
    *   Target Subset: Allow the administrator to specify a “canary group” – a small subset of virtual computer system instances to receive the configuration *first*.
    *   Monitoring Period:  Configure a monitoring period for the canary group during which the Performance Sentinel collects performance data.
    *   Automated Evaluation:  Automatically evaluate performance data from the canary group. If performance remains within acceptable limits, proceed with wider rollout. If performance degrades, halt rollout and trigger rollback on the canary group.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**
    *   Snapshot-Based: Utilize system snapshots (VM images or similar) taken *before* configuration application. Restore systems to the pre-configuration snapshot in case of rollback.
    *   Configuration Reversion: Maintain a history of configuration changes. Revert configurations to the previous known-good state.
*   **Reporting & Alerting:**
    *   Detailed Rollback Reports:  Generate reports detailing rollback events, including affected systems, reasons for rollback, and performance data.
    *   Real-time Alerts:  Send alerts to administrators when rollbacks are triggered or performance degradation is detected.
