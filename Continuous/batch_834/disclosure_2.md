## Adaptive Data Sharding via Predictive Ingestion Modeling

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the temporal/spatial partitioning described in the base patent by introducing predictive modeling of ingestion rates *before* partitioning occurs, and dynamically adjusting shard size and boundaries based on these predictions. The core idea is to move beyond reactive splitting (splitting *after* exceeding thresholds) to proactive, anticipatory sharding.

**Components:**

1.  **Ingestion Rate Predictor (IRP):** A machine learning model trained on historical ingestion patterns. Inputs include:
    *   Time of day/week/month/year.
    *   Spatial regions (as defined by existing data).
    *   Event types (if applicable – metadata associated with time-series data).
    *   External factors (e.g., promotional events, sensor deployments – configurable inputs).
    *   Output: Predicted ingestion rate for specific spatial/temporal regions.  This is not a single number, but a probability distribution.

2.  **Shard Planner:** Uses the IRP output to determine optimal shard boundaries and sizes *before* data arrives. The planner considers:
    *   Predicted ingestion rates across spatial/temporal regions.
    *   Storage node capacity.
    *   Query patterns (historical query logs used to prioritize frequently accessed regions).
    *   Target shard size (configurable).
    *   Acceptable shard skew (a metric for how evenly data is distributed).

3.  **Dynamic Metadata Manager:**  Manages the mapping between logical data identifiers (e.g., sensor IDs) and physical shard locations. This manager is updated by the Shard Planner.

4.  **Adaptive Stream Processor:**  Stream processor modified to read shard locations from the Dynamic Metadata Manager and route data accordingly *before* writing to storage.

**Pseudocode (Shard Planner):**

```
function plan_shards(historical_data, external_factors, config):
  # historical_data: ingestion rates over time/space
  # external_factors: upcoming events
  # config: target shard size, acceptable skew

  ir_predictions = IRP.predict(historical_data, external_factors)

  potential_shards = generate_potential_shards(ir_predictions, config) #creates possible shard arrangements

  best_shard_arrangement = select_best_arrangement(potential_shards, config) #based on minimizing skew and maximizing balanced load.

  update_dynamic_metadata_manager(best_shard_arrangement) #push data into the metadata manager

  return best_shard_arrangement
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  The IRP constantly trains on incoming ingestion data and external factors.
2.  The Shard Planner periodically (e.g., hourly, daily) runs using the IRP’s predictions.
3.  The Shard Planner generates a new shard arrangement.
4.  The Dynamic Metadata Manager is updated.
5.  The Adaptive Stream Processor reads the updated metadata and routes incoming data to the correct shards.

**Novelty:**

This system differs from the referenced patent by proactively shaping shards *before* data arrival, based on predictive analytics. The patent focuses on reactive splitting. This allows for better resource utilization, reduced query latency, and improved scalability, particularly for time-series data with predictable patterns. The predictive aspect allows for pre-warming of storage resources. This isn’t merely splitting existing tiles; it’s *shaping* the landscape before the flood arrives.
