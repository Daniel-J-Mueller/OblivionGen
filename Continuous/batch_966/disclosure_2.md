## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & ‘Shadow Mode’ Communication

**Specification:** A system to dynamically prioritize notifications based on predicted user context *and* a parallel, low-bandwidth ‘shadow’ communication channel for preemptive data delivery.

**Core Concept:** Beyond simply adjusting polling frequency, this system analyzes user behavior (location, app usage, time of day, accelerometer data indicating activity) to predict *what* notifications will be most relevant *when* they arrive. Crucially, it also establishes a persistent, ultra-low-bandwidth communication channel that ‘pre-fetches’ potentially relevant data *before* the user actively requests it – acting as a ‘shadow’ to the primary communication.

**Components:**

1.  **Contextual Prediction Engine (CPE):**  A machine learning model running on the mobile device, continuously analyzing sensor data and usage patterns. Output is a dynamic ‘relevance score’ for different notification types.

2.  **Shadow Channel Manager (SCM):** Establishes and maintains a persistent, low-bandwidth connection (e.g., BLE, optimized MQTT) to the server. This channel is *always on* but transmits only small data packets.

3.  **Notification Prioritization & Delivery Module (NPDM):** Manages incoming notifications, applying relevance scores from the CPE. It leverages the SCM to proactively deliver potentially relevant data.

4.  **Server-Side Contextual Data Store (SCDS):** Stores server-side data relevant to user context (e.g., news headlines, traffic updates, weather forecasts).

**Operation:**

1.  **Continuous Context Analysis:** The CPE continuously analyzes user context, generating relevance scores for different notification types.

2.  **Proactive Data Prefetch:**  Based on relevance scores and predictive models, the SCM proactively requests small data packets from the SCDS via the shadow channel. For example:
    *   If the user is predicted to commute to work soon, the SCM requests current traffic conditions.
    *   If the user is predicted to be interested in a specific topic, the SCM requests a short news summary.
    *   If the user is predicted to be at the gym, the SCM requests exercise stats.

3.  **Notification Arrival & Presentation:** When a notification arrives via the primary channel:
    *   The NPDM applies the relevance score from the CPE.
    *   If relevant data was pre-fetched via the shadow channel, it’s seamlessly integrated into the notification. (e.g., a traffic alert notification includes a map of current congestion).
    *   Notifications are presented in a prioritized order, based on relevance and pre-fetched data.

**Pseudocode (NPDM):**

```
function processNotification(notification):
  relevanceScore = CPE.getRelevanceScore(notification.type)
  prefetchData = SCM.getPrefetchData(notification.type)

  if prefetchData:
    enrichedNotification = merge(notification, prefetchData)
  else:
    enrichedNotification = notification

  priority = relevanceScore + (prefetchData ? 10 : 0) // Boost priority if prefetch data available

  displayNotification(enrichedNotification, priority)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Mobile device with standard sensors (GPS, accelerometer, etc.).
*   Low-power wireless communication module (BLE, optimized MQTT).

**Software Requirements:**

*   Machine learning framework for the CPE.
*   Networking libraries for the SCM.
*   Secure communication protocols for the shadow channel.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency for critical notifications.
*   Improved user experience through proactive information delivery.
*   Optimized battery life (shadow channel uses minimal power).
*   Enhanced privacy (data pre-fetching is contextually relevant and limited).
