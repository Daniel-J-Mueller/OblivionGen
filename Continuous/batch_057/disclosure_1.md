## Adaptive Write Batching with Predictive Conflict Resolution

**Specification:**

**I. Overview**

This system builds upon the concept of optimistic write queues, but introduces dynamic batching and predictive conflict resolution to drastically improve throughput and reduce retry latency. Instead of simply queuing individual page write requests, the system groups them into batches based on predicted conflict probability.  The core principle is to proactively address potential conflicts *before* submitting the batch to the storage service, rather than reactively retrying after rejection.

**II. Components**

*   **Write Batcher:**  A module residing within each database engine node. Responsible for grouping incoming purge/write operations into batches.
*   **Conflict Predictor:**  A machine learning model trained on historical write patterns, transaction metadata, and data access graphs.  This model predicts the likelihood of conflict for each pair of operations *before* they are submitted as a batch.  Features would include:
    *   Timestamp of operation
    *   Affected page/object ID
    *   Transaction ID
    *   Data access patterns (read-before-write, etc.)
    *   Recent conflict history involving the same page/object
*   **Batch Optimizer:**  A module that dynamically adjusts the batch size based on the predicted conflict probability. Low predicted conflict: Larger batch. High predicted conflict: Smaller batch, or even individual requests.
*   **Pre-Resolution Engine:**  A component that attempts to resolve potential conflicts *before* submission. This could involve:
    *   **Read-Modify-Write Pre-fetch:** If a conflict is predicted involving a read-modify-write operation, pre-fetch the current version of the data.
    *   **Conditional Write Generation:** Construct write requests that include a condition (e.g., “only write if the version number is X”).
*   **Storage Service Interface:**  The existing interface, but modified to support conditional writes and pre-fetched data.

**III. Operational Flow**

1.  **Operation Capture:** Database engine nodes capture incoming purge/write operations.
2.  **Conflict Prediction:** The Conflict Predictor analyzes the operation and generates a conflict probability score for each operation pair within the current operation queue.
3.  **Dynamic Batching:** The Batch Optimizer groups operations into batches based on predicted conflict probabilities. Operations with high conflict likelihood are placed in smaller batches or processed individually.
4.  **Pre-Resolution:** The Pre-Resolution Engine attempts to resolve potential conflicts within the batch (e.g., pre-fetching data for read-modify-write operations, constructing conditional writes).
5.  **Batch Submission:** The batch (potentially including pre-fetched data or conditional writes) is submitted to the Storage Service.
6.  **Storage Service Handling:** The Storage Service processes the batch. Conditional writes are evaluated, and conflicts are handled transparently.
7.  **Feedback Loop:** The Storage Service provides feedback to the Conflict Predictor, including actual conflict occurrences. This feedback is used to refine the model and improve future predictions.

**IV. Pseudocode (Batch Optimizer)**

```
function optimizeBatch(operationQueue):
  batch = []
  currentBatchSize = DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE

  for operation in operationQueue:
    conflictProbability = predictConflict(operation, batch)

    if conflictProbability > HIGH_CONFLICT_THRESHOLD:
      #Reduce Batch Size
      currentBatchSize = min(currentBatchSize / 2, 1)

    if len(batch) >= currentBatchSize:
      submitBatch(batch)
      batch = []

    batch.append(operation)

  if len(batch) > 0:
    submitBatch(batch)
```

**V.  Data Structures**

*   **Operation:**  (Operation ID, Page ID, Operation Type, Timestamp, Transaction ID, Data)
*   **Conflict Matrix:**  A sparse matrix tracking conflict probabilities between different operations/pages. Used by the Conflict Predictor.
*   **Batch:**  List of Operations

**VI. Considerations**

*   **Training Data:**  The effectiveness of the Conflict Predictor heavily relies on the quality and quantity of training data.
*   **Model Complexity:**  Balancing model accuracy with computational overhead is crucial.
*   **Storage Service Modifications:**  Supporting conditional writes and pre-fetched data may require modifications to the Storage Service.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Dynamically adjusting the `HIGH_CONFLICT_THRESHOLD` based on system load and performance.
