## Adaptive Label Clustering & Semantic Zoom

**Concept:** Extend label orientation beyond individual features to dynamically cluster labels based on proximity *and* semantic relationship, coupled with a “semantic zoom” feature that adjusts label density and detail based on map scale.

**Specs:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   `LabelNode`:
    *   `featureID`: Unique identifier for the geographic feature.
    *   `labelText`: Text of the label.
    *   `position`: (x, y) coordinates on the map.
    *   `orientation`: Angle of the label (as in the base patent).
    *   `semanticCategory`: String representing the category of the feature (e.g., “restaurant”, “historical site”, “park”).
    *   `clusterID`: Integer identifying the cluster the label belongs to. Initially -1 (unclustered).
    *   `importanceScore`: Float value representing the relative importance of the feature. This could be derived from external data sources (e.g., popularity, user ratings).
*   `Cluster`:
    *   `clusterID`: Unique integer identifier for the cluster.
    *   `centroid`: (x, y) coordinates of the cluster’s center.
    *   `labelNodes`: List of `LabelNode` objects belonging to the cluster.
    *   `representativeLabel`: The `LabelNode` within the cluster selected for display (determined by `importanceScore` or other criteria).
    *   `clusterRadius`: Radius of the cluster.

**II. Algorithms:**

1.  **Initial Clustering:**
    *   For each `LabelNode`:
        *   Find all other `LabelNode` objects within a predefined radius.
        *   Filter these nodes to include only those with a similar `semanticCategory`.
        *   If sufficient matches are found (above a threshold), create a new `Cluster` containing these nodes. Assign a unique `clusterID` to the cluster.
        *   Assign the `clusterID` to each `LabelNode` within the cluster.

2.  **Dynamic Cluster Adjustment:**
    *   As the map is rotated or zoomed:
        *   Re-evaluate cluster membership. Nodes that move too far apart or have diverging `semanticCategory` values should be removed from their current cluster.
        *   Merge neighboring clusters if they come within a predefined proximity threshold.
        *   Split clusters that become too large (exceed a maximum node count).

3.  **Semantic Zoom:**
    *   Monitor the map’s zoom level.
    *   At low zoom levels (map is far out):
        *   Display only the `representativeLabel` for each `Cluster`. This reduces visual clutter.
        *   Simplify label text (e.g., shorten names, use abbreviations).
    *   At high zoom levels (map is close in):
        *   Display all `LabelNode` objects within each `Cluster`.
        *   Display full label text.

4.  **Label Representative Selection:**
    *   Within each `Cluster`, calculate an `importanceScore` for each `LabelNode` (based on external data or internal heuristics).
    *   Select the `LabelNode` with the highest `importanceScore` as the `representativeLabel` for display at low zoom levels.

**III. System Components:**

*   **Clustering Engine:** Responsible for executing the clustering algorithms.
*   **Zoom Manager:** Monitors map zoom level and triggers adjustments to label display.
*   **Data Integration Module:** Fetches external data (e.g., popularity ratings) to enhance `importanceScore` calculations.
*   **Rendering Engine:** Responsible for rendering labels on the map, respecting cluster boundaries and zoom level settings.

**Pseudocode (Zoom Manager):**

```
function onZoomLevelChanged(zoomLevel) {
  if (zoomLevel < thresholdLow) {
    // Display only representative labels
    for each cluster in clusters {
      display cluster.representativeLabel at cluster.centroid
    }
  } else if (zoomLevel > thresholdHigh) {
    // Display all labels
    for each cluster in clusters {
      for each labelNode in cluster.labelNodes {
        display labelNode at labelNode.position
      }
    }
  } else {
    // Intermediate zoom level - display labels with adjusted detail
    // (e.g., shorten text, use smaller font size)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simply orienting labels to dynamically grouping and simplifying them based on both spatial proximity *and* semantic meaning. The “semantic zoom” feature addresses the problem of label clutter at different map scales, providing a more informative and user-friendly experience.  This differs from the patent’s focus on individual label rotation by creating a dynamic, context-aware labeling system.
