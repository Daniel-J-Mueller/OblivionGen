**Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Personalized Audio Profiles**

**Concept:** Extend the automatic input device selection to create localized acoustic zones within a conference space, tailoring audio capture and playback to individual participant positions and preferences. This moves beyond simply *selecting* a better input to actively *shaping* the audio environment.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 mics) integrated into each participant's workstation or a distributed network of directional microphones covering the conference space.
    *   Small, directional speakers (beamforming capable) integrated into each workstation, or a distributed network of similar speakers throughout the space.
    *   Real-time audio processing unit (DSP/FPGA) per workstation/zone, networked to a central control unit.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Zone Creation:** System automatically detects participant positions using microphone array data (time difference of arrival, beamforming). Defines "acoustic zones" â€“ roughly spherical areas around each participant. Overlap is allowed, but minimized.
    2.  **Personalized Audio Profiles:** Each participant creates/imports a profile specifying preferred audio characteristics:
        *   EQ settings (bass, treble, midrange).
        *   Noise cancellation level.
        *   Voice enhancement settings (clarity, fullness).
        *   Preferred input device (if manually overridden).
    3.  **Input Prioritization & Mixing:**
        *   Algorithm dynamically prioritizes audio inputs *within* each zone. It doesn't just pick the "best" mic; it *mixes* audio from multiple microphones, weighting them based on signal quality, proximity to the speaker, and noise levels.
        *   If a participant is speaking, their microphone is prioritized; others are suppressed.
        *   Background noise is actively identified and reduced within each zone.
        *   Utilize machine learning to determine which input devices should be prioritized.
    4.  **Beamforming & Spatial Audio:**
        *   Direct audio from prioritized speakers into their respective zones using beamforming.
        *   Spatial audio rendering to create a more immersive and natural conference experience.
    5.  **Zone Adjustment:** System continuously monitors participant movement and adjusts zone boundaries in real-time.
    6. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the thresholds for "poor" audio quality based on the overall ambient noise level in the conference space. This ensures that the system is not overly sensitive in quiet environments and can still function effectively in noisy environments.

*   **Pseudocode (Zone Prioritization):**

```
function prioritizeZoneAudio(zone, participantList):
  zoneAudio = []
  for participant in participantList:
    if participant in zone:
      micSignal = getMicrophoneSignal(participant)
      audioQuality = assessAudioQuality(micSignal)
      zoneAudio.append((micSignal, audioQuality))

  // Sort by audio quality (descending)
  zoneAudio.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  // Select top N signals (e.g., 2)
  selectedSignals = [signal for signal, quality in zoneAudio[:2]]

  // Mix the selected signals with appropriate weighting
  mixedSignal = mixAudioSignals(selectedSignals)

  return mixedSignal
```

*   **Future Considerations:**
    *   Integration with facial recognition to identify speakers and prioritize their audio.
    *   AI-powered noise cancellation to remove specific types of noise (e.g., keyboard clicks, paper rustling).
    *   Support for multiple languages with real-time translation.
    *   Haptic feedback to indicate when a participant is being prioritized or muted.
    *   "Quiet Zone" functionality to create dedicated spaces for focused work or private conversations.
