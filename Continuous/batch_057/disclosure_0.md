## Dynamic Authorization Context Synthesis

**Concept:** Expand the static identification of authorization contexts within a request handler to a system that *synthesizes* contexts on-the-fly, based on observed request patterns and potentially external data sources. This moves beyond simply *identifying* what's used, to *creating* authorization criteria dynamically.

**Specification:**

**1. Context Synthesis Engine (CSE):** A component integrated with the web service request handler.

**2. Observation Module:** Continuously monitors incoming requests, capturing key-value pairs *beyond* the predefined authorization contexts.  These become candidate context elements. This is passive, non-intrusive data collection.

**3. Pattern Recognition Module:** Employs a time-series analysis algorithm (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to identify statistically significant correlations between candidate context elements and successful/failed authorization outcomes. This determines which candidate elements *predict* access control decisions.

**4. Context Policy Generator:** Based on the pattern recognition output, dynamically generates authorization policies. These policies create *new* authorization contexts or modify existing ones.  Policies are expressed as rules: `IF [candidate_context_element] THEN [new_authorization_context]`.

**5. Policy Enforcement Module:**  Integrates with the request authorization component.  Upon receiving a request, the Policy Enforcement Module applies the dynamically generated policies to create a merged authorization context. This merged context is then used for traditional authorization checks.

**6. Feedback Loop:** Monitors the performance of dynamically generated contexts (e.g., authorization success rate, false positives).  Adjusts pattern recognition algorithms and policy generation rules to optimize context creation.

**Pseudocode (Policy Enforcement Module):**

```
function enforceAuthorization(request):
  // 1. Extract existing authorization contexts
  existingContexts = request.getAuthorizationContexts()

  // 2. Apply dynamic policies
  dynamicContexts = CSE.applyPolicies(request)  //CSE handles policy application

  // 3. Merge contexts
  mergedContexts = merge(existingContexts, dynamicContexts)

  // 4. Perform standard authorization check
  isAuthorized = authorizationService.checkAccess(mergedContexts, user)

  return isAuthorized
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AuthorizationContext`: Key-value pair representing an authorization attribute.
*   `Policy`: Rule defining how to generate a new context based on input.  (e.g., `IF device_type == "mobile" THEN geolocation_risk = "high"`)
*   `RequestTelemetry`: Data collected from requests – including candidate context elements.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Observation Module must be carefully designed to avoid performance bottlenecks. Sampling can be employed.
*   The Pattern Recognition Module requires a sufficient volume of data to generate accurate policies.  A ‘warm-up’ period is necessary.
*   Security considerations are paramount. Access to modify dynamic policies must be strictly controlled.  Audit trails are required.
*   Potential use cases include adapting authorization rules based on user behavior, device characteristics, or geographic location.
