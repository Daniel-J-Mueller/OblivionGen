## Adaptive Granularity Compression with Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts compression granularity based on predicted data access patterns and solid-state drive (SSD) characteristics. This goes beyond segment-based compression by incorporating prefetching strategies tied to compression levels.

**Core Concept:** The patent focuses on compressing segments based on boundaries and page sizes. This expands on that by *predicting* which segments are most likely to be accessed soon and applying lighter (faster) compression to those, while heavily compressing less frequently accessed data. This is coupled with predictive prefetching of the lightly compressed data to minimize latency.

**Components:**

*   **Data Access Predictor:** An AI/ML model trained on database workload patterns (query logs, access timestamps, data relationships). Output: Probability of access for each data segment within a defined timeframe.
*   **Compression Granularity Manager:** Dynamically divides data into variable-size segments. Segment size is determined by:
    *   Data Access Predictor output (higher probability = smaller segment)
    *   SSD erase block size (align segments to erase blocks for write efficiency)
    *   Data type & entropy (complex data = smaller segments to maximize compression)
*   **Adaptive Compression Engine:**  Supports multiple compression algorithms (LZ4, Zstd, etc.) and compression *levels* for each algorithm. Algorithm/level selection is based on segment size and predicted access probability.  Higher probability = faster algorithm/lower level.
*   **Prefetching Module:**  Uses the Data Access Predictor and compression level information to proactively prefetch lightly compressed segments into SSD DRAM cache or a dedicated prefetch buffer.
*   **Writeback Manager:**  Intelligently manages writeback of modified segments, prioritizing lightly compressed segments for faster write speeds.

**Pseudocode (Compression Granularity Manager):**

```
function determineSegmentSize(dataSegment, accessProbability, dataType):
    if accessProbability > thresholdHigh:
        segmentSize = minSegmentSize // Small, fast access
        compressionLevel = low
    elif accessProbability > thresholdMedium:
        segmentSize = mediumSegmentSize
        compressionLevel = medium
    else:
        segmentSize = largeSegmentSize // Large, infrequent access
        compressionLevel = high

    //Adjust for data type & entropy. Complex types favor smaller segments.

    return segmentSize, compressionLevel
```

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** SSD with DRAM cache, sufficient CPU cores for compression/decompression, high-bandwidth memory.
*   **Software:** Database management system integration, data access prediction model, compression engine, prefetching module, writeback manager.
*   **Data Structures:** Segment metadata (size, compression level, access probability, location), prefetch queue.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond static or boundary-based compression by *actively* predicting access patterns and adapting compression strategy *in real-time*. The prefetching module minimizes the performance penalty of compression by proactively loading frequently accessed data.  It moves from compression as a cost-saving measure to an *optimization* strategy.
