## Dynamic Key Sharding with Temporal Metadata

**Concept:** Extend the compound key generation to incorporate temporal (time-based) sharding *within* the clustering key itself. This enables more granular control over data locality and efficient pruning during queries, especially in time-series or rapidly changing datasets.

**Specification:**

1.  **Temporal Granularity Selection:**  Define a configurable granularity level (e.g., milliseconds, seconds, minutes, days) for temporal sharding. This setting applies globally or per-table.

2.  **Timestamp Integration:**  When storing data, extract the relevant timestamp. Convert the timestamp into a sharding key component. This component will be incorporated *within* the compound clustering key.

3.  **Clustering Key Structure:**  The compound clustering key will be structured as follows: `[Temporal Shard ID]_[Primary Clustering Key Component]_[Secondary Clustering Key Component]â€¦`

    *   **Temporal Shard ID:** Calculated from the timestamp based on the configured granularity.  This ID determines which 'shard' within the clustering key space the data will be routed to.
    *   **Primary/Secondary Clustering Key Components:**  Existing clustering key values as defined in the referenced patent.

4.  **Dynamic Shard Adjustment:**  Implement a background process that monitors data distribution across temporal shards. If a shard becomes overloaded or underutilized, dynamically adjust the granularity level or re-shard data to balance load. This could involve migrating data between shards.

5.  **Query Optimization:**  When a query includes a time range, the query planner will utilize the temporal shard IDs to efficiently prune irrelevant shards, significantly reducing I/O and improving query performance.

6.  **Reverse Temporal Sharding:** Support the option to store data in reverse temporal order *within* a shard for specific use cases (e.g., audit trails where recent events are prioritized).  Implement a 'reverse order' flag at the table level. This requires generating a modified temporal shard ID (e.g., `MAX_TIMESTAMP - timestamp`) and adjusting data storage accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Clustering Key Generation):**

```
function generate_compound_clustering_key(data, table_config):
  timestamp = data.timestamp
  granularity = table_config.temporal_granularity
  reverse_order = table_config.reverse_order

  if reverse_order:
    max_timestamp = get_max_timestamp() // System-wide max timestamp
    temporal_shard_id = calculate_shard_id(max_timestamp - timestamp, granularity)
  else:
    temporal_shard_id = calculate_shard_id(timestamp, granularity)

  primary_key_component = data.primary_key
  secondary_key_component = data.secondary_key

  compound_clustering_key = temporal_shard_id + "_" + primary_key_component + "_" + secondary_key_component
  return compound_clustering_key

function calculate_shard_id(timestamp, granularity):
  // Example: If granularity is 'minute', divide timestamp by 60000 (milliseconds)
  shard_id = floor(timestamp / granularity)
  return shard_id
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased metadata storage (for shard ID).
*   Potential need for more I/O bandwidth to handle increased sharding complexity.

**Use Cases:**

*   Time-series data (sensor readings, stock prices).
*   Audit logs.
*   Event tracking.
*   Any application where data is heavily indexed by time.
