## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Load Balancing

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a system where data shards aren’t statically assigned, but dynamically re-allocated based on *predicted* query load. This moves beyond simply splitting a partition and routing data; it anticipates *where* the data will be needed most.

**II. Components:**

*   **Load Prediction Engine (LPE):** A machine learning model trained on historical query patterns, time-series data, and application metadata.  The LPE predicts future query load for different data segments. Input features include:
    *   Timestamp/Time-of-Day
    *   Query Type (read/write, aggregate, specific fields accessed)
    *   User/Application ID
    *   Data Segment (based on primary key ranges or hashing)
*   **Shard Manager (SM):** Responsible for managing the physical location of data shards.  It receives load predictions from the LPE and adjusts shard assignments accordingly.
*   **Data Replication Module (DRM):** Maintains multiple copies of shards to support dynamic relocation and ensure high availability.
*   **Query Router (QR):** Directs queries to the appropriate shard(s) based on current shard assignments.  Must be updated in near-real-time with shard location changes.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Prediction:** The LPE continuously analyzes query patterns and predicts future load for different data segments.
2.  **Shard Adjustment:** The SM receives load predictions. If a data segment’s predicted load exceeds a threshold, the SM initiates a shard relocation.
3.  **Data Movement:** The DRM initiates replication of the shard to a new node with available capacity.  Once replication is complete, the DRM switches read/write access to the new node.  The old node's shard is decommissioned or repurposed.
4.  **Routing Update:** The QR receives updates from the SM regarding shard location changes.  It dynamically adjusts query routing to direct queries to the new shard location.

**IV. Pseudocode (Shard Adjustment Algorithm - SM):**

```pseudocode
function adjustShards(loadPredictions):
  for each dataSegment in loadPredictions:
    predictedLoad = loadPredictions[dataSegment]
    currentShardLocation = getShardLocation(dataSegment)
    currentLoad = getCurrentLoad(currentShardLocation)

    if predictedLoad > highLoadThreshold and predictedLoad > currentLoad:
      //Find a target node with sufficient capacity
      targetNode = findTargetNode(predictedLoad)

      if targetNode != null:
        //Initiate shard replication to targetNode
        replicateShard(dataSegment, targetNode)

        //Update shard location mapping
        updateShardLocation(dataSegment, targetNode)

        //Decommission shard from original node
        decommissionShard(dataSegment, originalNode)
```

**V.  Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Sharding:** Moves away from reactive sharding (splitting a partition after it’s overloaded) to a proactive approach based on *predicted* load.
*   **Dynamic Allocation:**  Shards aren’t statically assigned but are dynamically relocated to optimize performance.
*   **Integration with ML:** Leverages machine learning to predict query load and drive sharding decisions.
