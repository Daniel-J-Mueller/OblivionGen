## Adaptive Browser Persona System

**Concept:** Expand the ‘high risk operation’ detection beyond simple signature matching to proactively tailor the browsing experience based on predicted user intent and perceived threat level, creating dynamic “browser personas”.

**Specifications:**

**I. Persona Definitions:**

*   **Secure Persona:** Minimal JavaScript execution, strict content security policies, limited plugin access, focuses on text and static images.  Suitable for highly sensitive tasks (banking, medical records).
*   **Balanced Persona:** Standard browsing experience with moderate JavaScript and plugin access. Default persona.
*   **Unrestricted Persona:** Full JavaScript execution, unrestricted plugin access, suitable for trusted websites and developer testing.
*   **Ephemeral Persona:** A temporary, sandboxed browsing session that resets after each browsing session. All data is discarded.

**II. Intent Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** URL, domain, content type, referrer, user browsing history, time of day, location (optional, user consent required).
*   **Processing:** Machine learning model trained on a large dataset of website characteristics and user behavior.  Outputs a probability score for each persona.
*   **Model Features:** Website category (e.g., finance, news, social media), website reputation (based on third-party data), content analysis (keywords, sentiment), user interaction patterns.

**III. Threat Level Assessment:**

*   **Real-time Analysis:** During page loading, the server-side browser analyzes JavaScript code for potentially malicious behavior (e.g., obfuscation, attempts to access sensitive APIs).
*   **Signature Database:** Maintain a database of known malicious scripts and patterns.
*   **Heuristic Analysis:** Identify suspicious code based on behavioral characteristics (e.g., excessive network requests, attempts to modify system settings).
*   **Risk Score:**  Assign a risk score based on real-time analysis and signature matching.

**IV. Dynamic Persona Switching:**

*   **Automatic Switching:** Based on intent prediction and threat level, the system automatically switches between personas.
*   **Manual Override:**  Users can manually select a persona for specific websites or browsing sessions.
*   **Persona Profiles:**  Users can create custom persona profiles with specific settings and preferences.

**V. Communication Protocol**

*   **Client-Server Communication:** Client-side browser sends intent signal (URL, history) to server.
*   **Server Response:** Server returns suggested persona and risk score.
*   **Client Implementation:** Client configures server-side browser to operate within the selected persona.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function browse(url) {
  sendIntent(url); // Send URL & history to server
  receivePersona(persona, riskScore); // Receive recommended persona & risk score
  configureServerBrowser(persona); // Apply persona settings to server browser
  loadPage(url); // Load the page using the configured server browser
}

function configureServerBrowser(persona) {
  if (persona == "Secure") {
    disableJavaScript();
    enableContentSecurityPolicy();
    restrictPlugins();
  } else if (persona == "Unrestricted") {
    enableJavaScript();
    disableContentSecurityPolicy();
    enablePlugins();
  } // ... other personas
}
```

**VI.  Server-Side Adaptations**

*   Implement persona-specific rendering pipelines.
*   Develop a dynamic content sanitization engine to remove or modify potentially malicious code based on the selected persona.
*   Implement a robust logging and monitoring system to track persona usage and identify potential security threats.
