## Dynamic Model Stitching with Active Learning Feedback

**Concept:** A system for automatically composing and refining machine learning models during training and inference by dynamically stitching together smaller, specialized models (modules) based on real-time performance feedback and active learning principles.

**Inspiration:** The patent discusses modifying jobs and parameters during training. This system takes that concept further, building models *from* modifications, automatically. Instead of just changing a hyperparameter, it assembles a new model architecture on the fly.

**System Specs:**

*   **Module Library:** A repository of pre-trained or trainable modules, each specializing in a particular sub-task or data characteristic (e.g., image edge detection, sentiment analysis, specific data type handling). Modules expose defined input/output interfaces.
*   **Composition Engine:** The core of the system. This engine dynamically assembles modules into a coherent pipeline based on incoming data and feedback.
*   **Performance Monitor:** Tracks the performance of the assembled pipeline on each data instance. Metrics include accuracy, latency, resource usage, and confidence scores.
*   **Active Learning Loop:** This component drives the dynamic composition.
    *   **Uncertainty Sampling:** Identifies data instances where the current pipeline exhibits high uncertainty (e.g., low confidence score).
    *   **Module Exploration:** Explores different module combinations and configurations for the uncertain instances. This could involve a genetic algorithm, reinforcement learning, or a rule-based system.
    *   **Pipeline Update:**  Updates the pipeline architecture based on the results of the module exploration. This involves adding, removing, or re-configuring modules.
*   **Data Stream Interface:** Accepts real-time data streams as input.
*   **Model Registry:** Stores all composed models and their performance metrics.

**Pseudocode (Composition Engine - simplified):**

```
function compose_pipeline(data_instance, current_pipeline):
  if current_pipeline is null:
    # Initial pipeline: Start with a basic module.
    current_pipeline = create_basic_module()
    return current_pipeline

  # Pass data through the current pipeline
  output = execute_pipeline(current_pipeline, data_instance)

  # Check performance of current pipeline
  performance = evaluate_performance(output, expected_output)

  if performance < threshold:
    # Explore alternative modules
    alternative_modules = find_alternative_modules(data_instance)

    best_module = select_best_module(alternative_modules, data_instance)

    # Update the pipeline
    new_pipeline = replace_module(current_pipeline, best_module)
    return new_pipeline

  else:
    return current_pipeline
```

**Innovation Details:**

*   **Automatic Architecture Search:** The system automatically discovers optimal model architectures for specific data streams. No manual model design is required.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The model adapts to changes in the data stream in real-time. It can handle concept drift and evolving data patterns.
*   **Resource Optimization:** The system can select modules that are optimized for specific resource constraints (e.g., latency, memory usage).
*   **Explainability:** The modular architecture makes it easier to understand the model's decision-making process.  Each module's function is explicit.
*   **Modularity & Reuse:** Modules can be reused across different applications and data streams, reducing development time and cost.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time fraud detection
*   Dynamic pricing optimization
*   Personalized content recommendation
*   Autonomous driving
*   Robotics
*   Medical diagnostics.
