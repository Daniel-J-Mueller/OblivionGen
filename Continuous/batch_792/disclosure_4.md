## Dynamic Packet Payload Sharding & Reassembly

**Concept:** Extend the fast/exception path framework to dynamically shard packet payloads *across* fast path nodes, and reassemble them at a designated point, enabling parallel processing of individual payload segments. This overcomes resource limits by distributing workload, and allows for selective processing of payload sections.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Payload Sharder/Reassembler Module (PSRM).  Deployed as a configurable stage within the packet processing pipeline.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `sharding_policy`: Defines how the payload is split (e.g., fixed size chunks, content-aware splitting based on delimiters, entropy-based).
    *   `shard_count`: Number of shards to create.  May be dynamically adjusted.
    *   `reassembly_point`:  Network address/identifier of the reassembly destination. Could be another fast path node or the exception path target.
    *   `reassembly_timeout`: Duration to wait for all shards before discarding the packet.
    *   `payload_metadata_encryption_key`: Key used to encrypt payload metadata carried with each shard.
*   **Shard Structure:** Each shard contains:
    *   `shard_index`: Integer representing the shard's position in the original payload.
    *   `total_shards`: Total number of shards for this packet.
    *   `payload_segment`: The actual segment of the payload.
    *   `metadata`: Additional data relevant to the shard, such as timestamps, processing flags, or error codes.
    *   `checksum`: Checksum of the payload segment.
*   **Fast Path Node Behavior:**
    1.  Upon receiving a packet, the fast path node checks if sharding is enabled in the pipeline configuration.
    2.  If enabled, the payload is split according to the `sharding_policy`.
    3.  Each shard is encapsulated with the `shard_index`, `total_shards`, `payload_segment`, `metadata`, and `checksum`.
    4.  Each shard is forwarded to a different fast path node (or the same node, with parallel processing).  Routing can be based on a hash of the `shard_index` to ensure even distribution.
*   **Reassembly Node Behavior:**
    1.  Receives shards.
    2.  Buffers shards based on `shard_index`.
    3.  Verifies checksums.
    4.  Once all shards are received (or the timeout is reached), the shards are reassembled in the correct order to reconstruct the original payload.
    5.  The reconstructed packet is forwarded to the next stage in the pipeline.

**Pseudocode (Reassembly Node):**

```
function reassemble_packet(packet):
    shard_index = packet.shard_index
    total_shards = packet.total_shards
    payload_segment = packet.payload_segment
    checksum = packet.checksum
    
    if verify_checksum(payload_segment, checksum) == False:
        log_error("Checksum verification failed for shard " + shard_index)
        return
    
    if shard_buffer[shard_index] == null:
        shard_buffer[shard_index] = payload_segment
    else:
        log_error("Duplicate shard received for index " + shard_index)
        return

    if all shards received:
        reconstructed_payload = concatenate(shard_buffer)
        original_packet = create_packet(reconstructed_payload)
        forward_packet(original_packet)
        clear_shard_buffer()
```

**Novelty:**  Traditional fast/exception paths deal with *entire* packets. This extends the concept to shard and process *parts* of packets in parallel, unlocking significantly higher throughput and enabling processing that exceeds the resource limits of a single node. The dynamic sharding policy and selective payload processing add a layer of flexibility.  This is different than simple TCP segmentation; it happens *within* the service, potentially before any network transmission.
