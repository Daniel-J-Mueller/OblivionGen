## Modular Electronic Device with Bio-Integrated Haptics

**Concept:** An electronic device – building on the general form factor implied by the reference – featuring a modular construction and incorporating bio-integrated haptic feedback. This isn't just vibration; it's subtle muscle stimulation to *simulate* texture and weight.

**Modules:**

*   **Core Module:** Houses the processor, battery, and primary connectivity. Roughly palm-sized, slightly curved for ergonomics. Material: Bio-compatible polymer composite with internal graphene heat dissipation.
*   **Display Module:** Flexible OLED display that can be magnetically attached to the core. Multiple sizes and aspect ratios available.
*   **Sensor Module:** Variety of sensors (environmental, biometric, etc.) housed in a separate module. Snap-on connection.
*   **Haptic Module:** This is the core innovation. A series of micro-actuators capable of delivering localized, low-intensity electrical muscle stimulation (LEMS) directly through the device housing to the user’s hand. The intensity and pattern of stimulation would be controlled by software, simulating the feel of different textures, weights, or even shapes.

**Haptic System Specs:**

*   **Actuator Type:** Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) based LEMS actuators.
*   **Density:** 100 actuators per square centimeter on the contact surface of the device.
*   **Stimulation Frequency:** 1-200 Hz, adjustable via software.
*   **Stimulation Amplitude:** 0.1 - 1 mA, user-adjustable with safety limits.
*   **Power Consumption:** < 50mW per actuator.
*   **Safety Features:**
    *   Skin impedance monitoring to prevent excessive current flow.
    *   Automatic shutoff if impedance drops below a threshold.
    *   User-adjustable intensity limits.
*   **Software Control:** API for developers to create haptic effects linked to on-screen content or real-world data. 
    *   Haptic "shaders" – programmable patterns of stimulation.
    *   Integration with machine learning algorithms to predict optimal stimulation patterns for different textures and materials.

**Pseudocode for Haptic Shader Generation:**

```
function generateHapticShader(textureMap, roughness, intensity):
  // textureMap: 2D array representing texture (e.g., grayscale image)
  // roughness: Scale factor for texture variations
  // intensity: Overall haptic strength

  hapticPattern = new 2D array(textureMap.width, textureMap.height)

  for x = 0 to textureMap.width - 1:
    for y = 0 to textureMap.height - 1:
      pixelValue = textureMap[x][y]
      stimulationFrequency = baseFrequency + (pixelValue * frequencyScale)
      stimulationAmplitude = baseAmplitude + (pixelValue * amplitudeScale) * roughness * intensity

      // Apply safety limits to amplitude
      if stimulationAmplitude > maxAmplitude:
        stimulationAmplitude = maxAmplitude
      
      hapticPattern[x][y] = {frequency: stimulationFrequency, amplitude: stimulationAmplitude}

  return hapticPattern
```

**Materials:**
