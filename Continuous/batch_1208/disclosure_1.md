## Dynamic Acoustic Mapping & Localization System

**System Overview:** A system leveraging the smart floor tiles not just for location *detection*, but for highly detailed acoustic environment mapping and object localization via sound triangulation. The premise is to augment the existing electrical/communication infrastructure of the smart floor tiles with high-frequency microphones and dedicated signal processing.

**Core Components:**

*   **Enhanced Smart Floor Tile:**
    *   Integrated Microphone Array: Each tile contains 4-8 high-frequency (ultrasonic or >20kHz) microphones, arranged strategically to maximize sound capture and directional analysis.
    *   Dedicated Signal Processor: A small, low-power DSP embedded within each tile. This handles initial signal processing: noise filtering, amplification, and feature extraction (e.g., time-of-flight, frequency analysis).
    *   Acoustic Beacon Support: Each tile can also *emit* controlled ultrasonic pulses, acting as an acoustic beacon. This is for scenarios where objects don't naturally emit sound, or for calibration.
*   **Central Processing Unit (Server):**  Receives processed acoustic data from all tiles.  Performs triangulation, noise reduction, and object identification.
*   **Data Transmission Protocol:** Modified communication protocol to handle high-frequency acoustic data alongside existing tile identifier/electrical characteristic data.

**Operation:**

1.  **Sound Event Detection:** Each tile listens for sound events. Any sound detected triggers local signal processing.
2.  **Time-of-Flight Measurement:** The DSP calculates the time it takes for the sound to reach multiple tiles.  This generates a set of Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) measurements.
3.  **Triangulation:** The server receives the TDoA data from multiple tiles.  Using a triangulation algorithm, it calculates the 3D location of the sound source.
4.  **Sound Source Identification:**  Machine learning algorithms on the server analyze the characteristics of the sound (frequency, amplitude, pattern) to identify the sound source (e.g., human voice, falling object, equipment malfunction).
5.  **Acoustic Mapping:** The system continuously builds a detailed acoustic map of the environment, identifying noise sources, reverberation zones, and potential acoustic hazards.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Triangulation):**

```
FUNCTION TriangulateSoundSource(tileDataArray)

    // tileDataArray is an array of data from each tile, including:
    //  - tile ID
    //  - TDoA measurements to other tiles
    //  - Signal strength

    // Filter out unreliable TDoA measurements (e.g., low signal strength)

    // Initialize potential source location (e.g., average of tile positions)

    // Iterate until convergence (or max iterations reached):

    //   For each tile:
    //     Calculate the difference between the predicted arrival time of the sound
    //     and the actual arrival time.

    //   Adjust the potential source location based on these differences,
    //   using an optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent).

    RETURN estimatedSoundSourceLocation
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Locate the source of alarms or unusual sounds.
*   **Automated Inventory Management:** Track objects based on the sounds they make.
*   **Facility Monitoring:** Detect equipment malfunctions based on their acoustic signatures.
*   **Occupancy Monitoring:** Determine the number of people in a room based on voice activity.
*   **Assistive Technology:** Help visually impaired individuals navigate by providing acoustic cues.
