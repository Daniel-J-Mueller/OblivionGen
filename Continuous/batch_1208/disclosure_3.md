**Adaptive Message Prioritization & Selective Recording**

**Concept:** Enhance the reliability system by introducing dynamic message prioritization coupled with selective recording based on receiver ‘interest’ profiles. Instead of all recorders holding all messages, recorders specialize in subsets of message types.

**Specs:**

*   **Message Metadata:** Each message will include a “priority” field (0-100) and a list of “interest tags”.
*   **Receiver Profiles:** Each receiver maintains a profile listing its “interest tags” and a “minimum acceptable priority”.
*   **Recorder Specialization:** Recorders are assigned (or dynamically discover) specific “interest tag” sets. A recorder only persistently stores messages matching its assigned tags.
*   **Priority-Based Delivery:** Senders initially transmit messages with a calculated priority (based on source, content type, etc.).
*   **Selective Transmission:** Before transmission, the system checks if *any* recorder with matching “interest tags” is active. If not, the message is dropped or queued for later re-attempt (with potentially reduced priority). This prevents unnecessary network load.
*   **Recorder Acknowledgement with Tag Data:**  Recorders acknowledge receipt not just by message ID, but also by confirming the received “interest tags”. This allows senders to understand which recorders are storing which message types.
*   **Hole Filling – Tag-Aware Requests:** When a receiver requests a missing message, it includes its “interest tags”. The request is then broadcast (or multicast) only to recorders with matching tags.
*   **Dynamic Recorder Assignment:**  A management component dynamically assigns recorders to tag sets based on network load, recorder capacity, and receiver demand.
*   **Recorder Health Monitoring:** Monitor recorder availability and tag coverage. If tag coverage drops below a threshold, the system automatically reassigns tags.

**Pseudocode (Receiver Hole Filling):**

```
function requestMissingMessage(messageSequenceNumber, interestTags):
  broadcastRequest(sequenceNumber, interestTags)

function handleBroadcastRequest(sequenceNumber, interestTags):
  if (recorderInterestTags contains interestTags):
    if (messageExists(sequenceNumber)):
      sendResponse(sequenceNumber, "Message Available")
    else:
      sendResponse(sequenceNumber, "Message Not Available")

function handleResponse(sequenceNumber, availability):
  if (availability == "Message Available"):
    requestMessage(sequenceNumber)
  else:
    // Retry with another recorder or escalate
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased processing power for tag matching and dynamic recorder assignment.
*   Sufficient storage capacity for recorder specialization.
*   Reliable network connectivity for recorder communication.
*   A centralized management component (potentially cloud-based) to orchestrate recorder assignments and monitor system health.
