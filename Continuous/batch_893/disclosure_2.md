## Dynamic Query Expansion via Affective Analysis

**Concept:** Augment search queries *not* with semantic similarity, but with inferred user emotional state gleaned from interaction data. The premise is that a userâ€™s *feeling* while searching significantly impacts their ideal results, often in ways semantic analysis misses.

**Specs:**

1.  **Affective Data Stream:**  Integrate with client-side systems to capture real-time user interaction data:
    *   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Capture typing speed, pauses, error rates.
    *   **Mouse Movement:** Track speed, hesitation, erratic patterns.
    *   **Scroll Behavior:** Analyze speed, stopping points, back-and-forth motion.
    *   **Dwell Time:** Measure time spent on individual search results.
    *   **Facial Expression Analysis (Optional):**  If user grants permission, utilize webcam to analyze micro-expressions.

2.  **Affective Model:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) to map interaction data to emotional states.  Classes:
    *   Frustrated
    *   Confused
    *   Satisfied
    *   Neutral
    *   Curious

3.  **Query Modification Engine:** Based on detected emotional state, dynamically modify the search query:

    *   **Frustrated:**  Broaden the query. Add more general terms. Reduce specificity. Prioritize results with high click-through rates, even if lower relevance scores. *Pseudocode:* `query = broaden(query, 0.5)` where `broaden()` adds related, higher-level concepts.
    *   **Confused:** Add clarifying terms. Append "explain," "tutorial," or "beginner's guide."  Increase the weight of long-form content (articles, guides). *Pseudocode:* `query = append(query, "explain")`
    *   **Satisfied:** Narrow the query. Add more specific terms. Increase weight of expert-level content. *Pseudocode:* `query = refine(query, 0.8)` where `refine()` adds specific keywords.
    *   **Curious:** Add exploratory terms.  Append "vs," "alternatives," "comparison." Return diverse result sets. *Pseudocode:* `query = append(query, "alternatives")`

4.  **Adaptive Weighting:** The weighting of the affective modifications should be *adaptive*, based on user feedback. If a user consistently ignores the emotionally-modified results, decrease the weighting. If they consistently engage, increase the weighting.

5.  **A/B Testing:** Continuously A/B test the emotionally-modified searches against standard searches, measuring engagement metrics (click-through rate, dwell time, conversion rate).

6. **Privacy Considerations**: All affective data must be anonymized and aggregated. Users must explicitly consent to data collection. A clear opt-out mechanism must be provided.
