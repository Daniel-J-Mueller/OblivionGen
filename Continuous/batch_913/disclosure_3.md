## Acoustic Event "Echo Mapping" for Spatial Audio Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the acoustic event detection system to not just *detect* events but to actively *map* the acoustic environment, creating a dynamic, localized soundscape. This builds on the proximity detection in the patent but moves beyond simple model selection to spatial audio rendering.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array integrated into each audio-input device (minimum 4, optimally 8+).
    *   High-precision Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning module in each device (or access to a similar accurate location service).
    *   Edge processing capability in each input device for initial signal processing and data reduction.
*   **Software – Core Components:**
    *   **Acoustic Source Localization Module:** Utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) algorithms on the multi-microphone array data to pinpoint the 3D location of sound events. Requires calibration data specific to each input device's microphone array.
    *   **Echo Mapping Engine:** Constructs a dynamic map of the acoustic environment by associating localized sound events with their spatial coordinates. The map is a probabilistic representation, accounting for signal reflections and noise.
    *   **Sound Event Classification Refinement:**  Leverages the spatial data. Instead of solely relying on acoustic signatures, the *location* of the sound event contributes to its classification. (e.g., a “door knock” sound emanating from a doorway location is more likely to *be* a door knock.)
    *   **Spatial Audio Renderer:**  Takes the Echo Map data and renders a localized 3D audio experience for the user. This is done by dynamically adjusting the volume, panning, and equalization of sound events based on their spatial location relative to the user.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Audio-input devices continuously capture audio and location data.
    2.  Each device performs initial signal processing and sends processed data (features, TDoA, AoA, location) to a central server or edge computing cluster.
    3.  The Acoustic Source Localization Module triangulates sound event locations.
    4.  The Echo Mapping Engine builds and updates the 3D acoustic map.
    5.  The Spatial Audio Renderer generates the localized audio experience and delivers it to the user’s listening device (headphones, speakers).
*   **Pseudocode (Echo Mapping Update):**

```
FUNCTION UpdateEchoMap(soundEvent, locationData, currentMap)

    //soundEvent = { eventType: "door_knock", features: [...] }
    //locationData = { x: 1.2, y: 3.5, z: 0.8, confidence: 0.9 }
    //currentMap = { [x,y,z] : {eventType: "speech", lastDetected: timestamp} }

    IF locationData.confidence > threshold THEN
        //Add/Update the sound event in the map
        currentMap[locationData.x, locationData.y, locationData.z] = {
            eventType: soundEvent.eventType,
            lastDetected: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            features: soundEvent.features
        }
    ENDIF

    // Decay old entries (remove if lastDetected is too old)
    FOR EACH entry IN currentMap
        IF CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - entry.lastDetected > DECAY_TIME THEN
            DELETE entry FROM currentMap
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    RETURN currentMap
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Novelty:** Moves beyond event *detection* to full environment *mapping*, enabling localized audio experiences. This allows for features like:
    *   Enhanced AR/VR experiences with spatially accurate soundscapes.
    *   Intelligent noise cancellation that focuses on specific sound sources.
    *   Accessibility features for visually impaired users (spatial audio cues).
    *   Advanced security systems (detecting the *location* of a breaking window).
