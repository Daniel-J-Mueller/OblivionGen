## Dynamic Credential Drift & Entropy

**Concept:** Expand upon the credential management system by introducing a controlled “credential drift” mechanism, coupled with entropy injection. Instead of simply activating/deactivating credentials, credentials are subtly *modified* over time, increasing the difficulty of compromise even if a credential is exposed. This builds upon the existing system’s focus on mapping credentials to resources, but moves beyond simple on/off states.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Credential Entropy Pool:** A cryptographic entropy source (e.g., hardware random number generator, system noise) is utilized to create a pool of subtle credential modifiers. These modifiers are not complete replacements, but small changes - a slight shift in an encoded value, a minor addition to a key derivation function, or a time-based skew.

2.  **Drift Rate Configuration:**  Each customer (or resource group) has a configurable “drift rate.” This rate determines how frequently and how significantly credentials are modified. Higher rates increase security but can impact application compatibility if not managed carefully.

3.  **Credential Modification Engine:**  A dedicated engine monitors active credentials and applies modifications according to the configured drift rate and entropy pool. Modifications are applied incrementally, ensuring minimal disruption to legitimate access.

4.  **Drift Vector Tracking:** Each credential has an associated "drift vector" – a record of all modifications applied to it. This vector is crucial for validating access attempts.

5.  **Access Validation with Drift:** When a virtual computing resource attempts to authenticate, the system:
    *   Retrieves the credential and its drift vector.
    *   Applies the drift vector to a baseline credential.
    *   Compares the resulting credential against the presented credential.

    Pseudocode:

    ```
    function validate_credential(presented_credential, baseline_credential, drift_vector)
    {
        modified_credential = apply_drift(baseline_credential, drift_vector);
        if (compare_credentials(modified_credential, presented_credential))
        {
            return TRUE;
        }
        else
        {
            return FALSE;
        }
    }

    function apply_drift(baseline_credential, drift_vector)
    {
        // Iterate through drift_vector entries
        for each entry in drift_vector:
            modification_type = entry.type;
            modification_value = entry.value;

            if (modification_type == "add_skew"):
                modified_credential = modified_credential + modification_value;
            else if (modification_type == "shift_bits"):
                // Apply bit shift operation
                modified_credential = bit_shift(modified_credential, modification_value);
            // ... other modification types
        return modified_credential;
    }
    ```

6.  **Credential Revocation Enhancement:**  When a resource is deprovisioned, in addition to deactivating credentials, the system can *accelerate* credential drift, rendering any compromised credentials quickly unusable.

7.  **Policy Integration:** Drift rates and modification types can be governed by security policies, allowing for granular control over credential security levels.  For example, critical resources might have higher drift rates and more complex modification schemes.

8.  **Auditing:** All credential modifications are logged for auditing and forensic analysis.

9.  **Backward Compatibility:** The system must support a grace period for older applications that haven’t been updated to handle drifted credentials. This could involve temporarily serving baseline credentials alongside drifted credentials.
