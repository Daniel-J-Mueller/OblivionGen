## Autonomous Network Anomaly Prediction & Pre-Correction System

**System Overview:** This system anticipates network failures *before* they occur by leveraging machine learning models trained on real-time and historical network data. It proactively adjusts network configurations to mitigate predicted issues, minimizing downtime and optimizing performance. It expands upon the topology validation concept by moving beyond *detecting* current state to *predicting* future state.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Data Collection Module:** Gathers data from various network sources:
    *   Network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) – utilizing SNMP, NetFlow, sFlow.
    *   Performance monitoring tools – latency, throughput, packet loss.
    *   Log files – error messages, security alerts.
    *   Environmental sensors – temperature, humidity (potential correlation with hardware failures).
    *   Historical data repository – time-series database optimized for network data.

2.  **Feature Engineering Module:** Extracts relevant features from collected data:
    *   Traffic patterns (peak hours, application usage).
    *   Device resource utilization (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
    *   Anomaly scores (based on statistical analysis and machine learning).
    *   Correlation between events (e.g., increased latency following a specific configuration change).

3.  **Prediction Engine:** Utilizes machine learning models to predict potential network issues.
    *   **Model Types:**
        *   **Time-Series Forecasting:** Predicts future resource utilization based on historical data (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unusual patterns that may indicate a problem (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).
        *   **Classification:** Predicts the *type* of failure based on observed patterns (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
    *   **Training & Retraining:** Models are continuously trained and retrained with new data to improve accuracy.
    *   **Confidence Levels:** Assigns confidence levels to predictions to prioritize interventions.

4.  **Pre-Correction Module:**  Proactively adjusts network configurations to mitigate predicted issues.
    *   **Automated Actions:**
        *   **Traffic Re-routing:**  Diverts traffic away from potentially congested or failing links.
        *   **Resource Allocation:**  Increases bandwidth or processing power to critical devices.
        *   **Configuration Updates:**  Applies configuration changes to optimize performance.
        *   **Redundancy Activation:**  Activates redundant devices or links.
    *   **Rollback Mechanism:**  Implements a rollback mechanism to revert changes if they have unintended consequences.
    *   **A/B Testing:**  Performs A/B testing of different pre-correction strategies to identify the most effective approaches.

5.  **Visualization & Reporting Module:** Provides a user interface for monitoring network health, viewing predictions, and reviewing pre-correction actions.
    *   **Real-Time Dashboards:**  Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and alerts.
    *   **Prediction Timeline:**  Visualizes predicted failures and pre-correction actions over time.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:**  Helps identify the underlying causes of network issues.
    *   **Customizable Reports:**  Generates reports on network health, performance, and predictions.



**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predictNetworkIssues(historicalData, realTimeData):
    // Feature Engineering
    features = extractFeatures(historicalData, realTimeData)

    // Load Trained Models
    timeSeriesModel = loadTimeSeriesModel()
    anomalyDetectionModel = loadAnomalyDetectionModel()
    classificationModel = loadClassificationModel()

    // Time-Series Forecasting
    predictedResourceUtilization = timeSeriesModel.predict(features)

    // Anomaly Detection
    anomalyScores = anomalyDetectionModel.predict(features)

    // Classification (Failure Type Prediction)
    predictedFailureType = classificationModel.predict(features)

    // Combine Predictions
    predictions = {
        resourceUtilization: predictedResourceUtilization,
        anomalyScores: anomalyScores,
        failureType: predictedFailureType
    }

    return predictions

function extractFeatures(historicalData, realTimeData):
    // Implement feature extraction logic here
    // (e.g., traffic patterns, device resource utilization, correlation between events)
    features = []
    // ...
    return features

function loadTimeSeriesModel():
    // Load the trained time-series forecasting model
    // (e.g., from a file or database)
    model = ...
    return model
```

**Scalability:** Distributed architecture with microservices for modularity and scalability.  Utilizes message queues (e.g., Kafka) for asynchronous communication between components.
