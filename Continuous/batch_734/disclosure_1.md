## Dynamic Precision Systolic Array

**Concept:** Extend the systolic array concept to incorporate dynamic precision scaling *within* the processing element, adapting to the significance of data being processed. This reduces computational load and power consumption without sacrificing accuracy, especially beneficial for AI/ML workloads.

**Specifications:**

*   **Processing Element (PE) Architecture:**
    *   **Precision Control Unit (PCU):** Integrated within each PE. Receives input data (X-in, Y-in) *and* a precision scaling factor (PSF).
    *   **Variable-Precision Multiplier-Accumulator (MAC):** MAC operates on scaled X-in, Y-in, and weight values. Scaling is applied *before* multiplication.
    *   **Quantization/Dequantization Logic:** Converts data between full precision (e.g., FP32) and scaled integer/fixed-point representations. Optimized for speed and minimal loss.
    *   **Data Significance Detector:** Monitors data magnitude and variance.  Dynamically adjusts the PSF based on identified significance.  (See Pseudocode below)

*   **Inter-PE Communication:**
    *   **PSF Exchange:** Along with data, each PE communicates its calculated PSF to neighboring PEs. This allows for coordinated precision scaling across the array.
    *   **Metadata Channel:** Dedicated channel for PSF and data significance metadata.
    *   **Data Buffering:** Each PE includes small buffers to handle potential delays introduced by precision scaling.

*   **System Control:**
    *   **Global Precision Policy:** Allows for a system-level setting of precision scaling aggressiveness.
    *   **Workload-Specific Profiles:**  The system can store and load precision scaling profiles tailored to different AI/ML models or data types.
    *   **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor precision scaling levels and computational performance across the array.

**Pseudocode (Data Significance Detector):**

```
FUNCTION Calculate_PSF(X_in, Y_in, Weight)

  // Calculate magnitude of inputs and weight
  Magnitude_X = ABS(X_in)
  Magnitude_Y = ABS(Y_in)
  Magnitude_W = ABS(Weight)

  // Calculate Variance (rolling average of squared differences)
  Variance_X = RollingAverage(SQUARE(X_in - Previous_X))
  Variance_Y = RollingAverage(SQUARE(Y_in - Previous_Y))

  // Combine magnitude and variance to determine significance score
  Significance_Score = Magnitude_X * Magnitude_Y * Magnitude_W * (1/ (Variance_X + Variance_Y + 1))

  // Map significance score to PSF.  Lower score -> more aggressive scaling (lower precision).
  IF Significance_Score > Threshold_High THEN
    PSF = 1.0  // Full precision
  ELSE IF Significance_Score > Threshold_Medium THEN
    PSF = 0.5  // Medium precision
  ELSE IF Significance_Score > Threshold_Low THEN
    PSF = 0.25 // Low precision
  ELSE
    PSF = 0.125 // Very low precision
  ENDIF

  RETURN PSF
END FUNCTION
```
