## Dynamic Contextual Indexing & Annotation

**Concept:** Expand indexing beyond simple term frequency and location to incorporate dynamic contextual analysis of the text, creating a richer, more navigable experience, and supporting AI-driven summarization/question answering.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Indexing Enhancement:**

*   **Context Vectors:** During indexing, generate a vector embedding for each sentence or paragraph, representing its semantic meaning. Utilize a pre-trained language model (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) fine-tuned on a corpus relevant to typical ebook content (literature, non-fiction, etc.).
*   **Relationship Graph:** Construct a relationship graph linking context vectors based on semantic similarity. Nodes represent sentences/paragraphs, edges represent similarity scores (cosine similarity of context vectors).
*   **Index Structure:**  Modify the existing item index to include:
    *   Term frequency and location (as before).
    *   Context vector ID (pointer to the context vector in memory).
    *   Neighboring node IDs (pointers to related sentences/paragraphs in the relationship graph).

**2. Dynamic Annotation Layer:**

*   **User-Defined Tags:** Allow users to create and apply tags to any selected text.
*   **AI-Suggested Annotations:** Utilize a named entity recognition (NER) model to automatically suggest tags based on the selected text (e.g., "Character," "Location," "Event").
*   **Annotation Storage:** Store annotations as metadata associated with the corresponding text segment in the index. Include user-defined tags and AI-suggested tags.

**3. Search & Navigation:**

*   **Semantic Search:**  Allow users to search not just by keywords but by *meaning*.  Convert the search query into a context vector and find matching vectors in the index.
*   **Contextual Highlighting:**  Highlight not only the search terms but also semantically related passages based on the relationship graph.
*   **“Explore Related Ideas”:**  Provide a feature to navigate the relationship graph, allowing users to explore passages related to the current selection.
*   **Annotation-Based Filtering:**  Allow users to filter search results and navigation based on applied annotations (e.g., show all passages tagged “Character: Sherlock Holmes”).

**4. Pseudocode (Search):**

```
function semanticSearch(query, index):
  queryVector = generateContextVector(query)
  results = []
  for item in index:
    similarityScore = cosineSimilarity(queryVector, item.contextVector)
    if similarityScore > threshold:
      results.append((item, similarityScore))
  results.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) // Sort by similarity
  return results
```

**5. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased RAM requirement to store context vectors and relationship graph.
*   Potential need for a dedicated GPU for faster vector calculations.
*   Optimized data structures and algorithms for efficient graph traversal.

**6.  Future Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Indexing:**  Adapt the indexing process based on user reading habits and preferences.
*   **Cross-Book Analysis:**  Extend the relationship graph across multiple ebooks to identify thematic connections and patterns.
*   **AI-Driven Summarization:**  Utilize the relationship graph to generate concise and informative summaries of complex texts.
