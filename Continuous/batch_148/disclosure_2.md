## Dynamic Contextual Item Bundling & Anticipatory Display

**Concept:** Expand upon the complementary item suggestion system by introducing *anticipatory display* based on predicted user needs, and dynamic bundling that adjusts in real-time based on user interaction and external data feeds.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core System – Anticipatory Bundling Engine (ABE)**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User purchase history (as in the source patent).
    *   Real-time user context (location, time of day, weather, calendar events - with user permission).
    *   External data feeds (social media trends, news events, seasonal data, product stock levels).
    *   Item attribute database (detailed tags beyond basic categorization - materials, use cases, aesthetic qualities).
*   **Prediction Model:** A hybrid model combining collaborative filtering (user-to-user similarity), content-based filtering (item attribute matching), and contextual analysis (external data).  Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model sequential purchase behavior and predict future needs.
*   **Bundling Logic:**  
    *   Generate a “need score” for each item based on prediction model output.
    *   Dynamically bundle items with high need scores, prioritizing those that complement previously purchased or currently viewed items.
    *   Introduce “soft bundles” - suggestions that aren't rigidly fixed, allowing users to easily swap items.

**II. User Interface – Adaptive Complementary Display (ACD)**

*   **Display Format:** Instead of a strict vertical alignment, employ a “dynamic grid” layout. Complementary items are displayed in tiles surrounding the primary item. Tile size and prominence are determined by the “need score.”
*   **Interaction Model:**
    *   **Hover/Touch:** Highlight tiles, revealing details and user reviews.
    *   **Drag & Drop:** Allow users to rearrange the grid, indicating their preference.
    *   **“Complete the Bundle” Button:** Automatically adds all suggested items to the cart.
*   **“Surprise Me” Feature:** Generate a completely random bundle based on user preferences and current context, encouraging discovery.
*   **Augmented Reality (AR) Integration:**  For physical products, allow users to visualize the bundle in their environment using AR. (e.g., a camping bundle displayed in their backyard).

**III. System Architecture – Modular Design**

*   **Microservices:** Decompose the system into independent microservices:
    *   Prediction Service
    *   Bundling Service
    *   Data Ingestion Service
    *   UI Rendering Service
*   **API Gateway:** Provide a unified API for accessing the system.
*   **Message Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ):** Enable asynchronous communication between microservices.
*   **Database:** Utilize a graph database (Neo4j) to represent relationships between items and users.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Service):**

```
function predict_next_item(user_id, current_item_id, context_data):
    user_history = get_user_purchase_history(user_id)
    item_attributes = get_item_attributes(current_item_id)
    context_features = extract_features(context_data)

    # Combine features and feed into RNN model
    input_data = [user_history, item_attributes, context_features]
    predicted_item_id = RNN_model.predict(input_data)

    return predicted_item_id
```

**Pseudocode (Bundling Service):**

```
function generate_bundle(user_id, current_item_id):
    predicted_items = []
    for i in range(5): # Generate top 5 recommendations
        item_id = predict_next_item(user_id, current_item_id, get_current_context())
        predicted_items.append(item_id)

    bundle = [current_item_id] + predicted_items
    return bundle
```

**Novelty:**  This expands beyond simple complementary item suggestion to proactive bundle creation based on predictive modeling and real-time context. The dynamic UI and AR integration further enhance the user experience.  The microservices architecture enables scalability and maintainability.
