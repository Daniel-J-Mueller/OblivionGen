## Dynamic Resolution Streaming with Predictive Layering

**Concept:** Extend the remote object rendering concept to dynamically stream image layers at varying resolutions *based on predicted user focus*. This builds on the idea of partial image rendering, but instead of simply ignoring requests due to network conditions, proactively shifts rendering priority to areas the user is likely to be viewing.

**Specs:**

*   **Client-Side Eye/Gaze Tracking:** Integrate (or leverage existing) eye/gaze tracking hardware/software to estimate user focus point within the rendered scene. This doesnâ€™t require precise tracking; a general region of interest is sufficient.
*   **Scene Decomposition:** Divide the 3D scene into hierarchical tiles or regions. Higher levels represent larger areas, lower levels are finer-grained.
*   **Layered Rendering:** Render the scene in multiple layers, prioritizing based on predicted user focus. Layers closer to the focus point receive the highest initial resolution. Distant or obscured areas receive lower resolutions or are initially omitted.
*   **Predictive Streaming:** Implement a predictive algorithm that estimates future focus points based on user movement, scene dynamics, and historical gaze data. Pre-render/stream layers for predicted focus areas.
*   **Dynamic Resolution Adjustment:** Continuously monitor network conditions and adjust layer resolution and streaming priority accordingly. If bandwidth is limited, reduce resolution of peripheral layers or delay streaming of less important areas.
*   **Client-Side Compositing:** The client device receives layered image data and composites it into a final image.  This allows for flexible blending, transparency effects, and dynamic adjustments.
*   **Server-Side Responsibilities:** The server manages rendering requests, prioritizes rendering based on client-provided focus data, and streams layered image data.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
scene_decomposition = load_scene_decomposition()
eye_tracker = initialize_eye_tracker()

loop:
    focus_point = eye_tracker.get_focus_point()
    predicted_focus = predict_next_focus(focus_point, scene_dynamics)

    // Determine rendering priority based on focus
    priority_regions = calculate_priority_regions(predicted_focus, scene_decomposition)

    // Request layers based on priority
    request_layers(priority_regions)

    // Receive and composite layers
    received_layers = receive_layers()
    final_image = composite_layers(received_layers)

    display(final_image)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Eye/Gaze tracking hardware/software.
*   High-bandwidth network connection.
*   Graphics processing unit (GPU) for client-side compositing.
*   Server infrastructure capable of handling multiple rendering requests and streaming layered image data.
