## Dynamic Endpoint Sharding via Executable ‘Stubs’

**Specification:** A system for dynamically sharding service endpoints based on client-side executable 'stubs' retrieved via a URI scheme similar to the one outlined in the provided patent. However, instead of resolving to a single endpoint, the system aims to distribute load and improve latency by selecting *multiple* endpoints concurrently.

**Components:**

*   **URI Scheme:** `service://<service_id>?action=<action_id>&shard_preference=<preference>`
*   **Shard Preference:** An integer value (0-100) indicating the client’s preference for prioritizing certain shards (e.g., geographically closer shards, shards with lower reported latency).
*   **Stub Generator:** A service responsible for compiling and deploying minimal executable ‘stubs’ based on the `action_id`. These stubs contain logic to connect to multiple potential service endpoints (shards).
*   **Shard Registry:** A dynamic registry containing information about available service shards, their capabilities, current load, and geographical location.
*   **Client-Side Executor:** The environment on the client machine that executes the downloaded stubs.
*   **Load Balancer/Orchestrator:** System component responsible for coordinating shard selection and execution of the client-side stubs.

**Workflow:**

1.  A client initiates a request using the `service://` URI.
2.  The request is intercepted by a routing service (similar to the one in the provided patent).
3.  The routing service determines the appropriate Stub Generator based on the `action_id`.
4.  The Stub Generator compiles a minimal executable stub containing connection logic for multiple potential service shards. This stub also includes a method to evaluate shard health.
5.  The stub is delivered to the client.
6.  The client-side executor runs the stub.
7.  The stub queries the Shard Registry for available shards.
8.  The stub evaluates shard health metrics (latency, load).
9.  Based on shard health and the `shard_preference` value, the stub selects a *subset* of shards to connect to *concurrently*.
10. The stub distributes the request across the selected shards.
11. The stub aggregates the responses and returns a single result to the client.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Stub):**

```
function execute(uri):
  action_id = extract_action_id(uri)
  shard_preference = extract_shard_preference(uri)

  shard_registry = query_shard_registry()

  eligible_shards = filter_shards(shard_registry, action_id)

  // Evaluate shards based on latency/load/preference
  scored_shards = score_shards(eligible_shards, shard_preference)

  // Select top N shards (e.g., N=3)
  selected_shards = select_top_n(scored_shards, 3)

  // Launch concurrent requests to selected shards
  results = launch_concurrent_requests(selected_shards)

  // Aggregate results (handle failures, timeouts, etc.)
  aggregated_result = aggregate_results(results)

  return aggregated_result
```

**Innovation:** This approach shifts the load balancing logic *to the client side*, enabling more fine-grained control and potentially reducing server-side load. The use of minimal executable stubs allows for quick deployment and adaptation to changing service topologies.  The `shard_preference` parameter provides a mechanism for clients to influence shard selection based on their specific needs (e.g., prioritize nearby servers for low latency). This is a significant departure from traditional server-side load balancing. It enables complex shard selection logic to be executed on client hardware, which could lead to faster response times and more efficient resource utilization.
