## Dynamic Content Fingerprinting with Perceptual Hashing & Blockchain Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend the web page monitoring system to not just detect pixel differences, but to *fingerprint* dynamic content areas using perceptual hashing, and then anchor those hashes on a blockchain for tamper-proof verification. This moves beyond simple visual change detection to content integrity monitoring.

**Specs:**

**1. Perceptual Hash Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Rendered image of a designated "dynamic region" (identified via configuration â€“ e.g., a specific div ID or CSS selector).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Reduce image size to a standard dimension (e.g., 32x32 pixels).  This ensures consistent hash generation regardless of initial image size.
    2.  Convert to grayscale.
    3.  Apply Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to the grayscale image.
    4.  Retain only the lowest frequency DCT coefficients (e.g., the top-left 8x8 block). These coefficients capture the overall structure and are less sensitive to minor changes.
    5.  Calculate the average of the retained DCT coefficients.
    6.  For each retained coefficient, compare it to the average. If the coefficient is greater than the average, set a bit in the hash. Otherwise, clear the bit. This creates a binary hash (e.g., a 64-bit hash).
*   **Output:**  A perceptual hash value representing the content of the dynamic region.

**2. Blockchain Anchoring Module:**

*   **Input:** Perceptual hash value, timestamp.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Construct a transaction containing the perceptual hash and timestamp.
    2.  Submit the transaction to a selected blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, a private permissioned blockchain).
    3.  Record the transaction ID (TxID) as proof of anchoring.
*   **Output:** TxID representing the anchoring of the perceptual hash on the blockchain.

**3. Monitoring System Integration:**

*   **Initial Setup:**
    1.  Configure the system to identify dynamic regions on monitored web pages.
    2.  Capture initial renderings of the dynamic regions and generate perceptual hashes.
    3.  Anchor these initial hashes on the blockchain.
*   **Ongoing Monitoring:**
    1.  Periodically capture renderings of the dynamic regions.
    2.  Generate perceptual hashes for the current renderings.
    3.  Retrieve the previously anchored hash from the blockchain using the TxID.
    4.  Compare the current hash to the anchored hash.
    5.  If the hashes differ, flag a potential content change.
    6.  Anchor the new hash on the blockchain.

**4. Alerting & Reporting:**

*   **Alert:** If a content change is detected, generate an alert with:
    *   Timestamp of the change
    *   TxID of the new anchored hash
    *   Link to the blockchain transaction explorer
    *   Screenshot of the changed region (for visual verification)
*   **Reporting:** Provide a dashboard to:
    *   View historical content changes
    *   Track the integrity of dynamic content over time
    *   Generate reports on content drift and potential security threats.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function monitorDynamicContent(webpageURL, dynamicRegionSelector) {
  initialHash = generatePerceptualHash(captureDynamicRegion(webpageURL, dynamicRegionSelector));
  initialTxID = anchorHashOnBlockchain(initialHash);

  while (true) {
    currentHash = generatePerceptualHash(captureDynamicRegion(webpageURL, dynamicRegionSelector));

    if (currentHash != retrieveHashFromBlockchain(initialTxID)) {
      alert("Content change detected!");
      newTxID = anchorHashOnBlockchain(currentHash);
      updateInitialTxID(newTxID); // For next comparison
    }
    sleep(monitoringInterval);
  }
}
```

This system goes beyond simple pixel comparisons, providing a more robust and tamper-proof method for monitoring dynamic web content. The use of perceptual hashing reduces sensitivity to minor visual changes, while blockchain anchoring ensures the integrity of the monitoring data.
