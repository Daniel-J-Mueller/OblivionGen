## Dynamic Content Stitching for Shared Experiences

**Concept:** Extend share recommendations beyond single images to create short, automatically generated "experience" snippets – mini-stories – tailored to the recipient based on contextual data.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Inputs:**

*   **Image/Video Library:** Access to user’s digital media.
*   **Geolocation Data:** Current location of sharing user AND recipient (if permissible/available). Historical location data for both.
*   **Time/Date:** Current timestamp, and timestamps associated with media.
*   **Social Graph:** Relationship data between sharing user, recipient, and entities *within* the media (identified via image/video analysis - faces, landmarks, objects).
*   **Event Data:** Calendar/scheduled events associated with the sharing user *and* recipient. External event data (local concerts, sports events) relevant to location.
*   **Media Metadata:** Existing tags, descriptions, and captions.

**II. Processing Pipeline:**

1.  **Contextual Analysis:** Analyze the above data inputs to establish a “relevance score” between potential media snippets and the recipient. This includes:
    *   **Proximity Score:** Based on current/historical geolocation data. Higher score for shared locations.
    *   **Temporal Score:**  Media created *around* the time of a shared event or significant date (birthday, anniversary).
    *   **Relationship Score:** Media featuring people/places significant to the recipient (based on social graph).
    *   **Event Correlation:** Media relevant to current/upcoming events.
2.  **Snippet Selection:** Select 3-5 media snippets with the highest combined relevance score. Prioritize variety (photos, videos, short clips).
3.  **Dynamic Stitching:**
    *   **Automated Editing:**  Automatically trim videos to short, engaging segments (5-10 seconds).
    *   **Transitions:** Apply smooth transitions between snippets (crossfades, wipes).
    *   **Music/Sound Effects:**  Dynamically select background music or sound effects to match the mood/content of the snippets.  (AI-generated music based on visual content).
    *   **Text Overlays:**  Generate short, contextually relevant captions for each snippet (e.g., "Remember this beach?", "Celebrating with friends!"). AI-generated captions.
4.  **Experience Output:**  Create a short video "experience" (15-30 seconds).  Output formats:
    *   Native mobile video format (for easy sharing).
    *   Link to cloud-hosted video.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
function create_experience(sharing_user, recipient) {

  // 1. Gather Data
  data = gather_data(sharing_user, recipient);

  // 2. Calculate Relevance Scores
  scored_media = calculate_relevance_scores(data);

  // 3. Select Snippets
  selected_snippets = select_top_snippets(scored_media, num_snippets=5);

  // 4. Stitch Experience
  experience = stitch_snippets(selected_snippets);

  // Add AI generated music/sound if desired

  // 5. Output Experience
  output_experience(experience, format="mobile_video");

  return experience;
}

function calculate_relevance_scores(data) {
  // Calculate proximity, temporal, relationship, event correlation scores
  // Combine scores into a single relevance score for each media item
  return scored_media;
}

function stitch_snippets(snippets) {
  // Trim videos
  // Apply transitions
  // Add captions
  // Combine into a single video
  return stitched_video;
}
```

**IV. User Interface Integration:**

*   Share button displays “Create Experience” option in addition to traditional sharing.
*   Preview of automatically generated experience before sending.
*   Option for user to manually edit snippets, transitions, and captions.

**V. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Collaborative Experiences:**  Allow multiple users to contribute snippets to a shared experience.
*   **AR/VR Integration:**  Create immersive experiences using augmented or virtual reality.
*   **Personalized Themes:**  Allow users to customize the look and feel of their experiences with different themes and effects.
