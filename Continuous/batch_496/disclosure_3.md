## Variable Geometry Ducted Fan System

**Concept:** A propulsion system employing multiple, concentrically arranged ducted fans with independently adjustable duct geometries. This allows for dynamic alteration of thrust vectoring, efficiency, and noise profile *without* relying solely on differential propeller speeds or complex gimbal systems.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Unit:** A central, fixed-geometry ducted fan providing primary lift/thrust. Diameter: 200mm.  Blade count: 8. Material: Carbon fiber reinforced polymer.
*   **Variable Geometry Rings (x3):** Concentrically mounted around the core unit. Each ring consists of multiple (12-24) independently actuated segments.
    *   **Material:** Shape memory alloy (Nickel-Titanium) overlaid with a durable polymer coating.
    *   **Actuation:** Each segment is controlled by a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric preferred) allowing for precise positional adjustments.
    *   **Range of Motion:** Each segment can articulate +/- 15 degrees relative to the nominal ring plane.
    *   **Ring Diameters:** 250mm, 300mm, 350mm.
*   **Blade Design (Variable Geometry Rings):** Shorter, wider blades optimized for high static thrust at lower rotational speeds. Blade count: 6 per ring. Material: Carbon fiber reinforced polymer.
*   **Motors:** High-efficiency brushless DC motors for each fan stage. Independent speed control for each ring and the core unit.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Sensors:** IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), GPS, Airspeed sensor.
    *   **Processor:** Dedicated embedded processor capable of real-time control and sensor fusion.
    *   **Algorithm:** PID control loops for each fan stage, coupled with a higher-level trajectory planning algorithm. Thrust vectoring achieved by dynamically adjusting the geometry of the variable rings.
*   **Power System:** High-density lithium polymer batteries.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL):** All fans operate at full speed. Variable rings adjust to provide stable lift and control.
2.  **Forward Flight:** Core unit provides primary thrust. Variable rings modulate airflow to optimize efficiency and reduce drag.  Ring geometries can be adjusted to create a ‘virtual nozzle’ effect, enhancing directional control.
3.  **Agility Mode:** Variable rings actively adjust to enhance maneuverability. Rapid changes in ring geometry create asymmetrical thrust vectors, enabling quick turns and evasive maneuvers.
4.  **Quiet Mode:** Reduce fan speeds and optimize ring geometries to minimize noise generation. Utilize acoustic dampening materials within the ducts.

**Pseudocode (Thrust Vectoring Algorithm):**

```
// Inputs: desired_thrust_vector (x, y, z), current_thrust_vector, IMU data
// Outputs: segment_angles (array of angles for each ring segment)

function calculate_segment_angles(desired_thrust_vector, current_thrust_vector, imu_data) {

    error_vector = subtract(desired_thrust_vector, current_thrust_vector);
    
    // Calculate required thrust vector adjustments
    adjustment_x = error_vector.x;
    adjustment_y = error_vector.y;
    adjustment_z = error_vector.z;

    // Map adjustments to ring segment angles
    for (each segment in ring1, ring2, ring3) {
        segment.angle = calculate_angle(segment.position, adjustment_x, adjustment_y, adjustment_z);
    }

    // Apply IMU feedback to stabilize the system
    apply_imu_correction(segment_angles, imu_data);

    return segment_angles;
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simple thrust vectoring via gimbaled props. It allows for continuous, dynamic adjustment of airflow around the UAV, creating a highly adaptable and efficient propulsion system. It enables a unique combination of high maneuverability, efficiency, and reduced noise.
