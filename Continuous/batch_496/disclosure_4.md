## Acoustic Projection Mapping via Dynamic Mesh Deformation

**Concept:** Extend the audio output capabilities of the portable speaker by integrating a deformable mesh exterior capable of localized vibration, effectively 'projecting' sound in specific directions or creating complex acoustic patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Exterior Mesh:** Constructed from a flexible, high-tensile polymer with embedded piezoelectric actuators.  Actuators are arranged in a dense grid across the entire exterior surface.  Mesh density: 20 actuators per square centimeter.
*   **Actuator Control:** Each actuator is individually addressable via a dedicated microcontroller unit (MCU). MCU connected to the primary audio processing unit via high-bandwidth digital interface (e.g., I2S, TDM).
*   **Acoustic Modeling Software:** Software running on the primary processor analyzes incoming audio signals, identifies frequency components, and generates actuator control patterns to shape the sound waves.  This includes beamforming, directional audio, and spatial audio effects.
*   **Microphone Array:** Integrated microphone array (minimum 4 microphones) for acoustic feedback analysis and real-time adjustment of actuator control patterns. This will dynamically calibrate the system.
*   **Haptic Integration:** The mesh can also produce localized vibrations providing a haptic feedback system for notifications, alerts, or enhanced gaming experiences.
*   **Power Supply:** Requires a dedicated high-current power supply to drive the piezoelectric actuators.  Utilize a fast-charging battery optimized for peak current delivery.
*   **Deformation Range:** Actuators capable of controlled deformations up to 5mm.
*   **Software API:** A comprehensive software API enabling developers to create custom acoustic effects and integrate with third-party applications.
*   **Modes of Operation:**
    *   *Omnidirectional:* Standard speaker operation.
    *   *Directional Beamforming:* Focus audio to a specific location.
    *   *Spatial Audio:* Create a 3D soundscape.
    *   *Haptic Feedback:* Utilize mesh vibrations for notifications.
    *   *Acoustic Camouflage:*  Minimize sound leakage in specific directions.
*   **Material Requirements:** Mesh material to exhibit low internal damping and high structural rigidity to maximize energy transfer from the actuators. Polymer must withstand tens of thousands of cycles without fatigue.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Beamforming):**

```
// Input: Audio signal, target direction (azimuth, elevation)
function beamform(audio_signal, target_azimuth, target_elevation) {

  // Calculate phase delays for each actuator based on target direction
  for each actuator in actuator_array {
    distance = calculate_distance(actuator_location, listener_location);
    phase_delay = (distance / speed_of_sound) * frequency;
  }

  // Apply phase shifts to audio signal for each actuator
  for each actuator in actuator_array {
    shifted_signal = apply_phase_shift(audio_signal, phase_delay);
    send_signal_to_actuator(actuator_id, shifted_signal);
  }
}
```

**Refinement:** The system may incorporate machine learning algorithms to learn optimal actuator control patterns based on user preferences and environmental conditions.  Further research into novel materials with enhanced piezoelectric properties will be beneficial.
