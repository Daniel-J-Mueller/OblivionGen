## Dynamic Content 'Layers' & Predictive Rendering

**Concept:** Extend the formatting instruction system to allow content providers to define 'layers' of content, each optimized for different device capabilities *and* predicted user interaction.  This goes beyond simply swapping an image for a table; it's about preparing multiple content versions in advance, anticipating how a user will *engage* with the content, and seamlessly delivering the most appropriate version.

**Specs:**

*   **Layer Definition:** Content providers define layers within their content.  A layer is a complete alternative representation of a segment of the content – text, image, interactive element, video, etc. Layers are tagged with:
    *   **Device Capability Flags:** Screen size, resolution, processing power, network bandwidth, supported codecs, accessibility features.
    *   **Interaction Profiles:** Predicted user actions – scrolling speed, zoom level, tap frequency, typical interaction patterns for this content type (e.g., a map expects panning/zooming, a novel expects page turns). These could be learned from aggregated user data (anonymized, of course).
    *   **Rendering Priority:** Defines the order layers are considered for rendering.
*   **Predictive Rendering Engine:** The client device (or intermediary server) incorporates a predictive rendering engine.
    *   **Device Attribute Collection:**  Gathers device attributes (screen size, CPU, memory, network).
    *   **User Behavior Tracking:** Monitors user interaction *in real-time* (scrolling speed, zoom level, tap frequency).  A limited history is maintained.
    *   **Layer Selection Algorithm:**
        1.  Filters available layers based on device capabilities.
        2.  Scores remaining layers based on current user behavior and predicted behavior (using historical data and interaction profiles).  A weighted scoring system is used.
        3.  Selects the highest-scoring layer for rendering.
*   **Content Delivery Mechanism:**
    *   Initial content delivery includes a 'manifest' file that describes the available layers for each content segment. The manifest is lightweight.
    *   Layers are downloaded on-demand, based on layer selection. Caching is crucial.
    *   Seamless layer switching: The rendering engine must be able to switch between layers without visible interruption.

**Pseudocode (Layer Selection Algorithm):**

```
function selectLayer(contentSegment, deviceAttributes, userBehaviorHistory) {
  availableLayers = getAvailableLayers(contentSegment) // From manifest
  filteredLayers = filterLayersByDevice(availableLayers, deviceAttributes)

  scoredLayers = []
  for each layer in filteredLayers {
    score = 0
    // Device Capability Score
    score += calculateDeviceScore(layer.deviceCapabilities, deviceAttributes)

    // User Behavior Score
    score += calculateUserScore(layer.interactionProfile, userBehaviorHistory)

    scoredLayers.add(layer, score)
  }

  // Sort by score (highest first)
  sortedLayers = sortLayers(scoredLayers)

  return sortedLayers[0] // Return the highest-scoring layer
}
```

**Example Use Case:**

An interactive map.

*   **Layer 1 (High-End Device):**  High-resolution vector map with detailed 3D buildings, real-time traffic data, and smooth animations.
*   **Layer 2 (Mid-Range Device):**  Lower-resolution vector map with simplified 3D buildings, static traffic data, and reduced animations.
*   **Layer 3 (Low-End Device):**  Raster map with minimal detail and no animations.
*   **Layer 4 (Predictive – Fast Zoom):** If the user rapidly zooms in, a pre-rendered tile set for that zoom level is delivered.
*   **Layer 5 (Predictive – Panning):** If the user is rapidly panning, pre-rendered tiles for the anticipated pan direction are delivered.
