## Conditional Data Shadowing & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the FSR functionality to not only return the failing item's state but also proactively create a "shadow" copy of the data item *before* the conditional operation is attempted.  Furthermore, leverage these shadow copies for predictive failure analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Copy Generation:**

*   **Trigger:** When a transaction includes a conditional operation with an FSR indicator set, *before* executing the condition check, the database system creates a complete, timestamped copy of the data item. This is the "shadow copy."
*   **Storage:** Shadow copies are stored in a dedicated, high-speed storage tier (e.g., in-memory cache, SSD). Storage duration is configurable (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days, indefinite).
*   **Metadata:**  Each shadow copy includes metadata:
    *   Transaction ID
    *   Timestamp of creation
    *   User/Application ID initiating the transaction
    *   FSR indicator status (true/false)
    *   Condition expression (the actual conditional check used)
*   **Versioning:** If multiple transactions attempt conditional operations on the same item within the shadow copy retention period, maintain multiple shadow copies, representing the item’s state at each attempt.

**2. Enhanced Error Response:**

*   In the event of a condition failure *and* FSR indicator set, the error response includes:
    *   The failing item’s current state.
    *   A pointer/reference to the *most recent* shadow copy created *prior* to the failure.
    *   The condition expression that triggered the failure.

**3. Predictive Failure Analysis Engine:**

*   A separate engine continuously analyzes shadow copy data.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify patterns of condition failures. For example, if a particular condition consistently fails for a specific data item or within a certain timeframe, it may indicate a data quality issue or underlying system problem.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Use machine learning models to predict potential condition failures based on historical shadow copy data and current transaction patterns.  Features include:
    *   Data item attributes
    *   Condition expression complexity
    *   Time of day/week
    *   User/Application initiating the transaction
*   **Automated Alerts:** Generate alerts when the predictive model identifies a high probability of a condition failure.  Alerts include details about the predicted failure (data item, condition, probability).

**4. API Extensions:**

*   **`GET /shadows/{itemId}`:** Retrieve all shadow copies for a given item ID.  Filter options: `timestamp`, `transactionId`.
*   **`POST /analyze/{itemId}`:** Trigger an ad-hoc analysis of shadow copies for a given item ID.  Returns a report of failure patterns and predicted risk.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Analysis Engine:**

```
function analyzeShadowCopies(itemId):
  shadows = database.getShadowCopies(itemId)
  if shadows is empty:
    return "No shadow copies found for item " + itemId

  failureEvents = []
  for shadow in shadows:
    if shadow.failureEvent:
      failureEvents.append(shadow)

  if failureEvents is empty:
    return "No failure events found for item " + itemId

  // Extract features from failure events (e.g., data item attributes, condition complexity)
  features = extractFeatures(failureEvents)

  // Use trained machine learning model to predict future failure probability
  prediction = mlModel.predict(features)

  return prediction
```

**Novelty:** This extends the FSR concept from simple failure reporting to proactive analysis and prediction, enabling preventative maintenance and data quality improvements. The creation of shadow copies provides a "time machine" for understanding failure causes and predicting future issues.  Existing systems focus on immediate error handling; this focuses on *preventing* errors before they happen.
