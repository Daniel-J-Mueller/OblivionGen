## Acoustic Resonance Mapping for Human Presence & Localization

**Core Concept:** Utilize subtle shifts in room acoustic resonance – induced by human presence – detectable via wireless signal phase shifts, to enhance presence detection and localization accuracy beyond traditional channel state information (CSI) analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array (integrated into Wireless RX/TX):** A small, low-power microphone array (4-8 microphones) integrated into existing wireless devices (RX/TX). These microphones aren't for direct audio capture, but for measuring minute pressure variations in the air caused by sound reflection alterations.
*   **High-Resolution Phase Shift Detector:** Dedicated hardware within the wireless device to measure phase shifts in the received wireless signal *and* the acoustic signal captured by the microphone array. Resolution: < 1 degree.
*   **Low-Power DSP:** Digital Signal Processing unit for real-time acoustic feature extraction and data pre-processing.

**2. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Acoustic Resonance Profile Generation:**
    *   During initial system setup (calibration phase), the system generates a baseline acoustic resonance profile for each room/space. This involves emitting a controlled, low-frequency sweep tone and analyzing the resulting sound field using the microphone array. Captures room geometry effects on sound.
    *   This baseline is stored locally on each wireless device.
*   **Real-time Acoustic Feature Extraction:**
    *   Continuously monitor changes in room acoustic resonance using the microphone array. Features extracted:
        *   **Resonance Frequency Shift:** Detect changes in the dominant resonance frequencies. Human presence alters the effective room volume/shape, shifting these frequencies.
        *   **Amplitude Variation:** Measure changes in the amplitude of resonance peaks. Humans absorb sound energy.
        *   **Phase Coherence:** Evaluate the coherence of sound waves arriving at different microphones. Human presence introduces scattering and disrupts coherence.
*   **Hybrid Neural Network (HNN):**
    *   Input: CSI data + Acoustic Features (Resonance Frequency Shift, Amplitude Variation, Phase Coherence).
    *   Architecture: A multi-layered neural network trained to:
        *   Distinguish between human-induced acoustic changes and stationary object reflections.
        *   Estimate the human's location based on the combined CSI and acoustic data. Utilizes a weighted combination of inputs. Higher weighting to acoustic changes when they are significant.
*   **Localization Algorithm:**
    *   Triangulation: Uses multiple wireless devices (RX/TX) to triangulate the human’s location. Each device provides an estimated location based on its local acoustic and CSI data.
    *   Kalman Filtering: Implements a Kalman filter to smooth location estimates and reduce noise.

**3. Data Processing Flow:**

1.  Wireless devices continuously capture CSI and acoustic data.
2.  Acoustic features are extracted from the acoustic data using the low-power DSP.
3.  CSI and acoustic features are fed into the HNN.
4.  The HNN outputs a probability map indicating the likelihood of human presence at different locations in the room.
5.  Localization algorithm triangulates the human’s location based on the probability map from multiple devices.
6.  Location and presence data are transmitted to a central server or used locally for smart home/building automation.

**4. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Baseline Update:** Dynamically update the baseline acoustic resonance profile to account for changes in room configuration or environmental conditions.
*   **Multi-Path Interference Mitigation:** Implement algorithms to mitigate the effects of multi-path interference on acoustic signal analysis.
*   **Directional Microphone Arrays:** Utilize directional microphone arrays to improve the accuracy of sound source localization.
