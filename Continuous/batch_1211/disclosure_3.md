## Dynamic Widget Composition via Declarative Rules

**Concept:** Extend the widget system to allow for dynamic widget *composition* based on declarative rules defined by merchants. Instead of the portal service solely *generating* widgets, merchants can define rules specifying how existing widgets, or fragments of widgets, should be combined and presented to the user. This allows for hyper-personalized and contextual payment experiences without requiring extensive coding.

**Specifications:**

**1. Rule Definition Language (RDL):**

*   A JSON-based language for defining widget composition rules.
*   Key elements:
    *   `conditions`: An array of boolean expressions that must evaluate to true for the rule to apply. Conditions can be based on user attributes (e.g., location, purchase history), product attributes (e.g., price, category), or contextual data (e.g., time of day, referring website).
    *   `widget_layout`: A specification of how widgets should be arranged on the page. This could be a simple grid layout, a more complex hierarchical structure, or a free-form arrangement using CSS-like properties.
    *   `widget_variants`: Definitions of specific widget configurations to use within the layout. This allows merchants to select different versions of widgets based on the conditions.
    *   `data_bindings`:  Mappings between data sources (e.g., user profile, product catalog) and widget properties.  This enables dynamic content updates within the widgets.

**Example RDL:**

```json
{
  "rule_id": "premium_customer_plan_options",
  "conditions": [
    { "type": "user_attribute", "attribute": "is_premium_customer", "operator": "=", "value": true },
    { "type": "product_attribute", "attribute": "price", "operator": ">", "value": 100 }
  ],
  "widget_layout": {
    "type": "grid",
    "columns": 2,
    "widgets": [
      {"id": "payment_plan_selector", "position": "top-left"},
      {"id": "loyalty_reward_display", "position": "top-right"}
    ]
  },
  "widget_variants": {
    "payment_plan_selector": {
      "plan_types": ["monthly", "quarterly", "annual"]
    },
    "loyalty_reward_display": {
      "reward_type": "points",
      "points_multiplier": 2
    }
  },
  "data_bindings": {
    "payment_plan_selector.available_plans": "user.preferred_payment_plans",
    "loyalty_reward_display.user_points": "user.loyalty_points"
  }
}
```

**2. Rule Engine:**

*   A component within the portal service responsible for evaluating rules and composing widgets.
*   Input: A set of rules defined by merchants and the current context (user data, product data, etc.).
*   Output: A dynamic widget composition that can be rendered by the web server.
*   Logic:
    *   Iterate through the rules.
    *   Evaluate the conditions for each rule.
    *   If a ruleâ€™s conditions are met, compose the widgets according to the `widget_layout` and `widget_variants` defined in the rule.
    *   Apply the `data_bindings` to populate the widgets with dynamic content.
    *   Prioritize rules based on a defined scoring system (e.g., specificity, relevance).

**3. API Extensions:**

*   New API endpoints for merchants to:
    *   Create, read, update, and delete rules.
    *   Upload and manage widget fragments.
    *   Test rules and preview widget compositions.
*   Enhanced API for the web server to:
    *   Request widget compositions based on the current context.
    *   Receive dynamic widget compositions from the rule engine.

**4. Widget Fragment Library:**

*   A repository of reusable widget fragments that merchants can use to build complex widget compositions.
*   Fragments could include:
    *   Payment form fields
    *   Discount code input
    *   Shipping address selection
    *   Loyalty reward display

**Pseudocode (Rule Engine):**

```
function compose_widget(context, rules, widget_fragments):
  matching_rules = []
  for rule in rules:
    if evaluate_rule(rule, context):
      matching_rules.append(rule)

  # Sort rules by priority (e.g., specificity, relevance)
  sorted_rules = sort_rules(matching_rules)

  composed_widget = {}
  for rule in sorted_rules:
    widget_layout = rule.widget_layout
    for widget_config in widget_layout.widgets:
      widget_id = widget_config.id
      widget_variant = rule.widget_variants[widget_id]
      widget = create_widget(widget_id, widget_variant)
      bind_data(widget, rule.data_bindings, context)
      composed_widget[widget_id] = widget

  return composed_widget
```
