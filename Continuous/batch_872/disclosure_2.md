## Adaptive Quorum with Reputation-Based Filtering

**Concept:** Extend the consensus protocol by introducing a dynamic quorum size and a reputation system for nodes. This isn’t about *preventing* poison pills, but proactively *reducing* their influence by weighting nodes based on past behavior.

**Specification:**

**1. Node Reputation System:**

*   **Metric:** Each node maintains a 'reputation score' initialized to a neutral value (e.g., 50).
*   **Updates:**
    *   **Positive Reinforcement:** When a node proposes a change accepted by the consensus, its reputation increases slightly.
    *   **Negative Reinforcement:** If a node proposes a change rejected by the consensus (especially if a significant number of nodes reject it), its reputation decreases.  The magnitude of the decrease is tied to the severity of the rejection.
    *   **Decay:** Reputation scores decay slowly over time to allow for nodes to rehabilitate.
    *   **Tamper Resistance:**  Reputation data is cryptographically signed and replicated.  Nodes periodically verify reputation data of peers.

**2. Dynamic Quorum Adjustment:**

*   **Weighted Voting:** During consensus, each node's vote is weighted by its reputation score. A higher reputation means a more influential vote.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The quorum size isn't fixed. It dynamically adjusts based on the *aggregate* reputation of participating nodes.
    *   **High Reputation Aggregate:**  If the participating nodes have generally high reputations, the required quorum size can *decrease*. This speeds up consensus when the system is stable.
    *   **Low Reputation Aggregate:** If the participating nodes have generally low reputations (e.g., during a suspected attack), the required quorum size *increases*. This makes it harder for malicious actors to gain consensus.
*   **Quorum Calculation:**
    *   `TotalReputation = Σ (ReputationScore of Node i)` for all nodes participating in the consensus round.
    *   `BaseQuorumSize = N / 2 + 1` (where N is the total number of nodes)
    *   `AdjustmentFactor = TotalReputation / BaseReputation` (BaseReputation is a predetermined baseline reputation for the system).
    *   `DynamicQuorumSize = BaseQuorumSize * AdjustmentFactor`

**3. Pseudocode (Consensus Round – Simplified):**

```pseudocode
function ConsensusRound(proposal):
  nodes = GetParticipatingNodes()
  totalReputation = 0
  for node in nodes:
    totalReputation += node.reputationScore

  adjustmentFactor = totalReputation / baseReputation
  dynamicQuorumSize = baseQuorumSize * adjustmentFactor
  requiredApprovals = ceil(dynamicQuorumSize)

  approvals = 0
  for node in nodes:
    vote = node.Vote(proposal) // Node performs validation checks
    if vote == Approved:
      approvals += node.reputationScore / 100 // Weighted approval
    end
  end

  if approvals >= requiredApprovals:
    AcceptProposal()
  else:
    RejectProposal()
  end
end
```

**4. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Sybil Resistance:** Implement robust Sybil resistance mechanisms to prevent malicious actors from creating a large number of fake nodes with high reputation. (e.g. proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, or trusted identity providers.)
*   **Reputation Transfer:** Potentially allow nodes to "transfer" reputation to other trusted nodes to bootstrap new participants or reward good behavior.
*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** This system is designed to *augment* existing Byzantine Fault Tolerance mechanisms (like Paxos or Raft), not replace them.
