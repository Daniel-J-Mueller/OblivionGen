**Innovation Description:**

This system utilizes a drone platform integrated with a dynamic antenna array for automated inventory management. The drone autonomously navigates a warehouse or storage facility, scanning RFID tags on items. The core innovation is the dynamic antenna array, which utilizes beamforming techniques to optimize RFID signal transmission and reception.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Drone Hardware (Motors, Sensors, RFID Reader, Camera, IMU)
Initialize Antenna Array (64 microstrip antennas)
Load Warehouse Map

// Main Loop
While (Inventory Scan Not Complete) {
  // Navigation
  Plan Path to Next Scan Location (Based on Warehouse Map)
  Execute Path (Using Drone Motors and IMU)

  // RFID Scanning
  // 1. Perform initial broad spectrum RFID scan
  // 2. Tag identification and location mapping.
  // 3. Beamforming Algorithm Activation:
  For Each Tag Detected {
    Calculate Optimal Beamforming Parameters (Antenna Phase and Amplitude)
    Steer RFID Beam Towards Tag Location
    Transmit RFID Signal
    Receive RFID Response
    Verify Tag Data
    Record Tag Location and Data
  }

  // Obstacle Avoidance
  If (Obstacle Detected by LiDAR) {
    Re-Plan Path to Avoid Obstacle
  }

  // Battery Management
  If (Battery Level Low) {
    Return to Docking Station for Charging
  }

}
//Data Upload
Upload Inventory Data to Cloud Server
```

**Novelty:**

Current RFID inventory systems rely on fixed readers or handheld scanners. This system offers:

*   **Autonomous Operation:** Reduces labor costs and increases efficiency.
*   **Dynamic Beamforming:** Optimizes RFID signal strength and coverage, improving read rates and range.
*   **3D Mapping Integration:** Provides accurate tag localization and inventory tracking.
*   **Scalability:** Easily deployed in large warehouses or storage facilities.
