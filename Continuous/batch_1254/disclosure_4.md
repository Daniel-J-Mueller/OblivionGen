**Innovation Description:**

This system extends voxel-based collision detection by dynamically adjusting voxel resolution *based on predicted motion and object density*.  Instead of a uniform voxel size, the system utilizes a multi-resolution voxel grid.  Areas with low object density and/or slow predicted motion are represented with larger voxels. Conversely, areas with high object density and/or fast predicted motion are represented with smaller voxels.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Environmental Mapping:**  Initial 3D map generated using depth sensor.  Object recognition camera populates the map with semantic information (e.g., "chair", "wall", "person").
2.  **Motion Prediction:**  The system predicts the robot's intended trajectory using a combination of planned movements and real-time sensor data (IMU, object tracking).
3.  **Dynamic Voxelization:** The 3D space is divided into voxels. The initial voxel size is a base resolution. This resolution is then *adaptively refined* based on two primary factors:
    *   **Object Density:**  The number of objects within a given volume of space.  Higher density = smaller voxels. This is determined via a spatial partitioning structure (e.g., Octree or KD-tree) operating on the object database.
    *   **Predicted Motion Velocity:** The predicted velocity of the robot within a given volume of space.  Higher velocity = smaller voxels. This is calculated by analyzing the predicted trajectory within the volume.
4.  **Voxel Map Generation:** Area and Movement voxel maps are generated, *but* they aren't static. They are updated *iteratively* based on the dynamic voxel resolution.  Voxels representing occupied space are marked accordingly.
5.  **Collision Detection:** The area voxel map is compared to the movement voxel map using the bitwise logical operations described in the referenced patent.  However, the comparison is performed on the *dynamically updated* voxel maps.
6.  **Iterative Refinement:** If a collision is detected, the system *locally* refines the voxel resolution around the collision point. This allows for more precise collision detection and potentially finding a slightly altered trajectory that avoids the collision.  This refinement process is iterative until a collision-free path is found or a predefined maximum refinement level is reached.
7.  **Trajectory Planning:** A collision-free trajectory is generated based on the refined voxel maps.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function generate_dynamic_voxel_map(environment_data, predicted_trajectory):
  base_voxel_size = 0.1  // meters
  voxel_map = initialize_voxel_map(base_voxel_size)

  for each voxel in voxel_map:
    object_density = calculate_object_density(voxel, environment_data)
    predicted_velocity = calculate_predicted_velocity(voxel, predicted_trajectory)

    voxel_size = base_voxel_size / (object_density * predicted_velocity) // Adaptive scaling

    refine_voxel_resolution(voxel, voxel_size)

    if voxel is occupied:
      mark_voxel_occupied(voxel)

  return voxel_map

function collision_detection(area_map, movement_map):
  result = bitwise_AND(area_map, movement_map)

  if result == 1:
    return collision_detected

  return no_collision

function iterative_refinement(area_map, movement_map, collision_point, max_refinement_level):
  if refinement_level > max_refinement_level:
    return failed

  refine_voxel_resolution_around(collision_point, finer_resolution)

  if not collision_detection(area_map, movement_map):
    return success

  return iterative_refinement(area_map, movement_map, collision_point, refinement_level + 1)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Computational Load:**  By using larger voxels in areas with low complexity, the system reduces the overall computational cost of collision detection.
*   **Improved Accuracy:**  By using smaller voxels in areas with high complexity, the system improves the accuracy of collision detection.
*   **Real-time Performance:**  The combination of reduced computational load and improved accuracy enables real-time collision detection for fast-moving robots.
*   **Adaptability:**  The system can adapt to changing environments and dynamic obstacles.
