## Adaptive Document ‘Ecosystem’ Visualization

**Concept:** Extend the visual diffing and layout features to create a dynamic, interactive ‘document ecosystem’ – a visual representation of a document’s lineage, collaborative history, and related assets.

**Specs:**

1.  **Ecosystem Graph:** Implement a directed graph data structure representing document versions as nodes. Edges represent revisions, branches (e.g., from rollbacks or divergent edits), and relationships to external assets (images, spreadsheets, code files).
2.  **Node Visualization:** Nodes in the graph should dynamically display:
    *   Thumbnail preview of the document version.
    *   Author and timestamp of the revision.
    *   A ‘heat map’ indicating areas of significant change (visual diffing applied to the node).
    *   Icons representing linked external assets.
3.  **Interactive Exploration:**
    *   Users can pan and zoom within the ecosystem graph.
    *   Clicking a node displays the full document version with highlighting of changes relative to its parent node.
    *   Nodes can be filtered and sorted by author, date, or change magnitude.
4.  **‘Time-Slice’ View:** A feature to display all document versions existing at a specific point in time. This would be useful for understanding a document's state during a particular project phase.
5.  **‘Impact Analysis’:**  Selecting a change (identified through visual diffing) highlights all subsequent versions and branches affected by that change.
6.  **Asset Integration:** Automatically detect and visualize relationships between the document and external assets. (e.g., a spreadsheet linked within a report). Changes to the asset should trigger visual updates within the ecosystem graph.
7. **'Ghosting' of Previous Versions:** When viewing a current version, allow the user to selectively 'ghost' previous versions onto the current view, showing the differences in real-time as semi-transparent overlays.
8. **Pseudocode for Ecosystem Graph Generation:**

```pseudocode
function generateEcosystemGraph(documentHistory):
  graph = new Graph()
  for version in documentHistory:
    node = new Node(version.content, version.author, version.timestamp)
    graph.addNode(node)
    if version.parentVersion != null:
      graph.addEdge(version.parentVersionNode, node)

  # Identify external assets and create asset nodes/edges
  for asset in document.assets:
    assetNode = new Node(asset.content, "System", "N/A")
    graph.addNode(assetNode)
    graph.addEdge(document.rootNode, assetNode) # Link to root document

  return graph
```

9.  **Tech Stack:**  Existing visual diffing engine, graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph), front-end framework (React, Vue.js) for interactive visualization.
