## Dynamic Network Topology Reconstruction & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the existing node monitoring system to *actively* reconstruct the network topology based on observed communication patterns, then utilize this reconstructed topology and historical data to predict potential failure points *before* they manifest.

**Specifications:**

**1. Topology Mapping Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw communication data (similar to existing status requests, but potentially with increased granularity â€“ packet-level details if feasible).  Includes source/destination endpoint IDs, timestamps, and transmission success/failure indicators.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a graph theory approach. Nodes represent network endpoints/nodes.  Edges represent observed communication pathways.
    *   Edges are dynamically weighted based on frequency and reliability of communication. A "reliability score" is calculated for each edge.  This score incorporates the historical success rate, latency, and jitter.
    *   Implement a "discovery" process. If a communication path hasn't been actively probed in a defined period, initiate a probe to confirm its existence and recalculate the reliability score.
    *   The graph should be self-healing. Broken links (failed status requests) remove edges. Successful requests reinstate/strengthen them.
*   **Output:** A dynamic network topology graph represented in a data structure suitable for efficient querying (e.g., adjacency list, adjacency matrix).

**2. Predictive Failure Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic network topology graph, historical communication data (including reliability scores), and pre-defined "criticality" metrics for each node (configurable by network administrator - e.g., servers handling critical applications have higher criticality).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Centrality Analysis:** Calculate centrality metrics (degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality) for each node within the reconstructed topology. High centrality nodes are potential single points of failure.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Employ time-series analysis on the reliability scores of edges connecting critical nodes. Sudden drops in reliability or increased latency/jitter indicate potential issues.
    *   **Path Redundancy Assessment:** Identify paths between critical nodes.  Assess the redundancy of these paths.  If a path relies on a single, low-reliability edge, flag it as a risk.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) on historical data (reliability scores, latency, jitter, failure events) to predict the probability of failure for each edge and node. Include seasonality in the prediction model.
*   **Output:**
    *   A "risk score" for each node and edge.
    *   A prioritized list of potential failure points, ordered by risk score.
    *   Recommendations for mitigating risks (e.g., rerouting traffic, increasing bandwidth, replacing failing hardware).

**3.  Alerting & Visualization Module:**

*   **Input:** Risk scores, prioritized list of potential failure points.
*   **Process:**
    *   Configure customizable alerts based on risk score thresholds.
    *   Visualize the network topology in a graphical interface. Highlight high-risk nodes and edges.
    *   Provide drill-down capabilities to investigate the root cause of potential issues.
*   **Output:**
    *   Real-time alerts to network administrators.
    *   Interactive network topology map.
    *   Detailed reports on network health and potential risks.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Modeling - Simplified):**

```
function predict_failure_probability(edge, historical_data):
  # Input: edge (representing a communication link), historical_data (time series of reliability scores)
  # Output: probability of failure (0.0 to 1.0)

  # 1. Feature Extraction
  features = extract_features(historical_data) # e.g., mean, stddev, trend, seasonality

  # 2. Model Training (Pre-trained)
  # Assume a pre-trained model (e.g., RNN) exists to predict failure probability
  model = load_pre_trained_model()

  # 3. Prediction
  probability = model.predict(features)

  return probability
```

This system moves beyond simply *detecting* failures to proactively identifying potential weaknesses and predicting issues *before* they impact network performance.  The dynamic topology reconstruction provides a more accurate and up-to-date view of the network, while the predictive modeling enables proactive mitigation of risks.
