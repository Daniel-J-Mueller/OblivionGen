## Dynamic Manifest Stitching with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the existing session-based manifest modification to enable a predictive pre-fetch system that anticipates bitrate switching *before* the client requests it. This reduces buffering and improves QoE.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `SessionState`: Contains:
    *   `sessionId`: Unique identifier for the viewing session.
    *   `currentBitrate`: Integer representing the currently delivered bitrate.
    *   `bitrateHistory`: Array of integers, representing bitrate changes over time. (e.g., `[1000, 1500, 1200]`)
    *   `predictedBitrate`: Integer, the predicted bitrate for the *next* segment.
    *   `predictionConfidence`: Float (0.0-1.0), indicating the confidence in the prediction.
    *   `clientBandwidthEstimate`: Integer, bandwidth estimate from client.

**2. Server-Side Components:**

*   **Manifest Modifier Service:** (Existing – enhanced)
    *   Receives initial manifest request.
    *   Generates modified manifest with `sessionId` embedded in links.
    *   Interfaces with Prediction Engine.
    *   Stitches together multiple "fragment manifests" (see below).
*   **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network, LSTM) trained on historical viewing data (bitrate switching patterns, time of day, content type, user location, etc.).
    *   Input: `SessionState.bitrateHistory`, `SessionState.clientBandwidthEstimate`, content metadata.
    *   Output: `SessionState.predictedBitrate`, `SessionState.predictionConfidence`.
*   **Fragment Manifest Generator:**
    *   Creates temporary, partial manifests for a small number of predicted bitrates (e.g., current bitrate, one bitrate higher, one bitrate lower).
    *   These are very small – only covering the next few segments.
*   **Manifest Stitcher:**
    *   Combines the fragment manifests into a single, cohesive manifest.  Prioritizes segments predicted to be necessary, and intelligently includes fallback options.

**3. Client-Side Modifications:**

*   Bandwidth estimation improved.
*   Client needs to report bandwidth estimations *and* buffering events to server.

**4. Workflow:**

1.  Client opens a viewing session.
2.  Server generates initial manifest, embedding `sessionId`.
3.  Server initializes `SessionState` and stores it.
4.  Client requests segments.
5.  Server logs bitrate switches and updates `SessionState.bitrateHistory`.
6.  Periodically (e.g., every 2-3 segments), Prediction Engine generates `predictedBitrate` and `predictionConfidence`.
7.  Fragment Manifest Generator creates partial manifests for `currentBitrate`, `predictedBitrate`, and potentially a fallback bitrate.
8.  Manifest Stitcher creates a combined manifest prioritizing the predicted bitrate, but including fallback options.
9.  Server sends the combined manifest to the client.
10. Client receives manifest.
11. Loop back to step 4.

**Pseudocode (Server – Manifest Stitcher):**

```
function stitchManifest(sessionId, predictedBitrate, predictionConfidence, currentBitrate):
  fragmentManifests = []

  # Create manifest for predicted bitrate (highest priority)
  fragmentManifests.append(generateFragmentManifest(sessionId, predictedBitrate))

  # Add manifest for current bitrate (as a fallback)
  fragmentManifests.append(generateFragmentManifest(sessionId, currentBitrate))

  # Optionally add a lower bitrate as a safety net (if confidence is low)
  if predictionConfidence < 0.5:
    fragmentManifests.append(generateFragmentManifest(sessionId, currentBitrate - 500))

  # Combine fragment manifests, prioritizing predicted bitrate segments
  combinedManifest = createCombinedManifest(fragmentManifests)

  return combinedManifest
```

**Innovation:**  This system doesn’t just react to bitrate changes – it *anticipates* them. By pre-fetching segments at the predicted bitrate, it minimizes buffering and provides a smoother viewing experience. The dynamic fragment manifest stitching allows for fine-grained control over the delivered content, adapting to changing network conditions and user behavior. This differs from standard ABR by attempting to ‘smooth’ the experience, rather than simply selecting the best bitrate at a given moment. It’s a more proactive approach to QoE optimization.
