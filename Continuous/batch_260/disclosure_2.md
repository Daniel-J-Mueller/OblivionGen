## Adaptive Partition Merging & Splitting for Backup Optimization

**Specification:** System for dynamic adjustment of database partition sizes *prior* to backup initiation, based on data volatility & backup frequency requirements.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of fixed partitioning, the system analyzes data access patterns within each partition. Highly volatile data (frequent reads/writes) resides in smaller partitions, allowing for faster, granular backups.  Static or rarely modified data is consolidated into larger partitions, reducing backup overhead. This is all done *automatically* before a backup cycle.

**Components:**

1.  **Volatility Monitor:**  Continuously tracks read/write activity within each partition.  Outputs a “Volatility Score” for each partition (0-100, higher = more volatile).
2.  **Partition Manager:**  Responsible for merging and splitting partitions based on Volatility Scores and a configurable “Target Partition Size Range”.  This range defines the acceptable size variation for partitions.
3.  **Backup Scheduler Integration:** Communicates with the existing backup scheduler. Receives backup requests and triggers the Partition Manager to pre-optimize partition sizes.
4. **Metadata Store Enhancement:**  Stores partition boundaries *and* volatility scores for each partition. Crucial for efficient merge/split operations and backup targeting.

**Operation:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Volatility Monitor continuously assesses partition activity.
2.  **Pre-Backup Trigger:** Backup Scheduler signals the Partition Manager a backup cycle is imminent.
3.  **Analysis:** Partition Manager retrieves current Volatility Scores and partition boundaries from the Metadata Store.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   **High Volatility (Score > Threshold):** If a partition's Volatility Score exceeds a configured threshold *and* its size is above a minimum size, the partition is split into two or more smaller partitions.
    *   **Low Volatility (Score < Threshold):** If a partition’s Volatility Score falls below a threshold *and* is near another partition, the two are merged into a larger partition (subject to maximum size limits).  Neighboring partitions are analyzed for suitable merging.
    * **No Action:** Partitions within acceptable parameters remain unchanged.
5.  **Backup Initiation:** Once partition adjustments are complete, the backup process proceeds as normal.
6. **Post-Backup Rebalance:** After a backup completes, a lightweight rebalancing process can analyze for potential additional merges or splits based on changes in volatility during the backup cycle.

**Pseudocode (Partition Manager – `adjust_partitions()` function):**

```
function adjust_partitions(backup_signal):
  partitions = get_all_partitions()
  for partition in partitions:
    volatility_score = get_volatility_score(partition)
    if volatility_score > HIGH_VOLATILITY_THRESHOLD and partition.size > MIN_PARTITION_SIZE:
      split_partition(partition)
    elif volatility_score < LOW_VOLATILITY_THRESHOLD:
      neighbor = find_suitable_neighbor(partition)
      if neighbor != null:
        merge_partitions(partition, neighbor)
  update_metadata_store(partitions)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Partition`: Contains attributes like `partition_id`, `size`, `volatility_score`, `data_range` (defines the data contained within the partition).
*   `MetadataStore`: Persistent storage for partition metadata.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced backup times for highly volatile data.
*   Decreased backup storage space for static data.
*   Improved overall system efficiency.
*   Adaptive to changing data patterns.
