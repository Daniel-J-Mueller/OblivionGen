## Autonomous Robotic Swarm for Dynamic Inventory Mapping & Replenishment

**System Overview:** A multi-robot system utilizing the core visual localization principles of the provided patent, but expanded to create a dynamic, self-updating 3D map of an entire retail space and proactively manage inventory levels. Instead of a single cart, a swarm of small, agile robots will operate concurrently.

**Robot Specs:**

*   **Dimensions:** 15cm x 15cm x 10cm.
*   **Locomotion:**  Omnidirectional wheels for maximum maneuverability in tight spaces.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Stereo Vision Camera (high resolution, depth sensing) – primary localization and object recognition.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – for drift correction and stabilization.
    *   Short-range LiDAR – for obstacle avoidance and close-proximity mapping.
    *   RFID Reader – for item-level tracking (optional, for enhanced accuracy).
*   **Processing:** Onboard NVIDIA Jetson Nano module for real-time image processing and sensor fusion.
*   **Communication:** Wi-Fi 6 / Bluetooth 5.2 for communication with a central server and other robots.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery (2-hour operating time).  Automated docking station for recharging.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):**  Extended version of the patent’s core visual localization, adapted for multi-robot coordination. Robots share visual features and map updates to create a consistent, global map.  Utilizes a graph-based SLAM algorithm (e.g., ORB-SLAM3) with robust outlier rejection.
2.  **Object Detection & Classification:**  YOLOv8 model fine-tuned for recognizing a wide range of retail products.  Includes support for recognizing both product packaging *and* individual items (e.g., counting apples in a display).  Leverages transfer learning to minimize training data requirements.
3.  **Inventory Management Module:**
    *   **Dynamic Inventory Mapping:**  Robots continuously scan shelves, recording product quantities and locations.
    *   **Real-time Stock Level Tracking:**  Data is uploaded to a central server, providing a real-time view of inventory levels.
    *   **Low Stock Alerts:**  Automated alerts are triggered when stock levels fall below predefined thresholds.
    *   **Predictive Replenishment:**  Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series forecasting) to predict future demand and proactively schedule replenishment orders.
4.  **Swarm Coordination:**
    *   **Task Assignment:** A central server assigns tasks to individual robots (e.g., "Scan Aisle 3," "Check stock of detergent").
    *   **Collision Avoidance:** Robots communicate with each other to avoid collisions and optimize path planning.  Utilizes a decentralized consensus algorithm (e.g., multi-agent pathfinding).
    *   **Adaptive Coverage:**  Robots dynamically adjust their coverage areas based on real-time demand and inventory levels.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** Robots are deployed into the retail space and begin building a map using SLAM.
2.  **Mapping & Scanning:** Robots systematically navigate the store, scanning shelves and recording inventory data.
3.  **Data Upload & Analysis:** Inventory data is uploaded to a central server, where it is analyzed to identify low-stock items and predict future demand.
4.  **Automated Replenishment:**  Replenishment orders are automatically generated and sent to suppliers.
5.  **Continuous Monitoring:**  Robots continuously monitor inventory levels and update the map to reflect changes in the store layout.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Coordination - Task Assignment):**

```
// Central Server Logic

function assignTasks(robots, storeMap, inventoryData):
  unassignedAreas = storeMap - areas covered by recent scans
  if unassignedAreas is empty:
    return

  sortedAreas = sort(unassignedAreas, by: priority (based on: foot traffic, inventory value, last scan date))

  for area in sortedAreas:
    availableRobot = findClosestAvailableRobot(robots, area)
    if availableRobot:
      assignTask(availableRobot, "Scan Area: " + area)
      removeRobotFromAvailableList(availableRobot)
    else:
      // Handle case where no robots are available (e.g., wait, increase swarm size)
      log("No available robots for area: " + area)

function findClosestAvailableRobot(robots, area):
  // Calculate distance between each robot and the area
  // Return the closest robot that is not currently assigned a task
```
