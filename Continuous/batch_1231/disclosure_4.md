## Dynamic Occlusion Mapping with Predictive Heat Diffusion

**Concept:** Extend the confidence mapping system to dynamically model and predict occlusions, enhancing presence detection in cluttered environments and improving localization accuracy.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from multiple sensors (RGB cameras, depth sensors, thermal cameras) to build a multi-modal representation of the environment.
*   **Occlusion Probability Map:** Generate a probability map indicating the likelihood of occlusion at each pixel, based on sensor data, scene geometry, and historical tracking data.
*   **Predictive Heat Diffusion:** Implement a heat diffusion algorithm that propagates confidence values through the environment, but *modulates* the diffusion rate based on the occlusion probability map. High occlusion probability = lower diffusion rate. This simulates the physical blocking of signals and prevents confidence from "leaking" through occlusions.
*   **Dynamic Mesh Reconstruction:** Use depth or stereo data to construct a dynamic 3D mesh of the scene. This mesh is used to:
    *   Identify potential occluders.
    *   Calculate occlusion probabilities based on ray tracing or visibility tests.
    *   Refine the occlusion probability map over time.
*   **Temporal Filtering:** Apply temporal filtering to the confidence and occlusion maps to reduce noise and improve stability.  Kalman filtering or particle filtering could be used.
*   **Adaptive Confidence Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the universal threshold based on the overall scene complexity and the estimated occlusion level.  Higher occlusion = lower threshold.
*    **Multi-Resolution Mapping**: Utilize a hierarchical multi-resolution mapping system. Lower resolutions represent coarser occlusion estimates, while higher resolutions provide detailed occlusion data. Switch between resolutions based on the proximity of potential targets.
*   **Hardware Acceleration**: Implement the heat diffusion and ray tracing algorithms on a GPU or other specialized hardware accelerator to achieve real-time performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Create Confidence Map (image data)
Create Occlusion Map (initialized to low probability)
Create Dynamic Mesh (from sensor data)

// Main Loop
Receive new sensor data (RGB, Depth, Thermal)

Update Dynamic Mesh

Calculate Occlusion Map:
  For each pixel:
    Ray trace from pixel through the mesh.
    If ray is blocked, increase occlusion probability.
    Update occlusion probability using temporal filtering.

Update Confidence Map:
  For each pixel:
    Calculate aggregate confidence value (as in original patent).
    Modulate confidence value with occlusion probability:
      confidence = confidence * (1 - occlusion_probability)

Apply Heat Diffusion:
  For each pixel:
    Diffuse confidence to neighboring pixels:
      diffusion_rate = base_rate * (1 - occlusion_probability)
      confidence = (neighbor_confidence * diffusion_rate) + confidence

Determine Peak Confidence & Cluster (as in original patent)

Adjust Bounding Box (as in original patent)

Output Presence Detection & Bounding Box
```

**Novelty:** The system doesn't merely *detect* presence despite occlusion; it *models* occlusion as a dynamic factor influencing confidence propagation and localization, leading to a more robust and accurate system.  The dynamic mesh and adaptive diffusion rate are key differentiators.
