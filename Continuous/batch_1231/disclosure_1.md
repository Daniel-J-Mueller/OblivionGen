## Dynamic Content Zones & Predictive Tile Arrangement

**Concept:** Expand the tile-based content presentation beyond a simple row beneath the navigation bar. Implement dynamic content zones that adapt in size and arrangement *based on user gaze/attention* detected via an integrated camera and AI processing. This goes beyond cursor position – it’s about *where the user is looking* and anticipating their likely selections.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integrated wide-angle camera (minimal bezel integration) with low-light performance.
    *   Dedicated AI processing unit (integrated into media streaming device/TV) for real-time gaze tracking and prediction.
    *   High-refresh-rate display (120Hz+) to support fluid content zone adjustments.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Gaze Tracking Module:**  Utilizes computer vision to identify user’s pupil center and calculate gaze direction.  Calibration required on first use, with ongoing micro-adjustments based on head pose.
    *   **Content Zone Manager:**  Defines and manages dynamic content zones on the display. Zones can be rectangular, circular, or irregular shapes.  Initial zones are defined by system defaults, but adapt over time.
    *   **Predictive Tile Arrangement Engine:** Core of the innovation. Analyzes:
        *   User gaze data – where are they looking?
        *   Content metadata – genre, actors, keywords.
        *   User viewing history – preferences, frequently accessed content.
        *   Trending content – real-time data feed.
        *   Time of day/week.
    *   Based on this data, the engine dynamically rearranges tiles *before* the user makes a selection.  Tiles the user is most likely to select are positioned closer to their gaze.
*   **Tile Behavior:**
    *   Tiles aren’t limited to a single row.  They can 'float' within defined content zones, adjusting their size and position.
    *   Tiles can exhibit subtle animations to draw the user’s attention, but avoid excessive distractions.
    *   Tiles should support multiple content types (video, apps, live TV channels, etc.).
*   **Navigation Bar Integration:** The navigation bar remains a constant element, but its functionality expands:
    *   Contextual suggestions: Based on the currently focused content zone, the navigation bar displays relevant actions (e.g., "Continue Watching," "Find Similar").
    *   Dynamic resizing: The navigation bar's height adjusts based on the number of visible tiles.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Tile Arrangement Engine):**

```
function predict_tile_arrangement(user_gaze, content_metadata, viewing_history, trending_content, time_of_day):
  // Calculate relevance scores for each tile
  for each tile in available_tiles:
    relevance_score = 0
    relevance_score += gaze_proximity(user_gaze, tile.position) * 0.4
    relevance_score += content_similarity(content_metadata, tile.metadata) * 0.3
    relevance_score += viewing_history_weight(tile.id) * 0.2
    relevance_score += trending_content_boost(tile.id) * 0.1

    tile.relevance = relevance_score

  // Sort tiles by relevance
  sorted_tiles = sort_tiles_by_relevance(sorted_tiles)

  // Create arrangement based on sorted tiles, prioritizing those with highest relevance
  arrangement = create_arrangement(sorted_tiles, user_gaze)

  return arrangement
```

**Expansion & Differentiation:**

*   **Multi-User Support:** Utilize facial recognition to personalize content arrangement for each viewer.
*   **AR/VR Integration:** Extend content zones beyond the display screen using augmented or virtual reality.
*   **AI-Driven Content Discovery:**  The system learns user preferences over time and proactively suggests content they might enjoy, even if they haven't explicitly searched for it.
*   **Emotional Response Integration**: Use camera-based emotion detection to adapt presented content to the user's mood.
