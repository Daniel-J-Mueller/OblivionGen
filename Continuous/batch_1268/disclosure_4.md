## Interactive Model "Genetic Drift" Simulator

**Concept:** Expand the interactive interpretation system to include a "genetic drift" simulation mode. Instead of *directly* enhancing the model based on user input, allow the user to observe how small, randomized "mutations" (changes to weights, data points, hyperparameters) affect model performance over simulated "generations."

**Specs:**

*   **Interface Addition:** A "Drift Simulation" toggle/mode within the existing interactive interpretation interface.
*   **Mutation Parameters:** User-adjustable parameters controlling the *type* and *magnitude* of mutations:
    *   **Weight Mutation Rate:** Probability of modifying a weight in the model.
    *   **Weight Mutation Magnitude:**  Scale of random change applied to the weight (e.g., +/- 0.01, +/- 0.1, etc.).
    *   **Data Point Mutation Rate:** Probability of adding, removing, or slightly modifying a data point in the training set.
    *   **Hyperparameter Mutation Rate:** Probability of randomly adjusting a hyperparameter (learning rate, regularization strength, etc.)
    *   **Mutation Scope:** Option to limit mutations to specific layers or sections of the model.
*   **Generation Count:** User-defined number of "generations" to simulate.
*   **Performance Metric:** User-selectable metric to track performance (accuracy, F1-score, AUC, etc.).
*   **Visualization:**
    *   **Performance Trend Line:** A graph showing the performance metric over generations.
    *   **"Best" Model Tracking:** The system automatically saves the model with the highest performance during the simulation.
    *   **Model "Lineage" Display:**  A visual representation of how the "best" model evolved over generations (e.g., a tree-like diagram showing key mutations).
*   **"Replay" Functionality:**  Ability to step through the simulation generation by generation, observing the model's changes.
*   **"Seed" Control:** Option to set a random seed for reproducibility.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function DriftSimulation(model, dataset, mutationParameters, generationCount):
  bestModel = model
  bestPerformance = evaluate(model, dataset, selectedMetric)

  for generation in range(generationCount):
    mutatedModel = createMutatedModel(model, dataset, mutationParameters)
    performance = evaluate(mutatedModel, dataset, selectedMetric)

    if performance > bestPerformance:
      bestPerformance = performance
      bestModel = mutatedModel

    displayPerformance(performance, generation)

  return bestModel

function createMutatedModel(model, dataset, mutationParameters):
  mutatedModel = deepcopy(model)

  // Weight Mutations
  for layer in mutatedModel.layers:
    for weight in layer.weights:
      if random() < mutationParameters.weightMutationRate:
        weight = weight + random() * mutationParameters.weightMutationMagnitude

  // Data Point Mutations
  mutatedDataset = deepcopy(dataset)
  if random() < mutationParameters.dataPointMutationRate:
    // Implement logic for adding/removing/modifying data points

  // Hyperparameter Mutations
  if random() < mutationParameters.hyperparameterMutationRate:
    // Implement logic for adjusting hyperparameters

  return mutatedModel
```

**Rationale:** This expands the interactive system beyond direct enhancement. The "genetic drift" simulation allows users to *observe* evolutionary processes within the model, gaining insights into which changes are beneficial, detrimental, or neutral.  It's a powerful exploratory tool for understanding model robustness and identifying potential areas for improvement.  The visualization components are crucial for making the simulation interpretable.
