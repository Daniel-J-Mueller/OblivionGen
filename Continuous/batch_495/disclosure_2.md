## Predictive Bundle Creation & Dynamic Pricing

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *recommending* item pairs to proactively creating dynamically priced "bundles" based on real-time user behavior and predictive modeling. This moves from reactive suggestion to proactive offer generation.

**Specs:**

**I. Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Input:** User activity data (views, purchases, cart additions, wishlists), item metadata (category, price, description), external data (seasonality, trending topics, competitor pricing).
*   **Real-time Activity Stream:** Establish a Kafka-based stream processing pipeline to ingest user actions as they occur.
*   **Feature Vectors:** Construct feature vectors for each user and item.
    *   **User Features:** Purchase history (frequency, recency, monetary value), viewed categories, preferred price range, demographic data (if available).
    *   **Item Features:** Category, price, average rating, number of reviews, sales velocity, inventory level.
    *   **Pairwise Features:** Co-view rate, co-purchase rate, average time between viewing two items.

**II. Predictive Bundle Model:**

*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, specifically a Deep Q-Network (DQN).
    *   **State:** Represents the current user (user features) and the available items (item features).
    *   **Action:** Creating a bundle (selecting a set of items) and assigning a price.
    *   **Reward:** Based on the probability of the user purchasing the bundle, considering factors like price sensitivity, perceived value, and bundle coherence.
*   **Bundle Coherence:** Implement a metric to assess how well the items in a bundle fit together.  This could be based on semantic similarity (using item descriptions) or category relationships.  High coherence rewards the RL agent.
*   **Training Data:** Historical user activity data and A/B test results of different bundle configurations.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Retrain the RL agent periodically with new data to adapt to changing user preferences and market conditions.

**III. Dynamic Pricing Engine:**

*   **Price Sensitivity Model:** Train a regression model to predict the price elasticity of demand for each item and bundle. Features include item characteristics, user demographics, and competitor pricing.
*   **Real-Time Price Adjustments:**  The dynamic pricing engine uses the price sensitivity model and the predicted demand to automatically adjust the prices of bundles in real-time.  The goal is to maximize revenue while maintaining a desired conversion rate.
*   **Price Anchoring:**  Display a "original price" or "recommended retail price" alongside the bundle price to create a sense of value.
*   **Personalized Pricing:**  Consider the user's willingness to pay based on their past behavior and demographic data.

**IV. Implementation Details:**

*   **Microservices Architecture:**  Implement each component (data ingestion, feature engineering, predictive model, pricing engine) as a separate microservice.
*   **API Gateway:**  Provide a unified API for accessing the bundle creation and pricing services.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:**  Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track the performance of the system and identify potential issues.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Continuously A/B test different bundle configurations and pricing strategies to optimize performance.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Creation):**

```
function create_bundle(user_id):
  user_features = get_user_features(user_id)
  available_items = get_available_items()

  state = (user_features, available_items)

  action = RL_agent.select_action(state)  // Returns a list of item IDs and a price

  bundle_items = action.items
  bundle_price = action.price

  return bundle_items, bundle_price
```
