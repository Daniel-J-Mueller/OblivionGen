## Temporal Data Shadowing & Predictive Reversion

**Concept:** Extend selective data restoration to create a continuously maintained "shadow" of data states, coupled with AI-driven predictive reversion to proactively mitigate data corruption or unintended consequences of changes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Data Store:**

*   **Technology:** Utilize a columnar database optimized for time-series data (e.g., ClickHouse, TimescaleDB) to store differential data snapshots.
*   **Granularity:**  Allow configuration of snapshot frequency (e.g., every minute, hour, day) and granularity (full row, differential changes).  Defaults to minute-level differential snapshots for critical tables.
*   **Compression:** Employ aggressive data compression techniques (e.g., Gorilla compression) to minimize storage footprint.
*   **Retention Policy:** Configurable retention period, with tiered storage based on data age (hot, warm, cold).

**2. Change Stream Integration:**

*   **Real-time Ingestion:** Integrate directly with the existing change stream store.
*   **Differential Snapshotting:**  As change events arrive, construct differential snapshots and append them to the shadow data store.  Metadata includes timestamp, transaction ID, and affected keys.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Implement parallel processing to handle high-volume change streams.

**3. Predictive Reversion Engine:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Employ machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, autoencoders) trained on historical change data to identify anomalous patterns (e.g., unusually high write rates, unexpected data values).
*   **Impact Analysis:**  If an anomaly is detected, the engine analyzes the affected data and predicts the potential impact of the change.
*   **Automated Reversion:** Based on pre-defined policies and the impact analysis, the engine can automatically revert the change to a previous, known-good state using the shadow data store.
*   **User Confirmation:**  For critical systems, require user confirmation before initiating automated reversion.
*   **"What-If" Analysis:** Allow users to simulate the effects of a change before applying it, using the shadow data store to project the outcome.

**4. API & Console Integration:**

*   **REST API:** Provide a REST API for accessing the shadow data store and triggering reversion actions.
*   **Recovery Console Extension:**  Extend the existing recovery console to display historical data states from the shadow store.
*   **Visualization:** Implement data visualization tools to help users analyze historical data and identify potential issues.

**5. Pseudocode - Automated Reversion Logic:**

```
FUNCTION AutomatedReversion(ChangeData, Policy)
  AnomalyScore = DetectAnomaly(ChangeData)

  IF AnomalyScore > Policy.Threshold THEN
    ImpactAnalysis = AnalyzeImpact(ChangeData)

    IF ImpactAnalysis.Severity > Policy.Severity THEN
      IF Policy.AutoRevert = TRUE THEN
        PreviousState = RetrievePreviousState(ChangeData.Key, ChangeData.Timestamp)
        RevertData(ChangeData.Key, PreviousState)
        LogReversion(ChangeData, PreviousState)
      ELSE
        AlertUser(ChangeData, ImpactAnalysis)
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**6. Scalability and Resilience:**

*   **Distributed Architecture:** Design the shadow data store as a distributed system to ensure scalability and resilience.
*   **Replication:** Implement data replication to protect against data loss.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to system failures.
