## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Dynamic Filtering

**Concept:** Create localized acoustic zones within a space, dynamically adjusting filtering and processing based on identified sound sources and user-defined preferences. This moves beyond simply ignoring a wakeword; it shapes the entire sonic environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** A dense array (minimum 16 microphones) distributed throughout the target space (room, vehicle cabin, etc.). High-sensitivity, low-noise microphones are crucial.
*   **Spatial Audio Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP or FPGA capable of real-time beamforming, source localization, and adaptive filtering.
*   **Localized Speaker System:** Array of small, directional speakers distributed throughout the space, allowing for targeted audio delivery and localized noise cancellation.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Integrated IMU to compensate for movement and vibration affecting microphone and speaker positioning.
*   **User Interface:** App/software allowing users to define zones, preferences, and priority levels for sound sources.

**2. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Beamforming & Source Localization:** Implement advanced beamforming algorithms (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, MVDR, MUSIC) to accurately locate sound sources in 3D space.
*   **Acoustic Zone Definition:** Allow users to define arbitrary zones within the space using the app. These zones can be geometric shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders) or user-defined polygons.
*   **Sound Source Classification:** Utilize machine learning models to classify detected sound sources (speech, music, environmental noise, etc.).
*   **Adaptive Filtering:**
    *   **Zone-Based Processing:** Apply different filtering parameters (EQ, noise reduction, reverb) to each defined zone.
    *   **Priority Levels:** Assign priority levels to sound sources. For example, speech from a specific person can be prioritized over background music.
    *   **Dynamic Noise Cancellation:**  Actively cancel out noise in specific zones based on identified noise sources.
    *   **Sound Shaping:**  Modify the characteristics of sound sources within a zone (e.g., enhance bass, reduce treble, add reverb).
*   **Wakeword Integration:** Incorporate the existing wakeword detection technology. When a wakeword is detected, the system can temporarily adjust zone processing to prioritize the wakeword source or silence other zones. However, the primary function isn't *ignoring* the wakeword, it's managing the entire acoustic environment.
*    **Predictive Acoustic Modelling:** Utilize machine learning to predict how sound will propagate within the space, allowing for proactive adjustments to zone processing.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Define Space Boundaries
Calibrate Microphone and Speaker Array
Load User Preferences
Start Sound Monitoring Loop

//Sound Monitoring Loop
For each Microphone Input:
    Perform Beamforming to locate sound sources
    Classify Sound Source (Speech, Music, Noise, etc.)
    Determine Zone Location of Sound Source

    If Sound Source is Wakeword:
        Adjust Zone Processing to Prioritize Wakeword
        Activate Wakeword Listener

    Else:
        Apply Zone-Specific Filtering Parameters
        Adjust Volume Based on User Preferences
        Perform Dynamic Noise Cancellation

    Update Acoustic Model Based on Real-Time Data

End Loop
```

**4. Potential Applications:**

*   **Automotive:** Create localized audio zones within a vehicle cabin for passengers.
*   **Open Office:** Reduce noise distractions and improve speech intelligibility in open office environments.
*   **Home Entertainment:** Create immersive audio experiences by shaping the sound field within a room.
*   **Accessibility:** Assist individuals with hearing impairments by amplifying specific sounds and reducing background noise.
