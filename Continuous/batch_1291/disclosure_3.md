## Dynamic Data Obfuscation via Environmental Sensors

**Concept:** Extend location-based security to dynamically alter data content based on *multiple* environmental sensor readings – not just location. This goes beyond simply restricting access or rendering; it actively changes the data itself to create layered obfuscation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Device integrates with, or accesses data streams from, the following sensors:
    *   Ambient light level
    *   Sound/Noise level (decibels)
    *   Proximity (to other devices/objects – Bluetooth/UWB)
    *   Atmospheric Pressure
    *   Temperature
    *   Humidity
*   **Data Encoding Profiles:** Define 'profiles' linking sensor ranges to data alteration algorithms.  Each profile contains:
    *   Sensor thresholds (e.g., light < 10 lux, noise > 80 dB)
    *   Algorithm selection (see 'Data Alteration Algorithms')
    *   Algorithm parameters (e.g., encryption key length, pixelation level)
*   **Data Alteration Algorithms:**
    *   **Pixelation/Blur:** For images/video – degree of pixelation/blur increases with noise/decreases with light.
    *   **Audio Masking:**  Add white noise or ambient sounds (captured by the device) to audio files – frequency/amplitude adjusted based on ambient noise.
    *   **Text Substitution:** Replace sensitive keywords in text documents with similar-sounding or contextually related words – selection algorithm adapts based on detected keywords and ambient sound (to disrupt frequency analysis).
    *   **Data Fragmentation/Reassembly:** Split data into multiple fragments, encrypt each fragment with a key derived from sensor readings, and store/transmit the fragments separately.  Requires a corresponding 'reassembly profile' based on the same sensor data.
    *   **Metadata Injection:** Inject false or misleading metadata into files, masking the true origin or content. This metadata is also influenced by sensor readings.
*   **Dynamic Profile Selection:** Device monitors sensor data in real-time.  When sensor readings fall within the thresholds of a defined profile, the corresponding data alteration algorithms are applied *before* any action (backup, share, render) is performed.
*   **Secure Profile Storage:** Data alteration profiles are encrypted and stored securely on the device (potentially utilizing a hardware security module).
*   **Policy Engine:**  A central policy engine allows administrators to define which profiles are applied to which data types or users.

**Pseudocode (Profile Application):**

```
function applyProfile(dataFile, user, action) {
  sensorData = getSensorReadings();
  relevantProfiles = getProfilesForUserAndAction(user, action);
  matchingProfile = selectProfileBasedOnSensorData(sensorData, relevantProfiles);

  if (matchingProfile != null) {
    alteredData = applyAlterationAlgorithms(dataFile, matchingProfile);
    logEvent("Data altered using profile: " + matchingProfile.name);
    return alteredData;
  } else {
    logEvent("No matching profile found.");
    return dataFile; // Return original data if no profile matches
  }
}
```

**Use Case:**  A financial analyst working on sensitive data in a public space. The device detects high noise levels and low light.  A profile is applied that pixelates charts and graphs, adds audio masking to any recorded voice notes, and fragments the data across multiple encrypted files. Even if the device is compromised, the extracted data is significantly obfuscated.
