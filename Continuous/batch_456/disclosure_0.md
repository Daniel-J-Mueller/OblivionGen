## Adaptive Cipher Suite Negotiation via Behavioral Biometrics

**System Overview:**

This design introduces a system for dynamically adapting the cipher suite used for secure channel establishment based on real-time behavioral biometrics of the communicating parties. It builds upon the existing concept of cipher suite negotiation but moves beyond static selection to continuous assessment and adjustment.

**Components:**

1.  **Biometric Data Collection Module:**  Integrated into both the initiating and responding devices. This module captures behavioral biometrics during the initial handshake and ongoing communication.  Data points include:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, duration)
    *   Mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, trajectory)
    *   Network timing analysis (inter-packet arrival times, latency fluctuations) - subtly detectable variations in network behavior.
    *   Device motion (accelerometer data â€“ even subtle hand tremors or device handling differences).
2.  **Behavioral Profile Database:** A secure database storing learned behavioral profiles for each authenticated user/device.  Profiles are built over time through ongoing data collection and analysis.  Emphasis on anomaly detection, not strict identity verification.
3.  **Risk Assessment Engine:**  Analyzes real-time biometric data against the established behavioral profile and assigns a risk score.  Factors in the deviation from the expected behavior and the criticality of the data being transmitted.
4.  **Dynamic Cipher Suite Selector:** Based on the risk score from the Risk Assessment Engine, this module dynamically selects the cipher suite for the secure channel.
    *   Low Risk:  Utilizes optimized, high-speed cipher suites for minimal overhead.
    *   Medium Risk:  Selects balanced cipher suites offering a good trade-off between security and performance.
    *   High Risk:  Employs the strongest, most computationally intensive cipher suites available, even at the cost of performance.  May also enable multi-factor authentication or require re-keying.
5.  **Adaptive Re-keying Mechanism**:  Triggers re-keying based on both time intervals *and* changes in the risk score. A sudden increase in the risk score (indicating potential compromise) prompts immediate re-keying.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Cipher Suite Selection):**

```
function selectCipherSuite(riskScore, availableCipherSuites):
  if riskScore < 30:
    return availableCipherSuites[0] // Optimized, High-Speed
  else if riskScore < 70:
    return availableCipherSuites[1] // Balanced
  else:
    return availableCipherSuites[2] // Strongest, Most Secure
  end
end

function updateRiskScore(biometricData, userProfile):
  deviation = calculateDeviation(biometricData, userProfile)
  riskScore = scaleDeviationToRiskScore(deviation)
  return riskScore
end
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Devices initiate secure channel establishment.
2.  Biometric Data Collection Modules capture initial biometric data.
3.  Risk Assessment Engine analyzes the initial data and generates an initial risk score.
4.  Dynamic Cipher Suite Selector selects an appropriate cipher suite.
5.  Secure channel is established with the selected cipher suite.
6.  Ongoing biometric data collection continues throughout the session.
7.  Risk Assessment Engine continuously updates the risk score.
8.  Dynamic Cipher Suite Selector can dynamically adjust the cipher suite or trigger re-keying if the risk score changes significantly.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Biometric data must be protected through encryption and secure storage.
*   Spoofing attacks must be mitigated through multi-factor authentication and anomaly detection.
*   The system should be resistant to replay attacks and data injection.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing are essential.
