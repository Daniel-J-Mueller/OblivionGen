## Dynamic Encoding Chain Prediction & Prefetching

**Concept:** Proactively anticipate encoding failures *before* they happen, based on component health metrics and historical data, and pre-fetch/provision backup resources *along the entire encoding chain* – not just the primary/secondary encoder swap described in the provided patent. This extends the failover concept to include packaging, ingest, and even CDN edge node health, creating a truly resilient, predictive encoding pipeline.

**Specs:**

1.  **Health Monitoring Agents (HMAs):** Deploy lightweight agents on *every* component of the encoding pipeline (encoders, packagers, ingest servers, CDN edge nodes). These agents collect real-time metrics: CPU usage, memory pressure, network latency, error rates, disk I/O.
2.  **Historical Data Store (HDS):** A time-series database storing historical metric data from all HMAs. This data is used to build baseline performance profiles for each component.
3.  **Predictive Failure Model (PFM):** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM network) trained on the HDS data. The PFM predicts the probability of failure for each component within a specified time window (e.g., next 5 minutes).  Inputs are real-time metrics, historical data, and potentially external factors like network congestion.
4.  **Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA):** Based on the PFM's predictions, the DRA proactively allocates backup resources. This isn’t just a simple encoder swap. The DRA can:
    *   Spin up backup encoders.
    *   Pre-provision backup packaging instances.
    *   Adjust CDN edge node weighting to shift traffic away from potentially failing nodes.
    *   Pre-fetch necessary input streams to the backup resources.
5.  **Encoding Chain Graph (ECG):**  A dynamic graph representing the complete encoding pipeline for each live stream.  Nodes represent components (encoder, packager, etc.), and edges represent data flow. The ECG is updated in real-time to reflect component health and allocated resources.
6.  **Failover Orchestrator (FO):** The central control plane. The FO monitors the ECG, receives predictions from the PFM, and instructs the DRA to allocate/deallocate resources. When a failure *does* occur, the FO seamlessly switches traffic to the pre-provisioned backup resources.

**Pseudocode (Failover Orchestrator - simplified):**

```
function monitor_encoding_chain(ECG) {
  for each component in ECG {
    failure_probability = PFM.predict_failure(component.metrics)
    if (failure_probability > threshold) {
      DRA.provision_backup(component)
      ECG.update(component, backup_resource)
    }
  }
}

function handle_actual_failure(failed_component) {
  backup_resource = ECG.get_backup(failed_component)
  ECG.redirect_traffic(failed_component, backup_resource)
  //Signal to remove failed component (graceful shutdown)
}

//Main Loop
while (true) {
  monitor_encoding_chain(ECG)
  //Listen for actual failure events
  on_failure_event(handle_actual_failure)
}
```

**Innovation Details:**

*   **Proactive, not Reactive:** Shifts the focus from responding to failures to preventing them.
*   **Full Pipeline Resilience:** Extends failover beyond just the encoder to encompass the entire encoding pipeline.
*   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:**  Automatically adjusts resources based on predicted demand and component health.
*   **Reduced Interruptions:** Seamlessly switches traffic to pre-provisioned backups, minimizing or eliminating live stream interruptions.
*   **Scalability:** The system can be scaled to support a large number of live streams and encoding pipelines.
