## Dynamic Translation Difficulty & Reward System

**Concept:** Extend the translation scoring system to dynamically adjust translation difficulty *and* translator rewards based on real-time performance data. This moves beyond static scoring and fosters a more engaging, efficient, and high-quality translation pipeline.

**Specs:**

*   **Difficulty Metric:** Implement a 'Content Complexity Score' (CCS) calculated for each piece of content *before* translation. Factors: sentence length, vocabulary rarity (using a constantly updated corpus), grammatical complexity (parse tree depth, number of clauses), presence of idioms/cultural references.
*   **Translator Skill Profile:** Maintain a detailed profile for each translator, tracking:
    *   Language pair proficiency.
    *   Subject matter expertise (tagged by previously translated content).
    *   Historical accuracy score (from reviewer ratings).
    *   Speed of translation (words/hour).
    *   Revision rate (edits required after review).
*   **Dynamic Job Assignment:**  The system assigns translations based on a ‘Compatibility Score’ – a weighted combination of:
    *   CCS of content.
    *   Translator Skill Profile metrics.
    *   Real-time translator workload.
    *   A 'Challenge Factor' – occasionally assigning slightly difficult content to encourage skill growth.
*   **Reward System:**
    *   **Base Reward:** Calculated from CCS and word count.
    *   **Quality Bonus:** Awarded based on reviewer ratings, weighted by reviewer score (as in the original patent).
    *   **Speed Bonus:**  Awarded for completing translations faster than the average for similar content, but *only if* quality remains high.
    *   **Complexity Multiplier:**  Higher CCS content yields a greater reward multiplier.
    *   **Skill Growth Reward:** Translators receive bonus rewards for successfully completing challenging content (content with a high CCS and/or outside their typical subject matter).
*   **Reviewer Skill Adjustment:** Reviewers who consistently identify errors missed by other reviewers, or consistently provide helpful feedback, receive increased weight in the scoring system. Conversely, reviewers with inconsistent ratings or poor feedback quality see their weight reduced.
*   **Gamification Layer:** Integrate gamification elements (badges, leaderboards, progress tracking) to motivate translators and reviewers.

**Pseudocode (Job Assignment):**

```
FUNCTION AssignJob(Content, Translators):
  ContentComplexityScore = CalculateCCS(Content)
  EligibleTranslators = []

  FOR Translator IN Translators:
    SkillScore = CalculateSkillScore(Translator, Content)  //Considers language pair, subject matter, historical accuracy
    Workload = GetTranslatorWorkload(Translator)

    IF SkillScore > Threshold AND Workload < MaxWorkload:
      Add Translator to EligibleTranslators

  IF EligibleTranslators is empty:
    Lower Skill Threshold

  IF EligibleTranslators is still empty:
    Broadcast Request for Translators

  BestTranslator = SelectBestTranslator(EligibleTranslators, ContentComplexityScore) //Chooses translator with highest SkillScore, potentially factoring in ChallengeFactor

  Assign Job to BestTranslator

FUNCTION CalculateSkillScore(Translator, Content):
    LanguageMatchScore = IF Translator.LanguagePair == Content.LanguagePair THEN 1 ELSE 0.5
    SubjectMatterScore =  Translator.SubjectMatterExpertiseScore(Content.Topic) //0 to 1 scale
    AccuracyScore = Translator.HistoricalAccuracyScore
    SkillScore = (LanguageMatchScore * 0.3) + (SubjectMatterScore * 0.4) + (AccuracyScore * 0.3)
    RETURN SkillScore
```

This expands on the core idea of the patent by introducing a dynamic, self-optimizing system that rewards both quality and efficiency, adapts to translator skill levels, and encourages continuous improvement. It's a move from passive scoring to active management of the translation process.
