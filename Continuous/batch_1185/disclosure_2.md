## Adaptive Transactional 'Mood' Profiles

**Core Concept:** Extend the dynamic password/phrase token system to incorporate user emotional state as a transaction factor. This introduces a layer of behavioral biometrics alongside traditional security measures, potentially reducing false positives and adding a nuanced authorization layer.

**Specification:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Emotion Sensor Integration:** Integrate with user devices (phones, wearables) to capture real-time emotional data. Acceptable sensors include:
    *   Facial expression analysis via camera.
    *   Voice analysis (tone, pitch, speed).
    *   Physiological data (heart rate variability, skin conductance – via wearables).
*   **Emotional State Mapping Engine:** A machine learning model that translates sensor data into a discrete emotional state.  States could include: ‘Calm’, ‘Neutral’, ‘Focused’, ‘Anxious’, ‘Excited’, ‘Distressed’.
*   **Transaction Mood Profile Database:**  Stores user-specific ‘mood profiles’.  These profiles define acceptable/unacceptable emotional states for different transaction types (e.g., low-value purchases, high-value purchases, transfers to new recipients).  Profiles are dynamically updated based on user behavior and feedback.
*   **Adaptive Risk Engine:**  Integrates the emotional state data with existing transaction risk factors (amount, recipient, time of day, location).  Adjusts authorization requirements (e.g., requiring a stronger authentication method) based on the combined risk score.
*   **User Feedback Mechanism:**  Allows users to correct misidentified emotional states or provide feedback on the appropriateness of authorization decisions. This feedback loop improves the accuracy of the emotional state mapping engine and the transaction mood profiles.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Transaction Initiation:** User initiates a transaction (e.g., purchase, transfer).
2.  **Emotion Capture:** System captures emotional state data from the user's device.
3.  **Emotion Analysis:** Emotional State Mapping Engine analyzes the data and assigns an emotional state.
4.  **Profile Lookup:** System retrieves the user’s Transaction Mood Profile.
5.  **Risk Assessment:** Adaptive Risk Engine combines the emotional state, transaction details, and existing risk factors.
6.  **Authorization Decision:**
    *   **Low Risk (Favorable Emotional State):** Transaction is approved with minimal authentication.
    *   **Medium Risk (Neutral Emotional State or Minor Deviation):**  System requests a standard authentication method (e.g., dynamic password).
    *   **High Risk (Unfavorable Emotional State or Significant Deviation):** System requests stronger authentication (e.g., biometric verification, multi-factor authentication) or flags the transaction for manual review.
7.  **Feedback Capture:** System prompts the user for feedback on the authorization decision.

**3. Pseudocode (Adaptive Risk Engine)**

```
function calculate_risk_score(transaction_details, emotional_state, user_profile) {

  base_risk = calculate_base_risk(transaction_details); // Amount, recipient, etc.

  mood_risk = 0;
  if (emotional_state == "Distressed" && transaction_details.amount > user_profile.high_value_threshold) {
    mood_risk = 0.7; // High Mood Risk
  } else if (emotional_state == "Anxious" && transaction_details.recipient == "New") {
    mood_risk = 0.5; // Medium Mood Risk
  } else if (emotional_state == "Excited" && transaction_details.amount > user_profile.high_value_threshold) {
    mood_risk = 0.3 // Low Mood Risk (could be a false positive risk)
  }
  
  risk_score = base_risk + mood_risk;

  if (risk_score > threshold_high) {
    request_strong_authentication();
  } else if (risk_score > threshold_medium) {
    request_standard_authentication();
  } else {
    approve_transaction();
  }
}
```

**4. Extended Functionality:**

*   **Gamification of Mood Profiles:** Allow users to ‘train’ their mood profiles through gamified exercises.
*   **Emotional Biometric as a Secondary Factor:**  Use emotional state as a secondary authentication factor alongside passwords/biometrics.
*   **Proactive Fraud Detection:** Flag potentially fraudulent transactions based on significant deviations from the user’s established emotional baseline.
*   **Integration with Mental Wellness Services:** Provide users with access to mental wellness resources if the system detects signs of distress.
