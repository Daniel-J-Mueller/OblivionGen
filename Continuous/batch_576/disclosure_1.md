## Adaptive Task Difficulty & Skill Mapping

**System Overview:** A dynamic system that adjusts task complexity in real-time based on performer skill demonstrated during prior, similar tasks. The system creates a "skill map" for each performer, predicting success probability and offering tasks tailored to maximize learning and engagement.

**Core Components:**

*   **Task Repository:** Database of tasks with associated difficulty scores (initial estimate). Scores are multi-dimensional, representing cognitive load, required precision, time pressure, and knowledge domain.
*   **Performer Skill Map:** A dynamic profile for each user, tracking performance metrics across task dimensions. Initially seeded with self-reported skill levels or baseline assessments.
*   **Performance Analyzer:** Module that evaluates task performance in real-time, extracting quantifiable metrics (accuracy, completion time, error rate, number of attempts, resource usage).
*   **Difficulty Adjustment Engine:** Algorithm that modifies task difficulty based on performer skill map and performance analyzer output. Adjustments include:
    *   Increasing/Decreasing complexity of input data.
    *   Modifying time constraints.
    *   Introducing or removing distractions.
    *   Altering the level of detail required in the output.
*   **Task Recommendation Engine:**  Suggests tasks to performers based on their skill map, maximizing challenge while minimizing frustration.

**Data Structures:**

*   `Task`: {`taskID`, `difficultyScore` (vector), `taskType`, `instructions`, `inputData`, `expectedOutput` }
*   `PerformerSkillMap`: {`performerID`, `skillVector` (vector), `taskHistory` (list of `taskID`s), `confidenceLevels` (vector)}
*   `PerformanceMetrics`: {`accuracy`, `completionTime`, `errorRate`, `attempts`, `resourceUsage`}

**Pseudocode (Difficulty Adjustment Engine):**

```
function adjustDifficulty(task, performerSkillMap, performanceMetrics):
  // Calculate a performance score based on metrics
  performanceScore = calculatePerformanceScore(performanceMetrics)

  // Calculate skill difference between task and performer
  skillDifference = calculateSkillDifference(task.difficultyScore, performerSkillMap.skillVector)

  // Determine adjustment factor based on skill difference and performance
  adjustmentFactor = calculateAdjustmentFactor(skillDifference, performanceScore)

  // Apply adjustment to task difficulty
  newDifficultyScore = task.difficultyScore + (adjustmentFactor * skillDifference)

  // Clamp new difficulty to valid range
  newDifficultyScore = clamp(newDifficultyScore, minDifficulty, maxDifficulty)

  //Update the task’s difficulty for subsequent performers
  task.difficultyScore = newDifficultyScore

  return task
```

**System Workflow:**

1.  A performer begins a task.
2.  The system retrieves the initial task difficulty score.
3.  The Difficulty Adjustment Engine modifies the task based on the performer’s skill map and performance on prior tasks.
4.  The Performance Analyzer monitors the performer’s performance in real-time.
5.  The Difficulty Adjustment Engine dynamically adjusts the task difficulty throughout the performance.
6.  The system updates the performer’s skill map based on the completed task.
7.  The Task Recommendation Engine suggests a new task based on the updated skill map.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Gamification:** Integrate badges, leaderboards, and rewards to increase engagement.
*   **Adaptive Tutorials:** Provide tailored tutorials and guidance based on individual skill gaps.
*   **Collaborative Learning:** Pair performers with complementary skills to foster peer learning.
*   **Skill Gap Analysis:** Identify systemic skill gaps within a user base and suggest training programs.
