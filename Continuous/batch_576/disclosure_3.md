**Dynamic Batching with Predictive Failure Analysis**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a system where batch creation isn't solely triggered by message volume or time, but also by *predicted* processing failure rates. The system anticipates potential issues *before* sending a batch, adjusting batch composition dynamically to minimize overall failure and maximize throughput.

**II. Components:**

*   **Failure Prediction Module:** A machine learning model trained on historical message processing data (success/failure rates, message content characteristics, queue server load). This module assigns a “risk score” to each incoming message.
*   **Dynamic Batch Builder:** This component receives messages and their risk scores. It utilizes a heuristic algorithm (described below) to construct batches that balance size with predicted failure rate.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:**  Failure rate thresholds are not static. They adjust based on overall system load, recent performance, and potentially even time of day (e.g., lower tolerance for failure during peak hours).
*   **Real-time Feedback Loop:** The system constantly monitors batch processing results. Actual failure rates are fed back into the Failure Prediction Module to refine its accuracy and the Adaptive Thresholds.

**III. Heuristic Algorithm for Dynamic Batch Builder:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with an empty batch and a target batch size (configurable).
2.  **Message Intake:** As messages arrive, assign them to the batch based on their strict order parameter (as per the base patent).
3.  **Risk Assessment:** Calculate the weighted average risk score of the current batch.
4.  **Batch Decision:**
    *   If the weighted average risk score is below a dynamically adjusted threshold *and* the batch size is below the target size, add the message.
    *   If the risk score exceeds the threshold, *defer* adding the message.  Create a “high-risk pool” for these messages.
    *   If the batch reaches the target size, send it.
5.  **High-Risk Pool Management:** Periodically, create smaller batches from the high-risk pool. These batches are treated with increased monitoring and potential retry mechanisms.  A maximum dwell time for messages in the high-risk pool is enforced.
6.  **Batch Splitting:** If a batch grows large enough, split it into sub-batches, ensuring each sub-batch remains under a predefined size limit.

**IV. Pseudocode (Dynamic Batch Builder):**

```
function build_batch(message):
  risk_score = get_risk_score(message)
  if batch_size < target_size and weighted_average_risk(batch) + risk_score/batch_size < threshold:
    add_message_to_batch(message)
  else:
    add_message_to_high_risk_pool(message)

function process_high_risk_pool():
  if len(high_risk_pool) > min_batch_size:
    create_batch_from_pool()
    send_batch()

function create_batch_from_pool():
  batch = []
  while len(batch) < min_batch_size and len(high_risk_pool) > 0:
    batch.append(high_risk_pool.pop(0))
  return batch
```

**V.  Data Structures:**

*   `Batch`:  List of messages, weighted average risk score.
*   `HighRiskPool`: Queue of messages, timestamp of arrival.

**VI.  Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced overall failure rates.
*   Improved throughput by proactively isolating potentially problematic messages.
*   Enhanced system stability.
*   Adaptive performance based on real-time conditions.
