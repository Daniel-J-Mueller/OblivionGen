## Dynamic Password Inheritance & Temporal Access Keys

**Concept:** Extend the temporary password/credential management to not just *access* components, but *inherit* access rights *through* them, with decaying temporal keys. This builds on the idea of managing passwords for components that don’t accept TGTs, but adds a layer of privilege escalation and controlled delegation.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Component: Access Inheritance Manager (AIM):**

*   **Function:** A centralized service responsible for managing inherited access rights and temporal keys.
*   **Data Structure:**  `AccessGraph` – A directed graph where nodes represent users, applications/components, and inherited privileges. Edges represent the inheritance relationship and are tagged with a `TemporalKey` and a `DecayRate`.

    ```
    class AccessGraph:
        nodes = {}
        edges = {}
    
    class Node:
        id = ""
        type = "" # User, Application, Component
    
    class Edge:
        source = "" # Node ID
        target = "" # Node ID
        temporalKey = "" # Encrypted Key
        decayRate = 0.0 # Percentage per time unit
        lastAccessed = 0 # Timestamp
    ```

**2. Workflow:**

*   **Step 1: Initial Access:** User authenticates (via existing Kerberos/AIM flow) to Component A.
*   **Step 2: Privilege Request:** Component A determines User needs access to Resource B *through* Component C. Component C doesn't directly accept Kerberos.
*   **Step 3: Inheritance Request:** Component A requests a "Delegated Access Token" from AIM, specifying User, Resource B, Component C.
*   **Step 4: AIM Response:** AIM generates a `TemporalKey`, encrypts it with Component A’s public key, and creates a new edge in the `AccessGraph`: A -> C, with the `TemporalKey` and `decayRate`.  AIM returns the encrypted `TemporalKey` to Component A.
*   **Step 5: Delegation:** Component A decrypts the `TemporalKey` and forwards it to Component C, along with a proof of authorization (signed request showing Component A has the right to delegate).
*   **Step 6: Access Granted:** Component C verifies the proof of authorization and uses the `TemporalKey` to grant access to Resource B.
*   **Step 7: Decay & Revocation:**  A background process periodically evaluates the `AccessGraph`. 
    *   `TemporalKey` strength decays based on `decayRate` and time since `lastAccessed`.
    *   If `TemporalKey` strength falls below a threshold, access is revoked.
    *   Explicit revocation requests from AIM or Component A also trigger immediate access denial.

**3. Key Generation & Decay:**

*   `TemporalKey` is a symmetric key generated using a strong cryptographic algorithm (e.g., AES-256).
*   Key decay isn't a simple reduction in key length. Instead, a cryptographic "fuzzing" process is applied. Random bits are flipped in the key with a probability determined by the `decayRate` and elapsed time. This gradually weakens the key's effectiveness *without* completely destroying it.
*   Decayed keys can be "refreshed" by re-requesting a new `TemporalKey` from AIM before they expire, allowing for seamless continuation of access.

**4.  API Endpoints (AIM):**

*   `POST /access/request`: Request a Delegated Access Token.
*   `POST /access/revoke`: Revoke access.
*   `GET /access/status`: Check the status of a Delegated Access Token.

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   Component A must be a trusted entity.
*   Strong encryption and authentication are vital.
*   Monitoring and auditing of all access requests are essential.
*   Regular vulnerability assessments of all components are crucial.
