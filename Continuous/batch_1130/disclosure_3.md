## Dynamic Behavioral Cohort Generation & Predictive Offer Sculpting

**Concept:** Extend the impact analysis beyond simple transaction completion/failure to incorporate a continuous stream of user behavioral data, creating dynamically shifting cohorts and *proactive* offer sculpting.  Instead of reacting to a missed transaction, predict potential 'drift' *before* it happens.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**  Capture granular user actions within the online purchasing system. This includes:
    *   Page views (dwell time, scroll depth).
    *   Search queries (keywords, filters).
    *   Product views (specific attributes examined).
    *   Add-to-cart events (items, quantity).
    *   Wishlist additions/removals.
    *   Coupon code attempts (success/failure).
    *   Interaction with dynamic content (e.g., recommendations, banners).
*   **Behavioral Feature Engineering:** Convert raw action data into quantifiable behavioral features:
    *   *Engagement Score*:  Weighted sum of time spent on relevant pages, number of product views, search activity.
    *   *Category Affinity*:  Proportion of time spent browsing/viewing products within specific categories.
    *   *Price Sensitivity*:  Analysis of viewed price ranges and responses to price changes.
    *   *Recency/Frequency/Monetary Value (RFM) - Extended*:  Beyond purchase history, RFM calculated for *engagement actions* (views, searches).
    *   *Deviation from Baseline*:  Calculate a user's typical behavioral profile (baseline) and track deviations in real-time.
*   **Cohort Generation (Dynamic):**
    *   Employ a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, k-means) on the behavioral feature space.
    *   Cohorts are *not* static. Users move between cohorts based on their shifting behavioral profiles.
    *   Cohort assignments are updated in near real-time (e.g., every 5-10 minutes).
*   **Predictive Offer Sculpting:**
    *   For each cohort, train a predictive model (e.g., logistic regression, gradient boosting) to forecast the probability of:
        *   "Impending Drift": Decreasing engagement score over a defined period.
        *   "Transaction Abandonment": Probability of abandoning a purchase in the current session.
    *   Based on model predictions, dynamically adjust:
        *   *Personalized Recommendations*:  Shift focus to products aligned with predicted interests.
        *   *Dynamic Pricing*:  Offer time-limited discounts or promotions.
        *   *Content Personalization*:  Show relevant banners or messages.
        *   *Proactive Assistance*:  Trigger chat support or offer step-by-step guidance.

**Pseudocode (Offer Generation):**

```
function generate_offer(user_id, current_session):
  user_behavior = get_user_behavior(user_id)
  cohort_id = assign_user_to_cohort(user_behavior)
  drift_probability = predict_drift_probability(user_behavior, cohort_id)
  abandonment_probability = predict_abandonment_probability(current_session, cohort_id)

  if abandonment_probability > 0.7:
    offer = create_discount_offer(current_session.cart_total * 0.1)
  elif drift_probability > 0.8:
    offer = create_recommendation_offer(get_top_recommendations(user_behavior, cohort_id))
  else:
    offer = None  # No offer

  return offer
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalable data pipeline for real-time data ingestion and processing.
*   Machine learning infrastructure for model training and deployment.
*   A/B testing framework to evaluate the effectiveness of different offers.
*   Privacy-preserving data handling.
