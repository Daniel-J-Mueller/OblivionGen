## Predictive Link Error Mitigation via AI-Driven Network Topology Reconstruction

**System Overview:**

A distributed system that dynamically reconstructs a network’s logical topology based on real-time traffic patterns *and* predicted error propagation, preemptively shifting traffic to avoid anticipated link failures. This goes beyond simply identifying the *source* of an error—it anticipates *where* errors will likely occur next.

**Components:**

1.  **Telemetry Agents:** Deployed on each network device (switches, routers, servers). Collects:
    *   Link utilization (bandwidth, latency, jitter)
    *   Error statistics (as per the provided patent, leveraging SNMP)
    *   Device resource utilization (CPU, memory)
    *   Traffic flow metadata (source/destination, application type)
2.  **AI Inference Engine (Centralized or Distributed):**
    *   Runs a recurrent neural network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) variant preferred – trained on historical telemetry data and network topology maps.
    *   The RNN predicts future link error rates based on current and historical patterns, resource utilization, and traffic flows.
    *   The RNN also models *error propagation* – how failures on one link will likely impact others. This requires a training dataset augmented with simulated failures and observed cascade effects.
3.  **Topology Reconstruction Module:**
    *   Based on the AI Inference Engine’s predictions, this module dynamically creates a *predicted topology*—a probabilistic map of the network showing links with a high risk of failure.
    *   This predicted topology is *layered* on top of the known, static topology.
4.  **Traffic Steering Controller:**
    *   Utilizes the predicted topology to proactively reroute traffic *before* failures occur.
    *   Employs a cost function that considers link risk, latency, bandwidth, and application priority.
    *   Communicates with network devices via a standard control plane protocol (e.g., BGP, P4).
    *   Can implement techniques like ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) with dynamic weighting based on link risk.

**Pseudocode (Traffic Steering Controller):**

```
FUNCTION steerTraffic(predictedTopology, currentTopology, trafficFlow)
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(predictedTopology, trafficFlow)
  IF riskScore > threshold THEN
    availablePaths = findAlternativePaths(currentTopology, trafficFlow)
    bestPath = selectBestPath(availablePaths, riskScore) // Considers risk, latency, bandwidth
    redirectTraffic(trafficFlow, bestPath)
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateRiskScore(predictedTopology, trafficFlow)
  // Score based on the predicted error rate of links in the flow's path
  score = 0
  FOR each link in trafficFlow.path DO
    score += predictedTopology.getLink(link).errorRate
  ENDFOR
  RETURN score
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION findAlternativePaths(currentTopology, trafficFlow)
  // Use a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra, A*) considering bandwidth and latency
  // Return a list of possible paths
  // ... Implementation omitted for brevity ...
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION selectBestPath(availablePaths, riskScore)
  // Select the best path based on risk, latency, bandwidth, and other criteria
  // ... Implementation omitted for brevity ...
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION redirectTraffic(trafficFlow, bestPath)
  // Use a control plane protocol (e.g., BGP, P4) to redirect traffic
  // ... Implementation omitted for brevity ...
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Training Data:**

*   Historical telemetry data from network devices.
*   Network topology maps.
*   Simulated network failures (generated using a network emulator).
*   Observed cascading failures from real-world network events.

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive error mitigation:**  Shifts from reactive error detection to preemptive traffic rerouting.
*   **AI-driven topology reconstruction:** Dynamically models network risk based on real-time data and predicted failures.
*   **Cascading failure prediction:**  Models how failures on one link can impact others, enabling more effective traffic steering.
*   **Layered Topology:** The predicted topology does not replace the physical topology, but enhances it.
