## Temporal Data Sharding with Predictive Expiration

**Concept:** Extend the unmodifiable data concept by introducing dynamic sharding based on predicted data usage and automated expiration/archival. Instead of a single, fixed unmodifiable period, the system learns data access patterns and proactively shards data into tiers with varying mutability and storage costs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Profiler Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors access patterns (read, write, delete) for all data objects within the system.
*   **Metrics:** Tracks frequency of access, time since last access, data type, user/application accessing data.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Neural Network) to predict future access probability for each data object.
*   **Output:**  Assigns a 'Volatility Score' (0-100) to each data object, representing its predicted access probability over a specified period (configurable, default 6 months).

**2. Tiered Storage System:**

*   **Tier 1: 'Hot' Tier:**  (High Performance, High Cost) – Data with high Volatility Scores (e.g., >75).  Fully modifiable.  Fastest storage media (e.g., NVMe SSD).
*   **Tier 2: 'Warm' Tier:** (Moderate Performance, Moderate Cost) – Data with moderate Volatility Scores (e.g., 25-75). Unmodifiable for a dynamic period determined by the Volatility Score.  SSD or high-performance HDD.
*   **Tier 3: 'Cold' Tier:** (Low Performance, Low Cost) – Data with low Volatility Scores (e.g., <25).  Unmodifiable for a long, fixed period. Archived to tape or object storage.
*   **Tier 4: 'Frozen' Tier:** (Offline, Lowest Cost) – Data with negligible Volatility Scores.  Physically offline storage (tape). Long-term archive.

**3. Dynamic Sharding & Migration Algorithm:**

*   **Trigger:** Data Profiler updates Volatility Scores at scheduled intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
*   **Logic:**
    *   If Volatility Score increases significantly, migrate data to a higher tier.
    *   If Volatility Score decreases significantly, migrate data to a lower tier.
    *   Data is automatically sharded across tiers based on its current Volatility Score.  Metadata maps logical data objects to physical storage locations.
*   **Migration Process:**
    *   Non-disruptive migration – copies data to the new tier while maintaining consistency.
    *   Automated metadata updates – ensures correct mapping of logical data objects.

**4.  Mutability Control:**

*   Tier 1: Fully modifiable.
*   Tier 2: Unmodifiable for a period calculated from the Volatility Score (e.g., Unmodifiable Period = 30 – Volatility Score days).
*   Tier 3 & 4: Unmodifiable – Read-only access.

**5.  API Extensions:**

*   `getDataVolatilityScore(dataObjectId)` – returns the current Volatility Score for a data object.
*   `migrateDataTier(dataObjectId, targetTier)` – allows administrators to manually override the automatic tier migration.
*   `setVolatilityThreshold(tier, threshold)` – allows configuration of thresholds for automatic tier migration.

**Pseudocode (Migration Logic):**

```
function migrateData(dataObject) {
  volatilityScore = getDataVolatilityScore(dataObject)
  if (volatilityScore > 80) {
    targetTier = "Tier 1"
  } else if (volatilityScore > 50) {
    targetTier = "Tier 2"
    unmodifiablePeriod = 30 - volatilityScore
  } else if (volatilityScore > 20) {
    targetTier = "Tier 3"
  } else {
    targetTier = "Tier 4"
  }

  if (dataObject.currentTier != targetTier) {
    copyData(dataObject, targetTier)
    updateMetadata(dataObject, targetTier)
    deleteData(dataObject, dataObject.currentTier) //optional, can retain old copies for a period
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

*   Optimized storage costs – automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier.
*   Improved performance – keeps frequently accessed data on faster storage media.
*   Enhanced data governance – enforces data immutability policies based on data usage.
*   Dynamic scalability – adapts to changing data access patterns.
