**Modular Box System with Integrated Projection Mapping**

**Core Concept:** A series of interconnecting, chamfered boxes (building upon the existing chamfered form factor) designed to be assembled into customizable configurations. These boxes incorporate internal, low-profile projectors and translucent surfaces, enabling dynamic projection mapping onto the exterior and interior surfaces, and even *between* connected boxes.

**Specs:**

*   **Box Dimensions:** Standardized module: 10cm x 10cm x 5cm (chamfered edges - 45-degree angle). Multiple sizes available (20cm, 30cm, etc.), all maintaining the chamfered profile and modular connection points.
*   **Material:** Primary construction – frosted acrylic for light diffusion. Internal structural supports – lightweight, high-strength polymer.
*   **Connection Mechanism:** Magnetic interlocking system with alignment guides.  Polarity ensures secure connection, while allowing for easy disassembly. Connection points located on all six faces of each box.
*   **Projector Unit:** Miniature, low-power DLP projector integrated into each box. Resolution: 854x480 (HD ready). Brightness: 20 lumens.  Projector angle adjustable via software control.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging.  Boxes connect to a central power hub or individual charging pads.
*   **Control System:** Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity.  Smartphone/tablet app for controlling projector settings, projection content, and box configurations. API available for integration with other smart home systems.
*   **Translucent Surfaces:** Each box face features a varying degree of translucency to manage light diffusion.  Some faces are fully translucent for maximum brightness, others partially translucent for ambient glow.
*   **Internal Reflectors:** Strategically placed internal reflectors enhance light distribution and create unique visual effects.
*   **Software Features:**
    *   Pre-loaded animations and patterns.
    *   User-uploadable images and videos.
    *   Real-time data visualization (e.g., audio reactive projections).
    *   Multi-box synchronization for coordinated displays.
    *   AR/VR integration for projecting virtual content onto/within the box configurations.

**Pseudocode (Configuration & Display Control):**

```
function connectBox(boxID, positionX, positionY, positionZ):
  // Validate boxID & connection location
  if (isValidConnection(boxID, positionX, positionY, positionZ)):
    // Establish magnetic connection
    activateMagnet(boxID)
    // Update internal world model with box position
    updateWorldModel(boxID, positionX, positionY, positionZ)
    return true
  else:
    return false

function setProjection(boxID, content, mode):
  // Content: image/video/animation/data stream
  // Mode:  direct projection/internal reflection/multi-box sync
  if (isValidBoxID(boxID)):
    // Load content into projector buffer
    loadContent(boxID, content)
    // Configure projector settings (brightness, angle, mode)
    setProjectorSettings(boxID, brightness, angle, mode)
    // Start projection
    startProjection(boxID)

function synchronizeBoxes(boxList, content):
    // Apply content to each box in boxList
    for each boxID in boxList:
        setProjection(boxID, content)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Dynamic art installations.
*   Ambient lighting system.
*   Interactive displays.
*   Modular shelving/storage system.
*   Gaming environments.
*   Educational tools.
