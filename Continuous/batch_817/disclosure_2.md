## Personalized Audio Environments

**Concept:** Extend user identification beyond command execution to create dynamically adjusted audio environments tailored to the identified user’s preferences and needs *before* any command is given.

**Specifications:**

**Hardware:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:**  A distributed array (3-7 mics) to improve source localization & noise cancellation.
*   **Spatial Audio Renderer:** Hardware capable of creating a multi-channel spatial audio output.
*   **Ambient Sound Sensor:** Detects existing environmental sounds (traffic, birds, etc.).
*   **User Profile Storage:** Secure, local and/or cloud-based storage for user audio preference profiles.

**Software:**

1.  **Continuous Audio Analysis Module:**
    *   Constantly monitors audio input.
    *   Performs voice activity detection (VAD).
    *   Extracts audio signatures (volume, pitch, tone, frequency, spectral characteristics).
    *   Calculates similarity scores against known user signatures (as in the base patent).
    *   Identifies command *intent* independently of explicit commands – e.g., detecting frustration, excitement, or drowsiness from voice tonality.

2.  **Environmental Sound Analysis Module:**
    *   Analyzes ambient sounds captured by the ambient sound sensor.
    *   Classifies sound events (traffic, speech, music, etc.).
    *   Estimates sound levels and spectral characteristics.

3.  **Dynamic Audio Environment Generator:**
    *   Accesses user profile data including:
        *   Preferred music genres and playlists.
        *   Ambient sound preferences (e.g., nature sounds, white noise).
        *   Preferred audio equalization settings.
        *   ‘Mood’ profiles –  sets of audio parameters triggered by inferred emotional states.
        *   Time of day/activity-based audio presets.
    *   Based on user identification *and* environmental sound analysis, dynamically adjusts:
        *   Music playback (volume, track selection, playlist curation).
        *   Ambient sound overlay (adding or masking sounds).
        *   Spatial audio rendering (creating a personalized soundscape).
        *   Equalization settings for optimal clarity and enjoyment.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Environment Adjustment):**

```
// Continuous loop
While (true) {

  // 1. Analyze Audio Input
  UserSignature = ExtractSignature(AudioInput)
  UserID = IdentifyUser(UserSignature)

  // 2. Analyze Environmental Sound
  EnvironmentSounds = AnalyzeEnvironment(AmbientSoundInput)

  // 3. Load User Profile
  Profile = LoadUserProfile(UserID)

  // 4. Determine Environment Parameters
  If (UserID != "Unknown") {
    PreferredMusic = Profile.MusicPreferences
    AmbientSounds = Profile.AmbientSoundPreferences
    EQSettings = Profile.EQSettings
    Mood = InferMood(UserSignature) // using machine learning models
    If (Mood == "Frustrated") {
      AmbientSounds = "Calming Nature Sounds"
    }
  } Else {
    // Default settings for unknown users
    PreferredMusic = "Neutral Background Music"
    AmbientSounds = "White Noise"
    EQSettings = "Default"
  }

  // 5. Adjust Audio Output
  PlayMusic(PreferredMusic)
  PlayAmbientSounds(AmbientSounds)
  ApplyEQ(EQSettings)
  RenderSpatialAudio(Music, AmbientSounds)
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond identifying *who* is speaking to anticipating *what they might want* based on their preferences and current state, creating a proactive and personalized audio experience *before* a command is even given. It blends user identification with environmental awareness to deliver an adaptive and immersive soundscape.
