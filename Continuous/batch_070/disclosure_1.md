## Adaptive Decoy Network Topology

**Concept:** Expand beyond static decoy content and deployment to create a dynamically shifting decoy *network* mirroring legitimate network traffic patterns, but with subtly altered topologies designed to trap and profile attackers.

**Specifications:**

**1. Network Topology Mirroring Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network traffic data (packet captures, flow logs) from the monitored virtual network.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze network traffic to identify frequently used communication paths, server/client relationships, and service dependencies.
    *   Construct a mirrored network topology within a separate, isolated environment (e.g., a containerized network).
    *   Populate the mirrored network with virtual instances (servers, services) mimicking those in the production network. These instances will host decoy content.
    *   Continuously update the mirrored topology to reflect changes in the production network.  Employ a delta-based update mechanism for efficiency.
*   **Output:**  A dynamically updated, virtualized network topology mirroring the production network.

**2. Decoy Traffic Injection Module:**

*   **Input:** Mirrored network topology, real-time network traffic data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Intercept outbound traffic from the production network.
    *   Redirect a portion of this traffic (based on configurable policies – e.g., traffic to specific ports, IPs, or protocols) to the mirrored network.
    *   In the mirrored network, generate decoy responses mimicking legitimate responses, but subtly altered. These alterations could include:
        *   Delayed responses
        *   Modified data payloads (e.g., slightly altered JSON data)
        *   Redirects to decoy resources
    *   Inject these decoy responses back into the production network, effectively “replacing” a portion of the legitimate responses.
*   **Output:**  Modified network traffic containing injected decoy responses.

**3. Anomaly Detection & Profiling Module:**

*   **Input:**  Network traffic data (both legitimate and decoy responses), mirrored network topology, telemetry data from the mirrored network (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption, network connections).
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor interactions with the mirrored network.
    *   Detect anomalies such as:
        *   Access to non-existent resources
        *   Unexpected traffic patterns
        *   Attempts to exploit vulnerabilities
        *   Large-scale data requests
    *   Profile attackers based on their interactions with the mirrored network (e.g., IP address, tools used, targets).
    *   Correlate attacker profiles with the original source of the intercepted traffic in the production network.
*   **Output:**  Alerts about potential attacks, attacker profiles, and correlation data.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detect_anomaly(traffic_data, mirrored_topology):
  expected_behavior = calculate_expected_behavior(mirrored_topology)

  for event in traffic_data:
    deviation = calculate_deviation(event, expected_behavior)

    if deviation > threshold:
      anomaly = create_anomaly_report(event, deviation)
      alert(anomaly)

  return anomalies
```

**Innovation:**

This system goes beyond simply deploying static decoy content. It creates a dynamic, mirrored network that can adapt to changing traffic patterns and proactively trap and profile attackers. The use of a mirrored topology allows for more realistic decoys and more accurate detection of malicious activity.  It shifts from passive detection to *active engagement* with attackers, providing deeper insights into their tactics and motivations. It also provides a 'sandbox' for analysis without impacting production systems.
