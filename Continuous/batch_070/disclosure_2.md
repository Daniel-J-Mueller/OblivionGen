## Adaptive Environmental Storytelling System

**Concept:** Extend the voice command/multi-device interaction to create dynamic, personalized environmental storytelling experiences. Leverage spatial audio, localized lighting, and interconnected device control to build immersive narratives triggered by user voice commands.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Narrative Engine" – a software module running on a central hub (could be a smart speaker, dedicated server, or cloud service).
*   **Device Mesh:** Support for a heterogeneous network of devices: smart speakers, smart lights, smart displays, robotic actuators (e.g., moving toys or automated blinds), spatial audio emitters.
*   **Voice Command Processing:** Enhanced speech recognition to identify not just commands, but *intent* and *emotional tone*. Include “story prompts” - ambiguous phrases triggering branching narrative paths.
*   **Spatial Audio Mapping:** Implement a system for assigning audio sources to specific physical locations within the environment. Allow dynamic adjustment of volume and panning based on user position and narrative context.
*   **Lighting Control API:**  Provide granular control over individual smart lights - color, brightness, flicker effects.  Enable synchronized lighting changes to accompany audio cues and narrative events.
*   **Actuator Control API:**  Interface with robotic actuators to create physical events within the environment - opening/closing blinds, moving objects, triggering haptic feedback.
*   **Narrative Authoring Tool:** A visual scripting interface allowing users to define narrative sequences, assign audio/lighting/actuator events to specific triggers, and create branching paths based on user input.
*   **Dynamic Context Awareness:** Integrate with environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, ambient light) to dynamically adjust narrative elements and create more realistic experiences.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Engine):**

```
// Initialize Device Mesh
devices = connectToDevices()

// Listen for Voice Commands
while (true) {
  command = receiveVoiceCommand()
  intent = analyzeIntent(command)

  // Check for Story Prompts
  if (intent == "story_prompt") {
    narrative_path = selectNarrativePath(command)
    current_event = getNextEvent(narrative_path)

    // Trigger Event
    triggerEvent(current_event)
  } else {
    // Handle Standard Commands
    processCommand(command)
  }
}

function triggerEvent(event) {
  // Play Audio
  playAudio(event.audio_file, event.location, event.volume)

  // Control Lighting
  for (light in event.lights) {
    setLight(light, event.lights[light].color, event.lights[light].brightness)
  }

  // Control Actuators
  for (actuator in event.actuators) {
    moveActuator(actuator, event.actuators[actuator].position)
  }
}
```

**Example Scenario:**

User says, “Tell me a story about the forest.” (Story Prompt)

The system selects a forest-themed narrative path.

*   Spatial audio plays ambient forest sounds (birds, wind).
*   Smart lights dim and shift to green hues simulating dappled sunlight.
*   A small robotic animal figurine moves slightly, appearing to emerge from under a bush.
*   A voice narrates the beginning of the story.

As the story progresses, the system dynamically adjusts the audio, lighting, and actuator events to create an immersive and engaging experience.
