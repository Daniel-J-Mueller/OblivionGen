## Dynamic Narrative Visual Effects

**Concept:** Extend targeted visual effects beyond simple color/texture alterations to impact *narrative* elements visible within the video stream itself, dynamically shifting the experience based on viewer data and context.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core System: Narrative Effect Engine (NEE)**

*   **Input:** Video stream, viewer profile data (demographics, viewing history, emotional response – inferred from facial/vocal analysis via device camera/microphone, actively selected preferences), contextual data (time of day, location, current events).
*   **Processing:** The NEE analyzes input data and selects/generates narrative visual effects (NVEs).  NVEs are categorized and tagged based on emotional impact, narrative relevance, and computational cost.
*   **Output:** Modified video stream with NVEs applied.

**II. Narrative Visual Effect (NVE) Types (examples):**

*   **Character Focus Shift:**  Subtly alters focus/depth of field to draw viewer attention to specific characters based on their emotional alignment with the viewer’s profile. (e.g., Viewer is empathetic, focus is drawn to characters expressing sadness).
*   **Symbolic Overlay:**  Dynamically adds or enhances symbolic elements within the scene. (e.g., A character is making a decision; a faint overlay of a scale appears, subtly indicating the weight of the choice). The symbols are selected from a library and adapted based on the scene's aesthetics.
*   **Environmental Tone Shift:** Modifies the color palette and ambience of the environment to reflect the viewer’s emotional state. (e.g., Viewer is stressed; scene becomes desaturated and darker).  Uses a dynamic LUT system.
*   **‘Ghost’ Character Insertion:** For historical or fictional content, insert translucent “ghosts” of characters who *could* have been present in the scene, representing potential alternative outcomes or unseen influences.  Requires skeletal tracking of existing characters for correct placement and occlusion.
*   **Augmented Prop Significance:** Highlight (glowing, slight scale change) props related to character arc/plot developments. Requires object recognition within the scene.
*    **Subliminal Emotional Cueing:** Micro-flashes of color or shape subtly influencing the viewers mood. (Requires careful ethical evaluation of use cases).

**III.  Implementation Details:**

1.  **Effect Library:** A curated library of NVEs, categorized by emotional impact, narrative relevance, computational cost, and aesthetic style.  Each NVE is defined as a procedural shader/effect graph.

2.  **Dynamic Effect Selection Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    function select_NVEs(viewer_data, scene_data, effect_library):
        relevant_effects = []
        for effect in effect_library:
            if effect.narrative_relevance_tags match scene_data.tags AND \
               effect.emotional_impact_profile matches viewer_data.emotional_profile AND \
               viewer_data.preferences.allowed_effects contains effect:
                relevant_effects.append(effect)

        # Sort by computational cost (ascending) and emotional impact (descending)
        sorted_effects = sort(relevant_effects, by=[cost, impact])

        # Select top N effects (based on viewer's device capabilities and preferences)
        selected_effects = sorted_effects[:N]

        return selected_effects
    ```

3.  **Real-time Rendering Pipeline:**  Utilize a modular rendering pipeline capable of applying multiple NVEs concurrently.  Shaders are dynamically compiled and applied to the video stream.

4.  **Viewer Control:** Provide viewers with control over the intensity and types of NVEs applied.  This allows for personalization and addresses potential discomfort or distraction.

5.  **Ethical Considerations:** Implement safeguards to prevent manipulation or exploitation of viewers through NVEs.  Transparency and viewer control are paramount.

**IV.  Hardware Requirements:**

*   GPU with sufficient memory and processing power.
*   High-bandwidth network connection.
*   Device with camera and microphone for emotional analysis (optional).
