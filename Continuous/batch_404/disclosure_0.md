## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Classification via Multi-Modal Temporal Fusion

**Concept:** Extend voice activity detection beyond simple speech/no-speech to *classify* the acoustic environment in real-time, leveraging the bone and air conduction microphones not just for VAD, but for detailed scene analysis. This data can then drive adaptive noise cancellation or augment augmented reality experiences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Existing bone conduction (BC) and air conduction (AC) microphones.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded system with sufficient processing power for real-time signal processing and machine learning inference (e.g., ARM Cortex-A series).
*   **Memory:** Sufficient RAM to store signal data, model parameters, and intermediate results.
*   **Optional:** Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – provides head/body movement data for context.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Signal Acquisition:**  Simultaneous digital sampling of BC and AC microphone signals.  Sample rate: 44.1 kHz minimum. Bit depth: 24 bits.
*   **Pre-processing:**
    *   **Noise Reduction:** Initial noise reduction applied to both channels.
    *   **Framing & Windowing:**  Signals divided into overlapping frames (e.g., 20-40ms frames with 50% overlap). Hamming window applied to each frame.
*   **Feature Extraction:** 
    *   **BC Channel:**
        *   Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR)
        *   Energy (RMS)
        *   Spectral centroid
        *   Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) – 13 coefficients.
    *   **AC Channel:**
        *   ZCR
        *   Energy (RMS)
        *   Spectral centroid
        *   MFCCs – 13 coefficients.
        *   Environmental sound classification cues (birdsong, traffic, human voices beyond the primary speaker) – pre-trained audio event detection model.
*   **Temporal Fusion & Scene Classification:**
    *   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** Bidirectional LSTM or GRU network.
        *   **Input:** Concatenated feature vectors from BC and AC channels for each frame.
        *   **Hidden Layer Size:**  Experiment with sizes between 128 and 512.
        *   **Output Layer:**  Softmax layer with a number of output classes representing the acoustic scene (e.g., "Quiet Office," "Busy Street," "Restaurant," "Home").
    *   **IMU Integration (Optional):**  Concatenate IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope readings) with the RNN input to incorporate contextual information about head/body movement.
*   **Adaptive Filtering:**
    *   Based on the classified acoustic scene, dynamically adjust noise cancellation algorithms (e.g., Active Noise Cancellation) or audio equalization settings.
*   **AR/VR Augmentation:**
    *   Transmit the classified acoustic scene data to an AR/VR application to tailor the virtual environment to match the real-world soundscape.
    *   Spatial audio rendering informed by both bone and air conduction signals.

**3. Pseudocode - RNN Training:**

```
// Training Data: Labeled dataset of BC/AC signals with corresponding acoustic scene labels.

// 1. Data Preprocessing: Apply feature extraction to all training data.

// 2. RNN Model Initialization: Create a bidirectional LSTM/GRU network with appropriate layer sizes.

// 3. Optimization Algorithm: Adam or RMSprop. Learning Rate: 0.001.

// 4. Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy.

// 5. Training Loop:

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in training_data:
        input_data, labels = batch
        predicted_output = RNN_Model(input_data)
        loss = Calculate_Categorical_Cross_Entropy(predicted_output, labels)
        Update_RNN_Model_Weights(loss)
        Print_Training_Progress(epoch, loss)

// 6. Model Validation: Evaluate model performance on a separate validation dataset.
```

**4. Novelty & Potential:**

This system goes beyond VAD to create a *context-aware* audio processing pipeline. By combining bone and air conduction information with machine learning, it can intelligently adapt to the surrounding environment, enhancing audio quality and user experience. The use of bone conduction as a supplementary input channel provides robustness against ambient noise and allows for more accurate scene classification. This has applications in hearing aids, AR/VR, communication devices, and environmental monitoring.
