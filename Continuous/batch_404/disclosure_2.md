## Dynamic Glyph Decomposition & Reassembly

**Concept:** Extend the weight/versioning approach to *individual glyph components* rather than entire fonts. Instead of swapping full font weights, decompose glyphs into constituent strokes/shapes, and dynamically reassemble them with varying thicknesses or styles based on display update type and/or perceived viewing conditions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Glyph Library:**  A master glyph library containing base glyphs *and* their decomposed stroke/shape components. Each component has associated parameters for thickness, rounding, and stylistic variations.  Components are stored as vector paths.
*   **Decomposition Engine:** Software module that takes a glyph (from a requested font/weight) and decomposes it into its constituent components.  Uses a defined decomposition algorithm (e.g., based on curvature, intersection points).
*   **Reassembly Engine:**  Software module that takes the decomposed glyph components and reassembles them with modified parameters.  Parameters are adjusted based on:
    *   **Update Type:**  Flashing vs. non-flashing (as in the provided patent).  Non-flashing updates prioritize sharpness, potentially using thinner strokes. Flashing updates prioritize visibility, potentially using thicker strokes or heavier outlines.
    *   **Ambient Light Sensor Data:** Real-time ambient light level. Brighter environments permit finer strokes, while dimmer environments require bolder strokes.
    *   **Viewing Angle Estimation:** Using camera data (if available), estimate the user's viewing angle.  Adjust stroke weights and curvature to optimize readability from that angle.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:**  The reassembly engine integrates seamlessly into the existing rendering pipeline.  Reassembled glyphs are treated as standard vector paths for rasterization.
*   **Memory Management:** Utilize efficient vector path compression techniques and caching mechanisms to minimize memory footprint.

**Pseudocode (Reassembly Engine):**

```
function reassembleGlyph(glyph, updateType, lightLevel, viewingAngle):
  decompositionResult = decomposeGlyph(glyph) // Use Decomposition Engine
  components = decompositionResult.components

  for each component in components:
    if updateType == "flashing":
      component.thickness = baseThickness * 1.2 // Increase thickness
      component.rounding = baseRounding * 0.8 // Reduce rounding
    else: // non-flashing
      component.thickness = baseThickness * 0.9
      component.rounding = baseRounding * 1.2

    if lightLevel < threshold1:
      component.thickness *= 1.1 // Further increase thickness in low light
    if viewingAngle > angleThreshold:
       component.curvature += slightAdjust  //modify curve

  reassembledGlyph = createGlyphFromComponents(components) //Combine vector paths
  return reassembledGlyph
```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   Requires an ambient light sensor.
*   Optional: Camera for viewing angle estimation.
*   Increased processing load for decomposition and reassembly.  Requires a reasonably powerful processor.
