**Adaptive Data Mirroring with Predictive Failure Analysis**

**Concept:** Instead of simply moving Logical Units (LUs) based on read/write cycles and read disturbance, proactively mirror data to secondary storage based on *predicted* block failure rates derived from real-time error correction data. This creates a tiered storage approach where frequently accessed, critical data resides on rapidly refreshed/mirrored blocks, while less critical data resides on standard blocks.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing flash memory architecture (NAND/NOR).
    *   Secondary storage (NAND, SSD, or even a fast DRAM cache) – scalable capacity.
    *   Dedicated Error Correction Code (ECC) monitoring module within the controller.
    *   Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) engine – a co-processor or dedicated logic block.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **ECC Monitoring Module:** Continuously monitors ECC correction counts *per block*. This isn't just pass/fail, but the *number* of single-bit, double-bit, etc. errors corrected.
    *   **PFA Engine:**
        *   Algorithm: Bayesian network or machine learning model trained on ECC data, block age, temperature, and write amplification.  Outputs a ‘Block Health Score’ (BHS) from 0-100.
        *   Thresholds:  Configurable BHS thresholds to trigger mirroring actions.
        *   Prioritization: Prioritizes mirroring of blocks containing critical data (identified by metadata tags).
    *   **Mirroring Manager:**
        *   Data Layout: Logical Units are mirrored to secondary storage.  Can employ full mirroring or incremental mirroring (only changed blocks).
        *   Background Operation: Mirroring happens in the background during idle time or low-usage periods.
        *   Failover Mechanism:  Seamless failover to mirrored data in case of block failure.
    *   **Metadata:** Each Logical Unit contains metadata indicating:
        *   Criticality Level (user-defined or system-assigned).
        *   Current Mirror Status (mirrored, partially mirrored, not mirrored).
        *   Mirror Location (address on secondary storage).

**Pseudocode (PFA Engine):**

```
// Function: CalculateBlockHealthScore(block_address, ECC_data, block_age, temperature, write_amplification)
// Inputs: Block address, ECC correction counts (single, double, etc.), age in days, temperature in Celsius, write amplification factor
// Output: Block Health Score (0-100)

function CalculateBlockHealthScore(block_address, ECC_data, block_age, temperature, write_amplification):
    // Weighted sum of factors
    score = (
        0.4 * (1 - normalize(ECC_data.single_bit_errors)) + // Lower errors = higher score
        0.3 * (1 - normalize(ECC_data.double_bit_errors)) +
        0.15 * (1 - normalize(block_age / max_block_age)) + // Newer block = higher score
        0.1 * (1 - normalize((temperature - optimal_temperature) / max_temperature_difference)) + // Optimal temperature = higher score
        0.05 * (1 - normalize(write_amplification / max_write_amplification)) // Lower WA = higher score
    )
    score = constrain(score, 0, 100) // Ensure score is within bounds
    return score
```

**Operation:**

1.  The ECC Monitoring Module tracks ECC correction counts for each block.
2.  The PFA Engine calculates the Block Health Score (BHS) based on ECC data, block age, temperature, and write amplification.
3.  The Mirroring Manager monitors BHS. If BHS falls below a predefined threshold, the manager initiates mirroring of Logical Units in that block to secondary storage.
4.  Mirroring can be performed incrementally to minimize performance impact.
5.  In case of block failure, the system automatically fails over to the mirrored data.
6.  BHS is recalculated periodically and mirroring actions are adjusted accordingly.
