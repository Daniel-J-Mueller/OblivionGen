## Dynamic Credential Chain with Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the short-term credential system to create a dynamic chain of credentials, where each credential's validity and privileges are influenced by a reputation score accumulated through successful resource access. This allows for granular, adaptive access control, minimizing blast radius in case of compromise, and incentivizing secure behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Reputation Engine:** A service responsible for calculating and maintaining reputation scores for accounts and, potentially, individual devices. Scores are influenced by:
    *   Successful resource access (positive contribution).
    *   Failed access attempts (negative contribution).
    *   Reported security incidents related to the account/device (significant negative contribution).
    *   Time-based decay â€“ reputation gradually decreases over time.
*   **Credential Issuance Service (CIS):** Modified to incorporate reputation scores when issuing short-term credentials.
*   **Resource Access Proxy (RAP):** Intercepts resource requests, validates credentials, and enforces access control policies based on both credential validity *and* associated reputation score.

**2. Credential Chain Mechanism:**

*   Initial Long-Term Key:  The customer possesses a traditional long-term key (password, certificate, etc.).
*   First-Level Session: Using the provided patent's concepts, the long-term key is used to request an initial session token. This token includes a public session key and a *base reputation score* derived from the initial authentication (e.g., strong password = higher initial score).
*   Subsequent Session Requests: Instead of directly requesting another session token from the CIS using only the long-term key, the *current* session token is used. The CIS validates the current token, *adds* a reputation-based adjustment to the score (positive if good behavior, negative if anomalies detected), and issues a *new* session token.  Each new token represents a link in the credential chain.
*   Credential Chain Depth: A configurable maximum depth for the credential chain. Prevents infinite loops and provides a defined rollback point.

**3.  Reputation-Based Access Control:**

*   RAP Evaluation: When a resource request arrives, the RAP extracts the public session key from the token, validates the signature, *and* retrieves the associated reputation score from the Reputation Engine.
*   Dynamic Access Policies:  Access is granted based on a policy that considers *both* token validity *and* reputation score. Examples:
    *   High Reputation: Full access to requested resources.
    *   Medium Reputation: Access to most resources, but with rate limiting or monitoring.
    *   Low Reputation: Limited access or complete denial of service.
*   Adaptive Policies: The RAP can dynamically adjust access policies based on real-time reputation fluctuations.

**4. Pseudocode (RAP Evaluation):**

```
function evaluateRequest(request, token):
  publicKey = extractPublicKey(token)
  isValidToken = validateToken(token, publicKey)
  if (isValidToken == false):
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  reputationScore = getReputationScore(token)

  accessLevel = determineAccessLevel(reputationScore)

  if (accessLevel == FULL_ACCESS):
    return ACCESS_GRANTED
  else if (accessLevel == LIMITED_ACCESS):
    applyRateLimiting(request)
    logAccessAttempt(request, token)
    return ACCESS_GRANTED
  else:
    logAccessAttempt(request, token)
    return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**5.  Key Management Considerations:**

*   Revocation: Implement a mechanism to revoke compromised or malicious credentials at any point in the chain.
*   Rotation: Regularly rotate session keys to minimize the impact of potential key compromise.
*   Secure Storage: Protect reputation scores and key management data with strong encryption and access controls.

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple short-term credentials to create a dynamically adapting access control system. It introduces the concept of a 'reputation-backed' credential, incentivizing secure behavior and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. The credential chain mechanism provides a traceable history of access attempts and facilitates robust security auditing.
