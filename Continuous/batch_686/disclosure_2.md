## Adaptive Multi-Path Delay Profiling System

**Concept:** Extend the fractional delay measurement to *multiple* simultaneous paths, allowing for characterization of complex signal propagation environments (e.g., multi-path wireless channels, complex cable harnesses). Instead of measuring a single delay, we'll create a 'delay profile' – a vector representing delays across multiple paths.

**Specs:**

*   **Core:** Utilize the existing pseudo-random sequence generation/sampling framework. Instantiate *M* parallel instances of the PLL/LFSR system detailed in the patent. Each instance operates identically but is connected to a physically separate transmission path.
*   **Path Separation:** Transmission paths should be physically diverse (e.g., different cables, antennas with polarization diversity, distinct fiber optic strands).  Paths *do not* need to be fully isolated; the system will *resolve* overlapping signals.
*   **Sequence Orthogonality:** Each parallel system generates a slightly *different* pseudo-random sequence (using a seed variation). This allows for de-multiplexing at the receiver side.  Sequences should be chosen to maximize cross-correlation minimization. (Walsh-Hadamard codes are a candidate.)
*   **Receiver:** The receiver comprises *M* correlation engines (one per path). Each engine correlates the received signal with its corresponding pseudo-random sequence. The output is a correlation peak, the location of which indicates the delay on that path.
*   **Delay Profile Construction:** The correlation peaks from all *M* engines are compiled into a delay profile vector.
*   **Resolution Enhancement:** Implement a sub-sample refinement algorithm. After initial peak detection, a localized interpolation is performed around each peak to improve delay resolution beyond the sampling rate of the PLL. This could leverage spline interpolation or similar methods.
*   **Dynamic Path Selection:** Add a mechanism to dynamically select which transmission paths are active. This could be controlled by a user or an automated algorithm that selects paths based on signal strength, quality, or other criteria.
*   **Hardware:**
    *   *M* LFSRs.
    *   *M* PLLs.
    *   *M* Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) – one per path.
    *   High-speed Digital Signal Processor (DSP) or FPGA to implement correlation and interpolation algorithms.
    *   Data acquisition and control interface (e.g., USB, Ethernet).
*   **Software:**
    *   Path control and selection interface.
    *   Data acquisition and processing algorithms (correlation, interpolation).
    *   Delay profile visualization and analysis tools.

**Pseudocode (DSP/FPGA implementation):**

```
// Initialize M parallel LFSR/PLL systems

FOR each path i FROM 0 TO M-1:
    GENERATE pseudo-random sequence using LFSR (seed = i)
    TRANSMIT sequence on path i

// Receive signals on all paths
FOR each path i FROM 0 TO M-1:
    RECEIVE signal on path i
    CORRELATE received signal with corresponding pseudo-random sequence
    DETECT peak in correlation function (initial delay estimate)
    PERFORM sub-sample refinement around peak (spline interpolation)
    STORE refined delay estimate

CREATE delay profile vector from refined delay estimates
OUTPUT delay profile vector
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Characterizing multi-path wireless channels.
*   Testing and validating complex cable harnesses.
*   Time-domain reflectometry with improved resolution.
*   Optical fiber characterization.
*   Advanced radar signal processing.
