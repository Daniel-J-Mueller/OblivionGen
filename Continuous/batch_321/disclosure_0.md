## Adaptive Referrer Obfuscation with Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the existing referrer scrubbing to incorporate user behavioral analysis, proactively altering referrer data *before* a request is made, based on predicted risk, rather than solely reacting to destination. This system creates ‘synthetic referrers’ that appear legitimate while masking user tracking.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Collect data from web browser (with user permission - crucial) including: browsing history (domain level only, no specific URLs), frequency of visits to different domains, time of day browsing, search queries (anonymized), detected ad blockers, VPN usage, and browser extensions.
*   **Data Processing:** Employ federated learning techniques to maintain privacy.  Data is processed *locally* on the user’s machine. A global model is updated periodically with model *gradients*, not raw data.
*   **Risk Scoring:** A local risk score is generated based on the behavioral data, indicating the likelihood of tracking or malicious intent associated with the current browsing session.  Higher scores indicate a greater need for obfuscation.

**2. Synthetic Referrer Generation Module:**

*   **Referrer Database:** Maintain a database of common, legitimate referrer patterns, categorized by domain and browsing context (e.g., search engine results, social media links, direct navigation).  This database is updated via web scraping and user contributions (opt-in).
*   **Policy Engine:** Based on the risk score and the destination URL, the policy engine selects or generates a synthetic referrer. 
    *   **Low Risk:**  Pass through the original referrer (with minor modifications like parameter removal).
    *   **Medium Risk:**  Select a plausible referrer from the database, matching the destination domain.
    *   **High Risk:** Generate a completely synthetic referrer, based on the user's browsing history and typical referrer patterns.  This could involve combining elements from multiple sources or creating a completely fictional referrer.
*   **Referrer Diversity:** Implement a randomization factor to prevent consistent synthetic referrer patterns, making tracking more difficult.

**3.  Adaptive Obfuscation Levels:**

*   **Granular Control:** Allow users to specify their preferred level of obfuscation (e.g., minimal, balanced, maximum).
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Adjust obfuscation levels automatically based on the website's privacy policy (obtained via web scraping and analysis). Websites with overly aggressive tracking practices trigger higher obfuscation.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the effectiveness of obfuscation techniques and adapt them based on observed tracking attempts.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_referrer(destination_url, current_url, user_risk_score, user_obfuscation_level):

  if user_obfuscation_level == "minimal":
    return current_url  // Pass through original referrer

  if user_risk_score < 30: // Low Risk
    return select_plausible_referrer(destination_url)

  if user_risk_score >= 30 && user_risk_score < 70: // Medium Risk
    synthetic_referrer = generate_synthetic_referrer(user_browsing_history, destination_url)
    return synthetic_referrer

  if user_risk_score >= 70: // High Risk
    synthetic_referrer = generate_randomized_synthetic_referrer(user_browsing_history, destination_url)
    return synthetic_referrer
```

**System Components:**

*   Browser Extension (primary interface)
*   Local Machine Learning Model
*   Remote Update Server (for model updates and database updates)
*   Policy Database (hosted remotely)

**Future Considerations:**

*   Integration with decentralized identity solutions
*   Support for browser fingerprinting mitigation
*   Development of a “referral trust score” for websites (based on privacy practices and tracking behavior)
