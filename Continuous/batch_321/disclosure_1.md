## Acoustic Presence Confirmation & Dynamic Network Topology Mapping

**Concept:** Augment presence detection with localized acoustic analysis to confirm human presence and dynamically map network topology based on detected device interactions, creating a more robust and detailed understanding of occupancy.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Directional Microphone Array:** Integrated into a central hub (e.g., smart home hub, ceiling fixture). Minimum 4 microphones, capable of beamforming and noise cancellation.
*   **Edge Processing Unit:** Integrated with the microphone array, capable of real-time audio analysis (see Software Specifications).
*   **Existing Network Interface:** Access to existing home/office network data (as per the provided patent’s data streams).
*   **Optional: Low-Power Bluetooth Beacons:** Strategically placed within the location. Used for triangulation and enhanced localization.

**2. Software Specifications:**

*   **Acoustic Event Detection Module:** Analyzes audio streams for distinct human-generated sounds (speech, footsteps, movement).  Utilizes machine learning models trained on a large dataset of environmental sounds.  Confidence levels assigned to each detected event.
*   **Confidence Fusion Algorithm:** Combines confidence values from the network-based presence detection (as outlined in the provided patent) with confidence values from the Acoustic Event Detection Module. Weighted averaging or more sophisticated Bayesian inference used.
*   **Network Interaction Mapping:** Monitors communication patterns between devices on the network (packet frequency, data exchange volume, connection duration).  Creates a dynamic graph representing network topology.
*   **Device Association Engine:**  Correlates acoustic event locations with active devices on the network. Uses triangulation (with Bluetooth beacons, if available) and signal strength analysis to associate sounds with specific devices.
*   **Presence Confirmation Logic:**
    *   If network-based detection confidence is *high*, the system passively listens for acoustic events in the predicted location. If acoustic events are detected, presence is *confirmed*.
    *   If network-based detection confidence is *low*, the system actively scans for acoustic events, attempting to locate sources.  Successful localization *initiates* network-based detection.
    *   If acoustic events are detected but cannot be correlated with any active devices, the system flags a potential anomaly (e.g., unauthorized presence, malfunctioning devices).
*    **Data Logging & Anomaly Detection:** Logs all presence data, network interaction maps, and anomaly flags for historical analysis and proactive system maintenance.

**3. Pseudocode - Presence Confirmation Logic:**

```
FUNCTION ConfirmPresence(networkConfidence, acousticData):
    IF networkConfidence > thresholdHigh:
        acousticEventsDetected = AnalyzeAcousticData(acousticData)
        IF acousticEventsDetected:
            RETURN PresenceConfirmed
        ELSE:
            RETURN PresenceUnconfirmed
    ELSE:
        activeScan = InitiateActiveAcousticScan()
        IF activeScanSuccessful:
            location = DetermineAcousticEventLocation(activeScan)
            associatedDevice = FindAssociatedDevice(location)
            IF associatedDevice:
                StartNetworkBasedDetection(associatedDevice)
                RETURN PresenceInitiated
            ELSE:
                FlagAnomaly()
                RETURN PresenceAnomaly
        ELSE:
            RETURN PresenceUnconfirmed
```

**4. Enhancement – “Ghost Device” Detection:**

If acoustic signals are consistently detected in a location *without* corresponding network activity, the system will create a “ghost device” profile, logging the acoustic signature and location. This allows for detection of non-networked devices or individuals and can be used to refine the presence detection model.
