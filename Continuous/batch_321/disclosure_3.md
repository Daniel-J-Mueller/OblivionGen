## Dynamic Precision Systolic Array with Data-Dependent Normalization

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** A systolic array capable of dynamically adjusting the precision of calculations *within* the array, based on the statistical properties of the data being processed. This builds on the concept of normalization described in the source patent but moves beyond a simple pre-normalization step.

**II. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Stream Analysis Module (DSAM):**  Integrated *before* the systolic array. This module analyzes incoming data streams in parallel. It calculates running statistics – mean, variance, maximum absolute value – for each input channel. This analysis happens *continuously*.
*   **Precision Control Unit (PCU):**  Receives statistical data from the DSAM.  Uses a lookup table or algorithmic function to map these statistics to a desired precision level (number of bits for significand and exponent) for each input channel.  Precision levels range from 8-bit to 32-bit floating point.
*   **Dynamic Normalizer/Denormalizer:** Each processing element (PE) within the systolic array includes a configurable normalization/denormalization unit. This unit applies a scaling factor based on the precision level dictated by the PCU.  Handles both normalization *and* controlled denormalization (allowing for graceful handling of underflow).
*   **Configurable Multiplier/Adder:**  The multiplier and adder within each PE are designed to operate with variable precision. This is accomplished through a combination of bit-width switching and configurable rounding modes.
*   **Output Reconstruction Unit:**  After the systolic array, a reconstruction unit re-scales the output data to a consistent output format, compensating for any scaling performed within the array.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Data Input:** Data streams are fed into the DSAM.
2.  **Statistical Analysis:** DSAM calculates running statistics.
3.  **Precision Mapping:** PCU maps statistics to precision levels.
4.  **Dynamic Normalization:** Each PE dynamically normalizes/denormalizes inputs based on assigned precision.
5.  **Systolic Computation:** The systolic array performs computations using variable precision.
6.  **Output Reconstruction:** Output data is re-scaled to a consistent format.

**IV. Pseudocode (Illustrative - for a single PE):**

```pseudocode
// Input:  data_in (16-bit float), weight (16-bit float), partial_sum (32-bit float)
// Output: updated_partial_sum (32-bit float)

// Receive precision level from PCU (e.g., 8, 16, 24, 32)
precision_level = receive_precision_level();

// Dynamic Normalization/Denormalization
normalized_data = dynamic_normalize(data_in, precision_level);
normalized_weight = dynamic_normalize(weight, precision_level);

// Perform Multiplication (using reduced precision hardware)
product = multiply(normalized_data, normalized_weight, precision_level);

// Perform Addition
updated_partial_sum = add(product, partial_sum, precision_level);

// Output updated partial sum
output updated_partial_sum;
```

**V. Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Reconfigurable Logic:**  Extensive use of reconfigurable logic (e.g., FPGAs) to implement the configurable multipliers, adders, and normalization units.
*   **Memory Hierarchy:**  A carefully designed memory hierarchy to minimize data movement and provide sufficient bandwidth for the variable precision data.
*   **Low-Precision Arithmetic Units:** Development of optimized low-precision arithmetic units (8-bit, 16-bit) to reduce power consumption and hardware complexity.

**VI. Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Performance:**  By dynamically adjusting precision, the system can accelerate computations by using lower-precision arithmetic when sufficient accuracy is not required.
*   **Reduced Power Consumption:** Lower precision arithmetic reduces power consumption.
*   **Increased Throughput:**  Faster computations and reduced data movement increase throughput.
*   **Adaptive Accuracy:** The system can adapt its accuracy to meet the requirements of the application.
