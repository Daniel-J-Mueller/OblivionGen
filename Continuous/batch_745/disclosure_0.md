## Dynamic Cart Composition with Predictive Bundling

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic UI adaptation to proactively *compose* cart contents based on predicted user preference and synergistic item relationships, rather than simply re-ranking existing items or offering alternative merchants.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Modeling:**

*   **Item Relationship Graph:** Construct a graph database representing relationships between items. Relationships are weighted based on:
    *   Co-purchase frequency (items frequently bought together).
    *   Complementary usage (e.g., phone + charger, camera + memory card).
    *   Semantic similarity (using item descriptions and attributes).
    *   User-defined "bundles" (if applicable).
*   **User Preference Profile:** Expand the existing preference profile to include:
    *   Explicitly saved bundles/sets.
    *   Implicit bundle preferences (inferred from purchase history, dwell time on product pages, and “saved for later” items).
    *   "Bundle Sensitivity" score (a measure of how open the user is to receiving bundle suggestions - determined from past interactions with bundle UI elements).

**2. Real-time Cart Composition Engine:**

*   **Cart Trigger Point:** Initiate bundle suggestion logic when:
    *   A minimum number of items are added to the cart (e.g., 3+).
    *   A significant pause occurs during the shopping session (user is browsing, not actively adding).
    *   The user navigates to the cart page.
*   **Bundle Candidate Generation:**
    *   Query the Item Relationship Graph for items related to those *already* in the cart.
    *   Filter candidates based on user preference profile (e.g., prioritize items with high predicted affinity, exclude items the user has explicitly rejected).
    *   Generate multiple bundle candidates, each representing a potential addition to the cart.
*   **Bundle Scoring:**
    *   Calculate a "Bundle Score" for each candidate based on:
        *   Affinity score (predicted user preference).
        *   Synergy score (strength of relationship between items).
        *   Price synergy (potential discounts for buying as a bundle).
        *   Shipping cost reduction (if applicable).
*   **UI Presentation:**
    *   Dynamically generate a "Complete Your Bundle" section on the cart page.
    *   Present the top-scoring bundle candidates as visually appealing cards.
    *   Highlight the potential benefits of completing the bundle (discount, free shipping, enhanced functionality).
    *   A/B test different UI layouts and messaging to optimize conversion rates.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
function generateBundleSuggestions(cartItems, userProfile) {
  relationshipGraph = getRelationshipGraph()
  bundleCandidates = []

  for each item in cartItems {
    relatedItems = relationshipGraph.getRelatedItems(item)
    for each relatedItem in relatedItems {
      if (relatedItem not in cartItems) {
        bundleCandidate = {
          item: relatedItem,
          affinityScore: calculateAffinityScore(relatedItem, userProfile),
          synergyScore: calculateSynergyScore(item, relatedItem),
          priceSynergy: calculatePriceSynergy(item, relatedItem)
        }
        bundleCandidates.push(bundleCandidate)
      }
    }
  }

  bundleCandidates.sort(by: bundleCandidate.affinityScore + bundleCandidate.synergyScore + bundleCandidate.priceSynergy, descending)

  return bundleCandidates.slice(0, 3) // Return top 3 candidates
}
```

**4. Extended Data Points:**

*   **Contextual Bundling:** Consider the user's current activity and location. Suggest bundles relevant to their immediate needs (e.g., travel accessories if they are booking a flight).
*   **Seasonal/Event-Based Bundling:** Leverage seasonal trends and events to suggest relevant bundles (e.g., grilling supplies for summer, holiday gift sets).
*   **Social Bundling:** Suggest bundles based on what other users with similar profiles have purchased together.
*   **AI-Driven Bundle Creation:** Employ machine learning algorithms to identify novel bundle combinations that might not be obvious from existing data.
