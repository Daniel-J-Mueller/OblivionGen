## Secure Context Transfer for IoT Devices

**Specification:** A system for establishing secure, temporary contexts between a central service and numerous, low-power IoT devices, leveraging ephemeral identifiers and probabilistic authentication.

**Core Concept:**  Rather than transferring a persistent user service identifier to an IoT device (which could be compromised), establish a short-lived, device-specific context.  This context is not tied to a user *identity*, but rather to a specific *interaction* or *task*.

**Components:**

*   **Context Broker:** Central service component responsible for issuing and managing contexts.
*   **IoT Device Agent:** Software running on the IoT device, responsible for requesting and utilizing contexts.
*   **Ephemeral Context Identifier (ECI):** A randomly generated, short-lived identifier for a specific interaction.
*   **Probabilistic Authentication Tokens (PATs):**  Lightweight tokens generated based on device characteristics and environmental factors. These are *not* cryptographic keys, but rather data points used in a scoring system.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Device Request:** The IoT device initiates a request for a context to perform a specific task (e.g., “unlock door”, “read sensor data”). This request includes basic device information (type, model, location - approximate) and environmental data (temperature, humidity, ambient light).
2.  **Context Generation:** The Context Broker generates a unique ECI.  It also calculates a PAT score based on the received device and environmental data.  This score is a probabilistic assessment of the request's legitimacy (e.g., is a door unlocking request coming from a valid location at a reasonable time?).
3.  **Context Provisioning:** The Context Broker sends the ECI and PAT score to the IoT device.  The PAT score is a floating point number.
4.  **Task Execution:** The IoT device uses the ECI in subsequent communication with a resource (e.g., a door lock server, a data ingestion pipeline). The resource validates the ECI against the Context Broker.
5.  **Resource Validation:** The resource, *before* granting access or processing data, re-requests a current PAT score from the Context Broker for that specific device. It compares the *current* PAT score to the score originally received by the device. A significant difference indicates potential tampering or a compromised device.  The acceptable difference is configurable.
6.  **Context Expiration:** ECIs have a short Time To Live (TTL), automatically expiring after a predefined period (e.g., 60 seconds).

**Pseudocode (IoT Device Agent - Requesting Context):**

```
function requestContext(task):
  deviceId = getDeviceId()
  deviceInfo = getDeviceInfo()
  environmentalData = getEnvironmentalData()

  requestData = {
    deviceId: deviceId,
    task: task,
    deviceInfo: deviceInfo,
    environmentalData: environmentalData
  }

  response = sendRequestToContextBroker(requestData)

  if response.success:
    eci = response.eci
    patScore = response.patScore
    return eci, patScore
  else:
    logError("Context request failed")
    return null, null
```

**Pseudocode (Resource - Validating Context):**

```
function validateContext(eci, deviceId):
  patScore = getPatScoreFromContextBroker(eci, deviceId)
  originalPatScore = getOriginalPatScore(eci) //Stored when context was initially received.

  if patScore == null:
    logError("PAT score retrieval failed.")
    return false

  scoreDifference = abs(patScore - originalPatScore)

  if scoreDifference > acceptableDifferenceThreshold:
    logWarning("Potential context compromise detected.")
    return false

  return true
```

**Innovation:** This system minimizes the exposure of persistent user identifiers to potentially vulnerable IoT devices.  The probabilistic authentication adds a layer of security *without* requiring complex cryptographic operations on resource-constrained devices.  The constant re-evaluation of the PAT score provides dynamic security.  This approach is well-suited for scenarios with a high density of low-power IoT devices.
