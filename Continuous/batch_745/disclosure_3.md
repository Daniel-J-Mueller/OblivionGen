## Predictive Anomaly Detection via Multi-Sensor Fusion & Generative Modeling

**System Overview:** This system expands upon the existing security video analysis by moving beyond reactive searching to *proactive* anomaly prediction. It leverages data from multiple sensor types – video, audio, environmental (temperature, humidity, air pressure), and potentially even RF signal analysis (detecting unusual wireless activity) – to build a generative model of “normal” site behavior. Deviations from this model, even subtle ones, are flagged *before* they manifest as clearly identifiable security breaches.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Sensor Data Ingestion & Synchronization:**
    *   Multi-sensor data streams are ingested in real-time.
    *   Timestamp synchronization is critical. Implement Network Time Protocol (NTP) with redundancy, and consider hardware timestamping for precision.
    *   Data buffering handles temporary network outages or sensor failures.

2.  **Feature Extraction & Fusion:**
    *   **Video:** Utilize existing object detection and tracking from the base patent. *Add* pose estimation (detecting unusual body positions), facial expression analysis, and crowd density estimation.
    *   **Audio:** Analyze ambient sound for anomalies (gunshots, breaking glass, shouting). Use source localization to pinpoint the origin of sounds.
    *   **Environmental:** Monitor temperature fluctuations, humidity changes, and air pressure variations. Unexpected shifts can indicate forced entry or system compromise.
    *   **RF Signal:** Monitor wireless network traffic for unusual patterns (rogue access points, excessive bandwidth usage, unusual device connections).
    *   **Fusion:** Employ a weighted averaging or Kalman filtering approach to combine the features from different sensors. The weights are dynamically adjusted based on sensor reliability and feature relevance.

3.  **Generative Model Training (Normal Behavior):**
    *   **Architecture:** Utilize a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). VAEs are preferred for their stability and ability to learn a latent representation of normal behavior.
    *   **Training Data:** Train the model on historical data representing “normal” site activity. This requires careful data labeling and cleaning.
    *   **Latent Space:** The latent space represents a compressed representation of normal behavior.  The system learns to reconstruct normal sensor data from this latent space.
    *   **Dynamic Updates:** The model is continuously retrained with new data to adapt to changing environmental conditions and user behavior.

4.  **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   **Reconstruction Error:**  When new sensor data is received, it is encoded into the latent space and then reconstructed. The reconstruction error (difference between the original and reconstructed data) is calculated.
    *   **Thresholding:** If the reconstruction error exceeds a predefined threshold, an anomaly is flagged. The threshold is dynamically adjusted based on historical data and environmental conditions.
    *   **Anomaly Classification:** Utilize a separate machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest) to classify the type of anomaly based on the features contributing to the high reconstruction error.  (e.g., “Suspicious Person,” “Possible Intrusion,” “Environmental Change”).

5.  **Predictive Alerting:**
    *   **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze the sequence of anomalies to predict potential security breaches. (e.g., a “Suspicious Person” followed by “Possible Intrusion”).
    *   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each anomaly based on its severity, probability, and potential impact.
    *   **Proactive Response:** Trigger automated responses based on the risk score (e.g., send an alert to security personnel, lock doors, activate cameras).



**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(sensorData):
    encodedData = encode(sensorData, VAE)
    reconstructedData = decode(encodedData, VAE)
    reconstructionError = calculateError(sensorData, reconstructedData)

    if reconstructionError > threshold:
        anomalyType = classifyAnomaly(reconstructionError, sensorData)
        alertSecurity(anomalyType, sensorData)
        return True  # Anomaly detected
    else:
        return False  # No anomaly
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance server with GPUs for machine learning.
*   Multiple sensors (cameras, microphones, environmental sensors, RF signal analyzers).
*   Secure network infrastructure.
*   Data storage for historical sensor data.

**Future Enhancements:**

*   Federated learning to train the model on data from multiple sites without sharing raw data.
*   Explainable AI (XAI) to provide insights into the reasons behind anomaly detections.
*   Integration with other security systems (e.g., access control, alarm systems).
