## Developer "Influence Maps" & Predictive Issue Assignment

**Concept:** Extend the system to not just identify *who* is associated with issues, but to model the *influence* of developers on different code areas, and predict potential future issue ownership based on those influence maps. This moves beyond reactive issue assignment to proactive risk assessment.

**Specs:**

**1. Influence Map Generation Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Version control history (commits, authorship, code ownership).
    *   Code review data (reviewer/author relationships, comments, approval/rejection).
    *   Issue tracking data (assignee, reporter, resolution, time to resolution).
    *   Static analysis tool output (severity, location, type of issue).
    *   Dynamic analysis tool output (performance bottlenecks, error rates, execution paths).
*   **Algorithm:** Bayesian Network or Graph Neural Network (GNN).  The network nodes represent code modules (files, classes, functions).  Edges represent relationships derived from the data sources. Edge weights represent the strength of the relationship (e.g., frequency of commits, number of code reviews).
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Direct Influence:**  Percentage of lines of code directly authored by a developer in a module.
    *   **Review Influence:** Percentage of lines of code reviewed by a developer in a module.
    *   **Issue History Influence:**  Frequency with which a developer has been assigned/resolved issues in a module.
    *   **Combined Influence Score:** Weighted sum of the above metrics. Weights are configurable.

**2. Predictive Issue Assignment Module:**

*   **Input:** New issue reported by analysis tool (severity, location, type).  Current influence maps.
*   **Algorithm:**  
    1.  Identify the code module(s) affected by the issue.
    2.  Query the influence maps to determine the top N developers with the highest combined influence score for those modules.
    3.  Rank developers based on a combination of influence score and historical issue resolution performance (time to resolution, severity of resolved issues).
    4.  Suggest the top-ranked developer as the potential assignee for the issue.
    5.  Include a confidence score indicating the likelihood that the suggested developer is the correct assignee.
*   **Output:**  List of suggested assignees with confidence scores.

**3. User Interface Integration:**

*   **Dashboard:** Visualize influence maps for different code modules.  Allow users to filter developers and adjust influence weights.
*   **Issue Assignment Panel:** Display suggested assignees with confidence scores when a new issue is reported.  Allow users to override the suggestion.
*   **Developer Profile:** Show a developer's influence map and historical issue resolution performance.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Assignment):**

```
function predict_assignee(issue, influence_maps, historical_data):
  affected_modules = get_affected_modules(issue)
  candidate_developers = []
  for module in affected_modules:
    developers = influence_maps.get_developers_for_module(module)
    for developer in developers:
      score = developer.influence_score * historical_data.resolution_performance(developer)
      candidate_developers.append((developer, score))
  candidate_developers.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  top_developer = candidate_developers[0][0]
  confidence_score = candidate_developers[0][1]
  return top_developer, confidence_score
```

**Novelty:** While existing systems track issue ownership, this system *proactively* predicts ownership based on a dynamic influence map. This allows for earlier issue identification and potentially faster resolution by assigning issues to the most knowledgeable developers. The predictive capability is a significant differentiator. Furthermore, the combination of influence metrics, including code authorship, code review, and historical issue resolution, provides a more holistic view of developer expertise.
