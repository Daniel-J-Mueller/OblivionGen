## Adaptive Window Composition with Predictive Pre-Rendering

**Concept:** Extend the streamed window switching concept to allow for dynamic window *composition*—not just switching—with predictive pre-rendering of potential window arrangements based on user interaction patterns.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Interaction Monitor:** Tracks user input (mouse movement, keyboard presses, application focus) to build a predictive model of likely window arrangements. This model is stored locally at the client.
*   **Composition Engine:** A client-side engine that dynamically assembles window content streamed from the service into a unified display. It utilizes the predictive model from the Interaction Monitor.
*   **Pre-Render Queue:**  A prioritized queue of potential window arrangements. Arrangements are added to the queue based on predictions from the Interaction Monitor.
*   **Streaming Service Adaptation:** Service modifications to support streaming window content as independent layers/tiles, optimized for composition.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Stream:** The service streams initial window content (as defined in the patent) to the client.
2.  **Interaction Monitoring:** The Interaction Monitor begins tracking user activity. 
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Based on historical data and current activity, the Interaction Monitor generates probabilities for potential window arrangements (e.g., maximizing a specific window, tiling windows, placing windows side-by-side).
4.  **Pre-Rendering Initiation:**  The Composition Engine, guided by the Interaction Monitor's predictions, requests pre-rendered “snapshots” of likely window arrangements from the Streaming Service. These are added to the Pre-Render Queue.
5.  **Dynamic Composition:** As the user interacts, the Composition Engine dynamically assembles the display by:
    *   Prioritizing pre-rendered arrangements from the Pre-Render Queue.
    *   Streaming new or updated window layers/tiles from the service as needed.
    *   Employing smooth transitions between arrangements.
6.  **Queue Management:** The Pre-Render Queue is continuously updated based on user interaction. Arrangements that are no longer likely are removed. Arrangements that require updates are refreshed.

**III. Pseudocode (Composition Engine):**

```
function ComposeDisplay():
  arrangement = GetMostLikelyArrangement() // From Interaction Monitor
  
  if arrangement exists in PreRenderQueue:
    display = PreRenderQueue.Retrieve(arrangement)
    RenderDisplay(display)
  else:
    // Request new arrangement from Streaming Service
    request = CreateArrangementRequest(arrangement)
    response = StreamingService.Request(request)
    
    display = AssembleDisplayFromResponse(response)
    RenderDisplay(display)
    PreRenderQueue.Add(arrangement, display) // Cache for future use

function AssembleDisplayFromResponse(response):
  // Decode streamed layers/tiles
  // Compose layers according to arrangement data
  return composedDisplay

function GetMostLikelyArrangement():
    // Access Interaction Monitor's predictive model
    return bestPredictedArrangement
```

**IV. Streaming Service Modifications:**

*   The service should be capable of streaming window content as independent layers or tiles.
*   It should support requests for pre-rendered window arrangements, specifying the desired arrangement parameters.
*   It should implement a caching mechanism to reduce rendering load.

**V. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Arrangement Prediction:** Leverage machine learning to improve the accuracy of arrangement predictions.
*   **Context-Aware Arrangements:** Consider external factors (e.g., time of day, location) when predicting window arrangements.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define their own arrangement preferences and customize the prediction model.
*    **Holographic/AR Integration:** Extend the concept to holographic or augmented reality displays, allowing for dynamic window arrangements in 3D space.
