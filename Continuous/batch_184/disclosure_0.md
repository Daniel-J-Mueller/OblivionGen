## Adaptive Client-Side Feature Flagging via Alternate Server Redirection

**Concept:** Extend the alternate server redirection mechanism to dynamically enable or disable client-side features through feature flags delivered *via* the alternate server. Instead of simply redirecting to a completely different application, the primary server can route specific requests (or even the entire client session) through an "experimentation" server, which modifies client behavior on-the-fly.

**Specs:**

**1. Primary Server Modification:**

*   **New API Endpoint:** `/feature_request` – Accepts a feature key as input.
*   **Logic:** When a client requests a feature (via `/feature_request`), the primary server evaluates:
    *   Client version compatibility.
    *   User profile/segmentation (optional).
    *   A/B test configurations.
*   **Response:**  A redirection instruction including:
    *   `redirect_type`:  `"feature_proxy"`
    *   `proxy_server_address`:  URL of the experimentation server.
    *   `feature_key`: The requested feature key.
    *   `feature_state`: Boolean value representing the on/off state of the feature.
    *   `duration`:  Time (in seconds) for which the redirection should be active. This allows for temporary feature enabling/disabling.

**2. Client-Side Implementation:**

*   **Feature Request Function:**  `requestFeature(featureKey)` – Sends a request to `/feature_request` on the primary server.
*   **Redirection Handler:**  Intercepts redirection instructions with `redirect_type = "feature_proxy"`.
*   **Proxy Interceptor:** When a redirect is active:
    *   All subsequent requests for specific resources (determined by `feature_key` or a broader resource pattern) are proxied through the `proxy_server_address`.
    *   The client caches the `feature_state` for the duration specified in the response.
    *   After the `duration` expires, the client resumes direct communication with the primary server.

**3. Experimentation Server:**

*   **API:** Receives proxied requests from the client.
*   **Logic:** 
    *   Determines whether the feature should be enabled or disabled for the current user based on configured A/B tests or other criteria.
    *   Modifies the response data accordingly (e.g., injecting/removing UI elements, altering business logic).
    *   Returns the modified response to the client.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function requestFeature(featureKey) {
  // Send request to /feature_request
  response = primaryServer.get("/feature_request", { featureKey: featureKey });

  if (response.redirect_type === "feature_proxy") {
    activeRedirect = {
      proxyServerAddress: response.proxyServerAddress,
      featureKey: response.featureKey,
      featureState: response.featureState,
      duration: response.duration
    };
    startTimer(activeRedirect.duration, disableFeatureProxy);
  }
}

function sendRequest(url, data) {
  if (activeRedirect && activeRedirect.featureKey === getFeatureKeyFromURL(url)) {
    // Proxy the request to the experimentation server
    return experimentationServer.post(activeRedirect.proxyServerAddress, data);
  } else {
    // Send request directly to the primary server
    return primaryServer.post(url, data);
  }
}

function disableFeatureProxy() {
  activeRedirect = null;
}
```

**Innovation Rationale:** This system enables dynamic and targeted feature experimentation without requiring full client application updates. It allows for precise control over client behavior, facilitating rapid iteration and data-driven decision-making. The alternate server isn't just a replacement; it's a dynamic control plane for client functionality.
