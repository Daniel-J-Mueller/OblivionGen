**Variable Camber Hexawing System**

**Specification:** Modular hexagonal wing system with individually adjustable camber for each wing segment.

**Components:**

*   **Hexawing Structure:** Six identical wing segments forming a hexagonal ring. Constructed from lightweight carbon fiber composite. Each segment ~1.5m long.
*   **Camber Actuators:** Miniature linear actuators integrated within each wing segment. Range of motion: -15 to +15 degrees camber change. Driven by internal micro-controller.
*   **Control System:** Central flight controller integrating IMU, GPS, and barometer. Receives pilot input and environmental data. Processes data to determine optimal camber settings for each wing segment.
*   **Power Distribution:** Integrated power distribution network running along the hexawing structure. Supplies power to camber actuators and segment-mounted sensors.
*   **Segment Sensors:** Each wing segment equipped with airflow sensors (pitot tubes, hot-wire anemometers) and strain gauges. Data fed back to central controller for real-time camber adjustment.
*   **Motor Arms:** Six articulated motor arms connecting wing segments to central fuselage. Arms incorporate wiring for power and data transmission.

**Operation:**

1.  **VTOL Mode:** Camber actuators set to neutral position for balanced lift. Motor arms articulate to provide thrust vectoring for stable vertical takeoff and landing.  Flight controller prioritizes stability and control responsiveness.
2.  **Horizontal Flight Mode:** Flight controller analyzes airflow data from segment sensors to optimize camber for maximum lift and efficiency.
    *   **Turn Initiation:** Camber on outer wing segments increased, camber on inner wing segments decreased to induce roll and initiate turn.
    *   **Maneuvering:** Real-time camber adjustments on individual segments to actively control airflow and enhance agility.
    *   **Gust Mitigation:** Segment sensors detect turbulence, camber adjustments on affected segments to dampen oscillations and maintain stability.
3.  **Power Management:** Integrated power distribution network manages power delivery to actuators and sensors. Battery capacity monitoring and dynamic power allocation based on flight mode and performance requirements.

**Pseudocode (Camber Control Algorithm):**

```c++
// Data Structures
struct WingSegmentData {
  float airflowSpeed;
  float angleOfAttack;
  float strain;
  float camberAngle;
};

// Global Variables
WingSegmentData wingSegments[6];

// Function: Calculate Optimal Camber
float calculateOptimalCamber(int segmentIndex) {
  float airflowSpeed = wingSegments[segmentIndex].airflowSpeed;
  float angleOfAttack = wingSegments[segmentIndex].angleOfAttack;
  float strain = wingSegments[segmentIndex].strain;

  // Basic Camber Calculation (Example - more complex logic needed)
  float camber = 0.0;
  if (airflowSpeed > 20.0) {
    camber = 2.0 * angleOfAttack;
  }
  if (strain > 100.0) {
    camber -= 1.0; // Reduce camber if experiencing high stress
  }
  return constrain(camber, -15.0, 15.0); // Ensure camber is within range
}

// Main Control Loop
void controlLoop() {
  // Read sensor data from each wing segment
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    wingSegments[i].airflowSpeed = readAirflowSpeed(i);
    wingSegments[i].angleOfAttack = readAngleOfAttack(i);
    wingSegments[i].strain = readStrain(i);
  }

  // Calculate optimal camber for each segment
  for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    float optimalCamber = calculateOptimalCamber(i);
    setCamber(i, optimalCamber);
  }
}
```

**Materials:**

*   Carbon fiber composite (wing segments, motor arms)
*   Titanium alloy (actuator linkages)
*   High-density polymers (actuator housings)

**Future Considerations:**

*   Morphing wing surfaces (beyond camber control)
*   Integration of micro-turbines for distributed propulsion
*   AI-powered flight control algorithms for adaptive performance optimization.
