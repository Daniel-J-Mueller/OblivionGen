## Dynamic Schema Generation via Query Analysis

**Concept:** Leverage the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated within the patent to *automatically* generate data interchange schemas, instead of relying on pre-defined mappings or dictionaries. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability to varied and complex queries.

**Specification:**

**1. Query Intake & AST Generation:**

   *   Standard input: Raw database query (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).
   *   Process: Generate a full AST representing the query structure.  This is already a core component of the provided patent, so no change needed here.

**2. Schema Discovery Engine:**

   *   Input: AST from Step 1.
   *   Process:
        *   **Node Classification:**  Traverse the AST and classify each node based on its type (e.g., SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, aggregate function, literal value, variable name).
        *   **Dependency Analysis:**  For each node, identify its dependencies – what other nodes does it rely on?  (e.g., A `WHERE` clause depends on variables used in the condition, a `JOIN` depends on the joined tables).
        *   **Schema Element Creation:** Based on node type and dependencies:
            *   **Simple Literals/Variables:** Create a basic name-value pair in the schema (e.g., `"variable_name": "value"`).  Data type inference will happen in Step 3.
            *   **Operators/Functions:** Create a nested map representing the operator/function and its operands. (e.g., `">": {"left": "value1", "right": "value2"}`).
            *   **Complex Clauses (WHERE, JOIN):** Create hierarchical maps reflecting the clause structure.
            *   **Aggregations:** Map aggregate functions to specific schema elements indicating the aggregation type (e.g., `"aggregation": "COUNT", "field": "column_name"`).

**3. Data Type Inference & Schema Refinement:**

   *   Input: Initial schema generated in Step 2.
   *   Process:
        *   **Database Metadata Access:**  Query the database for metadata about tables and columns referenced in the query.
        *   **Type Mapping:**  Map database data types to equivalent representations in the data interchange format (or define a fallback strategy if a direct mapping doesn’t exist).
        *   **Schema Annotation:**  Add data type information to the schema elements. (e.g., `"variable_name": {"value": "value", "type": "STRING"}`).  If a type cannot be determined with certainty, use a generic type (e.g., "ANY").

**4. Schema Output & Query Translation:**

   *   Output: Dynamically generated schema in the data interchange format.
   *   Process: Translate the query using the dynamic schema.  The hierarchy of maps will reflect the query structure, and the type annotations will ensure data compatibility.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateDynamicSchema(query, databaseMetadata):
    ast = parseQuery(query)
    schema = {}
    
    function traverseAST(node):
        if node is a literal or variable:
            schema[node.name] = {"value": node.value, "type": inferDataType(node, databaseMetadata)}
        elif node is an operator:
            schema[node.name] = {
                "type": "OPERATOR",
                "operator": node.operatorType,
                "left": traverseAST(node.left),
                "right": traverseAST(node.right)
            }
        # Handle other node types (WHERE, JOIN, aggregates, etc.) similarly
        
        return schema
    
    dynamicSchema = traverseAST(ast.root)
    return dynamicSchema
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Adaptability:** Handles a wider range of queries without requiring manual schema definitions.
*   **Flexibility:**  Supports complex query structures and data types.
*   **Reduced Maintenance:**  Eliminates the need to update schemas when the database schema changes.
*   **Dynamic Optimization:**  The generated schema can be optimized based on the query structure and database metadata.
