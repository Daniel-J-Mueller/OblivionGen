## Adaptive Entropy Profiling for Dynamic Threat Detection

**Specification:** A system for continuously learning and adapting entropy thresholds based on code evolution and developer behavior. This expands on the idea of static or baseline entropy analysis to create a dynamic, self-learning security layer.

**Components:**

*   **Code Repository Monitor:** Tracks commits and changes within a code repository (Git, SVN, etc.).
*   **Entropy Analysis Engine:**  Calculates information entropy for code segments, similar to the original patent.
*   **Behavioral Analysis Module:** Tracks developer activity â€“ author, commit message, frequency of changes, time of day.
*   **Adaptive Threshold Engine:**  Adjusts entropy thresholds based on data from the Entropy Analysis Engine *and* the Behavioral Analysis Module.
*   **Alerting System:** Triggers alerts when entropy exceeds the *dynamically adjusted* threshold.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Allows security analysts to validate or reject alerts, providing training data for the Adaptive Threshold Engine.

**Operation:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** Initial entropy analysis is performed on the existing codebase to establish a baseline, as in the original patent.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The Code Repository Monitor tracks all code changes.
3.  **Entropy Calculation:** For each code change, the Entropy Analysis Engine calculates the entropy of the modified code segments.
4.  **Behavioral Context:** The Behavioral Analysis Module extracts data about the developer who made the change, the commit message, etc.
5.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The Adaptive Threshold Engine uses a weighted algorithm to adjust the entropy threshold. Factors include:
    *   **Entropy Deviation:**  The difference between the current entropy and the baseline entropy.
    *   **Developer Reputation:** Developers with a history of clean code may have a higher tolerance threshold.
    *   **Commit Message Analysis:**  Commit messages containing keywords like "security," "credential," or "encryption" trigger a more conservative threshold.
    *   **Change Frequency:**  Rapid, frequent changes in a sensitive area lower the threshold.
    *   **Time of Day:** Changes made outside of normal working hours raise the threshold.
6.  **Alerting:** If the calculated entropy exceeds the dynamic threshold, an alert is triggered.
7.  **Feedback & Learning:** Security analysts review alerts and provide feedback (true positive/false positive). This feedback is used to refine the weighting algorithm in the Adaptive Threshold Engine.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Threshold Engine):**

```
function calculateDynamicThreshold(baselineEntropy, entropyDeviation, developerReputation, commitMessageScore, changeFrequency, timeOfDay) {

  // Weighting factors (tunable parameters)
  weightBaseline = 0.5;
  weightDeviation = 0.2;
  weightReputation = 0.1;
  weightMessage = 0.1;
  weightFrequency = 0.05;
  weightTime = 0.05;

  // Normalize inputs (scale to 0-1 range)
  normalizedDeviation = clamp(entropyDeviation / baselineEntropy, 0, 1);
  normalizedReputation = clamp(developerReputation, 0, 1);
  normalizedMessage = commitMessageScore; //Assume score is already 0-1
  normalizedFrequency = clamp(changeFrequency, 0, 1);
  normalizedTime = timeOfDay; //Assume time is already 0-1

  // Calculate weighted sum
  dynamicThreshold = (weightBaseline * baselineEntropy) +
                     (weightDeviation * normalizedDeviation * baselineEntropy) +
                     (weightReputation * normalizedReputation * baselineEntropy) +
                     (weightMessage * normalizedMessage * baselineEntropy) +
                     (weightFrequency * normalizedFrequency * baselineEntropy) +
                     (weightTime * normalizedTime * baselineEntropy);

  return dynamicThreshold;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Proactive Threat Detection:** Identify potential security risks *before* they are exploited.
*   **Insider Threat Mitigation:** Detect anomalous behavior by developers.
*   **Automated Code Review:**  Highlight suspicious code segments for manual review.
*   **DevSecOps Integration:**  Integrate security analysis into the CI/CD pipeline.
