## Satellite Swarm Drag Mapping & Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Utilize a distributed network of small satellites (a ‘swarm’) to create a highly granular, real-time map of atmospheric drag, and leverage this map to significantly improve orbit determination (OD) accuracy, especially for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. This expands on the existing patent’s model updating by moving *beyond* reliance on single-satellite corrections and embracing collective sensing.

**Specifications:**

**1. Swarm Composition:**

*   **Satellite Type:** CubeSat-class (3U-6U) - Cost-effective, mass-producible.
*   **Number of Satellites:** Initially 24, scalable to 100+.
*   **Orbit:** Distributed LEO (altitude range 400-600km), with a near-polar inclination to maximize coverage. Each satellite will have slight altitude and orbital plane variations to create spatial diversity.
*   **Payload:**
    *   **Precise GPS Receiver:** For accurate position and velocity determination.
    *   **Cold Gas Micro-Thruster System:** For controlled drag compensation and station keeping.  Thrusters must be capable of very fine adjustments.
    *   **Accelerometer Suite:** Tri-axis accelerometers to directly measure drag forces.
    *   **Communications Module:** High bandwidth for data transmission to ground stations/cloud.

**2. Data Acquisition and Processing:**

*   **Drag Measurement:** Each satellite will continuously measure acceleration and correlate changes to atmospheric drag. GPS data will be used to filter out orbital maneuvering and external forces.
*   **Data Transmission:** Satellites will transmit raw acceleration data, GPS positions, and timestamped drag estimates to a central ground station/cloud server.
*   **Data Fusion:**  A cloud-based server will fuse data from all satellites.  This includes:
    *   **Kalman Filtering:** Employ a multi-variate Kalman filter to estimate atmospheric drag as a function of altitude, latitude, longitude, and time.
    *   **Spatial Interpolation:** Utilize kriging or other spatial interpolation techniques to create a continuous 3D map of atmospheric drag. This map will be updated in near real-time (e.g., every 5-10 minutes).

**3. Orbit Determination Integration:**

*   **OD Service API:** The swarm-derived drag map will be provided to the existing OD service via an API.
*   **Drag Model Enhancement:**  The OD service will incorporate the swarm-derived drag map as a primary input to its atmospheric drag model.  This replaces/enhances the existing model updating with a direct, high-resolution drag estimate.
*   **Predictive Drag Modeling:**  Utilize machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to predict future drag conditions based on historical swarm data and space weather forecasts.  This will allow for proactive OD corrections.

**4.  System Architecture**

*   **Ground Segment:** Ground stations for satellite control and data download.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure:**
    *   Data Storage: Scalable cloud storage for raw and processed data.
    *   Processing Engine: High-performance computing cluster for data fusion, drag map generation, and OD integration.
    *   API Gateway: Secure API for accessing swarm data and drag maps.
*   **Satellite Network:** Inter-satellite links (optional) to facilitate data relay and improve coverage.

**Pseudocode (Drag Map Generation):**

```
// Input: Raw acceleration data, GPS positions, timestamps from all satellites
// Output: 3D drag map

// 1. Data Filtering and Cleaning:
//    - Remove outliers and erroneous data points.
//    - Correct for satellite attitude and instrument bias.

// 2. Drag Estimation:
//    - Calculate drag acceleration for each satellite using Newton's second law.
//    - Correlate drag acceleration with GPS position and timestamp.

// 3. Spatial Interpolation:
//    - Apply kriging or other spatial interpolation technique to generate a continuous 3D drag map.
//    - Use satellite positions as interpolation points.

// 4. Temporal Averaging:
//    - Average drag values over a specified time window to reduce noise.

// 5. Output: 3D drag map (latitude, longitude, altitude, drag value)
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond *correcting* OD based on single satellite data to *proactively predicting* drag conditions using a distributed sensor network.  Provides a significantly more accurate and granular atmospheric drag model than currently possible.
