## Adaptive Log Granularity via Predictive Analysis

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust logging granularity *per thread* based on predicted code execution paths and associated error probabilities.

**Core Concept:**  Rather than a static global declaration list for logging, the system learns from thread behavior, predicts likely execution paths, and adjusts logging levels *during runtime* to focus on potentially problematic areas. This reduces logging overhead during normal operation while increasing detail where errors are anticipated.

**Components:**

1.  **Execution Path Profiler:** Monitors each thread's execution, building a statistical model of common execution paths, function call frequencies, and branching probabilities.  Utilizes techniques like Markov chains or decision trees to represent execution flow.

2.  **Error Probability Estimator:** Integrates with static analysis tools and runtime error tracking. Assigns error probabilities to code blocks based on historical data, code complexity, and identified vulnerabilities.  Considers code coverage data.

3.  **Dynamic Logging Configuration Manager:**  Responsible for adjusting logging levels *per thread*. Receives input from the Execution Path Profiler and Error Probability Estimator. Implements a cost/benefit analysis to determine the optimal logging level for each code block.

4.  **Logging Abstraction Layer:**  Provides a standardized interface for threads to emit log events.  Allows the Dynamic Logging Configuration Manager to intercept and filter log events based on the current configuration.



**Pseudocode – Dynamic Logging Configuration Manager:**

```
function adjustLoggingLevel(threadID, codeBlockAddress, executionPathProbability, errorProbability):
    // Cost/Benefit Analysis
    loggingCost = calculateLoggingCost(codeBlockAddress)  // Overhead of logging this block
    loggingBenefit = calculateLoggingBenefit(executionPathProbability, errorProbability) // Value of logging this block 

    if loggingBenefit > loggingCost:
        setLoggingLevel(threadID, codeBlockAddress, "DEBUG") // Detailed logging
    else:
        setLoggingLevel(threadID, codeBlockAddress, "INFO")  // Minimal logging

function calculateLoggingCost(codeBlockAddress):
    // Estimate cost based on code complexity, logging overhead, etc.
    // Return a numerical cost value.
    return cost

function calculateLoggingBenefit(executionPathProbability, errorProbability):
    // Combine path probability and error probability to estimate benefit.
    // Benefit = executionPathProbability * errorProbability
    // Return a numerical benefit value.
    return benefit

function setLoggingLevel(threadID, codeBlockAddress, logLevel):
    // Update the thread’s logging configuration
    // Potentially adjust filters or log output formats
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Thread Logging Configuration:** A per-thread data structure storing logging levels for individual code blocks.  Can be implemented as a hash map or tree.
*   **Execution Path Model:**  A statistical representation of the thread’s execution paths, potentially using Markov chains or decision trees.
*   **Error Probability Map:** A map associating code blocks with their estimated error probabilities.

**Integration with Existing System:**

The system can be integrated with the existing logging framework by wrapping the logging functions and intercepting log events before they are written to the output buffers. The Dynamic Logging Configuration Manager can then filter or modify log events based on the thread’s configuration.

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond static logging configurations and introduces dynamic, per-thread logging adjustments based on predicted execution paths and error probabilities.  It allows for reduced logging overhead during normal operation and increased detail where errors are anticipated, offering a more efficient and adaptive logging solution.
