## Dynamic Task Decomposition & Skill-Based Auctioning

**Concept:** Expand the locale-specific task variant concept to *dynamic task decomposition* coupled with a skill-based auctioning system. Instead of pre-defined variants, tasks are broken down into micro-tasks based on locale *and* required skill sets, which are then auctioned to performers in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Task Decomposition Engine:**
    *   Input: Initial task description, target locales, and associated data (images, text, etc.).
    *   Process: AI-driven analysis of task, identifying modular sub-tasks. Sub-tasks are tagged with skill requirements (e.g., "image labeling," "translation – Spanish," “sentiment analysis – Brazilian Portuguese”, “geographic feature identification”). Locale data automatically adjusts sub-task specifics (e.g., image labeling focusing on local architecture, translation requests targeted to specific dialects).
    *   Output: A dynamic task graph of micro-tasks, each with associated skill tags, locale specifics, estimated completion time, and a proposed reward range.
*   **Skill & Availability Database:**
    *   Maintains a detailed profile of each task performer, including:
        *   Self-reported skills (verified via micro-assessments).
        *   Locale proficiency (native language, cultural understanding, geographic expertise – validated via tests and performance history).
        *   Real-time availability.
        *   Performance rating (quality, speed, reliability).
    *   Database is continuously updated based on performer actions and feedback.
*   **Real-time Auction System:**
    *   When a decomposed task is ready, the system identifies eligible performers based on skill and locale matches.
    *   Eligible performers receive task notifications (push, email, etc.).
    *   Performers can bid on individual micro-tasks within the larger task, specifying their price and estimated completion time.
    *   The system automatically selects the best bid based on price, estimated time, and performer rating.
    *   Auctioning occurs continuously – tasks can be dynamically re-auctioned if initial bids are unsatisfactory or performers fail to deliver.
*   **Quality Control & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Each micro-task output is subject to automated quality checks (e.g., data validation, image analysis).
    *   Human review is triggered for tasks failing automated checks or flagged by other performers.
    *   Performer ratings are updated based on quality control results and feedback from task requesters and other performers.
*   **Reward Distribution System:**
    *   Automated payment to performers upon successful completion and quality approval of micro-tasks.
    *   Bonus rewards for exceptional performance or rapid completion.
    *   Transparent reward tracking and reporting.

**Pseudocode (Auction Process):**

```
FUNCTION AuctionTask(task, locale):
  // 1. Decompose Task
  microTasks = Decompose(task, locale)

  // 2. Identify Eligible Performers
  eligiblePerformers = FindPerformers(microTasks)

  // 3. Auction Each MicroTask
  FOR EACH microTask IN microTasks:
    bids = CollectBids(microTask, eligiblePerformers)
    bestBid = SelectBestBid(bids)
    AssignTask(microTask, bestBid.performer)
  END FOR

  // 4. Monitor and Reward
  MonitorTaskCompletion(microTasks)
  DistributeRewards(microTasks)
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Assisted Task Decomposition:**  Use AI to automatically suggest optimal task decomposition strategies.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust reward ranges based on real-time supply and demand for specific skills.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce game mechanics (badges, leaderboards, etc.) to incentivize performers.
*   **Reputation System:** Implement a robust reputation system to reward high-quality performers and penalize poor performance.
*   **Skill Gap Identification:** Analyze task requests and performer skills to identify skill gaps and recommend training opportunities.
