## Modular Camera System with Bio-Integrated Sensors

**Concept:** A camera system not defined by a fixed form factor, but by a core processing unit and a series of magnetically attaching, swappable sensor modules. These modules extend beyond traditional visible light capture to include bio-signal sensors – heart rate, skin conductivity, even rudimentary EEG – integrated *directly* into the camera body where a grip would normally be. The intent is to create a device that simultaneously captures external reality *and* internal biometric data, linking the two in a unified data stream.

**Core Processing Unit Specs:**

*   **Dimensions:** 80mm x 50mm x 25mm (roughly smartphone sized, but flat)
*   **Materials:** Magnesium alloy chassis, Gorilla Glass 7 screen (1.5” diagonal, OLED, touch sensitive)
*   **Processor:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (or equivalent)
*   **Memory:** 16GB RAM, 512GB Storage
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C (data/charging)
*   **Power:** 4000mAh battery (replaceable via bottom access panel)
*   **Mounting:** Strong magnetic array covering all faces of the unit.  Each face has a different magnetic polarity to ensure proper orientation of modules.

**Sensor Module Specs (examples):**

*   **Visible Light Module:**
    *   Sensor: 50MP Sony IMX766 (or equivalent)
    *   Lens: 24mm f/1.8 fixed focal length, image stabilization
    *   Dimensions: 60mm x 40mm x 20mm
    *   Connectivity: Magnetic attachment + data transfer via integrated connectors.
*   **Thermal Module:**
    *   Sensor: FLIR Lepton 3.5 (or equivalent)
    *   Resolution: 160 x 120
    *   Dimensions: 50mm x 30mm x 15mm
*   **Bio-Integrated Sensor Module (Grip Module):**
    *   Form Factor: Ergonomic grip that attaches to the core processing unit.
    *   Sensors:
        *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) – Heart rate, HRV.  Integrated into contact points for the hand.
        *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) – Skin conductivity, stress levels. Integrated into contact points.
        *   Single-Lead EEG – Basic brainwave activity (alpha, beta, theta).  Small, dry electrodes positioned on the palm-facing surface.
    *   Power: Draws power from the core processing unit.
    *   Data Transfer: Real-time data stream to the core processing unit via magnetic connectors.
    *   Material: Biocompatible polymer with embedded sensors. Textured for grip.

**Software/Data Processing:**

*   **Real-time Data Fusion:** Software algorithms to correlate visual data with biometric data.  For example, identify moments of heightened stress as reflected in GSR and correlate that with visual events in the captured video.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Use machine learning models to identify patterns in the combined data stream. Applications:
    *   Emotion recognition
    *   Cognitive load assessment
    *   Biometric-triggered recording
*   **Data Visualization:** A user interface to visualize the combined data streams in real-time or post-processing.  Overlay biometric data onto the captured video or images.
*   **SDK:** A Software Development Kit to allow third-party developers to create applications that leverage the combined data streams.

**Operational Modes:**

*   **Standard Photography/Videography:**  Use the visible light module for traditional image/video capture.
*   **Thermal Imaging:** Switch to the thermal module for thermal imagery.
*   **Bio-Feedback Mode:**  Capture video/images *while* simultaneously monitoring biometric data. Use the biometric data to adjust camera settings (e.g., stabilization, focus) or to trigger recording events.
*   **Data Logging Mode:**  Focus solely on capturing biometric data for research or personal monitoring.
