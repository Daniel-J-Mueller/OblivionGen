## Dynamic Workflow Simulation & Predictive Branching

**Concept:** Extend the workflow discovery system to not just *identify* workflows, but to *simulate* them, predict potential branches, and proactively offer assistance or automation at predicted decision points.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Augmentation - Simulated User Actions:**

*   **Module:** `WorkflowSimulator`
*   **Input:** Existing workflow graph (from patent), historical user action data, contextual data (user role, time of day, system load).
*   **Process:** 
    *   `generate_simulated_actions(workflow_graph, historical_data, context)`:  Based on the workflow graph and historical data, generate a probabilistic distribution of potential next actions at each vertex.  This leverages Bayesian Networks or Markov Chains to model the action sequence.  Include 'noise' representing minor deviations in user behavior.
    *   `simulate_workflow(workflow_graph, num_simulations)`: Run multiple simulations of the workflow, generating a trace of user actions for each simulation. This generates a dataset of *potential* workflow executions, beyond those already observed.
*   **Output:** Enhanced workflow graph incorporating simulated action probabilities, dataset of simulated workflow executions.

**2. Predictive Branching & Assistance:**

*   **Module:** `BranchPredictor`
*   **Input:** Enhanced workflow graph (from `WorkflowSimulator`), current user action, current context.
*   **Process:**
    *   `predict_next_branches(workflow_graph, current_action, context)`: Analyze the workflow graph, considering the current action and context. Identify likely branching points (vertices with multiple outgoing arcs).  Calculate probabilities for each branch based on simulated data and historical data.
    *   `proactive_assistance(predicted_branches, context)`: Based on the predicted branches and context, proactively offer assistance to the user. This could include:
        *   Presenting relevant documentation or help articles.
        *   Auto-filling forms or data fields.
        *   Suggesting the next action in the workflow.
        *   Automating repetitive tasks.  (e.g. automatically opening a specific application or file).
*   **Output:** Ranked list of predicted branches, assistance recommendations.

**3.  Dynamic Workflow Graph Update:**

*   **Module:** `WorkflowUpdater`
*   **Input:** Current workflow execution data, predicted branch outcomes, user feedback.
*   **Process:**
    *   `update_graph(workflow_graph, execution_data, feedback)`:  Continuously update the workflow graph based on actual user behavior and feedback.  Adjust arc probabilities to reflect the accuracy of predictions. Add new branches or vertices as needed.
*   **Output:** Updated workflow graph.

**Pseudocode (BranchPredictor.predict\_next\_branches):**

```
function predict_next_branches(workflow_graph, current_action, context):
  current_vertex = find_vertex(workflow_graph, current_action)
  possible_branches = get_outgoing_arcs(workflow_graph, current_vertex)

  for branch in possible_branches:
    destination_vertex = branch.destination
    branch.probability = calculate_branch_probability(workflow_graph, branch, context)

  sorted_branches = sort_branches_by_probability(branches, descending=True)
  return sorted_branches
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **User Modeling:** Incorporate user-specific models to personalize predictions and assistance.
*   **A/B Testing:** Use A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of different assistance strategies.
*   **Explainability:** Provide explanations for predictions to build user trust. (e.g. “We recommend this action because 80% of users in your role took this step after this action.”)
*   **API Integration:** Expose an API for third-party applications to access workflow predictions and assistance features.
