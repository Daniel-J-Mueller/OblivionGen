## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning & Personalized Soundscapes

**Concept:** Expand the proximity detection into a dynamic acoustic zoning system combined with personalized soundscapes to *encourage* spatial separation *and* enhance individual experience. Instead of *just* alerting people to move apart, proactively reshape the acoustic environment to make separation more desirable.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array (Existing):** Leverage the existing multi-microphone setup.
*   **Directional Speakers:** Integrate an array of small, directional speakers within the room (e.g., ceiling-mounted, wall-mounted, integrated into furniture). Resolution: Minimum 1 speaker per 50 sq ft.
*   **IR Proximity Sensors:** Add short-range infrared proximity sensors (passive) to complement the audio analysis. Purpose: Validate audio-derived proximity data and handle occlusions.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge processing unit within the room to handle real-time audio/IR analysis and soundscape rendering.
*   **User Profiles:** System supports user profiles (via app/account) storing individual soundscape preferences (music genres, ambient sounds, preferred volume levels).

**2. Software/Algorithm:**

*   **Enhanced Proximity Detection:** Existing audio and IR data fusion algorithm. Refinement: Incorporate machine learning to improve accuracy in identifying individual sound sources in crowded environments.
*   **Acoustic Zoning Algorithm:**
    *   Based on detected proximity, dynamically create “acoustic zones” around each person.
    *   Zone Radius: Proportional to the “desired separation distance” (configurable per user profile).
    *   Zone Overlap Handling: Algorithm detects and resolves overlapping zones.
*   **Soundscape Rendering Engine:**
    *   Generative audio engine capable of creating/mixing ambient sounds and music.
    *   Soundscape Personalization: Renders a personalized soundscape *within* each acoustic zone, based on the user’s profile.
    *   Directional Audio Delivery: Utilizes directional speakers to deliver the personalized soundscape to the intended zone only.
*   **‘Auditory Push’ Feature:**
    *   If proximity falls below the threshold, *subtly* decrease the volume of the soundscape within the overlapping zones, creating a mild “auditory push” effect.  The goal is not to *annoy*, but to gently encourage separation.
    *   Volume reduction: Maximum 2-3 dB.
    *   Alternative: introduce a subtly dissonant tone within the overlapping zone.
*   **User Override:** Allow users to temporarily disable or modify the auditory push effect via app.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop

FOR each frame:

    // 1. Data Acquisition
    audioData = getAudioData()
    irData = getIRData()

    // 2. Proximity Detection (Enhanced)
    proximityMap = detectProximity(audioData, irData) // Returns a map of distances between people

    // 3. Acoustic Zoning
    zones = createAcousticZones(proximityMap) // Algorithm determines zone boundaries and overlaps

    // 4. Soundscape Rendering
    FOR each zone:
        userProfile = getAssociatedUserProfile(zone)
        soundscape = generatePersonalizedSoundscape(userProfile)
        renderSoundscape(soundscape, zone)

    // 5. Auditory Push (if necessary)
    IF zoneOverlapDetected(zones):
        FOR each overlapping zone pair:
            adjustVolume(overlappingZonePair, -2dB) // Subtly reduce volume in overlapping areas
            OR
            introduceDissonance(overlappingZonePair, subtleTone)
```

**4. Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Integration with Lighting:** Coordinate changes in lighting intensity/color with soundscape adjustments.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate data from other sensors (e.g., room occupancy, time of day) to further personalize the acoustic environment.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce a playful element by rewarding users for maintaining sufficient separation.
*   **Biometric Feedback:** Incorporate biometric sensors (e.g., heart rate) to personalize soundscapes based on user emotional state.
