## Dynamic Authentication Surface

**Concept:** Extend the authentication method beyond a single image/QR code to a dynamically changing, multi-layered visual surface displayed on a primary device (e.g., a computer screen). This surface isn't just for key extraction, but actively participates in the authentication *process* itself, introducing timing and spatial elements.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Surface Generation:** A server-side module generates a complex visual surface composed of multiple layers. These layers could include:
    *   Static background image.
    *   Dynamic patterns (e.g., shifting colors, moving shapes).
    *   Embedded QR codes/data matrices, but *not* the primary authentication element.
    *   Subtle, time-dependent visual changes (e.g., slight shifts in color hue every second).
    *   A 'challenge region' – a specific area within the surface that requires user interaction.

2.  **Client-Side Rendering:** The primary device displays this surface. The client application captures a video stream of the surface, *including* timestamps for each frame.

3.  **Key Extraction via Spatial Analysis:**  The authentication device (e.g., a phone) doesn’t just scan for a QR code. It analyzes the *entire* video stream. 
    *   A computer vision algorithm identifies key features within the dynamic surface (e.g., specific color gradients, the edges of moving shapes).
    *   The algorithm tracks these features over time, creating a "motion fingerprint" unique to that specific instance of the surface.
    *   This motion fingerprint (a sequence of spatial data and timestamps) *is* the key.

4.  **Seed Transmission & Validation:**
    *   The authentication device transmits the motion fingerprint to the server.
    *   The server compares the received fingerprint to an expected fingerprint generated at the time the surface was created.
    *   If the fingerprints match (within a tolerance), the server transmits an encrypted seed.

5.  **User Interaction Challenge:**
    *   The user is prompted to interact with the ‘challenge region’ on the surface within a specific timeframe (e.g., drag a shape to a target).
    *   The client application captures the user's interaction (e.g., finger trajectory) and includes it in the authentication request.
    *   This interaction data adds another layer of security.

6.  **One-Time Passcode Generation:** The seed, combined with the user's interaction data and potentially location data, is used to generate the one-time passcode.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Authentication Device):**

```
function captureAuthenticationData() {
    startVideoCapture(surfaceDisplay)
    recordVideo(duration: 5 seconds)
    extractMotionFingerprint(videoData)
    transmitMotionFingerprintToServer()
    // Receive seed from server
    captureUserInteraction(challengeRegion)
    generatePasscode(seed, userInteraction, locationData)
    transmitPasscodeToServer()
}

function extractMotionFingerprint(videoData) {
    // Computer vision algorithm to track key features
    // Returns a sequence of spatial data and timestamps
}

function generatePasscode(seed, userInteraction, locationData) {
    // Algorithm to combine seed, user interaction, and location data
    // Returns a one-time passcode
}
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   **Increased Security:** The dynamic surface and motion fingerprint make it far more difficult to spoof or replay attacks.
*   **Usability:** A visually engaging surface could improve the user experience.
*   **Resistance to Screen Capture:** The time-dependent nature of the surface makes it harder to authenticate using static screen captures.
