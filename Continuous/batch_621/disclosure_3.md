## Adaptive Predictive Rendering with Generative Infill

**Concept:** Extend the presented quality prediction to not just *select* an existing quality level, but to *dynamically render* a quality level *between* existing levels, or even generate entirely new frames/segments with improved detail, leveraging generative AI. This addresses scenarios where even the highest available quality isn’t “good enough” for a specific device/content combination, or where bandwidth is limited and upscaling is preferable to buffering.

**Specs:**

**1. Generative Model Integration:**

*   **Model Type:** A lightweight, real-time generative AI model (e.g., a diffusion model or GAN) trained on high-resolution content.  Multiple models may be maintained, each optimized for specific content types (e.g., animation, live action, sports).
*   **Integration Point:** Inserted between the decoding stage and the display pipeline.  Receives decoded frames/segments and a “rendering target quality” value.
*   **Latency Budget:**  Maximum permissible processing time: 33ms per frame/segment.  Hardware acceleration (GPU/NPU) is *required*.

**2.  Rendering Target Quality Determination:**

*   **Input Parameters:**
    *   Presented Quality Scores (from existing patent).
    *   Device Capabilities (screen resolution, pixel density, processing power).
    *   Content Analysis (scene complexity, motion vectors, detail levels).
    *   Network Conditions (bandwidth, latency, jitter).
    *   User Preferences (if available – e.g., “sharpen details”).
*   **Algorithm:** A weighted sum of these factors, dynamically adjusted via a reinforcement learning model.  The output is a target quality value representing the *desired* level of detail, which may exceed the highest available encoded level.
*   **Quality Metric:**  Perceptual quality metric (e.g., Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity - LPIPS) used to evaluate the effectiveness of rendering.

**3.  Dynamic Rendering Pipeline:**

*   **Upscaling:** If the target quality exceeds the original resolution, a Super-Resolution (SR) model is applied.  SR model selected based on content type.
*   **Detail Enhancement:**  For specific content areas (e.g., faces, textures), a detail enhancement module is activated.  This module uses generative in-fill to add finer details to existing pixels.
*   **Frame Generation (Trick Play):** During fast-forward or rewind, generative models create entirely new intermediate frames to smooth the playback.
*   **In-fill parameters:** A confidence score for each pixel will be calculated, allowing the system to prioritize generating new pixels where it is most needed.
*   **Rendering Modes:**
    *   **Full Generation:** Generates the entire frame from a lower-resolution input. (Highest quality, highest latency).
    *   **Partial In-fill:** Enhances specific regions of the frame. (Medium quality, medium latency).
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:** Applies advanced filtering and sharpening techniques. (Lowest quality, lowest latency).

**4.  Feedback Loop & Model Training:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor perceptual quality (LPIPS), processing time, and network conditions.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use a reinforcement learning agent to optimize the weighting of input parameters for the rendering target quality determination.  Reward function based on perceptual quality and processing time.
*   **Model Updates:**  Regularly retrain the generative AI models with new content and user feedback.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each frame/segment:

1.  Get Presented Quality Score, Device Capabilities, Content Analysis, Network Conditions
2.  Calculate Rendering Target Quality (using weighted sum and RL agent)
3.  If Rendering Target Quality > Original Quality:
    4.  Select appropriate Generative AI Model (based on content type)
    5.  Apply Generative AI Model to enhance/generate frame/segment
    6.  Monitor Processing Time. If exceeds threshold, reduce enhancement level
4.  Display frame/segment
5.  Calculate Perceptual Quality (LPIPS)
6.  Update Reinforcement Learning Agent with Perceptual Quality and Processing Time
