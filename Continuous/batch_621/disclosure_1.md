## Dynamic Contextual ‘Skill’ Activation for Wearable Devices

**Concept:** Extend contextual awareness beyond app/content suggestion to *proactive skill activation* on wearable devices (smartwatches, AR glasses, etc.). Instead of simply surfacing relevant apps, the device anticipates user needs based on context and *directly initiates* pre-defined “skills” – short, automated tasks – without explicit user interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Skill Definition:** A ‘skill’ is a modular, executable unit (think: a tiny applet) designed for rapid execution.  Skills are defined by:
    *   `skill_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `name`: Human-readable name.
    *   `trigger_contexts`:  A list of context conditions that activate the skill. (See Context Definition below).
    *   `execution_code`: The executable logic of the skill (e.g., Python, Javascript).
    *   `data_requirements`: Any necessary data access permissions.
    *   `user_feedback_mode`: Options for providing feedback (haptic, visual, audio, none).
*   **Context Definition:** Context is represented as a hierarchical data structure.
    *   `location`: (Latitude, Longitude, Accuracy).
    *   `time`: (Hour, Minute, Day of Week, Date).
    *   `activity`: (Walking, Running, Cycling, Stationary, Driving – determined by device sensors).
    *   `environment`: (Temperature, Humidity, Light Level, Noise Level – sensor data).
    *   `social_context`: (Proximity of known devices/contacts – Bluetooth/WiFi scanning).
    *   `device_state`: (Battery Level, Network Connectivity, Screen State).
*   **Context Engine:** A background process constantly monitoring sensor data and deriving context.  It uses rule-based reasoning and potentially machine learning to infer higher-level context (e.g., "in a meeting," "commuting home").
*   **Skill Activation Pipeline:**
    1.  Context Engine updates the current context.
    2.  Skill Manager iterates through all defined skills.
    3.  For each skill, it evaluates if the current context matches the `trigger_contexts`.
    4.  If a match is found:
        a.  Check if the skill is currently executing.  Prevent overlapping executions.
        b.  Execute the `execution_code`.
        c.  Provide `user_feedback_mode` appropriate feedback.
*   **User Interface (Configuration):**
    *   Skill Marketplace: Browse/download pre-built skills.
    *   Skill Editor: Create/modify skills using a visual scripting interface (drag-and-drop blocks representing code functions).
    *   Context Rule Builder:  Define `trigger_contexts` using a user-friendly interface (e.g., "When I arrive at work AND it's before 9 AM...").
    *   Execution Logging:  View a history of executed skills and their results.

**Example Skills:**

*   **"Morning Briefing"**: (Trigger: Arrive at work AND time before 9 AM) – Reads out calendar events, news headlines, and weather forecast via audio.
*   **"Silent Mode"**: (Trigger: Detected meeting based on accelerometer/microphone data) – Automatically switches device to silent mode.
*   **"Home Automation"**: (Trigger: Approaching home location) – Sends a command to smart home system to turn on lights and adjust thermostat.
*   **"Navigation Start"**: (Trigger: Detected driving AND calendar entry for destination) – Automatically starts navigation to the destination in calendar entry.

**Pseudocode (Skill Activation):**

```
function skill_activation_loop() {
  while (true) {
    current_context = context_engine.get_current_context()
    for each skill in skill_manager.get_all_skills() {
      if (skill.is_executing()) {
        continue // Skip already executing skills
      }
      if (context_matches_trigger(current_context, skill.trigger_contexts)) {
        skill.start_execution()
        skill.provide_feedback()
      }
    }
    sleep(1) // Check every second
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  Existing contextual awareness systems primarily *recommend* actions. This system *proactively performs* them, automating tasks based on inferred user intent. It pushes beyond passive information delivery to active assistance, creating a truly intelligent and personalized experience. The skill-based modularity allows for easy extension and customization.
