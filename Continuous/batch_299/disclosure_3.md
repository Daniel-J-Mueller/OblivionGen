## Dynamic Task-Aware Resource Shaping

**Concept:** Extend automatic scaling beyond simply adding/removing nodes. Instead, *reshape* existing resources – CPU, memory, even GPU allocations – *within* nodes based on the specific requirements of tasks currently executing. This provides finer-grained control and reduces overall resource wastage.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Task Profiler:** A component integrated with the distributed application framework. This profiler analyzes incoming tasks and generates a resource demand profile – specifying CPU cores, memory (RAM & potentially GPU memory), network bandwidth, and storage I/O requirements. This profile is expressed as a JSON object:

    ```json
    {
        "task_id": "unique_task_identifier",
        "resource_demand": {
            "cpu_cores": 4,
            "memory_gb": 8,
            "gpu_memory_gb": 2,
            "network_bandwidth_mbps": 100,
            "storage_io_ops": 500
        },
        "priority": "high/medium/low",
        "estimated_runtime_seconds": 3600
    }
    ```

2.  **Resource Virtualization Layer:**  A hypervisor-level component residing on each compute node. It’s responsible for dynamically allocating and deallocating physical resources to tasks. This layer intercepts resource requests from tasks and maps them to available physical resources.  It employs containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to isolate tasks and enforce resource limits.

3.  **Resource Broker:** A central service managing resource allocation across the cluster. It receives task profiles from the Task Profiler and utilizes a scheduling algorithm to determine the best node for each task based on available resources and cluster load. The scheduling algorithm prioritizes tasks based on their ‘priority’ field in the task profile.  It then instructs the Resource Virtualization Layer on the assigned node to allocate the required resources.  

    Pseudocode for Resource Broker's Scheduling Algorithm:

    ```python
    def schedule_task(task_profile, cluster_state):
        best_node = None
        best_score = -1

        for node in cluster_state.nodes:
            score = calculate_node_score(node, task_profile)  # See details below

            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_node = node

        if best_node:
            best_node.allocate_resources(task_profile)
            return best_node
        else:
            # No suitable node found - trigger scaling (as per existing patent)
            return None

    def calculate_node_score(node, task_profile):
        # Calculate a score based on available resources, task priority, and node load
        available_cpu = node.total_cpu - node.used_cpu
        available_memory = node.total_memory - node.used_memory
        
        # Check if resources are sufficient
        if available_cpu < task_profile.resource_demand.cpu_cores or available_memory < task_profile.resource_demand.memory_gb:
            return -1

        score = (task_profile.priority_value * 0.5) + (available_cpu / node.total_cpu * 0.3) + (available_memory / node.total_memory * 0.2)
        return score
    ```

4.  **Real-time Monitoring & Adjustment:** A monitoring system continuously tracks resource utilization on each node. If resource demand exceeds allocated limits, the system dynamically adjusts resource allocations, potentially evicting low-priority tasks to free up resources for high-priority ones.

5.  **Resource Shaping API:** An API allowing clients to define custom resource shaping policies. These policies specify how resources should be allocated and adjusted based on application-specific metrics and workload characteristics. The policies are expressed in a declarative language (e.g., YAML).

    Example YAML policy:

    ```yaml
    policy_name: "high_priority_tasks"
    priority: "high"
    resource_demand:
      cpu_cores: 8
      memory_gb: 16
    behavior:
      eviction_threshold: 0.9  # Evict low-priority tasks if CPU utilization exceeds 90%
      preemption_enabled: true  # Allow preemption of lower-priority tasks
    ```



This system moves beyond simple capacity scaling to active *resource sculpting*, optimizing resource utilization and application performance. It adds a layer of intelligence to resource management, responding to dynamic workloads and maximizing the efficiency of the compute cluster.
