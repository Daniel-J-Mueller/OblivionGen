## Dynamic Subtitle "Mood" Rendering

**Concept:** Extend subtitle presentation beyond simple text and positioning to incorporate dynamic visual styling reflective of the emotional context of the dialogue.

**Specs:**

1.  **Emotional Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Audio stream and/or transcribed dialogue text.
    *   Process: Utilize a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) capable of identifying emotional cues (joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc.) and intensity levels. Output: Emotional “score” vector for each dialogue segment.
2.  **Visual Style Mapping:**
    *   Define a mapping between emotional score vectors and visual subtitle styles. Examples:
        *   High Joy: Bright, warm colors (yellow, orange), rounded font, slight pulsing animation.
        *   High Sadness: Muted, cool colors (blue, gray), serif font, subtle fading effect.
        *   High Anger: Red or black background, bold font, sharp edges, slight shaking effect.
        *   Fear: Dim, desaturated colors, thin, slightly erratic font, rapid flickering.
    *   Mapping can be parameterized to allow user customization of emotional styling preferences.
3.  **Subtitle Rendering Engine:**
    *   Input: Subtitle text, emotional score vector, visual style mapping.
    *   Process: Render subtitle text using the specified font, color, background, and animation based on the emotional score and mapping.
    *   Dynamic Adjustment: Subtitle style should smoothly transition between emotional states, not abruptly change.  Interpolate between styles.
4.  **Scene Context Integration:**
    *   Analyze the visual scene context (using computer vision techniques) to refine emotional styling.
    *   Example: If the scene is dark and stormy, even a neutral dialogue segment might be rendered with darker colors.
5.  **User Override:**
    *   Provide users with the option to disable emotional styling or adjust the intensity.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function renderSubtitle(subtitleText, emotionalScore, sceneContext, userSettings):
  emotionalStyle = applyStyleMapping(emotionalScore, sceneContext, userSettings)
  finalStyle = mergeStyle(emotionalStyle, userSettings.overrideStyle)

  renderedSubtitle = createTextElement(subtitleText)
  applyStyle(renderedSubtitle, finalStyle)

  return renderedSubtitle
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Style Mapping:** Store style mappings in a JSON or similar data format for easy modification.
*   **Animation:** Utilize CSS animations or a dedicated animation library for smooth transitions.
*   **Performance:** Optimize rendering to avoid performance bottlenecks, especially on low-end devices. Consider caching frequently used styles.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure that the emotional styling does not interfere with accessibility features (e.g., screen readers). Provide alternative text descriptions for visual effects.
*   **AI Training:** Train the emotional analysis module on a large dataset of video content with labeled emotional cues.
