**Propeller-Integrated Sonic Mapping System**

**Concept:** Augment the visual stereo triangulation with active sonic triangulation to create a more robust and accurate environmental map, particularly in conditions with limited visibility (dust, smoke, fog, underwater). This expands beyond purely visual data for obstacle avoidance and precision landing.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Propeller Blades: Modified propeller blades incorporating miniature ultrasonic transducers (at least 3 per blade, strategically positioned – leading edge, trailing edge, and mid-span).  Transducers must operate at a frequency suitable for the expected range and material properties of the environment (e.g., 40kHz - 200kHz).  Transducers are flush-mounted to minimize aerodynamic drag.
    *   Signal Conditioning & Processing Unit: A small, lightweight embedded system (located within the drone’s central housing) containing:
        *   High-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to capture the ultrasonic signals.
        *   Dedicated digital signal processors (DSPs) for time-of-flight (ToF) calculation and noise filtering.
        *   Microcontroller for system control and data communication.
    *   Power Supply: Integrated into the drone's existing power system, providing stable voltage to the transducers and processing unit.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Transmission Sequencing:**  The system cycles through each transducer, emitting a short ultrasonic pulse. The order of transmission is controlled to minimize interference between transducers.
    2.  **Time-of-Flight Measurement:**  Each transducer also acts as a receiver. The DSP calculates the ToF of the returned signal.  Advanced signal processing techniques (e.g., cross-correlation) are used to improve accuracy and reduce the effects of noise and multipath reflections.
    3.  **Triangulation & Mapping:** Using the ToF measurements from multiple transducers, a 3D point cloud of the surrounding environment is generated. The position of each point is calculated using triangulation. 
    4.  **Sensor Fusion:** Combine the sonic point cloud data with the visual stereo data from the existing cameras. Kalman filtering or similar techniques are employed to fuse the data, leveraging the strengths of each sensor.  Visual data provides texture and color, while sonic data provides accurate depth information.
    5.  **Environmental Mapping:** Create a dynamic environmental map. Map data should be stored, or streamed to a base station for real-time visualization.  The map should incorporate obstacle detection, free space analysis, and navigable path planning.
    6.  **Adaptive Frequency Selection:** The system automatically adjusts the ultrasonic frequency based on environmental conditions. Lower frequencies provide longer range but lower resolution, while higher frequencies provide shorter range but higher resolution.
