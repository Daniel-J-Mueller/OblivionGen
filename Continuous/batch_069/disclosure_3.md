## Acoustic Resonance Mapping for Enhanced Presence Detection

**Concept:** Integrate acoustic resonance mapping with the existing wireless signal propagation analysis to create a multi-modal presence detection system. The core idea is to leverage the unique acoustic fingerprint of a space – how sound waves bounce and resonate – combined with the channel state information (CSI) to dramatically improve accuracy and reduce false positives.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Acoustic Sensor Network:** Deploy a network of low-power, MEMS microphones throughout the building. Sensor density should be approximately 1 per 100 square feet. These sensors are synchronized via a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol.

2.  **Chirp Signal Generation:**  A central control unit generates a series of broadband "chirp" signals (linear frequency sweeps) and broadcasts them through strategically positioned ultrasonic transducers. These transducers should operate outside the range of normal human hearing to minimize disturbance.

3.  **Microphone Array Data Acquisition:** Each microphone captures the reflected chirp signals and transmits the data to a central processing unit.

4.  **Resonance Profile Generation:** The central processing unit performs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the captured acoustic data. This generates a “Resonance Profile” – a frequency-domain representation of the acoustic reflections. This profile captures the unique resonant frequencies of the space, altered by the presence of objects and, crucially, people.

5.  **Data Fusion Engine:** A dedicated Data Fusion Engine combines the Resonance Profile with the existing CSI data. This engine employs a weighted averaging algorithm, dynamically adjusting the weights based on environmental factors (e.g., noise levels, temperature).

6.  **Neural Network Adaptation:** The existing LSTM neural network is adapted to incorporate the Resonance Profile as an additional input feature vector.  This requires retraining the network with a dataset that includes both CSI and acoustic resonance data.

7.  **Confidence Scoring:**  A confidence scoring mechanism is implemented that combines the outputs of the neural network with the correlation between the expected Resonance Profile (based on a pre-mapped baseline) and the observed Resonance Profile. A significant deviation from the baseline, combined with a high neural network output, indicates a high probability of human presence.

**Pseudocode (Data Fusion & Neural Network Input):**

```pseudocode
// Input:
//   CSI_Data: Vector of statistical parameters derived from CSI
//   Acoustic_Data: Vector representing the Resonance Profile
//   Baseline_Profile: Pre-mapped acoustic profile of the space

// Data Fusion:
Correlation = CalculateCorrelation(Acoustic_Data, Baseline_Profile)
Weighted_Acoustic_Data =  Correlation * Acoustic_Data //Adjust acoustic data based on correlation to baseline
Fused_Input = Concatenate(CSI_Data, Weighted_Acoustic_Data)

// Neural Network Input Processing:
Input_Vector = Normalize(Fused_Input)

// Pass Input_Vector to LSTM Network
Output = LSTM_Network(Input_Vector)

//Confidence Scoring:
Confidence =  Output * (1 + Correlation) //Boost confidence based on resonance profile match
```

**Hardware Components:**

*   Low-Power MEMS Microphones (e.g., Knowles SPU0410LR5H-QB)
*   Ultrasonic Transducers (e.g., Murata MA40S4S1)
*   Embedded Processing Unit (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano)
*   Wireless Communication Module (e.g., ESP32)

**Novelty:**

This system isn’t simply adding another sensor; it’s creating a *dynamic* acoustic fingerprint of the space that is inherently sensitive to changes caused by human presence.  The correlation-based weighting system enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and improves the reliability of the presence detection. The fusion of CSI and acoustic resonance data will yield much more robust and accurate results than either modality alone.
