## Adaptive Data Partitioning & Predictive Redundancy

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust data partitioning size *during* upload based on real-time network conditions and predictive analysis of process completion times. Introduce redundant process creation *before* failure detection, based on probabilistic modeling.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Partitioning Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw data stream for upload, initial partition size (configurable).
*   **Process:**
    *   Continuously monitor network bandwidth, latency, and packet loss.
    *   Track completion times of individual data partitions being uploaded.
    *   Implement a dynamic partition size adjustment algorithm:
        *   If network conditions degrade: Reduce partition size.
        *   If network conditions improve: Increase partition size.
        *   Partition size changes applied *during* upload â€“ splitting currently uploading partitions if necessary.
    *   Algorithm utilizes a moving average of network metrics and completion times to determine optimal partition size.
    *   Partitioning can be optimized for content type (e.g. smaller partitions for high-priority data, larger for less critical data).
*   **Output:** Stream of data partitions with dynamically adjusted sizes.

**2. Predictive Redundancy Module:**

*   **Input:**  Completion times of data partitions, network metrics, historical data on process failure rates.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a probabilistic model (e.g., Bayesian network, Markov model) to predict the likelihood of a data partition upload failing. Factors considered include:
        *   Current network conditions.
        *   Completion time of similar partitions.
        *   Historical failure rates for the server.
        *   Server load.
    *   If the predicted failure probability exceeds a threshold, *proactively* initiate a redundant upload of the same data partition to a different server or using a different network path.
    *   Redundant uploads are initiated *before* the original upload is detected as failed.
*   **Output:**  Initiation of redundant data partition uploads.

**3. Orchestration & Reconciliation Module:**

*   **Input:** Completion signals from all uploads (original and redundant), data partition IDs.
*   **Process:**
    *   Track completion of all uploads.
    *   Upon successful completion of *any* upload of a data partition, terminate all other uploads of that partition.
    *   Ensure data integrity through checksum validation of completed uploads.
    *   Log all events for analysis and optimization of the system.
*   **Output:** Confirmed successful upload of all data partitions.

**Pseudocode (Orchestration & Reconciliation):**

```
// Data structure for tracking uploads
class UploadStatus {
  partitionID: string
  uploadID: string // Unique identifier for the upload process
  status: "pending" | "inProgress" | "completed" | "failed"
  checksum: string
}

// Array to store upload statuses
uploads: UploadStatus[]

// Function to add a new upload
function addUpload(partitionID, uploadID) {
  uploads.push({
    partitionID: partitionID,
    uploadID: uploadID,
    status: "pending",
    checksum: ""
  });
}

// Function to mark upload as completed
function markCompleted(uploadID, checksum) {
  let upload = uploads.find(u => u.uploadID == uploadID);
  if (upload) {
    upload.status = "completed";
    upload.checksum = checksum;

    // Terminate other uploads of the same partition
    terminateRedundantUploads(upload.partitionID);
  }
}

// Function to terminate redundant uploads
function terminateRedundantUploads(partitionID) {
  uploads.forEach(upload => {
    if (upload.partitionID == partitionID && upload.status != "completed") {
      // Send signal to terminate the upload process
      terminateProcess(upload.uploadID);
    }
  });
}
```
