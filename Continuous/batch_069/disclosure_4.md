## Adaptive Batching with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the existing message batching system with a predictive pre-fetch mechanism. Instead of solely reacting to client requests or completing batches, the system will proactively identify likely future message needs and pre-fetch/pre-batch those messages.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Historical Request Analyzer:** Continuously monitors client request patterns (message IDs, strict order parameters, request frequency).  Stores data in a time-series database.
*   **Predictive Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) trained on historical request data.  Predicts future message requests based on patterns.  Outputs a probability distribution over potential future messages.
*   **Pre-Batch Generator:**  Responsible for creating pre-batches of messages based on the Predictive Model's output.  Prioritizes messages with higher probability and ensures strict order parameter consistency within the pre-batch.
*   **Pre-Batch Cache:**  A fast, in-memory cache to store generated pre-batches.
*   **Batch Fusion Module:**  When a client request arrives, this module checks the Pre-Batch Cache for relevant pre-batches. If found, it fuses them with the currently assembling batch *before* sending to the queue client, potentially reducing latency.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The Historical Request Analyzer continuously logs client requests.
2.  **Prediction Generation:** The Predictive Model periodically (e.g., every 100ms) analyzes the historical request data and generates a probability distribution over potential future messages.
3.  **Pre-Batch Creation:** The Pre-Batch Generator creates pre-batches based on the Predictive Model's output.  It considers:
    *   Probability of messages
    *   Strict order parameter values â€“ messages with the same parameter are grouped.
    *   Batch size limits (configurable).
4.  **Cache Storage:** Pre-batches are stored in the Pre-Batch Cache.
5.  **Client Request Handling:**
    *   When a client request arrives, the Batch Fusion Module checks the Pre-Batch Cache for relevant pre-batches based on requested messages and strict order parameters.
    *   If matching pre-batches are found, they are fused with the current batch *before* sending to the client.
    *   If no matching pre-batches are found, the system proceeds with normal batching.
6.  **Model Retraining:** The Predictive Model is periodically retrained using updated historical request data to improve its accuracy.

**IV. Pseudocode (Batch Fusion Module):**

```pseudocode
function fuseBatch(clientRequest, currentBatch):
    predictedMessages = getPredictedMessages(clientRequest)  // Query Predictive Model
    matchingPreBatches = findPreBatches(predictedMessages) // Search Pre-Batch Cache

    if matchingPreBatches:
        for preBatch in matchingPreBatches:
            currentBatch.append(preBatch)  // Add pre-fetched messages to current batch

    return currentBatch
```

**V. Configuration Parameters:**

*   `predictionInterval`: Frequency of Predictive Model updates (milliseconds).
*   `preBatchMaxSize`: Maximum size of a pre-batch (number of messages).
*   `cacheTTL`: Time-to-live for pre-batches in the cache (seconds).
*   `retrainingFrequency`: Frequency of Predictive Model retraining (hours).
