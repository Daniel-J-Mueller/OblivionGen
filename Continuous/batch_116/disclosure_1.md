## Dynamic Network Content Narration – Interactive "Scene" Creation & Spatial Audio

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple narration of *portions* of a webpage to allow users to create interactive “scenes” within the network content, tied to spatial audio cues. This moves beyond describing what *is* on the page, to creating a localized, navigable audio environment *within* the page.

**Specs:**

1.  **Scene Definition:**  A user interface element (likely browser extension or embedded web component) allows a user to select areas of a webpage (images, text blocks, interactive elements). These selections become "Scene Nodes".

2.  **Node Attributes:** Each Scene Node possesses:
    *   **Spatial Coordinates:** X, Y, Z coordinates defining its position within the webpage “space”.  Z-axis represents depth/layering (allowing audio to appear “closer” or “further away”).
    *   **Audio Clip:** User-recorded or synthesized audio describing the Scene Node.
    *   **Interaction Trigger:**  Determines *how* the audio clip is triggered:
        *   **Mouse Hover:** Audio plays when the mouse cursor is over the Scene Node.
        *   **Click/Tap:** Audio plays on a click/tap event.
        *   **Scroll Into View:** Audio plays when the Scene Node scrolls into view.
        *   **Timer:** Audio plays after a set delay.
        *   **Event Listener:**  Audio plays in response to a specific JavaScript event on the page (e.g., a button press, data load).
    *   **Audio Pan/Volume:**  Controls for panning the audio left/right and adjusting the volume, further enhancing spatialization.
    *   **Visual Indicator:** Optional visual cue (e.g., subtle highlight, pulsing border) to indicate that a Scene Node is active/playing audio.

3.  **Scene Graph Generation:** The system compiles the defined Scene Nodes into a Scene Graph – a hierarchical data structure representing the spatial relationships between the nodes.

4.  **Spatial Audio Engine:** A dedicated JavaScript engine handles the rendering of spatial audio.
    *   **Binaural Rendering:** Utilize Web Audio API to create a binaural audio experience, simulating how sound is perceived by human ears.  Account for head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create a more realistic spatial soundscape.
    *   **Distance Attenuation:**  Audio volume decreases with distance from the simulated “listener” (based on mouse position or scrolling).
    *   **Obstruction Handling:** (Advanced) If the webpage contains depth information or 3D elements, attempt to simulate sound occlusion (e.g., sound muffled by an object).

5.  **Cloud Synchronization & Sharing:** Allow users to save their Scene Graphs to the cloud and share them with others.  Other users can then "experience" the webpage with the author’s customized spatial audio environment.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Scene Node Class
Class SceneNode {
  x, y, z;      // Spatial Coordinates
  audioClip;    // Audio File/Buffer
  triggerType;  // "hover", "click", "scroll", "timer", "event"
  pan, volume;  // Audio settings
  visualIndicator; // Optional visual cue
}

//SpatialAudioEngine Class
Class SpatialAudioEngine {
  sceneGraph;
  listenerPosition;

  function initialize(sceneGraph) {
    this.sceneGraph = sceneGraph;
    // Load audio clips and create Web Audio buffers
  }

  function updateListenerPosition(x, y) {
    this.listenerPosition = {x, y};
  }

  function render() {
    for each node in sceneGraph {
      distance = calculateDistance(listenerPosition, node.x, node.y);
      volume = baseVolume * (1 / distance);  // Distance Attenuation
      pan = node.pan;
      playAudio(node.audioClip, volume, pan);
    }
  }
}

// Event Handling (e.g., mousemove)
function onMouseMove(event) {
  spatialAudioEngine.updateListenerPosition(event.clientX, event.clientY);
  spatialAudioEngine.render();
}
```

**Innovation:** This expands the scope from describing content to *augmenting* the network experience with interactive, spatial audio. It's a move towards turning webpages into immersive, navigable audio environments. Users can essentially “walk” around the page with their ears. It’s a different approach than accessibility features like screen readers; it’s a form of *enhancement*.
