## Dynamic Process Anticipation & Pre-Fetching

**Concept:** Extend the progress data concept to *anticipate* user needs within a process *before* explicit commands are given, pre-fetching data or initiating sub-processes. This goes beyond simply resuming; it aims to proactively streamline the overall experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** “Anticipation Engine” – a module integrated within the existing system architecture.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Progress Data (as defined in the patent).
    *   Process Definition Data: Detailed metadata about each supported process, including common user paths, likely next steps, associated data requirements, and typical execution times. This could be a knowledge graph.
    *   User Behavioral Data: Historical data on user interactions within the same process, including command sequences, timing, and preferences.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Context Analysis:** Upon receiving progress data (or initiating a process), the Anticipation Engine analyzes the current state, the Process Definition Data, and the User Behavioral Data.
    2.  **Probability Calculation:** The engine calculates the probability of various next steps the user might take. This could use machine learning models trained on historical data.
    3.  **Pre-fetching & Sub-Process Initiation:** Based on the probability scores, the engine initiates pre-fetching of required data or launches sub-processes that are likely to be needed soon.  A threshold can be set to avoid unnecessary pre-fetching.
    4.  **Resource Allocation:**  The system allocates resources (bandwidth, processing power) to the pre-fetched data or initiated sub-processes.
    5.  **Monitoring & Adjustment:** The engine monitors user interactions in real-time and adjusts pre-fetching/sub-process initiation accordingly. If the user takes an unexpected path, resources can be reallocated.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ProcessDefinition`: (ProcessID, Name, Steps[], DataRequirements[], CommonPaths[], DefaultNextStep)
    *   `UserBehaviorProfile`: (UserID, ProcessID, StepSequence[], TimingData[], PreferenceData[])
    *   `AnticipationQueue`: (ProcessID, NextStep, DataRequired, Priority, ResourceAllocation)
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function anticipateNextStep(progressData, userID, processID):
  processDefinition = getProcessDefinition(processID)
  userBehaviorProfile = getUserBehaviorProfile(userID, processID)

  nextStepProbabilities = calculateNextStepProbabilities(progressData, processDefinition, userBehaviorProfile)

  sortedNextSteps = sortNextStepsByProbability(nextStepProbabilities)

  for step in sortedNextSteps:
    if step.probability > threshold:
      dataRequired = step.dataRequirements
      prefetchData(dataRequired)
      launchSubProcess(step.subProcess)
      addToAnticipationQueue(processID, step, dataRequired, step.priority)
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Increased memory capacity for caching pre-fetched data.  Faster network connectivity for efficient data transfer.
*   **Security Considerations:** Secure caching of pre-fetched data.  Authorization checks to ensure only authorized sub-processes are launched.
*   **Potential Applications:** Streaming media (pre-loading the next segment), document editing (pre-loading commonly used templates or images), smart home automation (pre-loading scenes based on time of day and user behavior).
