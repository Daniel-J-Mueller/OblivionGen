**Dynamic Volumetric Projection with Particle Suspension**

**Concept:** Expand beyond 2D raster scanning to create true volumetric displays. Instead of correcting for projection onto a surface, we *define* the display volume itself.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Technology:** Utilize a focused ultrasound array to create a temporary suspension of micro-particles (e.g., water droplets, biocompatible polymer microspheres) within a defined volume. These particles serve as the 'pixels' of the display.
*   **Projection Method:** Instead of raster scanning *onto* a surface, the laser projector directs light *into* the particle suspension volume. Precise control of laser beam steering and intensity modulation illuminates individual particles or groups of particles.
*   **Particle Control:** The ultrasound array modulates its frequencies and amplitudes to dynamically position and refresh the particle cloud, effectively controlling pixel locations in 3D space.  Frequency modulation will dictate particle height; amplitude will dictate lateral positioning.
*   **Scanning System Integration:** The laser projection system will need tight integration with the ultrasound control system. A feedback loop will monitor particle position (using optical sensors â€“ see below) and adjust both laser steering and ultrasound modulation in real-time.
*   **Sensor Suite:**  A multi-camera system (structured light or time-of-flight) tracks particle positions and provides feedback to the control system.  This is vital for calibration and maintaining image fidelity. 
*   **Refresh Rate:** Target refresh rate of 60Hz, or higher. This will require fast ultrasound modulation and laser steering.
*   **Volume Size:** Initial target volume: 30cm x 30cm x 30cm. Scalability to larger volumes will be a key design goal.
*   **Particle Characteristics:** Particles must be:
    *   Highly reflective in the visible spectrum
    *   Biocompatible (for potential medical applications)
    *   Stable in suspension
    *   Non-toxic
*   **Control System Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Receive image data (frame buffer)
    frameData = getImageData();

    // 2. For each pixel in the image:
    for (int x = 0; x < imageWidth; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y < imageHeight; y++) {
            pixelColor = frameData[x][y];

            // 3. Calculate 3D position of corresponding particle
            particlePosition = calculateParticlePosition(x, y);

            // 4. Send ultrasound control signals to position particle
            sendUltrasoundSignals(particlePosition);

            // 5. Send laser steering signals to illuminate particle
            sendLaserSteeringSignals(particlePosition, pixelColor);
        }
    }

    // 6. Wait for next frame
    waitForNextFrame();
}
```

*   **Power Requirements:** High-frequency ultrasound drivers and precise laser steering mechanisms will demand significant power. Efficient power management will be critical.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Ultrasound transducers (piezoelectric materials)
    *   High-precision laser steering mirrors/galvanometers
    *   Reflective micro-particles
    *   Transparent containment vessel for particle suspension
* **Potential Applications:** Holographic displays, medical imaging, interactive art installations, augmented reality.
* **Novelty:** This moves beyond correcting for surface distortions to *creating* a display volume from scratch, enabling true 3D imagery without the limitations of traditional 2D projection.
