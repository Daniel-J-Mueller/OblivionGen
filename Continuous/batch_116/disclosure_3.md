## Adaptive Expiration Based on User Behavior Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the expiration data system to incorporate predicted user behavior, enabling preemptive cache refreshment and significantly reducing latency for anticipated requests. Instead of *reacting* to requests and adjusting expiration retroactively, the system *predicts* likely future requests and adjusts expiration *proactively*.

**Specifications:**

1.  **User Behavior Profile:**
    *   Each user (or user segment) maintains a profile tracking request history, time-of-day patterns, location (if permitted), and device type.
    *   A statistical model (e.g., Markov chain, recurrent neural network) analyzes this data to predict the probability of future resource requests.
    *   The prediction horizon is configurable (e.g., 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours).

2.  **Predictive Expiration Adjustment:**
    *   A dedicated module monitors predicted resource request probabilities.
    *   If the predicted probability of a resource request exceeds a threshold (configurable per resource and user segment), the expiration time for that resource is *shortened* at the relevant cache levels (closer to the user).
    *   The degree of shortening is proportional to the predicted probability and inversely proportional to the current expiration time.  A higher probability and shorter existing expiration result in a more aggressive shortening.
    *   Conversely, if the predicted probability falls below another threshold, the expiration time is *extended* (up to a maximum limit defined per resource).

3.  **Cache Hierarchy Integration:**
    *   The predictive expiration adjustment is applied across the entire cache hierarchy.
    *   Edge caches receive the most aggressive adjustments, while higher-level caches receive more moderate adjustments.
    *   A "ripple effect" algorithm propagates the adjustments across the hierarchy, ensuring consistency.

4.  **Resource Prioritization:**
    *   A resource prioritization mechanism assigns a "relevance score" to each resource based on its historical popularity, current trends, and user preferences.
    *   Resources with higher relevance scores receive more frequent predictive adjustments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each user (or segment)
FOR user IN users:
  // Predict next resource requests
  predicted_requests = predict_resource_requests(user.behavior_profile)

  // For each predicted resource
  FOR resource IN predicted_requests:
    // Calculate predicted request probability
    probability = resource.probability

    // Get current expiration data at the nearest cache level
    current_expiration = get_expiration_data(resource, user.cache_level)

    // Calculate new expiration time
    new_expiration = calculate_new_expiration(current_expiration, probability)

    // Apply new expiration data
    set_expiration_data(resource, new_expiration, user.cache_level)

    // Propagate adjustment to higher cache levels (if necessary)
    propagate_expiration_adjustment(resource, user.cache_level)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserBehaviorProfile`: Contains request history, time-of-day patterns, location data, and device type.
*   `Resource`: Stores resource metadata, including relevance score, historical popularity, and current expiration data.
*   `CacheLevel`: Represents a level in the cache hierarchy, storing expiration data and relevant configuration parameters.
