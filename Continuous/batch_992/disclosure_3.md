## Dynamic Graph Pruning with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the inconsistent cycle detection and pruning system to incorporate a temporal decay mechanism for edge weights. This allows the system to adapt to evolving relationships within the text data, prioritizing recent information and de-emphasizing stale connections. This is especially useful for analyzing streams of text (news feeds, social media) or evolving documents (collaborative writing).

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **EdgeWeight:** A composite data type consisting of:
    *   `confidence`: A float representing the initial confidence score (as in the original patent).
    *   `last_updated`: Timestamp of the last time the edge was reinforced by new data.
    *   `decay_rate`:  A configurable float controlling the rate at which the edge's weight diminishes over time.  Higher values mean faster decay.
    *   `current_weight`: A derived float that is the result of the `confidence` multiplied by an exponential decay function of `time_since_last_updated` and `decay_rate`.

*   **GraphNode:**  Existing structure, unchanged.

*   **GraphEdge:** Updated structure to include `EdgeWeight`.

**2. Algorithms:**

*   **Weight Update Function:** Called whenever a new text collection reinforces a relationship represented by an edge:
    ```pseudocode
    function update_edge_weight(edge, new_probability, current_time):
        edge.EdgeWeight.confidence = max(edge.EdgeWeight.confidence, new_probability)  //Retain highest confidence
        edge.EdgeWeight.last_updated = current_time
        edge.EdgeWeight.current_weight = edge.EdgeWeight.confidence * exp(-decay_rate * (current_time - edge.EdgeWeight.last_updated))
    ```

*   **Pruning Algorithm:**  Modified to consider `current_weight` instead of just `confidence`:
    ```pseudocode
    function prune_graph(graph, consistency_rules, threshold):
        inconsistent_cycles = detect_inconsistent_cycles(graph, consistency_rules)
        edges_to_prune = []

        for cycle in inconsistent_cycles:
            for edge in cycle.edges:
                if edge.EdgeWeight.current_weight < threshold:
                    edges_to_prune.append(edge)

        for edge in edges_to_prune:
            graph.remove_edge(edge)
    ```

**3. Configuration Parameters:**

*   `global_decay_rate`: A default decay rate applied to all edges if not overridden.
*   `edge_specific_decay_rates`:  A mapping of relationship categories (e.g., "cause-effect", "part-of") to custom decay rates.  This allows prioritizing more stable relationships.
*   `pruning_threshold`: The minimum `current_weight` an edge must have to avoid pruning.
*   `update_frequency`: How often the weight update function is applied.

**4.  Implementation Notes:**

*   The `decay_rate` should be tuned based on the expected lifespan of relationships within the data.
*   A hybrid approach could be used, combining temporal decay with the existing inconsistent cycle detection for more robust pruning.
*   The system can be extended to support different decay functions (e.g., linear decay, step decay) beyond exponential decay.

**5. Use Cases:**

*   **News Trend Analysis:** Track evolving relationships between entities in a stream of news articles.
*   **Social Media Sentiment Analysis:** Identify shifting opinions and connections between users and topics.
*   **Knowledge Base Maintenance:** Keep a knowledge graph up-to-date by removing stale or disproven connections.
*   **Dynamic Document Summarization:**  Generate summaries that reflect the most recent information in a document.
