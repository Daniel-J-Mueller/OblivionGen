**Adaptive Data Streaming with Predictive Prefetching**

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of serving limited data to resource-constrained UIs by introducing *predictive prefetching* based on user interaction patterns and a probabilistic model of file access. This moves beyond simply responding to requests to *anticipating* needs, dramatically improving the perceived responsiveness of the UI.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Model:** Augment the existing data structure with a "usage history" component for each file/directory. This history stores timestamps of access (read, write, modification) and potentially the *type* of operation (e.g., open, save, scroll).
*   **Probabilistic Model:** Employ a Markov Chain or similar probabilistic model to predict future file accesses based on the usage history. The model learns transition probabilities between files/directories.  For example: “If the user just opened `file_a.txt` and `file_b.txt`, there's a 70% chance they will next access `file_c.txt`.”
*   **Prefetching Engine:** A background service monitors user interaction with the UI.  When a file is accessed, the prefetching engine queries the probabilistic model to identify likely next accesses. It proactively fetches (or prepares for streaming) these files in a lower priority, background thread.
*   **Adaptive Streaming Control:** The system dynamically adjusts the prefetch depth (how many levels of predicted files to fetch) and the data resolution (quality/detail) of prefetched files based on network bandwidth, CPU load, and available memory.
*   **UI Interaction Handling:** When the user *does* request a file, the system first checks if it's already available in the prefetch cache.  If so, it serves it *immediately*.  If not, it falls back to the existing request/streaming mechanism.
*   **Cache Management:** A tiered caching system:
    *   **High-Priority Cache:** Recently accessed files (fast access, limited size).
    *   **Prefetch Cache:** Files proactively fetched based on prediction (moderate size).
    *   **Disk/Remote Storage:** Original data source.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```
function handleFileAccess(file):
  accessTimestamp = getCurrentTimestamp()
  updateUsageHistory(file, accessTimestamp)

  predictedFiles = getPredictedFiles(file) // Using probabilistic model
  for predictedFile in predictedFiles:
    if predictedFile not in prefetchCache:
      prefetchFile(predictedFile)

function prefetchFile(file):
  // Asynchronously fetch/prepare file data
  // Adjust data resolution based on system load and network bandwidth

  addToPrefetchCache(file)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Collaborative Filtering:** Incorporate data from *other* users with similar access patterns to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Factor in the user's current task or application to refine the prediction model.  (e.g. User is in "debug mode" -> prioritize source code files).
*   **AI-Driven Prediction:** Replace the probabilistic model with a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained on a large dataset of user access patterns.
*   **Compression and Delta Encoding:** Optimizing the streamed data with compression and delta encoding to reduce network overhead.
