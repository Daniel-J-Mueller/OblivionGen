## Adaptive Environmental Soundscapes

**Concept:** Extend selective audio alteration beyond simply *removing* undesirable sounds. Instead, dynamically *replace* them with contextually appropriate ambient soundscapes, enriching the communication experience. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Acoustic Event Classifier:** (Existing – leverages ML models from the source patent) – Identifies undesirable sounds (barking, doorbells, etc.) *and* analyzes the broader acoustic environment (speech presence, background noise level, estimated room type – office, home, outdoors).
*   **Soundscape Generator:** A procedural audio engine. Accepts parameters including:
    *   Dominant acoustic environment classification (from Acoustic Event Classifier).
    *   Undesirable sound type.
    *   Desired ‘mood’ (configurable by user – calm, energetic, neutral).
    *   Real-time audio analysis (RMS, frequency content of remaining audio).
*   **Audio Weaver:** A mixing and blending module responsible for seamlessly integrating the generated soundscape with the remaining audio from the communication session. 
*   **User Profile & Configuration:** Allows users to customize soundscape preferences (mood, intensity, preferred ambient sounds).

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  The Acoustic Event Classifier identifies an undesirable sound.
2.  Simultaneously, the classifier analyzes the ambient acoustic environment.
3.  Based on the identified sound *and* the environmental analysis, the Soundscape Generator creates a tailored ambient soundscape. (Example: Dog barking in a home office -> subtle coffee shop ambience. Doorbell during a serious business call -> muted, natural wind chimes. )
4.  The Audio Weaver attenuates the undesirable sound *and* blends in the generated soundscape, ensuring a natural transition. The level of attenuation/blend is dynamic, adjusting to the prominence of the undesirable sound and the user's preference.
5.  The modified audio stream is transmitted to the second user.

**3. Pseudocode (Soundscape Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateSoundscape(undesirableSoundType, acousticEnvironment, mood):
  // Define base soundscape components based on environment
  IF acousticEnvironment == "home_office":
    baseComponents = ["coffee_shop", "rain_on_window", "birds_chirping"]
    moodWeighting = {“calm”: 0.6, “energetic”: 0.3, “neutral”: 0.1}
  ELSE IF acousticEnvironment == "outdoors":
    baseComponents = ["wind", "forest_ambience", "distant_traffic"]
    moodWeighting = {“calm”: 0.4, “energetic”: 0.5, “neutral”: 0.1}
  ELSE:
    baseComponents = ["generic_ambience"]  // Fallback
    moodWeighting = {“calm”: 0.33, “energetic”: 0.33, “neutral”: 0.34}

  // Adjust based on undesirable sound
  IF undesirableSoundType == "dog_barking":
    addComponents = ["gentle_music", "flowing_water"]
    weightAdjustment = {“gentle_music”: 0.4, “flowing_water”: 0.3}
  ELSE IF undesirableSoundType == "doorbell":
    addComponents = ["wind_chimes", "distant_city_sounds"]
    weightAdjustment = {“wind_chimes”: 0.5, “distant_city_sounds”: 0.2}

  // Combine components, weighted by mood & adjustments
  soundscape = combine(baseComponents, addComponents, moodWeighting, weightAdjustment)
  RETURN soundscape
```

**4. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Cloud-based processing infrastructure (for ML models & soundscape generation).
*   Low-latency audio streaming protocols.
*   User-facing application for configuration.
*   Extensive sound library (high-quality ambient recordings).
