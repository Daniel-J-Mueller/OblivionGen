## Mobile Robotic Swarm Coordination & Dynamic Charging Mesh

**Concept:** Expand the single MDU charging station concept into a dynamic, distributed charging mesh leveraging swarm robotics principles. Imagine a 'cloud' of smaller, specialized MDUs – some focused solely on transport, others on charging delivery.

**Specs:**

*   **MDU Types:**
    *   **Haulers:** Standard transport MDUs, optimized for carrying inventory holders. Equipped with moderate onboard power (fast & slow charge capacitors/batteries as per the patent).
    *   **Chargers:** Smaller, highly maneuverable MDUs dedicated *only* to delivering power. Equipped with large capacity, fast-discharge batteries and wireless/inductive charging coils. No inventory handling capability.
    *   **Directors:** Oversee the swarm, manage task assignment, and optimize charging schedules. Minimal physical components, primarily software/communication focused.
*   **Charging Infrastructure:**
    *   Centralized ‘Power Hubs’: High-capacity charging stations providing power to the Charger MDUs.
    *   Distributed Charging Pads: Wireless/inductive charging pads strategically placed throughout the inventory system. Chargers can autonomously navigate to these pads to replenish their energy.
*   **Swarm Communication Protocol:**
    *   MDUs communicate using a mesh network (WiFi/UWB).
    *   Director MDUs broadcast task assignments and coordinate movements.
    *   MDUs dynamically negotiate charging opportunities (e.g., "I need 20% power, can anyone spare?")
*   **Dynamic Charging Algorithm:**
    *   Director MDUs monitor MDU power levels and task requirements.
    *   When a Hauler MDU needs charging while stationary (e.g., dropping off/picking up an inventory holder), a Charger MDU is dispatched.
    *   The Charger MDU physically docks with the Hauler (magnetic/mechanical coupling) or utilizes high-power wireless charging.
    *   Charging duration is optimized based on remaining task time and Hauler power needs.
    *   Priority is given to MDUs with critical tasks or low battery levels.
*   **Power Sharing Protocol:**
    *   Chargers can temporarily 'loan' power to other MDUs in emergencies.
    *   MDUs can form temporary ‘power chains’ to distribute energy across the swarm.
*   **Obstacle Avoidance/Path Planning:**  Advanced algorithms to enable MDUs to navigate crowded inventory systems while dynamically re-routing around obstacles and other MDUs.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Charging Dispatch):**

```
// Director MDU Logic

function dispatch_charger(hauler_mdu, task_time_remaining):
  if hauler_mdu.power_level < threshold:
    // Find nearest available charger
    nearest_charger = find_nearest_available_charger(hauler_mdu.location)
    if nearest_charger:
      // Assign charging task
      assign_task(nearest_charger, hauler_mdu, charging_duration(task_time_remaining, hauler_mdu.power_level))
      // Send charging instructions
      send_instructions(nearest_charger, navigate_to(hauler_mdu.location), dock(hauler_mdu), charge(charging_duration))
  else:
    // No charging needed
    return

function charging_duration(task_time, power_level):
  // Calculate required charge based on task duration and power consumption
  // Return estimated charging time
  return estimated_time

function find_nearest_available_charger(location):
  // Scan for chargers within range
  // Return charger with highest power level and shortest travel time
  return nearest_charger
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond static charging stations to a truly dynamic, self-organizing power delivery system. Enables continuous operation of MDUs without requiring them to return to fixed charging points.  Increases system redundancy and resilience.
