**Innovation Description:**

This system extends the resistance-based layer profiling from the provided patent by incorporating localized thermal stimulation and measurement. The premise is that material properties (resistivity, thermal conductivity) vary even within a seemingly uniform layer. A localized heat pulse is applied to a small area of the multi-layer stack. The thermal response is captured by the high-resolution thermal camera. Simultaneously, the four-point probe measures the resistance. 

**Algorithm / Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize thermal camera, four-point probe, XYZ stage, and data acquisition system.
Calibrate thermal camera and four-point probe.

// Scan Parameters
Define scan area (X, Y dimensions) and step size (resolution).

// Main Loop
For each scan point (x, y) in scan area:

    // Move XYZ stage to (x, y)
    MoveStage(x, y);

    // Apply heat pulse
    ApplyHeatPulse(duration, power);

    // Measure thermal response
    thermalData = CaptureThermalData();

    // Measure resistance
    resistance = MeasureFourPointResistance();

    // Data Analysis
    // Estimate layer thicknesses based on resistance and known material properties.
    thicknesses = EstimateLayerThicknesses(resistance);

    // Estimate thermal conductivity of each layer from thermal response
    thermalConductivity = EstimateThermalConductivity(thermalData, thicknesses);

    // Store data (x, y, thicknesses, thermalConductivity)

// Output
Generate layer thickness map and thermal conductivity map.

```

The system can reveal subsurface defects, variations in material composition, or inconsistencies in layer deposition. Thermal conductivity acts as a secondary, independent measurement to validate or refine the thickness estimations. The result is a high-resolution map of layer thicknesses and thermal properties, offering significantly more detailed material characterization than resistance measurement alone. It will also allow for localized estimations of material composition.
