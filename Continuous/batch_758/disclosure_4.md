## Dynamic Attribute Weighting & Predictive Matching

**Concept:** Enhance matching accuracy by dynamically adjusting attribute weights based on historical matching data and predictive modeling. The system learns which attributes are *most* indicative of a correct match for specific item categories, and prioritizes those attributes during the similarity scoring process.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Logs all user-confirmed matches (from the existing system).
    *   Records the attributes of *both* the item description and the matched item definition.
    *   Stores the similarity scores *for each attribute* contributing to the overall match score.
    *   Categorizes items (using a pre-defined taxonomy or a machine learning model).

2.  **Weight Learning Module:**
    *   Utilizes historical data to train a machine learning model (e.g., a neural network, decision tree, or regression model).
    *   The model’s input is the item category and the individual attribute similarity scores.
    *   The model’s output is a set of weights for each attribute *within that category*.
    *   Regularly retrains the model (e.g., weekly, monthly) to adapt to changing item descriptions and data patterns.
    *   Implements a decay factor to reduce the influence of older data.

3.  **Dynamic Scoring Engine:**
    *   Replaces the static attribute weighting scheme with dynamic weights obtained from the Weight Learning Module.
    *   For each item description, the system identifies the item category.
    *   It retrieves the corresponding attribute weights for that category.
    *   The similarity score is calculated as a weighted sum of the individual attribute similarity scores.

4. **Predictive Attribute Prioritization:**
    *   Before calculating similarity, use a predictive model (trained on historical data) to *predict* the most important attributes for the current item description.
    *   The model inputs include item description keywords, category, and potentially merchant information.
    *   The model outputs a ranked list of attributes.
    *   Apply a boost to the weights of the top-ranked attributes during similarity calculation.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Scoring Engine):**

```
function calculate_similarity(item_description, item_definition):
  category = determine_item_category(item_description)
  attribute_weights = get_attribute_weights(category)

  total_similarity = 0
  for each attribute in item_description and item_definition:
    similarity_score = calculate_attribute_similarity(attribute)
    weighted_score = similarity_score * attribute_weights[attribute]
    total_similarity += weighted_score

  return total_similarity
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AttributeWeights`: A dictionary mapping attribute names to weight values (floating-point numbers).
*   `HistoricalMatchData`: A data structure storing records of user-confirmed matches, including item descriptions, item definitions, attribute similarity scores, and overall match scores.
*   `ItemCategory`: A pre-defined taxonomy or a machine learning model for categorizing items.
