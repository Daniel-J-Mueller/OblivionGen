## Dynamic Preference Prediction & Proactive Item Substitution

**Concept:** Instead of *reacting* to item unavailability or delivery constraint changes, proactively predict user preferences based on browsing history, purchase patterns, and real-time contextual data (time of day, location, weather) to pre-populate alternative item suggestions *before* the user even encounters a problem. This moves beyond simple substitution to a predictive, preference-aware experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing Module:**

*   **Input:**
    *   User browsing history (item views, searches, add-to-cart actions).
    *   User purchase history (items purchased, frequency, value).
    *   Real-time location data (GPS, WiFi triangulation).
    *   Current time.
    *   Local weather data.
    *   Item catalog data (availability, price, shipping options).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model sequential user behavior. LSTM is chosen for its ability to retain information over extended periods, crucial for understanding long-term preferences.
    *   Feature engineering: Create feature vectors representing user state (e.g., “user frequently views hiking boots on weekends,” “user prefers organic produce,” "user is near a running trail").
    *   Contextual embedding: Encode real-time data (location, time, weather) into a vector space.
    *   Preference vector generation: Combine user behavior embedding, contextual embedding, and item catalog data to generate a dynamic preference vector for each user.  This vector represents the user’s likelihood of being interested in different item categories and specific items.

**2. Proactive Suggestion Engine:**

*   **Input:** User preference vector, current browsing context (item category being viewed, search query).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Similarity Calculation: Calculate the cosine similarity between the user's preference vector and the item vectors of items in the catalog. This identifies items that align with the user’s predicted preferences.
    *   Availability Check: Check the real-time availability of highly ranked items.
    *   Predictive Substitution: If a currently viewed or searched item is predicted to become unavailable (based on historical data and current stock levels), proactively suggest a small set (3-5) of highly similar *available* items *before* the user encounters an error message. These suggestions should appear as a subtle “Also consider…” section below the primary item display or search results.
    *   Dynamic Ranking: Continuously update the ranking of suggested items based on user interactions (views, clicks, add-to-cart actions).
    *   Confidence Threshold: Only display proactive suggestions if the confidence level (based on the similarity score and availability prediction) exceeds a predefined threshold. This prevents irrelevant suggestions.

**3.  User Interface Integration:**

*   “Also consider…” section below primary item display/search results.
*   Subtle visual cues (e.g., small icons indicating item availability and/or potential delivery speed).
*   Option for the user to customize the frequency and type of proactive suggestions (e.g., “Show me alternatives when an item is low in stock,” “Suggest items based on my location”).

**Pseudocode (Proactive Suggestion Engine):**

```
function generateProactiveSuggestions(userPreferenceVector, currentItemCategory, userLocation):
  candidateItems = selectItemsInCategory(currentItemCategory) // Filter catalog
  similarityScores = calculateCosineSimilarity(userPreferenceVector, candidateItems)
  availableItems = filterAvailableItems(candidateItems) // Check stock
  rankedItems = sortItemsBySimilarityAndAvailability(similarityScores, availableItems)
  proactiveSuggestions = selectTopNItems(rankedItems, 3) // Top 3 suggestions
  return proactiveSuggestions
```

**Novelty:** The key innovation is the *proactive* nature of the system, shifting from reactive substitution to predictive suggestion based on a dynamically generated preference vector informed by multiple data sources.  Existing systems typically react to unavailability; this anticipates it.  The use of LSTM for modeling user behavior allows for a more nuanced and accurate understanding of preferences over time.
