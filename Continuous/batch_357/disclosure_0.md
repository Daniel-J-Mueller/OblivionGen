## Dynamic Waitlist Swapping & Proactive Service Bundling

**Core Concept:** Extend the waitlist functionality to facilitate *proactive* swaps between users based on predicted service fulfillment timelines and introduce dynamic service bundling based on overlapping preferences while a user is on a waitlist. This leverages the waitlist data to not just manage demand, but actively *optimize* user experience and merchant revenue.

**Specs:**

**1. User Preference & Service Profile Database:**

*   **Data Points:**  Beyond basic service requests, capture granular user preferences (e.g., specific stylist at a salon, dietary restrictions at a restaurant, preferred movie genre, desired equipment at a gym).  Store a 'service profile' linking preferences to service categories.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Implicit (behavioral data from app usage) and explicit (user-defined preferences within the app).  Preference strength weighting (e.g., ‘Must Have’, ‘Nice to Have’).
*   **Database Structure:** Graph database ideal (nodes = users, services, preferences; edges = relationships between them).

**2. Predictive Wait Time Modeling:**

*   **Input Data:** Historical service completion times, current staffing levels (integrated via merchant APIs), real-time foot traffic (estimated via mobile device density/location services), scheduled appointments.
*   **Algorithm:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network trained on historical data to predict service completion times with associated confidence intervals.
*   **Output:** Estimated wait time *and* probability distribution of possible wait times (not just a single number).

**3. Dynamic Waitlist Swapping Engine:**

*   **Trigger:** When a user’s predicted wait time exceeds a defined threshold *and* another user on the same waitlist has a shorter predicted wait time.
*   **Matching Criteria:**
    *   Identical service requests.
    *   Similar preference profiles (weighted similarity score).
    *   User acceptance of ‘Swap’ option (prompted via app).  Defaults to ‘No’ to prevent unwanted swaps.
*   **Swap Mechanism:**  System proposes a swap to both users.  Both must accept for the swap to occur.  Provide a clear justification for the swap (e.g., “Swapping will reduce your wait time by 20 minutes”).
*   **Incentive Layer:** Offer small incentives for accepting swaps (e.g., loyalty points, discount on future service).

**4. Proactive Service Bundling:**

*   **Trigger:**  User remains on waitlist for a defined period.
*   **Analysis:** Identify complementary services offered by nearby merchants, based on user’s service profile and preferences.
*   **Bundling Logic:**
    *   Prioritize services with high user preference scores.
    *   Consider geographic proximity.
    *   Negotiate discounts with merchants for bundled offers.
*   **Presentation:**  Present bundled offers to the user via app, highlighting potential time savings and cost benefits.  Example: "While you wait for a table at [Restaurant], would you like to book a nearby movie ticket with a 10% discount?"

**5. API Integrations:**

*   Merchant POS Systems: Real-time availability and wait time updates.
*   Mapping Services: Geographic proximity calculations.
*   Loyalty Programs: Incentive management.
*   Calendar Apps: Appointment scheduling.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Waitlist Swap):**

```
FUNCTION CheckForSwap(userA, userB):
  waitA = PredictWaitTime(userA)
  waitB = PredictWaitTime(userB)

  IF waitA > waitB AND ServicesMatch(userA, userB) AND PreferenceSimilarity(userA, userB) > threshold:
    promptA = "Another user is available sooner. Swap positions?"
    promptB = "Another user is available later. Swap positions?"
    responseA = PresentPrompt(promptA, userA)
    responseB = PresentPrompt(promptB, userB)

    IF responseA == "Accept" AND responseB == "Accept":
      SwapPositions(userA, userB)
      Return Success
    ELSE:
      Return Failure
  ELSE:
    Return NoMatch
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple waitlist management by actively seeking opportunities to *optimize* the user experience and maximize merchant revenue through dynamic swapping and proactive service bundling, leveraging user preferences and predictive analytics.  The incentive layer encourages user participation.
