## Autonomous Wildlife Deterrent System

**Concept:** Extend the speed/motion detection to proactively deter wildlife *before* they enter a potentially dangerous zone (e.g., roadway, private property). This moves beyond simply *reporting* speeding/motion to *preventing* incidents.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   Illuminated Signal Device (as per base patent - PIR sensor, radar, processor, memory, communication module).
    *   Directional Acoustic Emitter (High-frequency, adjustable intensity).
    *   Low-Resolution Thermal Camera (For nighttime/low-visibility detection - augmenting PIR/Radar).
    *   GPS Module (For geofencing and location-specific behavior).
    *   Solar Power/Rechargeable Battery (Independent Power).
*   **Software/Logic:**
    *   **Motion Profile Analysis:** Algorithm to differentiate between vehicles, pedestrians, and *wildlife* based on speed, size (from thermal camera + radar), and movement patterns. Crucially, learnable models to improve identification over time.
    *   **Geofencing & Zones:** User-defined "safe zones" and "warning zones." Warning zones trigger deterrent sequences.
    *   **Deterrent Sequence:**
        1.  Wildlife detected within warning zone.
        2.  Illuminated Signal Device activates a bright, flashing LED pattern.
        3.  Directional Acoustic Emitter emits a specific frequency/pattern proven to deter the identified species (user-selectable deterrent profiles).
        4.  Event logged and potentially transmitted to a backend server (optional – for monitoring efficacy, species distribution, etc.).
    *   **Adaptive Deterrent:** If initial deterrent fails, intensity/frequency of acoustic emitter increases (within safe limits for wildlife).
    *   **“Do Not Disturb” Mode:** User can disable deterrent functionality for specific periods.
*   **Communication:**
    *   WiFi/Cellular connectivity for remote configuration, firmware updates, and data logging.
    *   API for integration with smart home/security systems.
*   **Hardware Considerations:**
    *   Ruggedized, weatherproof enclosure.
    *   Adjustable mounting system (pole mount, tree mount, etc.).
    *   Tamper-proof design to prevent vandalism/theft.
*   **Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
LOOP:
    motionDetected = detectMotion(PIR, Radar)
    IF motionDetected:
        objectType = analyzeMotionProfile(motionData, ThermalData) //Vehicle, Pedestrian, Wildlife
        IF objectType == "Wildlife":
            IF withinGeofence(location, "WarningZone"):
                activateLEDs()
                emitAcousticDeterrent(speciesProfile)
                logEvent(eventData)
                IF deterrentFailed():
                    increaseDeterrentIntensity()
                    logEvent(increasedIntensityEvent)
    ENDLOOP
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Wildlife crossings (proactively deter animals from entering roadways).
*   Agricultural protection (deter pests from crops).
*   Residential areas (deter deer/other animals from gardens).
*   Airport/Runway safety (deter birds/wildlife from flight paths).
