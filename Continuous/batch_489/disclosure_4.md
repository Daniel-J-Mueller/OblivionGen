**Personalized Predictive Purchase Groups**

**Concept:** Expand the private sharing functionality to leverage AI and create dynamic, predictive “purchase groups” based on inferred preferences, beyond simply those designated by the user. These groups automatically form and dissolve based on purchasing behavior, and shared reviews, with privacy controls managed by the user.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** “Preference Inference Engine” – an AI that analyzes transaction history, product reviews, wishlists, browsing behavior, and potentially, publicly available social media data (with explicit user consent). The engine generates a “preference vector” for each user.
*   **Group Formation:** A “Group Dynamics” module calculates similarity scores between user preference vectors.  When scores exceed a dynamically adjusted threshold, a “Potential Group” is flagged.
*   **Privacy Control – “Visibility Shield”:** Users set granular privacy levels:
    *   *Public*:  Information visible to all users.
    *   *Friends*:  Visible only to explicitly designated friends.
    *   *Groups*:  Visible to users within automatically formed groups (adjustable – user can opt-out of group sharing).
    *   *Private*:  Completely inaccessible.
*   **Dynamic Group Adjustment:** Groups are not static.  As user preferences evolve (tracked by the Preference Inference Engine), group membership is automatically adjusted. Users receive notifications when their group membership changes.
*   **Recommendation Engine Integration:** The system integrates with the existing recommendation engine.  Recommendations are personalized not only by individual preferences but also by the preferences of users within the same groups.
*   **Review Weighting:** Reviews from users within the same groups are given increased weight in personalized recommendations. This assumes that users within similar groups have more trustworthy preferences.
*   **"Ghost Mode"**: Option to temporarily disable group visibility and participate anonymously.

**Pseudocode (Group Formation):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateGroupSimilarity(UserA_PreferenceVector, UserB_PreferenceVector)
    // Calculate cosine similarity between preference vectors
    similarity_score = CosineSimilarity(UserA_PreferenceVector, UserB_PreferenceVector)
    RETURN similarity_score

FUNCTION FormPotentialGroups(UserList, SimilarityThreshold)
    FOR EACH userA IN UserList
        FOR EACH userB IN UserList
            IF userA != userB
                similarity = CalculateGroupSimilarity(userA.PreferenceVector, userB.PreferenceVector)
                IF similarity > SimilarityThreshold
                    CreatePotentialGroup(userA, userB) //Add to group list if it doesn’t exist
                ENDIF
            ENDIF
        ENDFOR
    ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION CreatePotentialGroup(userA, userB)
    IF GroupExists(userA, userB) RETURN
    group = new Group()
    group.addUser(userA)
    group.addUser(userB)
    AddGroupToActiveGroupsList(group)
ENDFUNCTION
```

**User Interface Considerations:**

*   A dedicated “Groups” tab showing active groups and membership.
*   Privacy setting controls within the account profile.
*   Visual cues indicating whether a recommendation is based on individual preferences or group preferences.
*   Options to provide feedback on group relevance.
