## Dynamic Key Rotation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Expand upon the trust-level key distribution by incorporating continuous behavioral authentication *after* initial key provision. This creates a dynamic trust score, influencing key rotation frequency and access privileges.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Keyboard dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure), mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns), touchscreen interactions (swipe angles, pressure), and potentially voice analysis (during authentication attempts, if available).
*   **Data Processing:** Raw data is processed to extract features â€“ mean/standard deviation of typing speed, mouse acceleration variance, dominant swipe angles, etc.  A baseline behavioral profile is established for each authentication endpoint *after* successful initial authentication and key distribution.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  A machine learning model (e.g., autoencoder, one-class SVM) is trained on the baseline data to identify deviations from normal behavior. A 'behavioral trust score' is generated, ranging from 0-1, reflecting the degree of anomaly.

**2. Dynamic Key Rotation Engine:**

*   **Key Pool:** The key distribution host maintains a pool of limited-term authentication keys for each endpoint, pre-generated.
*   **Rotation Trigger:** Key rotation is *not* strictly time-based. Instead, the rotation frequency is determined by the behavioral trust score.
    *   High Trust (0.8-1.0):  Rotation every 30 days.
    *   Medium Trust (0.5-0.8): Rotation every 7 days.
    *   Low Trust (0.2-0.5):  Rotation every 24 hours.
    *   Critical Trust (0.0-0.2): Immediate key revocation, transition to remote authentication.
*   **Rotation Process:** The host securely transmits the next key from the pool to the endpoint, *only* after verifying the behavioral trust score exceeds a minimum threshold.

**3. Access Control Adjustment:**

*   **Tiered Access:** Based on the behavioral trust score, access to sensitive cloud resources can be dynamically adjusted.
    *   High Trust: Full access.
    *   Medium Trust: Access limited to non-critical resources. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforced.
    *   Low Trust: Access restricted to read-only operations. Remote access required for any modifications.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Key Distribution Host

function distributeKey(authEndpoint) {
    trustLevel = determineTrustLevel(authEndpoint)
    if (trustLevel > threshold) {
        key = selectKeyFromPool(authEndpoint)
        transmitKey(authEndpoint, key)
    } else {
        //Initiate remote authentication procedure
    }
}

function determineTrustLevel(authEndpoint) {
    behavioralTrustScore = getBehavioralTrustScore(authEndpoint)
    //Combine Behavioral Trust with Initial Trust Level (from patent)
    combinedTrust = (initialTrustLevel * 0.5) + (behavioralTrustScore * 0.5)
    return combinedTrust
}

function getBehavioralTrustScore(authEndpoint) {
    // Gather behavioral data (typing, mouse, touchscreen)
    behavioralData = collectBehavioralData(authEndpoint)
    // Compare to baseline profile
    anomalyScore = detectAnomaly(behavioralData, authEndpoint.baselineProfile)
    //Convert anomaly score to trust score (0-1)
    trustScore = 1 - anomalyScore //Lower anomaly = higher trust
    return trustScore
}

// Authentication Endpoint (upon login attempt)
collectBehavioralData()
transmitDataToHost()
```

*   Standard cloud computing infrastructure.
*   Secure communication channels (TLS/SSL).
*   Dedicated processing for anomaly detection algorithms (GPU acceleration recommended).

**Software Requirements:**

*   Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Secure key management system.
*   Behavioral data collection agents for various endpoint devices.
*   API for secure communication between endpoint and host.
