## Dynamic Quorum Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

The system augments the existing quorum-based access mechanism with dynamic quorum requirements determined by real-time behavioral biometrics analysis of the requesting user(s). Instead of a static number of signatures required, the system calculates a risk score and adjusts the quorum threshold accordingly.

**II. Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometrics Module:** Continuously collects and analyzes user behavioral data during the authentication/request process. This includes:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure).
    *   Mouse/Touchpad movements (speed, acceleration, patterns).
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, patterns).
    *   Device orientation/movement (if applicable, e.g., mobile devices).
    *   Interaction time with UI elements.
*   **Risk Assessment Engine:**
    *   Utilizes machine learning models (trained on historical user behavioral data) to generate a risk score for each user attempting to initiate or contribute to a quorum request.
    *   Factors considered: Deviation from established user baseline, unusual access times/locations, anomalous interaction patterns, and contextual data.
*   **Dynamic Quorum Manager:**
    *   Receives risk scores from the Risk Assessment Engine.
    *   Adjusts the required quorum threshold *in real-time* based on the collective risk scores of the users involved in the request.
    *   Implements a configurable mapping between risk score ranges and quorum thresholds. (e.g., Low Risk = 2 signatures, Medium Risk = 3 signatures, High Risk = All available signatories).
*   **Existing Quorum Infrastructure:** Integrates seamlessly with the existing quorum-based access mechanism.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **Initiation:** User initiates a request requiring quorum approval.
2.  **Behavioral Capture:** Behavioral Biometrics Module begins capturing user interaction data.
3.  **Risk Assessment:** Risk Assessment Engine analyzes captured data and generates a risk score.
4.  **Dynamic Quorum Calculation:** Dynamic Quorum Manager calculates the required number of signatures based on the userâ€™s risk score, and those of potential signatories.
5.  **Signatory Notification:** Notifications are sent to potential signatories.
6.  **Signature Collection:** Signatures are collected.
7.  **Verification:** System verifies the number of collected signatures against the dynamically calculated quorum threshold.
8.  **Access Granted/Denied:** Access is granted or denied based on verification.

**IV. Pseudocode (Dynamic Quorum Calculation):**

```
function calculateDynamicQuorum(requestorRiskScore, potentialSignatoryRiskScores):
  // Define risk thresholds and corresponding quorum levels
  lowRiskThreshold = 0.2
  mediumRiskThreshold = 0.5
  highRiskThreshold = 0.8

  // Calculate average risk score of potential signatories
  averageSignatoryRiskScore = average(potentialSignatoryRiskScores)

  // Determine base quorum level based on requestor risk
  if requestorRiskScore <= lowRiskThreshold:
    baseQuorum = 1
  else if requestorRiskScore <= mediumRiskThreshold:
    baseQuorum = 2
  else:
    baseQuorum = 3

  // Adjust quorum based on average signatory risk
  if averageSignatoryRiskScore <= lowRiskThreshold:
    quorum = baseQuorum - 1  // Reduce quorum if signatories are low risk
    if quorum < 1:
      quorum = 1
  else if averageSignatoryRiskScore >= highRiskThreshold:
    quorum = baseQuorum + 1 // Increase quorum if signatories are high risk
  else:
    quorum = baseQuorum

  return quorum
```

**V. Advanced Considerations:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:** The machine learning models should continuously learn and adapt to changing user behavior patterns.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement advanced anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious activities.
*   **Privacy:** Ensure user privacy by anonymizing and securely storing behavioral data.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication Integration:** Integrate with existing multi-factor authentication systems for enhanced security.
* **Contextual Awareness**: Incorporate contextual data like location, time of day and network characteristics into the risk assessment.
