## Dynamic Permission Inheritance & Contextual Role Stitching

**Concept:** Expand beyond static role assignments tied directly to workflows to a system where permissions *inherit* based on contextual data *during* workflow execution. This allows for truly fine-grained access control that adapts in real-time, rather than being pre-defined.  Think of it like a permissions ‘lattice’ rather than a rigid hierarchy.  We'll call this system "Chameleon Roles."

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Ingestion Module:**

*   **Input:**  A stream of contextual data. This data should be configurable per workflow and can include:
    *   User attributes (department, security clearance, location).
    *   Data sensitivity labels associated with the data being processed.
    *   Time of day/week.
    *   Network context (internal vs. external).
    *   Device characteristics.
*   **Processing:**  This module normalizes and categorizes incoming contextual data into a structured format.  Utilize a rule-based engine and/or a lightweight ML model for categorization.
*   **Output:** A "Context Vector" - a standardized representation of the current execution context.

**2. Permission Inheritance Engine:**

*   **Core Logic:** A graph database stores "Inheritance Rules".  These rules define how Context Vectors influence permission granting. 
    *   Each rule links a Context Vector pattern (e.g., "Department=Finance AND DataSensitivity=High") to a modification of existing permissions. Modifications include:
        *   **Grant:**  Adds a specific permission.
        *   **Revoke:** Removes a permission.
        *   **Elevate:** Increases the scope of a permission (e.g., read-only -> read-write).
        *   **Constrain:** Limits a permission (e.g., access only to a subset of data).
*   **Dynamic Permission Assembly:**
    1.  Initial Role: The workflow starts with a baseline role (as defined in the original patent).
    2.  Contextual Evaluation: The Contextual Data Ingestion Module generates the Context Vector.
    3.  Rule Matching: The Permission Inheritance Engine traverses the Inheritance Rules, matching the Context Vector against rule patterns.
    4.  Permission Modification:  The engine applies the corresponding permission modifications to the baseline role, generating a dynamic, context-aware role.

**3. Role Stitching Service**

*   **Multi-Workflow Context:** Allow permissions to ‘stitch’ across multiple workflows.  If a user initiates Workflow A, which then triggers Workflow B, the permissions derived in Workflow A can be passed along (with potential modifications) to Workflow B.  This creates a more seamless and secure user experience.
*   **Temporary Role Elevation:** Facilitate temporary permission elevations based on specific workflow actions. For example, a user might need elevated access to a resource only for a short period while performing a specific task within a workflow. The system automatically revokes the elevated permissions once the task is complete.
*   **Workflow-Agnostic Permission Management:** Decouple permission definitions from individual workflows. Create reusable permission ‘building blocks’ that can be applied to multiple workflows, simplifying permission management and ensuring consistency.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Role Assembly):**

```
function assembleDynamicRole(baselineRole, contextVector):
  dynamicRole = copy(baselineRole)  // Start with the baseline

  inheritanceRules = queryGraphDB(contextVector)  // Get matching rules

  for rule in inheritanceRules:
    if rule.action == "Grant":
      dynamicRole.permissions.add(rule.permission)
    elif rule.action == "Revoke":
      dynamicRole.permissions.remove(rule.permission)
    elif rule.action == "Elevate":
      // Modify existing permission scope
      for permission in dynamicRole.permissions:
        if permission == rule.permission:
          permission.scope = rule.newScope
    elif rule.action == "Constrain":
      // Apply constraints to permission
      for permission in dynamicRole.permissions:
        if permission == rule.permission:
          permission.constraints.add(rule.constraint)

  return dynamicRole
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Context Vector:** { "user.department": "Finance", "data.sensitivity": "High", "time.hour": 14 }
*   **Inheritance Rule:** { "context": { "user.department": "Finance", "data.sensitivity": "High" }, "action": "Grant", "permission": "access.sensitive.data" }

This system allows for an unprecedented level of flexibility and control over access permissions, adapting to the ever-changing context of workflow execution. It moves beyond simple role-based access control to a truly dynamic and context-aware security model.
