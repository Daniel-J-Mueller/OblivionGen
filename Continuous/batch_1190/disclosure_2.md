## Dynamic Authorization Profiles via Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system for creating and applying authorization profiles based on continuous behavioral biometric analysis of user interactions, overlaid on top of existing authentication mechanisms.

**Core Concept:** Move beyond static permissions (e.g., "read access to database X") and instead define authorization dynamically based on *how* a user interacts with a system. This dramatically increases security and reduces false positives.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometric Engine:** This module continuously collects data points relating to user behavior. This includes:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure).
    *   Mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns, frequently visited areas).
    *   Touchscreen interactions (pressure, swipe speed, common gestures).
    *   Scroll behavior (speed, patterns).
    *   Application usage patterns (frequency, duration, sequence).
    *   Network traffic patterns (timing, volume, destination).
*   **Baseline Profile Generator:** This component establishes a baseline behavioral profile for each user during an initial training period. This profile is a statistical representation of the userâ€™s normal behavior across all tracked data points.
*   **Anomaly Detection Module:** This module continuously compares real-time user behavior against the established baseline profile. It utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection autoencoders, one-class SVM) to identify deviations from the norm.
*   **Dynamic Authorization Manager:** This component adjusts user access permissions in real-time based on the output of the Anomaly Detection Module. It can:
    *   Increase security by temporarily restricting access if anomalous behavior is detected.
    *   Grant additional privileges if the user exhibits highly confident, normal behavior.
    *   Trigger multi-factor authentication challenges if the anomaly score exceeds a threshold.
*   **Risk Scoring Engine:** Calculates a composite risk score based on anomaly detection, user history, and contextual factors (e.g., time of day, location, accessed resources).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Authorization Manager):**

```
FUNCTION adjustAccess(user, resource, operation, anomalyScore, riskScore):
  IF anomalyScore > threshold_high:
    // High anomaly - restrict access
    DENY ACCESS
    TRIGGER MFA
  ELSE IF anomalyScore > threshold_medium AND riskScore > risk_threshold_high:
    // Medium anomaly + high risk - request additional context
    REQUEST ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (e.g. location verification)
  ELSE IF anomalyScore < threshold_low AND riskScore < risk_threshold_low:
    // Low anomaly + low risk - grant full access
    GRANT ACCESS
  ELSE:
    // Moderate risk - grant limited access
    GRANT LIMITED ACCESS
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Integration with existing system:** This system is designed to overlay on top of existing authentication infrastructure. It *enhances* security, rather than replacing it. The system relies on the existing authentication flow to establish user identity, then uses behavioral biometrics to dynamically adjust access permissions.

**Scalability:** The Behavioral Biometric Engine and Anomaly Detection Module can be deployed as a distributed microservice architecture to handle large numbers of users and requests. The system should be designed to be horizontally scalable.

**Data Privacy:** All behavioral biometric data should be anonymized and encrypted to protect user privacy. Data retention policies should be clearly defined and communicated to users. The system should comply with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
