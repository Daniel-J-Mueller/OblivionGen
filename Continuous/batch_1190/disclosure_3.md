## Dynamic DNS-Based Geolocation & Predictive Caching

**Concept:** Expand upon the DNS-level redirection in the provided patent to include *predictive* content caching based on user movement patterns *before* the DNS query even resolves. This goes beyond simple geolocation to anticipate where a user is *going*, not just where they are.

**Specs:**

1.  **Client-Side Agent:** A lightweight agent embedded in user devices (browser extension, mobile SDK) tracks user movement data (with explicit consent, anonymized). This data isn't precise location, but rather directional vectors (e.g., “traveling North on Highway 101,” “moving towards downtown,” “stationary at a known event location”).

2.  **Movement Pattern Database:** A centralized database storing anonymized movement patterns.  Patterns aren't individual user paths, but aggregate trends – "80% of users traveling North on Highway 101 between 7-9 AM are heading towards the City Center office park."

3.  **Predictive DNS Resolver:**  A modified DNS resolver (integrated into the CDN's DNS infrastructure) intercepts DNS queries.

4.  **Prediction Engine:**  This engine analyzes:
    *   Client’s recent movement data (from the client-side agent).
    *   Aggregate movement patterns in the database matching the client’s current trajectory.
    *   Historical CDN request data for predicted destination.

5.  **Pre-emptive Caching:** Based on the prediction, the system *proactively* caches content at CDN edge nodes *along the predicted path and at the predicted destination*. This doesn’t necessarily mean *all* content, but the most likely requests based on historical data (e.g., map tiles, images, frequently accessed webpages).

6.  **Dynamic Weighting:**  The prediction engine assigns a confidence score to the prediction. This score influences the weight given to pre-cached content.  If the prediction is highly confident, pre-cached content is prioritized.  If the confidence is low, the system falls back to standard CDN caching.

**Pseudocode (Predictive DNS Resolver):**

```
function resolveDNS(dnsQuery):
  clientIP = dnsQuery.sourceIP
  movementData = getMovementData(clientIP)  // Retrieve from agent (if available)
  predictedDestination = predictDestination(movementData) //Use machine learning model trained on aggregated patterns
  confidenceScore = calculateConfidence(predictedDestination)

  if confidenceScore > threshold:
    // Prioritize pre-cached content at predicted destination
    edgeNode = selectEdgeNode(predictedDestination)
    dnsResponse = createDnsResponse(edgeNode)
    dnsResponse.priority = confidenceScore * 100  //Higher score = higher priority

  else:
    // Standard CDN resolution
    edgeNode = selectBestEdgeNode(dnsQuery)
    dnsResponse = createDnsResponse(edgeNode)

  return dnsResponse
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `MovementData`: `{ direction: number, speed: number, timestamp: timestamp }`
*   `PredictedDestination`: `{ latitude: number, longitude: number, confidence: number }`

**Hardware Implications:**

*   Increased storage requirements at CDN edge nodes to accommodate pre-cached content.
*   Potentially requiring dedicated processing units (GPUs/TPUs) for the prediction engine.
