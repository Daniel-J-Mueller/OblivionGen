## Adaptive Compression Granularity via Neural Architecture Search

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:** Dynamically determine the optimal compression granularity (layer-wise, block-wise, channel-wise, etc.) *during* training, using a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) strategy guided by reinforcement learning, and integrated with the existing compression policy training framework.

**Components:**

1.  **Compression Granularity Controller (CGC):**  A recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.  The input to the LSTM is the current layer’s feature map statistics (mean, variance, entropy). The output is a vector specifying the compression method *and* granularity for that layer. Possible compression methods include pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and low-rank factorization, with granularity options ranging from full-layer application to individual channel/block manipulation.

2.  **Compression Policy Trainer (CPT):**  Existing RL-based system (from provided patent). CPT receives the compression profile (determined by CGC) and evaluates the performance of the compressed model. The reward signal is generated based on metrics like accuracy, model size, and inference speed.

3.  **NAS Search Space Definition:** A discrete search space defining all possible compression method/granularity combinations.  Example:

    *   Method: {Prune, Quantize, Distill, Factorize, None}
    *   Granularity: {Layer, Block, Channel}
    *   Prune Specifics: {Sparsity Level: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]}
    *   Quantize Specifics: {Bit Depth: [8, 4, 2]}

4.  **Reward Shaping:**  Augment the standard reward function with a “complexity penalty” based on the diversity of compression techniques used across layers.  Encourage the CGC to explore varied compression strategies while still maintaining performance. This prevents homogenization of compression.

5.  **Shared Execution State Infrastructure:** Integrate with existing resource sharing mechanisms (mentioned in patent claim 11) to accelerate performance evaluation of different compression configurations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# Initialization
CGC = LSTM()
CPT = CompressionPolicyTrainer()
SearchSpace = DefineCompressionSearchSpace()
RewardShapingParams = {complexity_penalty_weight: 0.1}

# Training Loop
For epoch in range(num_epochs):
    For layer in range(num_layers):
        # CGC predicts compression method/granularity for current layer
        compression_config = CGC.predict(layer_feature_stats)

        # Apply compression to layer
        compressed_layer = ApplyCompression(layer, compression_config)

        # Evaluate compressed model performance
        performance_metrics = EvaluateModel(compressed_model)

        # Calculate reward (performance + complexity penalty)
        reward = CalculateReward(performance_metrics, complexity_penalty_weight)

        # Update CGC based on reward
        CGC.update(reward)
    # Save the best compression profile found so far
    SaveCompressionProfile(CGC)
```

**Innovation Details:**

The core innovation lies in *dynamically* discovering the optimal level of compression granularity.  Traditional methods apply a uniform compression strategy across the entire network. This system learns to adapt the compression technique to the unique characteristics of each layer, maximizing compression while minimizing performance loss. The integration of NAS with the existing RL framework allows for automated discovery of these optimal strategies, reducing the need for manual hyperparameter tuning. The 'complexity penalty' encourages architectural diversity, potentially leading to more robust and generalizable compression profiles.
