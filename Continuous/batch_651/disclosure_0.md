## Adaptive Key Derivation via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the multi-invocation key derivation process to incorporate real-time biometric data from the authenticating party. This introduces a dynamic, continuously evolving key, making compromise significantly harder and enabling granular access control based on physiological state.

**Specs:**

**1. Biometric Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrated suite of non-invasive biometric sensors. Baseline: Electrocardiogram (ECG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and subtle facial muscle movement tracking (via micro-cameras or infrared). Optional: Brainwave (EEG) monitoring for advanced security/access levels.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Raw sensor data is filtered, amplified, and digitized. Noise reduction algorithms employed to minimize false positives.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Key physiological features are extracted: heart rate variability (HRV), GSR peak amplitude/frequency, micro-expression patterns. These features form the "bio-signature."

**2. Dynamic Key Derivation Engine:**

*   **Seed Credential:** Standard shared secret credential (as per the base patent).
*   **Bio-Signature Incorporation:** During *each* invocation of the key derivation function, the current bio-signature is incorporated as an additional input. This isn't the raw data, but a transformed representation (e.g., a vector of feature values).
*   **Derivation Function:** The core derivation function remains hash-based (e.g., HMAC), but modified to accept the bio-signature vector as input.  
    *   `Key = HMAC(SeedCredential + PreviousKey + BioSignature, Salt)`
    *   `PreviousKey` is the key derived from the prior invocation.
    *   `Salt` is a randomly generated value for each invocation to prevent replay attacks.
*   **Invocation Frequency:**  Configurable.  Range: 1 second to 60 seconds.  Faster invocation rates increase security but also processing overhead.
*   **Key Lifetime:**  Each derived key has a limited lifespan (configurable).  After expiry, a new key is generated using the updated bio-signature.
*   **Drift Detection:**  Algorithm to monitor bio-signature changes.  Significant deviations trigger a re-authentication process or access restriction.

**3. Adaptive Access Control:**

*   **Physiological State Profiles:**  Define access permissions based on specific physiological states.
    *   Example: Access to sensitive data only granted when the user is in a "calm" state (verified by HRV and GSR metrics).
    *   Example:  Increased authentication requirements (e.g., multi-factor authentication) when the user exhibits signs of stress or fatigue.
*   **Dynamic Permission Adjustment:**  Access permissions automatically adjusted based on the user’s real-time physiological state.
*   **Emergency Override:**  Pre-defined override mechanisms for situations where biometric data is unavailable or unreliable (e.g., medical emergency).

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side Module:** Resides on the authenticating device (laptop, smartphone, wearable). Responsible for biometric data acquisition, preprocessing, and transmission.
*   **Server-Side Module:**  Responsible for key derivation, access control, and audit logging.
*   **Secure Communication:** All communication between client and server is encrypted using TLS/SSL.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```
function deriveKey(seedCredential, previousKey, bioSignature, salt):
  // Combine inputs
  combinedInput = seedCredential + previousKey + bioSignature + salt

  // Apply HMAC
  key = HMAC(combinedInput)

  return key
```

**Innovation Points:**

*   **Continuous Authentication:**  The key is constantly evolving, making compromise significantly more difficult.
*   **Biometric-Driven Access Control:**  Permissions are dynamically adjusted based on the user’s physiological state, enhancing security and usability.
*   **Increased Security:**  The combination of shared secret, biometric data, and continuous key derivation creates a multi-layered security system.
*   **Potential for Advanced Use Cases:**  Personalized security profiles, health-aware authentication, and emotion-based access control.
