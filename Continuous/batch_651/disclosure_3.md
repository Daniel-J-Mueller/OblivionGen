## Personalized Acoustic Scene Adaptation for ASR

**Concept:** Extend user-specific ASR models beyond voice characteristics to encompass acoustic environments. The system learns and adapts to the typical soundscapes associated with a user, improving transcription accuracy in noisy or complex environments.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Acoustic Scene Profiling Module:**
    *   Continuously record ambient audio data (with user permission) via the device microphone during ASR usage.
    *   Employ signal processing techniques (e.g., FFT, spectrogram analysis, MFCC) to extract acoustic features representing the soundscape.
    *   Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models) to identify dominant acoustic scenes (e.g., “home,” “office,” “car,” “restaurant”).
    *   Associate these scenes with timestamps and user location data (if available).
    *   Maintain a user-specific “Acoustic Scene Profile” representing the frequency and duration of exposure to different scenes.

2.  **Scene-Adaptive ASR Model:**
    *   Develop a modular ASR model architecture.  Base model handles core speech recognition.  Scene Adaptation Modules (SAMs) modify base model output based on the current acoustic scene.
    *   Each SAM is trained on audio data captured within a specific acoustic scene.  Training data includes speech and ambient noise representative of that scene.
    *   During ASR processing:
        *   Real-time acoustic scene classification using the microphone input.
        *   Selection of the appropriate SAM based on the classified scene.
        *   SAM applies learned transformations to the ASR feature vectors before feeding them to the core ASR model.  Transformations can include noise reduction, spectral shaping, or feature weighting.

3.  **Dynamic Model Blending:**
    *   Implement a blending mechanism that combines outputs from multiple SAMs based on confidence scores and historical usage patterns.
    *   If acoustic scene classification is uncertain, the system dynamically weights contributions from multiple SAMs to maximize transcription accuracy.
    *   The blending weights are learned over time based on user feedback and ASR performance metrics.

4.  **Federated Learning for Scene Data:**
    *   To expand the dataset of acoustic scenes without compromising user privacy, employ federated learning.
    *   Local acoustic scene profiles are trained on user devices.
    *   Only model updates (gradients) are sent to a central server, not the raw audio data.
    *   The central server aggregates the updates to improve the global acoustic scene model.
    *   The improved model is distributed back to user devices.

**Pseudocode (Scene-Adaptive ASR Processing):**

```
function processAudio(audioData, userProfile):
  scene = classifyScene(audioData)
  sam = selectSAM(scene, userProfile)
  features = extractFeatures(audioData)
  adaptedFeatures = sam.apply(features)
  asrOutput = baseASRModel.process(adaptedFeatures)
  return asrOutput
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Device with microphone
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time signal processing and model inference
*   Storage for storing acoustic scene profiles and SAMs

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large corpus of speech data with associated acoustic scene labels
*   User-specific acoustic scene profiles
*   User feedback on ASR performance in different environments
