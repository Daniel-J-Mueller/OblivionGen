## Adaptive Multi-Resolution Time Series Decomposition with Learned Basis Functions

**Concept:** Expand the forecasting capability by decomposing the input time series into multiple resolution levels *before* feeding it to the RNN, and learn the basis functions for this decomposition *within* the RNN training process. This allows the model to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends more effectively, and adapt to varying signal complexities.

**Specs:**

1.  **Decomposition Layer:** Implement a trainable decomposition layer *before* the RNN. This layer will take the raw time series as input and output a set of time series representing different resolution levels.  The number of resolution levels ('N') will be a hyperparameter.
2.  **Learned Basis Functions:** Each resolution level is represented by a weighted sum of learned basis functions. These basis functions are *not* pre-defined (e.g., wavelets, Fourier basis). Instead, they are parameterized and learned *during* RNN training, alongside the RNN weights.  Parameterization could use spline control points, or a small set of learned filter coefficients.
3.  **RNN Input:** The outputs of the decomposition layer (the coefficients for each resolution level) *and* the raw time series itself are fed into the RNN.  This provides the RNN with both decomposed and raw information, allowing it to learn how best to utilize each.
4.  **Loss Function Modification:** The existing CRPS loss function remains the primary loss. Add a regularization term to the loss that penalizes the complexity of the learned basis functions (e.g., total variation of spline control points, L1 regularization on filter coefficients). This encourages smoother, more interpretable basis functions.
5.  **Architecture:**
    *   **Input Layer:** Raw time series (length T).
    *   **Decomposition Layer:**
        *   Output: N sets of coefficients (each of length T) + Raw Time Series
        *   Each set of coefficients is derived from a weighted sum of the basis functions.
    *   **RNN Layer:** (LSTM or GRU) - Input size = N\*T + T
    *   **Projection/MLP:** (as in the original patent) â€“ Outputs parameters for the quantile function.
    *   **Output Layer:**  Quantile function parameters.

**Pseudocode (Decomposition Layer):**

```python
def decompose_time_series(time_series, num_levels, basis_functions):
    """
    Decomposes a time series into multiple resolution levels using learned basis functions.

    Args:
        time_series:  1D numpy array representing the time series.
        num_levels:  Integer representing the number of resolution levels.
        basis_functions:  Learned basis functions (e.g., a list of spline control points).

    Returns:
        A list of decomposed time series (one for each resolution level) + the original time series.
    """

    decomposed_series = []
    for i in range(num_levels):
        # Calculate the weighted sum of basis functions for this level.
        # Weights are learned during training.
        level_series = np.zeros_like(time_series)
        for t in range(len(time_series)):
            level_series[t] = sum([weight[i] * basis_functions[i](t) for i in range(len(weight))]) #example implementation with weights and basis functions
        decomposed_series.append(level_series)

    decomposed_series.append(time_series) # Add the original time series

    return decomposed_series
```

**Training Considerations:**

*   Initialize the weights for the basis function coefficients randomly.
*   Use a learning rate schedule to fine-tune the basis function parameters.
*   Experiment with different numbers of resolution levels ('N').
*   Regularization strength needs to be tuned to prevent overfitting.
