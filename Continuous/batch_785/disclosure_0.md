## Dynamic Configuration Mutation & A/B Testing

**Concept:** Extend the configuration system to support live mutation of configuration parameters *during* runtime, coupled with automated A/B testing of these mutations against real-world transaction streams. This goes beyond simply swapping configurations; it's about actively *evolving* the logic based on observed performance.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Mutation Engine:**
    *   A dedicated module responsible for applying parameterized mutations to configuration values.
    *   Mutation types:
        *   **Value Swapping:** Replace a value with another predefined value.
        *   **Arithmetic Modification:** Add/subtract a small random value (within defined bounds) to numeric configuration values.
        *   **Conditional Logic Flipping:**  Toggle the truthiness of a boolean condition within conditional logic.
        *   **Parameter Re-weighting:**  Adjust the weighting of parameters within a calculation.
        *   **Function Substitution:** Replace a function call with a slightly altered version (e.g., different algorithm with similar output).
    *   Mutation parameters are themselves configurable (mutation type, range of modification, probability of application).

2.  **A/B Testing Framework:**
    *   Transaction stream splitting: Incoming requests are randomly (or based on user/device attributes) divided into control and experiment groups.
    *   Configuration assignment:  Control group receives the baseline configuration. Experiment group receives a configuration with a randomly applied mutation (selected based on predefined testing goals).
    *   Key Performance Indicator (KPI) tracking:  Monitor relevant KPIs (transaction success rate, latency, error rate, revenue) for both groups.
    *   Statistical analysis:  Employ statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests) to determine if observed differences in KPIs between groups are statistically significant.
    *   Automated rollback: If a mutation causes a significant performance degradation, automatically roll back to the baseline configuration.
    *   Configuration commit:  If a mutation results in a statistically significant performance improvement, automatically commit the mutated configuration as the new baseline.

3.  **Configuration Versioning & History:**
    *   Maintain a complete version history of all configurations, including mutations and performance metrics.
    *   Enable easy comparison of different configuration versions.
    *   Support rolling back to any previous configuration version.

4.  **Risk Management:**
    *   Circuit Breaker: Implement a circuit breaker to automatically disable a mutated configuration if it causes a critical error.
    *   Canary Release: Gradually roll out mutated configurations to a small subset of users before deploying them to the entire population.
    *   Simulated Testing:  Prior to live deployment, test mutated configurations against a simulated transaction stream.

**Pseudocode (Mutation Engine):**

```
function applyMutation(configuration, mutationParameters):
  mutationType = mutationParameters.type
  mutationRange = mutationParameters.range

  if mutationType == "valueSwapping":
    newValue = selectRandomValue(mutationRange)
    configuration.setValue(newValue)
  elif mutationType == "arithmeticModification":
    randomValue = generateRandomValue(mutationRange)
    configuration.setValue(configuration.getValue() + randomValue)
  elif mutationType == "conditionalLogicFlipping":
    configuration.flipCondition()
  # ... other mutation types ...

  return configuration
```

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   Integration with existing configuration management system.
*   Scalability to handle high transaction volumes.
*   Security to prevent unauthorized configuration changes.
*   Monitoring and alerting to detect performance issues.
