## Dynamic Pricing Mirroring with Real-Time Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend price parity monitoring into a proactive, dynamic pricing system. Instead of simply *detecting* violations, the system actively *adjusts* the third-party seller’s price on the retailer’s platform to *mirror* the lowest price found across all monitored channels, with configurable rules governing acceptable deviations and adjustment speed.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time access to monitored sales channels (retailer platform, third-party websites, APIs).
    *   Product catalog with unique identifiers.
    *   Configurable list of competing sellers/channels.
*   **Price Aggregation Module:**
    *   Continuously scans designated sales channels for price data on identified products.
    *   Normalizes price data (currency conversion, shipping costs).
    *   Identifies the lowest currently offered price.
*   **Pricing Rule Engine:**
    *   **Mirroring Mode:** The primary mode. Sets the third-party seller’s price on the retailer platform *equal* to the lowest identified price.
    *   **Deviation Tolerance:** Configurable percentage or fixed amount allowing the third-party price to be slightly above the lowest price (e.g., to account for slight feature differences or preferred service).
    *   **Adjustment Speed:**
        *   *Instantaneous:* Price adjusts immediately upon detecting a new lowest price.
        *   *Delayed:* Price adjusts after a configurable delay (e.g., to avoid price fluctuations or trigger a confirmation step).
        *   *Incremental:* Price adjusts in small increments over a set period.
    *   **Floor Price:** A minimum acceptable price that prevents the system from driving prices below a certain level.
    *   **Competitor Override:**  Allows manually setting a different price for a specific competitor.
*   **Automated Price Adjustment Module:**
    *   Communicates with the retailer’s platform API to update the third-party seller’s price.
    *   Logs all price changes, including the source of the price change, the time of the change, and the previous/new prices.
*   **Alerting System:**
    *   Notifies administrators of unusual price fluctuations, significant price drops, or errors in the system.
*   **Data Visualization Dashboard:**
    *   Displays real-time price data, price trends, and system performance metrics.
*   **API Access:**
    *   Provides an API for integrating with other systems, such as inventory management or marketing automation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  for each product in product_catalog {
    lowest_price = get_lowest_price(product, monitored_channels)
    current_price = get_current_price(product, retailer_platform)

    if (lowest_price != current_price) {
      new_price = calculate_new_price(lowest_price, current_price, deviation_tolerance)

      if (new_price != current_price) {
        update_price(product, new_price, retailer_platform)
        log_price_change(product, current_price, new_price)
      }
    }
  }
  sleep(configurable_interval)
}

function get_lowest_price(product, channels) {
  lowest = infinity
  for each channel in channels {
    price = get_price_from_channel(product, channel)
    if (price < lowest) {
      lowest = price
    }
  }
  return lowest
}

function calculate_new_price(lowest_price, current_price, tolerance) {
    if (current_price > (lowest_price * (1 + tolerance))) {
        return lowest_price
    } else {
        return current_price
    }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Automated price competitiveness.
*   Increased sales volume.
*   Enhanced customer perception of value.
*   Reduced manual price monitoring effort.
*   Real-time responsiveness to market changes.
