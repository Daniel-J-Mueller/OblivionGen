## Modular, Bio-Integrated Power Adapter System

**Concept:** A power adapter system that isn't a single unit, but a distributed network of energy harvesting and storage modules that conform *to* the device being powered, rather than the device conforming to the adapter. This moves beyond simply miniaturization to a fundamentally different paradigm.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** Base module: 10mm x 10mm x 3mm.  Expansion modules: 10mm x 5mm x 3mm, and 5mm x 5mm x 3mm.  These are standardized sizes for interconnectivity.
*   **Interconnect:** Magnetic 'snap-and-charge' connection. Each module face has micro-magnets and conductive pads aligned for automatic connection, enabling daisy-chaining or branching configurations.  Polarity is encoded in magnet arrangement.  Connection strength: 10N minimum.
*   **Energy Harvesting:**  Each module incorporates a miniature piezoelectric generator utilizing flex and vibration. Target output: 10mW per module, optimized for low-frequency movement.  Also includes miniature thermoelectric generator (TEG) for waste heat recovery. Target output: 5mW per module, delta-T of 10C.
*   **Energy Storage:**  Each module contains a micro-supercapacitor (100µF, 3.7V) for immediate power buffering.  Larger modules may incorporate micro-solid-state batteries (50mAh, 3.7V).
*   **Communication:**  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh network for module communication and power distribution optimization.  Each module reports energy harvested, stored, and demand. Algorithm dynamically routes power.
*   **Material:** Biocompatible, flexible polymer housing with embedded conductive traces.  Modules are designed to be conformable and non-damaging if compressed or bent.
*   **Form Factor Adaptability:** Modules can be arranged in any configuration to match the surface area of the powered device.  Adhesive backing enables temporary or semi-permanent attachment.
*   **Power Output:**  Configurable output voltage (3.3V, 5V, 9V, 12V) via BLE control. Total system output capacity: scalable to 50W based on number of modules.

**Pseudocode (Power Distribution Algorithm):**

```
// Module reports: harvestedEnergy, storedEnergy, demand
// Network topology: graph of connected modules

function distributePower(network, deviceDemand) {
  // 1. Identify modules with excess storedEnergy
  excessModules = network.filter(module => module.storedEnergy > module.demand)

  // 2. Identify modules with insufficient storedEnergy
  deficientModules = network.filter(module => module.storedEnergy < module.demand)

  // 3.  Iterate through deficient modules
  for each module in deficientModules {
    // Find nearest excess module with sufficient energy
    nearestExcess = findNearest(module, excessModules)

    // If found:
    if (nearestExcess != null) {
      // Transfer energy via shortest path in network graph
      transferEnergy(module, nearestExcess, (module.demand - module.storedEnergy))
    } else {
      // Device enters low power mode to conserve energy
      device.enterLowPowerMode()
    }
  }
}
```

**Innovation Focus:**  Moving from a centralized power supply to a distributed, adaptive energy network integrated *with* the powered device. This system can effectively 'grow' with the device’s power needs and potentially harvest energy from the device's natural movements and thermal output.
