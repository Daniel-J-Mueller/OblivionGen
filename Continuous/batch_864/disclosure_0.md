## Dynamic Content Request Shaping & Predictive Bidding

**Concept:** Expand the immediate auction trigger beyond keyword matching. Introduce a system where the search engine *actively shapes* the content request (search query) *before* sending it to advertisers, based on user profiles and predicted intent, and then auctions on this shaped request. This allows for more granular bidding and potentially higher revenue.

**Specs:**

**1. User Profile Integration:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with existing user data platforms (if available). Gather data points: demographics, browsing history, purchase history, location, time of day, device type.  If no prior data exists, establish a 'seed' profile based on initial interaction – e.g., time of day, location.
*   **Intent Modeling:** Employ a machine learning model to predict user intent based on the initial search query *and* the user profile.  This model outputs a weighted list of potential user intents (e.g., "research," "purchase," "local information," "entertainment").
*   **Query Expansion/Refinement:**  Based on predicted intent, the search engine *modifies* the original search query.  
    *   **Expansion:** Add relevant terms based on intent (e.g., if intent is "purchase" and query is "running shoes," add terms like "cheap," "discount," "sale," "best," or brand names).
    *   **Refinement:**  Remove ambiguous terms or add clarifying modifiers (e.g., if query is "jaguar," add "car," "animal," or "football team" based on user history or location).
    *   **Query Vector:** Represent the shaped query as a high-dimensional vector, capturing semantic meaning beyond keyword matching.

**2. Dynamic Bid Solicitation:**

*   **Shaped Query Transmission:** Transmit the *shaped query vector* (not just keywords) to advertisers.
*   **Bid Request Payload:**  Include the following in the bid request:
    *   Shaped Query Vector
    *   Original Query
    *   User Profile Summary (anonymized/aggregated)
    *   Predicted Intent Score (likelihood of each intent)
    *   Current High Bid (for the shaped query)
*   **Bid Response Payload:**  Advertisers respond with:
    *   Bid Amount
    *   Advertising Message
    *   Targeted Intent (which predicted intent they are bidding on) – *crucial for granularity*

**3. Auction & Ranking:**

*   **Intent-Specific Auctions:** Separate auctions for each predicted intent. This prevents broad keywords from dominating bids on more specific intents.
*   **Bid Scoring:** Score bids based on:
    *   Bid Amount
    *   Relevance Score (similarity between ad message and shaped query vector, weighted by targeted intent)
    *   User Profile Match (how well the ad message aligns with the user's profile)
*   **Ad Selection:** Select the highest-scoring ad for each intent. Display multiple ads (one per intent) or combine them based on a ranking algorithm.

**4. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// On Search Request Received
function processSearchRequest(user, query) {
  userProfile = getUserProfile(user)
  predictedIntents = predictUserIntents(query, userProfile)
  shapedQuery = shapeQuery(query, predictedIntents)
  
  // Send Dynamic Bid Solicitations
  for each intent in predictedIntents {
    sendBidSolicitation(shapedQuery, intent)
  }

  // Receive Bids and Select Ads
  bids = receiveBids()
  selectedAds = selectAds(bids, shapedQuery, predictedIntents)

  // Generate Search Results with Ads
  searchResults = generateSearchResults(shapedQuery)
  finalResponse = combineResultsAndAds(searchResults, selectedAds)
  
  return finalResponse
}
```

**Novelty:**  Current systems primarily react to keyword matches. This system proactively *shapes* the query and auctions on the resulting refined request, enabling more targeted advertising and potentially increased revenue. It moves beyond simple keyword bidding to intent-driven bidding, adding a layer of sophistication. The intent-specific auction mechanism prevents dilution of bids and allows for nuanced targeting.
