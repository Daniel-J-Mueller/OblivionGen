## Adaptive Query Plan Stitching with Learned Cost Models

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic plan selection described in the patent by introducing a system that *stitches together* execution paths utilizing both code generation/compilation *and* DSL interpretation *within a single query plan*.  The selection isn’t binary (compile OR interpret), but granular – allowing sections of the plan to be executed using whichever method is *currently* most efficient, learned through continuous monitoring.

**Specification:**

**1. Components:**

*   **Plan Stitcher:** A module responsible for breaking down the initial query plan into “execution segments”.  Segment granularity is configurable (e.g., individual joins, aggregations, filters).
*   **Cost Model Learner:** A system that continuously monitors the execution time of each execution segment under both compilation and DSL interpretation.  It maintains a learned cost model for each segment, factoring in data characteristics (cardinality, data types, distribution) and system load.  This is a time-series database containing the learned cost for each execution segment for each combination of data characteristic and system load.
*   **Execution Dispatcher:**  Directs each execution segment to either the Code Generation Engine or the DSL Interpreter, based on the real-time cost estimate from the Cost Model Learner.
*   **Code Generation Engine:** (Existing component - compiles query segments into executable code).
*   **DSL Interpreter:** (Existing component - interprets query segments using pre-compiled executors).
*   **Dynamic Profiler:** Monitors the execution of each segment and feeds performance metrics (latency, CPU usage, memory allocation) back to the Cost Model Learner.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Query Received:** The database system receives a query and generates an initial query plan.
2.  **Plan Segmentation:** The Plan Stitcher divides the plan into execution segments.
3.  **Cost Estimation:** For each segment, the Cost Model Learner queries its learned cost model, factoring in current data characteristics and system load. This returns an estimated execution time for both compilation and DSL interpretation.
4.  **Dispatch Decision:** The Execution Dispatcher compares the estimated execution times and dispatches the segment to the cheaper execution path (Code Generation Engine or DSL Interpreter).
5.  **Execution:** The segment is executed.
6.  **Profiling & Learning:** The Dynamic Profiler monitors execution and feeds performance data back to the Cost Model Learner. The Cost Model Learner updates its model to improve future cost estimations.

**3. Pseudocode (Cost Model Learner Update):**

```pseudocode
function updateCostModel(segmentID, dataCharacteristics, systemLoad, executionTime, executionMethod) {
  // Fetch existing cost estimate for segmentID, dataCharacteristics, systemLoad
  existingCost = getCost(segmentID, dataCharacteristics, systemLoad)

  // Calculate a weighted average of the existing cost and the new execution time
  // (e.g., 70% new execution time, 30% existing cost)
  newCost = (0.7 * executionTime) + (0.3 * existingCost)

  // Store the updated cost in the cost model database
  storeCost(segmentID, dataCharacteristics, systemLoad, newCost)
}
```

**4. Data Characteristics (Example):**

*   Cardinality (estimated number of rows)
*   Data types of involved columns
*   Data skew (distribution of values)
*   Presence of NULL values
*   Presence of unique keys

**5. System Load (Example):**

*   CPU utilization
*   Memory pressure
*   Disk I/O
*   Network latency

**Innovation:**  This differs from the patent by moving beyond a simple binary choice for the entire plan.  It’s a *fine-grained* optimization, allowing the system to adapt to changing conditions and data characteristics *during* query execution, maximizing performance by stitching together the best execution paths for each segment.  The continuous learning aspect of the Cost Model Learner is crucial, ensuring the system becomes increasingly accurate over time.
