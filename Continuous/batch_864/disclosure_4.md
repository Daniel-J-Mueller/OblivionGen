## Adaptive Access Granularity via Resource Shadowing

**Concept:** Extend the idea of phased credential revocation by introducing 'resource shadowing' – a system where, during a revocation period, access isn't simply diminished *to* a prior state, but is dynamically split between the live resource and a shadow copy.  This allows for granular, time-sensitive access control *and* a safety net for data in transit during the revocation process.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Shadow Resource Manager (SRM):**  Responsible for creating and maintaining shadow copies of resources.  Shadows are read-only versions, updated periodically (configurable). The SRM tracks the revocation status of credentials and the associated shadow versions.
*   **Component 2: Access Interceptor:**  Sits in front of resource access requests. It intercepts requests, checks credential validity *and* revocation status.
*   **Component 3: Adaptive Routing Engine (ARE):**  Based on credential status, revocation time remaining, and resource sensitivity (configurable), the ARE determines where to route the request – live resource, shadow resource, or a blended response.
*   **Component 4: Blended Response Generator:**  If the ARE determines a blended response is necessary, this component merges data from both live and shadow resources, prioritizing data from the live resource unless shadowing indicates a conflict or issue.

**Workflow:**

1.  User requests access to resource X.
2.  Access Interceptor checks credential validity. If revoked, it determines the time remaining in the revocation period.
3.  ARE evaluates:
    *   **Full Access:** Credential valid - route to live resource.
    *   **Revocation Period – Early Stage:** Route a majority of the request to the live resource, with a small portion directed to the shadow resource for validation. (e.g. 90% Live, 10% Shadow)
    *   **Revocation Period – Mid Stage:** Split access more evenly between live and shadow (e.g., 50/50).
    *   **Revocation Period – Late Stage:**  Route the majority of the request to the shadow resource, with limited access to the live resource for essential operations (e.g., 10/90).
    *   **Resource Sensitivity:** Higher sensitivity resources (e.g., financial data) may be routed to shadows earlier in the revocation process.
4.  Blended Response Generator (if applicable) creates a composite response.
5.  Response delivered to user.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Routing Engine):**

```
function routeRequest(request, credential, revocationTimeRemaining, resourceSensitivity) {

  if (credential.isValid()) {
    return "LiveResource";
  }

  if (revocationTimeRemaining > 0.75) { // >75% of revocation period remaining
    liveRatio = 0.90;
    shadowRatio = 0.10;
  } else if (revocationTimeRemaining > 0.25) { // 25-75% remaining
    liveRatio = 0.50;
    shadowRatio = 0.50;
  } else { // <25% remaining
    liveRatio = 0.10;
    shadowRatio = 0.90;
  }

  // Adjust ratios based on resource sensitivity
  if (resourceSensitivity == "High") {
    liveRatio *= 0.5;  // Reduce live access for sensitive resources
    shadowRatio += 0.5;
  }

  //Route based on ratios (implementation detail)
  if (random() < liveRatio) {
     return "LiveResource";
  } else {
     return "ShadowResource";
  }
}
```

**Configuration:**

*   **Shadow Update Frequency:** How often shadow copies are updated.
*   **Revocation Period Length:** Duration of the credential revocation process.
*   **Resource Sensitivity Levels:** Define sensitivity levels (Low, Medium, High) and associated access rules.
*   **Granularity:** Shadowing can be applied at the resource level, data field level, or even operation level.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced Security: Gradual access reduction minimizes disruption and potential data loss.
*   Improved User Experience: Users can continue accessing data with limited functionality during revocation.
*   Data Integrity: Shadow copies provide a safety net for data in transit during revocation.
*   Fine-Grained Control: Granular shadowing allows for precise access control.
