## Automated Micro-Fluidic Sorting & Analysis Module

**Concept:** Integrate a microfluidic chip directly into the sample container. This allows for pre-PCR analysis and sorting of biological material *before* amplification, increasing specificity and reducing false positives.

**Specs:**

*   **Microfluidic Chip Integration:** A disposable microfluidic chip is permanently bonded (ultrasonically or via adhesive) to the interior of the sample container, specifically within the ‘micro sample chamber’ region described in the claims. Chip material: PDMS or similar biocompatible polymer. Dimensions: 10mm x 20mm x 1mm.
*   **Channel Design:** The chip features a network of microchannels. Initial input channel connects directly to the ‘micro sample chamber’.  Subsequent channels branch out, leading to:
    *   **Size Exclusion Channel:**  Filters particles based on size – separates cells, viruses, or other biological entities.
    *   **Antibody-Functionalized Channel:**  Microchannels coated with antibodies specific to the target pathogen/biomarker.  Binding events trigger a localized electrostatic charge.
    *   **Electrostatic Deflection System:**  An array of micro-electrodes along the channel. Electrostatic charge from antibody binding deflects target particles into a collection chamber.
*   **Optical Detection System:** Integrated miniature LED and photodiode array for real-time optical detection of particles within the microchannels.  Data is transmitted wirelessly (Bluetooth Low Energy) to a paired device (smartphone, tablet, portable reader).
*   **Collection Chamber & PCR Tube Interface:**  Deflected target particles are collected in a small chamber. This chamber directly interfaces with the PCR sample tube when the container is attached. A micro-valve opens, releasing the concentrated sample into the PCR tube.
*   **Power Source:**  A thin-film battery integrated into the sample container wall. Battery capacity: sufficient for one test cycle (chip operation, valve actuation, data transmission).
*   **Control System:**  A small microcontroller embedded within the container wall. Firmware controls chip operation, data acquisition, valve control, and wireless communication.
*   **Fluidic Actuation:** Integrated micro-pumps (piezoelectric or peristaltic) to facilitate fluid movement through the microchannels.

**Novelty:** This combines on-chip sorting/enrichment *before* PCR with integrated data analysis. Current systems rely on bulk sample analysis. This dramatically improves sensitivity and specificity, and provides additional diagnostic information. It's a ‘lab-on-a-chip’ integrated into the sample collection process.
