## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Utilizing captured audio, not just for speech recognition, but to build a dynamic 3D acoustic map of the environment. This map informs proactive assistance features, anticipating user needs *before* a direct request is made.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** Minimum 8-microphone array integrated into the device (speaker, phone, wearable). Placement optimized for spherical sound capture. High SNR microphones essential.
*   **Dedicated DSP:** Digital Signal Processor for real-time audio processing, noise reduction, and beamforming.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Integrated accelerometer and gyroscope for device orientation and movement tracking.
*   **Low-Power Edge Compute:**  Enable local processing to reduce latency and bandwidth requirements.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Acoustic Beamforming:** Algorithms to focus on specific sound sources, minimizing noise and reverberation. Employ adaptive beamforming techniques to track moving sound sources.
*   **Sound Event Detection & Classification (SEDC):**  AI models trained to identify a wide range of environmental sounds (e.g., running water, dog barking, car horn, footsteps, door slams). Utilize transfer learning to expand the sound vocabulary.
*   **Spatial Audio Localization:** Algorithms to estimate the 3D location of sound sources based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) and signal strength. Incorporate IMU data to improve accuracy and handle device movement.
*   **Acoustic Scene Mapping:** Construct a dynamic 3D map of the environment, representing sound source locations as points or volumetric regions. Implement a probabilistic framework to handle uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge.
*   **Predictive Assistance Engine:** AI model trained to predict user needs based on the acoustic scene map and user history. Examples:
    *   Detecting running water -> proactively offer to control smart faucets.
    *   Identifying approaching vehicle -> alert the user to potential traffic hazards.
    *   Recognizing a crying baby -> initiate a calming soundscape.
*   **User Profile Integration:** Link acoustic scene data to user preferences and habits to personalize assistance.

**3. Pseudocode (Predictive Assistance Engine):**

```
FUNCTION predict_assistance(acoustic_scene_map, user_profile, event_history):
    // 1. Identify significant events in the acoustic scene map
    significant_events = analyze_acoustic_scene(acoustic_scene_map)

    // 2. Filter events based on user profile and event history
    relevant_events = filter_events(significant_events, user_profile, event_history)

    // 3. Predict user needs based on relevant events
    predicted_needs = predict_needs(relevant_events)

    // 4. Prioritize predicted needs based on confidence level and urgency
    prioritized_needs = prioritize_needs(predicted_needs)

    // 5. Trigger appropriate actions or provide recommendations
    trigger_actions(prioritized_needs)

    RETURN prioritized_needs
```

**4. Data Requirements:**

*   Large-scale dataset of labeled environmental sounds with corresponding 3D spatial information.
*   User interaction data to train the predictive assistance engine.
*   Calibration data for the multi-microphone array.

**5. Potential Applications:**

*   Smart home automation.
*   Proactive safety alerts (e.g., traffic hazards, falls).
*   Accessibility features for visually impaired users.
*   Enhanced audio conferencing and virtual reality experiences.
