## Dynamic Compression Granularity with Adaptive Dictionary

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on handling uncompressible segments by buffering and flagging them. This design explores a method to *dynamically adjust the compression granularity* based on real-time data characteristics, coupled with an *adaptive dictionary* built from frequently occurring, but short, patterns *within* those seemingly uncompressible segments.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Dedicated hardware compression/decompression unit with configurable block sizes.
    *   Fast SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) for the adaptive dictionary. Size: Configurable, initial 64KB, scalable to 256KB.
    *   DMA (Direct Memory Access) engine for rapid data transfer between memory, buffer, and compression unit.
    *   Control Logic: Finite State Machine (FSM) governing compression/decompression modes and granularity adjustments.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Statistical Analyzer: Real-time analysis of incoming data stream. Measures pattern repetition frequency, entropy, and segment compressibility.
    *   Granularity Control Algorithm:  Adjusts compression block size dynamically. Initial range: 8 bytes to 512 bytes.
    *   Adaptive Dictionary Builder: Constructs a dictionary of frequently occurring patterns *within* uncompressible segments. Updates dictionary continuously.  Maximum dictionary size: Configurable, linked to SRAM capacity.  Dictionary entries: Pattern + Offset.
    *   Compression/Decompression Engine: Uses a hybrid LZ77/Dictionary-based compression scheme.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Setup:** System starts with a default compression block size (e.g., 64 bytes). The adaptive dictionary is initialized empty.
2.  **Statistical Analysis:**  The Statistical Analyzer continuously monitors the incoming data stream.
3.  **Granularity Adjustment:**
    *   If the Statistical Analyzer detects a high frequency of short, repeating patterns *within* what's being treated as an uncompressible segment, it signals the Granularity Control Algorithm to *decrease* the compression block size.  The goal is to isolate these patterns.
    *   If the Statistical Analyzer detects long, mostly random data, it signals the Granularity Control Algorithm to *increase* the compression block size.
4.  **Adaptive Dictionary Update:** When a short, repeating pattern is identified (and isolated by a decreased block size), the pattern is added to the Adaptive Dictionary along with its offset within the data stream.
5.  **Compression/Decompression:**
    *   **Compression:** The Compression Engine attempts to compress data using both LZ77 and the Adaptive Dictionary.  If a match is found in the dictionary, the pattern is replaced with a dictionary index and offset. Otherwise, standard LZ77 compression is applied. Unmatched data is buffered.
    *   **Decompression:** The Decompression Engine reverses the process, replacing dictionary indices with the corresponding patterns.

**Pseudocode (Compression):**

```
function compress(dataStream):
    block_size = default_block_size
    dictionary = empty_dictionary

    while dataStream has data:
        segment = dataStream.read(block_size)
        statistical_analyzer.analyze(segment)

        if statistical_analyzer.is_compressible(segment):
            compressed_segment = perform_lz77(segment)  //Standard LZ77 compression
        else:
            //Adaptive dictionary & smaller block size
            if statistical_analyzer.high_frequency_patterns(segment):
                block_size = reduce_block_size(block_size)
                new_segment = dataStream.read(block_size) // Read new smaller segment
                patterns = statistical_analyzer.find_patterns(new_segment)
                for pattern in patterns:
                    dictionary.add(pattern, new_segment.offset(pattern))

                compressed_segment = dictionary_lookup(new_segment, dictionary) // Substitute dictionary references
            else:
                compressed_segment = new_segment //No compression, buffer it

        output_stream.write(compressed_segment)

    return output_stream
```

**Innovation:** This approach is unique as it doesnâ€™t *fix* the granularity, but *adapts* it based on data characteristics, effectively transforming seemingly incompressible data into compressible chunks by exploiting short-range repetition. This provides potential gains in compression ratio and performance compared to static-granularity methods. This creates a dynamically optimized compression scheme where the level of compression changes depending on the segment of data.
