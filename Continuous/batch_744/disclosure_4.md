## Predictive Hierarchy Shifting for Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Expand upon the dynamic priority computation of data points within hierarchies by introducing *predictive* hierarchy shifting. Instead of solely reacting to access patterns, the system *anticipates* potential anomalies based on subtle deviations in data stream characteristics and proactively reorganizes the hierarchy to prioritize investigation. This allows for faster identification of emerging, previously unseen anomalies, beyond what reactive prioritization can achieve.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Stream Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time data stream, historical data.
*   **Function:** Continuously monitors incoming data for statistical deviations (e.g., change in variance, skewness, entropy) within designated data categories. Employs change-point detection algorithms (e.g., CUSUM, EWMA) to identify subtle shifts indicative of potential anomalies.
*   **Output:** Anomaly Risk Score (ARS) for each data category. ARS represents the likelihood of an emerging anomaly within that category.  Range: 0.0 (no risk) – 1.0 (high risk).

**2. Predictive Hierarchy Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Input:** ARS from Data Stream Analysis Module, Existing Hierarchy Structure, Access Patterns.
*   **Function:**  Dynamically adjusts the hierarchy’s priority order *before* significant access pattern changes are observed.
    *   **ARS Thresholds:** Configurable thresholds for ARS levels (Low, Medium, High).
    *   **Priority Boost:**  If a data category’s ARS exceeds a predefined threshold, the engine *boosts* the priority of its corresponding data points in the hierarchy.  This is done by artificially inflating the ‘access frequency’ used in the existing priority computation.  The boost magnitude is proportional to the ARS level.
    *   **Hierarchy Splitting/Merging:** For sustained high ARS levels, the engine can *split* a data category into more granular sub-categories to facilitate more focused anomaly investigation. Conversely, if ARS consistently remains low, it can *merge* sub-categories to reduce computational overhead.
    *   **Lookahead Window:**  A configurable lookahead window allows the engine to predict future ARS values based on trend analysis.
*   **Output:** Modified Hierarchy Structure with updated data point priorities.

**3.  Anomaly Investigation Module:**

*   **Input:** Modified Hierarchy Structure, Incoming Data Stream.
*   **Function:**  Utilizes the prioritized hierarchy to accelerate anomaly detection.  Focuses initial investigation on data points with the highest priority. Employs machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) to identify anomalous data points within the prioritized categories.
*   **Output:** Anomaly Alerts with associated data points and severity levels.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (executed continuously)

// 1. Data Stream Analysis
ars = DataStreamAnalysis(incomingData)

// 2. Predictive Hierarchy Adjustment
modifiedHierarchy = PredictiveHierarchyAdjustment(existingHierarchy, ars)

// 3. Anomaly Investigation
anomalies = AnomalyInvestigation(modifiedHierarchy, incomingData)

// Output anomalies
```

```
// Function: PredictiveHierarchyAdjustment
function PredictiveHierarchyAdjustment(existingHierarchy, ars) {
  for each category in ars {
    if (ars[category] > threshold_low) {
      boost = ars[category] * boost_factor
      existingHierarchy[category].priority += boost
    }
    if (ars[category] > threshold_high && sustained_high_ars) {
      split_category(existingHierarchy[category])
    }
    if (ars[category] < threshold_low && sustained_low_ars) {
      merge_categories(existingHierarchy)
    }
  }
  return existingHierarchy
}
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Configuration:** ARS thresholds, boost factors, and lookahead window size must be configurable to adapt to different data characteristics and application requirements.
*   **Computational Overhead:** Proactive hierarchy adjustment introduces additional computational overhead.  Careful optimization is necessary to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs.
*   **False Positives:**  Aggressive proactive adjustment may increase the number of false positives.  A robust anomaly filtering mechanism is essential.
*   **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing data processing pipelines is crucial for real-time performance.
