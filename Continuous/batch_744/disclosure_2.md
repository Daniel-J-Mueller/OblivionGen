## Dynamic Keyword-Driven Scene Generation for Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Leverage extracted keywords not just for search refinement, but as *directives* for procedural generation of augmented reality scenes overlaid onto the user’s environment. The existing patent focuses on *identifying* keywords. This builds on that by *acting* on them.

**Specifications:**

**1. Keyword Categorization & Asset Mapping:**

*   **Database:** A vast database categorizing keywords (identified via the source patent's methods) into semantic categories (e.g., "furniture," "nature," "technology," "emotions"). Each category maps to a library of 3D assets, procedural generation rules, and visual effects.
*   **Granularity Levels:** Keywords are mapped at multiple granularity levels. "Chair" (specific) maps to specific chair models. “Furniture” (broad) activates procedural rules for generating a plausible room layout, populating it with generic furniture.
*   **Dynamic Asset Acquisition:** System incorporates the ability to dynamically source assets from online repositories (e.g., Sketchfab, TurboSquid) based on keyword matches. Authentication and licensing handled internally.

**2. Environmental Understanding & Scene Anchoring:**

*   **SLAM Integration:** Utilize Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to create a real-time 3D map of the user’s environment.
*   **Surface Detection:**  Identify planes (floors, walls, tables) for stable scene anchoring.
*   **Occlusion Handling:**  AR rendering engine accurately handles occlusion, ensuring virtual objects appear behind real-world objects.

**3. Procedural Scene Generation Engine:**

*   **Rule-Based Generation:** Define rules that govern how virtual objects are arranged based on keywords and environmental understanding.  Example:  If keyword is "beach" and surface is detected as "floor," generate a sandy beach surface overlay.
*   **Contextualization:** Engine considers environmental context. If the user is in a small room, the generated scene scales down to fit.
*   **Keyword Weighting:** Allow keywords to have weights. “Tropical” (high weight) might generate more lush vegetation than “forest” (low weight).
*   **Procedural Animation:** Incorporate procedural animation.  Example: "Ocean" keyword generates animated waves and marine life.
*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to influence scene generation through sliders and parameter adjustments within the AR application.

**4. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateARScene(document, userEnvironment):

    keywords = ExtractKeywords(document) //Using source patent's method

    sceneObjects = []

    FOR EACH keyword IN keywords:

        category = GetKeywordCategory(keyword)

        IF category != NULL:

            assets = GetAssetsForCategory(category)

            IF assets != NULL:

                //Procedural rules triggered by keyword/category
                IF category == "Nature":
                    GenerateVegetation(assets, userEnvironment.floor, keyword.weight)

                IF category == "Technology":
                    GenerateHolographicProjection(assets, userEnvironment.wall)

                sceneObjects.append(GeneratedObjects)

    RenderARScene(sceneObjects, userEnvironment)

END FUNCTION
```

**5. Application Examples:**

*   **Product Visualization:** User reads a product review (the "document"). The AR app generates a virtual representation of the product in their home.
*   **Immersive Storytelling:** Reading a novel generates an AR scene depicting the story’s environment around the user.
*   **Educational Experiences:**  Reading about dinosaurs generates an AR dinosaur roaming their living room.
*   **Personalized Ambiance:** User selects keywords to create a custom AR environment (e.g., "cozy cabin," "futuristic city").
