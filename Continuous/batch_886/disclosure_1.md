## Predictive Environment Control

**Concept:** Leveraging usage pattern analysis to proactively adjust environmental settings (lighting, temperature, sound) to optimize for anticipated user activity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrated sensors within the computing device/environment (smart home hub) collecting:
    *   Ambient Light Levels (Lux)
    *   Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
    *   Sound Levels (dB)
    *   Device Orientation (Accelerometer/Gyroscope)
    *   Proximity (Infrared/Ultrasonic - for room occupancy)
*   **Usage Data:** Historical and real-time data mirroring the provided patent:
    *   Application Usage (time, duration, frequency)
    *   Communication Patterns (call/message frequency, content keywords)
    *   Calendar Events (scheduled meetings, appointments, reminders)
    *   Location Data (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation - optional, user consent required)

**2. Pattern Recognition & Prediction Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** Hybrid approach combining:
    *   **Time Series Analysis:**  Identifying recurring patterns in sensor data & usage data over time.
    *   **Machine Learning (Recurrent Neural Networks - RNN/LSTM):** Predicting future states based on historical sequences.  Specifically trained on associating usage patterns with preferred environmental settings.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Weighting factors based on:
    *   **Time of Day:**  Different preferences for morning, afternoon, evening.
    *   **Day of Week:**  Workday vs. weekend adjustments.
    *   **Calendar Events:**  Adjustments based on upcoming meetings (e.g., brighter lighting for video calls, quieter environment for focused work).
    *   **User Roles/Profiles:** Separate environmental profiles for different users within a shared space.

**3. Environmental Control System Interface:**

*   **Actuator Control:**  Communication with smart home devices via standard protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi). Control of:
    *   Smart Lights (brightness, color temperature)
    *   Smart Thermostats (temperature setpoints)
    *   Smart Speakers (volume, ambient soundscapes)
    *   Smart Blinds/Curtains (open/close position)
*   **Predictive Adjustment:** Based on the prediction engineâ€™s output, proactively adjust environmental settings *before* the user initiates the associated activity.  Example:  If the user typically starts a video conference at 9:00 AM, automatically increase lighting and reduce ambient noise at 8:55 AM.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   **Implicit Feedback:** Monitor user actions after environmental adjustments.  If the user manually overrides settings, penalize the prediction model.
    *   **Explicit Feedback:**  Allow the user to rate the effectiveness of adjustments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predictEnvironment(usageData, sensorData, calendarData):
  // 1. Analyze historical data to learn user preferences.
  userPreferences = learnPreferences(usageData)

  // 2. Predict upcoming activity based on calendar & usage patterns.
  predictedActivity = predictActivity(calendarData, usageData)

  // 3. Determine optimal environmental settings for predicted activity.
  optimalSettings = determineSettings(predictedActivity, userPreferences)

  // 4. Adjust environmental settings.
  adjustSettings(optimalSettings)

  // 5. Monitor user behavior and update preferences.
  monitorFeedback(userBehavior)
  updatePreferences(userFeedback)
```

**Novelty:** The system goes beyond simply *reacting* to user activity. It proactively anticipates needs and adjusts the environment *before* the user is consciously aware of them, increasing comfort and productivity. Existing smart home systems focus on remote control and automation based on predefined rules, not predictive adaptation based on learned usage patterns.
