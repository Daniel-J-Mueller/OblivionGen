## Dynamic Query Re-weighting based on User Interaction History

**Concept:** Extend the pruning data concept to include a dynamic weighting system based on user interaction with query results. Instead of *just* frequency and changeability, track which parameter adjustments (removals/additions) lead to *successful* user outcomes (e.g., clicking on a result, marking it as relevant, completing a task). This creates a personalized pruning dataset per user.

**Specs:**

1.  **User Interaction Logging:**
    *   Track user clicks, dwell time on results, explicit relevance feedback (thumbs up/down), task completion signals (e.g., purchasing an item, submitting a form) associated with each query and its variations.
    *   Store this data linked to the user account.

2.  **Interaction-Based Weighting:**
    *   Develop a scoring system that assigns weights to parameters based on their correlation with positive user interactions.  For example:
        *   **Positive Interaction Score (PIS):** Calculated for each parameter based on how often its inclusion/exclusion led to positive interactions.
        *   **Negative Interaction Score (NIS):** Calculated for each parameter based on how often its inclusion/exclusion led to negative interactions.
        *   **Weighted Parameter Value (WPV):** `WPV = PIS - NIS`

3.  **Dynamic Query Generation:**
    *   When generating the initial query, *also* consider the WPV of each parameter for the current user.
    *   Prioritize retaining parameters with high WPV and removing those with low/negative WPV.
    *   Implement an exploration/exploitation strategy. Occasionally *re-introduce* parameters that were previously removed, even if their current WPV is low, to allow for discovery of potentially changing preferences. This could be a randomized 'epsilon' approach.

4.  **Query Variation A/B Testing:**
    *   Before presenting the final query to the user, generate a small number of query variations (e.g., 2-3) based on slightly different weighting strategies.
    *   Present these variations to the user (potentially hidden, via subtle result ranking adjustments) and monitor which variation leads to the most positive interactions.
    *   Use this data to refine the weighting strategy in real-time.

5.  **User-Specific Pruning Data:**
    *   Maintain a user-specific pruning dataset that stores the learned WPVs for each parameter.
    *   This allows for highly personalized query optimization.
    *   Consider periodically resetting the user-specific pruning data (e.g., after a long period of inactivity) to prevent stale preferences.

**Pseudocode (Query Generation):**

```
function generate_query(user_id, data_objects):
    user_pruning_data = load_user_pruning_data(user_id)
    parameters = extract_parameters(data_objects)

    #Initial Query
    initial_query = construct_query(parameters)

    #Weight Parameters
    weighted_parameters = weight_parameters(parameters, user_pruning_data)

    #Sort parameters by weighted value (descending)
    sorted_parameters = sort_parameters(weighted_parameters)

    #Iteratively remove lowest weighted parameters
    current_query = initial_query
    while (number of parameters in current_query > threshold):
        parameter_to_remove = sorted_parameters[0]  #Lowest weight
        current_query.remove(parameter_to_remove)
        sorted_parameters.remove(parameter_to_remove)

    return current_query
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased query relevance and accuracy.
*   Improved user satisfaction.
*   Personalized search experience.
*   Adaptive learning of user preferences.
*   Potential for proactive query suggestions.
