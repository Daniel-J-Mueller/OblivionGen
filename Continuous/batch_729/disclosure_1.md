**Dynamic Environmental Masking for Augmented Reality Integration**

**Concept:** Extend the image masking and cropping technology to dynamically integrate augmented reality (AR) elements seamlessly into the captured image or live video feed. Instead of simply cropping *out* areas, actively *replace* them with AR content, while maintaining realistic occlusion and lighting.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Depth Sensor (LiDAR or similar): Required for accurate 3D scene reconstruction and depth map generation. (Existing in Claim 7/8).
    *   RGB Camera: High-resolution color capture. (Existing).
    *   Processing Unit: Capable of real-time 3D rendering and image processing.
    *   AR Display: (Headset, phone screen, projected) for displaying the combined AR/real world view.

*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Dynamic Mask Generator:** This module refines the existing image mask technology.
        *   Input: Depth map, RGB image, User/Floor Segmentation (as per patent).
        *   Output:  A continuously updating mask that identifies areas suitable for AR replacement. Crucially, this mask isn't static; it adjusts for user movement and changes in the scene. Includes a "confidence" score for mask accuracy.
    *   **AR Content Library:** A database of 3D models and textures. Content is tagged with metadata relevant to scene context (e.g., "furniture," "clothing," "accessories").
    *   **Scene Understanding Engine:** Uses computer vision algorithms to analyze the captured scene.
        *   Object Recognition: Identifies objects in the scene (chairs, tables, people).
        *   Surface Normal Estimation:  Determines the orientation of surfaces for realistic AR content placement and lighting.
        *   Lighting Estimation:  Analyzes ambient lighting to match the AR content’s appearance.
    *   **AR Compositor:**  Combines the real-world image, AR content, and dynamically generated mask.
        *   Occlusion Handling: Ensures AR content is correctly occluded by real-world objects and vice versa. Uses depth information for accurate layering.
        *   Lighting Integration:  Applies lighting effects to AR content to match the real-world environment.
        *   Blending:  Seamlessly blends the AR content into the real-world image, minimizing visual artifacts.
    *   **User Interface (UI):** Allows users to select and customize AR content.

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  **Scene Capture:** Depth sensor and RGB camera capture the environment.
    2.  **Segmentation & Masking:** Dynamic Mask Generator creates a mask identifying user, floor, and potential AR replacement areas. Confidence scores are calculated.
    3.  **Scene Understanding:** Scene Understanding Engine analyzes the environment, identifying objects, surfaces, and lighting conditions.
    4.  **AR Content Selection:** User selects AR content via the UI, or the system suggests content based on scene context.
    5.  **AR Composition:** AR Compositor integrates the AR content into the scene, handling occlusion, lighting, and blending.
    6.  **Display:** Combined image is displayed on the AR display.

*   **Pseudocode (AR Compositor):**

    ```
    function CompositeAR(realImage, arContent, mask, depthMap):
        #For each pixel in realImage:
            if mask[pixel] == "AR_REPLACE":
                #Use depthMap to determine if pixel is in front of or behind real-world objects
                if depthMap[pixel] > depthMap[correspondingRealWorldPixel]:
                    #Render arContent pixel onto realImage pixel
                    realImage[pixel] = arContent[pixel]
                else:
                    #Keep original realImage pixel
                    pass #Or blend for soft occlusion

            else:
                #Keep original realImage pixel
                pass

        return realImage
    ```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Virtual Try-On: Allow users to virtually “try on” clothing or accessories in real-time.
    *   Home Decor: Visualize furniture and decorations in a user’s home before purchasing.
    *   Interactive Gaming: Create more immersive gaming experiences.
    *   Remote Collaboration: Allow remote participants to interact with a shared virtual environment.
    *   Real-time content replacement for streaming.
    *   Dynamic ad placement.
