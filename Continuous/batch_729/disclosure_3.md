## Adaptive Data Enrichment Profiles

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust enrichment logic based on real-time data characteristics and observed enrichment success/failure rates. This goes beyond static enrichment parameters; it learns *how* to enrich data more effectively over time.

**Specifications:**

**1. Profile Definition:**

*   **Data Signature:** A rolling hash or vector embedding representing the statistical characteristics of incoming data (e.g., field types, value ranges, cardinality).
*   **Enrichment Recipe:** A set of enrichment functions (similar to the existing "executable code") along with associated weights.  These weights determine the probability of applying a particular function to the data.
*   **Performance Metrics:**  Tracks success/failure rates of each enrichment function for a given data signature.  "Success" could be defined by schema validation, downstream system acceptance, or user-defined criteria.
*   **Learning Rate:**  A parameter controlling how quickly the system adjusts enrichment weights based on performance metrics.
*   **Exploration/Exploitation Balance:** A parameter to control how much the system should try new enrichment functions (exploration) versus relying on existing proven functions (exploitation).

**2. System Components:**

*   **Data Signature Generator:** Extracts a data signature from incoming data.
*   **Profile Store:**  Stores enrichment profiles (data signature, enrichment recipe, performance metrics). A key-value store is suitable.
*   **Profile Selector:**  Selects the most appropriate enrichment profile based on the incoming data signature.  Nearest neighbor search can be used. If no close match is found, a default or randomly initialized profile is selected.
*   **Enrichment Engine:**  Applies the selected enrichment recipe to the data.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitors enrichment success/failure and updates the performance metrics in the Profile Store.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  Data arrives at the system.
2.  Data Signature Generator creates a data signature.
3.  Profile Selector retrieves the best matching profile.
4.  Enrichment Engine applies the profileâ€™s enrichment recipe.
5.  Feedback Loop monitors the results.
6.  Performance metrics are updated in the Profile Store.
7.  The system adjusts enrichment weights based on the learning rate and exploration/exploitation balance.

**4. Pseudocode (Profile Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_profile(data_signature, enrichment_recipe, performance_metrics, learning_rate, exploration_rate):
  // Calculate reward based on enrichment success
  reward = calculate_reward(enrichment_success)

  // Update weights for each enrichment function
  for each function in enrichment_recipe:
    // Calculate Q-value (estimate of future reward)
    q_value = performance_metrics[function] + learning_rate * (reward - performance_metrics[function])
    performance_metrics[function] = q_value

  // Exploration: Randomly introduce new functions with a small probability
  if random() < exploration_rate:
    new_function = select_random_enrichment_function()
    enrichment_recipe.add(new_function)
    performance_metrics[new_function] = 0  // Initialize performance metric

  return enrichment_recipe, performance_metrics
```

**5. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Federated Learning:**  Allow multiple data sources to contribute to the learning process without sharing raw data.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Use data signatures to identify anomalous data that may require different enrichment strategies.
*   **Automated Profile Creation:**  Automatically generate new profiles based on clusters of similar data signatures.
*   **Dynamic Sharding:** Adjust the number of shards based on the diversity of incoming data signatures.
