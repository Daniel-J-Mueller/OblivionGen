## Dynamic Executable ‘Shattering’ & Reassembly

**Concept:** Instead of permuting addresses or encoding with keys, completely shatter an executable into non-contiguous, dynamically reassembled fragments at runtime. This goes beyond simple address space layout randomization (ASLR).

**Specification:**

1.  **Compilation Phase: Fragmenter.** A pre-compilation tool (the ‘Fragmenter’) analyzes the executable and divides it into functionally independent code blocks (fragments). These fragments aren’t necessarily sequential in the original file. The Fragmenter creates a ‘manifest’ – a metadata file detailing:
    *   Fragment IDs (unique identifiers)
    *   Fragment Size
    *   Entry Point (relative to the fragment’s start)
    *   Dependencies (other Fragment IDs required for execution – data or control flow)
    *   Checksum (for integrity verification)
2.  **Storage:** The fragments are stored as individual, unlinked files. The manifest accompanies these fragments. The original executable file is discarded.
3.  **Runtime Loader/Assembler:**
    *   **Manifest Parsing:** The loader reads the manifest.
    *   **Fragment Loading:** Fragments are loaded into memory, *not* necessarily at contiguous addresses.
    *   **Dependency Resolution:** The loader analyzes dependencies specified in the manifest.
    *   **Dynamic Patching:**  The loader dynamically patches jump/call instructions within each fragment to correctly point to the loaded addresses of dependent fragments. This is the crucial step.  It effectively rewires the executable at runtime.
    *   **Execution Start:** Execution begins at the designated entry point of the initial fragment.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Patching – simplified example):**

```
function patch_instruction(instruction_address, target_fragment_id):
  // 1. Read the original instruction bytes
  original_bytes = read_memory(instruction_address, instruction_length)

  // 2. Determine the target address of the fragment
  target_address = get_fragment_address(target_fragment_id)

  // 3. Calculate the relative offset from the current instruction
  offset = target_address - (instruction_address + instruction_length)

  // 4.  Modify the instruction bytes to encode the new relative offset.
  //     (This depends on the instruction set architecture)
  modified_bytes = encode_relative_jump(offset)

  // 5. Write the modified bytes back to memory
  write_memory(instruction_address, modified_bytes)
```

**Security Implications:**

*   **Anti-Disassembly:** Makes static analysis extremely difficult.  The executable only exists in a coherent state *during* runtime, and even then, the memory layout is dynamic.
*   **Circumvention of Existing Protections:**  Bypasses protections based on fixed code/data addresses.
*   **Increased Complexity:** Makes reverse engineering far more challenging, as an attacker must first reconstruct the entire executable in memory before attempting analysis.

**Adaptations:**

*   **Adaptive Fragmentation:** Fragment size and composition can vary based on the execution environment.
*   **Secure Manifest Storage:**  Manifest can be encrypted and/or digitally signed to prevent tampering.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:**  Specialized hardware could accelerate the dynamic patching process.
