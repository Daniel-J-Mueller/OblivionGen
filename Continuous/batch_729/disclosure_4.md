## Adaptive Sensory Substitution for Reading Assistance

**Core Concept:** Leverage multi-sensory feedback beyond visual cues to aid reading comprehension and address reading difficulties. The system aims to create a dynamically adaptive ‘reading aura’ that guides the reader’s focus, supplementing visual input with tactile and auditory cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integrated E-Reader/Tablet with high-resolution display.
    *   Haptic Feedback Array – Thin, flexible array embedded within the device’s frame and potentially extending to a specialized grip accessory. Capable of localized vibration, pressure changes, and subtle temperature variations.
    *   Bone Conduction Headphones – Deliver directional audio cues without blocking ambient sound.
    *   Biometric Sensors – Embedded heart rate variability (HRV) sensor and galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor to assess cognitive load and emotional state.
    *   Eye-tracking camera.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Reading Progress Analyzer:**  Analyzes reading speed, eye movements (saccades, fixations), and pause durations.  This module is inherited from the base patent but focuses on more granular data – not just skipped words, but the *type* of reading difficulty indicated by eye movement patterns (e.g., regressions indicating comprehension issues).
    *   **Cognitive Load Monitor:** Processes data from HRV and GSR sensors to determine the reader’s current cognitive load. High load suggests difficulty.
    *   **Sensory Mapping Engine:**  The core of the system. Maps reading difficulties (detected by the Reading Progress Analyzer and Cognitive Load Monitor) to specific sensory outputs.  This is a configurable engine allowing customization of the ‘reading aura’.  Examples:
        *   **Difficulty with Pronunciation:**  Subtle haptic pulse on the finger corresponding to the syllable the reader is struggling with, coupled with a synthesized phonetic pronunciation delivered via bone conduction headphones.
        *   **Comprehension Issues:**  Localized warming sensation on the palm when encountering a conceptually challenging passage. Simultaneously, the system subtly highlights key phrases or provides a brief contextual definition through bone conduction audio.
        *   **Skipped Words/Regression:**  Gentle vibration on the side of the device corresponding to the skipped word's position on the page.
        *   **Emotional Resonance:**  Adapt haptic feedback based on the emotional tone of the text. E.g. A warming sensation for a loving passage, cooling for a scary one.
    *   **Adaptive Learning Algorithm:**  Machine learning algorithm that personalizes the sensory mapping over time.  It learns which sensory cues are most effective for the individual reader, adjusting the intensity, duration, and type of feedback.
    *   **User Interface:**  Allows readers to customize the intensity of sensory feedback, choose preferred cue types, and view metrics on their reading performance.

**Novelty:** Existing systems primarily focus on visual aids (highlighting, text magnification). This design moves beyond visual cues by integrating tactile and auditory feedback, creating a multi-sensory reading experience. The adaptive learning algorithm and biometric monitoring enhance personalization and effectiveness, creating a dynamic system that responds to the reader’s individual needs and cognitive state.  The inclusion of emotional resonance as a feedback component is a unique addition.
