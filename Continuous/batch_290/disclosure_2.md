## Dynamic Key Orchestration via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate biometric data – specifically, electrodermal activity (EDA) or heart rate variability (HRV) – into the key derivation process for enhanced security and user-adaptive encryption. This adds a layer of authentication beyond passwords or PINs, making the system resistant to replay attacks and key compromise.  

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Sensor Integration:**
    *   Hardware:  A non-invasive wearable sensor (smartwatch, wristband, or integrated device) capable of reliably capturing EDA or HRV data.  API compatibility with existing mobile and desktop operating systems.
    *   Data Acquisition: Continuous or near-continuous monitoring of biometric signals during key exchange and communication sessions. Raw data stream to a secure enclave on the device.
2.  **Key Derivation Function (KDF) Modification:**
    *   Standard KDF: Employ an existing robust KDF like HKDF or Argon2.
    *   Biometric Input:  Integrate a processed biometric signal (e.g., rolling average of EDA levels, HRV features) as a *salt* or *info* parameter within the KDF.  
        *   Preprocessing:  Noise reduction, baseline correction, normalization of biometric data.
        *   Entropy Enhancement:  Combine biometric data with a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG) to maximize entropy.
    *   Dynamic Key Updates: Implement periodic key refreshes based on continuous biometric monitoring. Detect significant changes in biometric signals (indicating potential compromise or impersonation) and trigger immediate key revocation/re-establishment.
3.  **Secure Enclave Integration:**
    *   Dedicated Hardware: Utilize a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) or Secure Element (SE) to protect the private key material and perform critical cryptographic operations.
    *   Attestation: Enable remote attestation to verify the integrity of the secure enclave and the biometric sensor.
4.  **Communication Protocol Adaptation:**
    *   Control Channel: Extend the initial handshake process in the provided patent to include biometric data exchange and verification.
    *   Communication Channel:  Implement a mechanism for continuous biometric monitoring during the communication session.
    *   Error Handling:  Gracefully handle biometric data loss or sensor failure. Implement fallback mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication, session termination).

**Pseudocode (Key Exchange):**

```
// Device A (Initiator)

1. Capture initial biometric data (EDA/HRV) -> biometricDataA
2. Generate asymmetric key pair (public/private)
3. Generate random salt
4. Derive key-encrypting key: KDF(privateKeyA, salt, biometricDataA, public key of Device B)
5. Encrypt first key using derived key-encrypting key
6. Send request to Device B: identifier, encrypted key, public key A, salt, initial biometricDataA

// Device B (Responder)
1. Receive request from Device A
2. Capture biometric data -> biometricDataB
3. Verify Device A’s public key
4. Derive key-encrypting key: KDF(privateKeyB, salt, biometricDataB, public key A)
5. Decrypt first key using derived key-encrypting key
6. Establish secure communication channel using first key

// Continuous Communication:
// Both Devices:
// 1. Periodically capture biometric data
// 2. Recalculate key-encrypting key using updated biometric data
// 3. Re-encrypt/decrypt communication data using updated key
// 4. Monitor for significant biometric changes (indicating potential compromise)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced security for high-value communications (financial transactions, healthcare data).
*   User-adaptive encryption tailored to individual physiological characteristics.
*   Real-time threat detection based on biometric anomalies.
*   Biometric-based access control for secure communication sessions.
