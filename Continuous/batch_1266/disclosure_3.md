## Dynamic Category-Aware Sensory Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the user interface adjustment beyond visual elements to incorporate haptic and auditory feedback dynamically linked to predicted category relevance. This creates a multi-sensory experience that reinforces category association and enhances user engagement.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Sensory Feedback Engine:** A software module integrated into the existing system. Receives category predictions from the browse node prediction process.
*   **Haptic Device Interface:**  Drivers and API for interfacing with a range of haptic devices (e.g., vibration motors in handheld devices, force feedback controllers, wearable haptic suits).
*   **Auditory Feedback Engine:**  Software for generating and controlling audio cues.
*   **Category-Sensory Mapping Database:** A configurable database defining the relationship between categories and sensory feedback parameters. (See Section 3).

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  The user enters a search query.
2.  The browse node prediction process determines potential categories (First, Second, Third).
3.  The Sensory Feedback Engine receives the category predictions and their associated confidence scores.
4.  Based on the highest confidence category, the engine selects corresponding sensory feedback parameters from the Category-Sensory Mapping Database.
5.  The engine triggers the Haptic Device Interface and/or Auditory Feedback Engine to deliver the appropriate sensory feedback.
6.  Sensory feedback is layered *on top of* the existing UI adjustments (e.g., image-heavy layout for Apparel, text-focused for Books).

**3. Category-Sensory Mapping Database Structure:**

| Category    | Haptic Feedback (Type, Intensity, Pattern) | Auditory Feedback (Sound Type, Pitch, Volume) |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Apparel     | Gentle vibration pulse, high intensity    | Fabric rustling sound, medium pitch            |
| Books       | Subtle, sustained vibration, low intensity | Page turning sound, low pitch                 |
| Electronics| Short, sharp vibration, medium intensity  | Electronic chime, high pitch                   |
| Toys        | Playful vibration pattern, high intensity  | Cartoon sound effect, medium pitch             |
| Food        | Rhythmic, pulsing vibration, low intensity | Gentle bubbling sound, low pitch                |
| Sports      | Fast, energetic vibration, high intensity | Crowd cheering sound, medium pitch              |

*   **Haptic Types:** Vibration, Force Feedback, Texture Simulation.
*   **Sound Types:** Ambient sounds, instrument sounds, synthesized tones.
*   Parameters are configurable via an administrative interface.

**4. Pseudocode (Sensory Feedback Engine):**

```
FUNCTION deliverSensoryFeedback(category, confidenceScore):
  IF confidenceScore > threshold:
    sensoryParameters = lookupCategoryParameters(category)
    activateHapticDevice(sensoryParameters.hapticType, sensoryParameters.intensity, sensoryParameters.pattern)
    playAudioCue(sensoryParameters.soundType, sensoryParameters.pitch, sensoryParameters.volume)
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION lookupCategoryParameters(category):
  # Access Category-Sensory Mapping Database
  # Return corresponding sensory parameters
ENDFUNCTION
```

**5. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Integration with existing devices (smartphones, tablets, computers) via standard interfaces (USB, Bluetooth).
*   Support for a range of haptic devices with varying capabilities.
*   Consideration of user comfort and safety when designing haptic feedback patterns.
