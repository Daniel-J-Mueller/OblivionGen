## Dynamic Network Topology as a Service (DNTaaS)

**Concept:** Leverage the virtual network instantiation and communication modification techniques described in the patent to offer a *service* where customers can define and dynamically modify the *physical* network topology their virtual networks traverse. This isn't just virtual network creation; it's controlling where traffic *physically* goes.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Topology Definition Language (TDL):**  A declarative language allowing users to specify network constraints and preferences.  Constraints could include:
    *   Geographic limitations (e.g., "Traffic must not leave the EU").
    *   Latency requirements (e.g., "Maximum latency between VMs must be < 5ms").
    *   Bandwidth allocation (e.g., "Reserve 10Gbps bandwidth for this virtual network").
    *   Security Zones (e.g., “Route traffic through a specific firewall cluster”).
    *   Cost optimization (e.g. "Prioritize cheapest network routes").
*   **Topology Engine:**  The core of the service. This component:
    *   Parses TDL definitions.
    *   Queries available network infrastructure (physical network maps, link capacities, costs, security profiles).
    *   Uses a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra’s, A\*) to determine optimal physical network paths for virtual network traffic, respecting defined constraints.
    *   Dynamically programs the underlying network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls) using APIs (e.g., OpenFlow, NETCONF, REST APIs) to enforce the calculated paths.
*   **Mapping Service:**  As in the patent, responsible for translating virtual network addresses to physical network addresses, *but* with the added capability of dynamically updating these mappings based on changes to the physical network topology orchestrated by the Topology Engine.
*   **Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**  Continuously monitors network performance (latency, bandwidth, packet loss) along the chosen paths. If performance degrades below acceptable thresholds, the Topology Engine automatically re-calculates paths and re-programs the network.

**2. Data Structures:**

*   `TDL_Definition`:  A structured representation of the topology definition language.
    *   `constraints`: List of `Constraint` objects.
    *   `preferences`: List of `Preference` objects.
*   `Constraint`:  Defines a hard requirement for the topology.
    *   `type`: Enum (Geographic, Latency, Bandwidth, Security).
    *   `value`:  Dependent on `type` (e.g., EU country code, maximum latency in ms, bandwidth in Mbps).
*   `Preference`:  Defines a desired characteristic of the topology.
    *   `type`: Enum (Cost, Performance).
    *   `weight`:  Relative importance of the preference.
*   `NetworkGraph`: Represents the physical network topology.
    *   `nodes`: List of `Node` objects (routers, switches, firewalls).
    *   `links`: List of `Link` objects (connections between nodes).  Each link has attributes like bandwidth, latency, cost.

**3.  Pseudocode (Topology Engine):**

```
function calculateTopology(TDL_Definition definition):
  NetworkGraph graph = queryPhysicalNetwork()
  filteredGraph = applyConstraints(graph, definition.constraints)
  optimalPath = findOptimalPath(filteredGraph, definition.preferences)
  programNetwork(optimalPath)
  return optimalPath

function applyConstraints(NetworkGraph graph, List<Constraint> constraints):
  filteredGraph = copy(graph)
  for each Constraint constraint in constraints:
    if constraint.type == Geographic:
      remove nodes and links outside specified geographic region
    if constraint.type == Latency:
      remove links exceeding specified latency
    // Add other constraint types
  return filteredGraph

function findOptimalPath(NetworkGraph graph, List<Preference> preferences):
  // Use A* or Dijkstra's algorithm with weighted edges
  // Edge weights are calculated based on preferences (cost, performance)
  // Return the path with the lowest total cost/highest performance
  return path

function programNetwork(path):
  // Use APIs (OpenFlow, NETCONF, REST) to configure network devices
  // Set up forwarding rules, QoS policies, etc.
  // to enforce the calculated path
```

**4.  Innovation & Differentiation:**

*   **Granular Control:** Moves beyond simple virtual network creation to give users control over the *physical* network paths their traffic traverses.
*   **Dynamic Optimization:** Continuously monitors and optimizes network paths based on real-time conditions and user-defined preferences.
*   **Compliance & Security:** Enables users to enforce geographic restrictions and security policies at the physical network level.
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** Supports multiple customers and virtual networks sharing the same physical infrastructure, with strong isolation and security.
