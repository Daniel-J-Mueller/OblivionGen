## Adaptive Sensor Array Geometry

**Concept:** Dynamically reconfigure the physical arrangement of pixel sensors on the imaging device to optimize for blur characteristics *before* capturing an image. This isn’t just about differing digitization rates, but about *physically* shifting the sensors.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Array:** The imaging sensor is composed of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based pixel sensors. Each sensor is individually addressable and can be physically moved (limited range – millimeters) via electrostatic or magnetic actuation.
*   **Blur Prediction Module:**  A dedicated hardware/software module running a fast blur prediction algorithm.  Input:  Scene analysis (depth map, object recognition – pre-capture).  Output: A “blur map” indicating the expected blur distribution across the scene.
*   **Actuation Control System:** A closed-loop control system that precisely positions each pixel sensor based on the blur map. This system must be extremely fast (millisecond-level adjustments) to compensate for motion blur or rapidly changing scene dynamics.
*   **Image Reconstruction Engine:** A novel image reconstruction algorithm that accounts for the non-standard sensor arrangement. Traditional demosaicing and image processing pipelines will not function correctly. The engine needs to interpolate data from the rearranged sensors to generate a standard image format.
*   **Power Management:** Significant power consumption is anticipated from actuation and data processing.  A dynamic power allocation system is required to optimize performance while minimizing energy usage.

**Pseudocode (Actuation Control System):**

```
// Input: Blur Map (2D array of blur values), Sensor Array Geometry
// Output: Actuation commands for each sensor

FOR EACH sensor IN SensorArray:
    sensor.reset_position() // Return to nominal position
    blur_value = BlurMap[sensor.x, sensor.y]

    IF blur_value > threshold:
        //Calculate displacement vector towards region of higher blur
        displacement_vector = calculate_displacement(blur_value, sensor.position)

        //Apply actuation command
        sensor.move(displacement_vector)

        //Record new sensor position
        record_sensor_position(sensor.position)
    ENDIF
ENDFOR

//Verify all sensors moved as expected. If not, return an error.
verify_sensor_movement()
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Blur Reduction:** Addresses blur *before* capture, unlike the patent which reacts to blur in post-processing.
*   **Adaptive Resolution:** By moving sensors closer together in regions of high blur, effective resolution can be increased in those areas.
*   **Enhanced Depth-of-Field:** Sensor movement allows for a dynamically adjusted depth-of-field, potentially capturing more of a scene in focus without requiring complex optics.
*   **Novel Image Reconstruction:** The image reconstruction engine becomes a key differentiator.  It needs to be robust and efficient to handle the non-standard sensor arrangement.
