## Adaptive Predictive Gaze Correction System

**Core Concept:** Expanding beyond simply *detecting* forward gaze, this system *predicts* gaze direction based on subtle micro-movements and physiological signals, then actively compensates for minor head movements *before* they impact image capture, resulting in consistently optimal facial recognition data even with non-static subjects.

**System Components:**

1.  **Multi-Spectral Micro-Movement Sensor Array:** A high-resolution sensor array (integrated with the image capture element) measuring minute head movements – not just gross rotations, but also subtle vibrations and anticipatory muscle movements around the eyes and head. This utilizes a combination of:
    *   Infrared reflectance imaging to track skin deformation.
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope for inertial measurement.
    *   Electrooculography (EOG) to detect pre-saccadic eye movements.
2.  **Physiological Signal Acquisition:** Non-invasive sensors to monitor:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – used to gauge alertness and anticipate potential involuntary movements.
    *   Skin Conductance –  provides an indicator of cognitive load and attention, predicting potential shifts in gaze.
3.  **Predictive Gaze Model:** A machine learning model trained to correlate micro-movements, physiological signals, and established gaze direction.  This is a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture - specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network - to handle sequential data.
4.  **Active Compensation Mechanism:** A miniature gimbal system attached to the image capture element, controlled by the Predictive Gaze Model, to counteract predicted head movements in real-time.  This isn't about *stabilization* but *anticipation*.
5.  **Dynamic Focus Adjustment:**  Integrated with the compensation mechanism, a rapid, precise focus adjustment system ensures the captured image remains sharp even with micro-movements.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
loop:
  capture_micro_movement_data()
  capture_physiological_data()

  predicted_gaze_offset = PredictiveGazeModel.predict(micro_movement_data, physiological_data)

  CompensationMechanism.adjust(predicted_gaze_offset)
  DynamicFocusAdjustment.adjust(predicted_gaze_offset)

  capture_image()

  return image
```
