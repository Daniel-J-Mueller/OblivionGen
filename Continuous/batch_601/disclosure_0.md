**Dynamic Voltage Level Shifting for Modular Power Stacks**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple redundancy and implement a system where multiple AC-DC conversion modules dynamically adjust their output voltage *before* combining onto a common DC bus. This allows the power supply to optimize for varying load demands and input voltage conditions, improving efficiency and reducing heat.

**Specs:**

*   **Modular Design:** Power supply consists of N identical AC-DC conversion modules (modules). Each module is hot-swappable.
*   **Individual DC-DC Conversion:** Each module contains a primary AC-DC converter *and* a secondary DC-DC converter. The AC-DC converter produces a baseline DC voltage. The DC-DC converter adjusts this baseline voltage *up or down* within a defined range (e.g., +/- 5%).
*   **Communication Bus:** Modules are connected via a high-speed communication bus (e.g., I2C, SPI) to a central controller.
*   **Central Controller:** Monitors the load demand (current draw from the DC bus), input AC voltage, and module status.  Uses a predictive algorithm to determine the optimal voltage output for each module.
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** Based on historical data and real-time measurements, the controller predicts future load demands.  It then adjusts the DC-DC converters within each module to minimize overall power loss.
*   **Dynamic Voltage Assignment:** The controller assigns different voltage levels to different modules based on their capacity and efficiency at different load levels. Modules with higher capacity may be assigned higher voltages for driving larger loads, while more efficient modules are used for low-current applications.
*   **Load Balancing:**  The controller dynamically shifts load between modules to maximize efficiency and prevent overheating.
*   **Voltage Regulation on DC Bus:** A final stage voltage regulator on the common DC bus ensures a stable output voltage despite the varying contributions from the individual modules.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  If a module fails, the controller automatically redistributes the load to the remaining modules.

**Pseudocode (Central Controller):**

```
//Initialization
load_history = []
module_status = [True] * N //Assume all modules are initially online
module_efficiency_map = {} //Lookup table for each module's efficiency at various voltage/current levels

//Main Loop
while(true):
    //Measure load demand (current_draw)
    current_draw = measure_load_demand()

    //Predict future load
    predicted_load = predict_load(current_draw, load_history)

    //Calculate optimal voltage for each module
    for i in range(N):
        if(module_status[i]):
            voltage = calculate_optimal_voltage(i, predicted_load, module_efficiency_map)
            set_module_voltage(i, voltage)
        else:
            set_module_voltage(i, 0)

    //Monitor module status
    for i in range(N):
        module_status[i] = check_module_status(i)

    //Log load history
    load_history.append(current_draw)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Efficiency:** Dynamic voltage adjustment minimizes power loss in both the AC-DC and DC-DC converters.
*   **Improved Reliability:** Load balancing reduces stress on individual modules.
*   **Scalability:** Modular design allows for easy expansion of the power supply capacity.
*   **Adaptability:**  The system can adapt to changing load profiles and input voltage conditions.
