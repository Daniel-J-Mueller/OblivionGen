## Dynamic Artifact Replacement with Generative AI

**Concept:** Instead of simply masking artifacts with static graphical elements, use a generative AI model to *inpaint* the artifact area with content that realistically extends the surrounding scene. The system will dynamically analyze the error area and generate plausible content, seamlessly blending it into the video feed.

**Specifications:**

**1. Error Analysis Module:**

   *   **Input:** Video data from two cameras (Camera 1, Camera 2), Error Map (output from existing artifact detection – thresholding determines artifact location).
   *   **Processing:**
        *   Refine Error Map: Employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on artifact examples to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
        *   Contextual Analysis: Analyze surrounding pixels within a defined radius of the artifact to determine scene elements (e.g., sky, grass, buildings, faces).
        *   Semantic Segmentation: Perform semantic segmentation on the surrounding context to identify objects and their boundaries.
   *   **Output:** Refined Error Map, Semantic Segmentation Map, Contextual Feature Vector.

**2. Generative AI Inpainting Module:**

   *   **Model:** Utilize a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Diffusion Model pre-trained on a large dataset of diverse images and videos.  Specifically, a video diffusion model is preferred for temporal consistency.
   *   **Input:**  Error Map, Semantic Segmentation Map, Contextual Feature Vector, Frames from Camera 1 & Camera 2.
   *   **Processing:**
        *   Mask Creation: Generate a precise mask based on the Error Map.
        *   Contextual Prompting:  Combine Semantic Segmentation data with Contextual Feature Vector to create a prompt for the generative model. (e.g., “Generate realistic sky texture with fluffy clouds” or “Extend the brick wall texture”).
        *   Inpainting:  The generative model inpaints the masked area with content generated based on the prompt and surrounding image data.  Temporal smoothing filters are applied to ensure video consistency across frames.
   *   **Output:** Inpainted Frame.

**3. Blending and Compositing Module:**

   *   **Input:** Original Frame (Camera 1/2), Inpainted Frame.
   *   **Processing:**
        *   Multi-Resolution Blending: Employ a Laplacian pyramid blending technique to seamlessly blend the inpainted region with the original frame.  Adaptive blending weights are determined based on the error magnitude and surrounding image gradients.
        *   Color Correction: Apply color correction algorithms to match the color and brightness of the inpainted region to the surrounding area.
        *   Temporal Filtering: Apply temporal filtering to reduce flickering and ensure smooth transitions between frames.
   *   **Output:** Final Composed Frame.

**4. System Architecture:**

   *   **Hardware:**  GPU-accelerated processing unit for real-time performance.
   *   **Software:** Python-based framework with TensorFlow/PyTorch for AI model implementation.
   *   **Data Pipeline:**  Efficient data pipeline for processing video frames and feeding them into the AI models.

**Pseudocode (Inpainting Module):**

```
function inpaint(error_map, semantic_map, context_vector, frame):
  mask = generate_mask(error_map)
  prompt = create_prompt(semantic_map, context_vector)
  inpainted_frame = generative_model(frame, mask, prompt)
  return inpainted_frame
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static masking by leveraging the power of generative AI to create more realistic and visually pleasing results. The dynamic adaptation to scene context ensures that the inpainted areas seamlessly blend into the video, improving the overall viewing experience.  It also allows the system to learn and improve over time, generating increasingly realistic content.
