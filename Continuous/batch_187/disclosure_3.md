## Dynamic Rule Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the weights of individual rule conditions within the duplicate detection rule set, leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent.

**Rationale:** The patent describes a genetic algorithm for *creating* rules. Once created, those rules are static. Real-world data drifts. Conditions that were once highly predictive may become less so over time, and vice-versa. A dynamic weighting system allows the rule set to adapt to changing data characteristics without requiring a full regeneration cycle.

**Components:**

1.  **Environment:** The environment is the incoming stream of item description data to be checked for duplicates. Each data pair presented to the system is labeled as either "duplicate" or "not duplicate" by a human or a reliable ground truth source.

2.  **State:** The state representation for the RL agent consists of:
    *   The current weights assigned to each rule condition.
    *   Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) observed over a recent window of data pairs.
    *   Data characteristics (e.g., average string length, frequency of specific keywords) within the recent data window.

3.  **Action:** The action space consists of discrete adjustments to the weights of individual rule conditions.  Actions could include:
    *   Increase weight of condition X by delta.
    *   Decrease weight of condition X by delta.
    *   No change to condition X.

4.  **Reward:** The reward function is designed to incentivize improvements in duplicate detection accuracy. A possible reward function:

    *   If the system correctly identifies a duplicate: +1
    *   If the system incorrectly identifies a duplicate (false positive): -0.5
    *   If the system misses a duplicate (false negative): -1
    *   A small penalty for excessive weight changes (to promote stability).

5.  **RL Agent:** A Q-learning or Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent is trained to select actions (weight adjustments) that maximize the cumulative reward. The agent learns which weight adjustments lead to improved performance on the incoming data stream.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
rule_set = {rule1, rule2, ...} // Rules from patent's GA
condition_weights = {condition1: 1.0, condition2: 1.0, ...} // Initial weights
RL_agent = initialize_RL_agent()

// Main Loop
for each data_pair in data_stream:
    // Calculate weighted score for data_pair
    score = calculate_weighted_score(data_pair, rule_set, condition_weights)

    // Determine if duplicate based on score and threshold
    is_duplicate = (score > threshold)

    // Get feedback (ground truth)
    ground_truth = get_ground_truth(data_pair)

    // Calculate reward
    reward = calculate_reward(is_duplicate, ground_truth)

    // Observe state (current weights, performance metrics, data characteristics)
    state = observe_state(condition_weights, performance_metrics, data_characteristics)

    // Choose action (weight adjustment) using RL agent
    action = RL_agent.choose_action(state)

    // Apply action (adjust weights)
    condition_weights = apply_action(condition_weights, action)

    // Update RL agent with reward and new state
    RL_agent.update(state, action, reward, observe_state(condition_weights, performance_metrics, data_characteristics))

    // Update performance metrics
    performance_metrics = update_performance_metrics(is_duplicate, ground_truth)
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The `calculate_weighted_score` function should combine the results of individual rule conditions, weighted by their corresponding weights.
*   The threshold for determining a duplicate should be tuned based on the desired balance between precision and recall.
*   The learning rate and exploration parameters of the RL agent should be carefully tuned to ensure stable learning and effective exploration.
*   Consider using a replay buffer to store past experiences and improve the efficiency of the RL agent.
*   Regularly retrain the RL agent with new data to adapt to evolving data patterns.
