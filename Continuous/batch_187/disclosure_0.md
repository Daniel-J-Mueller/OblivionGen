## Dynamic Document Reconstruction with Contextual Embedding

**Concept:** Extend the segment classification and analysis to actively *reconstruct* the document's original structure and intent, even if the input is heavily fragmented or degraded. This goes beyond simply extracting data *from* segments to rebuilding the document *as* a structured object.

**Specification:**

**1. Input:** Degraded or fragmented document (image, PDF, mixed format).

**2. Core Module: Contextual Embedding Engine**

   *   **a. Segment Identification & Feature Extraction:**  Utilizes existing ML models for segment identification (form, receipt, paragraph, table, etc.) and extracts relevant features (text, position, font, image data).
   *   **b. Embedding Generation:**  Each segment is converted into a high-dimensional vector embedding using a transformer-based model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).  This embedding captures the semantic meaning of the segment *and* its visual features.
   *   **c. Relational Graph Construction:**  A graph is constructed where each node represents a segment, and edges represent relationships between segments. Edge weights are determined by:
        *   **Semantic Similarity:**  Calculated from the cosine similarity between segment embeddings.
        *   **Spatial Proximity:** Based on the relative position of segments in the original document.
        *   **Visual Continuity:**  Analyzes visual cues (lines, borders, alignment) to detect connections.
   *   **d. Graph Refinement:** A graph neural network (GNN) is used to refine the graph by:
        *   **Edge Prediction:**  Predicting missing edges based on node features and existing graph structure.
        *   **Edge Weight Adjustment:**  Adjusting edge weights to reflect the strength of the relationship.
        *   **Node Merging:**  Merging nodes that represent the same logical unit (e.g., two adjacent text fragments that belong to the same paragraph).

**3. Document Reconstruction Module:**

   *   **a. Layout Prediction:**  A separate model predicts the original layout of the document based on the refined graph. This could include predicting the location of paragraphs, tables, images, and other elements.
   *   **b. Structural Alignment:**  The predicted layout is aligned with the extracted segments.
   *   **c. Content Assembly:** The segments are assembled into a structured document based on the predicted layout. This could involve:
        *   **Text Reconstruction:**  Reconstructing fragmented text based on semantic similarity and spatial proximity.
        *   **Table Reconstruction:** Reconstructing tables from fragmented cells and headers.
        *   **Image Placement:**  Placing images in their original locations.

**4. Output:** A reconstructed document in a structured format (e.g., HTML, Markdown, JSON).

**Pseudocode (Key Section: Graph Refinement):**

```python
def refine_graph(graph, node_embeddings, spatial_data):
  """Refines a document segment graph using node embeddings and spatial data."""

  # Edge Prediction (using GNN)
  gnn_model = GNNModel()  # Initialize GNN model
  predicted_edges = gnn_model.predict_edges(graph, node_embeddings)

  # Add predicted edges to the graph
  for edge in predicted_edges:
    graph.add_edge(edge[0], edge[1], weight=0.5) # Initial weight

  # Edge Weight Adjustment (based on embeddings and spatial data)
  for edge in graph.edges:
    node1, node2 = edge.nodes
    embedding_similarity = cosine_similarity(node_embeddings[node1], node_embeddings[node2])
    spatial_proximity = calculate_spatial_proximity(node1, node2, spatial_data)
    edge.weight = 0.6 * embedding_similarity + 0.4 * spatial_proximity

  # Node Merging (based on embedding similarity)
  threshold = 0.95
  nodes_to_merge = []
  for i in range(len(graph.nodes)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(graph.nodes)):
      similarity = cosine_similarity(node_embeddings[i], node_embeddings[j])
      if similarity > threshold:
        nodes_to_merge.append((i, j))

  for pair in nodes_to_merge:
    node1, node2 = pair
    # Merge node2 into node1 (update node1's content, connections, etc.)
    merge_nodes(node1, node2, graph)

  return graph
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Processing damaged or incomplete documents.
*   Reconstructing documents from multiple sources.
*   Improving the accuracy of information extraction.
*   Creating more structured and accessible documents.
