## Adaptive Granularity Data Partitioning & Federated Meta-Learning

**Concept:** Extend the divide-and-conquer approach to dynamically adjust data partitioning granularity *during* model training, combined with a federated meta-learning layer to improve generalization across diverse data subsets. The current patent focuses on static division. This adapts.

**Motivation:** The static division may not be optimal for datasets with varying density or inherent structure. Some subsets may benefit from finer granularity, while others are better suited to coarser divisions.  Furthermore, combining locally trained models *without* further learning can lead to suboptimal overall performance, especially when the data distribution varies significantly across subsets.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Profiler Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw ordinal data, target variable.
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate data density metrics (e.g., number of samples per unit volume in a feature space).
    *   Calculate feature importance scores for each subset of data.
    *   Identify clusters of data points based on similarity in feature space.
*   **Output:**  Data profile containing density map, feature importance scores, and cluster assignments.  This profile is updated *during* training.

**2. Dynamic Partitioning Engine:**

*   **Input:** Data profile, number of available computing resources, a “granularity factor” (configurable hyperparameter, 0.0 – 1.0.  0.0 = coarsest, 1.0 = finest).
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on data density and feature importance, recursively split data subsets until the target granularity is reached, or a minimum subset size is met.  High-density, high-importance regions are split more aggressively.
    *   Assign data subsets to available computing resources, balancing workload and minimizing communication overhead.
*   **Output:**  Dynamically partitioned data subsets assigned to computing resources.

**3. Local Training Modules (identical across resources):**

*   **Input:** Data subset, model architecture (defined in Meta-Learner).
*   **Process:**  Trains the model on the assigned data subset using a variant of the logistic regression outlined in the patent claims (can be adjusted via the Meta-Learner).
*   **Output:** Trained local model weights.

**4. Federated Meta-Learner Module:**

*   **Input:** Local model weights from all resources.
*   **Process:**
    *   Implements a meta-learning algorithm (e.g., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning – MAML) to learn how to *quickly adapt* the locally trained models to new data subsets.
    *   Maintains a global model that captures the shared knowledge across all local models.
    *   Periodically updates the global model based on the performance of the local models on a validation set.
    *   Broadcasts updated global model parameters to all local training modules, guiding the training process.
*   **Output:**  Optimized global model.

**Pseudocode (Federated Meta-Learner):**

```
// Initialization
global_model = initialize_model()
local_models = []

// Training Loop
for each training iteration:
  for each resource:
    local_model = train_local_model(resource.data, global_model)
    local_models.append(local_model)

  // Aggregate local models using meta-learning
  meta_gradients = compute_meta_gradients(local_models)
  global_model = update_global_model(global_model, meta_gradients)

  // Broadcast updated global model to all resources
```

**5. Monitoring & Adjustment:**

*   Continuously monitor data density and model performance on each subset.
*   Adjust the granularity factor and partitioning strategy dynamically based on observed performance.
*   Implement a “drift detection” mechanism to identify changes in data distribution and trigger re-partitioning.



This system aims to go beyond static partitioning by making the division of labor adaptive and leverages a meta-learning layer to combine the insights of those divisions in a way which promotes broader utility and avoids the pitfalls of a static solution.
