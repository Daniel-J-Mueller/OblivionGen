## Dynamic Contextual Weighting for Literary Analysis

**System Overview:**

A system designed to dynamically adjust the 'significance value' (as described in the patent) of words and stems based on contextual information *beyond* simple corpus frequency. It leverages external knowledge bases and real-time information to improve mismatch detection accuracy.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Contextual Analyzer:** This module analyzes both the description and the content for semantic context. It utilizes:
    *   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Connects to knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia) to identify entities, relationships, and concepts within the text.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determines the emotional tone and subjective opinions expressed.
    *   **Topic Modeling:** Extracts dominant themes and subject areas.
    *   **Temporal Analysis:** Identifies dates, time periods, and historical references.

2.  **Dynamic Weighting Engine:** Based on the Contextual Analyzer’s output, this engine dynamically adjusts the significance value of words/stems. 

    *   **Relevance Scoring:** Assigns a relevance score to each word/stem based on its contextual importance. Factors contributing to the score:
        *   **Entity Type:**  Proper nouns (characters, places) receive higher weights.
        *   **Relationship Strength:** Words connecting key entities are weighted higher.
        *   **Sentiment Polarity:** Words contributing to the overall sentiment are amplified.
        *   **Temporal Proximity:** Words related to specific time periods gain weight if the work is historically situated.
        *   **Novelty/Rarity:** Less frequent terms are elevated.
    *   **Weight Adjustment Function:**
        ```
        adjusted_significance = base_significance * (1 + relevance_score * weighting_factor)
        ```
        Where:
        *   `base_significance` is the original significance value.
        *   `relevance_score` is calculated by the Contextual Analyzer.
        *   `weighting_factor` is a tunable parameter controlling the impact of contextual relevance.

3.  **Adaptive Learning Module:** Continuously learns from user feedback (e.g., confirmed mismatches, corrected descriptions) to refine the relevance scoring and weighting functions.

**Pseudocode for Matching Score Calculation:**

```
function calculate_matching_score(description, content):
    description_words = tokenize(description)
    content_words = tokenize(content)
    matching_score = 0

    for desc_word in description_words:
        adjusted_significance = get_adjusted_significance(desc_word, description, content)
        if desc_word in content_words:
            matching_score += adjusted_significance
        else:
            matching_score -= adjusted_significance

    # Incorporate Name Entity analysis (as in the patent) – omitted for brevity

    return matching_score
```
