## Temporal Data Reconstruction via Versioned Shadowing

**Concept:** Extend the versioning system to not only track deletions (logical or otherwise) but to actively reconstruct data states at *any* point in its history, even beyond explicitly stored versions.  This goes beyond simple rollback; it aims for granular, continuous reconstruction.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on deletion markers.  What if, instead of just *marking* deletion, we used that information, combined with existing version data, to algorithmically *reconstruct* previous data states?  This unlocks powerful auditing, forensic analysis, and "what-if" scenarios.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Copies & Delta Encoding:**  Alongside standard versioned objects, create “shadow copies” derived from the delta between versions. These shadows are significantly smaller than full versions, storing only changes.  These are not immediately accessible; they require reconstruction.

2.  **Reconstruction Engine:** Implement a Reconstruction Engine.  Input: object name, target timestamp.  Process:
    *   Identify the latest version *prior* to the target timestamp.
    *   Iteratively apply shadow copies created *after* that version, *up to* the target timestamp.  This builds a complete data state at the desired moment.
    *   Cache reconstructed states (configurable TTL).

3.  **Timestamp Granularity:** Support configurable timestamp granularity (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds).  Finer granularity increases storage needs, but provides more precise reconstruction.

4.  **Reconstruction Prioritization:** Implement a queueing system for reconstruction requests. Prioritize requests based on user/application, urgency, and data sensitivity.

5.  **Metadata Index:** Maintain an index mapping version identifiers to shadow copy data locations and timestamps.

6.  **Data Integrity Checks:** Implement checksums and data verification routines throughout the reconstruction process to ensure data integrity.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Engine):**

```
FUNCTION reconstructData(objectName, targetTimestamp)
  latestVersionBeforeTarget = findLatestVersion(objectName, targetTimestamp)
  IF latestVersionBeforeTarget == NULL
    RETURN error("No data found before target timestamp")
  ENDIF

  reconstructedData = loadData(latestVersionBeforeTarget)

  shadowCopies = findShadowCopies(latestVersionBeforeTarget, targetTimestamp)

  FOR EACH shadowCopy IN shadowCopies
    IF shadowCopy.timestamp <= targetTimestamp
      reconstructedData = applyDelta(reconstructedData, shadowCopy.data)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  RETURN reconstructedData
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION applyDelta(baseData, deltaData)
  // Algorithm to apply delta data to base data
  // This will vary depending on the delta encoding scheme used
  // (e.g., binary diff, rsync-like algorithm)
  // Returns the updated data
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Example Scenario:**

A compliance audit requires determining the value of a specific data field as it existed on January 1st, 2023 at 10:30 AM. The Reconstruction Engine, given the object name and timestamp, reconstructs the data state from the base version and applies relevant shadow copies, providing an accurate snapshot of the data at that precise moment. This eliminates the need to painstakingly sift through archived versions.
