## Dynamic Skill Chaining with Predictive Action Suggestions

**Concept:** Expand the interactive content framework to allow for *predictive* chaining of skills based on contextual analysis of user interaction *before* explicit requests are made. Instead of waiting for a spoken input after interactive content is presented, the system proactively suggests potential actions or follow-up skills based on the content and inferred user intent.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Intent Engine:**

*   **Input:** Audio data (user speech), ASR data, NLU data, output data from the first skill, user account data, historical interaction data (for this user, and aggregated anonymized data).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Utilize a transformer-based model trained on a large corpus of conversational data and skill metadata.
    *   Analyze the semantic meaning of the currently presented content (the "second content" in the patent).
    *   Infer potential user intents *beyond* direct requests. For example, if the second content is a restaurant review, potential intents might be: "make a reservation," "get directions," "see the menu," "read more reviews," or "find similar restaurants."
    *   Rank these potential intents based on probability.
    *   Generate a "suggestion vector" representing the top N potential intents and associated skill requirements.
*   **Output:** Suggestion vector, confidence score for each suggestion.

**2. Predictive UI Component (Device-Side):**

*   **Input:** Suggestion vector from the Contextual Intent Engine.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Dynamically generate a UI overlay (visual, auditory, or haptic) presenting the top N suggestions to the user.  This could be as simple as a row of icons representing available actions, or more sophisticated such as a context-aware voice prompt ("You can also reserve a table, get directions, or see the menu.").
    *   Prioritize UI elements based on confidence scores.
    *   Implement a “quick action” mechanism – allowing the user to activate a suggestion with a single tap/voice command, bypassing the need for a full spoken request.
*   **Output:** Interactive UI overlay.

**3. Skill Orchestration Module (Server-Side):**

*   **Input:** User selection from the Predictive UI Component (or, if no selection, a standard spoken request).
*   **Processing:**
    *   If a suggestion was selected, directly invoke the corresponding skill without further NLU processing.
    *   If a standard spoken request was received, process it as before.
    *   Implement a "skill chaining" mechanism - allowing skills to hand off control to other skills in a pre-defined or dynamically determined sequence. For example, if the user makes a reservation, the system could automatically suggest “Would you like me to add this to your calendar?” and invoke a calendar skill.
*   **Output:** Invoked skill, associated data.

**Pseudocode (Skill Orchestration Module):**

```
function handleUserInput(userInput, userSelection):
  if userSelection is not null:
    skill = getSkillForSuggestion(userSelection)
    invokeSkill(skill, userInput)
  else:
    intent = analyzeIntent(userInput)
    skill = getSkillForIntent(intent)
    invokeSkill(skill, userInput)
    if skill supports chaining:
      nextSkill = skill.suggestNextSkill()
      if nextSkill is not null:
        promptUserForChaining(nextSkill)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond *reactive* interaction to *proactive* assistance. It anticipates user needs based on content and context, streamlining the experience and reducing friction. The dynamic skill chaining and predictive UI component create a more fluid and intuitive interaction model.
