## Personalized Event "Rewind & Remix"

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply replaying a stream from a specific point. Allow users to dynamically "rewind & remix" events within a media stream, creating personalized highlight reels or alternate viewing experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Data Structure:** Event Timeline. The system maintains a detailed timeline for each analyzed stream, segmented by detected "events of interest" (as defined by the existing patent’s analysis – audio, video, metadata). Each event has associated metadata: start/end timestamps, event type (goal, penalty, exciting speech, visual cue), confidence score, and raw data snippets (short video/audio clips).
*   **User Interface - "Event Palette":** A dedicated UI element (accessible overlay or separate screen) displaying detected events as visually distinct "palette" elements.  Elements are ordered chronologically.  Users can:
    *   **Select/Deselect Events:** Choose which events to include/exclude in a personalized remix.
    *   **Adjust Event "Weight":**  A slider control allows users to prioritize certain event types (e.g., emphasize goals over penalties in a sports stream).
    *   **"Remix Style" Presets:** Offer pre-defined remix styles (e.g., "Fast-Paced Highlights," "Detailed Analysis," "Emotional Rollercoaster").  These presets automatically adjust event weighting and transition styles.
*   **Dynamic Stream Recomposition:**
    *   **Seamless Transitions:** Implement smooth transitions between selected event segments. Transitions can be customized (fade, cut, wipe, zoom) and dynamically adjusted based on event type and user preference.
    *   **Contextual Padding:**  Add a short buffer (configurable by the user) of content *before* and *after* each selected event to provide context.
    *   **AI-Driven Content Fill:** For significant gaps between events, employ AI to generate short, relevant content (e.g., stat overlays, expert commentary snippets sourced from other streams, relevant background music).
*   **Personalized Viewing Modes:**
    *   **"Remix Playback":** Play the recomposed stream with the selected events and transitions.
    *   **"Event Focus":** Isolate a single event and view it repeatedly with different camera angles (if available) and analysis overlays.
    *   **"Timeline Scrubbing":** Visually scrub through the event timeline to quickly find specific moments.
*   **Sharing & Social Integration:**  Allow users to share their personalized remixes with friends or on social media platforms.

**Pseudocode (Stream Recomposition Engine):**

```
function recomposeStream(streamURL, selectedEvents, eventWeighting, transitionStyle, paddingDuration) {

    eventTimeline = getEventTimeline(streamURL)  // Retrieve from system cache or analyze live

    recomposedSegments = []
    currentTime = 0

    for each event in selectedEvents {

        eventStart = eventTimeline.getEventStartTime(event)
        eventEnd = eventTimeline.getEventEndTime(event)

        // Add padding before the event
        padStart = max(0, eventStart - paddingDuration)
        recomposedSegments.push({
            start: padStart,
            end: eventStart,
            type: "padding"
        })

        // Add the event segment
        recomposedSegments.push({
            start: eventStart,
            end: eventEnd,
            type: "event"
        })

        // Add padding after the event
        padEnd = min(streamDuration, eventEnd + paddingDuration)
        recomposedSegments.push({
            start: eventEnd,
            end: padEnd,
            type: "padding"
        })

    }
   //Sort by start time
    recomposedSegments.sort(function(a, b){return a.start - b.start});

    //Stream recomposition logic
    recomposedStream = createRecomposedStream(streamURL, recomposedSegments, transitionStyle);

    return recomposedStream;
}
