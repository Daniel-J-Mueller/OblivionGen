## Adaptive Event Granularity & Predictive Error Masking

**Concept:** The core idea stems from the patent's focus on event-driven synchronization, but expands it to dynamically adjust the granularity of events *and* proactively mask potential errors *before* they propagate, utilizing a prediction engine.

**Specification:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Event Granularity Controller (EGC):** A dedicated hardware module per processing engine. Configurable to define event granularity â€“ from single-instruction events to larger blocks of operations.  Uses a lookup table (LUT) based on observed execution patterns and/or compiler hints.
*   **Execution Pattern Monitor (EPM):**  Continuously monitors execution flow, identifying frequently occurring sequences of instructions/operations. Stores these patterns in a local cache.
*   **Predictive Error Engine (PEE):** A lightweight neural network (e.g., a small LSTM) trained on historical execution data (including error logs) associated with the processing engine.  Receives input from the EPM and EGC.
*   **Error Mask Register (EMR):**  A bitfield per processing engine. Bits are set by the PEE indicating a potential error in a subsequent operation. The EMR acts as a filter, suppressing error reporting for anticipated issues.
*   **Event Buffer:**  Increased capacity event buffer, allowing for more fine-grained event logging.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Dynamic Granularity Profiler:** A compiler component that analyzes the code and suggests initial granularity settings for events. It also provides hints to the runtime system about potential error sources.
*   **Runtime Adaptation Manager:** Monitors the EPM and PEE outputs. Dynamically adjusts event granularity based on performance and error rate.
*   **Error Mask Training Module:** Off-chip module that receives execution logs and trains the PEE. Training data includes both successful and erroneous executions.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initialization:** The Dynamic Granularity Profiler generates initial granularity settings based on the code. The Runtime Adaptation Manager initializes the EPM and PEE.
2.  **Execution:**
    *   The processing engine executes instructions.
    *   The EPM monitors execution patterns and updates its local cache.
    *   The PEE analyzes execution patterns and predicts potential errors.
    *   If a potential error is predicted, the PEE sets the corresponding bit in the EMR.
    *   Event triggering occurs based on the current granularity settings.
3.  **Error Handling:**
    *   If an error occurs, the error handler checks the EMR.
    *   If the corresponding bit is set in the EMR, the error is suppressed (masked).
    *   If the bit is not set, the error is reported and handled normally.
4.  **Adaptive Adjustment:**
    *   The Runtime Adaptation Manager periodically analyzes performance and error rates.
    *   Based on this analysis, it adjusts event granularity (coarser or finer) to optimize performance and reduce error reporting.

**4. Pseudocode (Runtime Adaptation Manager):**

```pseudocode
function adaptGranularity(performanceData, errorRate) {
  if (errorRate > threshold) {
    // Increase event granularity (finer) to provide more detailed error information
    currentGranularity = min(maxGranularity, currentGranularity + 1)
  } else if (performanceData.latency > targetLatency) {
    // Reduce event granularity (coarser) to improve performance
    currentGranularity = max(minGranularity, currentGranularity - 1)
  }

  // Update EGC with new granularity setting
  EGC.setGranularity(currentGranularity)
}

function trainPredictiveEngine(executionLog) {
  // Extract execution patterns and error information from log
  patterns = extractPatterns(executionLog)
  errors = extractErrors(executionLog)

  // Train PEE using patterns and errors
  PEE.train(patterns, errors)
}
```

**5. Novelty & Potential:**

This approach differs from the source patent by *proactively* addressing errors *before* they manifest, and by *dynamically* adjusting the granularity of events based on runtime conditions. This could lead to significantly improved performance, reduced debugging time, and increased system reliability.  The predictive engine enables a more intelligent and adaptable error handling mechanism, going beyond simple error detection and masking.
