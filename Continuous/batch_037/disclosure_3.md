## Dynamic Storage Remapping via Predictive Wear

**Concept:** Instead of solely tracking 'dirtied' blocks for wiping/verification, proactively remap blocks based on predicted wear patterns, creating a constantly shifting storage landscape. This introduces an additional layer of security and extends storage lifespan.

**Specs:**

**1. Wear Prediction Engine:**

*   **Data Input:** Read/Write access patterns, temperature sensor data (SSD specific), error logs, block age (time since last write).
*   **Algorithm:**  Machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network or LSTM) trained on historical data to predict block failure probability within a defined timeframe.
*   **Output:**  'Wear Score' assigned to each block, representing its predicted remaining lifespan.  Score updated continuously.

**2. Dynamic Remapping Controller:**

*   **Trigger Threshold:**  Wear Score falls below a configurable threshold.
*   **Remapping Process:**
    *   Identify a 'healthy' block with sufficient free space.
    *   Copy data from the nearing-failure block to the healthy block.
    *   Update storage mapping tables (filesystem/controller level).
    *   Mark the original block as 'reserved' for potential use in a wear-leveling scheme, or for secure wiping (see Secure Wipe Integration).
*   **Background Operation:** Remapping is performed in the background during periods of low activity, minimizing performance impact. Prioritization scheme based on data criticality.

**3. Secure Wipe Integration:**

*   **Reserved Block Pool:**  Reserved blocks (from the Dynamic Remapping Controller) are accumulated.
*   **Secure Wipe Trigger:** Based on security policy (e.g., system shutdown, user request).
*   **Wipe Process:**  Reserved blocks are subjected to multiple pass overwrites (or cryptographic erasure) *before* being returned to the free block pool. This ensures any residual data is securely removed.
*   **Verification:** Post-wipe verification using established methods (e.g., read-back and compare).

**4.  Metadata & Logging:**

*   **Wear Score Logs:** Maintain a historical log of Wear Scores for each block, enabling trend analysis and model refinement.
*   **Remapping Events:** Log all remapping events, including source/destination blocks, timestamps, and reason for remapping.
*   **Secure Wipe Logs:** Record all secure wipe operations, including timestamps, block ranges, and verification results.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Remapping Controller - Simplified):**

```
// Every X seconds (configurable):
FOR EACH block IN storage:
    WearScore = WearPredictionEngine.CalculateWearScore(block)
    IF WearScore < Threshold:
        HealthyBlock = FindHealthyBlock() // With sufficient space
        CopyData(block, HealthyBlock)
        UpdateMappingTable(block, HealthyBlock)
        MarkBlockReserved(block)
        LogRemappingEvent(block, HealthyBlock)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Proactive data migration and secure wiping of potentially compromised blocks.
*   **Increased Storage Lifespan:**  Reduces wear on failing blocks, extending the overall lifespan of the storage device.
*   **Improved Data Reliability:**  Minimizes the risk of data loss due to block failures.
*   **Adaptability:** The predictive model can be retrained and adapted to different workloads and storage technologies.
