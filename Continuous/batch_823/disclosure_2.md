## Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph Augmentation with Dynamic Schema Generation

**Concept:** Extend the cross-lingual similarity system by grounding entity records within a dynamically generated, multi-modal knowledge graph. This allows for reasoning *about* entities, not just similarity *between* them, unlocking more sophisticated downstream tasks.

**Specification:**

**I. Knowledge Graph Generation & Schema:**

1.  **Dynamic Schema Discovery:** Instead of a predefined schema, the system automatically discovers relationships and attributes by analyzing the language-agnostic embeddings (from the hierarchical embedding model in the base patent) *and* any available non-text attributes.  This is achieved using a clustering algorithm (e.g., HDBSCAN) on the embedding space. Clusters represent potential entity types.  Distances between cluster centroids suggest relationships.
2.  **Relationship Inference:**  A dedicated ‘relationship inference module’ analyzes paired entity embeddings (from the labeled cross-language data set) and calculates a 'relationship score' based on the cosine similarity of their embeddings. High scores suggest a direct relationship.  This score is thresholded to create edges in the knowledge graph.  Edge types are inferred from the context of the relationship (e.g., ‘is a’, ‘part of’, ‘related to’).
3.  **Multi-Modality Integration:** Non-text attributes are incorporated as additional nodes and edges within the knowledge graph.  For instance, an entity representing a ‘product’ might have nodes for ‘price’, ‘manufacturer’, ‘release date’, connected via edges labeled ‘hasPrice’, ‘manufacturedBy’, ‘releasedOn’. These non-text nodes are also assigned language-agnostic embeddings (using a separate encoder network trained on non-text data).
4. **Graph Database:**  Utilize a graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) to store and query the knowledge graph.

**II.  Augmented Similarity Scoring:**

1.  **Path-Based Similarity:** The similarity score between two entities is *no longer solely* based on their direct embedding similarity.  Instead, a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., shortest path, personalized PageRank) identifies paths connecting the two entities in the knowledge graph. 
2.  **Path Weighting:**  Each path is weighted based on:
    *   Edge types (relationships deemed more important receive higher weights).
    *   Edge weights (reflecting the initial relationship scores).
    *   Path length (shorter paths are preferred).
3.  **Combined Score:** The final similarity score is a weighted combination of the direct embedding similarity (from the base patent) and the highest-scoring path similarity found in the knowledge graph.

**III. System Architecture & Pseudocode**

```pseudocode
// Input: Labeled Cross-Language Data Set, Multi-Language Entity Records, Non-Text Attributes

// Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Construction
function build_knowledge_graph(data_set, records, attributes):
  // 1. Generate Language-Agnostic Embeddings (using Hierarchical Embedding Model from base patent)
  embeddings = generate_embeddings(records)

  // 2. Cluster Embeddings to Discover Entity Types
  entity_types = cluster_embeddings(embeddings, clustering_algorithm="HDBSCAN")

  // 3. Infer Relationships from Paired Entity Embeddings
  relationships = infer_relationships(embeddings, threshold=0.7)

  // 4. Incorporate Non-Text Attributes as Nodes/Edges
  non_text_nodes = encode_non_text_attributes(attributes)

  // 5. Build Graph Database
  graph_db = create_graph_database(entity_types, relationships, non_text_nodes)
  return graph_db

// Phase 2: Augmented Similarity Scoring
function augmented_similarity(entity1, entity2, graph_db):
  // 1. Get Embeddings for Entity1 and Entity2
  embedding1 = get_embedding(entity1)
  embedding2 = get_embedding(entity2)

  // 2. Calculate Direct Embedding Similarity
  direct_similarity = cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)

  // 3. Find Paths Between Entity1 and Entity2 in the Graph Database
  paths = find_paths(entity1, entity2, graph_db)

  // 4. Calculate Path Similarity (weighted sum of edge types/weights/path length)
  path_similarity = calculate_path_similarity(paths)

  // 5. Combine Direct and Path Similarity (weighted average)
  final_similarity = (0.6 * direct_similarity) + (0.4 * path_similarity)

  return final_similarity
```

**IV.  Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Graph Updates:** Continuously update the knowledge graph as new data becomes available.
*   **Reasoning Capabilities:**  Implement rule-based reasoning or neural network-based inference to derive new knowledge from the graph.
*   **Explainable AI:** Provide explanations for similarity scores based on the paths and relationships found in the graph.
