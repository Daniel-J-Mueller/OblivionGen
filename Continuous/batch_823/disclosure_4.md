## Dynamic Dependency Mapping & Automated Rollback for Test Stack Creation

**Concept:** Extend the VPC-based test stack creation to incorporate real-time dependency mapping of services *during* launch, coupled with automated rollback to a known-good state if dependency resolution fails. This goes beyond simply verifying a service is ‘healthy’ – it actively builds a dependency graph as services come online, and reacts to failures in a nuanced way.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Mapping Agent (DMA):**

*   **Deployment:** Each virtual computing device (VCD) within the VPC runs a DMA.
*   **Function:** The DMA passively monitors network traffic *from* its VCD. It identifies outbound connections (TCP/UDP) and attempts to resolve the service name/identifier associated with the destination IP address/port. Resolution methods include:
    *   DNS lookups.
    *   Service discovery mechanisms (e.g., Consul, etcd).
    *   Internal service registry lookups.
    *   Heuristic analysis of traffic patterns.
*   **Output:**  The DMA periodically reports a list of dependencies (service name/ID -> IP address/port) to a central Dependency Manager (DM).
*   **Data Format:** JSON: `[{ "service": "routing-service", "ip": "10.0.0.10", "port": 8080 }, ...]`

**2. Dependency Manager (DM):**

*   **Deployment:** A dedicated VCD within the VPC.
*   **Function:**
    *   Receives dependency reports from all DMAs.
    *   Constructs a dynamic dependency graph representing the relationships between services in the test stack.
    *   Maintains a "golden image" of the expected dependency graph for the test stack configuration.  This image is created during the initial launch of a known-good configuration.
    *   Compares the current dependency graph to the golden image.
    *   Initiates rollback procedures if significant deviations are detected.
*   **Rollback Trigger:** Deviation exceeding a configurable threshold (e.g., > 20% of dependencies missing or incorrect).
*   **Rollback Procedure:**
    *   Identifies the VCD(s) responsible for the failing dependencies.
    *   Restores those VCDs to a previous snapshot (using VM snapshots or container image rollbacks).
    *   Attempts to re-establish dependencies.
    *   Logs the rollback event and provides detailed diagnostics.

**3. Integration with Instance Deployment Manager (IDM):**

*   The IDM is modified to:
    *   Initiate the DM and DMA deployments as part of the test stack creation process.
    *   Monitor the DM for rollback events.
    *   Report rollback failures to the user.
    *   Allow configuration of the rollback threshold and snapshot retention policy.

**Pseudocode (DM):**

```
// Initialization
golden_image = load_golden_image()

// Main loop
while (true) {
  dependency_reports = receive_dependency_reports()
  current_graph = build_dependency_graph(dependency_reports)
  deviation = calculate_graph_deviation(current_graph, golden_image)

  if (deviation > threshold) {
    // Identify failing VCDs
    failing_vcds = identify_failing_vcds(current_graph, golden_image)

    // Initiate rollback
    rollback_vcds(failing_vcds)

    log_rollback_event(failing_vcds)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond simple service health checks. It actively maps dependencies *during* the launch process and reacts dynamically to failures, providing a much more robust and self-healing test stack environment. The golden image concept enables the DM to detect subtle deviations from the expected configuration, potentially catching issues that would otherwise go unnoticed.
