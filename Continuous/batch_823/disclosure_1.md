## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Ring

**Concept:** Expand on the gesture recognition and notification aspects of the ring-shaped device by integrating localized haptic feedback zones and adapting feedback patterns based on environmental audio analysis.

**Specifications:**

*   **Device Form Factor:** Ring, constructed from biocompatible, flexible materials. Internal space for miniaturized components.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Six independent, micro-eccentric rotating mass (ERM) haptic actuators embedded within the ring’s surface, spaced evenly around its circumference. Each actuator represents a distinct “zone”.
*   **Microphone Array:** Integrated 3-element microphone array for ambient audio capture.
*   **Audio Processing Unit:** Low-power DSP capable of real-time audio analysis (frequency spectrum, sound event detection).
*   **Wireless Communication:** Bluetooth 5.3 for connection to user device.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging via Qi standard. Battery life target: 24 hours.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Adaptive Haptic Profiles:** Algorithm to dynamically adjust haptic feedback intensity and pattern based on identified audio events. Examples:
        *   *Emergency Vehicle Siren:* Rapid, escalating vibration across all zones.
        *   *Phone Ringing:* Pulsating vibration on a designated zone.
        *   *Voice Command Confirmation:* Short, distinct vibration pattern.
        *   *Ambient Noise Level:* Adjust overall vibration intensity to remain noticeable without being intrusive.
    *   **Zone Customization:** User-configurable assignment of specific actions or notifications to each haptic zone.
    *   **“Haptic Compass” Mode:** Using the microphone array to identify sound sources. The haptic actuator closest to the identified sound source vibrates more strongly, acting as a directional indicator.
    *   **Gesture Learning:** Integrated machine learning to recognize new user-defined gestures beyond button presses.
    *   **User Device App:** For configuration, customization, and data logging.
*   **Sensor Suite:** 9-axis IMU for accurate gesture tracking.
*   **Materials:** Flexible PCB with durable, comfortable outer shell.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Logic):**

```
// Main loop
while (true) {
    // Capture audio data from microphone array
    audioData = captureAudio();

    // Analyze audio data
    audioAnalysis = analyzeAudio(audioData);

    // Detect audio events (siren, ringtone, voice command, etc.)
    event = detectEvent(audioAnalysis);

    if (event == "siren") {
        activateHapticPattern("emergency"); // Escalating vibration across all zones
    } else if (event == "ringtone") {
        activateHapticZone(designatedRingtoneZone, pulsatingPattern);
    } else if (event == "voice_command_confirmation") {
        activateHapticPattern("confirmation"); // Short, distinct vibration
    } else {
        // Adjust overall vibration intensity based on ambient noise level
        intensity = calculateIntensity(audioAnalysis.noiseLevel);
        applyGlobalIntensity(intensity);
    }
    //Process gesture data and trigger relevant action
    gesture = processGestureData();
    if (gesture == "swipe_left") {
        triggerAction("reject_call");
    }
    //Check for incoming notifications
    notification = getIncomingNotification();
    if(notification != null){
        activateHapticZone(designatedNotificationZone, notificationPattern);
    }
}
```

**Innovation:** Move beyond simple notifications and integrate real-time environmental awareness into the haptic feedback system, creating a more intuitive and contextually relevant user experience. The haptic compass adds a unique directional component, offering a new way to interact with the surrounding environment.
