**Adaptive Notification Haptics & Biofeedback Integration**

**Concept:** Extend contextual notification delivery beyond audio/visual cues by incorporating haptic feedback patterns tailored *not just* to device proximity/user activity, but also to real-time biometric data.

**Specifications:**

*   **Biometric Sensor Integration:** Support integration with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers) capable of measuring heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance (GSR), and potentially even subtle facial muscle movements (via miniature EMG sensors).
*   **Haptic Actuator Library:** Develop a library of nuanced haptic feedback patterns beyond simple vibration. Include varying intensity, frequency, rhythm, and potentially even localized thermal changes (if hardware allows).
*   **Contextual Mapping Engine:** Create an engine to map contextual data (location, device activity, user calendar, communication content) *and* biometric data to appropriate haptic feedback patterns.
    *   **HRV-Based Alert Escalation:** Low HRV (indicating stress/focus) could trigger more persistent/urgent haptic alerts. High HRV (relaxed state) could allow for more subtle, fleeting cues.
    *   **GSR-Based Attention Filtering:** If GSR spikes indicate heightened attention to a task, notifications are suppressed or delivered with minimal interruption.
    *   **Content-Aware Haptics:** Different communication types (urgent messages, social updates, reminders) have unique haptic signatures.  Use ML to detect the emotional tone of the message, and adjust haptics accordingly.
*   **Adaptive Learning Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm that learns user preferences for haptic feedback based on their interactions.  Users can provide explicit feedback ("too strong," "too disruptive," "perfect") or the system can infer preferences based on response times and interaction patterns.
*   **Multi-Device Synchronization:** Coordinate haptic feedback across multiple devices. For example, a smartwatch could provide a preliminary alert, followed by a more detailed haptic pattern on a phone as the user looks at it.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  All biometric data is processed locally on the device whenever possible.  If cloud processing is necessary, data must be encrypted and anonymized. User consent is required before collecting any biometric data.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Mapping Engine):**

```
function get_haptic_pattern(context_data, biometric_data):
  // context_data: Location, device activity, communication content
  // biometric_data: HRV, GSR

  // Basic context mapping
  if (context_data.location == "driving"):
    base_pattern = "minimal_alert"
  elif (context_data.communication_type == "urgent"):
    base_pattern = "priority_alert"
  else:
    base_pattern = "standard_alert"

  // Biometric adjustments
  if (biometric_data.HRV < threshold_low):
    intensity = "high"
    duration = "long"
  elif (biometric_data.GSR > threshold_high):
    suppress = True
  else:
    intensity = "medium"
    duration = "short"

  if (suppress):
    return "no_alert"

  // Combine context and biometric data
  final_pattern = {
    "pattern": base_pattern,
    "intensity": intensity,
    "duration": duration
  }

  return final_pattern
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Wearable device with HRV and GSR sensors.
*   Smartphone/tablet with advanced haptic engine.
*   Secure processing capabilities.
