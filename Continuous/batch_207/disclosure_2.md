## Secure Attestation & Dynamic Secret Provisioning via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Concept:** Extend the secure secrets management system by incorporating Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for application attestation and dynamic secret provisioning. This moves beyond simply validating a process state to establishing a cryptographically verifiable trust relationship *before* secret access is granted, and allows for fine-grained, time-limited access control.

**Specification:**

**1. DID/VC Integration:**

*   **Application Identity:** Each application requesting access to a secret is assigned a DID. This DID acts as its unique, verifiable identity.
*   **Attestation Process:** Before initial secret access, the application must prove ownership of its DID *and* attest to its current, trusted state. This is done by presenting a Verifiable Credential (VC) signed by a trusted issuer (e.g., a security authority, a platform administrator). The VC contains information about the application’s build, configuration, and integrity checks.
*   **VC Schema:**  Define a standardized VC schema that includes:
    *   `subject`: The application’s DID.
    *   `credentialSubject`: Metadata about the application (version, build hash, authorized runtime environment, security posture).
    *   `issuer`: The entity attesting to the application’s trustworthiness.
    *   `validFrom/validUntil`: Time window for VC validity.

**2. Secret Provisioning Workflow:**

*   **Initial Handshake:** Application presents its DID and VC to the controlling domain.
*   **VC Verification:** Controlling domain verifies the VC’s signature, issuer, validity period, and credential subject against a pre-defined trust policy.
*   **Dynamic Secret Generation/Retrieval:** If verification succeeds:
    *   The controlling domain generates a unique, short-lived secret (e.g., a randomly generated key or token) specifically for this application instance.
    *   Alternatively, the controlling domain retrieves an existing secret associated with the application's DID and authorized claims within the VC.
*   **Secret Delivery:** The secret is delivered to the application via a secure channel (e.g., TLS with mutual authentication).
*   **Ongoing Attestation:** Implement periodic re-attestation. The application must periodically present a fresh VC to prove its continued trustworthiness and re-authorize secret access. This combats potential runtime compromise.
*   **Revocation:** A mechanism for revoking access, utilizing DID revocation methods. The controlling domain monitors for DID revocation events and immediately invalidates any associated secrets.

**3. System Components:**

*   **DID Provider:** A service for managing DIDs and issuing VCs. This could be a decentralized network (e.g., using a blockchain) or a centralized authority.
*   **VC Validator:** A module within the controlling domain responsible for verifying VCs.
*   **Secret Management Service:**  Stores and manages secrets, associating them with DIDs and access policies.
*   **Attestation Agent:** A component running within the application responsible for obtaining and presenting VCs.

**4. Pseudocode (Simplified Secret Request Flow):**

```
// Application Side:
did = getApplicationDID()
vc = getVerifiableCredential() // Obtain from Attestation Agent

// Request to Controlling Domain
request = {
  did: did,
  vc: vc,
  secretIdentifier: "mySecret"
}

// Controlling Domain Side:
function handleSecretRequest(request) {
  did = request.did
  vc = request.vc
  secretIdentifier = request.secretIdentifier

  if (!verifyVC(vc)) {
    return error("Invalid VC")
  }

  secret = getSecret(secretIdentifier, did)

  if (secret == null) {
    return error("Secret not found")
  }

  return secret // Provide secret to application
}
```

**5.  Enhancements:**

*   **Selective Disclosure:** Applications can selectively disclose specific claims from their VC to minimize data exposure.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Utilize ZKPs to prove compliance with access policies without revealing the underlying data.
*   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Store and protect secrets within HSMs for enhanced security.
