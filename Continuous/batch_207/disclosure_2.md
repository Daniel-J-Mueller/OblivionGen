## Dynamic Constraint Tokens & Predictive Authorization

**Concept:** Extend the existing aggregate constraint system with *predictive* authorization based on user behavior and machine learning, and introduce dynamic tokens that *evolve* their constraints over time.

**Specs:**

**1. Dynamic Constraint Token Generation:**

*   **Input:** User profile data (purchase history, browsing behavior, stated preferences), time of day, day of week, external factors (e.g., sales events, holidays), initial constraint parameters (max cost, max quantity, time period).
*   **Process:**
    *   A machine learning model (trained on aggregated, anonymized user data) *predicts* future transaction patterns for the user. This generates a probability distribution for likely future purchases (price, quantity, category).
    *   Based on the predicted distribution, the system dynamically adjusts the initial constraint parameters to create a 'buffer' – increasing max cost or quantity slightly to anticipate legitimate purchases while still providing constraint protection. This 'buffer' amount is calculated based on a confidence interval derived from the predictive model.
    *   The system generates a unique, dynamically-encoded token containing the adjusted constraint parameters, a timestamp indicating token creation, and a 'decay rate'.
    *   The decay rate determines how quickly the constraint parameters 'erode' over time (see 'Token Decay' below).
*   **Output:** Dynamic Constraint Token (alphanumeric string encoding adjusted constraints, timestamp, decay rate).

**2. Token Decay:**

*   **Process:** A background service monitors active tokens.
    *   At regular intervals (e.g., hourly), the service calculates the remaining constraint values based on the token's timestamp, current time, and decay rate.  
    *   The decay rate is *not* linear. It is adaptive, increasing more rapidly when a high percentage of the original constraints have already been used, and slowing down when constraints are less utilized. (e.g. exponential decay with an adjustment factor).
    *   Each authorized transaction *further* reduces the remaining constraints encoded in the token.
*   **Output:** Updated Dynamic Constraint Token (with adjusted remaining constraints).

**3. Predictive Authorization Flow:**

1.  User initiates a payment transaction.
2.  The system receives the transaction request *and* the associated Dynamic Constraint Token.
3.  The system *decodes* the token to retrieve the *current* remaining constraint values.
4.  The system calculates the aggregated price and quantity (as in the original patent).
5.  *Before* authorization, the system runs a 'likelihood score' calculation based on the user's historical data, the current transaction, and the remaining constraint values. This score estimates the probability that the transaction is legitimate and within the user’s normal spending patterns.
6.  **Conditional Authorization:**
    *   If the aggregated values are within the constraints *AND* the likelihood score exceeds a predefined threshold, the transaction is authorized *without explicit user confirmation*.
    *   If either condition fails, the system requests explicit user authorization.
7.  Upon authorization, the Dynamic Constraint Token is updated with the new aggregated values.

**4. System Components:**

*   **Constraint Token Generator:** Generates Dynamic Constraint Tokens.
*   **Predictive Model:** Trained on user data to predict future transactions.
*   **Constraint Token Monitor:**  Tracks and updates active tokens.
*   **Likelihood Scoring Engine:** Calculates the probability of legitimate transactions.
*   **Authorization Engine:** Authorizes or requests user confirmation for transactions.



**Pseudocode (Likelihood Scoring Engine):**

```
function calculateLikelihoodScore(transactionPrice, transactionQuantity, remainingMaxPrice, remainingMaxQuantity, userHistoricalData) {

  // Features derived from userHistoricalData:
  averageTransactionPrice = calculateAverage(userHistoricalData.prices);
  priceVariance = calculateVariance(userHistoricalData.prices);
  averageTransactionQuantity = calculateAverage(userHistoricalData.quantities);
  quantityVariance = calculateVariance(userHistoricalData.quantities);

  // Calculate normalized differences
  priceDifference = (transactionPrice - averageTransactionPrice) / (priceVariance + 0.0001);  //Add small value to avoid division by zero
  quantityDifference = (transactionQuantity - averageTransactionQuantity) / (quantityVariance + 0.0001);

  // Constraint proximity scores
  priceProximity = 1 - (remainingMaxPrice - transactionPrice) / remainingMaxPrice;
  quantityProximity = 1 - (remainingMaxQuantity - transactionQuantity) / remainingMaxQuantity;

  // Combine features with weights (tunable parameters)
  score = (0.4 * priceProximity) + (0.4 * quantityProximity) + (0.1 * priceDifference) + (0.1 * quantityDifference);

  // Apply sigmoid function to normalize score between 0 and 1
  score = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-score));

  return score;
}
