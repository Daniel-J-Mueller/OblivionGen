## Automated Resource Quota Negotiation & Dynamic Sub-Account Creation

**Concept:** Extend the sub-account functionality with automated negotiation of resource quotas *between* sub-accounts and the parent account, dynamically creating new sub-accounts based on predicted resource needs and inter-sub-account dependency analysis. This moves beyond static allocation to a fluid, self-regulating system.

**Specification:**

**1. Dependency Mapping & Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical resource usage data for all sub-accounts and the parent account. Application dependency graph (which sub-account relies on which others). Predicted application workloads (e.g., projected user base increase, scheduled processing jobs).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze inter-sub-account dependencies to identify critical resource chains.
    *   Use machine learning models (time series forecasting, regression) to predict future resource needs for each sub-account.
    *   Assess potential resource contention based on predicted needs and dependency mapping.
    *   Generate a “resource need profile” for each sub-account, outlining predicted usage, critical dependencies, and acceptable performance thresholds.
*   **Output:** A prioritized list of sub-accounts with predicted resource demands and dependency information.

**2. Automated Quota Negotiation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Resource need profiles from the Dependency Mapping Module, current quota allocations for all sub-accounts and the parent account, predefined negotiation rules (e.g., acceptable performance degradation levels, cost optimization priorities).
*   **Process:**
    *   Initiate a multi-lateral negotiation process *between* sub-accounts and the parent account.
    *   Sub-accounts “bid” for additional resources based on their predicted needs and critical dependencies.
    *   The parent account acts as an arbiter, evaluating bids and allocating resources based on predefined rules and optimization criteria.
    *   Negotiation rules should allow for temporary resource borrowing/lending between sub-accounts.
    *   A ‘shadow quota’ concept – a temporary expansion of a sub-account’s quota based on immediate need, automatically reverting if the need subsides.
*   **Output:** Updated quota allocations for all participating sub-accounts and the parent account.

**3. Dynamic Sub-Account Provisioning Module:**

*   **Input:**  Predicted resource demand exceeding available quotas, application profile (e.g., type of application, scalability requirements), dependency graph.
*   **Process:**
    *   If predicted demand exceeds available resources, automatically provision a *new* sub-account.
    *   The new sub-account is seeded with a minimal set of resources based on the application profile.
    *   Relevant portions of the application workload are automatically migrated to the new sub-account, based on dependency analysis.
    *   The system establishes a peer relationship between the existing sub-accounts and the newly provisioned sub-account.
*   **Output:** A newly provisioned sub-account with allocated resources, workload distribution, and established peer relationships.

**Pseudocode (Negotiation Engine):**

```
function negotiate_resources(sub_accounts, parent_account):
  need_profiles = get_need_profiles(sub_accounts)
  available_resources = get_available_resources(parent_account)
  
  for sub_account in sub_accounts:
    bid = sub_account.need_profiles.predicted_demand - sub_account.current_quota
    
    if bid > 0:
      if available_resources >= bid:
        sub_account.current_quota += bid
        available_resources -= bid
      else:
        //Initiate negotiation with other sub-accounts
        negotiation_candidate = find_subaccount_with_lowest_priority(sub_accounts)
        if negotiation_candidate.current_quota > 0:
          transfer_amount = min(bid, negotiation_candidate.current_quota)
          negotiation_candidate.current_quota -= transfer_amount
          sub_account.current_quota += transfer_amount
          
  parent_account.available_resources = available_resources
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Sub-Account:** `ID, Name, Current_Quota, Need_Profile, Dependencies`
*   **Need_Profile:** `Predicted_Demand, Critical_Dependencies, Performance_Threshold`

This system moves beyond static allocation and allows for a dynamic, self-regulating resource management system that adapts to changing application needs and optimizes resource utilization. The automated negotiation and dynamic provisioning modules enhance scalability and resilience.
