## Knowledge Graph Dataset Augmentation via Simulated User Interaction

**Concept:** Expand dataset generation by simulating user interactions with the knowledge graph *before* dataset creation. This introduces a ‘behavioral’ layer to the data, enabling training of models sensitive to user intent and query patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Interaction Simulator Module:**

*   **Input:** Knowledge graph (format agnostic), custom ontology.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Persona Generation:** Create synthetic user personas with defined information needs and query biases (e.g., a persona interested in historical figures, a persona focused on scientific research).  Parameters include:
        *   *Interest Profile*: Vector representing preferences across KG entities/relationships.
        *   *Query Complexity*: Preference for short/long, simple/complex queries.
        *   *Error Tolerance*: Willingness to accept ambiguous or incomplete results.
    *   **Query Generation:**  Based on the persona, generate a series of simulated queries targeting the knowledge graph. Queries should explore different paths and relationships within the KG.  Utilize a combination of:
        *   *Random Walks*: Explore the graph randomly, respecting edge weights/relationship strengths.
        *   *Goal-Oriented Queries*:  Construct queries designed to retrieve specific information based on the persona’s needs.  Employ natural language generation (NLG) to formulate queries.
        *   *Ambiguous Queries*: Introduce intentional ambiguity to simulate real-world user behavior.
    *   **Interaction Logging:** Record each simulated interaction, including:
        *   *Query Text*
        *   *Entities/Relationships Involved*
        *   *Returned Results*
        *   *Persona ID*
        *   *Interaction Timestamp*
        *   *‘Reward’ Signal*: Assign a reward based on the relevance and quality of the results to the persona’s needs.

**2. Dataset Generation Module (Augmented):**

*   **Input:** Knowledge graph, custom ontology, Interaction Logs.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Mention-Concept Pair Extraction:** Extract mention-concept pairs as described in the original patent.
    *   **Interaction-Weighted Pairs:**  Assign weights to each mention-concept pair based on its frequency and relevance in the interaction logs.  Higher weights indicate greater user interest.
    *   **Contextual Pair Generation:** Identify pairs that occur in specific interaction contexts (e.g., pairs frequently queried together, pairs that resolve ambiguous queries).
    *   **Dataset Creation:** Create a dataset comprising mention-concept pairs, augmented with interaction weights and contextual information.
    *   **Data Augmentation:** Synthesize new mention-concept pairs by subtly altering existing ones based on interaction patterns. For instance, if a user frequently clarifies ambiguous queries by adding a specific modifier, generate new pairs with that modifier.

**3. Training Pipeline Integration:**

*   Integrate the augmented dataset into the machine learning model training pipeline.
*   Experiment with different weighting schemes for interaction data.
*   Evaluate model performance on tasks that require understanding user intent and query context.



**Pseudocode (Dataset Generation):**

```
function generate_augmented_dataset(knowledge_graph, ontology, interaction_logs):
  pairs = extract_mention_concept_pairs(knowledge_graph, ontology)
  for pair in pairs:
    pair.weight = 0
    for log in interaction_logs:
      if pair.mention in log.query and pair.concept in log.results:
        pair.weight += log.reward # Reward signal from interaction logs
  
  # Generate contextual pairs
  contextual_pairs = find_cooccurring_pairs(interaction_logs)
  pairs.extend(contextual_pairs)

  # Augment data with slight alterations based on interaction patterns
  augmented_pairs = generate_augmented_pairs(pairs, interaction_logs)
  pairs.extend(augmented_pairs)

  return pairs
```

This approach moves beyond static KG analysis to incorporate a dynamic, user-centric dimension into dataset generation, potentially leading to more robust and intelligent machine learning models.
