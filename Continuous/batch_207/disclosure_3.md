## Dynamic Cipher Suite "Chaining" & Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic cipher suite switching beyond simply escalating to a more computationally intensive option. Implement a "chain" of cipher suites with varying computational costs *and* security profiles. Couple this with a client reputation scoring system to preemptively select cipher suites, and dynamically adjust the chain based on observed attack patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Cipher Suite Chain Definition:**

*   A configuration file defines a cipher suite chain.  Each entry in the chain includes:
    *   `cipher_suite_id`: Unique identifier for the cipher suite.
    *   `computational_cost`: Integer representing relative computational cost (1-10).
    *   `security_score`: Integer representing a subjective security rating (1-10).  This can be manually tuned or derived from industry best practices.
    *   `minimum_reputation`: Integer representing the minimum client reputation score required to *initially* use this cipher suite.
*   The chain is ordered from lowest computational cost/highest initial accessibility to highest cost/restricted access.

**2. Client Reputation System:**

*   Each client is assigned a reputation score, initialized to a default value.
*   Reputation is dynamically adjusted based on several factors:
    *   **Connection Stability:**  Frequent disconnections/reconnections lower reputation.
    *   **Traffic Patterns:**  Anomalous request rates (compared to historical norms or peer group) lower reputation.
    *   **Cipher Suite Negotiation:**  Consistent refusal to negotiate a reasonable cipher suite (or attempts to force weak ciphers) lower reputation.
    *   **Successful Authentication:** Consistent successful authentication increases reputation.
*   Reputation scores are stored persistently (e.g., in a database or cache).

**3. Initial Cipher Suite Selection:**

*   Upon initial connection attempt, the client provides its supported cipher suites.
*   The host server intersects the clientâ€™s list with the available cipher suites in the defined chain.
*   The server selects the *highest* cipher suite in the chain that meets *both* criteria:
    *   The client supports it.
    *   The client's current reputation score is greater than or equal to the `minimum_reputation` for that cipher suite.

**4. Dynamic Cipher Suite Escalation/De-escalation:**

*   **Attack Detection:** The system monitors various metrics (bandwidth usage, latency, error rates, etc.) to detect potential DDoS attacks.
*   **Escalation:** If an attack is suspected, the system can *aggressively* escalate the cipher suite for clients exhibiting suspicious behavior.  This is done by bypassing the reputation check and selecting a higher-cost cipher suite from the chain.  Even clients with high reputations can be subjected to escalation during an active attack.
*   **De-escalation:** After the attack subsides, the system dynamically de-escalates cipher suites based on client reputation and observed traffic patterns.

**5. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function select_cipher_suite(client, available_cipher_suites):
  client_reputation = get_client_reputation(client)
  eligible_cipher_suites = []

  for cipher_suite in available_cipher_suites:
    if cipher_suite.minimum_reputation <= client_reputation:
      eligible_cipher_suites.append(cipher_suite)

  if is_attack_detected():
    # Bypass reputation check during attack
    highest_cipher_suite = find_highest_cipher_suite(eligible_cipher_suites) # Based on cost/security
    return highest_cipher_suite
  else:
    # Select highest eligible cipher suite based on reputation
    highest_cipher_suite = find_highest_cipher_suite(eligible_cipher_suites) # Based on cost/security
    return highest_cipher_suite

function find_highest_cipher_suite(cipher_suite_list):
  # Find the cipher suite with the highest combined cost and security score
  highest_suite = null
  highest_score = -1

  for suite in cipher_suite_list:
    score = suite.computational_cost + suite.security_score
    if score > highest_score:
      highest_score = score
      highest_suite = suite

  return highest_suite
```

**6.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **A/B Testing:** The chain configuration can be dynamically adjusted based on A/B testing to optimize performance and security.
*   **Geographic Filtering:** Combine with geographic filtering to further restrict access based on known attack sources.
*   **Adaptive Reputation Adjustment:**  Implement more sophisticated reputation adjustment algorithms that consider the severity and frequency of malicious activity.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Integrate with threat intelligence feeds to proactively adjust the chain based on emerging threats.
