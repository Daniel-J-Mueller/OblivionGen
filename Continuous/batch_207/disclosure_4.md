## Dynamic Subtitle 'Mood' Generation

**Concept:** Extend dynamic subtitle transcoding to incorporate sentiment analysis of the media content and modify subtitle styling (color, size, font, emphasis) to reflect the 'mood' of the scene. This goes beyond simple timing and format conversion, adding a layer of emotional cueing for the viewer.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sentiment Analysis Engine:** Integrate a real-time sentiment analysis engine capable of processing audio and video data. This engine will output a sentiment score (e.g., -1.0 to +1.0) and associated emotional categories (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear). This could leverage existing cloud-based APIs or a locally hosted model.

2.  **Subtitle Styling Database:**  Create a database mapping sentiment scores/emotional categories to specific subtitle styling parameters.  Example:

    *   Joy (score > 0.7):  Bright yellow font, slightly larger size, subtle glow effect.
    *   Sadness (score < -0.6):  Pale blue font, smaller size, slightly blurred effect.
    *   Anger (score < -0.8):  Red font, bold, flashing outline.
    *   Fear (score < -0.5):  Dark grey font, trembling animation.
    *   Neutral (score between -0.3 and 0.3): Default styling.

3.  **Transcoding Pipeline Integration:**  Modify the existing transcoding pipeline to incorporate the sentiment analysis output.  After the sentiment score is determined for a segment of the media, the pipeline will dynamically apply the corresponding subtitle styling parameters.

4.  **User Customization:** Provide options for the user to:

    *   Adjust the sensitivity of the sentiment analysis (e.g., more or less aggressive styling changes).
    *   Select pre-defined ‘mood profiles’ (e.g., ‘Dramatic’, ‘Subtle’, ‘Minimalist’).
    *   Completely disable the feature.

5.  **Pseudocode - Transcoding Segment:**

    ```
    function transcodeSubtitleSegment(mediaSegment, subtitleText, timestamp) {
      sentimentScore = analyzeSentiment(mediaSegment)
      mood = determineMood(sentimentScore)
      styleParams = getStyleParams(mood)

      styledSubtitle = applyStyle(subtitleText, styleParams)

      return styledSubtitle
    }
    ```

6.  **Synchronization Mechanism:** Maintain precise synchronization between the audio/video and the dynamically styled subtitles. This is crucial for a seamless and immersive experience. Leverage existing timing information (PTS) and fine-tune the styling application to minimize latency.

7.  **Caching Strategy:** Implement a caching mechanism to store frequently used styled subtitle segments. This will reduce the computational load and improve performance. Cache keys should include the subtitle text, sentiment score, and styling parameters.

8. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle cases where sentiment analysis fails or styling parameters are invalid. Fallback to default styling in such cases.
