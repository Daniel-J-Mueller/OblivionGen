## Dynamic Manifest Stitching with Real-Time Telemetry

**Concept:** Extend the automated manifest creation process by incorporating real-time service mesh telemetry to dynamically “stitch” together manifests at runtime, enabling adaptive traffic management and granular policy enforcement *without* full manifest redeployment.

**Specs:**

1.  **Telemetry Ingestion Module:**
    *   Input: Service mesh telemetry data (e.g., request rates, latency, error rates, headers, custom tags) from a telemetry provider (e.g., Prometheus, Jaeger, Datadog).
    *   Processing:  Normalize and aggregate telemetry data. Identify anomalies or performance degradations exceeding predefined thresholds.  Establish ‘health scores’ for virtual services and virtual nodes.
    *   Output:  Telemetry-derived ‘health scores’ and anomaly flags, formatted for the Stitching Engine.

2.  **Stitching Engine:**
    *   Input: Base manifests (created as in the original patent), telemetry data, and a policy engine configuration.
    *   Logic:
        *   Policy Configuration:  Define policies based on telemetry data. Examples:
            *   "If service 'X' latency exceeds 500ms, redirect 10% of traffic to shadow instance 'X-shadow'."
            *   "If node 'Y' error rate exceeds 5%, isolate it and route traffic only to healthy nodes."
            *   “If header ‘Z’ is present, apply rate limiting policy ‘A’.”
        *   Manifest Modification:  Dynamically modify base manifests based on policy evaluation. This includes:
            *   Adding/removing routes.
            *   Adjusting traffic weights.
            *   Applying rate limits.
            *   Enforcing security policies (e.g., mutual TLS).
        *   Manifest Versioning: Maintain a history of modified manifests for rollback and auditing.
    *   Output: Modified manifests, ready for deployment.

3.  **Deployment Coordinator:**
    *   Input: Modified manifests.
    *   Logic: Deploy modified manifests to sidecar proxies without full service disruption. Utilize canary deployments or blue/green deployments for minimal impact.
    *   Output: Confirmation of manifest deployment.

4.  **Policy Engine:**
    *   Input: Telemetry data, policy definitions.
    *   Processing: Evaluate policies based on telemetry data.
    *   Output:  Policy evaluation results (e.g., apply rate limit, redirect traffic).

**Pseudocode (Stitching Engine – simplified):**

```
function stitch_manifest(base_manifest, telemetry_data, policy_definitions):
  policy_results = evaluate_policies(telemetry_data, policy_definitions)
  modified_manifest = base_manifest.copy()

  for policy_result in policy_results:
    if policy_result.action == "redirect_traffic":
      modified_manifest.add_route(policy_result.destination, policy_result.weight)
    elif policy_result.action == "apply_rate_limit":
      modified_manifest.set_rate_limit(policy_result.resource, policy_result.limit)
    elif policy_result.action == "isolate_node":
      modified_manifest.remove_routes_to_node(policy_result.node)

  return modified_manifest
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Telemetry Data:**  JSON format containing service/node metrics (rate, latency, errors), custom tags.
*   **Policy Definition:** YAML format specifying rules based on telemetry and desired actions.
*   **Manifest:**  JSON/YAML representing the sidecar proxy configuration.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Adaptive Traffic Management:** Respond to changing conditions in real-time.
*   **Granular Policy Enforcement:** Apply policies based on specific telemetry data.
*   **Reduced Downtime:** Avoid full manifest redeployments for minor adjustments.
*   **Improved Resilience:** Automatically isolate failing nodes or redirect traffic to healthy instances.
