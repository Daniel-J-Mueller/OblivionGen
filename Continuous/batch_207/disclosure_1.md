## Adaptive Embedding Granularity via Dynamic Cluster Merging

**Concept:** This system builds on the idea of vector norms for cluster quality, but instead of simply *removing* low-quality clusters, it dynamically merges and splits clusters based on real-time data flow and embedding space density. This creates a continuously adapting embedding space granularity optimized for categorization performance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Input & Initial Embedding:**

*   Input: Stream of images.
*   Process: Initial embedding generated using a pre-trained neural network (potentially the first network described in the patent) creating an initial embedding space.

**2. Cluster Formation & Evaluation:**

*   Initial Clustering: Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) to the embedded data.
*   Vector Norm Calculation: For each cluster, calculate the average vector norm of the embedded vectors within the cluster.
*   Density Estimation: Calculate a density score for each cluster based on the number of vectors within a fixed radius in embedding space.

**3. Dynamic Cluster Adjustment:**

*   **Merging Criterion:** If two or more clusters meet *both* of the following conditions, merge them:
    *   Average vector norm difference is below a threshold (indicates similar magnitude of features).
    *   Distance between cluster centroids is below a threshold.
*   **Splitting Criterion:** If a cluster meets *both* of the following conditions, split it:
    *   Density exceeds a threshold (cluster is too crowded).
    *   Variance of vector norms within the cluster exceeds a threshold (indicates heterogeneous features).
*   **Splitting Implementation:** Utilize a k-means algorithm *within* the cluster to create sub-clusters. The number of sub-clusters is determined by the variance threshold.

**4. Real-time Adaptation Loop:**

*   Stream Processing: As new images arrive, embed them into the embedding space.
*   Assignment: Assign each new image to the closest cluster.
*   Evaluation: Re-calculate vector norms, density, and cluster variance at fixed intervals, or after a set number of new images have been assigned.
*   Adjustment: Apply the merging and splitting criteria as needed to dynamically adjust the embedding space.

**5. Categorization & Label Propagation:**

*   Label Assignment: Manually label a small subset of clusters.
*   Label Propagation: Propagate labels to newly assigned images based on their cluster membership.
*   Confidence Scoring: Assign a confidence score to each label based on the cluster's density and the imageâ€™s distance from the cluster centroid.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
preTrainedNetwork = loadPreTrainedNetwork()
clusteringAlgorithm = selectClusteringAlgorithm()
densityRadius = 0.5
normThreshold = 0.1
varianceThreshold = 0.2

// Main Loop
while (imagesAvailable()) {
    image = getImage()
    embedding = preTrainedNetwork.embed(image)

    closestCluster = clusteringAlgorithm.findClosestCluster(embedding, clusters)
    clusters.assign(embedding, closestCluster)

    // Periodic Adjustment
    if (frameCount % adjustmentInterval == 0) {
        // Calculate metrics
        for each cluster in clusters {
            calculateVectorNorm(cluster)
            calculateDensity(cluster)
            calculateVariance(cluster)
        }

        // Merge and Split
        for each cluster in clusters {
            // Check for merge
            for each otherCluster in clusters {
                if (areClustersMergeable(cluster, otherCluster)) {
                    mergeClusters(cluster, otherCluster)
                }
            }
            // Check for split
            if (isClusterSplittable(cluster)) {
                splitCluster(cluster)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Adaptive Thresholds:**  Dynamically adjust the thresholds for merging and splitting based on overall embedding space characteristics.
*   **Hierarchical Clustering:** Incorporate hierarchical clustering to create a multi-scale embedding space.
*   **Automated Labeling:**  Utilize active learning techniques to automatically label clusters with minimal human intervention.
