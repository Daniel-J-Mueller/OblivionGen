## Adaptive Credential Chains with Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend automated credential submission by introducing a dynamic "credential chain" based on a reputation score derived from successful authentication attempts *and* user-provided trust levels. This goes beyond simply selecting a credential; it proactively *tests* credentials in a prioritized order, learning from success and failure, and incorporating user-defined trust.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Credential Chain Manager (CCM) – a client-side module integrated with the existing authentication management client.
*   **Data Structure:** `CredentialChainEntry`

    *   `credentialID`: Unique identifier for the account/credential.
    *   `domain`: Associated domain name(s).
    *   `trustScore`: User-defined trust level (1-10, default 5).
    *   `successRate`: Calculated success rate for this credential (0.0-1.0).
    *   `lastAttemptTimestamp`: Timestamp of the last authentication attempt.
    *   `failCount`: Number of consecutive failed attempts.
*   **Algorithm:**

    1.  **Initialization:** Upon system start, populate a `CredentialChain` for each domain from the existing account list. Initial `successRate` is 0.0 for all.
    2.  **Domain Matching:** When a secured resource is accessed, identify potential credentials from the `CredentialChain` associated with the domain.
    3.  **Prioritization:** Sort potential credentials within the `CredentialChain` using a combined score: `PriorityScore = (successRate * 0.7) + (trustScore/10 * 0.3)`.
    4.  **Credential Testing Loop:**
        *   Iterate through the sorted `CredentialChain`.
        *   Attempt authentication using the current credential.
        *   If successful:
            *   Update `successRate`:  `successRate = successRate * 0.9 + 0.1` (exponential smoothing).
            *   Reset `failCount` to 0.
            *   Exit the loop.
        *   If failed:
            *   Increment `failCount`.
            *   If `failCount` exceeds a threshold (e.g., 3):
                *   Temporarily reduce `trustScore` (e.g., by 1).
                *   Add a time penalty before re-attempting this credential.
    5.  **Fallback:** If all credentials fail, prompt the user for manual input.
    6.  **Learning:** Continuously update `successRate` and `trustScore` based on authentication outcomes.
*   **User Interface Integration:**
    *   A settings panel allowing users to view and adjust `trustScore` for each account.
    *   Optional visual feedback (e.g., a small icon next to the account name indicating trust level).
*   **API Considerations:**
    *   An API endpoint for external applications to query and update account `trustScore`.
    *   A mechanism for applications to provide feedback on authentication success/failure.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function authenticate(domain):
  credentialChain = getCredentialChain(domain)
  sortedCredentials = sortCredentials(credentialChain)

  for credential in sortedCredentials:
    if attemptAuthentication(credential):
      updateSuccessRate(credential)
      resetFailCount(credential)
      return success

    incrementFailCount(credential)
    if failCount(credential) > threshold:
      decreaseTrustScore(credential)
      addTimePenalty(credential)

  promptUserForManualInput()
  return failure
```

**Innovation:** This system isn’t just about automating authentication; it's about *learning* user preferences and adapting to authentication reliability over time.  By incorporating a dynamic trust system and prioritizing credentials based on real-world performance, it enhances both security and user experience.  The potential for integration with third-party risk assessment services could further refine the credential selection process.
