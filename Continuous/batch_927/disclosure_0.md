## Adaptive Action Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of actions within the execution plan, breaking down coarse-grained actions into finer-grained sub-actions, or conversely, consolidating fine-grained actions into coarser ones, *during* runtime, based on observed performance and resource constraints. This is beyond simply reordering; it’s reshaping the *fundamental units* of work.

**Specification:**

**1. Action Decomposition & Aggregation Module:**

*   **Input:** Dependency Graph, Execution Plan, Real-time Performance Metrics (latency, resource usage – CPU, memory, network), System Load.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Granularity Profiles:**  Maintain profiles for each action detailing potential decomposition/aggregation strategies.  Each strategy defines the sub-actions (or consolidated actions) and their interdependencies.
    *   **Cost Model:** A cost model evaluates each potential granularity change. Factors include:
        *   Overhead of splitting/merging actions (context switching, data transfer).
        *   Potential for parallelism.
        *   Resource consumption of sub-actions.
        *   Impact on dependency graph complexity.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Based on performance metrics and the cost model, the module dynamically adjusts action granularity.  Triggers:
        *   High latency for a specific action.
        *   Resource contention impacting action performance.
        *   Significant changes in system load.
        *   Identification of newly available parallelization opportunities.
*   **Output:** Modified Execution Plan with adjusted action granularity.

**2.  Runtime Dependency Graph Update:**

*   **Input:** Modified Execution Plan, Original Dependency Graph
*   **Process:**  Whenever action granularity changes, the dependency graph *must* be updated to reflect the new relationships between sub-actions or consolidated actions.  This is not a simple graph transformation; it’s a restructuring of the fundamental units of work.
*   **Output:** Updated Dependency Graph.

**3.  Workflow:**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
define GranularityProfiles for all Actions
define CostModel(Action, NewGranularity) // Returns cost estimate

// Runtime Loop
while (API Request Received) {
    ExecutionPlan = GenerateExecutionPlan(DependencyGraph)
    ProcessAPIRequest(ExecutionPlan)

    MonitorPerformance() // Collect latency, resource usage
    SystemLoad = GetSystemLoad()

    // Adaptive Adjustment
    for each Action in ExecutionPlan:
        if PerformanceDegraded(Action) or SystemLoadHigh:
            BestGranularity = FindBestGranularity(Action, PerformanceMetrics, SystemLoad, GranularityProfiles, CostModel)

            if BestGranularity != CurrentGranularity(Action):
                UpdateExecutionPlan(Action, BestGranularity)
                UpdateDependencyGraph(Action, BestGranularity)
}
```

**4.  Considerations:**

*   **State Management:**  Decomposition/aggregation may require managing state across sub-actions. This must be handled carefully to ensure consistency.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If a granularity change negatively impacts performance, a rollback mechanism is needed to revert to the previous configuration.
*   **Profiling & Learning:**  The system should learn from past performance to optimize granularity profiles and the cost model over time.
*   **Action 'Shapes':** Define canonical 'shapes' for actions – allowing an action to dynamically adapt its internal implementation *while preserving its external interface*.
