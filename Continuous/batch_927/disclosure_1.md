## Adaptive Harmonic Resonance Profiling

**Concept:** Expand the voltage signature data collection to include analysis of harmonic resonance within the measured electrical signals. Identify specific resonant frequencies that may indicate component degradation, impending failures, or unusual operational states.

**Specs:**

*   **Resonance Detection Module:** Add a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) block to the FPGA. This DSP block will execute a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm on the incoming digital voltage data samples from *each* VDA component chain.  The FFT size should be configurable (e.g., 512, 1024, 2048 points) to allow adjustment of frequency resolution and analysis window.
*   **Frequency Band Segmentation:** Divide the FFT output into frequency bands.  Define configurable band boundaries (e.g., 60Hz, 120Hz, 240Hz, etc.). The number of bands should be adjustable.
*   **Harmonic Resonance Metric:** For each frequency band, calculate a “Resonance Metric”.  This metric will quantify the amplitude of the dominant frequency component within the band, normalized by the total energy within the band.  Consider using a root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude calculation for improved accuracy.
*   **Resonance Profile Database:** Implement a database (stored in the SoC’s memory) to store pre-defined resonance profiles for different appliance types and operating conditions. Profiles would consist of expected ranges for the Resonance Metric values across each frequency band.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Compare the measured Resonance Metric values to the stored profiles. Flag any bands where the measured value falls outside the expected range. Utilize a configurable sensitivity threshold to adjust the level of anomaly detection.
*   **Dynamic Profile Learning:** Incorporate a machine learning algorithm (e.g., autoencoder) within the SoC to dynamically learn and update the resonance profiles over time. This will allow the system to adapt to individual appliance characteristics and aging effects.
*   **Data Synchronization:**  Ensure tight synchronization between the voltage data acquisition and the FFT processing.  Implement buffering and DMA transfers to minimize latency.
*   **Interface:** Add a communication interface (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C) to transmit the Resonance Metric data and anomaly flags to an external device or cloud platform for further analysis and visualization.
*   **Power Optimization:**  Implement power-saving techniques such as clock gating and dynamic voltage scaling for the DSP block to minimize energy consumption.



**Pseudocode (FPGA – DSP Block):**

```
//Input: Digital voltage data samples from VDA component chain (array of floats)
//Output: Array of Resonance Metric values (floats)

function calculateResonanceProfile(voltageData[], fftSize, bandBoundaries[]) {

    //Perform FFT on voltageData
    fftResult = FFT(voltageData, fftSize)

    //Calculate energy within each frequency band
    for each band in bandBoundaries {
        bandEnergy = 0
        for each frequency in band {
            bandEnergy += abs(fftResult[frequency])^2
        }

        //Find the dominant frequency within the band
        dominantFrequency = 0
        maxAmplitude = 0
        for each frequency in band {
            if (abs(fftResult[frequency]) > maxAmplitude) {
                maxAmplitude = abs(fftResult[frequency])
                dominantFrequency = frequency
            }
        }

        //Calculate Resonance Metric (RMS Amplitude / Total Energy)
        resonanceMetric = maxAmplitude / bandEnergy
        resonanceMetrics[band] = resonanceMetric
    }

    return resonanceMetrics
}
