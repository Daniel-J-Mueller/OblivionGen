## Dynamic Query Expansion via Knowledge Graph Traversal & Persona Simulation

**Concept:** Enhance query understanding & response relevance by dynamically expanding queries using a knowledge graph, *and* simultaneously simulating user personas to tailor expansion and response selection.

**Specification:**

**I. Knowledge Graph Integration:**

*   **Knowledge Graph Source:** Utilize a pre-existing knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, ConceptNet) or construct a domain-specific one. The KG should contain entities, relationships, and associated metadata.
*   **Entity Recognition:** Incoming query undergoes entity recognition to identify key entities present within the query.
*   **Relationship Traversal:** Starting from identified entities, traverse the knowledge graph to uncover related entities and relationships. Define traversal depth and branching factor parameters.
*   **Relevance Scoring:** Assign relevance scores to traversed entities based on:
    *   Relationship type (stronger relationships get higher scores).
    *   Path length (shorter paths get higher scores).
    *   Entity popularity/frequency in KG.
*   **Query Expansion Candidates:** Generate query expansion candidates by incorporating highly-ranked related entities into the original query.  Examples:
    *   Original: “What is the capital of France?”
    *   Expansion Candidates: “What is the capital of France and its population?”, “What is the capital of France and its major landmarks?”

**II. Persona Simulation:**

*   **Persona Database:** Maintain a database of user personas defined by attributes like:
    *   Age
    *   Education Level
    *   Interests
    *   Technical Proficiency
    *   Query History (if available)
*   **Persona Matching:** Given an incoming query, attempt to match it to a relevant persona. Utilize techniques like:
    *   Keyword analysis of query vs. persona interests.
    *   Query intent classification & persona preference mapping.
*   **Persona-Driven Expansion Filtering:**  Filter query expansion candidates based on the matched persona’s profile. Prioritize expansions that align with the persona’s interests and knowledge level.  Example: For a young child persona, favor expansions related to simple facts and definitions. For an expert persona, favor expansions related to complex topics and research.

**III. Hybrid Response Generation:**

*   **Parallel Query Execution:** Execute both the original query and the filtered expansion candidates against the query-answering subsystems.
*   **Response Ranking & Fusion:** Rank responses based on:
    *   Subsystem confidence scores.
    *   Relevance to both the original query *and* the persona’s profile.
    *   Diversity of information (avoid redundancy).
*   **Personalized Response Generation:** Fuse selected responses into a single, coherent response tailored to the persona. Adjust the language style and level of detail based on the persona’s profile.
*   **Output:** Present the personalized response to the user.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processQuery(query, persona) {
  entities = extractEntities(query);
  relatedEntities = traverseKnowledgeGraph(entities);
  expansionCandidates = generateExpansionCandidates(query, relatedEntities);
  filteredCandidates = filterExpansionCandidates(expansionCandidates, persona);

  originalResponse = queryAnsweringSystem(query);
  expandedResponses = [];
  for (candidate in filteredCandidates) {
    expandedResponses.push(queryAnsweringSystem(candidate));
  }

  combinedResponses = rankAndFuseResponses(originalResponse, expandedResponses);
  personalizedResponse = generatePersonalizedResponse(combinedResponses, persona);

  return personalizedResponse;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Knowledge Graph database (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph)
*   Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK)
*   Machine Learning models for persona matching and response ranking.
*   High-performance computing infrastructure to support real-time query processing.
*   API for integrating with existing query-answering systems.
