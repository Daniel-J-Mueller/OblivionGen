## Adaptive Request Shadowing & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Instead of solely reacting to potential DoS attacks by adjusting thread counts and timeouts, proactively *shadow* incoming requests, build a predictive model of request behavior, and pre-allocate resources based on that model. This anticipates load before it overloads the system, reducing latency and improving legitimate user experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Request Shadowing Module:**
    *   Intercepts a small percentage (configurable, e.g., 1-5%) of all incoming requests *before* they reach the main processing pipeline.  These "shadow" requests do not fully execute – only enough information is gathered to build a behavioral profile.
    *   Data collected includes: IP address, request headers (User-Agent, Content-Type, etc.), request size, request rate, and initial connection characteristics.
    *   Shadow requests are handled by a lightweight, dedicated thread pool separate from the main request handling threads.
    *   Shadow requests have a minimal processing time limit to prevent resource exhaustion.  Requests exceeding this limit are discarded.

2.  **Behavioral Model:**
    *   Employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or a simple moving average) to predict request volume, size, and rate based on historical shadow request data.
    *   The model is trained and updated continuously (e.g., every 5-10 minutes) to adapt to changing traffic patterns.
    *   Anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., standard deviation thresholds, moving average deviations) identify unusual request patterns that deviate from the predicted behavior.  These could indicate a potential attack.
    *   The model incorporates a "reputation" score for each IP address based on its historical behavior.  High scores indicate trustworthy IPs, while low scores indicate potentially malicious IPs.  The reputation score is influenced by both the request rate and the consistency of the request behavior.

3.  **Predictive Resource Allocation Module:**
    *   Based on the output of the behavioral model, dynamically adjusts resource allocation *before* a potential overload occurs.
    *   Pre-allocates a pool of processing threads and connection slots based on the predicted request volume.
    *   Adjusts thread priority and connection timeout values based on the predicted request characteristics.  For example, requests from IPs with high reputation scores could be given higher priority and longer timeouts.
    *   Implements a tiered resource allocation strategy.  As the predicted request volume increases, more resources are allocated in stages. This prevents sudden resource spikes and allows the system to gracefully handle increasing load.
    *   A separate monitoring system tracks the utilization of allocated resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).  If resource utilization exceeds a predetermined threshold, the system can trigger additional scaling measures (e.g., adding more servers).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Resource Allocation Module):**

```
function allocateResources(predictedRequestVolume, predictedRequestRate, ipReputationScore):
  // Define resource allocation tiers
  tier1Volume = 1000 requests/minute
  tier2Volume = 5000 requests/minute
  tier3Volume = 10000 requests/minute

  // Calculate base resource allocation
  baseThreads = 10
  baseConnections = 100

  // Adjust resource allocation based on predicted volume
  if predictedRequestVolume > tier3Volume:
    threads = baseThreads * 4
    connections = baseConnections * 4
  else if predictedRequestVolume > tier2Volume:
    threads = baseThreads * 3
    connections = baseConnections * 3
  else if predictedRequestVolume > tier1Volume:
    threads = baseThreads * 2
    connections = baseConnections * 2
  else:
    threads = baseThreads
    connections = baseConnections

  // Adjust resource allocation based on IP reputation
  if ipReputationScore < 0.2: // Low reputation
    threads = threads * 0.5
    connections = connections * 0.5
  else if ipReputationScore > 0.8: // High reputation
    threads = threads * 1.5
    connections = connections * 1.5

  // Allocate resources (threads and connections)
  allocateThreads(threads)
  allocateConnections(connections)
```

**Innovation:** This system shifts from *reactive* DoS mitigation to *proactive* load management, improving performance and resilience.  The combination of request shadowing, behavioral modeling, and predictive resource allocation creates a more intelligent and adaptive system. It’s also less disruptive to legitimate users as it anticipates load before it impacts service.
