## Dynamic Task Prioritization via Predictive Congestion

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic performance configuration system to *proactively* adjust resource allocation based on predicted congestion within the data traffic workflow, rather than reactively responding to backlog size. This leverages machine learning to forecast potential bottlenecks before they impact performance, improving responsiveness and overall throughput.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Congestion Module (PCM) – integrates with existing Data Traffic Workflow Management System.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Historical task completion times.
    *   Task dependencies (graph of required upstream tasks).
    *   Real-time task submission rate.
    *   Resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) of task execution services.
    *   Geographical location of task origin and destination (for network latency prediction).
*   **ML Model:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. LSTM is suited for time series forecasting.
*   **Training:** Continuously trained on historical data from the data traffic workflow.  Regular retraining schedule (e.g., daily) to adapt to changing workload patterns.
*   **Prediction Horizon:** Predict congestion (estimated task completion delay) for the next *N* minutes (configurable – starting with 5-15 minutes).
*   **Output:**  Congestion Score (0-100) for each task type or task category, indicating the likelihood of delay.
*   **Integration with Workflow Management:**
    *   The Workflow Management System receives the Congestion Scores.
    *   Based on Congestion Scores, the system dynamically adjusts task prioritization and resource allocation.
    *   Higher Congestion Score = Higher Priority = More Resources.
*   **Resource Allocation Adjustment:**
    *   **Traffic Control Worker Assignment:** Assign more Traffic Control Workers to high-priority task categories.
    *   **Task Execution Service Capacity Request:** Request increased capacity from Task Execution Services for high-priority tasks.
    *   **Task Scheduling:** Re-order task scheduling to prioritize tasks with high Congestion Scores.
    *    **Regional Shifting**: If congestion is predicted in a specific region, shift task execution to other regions based on available capacity.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor actual task completion times and compare to predicted completion times.
    *   Use this data to refine the ML model and improve prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// PCM – Predictive Congestion Module

function predict_congestion(task_data, historical_data):
  // Load ML model
  model = load_model("congestion_prediction_model")

  // Preprocess input data
  preprocessed_data = preprocess(task_data, historical_data)

  // Generate congestion score
  congestion_score = model.predict(preprocessed_data)

  return congestion_score

// Workflow Management System

function schedule_tasks(task_list):
  for task in task_list:
    congestion_score = predict_congestion(task, historical_data)
    task.priority = congestion_score
  
  // Sort tasks by priority (highest priority first)
  sorted_tasks = sort_by_priority(task_list)

  // Assign resources based on priority
  assign_resources(sorted_tasks)

  // Execute tasks
  execute_tasks(sorted_tasks)
