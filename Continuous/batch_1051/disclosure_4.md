## Adaptive Haptic Projection Surface

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple orientation feedback on the projection surface to provide localized haptic feedback corresponding to projected imagery. This moves beyond visual augmentation to tactile augmentation, enhancing immersion and interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Surface Material:** A dynamically configurable metasurface composed of micro-actuators. These actuators can alter the surface texture on a per-pixel basis, creating the illusion of 3D shapes or textures. Material composition: Electroactive polymers (EAPs) embedded within a transparent, durable polymer matrix.
*   **Actuation Control:**  Each pixel (or cluster of pixels) of the metasurface is individually addressable via a microcontroller. Control signals dictate the degree of deformation of the EAPs, modulating the surface height and creating haptic sensations. Resolution: 1mm pixel pitch (adjustable).
*   **Sensor Integration:** Capacitive proximity sensors embedded *beneath* the metasurface detect the presence and pressure of a user's hand or other objects. This data feeds back into the control system, enabling dynamic haptic responses. Sensor density: 1 sensor per 4mm^2.
*   **Projection System Integration:** The existing projector system must be calibrated to account for surface deformation. Software algorithms compensate for the changing surface geometry, maintaining image clarity and perspective. Algorithms include mesh warping and ray tracing adjustments.
*   **Power Delivery:** Wireless power transfer (resonant inductive coupling) to provide power to the metasurface actuators and sensors. Transmitter integrated within the augmented reality functional node. Receiver embedded within the projection surface.
*   **Data Pipeline:**
    1.  AR System renders image.
    2.  Image is analyzed for texture, depth, and interaction points.
    3.  Haptic data is generated: For each interaction point, calculate the desired surface deformation to simulate the objectâ€™s texture and shape.
    4.  Haptic data is transmitted to the projection surface.
    5.  Projection surface actuators deform accordingly.
    6.  Capacitive sensors detect user interaction.
    7.  Sensor data is fed back to the AR system, influencing the projected image and haptic feedback.
*   **Software Interface:**  API for developers to define haptic properties of virtual objects (roughness, hardness, temperature simulation via varying actuator frequency).
*   **Calibration Procedure:** Automated calibration routine utilizing structured light to map the surface topography and ensure accurate haptic rendering.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Rendering Loop):**

```
FOR each pixel in image:
  IF pixel represents interactive element:
    haptic_value = calculate_haptic_value(pixel_data) // Based on material properties, shape, etc.
    set_actuator_height(pixel_location, haptic_value)
  ELSE:
    set_actuator_height(pixel_location, 0) // Flat surface

  //Read sensor data
  sensor_data = read_sensor_data(pixel_location)

  IF sensor_data.pressure > threshold:
    //Modify image based on interaction
    update_image(pixel_location, sensor_data)

END FOR
```

**Possible Applications:** Virtual sculpting, tactile gaming, remote manipulation of objects, accessibility for visually impaired users.
