## Personalized Predictive Directive Caching

**Concept:** Expand upon the caching of remote directive data by incorporating user-specific prediction models to proactively cache directives *before* the user even speaks, based on contextual awareness and learned behavior.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **User Profile Database:** Stores historical data including:
    *   Utterance transcripts & associated remote directives.
    *   Time-series data of utterance frequency (daily/hourly patterns).
    *   Location data (if permitted) for location-based directives.
    *   Calendar integration (with permission) to anticipate needs.
    *   Device context (e.g., connected devices, current application).
*   **Predictive Model Engine:** Utilizes machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks, LSTMs) to:
    *   Analyze user profile data.
    *   Predict the probability of specific utterances.
    *   Predict the corresponding remote directives.
    *   Assign a "cache priority" score to each predicted directive.
*   **Proactive Cache Manager:**
    *   Monitors the Predictive Model Engine output.
    *   Based on the cache priority score, proactively fetches and caches remote directives.
    *   Implements a cache eviction policy (LRU, LFU, or a hybrid) with weighting towards user-specific predictions.
*   **Contextual Awareness Module:**
    *   Gathers real-time contextual information (time of day, location, device state, calendar events).
    *   Feeds this information into the Predictive Model Engine.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Profile Building:** Upon initial setup, and continuously thereafter, build a comprehensive user profile.
2.  **Prediction Generation:** The Predictive Model Engine continuously analyzes the user profile and contextual data to generate predictions of likely utterances and associated directives.
3.  **Proactive Caching:** The Proactive Cache Manager fetches and caches directives with high prediction scores. Directives are prioritized based on a score incorporating prediction probability and urgency (e.g. time-sensitive directives get a higher score).
4.  **Normal Operation:** When the user speaks:
    *   ASR and NLU processes as in the original patent.
    *   Check for a cached directive matching the inferred intent.
        *   If found: Utilize the cached directive, bypassing the remote request.
        *   If not found: Proceed with the remote request, and *also* update the user profile and predictive model with the new utterance/directive pair.
5.  **Model Refinement:** Continuously refine the predictive model using new data and user feedback (implicit – usage patterns – and explicit – user ratings of directive accuracy).

**III. Pseudocode (Proactive Cache Manager):**

```
function manageCache() {
  predictedDirectives = PredictiveModelEngine.getPredictedDirectives();

  for each directive in predictedDirectives {
    cachePriority = directive.priorityScore;

    if (cachePriority > threshold && !isCached(directive)) {
      fetchAndCache(directive);
    }
  }

  evictOldest(); // Implement cache eviction policy
}

function fetchAndCache(directive) {
  remoteDirective = RemoteSpeechProcessingSystem.getDirective(directive);
  cache.add(remoteDirective);
}

function isCached(directive) {
  // Check if the directive (or a functionally equivalent one) is already in the cache
  return cache.contains(directive);
}

function evictOldest() {
  // Implement cache eviction policy (e.g., LRU, LFU)
}
```

**IV. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Federated Learning:** Train the predictive model across multiple users without sharing individual user data, improving accuracy and privacy.
*   **Personalized Directive Content:** Dynamically generate directive content based on user preferences and context (e.g., "Play my 'Focus' playlist" instead of just "Play music").
*   **Multi-Modal Prediction:** Incorporate data from other sensors (e.g., wearable devices, smart home sensors) to improve prediction accuracy.
