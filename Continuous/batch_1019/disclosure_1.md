## Dynamic Predictive Occlusion Mesh Generation

**Concept:** Instead of solely relying on camera and object movement for encoding differences between frames, proactively generate a dynamic occlusion mesh predicting areas *likely* to be hidden in the next frame based on movement vectors *and* a learned understanding of the game environment’s geometry. This mesh is then used to prioritize encoding, drastically reducing bandwidth by *not* transmitting information about areas already predicted to be occluded.

**Specs:**

*   **Environment Mapping:**  Initial scan of the game environment generates a coarse voxel map. This doesn’t need to be high-resolution, acting more as a “skeleton” for occlusion prediction.  Stored as a sparse octree.
*   **Movement Vector Analysis:** Track all significant moving objects (players, NPCs, projectiles) and the virtual camera. Calculate 3D movement vectors for each frame.
*   **Occlusion Mesh Generation:**
    *   For each frame, project the movement vectors onto the voxel map.
    *   Trace rays from the camera through each voxel, accounting for object positions.
    *   Calculate the probability of a voxel being occluded based on:
        *   Distance from the camera.
        *   Intervening objects (size, distance).
        *   Movement vectors (predicting future positions).
    *   Construct a dynamic occlusion mesh composed of voxels exceeding a probability threshold.  This mesh represents areas likely hidden in the *next* frame.
*   **Encoding Prioritization:**
    *   **Occluded Regions:**  Do *not* encode data for voxels within the occlusion mesh. Assume the decoder can reconstruct these areas based on the previous frame and movement vectors.
    *   **Partial Occlusion:** Voxels partially within the occlusion mesh are encoded with reduced fidelity (lower resolution, fewer color channels).
    *   **Visible Regions:** Encode visible regions with standard or enhanced fidelity based on user bandwidth and game settings.
*   **Decoder Integration:**
    *   Decoder maintains a copy of the sparse octree.
    *   Decoder receives the encoded visible/partially visible regions and reconstructs occluded areas using the octree and movement vectors.
    *   Adaptive refinement of the octree based on decoder reconstruction errors.  Regions with high error rates are refined to improve accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Occlusion Mesh Generation):**

```
function GenerateOcclusionMesh(environmentOctree, movingObjects, cameraPosition, cameraDirection):
  occlusionMesh = new Mesh()
  for each voxel in environmentOctree:
    isOccluded = false
    #Check if voxel is behind any object or the camera itself
    for each object in movingObjects:
      if object.intersects(ray from camera to voxel):
        isOccluded = true
        break
    
    if not isOccluded:
      occlusionMesh.addVoxel(voxel) # Add voxels to mesh

  return occlusionMesh
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Machine Learning:** Train a model to predict occlusion probability based on historical data and game context.
*   **Multi-Layer Occlusion:** Create multiple occlusion layers with varying levels of confidence.
*   **Adaptive Mesh Resolution:** Adjust the resolution of the occlusion mesh based on scene complexity and user bandwidth.
*   **Distributed Occlusion:** Distribute the occlusion calculation across multiple cores or devices.
