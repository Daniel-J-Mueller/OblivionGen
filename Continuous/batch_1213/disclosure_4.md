## Adaptive Shard Migration Based on Query Entropy

**Concept:** Dynamically migrate database shards (partitions) based on real-time analysis of query entropy. This moves beyond static sharding or simple load balancing to proactively position data closer to the queries that need it most, minimizing network latency and maximizing query performance.

**Specification:**

**1. Entropy Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:**  Raw query logs (SQL statements, parameters).
*   **Process:**
    *   Parse queries to identify accessed tables/columns.
    *   Calculate “query entropy” for each shard. Entropy is a measure of the unpredictability of data access. Higher entropy indicates more random access patterns, suggesting data is scattered and potentially expensive to retrieve. Lower entropy suggests focused access, implying data locality.  A suitable entropy formula could be based on Shannon entropy, modified to account for data distribution within the shard.
    *   Formula (example): `Entropy(Shard_i) = - Σ [p(column_j) * log(p(column_j))]` where `p(column_j)` is the probability of accessing column `j` within shard `i` based on recent query logs.
*   **Output:** Entropy score for each shard, updated at a configurable interval (e.g., 5 minutes).

**2. Migration Decision Engine:**

*   **Input:** Entropy scores for all shards, system load metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O), configured migration thresholds (high/low entropy limits), migration cost function (estimates the resources needed for migration).
*   **Process:**
    *   Compare shard entropy to configured thresholds.
    *   Identify shards with high entropy (potential candidates for migration).
    *   Evaluate potential migration targets based on the correlation between query patterns and data distribution in other shards. Aim to move data closer to the queries that need it.
    *   Calculate the “migration benefit” (estimated performance improvement) and “migration cost” for each potential move.
    *   Select the migration candidate that maximizes (Migration Benefit - Migration Cost). This ensures that only beneficial migrations are executed.
*   **Output:** Migration plan: specifies which shard(s) to move, the target shard(s), and the migration schedule.

**3. Migration Coordinator:**

*   **Input:** Migration plan.
*   **Process:**
    *   Initiate a phased migration of data from the source shard to the target shard.  Utilize a consistent hashing algorithm to minimize data disruption.
    *   Implement a read-shadowing technique: direct a small percentage of read requests to the target shard while the migration is in progress.  Verify data consistency before gradually increasing the percentage of read requests.
    *   Once the migration is complete and verified, update the routing tables to direct all read and write requests to the target shard.
    *   Monitor migration progress and rollback if errors occur.
*   **Output:** Confirmation of successful migration or error report.

**Pseudocode (Migration Decision Engine):**

```
function decide_migration():
  entropy_scores = calculate_entropy_scores()
  migration_candidates = []

  for shard_i in shards:
    if entropy_scores[shard_i] > HIGH_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD:
      for shard_j in shards:
        if shard_j != shard_i:
          migration_benefit = estimate_benefit(shard_i, shard_j)
          migration_cost = estimate_cost(shard_i, shard_j)
          net_benefit = migration_benefit - migration_cost

          migration_candidates.append((shard_i, shard_j, net_benefit))

  # Sort candidates by net benefit (descending)
  migration_candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

  if len(migration_candidates) > 0:
    best_candidate = migration_candidates[0]
    source_shard, target_shard, _ = best_candidate
    return source_shard, target_shard
  else:
    return None, None
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Data locality constraints:** Implement rules to prevent data from being migrated too frequently or too far.
*   **Adaptive thresholds:** Dynamically adjust the entropy thresholds based on overall system load and performance.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:**  Train a machine learning model to predict future query patterns and proactively migrate data before it is needed.
