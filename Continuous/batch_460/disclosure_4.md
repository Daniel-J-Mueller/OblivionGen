## Adaptive Entropy-Based Key Derivation

**Concept:** Shift away from solely user-input and iteration-count-based metadata key derivation towards a system that dynamically adjusts key derivation complexity based on observed file system entropy *and* access patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Monitoring Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously calculates the entropy of data blocks within the file system. This isn’t just about file *size* but the *content* – truly random data will have higher entropy than a mostly-zeroed file.
*   **Implementation:** Employ a rolling hash function (e.g., SHA-256) across file system blocks. Maintain a moving average of entropy scores.  The granularity of 'blocks' is configurable (e.g., 4KB, 8KB).
*   **Output:**  A real-time entropy score (0.0 - 1.0) representing overall file system randomness.

**2. Access Pattern Analyzer:**

*   **Function:** Monitors file access requests (read, write, execute) and identifies frequently accessed files/directories, as well as the *types* of access (sequential, random).
*   **Implementation:** Maintain a timestamped access log. Employ a sliding window to track recent access patterns. Calculate 'access concentration' – a measure of how unevenly access is distributed across the file system.
*   **Output:** Access concentration score (0.0 - 1.0) & Recent access log.

**3. Dynamic Key Derivation Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Combines user input, entropy score, access concentration, *and* a dynamically adjusted iteration count to generate the metadata key.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  `base_key = KDF(user_input, salt)` (standard Key Derivation Function – PBKDF2, Argon2)
    2.  `iteration_count = base_iteration_count + (entropy_score * entropy_multiplier) + (access_concentration * access_multiplier)`
    3.  `metadata_key = KDF(base_key, salt, iteration_count)`
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `base_iteration_count`:  Minimum iteration count (configurable).
    *   `entropy_multiplier`:  Weighting factor for entropy score (configurable).
    *   `access_multiplier`: Weighting factor for access concentration (configurable).
    *   `salt`: Random salt value per storage volume.
*   **Key Rotation:** Metadata key rotated at regular intervals *or* triggered by significant changes in entropy or access patterns.

**4. Security Considerations:**

*   **Anti-Entropy Attacks:**  If entropy is artificially low (e.g., all-zero file), enforce a minimum iteration count and potentially flag the volume for audit.
*   **Access Pattern Bias:**  If access is highly predictable, increase the weight of entropy in key derivation.
*   **Side-Channel Resistance:** Choose KDFs with strong side-channel resistance.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```
function derive_metadata_key(user_input, salt, entropy_score, access_concentration):
  base_iteration_count = 10000
  entropy_multiplier = 5000
  access_multiplier = 2000

  iteration_count = base_iteration_count + (entropy_score * entropy_multiplier) + (access_concentration * access_multiplier)

  base_key = KDF(user_input, salt, algorithm="Argon2")

  metadata_key = KDF(base_key, salt, iterations=iteration_count, algorithm="Argon2")

  return metadata_key
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security by adapting to the actual randomness of stored data.
*   Increased resilience against brute-force attacks.
*   Improved key management flexibility.
*   Proactive defense against evolving threat landscapes.
