## Variable Reluctance Acoustic Resonator

**Concept:** Utilize non-uniform magnet spacing (as inspired by the provided patent) not simply to *alter* the generated sound, but to *shape* it into specific, desired acoustic profiles.  Instead of just changing the timbre, create targeted acoustic resonance for applications like directional sound projection or focused sonic cleaning.

**Specifications:**

**I. Rotor Design – Variable Reluctance Rings:**

*   **Material:** High permeability ferromagnetic alloy (e.g., Mu-Metal) for rings, with embedded neodymium magnets.
*   **Construction:** The rotor consists of multiple concentric rings.  Each ring is segmented, and the segments are individually magnetized.
*   **Spacing:**  Segment spacing *within* each ring is non-uniform, precisely calculated based on desired acoustic frequency and directivity.  Spacing *between* rings is also variable, contributing to the complex acoustic profile.
*   **Magnetization Pattern:** Each segment’s magnetization is carefully oriented (radial, axial, tangential, or combinations) to create constructive and destructive interference patterns within the generated sound field.  Magnetization isn’t simply ‘on’ or ‘off’; it’s adjustable in strength and angle for each segment.
*   **Ring Count:** Minimum of 3 rings, up to 10 or more for complex profiles.
*   **Diameter:** Scalable, from a few centimeters to several meters.
*   **Assembly:** Rings are mechanically isolated from each other to prevent vibration transfer. Precision alignment is crucial.

**II. Stator Design – Programmable Coil Matrix:**

*   **Coil Type:** Air-core coils for rapid response.
*   **Arrangement:** 2D matrix of individually addressable coils surrounding the rotor. The matrix must be dense enough to provide fine-grained control over the magnetic field.
*   **Control System:** High-speed digital signal processor (DSP) controlling current to each coil.
*   **Resolution:** Coil matrix resolution must exceed the highest frequency component of the desired acoustic profile.
*   **Cooling:** Forced-air cooling system to dissipate heat generated by the coils.
*   **Driver IC:** Custom designed IC to ensure precise timing and current control for each coil.

**III. Control Algorithm – Acoustic Profile Synthesis:**

*   **Input:** Desired acoustic profile (frequency spectrum, directivity pattern). This can be a pre-defined profile or a real-time signal.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Profile Decomposition:** Decompose the desired profile into a series of harmonic frequencies and corresponding amplitudes.
    2.  **Magnetic Field Calculation:** Calculate the required magnetic field distribution within the rotor to generate those frequencies and amplitudes.  This involves solving Maxwell's equations in a computationally efficient manner (using finite element analysis or similar techniques).
    3.  **Coil Current Assignment:** Assign current values to each coil in the matrix to create the desired magnetic field distribution.
    4.  **Real-Time Adjustment:** Continuously monitor the generated sound field (using microphones) and adjust coil currents to compensate for any discrepancies.
*   **Software:** Custom software running on a high-performance computer.  GUI for profile design and visualization.
*   **Calibration:** Automated calibration routine to map coil currents to magnetic field strength and acoustic output.

**IV. Sensor Integration – Feedback Loop:**

*   **Microphone Array:** High-sensitivity microphone array positioned around the rotor to capture the generated sound field.
*   **Magnetic Field Sensors:** Hall effect sensors embedded within the stator to measure the actual magnetic field distribution.
*   **Data Acquisition:** High-speed data acquisition system to capture sensor data.
*   **Feedback Control:** The control algorithm uses sensor data to create a closed-loop feedback system, allowing for precise control over the generated sound field.



**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
// Initialize parameters: desired_profile, rotor_geometry, stator_geometry

while (true) {
    // 1. Calculate target magnetic field distribution based on desired_profile
    target_field = calculate_target_field(desired_profile, rotor_geometry)

    // 2. Calculate coil currents needed to achieve target_field
    coil_currents = calculate_coil_currents(target_field, stator_geometry)

    // 3. Apply coil_currents to stator coils

    // 4. Measure actual sound field with microphone array

    // 5. Measure actual magnetic field with Hall effect sensors

    // 6. Compare measured values to target values

    // 7. Calculate error

    // 8. Adjust coil_currents based on error (PID control or similar)

    // 9. Repeat
}
```



This design isn’t just about altering sound, but about *sculpting* it – creating complex acoustic fields for specialized applications.  The variable reluctance of the rotor, combined with the programmable stator, provides unprecedented control over the generated sound.
