## Adaptive Risk Thresholding via Predictive Behavioral Modeling

**Specification:**

This system extends the existing risk scoring framework by dynamically adjusting risk thresholds based on predicted behavioral patterns of nodes within the network. Rather than relying on static thresholds, the system learns ‘normal’ behavior and flags deviations with increasing sensitivity.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collection Agent:** Deployed on each node. Collects data points including:
    *   API call frequency & types (if applicable - see claim 18).
    *   Data transfer volume & types.
    *   Communication partner frequency.
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O).
    *   Time-based activity patterns (peak hours, daily/weekly cycles).
2.  **Local Behavioral Profile:** Each node maintains a rolling window of its own behavioral data, building a statistical profile (mean, standard deviation, percentile distributions) for each data point.
3.  **Centralized Predictive Engine:** A server component employing a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM recurrent neural network) trained on aggregated behavioral data from all nodes.  The model predicts future behavior for each node based on historical patterns.
4.  **Dynamic Threshold Generator:**  Based on the predicted behavior from the Predictive Engine, the system generates a personalized risk threshold for each node.  The threshold isn't a fixed value, but a range defined by predicted confidence intervals.  Higher prediction confidence results in tighter thresholds, while lower confidence broadens the range.
5.  **Risk Scoring Integration:** The existing risk scoring engine utilizes these dynamic thresholds when evaluating link and overall node risk.  Deviations from the predicted behavior trigger increased risk scores, with the magnitude of the increase proportional to the degree of deviation and the confidence level of the prediction.
6. **Feedback Loop:** The risk scoring outcomes are fed back into the Predictive Engine, refining the behavioral models and improving prediction accuracy.  False positives and negatives are weighted to adjust model parameters.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Threshold Generation):**

```
function generate_dynamic_threshold(node_id, historical_data, prediction_model):
  predicted_value = prediction_model.predict(node_id, historical_data)
  prediction_confidence = prediction_model.get_confidence_interval(node_id, historical_data)

  // Scale the threshold range based on confidence
  threshold_range = prediction_confidence * scaling_factor

  // Calculate upper and lower bounds
  upper_bound = predicted_value + threshold_range
  lower_bound = predicted_value - threshold_range

  return lower_bound, upper_bound
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Integrate anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns that aren't captured by the predictive models.
*   **Collaborative Filtering:**  Leverage collaborative filtering to identify similar nodes and transfer behavioral knowledge between them.
*   **Game Theory Integration:** Model adversarial behavior and incorporate game theory principles to predict potential attacks and adjust risk thresholds accordingly.
* **Data Provenance Tracking:**  Track the origin and flow of data to enhance risk assessment and identify potential data exfiltration attempts.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication Integration:** Use adaptive risk thresholds to dynamically adjust the level of multi-factor authentication required for node access.

This system moves beyond reactive risk scoring to proactive risk prediction, enabling earlier detection of threats and more effective security measures.  It addresses the limitations of static thresholds by adapting to the unique behavioral characteristics of each node within the network.
