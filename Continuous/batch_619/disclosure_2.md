## Dynamic Encoding Ladder Prediction via Generative AI

**Concept:** Leverage a Generative AI model to predict optimal encoding ladders *before* a live event begins, and dynamically adjust them *during* the event based on real-time data, going beyond simple fraction-of-screen-size monitoring. This system doesn’t just react to changes; it *anticipates* them.

**System Specs:**

*   **AI Model:** A transformer-based generative model (e.g., similar architecture to GPT-3, but trained specifically on video streaming data).
*   **Training Data:**
    *   Historical live stream data (encoding ladders used, client device data – screen size, network type, location, time of day, content category).
    *   Social media trends (pre-event buzz, expected viewership demographics).
    *   Event metadata (sports league, team playing, concert artist, news topic).
    *   Weather data (potential impact on network conditions).
*   **Real-Time Data Inputs:**
    *   Client device data (continuously updated – screen size, network type, location, bandwidth).
    *   Social media activity (sentiment analysis, trending topics related to the event).
    *   CDN performance data (latency, throughput).
*   **Output:** A ranked list of encoding ladders, each with a confidence score indicating its suitability for current and predicted conditions.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Pre-Event Phase:
1. Gather historical data, social media trends, event metadata.
2. Train generative AI model on gathered data.
3. Input event metadata to AI model.
4. AI model generates initial encoding ladder proposals (ranked by confidence).

// Live Event Phase:
1. Monitor real-time data streams (client devices, CDN, social media).
2. Feed real-time data into AI model.
3. AI model continuously refines encoding ladder proposals.
4. Select highest-confidence encoding ladder.
5. Configure live stream encoders with selected ladder.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 at regular intervals (e.g., every 5-10 seconds).

// Adaptive Encoding Ladder Generation (within the AI Model):
function generateEncodingLadder(eventData, realTimeData):
    // Input: Event metadata, real-time data streams
    // Output: Ranked list of encoding ladders

    // 1. Feature Engineering:
    //    - Extract key features from eventData and realTimeData.
    //    - Examples: Screen size distribution, network type prevalence,
    //      social media sentiment, predicted bandwidth availability.

    // 2. Encoding Ladder Generation:
    //    - Use a neural network (within the AI model) to predict optimal
    //      bitrates, resolutions, and codecs for each possible scenario.
    //    - Consider both subjective video quality metrics (e.g., PSNR, VMAF)
    //      and objective bandwidth constraints.

    // 3. Ranking and Selection:
    //    - Assign a confidence score to each generated encoding ladder based on
    //      the model's prediction accuracy and the available data.
    //    - Select the encoding ladder with the highest confidence score.

    return rankedEncodingLadders
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers with GPUs for AI model training and inference.
*   Scalable data storage for historical data and real-time data streams.
*   Real-time data processing pipeline for data ingestion and feature extraction.
*   API integration with existing live stream encoders and CDN.
*   Machine Learning Framework: PyTorch or TensorFlow.

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond reactive adjustments based on observed changes in client device characteristics. It proactively *predicts* optimal encoding ladders by leveraging a generative AI model trained on a diverse dataset, creating a truly adaptive live streaming experience. This should be novel in its proactive approach, and its application of generative AI to real-time encoding ladder adjustments.
