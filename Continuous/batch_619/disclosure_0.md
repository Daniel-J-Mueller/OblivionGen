## Acoustic RF Mapping & Behavioral Prediction

**Core Concept:** Expand the RF monitoring system to incorporate passive acoustic sensing alongside radio frequency analysis, creating a multi-modal dataset for enhanced behavioral prediction and anomaly detection.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Microphone Array: Integrate a small-form-factor microphone array (4-8 elements) into the existing RF monitoring device enclosure.  Array should be optimized for detecting human speech and common household sounds (footsteps, appliance operation) within a 5-10 meter radius.
    *   Acoustic Pre-Processor: Dedicated DSP or FPGA for real-time acoustic signal processing (noise reduction, beamforming, feature extraction).
    *   Synchronized Data Acquisition: Hardware and software synchronization between RF receiver and microphone array, ensuring precise timestamping of both RF and acoustic data.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Acoustic Feature Extraction:** Implement algorithms to extract relevant acoustic features:
        *   Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for speech/sound classification.
        *   Sound Event Detection (SED): Algorithms to identify specific sound events (e.g., breaking glass, dog barking, human speech).
        *   Acoustic Scene Classification:  Determine the overall acoustic environment (e.g., living room, kitchen, bedroom).
    *   **RF/Acoustic Data Fusion:** Develop algorithms to fuse RF and acoustic data streams.  Potential approaches:
        *   Early Fusion: Concatenate RF features and acoustic features before applying machine learning models.
        *   Late Fusion: Train separate models on RF and acoustic data, then combine their predictions.
        *   Attention Mechanisms: Utilize attention mechanisms to dynamically weight the contributions of RF and acoustic data based on their relevance.
    *   **Behavioral Prediction Models:** Train machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to predict occupant behavior based on fused RF/acoustic data. Possible predictions:
        *   Room Occupancy:  Determine which rooms are occupied and by how many people.
        *   Activity Recognition: Identify occupant activities (e.g., watching TV, cooking, sleeping).
        *   Anomaly Detection:  Detect unusual patterns of behavior that may indicate security threats or medical emergencies.
    *   **RF Localization Enhancement:** Utilize acoustic triangulation to refine RF signal localization.  Combining RF signal strength with time-of-flight measurements from acoustic signals can significantly improve location accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Data Structures
struct RF_Data {
    UID: String,
    SignalStrength: Float,
    Timestamp: Long,
    Location: Coordinates
};

struct Acoustic_Data {
    SoundEvent: String,
    Confidence: Float,
    Timestamp: Long,
    Location: Coordinates
};

// Function: DetectAnomaly
function DetectAnomaly(RF_DataList, Acoustic_DataList): Boolean {
    // 1. Feature Extraction
    RF_Features = ExtractFeatures(RF_DataList);  // e.g., UID frequency, signal strength trends
    Acoustic_Features = ExtractFeatures(Acoustic_DataList); // e.g., sound event types, sound intensity

    // 2. Data Fusion
    FusedFeatures = Concatenate(RF_Features, Acoustic_Features);

    // 3. Anomaly Detection Model (Trained beforehand)
    AnomalyScore = AnomalyDetectionModel.Predict(FusedFeatures);

    // 4. Thresholding
    if (AnomalyScore > AnomalyThreshold) {
        return True; // Anomaly detected
    } else {
        return False; // No anomaly
    }
}
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond simple RF signature analysis to create a richer, multi-modal understanding of the environment. This allows for more accurate behavioral prediction and more robust anomaly detection, potentially enabling proactive security measures and personalized smart home experiences. The system doesn't just *detect* presence, it infers *intent*.
