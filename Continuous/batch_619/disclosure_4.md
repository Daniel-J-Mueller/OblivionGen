## Dynamic Resource Swapping & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the variable capacity idea to allow *swapping* allocated resource types (CPU, memory, GPU) within the reserved capacity, proactively predicted based on workload behavior, and automated via a predictive engine. This moves beyond simple scaling *within* a resource type to active *shifting* between them.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Engine Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical workload data (CPU utilization, memory pressure, GPU load, request types, service levels), customer-defined performance/cost priorities (weighting factors), current resource allocation.
*   **Algorithm:** Hybrid model combining time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for baseline prediction and a reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Network) to optimize resource swaps. The RL agent learns to maximize a reward function based on performance metrics (latency, throughput) and cost.
*   **Output:** Recommended resource swap schedule (resource type, quantity, timing). Confidence score for the recommendation.
*   **Frequency:**  Adjustable by the customer (e.g., hourly, daily). Real-time override capability.

**2. Resource Swap Orchestrator:**

*   **Input:** Recommended swap schedule from Predictive Engine, current resource allocation, available reserved capacity.
*   **Process:**
    *   Validate swap feasibility (ensuring sufficient available capacity of target resource type).
    *   Initiate resource swap via platform APIs.
    *   Monitor swap execution and rollback if errors occur.
    *   Log swap details (timestamp, resource types, quantities).
*   **Output:** Confirmation of swap completion. Error messages if applicable.

**3. User Interface (API & Dashboard):**

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /resource_swap/schedule`: Submit custom swap schedules (for advanced users).
    *   `GET /resource_swap/history`: Retrieve swap history for a specified time period.
    *   `GET /resource_swap/recommendations`: Display current and upcoming recommendations.
*   **Dashboard Visualizations:**
    *   Real-time resource utilization graphs.
    *   Predicted resource needs (based on Predictive Engine).
    *   Recommended swaps (with estimated cost/performance impact).
    *   Historical swap data (performance and cost savings).

**4.  Billing Integration:**

*   Dynamically adjust billing based on *actual* resource utilization *after* swaps.
*   Offer tiered pricing for proactively accepted recommendations (incentivizing customer adoption).
*   Provide detailed cost breakdown for each swap event.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Engine - Simplified):**

```
function predict_resource_needs(historical_data, priorities):
  // Time series forecasting to estimate base resource needs
  base_needs = forecast(historical_data)

  // Reinforcement learning agent to optimize swaps
  state = current_resource_allocation
  for each time_step:
    action = RL_agent.choose_action(state, base_needs, priorities) // action = [resource_type, quantity]
    new_state = apply_swap(state, action)
    reward = calculate_reward(new_state, base_needs, priorities)
    RL_agent.learn(state, action, reward, new_state)
    state = new_state

  return RL_agent.recommended_swap_schedule
```

**Novelty:**  This extends variable capacity beyond simply scaling within a resource. It introduces *active swapping* based on *prediction*, optimizing for both performance and cost, potentially unlocking significantly greater resource efficiency.  The integration of reinforcement learning allows the system to adapt to complex and changing workloads over time.
