## Adaptive Acoustic Focusing Door System

**Core Concept:** Leverage the door viewer assembly not just for visual data, but as a directional acoustic sensor array, coupled with active noise cancellation and localized audio projection. The system aims to enhance privacy, security, and communication through precise audio manipulation.

**I. Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Viewer Unit:** Modified viewer housing to incorporate a circular array of miniature MEMS microphones (minimum 8, optimally 16) integrated around the camera lens. Housing material to include sound dampening properties (dense polymer or composite).
*   **Microphone Array:**
    *   Type: MEMS, low-noise, high sensitivity.
    *   Frequency Response: 20Hz – 20kHz.
    *   A/D Conversion: 24-bit, integrated within the viewer unit.
*   **Speaker Array:** Miniature, flat-panel speakers embedded within the interior door component (opposite the viewer unit). Minimum 4 speakers, strategically positioned to create localized audio zones.
*   **Processing Unit:** Integrated within the interior door component.
    *   Processor: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 (or equivalent).
    *   RAM: 4GB DDR4.
    *   Storage: 32GB eMMC.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.2.
*   **Power:** Powered via existing door chime wiring (if available) or dedicated power adapter. Internal rechargeable battery backup.
*   **Flexible Connector:** Expanded functionality to include shielded data lines for microphone array & speaker array communication.
*   **Exterior Component Housing:** Weather resistant, tamper proof.

**II. Software & Algorithmic Implementation:**

1.  **Directional Audio Localization:** 
    *   Beamforming algorithms to identify sound sources based on microphone array data. 
    *   Estimate angle of arrival (AoA) of sound. 
    *   Implementation in Python/C++ with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and potentially dedicated audio processing libraries.

2.  **Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):**
    *   Real-time ANC based on localized noise sources identified by the microphone array.
    *   Adaptive filtering algorithms to generate anti-noise signals through the speaker array.
    *   Emphasis on cancelling external noise *before* it enters the room.

3.  **Localized Audio Projection:**
    *   Ability to project audio to specific areas within the room.
    *   Utilize speaker array to create focused sound zones.
    *   Application: Directed alerts (e.g., "Someone is at the door"), localized music playback.

4.  **AI-Powered Sound Classification:**
    *   Machine learning model trained to identify specific sounds: speech, knocking, shouting, breaking glass, etc.
    *   Trigger actions based on sound classification (e.g., send alert to smartphone, initiate recording).

5.  **Integration with Smart Home Ecosystem:**
    *   API for integration with platforms like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit.
    *   Voice control for system functions.

**III. Operational Modes:**

*   **Privacy Mode:** Suppresses external sounds, enhances internal audio.
*   **Security Mode:** Activates AI-powered sound classification, sends alerts upon detection of suspicious sounds.
*   **Communication Mode:** Enables two-way audio communication with person at the door. 
*   **Ambient Mode:**  Balances external and internal audio for situational awareness.

**IV. Pseudocode – Sound Source Localization:**

```pseudocode
// Input: Microphone array data (amplitude & phase) from each microphone
// Output: Azimuth & Elevation angles of dominant sound source

function localizeSoundSource(microphoneData):
    // 1. Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) calculation
    tdoaValues = calculateTDOA(microphoneData)

    // 2. Estimate angles based on TDOA
    azimuth, elevation = estimateAngles(tdoaValues)

    // 3. Apply calibration data to correct for microphone array imperfections
    calibratedAzimuth, calibratedElevation = applyCalibration(azimuth, elevation)

    return calibratedAzimuth, calibratedElevation
```

**V. Future Considerations:**

*   Haptic Feedback: Integrate haptic feedback into the door handle to provide tactile alerts.
*   Biometric Authentication: Add voice recognition for secure access control.
*   External Sensor Integration: Integrate with external sensors (motion detectors, cameras) for enhanced security.
