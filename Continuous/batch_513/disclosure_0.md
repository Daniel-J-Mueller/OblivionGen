**Adaptive Resonance Basket System - "Chameleon Catch"**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple height/rotation adjustment to actively *shape* the basket itself to conform to the incoming item(s), maximizing impact absorption and guiding items into the receptacle. This is accomplished using a network of small, individually controlled pneumatic or electromechanical actuators embedded within the basket's ‘catch material’.

**Specifications:**

*   **Basket Material:** Woven polymer mesh with embedded micro-actuators (see Actuator Details). Mesh density variable – tighter weave at base for support, looser weave at top for flexibility.
*   **Actuator Details:** Miniature pneumatic cylinders (5mm diameter, 10mm stroke) or shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators distributed throughout the basket material in a grid pattern (10cm spacing). Each actuator controls a small section of the mesh, allowing localized deformation. Actuators are individually addressable.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Time-of-Flight (ToF) Array:** Short-range ToF sensors (4x4 array) mounted above the basket to create a 3D point cloud of incoming items *before* impact. This data informs the basket’s shape adaptation.
    *   **Force Sensing Resistive (FSR) Array:** Array of FSR sensors embedded *within* the basket mesh to monitor impact forces and refine the adaptation algorithm in real-time.
    *   **Receptacle Level Sensor:** Existing sensor (as in provided patent) to monitor receptacle fill level.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Preprocessing Module:** Processes ToF data to identify item shape, size, velocity, and predicted impact point.
    *   **Adaptation Algorithm:**  A predictive algorithm that calculates the optimal basket shape *before* impact. The algorithm will:
        1.  Pre-inflate/contract actuators to create a concave surface at the predicted impact point.
        2.  Adjust actuator pressure/current based on item weight and velocity (higher weight/velocity = greater pre-deformation).
        3.  Implement a ‘ripple effect’ - actuators adjacent to the impact point activate sequentially to guide the item towards the receptacle.
    *   **Real-Time Feedback Loop:**  FSR data is fed back into the adaptation algorithm to fine-tune actuator control during impact. The algorithm adjusts actuator pressure/current to maintain optimal impact absorption and guidance.
*   **Frame Integration:** The static and moving frame assemblies from the provided patent remain largely unchanged. The adaptive basket replaces the fixed basket. The actuator control system interfaces with the existing controller.
*   **Power:** Dedicated power supply for actuators.

FUNCTION AdaptBasket(ToF_Data, FSR_Data, ReceptacleLevel)

    // PREPROCESSING
    itemShape = AnalyzeToFData(ToF_Data)
    impactPoint = CalculateImpactPoint(itemShape)
    itemWeight = EstimateItemWeight(itemShape)

    FOR EACH Actuator IN ActuatorArray
        distance = CalculateDistance(Actuator, impactPoint)
        IF distance < threshold
            activationLevel = CalculateActivationLevel(distance, itemWeight, itemVelocity)

    ENDFOR

    // REAL-TIME FEEDBACK LOOP
    WHILE ImpactDetected()
        FOR EACH FSR IN FSRArray
            force = ReadFSR(FSR)
            IF force > threshold
                adjustActuatorLevel(FSR, force)  // Fine-tune actuator control based on force

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Powered Learning:** Implement a machine learning algorithm to analyze impact data and optimize the adaptation algorithm over time.
*   **Variable Mesh Density:** Control mesh density locally using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to further optimize impact absorption.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrate haptic feedback into the system to provide operators with information about item characteristics.
