## Dynamic Notification ‘Bubbles’ & Spatial Audio Integration

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of identity-based display to a fully spatial, augmented reality notification system. Instead of merely displaying excerpts on a screen, project contextual notifications *around* the user in 3D space, anchored to the perceived origin of the communication.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a device with:
    *   High-resolution outward-facing camera (for spatial mapping & identity detection).
    *   Array of micro-projectors/directional audio emitters (integrated into device casing – imagine a phone/tablet with multiple tiny, focused projectors and speakers).
    *   Depth sensor (LiDAR or similar) – crucial for accurate spatial placement.
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time image/audio rendering and spatial audio processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Identity Engine:** (Builds upon existing patent’s identity detection) - Uses image data from the camera to identify individuals in the user’s field of view.  Expanded functionality: Not just *who* is communicating, but emotional state (from facial expression analysis) influencing notification style.
    *   **Spatial Mapping & Anchoring:**  Creates a real-time 3D map of the user's surroundings. Detects surfaces (walls, tables, etc.) and anchors notifications *relative* to the identified sender’s last known position (if sender is in view) or a general direction (if sender is not in view but known location is stored).
    *   **Notification Renderer:**  Generates visual ‘bubbles’ (holographic-like projections) containing the communication excerpt. Bubble appearance (color, size, animation) is dynamically adjusted based on:
        *   Sender identity (familiarity, relationship).
        *   Emotional state of sender (detected from image data).
        *   Communication urgency (determined by keywords, sender priority).
    *   **Spatial Audio Engine:**  Generates audio cues associated with the notification bubbles.  Audio source is localized to the bubble’s position in 3D space. Voice snippets from the sender (if available) are prioritized.  Music or sound effects modulate based on notification type/urgency.
    *   **User Interface (Gestural Control):** User interacts with notifications through hand gestures:
        *   'Grab' a bubble to expand it into a full-screen view.
        *   'Swipe' to dismiss.
        *   'Rotate' a bubble to reveal additional information.
*   **Pseudocode (Notification Projection Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    CAPTURE_IMAGE()
    IDENTIFY_SENDERS(image)
    FOR EACH sender IN senders:
        GET_LAST_KNOWN_POSITION(sender) //Could be from camera or known location
        DETERMINE_PRIORITY(sender, communication)
        GENERATE_BUBBLE_APPEARANCE(priority, sender)
        GENERATE_AUDIO_CUE(priority, sender, communication)
        PROJECT_BUBBLE(bubble_appearance, audio_cue, last_known_position)
    END LOOP
```

*   **Example Scenario:** A colleague walks into the room. The device identifies them and projects a small, blue bubble near their shoulder containing a message excerpt: “Quick update on the project…”  The audio cue is a gentle chime. If that same colleague is visibly frustrated (detected via facial analysis), the bubble could turn orange, and the audio cue could be slightly more urgent.

*   **Refinements:**
    *   Integrate with calendar/scheduling apps to project reminders as spatial notifications.
    *   Allow users to customize notification appearance/audio profiles for individual contacts.
    *   Explore integration with AR glasses for a truly immersive experience.
    *   Add a ‘focus’ mode where notifications are automatically filtered based on user activity/location.
