## Dynamic Gesture Priming via Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend gesture recognition beyond simple classification by *priming* the system with haptic feedback corresponding to anticipated movements. This allows for more nuanced gesture control, predictive input, and potentially the creation of "gesture blends" – combining multiple gestures into a single fluid motion.

**Specs:**

1.  **Haptic Interface:** Develop a wearable haptic device (glove, sleeve, or band) containing an array of micro-actuators capable of applying localized pressure and vibration to the user’s skin.  The device will cover key muscle groups involved in gesture execution – primarily the forearm, wrist, and hand.

2.  **Pre-Gesture Haptic Patterns:** Create a library of haptic patterns, each corresponding to the *initial* phase of a recognized gesture. These patterns are subtle and designed to "prime" the user's muscles for the intended movement. Example: A slight pressure increase on the thenar eminence to subtly encourage a fist-making gesture.

3.  **Real-Time Haptic Modulation:**  Integrate the haptic interface with the gesture recognition system (as defined in the source patent).  Upon initial gesture *attempt* (detected via skeletal model vectors), the system activates the corresponding pre-gesture haptic pattern.

4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Implement an algorithm which dynamically adjusts the haptic feedback based on the *actual* skeletal model vectors.  If the user deviates from the intended gesture, the haptic feedback subtly corrects the movement.  Think of it as a gentle "guiding hand."

5.  **Gesture Blending:**  Enable the system to recognize *sequences* of gestures, creating blended commands. The haptic feedback will transition smoothly between patterns, guiding the user through complex movements.  Example: A quick "swipe up" followed by a "pinch" could trigger a specific action. The system leverages the haptic feedback to ensure the transition between gestures is fluid and recognized correctly.

6. **Training Mode:** Incorporate a training mode where the system learns user-specific movement patterns and calibrates the haptic feedback accordingly. This ensures optimal performance and comfort.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Loop):**

```
// Input: Skeletal Model Vector (SMV), Current Gesture Prediction (CGP),
//        User Calibration Data (UCD)

function generateHapticFeedback(SMV, CGP, UCD) {

  // 1. Determine Initial Haptic Pattern
  initialPattern = getInitialHapticPattern(CGP)

  // 2. Apply User Calibration
  calibratedPattern = applyUserCalibration(initialPattern, UCD)

  // 3. Dynamic Adjustment based on SMV
  deviation = calculateDeviation(SMV, expectedSMV(CGP))

  adjustmentFactor = map(deviation, -threshold, +threshold, 0, 1) // Scale deviation to 0-1

  finalPattern = modulateHapticPattern(calibratedPattern, adjustmentFactor)

  // 4. Activate Haptic Actuators
  activateHapticActuators(finalPattern)
}

function expectedSMV(CGP) {
  // Based on the CGP, return an expected skeletal model vector
  // for the gesture
}

function calculateDeviation(SMV, expectedSMV) {
  // Returns the difference between the actual SMV and the expected SMV
}
```
