## Dynamic File-Aware Presence Indicators

**Specification:** Implement a system where files shared via the sharing service trigger dynamic presence indicators within the messaging client, going beyond simple "online/offline" status.

**Concept:** The patent details a system for commenting *on* files. This inspires a shift toward the files themselves being active communicators. Instead of users actively seeking updates, files *signal* their state.

**Detailed Specs:**

1.  **File State Metadata:** Each file stored on the sharing service will have associated metadata detailing "activity level." This isn't just last modified date. It's calculated based on:
    *   Number of views in the last X hours/days.
    *   Number of comments/edits in the last X hours/days.
    *   Number of unique users accessing the file in the last X hours/days.
    *   (Optional) Automated analysis of content changes – e.g., a document with significant textual changes triggers a higher activity level.

2.  **Activity Level Tiers:**  Define activity tiers (e.g., "Dormant", "Low", "Moderate", "High", "Critical"). Each tier has a corresponding visual indicator within the messaging client.

3.  **Messaging Client Integration:**
    *   When a file is shared in a message, the messaging client displays a small icon/visual cue next to the file name indicating its current activity level.
    *   Users can configure the messaging client to receive notifications when a shared file's activity level *changes* tier (e.g., from "Low" to "High").  This is configurable per file or globally.
    *   Hovering over the activity indicator displays a tooltip with more detailed activity information (e.g., "12 views in the last hour, 3 new comments").

4.  **Presence Indicators beyond Online/Offline:**  Replace the standard "online/offline" status for *users* with a system that reflects their engagement with shared files. A user who is actively viewing/commenting on files will have a more prominent/active presence indicator.

5.  **Notification Filtering:**  Allow users to filter notifications based on file activity level. For example, a user might choose to only receive notifications for files with "High" or "Critical" activity.

**Pseudocode (Messaging Client - File Display):**

```
function displaySharedFile(file) {
  activityLevel = getFileActivityLevel(file)
  icon = getActivityIcon(activityLevel) // Returns appropriate icon based on tier
  display(file.name + " " + icon)

  onHover(file.name) {
    displayTooltip(getFileActivityDetails(file))
  }
}

function getFileActivityLevel(file) {
  // Calculate activity based on views, comments, edits, etc.
  // Return tier ("Dormant", "Low", "Moderate", "High", "Critical")
}

function getActivityIcon(tier) {
  // Return icon based on tier
}

function getFileActivityDetails(file) {
  // Return detailed activity information as a string
}
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **AI-Driven Activity Analysis:** Use AI to analyze file content changes and automatically adjust activity levels.
*   **Collaborative Activity Indicators:** Show *who* is actively engaged with a file in real-time (e.g., a small avatar next to the file name).
*   **Integration with Task Management Systems:**  Link file activity to tasks – e.g., a file with high activity might trigger a task assignment.
