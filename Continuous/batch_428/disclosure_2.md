## Dynamic Service Image 'Chaining' & Automated Workflow Composition

**Concept:** Expand the core idea of hosted service images into a system where these images aren't just *executed* but *chained* together to create automated workflows. Think of it as 'serverless functions' but with more complex, stateful applications encapsulated within the service image itself.

**Specs:**

*   **Workflow Definition Language (WDL):** A declarative language for defining workflows, specifying service image sequence, data passing mechanisms, conditional branching, and error handling.  WDL will be JSON-based, focused on readability and machine parsing.  Example:

```json
{
  "workflow_name": "ImageProcessingPipeline",
  "start_image": "image_id_123",
  "steps": [
    {
      "image_id": "image_id_123",
      "name": "ImageUpload",
      "output_data": ["uploaded_image_url"],
      "next_step": "image_resize"
    },
    {
      "image_id": "image_id_456",
      "name": "ImageResize",
      "input_data": ["uploaded_image_url"],
      "output_data": ["resized_image_url"],
      "next_step": "object_detect"
    },
    {
      "image_id": "image_id_789",
      "name": "ObjectDetect",
      "input_data": ["resized_image_url"],
      "output_data": ["detected_objects"],
      "next_step": "end"
    }
  ]
}
```

*   **Workflow Orchestrator:** A central component responsible for:
    *   Parsing WDL definitions.
    *   Spinning up virtual computing device instances for each service image in the workflow.
    *   Managing data flow between instances (using a message queue or shared storage).
    *   Handling errors and retries.
    *   Monitoring workflow execution.

*   **Data Serialization/Deserialization Layer:** A standardized layer for converting data between different service image formats.  Utilizes Protocol Buffers for efficient and versioned data exchange.

*   **'Image Registry' Extensions:**  The existing service image catalog expands to include metadata about workflow compatibility (input/output schemas, supported data formats).  Images are tagged with 'workflow role' attributes (e.g., 'data ingestion', 'data transformation', 'machine learning inference').

*   **Dynamic Scaling:** The orchestrator monitors resource utilization and automatically scales the number of instances for each service image in the workflow based on demand.  Leverages Kubernetes-style horizontal pod autoscaling.

*   **Visual Workflow Designer:** A drag-and-drop interface for creating and editing workflows.  Users can select service images from the catalog, connect them together, and configure data flow without writing code.

*   **'Workflow Templates':** Pre-built workflows for common use cases (e.g., 'image processing pipeline', 'data ETL process', 'customer onboarding').  Users can customize these templates to fit their specific needs.

**Pseudocode (Orchestrator):**

```
function executeWorkflow(workflowDefinition):
  // 1. Parse workflow definition
  steps = parseWorkflow(workflowDefinition)

  // 2. Create instances for each step
  instances = {}
  for step in steps:
    instances[step.name] = createVirtualInstance(step.image_id, step.configuration)

  // 3. Connect instances and transfer data
  for i in range(len(steps) - 1):
    current_step = steps[i]
    next_step = steps[i+1]

    // Transfer data from current step's output to next step's input
    data = getDataFromInstance(instances[current_step.name], current_step.output_data)
    sendDataToInstance(instances[next_step.name], next_step.input_data, data)

  // 4. Monitor execution and handle errors
  for step in steps:
    status = monitorInstance(instances[step.name])
    if status == ERROR:
      // Implement error handling logic (retry, rollback, etc.)
      handleError(instances[step.name])

  // 5. Collect results
  results = {}
  for step in steps:
    results[step.name] = getResultsFromInstance(instances[step.name])

  return results
```
