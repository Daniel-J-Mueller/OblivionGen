## Modular Aerial Vehicle with Bio-Inspired Articulating Wings

**Concept:** Develop an aerial vehicle utilizing a bonded frame similar to the provided patent, but incorporating fully articulating wing sections inspired by bird flight. This moves beyond fixed-wing or simple flapping-wing designs to achieve enhanced maneuverability, efficiency, and stability.

**I. Structural Specifications:**

*   **Bonded Frame Core:** Utilize adhesive bonding techniques as detailed in the patent for the central structural components: horizontal strut, vertical struts, forward/aft central bulkheads. Materials: Carbon fiber reinforced polymer matrix.
*   **Wing Segmentation:** Each wing (upper & lower) will be divided into 5-7 independently articulating segments. Each segment will be a miniature bonded structure composed of carbon fiber spars and ribs.
*   **Articulation Mechanism:** Each segment will connect to adjacent segments via a miniature rotary actuator (brushless DC motor with high gear ratio) housed within a sealed pod. Actuation controlled by a central flight controller.
*   **Segment Communication:** Each segment pod will contain an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and a short-range wireless communication module (Bluetooth Low Energy or similar) to provide feedback to the central flight controller.
*   **Skin:** A flexible, durable polymer skin will cover each segment, creating an aerofoil shape. The skin will be textured for improved airflow.

**II. Control System Specifications:**

*   **Flight Controller:** A custom flight controller board with a powerful processor (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 or similar) and real-time operating system.
*   **Control Algorithm:** A model predictive control (MPC) algorithm will be implemented to coordinate the articulation of each wing segment. The MPC will optimize for lift, drag, and stability based on sensor data and pilot input.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   IMUs within each wing segment.
    *   GPS module.
    *   Barometer.
    *   Airspeed sensor.
    *   Optional: Computer vision system for obstacle avoidance.
*   **Pilot Interface:** Wireless remote control with joystick, throttle, and programmable buttons. Augmented reality overlay displaying flight data and system status.

**III. Propulsion System Specifications:**

*   **Motor Mounts:** Integrate existing motor mount specifications from patent.
*   **Motors:** High-efficiency brushless DC motors.
*   **Propellers:** Optimized for both forward flight and hovering.
*   **Power Source:** High-density lithium polymer batteries.
