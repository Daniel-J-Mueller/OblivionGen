## Dynamic Segment Prioritization & Adaptive Replication

**Concept:** Extend the asset-level management to incorporate real-time segment prioritization based on user viewing patterns and predictive analytics, influencing replication strategy. Instead of static replica counts, the system proactively adjusts replication based on anticipated demand for specific segments.

**Specs:**

**1. Segment Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Real-time viewing data (segment requests, watch time, completion rates) per subscriber/group.
    *   Historical viewing data (long-term trends, seasonal variations).
    *   Program guide data (upcoming shows, live events).
    *   User profile data (preferences, demographics).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a weighted scoring algorithm to assign a ‘priority score’ to each segment. Weights are adjustable via configuration. Factors include:
        *   Current demand (recent requests).
        *   Predicted demand (based on historical trends and program guide data).
        *   User preference (segment aligns with user's preferred genre/actors).
        *   Segment criticality (e.g., beginning/end of a program, live event segment).
    *   Priority scores are dynamically updated (e.g., every minute) to reflect changing demand.

**2. Adaptive Replication Manager:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Asset data (including existing replica count).
    *   Segment priority scores.
    *   Storage resource availability.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor segment priority scores.
    *   If a segment’s priority score exceeds a predefined threshold:
        *   Increase the number of replicas for that segment. (Allocate resources from lower priority segments).
        *   Prioritize storage of the new replicas on geographically diverse storage resources.
    *   If a segment’s priority score falls below a predefined threshold:
        *   Reduce the number of replicas for that segment (release resources for other segments).
    *   Employ a ‘hysteresis’ mechanism to prevent excessive replica fluctuations.
    *   Integrate with a predictive scaling system to proactively pre-replicate segments *before* demand spikes (e.g., anticipating a live event).

**3.  Storage Resource Manager Integration:**

*   The Adaptive Replication Manager communicates with a Storage Resource Manager to:
    *   Allocate storage space for new replicas.
    *   Release storage space for removed replicas.
    *   Optimize replica placement based on network proximity to subscribers (edge caching).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Replication Manager - core logic):**

```
function updateReplicas(asset, segment, priorityScore):
  thresholdHigh = getConfig("replication.threshold.high")
  thresholdLow = getConfig("replication.threshold.low")
  currentReplicas = asset.getSegmentReplicas(segment)

  if priorityScore > thresholdHigh:
    targetReplicas = min(maxReplicas, currentReplicas + 1) #Cap replicas
    if targetReplicas > currentReplicas:
      replicateSegment(segment, targetReplicas - currentReplicas)
  elif priorityScore < thresholdLow:
    targetReplicas = max(minReplicas, currentReplicas - 1) # Ensure at least minReplicas
    if targetReplicas < currentReplicas:
      removeReplicas(segment, currentReplicas - targetReplicas)
```

**Novelty:** The existing patent focuses on a *static* number of replicas defined per asset. This extends that by introducing a *dynamic* replication strategy driven by real-time and predictive analytics, optimizing storage resource utilization and improving QoE. Instead of simply storing a fixed number of copies, the system intelligently adapts to changing viewing patterns. It's a proactive rather than reactive system.
