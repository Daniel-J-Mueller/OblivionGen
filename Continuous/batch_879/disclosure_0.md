## Modular Electronic Device with Kinetic Energy Harvesting & Adaptive Morphology

**Concept:** An electronic device incorporating flexible, interconnected modules capable of dynamically reconfiguring their physical shape *and* harvesting energy from user movement. Modules communicate wirelessly and share power.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** 50mm x 30mm x 8mm (approx. credit card size, but flexible).
*   **Module Interconnects:** Magnetic, multi-directional connectors on all edges allowing for secure, temporary attachment to adjacent modules. Connectors should include data & low-voltage power transfer contacts.
*   **Module Core:** Flexible PCB incorporating:
    *   Microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M4 or equivalent)
    *   Bluetooth 5.0/LE transceiver
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope (IMU) – 6DoF minimum
    *   Piezoelectric energy harvester (covering ~25% of module surface)
    *   Small solid-state battery (rechargeable, ~50mAh capacity)
    *   Miniature e-paper display (25mm x 10mm, grayscale)
    *   Haptic feedback actuator (small vibration motor)
*   **Morphing Mechanism:** Each module contains a single, centrally located micro-actuator (shape memory alloy or micro-hydraulic) capable of causing a slight, localized bend (5-10 degrees) in the module. Actuation is controlled by the microcontroller.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Module Communication:** Wireless mesh network protocol for inter-module communication.
    *   **Kinetic Energy Harvesting:** Algorithm to optimize piezoelectric energy harvesting based on detected movement patterns. Energy is stored in the module’s battery and shared across the network.
    *   **Adaptive Morphology Control:** Algorithm to dynamically adjust module shapes to optimize for different configurations and user interactions (e.g., forming a stand, creating a curved display, adapting to grip). User-definable ‘morphing presets’ and open API for custom configurations.
    *   **Display Functionality:** Displays can be synchronized to create larger displays, or operate independently to show module-specific information.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Flexible PCB substrate (polyimide)
    *   Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) outer casing for flexibility and durability.
    *   Neodymium magnets for module connections.

**Operational Example:**

A user could link multiple modules together to create a flexible display screen. The screen could then bend and conform to a curved surface. The movement of the user’s hand while interacting with the screen would power the device via the piezoelectric harvesters. Modules could re-arrange themselves to form a stand for the device, and the e-paper displays would show status information.

**Pseudocode for Adaptive Morphology:**

```
FUNCTION adjust_morphology(configuration_request):
    // configuration_request contains desired shape parameters
    // (e.g., curvature, length, angle)

    FOR EACH module IN module_network:
        target_angle = calculate_target_angle(module, configuration_request)
        current_angle = read_module_angle(module)

        IF current_angle != target_angle:
            activate_micro_actuator(module, target_angle)
            delay(actuation_time)
            read_module_angle(module) //Verify actuation
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    return success/failure
```
