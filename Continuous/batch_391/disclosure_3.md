## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Adaptive Access Control

**Concept:** Leverage device behavior *beyond* initial authentication to create a dynamic trust score, influencing access permissions in real-time. This goes beyond simply rotating credentials; it's about continuously assessing risk and adapting security posture.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Points:**
    *   Network connection type (WiFi, Cellular, VPN).
    *   Geolocation accuracy & consistency.
    *   Device sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope - usage patterns).
    *   App usage frequency & patterns.
    *   Keystroke dynamics (optional, user consent required).
    *   Time of day/week of access attempts.
    *   Resource access patterns (what data/services are being requested).
*   **Implementation:** Agent running on user device (SDK).  Data is anonymized & encrypted in transit. Minimal battery impact is *critical*.
*   **Frequency:** Data streaming with adjustable frequency (1-5Hz).

**2. Trust Scoring Engine (Server-Side):**

*   **Algorithm:**  Machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on a dataset of normal/anomalous device behavior.
*   **Scoring Range:** 0-100 (0 = Untrusted, 100 = Highly Trusted).
*   **Factors:** Weighted average of behavioral data points. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on the service being accessed (e.g., higher weight on geolocation for financial transactions).
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identifies deviations from established baseline behavior.  Thresholds are configurable.

**3. Adaptive Access Control Policy Engine:**

*   **Policy Definition:**  Rules that map trust scores to access permissions.
    *   Example:
        *   If Trust Score >= 80: Full Access
        *   If 60 <= Trust Score < 80: Limited Access (e.g., read-only, reduced functionality)
        *   If Trust Score < 60: Access Denied / Multi-Factor Authentication Required
*   **Granularity:** Policies can be defined at the service level, resource level, or even individual API call level.
*   **Real-Time Enforcement:**  Access control decisions are made in real-time based on the current trust score.

**4. Communication Protocol:**

*   **Secure Channel:** TLS 1.3 or higher.
*   **Data Format:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for transmitting trust scores & access policies.
*   **Frequency:** Trust score updates transmitted every 1-5 seconds.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side - Access Control Decision):**

```
function decideAccess(userId, serviceId, requestedResource, trustScore):
  policy = getAccessPolicy(serviceId, requestedResource)
  if trustScore >= policy.highTrustThreshold:
    return ACCESS_GRANTED
  else if trustScore >= policy.mediumTrustThreshold:
    return ACCESS_LIMITED
  else:
    // Trigger MFA or deny access
    if MFA_required():
      requestMFA()
      return ACCESS_PENDING
    else:
      return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**Innovation Focus:** The key differentiation is the continuous, dynamic trust assessment *beyond* initial authentication. Existing systems typically rely on static credentials or one-time MFA. This system adapts to changing device behavior, providing a more resilient and granular security posture. It moves beyond 'who you are' to 'how you're behaving'.
