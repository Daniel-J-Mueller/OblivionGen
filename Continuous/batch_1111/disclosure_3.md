## Adaptive Timer Granularity Scaling

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the precision (granularity) of the virtual timer based on system load and task sensitivity. The patent describes injecting noise *into* the timer value; this design focuses on altering the fundamental *resolution* of the timer itself, rather than just offsetting it.

**Rationale:**  Different tasks have different tolerances for timing inaccuracies.  High-priority, real-time tasks require fine-grained timing, while background or less critical tasks can tolerate coarser timing.  A fixed-granularity timer represents a compromise, wasting resources on tasks that don't need precision and potentially hindering performance for those that do. This adaptive system could enhance overall system responsiveness and efficiency.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing hardware timer (PLL-based, as described in the patent) and processing cores.  No additional hardware required.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Timer Granularity Manager (TGM):** Responsible for monitoring system load and application priority.
    *   **Adaptive Timer Module (ATM):**  Intercepts timer requests, modifies timer resolution, and provides the virtual timer value.
    *   **Application Priority Database:** Stores priority levels for running applications.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
ATM.initialize(HardwareTimer, ApplicationPriorityDatabase)

// Timer Request Interception
function handleTimerRequest(taskID, requestedTime) {
  priority = ApplicationPriorityDatabase.getPriority(taskID)
  load = SystemLoadMonitor.getCurrentLoad()

  granularity = calculateGranularity(priority, load)

  adjustedTime = scaleTime(requestedTime, granularity)
  virtualTime = HardwareTimer.read() + adjustedTime

  return virtualTime
}

function calculateGranularity(priority, load) {
  // Define granularity levels (e.g., nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds)
  levels = [NANOSECONDS, MICROSECONDS, MILLISECONDS]

  // Calculate an index based on priority and load.
  // Higher priority and lower load -> finer granularity (lower index).
  index = (priority * (1 - load)) // scaled between 0-1
  index = Math.floor(index * levels.length) // index is 0, 1, or 2.

  return levels[index];
}

function scaleTime(requestedTime, granularity) {
  // Adjust the requested time based on the current granularity.
  // Essentially, round the requested time to the nearest multiple of the granularity.
  // This will "coarsen" the timer resolution for lower-priority tasks.
  return Math.round(requestedTime / granularity) * granularity;
}
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Granularity Levels:**  The granularity levels must be carefully chosen to balance precision and performance.
*   **Priority Assignment:**  A robust mechanism for assigning priorities to applications is critical.
*   **Synchronization:**  Care must be taken to avoid synchronization issues when dealing with different granularity levels.
*   **Overhead:** The overhead of calculating and adjusting granularity levels must be minimized.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Per-Thread Granularity:**  Adjust granularity on a per-thread basis, allowing fine-grained control over timing within a single application.
*   **Predictive Granularity:**  Use machine learning to predict future system load and proactively adjust granularity levels.
*   **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:** Automatically adjust application priorities based on resource usage and responsiveness.
