## Dynamic Harmonic Injection for Rack-Level Power Optimization

**Concept:** Instead of broadly altering frequency/voltage to reduce power draw, this system focuses on *injecting* specific harmonic frequencies into the power delivered to individual devices or groups of devices *within* a rack. These harmonics can be tuned to exploit the non-linear impedance characteristics of power supplies, creating targeted reductions in power consumption without impacting core functionality. It’s about ‘shape’ rather than simply ‘amount’ of power.

**Specs:**

*   **Harmonic Injection Unit (HIU):** A small, rack-mountable module positioned *between* the PDU and individual servers/devices (or groups via splitters). HIUs will support multiple injection frequencies simultaneously.
*   **Impedance Profiling:** Each HIU has a built-in current/voltage measurement system, and an automated 'learning' algorithm. When a new device is connected, the HIU will run a short "impedance sweep" - varying harmonic injection frequencies and measuring resulting current draw - to build a localized impedance profile of the connected device’s power supply.
*   **Centralized Control System (CCS):** The CCS monitors overall rack power consumption, and individual device/group profiles, as well as environmental factors (temperature, cooling capacity). It uses these inputs to determine optimal harmonic injection strategies.
*   **Harmonic Library:** The CCS maintains a library of pre-defined harmonic profiles for common server/device types. These profiles can be used as starting points for optimization, or as fallbacks in case of impedance profile corruption.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:** The CCS continuously adjusts harmonic injection frequencies and amplitudes based on real-time power demand and system conditions. 
*   **Safety Limits:**  Injection levels will be strictly limited to prevent damage to devices or instability. A ‘safe mode’ will revert to standard power delivery if anomalies are detected.

**Pseudocode (CCS - Harmonic Optimization Loop):**

```
loop:
    RackPower = MeasureRackPower()
    if RackPower > TargetPower:
        for Device in RackDevices:
            DeviceProfile = GetDeviceProfile(Device)
            OptimalHarmonics = CalculateOptimalHarmonics(DeviceProfile, CurrentRackLoad, CoolingCapacity)
            SendHarmonicControlSignal(Device, OptimalHarmonics)
    else:
        // Revert to standard power delivery for devices 
        for Device in RackDevices:
            SendHarmonicControlSignal(Device, [0,0,0,0]) // Clear harmonic injection
    sleep(100ms)
```

**Hardware Components:**

*   **HIU:**  Digital Signal Processor (DSP), harmonic synthesis circuitry (based on switched capacitor or delta-sigma modulation), current/voltage sensors, communication interface (e.g. I2C, SPI, Ethernet).
*   **CCS:**  Server-class computer with a high-bandwidth network interface, real-time operating system, and database for storing impedance profiles and optimization data.
*   **Communication Network:**  Redundant Ethernet network connecting all HIUs to the CCS.



**Novelty:** This isn’t about broad-stroke power reduction. It's about *precision shaping* of the power delivered, exploiting the non-linear behavior of individual power supplies *within* the rack.  Focus is moved from voltage/frequency alterations to harmonic manipulations, potentially enabling more granular and efficient power management. This also has potential for creating 'signature' harmonic profiles for device identification and security.
