## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Key Fob

**Concept:** A key fob incorporating localized haptic feedback triggered by user proximity to a vehicle or smart lock, and customizable through a companion app.  Beyond simple confirmation, the haptic patterns will *evolve* based on learned user behavior and environmental factors.

**Specifications:**

*   **Form Factor:**  Similar dimensions to standard key fobs (approximately 40mm x 60mm x 10mm).  Housing material: Recycled aluminum alloy with a soft-touch, bio-based polymer overmold.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Array of 9 miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) embedded within the fob’s surface.  Each LRA independently controllable.  Actuator spacing: 8mm center-to-center.
*   **Proximity Sensing:** Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio module for accurate distance measurement (within 10cm).  Range: 1-15 meters.  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for app connectivity and fallback proximity detection.
*   **Microcontroller:**  ARM Cortex-M7 processor with integrated security features (TrustZone).  RAM: 256KB. Flash: 1MB.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable solid-state battery (capacity: 150mAh). Wireless charging (Qi standard). Estimated battery life: 3 months (typical use).
*   **Companion App (iOS/Android):** Allows users to:
    *   Customize haptic patterns for various events (unlock, lock, approaching vehicle, low battery).
    *   Adjust haptic intensity.
    *   Create custom 'moods' – pre-configured haptic profiles.
    *   View battery status.
    *   Update firmware.

**Haptic Pattern Logic:**

1.  **Proximity-Based Triggering:**
    *   **Vehicle Approach (10-5m):**  Gentle, pulsing wave pattern originating from the top of the fob, increasing in frequency as the vehicle is approached.
    *   **Vehicle Approach (5-1m):**  More defined, directional wave pattern simulating the direction of the vehicle (determined by UWB angle).
    *   **Unlock Confirmation:**  Distinct, sharp pulse across the entire actuator array.
    *   **Lock Confirmation:**  Slow, descending scale of haptic pulses.
    *   **Smart Lock Approach (3-1m):**  Series of short, staccato pulses simulating the ‘clicking’ sound of a lock.

2.  **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   The system will *learn* user behavior patterns over time (e.g., typical approach speed to the vehicle).
    *   Based on learned behavior, the haptic feedback will be adjusted to provide *anticipatory* cues.  For example, if the user consistently approaches the vehicle at a specific speed, the haptic feedback will begin slightly earlier to coincide with their anticipated arrival.
    *   A 'comfort mode' allows the user to disable adaptive learning if desired.

3.  **Environmental Awareness:**
    *   The fob will integrate with the vehicle’s or smart lock’s environmental sensors (e.g., temperature, weather).
    *   The haptic feedback will be subtly adjusted to reflect the environment.  For example:
        *   **Cold Weather:**  Haptic pulses will be slightly slower and more deliberate.
        *   **Warm Weather:**  Haptic pulses will be faster and more energetic.
        *   **Rain:**  A light, rippling pattern will be added to the haptic feedback to simulate raindrops.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```
function generate_haptic_pattern(event, distance, angle, temperature, is_raining):
  pattern = []

  if event == "approach":
    if distance > 5:
      pattern = pulsing_wave(frequency = distance_to_frequency(distance))
    else:
      pattern = directional_wave(angle, frequency = distance_to_frequency(distance))

  elif event == "unlock":
    pattern = sharp_pulse()

  elif event == "lock":
    pattern = descending_scale()

  # Modify pattern based on environment
  if temperature < 10:  # Celsius
    slow_down_pattern(pattern, factor = 0.7)
  if is_raining:
    add_ripple_effect(pattern, intensity = 0.3)

  return pattern
```

**Materials:**

*   Housing: Recycled Aluminum Alloy (6061) with Bio-Based Polymer Overmold (PLA/PHA blend).
*   Circuit Board:  Flexible PCB with ROHS compliant components.
*   Battery: Solid-State Lithium-Ion Polymer.

**Future Enhancements:**

*   Integration with vehicle/smart home automation systems.
*   Advanced gesture recognition.
*   Biometric authentication (fingerprint/voice).
*   Customizable actuator array layout.
