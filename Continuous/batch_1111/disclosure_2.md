## Dynamic Feature Flag Injection for A/B Testing & Canary Deployments

**Specification:** A system to dynamically inject feature flags *directly into* compiled software binaries post-compilation, enabling real-time A/B testing and canary deployments without requiring re-compilation or server-side configuration changes. This differs from typical feature flag implementations which rely on configuration files or remote feature toggles.

**Core Concept:** Leverage a binary instrumentation technique to identify feature flag access points within the compiled code. Replace those access points with a runtime resolver that fetches flag state from a secure, local cache.

**Components:**

1.  **Instrumentation Engine:** A tool that analyzes compiled binaries (e.g., ELF, PE) to identify calls/accesses related to specific feature flags. This engine utilizes pattern matching and symbolic execution.  Flags are designated during compilation via special pragmas or attributes.

2.  **Resolver Library:** A small, platform-specific library linked into the application at runtime. This library handles the fetching of flag states from the local cache and provides the actual boolean value to the application.

3.  **Local Flag Cache:**  A secure, encrypted store (e.g., a dedicated section in the binary itself, or a separate file) containing the current state of all feature flags. The cache is populated via a separate deployment process *before* the application is launched. The cache uses a rolling cryptographic signature to prevent tampering.

4.  **Deployment Pipeline Integration:** Automated tooling to update the local flag cache with new flag states as part of the deployment process. This pipeline is responsible for generating the cache, signing it, and deploying it to the target environment.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Compilation:**  Software is compiled with special pragmas or attributes to identify feature flags and access points within the code.
2.  **Instrumentation:** The instrumentation engine analyzes the compiled binary and replaces feature flag access points with calls to the resolver library.
3.  **Deployment:** The deployment pipeline updates the local flag cache with the desired flag states.
4.  **Runtime:** The application launches and the resolver library fetches flag states from the local cache, providing real-time A/B testing and canary deployment capabilities.

**Pseudocode (Resolver Library):**

```cpp
bool GetFeatureFlag(const std::string& flagName) {
  // Check if flag exists in local cache.
  auto it = localCache.find(flagName);
  if (it != localCache.end()) {
    // Verify signature of cache entry
    if (VerifySignature(it->second.signature, it->second.data)) {
      return it->second.value;
    } else {
      // Log error and return default value (e.g., false)
      LogError("Invalid signature for flag: " + flagName);
      return false;
    }
  } else {
    // Log error and return default value.
    LogError("Flag not found: " + flagName);
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Zero Downtime Deployments:**  Feature flags can be toggled without requiring application restarts or redeployments.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Enables precise control over feature visibility and behavior.
*   **Reduced Complexity:** Eliminates the need for complex server-side feature flag management systems.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Secure local cache prevents unauthorized modification of flag states.
*   **Real-Time Testing:**  Facilitates real-time A/B testing and canary deployments.
