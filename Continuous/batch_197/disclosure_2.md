## Dynamic Tenant Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the trusted identity concept to create dynamically shifting "tenant personas" which influence resource allocation and access control beyond simple authorization. This moves beyond static access policies to reactive, behavior-based security.

**Specs:**

**1. Persona Definition Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time telemetry data from the tenant’s container (CPU usage, memory access patterns, network I/O, API call frequency, data modification rates).
*   **Processing:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., anomaly detection, clustering) to categorize tenant behavior into predefined personas (e.g., "Heavy Reader," "Data Miner," "Spike Load User," "Idle").  The model is continuously retrained with observed data. Persona assignment happens at sub-second intervals.
*   **Output:**  A dynamically updated "persona tag" associated with the tenant.

**2. Policy Orchestration Engine:**

*   **Input:** Tenant persona tag, existing access control policies, resource availability data (host, container, VM).
*   **Processing:**  Translate the persona tag into dynamic resource allocation adjustments and access control modifications. Policies are defined with persona-specific rules (e.g., “If persona = Heavy Reader, increase read IOPs by 20%,” “If persona = Data Miner, limit outbound data transfer to 1GB/hour”).
*   **Output:**  Real-time adjustments to container resource limits (CPU, memory, I/O), network bandwidth, and access control lists.

**3. Trust Score Integration:**

*   **Input:** Tenant persona, historical behavior data, observed deviation from expected behavior, data sensitivity levels.
*   **Processing:** Calculate a dynamic "trust score" for each tenant based on its current persona, historical behavior patterns, and sensitivity of data accessed. This trust score is used to influence access control decisions (e.g., higher trust = less stringent checks).
*   **Output:**  A trust score used as an input to the Policy Orchestration Engine to further refine resource allocation and access control.

**4. Shadow Container Mode:**

*   **Function:** When a new or unknown tenant connects, its activities are initially confined to a “shadow container” – a lightweight replica of the production container.
*   **Telemetry:** All actions within the shadow container are monitored and used to build a behavioral profile.
*   **Transition:**  After a predefined period or upon reaching a certain confidence level, the tenant is migrated to the production container with a dynamically assigned persona.

**Pseudocode (Policy Orchestration Engine):**

```
function applyPolicy(tenantId, persona, resourceRequest, accessPolicy):
  resourceLimit = accessPolicy.defaultLimit
  accessGranted = accessPolicy.defaultAccess

  if persona == "HeavyReader":
    resourceLimit.readIOPS += 20%
    accessGranted = true

  if persona == "DataMiner":
    resourceLimit.dataTransferLimit = 1GB/hour
    accessGranted = accessPolicy.dataMinerAccess // potentially more restrictive

  if persona == "SpikeLoadUser":
    resourceLimit.cpuLimit += 50% // temporary boost
    accessGranted = true

  if trustScore < threshold:
    accessGranted = false // Deny access regardless of persona

  return (resourceLimit, accessGranted)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Persona Sharing:** Allow tenants with similar personas to share resources.
*   **Proactive Security:** Use persona predictions to identify potential security threats before they occur.
*   **Automated Remediation:** Automatically adjust resource allocation or access control based on observed tenant behavior.
