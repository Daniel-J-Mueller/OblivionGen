## Collaborative Gift Creation & 'Wish-Weaving'

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *fulfilling* wishes to *co-creating* gifts with the recipient and participants, layering desires and skills into unique, personalized outcomes. This moves beyond a financial contribution toward a shared creative experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Skill/Resource Profile Integration:**

*   **Data Input:** Allow users to tag themselves with 'skills' (e.g., 'watercolor painting', 'woodworking', 'songwriting', 'coding') and 'resources' (e.g., 'access to 3D printer', 'fabric scraps', 'vintage record collection').  These are appended to existing social profiles.
*   **Skill/Resource Matching:**  Algorithm that identifies potential combinations of skills/resources within the gift campaign network (initiator, participants, recipient).
*   **Skill/Resource 'Bounties':**  Initiator can specify *needed* skills/resources for the gift creation. Participants can 'claim' these bounties, committing their abilities to the project.

**2. 'Wish-Weaving' Interface:**

*   **Dynamic Wishboard:** A shared, visual interface where the recipient can express wishes not as concrete "I want X" statements, but as abstract concepts, feelings, or experiences (e.g., “I want to feel cozy,” “I want to remember my grandmother,” “I want to explore a hidden world”).
*   **Concept-to-Contribution Mapping:** Participants propose contributions that map to these abstract wishes.  For example:
    *   Wish: "I want to feel cozy."
    *   Contributions: "I can knit a scarf," "I can write a poem about winter," "I can create a custom tea blend."
*   **Contribution Voting/Refinement:**  Participants and the recipient vote on proposed contributions.  The system then facilitates collaborative refinement of the chosen contributions – a shared document editor for poems, a design tool for visual art, etc.

**3. Hybrid Fulfillment Model:**

*   **Physical/Digital Blend:**  The final gift can be a combination of physical and digital elements – a handcrafted item accompanied by a custom song, a digitally-designed art piece printed on canvas, etc.
*   **Micro-Task Integration:**  If a complex gift requires multiple steps, the system breaks it down into smaller, manageable tasks that different participants can complete. (e.g., One person designs the logo, another builds the website, another writes the copy).
*   **'Legacy' Component:** Incorporate a mechanism for the gift to evolve over time.  For example, a collaborative story that participants continue to add to, or a digital artwork that changes based on real-world data.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Contribution Mapping):**

```
function mapContributions(recipientWish, participantSkills) {
  // 1. Analyze recipientWish for keywords and emotional tone.
  keywords = analyzeWish(recipientWish);

  // 2. Filter participantSkills based on keyword relevance.
  relevantSkills = filterSkills(participantSkills, keywords);

  // 3.  Present relevantSkills to participant for contribution proposal.
  //     Participant selects skill and describes contribution.

  // 4.  Contribution is displayed to recipient for voting.

  // 5.  If approved, contribution is added to gift project.
}
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   Integration with existing social networking APIs.
*   Development of a robust skill/resource tagging system.
*   Creation of collaborative editing tools.
*   Secure payment processing for material costs.
*   Scalability to handle large gift campaigns.
