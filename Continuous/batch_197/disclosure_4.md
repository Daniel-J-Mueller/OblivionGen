## Dynamic Skill Orchestration & Predictive Access

**Concept:** Extend the secure exchange framework to proactively anticipate user needs & orchestrate skill enablement/disablement *before* a device request, leveraging predictive analytics & contextual awareness.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Data Aggregation Module:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   User Account Data (preferences, demographics, usage history).
    *   Device Data (type, capabilities, location, network status).
    *   Environmental Data (time of day, calendar events, weather).
    *   IoT Sensor Data (smart home devices – lighting, temperature, occupancy).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Real-time data ingestion & normalization.
    *   Machine learning models (trained on user behavior) predict potential device interactions.
    *   Contextual scoring – assigns a probability score to each potential interaction.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Predicted device interactions with associated probability scores.
    *   Contextual data package for the Skill Orchestration Engine.

**2. Skill Orchestration Engine:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   Contextual data package.
    *   Skill dependency graph (defines relationships between skills & devices).
    *   Skill enablement status (current state of each skill for the user).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Analyzes predicted interactions & identifies required skills.
    *   Determines if necessary skills are enabled.
    *   Proactively requests skill enablement/disablement (using existing secure exchange framework).
    *   Prioritizes requests based on probability score & user preferences.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Skill enablement/disablement requests (with secure token data).
    *   Real-time skill status updates.

**3. Predictive Access Control Layer:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   Device request (for account information/access).
    *   Current skill status (from Skill Orchestration Engine).
    *   Contextual data (from Contextual Data Aggregation Module).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Verifies device request against predicted interactions & skill status.
    *   Dynamically adjusts access control policies based on context.
    *   If a request falls outside of predicted interactions, triggers additional security checks.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Access granted/denied signal.
    *   Security audit log.

**Pseudocode (Skill Orchestration Engine):**

```
FUNCTION OrchestrateSkills(contextData):
  predictedInteractions = AnalyzeContext(contextData)
  requiredSkills = ExtractSkills(predictedInteractions)

  FOR skill IN requiredSkills:
    IF SkillIsEnabled(skill) == FALSE:
      RequestSkillEnablement(skill)  // Secure exchange protocol from patent
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  RETURN skillStatus //Real time skill enablement status
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive skill enablement to a proactive, predictive model, anticipating user needs and dynamically adjusting access control based on context. Improves user experience and enhances security by preventing unauthorized access.
