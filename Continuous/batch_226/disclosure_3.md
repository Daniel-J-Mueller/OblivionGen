## Dynamic Memory Region Swapping & Tiering

**Concept:** Extend shared memory capabilities by allowing dynamic swapping of physical memory regions assigned to shared virtual address spaces, coupled with a tiered memory system (e.g., DRAM, NVMe). This enables scaling shared memory beyond physical RAM limits and optimizes performance based on access patterns.

**Specifications:**

*   **Memory Tier Definition:** Define multiple memory tiers with varying speed/cost characteristics (DRAM, NVMe SSD, Optane). Each tier is addressable and manageable by the Memory Management Unit (MMU).
*   **Shared Region Granularity:** Shared memory regions are divided into granular "pages" or "blocks" (e.g., 4KB, 8KB).  Metadata is associated with each block, indicating its current tier and access statistics.
*   **Access Pattern Monitoring:** The MMU continuously monitors access patterns for each shared memory block (frequency of access, read/write ratio, temporal locality). This data is fed into a prediction algorithm.
*   **Tier Prediction Algorithm:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) predicts optimal tier placement based on access patterns.  The model is trained offline and updated periodically.
*   **Dynamic Swapping Mechanism:** A dedicated process or MMU function performs asynchronous swapping of shared memory blocks between tiers.
    *   Blocks with high access frequency remain in faster tiers (DRAM).
    *   Infrequently accessed blocks are migrated to slower tiers (NVMe/Optane).
    *   Swapping is transparent to user processes.
*   **Coherency Protocol:** A modified cache coherency protocol ensures data consistency across tiers. Writes to slower tiers are either:
    *   Write-back with delayed propagation to faster tiers.
    *   Write-through to both tiers.
*   **Virtual Address Space Management:** Extend the page table to include tier information for each shared memory block.
*   **API Extensions:** Provide API calls for applications to hint at memory access patterns or request specific tier placement (optional).

**Pseudocode (MMU Swap Function):**

```
function swap_memory_block(block_address, target_tier):
  current_tier = get_block_tier(block_address)

  if current_tier == target_tier:
    return // No swap needed

  // 1. Pause access to the block (if necessary, using a semaphore)
  acquire_lock(block_address)

  // 2. Copy data from current tier to target tier
  copy_data(block_address, current_tier, block_address, target_tier)

  // 3. Update page table entry with new tier information
  update_page_table(block_address, target_tier)

  // 4. Invalidate cache lines in the current tier
  invalidate_cache(block_address, current_tier)

  // 5. Release access to the block
  release_lock(block_address)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-bandwidth interconnect between DRAM, NVMe, and the MMU.
*   Hardware support for memory tiering and swapping in the MMU.
*   Fast and efficient DMA engine for data transfer.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Scalable shared memory beyond physical RAM limits.
*   Improved performance by placing frequently accessed data in faster tiers.
*   Reduced memory costs by using slower tiers for infrequently accessed data.
*   Increased system throughput and responsiveness.
