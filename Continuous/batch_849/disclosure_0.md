## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Dynamic Microphone Arrays

**Concept:** Extend microphone failure detection and adaptation beyond simple switching between pre-defined microphone groups. Instead, create a system that dynamically reconfigures a virtual microphone array *in software*, leveraging the signals from all functioning microphones to reconstruct an acoustic scene.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Minimum of 4 microphones.  The system scales with more microphones, up to a practical limit determined by processing power.
*   High-precision ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) for each microphone channel. Minimum 24-bit resolution.
*   Processing unit capable of real-time FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and beamforming calculations. A dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) is recommended.
*   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer and gyroscope – to compensate for device movement and provide spatial orientation data.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Microphone Health Monitor:** Continuously monitors the signal from each microphone based on energy levels, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and spectral characteristics.  Uses the logic similar to the provided patent for failure detection, but with finer granularity.  Instead of simply flagging a microphone as 'failed', it assigns a 'health score' (0-100) to each microphone.
*   **Virtual Array Builder:** The core of the system. This module dynamically constructs a virtual microphone array in software. The virtual array's geometry (number of elements, spacing, orientation) is determined by the health scores of the physical microphones.
    *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  **Weighted Averaging:**  Each functioning microphone's signal is weighted according to its health score. Lower health scores result in lower weights.
        2.  **Spatial Positioning:**  Assigns a virtual position to each weighted microphone signal.  This is where the innovation lies:
            *   **Healthy Microphones:**  Retain their physical positions in the virtual array.
            *   **Degraded Microphones:**  Their virtual positions are shifted slightly to emphasize directional signals and minimize noise. The amount of shift is proportional to the health score. Think of 'smearing' the microphone signal in a direction that maximizes constructive interference for expected sound sources.
            *   **Failed Microphones:** Their positions are removed, and the remaining microphones' positions are adjusted to maintain a relatively uniform distribution. Interpolation techniques can fill gaps.
        3.  **Beamforming:** Standard beamforming algorithms (Delay-and-Sum, MVDR, etc.) are applied to the virtual array to focus on target sound sources. The beamforming weights are adjusted based on the virtual array geometry.
*   **Acoustic Scene Reconstructor:** Processes the beamformed signals to create a 3D map of the acoustic environment.
    *   **Techniques:** Room Impulse Response (RIR) estimation, Sound Field Analysis,  Source Localization.
    *   **Output:** 3D point cloud representing the sound sources and reflecting surfaces in the environment.
*   **Dynamic Configuration Manager:**  Continuously adjusts the virtual array geometry and beamforming weights based on real-time acoustic conditions and microphone health scores.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:** Uses adaptive filtering techniques to compensate for reverberation, noise, and other distortions.
    *   **Optimization Algorithm:** Employs an optimization algorithm (e.g., genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization) to fine-tune the virtual array parameters for optimal performance.

**3.  Data Flow:**

1.  Microphone signals are captured by the ADC.
2.  The Microphone Health Monitor analyzes the signals and assigns health scores.
3.  The Virtual Array Builder constructs the virtual array based on the health scores.
4.  The Acoustic Scene Reconstructor processes the beamformed signals to create a 3D map.
5.  The Dynamic Configuration Manager continuously adjusts the virtual array parameters for optimal performance.

**4.  Pseudocode (Virtual Array Builder - Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION buildVirtualArray(microphoneData, healthScores):
  virtualArray = []
  FOR each microphone IN microphoneData:
    healthScore = healthScores[microphone.id]
    IF healthScore > threshold:
      virtualPosition = microphone.physicalPosition  // Healthy microphone
    ELSE:
      // Calculate shifted position based on health score
      shiftDirection = expectedSoundSourceDirection // or noise direction
      shiftMagnitude = (1 - healthScore/100) * maxShiftDistance
      virtualPosition = microphone.physicalPosition + shiftDirection * shiftMagnitude
    virtualArray.append(virtualPosition)
  RETURN virtualArray
```

**Innovation:** The dynamic reconstruction of a virtual microphone array allows the system to adapt to microphone failures in a much more sophisticated way than simply switching between pre-defined configurations. This results in improved performance, especially in challenging acoustic environments.  It goes beyond failure detection; it's about *rebuilding* the sensing capability.
