## Temporal Content Coherence Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the object detection/classification pipeline to not just identify objectionable content *within* a single frame, but to assess the *temporal coherence* of that content across multiple frames, flagging instances where content appears/disappears rapidly or inconsistently – indicative of deepfakes or manipulated media.

**Specifications:**

1.  **3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN):**  Replace the standard 2D image classification with a 3D CNN. This network takes a short clip of video frames (e.g., 16 or 32 frames) as input, enabling it to learn spatiotemporal features. The 3D CNN's output is a “Temporal Coherence Score” (TCS) for each detected object/content label.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_TCS(video_clip, object_detection_results, content_labels):
      # video_clip is a sequence of frames
      # object_detection_results: bounding boxes, confidence scores
      # content_labels: identified content types (e.g., violence, nudity)

      # 1. Extract features using a pre-trained 3D CNN (e.g., I3D)
      features = 3D_CNN(video_clip)

      # 2.  For each detected object/content label:
      for label in content_labels:
          # 3. Extract spatiotemporal features associated with the label.
          label_features = extract_features_for_label(features, label)

          # 4. Calculate temporal coherence:  Measure the smoothness of the label’s presence
          #    over time (e.g., standard deviation of confidence scores over frames).
          temporal_coherence = calculate_smoothness(label_features)

          # 5. TCS = Confidence Score * Temporal Coherence. Lower TCS indicates potential manipulation
          TCS = confidence_score(label) * temporal_coherence

          # Store TCS for the label.
          store_TCS(label, TCS)

      return TCS_data
    ```

2.  **Frame Interpolation Augmentation:** During training, augment the dataset with synthetically generated frames between existing frames using frame interpolation techniques (e.g., DAIN, RIFE). This will force the network to become more robust to subtle temporal inconsistencies.

3.  **Anomaly Detection Module:** Integrate an anomaly detection module that analyzes the distribution of TCS scores across all detected objects and content labels.  Low TCS scores that fall outside the expected distribution are flagged as potential anomalies. Use a one-class SVM or similar technique.

4.  **Confidence Threshold Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the confidence threshold for objectionable content based on the TCS.  If the TCS is low, even a high confidence score for objectionable content might trigger a flag, indicating possible manipulation.

5.  **Multi-Stream Processing:** Implement multiple streams of 3D CNNs, each trained on different types of temporal augmentations (e.g., slow motion, speed up, jitter).  Combine the outputs of these streams using a weighted averaging scheme to improve robustness.

6.  **Metadata Integration:** Integrate metadata from the video file (e.g., creation date, editing history) to provide additional context for the TCS. Suspicious editing patterns or inconsistencies in metadata could further reinforce the detection of manipulated media.

**Output:**

*   TCS for each detected object/content label.
*   Anomaly score indicating the overall likelihood of temporal manipulation.
*   Visual highlighting of frames with low TCS scores.
*   Flag indicating potential deepfake or manipulated media.
