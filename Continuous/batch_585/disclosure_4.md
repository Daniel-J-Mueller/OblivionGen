**Dynamic Item Re-Orientation System with Predictive Trajectory Adjustment**

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the orthogonal conveyor concept by introducing a multi-axis robotic arm integrated *above* the output conveyor. The arm doesn't simply *receive* singulated items; it dynamically re-orients them *in-flight* based on pre-calculated trajectories and sensor data, allowing for complex downstream process requirements. 

**Core Components:**

*   **Enhanced Vision System:**  High-speed 3D scanning of items on the input conveyor, capturing not only position but also shape, weight estimation, and material properties.
*   **Predictive Trajectory Engine:**  Software that calculates optimal re-orientation paths for each item *before* it reaches the output conveyor. This considers downstream process requirements (e.g., specific face up, precise alignment) and avoids collisions.  Utilizes a physics engine to model item behavior.
*   **Multi-Axis Robotic Arm:**  A lightweight, high-speed robotic arm with at least 7 degrees of freedom, positioned directly above the output conveyor. Equipped with a customizable end effector (vacuum grip, specialized tooling).
*   **Adaptive Output Conveyor:** The output conveyor is segmented into individually controlled sections, capable of minor adjustments in speed and direction to synchronize with the robotic arm.
*   **Sensor Fusion Suite:** Combines data from the vision system, robotic arm encoders, and output conveyor sensors for real-time control and error correction.

**Operational Sequence (Pseudocode):**

```
LOOP:
    ITEM_DATA = vision_system.scan_input_conveyor()
    IF ITEM_DATA:
        ITEM_TRAJECTORY = trajectory_engine.calculate_path(ITEM_DATA, downstream_requirements)
        robot_arm.prepare_for_item(ITEM_TRAJECTORY)
        output_conveyor.adjust_speed(ITEM_DATA.speed)
        robot_arm.intercept_item(ITEM_DATA)
        robot_arm.reorient_item(ITEM_DATA, ITEM_TRAJECTORY)
        robot_arm.place_item(downstream_process)
    ENDIF
ENDLOOP
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Throughput:**  Target 200+ items/minute (scalable with robotic arm quantity)
*   **Re-orientation Range:**  +/- 180 degrees on all axes
*   **Precision:**  +/- 0.5 mm, +/- 0.1 degrees
*   **Item Size:**  Adaptable via software configuration (range: 50mm - 500mm)
*   **Item Weight:**  Up to 5kg (end effector customizable)
*   **Software Interface:**  GUI for defining downstream requirements, calibration, and monitoring. API for integration with other factory systems.
*   **Safety:**  Light curtains and emergency stop buttons. Software-based collision avoidance.

**Novelty:**

Existing singulation systems primarily focus on separating and presenting items. This system proactively *manipulates* items in flight, allowing for a much wider range of downstream processes and eliminating the need for manual re-orientation or complex fixturing. The predictive trajectory calculation and sensor fusion contribute to high speed and accuracy.
