## Dynamic Reconfigurable Interconnect Mesh

**Concept:** Expand the reconfigurable logic platform to include a fully dynamic, software-defined interconnect mesh *within* the reconfigurable regions, enabling arbitrary dataflow topologies at runtime.  This transcends simply allocating bandwidth *to* regions; it allows regions to *build* their internal communication fabrics.

**Specs:**

*   **Interconnect Element (IE):**  Each reconfigurable region is composed of an array of Interconnect Elements. Each IE is a configurable logic block (similar to FPGA LUTs/registers) capable of:
    *   Routing data to any adjacent IE (North, South, East, West, Up, Down – 3D arrangement possible).
    *   Performing basic data manipulation (bit shifting, addition, comparison).
    *   Implementing simple state machines for flow control.
    *   Supporting multiple data widths (8, 16, 32, 64 bits).
*   **Configuration Memory:** Each IE has local configuration memory to store its routing and data manipulation settings.
*   **Control Plane:** The host logic’s control plane (accessed via the host interface) provides a high-level API to configure the interconnect mesh. This API defines “flows” – sequences of IEs and their configurations – for data transmission.
*   **Flow Compiler:** Software running on the host processor compiles high-level flow descriptions into a bitstream that configures the IEs. This compiler optimizes flow configurations based on latency, bandwidth, and power consumption.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** The interconnect mesh supports *runtime* reconfiguration.  Flows can be updated or created on-the-fly without interrupting other flows.  This allows the platform to adapt to changing application needs.
*   **Dataflow Programming Model:**  Applications are programmed using a dataflow model. The application defines the data processing steps and the connections between them. The platform automatically maps the dataflow graph onto the interconnect mesh.

**Pseudocode (Flow Compilation):**

```
function compileFlow(flowDescription):
  // flowDescription is a graph of data processing nodes and connections
  
  // 1. Topological Sort: Determine the order in which nodes should be processed.

  // 2. Node Placement: Assign each node to an Interconnect Element.
  //    - Consider resource availability, latency constraints, and data dependencies.
  
  // 3. Routing:  Determine the path for data to travel between nodes.
  //    - Use a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*) to find the shortest path.
  //    - Avoid congested links.
  
  // 4. IE Configuration:  Generate a bitstream for each IE, specifying:
  //    - Input and output connections.
  //    - Data manipulation functions.
  //    - Control signals.
  
  // 5. Bitstream Transmission: Transmit the bitstreams to the IEs.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **High-Performance Image/Video Processing:** Implement complex processing pipelines with low latency.
*   **Network Packet Processing:**  Build custom packet filters and routers.
*   **Machine Learning Inference:** Accelerate neural network computations.
*   **Custom Hardware Accelerators:** Implement application-specific logic.
