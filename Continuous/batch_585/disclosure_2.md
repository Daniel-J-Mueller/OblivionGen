## Modular, Bio-Integrated Media Extender

**Concept:** Extend the functionality of the media extender beyond simple signal/power pass-through to include localized environmental sensing and micro-actuation, creating a “smart” node within a larger system. This moves beyond passive extension and introduces limited environmental control/awareness.

**Core Innovation:** Integrate biocompatible hydrogels and microfluidic channels *within* the extender housing. These channels would facilitate the circulation of a sensing/actuation fluid.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing Material:** Primarily injection-molded ABS plastic, with designated cavities for hydrogel/microfluidic integration. Must allow for optical transparency in specific regions.
*   **Hydrogel Composition:** Polyethylene glycol (PEG) based hydrogel, tailored for biocompatibility and low friction.  Concentration: 5-10% w/v PEG in buffered saline.
*   **Microfluidic Channels:** Laser-etched microchannels (width: 50-200μm, depth: 20-50μm) embedded within the hydrogel matrix. Channel layout: A radial network extending from a central reservoir. Total channel length: 5-10cm.
*   **Sensing Suite:** Integrated micro-sensors within the hydrogel/channel network:
    *   Temperature sensor (thermistor, range 20-40°C, accuracy ±0.1°C)
    *   Humidity sensor (capacitive type, range 30-90% RH, accuracy ±2% RH)
    *   Optical sensor (photodiode, measures light intensity/color, range 0-1000 lux)
*   **Actuation System:** Micro-heater integrated near the central reservoir. Power: 5-10mW, controllable via PWM signal. Function:  Controlled temperature variation of the fluid.
*   **Fluid Composition:** Aqueous solution containing nanoparticles for enhanced thermal conductivity and/or optical properties. (e.g. Gold nanoparticles - 10-20nm diameter, concentration 10-50 ppm)
*   **Communication:** Standard USB-C interface for both power/data.  Data transmission protocol: I2C, transmitting sensor data and receiving actuation commands.
*   **Power Requirements:** 5V DC, <500mA.
*   **Physical Dimensions:**  Maintain similar form factor to existing media extender (approx. 5cm x 2cm x 1cm).
