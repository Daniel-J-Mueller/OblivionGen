## Adaptive DNS Reputation Scoring with Client-Side Entropy Analysis

**Concept:** Augment the existing DNS redirection detection with a client-side entropy analysis of DNS responses, coupled with a dynamic reputation scoring system for DNS servers. This goes beyond simple mismatch detection to assess the *quality* and trustworthiness of DNS responses themselves.

**Specification:**

**I. Client-Side Agent (Integrated into Browser/OS):**

*   **DNS Interception:** Intercept all DNS responses destined for the client. (Can be optional, user configurable.)
*   **Entropy Calculation:** For each DNS response (specifically the 'answers' section):
    *   Calculate Shannon entropy of the IP address octets. Higher entropy suggests more randomness, potentially indicative of a compromised or malicious DNS server.
    *   Calculate entropy of the domain name length. Abnormally long or short domain names could indicate DNS tunneling or malicious redirection.
    *   Calculate entropy of the TTL (Time to Live) value.  Unexpectedly high or low TTL values might signal manipulation.
*   **Feature Vector Creation:** Combine entropy scores (IP, domain length, TTL) into a single feature vector representing the “quality” of the DNS response.
*   **Local Reputation Cache:** Maintain a small, local cache of DNS server reputations based on observed feature vectors.  Initially neutral, reputations adjust based on the received quality scores.
*   **Reporting:** Transmit feature vectors and associated DNS server IP addresses (anonymized if necessary) to a central aggregation server.  *Do not* transmit any personally identifiable information.

**II. Central Aggregation Server:**

*   **Global Reputation Database:** Maintain a global database of DNS server reputations.
*   **Reputation Scoring:**
    *   Receive feature vectors from client agents.
    *   Calculate a weighted average of feature vector components to determine a DNS server’s reputation score. (Weights are adjustable based on observed trends and threat intelligence.)
    *   Apply decay to reputation scores over time (to account for servers correcting malicious behavior).
    *   Implement a system for flagging and blacklisting persistently malicious servers.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) to dynamically adjust the weights assigned to each feature vector component. This allows the system to adapt to evolving threats and improve accuracy.
*   **Thresholding and Alerting:** Define thresholds for reputation scores. When a DNS server’s score falls below a threshold, trigger an alert and potentially block resolutions from that server.

**III. Integration with Existing System:**

*   The entropy analysis and reputation scoring system acts *in addition* to the existing mismatch detection mechanism.
*   If a DNS mismatch is detected *and* the DNS server has a low reputation score, the confidence in a malicious redirection is significantly increased.
*   A high reputation score can *mitigate* a mismatch detection in cases where a legitimate DNS server is experiencing transient issues or is misconfigured.



**Pseudocode (Client-Side Agent):**

```
on DNS_RESPONSE_RECEIVED(response):
  ip_entropy = calculate_shannon_entropy(response.answers[0].ip_address)
  domain_entropy = calculate_shannon_entropy(len(response.answers[0].domain_name))
  ttl_entropy = calculate_shannon_entropy(response.answers[0].ttl)

  feature_vector = [ip_entropy, domain_entropy, ttl_entropy]

  # Update local reputation cache
  update_local_reputation(response.server_ip, feature_vector)

  # Anonymize data
  anonymized_data = {
      "server_ip": anonymize_ip(response.server_ip),
      "feature_vector": feature_vector
  }

  # Send to central server (asynchronously)
  send_data_to_server(anonymized_data)

```

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond simple DNS record comparison. It assesses the *quality* of DNS responses themselves using entropy analysis, providing a more nuanced and accurate detection mechanism. The dynamic reputation scoring system allows the system to adapt to evolving threats and reduce false positives. The client-side component facilitates faster response times and reduces the load on central servers.
