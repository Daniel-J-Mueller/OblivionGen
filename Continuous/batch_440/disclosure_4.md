## Adaptive Network Topology Prediction & Pre-Provisioning

**Concept:** Extend the multi-path probing concept to *predict* network congestion *before* it impacts performance, then proactively establish optimized paths. This moves beyond reactive path selection to predictive path management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Model Component:**

*   **Data Input:** Real-time data from probing packets (latency, packet loss, jitter), historical network performance data (stored time-series data), external data sources (e.g., internet exchange point (IXP) peering announcements, scheduled maintenance notifications, large event notifications – concerts, sporting events potentially impacting network usage).
*   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict network congestion levels across different network paths. The LSTM is ideal for time-series data analysis and capturing temporal dependencies.
*   **Output:** Predicted congestion level (scale of 0-100) for each available network path over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds).  Also, a confidence interval for the prediction.
*   **Training:** Continuous online learning – the model is continuously retrained with new data to improve its accuracy.  A separate validation dataset is used to prevent overfitting.

**2. Proactive Path Provisioning Component:**

*   **Thresholds:** Define congestion thresholds (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on predicted congestion levels.
*   **Pre-Provisioning Logic:**
    *   When the predicted congestion level for a current path exceeds a defined threshold (e.g. Medium), *before* congestion actually impacts performance, the system initiates the establishment of a new UDP flow (or activates a pre-established standby flow) along an alternative path.
    *   The selection of the alternative path is based on the predicted congestion level for other available paths – prioritizing paths with the lowest predicted congestion.
    *   A ‘warm-up’ phase for the new path – sending low-bandwidth test traffic to ensure the path is stable before fully transitioning data traffic.
*   **Flow Switching:** Implement a seamless flow switching mechanism – gradually shifting traffic from the congested path to the newly established path. Utilize techniques like Weighted Round Robin or Least Loaded, adapting to real-time path performance.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Distributed Agents:** Deploy lightweight agents on both the client and server devices. These agents are responsible for:
    *   Sending probing packets.
    *   Receiving probing responses.
    *   Communicating with the central Predictive Model Component.
    *   Managing UDP flows.
*   **Central Predictive Model Component:**  A centralized server (or a distributed cluster) hosting the RNN model. Responsible for:
    *   Receiving data from distributed agents.
    *   Running the RNN model.
    *   Generating congestion predictions.
    *   Sending path recommendations to distributed agents.
*   **Data Storage:**  Store historical network performance data in a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB).

**4. Pseudocode (Client Agent):**

```
function main():
    initialize UDP flows (multiple paths)
    while true:
        send probing packets to each path
        receive responses
        send data to Predictive Model Component
        receive predicted congestion levels
        if predicted congestion for current path > threshold:
            activate/establish alternative path
            begin traffic migration
        transmit data via selected path
        repeat
```

**5. Enhanced Probing Packet Format:**

*   Include a timestamp for accurate latency measurement.
*   Add a unique packet identifier for tracking.
*   Include client/server identifiers.
*   Include data flags (e.g., flow type, priority).

**6.  Failover & Resilience:**

*   Continuously monitor the health of all established paths.
*   Implement automatic failover mechanisms to switch to alternative paths in case of path failures.
*   Utilize redundant Predictive Model Components to ensure high availability.
