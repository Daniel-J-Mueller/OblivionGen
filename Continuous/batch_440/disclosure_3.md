## Adaptive Policy Synthesis via Generative Request Mutation

**Concept:** Extend the policy validation system to not just *validate* existing policies, but to *generate* policy recommendations and refined policies by intelligently mutating request contexts and observing the resulting access decisions. This moves beyond edge-case identification to *proactive* policy improvement.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** `PolicySynthesisEngine`
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `BasePolicy`: The current security policy being analyzed (from existing system).
    *   `InitialRequestSet`: An initial set of request contexts (could be the existing 'edge cases', or a smaller representative sample).
    *   `MutationParameters`: Configuration dict controlling the mutation process (mutation rate, mutation types, allowed parameter ranges, objective function weighting).
    *   `ObjectiveFunction`: A function defining the desired policy characteristics (e.g., maximize allowed legitimate requests, minimize false positives, balance security and usability).
*   **Outputs:**
    *   `RecommendedPolicy`: A modified security policy based on the mutation results.
    *   `MutationLog`: Detailed record of all mutations performed, access decisions observed, and the resulting impact on the objective function.
*   **Core Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function synthesizePolicy(BasePolicy, InitialRequestSet, MutationParameters, ObjectiveFunction):
    RequestSet = InitialRequestSet
    MutationLog = []

    for iteration in range(MutationParameters.maxIterations):
        BestMutation = None
        BestScore = -Infinity

        for request in RequestSet:
            # 1. Mutate Request Context
            mutatedRequest = mutateRequestContext(request, MutationParameters)

            # 2. Evaluate Access Decision
            accessDecision = evaluateAccess(mutatedRequest, BasePolicy)

            # 3. Calculate Score
            score = ObjectiveFunction(mutatedRequest, accessDecision)

            # 4. Track & Select Best Mutation
            if score > BestScore:
                BestScore = score
                BestMutation = mutatedRequest

        # 5. Apply Best Mutation (Policy Adjustment) - may involve adding a new rule/constraint
        BasePolicy = applyMutationToPolicy(BasePolicy, BestMutation)

        # 6. Add BestMutation to RequestSet - exploration.  Consider weighted sampling of existing requests too.
        RequestSet.append(BestMutation)

        # 7. Log Mutation Details
        MutationLog.append({
            "originalRequest": request,
            "mutatedRequest": BestMutation,
            "accessDecision": accessDecision,
            "score": BestScore
        })

    return BasePolicy, MutationLog
```

*   **`mutateRequestContext(request, MutationParameters)`:** This function introduces controlled randomness. Mutation types:
    *   **Parameter Perturbation:**  Slightly modify numerical parameter values within defined ranges.
    *   **Parameter Substitution:** Replace parameter values with others from a predefined set (e.g., different user roles, resource types).
    *   **Parameter Addition/Removal:** (Carefully) Add or remove parameters from the request context (requires policy to handle missing parameters gracefully).
    *   **Context Combination:** Combine aspects of two or more existing request contexts.

*   **`evaluateAccess(request, policy)`:**  Utilizes the existing policy evaluation engine.

*   **`applyMutationToPolicy(policy, mutatedRequest)`:**  This is the core intelligence. Analyze the `mutatedRequest` and how the policy responded.  Based on the response:
    *   If access was wrongly denied: Add a new rule/constraint to the policy to allow this request.
    *   If access was wrongly granted:  Strengthen existing constraints to prevent this request.
    *   Utilize symbolic reasoning/SMT solvers to determine the *minimal* change to the policy that achieves the desired outcome. This avoids over-permissive policies.

*   **Objective Function:**  Highly configurable. Examples:
    *   Maximize the number of *legitimate* requests that are granted.
    *   Minimize the number of *false positives* (access granted to unauthorized requests).
    *   Balance security and usability.
    *   Prioritize critical requests over less important ones.

*   **Data Store:** Store historical mutation logs and policy versions. This allows for tracking policy evolution and identifying regressions.



This system aims to go beyond passive validation, actively refining policies to be more robust, user-friendly, and aligned with evolving security needs.  The iterative mutation process, guided by the objective function, should lead to policies that are demonstrably more effective than those created manually.
