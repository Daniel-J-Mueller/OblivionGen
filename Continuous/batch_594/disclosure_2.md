## Adaptive Doorbell System with Predictive Chime & Environmental Awareness

**System Overview:** A doorbell system incorporating localized environmental sensors, machine learning for chime prediction, and dynamic chime customization based on user presence and environmental factors.

**Core Components:**

*   **Doorbell Button Unit:** Standard mechanical button + integrated microphone, low-resolution camera (IR capable), and local processing unit (ESP32 class).
*   **Central Hub:**  Raspberry Pi/similar acting as the central processing and communication unit, interfacing with the doorbell button, chime units, and external services.
*   **Chime Units:** Wireless (WiFi/Bluetooth mesh) chime speakers distributed throughout the home.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Integrated into the doorbell button unit – light sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, vibration sensor (detects package drops).
*   **User Presence Detection:**  Integration with existing smart home systems (if available) or BLE beacon-based tracking of user locations within the home.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Predictive Chime:** The system learns user routines (e.g., time of day, typical visitor patterns) and *predicts* potential doorbell rings.  A low-volume “pre-chime” alerts occupants *before* the visitor arrives, providing time to prepare (answer the door, view camera feed, etc.).
2.  **Dynamic Chime Customization:**  Based on user location and environmental conditions:
    *   **Location-Aware Chimes:** If a user is detected in the home office, a different chime is triggered than if they are in the kitchen.  Prioritized chimes could also be set, so different users get different chimes.
    *   **Environmental Chimes:**
        *   **Low Light/Night:**  A brighter, more distinct chime, coupled with activation of nearby smart lights.
        *   **Rain/Snow:** A gentler, more subtle chime to avoid startling occupants.
        *   **Package Detection:** A unique chime sequence when the vibration sensor detects a package drop. This chime could trigger a camera recording.
3.  **Smart Home Integration:** Seamless integration with other smart home systems (voice assistants, security cameras, smart lighting). 
4.  **Remote Configuration:** User-friendly mobile app for configuring chimes, adjusting sensitivity of sensors, and managing user profiles.

**Pseudocode – Chime Selection Logic:**

```pseudocode
function selectChime(userLocation, environmentalConditions):
  // User Location: "home office", "kitchen", "living room", "away"
  // Environmental Conditions: "day", "night", "rain", "snow", "package"

  if userLocation == "away":
    return defaultChime // Basic notification sound
  
  if environmentalConditions == "package":
    return packageChime // Unique chime for package delivery

  if environmentalConditions == "night":
    chimeOptions = [brightChime1, brightChime2]
  else:
    chimeOptions = [gentleChime1, gentleChime2]
  
  if userLocation == "home office":
    selectedChime = chimeOptions[0]
  elif userLocation == "kitchen":
    selectedChime = chimeOptions[1]
  else:
    selectedChime = random.choice(chimeOptions)

  return selectedChime
```

**Hardware Specifications (Doorbell Button Unit):**

*   Microcontroller: ESP32-S3
*   Microphone: MEMS digital microphone
*   Camera: 2MP, 720p IR Camera Module
*   Environmental Sensors: BH1750 (light), DHT22 (temperature/humidity), SW420 (vibration)

**Future Expansion:**

*   Facial Recognition: Identify visitors and announce their name via chime.
*   Two-Way Audio:  Allow occupants to communicate with visitors remotely.
*   Integration with Delivery Services:  Receive notifications about package tracking and estimated delivery times.
