## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** A system that doesn't just *level* audio, but *re-composes* the acoustic scene based on identified elements and user preference, creating a synthesized audio experience tailored to the environment and content. It expands beyond gain curves to actively manipulate the perceived sonic space.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-channel audio (minimum stereo), environmental microphone array data.
*   **Processing Units:**
    *   **Source Separation:**  Algorithm to isolate individual sound sources (music, speech, ambience, sound effects) within the input audio stream.  Utilize a combination of deep learning models (e.g., Open-Unmix, Demucs) and traditional signal processing techniques.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Analysis:**  Algorithm to identify the environmental acoustic scene (e.g., home, office, street, concert hall) based on microphone array data. Employ machine learning models trained on large datasets of environmental audio recordings. Features extracted: Reverberation time, noise floor, dominant frequencies, spatial characteristics.
    *   **Semantic Tagging:**  Assign semantic tags to separated sound sources (e.g., "female speech", "acoustic guitar", "car horn", "rain"). Utilize pre-trained audio classification models and fine-tune them with custom datasets.
    *   **User Preference Profile:** Store user-defined preferences for different sound source types and acoustic scenes.  Preferences include: desired prominence, equalization settings, spatialization characteristics, noise reduction levels. This profile is dynamically adjustable.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Synthesis Engine:** The core of the system. Combines separated sound sources, user preferences, and identified acoustic scene to synthesize a new audio stream. Functions:
        *   **Dynamic Spatialization:**  Re-position sound sources within the virtual sonic space to create a more realistic or stylized experience. Utilize Ambisonics or Vector Base Amplitude Panning (VBAP) techniques.
        *   **Reverberation Mapping:** Apply different reverberation characteristics to individual sound sources based on the identified acoustic scene and user preferences.  Implement convolution reverb with impulse responses tailored to specific environments.
        *   **Frequency Shifting & EQ:** Dynamically adjust the frequency content of individual sound sources to improve clarity, reduce masking, or create special effects.
        *   **Dynamic Noise Cancellation:** Implement adaptive noise cancellation algorithms tailored to the identified environmental noise profile.  Not just cancellation, but re-purposing environmental sound as ambience.
        *   **Source Blending:** Smoothly blend the processed sound sources together to create a coherent and natural audio experience.
*   **Output:** Multi-channel audio stream.

**Pseudocode (Acoustic Scene Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesize(separatedSources, userPreferences, acousticScene, environmentalNoise) {
  for each source in separatedSources {
    // Apply user preference EQ and gain
    source = applyEQ(source, userPreferences.EQ[source.tag]);
    source = applyGain(source, userPreferences.gain[source.tag]);

    // Calculate spatial position based on source tag and acoustic scene
    position = calculateSpatialPosition(source.tag, acousticScene);

    // Apply spatialization algorithm (VBAP, Ambisonics)
    spatializedSource = applySpatialization(source, position);

    // Apply reverberation based on acoustic scene and source tag
    reverberatedSource = applyReverberation(spatializedSource, acousticScene, source.tag);

    // Dynamic Noise Cancellation/Re-purposing
    if (source.tag == "ambient") {
        processedSource = rePurposeAmbientSound(source, environmentalNoise);
    } else {
        processedSource = applyNoiseCancellation(reverberatedSource, environmentalNoise);
    }

    outputStream.add(processedSource);
  }

  return outputStream;
}
```

**Novelty:** This isn't about simple leveling or gain control. It's about *actively re-composing* the audio, creating a tailored acoustic scene. The user isn't just adjusting volume, they are designing the sonic environment. The re-purposing of ambient sound is also unique - taking unwanted noise and turning it into part of the synthesized experience.  The dynamic mapping of reverberation characteristics to *both* acoustic scene *and* source type provides a level of granularity not found in existing systems.
