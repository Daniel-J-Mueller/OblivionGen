## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Projection

**Concept:** Augment the AEC system with the ability to not only *cancel* echoes, but to actively reconstruct and project a ‘clean’ acoustic scene, effectively creating a localized, synthesized sound environment independent of the physical space. This moves beyond noise *reduction* towards deliberate sonic environment *creation*.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Integrate a multi-microphone array (minimum 8 mics, optimally 16+) with spatial audio capture capabilities. This is beyond simple echo cancellation; we need 3D audio data.
*   **Acoustic Scene Database:** Develop a database of pre-recorded acoustic environments (e.g., “busy cafe,” “forest,” “conference room,” "cathedral”). Each entry will be a multi-channel impulse response (MIR) representing the acoustic characteristics of the space.
*   **Real-Time Spatial Analysis:** Implement a module that continuously analyzes the captured microphone data to estimate the geometry of the room, identify sound sources, and determine the dominant reflections and reverberation characteristics. This module relies on techniques like Time-Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and beamforming.
*   **DNN-Based Scene Matching & Blending:**  A DNN will be trained to match the *current* estimated acoustic scene (from the spatial analysis) to the closest entry in the acoustic scene database. It won’t be a perfect match – the DNN must also learn to blend multiple entries to synthesize a novel scene. The DNN outputs mixing coefficients for each scene component.
*   **Adaptive Projection Matrix:** The DNN generates an "adaptive projection matrix." This matrix controls how the synthesized scene is 'projected' into the audio output. It accounts for the listener’s position (estimated using head tracking or microphone array data) and the desired perceptual effect.
*   **Hybrid Signal Processing:**  Combine the output of the AEC system (to suppress unwanted echoes) with the synthesized acoustic scene. This is achieved by convolving the synthesized scene with the adaptive projection matrix and adding it to the original audio signal (after echo cancellation).
*   **Perceptual Tuning:** Implement a module allowing the user to adjust the ‘intensity’ and ‘realism’ of the synthesized scene. This will involve parameters like reverb level, spatial diffusion, and ambient sound volume.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Input: Microphone data (multi-channel), Playback audio data
// Output: Synthesized audio data

// 1. Echo Cancellation (Existing AEC)
echo_cancelled_audio = AEC(microphone_data, playback_data);

// 2. Spatial Analysis
room_geometry, sound_sources = AnalyzeSpace(microphone_data);

// 3. Scene Matching
best_scene, blending_coefficients = MatchScene(room_geometry, sound_sources, acoustic_scene_database);

// 4. Projection Matrix Generation
projection_matrix = GenerateProjectionMatrix(best_scene, blending_coefficients, listener_position);

// 5. Scene Synthesis
synthesized_scene = SynthesizeScene(best_scene, projection_matrix);

// 6. Final Output
final_audio = synthesized_scene + echo_cancelled_audio;

// Output: final_audio
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Telepresence:** Create a realistic sense of shared space during remote meetings.
*   **Personalized Sound Environments:** Allow users to create their ideal acoustic environment, regardless of their physical location.
*   **Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality:** Enhance the realism of VR/AR experiences by simulating accurate acoustic environments.
*   **Assistive Listening Devices:**  Improve speech intelligibility and reduce background noise for individuals with hearing impairments.
