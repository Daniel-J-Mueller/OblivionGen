## Adaptive Rule Weighting via Bayesian Optimization

**Concept:** The patent describes seeding rule-based machine learning with prior rules and random rules, then refining with genetic algorithms. This inspires a system that *dynamically* weights rules, not just through GA-style fitness, but through Bayesian Optimization informed by real-time performance metrics.  Instead of evolving rules, we’re evolving the *importance* of existing rules.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Rule Repository:** A database storing all generated rules (from prior ML operations *and* randomly generated). Each rule is associated with a weight value (initialized to 1.0).

2.  **Performance Metric Layer:** A module capturing key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the specific relationship being detected (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, processing time). These KPIs are calculated on a rolling window of incoming data.  Crucially, this layer *also* captures *cost* associated with false positives and false negatives. (e.g., cost of incorrectly identifying duplicates vs. missing duplicates).

3.  **Bayesian Optimization Engine:**  This is the core. It utilizes a Gaussian Process to model the relationship between rule weights and the performance metrics (weighted by the cost factors).
    *   **Parameter Space:**  Each rule’s weight is a parameter in the optimization.  Constraints can be added (e.g., minimum weight = 0, maximum weight = 5).
    *   **Acquisition Function:**  Utilize an Expected Improvement (EI) or Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function to select the next set of rule weights to evaluate.
    *   **Evaluation:** The selected rule weights are applied to the rule repository.  The performance metrics are calculated on a validation dataset, and the resulting score is fed back to the Gaussian Process.
    *   **Iteration:** The process repeats, refining the Gaussian Process and identifying increasingly optimal rule weights.

4.  **Rule Application Layer:**  Applies the weighted rules to incoming data.  The weighted score is calculated based on the sum of the weights of the rules that fire for a given data pair.  A threshold is applied to determine if the data pair has the specified relationship.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
rule_repository = load_rules() // Load rules from database
rule_weights = initialize_weights(rule_repository) // Set initial weight = 1.0 for each rule
gaussian_process = initialize_gaussian_process()

// Main Loop
while True:
    // 1. Data Collection & Evaluation
    data_batch = get_data_batch()
    performance_metrics = evaluate_rules(data_batch, rule_weights)

    // 2. Bayesian Optimization
    next_weights = suggest_weights(gaussian_process, performance_metrics)

    // 3. Update Gaussian Process
    gaussian_process = update_gaussian_process(gaussian_process, next_weights, performance_metrics)

    // 4. Apply Weights and Evaluate
    apply_weights(rule_weights, next_weights)
    // (The apply_weights can also be a soft update, or weighted average to mitigate sudden changes.)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static or GA-evolved rule weights. By utilizing Bayesian Optimization, it *continuously* adapts to changing data distributions and cost considerations. This allows the system to optimize not just for accuracy, but also for minimizing the cost associated with errors. The continuous adaptation differentiates it from approaches that rely on periodic retraining or genetic algorithms.  It also facilitates "explainability" through the observed weight changes of individual rules.
