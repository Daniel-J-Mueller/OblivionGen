**Employee Skill-Graph Propagation & Predictive Reskilling Ledger**

**Concept:** Extend the blockchain-secured ledger system to not just track *state* changes of employees (cost center, employment status) but to build and propagate a dynamic, verifiable skill-graph. This allows for predictive reskilling and internal mobility, leveraging blockchain for trust and auditability of skill endorsements.

**Specification:**

*   **Skill Object Definition:** Define a “Skill” object within the ledger. Attributes: Skill Name (string), Skill Level (integer 1-5), Endorser (employee ID), Endorsement Date (timestamp), Verification Status (boolean – verified by HR/training dept.).
*   **Skill Graph Construction:** Each employee object will have an associated array/linked list of Skill objects, representing their documented skills.  New skills are added via transactions.
*   **Endorsement Mechanism:**  Employees can “endorse” skills of other employees (similar to LinkedIn).  This creates a transaction adding the endorsement to the skill object. Endorsements require a small 'gas' fee (cryptocurrency) to prevent spam.
*   **Skill Verification & Trust Score:** HR/Training departments can verify skills, adding a "Verified" flag. The system calculates a "Trust Score" for each skill based on the number of endorsements, verifications, and the endorser/verifier's internal "reputation score" (tracked on-chain).
*   **Predictive Reskilling Algorithm:** A machine learning model (running off-chain but informed by the on-chain data) analyzes:
    *   Current skill graph of all employees.
    *   Projected skill needs based on company strategy (input by management – also ledger-recorded).
    *   Individual employee skill gaps.
*   **Reskilling Transaction:** When an employee completes a training program, a transaction is created on the ledger updating their Skill object and reflecting the new/improved skill level.
*   **Internal Mobility Market:**  Create an internal “job market” where project managers can search for employees with specific skill sets (querying the on-chain skill graph).
*   **Automated Incentive/Reward System:** Link successful skill endorsements/verifications/completion of reskilling to cryptocurrency rewards (incentivizing participation).

**Pseudocode (Skill Endorsement Transaction):**

```
Transaction SkillEndorsement(EmployeeID_Endorser, EmployeeID_Endorsee, SkillName, EndorsementDate) {
    // Verify Endorser and Endorsee exist in the system
    IF (EmployeeExists(EmployeeID_Endorser) AND EmployeeExists(EmployeeID_Endorsee)) {
        // Check if Skill already exists for Endorsee
        SkillObject skill = GetSkill(EmployeeID_Endorsee, SkillName);
        IF (skill == NULL) {
            //Create new Skill object
            skill = CreateSkill(EmployeeID_Endorsee, SkillName);
        }
        //Add endorsement to Skill object.
        AddEndorsement(skill, EmployeeID_Endorser, EndorsementDate);

        //Update Skill Trust Score (off-chain calculation informed by on-chain data)
        UpdateTrustScore(skill);

        //Record transaction on blockchain
        RecordTransaction(TransactionID, EmployeeID_Endorser, EmployeeID_Endorsee, SkillName, EndorsementDate);
        Return TransactionSuccess
    } ELSE {
        Return TransactionFailure
    }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Employee Object:** (Existing) + SkillID Array/List
*   **Skill Object:** SkillName (string), SkillLevel (int), EndorserID (int array), EndorsementDate (timestamp array), VerificationStatus (boolean), TrustScore (float)
*   **Transaction Object:** TransactionID, EmployeeID_Actor, ActionType, Timestamp, Data (specific to action)
