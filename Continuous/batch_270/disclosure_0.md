## Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' for Predictive Congestion Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the network planning system to actively create and evaluate 'shadow' network plans in near real-time, predicting congestion *before* it occurs and proactively re-routing traffic based on these simulations. This goes beyond simply optimizing a single plan; it anticipates changes and maintains optimized alternatives ready for deployment.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Plan Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Live network telemetry (bandwidth utilization, latency, error rates, etc.), forecasted traffic demands (based on historical data, event schedules, etc.), and current network plan.
    *   Process:
        1.  Periodically (e.g., every 5-15 seconds) create *N* (configurable, default = 5) ‘shadow’ network plans. Each shadow plan represents a potential future network state.
        2.  Introduce simulated ‘stressors’ into each shadow plan. These stressors mimic anticipated events (concerts, major news releases, sporting events) or potential failures (link outages, equipment degradation). Stressors are parameterized and configurable.
        3.  Utilize the existing optimization model to re-allocate network resources within each shadow plan, aiming to minimize cost while meeting demand *under the simulated stress*.
        4.  Each shadow plan generates a 'congestion score' – a metric representing the predicted level of network congestion under the simulated stress.  This score incorporates metrics like packet loss, latency, and utilization.
*   **Proactive Re-Routing Engine:**
    *   Input: Congestion scores for all shadow plans, current network plan performance, configurable sensitivity thresholds.
    *   Process:
        1.  Monitor the congestion scores of all shadow plans in parallel.
        2.  If the congestion score of *any* shadow plan exceeds a pre-defined threshold *and* the current network plan's performance is degrading (based on real-time telemetry), trigger a re-routing operation.
        3.  The re-routing engine selects the shadow plan with the *lowest* congestion score that still meets demand requirements.
        4.  Deploy the selected shadow plan as the new active network plan. This deployment happens in a phased manner to minimize disruption.
*   **Cost/Benefit Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Costs associated with re-routing (signaling overhead, potential dropped connections), benefits associated with avoiding congestion (improved user experience, increased throughput).
    *   Process: Continuously monitor the cost/benefit ratio of proactive re-routing. Adjust sensitivity thresholds and re-routing frequency to optimize this ratio.
*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The Shadowing module operates as an extension of the existing network planning system. It utilizes the same optimization model and interfaces with the existing network configuration and telemetry systems.
*   **Pseudocode (Proactive Re-Routing Engine):**

```
function ProactiveReRoute() {
  shadowPlans = GetShadowPlans();
  currentPerformance = GetCurrentNetworkPerformance();

  for each plan in shadowPlans {
    if (plan.congestionScore > sensitivityThreshold AND currentPerformance.degrading) {
      bestPlan = plan; //Initial candidate
      break;
    }
  }
  if (bestPlan != NULL) {
    DeployNetworkPlan(bestPlan);
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This expands the network planning system from a *static* optimization tool to a *dynamic*, *predictive* one. Existing systems typically react to congestion; this proactively anticipates and avoids it. It introduces the concept of 'shadow' plans and a continuous cost/benefit analysis to optimize proactive re-routing.
