## Dynamic Topology Sharding & Federated Querying

**Concept:** Extend the closure table & metagraph system to support a distributed, sharded topology across multiple independent services. Each service maintains a partial topology (shard) and associated closure table. Federated queries can then span these shards, leveraging the metagraph to ensure consistency and validity across the distributed system.

**Specs:**

**1. Shard Definition & Metadata:**

*   **Shard ID:** Unique identifier for each topology shard.
*   **Shard Owner:** Service responsible for managing the shard.
*   **Metagraph Subset:** Each shard maintains a localized version of the metagraph, defining valid relationships *within* the shard.  A “Global Metagraph” (maintained separately, possibly via a consensus mechanism) defines relationships *across* shards.
*   **Node Ownership:**  Nodes can be explicitly owned by a specific shard.  Nodes may also be "shared" (replicated) across multiple shards for faster access.  Ownership information is stored alongside node metadata.

**2. Closure Table Partitioning & Replication:**

*   **Shard-Local Closure Table:**  Each shard maintains a closure table representing direct and transitive connections *within* its owned nodes.
*   **Boundary Nodes:** Nodes that have connections to nodes owned by *other* shards are designated as "Boundary Nodes."
*   **Boundary Node Replication:** Boundary Node closure table entries are replicated to the owning shards of their connected nodes. This enables fast traversal across shard boundaries *without* requiring full inter-shard communication for every hop.  Replication is asynchronous and uses a conflict resolution strategy (e.g., last-write-wins, versioning).

**3. Federated Querying Protocol:**

*   **Query Decomposition:** Incoming queries are decomposed into sub-queries targeted at specific shards based on the nodes involved.
*   **Shard Routing:**  A "Topology Router" service (or integrated into the querying client) determines which shards need to be involved in the query based on node ownership and the query’s starting/ending nodes.
*   **Sub-Query Execution:** Each shard executes its sub-query against its local closure table.
*   **Result Aggregation:** Results from each shard are aggregated. This aggregation utilizes the Global Metagraph to ensure that any cross-shard connections represented in the results are valid. Invalid connections are flagged or filtered.
*   **Optimization:**  Queries are optimized to minimize inter-shard communication.  The Topology Router can leverage knowledge of the Global Metagraph and the data distribution to reorder query execution or push down filtering operations to the individual shards.

**4. Metagraph Synchronization & Governance:**

*   **Global Metagraph Authority:**  A designated service (or distributed consensus mechanism) is responsible for maintaining the Global Metagraph.
*   **Metagraph Updates:** Updates to the Global Metagraph require authorization and are propagated to all shards.
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Mechanisms are in place to resolve conflicts between local metagraphs and the Global Metagraph.
*   **Versioning:**  Metagraph versions are maintained to allow for rollback in case of errors.

**Pseudocode (Federated Query):**

```
function federatedQuery(query, startNode, endNode):
  router = TopologyRouter()
  shards = router.determineShards(startNode, endNode)

  subQueries = []
  for shard in shards:
    subQuery = createSubQuery(query, shard)
    subQueries.append(subQuery)

  results = executeSubQueries(subQueries)

  aggregatedResults = aggregateResults(results)

  validatedResults = validateResults(aggregatedResults, GlobalMetagraph)

  return validatedResults
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Scalability:**  Distribute the topology across multiple services to handle larger and more complex topologies.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  If one shard fails, the rest of the topology remains operational.
*   **Reduced Latency:**  Localize data access within shards.
*   **Data Sovereignty:**  Enforce data governance and compliance requirements by isolating data within specific shards.
