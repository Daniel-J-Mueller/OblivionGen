## Dynamic Quorum Adjustment Based on Network Latency & Node Resource Utilization

**Specification:** System Enhancement – Distributed Consensus & Replication

**Core Concept:**  The current patent focuses on *placement* of nodes for replication. This design expands on that by dynamically adjusting the quorum size required for consensus *based on real-time network conditions and node resource load*.  The goal is to maintain availability and consistency *without* sacrificing performance when network conditions degrade or nodes become overloaded.

**Components:**

*   **Latency & Load Monitoring Agent:**  A lightweight agent on each node continuously monitors:
    *   Round-trip time (RTT) to other nodes in the replication group.
    *   CPU utilization, memory pressure, and disk I/O.
*   **Quorum Adjustment Controller:** A central (or distributed consensus-based) controller that receives data from the monitoring agents. It calculates an adjusted quorum size based on a defined algorithm.
*   **Consensus Protocol Adapter:** A module within the existing consensus protocol implementation (e.g., Raft, Paxos) that accepts a dynamic quorum size parameter.

**Algorithm (Quorum Adjustment Controller):**

1.  **Baseline Quorum:** Define a baseline quorum size (e.g., majority of nodes).
2.  **Latency Penalty:**  Calculate a latency penalty factor for each node based on its RTT to other nodes.  Higher RTT = Higher Penalty.
3.  **Load Penalty:** Calculate a load penalty factor for each node based on its resource utilization. Higher Utilization = Higher Penalty.
4.  **Effective Node Count:** Calculate an effective node count for each node by subtracting the combined latency and load penalty from 1 (1 – (Latency Penalty + Load Penalty)).  Values below 0 are set to 0.
5.  **Adjusted Quorum Calculation:**  The adjusted quorum size is calculated as: `FLOOR(Baseline Quorum * (SUM of Effective Node Counts / Total Number of Nodes))`. This ensures the quorum adjusts proportionally to the overall health of the cluster.
6.  **Minimum Quorum Threshold:** A minimum quorum size is enforced to prevent overly aggressive reductions that compromise data durability.

**Pseudocode (Quorum Adjustment Controller):**

```
// Inputs:
//   baselineQuorum: Initial quorum size
//   nodes: List of nodes with latency & load data
//   minQuorum: Minimum acceptable quorum size

function adjustQuorum(nodes, baselineQuorum, minQuorum):
  totalEffectiveCount = 0
  for each node in nodes:
    latencyPenalty = calculateLatencyPenalty(node)  // Returns a value between 0 and 1
    loadPenalty = calculateLoadPenalty(node)      // Returns a value between 0 and 1
    effectiveCount = 1 - (latencyPenalty + loadPenalty)
    effectiveCount = MAX(0, effectiveCount) //Ensure it doesn't go negative.
    totalEffectiveCount += effectiveCount

  adjustedQuorum = FLOOR(baselineQuorum * (totalEffectiveCount / length(nodes)))
  adjustedQuorum = MAX(adjustedQuorum, minQuorum)
  return adjustedQuorum
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The `calculateLatencyPenalty` and `calculateLoadPenalty` functions should be tuned based on performance testing and cluster characteristics.  Exponential or sigmoid functions could be used to amplify penalties for severely degraded nodes.
*   The adjusted quorum size should be communicated to the consensus protocol adapter via a configuration update or API call.
*   A mechanism for detecting and mitigating “split-brain” scenarios (where multiple quorums form) should be implemented. This could involve fencing or leader election.
*   The system should be designed to be fault-tolerant. The Quorum Adjustment Controller should be replicated, and the monitoring agents should be resilient to failures.
