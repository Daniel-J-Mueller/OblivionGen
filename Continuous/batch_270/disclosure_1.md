**Adaptive Pre-Emphasis Based on Real-Time Channel Estimation**

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This system aims to dynamically optimize optical power offsets *not* at the transceiver level, but *downstream* at a dedicated optical channel estimation and pre-emphasis module *before* the local optical amplifier. This moves the optimization point away from individual transceivers and focuses on compensating for accumulated channel impairments.

**II. Hardware Components:**

1.  **Optical Taps:** Implement a series of low-loss optical taps after the wavelength division multiplexer, strategically placed along the fiber path (e.g., after splices, connectors, long spans). These taps direct a small percentage of the optical signal to the Channel Estimation Module.
2.  **Channel Estimation Module:** A compact optical receiver and high-speed digitizer. This module analyzes the tapped signals to build a real-time channel profile â€“ including losses, chromatic dispersion, and polarization mode dispersion (PMD). It utilizes algorithms like Least Squares or Recursive Least Squares to track changes in the channel profile.
3.  **Digital Signal Processor (DSP):** A high-performance DSP processes the channel profile data.
4.  **Programmable Optical Attenuators/Phase Shifters:** A series of high-speed, programmable optical attenuators and phase shifters are inserted *before* the local optical amplifier. These are controlled by the DSP.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** A closed-loop feedback system continuously monitors signal quality (e.g., Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio - OSNR, Bit Error Rate - BER) at the output of the local amplifier using a dedicated monitoring receiver. This data refines the control signals to the programmable attenuators/phase shifters.

**III. Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Channel Estimation Algorithm:** Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm to track channel impulse response. The algorithm estimates the channel's frequency response for each wavelength.
2.  **Pre-Emphasis Calculation:**  Based on the estimated channel frequency response, the DSP calculates the required pre-emphasis profile.  This profile is the inverse of the channel's frequency response, effectively flattening the amplitude and phase spectrum at the input of the local optical amplifier. The DSP incorporates a weighting function to prioritize compensation for specific impairments (e.g., higher weight for impairments that significantly degrade OSNR).
3.  **Attenuator/Phase Shifter Control:** The DSP translates the calculated pre-emphasis profile into control signals for the programmable optical attenuators and phase shifters. The control signals are sent to the hardware, adjusting the optical power and phase of each wavelength.
4.  **Adaptive Learning Rate:** Implement an adaptive learning rate for the RLS algorithm. This allows the system to quickly adapt to sudden changes in the channel while maintaining stability.
5.  **BER/OSNR Feedback:**  The system monitors BER/OSNR and adjusts the pre-emphasis profile to minimize BER/maximize OSNR.  This ensures that the system maintains optimal performance.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize RLS algorithm
RLS_Init()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Acquire optical signals from taps
    optical_signals = AcquireOpticalSignals()

    // Estimate channel impulse response
    channel_impulse_response = RLS_Estimate(optical_signals)

    // Calculate frequency response
    channel_frequency_response = FFT(channel_impulse_response)

    // Calculate pre-emphasis profile (inverse of frequency response)
    pre_emphasis_profile = 1 / channel_frequency_response

    // Calculate attenuator/phase shifter control signals
    control_signals = CalculateControlSignals(pre_emphasis_profile)

    // Apply control signals to attenuators/phase shifters
    ApplyControlSignals(control_signals)

    // Monitor BER/OSNR
    ber_osnr = MonitorBER_OSNR()

    // Adjust pre-emphasis based on BER/OSNR feedback
    AdjustPreEmphasis(ber_osnr)
}
```
