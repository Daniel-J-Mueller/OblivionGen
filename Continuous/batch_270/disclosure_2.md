## Dynamic Cluster Weighting via Biofeedback

**Specification:** A system which incorporates real-time biometric data from the user to dynamically adjust cluster weights within the recommendation engine.

**Core Concept:** The patent describes using cluster ratings as a static input. This builds on that by making cluster influence *reactive* to the user's emotional and cognitive state. The assumption is that implicit biometric signals can indicate momentary preference beyond explicit ratings.

**Components:**

*   **Biometric Sensor Integration:**  Hardware/software interface to capture biometric data. Initial focus: Galvanic Skin Response (GSR – indicating arousal/emotional engagement), Electroencephalography (EEG - particularly alpha/theta band activity indicating relaxed focus or cognitive load), and heart rate variability (HRV).  Future expansion: Eye-tracking, facial expression analysis.
*   **Real-time Signal Processing Module:**  Processes raw biometric data, filters noise, and extracts relevant features. Algorithms:  Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency domain analysis of EEG, statistical feature extraction (mean, standard deviation, peak detection) for GSR/HRV.
*   **State Mapping Function:** A trained machine learning model (e.g., a neural network) that maps biometric feature vectors to user states. States: "Engaged," "Neutral," "Distracted," "Overwhelmed." The training data consists of paired biometric data and explicitly provided user feedback (“I like this,” “I’m bored,” “This is too much”).
*   **Dynamic Cluster Weight Adjustment:** A module that adjusts the weights applied to each cluster in the recommendation engine *based on the current user state*. 

    *   If user state = “Engaged”:  Clusters previously rated highly (and currently showing positive biometric signals when items from those clusters are *displayed*) receive increased weight.
    *   If user state = “Neutral”:  Maintain existing cluster weights, introduce exploration by slightly increasing the weight of under-represented clusters.
    *   If user state = “Distracted”:  Reduce the weight of all clusters, prioritize visually simpler recommendations or offer a "break" option.
    *   If user state = “Overwhelmed”:  Drastically reduce the number of recommendations displayed, prioritize highly-rated clusters with visually calming items.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize cluster ratings and weights (from existing patent functionality)
clusterRatings = [cluster1: 4.5, cluster2: 3.0, ...]
clusterWeights = [cluster1: 1.0, cluster2: 1.0, ...]

// Main Loop:

    // Capture Biometric Data
    biometricData = captureBiometricData()

    // Process Biometric Data & Determine User State
    userState = determineUserState(biometricData)

    // Adjust Cluster Weights based on User State:
    if userState == "Engaged":
        // Increase weights of highly rated clusters showing positive biometric response
        for each cluster in clusterRatings:
            if clusterRating > threshold AND positiveBiometricResponse:
                clusterWeights[cluster] += weightAdjustmentFactor
    elif userState == "Neutral":
        // Introduce exploration
        for each cluster:
            clusterWeights[cluster] += smallWeightAdjustment
    elif userState == "Distracted":
        // Reduce all weights
        for each cluster:
            clusterWeights[cluster] *= reductionFactor
    elif userState == "Overwhelmed":
        // Drastically reduce recommendations & prioritize high-rated clusters
        displayOnlyTopRatedClusters = True

    // Generate Recommendations using adjusted cluster weights
    recommendations = generateRecommendations(clusterWeights)

    // Display recommendations
    displayRecommendations(recommendations)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Wearable biometric sensors (smartwatch, headband) preferred for continuous monitoring.
*   Potential integration with existing VR/AR headsets.

**Future Extensions:**

*   Personalized state mapping functions (train per user).
*   Adaptive learning of weight adjustment factors.
*   Integration with contextual data (time of day, location).
*   Predictive modeling of user state to proactively adjust recommendations.
