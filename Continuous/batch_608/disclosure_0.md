## Dynamic Attestation Chains & Decentralized Secret Distribution

**Concept:** Extend the trust established by the TEE attestation process beyond simple secret retrieval. Implement a system where successful attestation *triggers* a chain of further attestations and secret distributions across a network of HSMs, creating a multi-layered security architecture. This is useful in scenarios needing a high degree of compartmentalization and redundancy.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** 'Attestation Orchestrator' - A software module running within the protected environment (TEE).
*   **HSM Network:** A distributed network of HSMs, each holding a portion of a larger secret or a key needed to unlock a final secret.
*   **Attestation Chain Definition:** A data structure defining the sequence of HSMs to be involved, the type of attestation required at each step, and the specific data or secret to be retrieved.  This definition is stored outside the TEE (e.g., on a configuration server).
*   **Dynamic Chain Generation:** The Orchestrator can dynamically generate attestation chains based on the requesting application’s needs and pre-defined policies.
*   **Multi-Factor Attestation:** Each HSM in the chain can require *multiple* forms of attestation – not just TEE attestation, but also potentially device identity, network location, or time-based validation.

**Workflow:**

1.  Application requests a sensitive operation within the TEE.
2.  TEE Orchestrator retrieves the Attestation Chain Definition from the configuration server.
3.  Orchestrator initiates the chain:
    *   Attests to the first HSM (using standard TEE attestation).
    *   Upon successful attestation, the first HSM releases a 'challenge' or a piece of a larger secret.
4.  The Orchestrator uses the received data to attest to the *next* HSM in the chain. This process repeats.
5.  The final HSM releases the complete secret or unlocks the final secret, allowing the application to complete its operation.
6.  Each HSM involved records the attestation event in a distributed ledger (blockchain-based recommended) for auditability.

**Pseudocode (Orchestrator - simplified):**

```
function executeSensitiveOperation(operationDetails):
    chainDefinition = getConfigServer().getChainDefinition(operationDetails)
    currentHSM = chainDefinition.firstHSM

    while (currentHSM != null):
        attestationResult = attestToHSM(currentHSM)

        if (attestationResult.success):
            challengeData = currentHSM.receiveAttestation(attestationResult)
            if (challengeData != null):
                nextHSM = chainDefinition.getNextHSM(currentHSM)
                currentHSM = nextHSM
            else:
                logError("HSM did not provide challenge data")
                return FAILURE
        else:
            logError("Attestation failed")
            return FAILURE

    finalSecret = unlockFinalSecret(challengeData)
    executeOperationUsingSecret(finalSecret, operationDetails)
    return SUCCESS

function unlockFinalSecret(challengeData):
    //Combine challenge data fragments to unlock secret
    return finalSecret
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   TEE-capable device.
*   Distributed HSM network (communication via TLS/mTLS).
*   Configuration server (stores Attestation Chain Definitions).
*   Distributed ledger (blockchain) for auditing.
*   Secure communication channels between TEE, HSMs, configuration server, and ledger.
