## Dynamic Rule Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:**  Instead of solely relying on a static fitness score derived from precision/recall, introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to *dynamically* adjust the weights assigned to different rule *conditions* within a candidate rule. This allows the system to learn which conditions are most valuable for identifying duplicates in *specific* data subsets, rather than a generalized "best" rule.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Environment:** The RL environment consists of:
    *   **State:** A vector representing the characteristics of the current item description pair being evaluated (e.g., length difference, common token count, character mismatch rate, data source identifier).
    *   **Action:** Modifying the weight assigned to each independent rule condition within the candidate rule. Weights will range from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 signifying maximum importance.
    *   **Reward:**  Based on the accuracy of duplicate detection for *that specific pair* given the weighted rule.  Reward = 1.0 for correct identification (duplicate or not), 0.0 for incorrect.
2.  **RL Agent:** Utilize a Q-learning or Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent. 
    *   **Q-Table/Network:** Maps (State, Action) pairs to Q-values, representing the expected cumulative reward for taking a given action in a given state.
    *   **Exploration/Exploitation:** Employ an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration (trying new weight combinations) and exploitation (using the best-known weights).
3.  **Integration with Genetic Algorithm:**
    *   **Initial Population:** The initial population of candidate rules is generated as before.
    *   **Fitness Evaluation:** For each candidate rule:
        *   Present a representative subset of the reference data set to the RL agent.
        *   The RL agent learns optimal weights for each rule condition based on the data subset.
        *   Apply the rule with the learned weights to the entire reference dataset to determine a fitness score.  The fitness score will be determined by the accuracy rate of duplicate detections.
    *   **Crossover/Mutation:**  Crossover and mutation operations are applied to the *rule structure* (conditions and elements), not the learned weights. The weights are reset for each new generation and relearned by the RL agent.
4.  **Data Subsetting:** Implement a data subsetting strategy to expose the RL agent to a variety of data characteristics. This could involve:
    *   Random Sampling
    *   Stratified Sampling (based on data source, item category, data length, etc.)
    *   Active Learning (selecting data pairs that the agent is most uncertain about).

**Pseudocode (Fitness Evaluation with RL):**

```pseudocode
function evaluate_fitness(candidate_rule, reference_dataset):
    RL_agent = initialize_RL_agent()
    data_subset = select_data_subset(reference_dataset)
    
    for (item1, item2) in data_subset:
        state = extract_features(item1, item2)
        action = RL_agent.choose_action(state) # Returns weights for rule conditions
        weighted_rule = apply_weights(candidate_rule, action)
        prediction = apply_rule(weighted_rule, item1, item2)
        
        if prediction == is_duplicate(item1, item2):
            reward = 1.0
        else:
            reward = 0.0
            
        RL_agent.update_q_value(state, action, reward)

    # Apply the rule with the learned weights to the entire dataset
    fitness_score = calculate_accuracy(candidate_rule, reference_dataset, RL_agent)
    return fitness_score
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Adaptive Rules:** The system can learn rules that are optimized for specific data characteristics, leading to improved accuracy.
*   **Robustness:**  The RL agent can help the system generalize to unseen data by learning robust weight combinations.
*   **Automated Optimization:** The RL agent automates the process of tuning rule weights, reducing the need for manual intervention.
