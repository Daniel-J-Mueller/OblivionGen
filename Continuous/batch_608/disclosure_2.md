## Dynamic Contextual Embeddings for Seed Item Discovery

**Specification:** A system for enhancing seed item discovery by incorporating dynamic contextual embeddings derived from real-time user interaction and external knowledge graphs.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on token importance based on frequency within a catalog. This extension proposes moving beyond static token analysis to dynamically represent seed items (and candidate items) as contextual embeddings that evolve based on user behavior and external knowledge.

**Components:**

1.  **User Interaction Stream:** Captures real-time user interactions: clicks, dwell time, purchases, add-to-cart events, search queries, and explicit feedback (ratings, reviews).

2.  **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Integrates a knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, ConceptNet) to provide semantic relationships between items and concepts. This adds external information beyond the catalog's textual descriptions.

3.  **Contextual Embedding Generator:**  A neural network (Transformer-based architecture preferred) that takes as input:
    *   Seed Item's Textual Description
    *   Seed Item's Interaction History (from the User Interaction Stream) – represented as a sequence of event embeddings.
    *   Seed Item's Knowledge Graph Representation – a graph embedding representing the item's connections in the knowledge graph.

    The network outputs a *dynamic contextual embedding* for the seed item.  This embedding is a high-dimensional vector that represents the item's meaning within the current context of user behavior and external knowledge.

4.  **Candidate Embedding Generator:**  A similar network architecture to the Seed Embedding Generator. This generator creates dynamic embeddings for candidate items, using their textual descriptions, interaction histories, and knowledge graph representations.

5.  **Similarity Engine:**  Calculates similarity between seed and candidate embeddings using a distance metric (e.g., cosine similarity).  This provides a similarity score reflecting contextual relevance.

6. **Dynamic Weighting Module:** A system which calculates a weighting factor for similarity scores, dependent on:
    * Time decay – Recent interaction history is weighted more heavily than older data.
    * User demographics – User-specific preferences are incorporated.
    * Seasonality – Seasonal trends influence weighting.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Seed Item Discovery Pipeline

// Input: Seed Item Textual Description, Seed Item Interaction History, Seed Item Knowledge Graph Representation, Catalog of Candidate Items

// 1. Generate Seed Embedding
seed_embedding = ContextualEmbeddingGenerator(Seed Item Textual Description, Seed Item Interaction History, Seed Item Knowledge Graph Representation)

// 2. Generate Candidate Embeddings for all items in the Catalog
candidate_embeddings = []
for item in Catalog:
    candidate_embedding = ContextualEmbeddingGenerator(item.Textual Description, item.Interaction History, item.Knowledge Graph Representation)
    candidate_embeddings.append(candidate_embedding)

// 3. Calculate Similarity Scores
similarity_scores = []
for candidate_embedding in candidate_embeddings:
    similarity_score = CosineSimilarity(seed_embedding, candidate_embedding)
    similarity_scores.append(similarity_score)

// 4. Apply Dynamic Weighting
weighted_similarity_scores = []
for score in similarity_scores:
    weighted_score = score * DynamicWeightingModule(score, UserDemographics, Seasonality)
    weighted_similarity_scores.append(weighted_score)

// 5. Select Top N Similar Items
top_n_items = SelectTopN(weighted_similarity_scores, N)

// Output: Top N Similar Items
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static token importance to a dynamic, context-aware approach to item discovery. By incorporating real-time user interaction and external knowledge, it can provide more relevant and personalized recommendations. The dynamic weighting module enables fine-grained control over the similarity calculation.
