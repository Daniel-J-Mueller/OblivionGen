## Automated Predictive Restocking System - "Project Nightingale"

**System Overview:**

Project Nightingale aims to move beyond error *detection* of missing items in shipments to *proactive* restocking based on predicted discrepancies. This system utilizes a multi-layered predictive model integrated with real-time shipment data and historical error patterns.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Historical Error Database:** A centralized database storing all instances of inner/outer pack discrepancies. This includes:
    *   Vendor ID
    *   Item ID
    *   Shipment ID
    *   Predicted Quantity
    *   Received Quantity
    *   Discrepancy Type (inner pack missing, outer pack short, etc.)
    *   Environmental Data (temperature, humidity during shipment - if available)
    *   Time of Year / Seasonality

2.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:** A machine learning model (likely a combination of time series forecasting and classification algorithms) trained on the Historical Error Database.
    *   **Input Features:** Vendor ID, Item ID, Shipment Date, Predicted Quantity, Historical Discrepancy Rates (for the vendor/item combination), Seasonality, Environmental Data (if available).
    *   **Output:**  A "Discrepancy Risk Score" (0-100) indicating the probability of a discrepancy occurring in the current shipment.

3.  **Real-Time Shipment Integration:**  A system that receives advance shipment notices (ASNs) containing predicted quantities. This data is pre-processed and fed into the Predictive Modeling Engine.

4.  **Automated Restocking Trigger:** Based on the Discrepancy Risk Score:
    *   **Low Risk (0-30):** No action taken. Standard receiving process.
    *   **Medium Risk (31-60):**  Automated creation of a "Pre-emptive Restock Order" for a small buffer quantity of the item. This order is placed with the vendor and scheduled to arrive shortly *after* the shipment.
    *   **High Risk (61-100):** Automated creation of a larger Pre-emptive Restock Order and alerts to receiving staff to prioritize inspection of the shipment.

5.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns from new shipment data. Discrepancies detected during receiving are fed back into the Historical Error Database to refine the Predictive Model.



**Pseudocode (Automated Restocking Trigger):**

```
FUNCTION TriggerRestock(ShipmentData):
  riskScore = PredictDiscrepancyRisk(ShipmentData)

  IF riskScore <= 30:
    // No action. Standard receiving process.
    RETURN

  ELSE IF riskScore <= 60:
    // Medium Risk. Create small pre-emptive restock order.
    bufferQuantity = CalculateBufferQuantity(ShipmentData)
    CreateRestockOrder(VendorID, ItemID, bufferQuantity)

  ELSE:  // riskScore > 60
    // High Risk. Create larger order and alert staff
    bufferQuantity = CalculateLargeBufferQuantity(ShipmentData)
    CreateRestockOrder(VendorID, ItemID, bufferQuantity)
    SendAlertToReceivingStaff(ShipmentID, "High Discrepancy Risk - Prioritize Inspection")

END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server for running the Predictive Modeling Engine.
*   Database server for storing the Historical Error Database.
*   API integrations with vendor systems for receiving ASNs and placing restock orders.
*   Real-time data streaming platform for processing shipment data.
*   User interface for monitoring system performance and managing alerts.



**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Image Recognition:** Integrate image recognition to automatically scan and verify item quantities during receiving.
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Use blockchain to create a transparent and auditable record of shipment data and discrepancies.
*   **Predictive Packaging Analysis:**  Analyze packaging data to identify potential risks of damage during shipping.
