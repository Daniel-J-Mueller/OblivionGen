## Dynamic Sensory Narrative Generation

**Concept:** Extend environmental data analysis beyond content filtering to proactively *generate* personalized, contextually relevant narrative experiences delivered through the device’s display and audio systems. This isn't about *restricting* content, but creating *new* content tailored to the immediate environment and detected individuals.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensor Fusion Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw data streams from all available device sensors (camera, microphone, GPS, accelerometer, light sensor, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi scanning).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Real-time object recognition (people, animals, objects) via computer vision.
    *   Audio event detection (speech, music, environmental sounds).
    *   Location-based data (POI, geofencing).
    *   Bluetooth/Wi-Fi device detection (identifying known individuals/devices).
*   **Output:** A unified "Environmental Context Profile" (ECP) containing:
    *   Identified individuals (with associated profiles - age, interests, relationships).
    *   Detected objects and scenes.
    *   Location and environmental conditions (time of day, weather).
    *   Detected communication patterns (nearby conversations, ringtones).

**2. Narrative Engine:**

*   **Input:** ECP. User profile (preferences, historical data).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Narrative Template Selection:** Choose a narrative template based on ECP and user profile. Examples:
        *   "Mysterious Encounter" (suitable for solitary walks in urban environments).
        *   "Historical Context" (triggered by proximity to historical landmarks).
        *   "Family Story" (activated when family members are detected nearby).
        *   “Ambient Soundscape” (creates a dynamic soundscape around the user's environment)
    *   **Content Generation:** Dynamically generate narrative elements (text, audio, visual effects) based on selected template and ECP.
    *   **Personalization:** Adapt narrative elements based on identified individuals and their profiles.  Example: If a child is detected, incorporate their name or interests into the narrative.
*   **Output:** A stream of narrative data (text, audio, visual instructions) for the presentation layer.

**3. Presentation Layer:**

*   **Input:** Narrative data stream.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Visual Rendering:** Display narrative elements as augmented reality overlays on the device's screen, blending seamlessly with the real world.
    *   **Audio Synthesis:** Generate and play synthesized voiceovers, ambient sounds, and musical scores to enhance the narrative experience.
    *   **Haptic Feedback:** Utilize the device’s haptic engine to provide subtle tactile cues that reinforce the narrative.
*   **Output:** A fully immersive, contextually relevant narrative experience for the user.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Engine - Content Generation):**

```
function generateContent(ECP, UserProfile):
  template = selectTemplate(ECP, UserProfile)

  if template == "Mysterious Encounter":
    setting = ECP.location
    character = generateCharacter(UserProfile.interests)
    plotPoint = generatePlotPoint(setting, character)
    narrativeText = "You are walking through " + setting + ". Suddenly, you see " + character + ". " + plotPoint

  else if template == "Historical Context":
    historicalEvent = getHistoricalEvent(ECP.location)
    narrativeText = "Did you know that " + historicalEvent + " happened right here?"

  else if template == "Family Story":
    familyMember = ECP.identifiedIndividuals[0]
    story = getFamilyStory(familyMember)
    narrativeText = "Remember when " + familyMember + "..." + story

  else:
    narrativeText = "An interesting moment..."

  return narrativeText
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution camera with advanced object recognition capabilities.
*   Multi-microphone array for accurate audio capture and source localization.
*   GPS and other location sensors.
*   Powerful processor and graphics card for real-time rendering and processing.
*   Haptic engine.
*   High-quality speakers or headphones.
