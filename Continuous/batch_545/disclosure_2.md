## Dynamic Feature Flag Orchestration with Predictive Cohort Assignment

**Concept:** Expand beyond dynamic *segmentation* to dynamic *orchestration* of feature flag exposure, driven by a predictive model that anticipates user needs *before* explicit interaction data is available. This isn't about reacting to behavior; it’s about proactively shaping the user experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Feature Need Model (PFNM):**

*   **Input:**
    *   User Profile Data: Demographics, stated preferences, historical app usage (if any, even outside the current experiment), device information.
    *   Contextual Data: Time of day, location (coarse-grained, permission-dependent), device sensor data (e.g., motion, ambient light – again, permission-dependent).
    *   Feature Dependency Graph: A map defining relationships between features (e.g., Feature A requires Feature B to be enabled).
*   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a GRU or LSTM – trained to predict the *probability* of a user needing (or benefiting from) a specific feature *before* they interact with the app.  The RNN output is a vector representing feature need probabilities.
*   **Training Data:**  A large dataset of past app usage, feature flag assignments, and user engagement metrics.  Data augmentation techniques (e.g., generating synthetic user profiles) should be employed to improve model robustness.
*   **Output:** A prioritized list of features, ranked by predicted need/benefit, for each user.

**2. Feature Flag Assignment Engine (FFAE):**

*   **Input:**
    *   User ID
    *   PFNM output (prioritized feature list)
    *   Experiment Configuration: Rules defining which features are being tested and the acceptable variance in feature flag assignments.
    *   Feature Dependency Graph.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Proactive Assignment:** The FFAE *proactively* assigns feature flags based on the PFNM output, ensuring that the most relevant features are enabled for each user. This goes beyond simply placing users into cohorts; it's individualized feature flag control.
    *   **Dependency Resolution:** The FFAE automatically resolves feature dependencies, ensuring that all required features are enabled before assigning a dependent feature.
    *   **Experiment Balancing:**  The FFAE incorporates a constraint satisfaction solver to balance feature flag assignments across different variants within the experiment, respecting the Experiment Configuration.  This ensures statistically valid A/B testing.
    *   **Gradual Rollout:**  Allows for gradual rollout of features to a percentage of users within each predicted need segment, mitigating risk.

**3. Real-Time Feedback Loop:**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously collect user engagement metrics (e.g., time spent on feature, conversion rates, error rates).
*   **Model Retraining:**  The PFNM is retrained periodically (e.g., daily) using the collected data, improving its prediction accuracy.
*   **A/B Testing of Model:** A/B test different PFNM architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

**Pseudocode (FFAE):**

```
function assignFeatureFlags(userId):
  userProfile = getUserProfile(userId)
  contextualData = getContextualData(userId)
  featureNeedProbabilities = predictFeatureNeeds(userProfile, contextualData) // From PFNM
  prioritizedFeatures = sortFeaturesByProbability(featureNeedProbabilities)

  assignedFlags = {}
  for feature in prioritizedFeatures:
    if isFeatureInExperiment(feature):
      variant = determineVariant(feature) // Randomly assign based on experiment config
      assignedFlags[feature] = variant
    else:
      assignedFlags[feature] = 'off'

  // Dependency Resolution:
  for feature, variant in assignedFlags.items():
    dependencies = getFeatureDependencies(feature)
    for dependency in dependencies:
      if dependency not in assignedFlags:
        assignedFlags[dependency] = 'off' // Or default value

  return assignedFlags
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply *reacting* to user behavior with dynamic segmentation. It *proactively* shapes the user experience by predicting needs and assigning feature flags accordingly. This individualized feature flag control has the potential to significantly improve user engagement and conversion rates. It's also extensible – the PFNM could be trained to predict other user needs beyond just feature requirements.
