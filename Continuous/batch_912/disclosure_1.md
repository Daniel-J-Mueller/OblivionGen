## Adaptive Resolution Edge Detection with Temporal Smoothing

**Concept:** Extend depth-based edge detection by dynamically adjusting the resolution of the depth map analysis based on scene complexity and incorporating temporal smoothing to reduce noise and improve robustness.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Depth Sensor: Time-of-Flight (ToF) or Structured Light sensor with adjustable resolution. Minimum: 640x480.
*   Processing Unit: Embedded system or dedicated processor with sufficient compute power for real-time depth map processing and plane fitting. (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano or equivalent)
*   Memory: Minimum 4GB RAM.
*   Optional: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for improved temporal registration.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Depth Map Acquisition Module:** Interface with the depth sensor to capture depth maps at varying resolutions (user or algorithm selectable).
*   **Resolution Adjustment Algorithm:** Dynamically determine the appropriate depth map resolution based on:
    *   **Scene Complexity Metric:** Calculate a metric (e.g., standard deviation of depth values within a local window) to estimate the density of edges in the scene. Higher standard deviation indicates more complex geometry.
    *   **Target Edge Density:** User-defined parameter specifying the desired number of edge pixels per unit area.
    *   **Resolution Scaling:** Adjust depth map resolution (upscale or downscale) to achieve the target edge density based on the scene complexity metric.
*   **Plane Fitting Module:** Utilize a total least squares algorithm (or approximation) for robust plane fitting to local pixel neighborhoods.
*   **Edge Detection Module:** Calculate inlier/outlier ratios as described in the provided patent. 
*   **Temporal Smoothing Module:**
    *   **Frame Buffering:** Store a buffer of recent depth maps (e.g., 5-10 frames).
    *   **Depth Map Registration:** Align consecutive depth maps using IMU data (if available) or feature-based registration.
    *   **Edge Map Fusion:** Combine edge maps from multiple frames using a weighted average, giving more weight to edges that are consistently detected across multiple frames.
    *   **Noise Reduction:** Apply a median filter or Gaussian filter to the fused edge map to further reduce noise and spurious edge detections.
*   **Output Module:** Provide edge map as output for subsequent processing.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Set targetEdgeDensity = UserDefinedValue
Set frameBuffer = EmptyBuffer // Buffer to hold recent frames
Set frameCount = 0

// Main Loop
While (true)
{
    // Acquire Depth Map
    depthMap = AcquireDepthMap()

    // Calculate Scene Complexity Metric
    complexity = CalculateSceneComplexity(depthMap)

    // Determine Resolution
    resolution = DetermineResolution(complexity, targetEdgeDensity)
    Rescale depthMap to resolution

    // Plane Fitting & Edge Detection
    edgeMap = DetectEdges(depthMap)

    // Temporal Smoothing
    If (frameCount > 0)
    {
        registeredEdgeMap = RegisterEdgeMap(edgeMap, previousEdgeMap) //Using IMU or Feature tracking
        smoothedEdgeMap = FuseEdgeMaps(registeredEdgeMap, previousEdgeMaps) //Weighted Average
        smoothedEdgeMap = ApplyNoiseReduction(smoothedEdgeMap)
    }
    Else
    {
        smoothedEdgeMap = edgeMap
    }
    
    //Store current edge map and increment frame count
    Store edgeMap
    Increment frameCount
    
    // Output Smoothed Edge Map
    Output smoothedEdgeMap
}
```

**IV. Key Innovations:**

*   **Adaptive Resolution:**  Optimizes processing resources by focusing detail on complex areas and reducing it in simpler areas.
*   **Temporal Smoothing:** Improves robustness to noise and sensor inaccuracies by leveraging information from multiple frames.
*   **Combined Approach:** Synergy between resolution and temporal components to create a smoother, more accurate edge map for a broad range of operating conditions.
