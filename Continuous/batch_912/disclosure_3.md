## Dynamic Prosody Injection for Multimodal Punctuation & Casing

**Concept:** Expand the acoustic feature set beyond frame-level embeddings to incorporate dynamically generated prosodic features *during* the multimodal fusion process. Instead of simply aligning acoustic embeddings to lexical features, actively *inject* prosodic information to influence punctuation/casing prediction.

**Specs:**

1.  **Prosody Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Raw audio waveform, frame-level acoustic embeddings (as per the base patent).
    *   Process:
        *   Real-time pitch tracking (e.g., using YIN or CREPE algorithms).
        *   Energy calculation (RMS amplitude).
        *   Duration variation analysis (measure of tempo/rhythm changes).
        *   Calculate Delta and Delta-Delta values for all prosodic features.
    *   Output: Time-series of prosodic features (pitch, energy, duration variation, and their derivatives) synchronized with the audio frames.

2.  **Prosody Feature Embedding Layer:**
    *   Input: Time-series of prosodic features.
    *   Process:  A 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple layers.  Each layer uses small kernel sizes (e.g., 3-5 frames) to capture local prosodic patterns.  Apply Batch Normalization and ReLU activation after each layer. Output is a sequence of prosodic embeddings, aligned to the audio frames.
    *   Output: Sequence of prosodic embeddings.

3.  **Multimodal Fusion Enhancement:**
    *   Modify the existing multimodal fusion layer (as described in the base patent).
    *   Introduce a gated mechanism to control the influence of prosodic features. This could be implemented with a learned gate vector.
    *   Concatenate the lexical features, acoustic embeddings, *and* prosodic embeddings.
    *   Apply the gate vector element-wise to the concatenated sequence before feeding it into the prediction layer.

    ```pseudocode
    # Inputs:
    #   lexical_features: Sequence of lexical features
    #   acoustic_embeddings: Sequence of acoustic embeddings
    #   prosodic_embeddings: Sequence of prosodic embeddings
    #   gate_vector: Learned gate vector (same length as the concatenated sequence)

    # Concatenate features
    combined_features = concatenate(lexical_features, acoustic_embeddings, prosodic_embeddings)

    # Apply gating mechanism
    gated_features = combined_features * gate_vector  # Element-wise multiplication

    # Predict punctuation and casing from gated_features
    predicted_punctuation_casing = prediction_layer(gated_features)
    ```

4.  **Training Regime:**
    *   Train the entire system end-to-end.
    *   Use a combination of Cross-Entropy loss for punctuation/casing prediction and a regularization term to encourage the gate vector to learn meaningful weights.
    *   Consider adversarial training to improve the robustness of the prosody feature embeddings.

5.  **System Integration:** The Prosody Generation Module should be implemented as a separate microservice to facilitate real-time processing and scalability. Communication between the microservice and the main transcription service can be achieved through a message queue (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ).
