## Adaptive Lease Granularity & Predictive Offload

**Concept:** Extend the connection lease concept beyond a single server/client pairing, and introduce predictive offload based on real-time server resource analysis *during* the lease period. The goal is to proactively balance load *before* a server becomes overloaded, while maintaining a seamless user experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Lease Granularity:**

*   **Hierarchical Leases:** Instead of a direct server-client lease, the initial response from the load balancer indicates a 'lease group' – a small cluster of servers capable of fulfilling the request. The client receives an identifier for this group.
*   **Dynamic Server Assignment:** Within the lease group, the *first* server handling the request is designated the 'primary'. Subsequent requests are still directed to the primary *unless* the primary’s load exceeds a threshold.
*   **Internal Routing Protocol:** Servers within a lease group communicate via a lightweight internal routing protocol (UDP-based). This protocol allows servers to advertise their current load (CPU, memory, network I/O) to each other.

**2. Predictive Offload Logic (Implemented on each server within a lease group):**

*   **Load Prediction:** Each server monitors its own resource usage *and* receives load data from its peers.  It uses a simple time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., Exponential Smoothing) to predict its resource usage over the remaining lease duration.
*   **Offload Trigger:** If the predicted resource usage exceeds a pre-defined threshold *before* the lease expires, the server initiates an offload.
*   **Offload Process:**
    *   The server selects a peer with available capacity.
    *   The server transparently redirects *future* requests from the current client to the selected peer.  (This redirection happens at the server level, the client remains unaware).
    *   The original server becomes a passive observer and can be reclaimed for other tasks.
*   **Lease Extension:** During the offload, the lease is *extended* to the new server.  The client continues to use the original lease group identifier, but the 'active' server handling the requests has changed.

**3.  Load Balancer Integration:**

*   The load balancer maintains a mapping of lease groups to available servers.
*   When assigning a new request, the load balancer considers not only server load but also the *predicted* load within each lease group.
*   The load balancer periodically polls servers to update load predictions.

**Pseudocode (Server-side - Predictive Offload):**

```
// Server receives a request
onRequest(request) {
  // Get current load
  currentLoad = getLoad();

  // Predict load for the remaining lease duration
  predictedLoad = predictLoad(currentLoad, leaseDuration);

  if (predictedLoad > overloadThreshold) {
    // Find a peer with available capacity
    peer = findAvailablePeer();

    if (peer != null) {
      // Redirect future requests to the peer
      redirectRequestsTo(peer);

      // Update internal routing table
      updateRoutingTable(peer);
    } else {
      // Log error - no available peers
    }
  }

  // Process the request
  processRequest(request);
}

// Function to get load (CPU, memory, I/O)
getLoad() {
  // Implementation details
}

// Function to predict load
predictLoad(currentLoad, leaseDuration) {
  // Implementation details - Exponential Smoothing or similar
}

// Function to find an available peer
findAvailablePeer() {
  // Implementation details - Query peers for load
}

// Function to redirect requests
redirectRequestsTo(peer) {
  // Implementation details - Update routing tables, forward connections
}

```

**Benefits:**

*   **Improved Load Balancing:** Proactive offload prevents overload before it occurs.
*   **Seamless User Experience:** The client remains unaware of server changes.
*   **Increased Server Utilization:** Servers are kept busy, even during periods of low activity.
*   **Scalability:** The system can easily scale to accommodate a large number of servers and clients.
