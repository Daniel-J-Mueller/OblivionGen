**Dynamic Inventory “Shadowing” & Predictive Bundling**

**Core Concept:** Extend the inventory exhaustion prediction beyond single items to *shadow* related items and proactively suggest bundled purchases *before* a predicted exhaustion, influencing demand and maximizing revenue.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Relationship Graph:**
    *   Create a data structure representing item relationships. This isn’t just ‘often bought together’ – it's a weighted graph based on:
        *   Historical co-purchase data (high weight).
        *   Component/accessory relationships (e.g., phone & case – medium weight).
        *   Stylistic/thematic relationships (determined via image/text analysis of item descriptions – low weight, dynamically adjusted).
    *   Graph is updated daily.

2.  **Shadow Inventory Calculation:**
    *   For a given item ‘A’ with predicted exhaustion time ‘T’, identify ‘n’ most strongly related items (from the relationship graph).
    *   Calculate a “shadow exhaustion” time for each related item ‘B’, *based on the projected demand increase* expected from bundling with ‘A’ as ‘A’ nears exhaustion.
        *   Demand increase estimated from historical bundle purchase rates.
        *   Shadow exhaustion time is calculated *before* any actual depletion of item ‘B’.

3.  **Proactive Bundle Recommendations:**
    *   When item ‘A’ is predicted to exhaust within a configurable timeframe (e.g., 72 hours), dynamically generate and display bundled recommendations including item ‘A’ *and* its related ‘shadow’ items.
    *   Bundle pricing can be adjusted based on shadow exhaustion time – incentivize purchase of items nearing shadow exhaustion.
    *   Display messaging: “Limited stock! Complete your purchase with these complementary items before they're gone.”

4.  **Demand Shaping Algorithm:**
    *   If shadow exhaustion time for item ‘B’ is approaching, the system can *dynamically adjust* bundle pricing and/or recommend different bundles to ‘shift’ demand away from items with very short shadow times towards those with longer times.
    *   Goal: Even out demand and avoid secondary item exhaustion.

5.  **System Components:**
    *   **Relationship Engine:** Creates and maintains the item relationship graph.
    *   **Prediction Engine:**  Calculates item exhaustion times (as in the original patent) and shadow exhaustion times.
    *   **Recommendation Engine:** Generates and prioritizes bundle recommendations.
    *   **Pricing Engine:** Dynamically adjusts bundle pricing.
    *   **User Interface:** Displays bundle recommendations and messaging.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine - Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION generate_bundle_recommendations(item_A, current_time):
  exhaustion_time_A = PredictionEngine.predict_exhaustion(item_A)
  related_items = RelationshipEngine.get_related_items(item_A)
  bundle_candidates = []

  FOR each item_B in related_items:
    shadow_exhaustion_time_B = PredictionEngine.predict_shadow_exhaustion(item_B, item_A)
    IF shadow_exhaustion_time_B <= (exhaustion_time_A + configurable_timeframe):
      bundle_candidates.append((item_B, shadow_exhaustion_time_B))

  bundle_candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  // Sort by shadow exhaustion time

  recommended_bundles = []
  FOR i in range(min(3, len(bundle_candidates))): // Recommend top 3 bundles
    recommended_bundles.append(bundle_candidates[i][0])

  RETURN recommended_bundles
```
