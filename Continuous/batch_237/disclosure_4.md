## Dynamic Content Refraction & Layered Perception

**Concept:** Extend the hardware-independent graphics command system to support *dynamic content refraction* and *layered perception*. Instead of simply rendering a flat representation of a content page, the system will simulate light refraction through different content layers, allowing for a pseudo-3D effect and enhanced user interaction possibilities. This is coupled with a user-definable 'perception layer' which prioritizes information based on user need or preference.

**Specs:**

*   **Refraction Engine:**
    *   Content will be parsed into distinct layers (text, images, video, interactive elements).
    *   Each layer will be assigned a 'refraction index' value. Higher values indicate greater light bending.
    *   A virtual light source will be modeled within the system.
    *   Hardware-independent graphics commands will be extended to include refraction calculations based on layer index, light source position, and virtual surface normals.  Commands will specify how light bends as it passes through each layer before reaching the user's 'viewpoint'.
    *   Rendering will simulate light propagation through the layered content, creating realistic shadows, highlights, and distortion effects.  This wonâ€™t be ray tracing, but a simplified approximation optimized for performance.
    *   Support for dynamically changing refraction indices based on user interaction (e.g., "focusing" on a layer).

*   **Perception Layer:**
    *   User profiles will store 'perception priorities' for different content types and elements (e.g., "prioritize images over text", "highlight keywords related to 'finance'").
    *   A 'perception engine' will analyze the rendered content and adjust layer visibility and refraction levels based on user priorities.
    *   Layers with low priority may be rendered with reduced detail or transparency.
    *   Layers containing prioritized elements may be rendered with increased brightness, contrast, or a subtle 'glow' effect.
    *   User interface element to manually adjust 'perception filters' in real-time.

*   **Command Extensions:**
    *   `REFRACT(layerID, indexValue, surfaceNormal)`: Sets the refraction index and surface normal for a given layer.
    *   `PERCEIVE(priorityLevel, contentType, keyword)`:  Sets the perception priority for a content type or keyword.
    *   `FOCUS(layerID)`:  Temporarily increases the refraction index and brightness of a specified layer, drawing user attention.
    *   `LAYER_VISIBILITY(layerID, visibility)`: Controls the visibility of a layer.

*   **Pseudocode - Rendering Loop:**

```
FOR each layer in content:
    GET layer properties (refractionIndex, surfaceNormal, visibility)
    IF visibility == FALSE:
        SKIP layer
    CALCULATE light propagation through layer based on refractionIndex and surfaceNormal
    APPLY calculated effects to layer rendering
    APPLY perception priority adjustments (brightness, contrast, transparency)
ENDFOR

RENDER all layers onto the display
```

*   **Potential Use Cases:**
    *   **Interactive Data Visualization:** Layers could represent different data dimensions, allowing users to "refract" the data to reveal hidden patterns.
    *   **Immersive Storytelling:** Dynamic refraction could create a sense of depth and immersion, enhancing the storytelling experience.
    *   **Accessibility:** Perception layers could prioritize content based on user needs, improving readability and comprehension for users with disabilities.
    *   **Enhanced Advertisement:** Advertisements could 'break through' other content layers to grab user attention (with appropriate user controls).
