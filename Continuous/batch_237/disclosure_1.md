## Adaptive Artifact Prefetching & User Behavior Prediction

**System Overview:**

This system extends the concept of partial artifact uploads by proactively prefetching artifacts *based on predicted user behavior* and dynamically adjusting prefetch aggressiveness. Instead of reacting to upload requests with a diff, this system anticipates needs.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Analysis Engine (BAE):** A machine learning model trained on user interaction data (application usage patterns, feature clicks, data consumption, time of day, location - with user permission) to predict *future* artifact requests. Outputs a probability distribution of likely artifact needs over a defined time horizon (e.g., next 30 minutes).

2.  **Prefetch Coordinator:** This component receives the BAE’s predictions and determines which artifacts to prefetch to the cache proxy. It considers:
    *   Prediction confidence level.
    *   Artifact size.
    *   Network bandwidth availability (dynamic assessment).
    *   Cache proxy capacity.
    *   User-defined prefetch settings (e.g., “Aggressive,” “Balanced,” “Conservative”).

3.  **Dynamic Cache Prioritization:** The system dynamically adjusts cache prioritization based on predicted artifact needs. Artifacts with high prediction scores are given higher priority, potentially evicting lower-priority items.

4.  **Adaptive Bandwidth Throttling:**  The Prefetch Coordinator modulates the prefetch rate to avoid overwhelming the network or interfering with user activities. It uses real-time network feedback to adjust the throttle.

**Data Flow:**

1.  BAE continuously analyzes user behavior and generates prediction scores for artifacts.
2.  Prefetch Coordinator polls BAE for predictions.
3.  Prefetch Coordinator selects artifacts to prefetch based on prediction scores, resource availability, and user settings.
4.  The system fetches the selected artifacts from a central repository or content delivery network (CDN).
5.  Prefetched artifacts are stored in the cache proxy, associated with the user.
6.  When the user requests an artifact, the system first checks the cache proxy. If the artifact is present, it’s served immediately. If not, the system proceeds with the standard upload/diff process.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Coordinator):**

```
function prefetch_artifacts(user_id):
  predictions = BAE.get_artifact_predictions(user_id)  // Returns list of (artifact_id, probability)
  
  sorted_predictions = sort(predictions, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) // Sort by probability
  
  artifact_queue = []
  
  for artifact_id, probability in sorted_predictions:
      if (cache_proxy.contains(artifact_id) == False) and (artifact_queue.size() < MAX_ARTIFACTS_IN_QUEUE):
          artifact_queue.append(artifact_id)
  
  bandwidth_available = get_bandwidth_availability()
  
  while(artifact_queue.size() > 0):
      artifact_id = artifact_queue.pop(0)
      
      artifact_size = get_artifact_size(artifact_id)
      
      if (artifact_size <= bandwidth_available):
        fetch_artifact(artifact_id)
        cache_proxy.store(artifact_id)
        bandwidth_available -= artifact_size
      else:
        break
```

**Scalability & Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Cache:**  Use a distributed cache system to handle a large number of users and artifacts.
*   **Edge Caching:**  Deploy cache proxies at edge locations to reduce latency.
*   **Privacy:**  Implement robust privacy controls to protect user data. Obtain explicit user consent before collecting and analyzing behavioral data.
*   **Model Training:**  Regularly retrain the BAE model with updated user data to maintain accuracy.
*   **Cold Start Problem:**  Implement a strategy for handling new users with limited behavioral data. (e.g., use default predictions based on popular artifacts).
