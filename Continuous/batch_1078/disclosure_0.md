## Adaptive Dimensional Weighting for Dynamic Blocking

**Concept:** Extend the existing dynamic blocking system by introducing adaptive weighting to the monitored dimensions. Instead of fixed thresholds, the system learns which dimensions are most indicative of malicious activity and adjusts their weight accordingly. This allows for more nuanced blocking and reduces false positives.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Input:** Raw request data (as currently collected by the system).
*   **Dimensions:** Utilize the existing monitored dimensions (originating address, session info, user info, etc.).
*   **Ground Truth:** Implement a mechanism for providing "ground truth" data. This could involve:
    *   Manual labeling of requests as malicious or benign by security analysts.
    *   Integration with existing threat intelligence feeds.
    *   Automated detection systems (e.g., WAF, IDS) providing feedback.
*   **Feature Vectors:** For each request, create a feature vector representing the values of the monitored dimensions.  One-hot encode categorical dimensions. Normalize numerical dimensions.

**2. Model Training & Weight Adjustment:**

*   **Model:** Employ a machine learning model capable of assigning weights to dimensions. Suggested models:
    *   **Logistic Regression:** Simple, interpretable, and efficient.
    *   **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):** Higher accuracy, but more complex.
    *   **Neural Network:**  Potential for higher accuracy with sufficient data, but requires more resources.
*   **Training Data:** Utilize the feature vectors and ground truth labels to train the model.
*   **Weight Updates:** The model outputs weights for each monitored dimension. These weights reflect the importance of each dimension in predicting malicious activity.
*   **Online Learning:**  Implement online learning to continuously update the weights as new data becomes available. This allows the system to adapt to evolving threats.

**3. Dynamic Blocking with Weighted Thresholds:**

*   **Weighted Sum:**  For each request, calculate a weighted sum of the dimension values, using the weights learned by the model.
*   **Dynamic Threshold:** Calculate a blocking threshold based on the weighted sum. The threshold can be adjusted based on:
    *   A global sensitivity setting.
    *   A per-host sensitivity setting (allowing for different levels of blocking on different hosts).
*   **Blocking Logic:** Block requests whose weighted sum exceeds the dynamic threshold.

**4. Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
// Initialization
model = load_machine_learning_model()
threshold_sensitivity = 0.75  // Adjustable parameter

// For each incoming request
request_data = get_request_data()
feature_vector = create_feature_vector(request_data)
weighted_sum = calculate_weighted_sum(feature_vector, model)
dynamic_threshold = threshold_sensitivity * weighted_sum // Or more complex calculation
if weighted_sum > dynamic_threshold:
  block_request(request_data)
  log_blocked_request(request_data)
else:
  process_request(request_data)

// Background process (online learning)
new_data = get_new_request_data_with_labels()
model = train_model(model, new_data)
```

**5. Advanced Features:**

*   **Dimension Correlation Analysis:** Identify correlations between dimensions.  Adjust weights to account for these correlations.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Use anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns in dimension values.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Provide explanations for why a request was blocked.  This helps security analysts understand and refine the blocking rules.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Allow security analysts to override blocking decisions. Use this feedback to improve the accuracy of the model.
