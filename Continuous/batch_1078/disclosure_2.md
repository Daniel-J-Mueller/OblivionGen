## Adaptive Query Federation with Dynamic Schema Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the described system to handle not just structured/unstructured data *types*, but also data sources exhibiting *dynamic schemas* – schemas that change over time or are not fully known upfront. This builds on the idea of stateless operations dispatched to remote engines, but introduces a synthesis layer to bridge schema gaps.

**Specifications:**

**1. Schema Inference Module (SIM):**

*   **Input:** Raw data stream from remote query engines (unstructured/dynamic schema sources).
*   **Function:** SIM employs lightweight machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, probabilistic topic models) to infer schema elements (field names, data types, potential relationships) from the incoming data.  It *doesn’t* require a predefined schema.
*   **Output:** A probabilistic schema representation – a collection of potential schema elements with associated confidence scores. This is a metadata object.
*   **Technology:** Python with libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch, scikit-learn.  Consider a serverless deployment model (e.g., AWS Lambda) for scalability.

**2. Schema Synthesis Engine (SSE):**

*   **Input:**  Probabilistic schema from SIM, predefined schema of structured data, query requirements.
*   **Function:** SSE intelligently maps schema elements from the dynamic source to the structured data schema, even if a direct mapping doesn’t exist. It employs these strategies:
    *   **Semantic Similarity:**  Uses techniques like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to identify semantically similar fields.
    *   **Data Type Coercion:** Automatically converts data types when possible (e.g., string to integer).
    *   **Default Value Insertion:** If a field is missing from the dynamic source, inserts a default value.  The default value strategy can be configured (e.g., null, 0, average).
    *   **Dynamic Field Creation:**  Creates new fields in the structured data schema to accommodate unique elements from the dynamic source (requires schema evolution capabilities in the structured data store).
*   **Output:** A unified schema – a complete schema that combines elements from the structured and dynamic sources.  This is a metadata object.
*   **Technology:** Java/Kotlin with a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to represent schema relationships.  A REST API for accessing the unified schema.

**3. Query Rewriting Module (QRM):**

*   **Input:** Original query, unified schema.
*   **Function:** QRM rewrites the original query to operate on the unified schema.  This involves:
    *   Resolving field names from the original query to their corresponding names in the unified schema.
    *   Adding type casts and conversions as needed.
    *   Generating additional predicates to filter out invalid or missing data.
*   **Output:** Rewritten query optimized for the unified schema.
*   **Technology:**  A rule-based engine (e.g., Drools) for query rewriting.

**4. Federated Execution Engine (FEE):** 

*   This module, an expansion of the existing query execution plan generator, now considers schema information from the SSE during plan generation.
*   It pushes down schema-aware predicates to the remote query engines, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred.
*   It supports dynamic partitioning of the unstructured data based on the inferred schema.

**Pseudocode (FEE):**

```
function generate_execution_plan(query, structured_data_schema, dynamic_data_schema):
  // 1. Generate plan for structured data operations
  structured_plan = generate_structured_plan(query, structured_data_schema)

  // 2. Generate plan for dynamic data operations
  dynamic_plan = generate_dynamic_plan(query, dynamic_data_schema)

  // 3. Merge plans, optimizing for data transfer
  merged_plan = merge_plans(structured_plan, dynamic_plan)

  // 4. Push down schema-aware predicates to remote engines
  optimized_plan = push_down_predicates(merged_plan, dynamic_data_schema)

  return optimized_plan
```

**Deployment:**

*   Microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes.
*   Schema Inference Module and Schema Synthesis Engine are deployed as serverless functions.
*   Federated Execution Engine is deployed as a stateful service.
