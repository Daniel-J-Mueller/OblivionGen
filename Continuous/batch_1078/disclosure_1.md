## Dynamic Dependency Graph Compilation & Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Expand the pre-processing stage to build a comprehensive dependency graph not just for includes/libraries, but for *computational dependencies* within the source code itself. Utilize this graph to dynamically allocate serverless function resources *during* compilation, optimizing for parallelization potential and minimizing communication overhead.

**Specs:**

**1. Dependency Graph Generation:**

*   **Input:** Source code files.
*   **Process:**
    *   Static analysis of source code to identify functions, data structures, and their relationships.
    *   Extraction of function call graphs, data flow analysis (where data is read and written).
    *   Identification of computational dependencies: which functions *must* complete before others can start due to data dependencies. This is *beyond* simple include dependencies.
    *   Creation of a weighted directed graph representing these dependencies. Weights represent estimated computational cost of each function/code block.
*   **Output:** Dependency Graph (DG) – a data structure representing the relationships between code elements.  Format: JSON or similar, containing node (function/block ID) and edge (dependency, weight) information.

**2. Dynamic Resource Allocation:**

*   **Input:** DG, Target Compute Infrastructure (serverless platform details - memory, CPU limits per function), Compilation Configuration (parallelism degree).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Graph Partitioning:** Divide the DG into subgraphs, optimizing for minimal edge cuts (reduce communication) and balanced workload (equal subgraph size).
    *   **Resource Request Calculation:**  For each subgraph, estimate required resources (memory, CPU time) based on the weight of its nodes and estimated complexity.
    *   **Serverless Function Instance Creation:**  Dynamically request serverless function instances based on resource requests. Allocate functions to available resources.
    *   **Compilation Task Assignment:** Assign subgraphs to corresponding serverless function instances for compilation.
*   **Output:**  Map of Subgraph -> Serverless Function Instance. Schedule of Compilation Tasks.

**3. Compilation & Synchronization:**

*   **Input:** Compilation Tasks, Subgraph data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Serverless functions compile their assigned subgraphs.
    *   As a function completes, it signals the completion to a central orchestrator.
    *   Orchestrator monitors completion signals.  When all dependencies of a subsequent subgraph are met, that subgraph’s compilation is triggered. This is *dynamic task scheduling*.
    *   Data transfer between serverless functions occurs *only* when necessary, triggered by dependency completion.
*   **Output:**  Build Artifacts (object files, libraries).

**4. Linking & Application Generation:**

*   **Input:** Build Artifacts.
*   **Process:**
    *   Central linking process combines build artifacts to generate the executable application.
*   **Output:** Executable Application.

**Pseudocode (Orchestrator):**

```
function orchestrateCompilation(dependencyGraph, compilationConfiguration):
  subgraphs = partitionGraph(dependencyGraph)
  functionInstances = allocateResources(subgraphs, compilationConfiguration)
  activeTasks = subgraphs // Initial set of tasks to start

  while activeTasks is not empty:
    task = getNextReadyTask(activeTasks) // Task with all dependencies met
    
    if task is not null:
      compileResult = executeTask(task, functionInstances)
      
      if compileResult.success:
        markDependenciesAsCompleted(compileResult.dependencies)
        activeTasks.remove(task)
      else:
        //Handle error
        break
  
  if all tasks completed successfully:
    linkArtifacts()
    generateApplication()
```

**Innovation:**  This isn’t just parallel compilation; it's *adaptive* parallel compilation. By analyzing dependencies *within* the code, the system dynamically adjusts resource allocation to maximize parallelism and minimize overhead. The runtime dependency resolution allows for optimized scheduling and resource utilization, potentially leading to significantly faster compilation times for large projects.  The core is a shift from static task assignment to a dynamic, dependency-driven workflow.
