## Adaptive Data Anomaly Prediction with Generative Models

**Specification:** A system extending data validation by incorporating predictive anomaly detection using generative adversarial networks (GANs) or variational autoencoders (VAEs). The core innovation lies in dynamically tailoring the generative model's training data based on the historical validation events identified by the existing system.

**Components:**

1.  **Historical Event Database:** Stores a record of all detected validation failures (reporting events) from the existing system.  Each event is tagged with metadata: timestamp, rule set triggered, data source, specific data fields affected, and severity.

2.  **Dynamic Training Data Selector:** This module queries the Historical Event Database. Based on configurable parameters (time window, severity threshold, data source focus), it selects a subset of historical validation failures and successful data instances (positive & negative examples). This creates a dynamically shifting training dataset for the generative model.

3.  **Generative Model (GAN or VAE):**  A neural network trained on the dynamically selected data. The model learns to generate synthetic data resembling the historical 'normal' behavior, while being sensitive to the anomalies present in the training set.  The model's architecture is configurable (e.g., number of layers, activation functions) to optimize performance on different data types.

4.  **Anomaly Scoring Engine:**  Compares incoming data streams against the generative model. This can be done by calculating the reconstruction error (VAE) or discriminator loss (GAN). High scores indicate potential anomalies.  A configurable threshold determines the anomaly classification.

5.  **Hybrid Validation Pipeline:** Integrates the generative model with the existing rule-based validation system.  Data passes through both systems. If the rule-based system detects an anomaly, the generative model's anomaly score is used to *augment* the severity assessment. If the rule-based system *doesn't* detect an anomaly, the generative model's anomaly score serves as an independent alert.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Scoring Engine - VAE Example):**

```python
def score_data(data_point, vae_model, threshold):
    # Encode the data point into a latent representation
    latent_representation, reconstruction = vae_model.encode_decode(data_point)

    # Calculate the reconstruction error (e.g., mean squared error)
    reconstruction_error = mse(data_point, reconstruction)

    # Calculate an anomaly score based on reconstruction error
    anomaly_score = scale(reconstruction_error) # Scale to 0-1 range

    # Check if the anomaly score exceeds the threshold
    if anomaly_score > threshold:
        return True, anomaly_score # Anomaly detected
    else:
        return False, anomaly_score # No anomaly detected

def mse(y_true, y_pred):
    # Implementation of Mean Squared Error
    return np.mean(np.square(y_true - y_pred))

def scale(value, min_value=0, max_value=1):
    # Scale the value between 0 and 1
    return (value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `Historical Data Time Window`:  Duration of historical data used for training the generative model.
*   `Severity Threshold`: Minimum severity of validation failures to include in the training data.
*   `Generative Model Type`:  Select between GAN or VAE.
*   `Anomaly Score Threshold`:  Threshold for classifying data as anomalous.
*   `Data Source Focus`: Prioritize training data from specific data sources.

**Innovation:**  This extends static validation rules with *adaptive* anomaly detection.  By learning from past failures, the system can identify subtle anomalies that rule-based systems might miss and proactively adapt to evolving data patterns. The dynamic training data selection ensures the model remains relevant and doesn't become stale.
