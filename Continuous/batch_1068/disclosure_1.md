**Adaptive Proximity-Based Access Control System**

**Concept:** Expand beyond financial transactions to encompass physical access control (doors, vehicles, secure areas) using dynamically adjusted proximity thresholds. The system learns user behavior to anticipate access needs and adjusts security parameters accordingly.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Mobile Device (Smartphone/Wearable): GPS, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), NFC.
    *   Access Point (Door/Vehicle/Secure Area): BLE beacon, NFC reader, optional camera.
    *   Central Server: Secure database, machine learning engine, API for mobile app integration.
*   **Software – Mobile App:**
    *   User Authentication: Secure login/biometric authentication.
    *   Location Services: Continuous background location tracking (user-configurable privacy settings).
    *   Proximity Profile Management: Allows users to define preferred proximity settings for different access points (e.g., "home" - very close proximity, "office" - moderate proximity, "shared workspace" - broader proximity).
    *   Behavioral Learning Module: Records user access patterns, time of day, day of week, location history, and adjusts proximity thresholds dynamically.
    *   Secure Communication: Encrypted communication with the central server and access points.
*   **Software – Central Server:**
    *   User Profile Database: Stores user data, access permissions, and behavioral learning data.
    *   Proximity Engine: Calculates proximity based on location data from mobile devices and access points.
    *   Machine Learning Module: Analyzes user behavior, predicts access needs, and dynamically adjusts proximity thresholds. This could include anomaly detection to flag potentially unauthorized access attempts.
    *   API: Provides secure access to data and functionality for the mobile app and access points.
*   **Software – Access Point:**
    *   BLE Beacon: Broadcasts a unique identifier.
    *   NFC Reader: Reads NFC tags on user devices.
    *   Secure Communication: Communicates with the central server to verify access requests.

**Pseudocode (Access Request Flow):**

```
// Mobile App:
1.  User approaches access point.
2.  App detects BLE beacon/NFC tag.
3.  App sends access request to central server (includes user ID, location data, access point ID).

// Central Server:
1.  Receive access request.
2.  Retrieve user profile and access permissions.
3.  Calculate proximity between user and access point.
4.  Apply machine learning model to dynamically adjust proximity threshold based on user behavior.
5.  If proximity is within adjusted threshold AND user has permission:
    6.  Send authorization signal to access point.
    7.  Log access event.
8.  Else:
    9.  Deny access.
    10. Log access attempt.

// Access Point:
1.  Receive authorization/denial signal.
2.  If authorized:
    3.  Unlock/grant access.
4.  Else:
    5.  Deny access/trigger alarm.
```

**Novelty:** The dynamic adjustment of proximity thresholds based on learned user behavior is the core innovation. This goes beyond static proximity settings and provides a more adaptive and secure access control system. The system anticipates user needs and reduces friction while maintaining a high level of security. It expands the use of proximity-based authentication beyond financial transactions to a wide range of access control applications.
