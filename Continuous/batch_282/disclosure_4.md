**Innovation Description:**

The core concept is to move beyond simple linear regression failure detection and implement a self-learning system using Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks combined with time-series anomaly detection. ART networks allow for incremental learning and categorization of load cell behavior *without* catastrophic forgetting – a key benefit for long-term operation in dynamic environments.

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** During initial operation (calibration and a period of 'normal' use), each load cell (or cluster of closely coupled load cells) builds an ART category representing its typical weight signature across various operating conditions. This signature is multi-dimensional, incorporating not just weight, but rate of change of weight, frequency components (from Fourier analysis), and other relevant features.

2.  **Dynamic Categorization:** Incoming weight data is presented to the ART network.  The network attempts to match the input to an existing category.
    *   **Match:** The data is categorized as ‘normal’.
    *   **Mismatch:** A new category is created, or an existing category is refined, capturing the novel weight signature.  This allows the system to adapt to changing operating conditions, new item types, and even slow degradation of load cell performance. The vigilance parameter within the ART network controls the sensitivity to novelty.

3.  **Anomaly Detection Layer:** An additional time-series anomaly detection model (Prophet, Kats, etc.) is applied *within each ART category*. This model learns the expected weight patterns *within* that specific category. Deviations from the expected pattern are flagged as potential anomalies.

4.  **Predictive Failure Modeling:**  Anomalies are not immediately interpreted as failures. Instead, a rolling window of anomaly scores is maintained for each load cell.  A separate machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest) is trained on this historical anomaly data to *predict* potential failures before they occur. The model incorporates features like anomaly rate, severity, duration, and time since last anomaly.

5.  **Mitigation Strategy:**  Predicted failures trigger a mitigation strategy (as in the original patent). The system can disregard data from the failing load cell, deactivate it, or generate a notification. Additionally, the system automatically adjusts the ART network vigilance and anomaly detection thresholds to minimize false positives and false negatives.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
# For each load cell:
art_network = ARTNetwork()
anomaly_detector = TimeSeriesAnomalyDetector()
failure_predictor = FailurePredictionModel()

while True:
    weight_data = get_weight_data()
    category = art_network.categorize(weight_data)
    anomaly_score = anomaly_detector.detect(weight_data, category)

    # Store anomaly score and other features in a rolling window
    anomaly_history.append((anomaly_score, ...))

    # Predict potential failure based on anomaly history
    failure_probability = failure_predictor.predict(anomaly_history)

    if failure_probability > threshold:
        trigger_mitigation_strategy()
```

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond simple statistical comparisons to a self-learning system that can adapt to complex operating conditions and predict failures *before* they occur. The combination of ART networks and time-series anomaly detection provides a more robust and accurate failure detection mechanism than traditional methods.  The integration of historical anomaly data into a predictive failure model allows for proactive maintenance and minimizes downtime.
