## Secure Data Shard Distribution with Ephemeral Key Exchange

**Concept:** Expand on the secure transport idea, but instead of moving *all* the data at once, break it into shards, distribute those shards across multiple independent, geographically diverse "edge nodes", and reconstruct only when absolutely necessary.  Focus on minimizing the exposure window of the full dataset and tying key exchange to a time-limited 'proof of existence' verification.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sharding & Redundancy:**

*   **Sharding Algorithm:** Implement a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing) to divide the data into *n* shards.  The data is *not* recoverable with fewer than *k* shards (k < n).
*   **Redundancy:**  Create *m* redundant shards in addition to the *n* base shards.  This allows for tolerance of node failures (up to *m* failures).
*   **Shard Size:** Dynamically adjust shard size based on network bandwidth and latency to edge nodes.  Target: 100MB - 1GB per shard.
*   **Hashing:** Each shard is cryptographically hashed using SHA-256. These hashes are publicly available.

**2. Edge Node Network:**

*   **Deployment:** Establish a network of geographically diverse edge nodes (servers, potentially even robust IoT devices). Nodes operate autonomously.
*   **Node Identification:** Each node possesses a unique, cryptographically verifiable identity.
*   **Storage:** Each node stores a random subset of the data shards and associated metadata (shard ID, hash).
*   **Availability:** Target 99.99% uptime for the network.

**3. Key Management & Exchange:**

*   **Ephemeral Key Generation:**  A new symmetric encryption key is generated *for each reconstruction request*.
*   **Proof of Existence:** The requestor creates a digitally signed "Proof of Existence" (PoE) document. The PoE includes:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Requestor Identity
    *   List of required shard IDs
    *   Hash of the *encrypted* reconstruction key.  (Key itself is *not* transmitted)
*   **Shard Request & Verification:** The requestor sends the PoE to a designated "coordinator" node. The coordinator node:
    *   Verifies the requestor's signature and identity.
    *   Validates that the requested shard IDs are within the network.
    *   Requests the shards from the respective edge nodes.
*   **Decryption Key Exchange:** Each edge node, upon receiving a shard request (with accompanying PoE), performs the following:
    *   Verifies the PoE.
    *   If valid, encrypts the shard using a derived key generated from:
        *   The shard ID
        *   A node-specific secret key.
        *   A time-based component.
    *   Returns the encrypted shard.
*   **Reconstruction:** The coordinator node receives the encrypted shards. Using the original requestor’s provided hash, it verifies the integrity of the recovered encrypted dataset. The coordinator decrypts the data using the original encryption key.

**4. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```pseudocode
// Edge Node
function handleShardRequest(request, shardID, nodeSecret):
  if verifyPoE(request):
    encryptedShard = encrypt(getShard(shardID), deriveKey(shardID, nodeSecret, currentTime))
    return encryptedShard
  else:
    return error("Invalid PoE")

// Coordinator Node
function reconstructData(requestorID, shardIDs):
  if verifyRequestor(requestorID):
    encryptedShards = requestShards(shardIDs)
    if verifyShards(encryptedShards):
        decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedShards, originalKey)
        return decryptedData
    else:
        return error("Shard verification failed")
  else:
    return error("Invalid requestor")
```

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   **Node Compromise:**  Even if a node is compromised, it only holds a subset of the data and cannot reconstruct it without *k* shards.
*   **Time-Limited Access:** The time component in the key derivation ensures that even if a shard is intercepted, it’s only useful for a limited time window.
*   **PoE Verification:** Prevents unauthorized requests and ensures accountability.
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** Data is encrypted at the source and decrypted only at the destination.
*   **Regular Key Rotation:** Rotate node secret keys periodically.
