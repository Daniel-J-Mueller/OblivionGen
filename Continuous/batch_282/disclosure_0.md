## Dynamic Sensory Notification System

**System Overview:** A system that leverages mobile device multimedia messaging capabilities to deliver notifications not just with visual or auditory cues, but with *haptic* and *olfactory* feedback tailored to the notification content. It expands on the idea of customized content to encompass a broader range of sensory experiences.

**Core Components:**

*   **Sensory Profile Database:** A cloud-based database linking notification categories (e.g., weather alerts, social media updates, calendar events, financial transactions) to specific haptic patterns and scent profiles.
*   **Mobile Device Integration Module:** Software on the mobile device that interacts with the operating system's notification system and controls connected peripherals.
*   **Haptic Peripheral:** A small, wearable device (e.g., wristband, ring) capable of producing a wide range of precise vibrations and tactile sensations.
*   **Olfactory Peripheral:** A miniature scent diffuser capable of releasing pre-programmed scent cartridges. (Initially, scent selection would be limited, expanding over time).
*   **Notification Processing Engine:**  Analyzes incoming notifications, categorizes them, and selects the appropriate sensory output based on the user's preferences and the notification content.
*   **User Preference Manager:** Allows users to customize sensory profiles for different notification categories and control the intensity of each sensory output.

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Notification Interception:** The Mobile Device Integration Module intercepts incoming notifications from apps and the operating system.

2.  **Content Analysis:** The Notification Processing Engine analyzes the notification content to determine its category and relevant details.

3.  **Sensory Profile Selection:** Based on the category and user preferences, the system retrieves the corresponding haptic pattern and scent profile from the Sensory Profile Database.

4.  **Peripheral Control:** The system sends commands to the Haptic Peripheral and Olfactory Peripheral to produce the selected sensory output.  
    *   **Haptic Output:**  Patterns range from simple vibrations to complex sequences mimicking textures, shapes, or even directional cues (e.g., a "ripple" effect for a water-related alert).
    *   **Olfactory Output:**  Scents are carefully selected to complement the notification content (e.g., coffee scent for a morning news update, fresh grass scent for a weather alert).

5.  **User Feedback Loop:** The User Preference Manager allows users to adjust sensory profiles, providing feedback that is used to refine the system's algorithms and personalize the experience.

**Pseudocode (Notification Processing Engine):**

```
function ProcessNotification(notification) {
    category = AnalyzeNotificationCategory(notification);
    userPreferences = GetUserPreferences(category);

    hapticPattern = userPreferences.hapticPattern;
    scentProfile = userPreferences.scentProfile;

    if (hapticPattern != null) {
        SendHapticCommand(hapticPattern);
    }

    if (scentProfile != null) {
        SendScentCommand(scentProfile);
    }
}

function AnalyzeNotificationCategory(notification) {
    // Implement logic to categorize notifications based on content.
    // Example:
    if (notification.app == "Weather") {
        return "Weather";
    } else if (notification.title contains "New Message") {
        return "Social Media";
    } else {
        return "Generic";
    }
}

function GetUserPreferences(category) {
    // Retrieve user preferences for the given category from the database.
    // Example:
    preferences = database.query("SELECT hapticPattern, scentProfile FROM userPreferences WHERE category = " + category);
    return preferences;
}

function SendHapticCommand(pattern) {
    // Send command to haptic peripheral to produce the specified pattern.
}

function SendScentCommand(profile) {
    // Send command to olfactory peripheral to release the specified scent.
}
```

**Expansion Considerations:**

*   **Biometric Integration:**  Integrate with biometric sensors to adjust sensory output based on the user's emotional state.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Leverage location data and environmental sensors to tailor sensory experiences to the user's surroundings.
*   **AI-Powered Sensory Generation:**  Use AI algorithms to dynamically generate haptic and olfactory patterns based on the notification content, creating a truly personalized and immersive experience.
*   **Scent Cartridge Subscription Service:**  Offer a subscription service for new scent cartridges, keeping the experience fresh and engaging.
