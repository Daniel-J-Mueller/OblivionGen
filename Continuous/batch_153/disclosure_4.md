## Modular Robotic Accessory System

**Concept:** Expand the weight-sensing bracket system into a fully modular robotic accessory platform. Instead of static accessories, integrate small, wirelessly controlled robotic actuators and sensors directly into the brackets and accessories.

**Specifications:**

*   **Bracket Redesign:** Each bracket will house a miniature, low-power microcontroller (ESP32 or similar) and a wireless communication module (Bluetooth Low Energy or Wi-Fi). Brackets include integrated power rails and data connectors.
*   **Actuator Modules:** Standardized 'Actuator Modules' will be developed. These modules consist of miniature motors (stepper or servo), gears, and encoders, all encased in a protective housing with a standardized mounting interface compatible with the brackets. Modules will include:
    *   **Rotation Module:**  For rotating accessories (e.g., a display screen, a price tag).
    *   **Linear Actuator Module:** For pushing/pulling accessories (e.g., extending a shelf, deploying a grabber).
    *   **Gripper Module:** Small, precision grippers for picking up individual items.
*   **Sensor Modules:** Standardized sensor modules to add functionality:
    *   **Proximity Sensor:** Detects the presence of objects.
    *   **Color Sensor:** Identifies the color of items.
    *   **RFID Reader:** Reads RFID tags on products.
    *   **Camera Module:** Small, low-resolution camera for image recognition.
*   **Accessory Interface:**  Accessories will have a standardized mounting interface that allows them to connect securely to the robotic brackets. This interface includes power and data connections.
*   **Control System:** A central control system (cloud-based or local server) will manage the robotic system.  This system will:
    *   Receive weight data from the load cells.
    *   Control the robotic actuators.
    *   Process sensor data.
    *   Provide a user interface for controlling the system (mobile app, web dashboard).
*   **Power Supply:** Brackets will be powered via a central power supply distributed through the shelving system. Wireless power transfer may also be considered.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Bracket Firmware:** Controls the onboard microcontroller, manages wireless communication, and interfaces with the load cell.
    *   **Control System Software:**  Provides a user interface for controlling the system, managing accessories, and processing data.
    *   **API:** Open API for third-party developers to create custom accessories and applications.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Read weight data from all brackets
    weightData = readWeightData();

    // Read sensor data from all sensors
    sensorData = readSensorData();

    // Process data (e.g., identify low stock items, detect anomalies)
    processedData = processData(weightData, sensorData);

    // Adjust accessory positions based on processed data
    adjustAccessories(processedData);

    // Update user interface
    updateUI();

    // Wait for next iteration
    wait(100ms);
}

// adjustAccessories function:
function adjustAccessories(data) {
    for each accessory in accessories {
        if (data.lowStock(accessory)) {
            moveAccessory(accessory, "forward", 10); // Move forward to attract attention
        }
        if (data.anomalyDetected(accessory)) {
            rotateAccessory(accessory, 90); // Rotate to indicate anomaly
        }
    }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Shelving:** Automatically adjust shelf positions to optimize space utilization.
*   **Interactive Displays:** Rotate or move displays to attract customer attention.
*   **Automated Replenishment:**  Automatically order new stock when items run low.
*   **Anti-Theft System:** Detect and alert personnel when items are removed without authorization.
*   **Personalized Shopping Experience:**  Display targeted promotions based on customer preferences.
