## Inventory Resonance & Harmonic Sorting

**Concept:** Utilizing precisely controlled vibrational frequencies to sort and position inventory items *within* the holder, without relying solely on gross mobile unit movements. This builds on the idea of 'jostling' from claim 17, but moves beyond simple shaking and into a more nuanced, targeted system.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Acoustic Emission Sensors:** Array of micro-sensors embedded within the inventory holder base, capable of detecting subtle variations in sound produced by individual items (material, shape, size). These establish baseline 'acoustic signatures'.
    *   **Capacitive Proximity Sensors:** Dense grid of sensors detecting item positions and proximity to each other within the holder. Provides 'shape' of inventory load.
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Tracks holder orientation, acceleration, and deceleration. Essential for frequency calibration.
*   **Actuator Array:**
    *   **Piezoelectric Transducers:**  Array of individually controlled piezoelectric transducers mounted on the inventory holder base. These generate localized vibrations. (Minimum density: 1 transducer per 100cm^2 of base area).
    *   **Electromagnetic Coil System:** Optional addition. Array of small, individually controlled electromagnets. Used *in conjunction* with items possessing ferromagnetic properties.
*   **Processing Unit (Embedded):**
    *   **Algorithm:** ‘Resonance Mapping & Sorting’.
        1.  **Baseline Acquisition:** System scans inventory upon loading, establishing acoustic signatures and a 3D position map using sensor data.
        2.  **Target Definition:** User (or automated system) specifies a desired final arrangement of items. (e.g., ‘group all red items together’, ‘place fragile items on top’).
        3.  **Frequency Calculation:** Algorithm calculates optimal vibration frequencies for *each* item based on its acoustic signature, mass, shape, and desired target position. Utilizes Finite Element Analysis to model vibrational response.
        4.  **Localized Vibration Emission:**  Piezoelectric transducers emit calculated frequencies, creating localized resonant vibrations. These vibrations ‘push’ items towards their target positions.
        5.  **Feedback Loop:** Sensor data continuously monitors item positions. Algorithm adjusts frequencies in real-time to refine sorting accuracy.
        6.  **Electromagnetic Assistance (Optional):**  For ferromagnetic items, electromagnets provide additional directional force.
*   **Power Requirements:** 24V DC, 5A (peak during transducer activation)
*   **Communication:** Wireless (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) for control and data logging.
*   **Materials:** Inventory Holder Base – Lightweight, high-strength aluminum alloy. Transducer Mounting – Dampening polymer to minimize noise.

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION SortInventory(inventoryData, targetArrangement):
  FOR each item IN inventoryData:
    itemSignature = AnalyzeAcousticSignature(item)
    targetPosition = GetTargetPosition(item, targetArrangement)
    frequencyMap = CalculateResonanceFrequency(itemSignature, targetPosition)
    ActivateTransducers(frequencyMap)
  END FOR
  WHILE Not InventorySorted():
    sensorData = ReadSensorData()
    error = CalculatePositionError(sensorData)
    adjustmentMap = GenerateAdjustmentMap(error)
    AdjustTransducers(adjustmentMap)
  END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple motion-based shifting and leverages the physics of resonance to achieve precise inventory manipulation. It’s potentially faster, gentler (important for fragile items), and more energy-efficient than traditional methods.  The dynamic feedback loop and individualized frequency mapping represent a significant advancement. It’s a ‘surgical’ approach to inventory sorting, versus a ‘brute force’ one.
