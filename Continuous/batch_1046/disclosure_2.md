## Modular, Self-Organizing Cable Infrastructure

**Concept:** Expand beyond fixed elongated openings to a dynamically reconfigurable cable pathway system *within* the chassis, allowing cables to self-organize and adapt to component rearrangement or hot-swap operations *without* manual intervention.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Cable Nodes" â€“ small, magnetically attached modules containing micro-servo motors and short cable segments. Nodes connect end-to-end forming a mesh network throughout the chassis.
*   **Node Connectivity:** Each node has multiple connection points (minimum 4) allowing branching and redundant pathways. Connection points are standardized, low-friction interfaces.
*   **Cable Integration:** Cables are not directly attached to components but to cable nodes. Nodes pass the signal along the network.
*   **Chassis Integration:** Chassis interior surfaces have a matrix of weak magnetic points allowing nodes to be positioned almost anywhere.
*   **Control System:** A centralized control unit (or distributed network of microcontrollers) monitors cable stress and directs node movement to optimize cable routing.
*   **Power/Data Transmission:** Nodes themselves require minimal power. Power and data are carried *through* the cable network, with nodes acting as signal repeaters.
*   **Software Interface:** A GUI allows operators to visualize the cable network, monitor stress, and manually override automatic routing.
*   **Redundancy:**  Multiple pathways are established for critical connections. If a node fails or a cable is damaged, the system automatically reroutes signals.

**Pseudocode (Routing Algorithm):**

```
function routeCable(sourceNode, destinationNode, cableType) {
  // Initialize pathfinding data
  distance = {}
  previous = {}
  queue = []

  // Set initial distance for source node to 0
  distance[sourceNode] = 0
  queue.append(sourceNode)

  while (queue is not empty) {
    currentNode = queue.pop(0)

    for (neighbor in currentNode.neighbors) {
      if (neighbor is not visited) {
        // Check if cable type is compatible with link
        if (link.cableType == cableType) {
          alt = distance[currentNode] + link.weight // Weight represents latency/resistance
          if (alt < distance[neighbor] or distance[neighbor] is null) {
            distance[neighbor] = alt
            previous[neighbor] = currentNode
            queue.append(neighbor)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Reconstruct path
  path = []
  currentNode = destinationNode
  while (currentNode is not null) {
    path.insert(0, currentNode)
    currentNode = previous[currentNode]
  }

  return path
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Node size should be minimized to maximize chassis space.
*   Magnetic attachment strength must balance secure holding with easy repositioning.
*   Software should include fault detection and self-repair mechanisms.
*   Power management is crucial to minimize energy consumption.
*   Consider using a mesh network topology for increased robustness.
