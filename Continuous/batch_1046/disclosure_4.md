## Dynamic Aisle Zoning with Predictive Human Pathing

**Concept:** Extend the safety system beyond reactive pausing of shuttles to *proactively* shape the aisle environment based on predicted human movement, creating temporary ‘flow fields’ that guide both humans and shuttles.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Existing Overhead Cameras (as per patent): Maintain function for immediate human detection & restricted zone creation.
    *   Depth Sensors (Time-of-Flight or Stereo Vision): Integrated into overhead camera housings to provide 3D skeletal tracking of detected humans. Resolution: 0.1m accuracy at 5m range. Field of View: 90 degrees.
    *   Floor-Level LiDAR Scanners: Strategically positioned along aisle length. Purpose: Detect stationary objects & refine human path prediction, especially in cluttered areas. Range: 10m. Resolution: 5cm.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Human Path Prediction Module:** Utilizing skeletal tracking data (from depth sensors) and LiDAR scans, predict human trajectory over the next 5-10 seconds. Algorithm: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on historical movement data within the sortation facility. Output: Probability map indicating likely human location at future time steps.
    *   **Dynamic Zoning Module:** Based on predicted human path, dynamically adjust aisle zoning in real-time. This includes:
        *   **Restricted Zones:** (As defined in patent) – immediate halting of shuttles.
        *   **Slow Zones:** Reduction of shuttle speed.
        *   **Guidance Zones:** Visually highlighted pathways (using LED strips embedded in the floor) that *encourage* both humans and shuttles to move in a coordinated manner. Color Coding: Green (safe/normal speed), Yellow (caution/slow down), Red (restricted).
        *   **Virtual Barriers:** Projected light patterns on the floor to create temporary, visual obstacles that direct human movement.
    *   **Shuttle Path Planning Module:** Integrates dynamic zoning information into shuttle path planning algorithms. Prioritizes paths that avoid restricted zones *and* leverage guidance zones for smoother operation.
    *   **Central Control System:** Orchestrates all modules and manages communication between sensors, shuttles, and the dynamic zoning system.

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   LED Strip Lighting: Addressable RGB LED strips embedded in the aisle flooring. Density: 50 LEDs/meter.
    *   Projectors: Short-throw projectors mounted on overhead structures to create virtual barriers. Resolution: 1920x1080. Brightness: 500 lumens.
    *   High-Performance Computing (HPC): Dedicated server cluster for running path prediction algorithms and managing the dynamic zoning system.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Zoning Module):**

```
function updateZoning(humanPathPrediction, currentShuttlePositions):
    # Create empty zoning map
    zoningMap = {}

    # For each predicted human location:
    for location in humanPathPrediction:
        # Define a safety radius around the location
        safetyRadius = 1.5 meters

        # Create a restricted zone within the safety radius
        zoningMap[location] = "Restricted"

        # Determine adjacent zones based on predicted movement
        predictedMovement = getPredictedMovement(location)
        if predictedMovement == "Walking":
            # Create a slow zone ahead of the human
            zoningMap[getNextLocation(location, 3)] = "Slow"
            # Create a guidance zone along the predicted path
            guidancePath = getGuidancePath(location, 10)
            for pathPoint in guidancePath:
                zoningMap[pathPoint] = "Guidance"
        elif predictedMovement == "Stationary":
            #Increase restricted zone radius

    #For each shuttle position
    for shuttle in shuttlePositions:
        #Adjust path if in restricted zone
        adjustPath(shuttle)

    # Output the zoning map to the shuttle path planning module and LED control system
    return zoningMap
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive safety to *proactive* guidance, shaping the environment to facilitate safe and efficient interaction between humans and automated systems. Integrates predictive modeling with real-time zoning adjustments, creating a more flexible and intelligent sortation system.
