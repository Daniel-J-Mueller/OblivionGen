## Dynamic Viewability Heatmaps & Predictive Rendering

**Concept:** Instead of simply detecting if an ad *is* viewable, dynamically generate a "heat map" of viewability *potential* across a webpage, predicting areas most likely to be seen *before* rendering fully, and prioritizing rendering resources accordingly. This moves beyond post-hoc detection towards proactive optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Viewability Engine (PVE)**
    *   Input: Webpage HTML/CSS, User Agent Profile (device type, screen size, typical usage patterns - anonymized and aggregated data).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Static Analysis:**  Parse HTML/CSS to construct a Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
        2.  **Viewport Simulation:**  Simulate rendering across multiple viewport sizes and orientations (based on UA profile).
        3.  **Attention Modeling:** Employ a lightweight AI model (pre-trained, potentially a simplified convolutional neural network) to estimate "attention weight" for each element based on:
            *   Element size & position
            *   Proximity to viewport center
            *   Contrast against background
            *   Text readability (font size, color)
            *   Animation/motion characteristics
        4.  **Heatmap Generation:**  Generate a 2D heatmap overlay representing predicted viewability probability for each element. Higher values indicate higher probability of being viewed.
    *   Output: Heatmap data (array of probabilities aligned to DOM structure).

*   **Component 2: Resource Prioritization Module (RPM)**
    *   Input: Heatmap data, Webpage Resources (images, scripts, videos, etc.), User Bandwidth Estimate (obtained via network monitoring).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Resource Assignment:** Assign a "priority score" to each resource based on the corresponding DOM elementâ€™s heatmap value.
        2.  **Dynamic Queueing:** Maintain a prioritized queue of resources for rendering.  Resources with higher priority scores are rendered first.
        3.  **Adaptive Quality:**  Adjust resource quality (image resolution, video bitrate) based on priority score and available bandwidth.  High-priority resources receive the highest quality.
        4.  **Progressive Rendering:** Begin rendering high-priority areas immediately, even before the entire webpage has loaded.
    *   Output: Rendered webpage with prioritized resource loading and adaptive quality.

*   **Component 3:  Viewability Feedback Loop (VFL)**
    *   Input: Actual viewability data (captured via existing viewability detection methods - as a *validation* point), User Interaction data (scroll position, mouse movements, clicks).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Model Refinement:**  Use the actual viewability data and user interactions to refine the attention model in the PVE. This is a continuous learning process.
        2.  **Heatmap Calibration:**  Calibrate the generated heatmaps to improve prediction accuracy.
        3.  **Personalized Viewability:** Adapt the attention model to individual user preferences (based on anonymized browsing history).
    *   Output: Improved attention model and calibrated heatmaps.

**Pseudocode (Simplified RPM):**

```
function prioritizeResources(heatmapData, resources):
    priorityQueue = []
    for resource in resources:
        elementId = resource.elementId
        priorityScore = heatmapData[elementId]  # Get heatmap value
        priorityQueue.append((priorityScore, resource))

    priorityQueue.sort(reverse=True) # Sort by priority score
    return priorityQueue

function renderResources(prioritizedQueue, bandwidth):
    for (priority, resource) in prioritizedQueue:
        if bandwidth > resource.size:
            renderResource(resource, quality=High)
            bandwidth -= resource.size
        else:
            renderResource(resource, quality=Low)
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond simply *detecting* viewability to *predicting* it, allowing for proactive optimization of rendering resources. This is particularly relevant for bandwidth-constrained devices or users, as it ensures that the most important content is rendered first, improving user experience. The feedback loop enables personalized viewability optimization.
