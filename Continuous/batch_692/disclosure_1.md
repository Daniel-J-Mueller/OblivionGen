## Decentralized Key Derivation with Biometric Attestation

**Concept:** Leverage the secure hardware described in the patent (HSM-like cryptographic computing device) not just for encryption/decryption, but as a decentralized key derivation function (KDF) tied to biometric authentication. This enables highly secure, auditable, and revocable access to data *without* central key management.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Utilize the tamper-protected cryptographic computing device described in the patent as a "Biometric Attestation Node" (BAN). Each BAN contains a unique, non-exportable key pair.
*   **Biometric Enrollment:** User enrolls biometric data (fingerprint, facial scan, etc.) with a designated BAN. The biometric data *is not stored* on the BAN. Instead, a cryptographic challenge-response mechanism is established, verifying the biometric without retaining the raw data. The challenge and response are linked to the BANâ€™s unique key pair.
*   **Key Derivation Process:**
    1.  Client requests access to encrypted data.
    2.  Client initiates biometric authentication with a chosen BAN.
    3.  BAN presents a challenge to the client's biometric sensor.
    4.  Client's biometric sensor captures data and generates a response.
    5.  BAN verifies the biometric response. If successful:
        *   BAN generates a unique, ephemeral key.
        *   BAN signs the ephemeral key with its private key.
        *   Signed ephemeral key is sent to the client.
    6.  Client uses the signed ephemeral key to derive a data encryption key (DEK) using a robust KDF (e.g., HKDF).
    7.  Client uses the DEK to decrypt the data.
*   **Revocation:** If a biometric is compromised or access needs to be revoked, the corresponding BAN is deactivated. All previously derived keys become invalid.
*   **Auditing:** Every key derivation event is logged on the BAN (timestamp, client identifier, data identifier). This provides a complete audit trail.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation on Client Side):**

```
function derive_dek(signed_ephemeral_key, data_identifier):
    // Verify signature on ephemeral key using BAN's public key (pre-registered)
    if signature_verification_failed(signed_ephemeral_key):
        return error("Invalid signature")

    ephemeral_key = extract_ephemeral_key(signed_ephemeral_key)

    //Apply KDF to ephemeral_key + data_identifier
    dek = kdf(ephemeral_key, data_identifier)

    return dek
```

**Data Format (Signed Ephemeral Key):**

```
{
  "signature": "...",       // Digital signature (e.g., ECDSA)
  "ephemeral_key": "...",   // Ephemeral public key
  "ban_identifier": "..."   // Unique ID of the Biometric Attestation Node
}
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Factor Attestation:** Combine biometric authentication with other factors (e.g., device attestation, location).
*   **Threshold Cryptography:** Require multiple BANs to participate in key derivation, enhancing security and availability.
*   **Decentralized Identity:** Integrate with decentralized identity systems (e.g., DID) for enhanced user control and privacy.
*   **Proxy BANs:** Allow authorized proxies to perform biometric attestation on behalf of users.
