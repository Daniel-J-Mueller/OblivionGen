## Dynamic Contextual Message Prioritization & Synthesis

**Concept:** Expand on the prioritization of messages based on sender/recipient, but move beyond simple time-based proximity. Introduce dynamic contextual synthesis to *create* new messages – short summaries, action items, or confirmations – *before* playback, based on message content and inferred user intent.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw message data (text, metadata – sender, recipient, timestamp).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Entity Recognition:** Identify key entities within messages (dates, times, locations, people, tasks, items).
    *   **Intent Inference:** Utilize a pre-trained (or dynamically trained) NLP model to determine the *likely* intent behind each message. Examples: Request for information, task assignment, confirmation of appointment, expression of sentiment.
    *   **Relationship Mapping:**  Establish relationships between entities identified in multiple messages. (e.g., "John needs the report by Friday" + "Friday is tomorrow" ->  "John needs the report tomorrow").
*   **Output:**  Structured data representing entities, intents, and relationships.

**2. Synthesis Engine:**

*   **Input:** Structured data from the Contextual Analysis Module.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Action Item Detection:** Identify potential action items based on intent and entities. (e.g., Intent = "Request", Entity = "Document" -> Action: "Locate/Send Document").
    *   **Confirmation Generation:** If a message implies a commitment, generate a brief confirmation message. (e.g., "I'll be there at 2" -> "Confirmation sent: Meeting at 2").
    *   **Summary Creation:**  For long message chains, generate a concise summary of the key points.
    *   **Contextual Message Sequencing:** Rearrange the order of messages based on inferred user intent. Prioritize messages requiring immediate action or those related to current events.
*   **Output:**  A set of synthetic messages and a prioritized message sequence.

**3. Playback Controller:**

*   **Input:** Prioritized message sequence and synthetic messages.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Interleaving:**  Interleave synthetic messages into the message sequence, presenting them *before* the original messages they relate to.
    *   **Adaptive Playback Speed:** Adjust playback speed based on message complexity and user engagement (detected via audio input).
    *   **Contextual Highlighting:** Visually highlight key entities and action items during playback.
*   **Output:**  Audible and/or visual message playback.

**Pseudocode (Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesize_messages(message_data):
  synthetic_messages = []
  for message in message_data:
    intent = analyze_intent(message.text)
    if intent == "request":
      action_item = generate_action_item(message.text)
      synthetic_messages.append(action_item)
    if intent == "commitment":
      confirmation = generate_confirmation(message.text)
      synthetic_messages.append(confirmation)
  return synthetic_messages
```

**Novelty:** This isn’t just prioritization; it's *proactive message augmentation*. The system doesn't just decide *which* messages to play first, but *creates* new, contextually relevant messages to enhance understanding and drive action. It simulates a human assistant who anticipates your needs and provides just-in-time information.  This goes beyond simply sequencing existing data, and leverages generative AI to provide a wholly new experience.
