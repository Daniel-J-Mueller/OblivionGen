**Dynamic Composition Guides via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

**Concept:** Expand upon the image scoring system by providing *active* compositional guidance to the user *during* image capture or editing, rather than simply scoring a finished image. Leverage GANs to generate ideal compositions based on the item description and a live camera feed/image editor canvas.

**Specs:**

1.  **GAN Training Data:** Utilize the existing scored image dataset (high/low quality, reason codes) *and* augment it with synthetically generated images. Synthetic data will be created by algorithmically varying compositional elements (rule of thirds, leading lines, symmetry, etc.) while maintaining a consistent subject and item description.

2.  **Input:**
    *   Item Description (text).
    *   Live Camera Feed (or image editor canvas).
    *   User preferences (optional – e.g., preferred color palettes, shooting style).

3.  **GAN Architecture:** Two-part system:
    *   *Generator*:  Takes item description & live feed as input, outputs a “composition mask” – a semi-transparent overlay on the live feed/canvas indicating ideal object placement, framing, and compositional elements. This mask isn't a literal rendering, but a guide. Think subtle highlight areas, suggested lines, etc.
    *   *Discriminator*: Evaluates the combined result (live feed + composition mask) against the training data (high-quality images + item descriptions), providing feedback to refine the generator’s output.

4.  **Real-time Operation:**
    *   The GAN runs in real-time (or near real-time) on a mobile device or server.
    *   The composition mask is overlaid on the live feed/canvas, providing the user with immediate visual feedback.
    *   The user can adjust the composition based on the mask, or ignore it.

5.  **User Interface:**
    *   A toggle to enable/disable the composition guide.
    *   Sliders to adjust the ‘strength’ of the guide (how prominent the mask is).
    *   Options to customize the guide (e.g., focus on specific compositional rules).

6.  **Scoring Integration:** The existing image scoring system continues to run in the background, providing a quantitative assessment of the user's composition.  The GAN acts as a proactive assistant, guiding the user *before* the scoring happens.

7.  **Pseudocode (simplified):**

    ```
    function generate_composition_guide(item_description, live_feed):
        generator = load_generator_model()
        discriminator = load_discriminator_model()
        
        composition_mask = generator.predict(item_description, live_feed)
        
        # Evaluate generated mask with discriminator
        score = discriminator.predict(live_feed + composition_mask, item_description)
        
        # Refine generator based on discriminator score (reinforcement learning loop)
        
        return composition_mask
    ```

8.  **Advanced Feature – Style Transfer:**  Integrate style transfer techniques to suggest visual aesthetics that align with the item description and user preferences.  For example, if the item description is "rustic farmhouse," the GAN could suggest warm color palettes and textures.
