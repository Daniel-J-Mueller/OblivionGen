## Dynamic Content 'Mood' Adjustment via Multi-Modal Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the supplemental content retrieval system to proactively adjust content delivery based on inferred 'mood' or emotional tone, derived from a combination of content metadata *and* real-time user interaction signals. This goes beyond categorization; it's about dynamic emotional resonance.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Sensor Suite (MSS):**
    *   **Content Analysis Module:** Analyzes incoming supplemental content (text, images, video) using:
        *   Sentiment Analysis (text)
        *   Emotion Recognition (image/video - facial expression, scene analysis)
        *   Keyword/Topic Extraction
    *   **User Interaction Monitor (UIM):** Captures user signals:
        *   Keystroke Dynamics (typing speed, error rate)
        *   Mouse/Touch Movement (speed, pressure, patterns)
        *   Scroll Speed/Depth
        *   Dwell Time on Content
        *   Facial Expression (via webcam - optional, requires user consent)
        *   Voice Analysis (tone, pitch, pace – via microphone – optional, requires user consent)
2.  **Mood Inference Engine (MIE):**
    *   Combines data from MSS.
    *   Uses a weighted algorithm or machine learning model (trained on large datasets of emotional responses) to infer the user’s current mood (e.g., happy, sad, anxious, frustrated, neutral).
    *   Provides a mood score (numerical representation of emotional state).
3.  **Content Modulation Module (CMM):**
    *   Receives mood score from MIE.
    *   Selects supplemental content from the retrieval system based on:
        *   **Mood-Aligned Content:** Prioritizes content with emotional tone that matches or complements the user’s mood. (e.g., If user is sad, offer comforting content. If user is energetic, offer upbeat content).
        *   **Mood-Shifting Content:**  Offers content designed to subtly shift the user’s mood (e.g., If user is anxious, offer calming content).
        *   **Content Variety Balance:** Maintains a balance between mood-aligned and mood-shifting content to avoid creating an echo chamber.
    *   Adjusts content presentation:
        *   Color Palettes
        *   Font Styles
        *   Image/Video Transitions
        *   Background Music/Sound Effects
4.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitors user engagement (clicks, shares, time spent) with modulated content.
    *   Uses this data to refine the weighting algorithms and machine learning models within the MIE and CMM.

**II. Pseudocode (CMM – Content Selection)**

```
FUNCTION SelectContent(moodScore, contentPool, contentPreferences)

  // Define mood categories and corresponding content filters
  IF moodScore > 0.7 THEN
    moodCategory = "Happy"
    contentFilter = "Upbeat, Positive"
  ELSE IF moodScore < -0.7 THEN
    moodCategory = "Sad"
    contentFilter = "Comforting, Empathetic"
  ELSE IF moodScore BETWEEN -0.3 AND 0.3 THEN
    moodCategory = "Neutral"
    contentFilter = "Informative, Engaging"
  ELSE
    moodCategory = "Ambivalent"
    contentFilter = "Mixed, Varied"

  // Filter content pool based on mood category and user preferences
  filteredContent = Filter(contentPool, moodCategory, userPreferences)

  // Select a variety of content items
  selectedContent = SelectRandom(filteredContent, 5) // Select 5 items

  // Adjust content presentation (example: color palette)
  IF moodCategory == "Happy" THEN
    colorPalette = "Bright, Vibrant"
  ELSE IF moodCategory == "Sad" THEN
    colorPalette = "Muted, Soothing"

  RETURN selectedContent, colorPalette
```
