## Adaptive Kernel Morphing via Generative Feedback

**Core Concept:** Extend the kernel calibration process beyond *selection* of a pre-defined kernel, towards *morphing* a base kernel based on real-time decoding feedback, using a small generative network.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Base Kernel Library:** Maintain a library of approximately 16-32 base deblur kernels, similar to those described implicitly in the patent, each characterized by signal-to-noise ratio and diameter. These act as 'seeds' for morphing.

2.  **Morphing Network:** Implement a small, lightweight generative neural network (GNN) with the following architecture:
    *   **Input:** A base kernel (flattened representation) + Decoding Confidence Score (0-1).
    *   **Layers:** 2-3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by a final convolutional layer to output kernel offsets.
    *   **Output:** A set of offsets â€“ small adjustments to the weights of the base kernel.

3.  **Decoding Confidence Score:**  Instead of simple success/failure of decoding, introduce a 'Decoding Confidence Score' (DCS). This represents the strength of the decoding signal (e.g., from an OCR system, object detection network).  This provides a more granular feedback signal than a binary result.

4.  **Real-Time Morphing Loop:**
    *   **Initialization:** Select a base kernel from the library based on the initial ranking (as in the patent).
    *   **Processing:** Apply the current kernel to the input image.
    *   **Decoding & Scoring:**  Run a decoding process (OCR, object detection) and obtain the DCS.
    *   **Morphing:**  Feed the base kernel and DCS into the GNN. The GNN outputs kernel offsets. Apply these offsets to the base kernel, creating a morphed kernel.
    *   **Iteration:** Repeat steps 4.2-4.5 for a fixed number of iterations or until the DCS reaches a threshold.
    *   **Kernel Library Update:** Periodically, save successful morphed kernels to the base kernel library, weighted by their performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
base_kernels = load_base_kernels()
ranking = compute_initial_ranking(base_kernels)

function process_image(input_image):
    best_kernel = select_kernel(ranking)
    current_kernel = best_kernel

    for i in range(max_iterations):
        processed_image = apply_kernel(input_image, current_kernel)
        dcs = decode_and_score(processed_image)

        if dcs > threshold:
            return processed_image

        kernel_offsets = morphing_network(current_kernel, dcs)
        current_kernel = current_kernel + kernel_offsets

    // If threshold not reached, return the best effort
    return processed_image

function update_kernel_library(successful_kernels):
    for kernel, score in successful_kernels:
        add_kernel_to_library(kernel, score)

```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Edge TPU or similar accelerated inference hardware to run the morphing network efficiently.
*   Sufficient RAM to store kernel data and intermediate results.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved deblurring performance, particularly in challenging scenarios.
*   Adaptability to varying image conditions and label types.
*   Potential for learning optimal kernel shapes directly from data.
