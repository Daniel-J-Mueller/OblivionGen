## Adaptive Content-Aware Scene Decomposition for Generative Encoding

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive encoding concept by *decomposing* scenes into layers based on motion and semantic content *before* encoding, allowing for targeted generative encoding parameters. This differs from simply adapting parameters per GOP â€“ we're creating discrete layers for manipulation.

**Specs:**

**1. Scene Decomposition Module:**

   *   **Input:** Raw video frames.
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Motion Estimation:** Optical flow analysis to identify regions of high and low motion. Utilize a dense optical flow algorithm for granular motion vectors.
        *   **Semantic Segmentation:** Employ a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., Mask R-CNN, DeepLab) to perform pixel-level semantic segmentation, identifying objects and regions (e.g., sky, buildings, people, vehicles).  
        *   **Layer Creation:** Based on motion and semantic data, create the following layers:
            *   **Static Layer:**  Pixels with low motion AND belonging to static semantic classes (e.g., buildings, landscapes).
            *   **Dynamic Foreground Layer:** Pixels with high motion AND belonging to foreground objects (e.g., people, vehicles).
            *   **Dynamic Background Layer:** Pixels with high motion AND belonging to background objects (e.g., waving trees, flowing water).
            *   **Alpha Mask Generation:** Create an alpha mask for each layer, defining the transparency and blending between layers.  This is critical for recombining the layers later.
   *   **Output:** A set of image layers (Static, Dynamic Foreground, Dynamic Background) and corresponding alpha masks.

**2. Generative Encoding Pipeline:**

   *   **Input:** Layered images and alpha masks.
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Layer-Specific Encoding:** Each layer is encoded *separately* using a video codec (e.g., H.266/VVC, AV1).
        *   **Encoding Parameter Adaptation:** Crucially, the encoding parameters for each layer are determined *independently* based on its content characteristics.
            *   **Static Layer:**  Prioritize high compression and minimal artifacts. Low bitrates, high quantization.
            *   **Dynamic Foreground Layer:** Prioritize motion fidelity and sharpness. Higher bitrates, lower quantization.  Employ motion-compensated prediction techniques aggressively.
            *   **Dynamic Background Layer:**  Balance compression and motion fidelity.  Medium bitrates and quantization. Utilize a hybrid approach.
        *   **Generative Encoding:** For each layer, implement a form of generative encoding. This could involve:
            *   **Neural Network-Assisted Frame Interpolation:** Use a trained neural network to generate intermediate frames within the layer, effectively increasing the frame rate and smoothness.
            *   **Super-Resolution:** Apply a super-resolution algorithm to upscale the layer, enhancing detail and visual quality.
            *   **Style Transfer:**  Apply a style transfer algorithm to subtly alter the aesthetic of the layer (e.g., cartoonize, enhance contrast).
   *   **Output:** Encoded layers and metadata describing the encoding parameters and generative enhancements.

**3. Recomposition Module:**

   *   **Input:** Encoded layers, metadata, and alpha masks.
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Layer Blending:** Recompose the layers using the alpha masks to create the final video frame.
        *   **Metadata Integration:** Integrate the encoding metadata to guide decoding and rendering.
   *   **Output:** Final reconstructed video.

**Pseudocode (Recomposition Module):**

```
function RecomposeFrame(EncodedStaticLayer, EncodedDynamicForegroundLayer, EncodedDynamicBackgroundLayer, AlphaMaskStatic, AlphaMaskDynamicForeground, AlphaMaskDynamicBackground):
    DecodedStatic = Decode(EncodedStaticLayer)
    DecodedDynamicForeground = Decode(EncodedDynamicForegroundLayer)
    DecodedDynamicBackground = Decode(EncodedDynamicBackgroundLayer)

    BlendedForeground =  Multiply(DecodedDynamicForeground, AlphaMaskDynamicForeground)
    BlendedBackground = Multiply(DecodedDynamicBackground, AlphaMaskDynamicBackground)

    FinalFrame = Add(DecodedStatic, Add(BlendedForeground, BlendedBackground))

    return FinalFrame
```

**Novelty:** This design goes beyond simple per-GOP adaptation.  By decomposing the scene into layers *before* encoding and applying layer-specific generative techniques, it enables a level of control and optimization that isn't possible with traditional methods.  It also opens the door to creative video manipulation and enhancement.
