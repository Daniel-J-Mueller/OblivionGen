## Dynamic Prosody Injection via Generative Adversarial Networks

**Concept:** Enhance the naturalness of generated speech by dynamically injecting prosodic features (pitch, rhythm, energy) learned from real speech recordings, *without* requiring parallel data.

**Specification:**

1.  **Prosody Extractor:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to extract a compact, multi-dimensional prosody vector from short segments (e.g., 0.5-1 second) of real speech. Input: raw waveform or spectrogram. Output: Prosody Vector (PV) – e.g., 64-dimensional.  This CNN is *not* designed to reconstruct the audio, but to distill prosodic information.
2.  **Prosody Generator (PG):** A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
    *   **Generator (G):** Takes as input: Phoneme embeddings (as in the provided patent), the predicted mel spectrogram frames, *and* a latent vector (z).  Outputs a predicted Prosody Vector (PV_pred).
    *   **Discriminator (D):** Takes as input:  Either a real Prosody Vector (from the Prosody Extractor) *or* the predicted Prosody Vector (PV_pred).  Outputs a probability score indicating the authenticity of the input.
    *   Training:  The PG is trained to generate PVs that are indistinguishable from real PVs, conditioned on the phoneme embeddings and mel spectrogram.
3.  **Prosody Injection Module:** This module takes the predicted mel spectrogram and the generated PV. It dynamically warps the mel spectrogram’s time-frequency representation *based* on the PV. This is achieved by:
    *   **Time Warping:** Apply a non-linear time scaling to the spectrogram, driven by the rhythm/tempo components of the PV.
    *   **Frequency Shifting:**  Apply subtle frequency shifts to the spectrogram, driven by the pitch/intonation components of the PV.
    *   **Energy Modulation:** Modulate the energy/amplitude of the spectrogram, driven by the energy/stress components of the PV.
4.  **Vocoder Integration:** The warped mel spectrogram is then fed into the vocoder (neural network-based as per the patent) to generate audio.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Training Phase

// 1. Train Prosody Extractor on large corpus of real speech
// 2. Train Prosody Generator (GAN):
    // For each batch:
        // Generate phoneme embeddings and mel spectrograms
        // Generate random latent vector z
        // Predict PV_pred = Generator(phoneme_embeddings, mel_spectrograms, z)
        // Calculate Discriminator Loss (D)
        // Calculate Generator Loss (G)
        // Update Discriminator Weights
        // Update Generator Weights

// Inference Phase

function generate_audio(text):
    phoneme_embeddings = generate_phoneme_embeddings(text)
    mel_spectrogram = acoustic_model(phoneme_embeddings)

    // Generate Prosody Vector
    latent_vector = sample_random_vector()
    prosody_vector = Generator(phoneme_embeddings, mel_spectrogram, latent_vector)

    // Warp Mel Spectrogram based on Prosody Vector
    warped_mel_spectrogram = warp_mel_spectrogram(mel_spectrogram, prosody_vector)

    // Generate Audio using Vocoder
    audio = vocoder(warped_mel_spectrogram)

    return audio
```

**Novelty:**

This approach differs from simply concatenating prosodic features. It *dynamically warps* the spectrogram, allowing for more nuanced and natural prosody control. The GAN ensures the generated prosody is realistic and diverse.  The use of a latent vector allows for stylistic variation. It moves *beyond* simply predicting spectrograms to shaping them with a dynamic prosodic ‘envelope’.
