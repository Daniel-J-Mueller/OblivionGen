## Secure Biometric-Augmented Key Exchange

**Concept:** Enhance the password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) with a continuous biometric authentication layer, reducing reliance on static passwords and bolstering security against replay attacks. The system blends passive biometric data capture with active challenge-response to create a dynamic authentication profile.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Client Device:** High-resolution camera (facial/iris recognition), microphone array (voice analysis), optional heart rate/skin conductance sensor.
*   **Server Device:** Processing unit for biometric data analysis, secure storage for dynamic authentication profiles.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Biometric Data Acquisition Module (Client):** Captures facial, vocal, and physiological data.
*   **Feature Extraction Module (Client):** Extracts relevant features from captured biometric data (e.g., facial landmarks, voiceprint, heart rate variability).
*   **Dynamic Profile Generator (Client):** Constructs a dynamic biometric profile based on recent data, continuously updated.
*   **Biometric Analysis Engine (Server):** Analyzes received biometric data, compares it to the stored dynamic profile, and generates a confidence score.
*   **PAKE Integration Module (Client/Server):** Integrates the biometric confidence score into the PAKE protocol.
*   **Challenge Generator (Server):** Generates randomized challenges (e.g., specific phrases to speak, facial expressions to mimic) for active biometric verification.

**3. Protocol Flow:**

1.  **Initial Handshake:** Client initiates a TLS connection, and server sends a self-signed certificate.
2.  **Passive Biometric Capture:** Client begins passively capturing biometric data (facial video, audio) and sending it to the server. Server creates an initial dynamic profile.
3.  **PAKE Initialization:** Standard PAKE exchange begins as described in the provided patent.
4.  **Active Challenge Generation:** Server generates a randomized challenge (e.g., "Say the phrase 'blue horizon'").
5.  **Challenge Response:** Client responds to the challenge while continuing to capture biometric data.
6.  **Biometric Verification:** Server analyzes the client's response, compares it to the dynamic profile, and calculates a biometric confidence score.
7.  **PAKE Augmentation:** The biometric confidence score is integrated into the PAKE protocol. (See Pseudocode below)
8.  **Key Generation:** The augmented PAKE protocol generates the shared key.
9.  **Continuous Authentication:** Throughout the session, the client continues to passively capture biometric data. The server continuously updates the dynamic profile and periodically issues active challenges to maintain a high level of confidence.

**4. Pseudocode (PAKE Augmentation):**

```
// Server Side:
confidenceScore = BiometricAnalysisEngine(clientBiometricData)
adjustedExponent = clientExponent + (confidenceScore * adjustmentFactor) //Scale confidence into key derivation

//Client Side:
adjustedExponent = serverExponent + (confidenceScore * adjustmentFactor)
sharedKey = PAKE(adjustedExponent, passwordData)
```

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   **Liveness Detection:** Implement liveness detection techniques to prevent spoofing attacks (e.g., using photos or recordings).
*   **Privacy Protection:**  Minimize the amount of biometric data stored on the server. Use encryption and anonymization techniques.
*   **Robustness to Noise:** Design the biometric analysis engine to be robust to variations in lighting, background noise, and user behavior.
*   **Adaptive Security:** Adjust the frequency of active challenges and the sensitivity of the biometric analysis engine based on the risk level and user behavior.
