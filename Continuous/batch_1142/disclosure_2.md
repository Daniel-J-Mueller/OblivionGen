## Dynamic Occlusion Mapping with Predictive Particle Swarms

**Concept:** Extend human presence detection by incorporating a dynamic occlusion mapping system. This system utilizes particle swarms to predict potential occlusions of detected individuals, improving tracking accuracy and reducing false negatives in cluttered environments. It moves beyond simple bounding box approaches toward a probabilistic understanding of individual presence *despite* partial visibility.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Input:** RGB-D camera (depth data crucial). Optional: Multi-camera setup for wider field of view.
*   **Particle Swarm Initialization:** Upon initial human detection (bounding box provided by existing system), a swarm of particles is created *within* the bounding box. Each particle represents a potential 'center of mass' for the individual.  Particle count: Scalable, based on bounding box size and desired precision (e.g., 100-500 particles).
*   **Particle Movement:** Particles move based on the following:
    *   **Velocity:** Random initial velocity.
    *   **Attraction:**  Attraction towards observed depth data representing the human form. Stronger attraction towards areas with consistent human-like shapes.
    *   **Repulsion:** Repulsion from detected obstacles (static and dynamic).
    *   **Momentum:**  Maintain previous movement direction (simulates inertia).
    *   **Cohesion:** Particles attempt to stay within a defined 'swarm' radius.
*   **Occlusion Prediction:**  Based on particle distribution and surrounding obstacle data, calculate a 'visibility score' for each particle. Particles obscured by obstacles receive lower scores. The system projects the *probable* location of the individual based on the highest-scoring particle distribution.
*   **Dynamic Mapping:** Create a probabilistic ‘presence map’ representing the likelihood of human presence in each area, based on particle density and visibility scores. This map is updated in real-time.
*   **Filtering & Refinement:**
    *   Implement a Kalman filter to smooth particle trajectories and reduce noise.
    *   Employ a collision avoidance algorithm to prevent particles from penetrating obstacles.
*   **Output:**
    *   Probabilistic presence map.
    *   Refined bounding box (based on peak particle density).
    *   Confidence score for human presence (based on map intensity and particle distribution).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
function initializeSwarm(boundingBox) {
  particles = []
  for i = 0 to numParticles {
    particle = createParticle(randomX(boundingBox), randomY(boundingBox), randomVelocity())
    particles.append(particle)
  }
}

// Update Function (Called per Frame)
function updateSwarm(particles, depthData, obstacleData) {
  for each particle in particles {
    // Calculate forces (attraction, repulsion, cohesion)
    attractionForce = calculateAttraction(particle, depthData)
    repulsionForce = calculateRepulsion(particle, obstacleData)
    cohesionForce = calculateCohesion(particle, particles)

    // Apply forces to update particle velocity and position
    particle.velocity += attractionForce + repulsionForce + cohesionForce
    particle.position += particle.velocity

    // Handle particle collisions with obstacles
    resolveCollisions(particle, obstacleData)
  }

  // Calculate visibility scores for each particle
  visibilityScores = calculateVisibilityScores(particles, obstacleData)

  // Calculate the probabilistic presence map
  presenceMap = generatePresenceMap(particles, visibilityScores)

  return presenceMap
}

// Function to generate the presence map from particle data
function generatePresenceMap(particles, visibilityScores) {
  // Create an empty grid representing the environment
  grid = createGrid()

  // Iterate over particles and increase grid values based on particle density and visibility
  for each particle in particles {
    // Get particle position
    x = particle.x
    y = particle.y

    // Get particle visibility score
    visibilityScore = particle.visibilityScore

    // Increase grid value at particle position based on visibility score
    grid[x][y] += visibilityScore
  }

  return grid
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-resolution RGB-D camera (Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect).
*   GPU acceleration for particle swarm calculations and map rendering.
*   Dedicated processing unit for real-time data processing.
