## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & Resource Allocation

**Core Concept:** Extend the background notification system to dynamically adjust resource allocation to backgrounded applications based on notification content *and* predicted user interaction likelihood. The goal is to provide a smoother, more responsive experience while minimizing overall system resource consumption.

**Specifications:**

**1. Notification Content Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw notification data (text, images, metadata).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the emotional tone of the notification (positive, negative, neutral, urgent).
    *   **Entity Recognition:** Identify key entities within the notification (people, places, events, products).
    *   **Intent Detection:**  Infer the likely user intent based on the notification content (e.g., "respond to message," "view details," "take action").
*   **Output:**  A "Notification Profile" containing: Sentiment Score, Key Entities, Intent Probability (a vector of probabilities for different intents).

**2. User Interaction Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Notification Profile, User History (past app interactions, preferred notification types, time of day, location, calendar events), Device State (battery level, network connectivity).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Machine Learning Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to predict the probability of a user interacting with a given notification within a specific timeframe (e.g., 5 minutes, 30 minutes).  The model should consider the Notification Profile, User History, and Device State.
    *   **Interaction Score:** A normalized score (0-1) representing the predicted likelihood of user interaction.
*   **Output:** Interaction Score.

**3. Adaptive Resource Allocation Manager:**

*   **Input:** Interaction Score, App Priority (user-defined or system-assigned), System Load (CPU, Memory, Battery).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Resource Budget Calculation:**  Each backgrounded app is assigned a "Resource Budget" based on its App Priority and the current System Load.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The Resource Budget is *dynamically adjusted* based on the Interaction Score.  Higher Interaction Scores result in a larger Resource Budget.
    *   **Resource Allocation Strategies:**
        *   **CPU Throttling:** Adjust CPU frequency for the app.
        *   **Memory Caching:** Prioritize caching of frequently accessed data for the app.
        *   **Network Prioritization:**  Give the app higher priority for network access.
*   **Output:** Resource Allocation Parameters (CPU frequency, memory allocation, network priority).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On receiving a notification:

NotificationProfile = AnalyzeNotification(notificationData)
InteractionScore = PredictUserInteraction(NotificationProfile, UserHistory, DeviceState)

ResourceBudget = CalculateBaseResourceBudget(AppPriority, SystemLoad)
ResourceBudget = AdjustResourceBudget(ResourceBudget, InteractionScore)

ApplyResourceAllocationParameters(ResourceBudget, CPUFrequency, MemoryAllocation, NetworkPriority)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `NotificationProfile`: { SentimentScore: float, KeyEntities: [string], IntentProbability: [float] }
*   `UserHistory`: { AppInteractions: [(AppID, Timestamp)], PreferredNotificationTypes: [string], ... }

**Possible Extensions:**

*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate data from sensors (location, motion, ambient light) to further refine interaction predictions.
*   **Personalized Learning:** Allow the machine learning model to adapt to individual user behavior over time.
*   **Cooperative Resource Sharing:** Allow apps to share resources based on predicted needs.
