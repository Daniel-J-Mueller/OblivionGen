## Adaptive Marker Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the weights assigned to different markers based on their predictive power, discovered through a reinforcement learning (RL) agent interacting with a model evaluation environment. This expands on the notion of combining marker scores, introducing a learning component to optimize marker relevance.

**Specification:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **RL Agent:** A deep Q-network (DQN) or similar RL algorithm.
*   **Environment:** A simulated model evaluation environment. This environment receives marker scores and model scores as inputs and outputs a reward signal reflecting the performance improvement achieved by weighting markers differently.
*   **Marker Database:** Stores initial marker weights (equal or based on domain knowledge).
*   **Model Evaluation Module:**  Integrates marker-weighted scores into the model comparison process as defined in the base patent.
*   **Data Stream:** Continuous flow of data items used for training and evaluation.

**2.  Data Representation:**

*   **State:** The state for the RL agent is a vector containing:
    *   The current marker weights.
    *   Recent model evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) for both models being compared.
    *   Distribution of marker scores across the current data batch.
*   **Action:** The action is a vector representing adjustments to the marker weights. Each element corresponds to a specific marker and indicates a proportional change to its current weight.
*   **Reward:** The reward is calculated based on the improvement in the performance difference between the two models being compared after applying the new marker weights.  A positive reward indicates that the adjustment improved the accuracy of the model selection process.

**3. Algorithm/Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize RL Agent (e.g., DQN)
Initialize Marker Database with initial weights
Initialize Environment

// Training Loop
For each episode:
    For each step:
        Observe current state (marker weights, model metrics, score distribution)
        Select action (weight adjustments) using RL policy (e.g., epsilon-greedy)
        Apply action to adjust marker weights
        Evaluate models using weighted marker scores
        Calculate reward based on performance improvement
        Update RL policy based on reward
    End For
End For

// Deployment
Use trained RL policy to dynamically adjust marker weights during model evaluation.
```

**4.  Component Specifications:**

*   **RL Agent:**
    *   Network Architecture: Deep Q-Network with multiple fully connected layers.
    *   Learning Rate: 0.001
    *   Discount Factor: 0.9
    *   Epsilon Decay: Linear decay from 1.0 to 0.01 over the training period.
*   **Environment:**
    *   Batch Size: 128
    *   Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC
    *   Reward Function:  `Reward = F1_score_Model2 - F1_score_Model1` (maximize the difference)
* **Marker Weight Adjustment Limits:** Each marker's weight can be adjusted within a range of 0.5 to 1.5 times its initial value. This prevents drastic changes that might destabilize the system.

**5.  Novelty & Potential:**

This system introduces adaptability to the marker weighting process. Rather than relying on static weights, it learns the optimal weights based on the specific characteristics of the data and the performance of the models being compared. This has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of the model selection process, particularly in dynamic environments where data distributions change over time. The RL agent can even learn to identify markers that are initially thought to be irrelevant, but actually provide valuable information when combined with other markers.
