## Dynamic Security Bubble Shards

**Concept:** Expand the “security bubble” concept beyond a single encapsulation to a fragmented, dynamic system. Instead of sending *one* encrypted package, split the communication and encryption keys into multiple “shards,” each secured with a different recipient’s public key and sent to *different* authorized devices. Reconstruction requires collaboration.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shard Generation:**
    *   Input: Original communication data (message).
    *   Process: Divide the message into *n* equal-sized shards.
    *   Key Generation: Generate *n* symmetric keys (Key1, Key2…Keyn). Each shard will be encrypted using a unique symmetric key.
    *   Recipient Selection: Designate *n* authorized recipients (Recipient1, Recipient2…Recipientn). This can be pre-defined access control lists or dynamic selection based on policy.
    *   Key Encryption: Encrypt each symmetric key (Key1, Key2…Keyn) with the corresponding recipient’s public key (PubKey1, PubKey2…Pubkeyn).
    *   Shard Encryption: Encrypt each message shard with its associated symmetric key.
    *   Output: *n* encrypted shards, *n* encrypted symmetric keys, a manifest file detailing shard/key assignments and recipient identifiers.

*   **Transmission Protocol:**
    *   Shard/Key Pairing: Each encrypted shard is paired with its corresponding encrypted symmetric key.
    *   Independent Transmission: Each shard/key pair is transmitted to its designated recipient's device. Utilize existing secure communication channels (e.g., TLS).
    *   Manifest Transmission: A copy of the manifest file is transmitted to a designated "coordinator" – potentially a server or a trusted device of the message originator.

*   **Reconstruction Protocol:**
    *   Shard Collection: Recipients, upon receiving a shard/key pair, transmit the encrypted shard to the coordinator.
    *   Key Sharing (Optional): Implement secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols to allow recipients to *collectively* decrypt the symmetric keys without revealing them individually to the coordinator.
    *   Decryption: The coordinator uses the decrypted symmetric keys to decrypt the corresponding shards.
    *   Reassembly: The coordinator reassembles the decrypted shards into the original message.
    *   Delivery: The coordinator delivers the reconstructed message to the intended recipient(s).

*   **System Components:**
    *   *Shard Generator Module*: Responsible for splitting the message, generating keys, encrypting shards and keys, and creating the manifest.
    *   *Transmission Manager*: Handles secure transmission of shards, keys, and the manifest.
    *   *Coordinator Module*: Receives shards, manages decryption, reassembles the message, and delivers it to the intended recipient(s).

*   **Pseudocode (Coordinator Module - Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructMessage(shardList, keyList, manifestFile):
  // shardList: List of encrypted shards
  // keyList: List of encrypted symmetric keys
  // manifestFile: Contains shard/key assignments

  decryptedShards = []
  decryptedKeys = []

  for each shardKeyAssignment in manifestFile:
    shard = shardKeyAssignment.shard
    key = shardKeyAssignment.key

    // Decrypt the symmetric key (using recipient’s private key)
    decryptedKey = decrypt(key, recipientPrivateKey)
    decryptedKeys.append(decryptedKey)

    // Decrypt the shard using the decrypted symmetric key
    decryptedShard = decrypt(shard, decryptedKey)
    decryptedShards.append(decryptedShard)

  // Reassemble the shards
  reconstructedMessage = reassemble(decryptedShards)

  return reconstructedMessage
```

*   **Novelty:** This surpasses a single "bubble" by introducing a distributed security model. Compromise of one recipient's device doesn't reveal the entire message. Requires *collaboration* for decryption, adding a layer of access control.
