## Dynamic Network Persona Creation & Routing

**Concept:** Extend the virtual traffic hub concept to support dynamically created "Network Personas" – temporary, isolated network segments with tailored routing policies – provisioned on-demand and integrated seamlessly into the existing network topology. This isn't just about propagating routing tables; it's about *creating* temporary networks with specific characteristics.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition:** A persona is defined by:
    *   IP address range (CIDR notation).
    *   A set of permitted protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
    *   Quality of Service (QoS) parameters (bandwidth, latency).
    *   Security policies (firewall rules, intrusion detection).
    *   An expiration timestamp.
*   **Persona Provisioning API:** A RESTful API to create, modify, and delete personas. Example request:

    ```json
    POST /personas
    {
      "name": "TempDevNetwork",
      "ip_range": "10.100.0.0/24",
      "protocols": ["tcp", "udp"],
      "qos": {
        "bandwidth": "100Mbps",
        "latency": "50ms"
      },
      "security_policies": [
        {"protocol": "tcp", "port": 80, "action": "allow"},
        {"protocol": "tcp", "port": 22, "action": "deny"}
      ],
      "expiration": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    }
    ```
*   **Routing Integration:** When a persona is created, the system automatically updates routing tables across the virtual traffic hub.
    *   New routes are added to direct traffic destined for the persona’s IP range to a designated “persona gateway” node within the hub.
    *   Reverse routes are added to ensure traffic originating from the persona can reach external networks.
*   **Persona Gateway Node:** A dedicated node type within the virtual traffic hub responsible for enforcing persona-specific policies.
    *   Acts as a virtual firewall and router for the persona.
    *   Implements QoS policies.
    *   Monitors traffic for security threats.
*   **Dynamic Route Propagation Algorithm:** A modified version of the existing route propagation algorithm to handle persona routes.
    *   Prioritizes persona routes based on expiration time.
    *   Automatically removes persona routes when they expire.
    *   Handles overlapping IP ranges by implementing Network Address Translation (NAT) or virtual IP addresses.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** The system monitors persona usage and generates alerts based on predefined thresholds (e.g., bandwidth consumption, security events).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function createPersona(personaDefinition):
  # Validate personaDefinition
  # Allocate IP range
  # Create personaGateway node
  # Configure personaGateway with policies from personaDefinition
  # Add routes to routing tables:
  #   - Direct traffic to personaGateway for IP range
  #   - Allow return traffic from IP range
  # Start monitoring persona usage
  return personaID

function deletePersona(personaID):
  # Remove routes from routing tables
  # Deallocate IP range
  # Stop monitoring
  # Remove personaGateway node
```

**Novelty:** This approach differs from simple route propagation by *actively creating* network segments with specific properties. It’s akin to software-defined networking (SDN) but applied to dynamically provisioned, temporary networks within the virtual traffic hub. The expiration timestamp ensures automatic cleanup, preventing orphaned network configurations. This is advantageous for development/testing environments, temporary project networks, or security isolation use cases.
