**Dynamic Resource Group Prediction & Pre-emptive Scaling**

**Concept:** The existing patent detects traffic surges *after* they begin. This design focuses on *predicting* potential surges before they happen, enabling proactive scaling of resources. It builds on the "resource group" concept but introduces time-series forecasting and contextual data.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Collect historical request data (volume, latency, error rates) for all resource groups (as defined in the base patent).
    *   Ingest external contextual data:
        *   Social media trends (mentions of relevant keywords, sentiment analysis).
        *   News feeds (events potentially driving traffic – product launches, major announcements).
        *   Marketing campaign schedules (planned advertising bursts).
        *   Geographical data (regional events, time zones).
        *   Weather data (localized events potentially impacting user behavior).
2.  **Feature Engineering:**
    *   Create time-series features from historical request data (e.g., rolling averages, standard deviations, exponential smoothing).
    *   Encode contextual data into numerical features (e.g., keyword frequency, sentiment scores, event flags).
    *   Combine time-series and contextual features for each resource group.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   Train a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet, ARIMA) on the engineered features.
    *   Model outputs:  Predicted request volume for each resource group over a defined future time horizon (e.g., next 15 minutes, next hour).
    *   Generate a 'surge probability' score – a measure of confidence that predicted volume will exceed a predefined threshold.
4.  **Resource Scaling Engine:**
    *   Monitor surge probability scores in real-time.
    *   If a score exceeds a threshold (configurable per resource group), trigger pre-emptive scaling:
        *   Allocate additional server capacity (virtual machines, containers).
        *   Increase bandwidth allocation.
        *   Cache content more aggressively.
        *   Route traffic to geographically diverse POPs.
5.  **Feedback Loop & Model Retraining:**
    *   Collect data on actual traffic volume after scaling.
    *   Compare predicted volume to actual volume.
    *   Use this data to retrain the predictive model periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) to improve accuracy.
6. **Anomaly Detection Integration:** Incorporate anomaly detection algorithms. Sudden shifts in contextual data (e.g., massive unexpected social media spike) should independently trigger alert escalation, even if model prediction is stable.

**Pseudocode (Resource Scaling Engine):**

```
FUNCTION scaleResources(resourceGroup, predictedVolume, surgeProbability)
  threshold = getConfig(resourceGroup, "surgeThreshold")
  IF surgeProbability > threshold THEN
    scaleFactor = calculateScaleFactor(predictedVolume)
    addCapacity(resourceGroup, scaleFactor)
    logEvent("Resources scaled for " + resourceGroup + " due to predicted surge.")
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateScaleFactor(predictedVolume)
  // Logic to determine appropriate scaling based on predicted volume
  // Could use a linear, exponential, or logarithmic scaling function
  scaleFactor = predictedVolume / currentCapacity
  scaleFactor = MIN(scaleFactor, maxScaleFactor) // Limit scaling to prevent over-provisioning
  RETURN scaleFactor
ENDFUNCTION
```
