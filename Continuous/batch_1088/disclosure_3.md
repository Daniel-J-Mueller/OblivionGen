**Adaptive Media 'Echo' System**

**Core Concept:** Extend the proactive media delivery beyond ebooks to *all* digital media (audio, video, games) and create a system where the user’s engagement *with* the sample dictates the type of subsequent content offered, moving beyond simple series/author recommendations.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Media Profile Creation:**
    *   Each user account incorporates a ‘Media Echo Profile’ – a dynamic data structure tracking engagement metrics *within* samples. Metrics include:
        *   Time spent on specific sections/chapters/scenes.
        *   Interaction type (e.g., highlighting, note-taking, replay, fast-forward).
        *   Emotional response (derived from device sensors - optional, user-opt-in only).  Facial expression analysis via camera, or stress detection from wearable devices.
        *   Completion rate of the sample.
    *   This profile is *not* static; it’s continuously updated with each sample interaction.

2.  **Proactive Sample Delivery Engine:**
    *   System selects samples based on broad user interests (established during account creation/past purchases).
    *   Crucially, *after* a user interacts with the initial sample, the system analyzes the Media Echo Profile and dynamically adjusts the *type* of subsequent sample offered.
    *   Example: User receives a sample of a Sci-Fi novel.  If the Media Echo Profile shows high engagement with complex world-building sections, the next sample might be a detailed lore video game trailer. If engagement is high with action sequences, the next sample might be an action movie trailer.  If engagement is high with character dialogues, then the next sample might be an audio drama.
    *   The system aims to 'echo' the user's preferred engagement *style*, not just content category.

3.  **'Engagement Thresholds' & Automated Purchase:**
    *   Each sample has predefined 'Engagement Thresholds'.  These thresholds represent a level of user interaction indicating a high probability of full purchase.
    *   If a user surpasses an Engagement Threshold within the sample (e.g., 75% completion rate *and* significant interaction with key sections), the system initiates an automated purchase of the full media item.
    *   User must have pre-established payment information, as in the reference patent.

4.  **Media Source Integration:**
    *   The system must integrate with various media providers (ebook stores, streaming services, game platforms, etc.) via APIs.
    *   A 'Media Catalog' maintains metadata about available samples, Engagement Thresholds, and provider integration details.

5. **Pseudocode – Sample Selection & Delivery:**

```
FUNCTION deliver_sample_to_user(user_id)
  user_profile = GET_USER_PROFILE(user_id)
  user_interests = user_profile.interests

  candidate_samples = QUERY_MEDIA_CATALOG(user_interests) // Retrieve samples matching interests

  IF candidate_samples is empty:
    // Broaden search criteria or suggest different categories
    RETURN "No suitable samples found"

  selected_sample = SELECT_SAMPLE_BASED_ON_ENGAGEMENT_STYLE(user_profile.engagement_history, candidate_samples)

  deliver_sample(user_id, selected_sample)

FUNCTION SELECT_SAMPLE_BASED_ON_ENGAGEMENT_STYLE(engagement_history, candidate_samples):
  // Analyze engagement_history to determine preferred engagement style (e.g., visual, auditory, interactive)
  // Score candidate_samples based on how well they match the preferred style
  // Return the highest-scoring sample
```

**Novelty:** This extends the core idea beyond simply delivering ebooks and proactively adapting the *type* of media offered to match a user's engagement style, rather than just content preferences.  It leverages a more granular analysis of user interaction *within* samples.
