## Dynamic Model Composition via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Instead of a pre-defined workflow or a workflow determined solely by input/output vector matching, leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to *discover* optimal model compositions dynamically. This allows for adaptation to subtle image characteristics and potentially unlocks solutions beyond those possible with static workflows.

**Specs:**

*   **RL Agent:** A Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Policy Gradient agent.
*   **State Space:**
    *   Embedded Image Feature Vector: Output of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (e.g., ResNet, Inception) applied to the input image.
    *   Model Execution History: A record of previously executed models in the current workflow. This allows the agent to avoid redundant computations and adapt to partial results. Represented as a vector of model identifiers and their associated output feature vectors.
    *   Current Workflow Cost: Accumulated computational cost (e.g., inference time, memory usage) of the current workflow.
*   **Action Space:** Select a model from the available library.  This action includes the model identifier.
*   **Reward Function:**
    *   Positive Reward: Based on the 'confidence' of the final output vector.  This could be derived from the softmax probabilities (if applicable) or other measures of output reliability.
    *   Negative Reward:  For computational cost. This encourages the agent to find efficient workflows.
    *   Terminal Reward:  A large positive reward if the final output vector meets a pre-defined quality threshold.  A negative reward if the quality is insufficient.
*   **Training Data:** A large dataset of images with corresponding ground truth labels.  The agent learns to navigate the model space and find workflows that produce accurate results.
*   **Model Library Interface:**  A standardized interface for accessing the available computer vision models. Each model provides its input/output vector specifications and an inference function.
*   **Workflow Execution Engine:**  An engine that takes a sequence of model identifiers and executes them in order, passing the output of one model as input to the next.

**Pseudocode:**

```
Initialize RL Agent, Model Library, Workflow Engine

For each input image:
  Observe image feature vector, initial state (empty execution history, zero cost)
  While not terminal:
    Action = RL Agent.select_action(state) // Select a model
    Output_Vector = Workflow_Engine.execute_model(Action, Input_Vector)
    New_State = Update_State(Output_Vector, Action) // Include in history, update cost
    Reward = Calculate_Reward(Output_Vector, New_State)
    RL Agent.update(state, action, reward, New_State)
    state = New_State
    If Terminal_Condition_Met(state):
      break
  Transmit final output vector
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Hierarchical RL:** Use a hierarchical RL structure, where a high-level agent selects 'macro-actions' (e.g., "edge detection", "object recognition"), and low-level agents select specific models within those categories.
*   **Curriculum Learning:** Start with simpler images and gradually increase the complexity, allowing the agent to learn more effectively.
*   **Transfer Learning:** Pre-train the RL agent on a synthetic dataset or a related task before deploying it on real-world images.
*   **Exploration/Exploitation Balance:**  Carefully tune the exploration/exploitation parameters of the RL algorithm to avoid getting stuck in local optima.
