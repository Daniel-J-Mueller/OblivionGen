## Dynamic Partition Evolution & Predictive Pruning

**Specification:** A system to dynamically evolve dataset partitioning schemes *after* initial data ingestion, coupled with a predictive pruning mechanism based on query patterns and data drift detection.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on retention *within* a defined partition scheme. This design tackles the problem of *suboptimal* initial partition schemes and changing data characteristics. Initial partitioning is often based on assumptions; this system adapts over time.

**Components:**

1.  **Partitioning Advisor:** (Runs periodically – configurable interval)
    *   **Input:** Dataset metadata (schema, current partition key(s)), Query logs (last N days/weeks), Data profile (statistical distribution of values in key columns – updated incrementally).
    *   **Process:**
        *   **Cost Model:** Evaluates various potential partition key combinations using a cost model. Cost factors include:
            *   Data skew (uneven distribution of data across partitions).
            *   Query latency (estimated time to execute common queries with each partition scheme).
            *   Data locality (how well the partitioning aligns with common access patterns).
        *   **Partition Key Recommendation:**  Suggests a revised partition key based on minimizing the cost function.  Includes a “confidence score” representing the predicted improvement.
2.  **Online Partition Evolution Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Partition Key Recommendation (from Partitioning Advisor), Dataset metadata, Configuration parameters (e.g., acceptable downtime, concurrency levels).
    *   **Process:**
        *   **Gradual Repartitioning:**  Executes a gradual repartitioning process, minimizing disruption to ongoing queries.  This can be implemented using techniques like:
            *   **Dual Writes:** New data is written to both the old and new partition schemes.
            *   **Background Data Migration:** Data is migrated from the old scheme to the new scheme in batches.
            *   **Query Routing:** Queries are routed to the appropriate partition scheme based on the data’s location.
        *   **Schema Versioning:** Maintains multiple versions of the dataset’s schema to support the transition.
3.  **Predictive Pruning Module:**
    *   **Input:** Query Logs, Data Drift Metrics (e.g., changes in the statistical distribution of data values), Retention Policies.
    *   **Process:**
        *   **Query Pattern Analysis:** Identifies queries that consistently access a small subset of data within a partition.
        *   **Data Drift Detection:** Monitors changes in the data’s characteristics that may invalidate assumptions about data access patterns.
        *   **Dynamic Partition Filtering:** Creates filters that exclude partitions that are unlikely to contain relevant data for a given query, even *before* accessing the data. This can be implemented using Bloom filters or other probabilistic data structures.
        *   **Retention Policy Optimization:** Based on usage and drift, dynamically suggests adjustments to retention policies for individual partitions. For example, a rarely accessed partition with little recent activity might have its retention period shortened.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Pruning Module):**

```
function predict_relevant_partitions(query, retention_policy, query_logs, drift_metrics):
  relevant_partitions = []

  # 1. Load pre-computed filters from query logs
  filters = load_filters(query, query_logs)

  # 2. Apply filters to potential partitions
  for partition in dataset.partitions:
    if filters.contains(partition):
      relevant_partitions.append(partition)

  # 3. Consider data drift
  drift_score = calculate_drift_score(partition, drift_metrics)
  if drift_score > threshold:
    # Exclude partition if drift is significant
    relevant_partitions.remove(partition)

  # 4. Apply retention policy
  filtered_partitions = []
  for partition in relevant_partitions:
    if retention_policy.is_within_retention(partition):
      filtered_partitions.append(partition)

  return filtered_partitions
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Bloom Filter:** Used to store probabilistic information about the presence or absence of data values in a partition.
*   **Query Log:** Stores historical query information, including query patterns and access frequencies.
*   **Drift Metric:** Quantifies the degree of change in the data’s characteristics over time.
