## Adaptive Packet Splitting Based on Network Congestion Prediction

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A predictive network congestion module integrated into both sending hosts and network routers.
*   **Data Input:** Real-time network metrics (latency, packet loss, bandwidth utilization) collected from network routers and end-host monitoring. Historical network performance data. Machine Learning model (RNN/LSTM) trained to predict short-term congestion events (1-5 seconds).
*   **Data Output:** Congestion prediction score for each network path (0-100, higher = higher predicted congestion).
*   **Packet Splitting Logic:**
    *   Sending host analyzes network paths to the destination.
    *   For each TCP packet, the host queries the congestion prediction module for each path.
    *   Packet is split into *N* copies (N configurable, default = 3).
    *   Each copy is assigned to a path based on the congestion prediction score. Lower scores are prioritized. A weighted random selection can be used to introduce diversity.
    *   Each packet copy includes a sequence number and a destination reassembly identifier.
*   **Reassembly Logic:**
    *   Destination host receives packet copies via different paths.
    *   Host buffers copies using the sequence number and reassembly ID.
    *   Once all *N* copies are received (or a timeout occurs), the host reassembles the original packet.
    *   Duplicate or late arriving copies are discarded.
*   **Adaptive Splitting:**
    *   The number of packet copies (*N*) is dynamically adjusted based on observed network conditions.
    *   If packet loss is high, increase *N*.
    *   If network is stable, decrease *N* (down to 1).
*   **Encapsulation:**
    *   Packet copies are encapsulated with a lightweight header containing:
        *   Sequence Number
        *   Reassembly ID
        *   Original Packet Length
        *   Checksum
*   **Network Router Integration:**
    *   Routers periodically broadcast network performance metrics.
    *   Routers can provide 'hints' to hosts about optimal paths.
    *   Routers can assist with reassembly (optional).

**Pseudocode (Sending Host):**

```
function sendPacket(packet, destination):
    paths = getAvailablePaths(destination)
    congestionScores = predictCongestion(paths)

    numCopies = determineNumCopies(congestionScores)

    for i = 0 to numCopies:
        path = selectPath(paths, congestionScores)
        copy = createPacketCopy(packet)
        copy.sequenceNumber = i
        copy.reassemblyID = generateReassemblyID(destination)
        sendEncapsulatedPacket(copy, path)
```

**Pseudocode (Destination Host):**

```
function receivePacket(packet):
    reassemblyID = packet.reassemblyID
    sequenceNumber = packet.sequenceNumber
    packetBuffer = getPacketBuffer(reassemblyID)
    packetBuffer.add(sequenceNumber, packet.payload)

    if packetBuffer.isComplete():
        reassembledPacket = packetBuffer.reassemble()
        deliverPacket(reassembledPacket)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard network interface cards (NICs).
*   Sufficient processing power to handle packet splitting and reassembly.
*   Increased memory bandwidth for buffering packet copies.
