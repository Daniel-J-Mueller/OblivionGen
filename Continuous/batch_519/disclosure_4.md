## Secure Virtual Machine Snapshot Attestation & Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the secure boot/attestation process to encompass *running* virtual machine (VM) snapshots, enabling verifiable rollback to known-good states *during* operation, not just at boot. This adds a layer of runtime integrity beyond initial boot attestation.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** VM Snapshot Manager (VSM) - Software module integrated with the hypervisor.
*   **Secure Snapshot Creation:**
    1.  VSM calculates a cryptographic hash (SHA-384 or similar) of the *entire* VM memory state (RAM, CPU registers, device state) *before* the snapshot is created.
    2.  This hash is sealed using a key derived from the TPM (or equivalent secure element) – leveraging PCRs to bind the hash to the current system state.  A ‘Snapshot Seal Key’ (SSK) is generated and stored securely.
    3.  The snapshot data itself is created as usual by the hypervisor.
    4.  Metadata associated with the snapshot includes: Snapshot ID, Timestamp, SSK reference, and a signature created using the host’s signing key (verified by remote systems).
*   **Attestation Service Integration:** A new attestation endpoint on the host.  Remote systems can request attestation of a specific VM snapshot (identified by Snapshot ID).
    1.  Host receives attestation request.
    2.  Host retrieves the snapshot metadata.
    3.  Host unseals the original memory hash using the TPM and SSK reference.
    4.  Host recalculates the hash of the current (running) VM memory state.
    5.  Host compares the two hashes.
    6.  Host returns an attestation report to the remote system, including: Snapshot ID, Timestamp, Hash Comparison Result (Match/Mismatch), and Host Signature.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**  If the attestation report indicates a mismatch, or if a remote system initiates a rollback request, the VSM can restore the VM to the attested snapshot state.
    1.  VSM initiates a controlled shutdown of the VM.
    2.  VSM restores the VM memory state from the snapshot data.
    3.  VSM restarts the VM.
*   **PCR Binding:**  PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers) within the TPM are used to bind the snapshot hash to:
    *   Host boot state (verified through existing attestation).
    *   Hypervisor version.
    *   VM configuration (vCPU count, memory allocation, network settings).

**Pseudocode (Attestation Service Endpoint):**

```
function AttestSnapshot(SnapshotID, RemoteSystemPublicKey) {
  SnapshotMetadata = GetSnapshotMetadata(SnapshotID)
  if (SnapshotMetadata == null) {
    return Error("Snapshot not found")
  }

  //Unseal snapshot hash from TPM using stored SSK reference.
  OriginalHash = UnsealHash(SnapshotMetadata.SSKReference)

  //Recalculate hash of current VM memory state.
  CurrentHash = CalculateVMHash(SnapshotMetadata.VMID)

  if (OriginalHash == CurrentHash) {
    AttestationReport = {
      SnapshotID: SnapshotID,
      Timestamp: Now(),
      Status: "Match",
      HostSignature: Sign(AttestationReport, HostPrivateKey)
    }
  } else {
    AttestationReport = {
      SnapshotID: SnapshotID,
      Timestamp: Now(),
      Status: "Mismatch",
      HostSignature: Sign(AttestationReport, HostPrivateKey)
    }
  }

  SendAttestationReport(RemoteSystemPublicKey, AttestationReport)
}

```

**Rationale:** Current secure boot focuses on initial system integrity. This extends that concept to running VMs, providing a real-time integrity check and enabling rollback to a known-good state if compromised during operation. This is critical for cloud environments and secure containers.
