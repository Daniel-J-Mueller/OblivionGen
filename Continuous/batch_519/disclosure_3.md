## Temporal Key Sharding & Rotation

**Concept:** Extend the redundancy concept beyond simple duplication of keys. Implement a system where cryptographic keys are *temporally* sharded – broken into pieces, each valid for a limited duration – and rotated frequently. This drastically limits the window of opportunity for an attacker, even if they compromise a key shard.  Instead of *just* redundant storage, we’re adding redundancy *in time*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Generation & Initial Sharding:**

*   **Master Key:** Generate a high-entropy Master Key (MK) – managed separately with strong hardware security modules (HSMs). This is *never* directly used for data encryption.
*   **Temporal Keys (TK):**  Derive Temporal Keys (TKs) from the MK using a Key Derivation Function (KDF) – Argon2id is recommended.  Each TK is valid for a pre-defined *Temporal Window* (e.g., 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours – configurable per data set).
*   **Shard Count:** Each TK is sharded into ‘N’ parts (e.g., 3, 5, 7 – configurable).
*   **Threshold Cryptography:** Implement a (t, n) threshold cryptography scheme.  ‘t’ shards are required to reconstruct the full TK. ‘n’ is the total number of shards. (e.g. 3 of 5 shards required).
*   **Shard Storage:** Distribute the shards across the redundant storage devices.

**2. Encryption Process:**

*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt data using a Data Encryption Key (DEK) generated per-object (or small chunk of object).
*   **DEK Encryption:** Encrypt the DEK using the *current* valid TK.  (This is the key link to time).
*   **Encrypted Data Storage:** Store the encrypted data and the encrypted DEK.

**3. Decryption Process:**

*   **Retrieve Encrypted Data & DEK:** Retrieve the encrypted data and the encrypted DEK.
*   **Shard Collection:** Collect the required ‘t’ shards of the *current* valid TK.
*   **TK Reconstruction:** Reconstruct the TK from the collected shards.
*   **DEK Decryption:** Decrypt the DEK using the reconstructed TK.
*   **Data Decryption:** Decrypt the data using the decrypted DEK.

**4. Key Rotation & Anti-Entropy:**

*   **Scheduled Rotation:**  At the end of each Temporal Window, generate a new MK, derive a new set of TKs, and repeat the encryption/sharding process for *new* data.
*   **Continuous Re-encryption (Optional):** For maximum security, gradually re-encrypt existing data with the new TKs in the background. Prioritize frequently accessed data.
*   **Anti-Entropy Process:** A dedicated process constantly scans the storage system for data encrypted with older TKs. When found, it re-encrypts the data with the current TK. This ensures that even if an old TK is compromised, the data remains protected.
*   **Shard Refresh:** At each rotation, redistribute the shards.  Avoid storing the same shard on the same device for extended periods.

**5. System Components:**

*   **Key Management Service (KMS):** Responsible for generating and managing the MK, deriving TKs, and managing shard distribution.
*   **Shard Distributor:** Distributes shards to storage devices and monitors shard availability.
*   **Anti-Entropy Engine:** Scans for outdated encrypted data and re-encrypts it.
*   **Storage Nodes:** Store encrypted data and shards.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Decryption):**

```
function decryptData(encryptedData, encryptedDEK):
  currentTKShards = retrieveCurrentTKShards()
  if shardCount(currentTKShards) < threshold:
    return error("Insufficient shards")

  reconstructedTK = reconstructKey(currentTKShards)
  decryptedDEK = decrypt(encryptedDEK, reconstructedTK)
  decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData, decryptedDEK)
  return decryptedData
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond static key redundancy to a dynamic, time-limited redundancy. The continuous rotation and anti-entropy processes significantly reduce the attack surface and mitigate the impact of key compromise.  It introduces the concept of a "temporal durability" metric alongside traditional durability.  The threshold cryptography adds another layer of security against single-shard compromise.
