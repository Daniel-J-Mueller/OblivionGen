## Haptic Feedback Support Structure

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback into the support structure to guide user repositioning and indicate optimal positioning for the projection/capture system. This goes beyond simply unlocking/locking – it actively *communicates* with the user through touch.

**Specs:**

*   **Structure:** Maintain the basic arm/joint design of the patent, but embed micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar) within the arm segments and at the joint connections.
*   **Sensors:** Integrate inertial measurement units (IMUs) at each joint and along the arm length to track position, velocity, and acceleration of the support structure. Also, integrate proximity sensors to detect nearby obstacles.
*   **Control System:** A microcontroller-based system receives input from the IMUs and proximity sensors. It calculates the optimal position based on pre-defined parameters (e.g., projection angle, desired field of view, obstacle avoidance). 
*   **Haptic Feedback Modes:**
    *   **Guidance Mode:** When unlocked, the actuators generate localized vibrations or pressure changes to ‘pull’ the arm towards the optimal position. Intensity increases as the user nears the target. Think of it as a subtle, guiding force.
    *   **Obstacle Avoidance:** If the system detects an impending collision, actuators generate a stronger, more localized vibration to alert the user and discourage movement in that direction.
    *   **Position Confirmation:** Upon reaching the optimal position and locking, the actuators provide a distinct “pulse” or sustained vibration to confirm successful positioning.
    *   **Calibration Mode:** A mode which allows the user to 'teach' the system desired positions by physically guiding the arm. The system records the position and associated data for future use.
*   **User Interface:** A small OLED display integrated into the base of the support structure to show current mode, calibration status, and any detected obstacles.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging or a low-voltage DC power supply.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
// Initialization
Initialize IMUs, proximity sensors, actuators, and OLED display
Load calibration data (if available)

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {
    Read IMU data (position, velocity, acceleration)
    Read proximity sensor data
    
    If (Support Structure Unlocked) {
        Calculate target position (based on calibration data & desired parameters)
        Calculate error (difference between current position & target position)
        
        //Apply haptic feedback proportional to error
        For each actuator:
            Actuator_Intensity = K * Error  // K = proportional gain
            Activate Actuator(Actuator_Intensity)
    } else {
        // Sustained vibration to confirm lock
        Activate Lock_Confirmation_Actuator(intensity)
    }
    
    If (Obstacle Detected) {
        Activate Obstacle_Warning_Actuators(intensity)
    }
    
    Update OLED display with current status.
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Force Feedback:** Integrate stronger actuators to provide actual force feedback, allowing the user to ‘feel’ virtual objects within the projected environment.
*   **AI-Powered Adaptation:** Use machine learning to personalize the haptic feedback based on the user’s movements and preferences.
*   **Remote Control:** Allow the system to be controlled remotely via a mobile app or computer.
