## Secure Enclave Communication Bridging with Dynamic Attestation Chains

**Concept:** Extend the isolated runtime environment (IRE) security model by enabling secure, auditable communication *between* multiple IREs, and extending attestation beyond a single host to a chain of dependent IREs. This creates a secure, distributed computation model.

**Specs:**

**1. Inter-Enclave Communication Protocol (IECP):**

*   **Purpose:** Establish a secure channel between two IREs, guaranteeing confidentiality and integrity of messages.
*   **Mechanism:** IECP leverages asymmetric encryption and digital signatures.  Each IRE possesses a unique enclave key pair.
*   **Handshake:**
    1.  IRE-A initiates communication by sending its public key (enclave certificate) to IRE-B.
    2.  IRE-B validates the certificate (chain of trust to a root CA or a pre-shared root key).
    3.  IRE-B generates a symmetric key and encrypts it with IRE-A’s public key.  The encrypted symmetric key is sent to IRE-A.
    4.  IRE-A decrypts the symmetric key.
    5.  Subsequent communication uses the symmetric key for AES-GCM encryption.
*   **Message Format:**  `[Sequence Number][Encrypted Payload][Message Authentication Code]`

**2. Dynamic Attestation Chain (DAC):**

*   **Purpose:** Extend attestation beyond a single host/IRE to include dependencies on other IREs. This allows verification of a complex computation spanning multiple enclaves.
*   **Mechanism:** DAC builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of attestation records.
*   **Attestation Record:** `[Enclave ID][Timestamp][Host Attestation Report][Parent Enclave ID][Data Hash]`
*   **Chain Building:**
    1.  When IRE-B initiates a computation requiring IRE-A, it generates an Attestation Record including a hash of the computation's input data and IRE-A’s Enclave ID.
    2.  This Attestation Record is signed by IRE-B’s enclave key.
    3.  IRE-B sends this signed Attestation Record to IRE-A.
    4.  IRE-A verifies IRE-B’s signature and validates the included Host Attestation Report (as per the original patent's mechanism).
    5.  IRE-A adds the verified Attestation Record to its own local DAC.
    6.  If the computation requires *another* enclave (IRE-C), the process repeats.
*   **Verification:** An external verifier can request a complete DAC from any IRE, allowing it to trace the entire computation back to a trusted root.

**3. Trust Policy Engine (TPE):**

*   **Purpose:** Define granular trust policies governing inter-enclave communication and DAC validation.
*   **Policy Definition:**  Policies are expressed in a declarative language (e.g., JSON).  Example:

    ```json
    {
      "enclave_id": "IRE-A",
      "allowed_communicators": ["IRE-B", "IRE-C"],
      "max_dac_depth": 3,
      "required_attestation_level": "Level-2"
    }
    ```
*   **Enforcement:**  The TPE intercepts all inter-enclave communication requests and DAC validation attempts.  It enforces the defined policies.

**4.  Hardware Support Enhancement (Optional):**

*   **Purpose:**  Improve DAC performance and security.
*   **Mechanism:**  Extend the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or similar hardware security device to support DAC storage and validation.  The TPM can securely store DAC fragments and provide hardware-accelerated signature verification.

**Pseudocode (DAC Validation):**

```
function validateDAC(rootAttestationRecord, verifier) {
  if (isRecordValid(rootAttestationRecord, verifier)) {
    // Check signature, timestamp, host attestation report
    record = rootAttestationRecord
    while (record.parentEnclaveID != null) {
      parentRecord = getRecord(record.parentEnclaveID)
      if (!isRecordValid(parentRecord, verifier)) {
        return false; // Chain broken
      }
      record = parentRecord;
    }
    return true; // Full chain validated
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This extends the concept of isolated runtimes beyond single-host attestation to a dynamic, multi-enclave model. The DAC allows tracing complex computations across multiple secure enclaves, enhancing trust and auditability. The Trust Policy Engine provides granular control over inter-enclave communication.
