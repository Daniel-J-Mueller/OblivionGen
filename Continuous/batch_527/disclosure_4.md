## Adaptive Icon ‘Moods’ & Predictive Icon Morphing

**Concept:** Expand the predictive icon display to not just *what* the user accesses, but *how* they access it, based on inferred emotional state and predicted usage ‘mood’.  Instead of merely swapping icons based on connectivity or time, the icons themselves *morph* visually to reflect likely user intent.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate data from device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone – ambient sound analysis, camera – facial expression analysis – optional, requiring clear user consent and privacy controls).
*   **Emotional State Inference Engine:**  Develop a machine learning model trained on sensor data correlated with user actions to infer an emotional ‘mood’ (e.g., focused, relaxed, bored, stressed, creative). The model must allow for user calibration and adjustment.
*   **Usage Mood Prediction:** Extend existing prediction algorithms to incorporate the inferred emotional state.  If the user is typically 'focused' between 9-11 AM and tends to use work apps, the icons should reflect this. If the user is usually 'relaxed' in the evening and streams video, different icons should appear.
*   **Dynamic Icon Morphing:**  Design a system where icons aren’t simply swapped, but *morph* visually. 
    *   **Visual Style Presets:**  Define a library of visual styles (e.g., ‘minimalist’, ‘playful’, ‘professional’, ‘energized’).
    *   **Morph Parameters:**  Associate each icon with a set of morph parameters that control its appearance (color, shape, animation, texture).
    *   **Mood-Driven Morphing:** The emotional state will then be translated into values for these morph parameters. A ‘focused’ mood might result in sharp, angular icons with muted colors. A ‘relaxed’ mood might result in soft, rounded icons with bright, vibrant colors.
    *   **Icon ‘Animation’ layer:** Add a visual animation layer to icons which could be triggered based on the ‘mood’. The animation could be a glow, pulse, or subtle movement.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to:
    *   Customize the visual style presets.
    *   Adjust the sensitivity of the mood inference engine.
    *   Create custom icon morphing rules.
    *   Disable the feature entirely.
*   **Connectivity-Based Fallback:** Revert to the original patent’s functionality if mood inference is unavailable (sensors disabled, system error, etc.).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
While (Device is On) {
    //Sensor Data Collection
    sensorData = CollectSensorData();

    //Mood Inference
    mood = InferMood(sensorData);

    //Predictive Icon Generation
    predictedIcons = PredictIcons(mood, timeOfDay, location, userHistory);

    //Icon Morphing
    morphedIcons = MorphIcons(predictedIcons, mood);

    //Display Icons
    DisplayIcons(morphedIcons);
}

Function MorphIcons(predictedIcons, mood) {
    For Each icon In predictedIcons {
        //Lookup Morph Parameters for Icon
        morphParams = LookupMorphParams(icon, mood);

        //Apply Morph Parameters
        morphedIcon = ApplyMorphParams(icon, morphParams);

        //Add Animation
        animatedIcon = AddAnimation(morphedIcon, mood);

        //Return Icon
        Return animatedIcon
    }
}
```
