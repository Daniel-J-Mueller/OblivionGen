## Dynamic Complexity Scaling for Video Streams

**Concept:** Introduce a system where video stream complexity (e.g., motion estimation depth, transform size) isn’t just adjusted based on bandwidth or device capability, but dynamically adapts *within* a single stream based on viewer attention and perceived cognitive load.

**Specs:**

**1. Attention/Cognitive Load Sensor Integration:**

*   **Input:** Integrate data from external sensors (e.g., eye trackers, EEG headsets, pupillometry) or utilize computer vision algorithms (facial expression analysis, gaze tracking via webcam) to estimate viewer attention level and cognitive load.
*   **Metrics:** Defined metrics:
    *   *Attention Score* (0-100): Based on gaze direction, blink rate, pupil dilation, facial muscle activity.
    *   *Cognitive Load Index* (0-100): Derived from EEG data (if available), or estimated from facial expression analysis (e.g., brow furrowing, lip compression).

**2. Complexity Scaling Engine:**

*   **Core Function:** Adjust encoding parameters *during* stream generation based on real-time attention/cognitive load data.
*   **Parameters Controlled:**
    *   *Motion Estimation Depth:* Lower depth = less computational complexity, simpler scenes. Higher depth = more detail, complex scenes.
    *   *Transform Size:* Smaller transforms = faster encoding/decoding, reduced detail. Larger transforms = higher detail, increased complexity.
    *   *Quantization Level:* Adjust quantization level to control bit rate and visual quality, balancing detail with bandwidth.
    *   *Scene Change Detection Enhancement:* Increase complexity near scene changes to emphasize key visuals, reduce it during extended, static scenes.
*   **Scaling Logic:**
    *   *High Attention/Low Cognitive Load:* Maintain or increase stream complexity for immersive experience.
    *   *Low Attention/High Cognitive Load:* Reduce stream complexity to minimize distractions and processing burden.
    *   *Adaptive Thresholds:* Dynamically adjust scaling thresholds based on individual viewer profiles and content characteristics.

**3. Client-Side Implementation:**

*   **Sensor Integration Module:** Receive and process data from external sensors or webcam.
*   **Attention/Cognitive Load Estimation Module:** Calculate Attention Score and Cognitive Load Index.
*   **Communication Module:** Transmit attention/cognitive load data to the server.
*   **Stream Adaptation Module:** Receive adapted stream from server and decode it.

**4. Server-Side Implementation:**

*   **Stream Generator:** Responsible for generating multiple video streams with varying complexity levels.
*   **Complexity Scaling Engine:** Analyzes attention/cognitive load data and selects the appropriate stream or adjusts encoding parameters in real-time.
*   **Manifest Generator:** Generates a dynamic manifest file that reflects the currently selected stream and encoding parameters.
*   **Communication Module:** Transmits manifest file and adapted stream to the client.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side – Simplified):**

```
function processClientData(clientId, attentionScore, cognitiveLoadIndex) {
  content = getContentForClient(clientId);

  if (attentionScore > 75 && cognitiveLoadIndex < 30) {
    streamComplexity = "High"
  } else if (attentionScore < 25 || cognitiveLoadIndex > 75) {
    streamComplexity = "Low"
  } else {
    streamComplexity = "Medium"
  }

  adaptedStream = generateStream(content, streamComplexity);
  manifestFile = createManifest(adaptedStream);
  sendToClient(clientId, manifestFile, adaptedStream);
}

```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simply adapting to bandwidth or device capabilities to *actively respond to the viewer’s cognitive state*. It introduces a feedback loop that aims to optimize the viewing experience not just for visual quality, but for cognitive ease. This could have applications in education, accessibility, and entertainment.
