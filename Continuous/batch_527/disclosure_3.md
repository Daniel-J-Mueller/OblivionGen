**Dynamic Environmental Storytelling via Procedural Detail Generation**

**Concept:** Extend the room modification system to include procedurally generated details *within* the modified spaces, driven by user-defined thematic "story seeds." This moves beyond static room layout to dynamic environmental storytelling.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** "Story Weaver" – a module integrated with the existing room modification system.
*   **Input:** User provides a short text prompt, or selects from a pre-defined list (e.g., "Abandoned Laboratory," "Cozy Cottage," "Space Pirate's Quarters," "Victorian Study"). This is the "story seed."
*   **Procedural Generation Engine:**  A rules-based engine coupled with an asset library. This engine interprets the story seed and generates details – object placement, textures, lighting, sounds – consistent with the theme.  The engine prioritizes details *within* the already-modified room geometry.
*   **Detail Layers:** Divide details into layers:
    *   **Clutter Layer:** Small objects (books, tools, debris) procedurally placed on surfaces.
    *   **Surface Detail Layer:** Procedural application of wear and tear, grime, or specific textures to walls, floors, and ceilings.
    *   **Atmospheric Layer:** Procedural control of lighting, fog, and ambient sounds.
    *   **Interactive Layer:**  Procedural placement of interactive elements (e.g., a flickering light, a radio playing static).  Triggered by user proximity.
*   **Parameter Control:** Provide users with sliders to adjust the "intensity" of each layer (e.g., "Clutter Density," "Wear and Tear Level," "Atmospheric Mood").
*   **Style Presets:** Offer pre-configured style presets that influence the type of details generated (e.g., "Realistic," "Cartoonish," "Sci-Fi").
*   **Adaptation to User Modifications:** The engine *reacts* to user room modifications.  If the user moves a wall, the engine regenerates details in the affected area, ensuring consistency.
*   **Multi-User Storytelling:** Enable multiple users to collaboratively contribute to the story seed and modify the environment in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Story Weaver Engine - Simplified):**

```
function generateDetails(roomGeometry, storySeed, intensitySliders) {

  // 1. Parse storySeed and extract keywords
  keywords = parseStorySeed(storySeed);

  // 2. Load relevant asset library based on keywords
  assets = loadAssets(keywords);

  // 3. Clutter Layer
  if (intensitySliders.clutterDensity > 0) {
    for (i = 0; i < intensitySliders.clutterDensity; i++) {
      // Select random asset from clutter category
      asset = selectRandomAsset(assets.clutter);
      // Find random surface point within room geometry
      surfacePoint = findRandomSurfacePoint(roomGeometry);
      // Place asset at surface point with random rotation
      placeAsset(asset, surfacePoint, randomRotation());
    }
  }

  // 4. Surface Detail Layer
  if (intensitySliders.wearAndTear > 0) {
    applyWearAndTear(roomGeometry, intensitySliders.wearAndTear);
  }

  // 5. Atmospheric Layer
  setLightingMood(intensitySliders.atmosphericMood);
  setAmbientSound(intensitySliders.atmosphericMood);

  // 6. Interactive Layer
  placeInteractiveElements(roomGeometry);
}
```

**New Innovation:**

This moves beyond passive environmental creation to active environmental storytelling.  Users aren't just building rooms; they're crafting experiences. The procedural generation ensures that the details are contextually relevant to the user's vision, and the dynamic adaptation keeps the environment cohesive even as it's modified.  The multi-user aspect introduces collaborative storytelling possibilities.
