## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Layer

**Concept:** Extend the media presentation system to incorporate real-time biometric data and dynamically adjust the media experience to maximize emotional impact and engagement.

**Specifications:**

*   **Biometric Input:** System integrates with wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers, EEG headsets) to collect real-time data: heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance (GSR), brainwave activity (EEG), facial muscle activity (EMG).
*   **Emotional State Modeling:**  A machine learning model (trained on a large dataset correlating biometric data with self-reported emotional states) estimates the user’s current emotional state (e.g., joy, sadness, fear, anger, relaxation).  Output: a vector representing the probability of each emotional state.
*   **Media Feature Mapping:**  Define a mapping between emotional states and media features. Examples:
    *   **High Anxiety (HRV low, GSR high):**  Decrease tempo, shift to warmer color palettes, introduce soothing soundscapes, offer narrative pauses.
    *   **Low Engagement (HRV stable, GSR low):** Increase tempo, introduce dynamic camera angles, increase audio complexity, provide narrative foreshadowing.
    *   **High Joy (HRV high, GSR moderate):** Maintain current tempo, emphasize vibrant colors, increase audio clarity.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Engine:**  A rule-based system (or a reinforcement learning agent) uses the estimated emotional state and media feature mapping to dynamically adjust the presentation of the media. Adjustments include:
    *   **Audio Mixing:**  Adjust volume levels of different audio tracks (music, dialogue, sound effects). Implement dynamic equalization.
    *   **Visual Effects:**  Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, color grading. Apply subtle visual filters.  Adjust animation speed.
    *   **Narrative Pacing:**  Introduce brief pauses or accelerate the narrative flow.  Alter the order of scenes (where feasible). Insert optional content/side stories.
    *   **Haptic Feedback:** Utilize wearable haptic devices to provide subtle vibrations or pulses synchronized with the media (e.g., a gentle vibration during a suspenseful moment).
*   **Break Point Integration:** The system should intelligently integrate with the existing ‘break point’ functionality from the patent.  Emotional state can *trigger* a break point to occur earlier or later than scheduled, or introduce an unexpected break for emotional processing. For example, a surge in fear could automatically introduce a brief pause followed by a calming interlude.
*   **User Profiling & Adaptation:** The system should learn user preferences over time. Track the correlation between emotional responses and media adjustments. Adjust the emotional state modeling and media feature mapping to personalize the experience for each user.
*   **Emotional ‘Intensity’ Control:** A user-adjustable slider to control the overall intensity of emotional manipulation.  Higher intensity = more aggressive adjustments.  Lower intensity = more subtle adjustments.
*   **Notification Handling:** Apply emotional state modeling to incoming notifications.  Notifications deemed ‘urgent’ (based on content and user context) should bypass emotional filtering and be presented immediately.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Adjustment Engine):**

```
function adjust_media(current_media_state, emotional_state, user_profile):
  emotional_intensity = user_profile.emotional_intensity

  // Calculate adjustment values based on emotional state and intensity
  audio_volume_adjustment = emotional_state.sadness * -5dB * emotional_intensity
  visual_saturation_adjustment = emotional_state.fear * 0.2 * emotional_intensity
  narrative_pacing_adjustment = emotional_state.boredom * 0.8 * emotional_intensity // Increase pace

  // Apply adjustments to the current media state
  current_media_state.audio.volume += audio_volume_adjustment
  current_media_state.visual.saturation += visual_saturation_adjustment
  current_media_state.narrative.pacing *= narrative_pacing_adjustment

  return current_media_state
```
