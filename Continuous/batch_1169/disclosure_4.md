## Dynamic Beacon Mesh Networking for Environmental Sensing

**Concept:** Expand the beaconing system beyond simple device discovery and activation to create a self-organizing, dynamic mesh network for hyperlocal environmental data collection and dissemination.

**Specifications:**

**1. Beacon Payload Expansion:**

*   **Data Fields:** Beyond device identification and communication channel type, beacons will include:
    *   Timestamp (precise, synchronized across the mesh).
    *   Sensor Readings: Temperature, humidity, air quality (CO2, VOCs), light levels, noise levels – configurable sensor suite.
    *   Battery Level (of the beaconing device).
    *   Hop Count: Indicates the number of hops the beacon has traveled through the mesh.
    *   Signal Strength (RSSI) – for mesh topology mapping.
*   **Data Compression:** Implement a lightweight data compression algorithm to minimize beacon size.
*   **Encryption:** Secure beacon data with AES-128 encryption.

**2. Mesh Networking Protocol:**

*   **Routing Algorithm:**  Implement a distributed, adaptive routing algorithm (e.g., AODV or similar) to determine the optimal path for beacon propagation.  Prioritize paths with strong signal strength and minimal hop count.
*   **Beacon Relay:** Devices receiving beacons will retransmit them, acting as nodes in the mesh network.
*   **Dynamic Topology:** The mesh network will dynamically adapt to changes in device availability, signal strength, and environmental conditions.
*   **Redundancy:** Implement redundancy mechanisms to ensure data delivery even if some nodes fail.
*   **Gateway Nodes:**  Designate specific nodes as “gateway nodes” to connect the mesh network to external networks (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular).

**3. Data Aggregation & Analysis:**

*   **Edge Computing:**  Gateway nodes will perform local data aggregation and analysis to reduce bandwidth requirements and latency.
*   **Data Filtering:** Implement data filtering algorithms to remove outliers and noise.
*   **Trend Analysis:**  Gateway nodes will perform basic trend analysis to identify patterns and anomalies in the environmental data.
*   **Cloud Integration:**  Gateway nodes will transmit aggregated data to a cloud platform for long-term storage and advanced analysis.

**4. Device Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Low-Power Transceiver:** Utilize a low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) transceiver (e.g., LoRa, Sigfox) for long-range communication.
*   **Microcontroller:**  Employ a microcontroller with sufficient processing power and memory to handle data processing and communication.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a configurable sensor suite to collect environmental data.
*   **Power Source:** Utilize a battery or energy harvesting solution to power the device.

**Pseudocode (Gateway Node Data Aggregation):**

```
FUNCTION aggregateData(receivedBeaconList):
  dataPoints = []
  FOR each beacon IN receivedBeaconList:
    IF beacon.timestamp > lastProcessedTimestamp:
      dataPoints.append(beacon.sensorReadings)
      lastProcessedTimestamp = beacon.timestamp

  filteredData = applyOutlierFilter(dataPoints)

  averageTemperature = calculateAverage(filteredData.temperature)
  averageHumidity = calculateAverage(filteredData.humidity)

  # Other calculations...

  sendToCloud(averageTemperature, averageHumidity, ...)

  RETURN filteredData
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart Cities: Monitor air quality, noise levels, and traffic patterns.
*   Precision Agriculture: Monitor soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels.
*   Environmental Monitoring: Track pollution levels and wildlife populations.
*   Disaster Response: Provide real-time environmental data during emergencies.
