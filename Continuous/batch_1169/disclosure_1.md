## Adaptive Lease Granularity with Predictive Renewal

**Concept:** The patent focuses on lease-based consistency. This design explores *dynamically* adjusting lease duration based on predicted read/write load *and* introducing predictive lease renewal to minimize downtime during failover scenarios. It moves beyond a fixed TTL.

**Specs:**

**1. Monitoring & Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Monitor read/write request rates per data shard/table, network latency between nodes, CPU/memory utilization of database nodes, and historical request patterns.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future read/write load for each data shard/table over the next 'n' seconds.  'n' is configurable, defaulting to 60 seconds.
*   **Granularity:**  Load prediction is performed at the *shard* level.
*   **Output:** Predicted read/write requests/second for each shard, and a confidence interval.

**2. Adaptive Lease Duration Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Predicted read/write requests/second, confidence interval, current lease duration.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **High Load (predicted requests > threshold_high):** Shorten lease duration (e.g., to 1 second). Prioritize consistency, tolerate more frequent lease renewals.
    *   **Medium Load (threshold_low < predicted requests < threshold_high):** Maintain current lease duration.
    *   **Low Load (predicted requests < threshold_low):** Extend lease duration (e.g., to 60 seconds or more). Reduce renewal overhead.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** `threshold_high` and `threshold_low` are configurable per shard, and can be automatically adjusted based on historical load patterns.

**3. Predictive Lease Renewal:**

*   **Mechanism:**  Before the *current* lease expires, a new lease is *pre-emptively* requested. This is done ‘t’ seconds before expiration (where ‘t’ is configurable, defaulting to 2 seconds).
*   **Lease Chaining:** The new lease request includes a ‘chaining token’ from the previous lease. This allows the system to verify that the pre-emptive request is valid and prevents replay attacks.
*   **Failover Handling:** Upon failover to a secondary node:
    *   The secondary node immediately attempts to obtain a lease using the ‘chaining token’ from the last known good lease.
    *   If successful, the secondary node can immediately begin serving requests without waiting for the lease TTL to expire, minimizing downtime.
    *   If the token is invalid (e.g., due to a long failover), a full lease acquisition process is initiated.

**4. System Components:**

*   **Lease Manager:** Centralized service responsible for managing lease requests, renewals, and invalidations.
*   **Monitoring Agent:**  Deployed on each database node, collects performance metrics and sends them to the Monitoring Service.
*   **Monitoring Service:**  Aggregates metrics from all nodes and feeds them to the Prediction Module.
*   **Prediction Module:** Implements the time-series forecasting model and provides load predictions to the Lease Manager.

**Pseudocode (Lease Manager):**

```
function process_read_request(request):
  snapshot_time = request.snapshot_time
  lease = get_current_lease()

  if lease is null:
    #Handle no lease - return error or stall request
    return error

  if snapshot_time < lease.expiration_time:
    #Process request based on snapshot
    process_request_with_snapshot(request, snapshot_time)
  else:
    #Reject request - lease expired
    return error

function renew_lease():
  #Get current lease info (shard ID, current expiration)
  shard_id = get_shard_id()
  predicted_load = get_predicted_load(shard_id)
  new_ttl = calculate_ttl(predicted_load)

  #Request new lease with calculated TTL
  new_lease = request_new_lease(shard_id, new_ttl)

  #Update current lease with new lease
  update_current_lease(new_lease)
```

**Potential Benefits:** Reduced latency, improved consistency, minimized downtime during failover, increased system resilience, and optimized resource utilization.
