## Dynamic Partitioning via Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend database partitioning beyond reactive splitting (triggered by size/rate thresholds) to *proactive* partitioning based on predicted query load.  Instead of waiting for a partition to become overloaded, predict future load and preemptively split the partition *before* performance degradation occurs.

**Specs:**

*   **Load Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Historical query logs (timestamp, query type, data accessed), system resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O), time-of-day, day-of-week.
    *   Process: Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict query load (queries/second, data scan size) for each partition over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 5-15 minutes).  Model should be trained and updated continuously.  Incorporate seasonality (daily/weekly patterns) and trend analysis.
    *   Output: Predicted load curve for each partition, indicating expected query volume and data access patterns.

*   **Partitioning Policy Engine:**
    *   Input: Predicted load curves, partition size, current resource utilization, configurable thresholds (e.g., maximum acceptable latency, target CPU utilization).
    *   Process:  Compare predicted load to configurable thresholds.  If predicted load exceeds thresholds, initiate a partition split. The engine *should not* rely on simple thresholds alone. It should also consider the *rate of change* of the predicted load.  A rapidly increasing load warrants a preemptive split, even if the current load is still within acceptable limits.  The split point should be determined as in the reference patent (median value).
    *   Output: Split decision (yes/no), target partition split point.

*   **Adaptive Sampling:**
    *   Process: Instead of using a fixed sample size for determining the median value, adapt the sample size based on data volatility.  Higher data volatility (e.g., frequent updates/inserts) necessitates a larger sample size to ensure accurate median determination.  Estimate data volatility by tracking the rate of data modification within each partition.
    *   Output: Sample size to use for median determination.

*   **Dynamic Re-Partitioning:**
    *   Process: Continuously monitor actual load after a partition split. If actual load does not align with predictions (e.g., split was unnecessary or insufficient), dynamically adjust partitioning (e.g., merge split partitions, further split a partition). This requires a feedback loop between the load prediction module, partitioning policy engine, and a monitoring system.

*   **Resource Aware Splitting:**
    *   Process: Before initiating a split, assess available system resources (CPU, memory, I/O bandwidth). If resources are constrained, delay the split or throttle the data copy process to avoid impacting other operations.  This could involve prioritizing splits based on predicted impact (e.g., split a partition that will alleviate a critical bottleneck).

**Pseudocode (Partitioning Policy Engine):**

```
function determine_split(predicted_load, partition_size, thresholds, resources):
  if predicted_load.rate_of_change > high_threshold:
    split_decision = True
  elif predicted_load > high_threshold:
    split_decision = True
  elif predicted_load > medium_threshold and partition_size > large_threshold:
    split_decision = True
  else:
    split_decision = False

  if split_decision:
    if resources.available() < minimum_required:
      delay_split()
      return

    split_point = determine_median(partition)
    initiate_split(partition, split_point)

  return
```
