## Adaptive Network Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the per-device virtual network isolation to encompass dynamic “network personas” – behavioral profiles that automatically adjust network access and restrictions based on observed device activity and pre-defined security/utility policies.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Definition Module:**

*   **Input:**  Device type (identified automatically), user-defined policy templates (e.g., “Guest,” “IoT,” “Critical Server”), real-time device behavior data (network traffic analysis, resource utilization, application usage, observed vulnerabilities).
*   **Process:** Assigns a primary persona to each device. This persona dictates baseline network access rules. The system constantly monitors device behavior. Deviations from expected behavior (as defined by the persona) trigger dynamic adjustments to network access.
*   **Output:**  Dynamically updated network access control lists (ACLs) for each device.  Persona score (0-100) representing how closely the device aligns with its assigned persona.

**2. Behavioral Monitoring Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:** Network packet inspection (deep packet inspection/DPI), system logs (where accessible), endpoint telemetry (resource usage, running processes).
*   **Analysis Techniques:**  Anomaly detection (statistical modeling, machine learning), signature-based intrusion detection, heuristic analysis.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Network traffic volume/pattern
    *   Destination IPs/ports
    *   Application usage
    *   CPU/Memory usage
    *   File system access (where applicable)
*   **Output:** Real-time behavioral data, anomaly scores, potential threat indicators.

**3. Dynamic ACL Adjustment:**

*   **Triggers:**
    *   Anomaly score exceeds a defined threshold.
    *   Detection of known malicious activity.
    *   Deviation from established behavioral patterns.
    *   Policy updates (e.g., new security threats).
*   **Actions:**
    *   Restrict network access (e.g., block specific IPs/ports).
    *   Quarantine the device on a separate virtual network.
    *   Throttle bandwidth.
    *   Trigger automated security responses (e.g., endpoint isolation).
    *   Log the event for investigation.

**4.  Persona Management Interface:**

*   **Features:**
    *   Persona creation and customization.
    *   Policy definition (rules for network access, security, and utility).
    *   Real-time monitoring of device personas and behavior.
    *   Alerting and reporting.
    *   Manual override controls.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//For each device on the network:
Device = new Device(deviceID, deviceType);
Persona = selectDefaultPersona(deviceType);
Device.setPersona(Persona);

//Real-time monitoring loop:
while(networkActive){
    BehaviorData = getBehaviorData(Device);
    AnomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(BehaviorData, Device.Persona);

    if(AnomalyScore > threshold){
        newPersona = selectAdaptivePersona(Device, AnomalyScore); //Based on severity of deviation
        Device.setPersona(newPersona);
        updateACL(Device);
        logEvent(Device, “Persona change triggered by anomaly”);
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple virtual network isolation by adding a dynamic, behavioral component. Instead of static rules, the system adapts to the *actual* behavior of each device, providing a more robust and adaptive security posture. It shifts the focus from *who* the device is, to *what* it's doing.
