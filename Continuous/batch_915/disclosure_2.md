## Dynamic Query Plan 'Splitting' via Predictive Analysis

**Specification:** Implement a system to proactively ‘split’ a query plan *before* execution, based on predicted data characteristics and storage node load.  This goes beyond simply selecting alternate portions *during* execution (as the patent details).  Instead, we’ll aim to create multiple, specialized query plans *in parallel*, with a dynamic routing mechanism to send partial results to the optimal aggregation point.

**Components:**

1.  **Predictive Data Profiler (PDP):** A service that constantly monitors data access patterns, cardinality estimates, and data skew *before* a query is submitted. PDP uses historical data and machine learning to forecast characteristics of the data the query will touch. Output: A ‘Data Profile Vector’ (DPV) containing estimations for min/max values, standard deviation, common values, skewness, cardinality, and estimated size of intermediate results.

2.  **Plan Splitter:** Takes the initial query plan and the DPV as input. Based on pre-defined rules (configurable by administrators) and the DPV, the Plan Splitter generates multiple, specialized sub-plans.  These sub-plans will be variations of the original, optimized for different data subsets or computational strategies.  

    *   **Split Criteria:** Examples include:
        *   High data skew: Split the plan to process the skewed data separately.
        *   Large cardinality: Split the plan to parallelize processing across multiple nodes.
        *   Known data locality: Split the plan to minimize data transfer.
    *   **Output:** A set of ‘Fragmented Plans’ (FPs). Each FP is a complete, executable query plan targeting a specific data subset or computational strategy.

3.  **Dynamic Router:** Monitors storage node load (CPU, memory, I/O) in real-time. It receives the FPs and the current node load. It then dynamically assigns each FP to the least loaded, most appropriate storage node for execution.

4.  **Aggregation Coordinator:** A service responsible for collecting partial results from the storage nodes, merging them, and returning the final result to the client. It must handle cases where partial results arrive out of order or with different levels of completeness.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Router):**

```
function assign_plan(fragmented_plan, node_load_data):
  best_node = null
  lowest_load = infinity

  for each node in node_list:
    load = calculate_combined_load(node.cpu, node.memory, node.io, fragmented_plan.estimated_cost)
    if load < lowest_load:
      lowest_load = load
      best_node = node

  send_plan_to_node(fragmented_plan, best_node)
  return best_node
```

**Workflow:**

1.  Client submits a query.
2.  Query engine generates an initial query plan.
3.  PDP analyzes the data the query will access and generates a DPV.
4.  Plan Splitter creates multiple FPs based on the DPV.
5.  Dynamic Router assigns each FP to the optimal storage node.
6.  Storage nodes execute their assigned FPs and send partial results to the Aggregation Coordinator.
7.  Aggregation Coordinator merges partial results and returns the final result to the client.

**Configuration:**

*   Administrators can configure the split criteria and the weights used to calculate node load.
*   The system should include monitoring tools to track the performance of the dynamic routing mechanism and identify potential bottlenecks.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved query performance by leveraging parallel processing and minimizing data transfer.
*   Increased system resilience by distributing the workload across multiple nodes.
*   Better resource utilization by dynamically adapting to changing system conditions.
*   Scalability, achieved by automatically distributing queries across available resources.
