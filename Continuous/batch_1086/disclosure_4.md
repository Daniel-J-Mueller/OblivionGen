## Dynamic Code Mutation for Robustness Testing

**Concept:** Leverage the transformer modelâ€™s understanding of code semantics to intelligently mutate code, creating a diverse test suite to identify edge cases and vulnerabilities beyond typical fuzzing or random mutation. This differs from simple syntactic mutation by focusing on *semantically valid* alterations, guided by the transformer.

**Specs:**

1.  **Mutation Engine:** A module that interfaces with the transformer model. It receives code as input and generates mutated versions.
2.  **Transformer Integration:** Utilize the encoder component of the existing transformer model.  Feed the code to the encoder. The encoder's internal representation (the encoder memory) is used to guide mutation.
3.  **Mutation Strategies:** Implement several mutation strategies, each leveraging different aspects of the encoder memory:
    *   **Semantic Replacement:** Identify code snippets (e.g., variable assignments, conditional expressions) with similar representations in the encoder memory (using cosine similarity). Replace the original snippet with the similar one.  This creates semantically equivalent, but syntactically different code.
    *   **Logical Inversion:**  Analyze conditional statements.  Use the encoder to identify the core logic. Invert the condition (e.g., `if (x > 5)` becomes `if (x <= 5)`).  The encoder helps ensure the inversion doesn't break core functionality.
    *   **API Parameter Shuffling:** For function calls, identify parameters with similar representations in the encoder memory. Shuffle the order of these parameters. The encoder helps avoid type mismatches or semantic errors.
    *   **Exception Injection:**  Identify lines of code with low confidence scores in the encoder memory (indicating potential ambiguity or fragility). Inject artificial exceptions (e.g., division by zero, null pointer dereference) on these lines.
4.  **Mutation Scoring:** Assign a "mutation score" to each generated mutant based on:
    *   **Semantic Distance:** Measure the semantic distance between the original code and the mutant using the encoder memory (cosine similarity). Higher distance = more diverse mutant.
    *   **Complexity Increase:**  Measure the increase in cyclomatic complexity of the mutant.  More complex mutants are more likely to reveal edge cases.
    *   **Confidence Score:**  Use the encoder's confidence score for the mutant. Lower confidence = more potentially problematic mutant.
5.  **Test Suite Generation:**  Select a diverse set of mutants based on their mutation scores.  Run these mutants against a comprehensive test suite.  Monitor for failures.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** Use the results of the test suite to refine the mutation strategies and the mutation scoring algorithm.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_mutants(code, num_mutants):
  encoder_memory = encode(code)
  mutants = []
  for i in range(num_mutants):
    mutation_strategy = select_random_strategy()
    mutant = apply_mutation(code, encoder_memory, mutation_strategy)
    mutation_score = calculate_mutation_score(code, mutant, encoder_memory)
    mutants.append((mutant, mutation_score))
  return mutants

function apply_mutation(code, encoder_memory, strategy):
  if strategy == "semantic_replacement":
    # find similar code snippet using encoder_memory
    # replace original snippet with similar one
  elif strategy == "logical_inversion":
    # find conditional statement
    # invert condition
  elif strategy == "api_parameter_shuffling":
    # find function call
    # shuffle parameters
  elif strategy == "exception_injection":
    # find fragile line of code
    # inject exception
  return mutated_code
```

**Potential Benefits:** More effective identification of vulnerabilities, improved code robustness, generation of realistic test cases. This approach moves beyond simply *finding* bugs to proactively *creating* conditions that reveal them.
