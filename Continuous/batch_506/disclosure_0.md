## Modular Docking Station with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** A docking station that dynamically adjusts its configuration *and* output based on user biofeedback, going beyond simple charging/data transfer. The station isn't just a *receiver* of devices, but an *interface* with the user's physiological state.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Modular Docking Array:**  A base unit containing a matrix of electromagnetic induction (EMI) & physical connectors.  Instead of fixed slots, the array consists of individually addressable EMI coils and retractable pins/USB-C ports.  The configuration is fluid - the system scans for device type/power needs and *morphs* the available connections accordingly.

2.  **Biofeedback Sensor Suite:** Integrated sensors (ECG, GSR, EEG – non-invasive) housed *within* the docking station’s contact surfaces.  These detect user's heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response, and potentially brainwave activity (alpha/theta bands) when a device is physically docked *and* the user touches the station.

3.  **Adaptive Power Delivery (APD) Unit:**  Not just wattage, but waveform. APD modulates the power delivery *profile* based on biofeedback.  High HRV/relaxed state = slower, trickle charge.  Low HRV/stressed = prioritized fast charge (within device limits).  Can also induce specific frequencies designed for bio-stimulation (e.g., alpha wave entrainment during charging).

4.  **Haptic/Thermal Interface:** The docking station's surface is capable of subtle haptic feedback (vibrations) and temperature adjustments. Used to reinforce biofeedback loops - e.g., gentle warmth during a relaxed state, subtle vibration to indicate peak charging efficiency.

5.  **Embedded AI Core:** Local AI processes biofeedback data, device identification, and manages the APD, haptic/thermal interfaces.  It *learns* user preferences and optimizes the docking experience over time.

**Pseudocode (AI Core – Adaptive Charging):**

```
// Input: Biofeedback Data (HRV, GSR, EEG), Device Type, Battery Level

function adaptCharging(bioData, deviceType, batteryLevel) {

  // 1. Biofeedback Analysis
  relaxationScore = calculateRelaxationScore(bioData); //High score = relaxed
  stressLevel = calculateStressLevel(bioData); // High score = stressed

  // 2. Charging Profile Selection
  if (relaxationScore > 0.7) {
    chargingMode = "slow_trickle";
    waveform = "sinusoidal_low_frequency"; //Promote relaxation
  } else if (stressLevel > 0.6) {
    chargingMode = "fast_boost";
    waveform = "pulsed_dc"; //Rapid energy delivery
  } else {
    chargingMode = "balanced";
    waveform = "standard_dc";
  }

  // 3. Dynamic Power Adjustment
  targetVoltage = calculateTargetVoltage(deviceType, batteryLevel, chargingMode);
  targetCurrent = calculateTargetCurrent(deviceType, batteryLevel, chargingMode);

  // 4. Thermal/Haptic Feedback
  if(relaxationScore > 0.8){
      setThermalOutput("warm");
      setHapticOutput("gentle_pulse");
  } else {
      setThermalOutput("neutral");
      setHapticOutput("off");
  }

  // 5. Output Control (Send signals to APD unit)
  apd.setVoltage(targetVoltage);
  apd.setCurrent(targetCurrent);

  return apd;
}
```
