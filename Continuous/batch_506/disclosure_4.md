## Adaptive Contextual Advertising via Multi-Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Expand offline ad presentation by leveraging onboard device sensors to dynamically select and present ads based on the user’s *current* environment and activity, even without network connectivity. This moves beyond simply adjusting ad selection based on historical connection data and towards real-time contextual relevance.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensor Integration Module:**

*   **Sensors:** Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Microphone, Ambient Light Sensor, GPS (when available), Bluetooth/Wi-Fi scanning (for proximity detection of known locations – stores, events – even without connection), Camera (for basic scene detection – *not* facial recognition – see ethics note).
*   **Data Fusion:** Kalman filter or similar sensor fusion algorithm to combine data streams and create a probabilistic representation of the user's context.  Output: Context Vector (CV).
    *   CV components: Activity (sedentary, walking, running, driving), Location (indoor/outdoor, general area – city/town/rural, proximity to Points of Interest (POI)), Ambient Conditions (light level, noise level), Device Orientation/Motion.

**2. Contextual Ad Database:**

*   **Ad Metadata:** Each ad will have associated metadata tags beyond standard demographics/interests. These tags *must* include contextual relevance indicators.
    *   Context Tags: Activity tags (running, commuting, relaxing), Location tags (gym, coffee shop, home, park, specific store ID), Environmental tags (bright, noisy, quiet, dark), Temporal tags (morning, evening, weekend).  Tag weights will allow for nuanced matching.
*   **Database Structure:**  Key-value store optimized for fast lookup based on CV components.

**3. Offline Ad Selection Engine:**

*   **Input:** Current Context Vector (CV) from Sensor Integration Module.
*   **Matching Algorithm:**  Weighted sum of tag matches between CV and ad metadata.  Higher weights for more critical contextual factors.
    *   Score = Σ (CV<sub>i</sub> * AdTag<sub>i</sub> * Weight<sub>i</sub>)  where:
        *   CV<sub>i</sub> = Value of CV component i
        *   AdTag<sub>i</sub> = Value of AdTag component i
        *   Weight<sub>i</sub> = Weight assigned to that component.
*   **Ad Ranking:**  Ads are ranked based on their calculated scores.
*   **Impression Threshold Handling:**  The existing impression threshold mechanism is retained, but dynamically adjusted based on contextual relevance.  Highly relevant ads may have a higher effective impression threshold.

**4.  Adaptive Impression Scheduling:**

*   **Real-time Adjustment:** The frequency of ad presentation is dynamically adjusted based on the user's activity.  Example:  Higher frequency during low-activity periods (e.g., waiting at a bus stop); lower frequency during high-activity periods (e.g., running).
*   **Interruption Sensitivity:** Algorithm to minimize ad interruptions during critical activity periods (e.g., phone calls, navigation).

**5.  Data Reporting (when connection available):**

*   **Contextual Data Logging:** Log contextual data alongside ad impressions. This data is used to improve ad targeting models and contextual relevance weighting.
*   **Anonymized Data Transmission:** Ensure all data transmission complies with privacy regulations.

**Pseudocode (Ad Selection):**

```
function selectAd(contextVector, adDatabase) {
  rankedAds = []
  for each ad in adDatabase {
    score = calculateAdScore(contextVector, ad)
    rankedAds.add(ad, score)
  }
  rankedAds.sort(descending by score)
  return rankedAds[0] // Return highest scoring ad
}

function calculateAdScore(contextVector, ad) {
  score = 0
  for each tag in ad.tags {
    weight = tag.weight
    match = contextVector.matches(tag) //returns a value between 0 and 1
    score += match * weight
  }
  return score
}
```

**Ethical Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  No personally identifiable information should be collected or transmitted without explicit user consent.  All sensor data should be anonymized.
*   **Transparency:** Users should be informed about how their sensor data is being used for ad targeting.
*   **Camera Usage:** Camera data should be *strictly* limited to basic scene detection (e.g., identifying a park or a gym). Facial recognition is prohibited.  Image processing should be performed locally on the device.
*   **Interruption Avoidance:**  The algorithm should prioritize minimizing interruptions during critical activities.
*   **User Control:** Users should have the ability to disable contextual ad targeting and/or opt-out of data collection.
