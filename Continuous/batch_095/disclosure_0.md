**Dynamic UI Control Morphing Based on Predictive User Need**

**Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Expand upon the idea of custom UI controls by introducing a system where these controls *morph* in functionality and presentation based on a predictive model of user need, anticipating actions before explicit selection. This is achieved by analyzing user behavior, contextual data, and historical patterns.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard computing device with touchscreen display (phone, tablet, desktop with touchscreen)
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time analysis and UI rendering.
*   Network connectivity for data synchronization and model updates.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Analytics Engine:**
    *   Tracks user interactions (taps, swipes, dwell time, etc.).
    *   Monitors contextual data (location, time of day, calendar events, active applications).
    *   Builds a user profile representing preferences and typical behaviors.
    *   Employs machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to predict the next likely action.

2.  **Dynamic UI Control Manager:**
    *   Manages all custom UI controls.
    *   Receives predictions from the Behavioral Analytics Engine.
    *   Dynamically alters the function and appearance of UI controls based on predictions.
    *   Prioritizes relevant controls and presents them prominently.
    *   Supports morphing of control size, shape, color, and associated actions.

3.  **Action Library:**
    *   A repository of predefined actions.
    *   Each action is associated with a set of parameters and conditions.
    *   The Dynamic UI Control Manager selects appropriate actions based on the prediction and current context.

4.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitors user responses to dynamic control changes.
    *   Adjusts the prediction model and control morphing rules based on feedback.
    *   Continually refines the user experience.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (user is active) {
  user_interaction = get_user_input()
  contextual_data = get_contextual_data()
  prediction = behavioral_analytics_engine.predict_next_action(user_interaction, contextual_data)

  // Update UI Controls
  for each control in ui_controls {
    if (control matches prediction) {
      control.morph(prediction.action, prediction.parameters) // Change appearance and functionality
      control.prioritize() // Bring to the forefront
    } else {
      control.deprioritize() // Push back in hierarchy
    }
  }

  // Get user response
  user_response = get_user_response()
  behavioral_analytics_engine.update_model(user_response)
}
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user frequently orders coffee at 8:00 AM. At 7:55 AM, the coffee ordering UI control morphs, displaying the user’s usual order prominently and offering a one-tap “Reorder” option. The control might also suggest nearby coffee shops based on location. If the user ignores the suggestion, the control reverts to its normal state.

**Novelty:**

This differs from the provided patent in that it doesn't just handle discrepancies in pricing or availability. Instead, it proactively anticipates the user’s needs, dynamically altering the UI to facilitate actions before the user explicitly requests them. It's a move from reactive adjustment to *predictive adaptation*.
