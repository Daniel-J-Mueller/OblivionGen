## Haptic Projection via Tunable Capacitive Field Resonance

**System Overview:** A system to project localized haptic feedback onto objects placed on or near a capacitive touchscreen, *without* direct physical contact from actuators. This builds upon the idea of tuning capacitive fields, but shifts the goal from simply *detecting* touch, to *creating* a perceived sensation.

**Core Principle:**  By precisely controlling the frequency and amplitude of the capacitive field emitted by the touchscreen, and exploiting the resonant frequencies of materials within the object being touched, we can induce subtle vibrations within the object itself. These vibrations, even at micro-scale, are perceivable as texture or force feedback.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **High-Frequency Capacitive Array:**  A touchscreen with a significantly higher refresh rate and more granular capacitive sensor array than current technology.  (Minimum 1kHz refresh, 10mm sensor pitch). This allows for complex field shaping.
*   **Resonance Mapping Database:**  A stored database of material resonant frequencies. This database is populated via initial object identification (using fiducial markers as in the provided patent), and potentially expanded via real-time analysis of reflected capacitive signals.
*   **Signal Generator & Amplifier:**  High-precision signal generator capable of producing a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes, coupled with a high-fidelity amplifier to drive the capacitive array.
*   **Real-Time Signal Processing Unit:** A dedicated processor (FPGA or DSP) to perform the calculations necessary to shape and modulate the capacitive field in real-time.
*   **Object Identification System:** Existing fiducial system as described in the patent, for initial material identification.

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Object Identification & Material Database Lookup:** Upon object placement, the fiducial system identifies the object. This identifier is used to lookup the material composition and associated resonant frequencies from the database.  If no direct match is found, the algorithm attempts to extrapolate from similar materials.
2.  **Resonant Frequency Sweep:**  A low-power sweep of the capacitive field across a range of frequencies is performed, focused on the predicted resonant frequencies of the object’s materials. This is a 'listening' phase to refine the frequency prediction.
3.  **Field Shaping & Modulation:** Based on the refined frequency prediction, the signal processing unit calculates the optimal capacitive field distribution to create the desired haptic effect. Algorithms should include:
    *   **Localized Vibration:** Create a focused vibration at a specific point on the object’s surface. Pseudocode:
        ```
        function create_localized_vibration(x, y, amplitude, frequency) {
          // Calculate the capacitive sensor elements nearest to (x, y)
          sensors = find_nearest_sensors(x, y);

          // Calculate the phase and amplitude modulation for each sensor
          for each sensor in sensors {
            // Calculate distance from the target point
            distance = calculate_distance(sensor.location, (x,y));

            // Apply inverse distance weighting to the amplitude
            sensor.amplitude = amplitude / distance;

            // Apply phase shift based on distance to create a traveling wave
            sensor.phase = (distance * frequency * 2 * PI) % (2 * PI);
          }
          //Apply to capacitive array
        }
        ```

    *   **Texture Simulation:** Rapidly modulate the frequency and amplitude of the capacitive field to create the illusion of texture.  Employ a noise function (e.g., Perlin noise) to generate a dynamic pattern.
    *   **Force Feedback:** Create a localized increase in capacitive force to simulate resistance or pressure. This can be achieved by increasing the amplitude of the capacitive field at the point of contact.

4.  **Real-Time Adjustment:**  Monitor the reflected capacitive signal to detect changes in the object’s resonant frequency (due to temperature, pressure, or other factors). Adjust the capacitive field in real-time to maintain the desired haptic effect.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Power consumption is a critical consideration. Algorithms must be optimized to minimize energy usage.
*   Safety measures must be implemented to prevent unintended effects on sensitive electronics.
*   The system should be designed to be compatible with a wide range of materials and object shapes.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced gaming experience (simulating textures, impacts, etc.).
*   Assistive technology for visually impaired users (providing tactile feedback).
*   Product design and prototyping (simulating the feel of materials).
*   Remote manipulation of objects.
