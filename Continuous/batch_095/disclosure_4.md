## Dynamic Schema Stitching for Federated Queries

**Concept:** Extend the key overloading concept to enable querying across *different* database systems with disparate schemas, effectively creating a unified, virtual schema on-the-fly based on query intent.

**Specification:**

**1. Component Overview:**

*   **Query Intent Analyzer:** Receives the user query and analyzes it to determine the required data attributes and relationships. This component uses semantic understanding and potentially machine learning to map query terms to corresponding schema elements across the federated data sources.
*   **Schema Stitcher:**  Constructs a virtual schema tailored to the query.  It identifies relevant attributes from various data sources and defines relationships between them.  This involves data type mapping, unit conversion, and potentially value normalization.  The stitched schema is represented as a graph database.
*   **Key Derivation Engine:** Based on the stitched schema, the engine dynamically generates 'key derivation rules'. These rules define how to extract relevant key values from each source table, utilizing the key overloading principles described in the reference patent.  These rules dictate which attributes become part of the derived key and how they are combined.
*   **Federated Query Executor:**  Translates the original query into a set of sub-queries, one for each data source. It leverages the key derivation rules to construct the appropriate WHERE clauses and JOIN conditions. The executor then sends these sub-queries to the respective data sources in parallel.
*   **Result Assembler:** Receives the results from each data source, applies any necessary transformations or aggregations, and assembles them into a single, unified result set based on the original query.

**2. Data Structures:**

*   **Virtual Schema Graph:** A graph database storing the stitched schema. Nodes represent attributes, and edges represent relationships. Each node contains metadata about the attribute, including its data type, source table, and any applied transformations.
*   **Key Derivation Rule Set:** A collection of rules, one for each source table. Each rule specifies:
    *   Source Table Name
    *   Key Attributes (and their order)
    *   Transformation Functions (e.g., unit conversion, value normalization)
    *   Partition/Sort Key Specifications

**3. Pseudocode (Federated Query Execution):**

```
FUNCTION ExecuteFederatedQuery(query):
  intent = AnalyzeQueryIntent(query)
  virtualSchema = ConstructVirtualSchema(intent)
  keyDerivationRules = GenerateKeyDerivationRules(virtualSchema)

  subQueries = []
  FOR EACH sourceTable IN virtualSchema.tables:
    subQuery = ConstructSubQuery(query, sourceTable, keyDerivationRules[sourceTable])
    subQueries.append(subQuery)

  results = ExecuteSubQueriesInParallel(subQueries)
  unifiedResult = AssembleUnifiedResult(results, virtualSchema)
  RETURN unifiedResult
```

**4. Key Overloading Adaptation:**

The core idea of key overloading is adapted to handle heterogeneity. The `Key Derivation Rules` define *how* to map the desired query attributes to the overloaded key fields within each source table. For example:

*   Source Table A:  Has a "CustomerID" field.
*   Source Table B: Has a "UserAccount" field.

The `Key Derivation Rules` might specify that both fields are used as part of the overloaded key, effectively creating a unified user identifier.

**5. Innovation Points:**

*   **Dynamic Schema Evolution:** The virtual schema is constructed *on-demand* based on the query.
*   **Semantic Mapping:** Utilizes semantic understanding to map query terms to schema elements.
*   **Heterogeneous Key Integration:**  Combines keys from disparate sources using key overloading.
*   **Parallel Execution:**  Leverages parallel processing to accelerate query execution.
*   **Reduced Data Movement:**  The sub-queries are executed at the data source, minimizing data transfer.
