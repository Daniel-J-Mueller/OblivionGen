## Automated Pallet Load Profile Mapping & Dynamic Bonnet Adjustment

**Concept:** Integrate a 3D scanning system with the pallet jack cap system to automatically map the profile of the unit load *before* bonnet deployment. This data is then used to dynamically adjust the bonnetâ€™s shape and securing features for a customized fit, maximizing stability and minimizing product damage.

**System Specs:**

*   **3D Scanner:**  Mounted on the elevating vertical support assembly, positioned to scan the load profile after pallet engagement, but before bonnet descent.  
    *   Type: Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor or structured light scanner.  Resolution: Minimum 5cm accuracy.  Field of View:  Sufficient to capture the entire unit load (adjustable based on expected max load dimensions).
    *   Mounting: Pan/Tilt mechanism for full load coverage.
*   **Data Processing Unit (DPU):** Embedded controller within the pallet jack cap system.
    *   Software: Point cloud processing algorithms for noise filtering, feature extraction (load height, width, overhangs, fragile areas), and surface modeling.
    *   Data Storage:  Local storage for recent load profiles (up to 10), and wireless communication (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for data upload to a central system.
*   **Dynamic Bonnet System:**  Modular bonnet construction allowing for shape adaptation.
    *   **Articulating Frame Sections:** Bonnet frame comprised of multiple interconnected sections capable of independent movement (via miniature linear actuators).  Controlled by the DPU based on scan data.
    *   **Variable Density Securing Elements:** Replace fixed straps/nets with a matrix of individually controllable pneumatic clamps/supports. Clamp pressure adjusted dynamically based on load fragility (identified by scan data).
    *   **Soft Contact Pads:**  Replace hard contact points with deformable pads (e.g., silicone) for delicate items.  Pad pressure and position controlled by the DPU.
*   **Control Logic (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    //Initialization
    Scanner.Initialize()
    Bonnet.Initialize()

    //Load Engagement & Scanning
    PalletJack.EngagePallet()
    LoadProfile = Scanner.ScanLoad()

    //Data Analysis
    LoadHeight = LoadProfile.MaxHeight()
    LoadWidth = LoadProfile.MaxWidth()
    FragileAreas = LoadProfile.IdentifyFragileAreas()

    //Bonnet Adjustment
    Bonnet.AdjustHeight(LoadHeight)
    Bonnet.AdjustWidth(LoadWidth)

    FOR EACH FragileArea IN FragileAreas
        Bonnet.ActivateSoftContactPads(FragileArea)
        Bonnet.ReduceClampPressure(FragileArea)
    END FOR

    Bonnet.Lower()
    ```

*   **Power Requirements:** 24V DC (integrated with pallet jack battery)
*   **Safety Features:**
    *   Emergency Stop Button (disables all actuators)
    *   Obstacle Detection (using ultrasonic sensors)
    *   Load Weight Monitoring (to prevent overloading)



This system moves beyond simply *covering* a load. It actively *responds* to the load's characteristics, providing a customized and optimized securing solution, reducing damage and increasing stability during transport.
