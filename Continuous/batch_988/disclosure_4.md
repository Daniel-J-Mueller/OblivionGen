## Adaptive Behavioral Profiling with Generative Models

**Concept:** Extend the intent grouping and anomaly detection by employing generative AI models to *predict* likely user behavior sequences, not just identify deviations from historical norms. This allows for detection of nuanced anomalies, anticipatory security measures, and personalized experiences.

**Specs:**

**1. Generative Model Training:**

*   **Data Source:** Collect historical user path data (as in the patent) *and* contextual data (time of day, location – anonymized, device type, promotional offers seen, etc.).
*   **Model Type:** Utilize a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., a variant of GPT or similar).  The input sequence is a user’s recent path *plus* contextual data. The output is a probability distribution over possible next steps (hyperlink clicks, page views, checkout actions).
*   **Training Objective:** Maximize the likelihood of observed user paths given the contextual data.
*   **Model Personalization:** Implement a federated learning approach. Models are trained locally on each user’s data (privacy preserving) and then aggregated to improve global performance.  Optionally use few-shot learning to adapt quickly to new user behavior.

**2. Real-Time Path Prediction & Anomaly Scoring:**

*   **Input:** Track a user’s current path and gather relevant contextual data.
*   **Prediction:** Feed the current path & context into the generative model to obtain a probability distribution over possible next steps.
*   **Anomaly Score:** Calculate an anomaly score based on the predicted probability of the *actual* next step taken by the user.  Low probability = high anomaly score.  Implement a threshold for triggering alerts.  Alternatively, calculate the *KL divergence* between the predicted distribution and the actual observed action, representing deviation from expectation.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  Adapt the anomaly threshold based on user history and current system load.  Avoid false positives.

**3. Proactive Remediation & Personalization:**

*   **Fraud Prevention:**  High anomaly scores trigger fraud checks (e.g., multi-factor authentication, transaction review).
*   **Personalized Recommendations:**  Use the predicted probability distribution to suggest relevant content or offers that align with the user’s likely intent.
*   **Adaptive Interface:**  Dynamically adjust the user interface to prioritize actions predicted to be most likely, streamlining the user experience.
*    **Behavioral ‘Shadowing’**: If a statistically significant deviation is detected, create a ‘shadow’ session on an alternative computing device to monitor the user's activity without direct intervention, providing increased data for analysis.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Scoring):**

```
function calculate_anomaly_score(user_path, context, model):
    predicted_distribution = model.predict(user_path, context)
    actual_action = user's_next_action()
    probability_of_action = predicted_distribution[actual_action]

    if probability_of_action < threshold:
        anomaly_score = 1 / probability_of_action # Higher score = more anomalous
    else:
        anomaly_score = 0

    return anomaly_score
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   GPU-accelerated servers for model training and inference.
*   Distributed data storage for historical path data.
*   Real-time data streaming platform for capturing user actions.
*   Machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Federated learning library.
