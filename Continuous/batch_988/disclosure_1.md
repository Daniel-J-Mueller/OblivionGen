**Dynamic File System Shadowing for Predictive Capacity Planning**

**Concept:** Extend the existing data metering system to proactively anticipate capacity needs by creating “shadow” file systems that mirror usage patterns but operate on synthetic data. This allows for stress-testing and predictive scaling *before* actual resource exhaustion.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component:** Shadow File System Generator (SFSG)
*   **Input:**
    *   Real-time file system usage data (from existing metering system). Includes: file creation/deletion rates, average file size, access patterns (read/write ratios, peak access times).
    *   Capacity planning parameters: Target buffer, scaling thresholds, predictive horizon (timeframe for prediction).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Pattern Extraction:** SFSG analyzes incoming usage data to identify dominant file system patterns. These patterns describe how storage is allocated and accessed.
    2.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** Based on extracted patterns, SFSG generates synthetic data sets mirroring real data characteristics (size distribution, access frequency). This data is *not* user data; it’s statistically equivalent.
    3.  **Shadow Instance Creation:** SFSG creates a shadow file system instance, populated with synthetic data. This instance operates in a separate, isolated environment.
    4.  **Stress Testing:** Simulate predicted future workloads on the shadow instance.
    5.  **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor shadow instance performance metrics: I/O latency, throughput, CPU utilization, memory usage.
    6.  **Capacity Prediction:** Extrapolate performance data to predict capacity needs (storage space, compute resources) for the actual file system.
    7.  **Alerting & Scaling:** Generate alerts when predicted capacity thresholds are approached. Trigger automated scaling operations (e.g., provision additional storage, increase compute capacity).
    8. **Dynamic Adjustment:** SFSG continuously monitors the original file system and dynamically adjusts the shadow instance’s workload and parameters to maintain predictive accuracy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateShadowInstance(usageData, planningParameters) {
  patterns = extractPatterns(usageData)
  syntheticData = generateSyntheticData(patterns)
  shadowInstance = createShadowInstance(syntheticData)
  return shadowInstance
}

function runSimulation(shadowInstance, workload) {
  applyWorkload(shadowInstance, workload)
  performanceData = monitorPerformance(shadowInstance)
  return performanceData
}

function predictCapacity(performanceData, planningParameters) {
  // Perform statistical analysis of performanceData
  // Extrapolate to predict future capacity needs
  predictedCapacity = calculatePredictedCapacity(performanceData, planningParameters)
  return predictedCapacity
}

function main() {
  usageData = getRealTimeUsageData()
  planningParameters = getPlanningParameters()
  shadowInstance = generateShadowInstance(usageData, planningParameters)
  while (true) {
    workload = generateFutureWorkload(usageData) //Predict future workload
    performanceData = runSimulation(shadowInstance, workload)
    predictedCapacity = predictCapacity(performanceData, planningParameters)
    if (predictedCapacity > threshold) {
      triggerScalingEvent()
    }
    updateShadowInstance(usageData) // Update with latest usage
  }
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Existing metering system integration.
*   Sufficient compute and storage resources to host shadow instances.
*   Workload generation tools to simulate realistic access patterns.
*   Monitoring tools to collect performance metrics.
*   Automated scaling infrastructure.
