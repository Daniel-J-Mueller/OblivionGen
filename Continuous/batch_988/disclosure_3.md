## Adaptive Sensor Fusion with Predictive Disagreement

**Concept:** Extend the confidence-based selective querying of a second hypothesis source by incorporating a predictive disagreement model *before* any data is sent. This allows for proactively identifying events where disagreement is highly probable, triggering more comprehensive data exchange and analysis.

**Specs:**

**1. Disagreement Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** First hypothesis (user action, item), first confidence value, raw sensor data stream (pre-processing stage). Historical event data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Train a separate model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or transformer) to predict the *likelihood of disagreement* between the two hypothesis sources. This model takes as input the first hypothesis, confidence value, and a time series representation of the raw sensor data leading up to the event. Historical data provides context for unusual event combinations.
    *   The disagreement prediction model is trained on the same data used to train the original likelihood of agreement model, plus additional data specifically labeled for instances of high disagreement.
    *   Output: A 'Disagreement Score' (0.0 - 1.0) representing the predicted probability of the second hypothesis source disagreeing with the first.

**2. Adaptive Data Exchange Protocol:**

*   **Thresholds:** Define multiple thresholds for the Disagreement Score:
    *   **Low Disagreement (Score < Threshold 1):** Only send minimal sensor data (as in the original patent).
    *   **Medium Disagreement (Threshold 1 <= Score < Threshold 2):** Send a reduced set of sensor data, prioritizing features most relevant to potential disagreement (identified through feature importance analysis during model training).
    *   **High Disagreement (Score >= Threshold 2):** Send the full sensor data stream, plus contextual historical event data. Trigger a request for *explanation* from the second hypothesis source â€“ not just a yes/no answer, but a justification for its determination.

**3. Enhanced Model Training:**

*   **Disagreement-Aware Loss Function:** Modify the loss function used to train the likelihood of agreement model to penalize incorrect predictions in cases of high disagreement more heavily. This forces the model to become more accurate in identifying potentially contentious events.
*   **Explanation Integration:** Use the explanations provided by the second hypothesis source as additional training data to refine both the likelihood of agreement model and the disagreement prediction model.

**Pseudocode (Disagreement Prediction Module):**

```python
def predict_disagreement(first_hypothesis, confidence_value, sensor_data, historical_data):
  # Preprocess sensor data (e.g., time series embedding)
  processed_sensor_data = preprocess(sensor_data)

  # Concatenate features
  features = [first_hypothesis, confidence_value] + processed_sensor_data + historical_data

  # Pass features through disagreement prediction model
  disagreement_score = disagreement_model.predict(features)

  return disagreement_score
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced communication overhead by selectively sending data only when necessary.
*   Improved accuracy in cases of disagreement by leveraging richer data and explanations.
*   Proactive identification of potentially contentious events, allowing for earlier intervention.
*   A more robust and reliable system for event detection and analysis.
