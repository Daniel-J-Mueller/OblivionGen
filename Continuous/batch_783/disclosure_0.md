## Dynamic Auction Weighting Based on Real-Time User Journey Analysis

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**  Instead of solely optimizing bids based on *click* success metrics, the system will dynamically adjust bid weights for keywords/key phrases based on comprehensive, real-time user journey data *after* the click.  This goes beyond simple conversion tracking.

**II. Data Inputs:**

*   **Clickstream Data:**  Detailed tracking of user behavior *on the landing page* following a click. (Time spent on page, scroll depth, element interactions - video plays, form submissions, product zoom, etc.).
*   **Session Context:**  Data about the user's session (device type, browser, location, referral source, time of day).
*   **Micro-Conversion Events:** Definition of smaller actions within the landing page that suggest user engagement (e.g. adding to wishlist, viewing multiple product images, reading a specific section of content).
*   **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction:** Integrate a CLTV prediction model to estimate the potential long-term value of each user.

**III. Processing & Algorithm:**

1.  **Journey Scoring:** Assign a score to each user journey based on the weighted combination of the above data inputs.  
    *   High scores indicate engaged users likely to convert or exhibit high CLTV.
    *   Low scores indicate disengaged users.
    *   Weights will be determined by a machine learning model trained on historical data.
2.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  For each keyword/key phrase, the system maintains a ‘weight’ applied to bids.
    *   The weight is adjusted proportionally to the average journey score of users who clicked on ads for that keyword/key phrase *in the past hour*.
    *   Formula:  `New Weight = Old Weight * (Average Journey Score / Baseline Journey Score)`
        *   `Baseline Journey Score` is a pre-defined target score.
3.  **Bid Modification:**  The optimal bid for a keyword/key phrase is calculated by multiplying the base bid by the current weight.
4.  **Exploration/Exploitation:** Implement an epsilon-greedy strategy. With probability epsilon, a random weight is assigned to encourage exploration of different bidding strategies.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The machine learning model used for Journey Scoring and weight adjustment will be continuously retrained with new data.

**IV. System Components:**

*   **Real-Time Data Pipeline:**  Kafka, Apache Flink, or similar for ingesting and processing data streams.
*   **Journey Scoring Engine:**  A service that calculates Journey Scores based on incoming data. (Python with scikit-learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch)
*   **Bid Weighting Service:** Responsible for maintaining and updating bid weights.
*   **Auction Integration Module:**  Integrates with the existing auction management system to modify bids.
*   **Data Storage:**  Cloud-based data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery) for historical data analysis.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:**  Dashboards and alerts to monitor system performance and identify anomalies.

**V. Pseudocode:**

```python
# On each auction cycle:
for keyword in keywords:
    journey_score = get_average_journey_score(keyword, time_window = "1 hour")
    weight = calculate_weight(journey_score, baseline_score)
    bid = base_bid * weight
    send_bid(bid, keyword)
```

**VI. Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved ROI:**  Focus bidding on keywords that attract high-quality, engaged users.
*   **More Accurate CLTV Prediction:**  By incorporating post-click behavior into the model.
*   **Automated Bidding Optimization:**  Reduces the need for manual intervention.
*   **Better User Experience:**  By showing ads to users who are more likely to be interested.
