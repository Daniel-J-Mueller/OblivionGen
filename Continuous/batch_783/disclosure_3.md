**Secure Peripheral Authentication & Dynamic Trust Anchoring**

**Concept:** Extend the existing trust evaluation framework to encompass and dynamically assess the trustworthiness of *peripherals* connected to the computing device. This moves beyond software integrity to encompass hardware trust, creating a holistic security posture.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Peripheral Trust Evaluation Module (PTEM):** A dedicated hardware/software module integrated into the device.  Responsible for establishing and maintaining a trust score for each connected peripheral.

2.  **Peripheral Identification & Profiling:**
    *   Upon connection (USB, Bluetooth, Thunderbolt, etc.), the PTEM initiates a profiling process.
    *   Initial profiling: Device type, manufacturer ID, serial number, firmware version (if accessible).  Known-good/bad database lookup.
    *   Dynamic profiling: Monitors peripheral behavior for anomalies. Data transfer rates, command patterns, power consumption, and responses to specific test commands.
    *   Behavioral Biometrics: Establish a baseline ‘behavioral fingerprint’ for each peripheral. Deviations trigger increased scrutiny.

3.  **Trust Anchoring & Propagation:**
    *   Initial Trust:  Peripheral’s trust score starts at a base level, influenced by manufacturer reputation and known vulnerability databases.
    *   Dynamic Trust Adjustment: Trust score fluctuates based on ongoing behavioral analysis.  Anomalies *reduce* trust. Consistent, expected behavior *increases* trust.
    *   Trust Propagation:  If a peripheral’s trust score falls below a threshold, the device restricts its access to sensitive data or functionality.
    *   Trust Delegation: High-trust peripherals can *enhance* the security of lower-trust applications. (e.g., A trusted hardware security key can unlock encrypted data for an untrusted app, acting as a vouchsafe).

4.  **Secure Communication Channel:**
    *   Establish a dedicated, encrypted communication channel between the device and trusted peripherals.
    *   Utilize hardware-based encryption (if available on the peripheral).
    *   Implement mutual authentication to verify the identity of both the device and the peripheral.

5.  **User Interface Integration:**
    *   Display the trust score of each connected peripheral in the existing security information UI.
    *   Allow the user to set trust thresholds for peripherals.
    *   Provide detailed logs of peripheral activity and trust score changes.
    *   Alert the user to any suspicious peripheral behavior.

**Pseudocode (PTEM - Core Logic):**

```
function evaluatePeripheralTrust(peripheral):
  trustScore = baseTrustScore(peripheral)

  while (peripheral is connected):
    behaviorData = monitorPeripheralBehavior(peripheral)
    anomalyScore = detectAnomalies(behaviorData)

    trustScore += anomalyScore * trustAdjustmentFactor

    // Clamp trust score between 0 and 100
    trustScore = clamp(trustScore, 0, 100)

    if (trustScore < trustThreshold):
      restrictPeripheralAccess(peripheral)
      logSuspiciousActivity(peripheral)
    else:
      enablePeripheralAccess(peripheral)

    sleep(monitoringInterval)

function detectAnomalies(behaviorData):
  // Analyze data for deviations from expected behavior
  // (Data transfer rate, command patterns, power consumption, etc.)
  // Returns a score indicating the level of anomaly
  return anomalyScore

function restrictPeripheralAccess(peripheral):
  // Disable access to sensitive data or functionality
  // (e.g., Block USB mass storage access, disable camera input)
  // Implement granular access control based on peripheral type
  // and trust score
  pass

function enablePeripheralAccess(peripheral):
  // Restore access to data and functionality
  pass
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond software-centric trust to include the *hardware* chain, dynamically evaluating peripherals. Introduces trust delegation and granular access control based on device behavior. Extends the concept of a "trustworthy" system beyond the application itself.
