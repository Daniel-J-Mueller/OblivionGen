**Dynamic Taxonomy Personalization via Predictive Behavioral Modeling**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the existing seller-specified rule system to incorporate predictive behavioral modeling, creating dynamically personalized taxonomies for each user. Instead of static category filtering based on seller rules, the system learns user preferences and *predicts* which categories are most relevant *at that moment*, subtly shifting the presented taxonomy.

**II. Components:**

*   **Behavioral Data Collector:** Gathers data on user interactions:
    *   Search queries (full text)
    *   Click-through rates on search results
    *   Time spent viewing product pages
    *   Purchase history (detailed product attributes)
    *   Items added to cart/wishlists (even if not purchased)
    *   Explicit ratings/reviews
    *   Demographic data (if available and consented to)
*   **Predictive Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, transformer model) trained on the behavioral data. This model outputs a probability distribution over product categories for each user *at each search*.
*   **Taxonomy Modifier:** A module that takes the base taxonomy (as defined by seller rules) and modifies it based on the output of the predictive model. This modification is *subtle* – it doesn't completely override the seller's categories, but rather re-weights them, promotes certain branches, or introduces temporary, user-specific subcategories.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the personalization. Randomly assign users to control groups (standard seller-specified taxonomy) and treatment groups (personalized taxonomy) to measure metrics like click-through rates, conversion rates, and average order value.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
// On User Search Request:
user_id = get_user_id()
search_query = get_search_query()

// 1. Get Base Taxonomy:
base_taxonomy = get_seller_taxonomy(seller_id)

// 2. Predict Category Preferences:
predicted_categories = predict_category_preferences(user_id, search_query)  //Returns a probability distribution

// 3. Modify Taxonomy:
modified_taxonomy = modify_taxonomy(base_taxonomy, predicted_categories)

// Modification Logic (Example):
//  - Boost categories with high predicted probability
//  - Create temporary subcategories based on frequently co-occurring items
//  - Reduce visibility of categories with low predicted probability

// 4. Render Search Results using modified_taxonomy
```

**IV. Data Structure:**

*   **Taxonomy Node:**
    *   `category_id`: Unique identifier for the category
    *   `category_name`: Human-readable name
    *   `parent_id`: ID of the parent category (for hierarchical structure)
    *   `weight`: A numerical value representing the category’s importance (dynamically adjusted by the predictive model)
    *   `is_expanded`: Boolean flag indicating whether the category is initially expanded in the UI.

**V. UI Considerations:**

*   **Subtle Changes:**  Avoid drastic changes to the taxonomy that would confuse users.  Focus on smooth transitions and gentle re-weighting of categories.
*   **Personalized Indicators:** Consider subtle visual cues (e.g., a small icon) to indicate that the taxonomy is personalized for the user.
*   **User Control (Optional):**  Allow users to provide feedback on the personalized taxonomy (e.g., "This category is not relevant to me") to improve the accuracy of the predictive model.
