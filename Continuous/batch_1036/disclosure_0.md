## Adaptive Predictive Buffering with Contextual Awareness

**Concept:** Expand on the predictive parity packet concept by introducing adaptive buffering on the *device* side, guided not just by predicted loss, but by real-time contextual awareness of device state and network conditions *after* initial data reception. This moves beyond purely anticipating loss to actively managing available bandwidth and proactively mitigating future issues.

**Specifications:**

**1. Device-Side Contextual Sensor Suite:**

*   **Network Condition Monitor:** Continuously measures signal strength, latency, jitter, and packet loss *after* the initial data transfer with parity packets.  Data is sampled at 10Hz.
*   **Resource Monitor:** Tracks CPU usage, memory pressure, disk I/O, and battery level.  Samples at 5Hz.
*   **Application Priority Monitor:** Identifies foreground/background application status and associated bandwidth requirements.  Samples at 2Hz.
*   **Location/Mobility Sensor:** Tracks device location and speed. (Optional - utilizes existing GPS/IMU data) – Samples at 1Hz.

**2. Predictive Buffer Manager (PBM):**

*   **Initialization:** Upon receiving initial data and parity packets, the PBM establishes a base buffer size calculated from the server's predicted loss estimate (as in the original patent).
*   **Real-Time Adjustment:**
    *   The PBM continuously analyzes data from the Contextual Sensor Suite.
    *   A weighted scoring system determines buffer adjustment needs:
        *   **Network Score:**  High packet loss/latency = Increased buffer weighting (up to 2x base size).
        *   **Resource Score:** High CPU/Memory usage = Reduced buffer weighting (down to 0.5x base size) – prioritize responsive device operation.
        *   **Application Score:** Foreground app with high bandwidth needs = Increased buffer weighting. Background app = Reduced weighting.
        *   **Mobility Score:**  Rapid movement/location change = Increased buffer weighting (anticipate network handover).
    *   A PID controller regulates the buffer size based on the weighted score. This ensures smooth, stable buffer adjustments.
*   **Pre-fetch/Caching:**  When the buffer is near capacity *and* the predictive score is high, the PBM proactively requests subsequent data packets from the server, leveraging potential bandwidth availability. This utilizes a priority queue, prioritizing data packets critical for current application usage.
*   **Dynamic Parity Request:** Based on the current buffer state and predicted network stability, the device can *request additional* parity packets from the server on-demand.  This allows for reinforcement of data integrity in dynamically unstable conditions. Request includes: buffer level, current network conditions, predictive score.

**3. Server-Side Adaptations:**

*   **Parity Packet Prioritization:** The server prioritizes sending parity packets requested by the device *before* sending additional data packets.
*   **Adaptive Encoding:**  The server dynamically adjusts encoding rates (e.g., video/audio codecs) based on the device’s reported network conditions. This allows for a trade-off between data quality and bandwidth usage.
*   **Proactive Congestion Control:**  The server monitors the aggregate bandwidth usage of all connected devices and proactively adjusts sending rates to avoid network congestion.

**Pseudocode (Device-Side - PBM):**

```
//Initialization
baseBufferSize = ServerPredictedLossEstimate;
currentBufferSize = baseBufferSize;

//Main Loop
while (deviceIsRunning) {

  //Gather sensor data
  networkScore = getNetworkScore();
  resourceScore = getResourceScore();
  applicationScore = getApplicationScore();
  mobilityScore = getMobilityScore();

  //Calculate weighted score
  totalScore = (networkScore * 0.5) + (resourceScore * 0.2) + (applicationScore * 0.2) + (mobilityScore * 0.1);

  //PID Controller
  error = totalScore - targetScore; //Target score is determined by app requirements
  output = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative;

  //Adjust buffer size
  currentBufferSize = baseBufferSize + output; //Constrain buffer size

  //Prefetching
  if (currentBufferSize > 0.8 * maxBufferSize && totalScore > threshold) {
    requestNextDataPackets();
  }

  //Request additional parity packets
  if(totalScore > parityThreshold){
    requestAdditionalParityPackets();
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  This extends the original patent's predictive approach to a *dynamic*, *responsive* system that actively manages buffering and parity packet requests based on real-time device and network conditions. It moves beyond purely anticipating loss to proactively mitigating issues and optimizing data delivery. The focus on device-side adaptation and dynamic parity requests is a key differentiator.
