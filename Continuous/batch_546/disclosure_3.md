**Personalized Content 'Vibes' via Multi-Modal Social Signal Aggregation**

**Concept:** Extend social feedback beyond simple reviews to create a dynamic 'vibe check' for content, leveraging multiple data streams – text, image, audio, and even short-form video reactions – to generate a rich, emotionally-aware content profile. This isn't about sentiment analysis; it's about capturing the *feeling* people associate with content.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Input Pipeline:**
    *   Social Network API Integration: Access data from platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, etc.
    *   Data Types: Capture text comments, image/video posts *reacting* to the content (e.g., TikTok duets, Instagram story responses), audio reactions (voice notes, short sound clips).
    *   Real-time Stream Processing:  Ingest data continuously via streaming APIs.

2.  **Feature Extraction & Emotion Mapping:**
    *   Text Analysis: Standard sentiment analysis + topic modeling.
    *   Image/Video Analysis:  Facial expression recognition, object detection (identifying props or settings suggesting mood), scene understanding.
    *   Audio Analysis:  Emotion detection from voice tone, identification of sound effects contributing to the 'vibe' (e.g., laughter, suspenseful music).
    *   Vibe Vectors:  Represent each data point as a multi-dimensional vector capturing emotional intensity and specific emotional attributes (e.g., [Joy: 0.8, Suspense: 0.2, Nostalgia: 0.5]).

3.  **Vibe Aggregation & Content Profiling:**
    *   Weighted Averaging: Combine vibe vectors from multiple sources, weighting based on source credibility (verified accounts, follower count) and reaction type (e.g., a video response carries more weight than a text comment).
    *   Vibe Clusters: Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to identify dominant 'vibe' patterns associated with the content.  Examples: "Cozy & Relaxing," "Energetic & Fun," "Dark & Mysterious," "Thought-Provoking & Melancholy."
    *   Content Vibe Profile:  Store the dominant vibe clusters and corresponding intensity scores as a profile associated with the content.

4.  **User Interface Integration:**
    *   Vibe Indicators: Display a visual representation of the content’s vibe on the product details page (e.g., a color gradient, animated icons, descriptive tags).
    *   Vibe Filtering: Allow users to filter content based on desired vibe (e.g., "Show me movies with a 'Cozy & Relaxing' vibe").
    *   Personalized Vibe Recommendations:  Recommend content based on user's preferred vibe profiles (derived from their social media activity and past interactions).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Ingestion
FOR each SocialNetwork IN [Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook]
    stream = ConnectToSocialNetworkAPI(SocialNetwork)
    FOR each DataPoint IN stream
        IF DataPoint.relatesTo(ContentItem)
            ProcessDataPoint(DataPoint)

// Data Processing
FUNCTION ProcessDataPoint(DataPoint)
    IF DataPoint.type == "text"
        sentiment, topics = AnalyzeText(DataPoint.content)
    ELSE IF DataPoint.type == "image" OR DataPoint.type == "video"
        facialExpressions, objects, scene = AnalyzeImage(DataPoint.content)
    ELSE IF DataPoint.type == "audio"
        emotion = AnalyzeAudio(DataPoint.content)

    vibeVector = CreateVibeVector(sentiment, topics, facialExpressions, objects, scene, emotion)
    AddVibeVectorToBuffer(vibeVector)

// Vibe Aggregation
FUNCTION AggregateVibeVectors()
    vibeVectors = RetrieveVibeVectorsFromBuffer()
    weightedVectors = ApplyWeightsToVibeVectors(vibeVectors)
    aggregatedVector = AverageWeightedVibeVectors(weightedVectors)
    clusters = ApplyClusteringAlgorithm(aggregatedVector)
    Return clusters

// UI Integration
DisplayVibeClustersOnProductDetailsPage(clusters)
```

This system aims to move beyond simple ratings and reviews to provide a much richer and more nuanced understanding of how people *feel* about content, enabling more personalized and engaging recommendations. It leverages multi-modal data analysis to capture subtle emotional cues that are often missed by traditional sentiment analysis techniques.
