## Predictive Touch Haptics & Ghosting

**Concept:** Extend the queued touch event system by preemptively providing haptic feedback *before* the page fully loads, combined with a "ghosting" visual effect to indicate predicted interaction points. This aims to create a more responsive and intuitive user experience, especially on slower connections.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Engine Integration:** Integrate with device haptic engines (linear resonant actuators, etc.).
*   **Touch Prediction Model:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) trained on user touch patterns, common UI element sizes, and typical web page layouts. This model predicts the userâ€™s intended target based on the initial touch location and speed/direction.
*   **Pre-emptive Haptic Feedback:** When a touch event is queued *and* the prediction model yields a high-confidence target, immediately trigger a brief haptic pulse localized to the predicted touch area on the screen. This provides immediate acknowledgement to the user, even before the page responds.
*   **"Ghosting" Visual Indicator:** Simultaneously display a semi-transparent "ghost" image of the UI element the prediction model targets, overlaid on the current loading page. This provides visual confirmation of the predicted interaction point. The ghost image should fade out as the page becomes interactive or if the prediction confidence drops below a threshold.
*   **Dynamic Confidence Threshold:** Adjust the confidence threshold for both haptic feedback and ghosting based on network conditions and device capabilities. On slower networks, lower the threshold to provide earlier feedback, accepting a slightly higher chance of incorrect predictions.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to adjust the intensity of haptic feedback, enable/disable ghosting, and control the sensitivity of the prediction model.
*   **Error Handling:** If the predicted target is incorrect (i.e., the user taps a different element), briefly display a subtle visual cue (e.g., a short flash) to indicate the prediction error.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Touch Event Received
function onTouchEvent(touchEvent) {
    storeTouchEvent(touchEvent);
    predictedTarget = predictTarget(touchEvent);

    if (predictedTarget.confidence > confidenceThreshold) {
        triggerHapticFeedback(predictedTarget.location);
        displayGhostImage(predictedTarget.element, predictedTarget.location);
    }
}

// When Page Becomes Interactive
function onPageInteractive() {
    removeGhostImages();
    applyQueuedTouchEvents();
}

//Prediction Model - Simplified
function predictTarget(touchEvent) {
    //Consider touch location, speed, direction, and page layout
    //Return element and confidence level
}

//Ghosting Visual
function displayGhostImage(element, location) {
    //Create semi-transparent overlay of element at location
}

function removeGhostImages() {
    //Remove all ghost image overlays
}

```
