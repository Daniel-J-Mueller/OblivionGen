## Autonomous Robotic Shelf Audit & Restock System

**System Overview:** A mobile robotic system capable of autonomously auditing shelf inventory, identifying misplaced or out-of-stock items, and restocking shelves from a central inventory source. This extends the concepts of weight and image data beyond simple interaction *detection* to full-scale autonomous shelf management.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Mobile Robot Base:**  Omnidirectional drive system for maneuverability within aisles.
*   **High-Resolution Multi-Spectral Camera Array:**  Captures visible light, depth data, and potentially near-infrared for material identification.  Mounted on a pan-tilt unit.
*   **Precision Weight Scales (Integrated into Gripper):**  Used to verify item weight during pick-and-place operations and detect discrepancies.
*   **Robotic Arm & Gripper:**  Capable of manipulating a range of item sizes and weights.  Force sensors in the gripper to avoid damage.
*   **Central Inventory Management System (CIMS) Interface:**  Communication link to a warehouse management system (WMS) or similar.
*   **LiDAR/Ultrasonic Sensors:**  For navigation and obstacle avoidance.
*   **Onboard Processing Unit:**  High-performance computer for real-time data processing and decision-making.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Shelf Mapping Module:**
    *   Creates a 3D map of the shelf layout using LiDAR and camera data.
    *   Identifies shelf partitions and product locations.
    *   Stores the map in a persistent database.

2.  **Object Detection & Classification Module:**
    *   Utilizes computer vision algorithms (e.g., YOLO, SSD) to detect and classify items on the shelf.
    *   Training dataset includes images of all stocked items.
    *   Confidence scores assigned to each detection.

3.  **Weight Anomaly Detection Module:**
    *   Establishes baseline weight distributions for each shelf partition based on expected item quantities.
    *   Detects discrepancies between actual and expected weights.  Utilizes Kalman filtering for smoothing weight data.
    *   Triggers further investigation (visual inspection) if anomalies are detected.

4.  **Hypothesis Generation & Fusion Module:**
    *   Combines visual and weight data to generate hypotheses about shelf inventory status (e.g., item is missing, misplaced, out of stock, low quantity).
    *   Uses Bayesian networks or other probabilistic models to fuse data from multiple sensors.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   `Hypothesis = f(VisualData, WeightData, ShelfMap)`
        *   `Confidence(Hypothesis) = BayesianUpdate(Prior, Likelihood)`
        *   Prior: Based on historical data and product demand.
        *   Likelihood: Based on current sensor readings.

5.  **Path Planning & Navigation Module:**
    *   Generates optimal paths for the robot to navigate to and interact with the shelf.
    *   Utilizes SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for real-time localization.
    *   Avoids obstacles and other robots.

6.  **Restocking Module:**
    *   Retrieves requested items from a central inventory source (e.g., warehouse rack).
    *   Places items in the correct shelf location.
    *   Verifies placement using computer vision and weight sensors.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   `FetchItem(ItemID, Quantity)`
        *   `PlaceItem(ItemID, Location)`
        *   `VerifyPlacement(ItemID, Location)`

7.  **CIMS Interface Module:**
    *   Communicates with the CIMS to receive restocking requests and update inventory levels.
    *   Provides real-time shelf inventory status.

**Pseudocode for Anomaly Detection:**

```
// Define expected weight for each shelf location
expected_weight[location] = calculate_expected_weight(items_at_location)

// Read current weight from scale
current_weight = read_weight()

// Calculate weight difference
weight_difference = current_weight - expected_weight

// Calculate percentage difference
percentage_difference = (weight_difference / expected_weight) * 100

// Check if percentage difference exceeds threshold
if abs(percentage_difference) > threshold:
  // Flag anomaly
  anomaly_flag = True
  // Log anomaly details
  log_anomaly(location, weight_difference, percentage_difference)

// Kalman filtering for smoothing:
// predicted_weight = state_transition_matrix * previous_state + control_input
// measurement_residual = current_weight - predicted_weight
// kalman_gain = covariance_matrix * measurement_residual / (measurement_residual^2 + covariance_matrix)
// updated_state = predicted_state + kalman_gain * measurement_residual
```

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond *detecting* interactions to *fully managing* shelf inventory. It combines weight and image data with autonomous robotics to create a self-auditing and restocking system. The use of Kalman filtering for weight smoothing and the integration with a CIMS further enhance the system's performance and efficiency. It isn’t ‘just’ detecting items, it’s making sure the shelf is properly maintained, automatically.
