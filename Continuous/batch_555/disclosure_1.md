## Dynamic Spatial Index Granularity

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on substituting missing index portions. This expands on that by *dynamically adjusting the granularity* of the spatial index itself based on data density and query patterns. Instead of fixed-size regions, the index can subdivide densely populated areas into smaller portions and aggregate sparsely populated areas into larger ones.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Density Map Generation:**

*   **Trigger:** Periodically (configurable interval) or on significant data insertion/deletion events.
*   **Process:** Scan spatial data within a defined area. Divide the area into a grid. Count the number of spatial objects within each grid cell.
*   **Output:** A data density map â€“ a 2D array representing the number of spatial objects per grid cell.

**2. Index Granularity Adjustment Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Data Density Map, Current Spatial Index Structure, Configuration Parameters (Min/Max Index Portion Size, Granularity Change Threshold).
*   **Process:**
    *   Iterate through each grid cell in the Data Density Map.
    *   Compare the object count in the cell to a configurable threshold.
    *   **If object count > threshold:** Subdivide the corresponding index portion into smaller portions. The subdivision pattern (e.g., quadtree, k-d tree) is configurable.
    *   **If object count < threshold:** Merge the corresponding index portion with neighboring portions to create larger portions.  Neighbor selection criteria are configurable (e.g., spatial proximity, object count similarity).
    *   Algorithm monitors cost. Merging/splitting is limited by a cost function to prevent runaway index changes.

**3. Index Update Mechanism:**

*   **Incremental Updates:** Avoid complete index rebuilds.  Adjustments are performed incrementally.
*   **Object Re-indexing:** When an index portion is split or merged, objects within that portion are re-indexed into the new portions.
*   **Concurrency Control:** Implement appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure data consistency during index updates.

**4. Query Optimization:**

*   **Dynamic Region Selection:** The query engine dynamically selects the appropriate index portions based on the query region and the current index granularity.
*   **Multi-Granularity Search:** Queries can utilize index portions of varying granularities to optimize search performance.  For dense regions, utilize finer-grained portions; for sparse regions, utilize coarser-grained portions.
*   **Adaptive Query Region Subdivision:**  Based on initial query results, subdivide the query region into smaller sub-regions and execute separate queries on each sub-region.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
function adjustGranularity(densityMap, index, config):
  for each cell in densityMap:
    objectCount = cell.objectCount
    if objectCount > config.granularityChangeThreshold:
      splitIndexPortion(index, cell)
    else if objectCount < config.granularityMergeThreshold:
      mergeIndexPortions(index, cell)
  return index
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   Utilize a tree-based data structure (e.g., quadtree, k-d tree) for the spatial index.
*   Implement a cost function to evaluate the performance impact of index adjustments. Factors to consider include the number of objects re-indexed, the number of index portions created/deleted, and the CPU/IO cost of index updates.
*   Provide a configuration interface for tuning parameters such as the granularity change threshold, the minimum/maximum index portion size, and the cost function weights.
