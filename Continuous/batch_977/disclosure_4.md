## Dynamic Content Stitching via Predictive Device State

**Concept:** Leverage predicted device states (battery level, network connectivity *quality*, location, user activity – inferred from sensor data) to dynamically stitch together content packages *before* transmission, optimizing for seamless playback even under fluctuating conditions.  This goes beyond simply adjusting metadata; it actively re-combines media segments.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive State Engine (PSE):**
    *   Input: Device telemetry (battery, signal strength, location, accelerometer, gyroscope, screen state), historical usage patterns.
    *   Process:  Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) preferred – to predict device state *over a defined window* (e.g., next 10-30 seconds). Output: Probability distribution of device states.
    *   Output:  “State Vector” – numerical representation of predicted device state.
*   **Component 2: Content Stitcher (CS):**
    *   Input: Original content package (media segments, metadata), State Vector from PSE, defined “Stitch Profiles” (see below).
    *   Process:  Selects and rearranges media segments based on the State Vector and active Stitch Profile. This is *not* simply transcoding. It's about selecting the *optimal* sequence of pre-prepared segments.
    *   Output: Modified content package with reordered segments.
*   **Component 3: Stitch Profile Repository (SPR):**
    *   Data Structure:  JSON-based configuration files.
    *   Content: Each profile defines segment selection and ordering rules for specific predicted device states.  Example:
        ```json
        {
          "profile_name": "Low_Bandwidth_Mobile",
          "state_thresholds": {
            "signal_strength": { "min": 0, "max": 2 },
            "battery_level": { "min": 0, "max": 20 }
          },
          "segment_ordering": [
            { "segment_id": "base_720p", "priority": 1 },
            { "segment_id": "audio_only", "priority": 2 },
            { "segment_id": "low_res_preview", "priority": 3 }
          ]
        }
        ```
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Device transmits telemetry data to server.
    2.  PSE predicts device state and generates State Vector.
    3.  Server queries SPR for matching Stitch Profile(s).
    4.  CS selects and reorders segments based on the Stitch Profile and State Vector.
    5.  Modified content package is sent to device.

**Pseudocode (Content Stitcher - simplified):**

```
function stitch_content(original_package, state_vector, stitch_profile):
  selected_segments = []
  for segment_rule in stitch_profile.segment_ordering:
    segment = find_segment(original_package, segment_rule.segment_id)
    if segment != null:
      selected_segments.append(segment)

  #Re-order segments according to the priority
  selected_segments.sort(key=lambda x: x.priority)

  modified_package = create_package(selected_segments)

  return modified_package
```

**Novelty:**  This isn’t adaptive bitrate streaming. It's proactive content assembly *before* transmission, tailored to predicted conditions. The system optimizes for *complete* playback continuity, even if the device temporarily loses connectivity or experiences significant performance degradation. It could utilize pre-rendered segment variations – not just resolutions – like simplified animations or static images to maintain a visual experience.

**Potential Extensions:**  Content pre-fetching based on predicted location (e.g., pre-downloading maps for upcoming routes). Integration with user activity recognition (e.g., switching to audio-only mode during exercise).
