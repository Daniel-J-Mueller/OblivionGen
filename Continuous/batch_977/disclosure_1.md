## Dynamic Threat Landscape Simulation & Injection

**Concept:** Augment the runtime introspection and instrumentation with a dynamic threat landscape simulation engine. Instead of solely reacting to observed anomalies, proactively *inject* simulated threats into the monitored environment to assess its resilience and identify weaknesses *before* they are exploited.

**Specs:**

1.  **Threat Definition Language (TDL):** A declarative language for defining threat profiles. These profiles specify attack vectors, payloads, behaviors, and success criteria.  Example:

    ```tdl
    threat_profile "Ransomware_Sim" {
        vector: "Network_SMB"
        payload: "Encrypted_File_Marker"
        behavior: {
            file_encryption: true
            ransom_note_creation: true
            network_scanning: false
        }
        success_criteria: {
            files_encrypted_percentage: "> 5%"
            ransom_note_present: true
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Simulation Engine:**  A component responsible for translating TDL definitions into executable actions within the monitored environment.  This requires a modular architecture with “actor” components capable of emulating different attack stages (e.g., reconnaissance, exploitation, payload delivery).

    *   **Actor Registry:** Central repository of pre-built and custom actors.
    *   **Orchestration Module:**  Sequences and manages actor execution according to the TDL definition.
    *   **Environment Interaction Module:**  Provides secure and controlled access to the monitored environment.  (API calls, network packets, process memory, etc.).

3.  **Real-time Feedback Loop:** Integrate the simulation engine with the existing runtime introspection system.  As the simulation progresses, monitor the environment for responses (e.g., alerts, process terminations, network blocks).  

    *   **Event Correlation Engine:**  Identifies relationships between simulation actions and observed events.
    *   **Anomaly Detection Enhancement:** Improve anomaly detection algorithms by training them on simulated threat data.

4.  **Automated Risk Scoring:** Based on simulation results and event correlations, generate a dynamic risk score for each resource within the monitored environment.  This score reflects the resource's vulnerability to different attack vectors.

    *   **Risk Heatmaps:** Visualize risk scores using intuitive heatmaps, allowing security teams to prioritize remediation efforts.
    *   **Automated Mitigation Recommendations:**  Suggest specific security actions based on identified vulnerabilities (e.g., firewall rule updates, software patching, privilege revocation).

**Pseudocode (Simulation Orchestration):**

```pseudocode
function run_simulation(threat_profile, target_environment):
    actors = load_actors_from_profile(threat_profile)
    
    for actor in actors:
        #Initialize actor with target_environment context
        actor.initialize(target_environment)

        #Execute actor’s actions
        actor.execute()

        #Collect feedback from runtime introspection system
        feedback = get_introspection_feedback(actor.last_action)

        #Evaluate success criteria 
        if evaluate_success_criteria(threat_profile.success_criteria, feedback):
            log_success(threat_profile, feedback)
        else:
            log_failure(threat_profile, feedback)
```

**Innovation:**  Moves beyond passive threat detection towards *active security assessment*. Proactively identifies vulnerabilities *before* they are exploited, allowing for more effective risk management and incident response. It is similar to penetration testing, but automated, continuous, and integrated with runtime security monitoring.
