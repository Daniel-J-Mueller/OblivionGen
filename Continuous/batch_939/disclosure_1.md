## Dynamic Regional Resilience Mesh

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of recovery AZs by creating a dynamically adjusting mesh of regional resilience, leveraging unused capacity *across* regions, not just within a region. This moves beyond paired/tripled AZ recovery to a more fluid and adaptable system.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Resilience Mesh Manager (RMM)
    *   Function: Monitors regional health (based on metrics similar to those in the patent – CPU, network latency, error rates, etc.). Predicts potential regional degradation *before* full failure.  Maintains a constantly updated map of available capacity in *all* peered regions.
*   **Component:** Capacity Broker (CB)
    *   Function:  Negotiates and allocates capacity across regions.  Uses a cost-benefit analysis (network latency, cost of transfer, available capacity) to determine optimal placement of services during pre-emptive or reactive failover.
*   **Component:** Service Profile Database (SPDB)
    *   Function: Stores detailed profiles of all running services, including dependencies, resource requirements, data replication needs, and acceptable latency thresholds. Critical for intelligent placement.
*   **Component:** Automated Service Migrator (ASM)
    *   Function:  Orchestrates the migration of services based on signals from the RMM and decisions from the CB. This includes data replication, DNS updates, load balancer adjustments, and service startup/shutdown.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:** RMM collects regional health data.
2.  **Predictive Analysis:** RMM uses machine learning models to predict potential regional degradation based on historical data and current trends.
3.  **Capacity Assessment:** RMM queries CB for available capacity in peered regions.
4.  **Proactive Migration (Optional):** If a regional degradation is predicted *before* failure, ASM proactively migrates non-critical services to healthy regions, based on the SPDB and CB recommendations.
5.  **Reactive Failover:**  If a region fails, ASM rapidly fails over critical services to healthy regions, utilizing pre-allocated capacity or dynamically requesting it from CB.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  ASM continuously monitors performance in the new location and adjusts resource allocation as needed.  It also facilitates the restoration of services to the original region when it recovers.

**Pseudocode (ASM – Core Failover Logic):**

```
function failoverService(serviceID, originalRegion, targetRegion):
  // Get service profile
  serviceProfile = SPDB.getProfile(serviceID)

  // Allocate resources in target region
  resources = CB.allocateResources(serviceProfile, targetRegion)

  // Replicate data (if needed)
  replicateData(serviceProfile, originalRegion, targetRegion)

  // Start service in target region
  startService(serviceProfile, targetRegion, resources)

  // Update DNS & Load Balancer
  updateDNS(serviceID, targetRegion)
  updateLoadBalancer(serviceID, targetRegion)

  // Monitor service health in target region
  monitorServiceHealth(serviceID, targetRegion)

  return success

function monitorServiceHealth(serviceID, region):
  // Continuously check service metrics (CPU, memory, latency, errors)
  while(true):
    metrics = getMetrics(serviceID, region)
    if(metrics.health == unhealthy):
      // Trigger remediation (e.g., scale up, restart service)
      remediateService(serviceID, region)
    sleep(60 seconds)
```

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond static recovery AZs to a dynamic, region-spanning resilience mesh. It proactively anticipates failures and leverages unused capacity across a broader geographic area. The predictive analysis and automated orchestration provide a faster, more robust recovery experience. It’s essentially a self-healing, self-optimizing infrastructure.
