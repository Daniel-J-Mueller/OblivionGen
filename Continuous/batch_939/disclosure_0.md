## Dynamic Page Structure Prediction & Content Anticipation

**Core Concept:** Expand the classification system to *predict* likely content based on page location *before* full image analysis, dynamically adjusting analysis parameters. This moves beyond simply classifying what *is* on the page, to anticipating what *should* be there.

**Specification:**

1.  **Probabilistic Page Model:**
    *   Create a probabilistic model representing the expected content structure of different document types (books, reports, manuals, etc.). This model defines probabilities for content categories (text, image, table, heading, footnote, etc.) at specific page ranges.
    *   Example: In a typical book, pages 1-5 have a high probability of containing title pages, copyright information, and prefaces. Pages 100-200 might have a higher probability of containing images/illustrations if the document type is a photography book.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis Parameter Adjustment:**
    *   Based on the probabilistic page model and identified page location, adjust image analysis parameters *before* classification begins.
    *   **Focus Adjustment:** If the model predicts a high probability of tables, emphasize table detection algorithms. If images are likely, prioritize image segmentation and object recognition.
    *   **Algorithm Weighting:**  Assign weights to different classification algorithms based on predicted content.  A higher weight for text OCR if the model predicts predominantly text.
    *   **Region of Interest (ROI) Definition:** Define ROIs within the page image based on expected content placement.  For example, if a heading is expected at the top, focus analysis on that region.
3.  **Content Anticipation & Verification:**
    *   After initial analysis (using dynamically adjusted parameters), compare the *detected* content with the *anticipated* content.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify discrepancies. A table detected on a copyright page is an anomaly.
    *   **Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score to the classification based on the degree of match between anticipated and detected content.
    *   **Automated Correction:** Implement automated correction based on anomalies. (Example: If a signature is detected on a page that should be a table of contents, attempt to correct it, or flag it for human review.)
4.  **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   Continuously update the probabilistic page model based on data from classified documents.  This allows the system to learn and improve its predictions over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION classifyPage(pageImage, pageNumber, documentType):
  // Load document type model
  model = loadDocumentTypeModel(documentType)

  // Predict expected content for the page
  predictedContent = predictContent(pageNumber, model)

  // Adjust analysis parameters based on predicted content
  analysisParams = adjustAnalysisParams(predictedContent)

  // Perform image analysis with adjusted parameters
  analysisResults = analyzeImage(pageImage, analysisParams)

  // Calculate content match score between analysisResults and predictedContent
  matchScore = calculateMatchScore(analysisResults, predictedContent)

  // Assign classification based on matchScore and analysisResults
  IF matchScore > threshold:
    classification = determineClassification(analysisResults)
  ELSE:
    classification = flagForManualReview()

  RETURN classification
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires a robust machine learning framework for model training and prediction.
*   Needs sufficient processing power for real-time image analysis and parameter adjustment.
*   Scalable storage for document type models and training data.
