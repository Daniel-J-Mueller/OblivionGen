## Autonomous Swarm Calibration & Predictive Relocation

**System Overview:** Implement a dynamic calibration system for agents utilizing localized ultrasonic beacons and a central processing unit. This allows for real-time positional correction and predictive path adjustments based on modeled warehouse congestion.

**Specifications:**

*   **Agent Hardware:** Each agent equipped with:
    *   4x Ultrasonic Transducers (positioned for 360° coverage)
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – 9-axis
    *   Low-power Microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M7 or equivalent)
    *   Wireless Communication Module (802.11ac or equivalent)
*   **Beacon Infrastructure:** Deploy a network of low-power ultrasonic beacons throughout the inventory storage area. Beacons transmit unique identification signals. Beacon density: 1 beacon per 500 sq. ft. minimum.
*   **Calibration Process:**
    1.  **Beacon Acquisition:** Agent actively listens for beacon signals. Signal strength and time-of-flight measurements determine distance to each beacon.
    2.  **Positional Calculation:** Agent uses trilateration algorithms to calculate its position in 3D space.
    3.  **IMU Fusion:** Combine trilateration data with IMU readings (acceleration, angular velocity) using a Kalman filter to refine positional accuracy and compensate for short-term drift.
    4.  **Real-time Correction:**  Agent continuously compares its calculated position with expected path and corrects its trajectory.
*   **Predictive Relocation Algorithm:**
    1.  **Congestion Mapping:** Central processing unit maintains a dynamic map of warehouse congestion based on agent positions, historical data, and order fulfillment priorities.
    2.  **Path Prediction:**  Utilize machine learning models (LSTM networks are suggested) to predict potential congestion points along planned agent paths. This should model the paths of other agents.
    3.  **Proactive Rerouting:**  If a predicted congestion point is likely to cause a delay exceeding a threshold (configurable parameter), the central processing unit proactively reroutes the agent to an alternate path, even before it reaches the congestion zone.
    4.  **Swarm Coordination:**  Algorithm prioritizes rerouting of agents to minimize overall system disruption. Coordination considers the impact on other agents and order fulfillment deadlines.
*   **Data Model:**
    *   Warehouse map represented as a graph. Nodes represent physical locations; edges represent traversable paths. Edge weights represent path length and estimated traversal time.
    *   Agent state: Position (x, y, z), velocity, current task, assigned order, and predictive path.
    *   Dynamic congestion map: Heatmap overlaid on warehouse graph. Intensity represents congestion level.
*   **Pseudocode (Predictive Rerouting):**

```
function rerouteAgent(agent, predictedPath)
    congestionLevel = getCongestionLevel(predictedPath)

    if congestionLevel > threshold:
        alternatePaths = findAlternatePaths(agent.position, agent.destination)
        bestPath = selectBestPath(alternatePaths, congestionMap, agent.deadline)

        if bestPath != null:
            agent.updatePath(bestPath)
            broadcastPathUpdate(agent) // Notify other agents of path change
    end if
end function
```

**Innovation:** Shifting from reactive error correction to proactive path optimization, reducing order fulfillment times and increasing warehouse throughput. Combines real-time localization with predictive analytics for a truly intelligent materials handling system. The system should also use swarm intelligence for path planning.
