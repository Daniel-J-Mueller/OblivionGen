## Modular, Self-Healing Storage Node System

**Concept:** Expand the logical node concept to encompass fully modular, hot-swappable, and *self-healing* storage and compute units. The core innovation lies in a distributed control plane allowing individual modules to detect failure, isolate, and reroute traffic *without* centralized controller intervention.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Type:** “Corelet” – a self-contained unit comprising:
    *   High-density NAND flash (or future equivalent) – 16TB – 128TB capacity.
    *   Low-power RISC-V processor (4+ cores) – dedicated to data management, error correction, and network I/O.
    *   Direct-attached PCIe Gen5 network interface (x4 or x8 lane) – for high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity.
    *   Integrated power management and monitoring circuitry.
    *   Form Factor: 3.5” HDD equivalent volume.

*   **Chassis:**
    *   High-density backplane with multiple Corelet slots (e.g., 24, 48, or higher).
    *   Redundant power supplies and cooling systems.
    *   Backplane provides power and PCIe connectivity to each Corelet slot.
    *   Backplane *does not* contain any centralized control logic.

*   **Networking:**
    *   Each Corelet establishes direct peer-to-peer connections with other Corelets via the PCIe fabric.
    *   A distributed hash table (DHT) is used to map data blocks to specific Corelets. (e.g., Chord, Pastry)
    *   Data is striped across multiple Corelets for redundancy and performance.
    *   Data replication is achieved through consistent hashing and active monitoring of Corelet health.

*   **Self-Healing Mechanism:**
    *   Each Corelet continuously monitors its own health and the health of neighboring Corelets (using heartbeat signals and data integrity checks).
    *   Upon detecting a failed Corelet, the system automatically:
        1.  Isolates the failed Corelet from the network.
        2.  Reroutes traffic to healthy Corelets that hold redundant copies of the data.
        3.  Initiates data reconstruction on a spare Corelet (if available).
        4.  Dynamically updates the DHT to reflect the new storage configuration.
    *   All of these operations are performed *autonomously* by the individual Corelets, without requiring any centralized controller intervention.

*   **Software Stack:**
    *   A lightweight operating system (e.g., Zephyr, FreeRTOS) running on each Corelet.
    *   A distributed storage management layer built on top of the DHT.
    *   Standard network protocols (e.g., iSCSI, NVMe-oF) for accessing data from external systems.

**Pseudocode (Failure Detection & Rerouting):**

```
// On each Corelet:
loop:
  send_heartbeat()
  receive_heartbeat()

  if (heartbeat_timeout(neighbor)):
    mark_neighbor_failed()
    update_routing_table(remove failed neighbor)
    re-route_traffic(to healthy neighbors)
  end if

  if (data_integrity_check_failed()):
    mark_data_invalid()
    request_data_reconstruction(from healthy neighbors)
  end if
end loop
```

**Novelty:** This system differs from existing approaches by eliminating the centralized controller. This improves scalability, reduces latency, and increases fault tolerance. It leverages distributed consensus and peer-to-peer networking to create a truly self-healing storage infrastructure. The combination of RISC-V processing, PCIe networking, and a DHT-based storage management layer enables a highly efficient and resilient storage solution.
