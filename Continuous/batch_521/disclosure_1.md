## Adaptive Metric Granularity based on Predictive Drift

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *selecting* metrics for anomaly detection. This builds on that by dynamically adjusting the *granularity* of metric collection (e.g., changing from 1-minute averages to 1-second values) *before* anomalies occur, based on predicted data drift and anticipated informational value. This moves beyond simply choosing *what* to monitor to *how* to monitor it.

**Specifications:**

**1. Drift Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Time-series data for existing metrics. Historical anomaly data.
*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict the *change* in statistical properties (mean, standard deviation, skewness) of each metric over short time horizons (e.g., next 5-15 minutes).  The LSTM will be trained on historical data, explicitly focusing on periods *leading up to* detected anomalies.
*   **Output:** A “drift score” for each metric, quantifying the predicted rate of change in its statistical properties. Higher scores indicate higher predicted drift.

**2. Informational Value Estimator:**

*   **Input:** Drift Score (from Drift Prediction Module). Current metric collection granularity. Historical anomaly detection success rate for the metric at the current granularity.
*   **Algorithm:**  A Bayesian optimization algorithm will be used to estimate the expected improvement in anomaly detection performance that could be achieved by changing the metric collection granularity. This involves modeling the relationship between granularity, drift score, and detection accuracy. The Bayesian optimizer will explore different granularity settings and update its model based on observed performance.
*   **Output:** An “improvement score” for each metric, indicating the potential benefit of adjusting the collection granularity.

**3. Granularity Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Input:** Drift Score, Improvement Score, Cost function (resource usage for higher granularity collection).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   A threshold-based system.  If Drift Score > Threshold A *and* Improvement Score > Threshold B *and* Cost < Threshold C, then increase metric granularity.
    *   Granularity levels: Coarse (1-minute average), Medium (30-second average), Fine (10-second average), Very Fine (1-second values). The engine cycles through these levels based on the scores.
    *   Dynamic Thresholds: Thresholds A, B, and C will be adjusted using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that optimizes for maximizing anomaly detection accuracy while minimizing resource usage. The RL agent will receive rewards based on anomaly detection performance and penalties for high resource consumption.
*   **Output:** Commands to the metric collection system to adjust the granularity of metric collection.

**4. Metric Collection System Integration:**

*   The system will require integration with existing metric collection infrastructure (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog).
*   An API will be provided to allow the Granularity Adjustment Engine to dynamically configure the collection frequency for each metric.
*   The system should support both push-based and pull-based metric collection models.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
For each metric in monitored_metrics:
    drift_score = DriftPredictionModule(metric.time_series_data)
    improvement_score = InformationalValueEstimator(drift_score, metric.granularity, metric.anomaly_detection_history)
    cost = ResourceUsageEstimator(metric.granularity) //Estimate cost of collecting at that granularity

    If drift_score > threshold_A AND improvement_score > threshold_B AND cost < threshold_C:
        new_granularity = NextHigherGranularity(metric.granularity)
        SetMetricGranularity(metric, new_granularity)
    Else If metric.granularity != "Coarse":
        new_granularity = NextLowerGranularity(metric.granularity)
        SetMetricGranularity(metric, new_granularity)
```

This system enables proactive adaptation of monitoring granularity, potentially improving anomaly detection accuracy and reducing false positives by focusing resources on metrics that are undergoing rapid changes.
