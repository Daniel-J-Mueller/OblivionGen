## Acoustic Scene Completion

**Concept:** Extend the acoustic event detection to *complete* acoustic scenes based on detected events, generating a synthetic soundscape representative of the environment. This goes beyond simply identifying *what* happened (footstep, speech) to reconstructing *where* and *how* it happened, providing contextual awareness beyond direct event notification.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:**  Live audio stream (mono or stereo), Event detection output (from existing system – type, confidence score, timestamp), Environmental profile data (room dimensions, materials, furniture arrangement – pre-loaded or dynamically learned via sensors/user input).
*   **Core Module: Acoustic Scene Graph Builder:**
    *   Input: Detected events, Environmental profile.
    *   Process:  Constructs a dynamic graph representing the acoustic environment. Nodes represent spatial locations (defined by environmental profile – e.g., corners, center of room, near window). Edges represent sound propagation paths weighted by distance, material absorption, and potential obstacles.  Event data populates nodes with event type and confidence.
    *   Output: Acoustic Scene Graph (ASG) – a data structure representing the detected events within a spatial context.
*   **Sound Source Modeling:**
    *   A library of parameterized sound sources (footsteps on different surfaces, speech characteristics – gender, emotion, distance). Each source has adjustable parameters (volume, pan, reverberation).
    *   Based on the event type and ASG node location, select the appropriate sound source and initialize parameters.
*   **Acoustic Ray Tracing/Simulation:**
    *   Using the ASG, simulate sound propagation from each event source. Utilize a simplified ray tracing algorithm to account for reflections, absorption, and diffraction.
    *   Generate a synthetic sound field representing the simulated acoustic environment.
*   **Output Module:**
    *   Stereo audio output representing the completed acoustic scene.
    *   Visualization (optional): Display the ASG as a 3D model with event indicators.
    *   API: Provide access to the ASG data for external applications (e.g., augmented reality, smart home control).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (audio_data_available()) {
    detect_events(audio_data);
    for each (event in detected_events) {
        update_acoustic_scene_graph(event); // Add event to graph based on location/environment
        synthesize_sound_source(event); // Select sound source and parameters
        propagate_sound(sound_source, acoustic_scene_graph); // Simulate sound propagation
    }
    output_completed_scene(); // Generate stereo audio
}
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   **Dynamic Learning:** Implement a machine learning component to dynamically learn room acoustics and refine the ray tracing model over time.
*   **Multi-modal Integration:** Integrate visual data (from cameras) to improve event localization and scene understanding.
*   **Personalization:** Allow users to customize the synthesized soundscape (e.g., adjust reverb, add ambient sounds).
*   **Application:** Enable users to "listen in" on a remote location, providing a more immersive experience than simple event notifications.  Could be used for security monitoring, remote assistance, or entertainment.
