## Dynamic Proximity-Based Service Orchestration

**Concept:** Leverage the sensor data and arrival detection system to proactively orchestrate services *around* the customer's predicted path and dwell time, beyond simply tracking wait times. Instead of just determining *how long* a customer waits, predict *what they might need* while en route or during their brief stay, and preemptively offer those services.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time sensor data (location, velocity, acceleration) from customer’s device.
    *   Historical customer data (purchase history, preferences, common routes).
    *   Real-time data from the merchant location (inventory levels, staffing, promotions, service availability – e.g., curbside pickup spots, specific employee availability).
    *   External data feeds (weather, traffic, local events).

*   **Core Logic – Predictive Service Engine:**
    1.  **Path Prediction:** Using current sensor data and historical routes, predict the customer's travel path to the merchant.  Refine this prediction continuously based on new data.
    2.  **Dwell Time Estimation:**  Estimate the likely duration of the customer’s visit based on order complexity, historical data for similar orders, and potentially, customer-provided input (e.g., "quick pickup" vs. "browsing").
    3.  **Service Opportunity Identification:** Based on predicted path and dwell time, identify relevant service opportunities. This could include:
        *   **Route-Based Services:**  "Traffic ahead on your route, would you like us to reroute you to a faster path?" (integrated with navigation apps). "Nearby coffee shop with a discount for our customers."
        *   **Proactive Order Adjustments:** "We're out of [item]. Would you like to substitute with [similar item]?" (offered *before* arrival).
        *   **In-Location Services:** "Curbside pickup spot is now available." "We've pre-staged your order for faster service." "Would you like to add a drink to your order while you wait?" "Exclusive in-store discount on related items."
        *   **Personalized Offers:** "Based on your past purchases, we recommend [item] and have a coupon ready for you."
    4.  **Orchestration & Delivery:**  Deliver these service opportunities through multiple channels:
        *   Mobile App Notifications (primary).
        *   In-Car Integration (via infotainment systems).
        *   Digital Signage at the Merchant Location.
        *   Automated communication with Merchant Staff (e.g., alerting staff to pre-stage an order).

*   **Pseudocode (Service Opportunity Identification):**

```
function identifyServiceOpportunities(customerData, merchantData, externalData):
  predictedPath = predictPath(customerData.location, customerData.historicalRoutes)
  estimatedDwellTime = estimateDwellTime(customerData.order, merchantData.orderHistory)

  opportunities = []

  //Route-based opportunities
  if (externalData.trafficAlerts[predictedPath]):
    opportunities.add("TrafficAlert: RerouteSuggestion")

  if (nearbyPOI(predictedPath, "CoffeeShop", 0.5km)):
    opportunities.add("CoffeeShopDiscount")

  //In-location opportunities
  if (merchantData.inventory[customerData.order.item] == "Out of Stock"):
    opportunities.add("SubstituteSuggestion")

  if (merchantData.curbsideSpotAvailable == true):
    opportunities.add("CurbsideSpotReady")

  //Personalized offers
  for item in customerData.purchaseHistory:
    if similarItemAvailable(item, merchantData.inventory):
      opportunities.add("PersonalizedOffer: " + similarItem)

  return opportunities
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Existing smartphone sensors, potentially integration with vehicle infotainment systems, Merchant location sensors/connectivity.
*   **Software Requirements:** Machine learning models for path prediction, dwell time estimation, and service opportunity identification.  API integrations with navigation apps, external data feeds, and Merchant systems.
