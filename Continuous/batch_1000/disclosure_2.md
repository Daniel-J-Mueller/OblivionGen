## Dynamic Segment Weighting via Real-Time Behavioral Signals

**Concept:** Extend RFM segmentation by introducing dynamic weighting of RFM components (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) *in real-time* based on immediate user behavior. This moves beyond static segment assignment and allows for ‘micro-segments’ reflecting momentary intent.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Signal Ingestion:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Clickstream Data:** Track all user clicks on catalog items (dwell time, sequence).
    *   **Search Queries:** Capture user search terms.
    *   **Add-to-Cart Actions:**  Monitor items added to cart, quantity, and time since addition.
    *   **Wishlist/Save Activity:** Track saved items and frequency of saving.
    *   **Social Signals (Optional):**  If integrated, monitor likes, shares, comments related to catalog items.
*   **Real-Time Processing:**  All signals are ingested into a real-time stream processing engine (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Flink).

**2. Dynamic RFM Weighting Algorithm:**

*   **Baseline RFM Scores:**  Maintain standard RFM scores for each user as in the original patent.
*   **Behavioral Feature Extraction:**  From the ingested signals, extract relevant features:
    *   **Category Affinity:** Calculate affinity scores for different product categories based on clicks/views.
    *   **Price Sensitivity:**  Determine price range of viewed/clicked items.
    *   **Intent Strength:**  Combine add-to-cart, wishlist, and dwell time to estimate purchase intent.
    *   **Session Recency:** Time since last action in the current session.
*   **Weight Adjustment Function:** Define a function that dynamically adjusts RFM weights based on extracted features.
    *   `Weight_Recency = Baseline_Recency_Weight + α * Session_Recency + β * Category_Affinity`
    *   `Weight_Frequency = Baseline_Frequency_Weight + γ * Intent_Strength`
    *   `Weight_Monetary = Baseline_Monetary_Weight + δ * Price_Sensitivity`
    *   (α, β, γ, δ are adjustable parameters tuned through A/B testing).  Parameters can be category specific.
*   **Recalculation Frequency:** RFM scores and segment assignment are recalculated *every few seconds* or based on significant behavioral changes.

**3. Micro-Segment Creation & Recommendation:**

*   **Dynamic Segmentation:** Users are not assigned to static segments. Instead, a 'current segment profile' is maintained, reflecting the dynamically weighted RFM scores.  This creates a continuum of segment profiles.
*   **Nearest Neighbor Recommendation:**  Identify users with *similar current segment profiles*.  Recommend items purchased or viewed by these nearest neighbors.
*   **Hybrid Recommendation:** Combine nearest neighbor recommendations with traditional content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** A robust A/B testing framework is essential to tune the weight adjustment function and evaluate the performance of the dynamic recommendation system.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Real-Time Stream Processing Engine:** Kafka/Flink
*   **Feature Store:** Store extracted behavioral features for fast access.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** Dedicated service for generating recommendations.
*   **API Gateway:** Expose recommendation API to frontend applications.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Monitor system performance and alert on anomalies.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Service):**

```
function getRecommendations(userID):
  userProfile = getUserProfile(userID)
  behavioralFeatures = getBehavioralFeatures(userID)
  dynamicRFM = calculateDynamicRFM(userProfile, behavioralFeatures)
  nearestNeighbors = findNearestNeighbors(dynamicRFM)
  recommendations = generateHybridRecommendations(nearestNeighbors)
  return recommendations
```

This system aims to provide *hyper-personalized* recommendations that adapt to the user’s immediate needs and interests, increasing engagement and conversion rates.
