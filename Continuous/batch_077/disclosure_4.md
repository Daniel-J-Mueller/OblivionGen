## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Audio Morphing

**Concept:** Leverage the AVCL system’s ability to categorize and adjust audio to not just *process* sound, but to *reconstruct* an acoustic scene and then morph it based on user preference or simulated environments. This moves beyond simple volume leveling to active soundscape design.

**Specs:**

1.  **Acoustic Scene Capture Module:**
    *   Input: Multi-channel audio stream (minimum stereo, ideally 4+ channels)
    *   Processing: Utilize the existing audio categorization (music, speech, etc.).  Supplement with real-time sound event detection (SED) – identifying specific sounds like “car horn,” “dog bark,” “running water,” etc.  Extend categorization to environmental classes: “indoor – bedroom,” “outdoor – city street,” “concert hall.”
    *   Output:  A data structure representing the "acoustic scene" -  a weighted list of identified audio categories *and* sound events, with timestamps and estimated spatial location (using inter-channel time differences).

2.  **Scene Database & Morphing Profiles:**
    *   Database: A pre-populated database of acoustic scene “templates” –  baseline acoustic scenes (e.g., "busy cafe," "quiet forest," "rainy night").  These templates are defined by the weighted lists described above.
    *   Morphing Profiles: User-defined or pre-set “morphing profiles” that define how the current acoustic scene should be altered to resemble a target scene. These profiles specify weighting adjustments to different sound categories/events. Example:  "Reduce traffic noise by 80%, increase bird sounds by 50%."

3.  **Real-time Audio Morphing Engine:**
    *   Input: Current acoustic scene data, selected morphing profile.
    *   Processing:
        *   Calculate desired weighting adjustments based on the morphing profile.
        *   Apply gain adjustments to individual audio streams (identified categories/events) to achieve the desired weighting. This utilizes the existing AVCL gain curves, but dynamically modifies the curve parameters.
        *   Employ spatial audio techniques (HRTF filtering, ambisonics) to simulate changes in sound source location and direction.
        *   Implement “acoustic event insertion” – adding synthesized or pre-recorded sound events to the morphed scene to enhance realism (e.g., adding gentle rain sounds to a quiet indoor scene).
        *   Use a ‘diffusion’ module to smooth transitions between morphs and to prevent jarring changes in the soundscape.
    *   Output: Morphed audio stream.

4.  **Personalization & Adaptation:**
    *   User Profiles: Store user preferences for morphing profiles and soundscape aesthetics.
    *   Adaptive Learning:  Monitor user interaction (e.g., manual adjustments to the soundscape) and use machine learning to refine morphing profiles and personalize the listening experience.
    *   Contextual Awareness:  Integrate with external sensors (location, time of day, weather) to automatically adjust the soundscape based on the user’s environment.

**Pseudocode (Morphing Engine Core):**

```
function MorphAudio(currentScene, morphProfile, audioStreams):
    desiredWeights = CalculateDesiredWeights(currentScene, morphProfile)
    morphedStreams = []
    for stream in audioStreams:
        category = stream.category
        originalWeight = currentScene.getWeight(category)
        desiredWeight = desiredWeights.getWeight(category)
        gainAdjustment = desiredWeight / originalWeight
        morphedStream = ApplyGain(stream, gainAdjustment)
        morphedStreams.append(morphedStream)
    
    mixedAudio = MixAudio(morphedStreams)
    
    return mixedAudio
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Personalized audio experiences for VR/AR.
*   Noise cancellation and sound masking tailored to specific environments.
*   Adaptive soundscapes for mental wellness and relaxation.
*   Simulating realistic audio environments for gaming and entertainment.
*   Aiding the hearing impaired by selectively enhancing desired sounds.
