**Adaptive Liquid Lens Array for Dynamic Focal Control**

**Concept:** Replace the fixed lens elements with an array of individually controllable liquid lenses. This allows for dynamic adjustment of focal length, field of view, and distortion *after* manufacturing, potentially optimizing performance for different imaging scenarios or compensating for manufacturing variations.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:** 4x4 array of microfluidic liquid lenses, replacing the current four molded plastic elements. Each liquid lens is approximately 1.5mm diameter.
*   **Liquid Composition:** Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EOD) fluid â€“ a dielectric liquid with a conductive coating. Voltage applied to electrodes controls the liquid-air interface, changing the lens curvature.
*   **Control System:** Microcontroller with individual PWM outputs for each liquid lens.  A feedback system employing miniature CMOS image sensors embedded within the lens array provides real-time curvature measurements.
*   **Actuation Voltage:** 0-50V DC, programmable via microcontroller.
*   **Communication Protocol:** I2C for microcontroller communication.
*   **Image Processing:** Software algorithm running on an embedded processor to correlate lens curvature with image distortion and focus.  The algorithm dynamically adjusts the voltage applied to each lens to minimize distortion and maximize sharpness.
*   **Power Consumption:** < 500mW total for the array and control system.
*   **Material:** Transparent polymer substrate for liquid lens containment.
*   **Calibration Procedure:** Initial calibration phase to map voltage to lens curvature and correct for manufacturing imperfections.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Focus/Distortion Correction):**

```
// Image Acquisition
captureImage()

// Image Analysis - Edge Detection & Sharpness Calculation
edges = detectEdges(image)
sharpness = calculateSharpness(image)

// Distortion Map Creation (based on edge analysis)
distortionMap = createDistortionMap(edges)

// Optimization Algorithm (Gradient Descent or similar)
for each lens in array:
  voltage = initialVoltage //Start with pre-calibrated voltage

  while delta_sharpness > threshold:
    adjustVoltage(lens, delta) //Small voltage change
    captureImage()
    new_sharpness = calculateSharpness(image)
    if new_sharpness > sharpness:
      //Accept Change
      sharpness = new_sharpness
    else:
      //Reject change, revert voltage
      revertVoltage(lens)

  storeOptimalVoltage(lens, voltage)
```

**Refinement:**

*   Investigate incorporating micro-mirrors within each liquid lens cell for beam steering and further control over field of view.
*   Explore using machine learning to predict optimal lens configurations based on scene characteristics (e.g., detecting faces and prioritizing sharpness in that region).
*   Develop a self-calibration routine that automatically adjusts lens parameters to compensate for temperature variations or mechanical drift.
*   Consider integrating a polarization filter into each liquid lens element to reduce glare and improve contrast.
