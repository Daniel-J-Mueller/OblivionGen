## Adaptive Emotional State Routing

**Concept:** Expand the agent selection criteria to include real-time assessment of *user emotional state* via voice analysis, and dynamically route calls to agents possessing complementary emotional profiles. This moves beyond skill-based routing to *emotional resonance* routing, potentially increasing call resolution rates and customer satisfaction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Emotional State Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time audio stream from incoming call.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a trained machine learning model (e.g., using spectrograms & recurrent neural networks) to analyze voice features (pitch, tone, speech rate, pauses, energy levels).
    *   Categorize detected emotional state into a predefined set (e.g., Happy, Neutral, Frustrated, Angry, Sad). Confidence scores for each category are generated.
    *   Output: Emotional State vector (e.g., \[Happy: 0.1, Neutral: 0.2, Frustrated: 0.6, Angry: 0.1, Sad: 0.0]) & overall "Emotional Intensity" score (sum of confidence scores).

**2. Agent Emotional Profile Database:**

*   Data Points:
    *   **Baseline Emotional Profile:** Determined via a standardized psychological assessment (e.g., Big Five personality traits) & ongoing performance reviews. Represented as a vector (e.g., \[Calmness: 0.8, Empathy: 0.7, Assertiveness: 0.5]).
    *   **Dynamic Emotional State:** Continuously tracked via agent self-reporting (brief, regular check-ins via a dedicated interface) & potentially, subtle analysis of their communication during calls (with appropriate privacy safeguards).
    *   **Emotional Resilience Score:** A metric indicating the agent’s ability to remain calm and effective under pressure.

**3.  Adaptive Routing Algorithm:**

*   **Input:**  User Emotional State vector, User Emotional Intensity score, Agent Emotional Profile Database.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Identify a pool of eligible agents based on skill requirements and availability (as defined in the provided patent).
    2.  Calculate an "Emotional Compatibility Score" for each agent in the pool:
        *   Emotional Compatibility Score =  `∑ (UserEmotionᵢ * AgentEmotionᵢ)`  (sum of element-wise products of user & agent emotional vectors).
        *   Adjust for Emotional Intensity: If User Emotional Intensity > threshold, prioritize agents with high “Calmness” or “Empathy” scores.
        *   Apply weighting factors to different emotional dimensions based on call type (e.g., prioritize Empathy for support calls, Assertiveness for sales calls).
    3.  Rank agents based on Emotional Compatibility Score (combined with skill & availability factors).
    4.  Select the top-ranked agent and route the call.

**4.  Real-time Agent Support:**

*   Integrate with agent desktop interface to display User Emotional State (e.g., visual representation of emotional vector, a simple descriptor like “Frustrated”).
*   Provide agents with real-time coaching tips based on detected emotional state (e.g., "Active listening is crucial," "Use a calm and reassuring tone").

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION route_call(user_audio_stream):
  user_emotional_state = analyze_audio(user_audio_stream)
  eligible_agents = get_eligible_agents()

  FOR agent IN eligible_agents:
    emotional_compatibility = calculate_compatibility(user_emotional_state, agent.emotional_profile)
    agent.score = emotional_compatibility + agent.skill_score + agent.availability_score
  
  sorted_agents = sort_agents_by_score(agents)
  selected_agent = sorted_agents[0]

  route_call_to_agent(selected_agent)
```
