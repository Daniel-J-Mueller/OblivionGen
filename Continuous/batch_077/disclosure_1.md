**Dynamic Predictive Substitution & Tiered Fulfillment**

**Concept:** Expand the time-to-fulfill prediction beyond simple item availability to proactively suggest *substitute* items with shorter lead times, presented to the customer *before* order confirmation, and intelligently tier fulfillment strategies based on predicted availability and customer preference.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time inventory levels (existing)
    *   Supplier lead times (existing)
    *   Historical sales data (existing)
    *   **New:** Item attribute database (e.g., color, size, material, function – beyond simple SKU). This allows for semantic similarity calculations between items.
    *   **New:** Customer preference profile (explicitly stated or inferred from purchase history) – including willingness to accept substitutions, preferred brands, and price sensitivity.
    *   **New:** External data feeds – trending product data, social media mentions (to predict potential supply chain disruptions).
*   **Substitution Engine:**
    *   Given an item in the order, identify potential substitutes based on attribute similarity (using a vector space model or similar technique).
    *   Calculate a “substitution score” based on attribute similarity, price difference, and customer preference.
    *   Rank potential substitutes.
*   **Tiered Fulfillment Strategy:**
    *   **Tier 1 (Immediate):** Items in stock, immediate shipment.
    *   **Tier 2 (Predictive):** Items not in stock, but predicted to be available within a short timeframe (based on restocking orders, supplier data, and historical patterns). Include estimated availability date.
    *   **Tier 3 (Substitution):** Items not in stock, with viable substitutes available.  Present substitution options to the customer *before* order confirmation.
    *   **Tier 4 (Backorder/Delay):** Items not in stock, with no viable substitutes and a long predicted lead time. Clearly indicate the delay to the customer.
*   **Customer Interface:**
    *   During the order process, visually indicate the fulfillment tier for each item.
    *   For Tier 3 items, present the substitution options with images, prices, and a “substitution score.” Allow the customer to accept or reject the substitution.
    *   Clearly display the estimated delivery date for each item, factoring in the fulfillment tier and shipping time.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Microservice-based architecture. Separate services for inventory management, supplier data integration, substitution engine, and customer interface.
    *   API-based communication between services.
    *   Real-time data streaming using technologies like Kafka or RabbitMQ.
    *   Machine learning models for predicting availability and calculating substitution scores.

**Pseudocode (Substitution Engine):**

```
function find_substitutes(item_sku, customer_preferences):
  item_attributes = get_item_attributes(item_sku)
  candidate_substitutes = query_item_database(item_attributes)

  for substitute_sku in candidate_substitutes:
    substitute_attributes = get_item_attributes(substitute_sku)
    similarity_score = calculate_attribute_similarity(item_attributes, substitute_attributes)
    price_difference = calculate_price_difference(item_sku, substitute_sku)
    preference_score = evaluate_customer_preference(substitute_sku, customer_preferences)

    combined_score = (similarity_score * weight_similarity) + (preference_score * weight_preference) - (price_difference * weight_price)

    substitute_scores[substitute_sku] = combined_score

  sorted_substitutes = sort_substitutes_by_score(substitute_scores)

  return sorted_substitutes
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Proactive substitution suggestions *before* the customer even adds the item to the cart.
*   Dynamic pricing adjustments to incentivize substitution.
*   Integration with social media to identify trending products and predict potential supply chain disruptions.
*   Automated backorder management with intelligent reordering based on predicted demand.
