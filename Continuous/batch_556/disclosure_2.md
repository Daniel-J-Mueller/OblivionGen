## Transactional Data Mirroring with Predictive Consistency

**Concept:** Extend the multi-candidate transaction framework to proactively create mirrored, potentially inconsistent, data copies for predictive analytics *before* transaction commitment. This allows analytical workloads to operate on 'future' data states without blocking or impacting transactional performance. The system manages resolution of inconsistencies post-commitment.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Mirroring Layer:**

*   **Mirror Creation Trigger:** Upon initiation of an ‘election transaction’, a mirroring process begins. This process doesn’t require full data duplication; differential mirroring (only changes) is preferred.
*   **Mirror Location:** Mirrors reside in a separate storage tier optimized for analytical reads (e.g., columnar database, data lake).
*   **Mirror Isolation:** Mirrors are initially isolated from the primary transactional data. Updates from candidate transactions are applied to the mirror *asynchronously*.

**2. Candidate Transaction Interception & Mirror Application:**

*   **Transaction Metadata Extension:**  Each candidate transaction’s metadata includes a ‘mirror application flag’. This flag indicates if updates from that transaction are being applied to the mirror.
*   **Differential Update Stream:** A stream captures differential changes made by each candidate transaction.  The format must include transaction ID, candidate ID, operation type (insert, update, delete), and data.
*   **Asynchronous Mirror Update:** A dedicated process consumes the differential update stream and applies changes to the mirror.  Conflict resolution (see section 4) is performed during this application.

**3.  Predictive Analytics Access:**

*   **Read-Only Mirror Access:** Analytical workloads connect *exclusively* to the mirrored data.
*   **Snapshot Isolation:** Analytical queries operate on a consistent snapshot of the mirror at the time of query initiation.
*   **"Future State" Queries:** Queries can be formulated assuming data updates are already committed (even if they aren’t).

**4.  Consistency Resolution & Reconciliation:**

*   **Commit Trigger:**  Upon successful commitment of the election transaction, a reconciliation process begins.
*   **Mirror Validation:** The mirror is compared to the committed primary data.
*   **Reconciliation Strategies:**
    *   **Automatic Resolution:** For simple conflicts (e.g., last-write-wins), resolution is automatic.
    *   **Deferred Resolution:** For complex conflicts, a deferred resolution queue is created.  A dedicated service manages these conflicts, potentially involving user intervention or application-specific logic.
    *   **Rollback Mechanism:** In cases of unresolvable conflicts, a rollback mechanism is available to revert the mirror to a known consistent state.
*   **Metadata Synchronization:**  Mirror metadata (e.g., timestamps, version numbers) is synchronized with the primary data metadata.

**5.  Pseudocode - Mirror Application Process:**

```
Process MirrorApplication(DifferentialUpdate update) {
    //Lock Mirror Record (optimistic locking preferred)
    Try {
        //Apply Update to Mirror
        ApplyOperation(update.operationType, update.data);
        //Update Mirror Version
        IncrementVersion(MirrorRecord);
        //Log Success
        Log("Mirror Updated Successfully");
    }
    Catch (ConflictException e) {
        //Handle Conflict – potentially queue for resolution
        QueueForResolution(e);
        Log("Conflict Detected – Queued for Resolution");
    }
}

Process QueueForResolution(ConflictException e) {
  // Store conflict details (transaction ID, data, timestamp)
  StoreConflict(e);

  // Notify resolution service
  NotifyResolutionService(e);
}
```

**6. API Extensions:**

*   `CreateMirror(electionTransactionID)`: Initiates mirror creation for a given transaction.
*   `QueryMirror(electionTransactionID, query)`: Executes a query against the mirror.
*   `ResolveConflict(conflictID, resolutionAction)`:  Provides a mechanism to resolve conflicts manually.
