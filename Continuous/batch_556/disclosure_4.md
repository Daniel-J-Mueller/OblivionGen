## Dynamic Wake Word Fusion & Contextual Triggering

**Concept:** Extend wake word detection beyond a single, static phrase to a dynamic system leveraging multiple potential 'wake phrases' and contextual awareness to initiate processing. This moves beyond simply *hearing* a phrase to *understanding* the userâ€™s intent *before* they fully articulate it, leading to faster and more reliable activation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Wake Phrase Database & Prioritization:**

*   **Data Structure:** A database storing multiple potential wake phrases, weighted by user preference, environmental factors (noise level, location), and predicted user intent.  Example: `[{phrase: "Hey System", weight: 0.8, environment: "home", intent: "general"}, {phrase: "Launch Music", weight: 0.7, environment: "car", intent: "entertainment"}, {phrase: "Call Mom", weight: 0.9, environment: "home", intent: "communication"}]`
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  The system continuously adjusts phrase weights based on user interactions.  Frequency of use, confirmation/rejection of processed requests, and explicit user preferences influence weights.
*   **Phrase Variants:** Each phrase includes multiple phonetic variants to account for accents and speech patterns.

**2. Contextual Awareness Engine:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate data from multiple sensors: microphone, accelerometer, GPS, calendar, connected devices (smart home, car).
*   **Intent Prediction:** Employ a machine learning model to predict user intent based on sensor data.  Examples: "User is in the car -> likely intent is navigation/entertainment," "User is in the kitchen -> likely intent is timer/recipe lookup," "User is near a smart light -> likely intent is illumination control."
*   **Contextual Weighting:** Multiply phrase weights by contextual relevance scores. A phrase strongly associated with the predicted intent receives a significantly higher weight.

**3.  Adaptive Trigger Threshold:**

*   **Confidence Scoring:**  The wake word engine assigns a confidence score to each detected phrase based on acoustic similarity and contextual relevance.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  The activation threshold isn't fixed. It's dynamically adjusted based on:
    *   **Environmental Noise:**  Higher noise levels require a higher threshold.
    *   **User Activity:**  During periods of high activity (e.g., driving), a more lenient threshold can be used to ensure responsiveness.
    *   **Confidence Score History:** Track user interactions and adjust threshold for false positives.

**4.  Partial Phrase Detection & Completion:**

*   **Early Detection:** The system attempts to detect partial phrases.  For example, if the user starts saying "Launch Mu...", the system increases the probability of the "Launch Music" phrase being triggered.
*   **Completion Prediction:**  Based on the partial phrase and user history, the system predicts the most likely completion.
*   **Confirmation Prompt:** If multiple completions are possible, a subtle auditory prompt (e.g., a chime) can indicate the predicted completion. The user can then continue speaking to confirm or correct.

**5. Pseudocode Implementation (Core Loop):**

```
loop:
    audio_data = capture_audio()
    detected_phrases = wake_word_engine.detect_phrases(audio_data)

    for phrase in detected_phrases:
        contextual_weight = contextual_awareness_engine.calculate_weight(phrase)
        weighted_confidence = phrase.confidence * contextual_weight

        if weighted_confidence > adaptive_threshold:
            trigger_action(phrase)
            break # Prevent multiple triggers for a single utterance
```

**6.  Additional Features:**

*   **Custom Wake Word Enrollment:** Allow users to enroll completely custom wake words.
*   **Multi-User Support:**  Profile-based wake word detection.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Implement on-device processing where possible and provide clear user controls over data collection.
