## Dynamic Data Lake Federation

**Concept:** A system enabling real-time federation of data lakes across multiple multi-tenant environments, optimized for diverse client application needs and varying data governance policies. Building on the idea of transforming data on-demand, this goes further by *actively* composing a unified, virtual data lake from disparate sources *as* queries are executed.

**Specs:**

*   **Federation Controller:** A central service responsible for cataloging available data lakes, their schemas, and associated governance policies. Maintains a ‘federation map’ detailing relationships and transformation capabilities between lakes.
*   **Query Planner (Augmented):** Modifies the existing query planner to incorporate federation awareness. Upon receiving a client query, the planner analyzes data requirements and determines optimal data lake participation based on:
    *   Data location (latency, cost)
    *   Schema compatibility
    *   Governance restrictions (access control, data masking)
    *   Real-time data lake load.
*   **Dynamic Transformation Engine:**  A distributed engine capable of performing complex transformations on data *in-flight* as it’s being retrieved from federated data lakes. This engine utilizes a 'transformation recipe' derived from the query and federation map.
*   **Virtual Data Lake Layer:** A unified interface presented to the client application. This layer abstracts the complexity of federation and presents data as if it resided in a single, coherent data lake.
*   **Data Governance Enforcement:**  Integration with existing governance frameworks. Allows policies to be dynamically applied to federated data based on client identity, data sensitivity, and regional regulations.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing Flow):**

```
function processQuery(query, clientIdentity) {
  federationMap = FederationController.getFederationMap()
  candidateLakes = QueryPlanner.findCandidateLakes(query, federationMap, clientIdentity)

  transformationRecipes = QueryPlanner.generateTransformationRecipes(query, candidateLakes)

  dataStreams = []
  for (lake in candidateLakes) {
    stream = lake.retrieveData(query)
    transformedStream = DynamicTransformationEngine.transform(stream, transformationRecipes[lake])
    dataStreams.push(transformedStream)
  }

  unifiedDataStream = DataStreamMerger.merge(dataStreams)
  return unifiedDataStream
}
```

**Innovation Focus:** The system *doesn’t* materialize a unified copy of the data. It composes it on demand, making it ideal for rapidly changing data landscapes and minimizing storage costs.  It's a shift from ‘data at rest’ to ‘data in motion’ for the purposes of federation.  The integration of client identity and governance at the query planning level offers granular access control and enables compliance with diverse regulatory requirements. Think of it as a 'data mesh' implementation completely in software, orchestrated at query time.
