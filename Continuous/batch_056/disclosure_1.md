## Adaptive Cover Tree Dimensionality Reduction with Learned Metrics

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on partitioning data *using* a cover tree for efficient k-NN queries. This builds upon that by making the cover tree *itself* adaptive and learned, dynamically reducing dimensionality based on query patterns and data drift. Instead of a fixed cover tree structure, this creates a cover tree where node splits are optimized through reinforcement learning, and distances *within* the tree are not Euclidean, but learned metrics tailored to the data distribution.

**Specifications:**

**1. Learned Metric Space:**

*   **Embedding Layer:** An initial embedding layer maps the input vector to a higher-dimensional space. This allows for more complex relationships to be captured.
*   **Metric Network:** A small neural network (e.g., a multi-layer perceptron) learns a distance metric in this embedded space.  Input: Pair of vectors. Output: A scalar distance.
*   **Training Data:**  The metric network is trained using triplet loss or contrastive loss. Triplet loss requires generating triplets of (anchor, positive, negative) samples, while contrastive loss uses pairs of similar/dissimilar samples.  Data for training can come from existing k-NN query logs or be generated synthetically.

**2. Reinforcement Learning for Cover Tree Construction:**

*   **State:** The state for the RL agent is defined by the current node in the cover tree, the distribution of data points within that node (e.g., variance, mean), and the recent query patterns (e.g., frequently queried regions).
*   **Action:** The action space consists of:
    *   **Split Dimension:**  Choose the dimension to split the current node.
    *   **Split Value:**  Choose the value at which to split.
    *   **Stop Splitting:**  Terminate further splitting at this node.
*   **Reward:** The reward function is designed to encourage:
    *   **Fast Queries:** Higher reward for queries that are resolved with fewer tree traversals.
    *   **Balanced Tree:** Reward for maintaining a balanced tree structure.
    *   **Low Latency:** Penalize high latency queries.
*   **Algorithm:** Use a policy gradient method (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO) to train the RL agent.

**3. Dynamic Dimensionality Reduction:**

*   **Pruning:** After the RL agent constructs the cover tree, a pruning step is performed. Nodes with low entropy (i.e., containing only a few data points) are removed.
*   **Adaptive Resolution:** Different branches of the cover tree can have different resolutions. Branches that are frequently queried have higher resolution (more nodes), while those that are rarely queried have lower resolution.

**4. Query Processing:**

1.  **Embedding:** Embed the query vector using the embedding layer.
2.  **Tree Traversal:** Traverse the cover tree using the learned metric.
3.  **Candidate Selection:** Select a small number of candidate data points from the leaf nodes.
4.  **Refinement:** Calculate the distance between the query vector and the candidate data points using the learned metric.
5.  **Return:** Return the k nearest neighbors.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function kNearestNeighbors(query_vector, k):
  embedded_query = embedding_layer(query_vector)
  current_node = root_node

  while current_node is not a leaf node:
    split_dimension = current_node.split_dimension
    split_value = current_node.split_value

    if embedded_query[split_dimension] <= split_value:
      current_node = current_node.left_child
    else:
      current_node = current_node.right_child

  candidates = current_node.data_points

  distances = [learned_metric(embedded_query, embedded_candidate) for embedded_candidate in candidates]
  sorted_indices = sorted(range(len(distances)), key=lambda i: distances[i])

  nearest_neighbors = [candidates[i] for i in sorted_indices[:k]]
  return nearest_neighbors
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for the metric network and embedding layer.
*   Distributed storage for the data points.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Federated learning for training the metric network on distributed data.
*   Online learning for adapting the cover tree to changing data distributions.
*   Exploration strategies for discovering new relevant regions in the data space.
