## Dynamic Reputation Propagation & Predictive Blocking

**Concept:** Extend the risk scoring to not just the *requesting* account, but to propagate reputation scores across interconnected accounts and *predictively* block requests based on anticipated future risk, rather than solely reacting to current indicators.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Account Graph:** A dynamically updating graph database representing relationships between customer accounts.  Edges represent relationships – e.g., shared payment methods, shared devices (IP/device fingerprint), shared addresses, linked sub-accounts, common beneficiaries/recipients.  Edge weight reflects the strength/frequency of the connection.
*   **Reputation Score:** Each account node in the graph possesses a Reputation Score, initialized at a neutral value. This score is influenced by flagged activity (fraud, policy violations) *and* the Reputation Scores of connected accounts.
*   **Propagation Algorithm:** A weighted averaging algorithm that propagates Reputation Score changes across the Account Graph.  The weights are derived from the edge weights and a ‘decay factor’ representing the time since the originating event. (Higher decay = reputation fades quickly).
*   **Predictive Risk Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical account behavior, account graph structure, and propagation patterns. This model predicts the *likelihood* of fraudulent activity for a given account within a specific timeframe (e.g., next 24 hours).
*   **Dynamic Blocking Thresholds:** Blocking thresholds are *not* static. They are determined dynamically based on the Predictive Risk Engine's output *and* the criticality of the requested action.  High-risk actions (e.g., large fund transfer) have higher thresholds than low-risk actions (e.g., account information update).

**II. System Architecture:**

1.  **Event Ingestion:** All account activity (requests, logins, transactions) is ingested into a real-time stream processing engine (e.g., Kafka, Flink).
2.  **Account Graph Update:** The stream processing engine updates the Account Graph based on new activity.  Edges are created/modified, and Reputation Scores are adjusted based on the event type and account involved.
3.  **Reputation Propagation:** A scheduled job (or triggered event) executes the Reputation Propagation Algorithm, updating Reputation Scores across the graph.
4.  **Predictive Risk Scoring:**  Before processing a request, the Predictive Risk Engine calculates a risk score for the requesting account, incorporating its current Reputation Score, its connections in the Account Graph, and historical patterns.
5.  **Dynamic Blocking:** The system compares the Predictive Risk Score to the dynamically calculated blocking threshold for the requested action. If the score exceeds the threshold, the request is blocked, flagged for review, or subjected to additional verification (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

**III. Pseudocode (Predictive Risk Engine):**

```
FUNCTION CalculatePredictiveRiskScore(accountId, requestedAction):
  currentReputation = GetAccountReputation(accountId)
  connectedAccounts = GetConnectedAccounts(accountId)
  aggregateReputation = 0

  FOR each account IN connectedAccounts:
    aggregateReputation += GetAccountReputation(account) * GetEdgeWeight(accountId, account)

  historicalFeatures = GetHistoricalFeatures(accountId) // features like transaction frequency, login locations, etc.

  // Model Input: currentReputation, aggregateReputation, historicalFeatures
  riskScore = PredictiveModel.Predict(currentReputation, aggregateReputation, historicalFeatures)

  RETURN riskScore
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION GetDynamicBlockingThreshold(requestedAction):
  actionRiskLevel = GetActionRiskLevel(requestedAction) // High, Medium, Low
  threshold = BaseThreshold[actionRiskLevel] +  GlobalRiskAdjustmentFactor
  RETURN threshold
END FUNCTION
```

**IV.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **Explainability:**  The system should provide explanations for why a request was blocked, highlighting the contributing factors (e.g., reputation of connected accounts, historical patterns).
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The PredictiveModel should be continuously retrained with new data to improve accuracy and adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
*   **Privacy:** The system must be designed to protect user privacy, anonymizing or masking sensitive data where appropriate.  The degree of graph connectivity needs to be carefully balanced against privacy concerns.
*   **Scalability:**  The Account Graph and Reputation Propagation Algorithm must be scalable to handle large numbers of accounts and transactions. Distributed graph databases and parallel processing techniques may be required.
