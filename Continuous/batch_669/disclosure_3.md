**Adaptive Packaging & Environmental Triggered Reordering**

**Concept:** Expand the tracking device functionality beyond simple reordering to encompass adaptive packaging and proactive environmental condition-based replenishment. The device isn't just *reporting* removal from an item, but influencing the item’s immediate environment and initiating actions based on sensed changes.

**Specifications:**

*   **Device Core:** RFID/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tag with integrated micro-sensors: temperature, humidity, light exposure, vibration, and a miniature pressure sensor.  Power source: Energy harvesting (vibration/light) supplemented by a small, replaceable coin cell battery.
*   **Packaging Integration:** The RFID tag is integrated into a smart packaging component – a thin, biodegradable/compostable film that adheres to the product’s packaging. This film contains micro-capsules filled with a substance that changes state based on environmental conditions (e.g., a color-changing dye, a phase-change material for temperature regulation, or a desiccant).
*   **Sensing & Action Triggers:**
    *   **Temperature/Humidity:** If the sensed temperature/humidity exceeds/falls below a predefined threshold for the product (configurable via a mobile app), the micro-capsules activate, visually indicating a potential problem (color change) *and* triggering an immediate reorder request.  Thresholds are learned over time, adapting to user preferences and environmental patterns.
    *   **Light Exposure:** For light-sensitive items, the device detects prolonged or intense light exposure, activating the color-changing capsule and initiating reordering, or triggering a notification to the user to take protective action.
    *   **Vibration/Impact:**  Detects significant vibration/impact during transit/handling.  Activates a visual warning *and* logs the event, potentially triggering a quality control alert.
    *   **Pressure Sensing:**  Detects if a product is crushed or experiences excessive pressure.
*   **Data Communication:**
    *   **BLE to Mobile App:** Real-time data streaming to a user’s mobile app for monitoring environmental conditions, product status, and order history.
    *   **RFID to Central System:**  Periodic data uploads to a central inventory management system for aggregated data analysis and predictive reordering.
*   **Mobile App Features:**
    *   Environmental Condition Monitoring: Display of real-time temperature, humidity, light exposure, and vibration levels.
    *   Threshold Configuration: User-adjustable thresholds for triggering alerts and reorders.
    *   Order Management: Ability to view order history, track shipments, and manage subscription settings.
    *   Visual Indicator Interpretation:  Clear explanations of the color changes and other visual cues from the packaging.
*   **Inventory System Integration:**
    *   Predictive Reordering: Algorithm that analyzes historical data, environmental conditions, and user preferences to predict future demand and proactively replenish stock.
    *   Quality Control Alerts:  Automated alerts to manufacturers or distributors if excessive vibration or impact events are detected during transit.
    *   Supply Chain Optimization: Data-driven insights to optimize inventory levels and reduce waste.

**Pseudocode (Reordering Logic):**

```
function check_reorder_condition(sensor_data, user_preferences, historical_data):
  # Check if any environmental thresholds have been exceeded
  if (sensor_data.temperature > user_preferences.max_temperature) or \
     (sensor_data.humidity < user_preferences.min_humidity) or \
     (sensor_data.light_exposure > user_preferences.max_light_exposure):
    return True

  # Check if the item has been removed (RFID signal lost)
  if (RFID_signal_lost):
    return True

  # Check if a reorder is due based on historical usage
  if (time_since_last_order > historical_average_reorder_time):
    return True

  return False

function initiate_reorder(item_id, user_id):
  # Create a new order for the item
  new_order = create_order(item_id, user_id)

  # Send the order to the fulfillment center
  send_order_to_fulfillment_center(new_order)

  # Update the user's order history
  update_user_order_history(user_id, new_order)

  return new_order
