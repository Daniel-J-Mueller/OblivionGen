## Dynamic Contextual Banner Expansion - “Chameleon Banners”

**Concept:** Extend the banner functionality to dynamically expand *into* the content itself, reshaping the displayed text/media based on user gaze and inferred intent. Instead of a simple overlay, the banner actively integrates with the content, temporarily altering presentation for richer interaction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Gaze Tracking Integration:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrate with existing eye-tracking hardware (or utilize front-facing camera-based gaze estimation).
*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuously monitor user gaze position on the interface.
*   **Gaze Persistence:** Track gaze duration on specific text portions. A minimum gaze duration threshold (e.g., 200ms) triggers contextual banner activation.

**2. Content Reshaping & Banner Morphing:**

*   **Text Portion Isolation:** When gaze-triggered, isolate the text portion currently under focus.
*   **Dynamic Content Reflow:**  Temporarily reflow surrounding text to create visual “space” around the focused portion. This can include:
    *   Increasing font size of focused text.
    *   Decreasing font size or greying out surrounding text.
    *   Temporarily removing less relevant paragraphs or sections.
*   **Banner Morphing:** Instead of appearing as a static banner, the additional information “flows” *into* the newly created space.  
    *   Definitions, translations, or related links appear *within* the reflowed text.
    *   Images or videos associated with the text portion expand to fill available space.
*   **Animation:** Smooth animations govern both the text reflow and the banner morphing, minimizing disruption.

**3. Intent Inference & Adaptive Banners:**

*   **Interaction History:** Log user interactions with banners (e.g., selections, dismissals).
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Utilize device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) to understand device orientation and user activity.
*   **Adaptive Banner Content:**
    *   If the user frequently dismisses definition banners, prioritize alternative suggestions (e.g., related web pages).
    *   If the user is actively reading a long document, prioritize summarization or key takeaway banners.
    *   If the device is in motion, display simplified banners with minimal information.

**4. Pseudocode (Banner Activation & Morphing):**

```
Function ActivateBanner(text_portion, gaze_duration)
  If gaze_duration > MIN_GAZE_DURATION:
    IsolateTextPortion(text_portion)
    CalculateSurroundingText(text_portion)
    ReduceFontSize(SurroundingText)
    IncreaseFontSize(text_portion)
    CreateSpaceAround(text_portion)
    DetermineAdditionalInformation(text_portion)
    DisplayAdditionalInformation(text_portion)
  End If
End Function

Function DisplayAdditionalInformation(text_portion)
  If AdditionalInformationType == "Definition":
    DisplayDefinition(text_portion)
  Else If AdditionalInformationType == "AlternativeSpelling":
    DisplayAlternativeSpelling(text_portion)
  Else If AdditionalInformationType == "Link":
    DisplayLink(text_portion)
  Else:
    DisplayDefaultInformation(text_portion)
  End If
End Function
```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Eye-tracking hardware or robust front-facing camera with gaze estimation software.
*   High-resolution display for clear text rendering and animation.
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time gaze tracking, text reflow, and animation.

**6. Software Requirements:**

*   Gaze tracking SDK.
*   Text rendering engine with dynamic font size control.
*   Animation library.
*   Machine learning model for intent inference (optional).
