## Dynamic Environmental Scene Composition via Voice

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple device grouping to allow users to define and recall *entire environmental scenes* through voice commands. This leverages the existing voice control infrastructure to manipulate not just devices, but the *state* of a room or area, going beyond on/off or volume settings.

**Specs:**

*   **Scene Definition Module:**
    *   Input: Voice command + optional device/parameter confirmation.
    *   Process:
        1.  Speech recognition identifies command “Create Scene [Scene Name]”.
        2.  System enters “Scene Definition Mode”.
        3.  System prompts: “What devices or parameters would you like to include?”
        4.  User speaks device names, desired settings (“Lights to 30%, TV to channel 7, blinds open”).  System confirms each setting (“Lights set to 30% confirmed.”).  User can also issue relative commands ("Dim the lights a bit").
        5.  The system records the state of *all* controllable elements (devices, smart windows, HVAC settings etc.) as a “Scene Profile”.  It stores these as key-value pairs (e.g. “LivingRoomLights”: “30%”, “TelevisionChannel”: “7”, “Blinds”: “Open”).
        6.  User confirms completion: “Save Scene.”
        7.  Scene Profile is stored, associated with the Scene Name and potentially user profile/location.
*   **Scene Recall Module:**
    *   Input: Voice command “Activate Scene [Scene Name]”.
    *   Process:
        1.  Speech recognition identifies command.
        2.  System retrieves corresponding Scene Profile.
        3.  System broadcasts commands to all associated devices/systems to achieve specified settings.  Handles potential device unavailability gracefully (e.g. logs error, skips device).
*   **Dynamic Scene Adjustment:**
    *   Input: Voice Command “Adjust Scene [Scene Name] [Parameter] [Value]”.
    *   Process:
        1.  Speech recognition identifies command.
        2.  System retrieves Scene Profile.
        3.  System adjusts specified parameter within the Scene Profile.
        4.  Updates the active environment to reflect new parameter value.
*   **Contextual Scene Activation:**
    *   System monitors environment (motion sensors, time of day, user location).
    *   Automatically activates appropriate scenes based on defined rules (“If user enters living room after 6 PM, activate ‘Movie Night’ scene”).
*   **Scene Blending:**
    *   Enable users to blend scenes: "Transition to 'Reading' scene over 10 seconds." The system interpolates between the current and desired states.

**Pseudocode (Scene Recall):**

```
function RecallScene(sceneName) {
  sceneProfile = GetSceneProfile(sceneName);
  if (sceneProfile == null) {
    Log("Scene not found");
    return;
  }

  for (device in sceneProfile) {
    setting = sceneProfile[device];
    SendDeviceCommand(device, setting);
  }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing voice control hardware (smart speaker, microphone array).
*   Connectivity to all smart devices/systems within the environment.
*   Optional: Motion sensors, ambient light sensors for enhanced contextual awareness.
*   Sufficient memory/storage for Scene Profiles.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with streaming services to automatically select appropriate content based on the activated scene.
*   Machine learning to predict user preferences and automatically suggest scenes.
*   Support for user-created visual scene previews.
*   Advanced scene scheduling and automation.
