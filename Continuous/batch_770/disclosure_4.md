## Adaptive Prosody Modeling for Emotional Speech Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend duration modeling beyond phoneme-level analysis to incorporate prosodic features indicative of emotional state. Current systems primarily focus on *how long* a sound is, not *how it's delivered* emotionally. This aims to create more natural and expressive synthesized speech.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Annotation:**

1.  **Emotional Speech Corpus:** Collect a large corpus of speech samples representing a wide range of emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutrality, etc.). Recordings should be high-quality with minimal background noise.
2.  **Multi-Tier Annotation:**  Annotate each utterance with the following:
    *   **Phonetic Transcription:** Standard phonetic transcription using a consistent alphabet (e.g., IPA).
    *   **Emotional Category:**  Assign a primary emotional category to each utterance.  Consider a dimensional approach (valence, arousal) as well.
    *   **Prosodic Features:** Extract and annotate the following prosodic features at the syllable or mora level:
        *   **F0 (Fundamental Frequency):** Mean, standard deviation, range, slope.
        *   **Intensity:**  RMS amplitude, dynamic range.
        *   **Duration:** Syllable/mora duration.
        *   **Voice Quality:**  Spectral tilt, shimmer, jitter. (Measured via perceptual or acoustic analysis)
        *   **Pauses & Boundary Tones:** Location, duration, and acoustic properties of pauses.

**II. Model Architecture:**

1.  **Hierarchical Duration Model:**  A hierarchical model that predicts duration at multiple levels:
    *   **Base Duration:**  Predicts a baseline duration for each phoneme based on context (neighboring phonemes, phonetic features). This could be achieved with a standard HMM or DNN-based duration predictor.
    *   **Prosodic Modifier:** A separate model (DNN or RNN) that predicts modifications to the base duration *based on the prosodic features* (F0, intensity, duration, etc.) extracted from surrounding syllables.
    *   **Emotional Layer:** A final layer that scales the prosodic modifications based on the desired emotional state. This layer learns how different emotional states affect prosodic expression.
2.  **Feature Integration:**
    *   **Concatenated Features:** Combine phonetic features, prosodic features, and emotional embedding into a single feature vector.
    *   **Attention Mechanism:** Employ an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different features for duration prediction. This allows the model to focus on the most relevant cues for each phoneme.

**III. Training & Optimization:**

1.  **Loss Function:**  Use a combination of:
    *   **Duration Prediction Loss:**  Mean Squared Error (MSE) or similar for duration prediction.
    *   **Prosodic Feature Loss:**  MSE or similar for prosodic feature prediction.
    *   **Emotional Loss:**  Cross-entropy or similar for emotional category prediction.
2.  **Training Data:** Utilize the annotated emotional speech corpus. Augment the data by applying time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and adding noise.
3.  **Optimization Algorithm:** Use Adam or similar adaptive optimization algorithm.
4.  **Regularization Techniques:** Apply dropout, L1/L2 regularization, and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

**IV. Synthesis Procedure:**

1.  **Text Input:** Input the text to be synthesized.
2.  **Text Analysis:** Perform text analysis to generate phonetic transcription and prosodic cues.
3.  **Duration Prediction:** Predict the duration of each phoneme based on the hierarchical duration model and desired emotional state.
4.  **Acoustic Parameter Generation:** Generate acoustic parameters (F0, intensity, spectral envelope) based on the predicted duration and desired emotional state.
5.  **Waveform Synthesis:**  Use a vocoder (e.g., WORLD, STRAIGHT) or a neural vocoder to synthesize the waveform from the acoustic parameters.



**Pseudocode for Prosodic Modifier:**

```
function modify_duration(base_duration, prosodic_features, emotional_state):
  # Prosodic features: [F0, Intensity, Duration of previous syllable]
  # Emotional state: One-hot encoded vector representing emotion

  # Neural Network with multiple layers
  hidden_layer_1 = ReLU(W1 * prosodic_features + b1)
  hidden_layer_2 = ReLU(W2 * hidden_layer_1 + b2)
  duration_scale = sigmoid(W3 * hidden_layer_2 + b3)  # Scale factor 0-1

  # Apply emotional state to scale
  emotional_bias = emotional_state * emotional_bias_weights  # Each emotion has a bias
  duration_scale = duration_scale + emotional_bias

  modified_duration = base_duration * duration_scale
  return modified_duration
```
