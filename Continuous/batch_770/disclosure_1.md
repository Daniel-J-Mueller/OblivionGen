## Dynamic Swarm Mapping & Predictive Coverage

**Concept:** Leveraging AMV sensor data to create a real-time, dynamically updating 3D map of the event space, *predicting* coverage gaps before they occur, and proactively repositioning AMVs to maintain optimal service. This goes beyond simply reacting to low power or arriving relief – it anticipates needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Each AMV equipped with LiDAR, high-resolution cameras (RGB + thermal), and environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, atmospheric pressure).
*   **Data Fusion Module:** Onboard processor fuses sensor data into a coherent point cloud map. Data streamed to a central server (or distributed amongst AMVs in a mesh network) for larger event spaces.
*   **Coverage Modeling:** A predictive algorithm assesses coverage based on:
    *   AMV sensor ranges (lighting, audio, RF signal strength).
    *   Obstacle detection (buildings, trees, crowds).
    *   Event-specific data (stage locations, expected crowd density maps).
    *   Historical usage data (areas consistently requiring more coverage).
*   **Gap Prediction:** Algorithm identifies potential coverage gaps based on predicted movement of crowds/event elements and sensor limitations.
*   **Proactive Repositioning:** 
    *   AMV management system calculates optimal new positions for AMVs to fill gaps.
    *   Instructions sent to AMVs to autonomously navigate to new positions.
    *   Prioritization of repositioning based on severity of coverage gap & AMV power levels.
*   **Swarm Coordination:** Algorithm coordinates AMV movements to avoid collisions and maintain optimal swarm density. 
*   **Dynamic Map Visualization:** Centralized dashboard displaying 3D map with real-time coverage visualization (heatmaps, color-coded areas) and AMV positions. 

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// On each AMV:
loop:
    sensorData = acquireSensorData()
    mapUpdate = createMapUpdate(sensorData)
    transmit(mapUpdate)
    
// Central Server:
loop:
    mapUpdates = receiveMapUpdates()
    mergedMap = mergeMapUpdates(mapUpdates)
    coverageMap = generateCoverageMap(mergedMap, AMV_sensor_specs)
    gapPredictions = predictCoverageGaps(coverageMap, event_data)
    
    for each gap in gapPredictions:
        bestAMV = selectBestAMV(gap, AMVs, power_levels)
        newPosition = calculateNewPosition(gap, bestAMV)
        sendInstruction(bestAMV, newPosition)
```

**Innovation:** Traditional systems react to coverage loss. This system *predicts* loss and proactively moves AMVs to prevent it, maximizing service uptime and providing a seamless experience. The dynamic map isn’t just a visualization tool—it’s the core of the predictive engine. This moves beyond simple 'relief' planning to true preventative maintenance of coverage.
