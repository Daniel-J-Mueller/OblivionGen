## Dynamic Lasagna Plot Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Enhance prediction accuracy by dynamically adjusting the weighting of individual layers within the lasagna plot representation of multivariate time series data. This is achieved through a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to prioritize layers based on their predictive power for specific scenarios.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Preprocessing & Lasagna Plot Generation:**

*   Input: Multivariate time series data (as described in the patent).
*   Transformation: Each time series is converted into a layer of a lasagna plot, representing its temporal characteristics.
*   Normalization: Each layer is independently normalized to a range of 0-1.
*   Output: A multi-layer lasagna plot representation of the input data.

**2. Reinforcement Learning Agent:**

*   **State:** The RL agentâ€™s state consists of:
    *   The current lasagna plot (represented as a multi-dimensional array).
    *   A vector representing the prediction error from the previous time step (e.g., difference between predicted and actual machine failure).
    *   Metadata about the data source (sensor type, machine component).
*   **Action:** The agent can adjust the weight assigned to each layer of the lasagna plot.  Weights are constrained between 0 and 1.
*   **Reward:** The reward function is based on the improvement in prediction accuracy. Specifically:
    *   High reward for a correct prediction (e.g., accurate failure prediction).
    *   Negative reward for incorrect predictions.
    *   A small penalty for large weight adjustments (encourages stability).
*   **Algorithm:**  Utilize a Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.  The agent learns through trial and error, exploring different weight configurations and maximizing cumulative reward.

**3. Prediction Model:**

*   Input: Weighted lasagna plot (generated by applying layer weights from the RL agent).
*   Model: Employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process the weighted lasagna plot.
*   Output: Prediction (e.g., probability of machine failure within a time frame).

**4. System Architecture:**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (data_stream_active) {
  // 1. Receive multivariate time series data
  data = receive_data()

  // 2. Generate Lasagna Plot
  lasagna_plot = generate_lasagna_plot(data)

  // 3. RL Agent: Determine Layer Weights
  layer_weights = rl_agent.get_action(lasagna_plot, prediction_error, metadata)

  // 4. Apply Weights to Lasagna Plot
  weighted_lasagna_plot = apply_weights(lasagna_plot, layer_weights)

  // 5. Prediction using CNN
  prediction = cnn.predict(weighted_lasagna_plot)

  // 6. Calculate Prediction Error
  prediction_error = calculate_error(prediction, actual_outcome)

  // 7. Update RL Agent with Reward
  reward = calculate_reward(prediction_error)
  rl_agent.update(lasagna_plot, prediction_error, reward)

  // 8. Send Prediction
  send_prediction(prediction)
}
```

**5. Training Data:**

*   A large dataset of multivariate time series data with corresponding failure/outcome labels.
*   Data should include various operating conditions and failure modes.
*   Simulated data can be used to augment real-world data.

**6. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure (GPU acceleration recommended).
*   Deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Reinforcement learning libraries (e.g., Stable Baselines3).

**Novelty:**  This approach introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism for lasagna plot layers, guided by a reinforcement learning agent. Unlike static approaches, this allows the system to adapt to changing data patterns and improve prediction accuracy over time. It moves beyond treating all layers equally and learns to prioritize the most informative layers for specific scenarios, enhancing the predictive power of the lasagna plot representation.
