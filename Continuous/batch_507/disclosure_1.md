**Dynamic Offer ‘Health’ Scoring & Predictive Filtering**

**Core Concept:** Extend the feedback-driven rule generation to create a real-time ‘health’ score for each offer, factoring in not just negative feedback (as currently implied) but also positive signals, competitor pricing, and predicted buyer engagement. This score then drives *proactive* filtering and highlighting, rather than simply reacting to feedback.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Ingestion Layer:**
    *   Real-time ingestion of user feedback (text, ratings, purchase behavior).
    *   Web scraping/API integration with competitor pricing data.
    *   Historical sales data per offer (views, clicks, conversions).
    *   Item attribute data (category, condition, shipping cost).

2.  **Feature Extraction & Scoring Engine:**
    *   NLP analysis of feedback text: Sentiment analysis, entity recognition (price mentions, quality complaints, shipping issues).
    *   Competitor Price Ratio: `(Offer Price / Average Competitor Price)`. Lower is better.
    *   Conversion Rate: `(Purchases / Views)`. Higher is better.
    *   View-to-Click Ratio: `(Clicks / Views)`. Higher is better.
    *   Shipping Cost Penalty:  `Shipping Cost / Offer Price`. Lower is better.
    *   **Offer Health Score Calculation:**
        `Health Score = (Sentiment Score * 0.3) + (Price Ratio * 0.25) + (Conversion Rate * 0.25) + (View-to-Click Ratio * 0.1) – (Shipping Cost Penalty * 0.1)`
        *Scores normalized to a 0-100 scale. Weights adjustable based on category.*

3.  **Dynamic Filtering & Highlighting:**
    *   **Threshold-Based Filtering:** Offers falling below a user-defined or system-calculated Health Score threshold are automatically filtered from search results (optional, user controlled).
    *   **Health Score Visualization:**  Display a visual Health Score indicator (e.g., color-coded badge) alongside each offer in search results.
    *   **Personalized Filtering:**  Adjust filtering thresholds and weighting factors based on user purchase history and preferences.
    *   **“Rising Star”/“Declining Offer” Alerts:**  Identify offers with rapidly changing Health Scores, flagging them for review or proactive adjustment.

4.  **Predictive Modeling (Advanced):**
    *   Train a machine learning model to predict future Health Scores based on historical data and real-time signals.
    *   Proactively suggest price adjustments or attribute improvements to sellers to boost their Health Scores.
    *   Identify potentially problematic offers *before* negative feedback accumulates.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Modeling):**

```
function predict_health_score(offer_attributes, historical_data, real_time_signals):
    # Input: Offer attributes (price, shipping, condition), historical sales data, real-time signals (views, clicks)
    # Output: Predicted Health Score (0-100)

    features = extract_features(offer_attributes, historical_data, real_time_signals)

    # Load pre-trained machine learning model
    model = load_model("health_score_predictor.pkl")

    predicted_score = model.predict(features)

    return predicted_score
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Offer`: { `offer_id`, `price`, `shipping_cost`, `condition`, `seller_id`, `views`, `clicks`, `purchases`, `feedback_texts` }
*   `Feedback`: { `feedback_id`, `offer_id`, `user_id`, `text`, `rating` }
*   `HealthScore`: { `offer_id`, `timestamp`, `score`, `sentiment_score`, `price_ratio`, `conversion_rate` }
