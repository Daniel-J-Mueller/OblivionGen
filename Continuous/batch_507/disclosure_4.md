## Spectral Leakage Mapping & Predictive Failure Analysis

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** High-resolution multispectral imaging array (400nm - 1000nm, with extendable range via filter swaps). Minimum 12-bit depth per spectral band.
*   **Light Source:** Internal, calibrated broadband emitter (covering the imaging array’s range), with adjustable intensity and spectral distribution.  Multiple emitters preferred, each with narrow bandwidth control.
*   **Blocking Elements:** Set of precisely machined, spectrally selective blocking plates/apertures.  Each plate allows only a specific, narrow band of light to pass, while blocking all others. Plates designed for robotic placement.
*   **Robotic System:** 6-axis robotic arm with high-precision positioning (micron level) and force sensing. Integrated vision system for plate alignment.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance computing cluster with dedicated GPUs for image processing and machine learning.
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   Image Acquisition & Control Module
    *   Spectral Data Processing & Calibration Module
    *   Machine Learning Module (Failure Prediction)
    *   Visualization & Reporting Module

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Device Placement:** Device Under Test (DUT) positioned within a light-tight chamber.
2.  **Baseline Capture:** Multispectral image captured *without* any blocking elements. This establishes the ‘ideal’ light distribution from internal sources.
3.  **Spectral Sweep:**
    *   Robotic arm places a first, spectrally selective blocking element in front of the camera lens.
    *   Internal light source activated.
    *   Multispectral image captured. Any light detected *through* the blocking element indicates a leakage path.
    *   Blocking element replaced with the next in a pre-defined spectral sequence. This process is repeated until the entire spectrum is scanned.
4.  **Leakage Mapping:**  A “leakage map” is generated for each spectral band, showing the intensity and location of light leakage.
5.  **Failure Prediction (Machine Learning):**
    *   The system is trained on a dataset of DUTs with known failure modes.
    *   The leakage map is used as input to the machine learning model.
    *   The model predicts the probability of various failure modes based on the observed leakage patterns.
6.  **Reporting & Visualization:**  A report is generated summarizing the leakage map, predicted failure modes, and confidence levels. The data is visualized using heatmaps and 3D renderings.

**Pseudocode (Failure Prediction Module):**

```
function predict_failure(leakage_map, training_data):
  // leakage_map: 3D array (X, Y, Spectral Band) representing light leakage intensity
  // training_data: Dataset of DUTs with known failures and corresponding leakage maps

  // 1. Feature Extraction:
  features = extract_features(leakage_map)
  // features: Vector of metrics representing leakage patterns (e.g., total leakage,
  //           leakage in specific regions, spectral distribution of leakage)

  // 2. Model Training (if not already trained):
  if model is not trained:
      model = train_model(training_data)

  // 3. Prediction:
  predictions = model.predict(features)

  // 4. Return:
  return predictions // Probabilities for each failure mode
```

**Innovation Justification:**

Current light leakage tests typically focus on simple pass/fail criteria using broad-spectrum light. This system goes beyond that by:

*   **Spectral Resolution:** Identifying the specific wavelengths of light that are leaking, allowing for more precise diagnosis of the underlying failure mechanisms.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** Leveraging machine learning to predict potential failures *before* they occur, enabling proactive quality control.
*   **Automated Mapping:** The robotic system and spectral sweep capability create a detailed, automated map of light leakage, reducing manual inspection time and improving accuracy.
*   **Failure Mode Identification:** Correlating spectral leakage patterns with known failure modes allows for targeted repairs and improved product design.
