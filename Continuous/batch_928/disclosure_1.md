## Adaptive Permission Granularity Based on Contextual Risk

**Concept:** Expand upon the existing authorization system by introducing a contextual risk assessment that dynamically adjusts the granularity of permission requests. Instead of a binary "yes/no" for an action, the system assesses the *sensitivity* of the action within the current context and requests varying levels of authorization – from simple voice confirmation to multi-factor authentication.

**Specifications:**

*   **Contextual Data Inputs:**
    *   **Environmental Sensors:** Microphone (ambient noise, speech patterns indicating stress), Camera (facial expressions, object recognition – presence of sensitive items), Location (GPS, geofencing).
    *   **Device State:** Battery level (potential for interrupted authentication), Network connectivity (secure vs. public Wi-Fi), App context (what other apps are running).
    *   **Time of Day/Week:**  Adjusting sensitivity based on typical user behavior.
    *   **User History:** Patterns of action requests, successful/failed authentications.
*   **Risk Assessment Engine:**
    *   Utilizes a weighted scoring system. Each contextual data input contributes to a risk score.
    *   Predefined risk thresholds trigger different authorization levels (see below).
    *   Machine Learning component to dynamically adjust weights based on observed user behavior and successful/failed authentications.
*   **Authorization Levels:**
    *   **Level 1 (Low Risk):**  Voice Confirmation (existing system) – sufficient for routine, non-sensitive actions.
    *   **Level 2 (Medium Risk):**  Voice Confirmation + Secondary Factor (e.g., PIN, pattern, biometrics) - required for actions with moderate sensitivity (e.g., financial transactions under a certain amount, accessing personal data).
    *   **Level 3 (High Risk):**  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) –  strongest level, required for highly sensitive actions (e.g., large financial transactions, changing account settings, accessing critical data).  Could incorporate push notifications to a trusted device, security key, or dedicated authenticator app.
    *   **Level 0 (No Authorization):** Action Denied –  triggered by extreme risk (e.g., unauthorized location, suspicious activity detected).
*   **Dynamic Permission Prompts:**
    *   System presents authorization requests tailored to the assessed risk level.
    *   Prompts clearly explain *why* a particular level of authorization is required (e.g., “To complete this purchase, we need to verify your identity due to the amount.”).
*   **User Override:**
    *   Users can temporarily override the system’s risk assessment (with appropriate warnings) – for situations where the system is overly cautious.
    *   Override events are logged for review and system learning.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function assess_risk(context_data):
  risk_score = 0
  # Calculate risk score based on weighted contextual data inputs
  risk_score += context_data.location.risk_weight * context_data.location.risk_level
  risk_score += context_data.network.risk_weight * context_data.network.risk_level
  # ... and so on for other contextual inputs

  return risk_score

function determine_authorization_level(risk_score):
  if risk_score < threshold_low:
    return "Level 1"
  elif risk_score < threshold_medium:
    return "Level 2"
  elif risk_score < threshold_high:
    return "Level 3"
  else:
    return "Level 0"

function handle_action_request(action, user_id, context_data):
  risk_score = assess_risk(context_data)
  authorization_level = determine_authorization_level(risk_score)

  if authorization_level == "Level 0":
    deny_action()
    return

  if authorization_level == "Level 1":
    request_voice_confirmation(user_id)
    # ... process voice confirmation ...
    perform_action()

  elif authorization_level == "Level 2":
    request_secondary_factor_authentication(user_id)
    # ... process secondary factor authentication ...
    perform_action()

  elif authorization_level == "Level 3":
    request_multi_factor_authentication(user_id)
    # ... process multi-factor authentication ...
    perform_action()
```
