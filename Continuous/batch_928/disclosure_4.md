## Dynamic Projection Mapping with Biofeedback Integration

**System Overview:**

This system expands on the light uniformity testing by creating a dynamic projection system that adapts the projected image based on real-time biofeedback data from the user. The core concept is to use the light projection not just *as* an image, but *as* a responsive environment, creating an immersive experience that can be tailored to the user’s emotional and physiological state.

**Hardware Components:**

1.  **Enhanced Projection System:** Multi-projector array capable of high-resolution, edge-blended projection onto a curved or non-planar surface. Incorporates the light uniformity calibration system from the provided patent, but adds active control over individual LED brightness and color temperature.
2.  **Biofeedback Sensors:**  Array of non-invasive sensors to capture physiological data.  Includes:
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) headband: Measures brainwave activity.
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) wristband: Measures heart rate variability (HRV).
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor: Measures skin conductance (sweat).
    *   Facial Expression Analysis Camera: Captures micro-expressions.
3.  **Processing Unit:** High-performance computer with dedicated GPU for real-time data processing and rendering.
4.  **Ambient Environmental Sensors:** Microphones, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors to integrate external environmental data.
5. **Haptic Feedback System:** Localized haptic actuators synchronized with the visual projection.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Biofeedback Data Acquisition Module:**  Receives and preprocesses data from all biofeedback sensors.  Noise filtering, artifact removal, and feature extraction (e.g., alpha/theta wave ratios from EEG, HRV metrics, GSR peak detection).
2.  **Emotional State Estimation Module:** Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) to map biofeedback features to emotional states (e.g., relaxed, focused, anxious, excited).
3.  **Content Generation & Mapping Module:**  This is the core of the system.
    *   **Procedural Content Generation:** Generates dynamic visual content (textures, animations, patterns) based on the estimated emotional state. For example, relaxed state could generate slow-moving, calming nature scenes. Anxious state might trigger abstract, fragmented patterns.
    *   **Mapping Function:**  Defines the relationship between emotional state parameters and visual content properties. This function allows the user to calibrate the system to their preferences. (e.g. Higher GSR = increased intensity of visual elements).
    *   **Spatial Audio Integration:** Generates ambient soundscapes synchronized with the visuals, enhancing immersion.
4.  **Projection Control Module:** Controls the multi-projector array, dynamically adjusting brightness, color, and content based on the output of the Content Generation & Mapping Module.  Leverages the light uniformity calibration data to ensure consistent visual quality across the projection surface.
5.  **Haptic Synchronization Module:**  Triggers haptic feedback actuators in response to key visual events or emotional states, providing tactile reinforcement.

**Pseudocode (Content Generation & Mapping Module - simplified):**

```
function generateContent(emotionalState, calibrationData):
  if emotionalState == "relaxed":
    texture = "calming_nature_texture"
    animationSpeed = 0.2
    colorPalette = ["blue", "green", "white"]
  else if emotionalState == "focused":
    texture = "abstract_geometric_pattern"
    animationSpeed = 0.5
    colorPalette = ["purple", "gray"]
  else if emotionalState == "anxious":
    texture = "fragmented_shapes"
    animationSpeed = 1.0
    colorPalette = ["red", "black", "orange"]

  intensity = calibrationData.intensityScale * emotionalState.arousalLevel
  saturation = calibrationData.saturationScale * emotionalState.valenceLevel

  finalColor = adjustColor(texture, intensity, saturation)
  return finalColor, animationSpeed
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Therapeutic Environments:**  Create immersive environments for stress reduction, anxiety management, and pain relief.
*   **Enhanced Gaming/VR Experiences:**  Dynamically adjust the game environment based on the player’s emotional state.
*   **Adaptive Advertising:** Display advertising content tailored to the viewer’s emotional state.
*   **Personalized Learning Environments:** Create learning environments that adapt to the student’s emotional state and learning style.
