## Dynamic Workspace Mapping with Acoustic Beacons

**Concept:** Augment the active marker system with localized acoustic beacons to create a dynamically updated, high-resolution map of the workspace. This allows for obstacle avoidance, precise positioning, and collaborative task management beyond the limitations of the 2D active marker grid.

**Specifications:**

*   **Acoustic Beacon Network:** Deploy a network of small, low-power acoustic beacons throughout the workspace. Each beacon emits a unique, digitally encoded ultrasonic signal. Beacons will operate in a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheme to prevent signal collisions.
*   **Mobile Drive Unit Acoustic Sensor Suite:** Equip each mobile drive unit with a multi-element microphone array. This array performs Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) calculations to determine the distance and direction of each active acoustic beacon.
*   **Data Fusion Module (Onboard MDU):** Implement a Kalman Filter-based data fusion module on each MDU. This module integrates data from the active markers *and* the acoustic beacons to create a localized, real-time map of the workspace. The map will represent obstacles, available pathways, and the location of other MDUs and acoustic beacons.
*   **Beacon/MDU Communication Protocol:** Establish a bi-directional communication protocol between MDUs and beacons. This allows for:
    *   **Beacon Health Monitoring:** MDUs periodically ping beacons to verify operational status and signal strength.
    *   **Dynamic Map Updates:** MDUs can share localized map data with nearby beacons, improving the overall accuracy and completeness of the workspace map.
    *   **Collaborative Path Planning:** MDUs can negotiate paths and avoid collisions based on shared map data and predicted trajectories.
*   **Management Module Integration:** The management module receives aggregated map data from the beacons. This data is used to:
    *   **Optimize Task Allocation:** Assign tasks to MDUs based on their current location and the availability of pathways.
    *   **Dynamic Re-Routing:** Re-route MDUs in real-time to avoid obstacles or congested areas.
    *   **Workspace Optimization:** Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the workspace layout.
*   **Signal Processing Pipeline (Onboard MDU):**
    1.  **Raw Audio Capture:** Microphone array captures ambient audio.
    2.  **Beamforming:** Apply beamforming techniques to enhance signal detection and reduce noise.
    3.  **Feature Extraction:** Extract unique features from the beacon signals (frequency, phase, amplitude).
    4.  **Localization:** Use TDoA and AoA algorithms to estimate the position of each beacon.
    5.  **Mapping:** Create a local map of the workspace based on the estimated beacon positions.

**Pseudocode (MDU â€“ Localization & Mapping):**

```
function localizeBeacons():
    rawAudio = captureAudio()
    enhancedAudio = beamform(rawAudio)
    beaconSignals = detectBeaconSignals(enhancedAudio)

    for signal in beaconSignals:
        timeDifference = calculateTimeDifference(signal)
        angleOfArrival = calculateAngleOfArrival(signal)
        beaconPosition = calculatePosition(timeDifference, angleOfArrival)
        addBeaconToMap(beaconPosition)

function createWorkspaceMap():
    obstacleMap = initializeObstacleMap()
    for beacon in beaconList:
        // Raycast from beacon to other beacons/obstacles
        path = raycast(beacon)
        if path.obstacleDetected():
            updateObstacleMap(path)

    return obstacleMap
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased positional accuracy beyond the resolution of the 2D marker grid.
*   Real-time obstacle avoidance and dynamic re-routing capabilities.
*   Improved collaborative task management among multiple MDUs.
*   Enhanced workspace optimization and efficiency.
*   The ability to operate in environments with limited visibility or complex layouts.
