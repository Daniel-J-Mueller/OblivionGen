## Dynamic Haptic Shell

**Concept:** Extend the 3D input verification system to incorporate localized haptic feedback, creating a "dynamic haptic shell" around the displayed 3D object. This allows for interaction beyond visual tracking â€“ users physically *feel* the contours and expected input path as they perform the access gesture.

**Specifications:**

*   **Display:** High-resolution, multi-layered display capable of localized pressure/vibration. OLED or microLED preferred for rapid response and contrast. Layered structure includes transparent, flexible actuators.
*   **Actuator Grid:** Dense grid of micro-actuators (piezoelectric, microfluidic, or shape-memory alloy) integrated *beneath* the display surface. Resolution: minimum 100 actuators per square inch. Capable of generating localized pressure/vibration ranging from subtle texture to firm resistance.
*   **Input Tracking:** Fusion of existing tracking technologies (touch, accelerometer, gyroscope, camera/gaze tracking). Enhanced with precise finger/hand tracking (e.g., using structured light or time-of-flight sensors) for accurate rendering of tactile feedback.
*   **Access Pattern Mapping:** The stored access pattern is not just a visual/motion profile, but a *haptic profile*. This profile defines the expected force/texture feedback at each point along the input path.
*   **Dynamic Resistance:** As the user interacts with the display, the actuator grid dynamically adjusts resistance based on the expected input path. Incorrect deviation from the path results in increased resistance or altered texture, guiding the user.
*   **Haptic Layering:** Multiple haptic layers allowing for complex textures and shape definition. This allows for the simulation of edges, curves and other tactile features.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   `HapticPatternGenerator(AccessPattern)`: Generates a haptic feedback map based on a visual access pattern.  This converts the visual path into a force/texture profile. Output is a 2D array defining actuator activation levels.
    *   `InputDeviationAnalyzer(UserInput, ExpectedPath)`: Calculates the deviation of the user's input from the expected access path. Returns a deviation score and a set of correction vectors.
    *   `HapticFeedbackController(DeviationScore, CorrectionVectors, ActuatorGrid)`: Adjusts the actuator grid activation levels based on the deviation score and correction vectors. Increases resistance/texture variation for incorrect deviations. Implements smoothing filters to prevent jarring transitions.
    *   `AccessVerification(HapticMatch, MotionMatch)`: Combines haptic and motion verification. Access is granted only if both match the stored pattern within a defined tolerance.

    ```pseudocode
    //Main loop within application
    while(device_active){
        UserInput = GetUserInput();
        ExpectedPath = GetExpectedPath();
        DeviationScore = InputDeviationAnalyzer(UserInput, ExpectedPath);
        CorrectionVectors = GenerateCorrectionVectors(DeviationScore);
        ActuatorGrid = HapticFeedbackController(DeviationScore, CorrectionVectors, ActuatorGrid);
        HapticMatch = VerifyHapticMatch(ActuatorGrid);
        MotionMatch = VerifyMotionMatch(UserInput);
        if (HapticMatch AND MotionMatch){
            GrantAccess();
        } else {
            DenyAccess();
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Materials:** Transparent, flexible polymers and conductive materials for actuators. Durable, scratch-resistant coating for display surface.
*   **Calibration:** Automated calibration routine to map actuator grid to display surface and account for individual variations.

**Refinement notes:** Exploration of using localized heating/cooling for further tactile effects. Integration with AI to dynamically adjust haptic feedback based on user behavior and learning.
