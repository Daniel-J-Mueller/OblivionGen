## Dynamic Content Segmentation & Predictive Pre-Fetching

**Concept:** Extend the page-level usage data collection to not just *track* how users interact with content, but to *dynamically segment* content based on observed interaction patterns, and proactively pre-fetch segments predicted to be of high interest. This moves beyond simply measuring usage to actively influencing the user experience and optimizing bandwidth.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Segmentation Module:**
    *   Input: Raw content (e.g., HTML, text, images, video).
    *   Process: Divides content into granular, dynamically sized segments. Initial segmentation could be based on visual structure (sections, paragraphs, images, videos), but evolves with data.
    *   Output: List of content segments, each with a unique ID, size, and initial predicted interest score (based on initial visual properties like heading size, image resolution, etc.).
*   **Interaction Monitoring (Enhanced):**
    *   Capture not just *that* a segment was viewed, but *how* it was viewed:
        *   Scroll depth within the segment.
        *   Time spent actively viewing (detect eye-tracking if available, or approximate via mouse movement/scroll activity).
        *   Interaction events (clicks, hovers, form submissions within the segment).
        *   Device type and network conditions.
*   **Predictive Modeling Module:**
    *   Input: Historical interaction data (from all users) for each segment, current user profile (if available – e.g., browsing history, demographics), current content context.
    *   Process: Train machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, attention mechanisms) to predict the probability that a user will interact with each segment.
    *   Output: Ranked list of segments, with predicted interaction probabilities.
*   **Pre-Fetching Engine:**
    *   Input: Ranked list of segments from the Predictive Modeling Module.
    *   Process: Proactively fetch the top N ranked segments *before* the user scrolls to them.  Employ adaptive pre-fetching – adjust N based on network conditions, user device, and pre-fetching success rate. Prioritize segments predicted to be of very high interest, or those that are large (to minimize perceived latency).
    *   Output: Pre-fetched content segments stored in a local cache.
*   **Dynamic Content Assembly:**
    *   Input: User scroll position, pre-fetched content segments.
    *   Process: Assemble the page dynamically as the user scrolls, seamlessly incorporating pre-fetched segments.
    *   Output: Rendered page content.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Page Load:
segments = SegmentContent(pageHTML)
For each segment in segments:
    segment.interestScore = InitialInterestScore(segment)

// While User Browses:
OnScroll(scrollPosition):
    visibleSegments = GetVisibleSegments(scrollPosition, segments)
    For each visible segment:
        TrackInteraction(segment, interactionData) //Capture user interactions
        UpdateInterestScore(segment, interactionData)

    predictedSegments = PredictNextSegments(segments, userProfile)
    PrefetchSegments(predictedSegments)

//Background Process
UpdateModel(segments, interactionData) //Continously train model

```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Segment:** {id, content, size, interestScore, interactionHistory}
*   **UserProfile:** {browsingHistory, demographics, deviceType, networkConditions}
*   **InteractionData:** {segmentId, scrollDepth, timeSpent, interactionEvents}



This system aims to go beyond passive analysis and actively create a more responsive and personalized user experience, reducing perceived latency and increasing engagement.
