## Dynamic Persona-Based Recommendation Filtering

**Specification:** Implement a system to dynamically generate and apply user personas *during* recommendation generation, beyond static user profiles. These personas are synthesized from real-time behavioral signals and short-term contextual data, influencing the recommendation weighting and filtering process.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Real-Time Signal Ingestion:** Collect data streams including:
    *   Current browsing activity (URLs, time spent on pages, interactions).
    *   Geolocation (coarse-grained – city level).
    *   Time of day/day of week.
    *   Device type.
    *   Recent search queries (if available).
    *   Social media activity (with user permission – limited data – trending topics).
2.  **Persona Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., a transformer-based architecture) trained to map ingested signals to predefined persona archetypes. Archetypes could include: “Value Shopper,” “Impulse Buyer,” “Trend Follower,” “Research-Driven,” “Gift Giver,” “Homebody,” “Travel Enthusiast”.
    *   Assigns probabilities to multiple personas – a user isn't locked into a single archetype. The model outputs a weighted distribution of persona activations.
    *   Continuous recalibration – persona weights are updated every few seconds based on incoming signals.
3.  **Recommendation Weighting & Filtering Module:**
    *   Integrates with the existing recommendation engine.
    *   Each item in the candidate recommendation list is scored *multiple times*, once for each activated persona. The scoring function is adjusted based on the persona (e.g., “Value Shopper” emphasizes price, “Trend Follower” emphasizes popularity).
    *   Final item score is a weighted average of persona-specific scores, reflecting the current persona activation distribution.
    *   Implement a "persona-based stoplist" - items strongly negatively correlated with an activated persona are suppressed.
4.  **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   Data anonymization/pseudonymization.
    *   Transparent user controls for data usage.
    *   Option for users to "opt-out" of persona-based recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Weighting):**

```
function generateRecommendations(userId, candidateItems):
    // Get current persona distribution
    personaDistribution = getPersonaDistribution(userId)

    weightedScores = []
    for item in candidateItems:
        itemScore = 0
        for persona, weight in personaDistribution:
            personaScore = calculatePersonaScore(item, persona) // Function to score item based on persona
            itemScore += personaScore * weight
        weightedScores.append((item, itemScore))

    // Sort by score and return top N items
    return sortAndLimit(weightedScores, N)
```

**Novelty:**  Existing recommendation systems primarily rely on static user profiles and historical data. This design introduces a *dynamic*, context-aware layer that adapts recommendations in real-time based on inferred user states. The probabilistic persona representation allows for nuanced personalization beyond simple demographic or behavioral segmentation. This could reveal previously unknown user preferences and improve recommendation accuracy and engagement.
