## Dynamic Intent Prioritization via Neuromorphic Hardware

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of identifying user intent, but introduces dynamic prioritization based on real-time physiological signals. It moves beyond simple keyword spotting and contextual analysis to incorporate a user’s subconscious state, potentially leading to more accurate and efficient interactions.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Neuromorphic Processing Unit (NPU):** A spiking neural network-based processor. Specifically, a system similar to Intel’s Loihi or BrainScaleS. This is *critical*.
*   **Non-Invasive Physiological Sensor Suite:**
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) – To capture brainwave activity.
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) – Measures skin conductance, indicative of emotional arousal.
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) – Measures heart rate variability (HRV), reflecting autonomic nervous system activity.
*   **Standard Speech Recognition Platform:** (as described in the reference patent – provides the base ASR and initial intent identification).
*   **Edge Computing Device:** A device capable of running the NPU and processing sensor data in real-time.

**Software/Algorithm Components:**

1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**  Raw sensor data is collected, filtered, and preprocessed (noise reduction, artifact removal).
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Relevant features are extracted from preprocessed sensor data. Examples:
    *   EEG: Alpha, Beta, Theta band power.
    *   GSR: Event-related skin conductance responses.
    *   PPG: HRV metrics (RMSSD, SDNN).
3.  **Neuromorphic Model Training:** An unsupervised spiking neural network (SNN) is trained on sensor data correlated with confirmed user actions/intents. This builds an internal model of the user's physiological ‘signatures’ associated with different potential intents.  The model doesn’t *predict* intent, it associates sensor patterns with previously identified intents.
4.  **Dynamic Intent Scoring:**
    *   The ASR platform identifies *multiple* potential intents (as in the source patent).
    *   Real-time sensor data is fed into the trained SNN.
    *   The SNN outputs activation patterns reflecting similarity to known physiological signatures.
    *   Each potential intent receives a 'physiological score' based on the strength of activation in the SNN corresponding to its associated signature.
    *   The initial intent ranking (from the ASR) is *weighted* by the physiological score.  Higher physiological scores boost the ranking of corresponding intents.
5.  **Intent Selection & Action:** The final intent with the highest weighted score is selected, and the corresponding action is performed.

**Pseudocode (Intent Scoring):**

```
// Inputs:
//  intentList: Array of potential intents (strings).  Each intent has an initial score.
//  sensorData: Array of real-time sensor readings.
//  trainedSNN: The trained Spiking Neural Network.

function calculateWeightedIntentScores(intentList, sensorData, trainedSNN) {

  activationPatterns = trainedSNN.process(sensorData) // Run sensor data through the SNN

  weightedScores = {}

  for each intent in intentList {
    // Get the SNN activation pattern associated with this intent
    intentActivation = getActivationForIntent(intent, activationPatterns)

    // Calculate a physiological score based on the activation strength
    physiologicalScore = calculateScore(intentActivation) // Score can be based on magnitude, etc.

    // Calculate the weighted score
    weightedScore = intent.initialScore * (1 + physiologicalScore) //Boost initial score

    weightedScores[intent] = weightedScore
  }

  // Return the intent with the highest weighted score
  bestIntent = findIntentWithHighestScore(weightedScores)
  return bestIntent
}
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

This approach moves beyond purely linguistic intent recognition. By incorporating physiological signals, it can potentially:

*   **Improve Accuracy:** Correctly identify intents even with ambiguous speech.
*   **Reduce Latency:**  Quickly narrow down possibilities by leveraging subconscious signals.
*   **Personalize Experience:** Adapt to a user's current state of mind.
*   **Enable Proactive Assistance:** Anticipate user needs based on physiological patterns.
