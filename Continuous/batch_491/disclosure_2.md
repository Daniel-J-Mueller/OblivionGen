## Virtual Network Topology Mirroring & Dynamic Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the virtual networking capabilities by allowing real-time mirroring of network topologies *between* virtual networks, coupled with dynamic resource allocation based on mirrored traffic patterns. This enables proactive scaling and fault tolerance, as well as advanced analytics based on cross-network behavioral analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Topology Mirroring Agent (TMA):**

*   **Location:** Implemented as a module within the Communication Manager on each physical host.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Monitors network traffic within a designated virtual network.
    *   Creates a dynamic, abstracted representation of the network topology (nodes, links, protocols, traffic flows).
    *   Transmits this topology data to a central Topology Database.
    *   Receives topology data from other TMAs.
    *   Supports selective mirroring – allowing the administrator to define which networks/subnets are mirrored to others.

**2. Topology Database (TDB):**

*   **Location:** Centralized, managed by a system manager.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Stores topology data received from all TMAs.
    *   Maintains a historical record of topology changes.
    *   Provides an API for querying topology information.
    *   Supports topology comparison and difference analysis.
    *   Enables “what-if” scenarios – simulating the impact of topology changes.

**3. Dynamic Resource Allocator (DRA):**

*   **Location:** Integrated with the system manager and hypervisor.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Analyzes mirrored topology data and traffic patterns.
    *   Predicts resource requirements (CPU, memory, bandwidth) based on anticipated traffic load.
    *   Automatically allocates resources to virtual machines as needed, proactively scaling the network.
    *   Prioritizes resource allocation based on application criticality.
    *   Supports dynamic load balancing across physical hosts.
    *   Implements automated failover mechanisms in case of host failure.

**4. Communication Protocol Extensions:**

*   **Topology Advertisement:** A new protocol for TMAs to advertise their network topologies to the TDB.  This should be a lightweight, UDP-based protocol.
*   **Resource Request/Allocation:** Extensions to existing APIs to allow the DRA to request and allocate resources dynamically.

**Pseudocode – DRA Resource Allocation Logic:**

```
function allocateResources(virtualNetworkTopology, predictedTraffic) {
  requiredResources = calculateRequiredResources(virtualNetworkTopology, predictedTraffic)
  availableResources = getAvailableResources()

  if (availableResources < requiredResources) {
    // Request additional resources from cloud provider or other sources.
    requestAdditionalResources(requiredResources - availableResources)

    // If resource requests are still pending, implement temporary traffic shaping or prioritization.
    applyTrafficShaping()
  }

  // Allocate resources to virtual machines based on predicted traffic load.
  allocateResourcesToVMs(requiredResources)
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Topology Advertisement protocol should be secure to prevent unauthorized access to network topology information.
*   The DRA should be able to handle a large number of virtual networks and virtual machines.
*   The system should be designed for high availability and scalability.
*   Consider integrating machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction and resource allocation.
*   The mirroring agent could operate at Layer 7 allowing for analysis of application level traffic.
