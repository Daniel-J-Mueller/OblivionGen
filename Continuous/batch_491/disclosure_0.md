**Dynamic Preference Evolution via Multi-User Temporal Graphing**

**Core Concept:** Extend pairwise comparisons beyond static 'item A vs. item B' relationships to a dynamic, evolving graph representing user preference shifts *over time*.  Instead of simply showing "users who view both A & B prefer B 60% of the time", predict *how* that preference is changing – is it trending upwards, downwards, or stabilizing? And *why* – what other items are influencing the shift?

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Maintain detailed user event sequences (views, purchases, adds to cart, wishlists, dwell time on pages).  Timestamp *every* event.
    *   Capture item metadata (category, price, description, image features).
    *   Record user demographic data (optional, anonymized) – age range, location.

2.  **Temporal Graph Construction:**
    *   Create a directed graph.  Nodes represent items.  Edges represent preference relationships.
    *   Edge weight: represents the strength of preference (calculated from user event data).  Initial weight is based on the pairwise comparison data outlined in the provided patent.
    *   Temporal Component:  Each edge has a time series associated with it, tracking changes in its weight over defined time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
    *   “Influence” Edges: Add secondary, weaker edges between items that frequently appear together in user sessions but don’t represent *direct* preference (e.g., “users who view X also often view Y”).  These model associative relationships.

3.  **Preference Evolution Modeling:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM recurrent neural network) to predict future edge weights.  Input features: historical edge weight, influence edge weights, item metadata, seasonality (e.g., holidays), external factors (e.g., trending news).
    *   Calculate a “Preference Velocity” for each edge – the rate of change in its weight.
    *   Detect “Preference Pivots” – significant changes in preference velocity indicating a potential shift in user preference.

4.  **Personalized Recommendation Interface:**
    *   When a user views an item (e.g., Item A):
        *   Retrieve the top N items with the strongest positive preference velocity towards the user (calculated from the user's historical data and the overall preference graph).
        *   Display these as “Trending Alternatives” or “You Might Also Like (Growing Popularity)”.
        *   For pairwise comparisons, display not just the current percentage, but also the “Preference Velocity” (e.g., "Users are increasingly preferring Item B over Item A – preference up 15% this week").
        *   Show a “Preference Evolution Chart” for key item pairs, visualizing the historical preference shift.

5.  **“Anticipatory Bundling”:**
    *   Identify item combinations where preference is *predicted* to increase significantly in the near future.
    *   Proactively offer these as “Complete the Look” or “Frequently Bundled Together (Predicted)” – even before they become popular.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```
function recommend_alternatives(user_id, item_id):
  graph = load_preference_graph()
  user_history = load_user_history(user_id)
  
  //Filter Graph
  relevant_items = filter_graph_by_user_history(graph,user_history,item_id)
  
  //Score Items
  scored_items = score_items_by_preference_velocity(relevant_items)
  
  //Get top N
  top_n_items = get_top_n(scored_items, 5)
  
  return top_n_items
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server infrastructure for graph database and machine learning models.
*   Scalable graph database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).
*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Real-time data ingestion pipeline (e.g., Kafka, Apache Flink).
