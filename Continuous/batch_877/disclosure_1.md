## Dynamic Bloom Counter Federation for Network Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the Bloom counter approach beyond simple scan detection to create a federated, dynamically weighted system for broader network behavioral analysis and anomaly detection. Instead of a single Bloom filter (or set of filters) tracking all targets, create a system where multiple Bloom counters – each focused on a specific behavioral *category* – operate in parallel.  These counters aren't static; their weighting/influence changes based on observed network traffic patterns.

**Specification:**

**1. Behavioral Categories & Bloom Counter Initialization:**

*   Define a set of core behavioral categories (e.g., "External DNS Requests", "Internal Server Access", "Large Data Transfers”, “New Protocol Usage”). This isn’t exhaustive and is adaptable.
*   Initialize a Bloom counter for *each* behavioral category. Each Bloom counter has a configurable capacity (size) and false positive rate.  Initial weighting for all counters is equal (1.0).
*   Configuration file dictates initial categories and associated parameters.

**2. Packet Processing & Categorization:**

*   For each packet received, analyze its characteristics (destination/source IP/port, protocol, packet size, flags, etc.).
*   Assign the packet to *one or more* behavioral categories based on predefined rules (e.g., DNS packets go to "External DNS Requests," SSH packets to "Internal Server Access”).  Packets can belong to multiple categories.
*   Update the corresponding Bloom counters for *each* category the packet belongs to.  Standard Bloom counter insertion logic applies.

**3. Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**

*   Implement a weighting algorithm that adjusts the influence of each Bloom counter over time.  This is the core innovation.
*   **Weight Calculation:**  Every ‘N’ seconds (configurable), calculate the weighting for each counter as follows:
    *   `CounterActivity = Number of elements added to counter in the last 'N' seconds`
    *   `TotalActivity = Sum of CounterActivity across all counters`
    *   `CounterWeight = CounterActivity / TotalActivity`  (Normalization)
*   **Smoothing:** Apply a smoothing factor (alpha, between 0 and 1) to prevent rapid weight fluctuations.
    *   `NewWeight = (alpha * CurrentWeight) + ((1 - alpha) * NewWeight)`
*   **Exception Handling:** If a counter becomes inactive for a prolonged period, its weight slowly decays to a minimum value to avoid stale data influencing analysis.

**4. Anomaly Detection:**

*   Combine the outputs of all Bloom counters to assess anomaly scores.
*   **Anomaly Score Calculation:**
    *   For a given target, determine the Bloom counters it appears in.
    *   For each counter, determine the counter’s *current weight*.
    *   Calculate an *aggregate anomaly score* as the *sum of the weights of the counters the target appears in*. (Higher score = more anomalous).
*   Configure a threshold for the anomaly score. Targets exceeding the threshold are flagged as potentially anomalous.

**5. Scalability & Federation:**

*   Design the system to be distributed. Each edge device (as in the original patent) operates independently, maintaining its own set of Bloom counters and weights.
*   Implement a central aggregation point (or distributed consensus mechanism) to collect anomaly scores from multiple edge devices. This allows for broader network-wide anomaly detection and correlation.  This component is responsible for generating alerts and reports.

**Pseudocode (Weight Update):**

```
// Every N seconds:
FOR EACH BloomCounter IN BloomCounterArray:
    CounterActivity = CalculateElementsAddedInLastNSeconds(BloomCounter)
    TotalActivity = Sum(CalculateElementsAddedInLastNSeconds(Counter) FOR EACH Counter IN BloomCounterArray)
    NewWeight = (alpha * CurrentWeight(BloomCounter)) + ((1 - alpha) * (CounterActivity / TotalActivity))
    CurrentWeight(BloomCounter) = NewWeight
```

**Innovation Highlights:**

*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Adapts to changing network behavior, providing more accurate anomaly detection than static Bloom counter systems.
*   **Behavioral Categorization:** Enables granular analysis and targeted anomaly detection.
*   **Scalability:**  Designed for distributed deployment, allowing for network-wide visibility.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns and adjusts to network patterns.
