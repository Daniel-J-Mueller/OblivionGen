## Personalized Procurement ‘Mood Boards’

**Concept:** Expand the wish list functionality beyond simple item listing. Create dynamic, visually-driven “Mood Boards” representing a user’s aesthetic preferences and procurement tendencies. These boards would inform automated gift suggestions and pre-select procurement options – going beyond the single pre-selected option described in the patent.

**Specs:**

*   **Board Creation:**
    *   User interface allowing drag-and-drop of items from wish lists, online browsing (integrated with major retailers), and uploaded images.
    *   Categorization tags (style, occasion, price range, color palette) automatically applied via image recognition and item metadata. Manual overrides permitted.
    *   Board privacy settings (public, friends-only, private). Public boards become discoverable “style guides” for other users.

*   **Procurement Option Layering:**
    *   Beyond a *single* pre-selected option, each item on the mood board possesses a weighted scoring system for various procurement avenues. 
    *   Scoring factors: cost, delivery speed, sustainability rating of vendor, user-defined preference (e.g., “always buy from local businesses”), vendor loyalty programs.
    *   Automatic A/B testing of different procurement options for similar items on multiple users’ boards to optimize for cost/benefit.

*   **Automated Gift Suggestion Engine:**
    *   Algorithm analyzes mood board elements (visual style, dominant colors, item categories, weighted procurement preferences).
    *   Presents gift suggestions with confidence scores based on board analysis.
    *   "Surprise Me" feature: algorithm selects a gift based on board analysis *and* randomly introduces an item from a complementary category (e.g., if the board is heavily clothing-focused, suggest a relevant accessory).

*   **Dynamic Procurement Adjustments:**
    *   Real-time monitoring of procurement option viability (e.g., vendor out of stock, shipping delays).
    *   Automatic re-weighting of remaining options based on availability and user preferences.
    *   Proactive notification to user if preferred procurement option is no longer feasible, presenting alternative options.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateGiftSuggestions(userMoodBoard) {
  itemCategories = ExtractItemCategories(userMoodBoard);
  stylePreferences = ExtractStylePreferences(userMoodBoard);
  procurementWeights = GetProcurementWeights(userMoodBoard);

  candidateGifts = QueryRetailers(itemCategories, stylePreferences);

  scoredGifts = [];
  FOR EACH gift IN candidateGifts {
    score = CalculateGiftScore(gift, procurementWeights);
    scoredGifts.push({gift: gift, score: score});
  }

  sortedGifts = Sort(scoredGifts, score);

  RETURN sortedGifts;
}

FUNCTION CalculateGiftScore(gift, procurementWeights) {
  costScore = CalculateScore(gift.price, procurementWeights.cost);
  deliveryScore = CalculateScore(gift.deliveryTime, procurementWeights.delivery);
  sustainabilityScore = CalculateScore(gift.sustainabilityRating, procurementWeights.sustainability);
  
  totalScore = (costScore * 0.4) + (deliveryScore * 0.3) + (sustainabilityScore * 0.3);
  
  RETURN totalScore;
}
