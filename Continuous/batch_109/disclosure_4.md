## Dynamic Mesh Role Assignment & Predictive Handover

**Concept:** Extend the mesh network’s self-healing capabilities by dynamically assigning roles (provisioner, relay, end-node) based on real-time network conditions *and* predicting future network load/topology changes. This goes beyond static assignment or reactive adjustments; it anticipates needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Profiling:** Each node continuously monitors:
    *   Signal Strength (RSSI) to neighbors.
    *   Hop count to the gateway/server.
    *   Current data throughput.
    *   Battery Level/Power Availability.
    *   Processing Load.
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** A central server (or distributed amongst high-capacity nodes) runs a prediction algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, LSTM neural network) that forecasts:
    *   Node mobility patterns (if applicable).
    *   Expected data traffic volume per node/region.
    *   Potential network disruptions (e.g., predicted signal interference, node failures based on battery drain).
*   **Role Assignment Engine:** This engine utilizes:
    *   Node Profiles.
    *   Predictive Algorithm outputs.
    *   Predefined ‘Cost Functions’ (e.g., minimize latency, maximize throughput, balance load, extend network lifetime).
    *   To dynamically assign roles.  A node might transition from relay to provisioner based on anticipated load shifts.
*   **Handover Protocol:** A seamless handover protocol that allows nodes to switch roles *without* interrupting data streams. This is crucial for maintaining connectivity during dynamic role assignments. This utilizes pre-established peering relationships and pre-negotiated key exchange protocols.
*   **Topology Mapping:** Nodes broadcast periodic ‘heartbeats’ containing their role, signal strength to neighbors, and estimated load. This allows the network to build a dynamic topology map.
*   **Centralized/Distributed Architecture:** The system can operate in either a centralized (server manages role assignments) or distributed (nodes negotiate role assignments based on local information) mode.  Hybrid modes are also possible.

**Pseudocode (Distributed Mode – Node Role Negotiation):**

```
// Each Node

loop:
  collect_metrics() // Signal strength, throughput, battery, load
  broadcast_metrics()

  receive_neighbor_metrics()

  calculate_cost(neighbor_metrics, own_metrics) // Based on predefined cost function

  if (cost < threshold) {
    // Initiate role swap negotiation
    send_role_swap_request(neighbor_id, proposed_role)

    if (neighbor_accepts_swap()) {
      update_role(new_role)
      neighbor_update_role(new_role)
    }
  }

endloop
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires nodes with sufficient processing power to run the predictive algorithm (even simplified versions).
*   Software must be modular to accommodate different predictive algorithms and cost functions.
*   Secure communication protocols are crucial for negotiating role swaps.
*   Potential for edge computing – offloading predictive analysis to high-capacity nodes.
