## Dynamic Content Weaving for Ambient Displays

**Concept:** Extend the system beyond simple image/video display (screensavers/wallpaper) by integrating real-time data streams and interactive elements *within* the displayed content. Think of it as ‘weaving’ dynamic information into the fabric of the visuals, rather than layering it on top.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input Modules:**
    *   Weather API Integration: Real-time weather data (temperature, precipitation, wind speed) affects visual elements – e.g., a beach scene gains wave height proportional to wind speed, or a forest scene displays rain effects.
    *   Calendar/Scheduling Integration: Upcoming appointments/events appear subtly integrated into the visual scene. A meeting about a project might subtly introduce visual cues related to that project into the background.
    *   News/Social Media Feeds (Optional): Low-priority news headlines or social media updates could be integrated as text elements *within* the scene’s environment – e.g., a scrolling marquee on a virtual building, or a news ticker at the bottom of a landscape. Prioritize user control over this – it should be opt-in and heavily filtered.
    *   Biometric Data (Optional, Requires Explicit User Consent): Heart rate, stress levels (from wearables) influence the scene’s mood/color palette. Calm state = serene colors, high stress = more intense/dynamic visuals.
*   **Content Generation Engine:**
    *   Procedural Scene Creation:  Rather than static images/videos, the system generates scenes procedurally based on pre-defined "themes" (e.g., forest, beach, city, abstract).
    *   Dynamic Element Placement: The engine intelligently places dynamic elements within the scene, ensuring they don't obstruct key visual areas and maintain aesthetic balance.
    *   Rule-Based System:  Defines rules for how different data streams affect visual elements. Example: “If temperature > 80F, increase saturation of sun in scene.”
*   **Display Rendering:**
    *   Ambient Lighting Integration: The system adjusts the color temperature and brightness of the display to match the ambient lighting conditions in the room, enhancing the immersive experience.
    *   Low Power Mode: Optimized rendering techniques to minimize power consumption, especially important for always-on ambient displays.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Theme Selection: Users can choose from a library of pre-defined themes or create their own custom themes.
    *   Data Source Configuration: Users can connect their preferred data sources (weather API, calendar, etc.).
    *   Rule Editor: Advanced users can customize the rules that govern how data streams affect visual elements.
    *   Privacy Controls: Granular controls over which data sources are used and how the data is displayed.

**Pseudocode (Data Integration Example):**

```
function updateScene(weatherData, calendarEvents) {
  // Weather Integration
  if (weatherData.temperature > 30C) {
    scene.sun.intensity = 1.2;
    scene.sky.color = "bright blue";
  } else {
    scene.sun.intensity = 0.8;
    scene.sky.color = "pale blue";
  }

  if (weatherData.precipitation > 0.5) {
    activateRainEffect(intensity = weatherData.precipitation * 2);
  }

  // Calendar Integration
  for (event in calendarEvents) {
    if (event.title.includes("Project Phoenix")) {
      // Subtly introduce Phoenix-related imagery into the scene (e.g., a stylized logo on a building)
      displayProjectPhoenixLogo(location = "building rooftop");
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond merely displaying information *on* a screen. It integrates data *into* the visual experience, creating a dynamic, responsive ambient display that adapts to the user’s environment and schedule. The procedural generation and rule-based system allows for infinite customization and unique experiences.
