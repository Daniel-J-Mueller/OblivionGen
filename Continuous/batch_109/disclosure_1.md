## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping for Media

**Core Concept:** Extend the frame selection process beyond facial expressions and visual rules of composition to incorporate *real-time* emotional resonance mapping derived from both visual and auditory data within the media. This will create web pages designed to evoke specific emotional responses in the viewer, increasing engagement and potential for purchase.

**Specs:**

*   **Emotional Resonance Engine:** A module that analyzes video and audio data to determine an “Emotional Resonance Score” (ERS).
    *   **Visual Analysis:** Employ a deep learning model (trained on datasets of human emotional expression, color psychology, and scene composition) to assess the emotional content of each frame. Output: ERS-Visual (0-100 scale). Parameters: Facial expression recognition (expanded beyond the claims to include micro-expressions), color dominance, object recognition (identifying emotionally charged objects), scene type (e.g., landscapes evoking tranquility, fast-paced action scenes evoking excitement).
    *   **Auditory Analysis:** Analyze audio for vocal tone, music genre/tempo, sound effects, and speech content.  Output: ERS-Audio (0-100 scale). Parameters: Sentiment analysis of speech, music key/mode, tempo, volume, presence of emotionally charged sound effects.
    *   **ERS Combination:** ERS = (Weight_Visual \* ERS-Visual) + (Weight_Audio \* ERS-Audio).  Weights (Weight_Visual, Weight_Audio) are adjustable parameters, potentially user-defined or determined algorithmically based on media type.
*   **Dynamic Frame Selection:**  Instead of static rules, the system dynamically selects frames based on maximizing or minimizing the ERS.  
    *   **Target ERS:** The user (or algorithm) defines a Target ERS. This represents the desired emotional response.
    *   **Frame Scoring:** Each frame is scored based on how closely its ERS matches the Target ERS.
    *   **Selection Algorithm:** Algorithm prioritizes frames with scores closest to the Target ERS, incorporating parameters for frame diversity and visual appeal (to avoid repetitive or aesthetically displeasing sequences).
*   **Web Page Generation:**
    *   **Emotional Theme:** Web page design (color palette, fonts, layout) is dynamically adjusted based on the Target ERS and the ERS of the selected frames.  For example:
        *   High Target ERS (Excitement): Bright colors, bold fonts, dynamic animations.
        *   Low Target ERS (Tranquility):  Pastel colors, soft fonts, calming animations.
    *   **Interactive Emotional Timeline:**  A visual timeline showing the ERS fluctuations throughout the selected frames. Viewers can scrub through the timeline and experience the emotional arc of the media.
    *   **Personalized Emotional Filters:** Allow viewers to adjust the Target ERS to create a personalized viewing experience.

**Pseudocode (Frame Selection):**

```
function selectFrames(mediaFile, targetERS, frameCount) {
  frames = extractFrames(mediaFile);
  scoredFrames = [];

  for (frame in frames) {
    ers = calculateERS(frame); //Uses Emotional Resonance Engine
    score = abs(ers - targetERS); //Distance from Target ERS
    scoredFrames.push({frame: frame, score: score, ers: ers});
  }

  scoredFrames.sort(function(a, b){return a.score - b.score}); //Sort by score

  selectedFrames = [];
  for (i = 0; i < frameCount; i++) {
    selectedFrames.push(scoredFrames[i].frame);
  }

  return selectedFrames;
}
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Integrate with user data (e.g., viewing history, demographics) to personalize the Target ERS.
*   Allow users to define emotional "moods" (e.g., "uplifting," "suspenseful") and have the system automatically determine the Target ERS.
*   Explore the use of generative AI to create original visual and auditory content that reinforces the desired emotional response.
