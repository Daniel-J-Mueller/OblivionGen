## Adaptive Proxy-Based Trust Scoring for Third-Party Access

**Concept:** Extend the proxy-based access control described in the patent to incorporate a dynamic trust scoring system. Instead of a simple binary 'routed via proxy'/'not routed' determination, the system will analyze network traffic *through* the proxy to assess the risk level of the user’s activity, granting granular access permissions to third-party resources based on that score.

**Specs:**

**1. Trust Score Components:**

*   **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor user actions on the third-party site (e.g., data accessed, commands executed, frequency of actions). Deviations from a baseline behavioral profile (established per user or user group) lower the trust score.
*   **Data Sensitivity:** Classify data accessed on the third-party site by sensitivity level. Accessing highly sensitive data without appropriate justification lowers the trust score.
*   **Geolocation & Time:** Compare the user’s current geolocation and access time against expected patterns. Significant deviations lower the trust score.
*   **Device Trust:** Integrate with device management systems to assess the security posture of the client device (e.g., OS version, antivirus status, encryption enabled). Low device trust lowers the trust score.
*   **Reputation Services:** Consult external threat intelligence feeds to assess the reputation of the third-party site and the user’s IP address. Negative reputation lowers the trust score.

**2. Proxy Modification:**

*   **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Implement DPI within the proxy server to analyze network traffic in real-time and extract data for trust score calculation.
*   **Traffic Mirroring:** Mirror network traffic to a separate analysis engine for more in-depth behavioral analysis.
*   **Dynamic Policy Enforcement:** The proxy server will enforce access policies based on the real-time trust score. This could include:
    *   Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for low-scoring users.
    *   Limiting access to specific data or functionalities.
    *   Blocking access entirely.
    *   Stepping up monitoring and logging.

**3. Authentication Management Service Modification:**

*   **Trust Score Integration:** The authentication management service will receive the real-time trust score from the proxy server.
*   **Policy Orchestration:** The service will orchestrate access policies based on the trust score and predefined rules.
*   **Adaptive MFA:** The service will trigger adaptive MFA based on the trust score.
*   **User Profiling:** The service will continuously update user profiles based on behavioral data.

**4. Pseudocode (Authentication Management Service):**

```
function authorize_access(user, third_party_site):
    trust_score = get_trust_score(user)

    if trust_score > 90:
        # High Trust - Grant full access
        access_granted = true
    elif trust_score > 70:
        # Medium Trust - Require MFA
        access_granted = verify_mfa(user)
    elif trust_score > 50:
        # Low Trust - Limited Access
        access_granted = limit_access(user, third_party_site)
    else:
        # Very Low Trust - Deny Access
        access_granted = false

    return access_granted
```

**5. Data Storage:**

*   **User Profiles:** Store user behavioral data, device information, and trust scores.
*   **Policy Rules:** Store access policies based on trust scores and other factors.
*   **Event Logs:** Log all access attempts and trust score changes for auditing and analysis.

This system moves beyond simple proxy verification to create a dynamic, risk-aware access control solution. It allows organizations to grant granular access to third-party resources based on the user's current behavior and security posture, enhancing security and reducing the risk of data breaches.
