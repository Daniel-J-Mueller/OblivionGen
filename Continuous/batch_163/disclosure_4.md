## Adaptive Interference Cancellation Mesh

**Concept:** Extend the multi-AP coordination to proactively *cancel* interference, not just aggregate bandwidth. This shifts from a “more pipes” approach to a “clean signal” approach, potentially allowing for significantly higher data rates *within* existing bandwidth constraints, especially in dense environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Type:** Each AP functions as both a transmitter *and* an interference sensor/canceller.
*   **Mesh Network:** APs form a self-organizing, fully connected mesh.  Communication *between* APs is constant, even when not directly serving a client.
*   **Signal Profiling:** Each AP continuously profiles the RF environment, identifying sources of interference (other APs, external sources). This isn't just about channel hopping; it's about *characterizing* the interference – frequency, amplitude, phase, temporal characteristics.
*   **Phase Shifting & Beamforming (Advanced):**  Beyond standard beamforming to a client, each AP calculates phase shifts to *actively cancel* interference at the client’s location. This requires precise time synchronization between all APs in the mesh (sub-nanosecond).
*   **Predictive Cancellation:** Employ machine learning to predict interference patterns *before* they occur, based on historical data, environmental factors (time of day, user density, weather), and even user movement patterns.
*   **Client-Aware Cancellation:**  The client device participates in the cancellation process.  It provides feedback to the mesh about the residual interference it's experiencing, allowing for dynamic adjustments to the cancellation parameters.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Cancellation Loop – per AP):**

```
// Global: Mesh network of APs, client list, interference profiles

loop:
  for each client in client list:
    // 1. Interference Estimation:
    interference_signature = estimate_interference(client_location)

    // 2. Cancellation Signal Calculation:
    cancellation_signal = calculate_cancellation_signal(interference_signature, client_location)

    // 3. Phase Adjustment:
    adjusted_phase = calculate_optimal_phase(cancellation_signal, client_location)

    // 4. Transmission:
    transmit_data(client, adjusted_phase)

    // 5. Feedback:
    residual_interference = receive_feedback(client)

    // 6. Learning & Adaptation:
    update_interference_profile(residual_interference)
```

*   Real-time signal processing libraries.
*   Network management system for monitoring and configuration.
