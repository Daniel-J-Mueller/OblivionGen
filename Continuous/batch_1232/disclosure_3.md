## Dynamic Code Composition via Semantic Chunking & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend dependency management beyond file-level granularity to *semantic chunks* within code files. Predictively assemble execution environments based on anticipated code usage *before* a request is even made, leveraging historical data and a semantic understanding of the code base.

**Specifications:**

**1. Semantic Chunking Engine:**

*   **Input:** Source code files (any supported language).
*   **Process:**
    *   Static analysis to identify logical code blocks (functions, classes, modules).
    *   Semantic hashing: Generate unique hashes for each code block based on its functionality (e.g., using AST analysis and embedding models).  Hashing should be collision resistant and sensitive to functional differences.
    *   Dependency graph construction: Map dependencies between semantic chunks *within* and *across* files.  This graph represents the actual code usage, not just file inclusion.
    *   Chunk storage: Store chunks with associated metadata (hash, dependencies, language, size, creator, last modified).
*   **Output:** Chunk manifest – a structured representation of the code base at the semantic chunk level.

**2. Predictive Execution Environment Builder:**

*   **Input:** Historical execution data (code submissions, resource usage, execution traces).  Chunk manifest.
*   **Process:**
    *   Usage pattern analysis: Identify frequently co-occurring chunks and predict future needs based on similarities to past executions.
    *   Pre-assembly:  Proactively build execution environments containing predicted chunks. Environments are created *before* a request comes in, pre-caching common configurations.
    *   Environment versioning: Maintain multiple versions of pre-assembled environments to cater to different application requirements.
*   **Output:** Pre-assembled execution environments – ready to serve incoming requests.

**3. Runtime Dependency Resolver:**

*   **Input:** User-submitted code, pre-assembled environments.
*   **Process:**
    *   Chunk identification: Extract semantic chunks required by the submitted code.
    *   Environment matching: Determine if a pre-assembled environment contains all required chunks.
    *   Dynamic loading: If a suitable environment exists, activate it. Otherwise, load missing chunks on demand.
    *   Chunk merging: If an environment partially matches, dynamically merge the missing chunks into the environment.
*   **Output:** Fully functional execution environment for the submitted code.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Chunk Store:** Central repository for storing semantic chunks.  Can utilize object storage or a distributed file system.
*   **Predictive Engine:** Responsible for analyzing historical data and generating predictions.  Implemented using machine learning models.
*   **Environment Manager:** Manages the lifecycle of pre-assembled execution environments.
*   **API Gateway:** Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate services.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Engine):**

```
function predict_chunks(user_code, historical_data):
  # Extract semantic chunks from user_code
  user_chunks = extract_chunks(user_code)

  # Find similar executions in historical_data
  similar_executions = find_similar_executions(user_chunks, historical_data)

  # Aggregate chunks from similar executions
  predicted_chunks = aggregate_chunks(similar_executions)

  # Filter out redundant chunks
  predicted_chunks = filter_redundant_chunks(predicted_chunks)

  return predicted_chunks
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Chunk:** {hash, dependencies, language, size, creator, last_modified, code}
*   **ExecutionRecord:** {user_code, chunks_used, resources_used, execution_time}
*   **Environment:** {chunks, resources, configuration}

This system moves beyond simple file-level dependency management and aims to create highly optimized, pre-provisioned execution environments based on a deep understanding of the code base and its usage patterns. This should significantly reduce latency and improve resource utilization.
