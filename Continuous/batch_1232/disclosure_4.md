## Adaptive UI Complexity based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the "inactive non-blocking" security check concept by dynamically adjusting the *complexity* of the UI presented to a user, informed by ongoing behavioral biometrics analysis *beyond* simple solution/no solution to a security check. This moves beyond detecting automated agents to potentially identifying malicious human actors exhibiting pre-attack reconnaissance behaviors.

**Specs:**

*   **Biometric Data Collection:** Integrate a continuous stream of behavioral biometric data. This includes:
    *   Mouse movement (speed, acceleration, trajectory, pauses)
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure - if available via hardware)
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, patterns)
    *   Touchscreen interactions (pressure, velocity, multi-touch gestures â€“ if applicable)
    *   Time spent on specific UI elements (dwell time).
*   **Baseline Establishment:** Upon initial user interaction (or after successful authentication), establish a personalized baseline profile of these behavioral metrics. This baseline needs to be dynamically updated over time to account for natural user variation.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Continuously compare real-time biometric data against the established baseline. Implement a scoring system to quantify the degree of deviation.
*   **Dynamic UI Adjustment:** Based on the anomaly score, adjust the complexity of the UI presented to the user.  Complexity can be modulated in several ways:
    *   **Increased Complexity:**  Introduce more form fields, CAPTCHAs (even subtly different ones), or require additional confirmation steps.
    *   **Decreased Complexity:** Simplify forms, pre-fill data, or remove redundant steps.  This can also be used as a 'trust' signal.
    *   **Asymmetric Challenges:**  Introduce UI elements that are easy for humans to navigate, but difficult for automated agents (e.g., slightly distorted text that's readable by humans but breaks OCR).
*   **Adaptive Security Checks:**  Integrate standard security checks (CAPTCHAs, etc.), but dynamically adjust the probability of their presentation based on the anomaly score.  High anomaly = higher probability of a security check.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Use the user's interaction with the dynamically adjusted UI to refine the biometric baseline and anomaly detection algorithms. This includes tracking the time it takes to complete tasks, the number of errors, and any explicit user feedback.
*   **Policy Engine Integration:**  Connect to a policy engine that allows administrators to define rules for UI complexity adjustments based on anomaly scores, user roles, device types, and other factors.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize User Profile
userProfile = initializeUserProfile()

// Main Loop
while (userSessionActive) {

  behavioralData = collectBehavioralData()
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(behavioralData, userProfile)

  // Adjust UI Complexity based on anomalyScore
  if (anomalyScore > thresholdHigh) {
    increaseUIComplexity(addCAPTCHA, addExtraFields)
  } else if (anomalyScore > thresholdMedium) {
    moderateUIComplexity(slightlyDistortText)
  } else {
    decreaseUIComplexity(prefillData)
  }

  // Update User Profile
  userProfile = updateUserProfile(behavioralData)
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard web server infrastructure.
*   Client-side Javascript to collect behavioral data.
*   Secure data storage for user profiles.

**Potential Advantages:**

*   Enhanced security against both automated agents and malicious human actors.
*   Improved user experience by reducing friction for legitimate users.
*   Real-time adaptation to changing threat landscapes.
*   Potential for proactive threat detection.
