**Dynamic Tag Inheritance & Collaborative ‘Mood Boards’**

**Concept:** Extend the user-defined tagging system to facilitate dynamic tag inheritance based on user relationships and collective ‘mood board’ creation. This moves beyond simple item recommendation to a system that anticipates user needs and exposes them to items *before* they actively search.

**Specs:**

*   **User Relationship Graph:** Implement a system to allow users to designate ‘trusted’ or ‘followed’ users. This creates a relationship graph.
*   **Tag Inheritance Weighting:** When a user tags an item, a percentage of that tag’s ‘weight’ is automatically applied to the tags of their ‘trusted’ users, and a smaller percentage to their ‘followed’ users. This weighting is adjustable per user. (e.g., Tag 'Cozy' applied by Alice with 100% weight. Bob 'trusts' Alice. Bob's profile receives 75% of the 'Cozy' weight as if *he* had tagged items with it).
*   **Mood Board Generation:** Automatically create visual ‘mood boards’ for each user based on their inherited tags and tagged items. These mood boards are dynamic and update in real-time. (Presentation: Pinterest-style grid layout)
*   **Proactive Item Exposure:** Periodically present users with items that strongly correlate with their mood board (based on tag overlap). These items are displayed in a dedicated ‘Inspired By Your Network’ section. (Presentation: Carousel/Scrollable feed)
*   **Tag ‘Blending’:** Allow users to ‘blend’ the mood boards of other users to create a temporary combined mood board. (Utility: Useful for event planning, gift ideas, etc. - The system suggests items from the combined board).
*   **‘Ghost Tags’:** Introduce ‘ghost tags’ – tags generated algorithmically based on user behavior (browsing history, purchase history) and applied *automatically* to tagged items. These are hidden from the user initially but influence recommendations. (Utility: Helps discover hidden preferences.)

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateRecommendations(user_id):
  user_tags = GetUserTags(user_id)
  network_tags = GetNetworkTags(user_id) // Tags from trusted/followed users, weighted
  combined_tags = MergeTags(user_tags, network_tags)
  
  potential_items = GetItemsByTags(combined_tags)
  
  //Score items based on tag overlap, network influence, and ghost tags
  scored_items = ScoreItems(potential_items, user_id)
  
  //Sort by score
  sorted_items = SortItems(scored_items)
  
  RETURN sorted_items
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased database storage for user relationships and tagged item associations.
*   Accelerated graph processing capabilities for real-time mood board generation.
*   Scalable recommendation engine to handle a large number of users and items.
