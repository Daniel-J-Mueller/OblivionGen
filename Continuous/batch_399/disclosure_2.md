**Adaptive Index Sharding with Data Type Affinity**

**Concept:** Expand upon the multi-type attribute indexing by introducing a sharding strategy that dynamically distributes index entries across multiple physical storage nodes *based on the predominant data type* of the indexed values within each shard. This aims to optimize query performance by minimizing cross-shard data access, especially when queries filter by specific data types.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shard Creation & Assignment:**
    *   Monitor incoming data for the target attribute.
    *   Maintain a dynamic histogram of data types for each value in the attribute.
    *   When the number of unique data types exceeds a threshold (configurable), initiate shard creation.
    *   Assign each shard a “dominant data type” – the type with the highest frequency in the current data stream.
    *   Route new values to the shard with the matching or closest dominant data type. (Fuzzy matching – e.g., string and number as potential matches)

2.  **Index Structure within Shards:**
    *   Each shard maintains a standard index structure (e.g., B-tree) optimized for its dominant data type.
    *   Implement data type tagging within each index entry.

3.  **Query Planning & Execution:**
    *   Query parser analyzes predicates on the indexed attribute.
    *   Identify the data types involved in the predicates.
    *   Query planner prioritizes shards with matching dominant data types.
    *   Generate a query plan that accesses the appropriate shards directly.
    *   If no single shard has a dominant match, distribute the query across multiple shards, merging the results.

4.  **Shard Rebalancing:**
    *   Periodically analyze data distribution across shards.
    *   If a shard's dominant data type becomes significantly less prevalent, initiate a rebalancing process.
    *   Rebalance by migrating data to shards with more appropriate dominant data types. (Can be a background task)

**Pseudocode (Query Planning):**

```
function planQuery(query, indexedAttribute):
  predicates = query.getPredicates(indexedAttribute)
  dataTypes = extractDataTypesFromPredicates(predicates)
  relevantShards = []

  for shard in shards:
    if shard.dominantDataType in dataTypes:
      relevantShards.append(shard)

  if len(relevantShards) == 0:
    // No shards match exactly, query all shards
    relevantShards = allShards

  //Generate query plan prioritizing relevantShards
  plan = generatePlan(relevantShards, query)
  return plan
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced I/O operations by accessing fewer shards.
*   Improved query performance, especially for type-specific queries.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing data distributions.

**Potential Challenges:**

*   Complexity of shard management and rebalancing.
*   Overhead of data type tracking and fuzzy matching.
*   Need for a robust shard selection algorithm.
