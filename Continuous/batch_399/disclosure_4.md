## Dynamic Encryption Sharding & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the volume encryption concept to a sharded architecture, distributing encrypted data across multiple storage nodes. This introduces resilience, scalability, and a new layer of security through dynamic key management & reconstruction.

**Specs:**

**1. Sharding Module:**

*   **Function:** Divides the block storage volume into *n* shards.
*   **Algorithm:**  A pseudorandom function determines shard boundaries, ensuring data dispersal.  Shard size is configurable.
*   **Encryption:** Each shard is encrypted with a unique key derived from a master key (see Key Management below).
*   **Redundancy:**  *k* parity shards are generated using an erasure coding scheme (e.g., Reed-Solomon). These parity shards are distributed alongside the data shards.
*   **Metadata:** Stores shard locations, encryption keys (encrypted with a separate key), and parity information.
*   **API:** `shardVolume(volumeID, shardCount, parityCount)` -> Returns shard metadata. `unshardVolume(volumeID, shardMetadata)` -> Reconstructs the volume.

**2. Key Management Service (KMS):**

*   **Master Key:**  A single, highly protected master key secures the entire system.
*   **Shard Key Derivation:** Shard keys are *dynamically* derived from the master key using a time-variant function and shard ID.  This ensures key rotation and reduces the impact of key compromise.  `deriveShardKey(masterKey, shardID, timestamp)` -> Returns shard key.
*   **Key Encryption:** Shard keys are encrypted *before* being stored in metadata, using a symmetric key managed by the KMS.
*   **Split Key Storage:** The symmetric key used to encrypt shard keys is split into *m* parts using Shamir's Secret Sharing.  These parts are distributed across different secure storage locations. This eliminates single points of failure.
*   **API:** `getKeyParts(symmetricKeyID)` -> Returns *m* key parts.  `reconstructSymmetricKey(keyParts)` -> Reconstructs the symmetric key. `encryptShardKey(shardKey, symmetricKey)` -> Encrypts shard key. `decryptShardKey(encryptedShardKey, symmetricKey)` -> Decrypts shard key.

**3. Data Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for reconstructing the original volume from the available shards.
*   **Shard Retrieval:** Retrieves shards from their respective storage nodes.
*   **Decryption:** Decrypts each shard using the corresponding shard key (retrieved and decrypted using the KMS).
*   **Erasure Coding:**  Uses the erasure coding scheme to reconstruct missing shards from the parity shards.
*   **Volume Assembly:**  Assembles the decrypted and reconstructed shards into the original volume.
*   **API:** `reconstructVolume(volumeID, shardMetadata)` -> Returns reconstructed volume.

**4. Client Integration:**

*   Client is unaware of the sharding and reconstruction process. It interacts with a single virtual volume ID.
*   Data requests are intercepted by the system and routed to the appropriate shards.
*   The system automatically handles shard retrieval, decryption, reconstruction, and data assembly before returning the data to the client.

**Pseudocode â€“ Data Read Request:**

```
function readData(volumeID, offset, size):
  shardMetadata = getShardMetadata(volumeID)
  shardID = determineShardID(offset, shardMetadata)
  shardLocation = shardMetadata[shardID].location
  encryptedData = retrieveData(shardLocation)
  symmetricKeyParts = getKeyParts(shardMetadata[shardID].symmetricKeyID)
  symmetricKey = reconstructSymmetricKey(symmetricKeyParts)
  shardKey = decryptShardKey(shardMetadata[shardID].encryptedShardKey, symmetricKey)
  decryptedData = decryptData(encryptedData, shardKey)
  return decryptedData
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple encryption by introducing sharding, dynamic key derivation, and split key storage for significantly enhanced security and resilience. The system dynamically adapts to data loss and key compromise.  This differs from the provided patent by focusing on distributed security *before* data is written, rather than just modifying encryption states *after* creation.
