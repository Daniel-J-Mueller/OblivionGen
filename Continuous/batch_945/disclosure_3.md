## Dynamic Contextual Projection

**Concept:** Extend the contextual launch interface beyond the device screen using a miniaturized, dynamically focused projector. This creates a personalized, spatially aware launch environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Miniaturized Pico-Projector (integrated into device housing - top bezel or rear) – capable of projecting a crisp image up to 12” diagonal. Resolution: 1280x720 minimum. Focus: Automatic, dynamic.
    *   Depth Sensor (Time-of-Flight or structured light) – integrated alongside the projector. Range: 0.2m – 1.2m. Accuracy: +/- 5cm.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor – to adjust projection brightness and contrast.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - for device orientation tracking
*   **Software:**
    *   **Context Engine:** (Existing from patent) - Determines user context (location, time, activity, app usage).
    *   **Projection Manager:**  Responsible for managing the projected interface.
    *   **Spatial Mapping Module:** Uses depth sensor data to create a real-time map of the surrounding environment. Detects surfaces (tables, walls, hands) for projection.
    *   **Icon Projection Algorithm:**  Dynamically projects contextual icons onto detected surfaces, arranging them based on relevance and user preference. Uses a “gravity well” approach - icons “float” towards the center of the user’s gaze (determined by camera tracking) and are subtly animated to draw the eye.
    *   **Gesture Recognition Expansion:** Extends the existing swipe/tap gestures to the projected interface.  Air-gestures (hand movements detected by the depth sensor) are used for fine-grained control.
    *   **Personalized Projection Profiles:**  Users can customize the size, layout, and animation style of the projected interface.

**Operation:**

1.  The Context Engine determines the user’s current context.
2.  The Spatial Mapping Module scans the environment for suitable projection surfaces.
3.  The Icon Projection Algorithm selects and arranges relevant application icons on the detected surface, using the “gravity well” effect to draw attention.
4.  The user can interact with the projected icons using existing swipe/tap gestures (now interpreted in 3D space) or new air-gestures.
5.  The device's camera tracks user gaze to influence icon placement and maintain visual focus.
6.  Projection brightness and contrast are dynamically adjusted based on ambient light conditions.

**Pseudocode (Icon Projection Algorithm):**

```
function projectIcons(context, availableSurfaces, relevantApps) {
  // Calculate relevance scores for each app based on context
  appScores = calculateRelevanceScores(context, relevantApps);

  // Sort apps by relevance score
  sortedApps = sortAppsByScore(appScores);

  // Determine optimal icon layout on available surfaces
  layout = calculateLayout(sortedApps, availableSurfaces);

  // Project icons onto surfaces
  for each icon in layout {
    projectIcon(icon.app, icon.surface, icon.position);
    applyAnimation(icon);
  }
}

function applyAnimation(icon) {
  // Subtle pulsing or floating animation
  // Gravity well effect - icons subtly "attracted" to user's gaze
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-Surface Projection:** Project contextual elements across multiple surfaces simultaneously.
*   **Holographic Integration:** Explore the use of holographic display technologies for a more immersive experience.
*   **Adaptive Icon Size:** Dynamically adjust icon size based on distance from the user.
*   **Augmented Reality Overlays:** Combine projected icons with AR elements for a richer information display.
