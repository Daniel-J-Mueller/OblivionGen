## Dynamic Product-Business Affinity Mapping with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the static relationship data within the patent to a dynamic system that incorporates temporal data and user interaction to refine business-product affinity. This goes beyond simply *knowing* a hardware store sells hammers – it learns *when* they’re likely to have them in stock, and how satisfied customers have been with that particular product at that location.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Real-time POS (Point of Sale) data feeds from participating businesses. (Inventory, sales volume, price)
    *   Social media listening – monitoring mentions of products *and* businesses (sentiment analysis, product discussions, stock availability posts).
    *   Crowdsourced data – mobile app integration allowing users to confirm product availability and report stock levels. (Image recognition to confirm product type, timestamped location data).
    *   External data feeds – weather data, local event schedules, seasonal trends.

2.  **Data Modeling:**
    *   Each business-product pair is assigned an “Affinity Score.”  Initial score based on existing facts (from patent).
    *   Temporal Decay Function: Affinity Score degrades over time if no recent sales or positive signals are received. Decay rate adjustable per product/business category. (e.g., perishable goods decay faster than tools).
    *   Sentiment Boost: Positive social media mentions or user reports increase Affinity Score.  Negative mentions decrease it.
    *   Stock Level Integration: Real-time stock data directly impacts Affinity Score.  Low stock = decreased score.
    *   Event/Seasonality Modifier:  Increase Affinity Score for products related to local events (e.g., BBQ grills near a music festival) or seasonal trends (e.g., snow shovels in winter).

3.  **Algorithm - Affinity Score Update:**

    ```pseudocode
    function updateAffinityScore(business, product, deltaTime) {
      baseScore = getBaseScore(business, product); // Initial score from patent data
      decayFactor = calculateDecayFactor(productCategory, deltaTime);
      decayedScore = baseScore * decayFactor;

      socialBoost = calculateSocialBoost(business, product);
      stockBoost = calculateStockBoost(business, product);
      eventBoost = calculateEventBoost(business, product);

      newScore = decayedScore + socialBoost + stockBoost + eventBoost;

      //Clamp score between 0 and 1
      newScore = max(0, min(1, newScore));

      saveAffinityScore(business, product, newScore);
    }

    function calculateDecayFactor(productCategory, deltaTime){
        //Exponential decay function
        return exp(-deltaTime * decayRate[productCategory]);
    }
    ```

4.  **API & Integration:**

    *   Search API:  Returns businesses ranked by Affinity Score for a given product.
    *   Personalization API: Adapts search results based on user location, purchase history, and preferences.
    *   Business Dashboard: Allows businesses to view their Affinity Scores, identify trending products, and manage inventory.

5.  **Hardware Considerations:**

    *   Edge Computing: Deploy lightweight versions of the algorithm to retail locations for faster response times and reduced bandwidth usage.
    *   IoT Sensors: Integrate with in-store sensors to track product movement and stock levels in real-time.

6.  **Output:**

    *   Dynamic ranking of businesses in search results.
    *   Predictive inventory alerts for retailers.
    *   Personalized product recommendations for users.
    *   Real-time stock availability information.
