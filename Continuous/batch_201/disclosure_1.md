## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Layer for Display Screens

**Concept:** Integrate a micro-actuator array *beneath* the display screen, synchronized with on-screen animations, to provide localized haptic feedback that *alters the perceived texture* of the displayed content.

**Specs:**

*   **Actuator Type:** Piezoelectric micro-actuators, arranged in a grid pattern with a density of at least 100 actuators per square inch.  Each actuator will have a stroke length of approximately 50-100 microns.
*   **Control System:**  A dedicated processing unit (co-processor to the main display controller) will receive animation data (vector graphics preferred, raster image analysis fallback) and translate it into individual actuator commands.  This requires real-time processing capability â€“ target latency: <5ms.
*   **Surface Layer:** A thin, flexible polymer layer will be positioned *between* the display panel and the actuator array.  This layer serves as a coupling medium to transfer the actuator motion to the user's finger, and will be textured (micro-ridges/patterns) to enhance the perception of texture change.
*   **Software Interface:** An API allowing developers to define "haptic profiles" for different UI elements and animations. This API will expose parameters for:
    *   Actuator amplitude (intensity of the vibration).
    *   Actuator frequency (rate of vibration).
    *   Spatial pattern (which actuators are activated).
    *   Dynamic adjustment based on user interaction (pressure, swipe speed).
*   **Animation Data Integration:**
    *   **Vector Graphics:**  If the UI is rendered using vector graphics, the system can directly control the actuators based on the shape and motion of the vectors. For example, tracing the outline of a button with actuator activation.
    *   **Raster Image Analysis:** If using raster images, a real-time image processing algorithm will analyze the image to identify edges, textures, and gradients, then map these features to actuator activation patterns.
*   **Power Management:** Implement power-saving modes.  Actuators will only be activated for UI elements the user is currently interacting with or for specific animation sequences.
*   **Calibration Routine:**  A built-in calibration routine will measure the mechanical properties of the display assembly and adjust actuator parameters to compensate for variations in manufacturing and environmental conditions.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Enhanced Button Presses:** Simulate the feel of physically pressing a button.
*   **Texture Simulation:**  Make displayed textures (wood, metal, fabric) *feel* realistic.
*   **Dynamic UI Elements:**  Create UI elements that change their texture based on user interaction.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide tactile feedback for visually impaired users.
*   **Gaming:**  Immersive haptic feedback for games (e.g., feeling the texture of a terrain).

**Pseudocode (Actuator Control Loop):**

```
// For each frame:
For each actuator in actuator_array:
  actuator.amplitude = 0.0
  actuator.frequency = 0.0

For each UI_element in active_UI_elements:
  if UI_element.is_visible and UI_element.is_interactive:
    // Get the shape/texture of the UI element
    shape = UI_element.get_shape()

    // Calculate actuator activation pattern based on shape
    actuator_pattern = calculate_actuator_pattern(shape)

    // Apply the activation pattern to the actuators
    For each actuator in actuator_pattern:
      actuator.amplitude = UI_element.interaction_intensity
      actuator.frequency = UI_element.animation_frequency

// Update actuator states
update_actuator_states()
```
