**Dynamic Virtual Network Slicing with AI-Driven Resource Allocation**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a system where virtual networks aren't static entities defined by templates, but dynamically ‘sliced’ and reconfigured in real-time based on application demand and predicted latency requirements, orchestrated by an AI engine.  This moves beyond pre-defined templates to truly fluid network infrastructure.

**II. Components:**

*   **AI Prediction Engine:**  A machine learning model trained on historical application performance data (latency, throughput, resource utilization) and real-time telemetry.  This engine *predicts* future resource needs for applications running within virtual networks.  Key inputs include user location, application type, time of day, and ongoing event data.
*   **Virtual Network Slicer:** A software component capable of dynamically partitioning a larger virtual network into smaller, isolated slices.  These slices represent dedicated resources (bandwidth, compute, storage) for specific applications or user groups. This relies on advanced SR-IOV and DPDK technology for high performance.
*   **Edge Location Awareness Module:** A component that maintains a real-time map of available resources at each edge location (provider substrate extension). This module accounts for both physical capacity and current utilization levels.
*   **Resource Orchestration Engine:**  This engine receives predictions from the AI model and instructions from the Resource Orchestration Engine. It then dynamically allocates resources (network slices, compute instances, storage) at the optimal edge locations.
*   **Latency Budgeting System:** A module that defines latency budgets for applications, based on their requirements. The system will proactively adjust network slicing and resource allocation to meet these budgets.

**III. Operational Flow (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
Train AI Model on historical performance data
Establish latency budgets for applications

// Real-time Operation
While (Application Running) {
  // 1. Data Collection
  Collect real-time telemetry (latency, throughput, utilization)
  Collect user location data

  // 2. Prediction
  AI_Prediction = AI Model(telemetry, user_location) // Predict future resource needs

  // 3. Slice Evaluation
  IF (AI_Prediction.resource_needs > current_slice_capacity) {
    // Need more resources
    // Evaluate available edge locations
    best_edge_location = find_best_edge_location(AI_Prediction, edge_location_map)
    // Create a new network slice at best_edge_location
    new_slice = create_network_slice(best_edge_location, AI_Prediction)
    // Assign resources to the new slice
    allocate_resources(new_slice, AI_Prediction)
    // Redirect traffic to the new slice
    redirect_traffic(AI_Prediction, new_slice)
  }
  ELSE IF (AI_Prediction.resource_needs < current_slice_capacity) {
    // Resources are over-provisioned
    // Scale down the current slice
    scale_down_slice(current_slice, AI_Prediction)
  }
}
```

**IV. Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Resource Allocation:** Shifting from reactive scaling to proactive allocation based on predicted demand.
*   **AI-Driven Optimization:** Leveraging machine learning to optimize resource allocation for latency and performance.
*   **Dynamic Network Slicing:** Enabling the creation and destruction of network slices on demand.
*   **Edge Location Awareness:** Intelligently selecting edge locations based on user location and latency requirements.

**V. Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time gaming
*   AR/VR applications
*   Autonomous vehicles
*   Industrial IoT
*   Live video streaming
