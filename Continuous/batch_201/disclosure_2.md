## Dynamic Role-Based Sharding with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the role-based leadership concept to dynamically shard a distributed service's workload *based on predicted resource availability of nodes holding specific roles*, rather than static sharding or purely reactive load balancing. This leverages the role assignment system to proactively optimize performance and resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Role-Aware Resource Monitoring:**

*   Each node continuously monitors its resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O, disk I/O).
*   This data is tagged with the node’s currently assigned role(s) – leader, follower, backup leader, etc.
*   A central ‘Resource Prediction Service’ (RPS) aggregates this data.  RPS employs time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to *predict* future resource availability for each role. This allows anticipating bottlenecks *before* they occur.
*   The RPS maintains a ‘Role Capacity Map’ – a dynamic representation of available resources categorized by role.

**2. Work Request Tagging:**

*   Incoming work requests are tagged with a ‘Service Category’ (e.g., ‘data processing,’ ‘API request,’ ‘background task’).
*   Each Service Category has a ‘Resource Profile’ specifying its average and peak resource requirements.

**3. Intelligent Sharding Logic (Integrated with Role Manager):**

*   The Role Manager, *prior to assigning a work request*, consults the RPS's Role Capacity Map.
*   The Role Manager selects a node *based on both its role and its predicted resource availability for the tagged Service Category*.  This is a multi-criteria optimization problem.
*   Priority is given to nodes holding roles that are *well-suited* to the work (e.g., a data processing request is routed to a leader or follower node with significant memory).
*   The Role Manager dynamically adjusts the sharding distribution based on the predicted load. If a leader is predicted to become overloaded, work is proactively diverted to follower nodes.

**4.  Dynamic Role Adjustment (Reactive Component):**

*   If RPS detects a sudden, unexpected resource bottleneck *despite* proactive sharding, a ‘Role Adjustment Protocol’ is triggered.
*   This protocol temporarily ‘demotes’ the overloaded node (e.g., from leader to follower) and promotes a backup node. This minimizes disruption to service.
*   Demotion/promotion decisions are based on a cost-benefit analysis considering the impact on overall service performance.

**5.  Pseudocode (Role Manager - Work Request Routing):**

```
function routeWorkRequest(request):
  category = request.serviceCategory
  resourceProfile = getResourceProfile(category)
  
  eligibleNodes = []
  for node in allNodes:
    if node.role in getEligibleRoles(category):
      predictedAvailability = getPredictedAvailability(node, category)
      if predictedAvailability > threshold:
        eligibleNodes.append(node)

  if eligibleNodes is empty:
    // Handle overload – escalate, queue, etc.
    return ERROR

  bestNode = selectBestNode(eligibleNodes, resourceProfile) // Uses a weighted score based on predicted availability, role priority, and network latency
  
  sendWorkRequest(request, bestNode)
```

**6.  Data Structures:**

*   **Role Capacity Map:**  `{role: {CPU_availability: float, Memory_availability: float, …}, …}`
*   **Resource Profile:**  `{CPU_required: float, Memory_required: float, …}`
*   **Node Status:**  `{role: string, CPU_usage: float, Memory_usage: float, …}`

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply assigning roles and distributing load. It proactively *predicts* resource needs based on roles and dynamically optimizes sharding *before* bottlenecks occur, using time-series forecasting and multi-criteria optimization. It combines role-based assignment with intelligent, predictive sharding, creating a highly resilient and performant distributed system.
