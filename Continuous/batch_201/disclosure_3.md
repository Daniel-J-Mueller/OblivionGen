## Dynamic Information Region ‘Ecosystems’

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic adjustment of information regions beyond size and position to encompass interconnected ‘ecosystems’ of content, reacting to user behavior and external data in real-time.  Instead of individual regions adjusting independently, they interact, ‘budding’ new regions, merging existing ones, or even dissolving entirely based on user engagement and contextual relevance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Ecosystem Definition & Seed Regions:**

*   Define a set of ‘seed’ information regions (e.g., "Trending Products," "Personalized Recommendations," "Support Articles"). These are the initial building blocks.
*   Each seed region has associated ‘growth parameters’:
    *   `Activation Threshold`: Minimum user interaction required to trigger ecosystem growth.
    *   `Growth Rate`:  How quickly new regions ‘bud’ based on continued interaction.
    *   `Decay Rate`:  How quickly regions shrink/dissolve with inactivity.
    *   `Resource Pool`: Limits the total ‘size’ (screen real estate) an ecosystem can occupy.
    *   `Content Affinity Matrix`: Defines which content types/topics can spawn new regions *from* this seed. (e.g., "Trending Products" can spawn "Similar Items," "Customer Reviews," "Related Categories").
*   Each region has a `Content Source` and `Content Filter`.

**2.  User Interaction & Ecosystem Growth:**

*   Track user interactions (clicks, dwell time, scrolling, purchases, etc.) within each information region.
*   When an interaction exceeds the `Activation Threshold`, check the `Content Affinity Matrix`.
*   If a matching content type is found:
    *   A new information region is ‘budded’ (created) with content sourced from the specified `Content Source` and filtered by the `Content Filter`.
    *   The new region is initially small and positioned near the activating region.
    *   The activating region and the new region are linked.

**3.  Dynamic Linking & Merging:**

*   Regions can be linked to create 'chains' or 'clusters' of related content.
*   If two linked regions have high overlap in content or user engagement, they can *merge* into a single, larger region.
*   A ‘cohesion score’ determines the strength of the link and the likelihood of a merge.
*   The cohesion score factors in content similarity, user engagement, and proximity on the display.

**4. Ecosystem Decay & Resource Management:**

*   If a region remains inactive for a defined period, its `Decay Rate` is applied, shrinking its size and reducing its prominence.
*   If a region shrinks below a minimum size, it is dissolved (removed from the display).
*   The `Resource Pool` limits the total screen real estate occupied by the ecosystem.  If the ecosystem reaches its resource limit, new regions cannot bud, and existing regions compete for space.

**5. External Data Integration:**

*   Integrate external data sources (e.g., social media trends, news feeds, weather data) to influence ecosystem growth.
*   Example:  If a user is browsing outdoor gear and a major snowstorm is predicted, a "Winter Weather Gear" region could spontaneously bud and gain prominence.

**Pseudocode (Ecosystem Update Loop):**

```pseudocode
FOR EACH region IN ecosystem:
  interaction = getUserInteraction(region)
  IF interaction > region.activationThreshold:
    newRegionType = getAffinityMatch(region)
    IF newRegionType != NULL:
      newRegion = createRegion(newRegionType, region.contentSource, region.contentFilter)
      positionNewRegion(newRegion, region)
  region.size = adjustSize(region.size, interaction, region.growthRate, region.decayRate)
  IF region.size < minRegionSize:
      removeRegion(region)

#Resource Management
totalSize = calculateTotalEcosystemSize()
IF totalSize > resourcePool:
    #Prioritize and shrink/remove regions
    prioritizeRegions()
    shrinkOrRemoveRegions()
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user views a product page for a running shoe.

1.  A "Similar Shoes" region buds.
2.  The user clicks on a review within the "Similar Shoes" region.
3.  A "Customer Reviews" region buds, linked to the "Customer Reviews" section of the product page.
4.  The user adds the shoe to their cart.
5.  A "Recommended Accessories" region buds, linked to the cart and suggesting socks and insoles.
6.  If the user doesn't interact with "Recommended Accessories" after a few minutes, it begins to shrink, eventually dissolving.
