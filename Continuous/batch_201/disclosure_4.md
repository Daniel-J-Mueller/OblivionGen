## Personalized Authentication ‘Echo’

**Concept:** Expand transaction history authentication beyond simple item recognition. Introduce a ‘temporal echo’ – a sequence of previously interacted-with items presented for recall, rather than single selection. This aims for higher security *and* a richer user experience, leveraging memory and pattern recognition.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Storage:** Maintain a detailed transaction history, timestamped. Not just *what* was purchased, but *when*, and in what sequence. Include browsing history, wishlist activity, even abandoned carts. Categorize items (e.g., "electronics," "clothing," "books").
*   **Trigger:** Similar to the patent – triggered after initial username/password validation or profile access attempt.
*   **Echo Generation:**
    *   Algorithm selects a sequence of 3-5 items from the user’s transaction history. Sequence is determined *not* by purchase date, but by temporal proximity - items frequently purchased *together* or within a short timeframe.
    *   Items can be represented visually (images), textually (descriptions), or a combination.
    *   Distractor items (similar to patent claims) are also included, but weighted lower in the selection process. They should be from categories the user frequently browses, but not purchased.
*   **Presentation:** Items are presented in a randomized order within a user interface. The user must reconstruct the *original order* of the sequence.
*   **Authentication Logic:**
    *   Correct order = successful authentication.
    *   Partial matches can be used for multi-factor authentication (e.g., correct sequence + SMS code).
    *   Algorithm adjusts difficulty dynamically based on user behavior. More frequent/correct responses increase sequence length/complexity.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Clean, minimalist design. Focus on visual clarity.
    *   Drag-and-drop interface for reordering items.
    *   Optional hints (e.g., approximate timeframe).
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_echo(user_id):
  history = get_transaction_history(user_id)
  sequences = find_frequent_sequences(history) // Algorithm to identify common item sequences
  echo_sequence = select_sequence(sequences) // Select a sequence from the found sequences

  distractors = get_distractor_items(user_id) // Get items from browsed categories but not purchased
  all_items = echo_sequence + distractors
  shuffle(all_items)

  return all_items

function authenticate(user_input, generated_echo):
  // Compare user input sequence with the original echo sequence.
  // Return true if match, false otherwise.
  // Can incorporate fuzzy matching and error tolerance.

function dynamic_difficulty(user_performance):
  // Adjust sequence length and complexity based on user's authentication success rate.
```

**Expansion:** Incorporate a ‘memory score’ that tracks the user’s ability to recall past transactions. This could be used to tailor the authentication experience and provide personalized rewards.
