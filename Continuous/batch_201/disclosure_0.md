## Predictive Access Control & Geofencing for A/V Devices

**Concept:** Expand the location-based access control beyond simple proximity checks to incorporate predictive modeling of user behavior and dynamically adjusted geofences. This will anticipate access needs *before* a user physically arrives at a location and preemptively authorize or deny access, enhancing security and usability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection Module:**

*   **Input:**
    *   A/V Device Location (GPS, WiFi triangulation, IP address).
    *   Client Device Location (GPS, WiFi triangulation, IP address).
    *   User Access History (timestamps of successful/failed access attempts, associated user accounts).
    *   User Calendar Data (optional, with explicit user consent - meetings, appointments indicating potential location).
    *   Environmental Data (optional, with explicit user consent - traffic conditions, weather impacting travel).
*   **Function:** Continuously collects and anonymizes data points (user opting out of data collection must default to basic geofencing).
*   **Output:** Structured data stream for the Predictive Modeling Engine.

**2. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** Hybrid approach:
    *   **Markov Chain:** Models frequently visited locations and transition probabilities.
    *   **Time Series Analysis:** Identifies recurring access patterns based on time of day, day of week, etc.
    *   **Machine Learning (Regression/Classification):** Predicts access likelihood based on historical data, calendar events, and environmental factors.
*   **Training Data:** Data collected by the Data Collection Module.  Continuous retraining with new data.
*   **Output:** Probability score representing the likelihood of a user attempting to access the A/V device within a defined timeframe.

**3. Dynamic Geofence Generator:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Predictive Modeling Engine output (probability score).
    *   User-defined geofence radius (default setting).
    *   A/V device location.
*   **Function:**
    *   Dynamically adjusts the geofence radius based on the probability score.  High score -> expands radius, allowing access from a wider area *before* the user arrives.  Low score -> shrinks radius or denies access preemptively.
    *   Uses a smoothing algorithm to prevent rapid geofence fluctuations (e.g., exponential moving average).
*   **Output:** Dynamically adjusted geofence coordinates.

**4. Access Control Module (integrated with existing patent system):**

*   **Input:** Client device access request, current location, dynamically adjusted geofence coordinates.
*   **Function:**
    *   Compares client device location to the dynamic geofence.
    *   Authorizes access if within the geofence.
    *   If outside geofence:
        *   Triggers a secondary verification step (e.g., biometric authentication, PIN code).
        *   If secondary verification fails, denies access.
*   **Output:** Access granted/denied signal.

**Pseudocode (Access Control Module):**

```
function handleAccessRequest(clientLocation, dynamicGeofence):
  if distance(clientLocation, dynamicGeofence) <= geofenceRadius:
    return "ACCESS_GRANTED"
  else:
    //Secondary Verification
    verificationResult = initiateSecondaryVerification(clientDevice)
    if verificationResult == "SUCCESS":
      return "ACCESS_GRANTED"
    else:
      return "ACCESS_DENIED"
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** Implement robust privacy controls. User data should be anonymized and encrypted. Users should have the ability to opt out of data collection.
*   **False Positives:** Implement mechanisms to mitigate false positives (e.g., allowing users to override access denial with secondary verification).
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of A/V devices and users.
*   **Edge Computing:** Push some of the processing (e.g., geofence calculation) to the edge (A/V device or client device) to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
