## Dynamic Chute Reconfiguration & Predictive Sorting

**Concept:** Expand beyond fixed chute assignments and introduce a system where chute configurations *dynamically* adjust based on real-time object attribute data and *predictive* modeling of incoming object types.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Augmentation:**

*   **Actuated Chutes:** Each chute is equipped with linear actuators allowing for minor positional adjustments (horizontal and vertical).  Range of motion: +/- 5cm in each direction. Precision: 1mm.
*   **Chute Array:**  The existing chute structure is expanded to be a denser array, allowing for greater flexibility in redirecting objects. Minimum chute width: 7cm.
*   **High-Speed Conveyor Network:**  A secondary, high-speed conveyor network *above* the chute array. This network receives objects *before* they reach the chute selection point and can rapidly re-orient or reposition them.
*   **Multi-Modal Sensor Suite:** Supplement existing cameras with:
    *   **Weight Sensors:** Integrated into the conveyor belt immediately before the chute array.
    *   **Lidar/Depth Sensors:**  Provide precise 3D object profiling.
    *   **Material Sensors:**  (e.g., NIR Spectroscopy) Detect object material composition.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Predictive Sorting Model:** A machine learning model (trained on historical object data) that predicts the type and attributes of incoming objects *before* they reach the chute selection point.  Inputs: real-time sensor data (weight, dimensions, material). Output: Probability distribution over object types and attribute values (size, shape, packaging).
*   **Dynamic Chute Allocation Algorithm:**  This algorithm receives the predictive output from the ML model and dynamically assigns chutes to optimize sorting efficiency. The algorithm considers:
    *   **Chute Capacity:**  Each chute has a maximum capacity.
    *   **Object Attributes:** Chute assignments are based on a cost function that minimizes the mismatch between object attributes and chute characteristics (width, depth, angle).
    *   **Real-time Chute Status:** Tracks which chutes are full or blocked.
*   **Actuator Control System:**  Controls the linear actuators to adjust chute positions based on the dynamic allocation algorithm.
*   **Data Fusion Module:** Integrates data from all sensors (cameras, weight sensors, lidar, material sensors).
*   **Object Tracking System:**  Identifies and tracks individual objects as they move through the system.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  Object enters the system and is scanned by the multi-modal sensor suite.
2.  Data is fused and fed into the Predictive Sorting Model.
3.  The Predictive Sorting Model generates a probability distribution over object types and attributes.
4.  The Dynamic Chute Allocation Algorithm selects the optimal chute based on the prediction and real-time system status.
5.  The Actuator Control System adjusts the chute position as needed.
6.  The Object Tracking System guides the object to the assigned chute.
7.  System continuously monitors performance and retrains the Predictive Sorting Model to improve accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Chute Allocation Algorithm):**

```
function allocateChute(object, predictedAttributes, chuteArray):
  bestChute = null
  minCost = infinity

  for each chute in chuteArray:
    cost = calculateCost(object, predictedAttributes, chute)

    if cost < minCost:
      minCost = cost
      bestChute = chute

  return bestChute

function calculateCost(object, predictedAttributes, chute):
  # Cost function considers:
  #   - Mismatch between object size and chute width
  #   - Mismatch between object shape and chute geometry
  #   - Chute fullness
  #   - Penalty for excessive chute adjustments
  cost = abs(objectSize - chuteWidth) +  abs(objectShape - chuteGeometry) + chuteFullnessPenalty + adjustmentPenalty
  return cost
```
