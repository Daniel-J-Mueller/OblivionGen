**Dynamic Volumetric Display with CPFL Projection**

**Concept:** Extend the CPFL technology into true 3D volumetric displays. Instead of projecting onto a 2D reflective surface, use the CPFL panel to illuminate a rotating or oscillating transparent medium (e.g., a rapidly spinning disc, a vibrating gel, or a phased array of micro-mirrors) creating a persistent 3D image.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Volumetric Medium:**
    *   Material: Highly transparent polymer gel or rapidly rotating acrylic/glass disc with a specialized coating to maximize light scattering/reflection. Phased micro-mirror array is also viable.
    *   Dimensions: Variable, target initial size: 10cm diameter/height sphere/cylinder.
    *   Rotation/Vibration Profile: Precisely controlled by a micro-controller, adjustable speed (0-1000 RPM for disc; variable frequency/amplitude for gel/mirrors).

2.  **CPFL Panel Array:**
    *   Configuration: Instead of a single CPFL panel, employ an array of panels surrounding the volumetric medium. Minimum of 6 panels, ideally 12+ for full 360-degree rendering.
    *   Panel Type: Utilize the existing CPFL technology, but with increased pixel density and brightness.
    *   Synchronization: All panels are synchronized via a high-speed communication bus, controlled by a central processing unit.

3.  **Image Generation & Projection System:**
    *   3D Model Input: Accepts 3D model data (e.g., STL, OBJ).
    *   Slicing Algorithm: Divides the 3D model into thin slices corresponding to the depth of the volumetric medium.
    *   CPFL Panel Mapping: Assigns each slice to one or more CPFL panels for projection. Panels dynamically adjust color and intensity based on the slice data.
    *   Perspective Correction: Algorithm compensates for perspective distortion based on the viewing angle and the position of the volumetric medium.
    *   Persistence of Vision: By rapidly updating the projected slices and utilizing the rotation/vibration of the medium, creates the illusion of a persistent 3D image.

4.  **Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller: High-performance microcontroller (e.g., STM32, ESP32) to manage panel synchronization, motor control, and communication with the host system.
    *   Motor Driver: Precision motor driver to control the speed and position of the rotating/vibrating medium.
    *   Communication Interface: USB, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth interface for data transfer and control.

**Pseudocode (Image Rendering):**

```
function render_frame(3D_model, viewpoint):
    slices = slice_3D_model(3D_model, slice_thickness)
    for slice in slices:
        slice_depth = calculate_slice_depth(slice)
        panels = determine_projecting_panels(slice_depth)
        for panel in panels:
            pixel_data = calculate_pixel_data(slice, viewpoint, panel)
            send_pixel_data_to_panel(panel, pixel_data)
    update_panel_display()
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrate ultrasonic transducers to create localized haptic feedback points within the volumetric display.
*   **Multi-User Interaction:** Implement gesture recognition to allow users to interact with the 3D image.
*   **Dynamic Scene Rendering:**  Enable real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes.
