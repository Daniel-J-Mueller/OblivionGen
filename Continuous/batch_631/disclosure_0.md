## Adaptive Feature Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Extend the existing token model by dynamically adjusting feature weights within the token representation using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This allows the model to learn which features are most salient for determining relationships, optimizing performance and potentially uncovering hidden relationships.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Core Neural Network:** The existing neural network model (as described in the patent) forms the foundation.
*   **Feature Weighting Module:** A new module inserted *after* the initial token embedding layer. This module receives the feature vector representing each token.
*   **RL Agent:** A separate RL agent (e.g., a Deep Q-Network or Policy Gradient method) responsible for adjusting the weights of individual features.
*   **Reward Function:** The reward function is crucial. It should be based on the accuracy of the relationship indicator generated by the core neural network.  A potential reward could be a function of the margin between the predicted similarity score and the ground truth, encouraging better discrimination.
*   **Environment:** The environment for the RL agent is defined by the current state of the token embeddings and the resulting relationship prediction.

**2. Feature Weighting Module Details:**

*   **Input:** Feature vector representing a single token (e.g., a 100-dimensional vector).
*   **Process:**
    *   The RL agent observes the feature vector.
    *   The agent outputs a set of scalar weights, one for each feature in the vector. These weights represent the agent's assessment of each feature's importance.
    *   The feature vector is multiplied element-wise by the weight vector, scaling each feature's contribution.
    *   The scaled feature vector is passed to the next layer of the core neural network.
*   **Output:** Scaled feature vector.

**3. RL Agent Details:**

*   **State:** The state observed by the RL agent could include:
    *   The current feature vector.
    *   The output of the previous layer in the core neural network.
    *   A measure of the current uncertainty in the relationship prediction.
*   **Action:** The action taken by the RL agent is to adjust the weights of the features in the input vector. The action space could be discrete (e.g., increase, decrease, or maintain the weight) or continuous (allowing for fine-grained adjustment).
*   **Training:** The RL agent is trained using a standard RL algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, or policy gradients). The reward signal is derived from the performance of the core neural network on a validation set.

**4. Pseudocode (RL Agent Update):**

```pseudocode
// For each training example:
// 1. Obtain input token feature vector (token_features)
// 2. RL Agent observes token_features (state = token_features)
// 3. RL Agent selects action (action = select_action(state)) -  a vector of weight adjustments
// 4. Apply adjustments: weighted_features = token_features * (1 + action) // Element-wise multiplication
// 5. Pass weighted_features through core neural network
// 6. Obtain relationship prediction (prediction)
// 7. Calculate reward: reward = calculate_reward(prediction, ground_truth)
// 8. Update RL Agent's policy based on (state, action, reward)
```

**5. Implementation Considerations:**

*   **Exploration vs. Exploitation:**  The RL agent needs to balance exploration (trying new weight adjustments) with exploitation (using known good adjustments).
*   **Reward Shaping:** Carefully designing the reward function is crucial for successful training.
*   **Computational Cost:** Training the RL agent adds computational overhead.
*   **Generalization:** The RL agent needs to generalize well to unseen tokens and relationships.
*   **Distributed Training:**  Consider distributing the training of the RL agent across multiple devices to speed up the process.
