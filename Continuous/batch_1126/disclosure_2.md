## Multi-Layer Dielectric Phased Array with Rotational Beamforming

**Concept:** Expand upon the phased array antenna concept by creating a multi-layered structure utilizing varying dielectric constants and mechanically rotating individual dielectric layers to achieve both electronic and mechanical beam steering. This allows for a wider beam steering range and potentially higher gain compared to purely electronic steering.

**Specs:**

*   **Substrate:** Stacked dielectric layers (minimum 3 layers) with differing dielectric constants (e.g., Rogers 4350, Polyimide, air gaps). Layer thicknesses between 0.5mm and 2mm.
*   **Antenna Elements:** Patch antennas etched onto the top dielectric layer, fed by microstrip lines. Element spacing: λ/2 (where λ is the operating wavelength).  Minimum 64 elements per array.
*   **Rotation Mechanism:** Each dielectric layer (except the bottom-most) is mounted on a miniature rotary actuator (piezoelectric or MEMS-based).  Actuators controlled by a dedicated controller.  Rotation range: ±15 degrees per layer. Resolution: 0.1 degrees.
*   **Feed Network:**  A phased feed network integrated into the bottom dielectric layer, providing individual phase and amplitude control to each antenna element. Utilize a digital step attenuator for amplitude control.
*   **Control System:** A microcontroller-based system to coordinate the phased feed network and the dielectric layer rotation actuators. Real-time control loop for beam steering.
*   **Frequency Range:** 2.4 GHz to 5.8 GHz (adjustable via software).
*   **Power Supply:** 5V DC.

**Operation:**

1.  The phased feed network controls the phase and amplitude of the signal to each antenna element, enabling electronic beam steering.
2.  The control system calculates the required rotation angle for each dielectric layer to achieve the desired beam direction.
3.  The miniature rotary actuators rotate each dielectric layer, physically altering the radiation pattern and enhancing beam steering capabilities.
4.  A closed-loop control algorithm compensates for any mechanical inaccuracies or drift.

**Pseudocode (Beam Steering Algorithm):**

```
// Input: Desired Azimuth (Az) and Elevation (El) angles
// Output: Phase shift values for each antenna element and rotation angles for each dielectric layer

function steerBeam(Az, El):
  // Calculate the steering vector based on Az and El
  steeringVector = calculateSteeringVector(Az, El)

  // Calculate the phase shift for each antenna element
  phaseShifts = calculatePhaseShifts(steeringVector)

  // Calculate the rotation angles for each dielectric layer
  rotationAngles = calculateRotationAngles(Az, El)

  // Apply phase shifts to the phased feed network
  setPhaseShifts(phaseShifts)

  // Rotate dielectric layers
  rotateLayers(rotationAngles)

  return phaseShifts, rotationAngles
```

**Innovation:** Combining electronic and mechanical beam steering allows for a wider steering range, higher gain, and potentially reduced power consumption compared to traditional phased arrays. The multi-layered approach provides greater flexibility in shaping the radiation pattern and optimizing performance.  The use of miniature actuators and a closed-loop control system ensures precise and reliable beam steering.
