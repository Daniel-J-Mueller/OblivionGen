## Dynamic Entropy Profiling for Author Attribution & Malicious Code Detection

**Concept:** Extend entropy analysis beyond simply identifying *potential* security risks within code to actively profile authors based on their characteristic entropy signatures and detect malicious insertions based on deviation from established author profiles.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Baseline Profiling**

1.  **Codebase Ingestion:** System ingests a target codebase (or collection of codebases).
2.  **Author Identification:** System associates code blocks (functions, classes, modules) with authors (commit history, code ownership metadata).  If author is unknown, assign a temporary identifier.
3.  **Entropy Feature Extraction:** For each author and code block, extract a range of entropy features:
    *   **Block Entropy:**  Calculate Shannon entropy for the code block itself.
    *   **String Entropy:** Calculate entropy of string literals within the block.
    *   **Keyword Entropy:**  Calculate entropy of keywords used in the block.
    *   **Identifier Entropy:** Calculate entropy of variable/function names in the block.
    *   **Control Flow Entropy:**  A measure of the complexity of control flow structures (if/else, loops) within the block.  (This can be approximated through parsing and abstract syntax tree analysis).
4.  **Feature Vector Creation:**  Combine the extracted entropy features into a feature vector for each code block.
5.  **Author Profile Generation:** For each author, create a statistical profile of their feature vectors.  This can be a simple mean/standard deviation for each feature, or a more complex model like a Gaussian Mixture Model.

**II. Anomaly Detection & Insertion Identification**

1.  **New Code Block Analysis:** When a new code block is introduced (e.g., through a commit), analyze its entropy features and create a feature vector.
2.  **Author Attribution:**  Compare the new code block's feature vector to the established author profiles.  Use a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) to determine the most likely author.
3.  **Anomaly Scoring:** Calculate an anomaly score based on:
    *   **Attribution Confidence:** The degree of confidence in the author attribution (e.g., the similarity score).
    *   **Deviation from Profile:** The distance of the new code block's feature vector from the attributed author's profile.  Larger distances indicate greater deviation.
    *   **Entropy Spike:** A measure of how much the entropy of the new code block exceeds the typical entropy of code written by the attributed author.
4.  **Flagging & Alerting:**  If the anomaly score exceeds a configurable threshold, flag the code block as potentially malicious or suspicious.  Provide an alert with the anomaly score and the reasons for the flagging.

**III. Implementation Details (Pseudocode)**

```python
# Data Structures
class EntropyFeatureVector:
    def __init__(self, block_entropy, string_entropy, keyword_entropy, identifier_entropy, control_flow_entropy):
        self.block_entropy = block_entropy
        self.string_entropy = string_entropy
        # ... other features ...

class AuthorProfile:
    def __init__(self, mean_vector, std_dev_vector):
        self.mean_vector = mean_vector # EntropyFeatureVector
        self.std_dev_vector = std_dev_vector # EntropyFeatureVector

# Functions
def calculate_entropy_features(code_block):
    # Implementation details for calculating entropy features
    # Returns an EntropyFeatureVector object
    pass

def calculate_anomaly_score(new_feature_vector, author_profile):
    # Implementation details for calculating anomaly score
    # Considers attribution confidence, deviation from profile, and entropy spike
    pass

def analyze_new_code_block(code_block, author_profiles):
    # 1. Calculate entropy features for the new code block
    new_feature_vector = calculate_entropy_features(code_block)

    # 2. Determine most likely author
    best_author = None
    best_similarity = -1
    for author, profile in author_profiles.items():
        similarity = calculate_similarity(new_feature_vector, profile.mean_vector)
        if similarity > best_similarity:
            best_similarity = similarity
            best_author = author

    # 3. Calculate anomaly score
    anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(new_feature_vector, author_profiles[best_author])

    # 4. Return anomaly score and author attribution
    return anomaly_score, best_author
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Language-Specific Models:**  Develop separate models for different programming languages to account for variations in coding style and common patterns.
*   **Machine Learning:**  Train a machine learning classifier to predict malicious code based on entropy features and author profiles.
*   **Real-Time Analysis:**  Integrate the system into a CI/CD pipeline to perform real-time analysis of code commits.
*   **Visualization:** Create visualizations of author profiles and anomaly scores to help developers identify suspicious code.
