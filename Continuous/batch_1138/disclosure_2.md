## Adaptive API Orchestration with Predictive Caching & Security Profiles

**Specification:** A system extending the described patent to incorporate predictive caching *and* dynamic security profiles based on real-time API usage patterns and threat intelligence feeds.  This isn't just about mapping APIs, it's about *anticipating* needs and proactively securing the connections.

**Components:**

1.  **Usage Pattern Analyzer:**  Monitors all proxy API requests, analyzing parameters, frequency, source IPs, and response sizes.  Uses time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future API call volume and parameter combinations.

2.  **Predictive Cache Manager:** Based on the Usage Pattern Analyzer's predictions, pre-fetches and caches likely API responses.  Implements a tiered caching system:
    *   **Hot Cache:**  Very fast, in-memory cache for the most frequently predicted requests.
    *   **Warm Cache:**  SSD-based cache for moderately predicted requests.
    *   **Cold Cache:**  Disk-based cache for less frequent but potentially important requests.
    *   Cache invalidation is triggered by time-to-live *and* parameter changes detected by the Usage Pattern Analyzer.

3.  **Threat Intelligence Integrator:**  Consumes real-time threat feeds (e.g., known malicious IPs, vulnerability databases) and dynamically adjusts security profiles.

4.  **Dynamic Security Profile Engine:** Creates and applies security profiles based on:
    *   Source IP reputation (from Threat Intelligence Integrator).
    *   API sensitivity (defined by administrator – e.g., financial APIs are higher sensitivity).
    *   Usage Pattern Analyzer – detects anomalous behavior (e.g., sudden spike in requests from an unusual source).
    *   Security actions: rate limiting, request blocking, multi-factor authentication prompts, payload inspection.

5. **API Schema Evolution Handler:** A module that automatically adapts to changes in backend API schemas.  It detects schema drifts, provides alerts, and can automatically map new or modified parameters using machine learning (e.g. embedding similarity).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Security Profile Engine):**

```
function applySecurityProfile(request):
  sourceIP = request.sourceIP
  apiName = request.apiName
  parameters = request.parameters

  sourceIPReputation = ThreatIntelligenceIntegrator.getReputation(sourceIP)
  apiSensitivity = ApiDefinition.getSensitivity(apiName)
  anomalousBehavior = UsagePatternAnalyzer.detectAnomaly(sourceIP, apiName, parameters)

  securityLevel = calculateSecurityLevel(sourceIPReputation, apiSensitivity, anomalousBehavior)

  if securityLevel == "high":
    // Trigger MFA, Inspect Payload, Strict Rate Limiting
    applyMFAPrompt(request)
    inspectPayload(request)
    rateLimit(request, "strict")
  elif securityLevel == "medium":
    // Moderate Rate Limiting, Basic Payload Inspection
    rateLimit(request, "moderate")
    basicPayloadInspection(request)
  else: // securityLevel == "low"
    // Allow Request
    allowRequest(request)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Security Profile:**  {apiName: String, sensitivity: Integer, rules: [Rule]}
*   **Rule:** {type: String (e.g., "rateLimit", "payloadInspection", "mfa"), parameters: {}}

**Interface:**  Administrators can define API sensitivity levels and customize security rules through a web-based UI.  The system provides real-time dashboards showing API usage patterns, security events, and system performance.
