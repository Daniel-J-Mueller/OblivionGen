## Dynamic Virtual Network "Stitching" & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network routing concept by enabling *dynamic* stitching of virtual networks *across* substrate network boundaries – and proactively allocate substrate resources *based on predicted traffic patterns within the stitched network*. This goes beyond simply routing *within* a virtual network; it allows for on-demand creation of complex, multi-virtual network topologies.

**Specs:**

**1. Stitching Protocol (SP):**

*   **Purpose:** Facilitates the discovery and connection of virtual networks residing on different substrate network segments.
*   **Mechanism:**  A lightweight, bidirectional protocol running on Route Managers (as defined in the provided patent). Uses a "Virtual Network ID" (VNID) for identification.
*   **Discovery:** Route Managers periodically broadcast "VNID Availability" messages.  Messages contain VNID, a list of accessible virtual components, and bandwidth capacity.
*   **Negotiation:**  When a Route Manager requires connectivity to a VNID it doesn’t recognize, it initiates a negotiation sequence.  This involves querying other Route Managers for a path to the target VNID, considering cost, latency, and bandwidth.
*   **Tunnel Establishment:** Once a path is identified, SP establishes a secure tunnel (e.g., VXLAN, GRE) between the involved Route Managers, creating a logical connection between the virtual networks.

**2. Predictive Resource Allocator (PRA):**

*   **Purpose:**  Proactively allocates substrate network resources (bandwidth, compute, storage) to accommodate predicted traffic within stitched virtual networks.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Historical Traffic Data:**  Collects traffic patterns within each virtual network.
    *   **Application Profiles:**  Identifies the types of applications running within each virtual network (e.g., video conferencing, database access).
    *   **User Behavior:**  Tracks user activity patterns to predict future demand.
    *   **Stitching Events:** PRA monitors the Stitching Protocol for the creation of new network connections.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:**  PRA employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict traffic demand within each virtual network and across stitched connections.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Based on the predicted demand, PRA dynamically allocates substrate resources using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles.  This may involve adjusting bandwidth allocation, spinning up additional virtual machines, or pre-provisioning storage.

**3. Adaptive Substrate Routing:**

*   **Integration with Claim 1:** Leverage existing substrate routing tables, but add a "Stitching Priority" field. Routes used for stitched connections are given higher priority.
*   **Dynamic Path Adjustment:** PRA continuously monitors the substrate network for congestion. If congestion is detected on a stitched path, it can dynamically reroute traffic using alternative paths, even if it means incurring a slightly higher cost.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Implement policies to control the quality of service (QoS) for stitched connections. For example, prioritize video conferencing traffic over email traffic.

**Pseudocode (PRA):**

```
function predictTraffic(VNID, timeWindow):
  historicalData = getHistoricalData(VNID)
  applicationProfiles = getApplicationProfiles(VNID)
  userBehavior = getUserBehavior(VNID)
  // Use time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM)
  predictedTraffic = forecast(historicalData, applicationProfiles, userBehavior, timeWindow)
  return predictedTraffic

function allocateResources(VNID, predictedTraffic):
  requiredBandwidth = predictedTraffic.bandwidth
  requiredCompute = predictedTraffic.compute
  requiredStorage = predictedTraffic.storage

  // Check resource availability on substrate network
  availableBandwidth = getAvailableBandwidth()
  availableCompute = getAvailableCompute()
  availableStorage = getAvailableStorage()

  if availableBandwidth < requiredBandwidth:
      // Trigger resource scaling (e.g., add bandwidth)
      scaleBandwidth(requiredBandwidth - availableBandwidth)
  if availableCompute < requiredCompute:
      // Spin up additional VMs
      spinUpVMs(requiredCompute - availableCompute)
  if availableStorage < requiredStorage:
      // Provision additional storage
      provisionStorage(requiredStorage - availableStorage)

  // Update substrate routing tables with new resource allocations
  updateRoutingTables()
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Flexibility:** Enables the creation of complex, on-demand virtual network topologies.
*   **Improved Performance:** Proactive resource allocation reduces latency and improves throughput.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Dynamic resource allocation ensures that resources are used efficiently.
*   **Scalability:** Enables virtual networks to scale seamlessly across multiple substrate network segments.
