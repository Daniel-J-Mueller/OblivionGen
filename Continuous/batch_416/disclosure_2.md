## Modular Sensory Node System - "Aura"

**Concept:** A distributed network of small, wirelessly connected sensory nodes integrated *within* the door itself, beyond just the doorbell location. These nodes gather environmental data and biometric information, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the immediate surroundings and the people interacting with the door. 

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Node Dimensions:** 1cm x 1cm x 0.5cm (approximate) – designed for flush mounting.
*   **Sensor Suite (per Node):**
    *   Microphone (directional, low-power)
    *   Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor
    *   Capacitive touch sensor (detects hand proximity/touch)
    *   Environmental sensor (temperature, humidity, ambient light)
    *   Sub-GHz Radio Transceiver (LoRa/Sigfox compatible)
*   **Central Hub:** Integrated into the existing doorbell/A/V component.  Handles data aggregation, processing, and external communication (WiFi/Cellular).
*   **Power:** Nodes powered by inductive charging from within the door frame, or miniature, replaceable coin-cell batteries (5+ year lifespan).
*   **Mounting:**  Nodes embedded within the door’s core during manufacturing, or retrofitted via small, drillable ports.  Nodes would be covered with a thin layer of the door's exterior material to ensure a seamless finish.

**Software/Firmware:**

*   **Node Firmware:** Minimalist, focused on sensor data acquisition and transmission.  Prioritizes low power consumption.
*   **Hub Firmware:**
    *   **Sensor Fusion:**  Algorithms to combine data from multiple nodes, improving accuracy and reducing false positives.
    *   **Biometric Signature Creation:**  Use capacitive touch data (hand shape, pressure) to create a basic biometric signature for authorized users.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify unusual activity (e.g., prolonged loitering, unusual sounds) and trigger alerts.
    *   **Event Logging:**  Record all sensor data and events for historical analysis.
    *   **API:**  Expose data and functionality to third-party applications (smart home systems, security services).

**Operation:**

1.  Multiple "Aura" nodes are distributed throughout the door’s surface.
2.  Nodes continuously monitor their local environment.
3.  When a person approaches the door, the network of nodes creates a 'sensing aura'.  
4.  PIR sensors detect initial movement.
5.  Capacitive touch sensors identify hand proximity and capture biometric data.
6.  Microphones capture audio.
7.  The Hub aggregates this data, processes it, and determines if the person is authorized.
8.  If authorized, the door unlocks or the A/V system activates.
9.  If unauthorized, an alert is sent to the homeowner.

**Possible Extensions:**

*   **Facial Recognition:**  Integrate a low-resolution camera into the Hub for basic facial recognition.
*   **Voice Recognition:**  Allow users to unlock the door using voice commands.
*   **Gesture Control:**  Recognize simple gestures to control the A/V system.
*   **Remote Monitoring:**  Allow homeowners to remotely monitor the activity around their door using a smartphone app.
*   **Integration with Smart Home Systems:**  Connect the system to other smart home devices (lights, alarms, etc.) to create a more comprehensive security solution.
