## Dynamic Query Expansion with Sentiment Analysis & Temporal Weighting

**Concept:** Instead of solely relying on co-occurrence frequencies of search terms, proactively expand queries based on the *sentiment* surrounding those terms *and* the *temporal trend* of that sentiment. This allows the system to suggest refinements that aren't just statistically common, but also reflect current events and nuanced user intent.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sentiment Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw search query string.
*   **Process:**
    *   Tokenize query into individual terms.
    *   For each term, query a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) to determine sentiment score (positive, negative, neutral).  Output a sentiment vector for the entire query.
    *   Categorize sentiment (e.g., strongly positive, mildly positive, neutral, mildly negative, strongly negative).
*   **Output:** Sentiment vector and categorized sentiment label for the query.

**2. Temporal Trend Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Individual query terms, specified time window (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days).
*   **Process:**
    *   Query a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) containing historical search volume data for each term.
    *   Calculate the rate of change of search volume for each term within the specified time window. (e.g. Percentage increase/decrease).
    *   Combine search volume rate of change with sentiment scores gathered from Sentiment Analysis.
*   **Output:** Temporal trend score for each term (positive, negative, neutral, stagnant).

**3. Dynamic Query Expansion Engine:**

*   **Input:** Original search query, sentiment analysis output, temporal trend analysis output.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Refinement Candidate Generation:**  Query a knowledge graph (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) based on the original query terms. Retrieve related terms (synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, etc.).
    *   **Scoring & Filtering:**
        *   **Sentiment Alignment:** Score candidate terms based on their semantic similarity to the original query and alignment with the original query’s sentiment.  If the original query is positive, favor candidate terms with positive sentiment.
        *   **Temporal Weighting:** Increase the score of candidate terms that are showing increasing search volume (positive trend) in the recent past. Discount terms with declining search volume.
        *   **Novelty Filter:** Prioritize candidate terms that haven’t been frequently suggested with this query or similar queries in the past.
    *   **Refinement Suggestion Generation:** Select the top N highest-scoring candidate terms.
*   **Output:** List of suggested query refinements (e.g., "original query + refinement candidate").

**4. User Interface Integration:**

*   Display suggested refinements as clickable links below the search box, ordered by their calculated score.
*   Include a small visual indicator (e.g., up/down arrow, color coding) to show the temporal trend of each suggested term.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateRefinements(query, timeWindow):
  sentimentVector = analyzeSentiment(query)
  temporalTrends = analyzeTemporalTrends(query, timeWindow)
  candidateTerms = getCandidateTermsFromKnowledgeGraph(query)
  scoredTerms = []

  for term in candidateTerms:
    sentimentScore = calculateSentimentAlignment(term, sentimentVector)
    temporalScore = calculateTemporalWeighting(term, temporalTrends)
    totalScore = sentimentScore + temporalScore
    scoredTerms.append((term, totalScore))

  scoredTerms.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  refinements = [term for term, score in scoredTerms[:N]]
  return refinements
```

**Data Storage Requirements:**

*   Time-series database for historical search volume data.
*   Knowledge graph for related term retrieval.
*   Pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
