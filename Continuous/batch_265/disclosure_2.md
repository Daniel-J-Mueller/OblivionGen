## Dynamic Acoustic Event Filtering for Reduced Hypothesis Space

**Concept:** Integrate real-time acoustic event detection into the speech recognition pipeline to dynamically prune hypotheses *before* full acoustic scoring. This anticipates likely non-speech segments and dramatically reduces computational load.

**Specification:**

**1. Acoustic Event Classifier:**

*   **Model:** Train a lightweight, real-time acoustic event classifier (AEC) on a dataset of common non-speech events (e.g., cough, laughter, background music, door slams, keyboard clicks). This can be a convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or similar features.  The model must be optimized for speed and low latency.
*   **Output:**  The AEC outputs a probability score for each defined acoustic event *per frame*.
*   **Thresholding:** A configurable threshold determines whether a frame is classified as a non-speech event.

**2. Hypothesis Pruning Logic:**

*   **Integration Point:**  Insert the AEC *after* feature extraction but *before* the acoustic model scoring phase.
*   **Pruning Criteria:**
    *   If a frame is classified as a non-speech event *with high confidence* (probability > threshold), temporarily suspend hypothesis expansion for that frame.  Instead of generating multiple potential word sequences, mark the frame as “non-speech likely” and proceed to the next frame.
    *   Introduce a “hold buffer.” A limited number of frames can be flagged as “non-speech likely” before forcing a re-evaluation of the pruning decision. This prevents excessively long pauses in speech recognition due to false positives.
    *   Implement a “recovery mechanism.” If the AEC consistently misclassifies speech as non-speech, the system will automatically revert to standard hypothesis expansion. This can be triggered by a statistical anomaly in the AEC output.
*   **Weighted Scoring:** When resuming hypothesis expansion, slightly down-weight the acoustic scores of hypotheses that were previously suspended during non-speech frames. This encourages the acoustic model to prioritize segments with stronger acoustic evidence.

**3. System Architecture:**

1.  **Audio Input:** Raw audio signal.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** MFCCs or similar.
3.  **Acoustic Event Classifier:** Real-time detection of non-speech events.
4.  **Hypothesis Pruning Module:**  Dynamically prunes hypotheses based on AEC output.
5.  **Acoustic Model:** Standard acoustic model scoring.
6.  **Language Model:** Standard language model scoring.
7.  **Output:** Recognized speech.

**Pseudocode:**

```
for each frame in audio:
  features = extract_features(frame)
  aec_output = aec.predict(features)
  if aec_output.max() > threshold:
    non_speech_event = aec_output.argmax()
    hypothesis_suspended = True
    hold_buffer.add(frame)
  else:
    hypothesis_suspended = False
    if hold_buffer.length() > 0:
      # Re-evaluate suspended hypotheses
      for suspended_frame in hold_buffer:
        # Process suspended frame
        # Apply acoustic and language model scoring
        hold_buffer.remove(suspended_frame)
    # Standard hypothesis expansion
    generate_hypotheses(frame)
    score_hypotheses(frame)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** The threshold for the AEC can be adjusted dynamically based on the acoustic environment and the characteristics of the audio signal.
*   **Event-Specific Pruning:** Different types of non-speech events may require different pruning strategies.
*   **Integration with Beam Search:** The pruning logic can be integrated directly into the beam search algorithm to further reduce the search space.
*   **Dataset creation:** A large dataset containing recordings with and without common non-speech events will need to be created and curated for model training.
