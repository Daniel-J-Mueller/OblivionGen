## Dynamic Content Refinement via Predictive Gaze Tracking & Micro-Interaction Mapping

**Concept:** Enhance user interest identification by incorporating predictive gaze tracking *combined* with real-time micro-interaction data (beyond clicks/copies/zooms) to infer granular content relevance. This goes beyond simply identifying *what* is viewed, to *how* it’s viewed, and *predicting* where attention will go next.

**Specs:**

1.  **Gaze Prediction Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time video feed from user’s webcam (optional - can be disabled/privacy focused).  Mouse movement data. Scroll data.
    *   **Processing:** Employ a lightweight AI model (trained on vast datasets of human visual attention patterns) to *predict* where the user’s gaze will likely land within a short timeframe (e.g., 200-500ms).  Model outputs a “heat map” of predicted gaze probability across the network page.
    *   **Output:**  Predicted gaze heat map.  Confidence score for each prediction.

2.  **Micro-Interaction Capture Module:**
    *   **Capture:** Record highly granular user interactions:
        *   **Dwell Time:** Precise time spent with cursor hovering over specific content elements.
        *   **Cursor Velocity/Acceleration:**  How quickly/abruptly the cursor moves across the page.
        *   **Micro-Scrolls:**  Extremely small scroll increments (e.g., less than 10 pixels).
        *   **Rapid Keypress Combinations:** Capture of rapid keypresses (indicating potential attempts to select/copy content without explicit highlighting).
    *   **Data Stream:** Time-stamped stream of micro-interaction events.

3.  **Fusion & Relevance Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Predicted gaze heat map, Micro-interaction data stream, Content item identifiers (from the patent's unique identifier system).
    *   **Processing:**
        *   **Weighted Scoring:** Assign weights to different data sources (gaze prediction, dwell time, cursor velocity, etc.).
        *   **Correlation Analysis:** Identify correlations between predicted gaze, actual gaze (derived from mouse position), and micro-interactions.
        *   **Relevance Score Calculation:** Calculate a dynamic relevance score for each content item, based on the weighted and correlated data.
    *   **Output:** Real-time relevance scores for each content item.

4.  **Dynamic Content Adjustment:**
    *   **Emphasis Mechanisms:**
        *   **Subtle Highlighting:**  Apply subtle visual cues (e.g., slightly increased font weight, background color shift) to content items with high relevance scores.
        *   **Content Reordering:** Dynamically reorder content items based on relevance, prioritizing those with the highest scores.
        *   **Content Expansion/Collapse:** Expand or collapse less relevant content sections to improve information density.
        *   **Micro-Animation:**  Employ short, subtle animations to draw attention to high-relevance content.
    *   **Personalization Profile:**  Aggregate relevance data over time to build a user-specific personalization profile. This profile can be used to proactively prioritize and tailor content.

**Pseudocode (Relevance Engine):**

```
function calculate_relevance_score(content_item_id, gaze_heatmap, micro_interactions):

    gaze_weight = 0.4
    interaction_weight = 0.6

    gaze_score = 0.0
    if content_item_id in gaze_heatmap:
        gaze_score = gaze_heatmap[content_item_id]

    interaction_score = 0.0
    for interaction in micro_interactions:
        if interaction.content_item_id == content_item_id:
            interaction_score += interaction.weight  // Interaction weight is pre-defined based on type

    relevance_score = (gaze_weight * gaze_score) + (interaction_weight * interaction_score)

    return relevance_score
```

**Novelty:** This concept goes beyond passively tracking user actions to *predicting* where attention will go. Combining predictive gaze tracking with detailed micro-interaction data provides a richer and more nuanced understanding of user interest, enabling a more dynamic and personalized content experience. The weighting system provides tunability for A/B testing.
