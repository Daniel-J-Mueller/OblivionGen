## Pedestal Scanner - Biofeedback Integration & Adaptive Scanning

**Concept:** Integrate biofeedback sensors into the pedestal scanner housing to dynamically adjust scanning parameters based on the user’s physiological state. The goal is to optimize scan quality *and* provide a more comfortable, less anxiety-inducing experience. This moves beyond simple data acquisition towards a user-centric, adaptive scanning system.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Galvanic Skin Response (GSR):** Integrated into the hand rests/touch points of the pedestal. Measures skin conductance to detect arousal/stress levels.
    *   **Photoplethysmography (PPG):** Small PPG sensors built into the hand rests to measure heart rate variability (HRV). Provides insight into autonomic nervous system activity.
    *   **Optional - Facial EMG:**  Small, non-invasive EMG sensors (possibly in a retractable 'hood' that descends during scanning) to detect subtle facial muscle tension indicative of stress or discomfort. This is optional due to potential user resistance.
*   **Data Processing Unit:** A small, embedded processor (e.g., ARM Cortex-M7) within the pedestal to handle real-time biofeedback data acquisition and analysis.
*   **Adaptive Scanning Parameters:**
    *   **Scan Speed:**  Decreased scan speed when high GSR or low HRV is detected, suggesting user anxiety. Increased speed when user is calm/relaxed.
    *   **Light Intensity:**  Adjustable LED illumination within the scanner housing. Lower intensity during high-stress periods.
    *   **Audio Feedback:**  Subtle, calming audio cues (e.g., binaural beats, nature sounds) initiated when stress is detected. Option to include guided breathing exercises.
    *   **Focus Area Adjustment:** *Advanced Feature:* Small, localized adjustments to the scan focus area based on involuntary pupil dilation (detectable via an integrated IR camera) – attempting to subtly follow the user's natural attention.
*   **Software Interface:**
    *   A simple calibration routine to establish baseline biofeedback levels for each user.
    *   Real-time display of biofeedback data (optional, for diagnostic/research purposes).
    *   Configurable sensitivity levels for adaptive scanning parameters.
*   **Power Requirements:** Standard AC power with an internal power supply.
*   **Housing Materials:** Existing pedestal scanner materials (ABS plastic, aluminum) with provisions for sensor integration and ventilation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Adaptive Scan Logic):**

```
// Initialize baseline biofeedback levels

loop:
    read GSR, HRV, (optional EMG)
    stressLevel = calculateStressLevel(GSR, HRV) // Algorithm to combine sensor data

    if stressLevel > threshold:
        scanSpeed = reduceScanSpeed(scanSpeed, reductionFactor)
        lightIntensity = reduceLightIntensity(lightIntensity, reductionFactor)
        playCalmingAudio()
    else:
        scanSpeed = increaseScanSpeed(scanSpeed, increaseFactor) //up to max speed
        lightIntensity = maintainLightIntensity()

    performScanStep(scanSpeed, lightIntensity)
```

**Potential Downstream Applications:**

*   Improved patient comfort during medical scanning procedures.
*   Enhanced security scanning with reduced anxiety for subjects.
*   Biometric authentication linked to emotional state.
*   Research into the correlation between physiological responses and scan data.
