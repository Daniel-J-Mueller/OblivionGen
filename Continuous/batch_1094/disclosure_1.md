**Adaptive Aerodynamic Surface with Integrated Micro-Heaters & Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Control**

**Concept:** Extend the hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface treatment concept beyond the probe’s internal channels and external surface. Integrate this with micro-heating elements and an adaptive external surface to actively manage airflow and prevent icing/water accumulation *around* the probe itself, not just within it. 

**Specs:**

*   **External Surface Material:** Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) composite with embedded micro-heaters. The SMP layer will form the outermost surface of the probe.
*   **Micro-Heater Density:** 50-100 heaters/cm². These heaters will be individually addressable.
*   **Surface Texture Control:**  Micro-structured surface with dynamic control over hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties. This will be achieved via microfluidic channels embedded *within* the SMP layer.  These channels will deliver a thin layer of a switching fluid (e.g., a dielectric fluid with tunable surface tension) to modulate surface wettability.
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Existing air data sensors integrated within the core of the probe assembly. 
*   **Control System:** Real-time data processing from existing air data sensors *and* additional dedicated environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, icing detection) to drive the micro-heater and microfluidic control systems. 
*   **Power Requirements:**  12V DC, 5-10W (estimated, depending on heater activation and microfluidic pumping requirements).
*   **Probe Geometry:**  Aerodynamically optimized profile with a variable cross-section to minimize drag and turbulence.

**Operation:**

1.  **Normal Operation:**  Probe maintains a baseline hydrophobic surface to shed water and minimize drag. Micro-heaters are off or at a low power setting for thermal stability.
2.  **Icing/Water Accumulation Detection:** Environmental sensors and airflow analysis detect the onset of icing or water accumulation around the probe.
3.  **Adaptive Response:**
    *   **Micro-heater Activation:**  Localized heating of the SMP surface to prevent ice formation or melt existing ice. The heating will be pulsed to reduce power consumption.
    *   **Surface Wettability Control:** Selective activation of microfluidic channels to create localized hydrophilic patches. These patches will encourage water to sheet off the probe surface rather than bead up, reducing drag and improving sensor accuracy. Areas prone to ice build-up will remain hydrophobic.
    *   **Aerodynamic Shape Adjustment:** The SMP material, when heated, can be programmed to slightly alter the probe's aerodynamic profile. This allows for dynamic adjustments to the airflow around the probe to further reduce drag and turbulence. 
4.  **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor sensor data and adjust heater/microfluidic/SMP parameters to maintain optimal performance in all weather conditions.

**Pseudocode (Control Logic):**

```
// Environmental Data
temp = readTemperature()
humidity = readHumidity()
iceDetected = readIceSensor()
airflow = readAirflowSensor()

// Calculate icing risk
icingRisk = calculateIcingRisk(temp, humidity, airflow)

// Control Logic
if (icingRisk > threshold) {
    activateMicroHeaters(localizedArea)
    setSurfaceWettability(localizedArea, hydrophilic)
} else {
    deactivateMicroHeaters(localizedArea)
    setSurfaceWettability(localizedArea, hydrophobic)
}

if (airflow > turbulenceThreshold) {
    adjustProbeShape(optimizedAerodynamicProfile)
}
