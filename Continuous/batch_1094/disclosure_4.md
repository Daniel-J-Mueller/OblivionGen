## Personalized Auditory Holography with Dynamic Pinna Morphing

**Concept:** Expand upon customized HRTFs by incorporating real-time, dynamic modification of a digital pinna model *during* audio playback. This creates a more convincing and personalized auditory experience, addressing the limitations of static HRTFs which don't account for subtle head movements or changes in pinna shape (e.g., due to muscle contractions, earbud pressure).

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Array:** Integrate an array of micro-sensors *within* circumaural headphones or a dedicated head-mounted unit. These sensors will track:
    *   Subtle head rotations (high-precision IMU - 9-axis accelerometer/gyroscope/magnetometer)
    *   Pinna deformation – miniature strain gauges or capacitive sensors strategically placed around the ear cup to detect minute changes in pinna shape.
    *   Muscle tension – EMG sensors (electromyography) near key auricular muscles to anticipate/detect intentional/unintentional ear movements.

2.  **Real-time Pinna Model:** A high-resolution, deformable 3D model of the user’s pinna (created via the patent's described 3D capture methods). This model isn’t static. It’s dynamically updated based on sensor data.

3.  **Morphing Algorithm:** A sophisticated algorithm that translates sensor data into realistic pinna deformations. This will require extensive training using biomechanical models and user-specific data. The algorithm should:
    *   Account for natural constraints on pinna movement (e.g., cartilage elasticity).
    *   Prioritize deformations that have the greatest impact on HRTF characteristics.
    *   Implement a smoothing filter to prevent jittery or unnatural movements.

4.  **Dynamic HRTF Calculation:**  The HRTF isn’t pre-calculated and stored. Instead, the core HRTF calculation *happens in real-time*, utilizing the *current* (deformed) pinna model. This creates a truly dynamic auditory experience.

5.  **Spatial Audio Engine:** A spatial audio engine that receives the dynamic HRTF and renders sound sources in 3D space. The engine should support:
    *   Object-based audio:  Sound sources are defined as individual objects with specific properties (position, velocity, etc.).
    *   Ray tracing:  Simulate the propagation of sound waves from sources to the listener’s ears, taking into account reflections, diffraction, and occlusion.
    *   Ambisonics or Vector Base Amplitude Panning (VBAP): Methods for efficient spatial audio rendering.

6.  **Calibration Procedure:**
    *   Initial 3D pinna scan.
    *   Sensor calibration - establish baseline sensor readings and ensure accuracy.
    *   Dynamic calibration - user performs a series of head movements and ear gestures while the system learns the relationship between sensor data and HRTF changes.

**Pseudocode (HRTF Update Loop):**

```
// Initialize 3D pinna model and sensor data
pinnaModel = loadPinnaModel();
sensorData = readSensorData();

while (audioPlaying) {
  sensorData = readSensorData();
  pinnaModel = updatePinnaModel(sensorData); // Apply deformation based on sensor data
  hrtf = calculateHRTF(pinnaModel, soundSourcePosition); // Recalculate HRTF
  applyHRTFToAudio(audioBuffer, hrtf); // Apply HRTF to audio buffer
  outputAudioBuffer();
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive VR/AR experiences
*   Realistic gaming audio
*   Teleconferencing and virtual meetings
*   Assistive listening devices (personalized sound shaping)
*   Advanced audio prosthetics
