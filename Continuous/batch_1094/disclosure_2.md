## Communal Profile-Activated Ambient Experiences

**Concept:** Expand the “communal profile” concept beyond messaging to control and synchronize ambient experiences within a household – lighting, soundscapes, temperature, scent diffusion – based on identified profile states and activity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Profile State Engine:**

*   **Input:** Data streams from:
    *   User device locations (Bluetooth, WiFi triangulation).
    *   Device activity (streaming music, watching video, initiating calls).
    *   Microphone input (voice activity, identified keywords – “movie night”, “reading”, “dinner”).
    *   Wearable sensor data (heart rate, activity level).
*   **Processing:** Utilize machine learning to infer user state: “Active”, “Relaxing”, “Entertaining”, “Sleeping”, “Away”.  Combine individual user states to generate a "Household State" (e.g., "Family Movie Night", "Individual Relaxation", "Empty House").
*   **Output:**  “Household State” and individual “User States” as variables accessible by the Ambient Control System.

**2. Ambient Control System:**

*   **Device Integration:** Control interfaces for:
    *   Smart lighting systems (Hue, LIFX).
    *   Smart thermostats (Nest, Ecobee).
    *   Smart speakers (Sonos, Google Home, Amazon Echo).
    *   Scent diffusers (Aromatherapy devices).
    *   Smart blinds/curtains.
*   **Experience Library:**  Pre-defined “experiences” linked to Household/User States:
    *   **“Movie Night”:** Dim lights, activate surround sound, set thermostat to comfortable temperature, subtle scent of popcorn (if available).
    *   **“Reading”:** Warm, focused lighting, quiet ambient soundscape (e.g., fireplace), moderate temperature.
    *   **“Family Dinner”:** Bright, inviting lighting, upbeat background music, comfortable temperature.
    *   **“Individual Relaxation”:**  Soft lighting, calming soundscape (e.g., nature sounds), adjusted temperature based on user preference.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Real-time adjustment of ambient elements based on:
    *   Detected activity (e.g., pausing a movie – dim lights further).
    *   User feedback (voice commands – “too bright”, “warmer”).
    *   Time of day (gradual lighting changes to mimic sunrise/sunset).
*   **Profile-Specific Customization:** Allow individual users to customize experiences associated with their profile.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Central Hub:** A dedicated device (or software running on existing hardware – smart speaker, NAS) to manage data processing and device control.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Utilize WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Z-Wave for communication with devices.
*   **Cloud Connectivity:** Optional cloud integration for remote control, software updates, and data analytics.

**Pseudocode (Example: “Movie Night” activation):**

```
FUNCTION ActivateMovieNight(UserProfiles)
  HouseholdState = "Movie Night"
  FOREACH UserProfile IN UserProfiles
    IF UserProfile.Location == "LivingRoom" THEN
      Dim Lights(UserProfile.AssociatedDevices, 20%) // Dim living room lights to 20%
      SetThermostat(UserProfile.AssociatedDevices, 22°C) // Set thermostat to 22°C
      PlaySoundscape(UserProfile.AssociatedDevices, "MovieTheme")
      IF UserProfile.Preferences.Scent == "Popcorn" THEN
        ActivateScentDiffuser(UserProfile.AssociatedDevices, "Popcorn")
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDFOREACH
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**  Extends the communal profile concept from communication to comprehensive ambient control, creating a more immersive and personalized home experience.  The system dynamically adjusts the environment based on inferred user states and preferences, going beyond simple rule-based automation. This creates an ‘experience’ around the communal profile.
