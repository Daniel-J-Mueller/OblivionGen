## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction & Spatial Audio Projection

**Concept:** Extend the image feed beyond static display. Utilize multiple electronic devices (cameras, depth sensors) to reconstruct a 3D scene in real-time, then project spatial audio cues tied to objects within that scene onto the user device. This effectively creates a localized, mixed reality experience *without* requiring a headset.

**Specifications:**

*   **Device Requirements:** User Device (smartphone/tablet), Network Device (central server/edge compute), Multiple Electronic Devices (Cameras with synchronized timecode – minimum 3, ideally 4-8; Depth sensors optional but preferred – Time of Flight or Structured Light); Network connectivity between all devices.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   *Scene Reconstruction Engine:* Running on Network Device. Accepts synchronized image/depth data from Electronic Devices. Employs SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques and photogrammetry to generate a point cloud representation of the scene.
    *   *Object Recognition & Tracking Module:* Integrated within Scene Reconstruction Engine. Identifies objects within the point cloud (furniture, people, pets, etc.). Assigns unique identifiers to each object and tracks its movement over time.
    *   *Spatial Audio Engine:* Running on User Device. Receives object ID, position, and velocity data from Network Device.  Uses Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) to simulate sound emanating from specific locations within the reconstructed scene.
    *   *User Interface (UI):* Overlay on User Device display.  Shows a rendered view of the reconstructed scene. Allows user to select objects for information or interaction.
*   **Data Flow:**

    1.  Electronic Devices capture synchronized image/depth data.
    2.  Data streams to Network Device.
    3.  Scene Reconstruction Engine processes data, creating a point cloud and identifying objects.
    4.  Object position/velocity data sent to User Device.
    5.  Spatial Audio Engine renders spatial audio cues based on object data.
    6.  User Device plays spatial audio through speakers/headphones.
    7.  User views reconstructed scene and interacts via UI.
*   **Pseudocode (Spatial Audio Engine):**

```pseudocode
function renderAudio(objectData):
    for each object in objectData:
        objectID = object.id
        objectPosition = object.position
        objectVelocity = object.velocity

        // Calculate distance and angle to listener (user)
        distance = calculateDistance(listenerPosition, objectPosition)
        angle = calculateAngle(listenerPosition, objectPosition)

        // Apply HRTF based on distance and angle
        hrTF = getHRTF(distance, angle)

        // Load audio sample associated with object ID
        audioSample = loadAudio(objectID)

        // Apply spatialization to audio sample using HRTF
        spatializedAudio = applyHRTF(audioSample, hrTF)

        // Play spatialized audio
        playAudio(spatializedAudio)
```

*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   *Occlusion Handling:*  Simulate sound occlusion based on objects within the reconstructed scene (sound blocked by a wall, muffled by furniture).
    *   *Environmental Effects:* Add reverberation, echo, and other environmental effects to enhance realism.
    *   *User Interaction:* Allow user to 'tap' on objects within the reconstructed scene to trigger actions or access information.
    *   *Multi-User Support:* Enable multiple users to share the same reconstructed scene and interact with each other.
    *   *Integration with Smart Home Devices:* Control smart home devices based on objects within the reconstructed scene (turn on lights when a person enters a room).
