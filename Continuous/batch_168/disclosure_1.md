## Adaptive Model Granularity via Segmented Residual Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the residual analysis beyond simply detecting a change *point*. Instead, dynamically adjust the granularity of the model’s adaptation based on the *distribution* of residuals across short-term segments of the time series, even *before* a definitive change point is identified. This allows for proactive, nuanced adaptation rather than reactive, wholesale model updates.

**Specs:**

*   **Segment Length:** Configurable parameter defining the length of each segment (e.g., 10, 30, 60 data points). Shorter segments offer finer granularity but are more susceptible to noise.
*   **Residual Distribution Metric:** Utilize a metric to characterize the residual distribution within each segment. Options include:
    *   Standard Deviation: Measures the spread of residuals.
    *   Skewness/Kurtosis: Identifies non-normal distributions.
    *   Entropy: Captures the randomness of residuals.
*   **Adaptation Thresholds:**  Define thresholds for the residual distribution metric. When a segment’s metric exceeds a threshold, a localized adaptation is triggered.  Multiple thresholds enable tiered adaptation levels.
*   **Localized Adaptation Methods:**
    *   **Weighted Averaging:** Apply a weighted average between the current model and a recently trained 'shadow' model focused on the segment's data. Weight determined by the exceedance of the adaptation threshold.
    *   **Segment-Specific Parameter Adjustment:** If the model has tunable parameters, adjust these parameters *only* for the current segment based on the segment's residuals.
    *   **Dynamic Feature Selection:** For models using feature engineering, temporarily deactivate or down-weight features that contribute heavily to high residuals within the segment.
*   **Model Blending:** Maintain multiple 'shadow' models, each trained on different recent segments. Blend these shadow models with the primary model, weighted by the segment’s residual distribution metric.
*   **Confidence Metric Integration:** Utilize the confidence metric of the fitting model as a weighting factor for adaptation thresholds. Lower confidence implies a more sensitive adaptation strategy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION AnalyzeTimeSeries(timeSeriesData, segmentLength, adaptationThresholds, confidenceMetric)

    segments = SplitTimeSeries(timeSeriesData, segmentLength)

    FOR EACH segment IN segments:

        residuals = CalculateResiduals(segment, currentModel)
        distributionMetric = CalculateDistributionMetric(residuals)

        IF distributionMetric > adaptationThresholds[0]:
            // Tier 1 Adaptation - Weighted Averaging
            shadowModel = TrainShadowModel(segment)
            newModel = (0.9 * currentModel) + (0.1 * shadowModel)

        ELSE IF distributionMetric > adaptationThresholds[1]:
            // Tier 2 Adaptation - Parameter Adjustment
            AdjustModelParameters(currentModel, segment, residuals)

        ELSE IF distributionMetric > adaptationThresholds[2]:
            // Tier 3 Adaptation - Feature Selection
            DisableProblematicFeatures(currentModel, segment, residuals)

        ENDIF

        currentModel = newModel //Update the current model.

    ENDFOR

    RETURN currentModel

ENDFUNCTION
```

**Rationale:** This expands beyond simply detecting a single change point. By continuously analyzing residual distributions across segments, the model can adapt proactively, even *before* a significant change is detected. This results in a more robust and responsive system capable of handling gradual or complex shifts in the time series. The tiered adaptation system allows for fine-grained control over the level of adaptation, minimizing disruption while maximizing performance.
