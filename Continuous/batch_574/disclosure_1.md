## Dynamic Service ‘DNA’ & Evolutionary Composition

**Concept:** Extend the composite service creation beyond static linking of existing services. Introduce a system where composite services possess a ‘DNA’ – a mutable set of parameters governing how constituent services interact *and* evolve over time.  This allows services to adapt to changing data patterns, user behavior, and even the performance characteristics of their components.

**Specs:**

1.  **‘DNA’ Representation:** The ‘DNA’ is a JSON-based configuration object.  Core elements:
    *   `service_map`:  Array defining the constituent services and their initial connection points (input/output parameter mappings).
    *   `weight_matrix`:  N x N matrix (N = number of constituent services).  Values 0-1 representing the relative contribution of each service’s output to the overall composite service’s result.  Initial values determined by the user or AI suggestion during composition.
    *   `adaptation_rules`: Array of rules specifying how the `weight_matrix` is adjusted.  Rules are triggered by monitoring data streams.
    *   `monitoring_streams`: List of data streams monitored for triggering adaptation rules. (e.g. response time of individual constituent services, data volume, error rates, user feedback scores).
    *   `mutation_rate`: Probability (0-1) that a random element of the `weight_matrix` is adjusted during each adaptation cycle. This controls the speed of evolution.

2.  **Adaptation Engine:**  A separate service responsible for monitoring streams, evaluating adaptation rules, and modifying the `weight_matrix`.
    *   **Rule Format:**  `IF <monitoring_stream> <operator> <threshold> THEN <weight_matrix_element> <adjustment_type> <adjustment_value>`.  Example: `IF service_A.responseTime > 200ms THEN weight_matrix[0][0] decrease 0.05`.
    *   **Adjustment Types:** `increase`, `decrease`, `set`, `randomize`.

3.  **Composite Service Runtime:** This runtime handles:
    *   Receiving input data.
    *   Routing data to constituent services based on the `service_map`.
    *   Aggregating outputs from constituent services using the `weight_matrix`.
    *   Reporting performance metrics (for the Adaptation Engine).

4.  **User Interface for ‘DNA’ Editing:** A visual editor allowing users to:
    *   Define the `service_map`.
    *   Create and edit adaptation rules.
    *   Visualize the `weight_matrix` and its changes over time.
    *   Simulate the composite service’s behavior with different ‘DNA’ configurations.

**Pseudocode (Adaptation Engine):**

```
LOOP:
  FOR each monitoring_stream:
    current_value = get_value(monitoring_stream)

  FOR each adaptation_rule:
    IF rule.condition(current_value):
      element = rule.target_element
      adjustment_type = rule.adjustment_type
      adjustment_value = rule.adjustment_value

      IF adjustment_type == "increase":
        weight_matrix[element] = min(1.0, weight_matrix[element] + adjustment_value)
      ELSE IF adjustment_type == "decrease":
        weight_matrix[element] = max(0.0, weight_matrix[element] - adjustment_value)
      ELSE IF adjustment_type == "set":
        weight_matrix[element] = adjustment_value
      ELSE IF adjustment_type == "randomize":
        weight_matrix[element] = random_float(0.0, 1.0)

  END LOOP

  report_weight_matrix_changes()
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static composition. It introduces the concept of ‘evolvable’ services, adapting to dynamic conditions and potentially optimizing performance over time.  The ‘DNA’ representation provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for controlling this evolution.
