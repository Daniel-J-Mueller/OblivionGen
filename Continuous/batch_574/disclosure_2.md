## Dynamic Staleness Weighting via User Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the staleness detection system by incorporating real-time user feedback to dynamically adjust the weighting of different staleness indicators (e.g., named entity recognition, paraphrasing detection, natural language inference) for each content item. This allows the system to learn user preferences and provide more relevant staleness assessments.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** User Feedback Integration Module (UFIM)
*   **Components:**
    *   **Staleness Indicator Weighting Engine (SIWE):** Responsible for managing and adjusting the weights assigned to each staleness indicator.
    *   **User Interaction Interface (UII):** Presents staleness highlights to the user and allows them to confirm or reject them as relevant. (Could be a simple “helpful/not helpful” button on each highlighted section.)
    *   **Feedback Storage:** Stores user feedback data (content item ID, highlighted section ID, feedback type (helpful/not helpful), timestamp).
    *   **Weight Adjustment Algorithm:** A machine learning algorithm (e.g., reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization) that utilizes feedback data to dynamically adjust the weights assigned to each staleness indicator.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Assessment:** The existing system analyzes a content item and generates staleness highlights.
2.  **User Presentation:** The content item with staleness highlights is presented to the user through the UII.
3.  **User Feedback:** The user reviews the highlights and provides feedback (helpful/not helpful) for each one.
4.  **Feedback Collection:** The UFIM collects the user feedback and stores it in the Feedback Storage.
5.  **Weight Adjustment:** The Weight Adjustment Algorithm analyzes the feedback data and adjusts the weights assigned to each staleness indicator.
6.  **Iterative Refinement:** Steps 2-5 are repeated for subsequent content items, allowing the system to continuously learn and improve its staleness assessments.

**Pseudocode (Weight Adjustment Algorithm - Reinforcement Learning Example):**

```
// Initialize weights for each indicator (e.g., NER, Paraphrase, NLI)
weights = [0.33, 0.33, 0.33]

for each user feedback:
    // Calculate reward based on feedback (helpful = +1, not helpful = -1)
    reward = feedback_value

    // Update weights using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning)
    for each indicator:
        Q_value = weights[indicator] + learning_rate * (reward - weights[indicator])
        weights[indicator] = Q_value

    // Normalize weights to sum to 1
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    for i in range(len(weights)):
        weights[i] = weights[i] / total_weight

// Use adjusted weights for subsequent staleness assessments
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Feedback Data:** `{content_id: string, section_id: string, feedback: "helpful" | "not helpful", timestamp: datetime}`
*   **Indicator Weights:** `[float, float, float]` (weights for NER, Paraphrase, NLI respectively)

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **User Profiles:** Tailor staleness weighting based on individual user preferences and expertise.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Consider the context of the content item (e.g., industry, topic) when adjusting weights.
*   **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different weight adjustment algorithms to optimize performance.
*   **Explainable AI:** Provide users with insights into why certain sections were highlighted as stale.
