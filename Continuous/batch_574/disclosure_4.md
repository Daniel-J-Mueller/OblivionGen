## Dynamic Network Persona Creation & Shifting

**Concept:** Extend the idea of dynamic address mapping to encompass not just *where* a node is, but *who* it is presenting as on the network. Allow a computing node to dynamically adopt and shift "network personas," altering its reported capabilities, security profiles, and even application access based on context. This is beyond simple address translation – it’s a full behavioral and identity shift.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition Language (PDL):** A structured language (JSON or YAML preferred) to define network personas. A persona includes:
    *   Virtual Network Addresses (as in the patent)
    *   Reported Operating System & Version
    *   Supported Protocols & Cipher Suites
    *   Application Access Control Lists (ACLs) – which applications/services the node *claims* to be able to access.
    *   Security Profile (e.g., Firewall rules, Intrusion Detection settings)
    *   “Trust Level” – a numerical score reflecting the assumed reliability of this persona.
*   **Persona Manager Module (PMM):**  Resides on the computing node.
    *   Loads and manages multiple persona definitions.
    *   Dynamically applies a persona based on context (see Context Engine).
    *   Intercepts network requests and modifies headers/payloads to reflect the active persona.
    *   Maintains a local persona cache for performance.
*   **Context Engine:**  Resides on both the node *and* potentially a central network controller.
    *   Gathers context data:
        *   User identity (if applicable)
        *   Application being used
        *   Network location (physical or virtual)
        *   Time of day
        *   Security posture of the client
    *   Applies configurable rules to determine the appropriate persona.  Rules could be simple (e.g., "If application is 'Financial', use persona 'SecureFinance'") or complex (using machine learning).
*   **Network Interception Proxy (NIP):**  Optional, but highly beneficial. Sits between the node and the network.
    *   Inspects network traffic.
    *   Verifies that the node is adhering to the declared persona (e.g., using the correct cipher suites).
    *   Can enforce persona switching if necessary.
*   **Central Persona Repository (CPR):**  Stores and manages persona definitions centrally.
    *   Allows administrators to create, update, and deploy personas.
    *   Provides a central source of truth for persona information.
    *   Supports versioning and auditing of personas.

**Pseudocode (PMM – Persona Application):**

```
function applyPersona(personaName) {
  persona = loadPersonaDefinition(personaName);
  setVirtualNetworkAddress(persona.virtualNetworkAddress);
  setReportedOS(persona.reportedOS);
  setSupportedProtocols(persona.supportedProtocols);
  setApplicationACL(persona.applicationACL);
  setSecurityProfile(persona.securityProfile);
  log("Persona '" + personaName + "' applied.");
}

function handleNetworkRequest(request) {
  currentPersona = determineCurrentPersona(); //Based on Context Engine
  if (currentPersona != previousPersona) {
    applyPersona(currentPersona);
    previousPersona = currentPersona;
  }
  modifyRequest(request, currentPersona); //Change headers, etc.
  sendRequest(request);
}
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Security Hardening:**  Present a minimal attack surface by only advertising the capabilities required for a specific application.
*   **Compliance:**  Enforce specific security profiles based on regulatory requirements.
*   **Application Compatibility:**  Emulate older operating systems or protocols to support legacy applications.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Experiment with different security profiles or application access control policies.
*   **Dynamic Threat Response:**  Adapt security profiles in response to detected threats.
