## Dynamic Regional Music ‘Ecosystem’ with Hyperlocal Influence

**Concept:** Expand the geographically-targeted music system beyond simply reflecting aggregate listening habits. Introduce a dynamic 'ecosystem' layer allowing for hyperlocal music influence—individual venues, events, and even *moving* sources of musical preference—to momentarily shift the regional playlist.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Modules:**

*   **Aggregate Listener Data:** (As per existing patent) - Collection of streamed music, purchases, radio play within defined geographic regions.
*   **Venue/Event Data Feeds:** API integration with ticketing platforms, event listings, and POS systems of music venues (bars, clubs, concert halls). This data captures *real-time* music requests, song plays, and artist preferences *at* these locations.
*   **Mobile Beacon/GPS ‘Influence’ Data:** A mobile application (optional user participation) collects anonymized music listening data *coupled with* precise location information (Bluetooth beacons or GPS).  This creates 'influence zones' – temporary, localized boosts to specific songs or artists in the regional playlist based on what people are actively listening to *right now* in a small area.  (E.g., a park where a busker is playing a particular style of music).
*   **Social Media Sentiment Analysis (Optional):** Track trending music topics and artists on social media platforms *within* the geographic region. (Low weighting initially).

**2. Playlist Generation Engine:**

*   **Baseline Regional Playlist:**  Generated as per existing patent - based on aggregate listening habits.
*   **Influence Layer:** 
    *   **Venue/Event Weighting:** Songs frequently played/requested at venues receive a temporary boost in the regional playlist. (Weighting factor adjustable).  Higher weighting for larger/more popular venues.
    *   **Mobile Influence Zones:**  Algorithm detects clusters of users listening to the same music within a small geographic area. This creates a temporary "influence zone" – songs within this zone receive a boost in the regional playlist *within a limited radius*.  Decay function to reduce influence over time/distance.
    *   **Social Media Boost:** (Optional) – Trending songs receive a small weighting boost.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The playlist is continuously updated (e.g., every 5-15 minutes) to reflect the combined influence of all data sources.
*   **Genre Balancing:**  Algorithm ensures a diverse playlist, preventing single genres from dominating due to localized influence.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Time of day, day of week, and weather data are incorporated to further refine playlist selection.

**3. Delivery System:**

*   **Terrestrial Radio:**  Existing AM/FM delivery infrastructure.
*   **Cellular Streaming:**  Dedicated app or integration with existing music streaming services.
*   **Vehicle Integration:** Direct integration with vehicle entertainment systems.

**4. Pseudocode (Playlist Generation Engine):**

```
function generatePlaylist(region, timeOfDay, weather):
    baselinePlaylist = generateBaselinePlaylist(region) // Based on aggregate data
    influenceLayer = {}

    // Venue/Event Influence
    for venue in getActiveVenues(region):
        songs = getRecentPlays(venue)
        for song in songs:
            influenceLayer[song] += venueWeight * songFrequency

    // Mobile Influence
    for influenceZone in getActiveInfluenceZones(region):
        for song in influenceZone.songs:
            influenceLayer[song] += zoneWeight * songFrequency * zoneDensity

    //Social Media Influence (optional)
    for trendingSong in getTrendingSongs(region):
        influenceLayer[trendingSong] += socialWeight

    // Combine Baseline & Influence
    finalPlaylist = baselinePlaylist.copy()
    for song, influence in influenceLayer.items():
        if song in finalPlaylist:
            finalPlaylist[song] += influence
        else:
            finalPlaylist[song] = influence

    //Normalize and sort playlist
    normalizedPlaylist = normalize(finalPlaylist)
    sortedPlaylist = sort(normalizedPlaylist)

    return sortedPlaylist
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Hyperlocal marketing - Targeted advertising based on real-time music preferences.
*   Event promotion - Increase awareness of local events through music.
*   Enhanced user experience - More relevant and engaging music for listeners.
*   Tourism - Promote local music and culture to visitors.
