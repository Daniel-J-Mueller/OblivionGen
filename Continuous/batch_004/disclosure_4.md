## Dynamic Access 'Bubbles' & Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend geographic policy beyond simple proximity and confidence levels to create dynamic, user-defined "access bubbles" layered with a reputation scoring system based on observed behavior within those bubbles.

**Specs:**

*   **Access Bubble Creation:** User interface allowing definition of geofenced areas ("bubbles") of varying sizes and shapes.  Users assign security levels (e.g., "Home", "Trusted Cafe", "Public") to each bubble.  Bubbles can be temporary (time-based) or permanent.
*   **Behavioral Monitoring within Bubbles:** System passively monitors user actions *within* defined bubbles (with explicit user consent and transparency). Tracked actions include:
    *   Transaction types (purchase amount, vendor).
    *   Data access requests (type of data, frequency).
    *   Authentication attempts (success/failure, method).
    *   App usage (category, duration).
*   **Reputation Scoring:**  Algorithm calculates a "trust score" for each bubble based on observed behavior.
    *   Positive actions (e.g., successful, low-risk transactions, accessing authorized data) increase the score.
    *   Negative actions (e.g., failed transactions, unauthorized data access, high-risk activity) decrease the score.
    *   Scoring weighted by bubble security level (higher security = stricter weighting).
*   **Dynamic Policy Adjustment:** System dynamically adjusts access policies *within* a bubble based on the current trust score.
    *   High score: Relaxed security (e.g., fewer authentication prompts, increased transaction limits).
    *   Low score: Increased security (e.g., multi-factor authentication required, limited access to sensitive data, transaction holds).
*   **'Behavioral Biometrics' Integration:** Incorporate behavioral biometrics (e.g., typing speed, mouse movements, touch patterns) *within* bubbles as an additional layer of authentication or fraud detection.
*    **'Proximity Scoring'**: Augment geographical proximity with 'social proximity'. If a user frequently co-locates with other authenticated users within a bubble, grant increased access.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function determineAccess(user, resource, location) {
  bubble = findBubbleForLocation(location)

  if (bubble == null) {
    // Default policy
    return applyDefaultPolicy(user, resource)
  }

  trustScore = getBubbleTrustScore(bubble)

  if (trustScore > thresholdHigh) {
    // Relaxed policy
    return allowAccess(user, resource, minimalAuthentication)
  } else if (trustScore < thresholdLow) {
    // Strict policy
    return requireMultiFactorAuthentication(user, resource)
  } else {
    // Intermediate policy
    return applyStandardPolicy(user, resource)
  }
}

function getBubbleTrustScore(bubble) {
  // Calculate score based on observed behavior within the bubble
  // using weighted averages of positive and negative actions
  return calculatedScore
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Location services (GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth beacons).
*   Secure data storage for behavioral data.
*   Machine learning engine for trust score calculation.
*   Real-time policy engine.
*   User-friendly interface for bubble creation and management.
