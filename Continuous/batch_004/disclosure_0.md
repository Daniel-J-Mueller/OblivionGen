## Personalized Recommendation "Echo" System

**Concept:** Extend the performance-based billing and recommendation weighting to incorporate a "recommendation echo" system. This allows for indirect performance attribution and a more nuanced understanding of recommendation influence, especially for complex user journeys or when multiple recommenders contribute to a single conversion.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Collection & Event Tracking:**

*   **Enhanced Event Data:** Beyond user selections/purchases directly attributable to a recommendation (as in the source patent), track a wider range of user interactions. This includes:
    *   Time spent viewing recommended items.
    *   Scrolling depth on recommendation lists.
    *   Items added to wishlists or “saved for later” lists after viewing a recommendation.
    *   Searches performed *after* viewing a recommendation (capture search terms).
    *   Clicks on related items/categories *after* viewing a recommendation.
*   **“Echo” Event Identification:** Implement a time-based “echo window”. If a user performs any of the above actions *within* this window (e.g., 24-72 hours) *after* viewing a recommendation, tag that action as an “echo event”.
*   **User Journey Mapping:** Build a system to map user journeys, connecting initial recommendations to subsequent actions, even if those actions don’t directly involve the originally recommended item. This requires a unique session ID or user identifier.

**II. Echo Weighting Algorithm:**

*   **Base Performance Metric:** Maintain the original performance metric based on direct conversions/selections.
*   **Echo Score Calculation:** Assign weights to different echo event types. For example:
    *   Direct Conversion: 100%
    *   Purchase of a related item: 30%
    *   Item added to wishlist: 10%
    *   Search for a related term: 5%
*   **Decay Function:** Implement a decay function within the echo window. The longer the time between the initial recommendation and the echo event, the lower the weight assigned. (e.g., Exponential decay).
*   **Echo Score Aggregation:** For each recommender, aggregate the weighted echo scores across all users and time periods.
*   **Combined Performance Metric:** Calculate a combined performance metric = (Direct Conversion Weight * Direct Conversion Score) + (Echo Weight * Echo Score).

**III. Recommender Weight Adjustment:**

*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Use the combined performance metric to dynamically adjust the weights assigned to different recommenders.
*   **Exploration/Exploitation Balancing:** Incorporate an exploration/exploitation mechanism. Occasionally give lower-weighted recommenders a chance to be featured more prominently to gather more data and assess their potential. (e.g., Epsilon-Greedy algorithm).
*   **Segment-Specific Weighting:** Allow for segment-specific weighting. Recommenders that perform well for specific user segments (e.g., based on demographics, interests) should be given higher weights for those segments.

**IV. Pseudocode (Weight Adjustment):**

```
// Input: recommender_id, direct_conversion_score, echo_score, segment_id
// Output: adjusted_weight

function adjust_recommender_weight(recommender_id, direct_conversion_score, echo_score, segment_id):
  // Define weights for direct conversion and echo score
  direct_conversion_weight = 0.7
  echo_weight = 0.3

  // Calculate combined performance score
  combined_score = (direct_conversion_weight * direct_conversion_score) + (echo_weight * echo_score)

  // Get segment-specific weight modifier (default = 1)
  segment_modifier = get_segment_modifier(recommender_id, segment_id)

  // Apply segment modifier
  weighted_score = combined_score * segment_modifier

  // Normalize weights across all recommenders for the segment
  adjusted_weight = normalize_weight(recommender_id, weighted_score)

  return adjusted_weight
```

**V. Infrastructure Considerations:**

*   **Real-time Data Processing:** Requires a real-time data processing pipeline to capture and analyze user interactions. (e.g., Kafka, Spark Streaming).
*   **Scalable Data Storage:** Requires a scalable data storage solution to store event data and performance metrics. (e.g., Cassandra, Hadoop).
*   **Machine Learning Platform:** Requires a machine learning platform to train and deploy the weight adjustment algorithms. (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
