## Temporal Anomaly Injection for Robust Model Training

**Concept:** The system currently focuses on predicting future values based on existing time series data. However, models can be brittle and fail catastrophically when encountering unexpected anomalies *during* the prediction window â€“ not just anomalies in the training data. This design proposes proactively injecting synthetic, temporally-aware anomalies into training data to force the learning algorithms to become robust to a wider range of unforeseen circumstances.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Anomaly Profile Library:** Develop a library of parameterized anomaly profiles. Examples:
    *   **Sudden Spike:** Amplitude, Duration, Decay Rate.
    *   **Gradual Drift:** Start Time, End Time, Magnitude, Direction.
    *   **Cyclical Distortion:** Frequency, Amplitude, Phase Shift.
    *   **Noise Injection:** Type (Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, etc.), Intensity.
    *   **Missing Data Blocks:** Duration, Frequency.
2.  **Temporal Placement Engine:** A module that determines *where* to inject anomalies within the training time series. Parameters:
    *   `Injection Rate`: Number of anomalies per unit of time.
    *   `Anomaly Density`: Distribution of anomalies (Uniform, Gaussian around critical points, etc.).
    *   `Temporal Context Sensitivity`: Ability to prioritize anomaly placement based on features of the time series (e.g., seasonal peaks, trend changes).
3.  **Synthetic Anomaly Generator:**  A module that takes an anomaly profile and temporal placement instructions to create a synthetic anomaly to overlay on the time series data.
4.  **Augmentation Pipeline Integration:** Integrate the anomaly injection process into the existing training data generation pipeline.  This should be configurable to control the intensity and frequency of anomaly injection.
5.  **Multi-Algorithm Assessment:** After training, algorithms will be assessed on their ability to handle injected anomalies on a separate validation set. Metrics: Prediction Accuracy *during* anomaly periods, Recovery Time after anomaly, False Alarm Rate.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Injection):**

```
FUNCTION InjectAnomalies(timeSeriesData, anomalyLibrary, injectionRate, temporalContextSensitivity):
  anomalies = []
  FOR EACH dataPoint IN timeSeriesData:
    IF RANDOM() < injectionRate:
      anomalyProfile = SELECT_ANOMALY_FROM(anomalyLibrary, temporalContextSensitivity, dataPoint) # Uses context to select appropriate anomaly
      anomaly = GENERATE_ANOMALY(anomalyProfile, dataPoint.timestamp)
      dataPoint.value = APPLY_ANOMALY(dataPoint.value, anomaly) # Overlays/injects anomaly
      anomalies.append(anomaly)
  RETURN timeSeriesData, anomalies
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Adversarial Anomaly Generation:**  Use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate anomalies that are specifically designed to fool the trained learning algorithms. This would drive more robust training.
*   **Anomaly Correlation:** Inject *correlated* anomalies across multiple time series. This would test the system's ability to handle complex, interconnected disruptions.
*    **Dynamic Injection:** Adjust the injection rate and anomaly profiles during training based on the algorithm's performance.  Increase the difficulty when the algorithm is performing well.
