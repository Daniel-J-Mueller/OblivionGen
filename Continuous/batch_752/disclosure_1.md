## Adaptive Resonance Wireless Mesh Node

**Concept:** A wireless connectivity device that physically reconfigures its antenna array based on signal strength and environmental conditions, maximizing connectivity and minimizing interference *without* complex signal processing. Inspired by the adaptable nature of biological systems, specifically the way plants orient toward light.

**Specifications:**

*   **Form Factor:** Roughly spherical, 10cm diameter.  Housing constructed of a durable, lightweight polymer composite.
*   **Antenna Array:**  Composed of 12 individually articulated, miniature phased array antenna elements. Each element is housed within a spherical joint allowing for 360-degree rotation and tilt.  Antenna elements use a frequency range of 2.4-5.8 GHz, covering common Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards.
*   **Actuation:** Each antenna element is driven by a micro-servo motor controlled by an onboard microcontroller (ESP32 or similar). Servos are high-precision, low-power consumption.
*   **Sensing:**
    *   **Signal Strength Mapping:**  Each antenna element periodically sweeps through 360 degrees, measuring received signal strength from all directions. This data is used to create a localized signal map.
    *   **Obstruction Detection:**  Miniature ultrasonic sensors embedded around the device detect nearby obstacles that may be blocking or reflecting signals.
    *   **Ambient Light Sensor:** Detects ambient light levels for potential correlation with signal interference (e.g., sunlight impacting certain frequencies).
*   **Control Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

Initialization:
    Calibrate Servos
    Initialize Signal Map (empty)

Main Loop:

    For Each Antenna Element:
        Sweep 360 degrees (horizontal and vertical)
        Record Signal Strength at each angle
        Update Signal Map with data
    
    Obstacle Detection:
        Scan for nearby obstacles.
        Record obstacle positions.

    Algorithm:
        Determine strongest signal direction based on Signal Map
        Adjust antenna element angles to maximize signal strength from that direction.
        If obstacle detected:
            Adjust antenna element angles to bypass the obstruction.
        If multiple strong signals detected:
            Implement a beamforming algorithm to prioritize the strongest signal.
        If signal strength consistently low:
            Initiate a more comprehensive 360-degree scan.

    Servo Adjustment:
        Smoothly adjust servo positions to avoid sudden movements.
        Limit servo movement range to prevent damage.

*   **Power:**  Powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.  Wireless charging capable.
*   **Connectivity:** Supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, and potentially Zigbee or Thread.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Housing:  Polycarbonate or ABS plastic
    *   Antenna Elements: Copper or aluminum
    *   Servos: Miniature DC motors with gearboxes
*   **Expansion:** Modular design allows for the addition of sensors or other functionality.

**Novelty:**  Existing wireless devices typically rely on complex signal processing to optimize connectivity. This design uses physical reconfiguration of the antenna array, mimicking biological adaptation. This approach may reduce computational load and improve energy efficiency, and may be less susceptible to certain types of interference. The physical movement adds a layer of robustness and adaptability that software-based solutions lack. The combination of signal mapping *and* physical antenna adjustment is key.
