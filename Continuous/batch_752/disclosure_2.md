## Dynamic Audio Scene Reconstruction & Spatial Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend the multi-device audio control to *reconstruct* an audio ‘scene’ based on device locations and user interaction, then ‘anchor’ that scene to physical space for persistent, localized audio experiences. Think beyond simple synchronized playback – create immersive, spatially aware audio environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Mapping & Scene Creation:** System dynamically maps device locations within a defined space (using onboard sensors - cameras, microphones, accelerometers - or external positioning systems). User initiates “Scene Creation” mode. During this mode, audio played on any device is tagged with spatial coordinates. System records these coordinates and audio data, building a ‘Scene Graph’ representing the spatial arrangement of sounds. This initial scene can be as simple as a single speaker or a complex arrangement.
*   **Scene Persistence & Anchoring:** User designates a ‘Spatial Anchor’ – a physical point in space (e.g., a specific table, a wall, a corner). The Scene Graph is then ‘anchored’ to this point. This involves continuously calibrating device positions relative to the anchor using sensor fusion (visual, inertial, audio triangulation). Data is stored locally on a central hub device or cloud service.
*   **Dynamic Audio Morphing:** System continuously monitors device positions and adjusts audio output in real-time to maintain the spatial integrity of the anchored scene. If a device is moved, the system morphs the audio – adjusting volume, panning, and equalization – to compensate and maintain the original sonic perspective. This should be seamless, even with significant device movement.
*   **Interactive Scene Control:** Users can interact with the anchored scene via voice commands or a dedicated app. Commands could include: “Boost the bass on the table speaker,” “Move the ambient sounds to the bookshelf,” “Add a bird chirp to the garden area,” or “Mute the kitchen speaker.” The system translates these commands into adjustments to the audio output on specific devices.
*   **Multi-User Spatial Audio:** System supports multiple users within the anchored scene. It utilizes head tracking (via headphones or mobile devices) to personalize the audio experience for each user. Each user hears the audio as if they are positioned within the anchored space.
*   **Scene Export/Import:** Users can export and import anchored scenes. This allows them to share audio environments with others or recreate them in different locations. Scene data should include device positions, audio settings, and interactive elements.

**Pseudocode (Scene Morphing):**

```
function morphScene(deviceMoved, newPosition):
  // deviceMoved: Device that has been moved
  // newPosition: New spatial coordinates of the device

  originalPosition = getOriginalPosition(deviceMoved) // From Scene Graph
  deltaX = newPosition.x - originalPosition.x
  deltaY = newPosition.y - originalPosition.y
  deltaZ = newPosition.z - originalPosition.z

  // Calculate volume adjustment based on distance change
  distanceOriginal = calculateDistance(userPosition, originalPosition)
  distanceNew = calculateDistance(userPosition, newPosition)
  volumeAdjustment = 20 * log10(distanceOriginal / distanceNew)  // dB

  // Calculate panning adjustment based on lateral movement
  panAdjustment = calculatePan(deltaY, deltaZ) // based on relative movement

  // Apply adjustments to audio output on the moved device
  setVolume(deviceMoved, getVolume(deviceMoved) + volumeAdjustment)
  setPan(deviceMoved, getPan(deviceMoved) + panAdjustment)

  // Recalculate audio output for other devices to maintain spatial coherence
  for each device in scene:
    adjustVolume(device, spatialCoherenceFactor * (distanceChangeBetweenDevices))
    adjustPan(device, spatialCoherenceFactor * (angleChangeBetweenDevices))

  updateSceneGraph(deviceMoved, newPosition) // store for future morphing
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Home Entertainment:** Create realistic soundscapes for movies, games, and music.
*   **Interactive Art Installations:**  Design audio experiences that respond to user movement and interaction.
*   **Personalized Audio Environments:** Create custom soundscapes for work, relaxation, or meditation.
*   **Location-Based Audio Guides:** Deliver audio content based on user location within a physical space.
*   **Accessibility Features:** Provide spatially aware audio cues for visually impaired individuals.
