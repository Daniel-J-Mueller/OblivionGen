## Dynamic Difficulty & Contextual Image Generation for CAPTCHAs

**Concept:** Shift from static image challenges to dynamically generated, contextually relevant CAPTCHAs that adjust difficulty based on user interaction and inferred cognitive load.

**Specs:**

**I. Core System – ‘Cogni-Challenge’**

*   **Input:** User interaction data (mouse movements, keystroke timings, dwell time on elements), device sensor data (ambient light, sound), and potentially, limited publicly available user profile data (e.g., language preference, geographic location – *with explicit user consent*).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Cognitive Load Estimation:** AI model (trained on a large dataset of human-computer interaction data) estimates user's current cognitive load. High load indicates potential bot or impaired user; low load suggests a likely human.
    *   **Contextual Image Selection/Generation:**
        *   Based on estimated cognitive load *and* inferred user context (e.g., recent search history, website content being accessed, time of day), select or *generate* a CAPTCHA image.
        *   Image generation uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on diverse image sets. The GAN can synthesize images with varying levels of complexity and incorporating contextual cues.  For example:
            *   User browsing a gardening website: Generate an image of slightly overgrown plants requiring identification.
            *   User attempting a financial transaction: Generate a complex, multi-layered visual puzzle.
            *   User with slow, deliberate mouse movements: Generate a simpler CAPTCHA with fewer elements.
    *   **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment:**  The system monitors user interaction *during* the CAPTCHA attempt.  If the user struggles (e.g., incorrect selections, long response times), the system *subtly* reduces the difficulty by simplifying the image or providing hints. Conversely, if the user completes the challenge quickly and accurately, the difficulty increases.
*   **Output:**  A dynamically generated CAPTCHA image presented to the user.

**II. Image Types & Complexity Levels:**

*   **Level 1: Basic Object Identification:** (Low Cognitive Load) Images of common objects with clear outlines. User selects the correct object from a small set.
*   **Level 2: Partially Obscured Objects:** (Medium Cognitive Load)  Images of objects partially hidden or blended with the background. Requires more focused attention.
*   **Level 3:  Contextual Visual Puzzles:** (High Cognitive Load) Images incorporating multiple objects and requiring the user to solve a simple visual puzzle (e.g., identify the missing piece, find the object that doesn't belong).  These puzzles should be relevant to the user’s inferred context.
*   **Level 4:  Artistic Distortion & Manipulation:** (Very High Cognitive Load) Images with distorted shapes, unusual perspectives, or abstract patterns. Requires significant cognitive effort to interpret.
*   **Level 5: Multi-modal CAPTCHAs:** Combining image recognition with an auditory component (e.g., identify the object shown in the image from a series of spoken words).

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_captcha(user_data, context_data):
  cognitive_load = estimate_cognitive_load(user_data)
  contextual_cue = extract_contextual_cue(context_data)

  if cognitive_load == "low" and contextual_cue == "complex":
    captcha_type = "level_4"
  elif cognitive_load == "medium" or contextual_cue == "moderate":
    captcha_type = "level_3"
  else:
    captcha_type = "level_2"

  image = generate_image(captcha_type, contextual_cue)  // Use GAN

  return image
```

**IV. Data Requirements:**

*   Large dataset of human-computer interaction data (mouse movements, keystroke timings, dwell times) labeled with cognitive load estimates.
*   Diverse image sets for GAN training.
*   Metadata associating image content with contextual cues (e.g., gardening, finance, travel).
