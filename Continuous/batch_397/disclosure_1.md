## Dynamic Credential Sharding & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Enhance credential verification reliability and security by dynamically sharding (splitting) a credential into multiple parts, distributing these parts across different network locations, and requiring the client to reconstruct the full credential before validation. This introduces a significant barrier to compromise, even if one or more shards are intercepted.

**Specs:**

*   **Shard Generation:** The server (credential issuer or validation service) divides the credential (e.g., X.509 certificate) into *n* equal-sized shards.  Sharding is cryptographic – each shard, individually, is meaningless without the others. A key derivation function (KDF) is used, seeded with a master secret, to generate unique encryption keys for each shard.
*   **Shard Distribution:** Each shard is hosted on a separate, geographically diverse server infrastructure.  These servers are independent of the primary validation server.  Shard locations are not static; they rotate periodically to further increase security.  Location information (URLs) is provided to the client via a secure, initially established channel (e.g. SSL/TLS).
*   **Client Reconstruction:** The client initiates a request for shards.  It downloads shards from multiple servers simultaneously.  A cryptographic reassembly process combines the shards.  The reassembly uses the KDF, seeded with a pre-shared secret (or a key derived from a user’s authentication credentials) to derive the correct decryption keys for each shard.
*   **Validation:**  Once the full credential is reconstructed, the client sends it to the validation server for standard validation procedures.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be resilient to shard server outages. Redundancy is achieved through replication of shards across multiple servers at each location.  The client should attempt to retrieve shards from multiple redundant locations.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function requestCredentialShards(credentialID) {
  shardLocations = getServerResponse(credentialID); //Get list of shard URLs
  shards = []
  for (location in shardLocations) {
    try{
        shard = downloadShard(location);
        shards.push(shard);
    }
    catch(e){
        //Handle shard download failure (retry, switch to redundant server)
    }
  }

  if(shards.length == shardCount){
    reconstructedCredential = reconstructCredential(shards, userSecret);
    validationResult = validateCredential(reconstructedCredential);
    return validationResult;
  } else {
    //Handle insufficient shards (error, retry)
  }
}

function reconstructCredential(shards, secret) {
  //Apply KDF with secret to derive decryption keys for each shard
  keys = kdf(secret, shardIDs);

  //Decrypt and combine shards
  decryptedShards = decryptShards(shards, keys);
  reconstructedCredential = combineShards(decryptedShards);
  return reconstructedCredential
}
```

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   A distributed network of shard servers.
*   A secure key management system for storing and managing the master secret and shard encryption keys.
*   A robust mechanism for tracking shard locations and ensuring shard availability.
*   Modified client-side software to handle shard retrieval and reconstruction.
