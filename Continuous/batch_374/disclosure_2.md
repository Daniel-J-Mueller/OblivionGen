## Decentralized Attestation Network with Dynamic Root of Trust

**Concept:** Expand the idea of cryptographic module configuration and authentication beyond a single resource management system and introduce a blockchain-based decentralized attestation network. This allows for dynamic root of trust validation and configuration drift detection across a fleet of devices, moving away from centralized control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Network Architecture:**

*   **Nodes:** Consist of:
    *   *Attestation Nodes:*  Devices performing attestation and configuration (similar to the ‘first computing device’ in the patent). These run a lightweight blockchain client.
    *   *Validator Nodes:* Maintain the blockchain and validate attestation records.  These nodes may be dedicated hardware or cloud instances.
    *   *Target Devices:*  Devices *with* the cryptographic module being attested (similar to the 'second computing device').
*   **Blockchain:** Permissioned blockchain utilizing a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism for speed and scalability.  PoA allows known and trusted validator nodes to create blocks.  The blockchain stores attestation records, configuration hashes, and device identities.
*   **Communication:** Secure communication between nodes established using TLS 1.3 with mutual authentication.

**2. Attestation Process:**

1.  **Initial Boot/Configuration Request:** Target Device initiates a configuration request via the network.
2.  **Attestation Request:** Attestation Node receives the request. It initiates an attestation process.
3.  **Cryptographic Challenge:** Attestation Node generates a random cryptographic challenge (nonce) and sends it to the Target Device.
4.  **Signed Attestation Data:** Target Device's cryptographic module signs the challenge along with its current configuration hash (including firmware version, software stack, and configured settings) using a private key securely stored within the module. This signed data is sent back to the Attestation Node.
5.  **Blockchain Recording:** The Attestation Node verifies the signature and the validity of the configuration hash.  If valid, it creates a new transaction on the blockchain recording the device’s identity, the signed attestation data, the configuration hash, and a timestamp.
6.  **Configuration Delivery:** Upon successful blockchain recording, the Attestation Node transmits the requested configuration data.

**3. Configuration Drift Detection:**

*   **Periodic Re-Attestation:**  Target Devices perform periodic re-attestation (configurable interval).
*   **Hash Comparison:** The Attestation Node compares the current configuration hash from the re-attestation with the previously recorded hash on the blockchain.
*   **Alerting:** If a mismatch is detected, an alert is triggered indicating potential configuration drift or tampering.  Automated remediation actions can be initiated (e.g., reverting to a known good configuration, isolating the device).

**4. Dynamic Root of Trust:**

*   **Root Key Rotation:** Validator Nodes can collectively rotate the root key used to sign validator node certificates, enhancing security.
*   **Certificate Authority (CA) Chain:**  The blockchain stores the CA chain for validator node certificates, ensuring trust and verifiability.
*   **Automated Key Management:** A distributed key management system (DKMS) is integrated for secure generation, storage, and rotation of cryptographic keys.

**5. Pseudocode - Attestation Node:**

```pseudocode
function AttestDevice(device_id, config_request):
  challenge = GenerateRandomChallenge()
  SendChallenge(device_id, challenge)
  signed_data = ReceiveSignedData(device_id)
  if VerifySignature(signed_data, device_id):
    config_hash = ExtractConfigHash(signed_data)
    blockchain_transaction = CreateBlockchainTransaction(device_id, config_hash, signed_data)
    if SubmitBlockchainTransaction(blockchain_transaction):
      DeliverConfiguration(device_id, config_request)
      return True
    else:
      // Blockchain submission failed
      return False
  else:
    // Signature verification failed
    return False

function DetectConfigurationDrift(device_id):
  current_config_hash = GetCurrentConfigHash(device_id)
  historical_config_hash = GetHistoricalConfigHashFromBlockchain(device_id)

  if current_config_hash != historical_config_hash:
    TriggerAlert("Configuration Drift Detected for Device " + device_id)
    InitiateRemediation(device_id)
```

**6. Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Sharding:** Blockchain sharding to distribute transaction processing across multiple validator nodes.
*   **Sidechains:** Utilize sidechains for less critical attestation data.
*   **Optimized Data Structures:** Efficient data structures for storing attestation records on the blockchain.
