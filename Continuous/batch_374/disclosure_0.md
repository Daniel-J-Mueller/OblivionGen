## Data Object 'Shadowing' & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the data storage system to proactively create 'shadow' copies of data objects *before* a retrieval request is even made, anticipating future access based on access patterns and metadata analysis. These shadows are versioned, lightweight, and stored on faster storage tiers.

**Specifications:**

*   **Metadata Enrichment:** Augment data object metadata with 'access propensity scores'. These scores are calculated based on historical access frequency, time since last access, associated user roles, and relationships with other data objects. Machine learning algorithms continuously refine these scores.
*   **Shadow Creation Trigger:** A daemon process monitors access propensity scores. When a score exceeds a configurable threshold, a 'shadow' copy of the data object is created. Shadow copies are differential â€“ only changed blocks are written, minimizing storage overhead.
*   **Storage Tiering:** Shadow copies are stored on a faster storage tier (e.g., NVMe SSDs) than the primary archival storage. A cost/benefit analysis determines the optimal number of shadow copies and storage tier.
*   **Retrieval Interception:** When a retrieval request arrives:
    1.  The system checks for a valid shadow copy.
    2.  If found, the retrieval is served from the shadow copy *immediately*.
    3.  If no shadow copy exists, the standard archival retrieval process is initiated.
*   **Background Synchronization:** A background process periodically synchronizes shadow copies with the primary archival storage, ensuring data consistency.
*   **Predictive Prefetching:** Leverage access patterns to *predict* future data object access. Before a request arrives, proactively fetch the data object to a faster storage tier. 
*   **'Warm-Up' Mechanism**: Initiate initial prefetch/shadow copy creation based on scheduled jobs/processes.

**Pseudocode (Retrieval Interception):**

```
function handle_retrieval_request(request):
  data_object_id = request.data_object_id
  
  shadow_copy = find_latest_shadow_copy(data_object_id)
  
  if shadow_copy != null and shadow_copy.is_valid():
    serve_from_shadow_copy(shadow_copy)
    update_access_propensity(data_object_id) #Increase score for shadow hit
  else:
    initiate_archival_retrieval(data_object_id)
    #Standard archival retrieval process
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AccessPropensity`: { `data_object_id`: `score`, `last_accessed`: `timestamp` }
*   `ShadowCopy`: { `data_object_id`: `object_id`, `version`: `int`, `storage_location`: `location`, `valid`: `boolean` }
*   `PrefetchQueue`: { `data_object_id`: `object_id`, `priority`: `int` }
