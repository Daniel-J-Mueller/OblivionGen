## Adaptive Synchronization Pulse Width Modulation for Prioritized Halt Propagation

**Specification:** Implement a system where the width of the synchronization pulses themselves are dynamically modulated to encode priority levels for halt indications. This builds on the existing synchronization pulse alignment but adds a layer of information *within* the pulse itself, enabling faster propagation of critical halts.

**Components:**

*   **Halt Priority Encoder:** A module within the system controller responsible for assigning priority levels to halt requests (e.g., critical error halts > background maintenance halts).
*   **Pulse Width Modulator (PWM):** Hardware within the pulse generator capable of precisely controlling the duration of each synchronization pulse.
*   **Decoding Circuitry:** Integrated into each IC device, capable of detecting the pulse width and interpreting it as a priority level.
*   **Priority-Based Halt Handler:** Logic within each IC device that adjusts its response to halt indications based on the decoded priority. Lower priority halts can be buffered or delayed without impacting system responsiveness, while critical halts trigger immediate action.

**Operation:**

1.  **Halt Request:** When a halt request originates, the Halt Priority Encoder assigns a priority level.
2.  **PWM Control:** The system controller instructs the Pulse Generator to modulate the width of the *next* synchronization pulse according to the assigned priority. A predefined mapping connects priority levels to pulse width ranges.
3.  **Pulse Transmission:** The modulated synchronization pulse is transmitted across the system.
4.  **Decoding:** Each IC deviceâ€™s Decoding Circuitry measures the pulse width and determines the priority level.
5.  **Halt Handling:**  Based on the priority, the IC device adjusts its halt response.
    *   **High Priority:** Immediate halt implementation.
    *   **Medium Priority:** Halt request queued for processing after current operations complete.
    *   **Low Priority:** Halt request buffered or delayed significantly.

**Pseudocode (Decoding Circuitry):**

```
function decodePulseWidth(pulseWidth) {
  if (pulseWidth > HIGH_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD) {
    priority = HIGH;
  } else if (pulseWidth > MEDIUM_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD) {
    priority = MEDIUM;
  } else {
    priority = LOW;
  }
  return priority;
}
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Pulse Width Range:** Define a precise range of allowable pulse widths to avoid ambiguity.
*   **Synchronization:** Maintain accurate timing to ensure reliable pulse width measurement.
*   **Noise Tolerance:** Implement filtering or error correction to mitigate the effects of noise.
*   **Scalability:** Ensure the system remains effective with a large number of IC devices.
