## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System – “SenseShift”

**Core Concept:** Extend orientation-based functional shifting beyond audio/visual controls to encompass nuanced haptic feedback profiles, creating a fully immersive and contextually aware user experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution haptic array integrated into device chassis (bezels, back panel, potentially even screen surface).  Array density: minimum 50 actuators per 100mm<sup>2</sup>.  Actuator type:  Piezoelectric or micro-electromagnetic.
    *   9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer – for precise orientation tracking. Sampling rate: 200Hz minimum.
    *   Dedicated haptic processing unit (HPU) – co-processor optimized for real-time haptic waveform generation and rendering.
    *   Pressure sensors integrated within grip zones (if applicable – phone, controller etc) to modulate haptic intensity based on user grip strength.
*   **Software:**
    *   *Orientation Engine:* Monitors device orientation via IMU data. Defines key orientation thresholds (0°, 90°, 180°, 270° and intermediate values) and associated haptic profiles.
    *   *Haptic Profile Database:* Contains pre-defined haptic textures and patterns categorized by application and orientation.  Examples:
        *   *Gaming:*  In landscape mode, textures simulate weapon recoil or environmental effects (rain, wind). In portrait mode, textures emphasize character movement and UI feedback.
        *   *Navigation:* Landscape mode provides directional rumble aligned with turn instructions. Portrait mode focuses on subtle pulses indicating upcoming turns.
        *   *Media Consumption:* Landscape mode creates wider, more immersive soundstage simulation. Portrait mode emphasizes vocal clarity.
    *   *Adaptive Haptic Rendering:*  Dynamically adjusts haptic intensity and pattern based on user interaction, application context, and device orientation.
    *   *Haptic Scripting API:* Allows developers to create custom haptic experiences and integrate them into their applications.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
While (Device is ON) {
    OrientationData = GetOrientation();
    CurrentOrientation = DetermineOrientation(OrientationData);
    ApplicationContext = GetCurrentApplication();

    HapticProfile = SelectHapticProfile(CurrentOrientation, ApplicationContext);

    // Grip Strength Modulation
    GripStrength = ReadGripSensors();
    HapticIntensity = CalculateHapticIntensity(HapticProfile.BaseIntensity, GripStrength);

    // Render Haptics
    RenderHapticPattern(HapticProfile.Pattern, HapticIntensity);

    Delay(16ms); // ~60Hz update rate
}

// Function: SelectHapticProfile
Function SelectHapticProfile(Orientation, Application) {
    If (Application == "Gaming" AND Orientation == "Landscape") {
        Return GamingLandscapeProfile;
    } Else If (Application == "Navigation" AND Orientation == "Portrait") {
        Return NavigationPortraitProfile;
    } Else {
        Return DefaultProfile;
    }
}
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

The existing patent focuses on *functional* shifting of controls. This expands the concept to the *sensory* realm, leveraging haptics for a significantly more immersive and intuitive user experience.  Rather than simply swapping control functions, we are adapting *how* the user feels the device, creating a sense of contextual awareness that goes beyond visual and auditory cues. This could unlock new possibilities in gaming, accessibility, and human-computer interaction.
