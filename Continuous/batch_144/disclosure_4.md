## Dynamic Network Topology Reconstruction via Transient Signal Analysis

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Instead of focusing solely on packet loss *rates* as indicators of failure, this system proposes a method for dynamically reconstructing the active network topology by analyzing transient signal characteristics – specifically, subtle timing variations *within* successful packets. These variations, currently discarded as noise, can reveal ‘shadow paths’ or alternate routing attempts the network is making *before* a complete failure manifests as packet loss. 

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **High-Resolution Timestamping:** Network interface cards (NICs) capable of sub-nanosecond timestamping of individual packets. Existing Precision Time Protocol (PTP) infrastructure can be leveraged, but enhanced resolution is crucial.
*   **Dedicated Processing Cores:**  Several dedicated CPU cores or a small FPGA dedicated to real-time analysis of timestamp streams.
*   **High-Bandwidth Network Taps:** Non-intrusive network taps at strategic locations within the network to capture full packet streams.
*   **Storage:** Sufficient high-speed storage (NVMe SSDs) to buffer timestamp data for short-term analysis.

**III. Software Components:**

*   **Timestamp Collector:** Captures timestamp data from network taps and streams it to the analysis engine.  Must support multiple streams concurrently.
*   **Transient Signal Analyzer:**  The core component. Implements algorithms to:
    *   **Baseline Establishment:** Creates a dynamic baseline of expected packet transit times for each node pair based on historical data.
    *   **Deviation Detection:** Identifies deviations from the baseline.  Critical:  distinguishes between normal jitter and potential topology shifts. Utilizes statistical methods like Kalman filtering or anomaly detection algorithms.
    *   **Path Inference Engine:**  This component is responsible for inferring potential alternate paths. When a significant deviation is detected, the engine models possible routing changes based on the network topology and known routing protocols.
    *   **Topology Reconstruction Module:** Builds a dynamic model of the network topology based on inferred path changes. This module maintains a graph representation of the network, updating it in real-time.
*   **Correlation Engine:** Correlates topology changes with customer impact. Identifies which customers are affected by potential path deviations.
*   **Alerting & Visualization Module:** Provides real-time visualization of the reconstructed topology and alerts operators to potential issues.

**IV. Algorithm – Transient Signature Creation & Comparison:**

1.  **Signature Creation:** For each packet traversing a known path (established during baseline learning), create a “Transient Signature” (TS). This TS isn't a simple timestamp. It’s a vector representing the time difference between successive internal events *within* the packet’s processing – e.g., the time between header parsing and payload processing at each hop. These internal timings are much more sensitive to subtle path changes than overall transit time.
2.  **Baseline TS Library:** Build a library of average TS for each path.
3.  **Real-time Comparison:** When a packet arrives, extract its TS.  Compare it to the baseline using a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. DTW is crucial as it allows for slight variations in timing due to normal network jitter.
4.  **Deviation Threshold:**  If the DTW distance exceeds a threshold, flag a potential topology shift.
5.  **Path Inference:** The algorithm attempts to identify alternate paths that could explain the observed TS. It uses graph theory to model the network topology and finds paths that minimize the difference between the observed TS and the expected TS.

**V. Pseudocode – Path Inference Engine:**

```pseudocode
function inferPath(observedTS, currentTopology, nodeA, nodeB):
  candidatePaths = findPossiblePaths(currentTopology, nodeA, nodeB)
  bestPath = null
  minDistance = infinity

  for path in candidatePaths:
    predictedTS = calculatePredictedTS(path) // Based on known path characteristics
    distance = DTW(predictedTS, observedTS)

    if distance < minDistance:
      minDistance = distance
      bestPath = path

  if bestPath != null:
    return bestPath
  else:
    // No suitable path found - potential new link or major topology change
    return "UNKNOWN"
```

**VI. Potential Applications:**

*   **Proactive Failure Detection:** Identify potential failures *before* they manifest as packet loss, allowing for preemptive action.
*   **Dynamic Routing Optimization:** Improve routing decisions by leveraging real-time topology information.
*   **Network Security Enhancement:** Detect unauthorized routing changes or potential attacks.
*   **Automated Network Repair:** Trigger automated network repair mechanisms based on topology changes.
