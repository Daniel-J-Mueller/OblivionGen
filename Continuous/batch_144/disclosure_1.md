**Dynamic Merchant Bundling & Gamified Area Activation**

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of incentivized merchant recruitment by introducing dynamic bundling of merchants based on customer proximity, purchase history, and predicted needs, coupled with a gamified area activation system.

**Specifications:**

**I. Dynamic Merchant Bundling Engine**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time customer location (opt-in).
    *   Customer purchase history (within the delivery service).
    *   Merchant category & inventory data.
    *   Time of day, day of week.
    *   Local events/promotions data (integrated API).
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Proximity Filter:** Identify merchants within a defined radius of the customer (adjustable).
    2.  **Affinity Scoring:** Calculate an “affinity score” based on:
        *   Purchase history match (weight: 60%).
        *   Category preference (weight: 30%).
        *   Current promotions/events (weight: 10%).
    3.  **Bundle Creation:** Create “bundles” of 3-5 merchants with high affinity scores. Bundles are dynamically updated based on real-time data.
    4.  **Bundle Presentation:** Present bundles to the customer via the app, highlighting potential savings or convenience. “Try all merchants in this bundle and get X% off your next order”.
*   **API Integrations:**
    *   Location Services (Google Maps, Apple Maps).
    *   Payment Gateway.
    *   Merchant Inventory Management Systems.

**II. Gamified Area Activation – "Neighborhood Boost"**

*   **Mechanism:**  Transform area activation into a collaborative game.
*   **Levels:** Areas are divided into "levels" based on merchant density and customer participation.
*   **User Roles:**
    *   **Recruiters:** Customers who successfully recruit merchants (using the existing system).  Earn points & badges.
    *   **Activators:** Customers who place orders from newly activated merchants.  Earn bonus points.
    *   **Neighborhood Champions:** Top recruiters & activators in a specific area. Receive exclusive perks (e.g., free delivery, priority support).
*   **Points System:**
    *   Recruiting a merchant: 100 points.
    *   Activating a merchant (first order): 50 points.
    *   Each subsequent order from that merchant: 10 points.
*   **Badges:**  Award badges for reaching milestones (e.g., "Bronze Recruiter", "Neighborhood Hero").
*   **Leaderboard:** Display a leaderboard for each area, ranking users by points.
*   **Area-Specific Rewards:**  Unlock collective rewards for the entire area when a certain point threshold is reached (e.g., free delivery for a day, a special promotion from all participating merchants).
*   **Progression Display:**  Visually represent area activation progress in the app (e.g., a map filling up with color as more merchants join).

**III. Pseudocode - Dynamic Bundle Recommendation**

```
FUNCTION recommend_bundles(customer_id):
  customer_location = get_current_location(customer_id)
  customer_history = get_purchase_history(customer_id)
  nearby_merchants = get_nearby_merchants(customer_location)

  FOR each merchant IN nearby_merchants:
    affinity_score = calculate_affinity_score(merchant, customer_history)
    merchant.affinity_score = affinity_score

  SORT nearby_merchants BY affinity_score DESC

  bundle = []
  FOR i FROM 0 TO MIN(5, LENGTH(nearby_merchants)):
    bundle.append(nearby_merchants[i])

  RETURN bundle
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculate_affinity_score(merchant, customer_history):
  purchase_match_score = calculate_purchase_match_score(merchant, customer_history)  // Based on category overlap
  category_preference_score = calculate_category_preference_score(merchant, customer_history) // Based on overall history
  promotion_score = get_promotion_score(merchant) // Based on current promotions

  affinity_score = (purchase_match_score * 0.6) + (category_preference_score * 0.3) + (promotion_score * 0.1)

  RETURN affinity_score
END FUNCTION
```

This system enhances area activation by creating a more engaging and rewarding experience for both customers and merchants. The dynamic bundling engine increases order volume and encourages customers to try new businesses. The gamified system fosters community involvement and incentivizes continued participation.
