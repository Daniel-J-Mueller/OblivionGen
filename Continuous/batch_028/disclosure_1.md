## Dynamic VRF Assignment via Beaconing

**Specification:** A system for dynamically assigning VRF domains to network devices based on beacon signals. This extends the concept of static MAC-to-VRF mapping by introducing a mechanism for devices to *request* or *advertise* their preferred VRF.

**Components:**

*   **Beaconing Agent:** Software/firmware running on end devices (e.g., servers, IoT devices). Responsible for emitting beacon signals. Beacon signals include a VRF preference identifier.
*   **Beacon Listener:** Integrated into the VRF router (as described in the provided patent). Captures beacon signals from nearby devices.
*   **Dynamic MAC-to-VRF Table:** An extension to the existing MAC-to-VRF table, allowing entries to be dynamically added, modified, or removed based on beacon signals.
*   **VRF Preference Identifier:** A unique identifier representing a specific VRF domain. Could be a VLAN ID, a VRF name, or a custom identifier.
*   **Timeout Mechanism:** A timer associated with dynamic MAC-to-VRF entries. If a beacon signal is not received from a device within the timeout period, the entry is removed (or reverts to a default VRF).

**Operation:**

1.  **Beacon Emission:** A device, upon boot or when its VRF requirement changes, emits a beacon signal containing its VRF preference identifier. This beacon can be transmitted via a dedicated beacon protocol (e.g., a low-power radio signal) or piggybacked onto existing network traffic (e.g., as an option in DHCP requests or LLDP advertisements).

2.  **Beacon Capture:** The Beacon Listener on the VRF router captures beacon signals from nearby devices.

3.  **Dynamic Table Update:** The Beacon Listener analyzes the beacon signal and updates the Dynamic MAC-to-VRF Table. If the deviceâ€™s MAC address is not already present, a new entry is created. If an entry exists, it is updated with the new VRF preference.

4.  **Packet Processing:** When the router receives a packet, it first checks if the source MAC address is in the Dynamic MAC-to-VRF Table. If it is, the packet is routed according to the associated VRF. If not, the router falls back to the static MAC-to-VRF table or a default VRF.

5.  **Timeout and Removal:** The router maintains a timeout timer for each dynamic entry. If a beacon signal is not received from a device within the timeout period, the entry is removed from the Dynamic MAC-to-VRF Table.

**Pseudocode (Beacon Listener):**

```
function processBeacon(beaconSignal) {
  macAddress = beaconSignal.macAddress
  vrfPreference = beaconSignal.vrfPreference

  if (dynamicMacToVrfTable.contains(macAddress)) {
    dynamicMacToVrfTable.update(macAddress, vrfPreference)
    resetTimeoutTimer(macAddress)
  } else {
    dynamicMacToVrfTable.add(macAddress, vrfPreference)
    startTimeoutTimer(macAddress)
  }
}

function timeoutTimerExpired(macAddress) {
  dynamicMacToVrfTable.remove(macAddress)
  // Optionally, log the event or take other actions
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **BYOD Networks:** Allows users to bring their own devices and automatically be assigned to the appropriate VRF based on their device settings.
*   **IoT Deployments:** Enables flexible VRF assignment for IoT devices, allowing for easy segmentation and security.
*   **Mobile Networks:** Supports seamless VRF switching for mobile devices as they move between different networks.
*   **Dynamic Segmentation:** Enables automated network segmentation based on device roles or security policies.
