## Wireless Sensory Hub with Predictive Alerting

**Concept:** Expand the USB dongleâ€™s functionality beyond doorbell alerts to become a localized, learning sensory hub capable of predictive alerting based on environmental data and user behavior.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Hardware:**
    *   USB 3.0 Interface for power and data.
    *   Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53 processor @ 1.8GHz
    *   2GB LPDDR4 RAM
    *   16GB eMMC Flash Storage
    *   Integrated Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (dual-band 2.4/5 GHz)
    *   Bluetooth 5.2
    *   Zigbee 3.0
*   **Sensory Suite (Modular - expandability via USB/Wireless):**
    *   **Microphone Array (4-element):** Directional audio capture for voice commands, sound event detection (glass break, baby cry, etc.).
    *   **Passive Infrared (PIR) Motion Sensor:** Standard motion detection.
    *   **Temperature/Humidity Sensor:** Environmental monitoring.
    *   **Air Quality Sensor (VOC, CO2):** Measures volatile organic compounds and carbon dioxide levels.
    *   **Light Sensor:** Ambient light level detection.
    *   **Vibration Sensor:** Detects structural vibrations (potential intrusion, appliance malfunction).
*   **LED Indicator:** RGB LED for status indication (alert level, connection status, activity).
*   **Power:** USB-powered. Optional internal rechargeable battery for limited backup operation.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Linux-based operating system.
    *   Machine learning models for anomaly detection and predictive alerting.
    *   API for integration with smart home platforms (IFTTT, Alexa, Google Assistant).
    *   Local data storage and processing (privacy-focused).
    *   Secure over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates.

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
Connect to Wi-Fi
Initialize Sensors
Load ML Models (Anomaly Detection, Predictive Alerting)
Establish Secure Connection to Cloud (Optional - Data Backup/Remote Access)

// Main Loop
While (Running) {
    // Read Sensor Data
    sensorData = ReadAllSensors()

    // Process Data
    processedData = PreprocessData(sensorData)

    // Anomaly Detection
    anomalyScore = AnomalyDetectionModel.Predict(processedData)

    // Predictive Alerting
    predictedEvent = PredictiveAlertingModel.Predict(processedData, historicalData)

    // Alert Triggering
    If (anomalyScore > threshold OR predictedEvent.probability > threshold) {
        alertType = DetermineAlertType(anomalyScore, predictedEvent)
        TriggerAlert(alertType) // LED, Sound, Cloud Notification
        LogEvent(alertType, sensorData)
    }

    // Historical Data Logging
    LogHistoricalData(sensorData)

    // ML Model Retraining (Periodic)
    If (TimeSinceLastRetrain > threshold) {
        RetrainMLModels(historicalData)
    }

    Sleep(100ms)
}
```

**Alerting Modes:**

*   **Basic:** LED flash, audible tone.
*   **Contextual:** Based on sensor data and learned user behavior. Example: If the system learns you typically open a window at 7 AM, and the temperature drops rapidly overnight, it might proactively suggest closing the window.
*   **Predictive:** Based on pattern recognition and forecasting. Example: If the system detects subtle vibrations indicative of a potential water leak, it might alert you *before* visible damage occurs.

**Expandability:**

*   USB ports for connecting external sensors (e.g., carbon monoxide detector, smoke detector).
*   Wireless connectivity (Zigbee, Z-Wave) for integrating with other smart home devices.
*   Open API for developers to create custom integrations and applications.
