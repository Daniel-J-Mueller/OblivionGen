## Network Behavioral Fingerprinting via Correlated Loss & Rate Anomaly Detection

**System Overview:**

This system moves beyond simply *estimating* traffic loss and demand. It aims to create a real-time “behavioral fingerprint” for network devices and application flows by analyzing correlated anomalies in packet transmission rates and loss rates. This fingerprint can be used for proactive security, performance optimization, and application-level anomaly detection.

**Core Components:**

1.  **High-Resolution Data Collection:** Network taps or SPAN ports capture packet-level data. Data is pre-processed to extract per-device (switch/router) and per-flow (5-tuple: source/destination IP/port) packet transmission rates and loss rates.  Crucially, data collection occurs at *very* short intervals (e.g., 10ms – 1ms) to capture transient behavior.

2.  **Baseline Establishment (Adaptive):**  A baseline of ‘normal’ transmission/loss behavior is established for each device and flow.  This baseline isn’t static; it adapts over time using exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) and/or Kalman filtering to account for diurnal patterns and gradual shifts in traffic patterns. Separate baselines maintained for different times of day, and days of the week.

3.  **Correlation Engine:** This is the core innovation.  The engine identifies *correlated* deviations from the established baselines.
    *   **Inter-Device Correlation:**  Looks for instances where deviations in transmission/loss rates occur *simultaneously* across multiple devices along a known path. This can indicate a widespread attack or a network-level congestion issue.
    *   **Flow-Level Correlation:**  Identifies correlated anomalies within a specific flow across multiple devices. For example, a sudden increase in loss rate on multiple hops for a specific application might signal a targeted DDoS attack against that application.
    *   **Temporal Correlation:** Tracks the evolution of anomalies over time.  A slow, gradual increase in loss rate might indicate a developing hardware failure, while a sudden spike could signal a flash flood attack.

4.  **Anomaly Scoring & Alerting:**  Each correlated anomaly is assigned a score based on the magnitude of the deviation from the baseline, the number of devices/flows affected, and the duration of the anomaly.  Alerts are triggered when the score exceeds a predefined threshold.  Scoring utilizes a bayesian approach.

5.  **Behavioral Fingerprint Database:** Stores the historical data of transmission/loss rates, anomaly scores, and associated metadata (timestamps, device IDs, flow IDs, etc.). This database is used for long-term trend analysis and for improving the accuracy of the anomaly detection algorithms. Utilizes a time-series database optimized for rapid retrieval and analysis.

**Pseudocode (Core Correlation Logic):**

```pseudocode
// For each device and flow, at each time interval:
transmission_rate = calculate_transmission_rate()
loss_rate = calculate_loss_rate()

// Calculate deviation from baseline
transmission_deviation = transmission_rate - baseline_transmission_rate
loss_deviation = loss_rate - baseline_loss_rate

// Inter-Device Correlation (Simplified)
correlation_score = 0
for each device in path:
    if (device.transmission_deviation > threshold AND device.loss_deviation > threshold):
        correlation_score += 1

//Flow Level Correlation (Simplified)
flow_correlation_score = 0
for each device in path:
  if (device.transmission_deviation > flow_threshold AND device.loss_deviation > flow_threshold):
    flow_correlation_score += 1

//Alerting:
if (correlation_score > inter_device_threshold OR flow_correlation_score > flow_threshold):
    generate_alert(device_ids, flow_id, anomaly_type, severity)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance network taps or SPAN ports.
*   Dedicated server cluster for data processing and analysis.
*   Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus).
*   Machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Real-time alerting and visualization tools.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
*   Automated response actions (e.g., rate limiting, traffic redirection).
*   Predictive analysis to identify potential network issues before they occur.
*   Application-aware anomaly detection based on application protocols.
