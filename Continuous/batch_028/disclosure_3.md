## Policy Shadowing & Predictive Modification

**Concept:** Expand the system to not just *identify* policies allowing access, but to actively ‘shadow’ those policies and predict potential future access requests. Then, proactively suggest modifications *before* an unintended access occurs, focusing on the *impact* of changes, not just the changes themselves.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Policy Engine:** A persistent process that duplicates relevant access permission policies, creating a 'shadow' copy. This copy is kept synchronized with live policies but operates independently.
*   **Access Prediction Module:** Utilizes machine learning (specifically, sequence modeling - LSTM or Transformer architectures) to analyze access logs and predict likely future access requests based on user behavior, resource access patterns, and time-based trends.
*   **Impact Analysis Engine:**  Before suggesting a modification (e.g., adding an explicit denial), this engine simulates the change within the Shadow Policy Engine. It then identifies *all* other access requests that would be affected by the change, providing a comprehensive impact report. This goes beyond simple "this access will be denied" to show wider repercussions.
*   **Proactive Modification Suggestion Interface:**  A dashboard displaying predicted access requests and potential modifications with impact reports.  Prioritization is key - modifications affecting fewest other access requests are presented first.
*   **"What-If" Scenario Planning:**  Allows administrators to manually create “what-if” scenarios – modifying policies in the shadow environment to assess the impact *before* applying changes to the live system.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Integrate a feedback mechanism to track the accuracy of access predictions. The system learns from both correct and incorrect predictions, improving its ability to anticipate future access requests.

**Pseudocode (Impact Analysis Engine):**

```
function analyze_impact(shadow_policy_set, proposed_modification, test_access_request_set):
  shadow_policy_set.apply_modification(proposed_modification)
  impacted_requests = []
  for request in test_access_request_set:
    if shadow_policy_set.evaluate(request) != original_policy_set.evaluate(request):
      impacted_requests.append({
        "request": request,
        "original_result": original_policy_set.evaluate(request),
        "new_result": shadow_policy_set.evaluate(request)
      })
  return impacted_requests
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AccessRequest`:  {user_id, resource_id, action, timestamp}
*   `Policy`: {policy_id, rules, scope}
*   `ImpactReport`: {policy_id, proposed_modification, impacted_requests}
