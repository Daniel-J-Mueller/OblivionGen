## Multi-Modal Probe with Integrated Sensing

**Concept:** Expand the “groundless” RF probe concept to incorporate simultaneous, non-destructive physical parameter measurement alongside the RF signal acquisition. This creates a powerful diagnostic tool for material characterization and failure analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Probe Core:** Retain the basic “groundless” antenna array architecture from the patent, with SMA connector output. Substrate material: Rogers 4350B (for low loss at high frequencies).
*   **Integrated Sensor Suite:** Incorporate micro-fabricated capacitive and inductive sensors *within* the shared substrate alongside the antenna array. These sensors will measure:
    *   **Dielectric Constant:** Capacitive sensing of the material directly beneath the probe tip.
    *   **Conductivity/Permeability:** Inductive sensing to detect changes in material properties.
    *   **Temperature:** Integrate a micro-thermocouple or resistive temperature detector (RTD) directly into the probe tip.
*   **Multi-Channel Data Acquisition:** The probe will feature a custom-designed multi-channel data acquisition system:
    *   **RF Channel:** Standard SMA connection for RF signal output.
    *   **Capacitance Channel:** High-resolution capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) with resolution of < 0.01pF.
    *   **Inductance Channel:** High-resolution inductance-to-digital converter (LDC) with resolution of < 0.1 uH.
    *   **Temperature Channel:** Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with resolution of < 0.1°C.
*   **Probe Tip Geometry:** Design interchangeable probe tips with varying geometries (e.g., conical, flat, spherical) to optimize contact and signal coupling for different materials and test setups. The tip material will be Beryllium Copper alloy.
*   **Data Fusion & Control:** Implement a software algorithm to simultaneously acquire and fuse data from all sensor channels.  The software will provide real-time visualization of RF signal and physical parameter maps.

**Pseudocode (Data Acquisition & Processing):**

```
// Initialization
initialize RF receiver
initialize capacitance sensor
initialize inductance sensor
initialize temperature sensor

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Acquire Data
    rf_signal = read_rf_receiver()
    capacitance = read_capacitance_sensor()
    inductance = read_inductance_sensor()
    temperature = read_temperature_sensor()

    // Data Processing
    // Apply calibration factors to raw data
    // Perform noise filtering and signal averaging
    // Generate data maps (e.g., capacitance map, temperature map)

    // Visualization
    display_rf_signal(rf_signal)
    display_capacitance_map(capacitance_map)
    display_temperature_map(temperature_map)

    // Optional: Real-time analysis and anomaly detection
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Non-destructive material characterization
*   Failure analysis of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuits (ICs)
*   Quality control of manufactured components
*   Environmental monitoring (e.g., moisture detection)
*   Medical diagnostics (e.g., tissue characterization – with appropriate biocompatible materials)
