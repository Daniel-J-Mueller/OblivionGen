## Scanner Device - Haptic Feedback & Augmented Reality Integration

**Concept:** Integrate haptic feedback and augmented reality (AR) projection directly into the scanner device to provide real-time, tactile and visual confirmation of scanned objects and data. This goes beyond simply *seeing* the scan; it allows the user to *feel* and *interact* with a digital representation of the scanned object *during* the scanning process.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Form Factor:** Maintain a handheld form factor similar to existing scanners, but with an integrated AR projection system and haptic feedback array.
*   **AR Projection System:**
    *   Miniature pico-projector capable of projecting a low-resolution, color AR overlay onto the scanned object or the immediate surrounding surface. Resolution: 640x480 minimum.
    *   Projection range: 10cm – 1 meter.
    *   Automatic calibration system to adjust projection based on scanning distance and object geometry. Calibration method: Structured light combined with inertial measurement unit (IMU) data.
    *   Projected information:  Real-time outline of scanned area, detected features (edges, corners, textures), data labels (measurements, material identification).
*   **Haptic Feedback Array:**
    *   Array of micro-actuators embedded in the scanner's surface that touches the scanned object. Actuator density: 50 actuators per cm².
    *   Actuator types: Piezoelectric actuators for precise, localized vibrations.
    *   Haptic feedback modes:
        *   **Edge Detection:**  Actuators vibrate more strongly along detected edges, providing tactile confirmation of the scan boundaries.
        *   **Surface Texture:** Varying vibration patterns to simulate the texture of the scanned surface. Algorithm: Convert texture data from the scan into a vibration frequency and intensity map.
        *   **Feature Highlighting:** Specific actuators vibrate when a particular feature (e.g., hole, notch) is detected, drawing the user's attention.
        *    **Force Feedback:**  Simulate resistance when scanning through different materials.
*   **Data Processing Unit:**
    *   Integrated processor capable of running real-time object recognition, feature extraction, and AR/haptic feedback algorithms. Minimum specs: Quad-core 2.5 GHz processor, 8GB RAM.
    *   Software development kit (SDK) for customization of AR/haptic feedback modes.
*   **Sensor Fusion:**
    *   Combine data from the scanner's primary sensor (e.g., laser, camera) with data from an integrated IMU and depth sensor to improve scan accuracy and object tracking.
    *   Algorithm: Kalman filter for sensor fusion.
*   **Power:**
    *   Rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a minimum runtime of 4 hours.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback - Edge Detection):**

```
function generateHapticFeedback(scanData):
  edges = detectEdges(scanData)
  for each edge in edges:
    coordinates = edge.coordinates
    for each coordinate in coordinates:
      actuatorIndex = mapCoordinateToActuator(coordinate)
      setActuatorVibration(actuatorIndex, intensity = edge.strength)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Reverse Engineering:**  Engineers can 'feel' the shape and features of scanned objects, enabling more accurate modeling and design.
*   **Quality Control:** Inspectors can quickly identify defects by 'feeling' deviations from the expected shape or surface texture.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide tactile feedback for visually impaired users, allowing them to 'see' scanned objects through touch.
*   **Art & Design:** Create immersive sculpting and modeling experiences with real-time tactile feedback.
