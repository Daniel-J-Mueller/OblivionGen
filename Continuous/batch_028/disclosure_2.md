## Dynamic Runtime Composition via Graph-Based Dependencies

**Concept:** Extend the runtime provisioning system to support *composable* runtimes, built from smaller, interconnected runtime components. Instead of monolithic runtimes, define runtimes as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where nodes are individual runtime components (e.g., a specific version of a Python interpreter, a particular machine learning library, a custom pre-processing script) and edges represent dependencies.

**Specification:**

**1. Runtime Definition Language (RDL):**

*   Introduce a declarative language (YAML, JSON, or similar) to define runtimes as DAGs.
*   Each node in the DAG represents a 'Runtime Component' with the following attributes:
    *   `name`: Unique identifier for the component.
    *   `image`: Container image (Docker, etc.) containing the component.
    *   `version`: Semantic versioning string.
    *   `entrypoint`: Command to execute the component within the container.
    *   `resources`: CPU, memory, and other resource requirements.
*   Edges define dependencies between components.  `source` -> `target` signifies that the `target` component requires the `source` component to be running.

**Example RDL:**

```yaml
runtime_name: "ImageProcessingRuntime"
graph:
  nodes:
    python:
      name: "python3.9"
      image: "python:3.9"
      resources: {cpu: 1, memory: 2}
    pillow:
      name: "pillow"
      image: "python:3.9"
      entrypoint: "pip install pillow"
      resources: {cpu: 0.5, memory: 1}
      dependencies: ["python"]
    image_processor:
      name: "image_processor"
      image: "my_image_processor:latest"
      entrypoint: "python /app/main.py"
      resources: {cpu: 2, memory: 4}
      dependencies: ["pillow"]
```

**2. Dynamic Provisioning Service:**

*   Modify the existing provisioning system to parse RDL definitions.
*   The service will:
    *   Analyze the dependency graph.
    *   Provision containers for each node in the graph, respecting dependencies.  A component will only be provisioned *after* its dependencies are running.
    *   Expose necessary ports and volumes for inter-component communication.
    *   Manage the lifecycle of each component (start, stop, restart).

**3.  Communication Interface:**

*   Implement a standard interface (e.g., gRPC, REST) for components to communicate with each other.
*   The interface should handle:
    *   Service discovery â€“ finding the addresses of other components.
    *   Serialization/deserialization of messages.
    *   Error handling.

**4.  Scalability & Resilience:**

*   Implement a mechanism to scale individual components independently based on demand.  This could involve running multiple instances of a component behind a load balancer.
*   Implement fault tolerance by automatically restarting failed components and/or provisioning new instances.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Provisioning Service - `provision_runtime` function):**

```python
def provision_runtime(rdl_definition):
  graph = parse_rdl(rdl_definition)
  ordered_nodes = topological_sort(graph) #Ensure components are provisioned in the right order

  for node in ordered_nodes:
    if node.status == "not_provisioned":
      dependencies_running = True
      for dependency in node.dependencies:
        if dependency.status != "running":
          dependencies_running = False
          break

      if dependencies_running:
        container = create_container(node)
        start_container(container)
        node.status = "running"
        #Update service discovery with container details
      else:
        #Log dependency failure
        raise Exception("Dependency not met for component: " + node.name)

  #Return access information to the runtime
```

**Innovation:** This approach moves beyond static runtime images to a dynamic, composable system.  It enables:

*   **Flexibility:**  Runtimes can be easily customized and updated by modifying the DAG.
*   **Resource Efficiency:** Only the necessary components are provisioned.
*   **Scalability:** Individual components can be scaled independently.
*   **Modularity:** Encourages the development of reusable runtime components.
