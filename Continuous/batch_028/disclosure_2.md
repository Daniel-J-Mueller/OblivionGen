**Adaptive Security Zone Partitioning with Dynamic Resource Allocation**

**Concept:** Extend the sandboxed iframe approach to allow for *dynamic* partitioning of security zones, not just a binary "host" vs. "insecure" separation. This enables granular control over resource access and privileges based on the *real-time* risk assessment of embedded applications.

**Specs:**

1.  **Security Zone Manager (SZM):** A central component within the host application responsible for creating, managing, and monitoring security zones.
2.  **Zone Definition Language (ZDL):** A declarative language used to define the characteristics of security zones. This includes:
    *   Permitted resource access (network, filesystem, CPU, memory).
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP) overrides/extensions.
    *   Inter-zone communication rules.
    *   Risk score thresholds triggering dynamic adjustments.
3.  **Dynamic Resource Broker (DRB):** An intermediary that intercepts resource requests from applications within security zones. It enforces the policies defined in the ZDL and manages resource allocation.
4.  **Risk Assessment Engine (RAE):** Continuously monitors application behavior (network traffic, system calls, data access) and assigns a risk score to each application. This score is used to dynamically adjust security zone policies.
5.  **Adaptive Partitioning Algorithm:** 

    ```pseudocode
    function adjustSecurityZone(application, riskScore) {
      if (riskScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
        // Further restrict resources
        reduceNetworkAccess(application)
        limitCPUUsage(application)
        disableFileWriteAccess(application)
      } else if (riskScore > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD) {
        // Moderate restrictions
        limitNetworkAccess(application)
        monitorFileAccess(application)
      } else {
        // Normal operation
        restoreDefaultResources(application)
      }
    }
    ```
6.  **Zone Isolation Mechanism:** Utilize a combination of containerization (e.g., WebAssembly, micro-VMs) and browser-level sandboxing (iframes) to enforce zone isolation.
7.  **Inter-Zone Communication Protocol:** Establish a secure and controlled communication channel between security zones. All communication must be explicitly authorized by the SZM.

**Implementation Details:**

*   The host application loads embedded applications within dedicated zones.
*   The SZM uses ZDL definitions to create and configure each zone.
*   The DRB intercepts resource requests and enforces zone policies.
*   The RAE continuously monitors application behavior and adjusts zone policies based on risk scores.
*   Inter-zone communication is mediated by the SZM, ensuring that only authorized interactions occur.
*   Utilize a policy engine (e.g. Open Policy Agent) to handle complex rules within the ZDL.

**Novelty:** 

This approach moves beyond static sandboxing to provide a more flexible and adaptable security model. The dynamic partitioning and resource allocation capabilities enable granular control over application privileges, reducing the attack surface and mitigating the risks associated with embedded applications. This also addresses the use-case of progressive trust, allowing the system to *learn* about an application's behavior, and adjust it's level of privilege accordingly.
