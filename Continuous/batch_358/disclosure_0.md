## Adaptive Resource Shaping via Predictive Failure Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the scoring system to proactively *shape* resources, not just react to low scores, by integrating predictive failure modeling and dynamically adjusting resource allocation *before* failures occur. This goes beyond simply migrating resources *after* a risk is detected, and anticipates issues by subtly shifting load and preparing backup systems.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Failure Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical data from application logs, infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O), and external event streams (e.g., weather events impacting data center power).
*   **Model:** Train a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to predict the probability of failure for individual hosts, racks, and data centers.  Model should output a 'Failure Risk Score' (FRS) for each resource, ranging 0-1.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Assign weights to different input features based on their correlation to past failures.  Weights are updated continuously via a reinforcement learning agent.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Incorporate anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns in infrastructure metrics that may indicate impending failures not captured by the forecasting model.

**2. Resource Shaping Engine:**

*   **Input:** Application specification (as in the base patent), FRS for all resources, current application load, and pre-defined Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
*   **Target SLO Deviation:** Define acceptable deviation from SLOs. If predicted failure risk threatens to breach SLOs, Resource Shaping Engine activates.
*   **Shaping Actions:**
    *   **Load Shifting:**  Dynamically redirect traffic *away* from resources with high FRS, prioritizing resources with low FRS.  This is done at the application level (e.g., using a service mesh or load balancer).
    *   **Pre-emptive Scaling:**  Spin up additional instances of the application on healthy resources *before* a failure occurs, increasing redundancy.
    *   **Resource Hibernation:**  If a resource has consistently low utilization *and* high FRS, temporarily hibernate it to conserve energy and reduce potential failure points.
    *   **"Shadow" Replication:**  Create lightweight replicas of critical services on healthy resources, allowing for near-instantaneous failover.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Incorporate cost metrics (e.g., cloud provider pricing) into the shaping decisions, minimizing the overall cost of maintaining high availability.

**3. Feedback Loop:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of the application and infrastructure after shaping actions are taken.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  Use a reinforcement learning agent to learn which shaping actions are most effective at maintaining high availability and minimizing costs.  The agent receives rewards for meeting SLOs and penalties for failures or high costs.
*   **Model Retraining:**  Periodically retrain the predictive failure model and the reinforcement learning agent with new data to improve their accuracy and effectiveness.

**Pseudocode (Resource Shaping Engine):**

```
function shapeResources(applicationSpec, FRS, currentLoad, SLOs):
  // Calculate potential SLO breach based on FRS
  potentialBreach = calculatePotentialSLOBreach(FRS, currentLoad, SLOs)

  if potentialBreach > threshold:
    // Prioritize shaping actions based on cost and effectiveness
    shapingActions = prioritizeShapingActions(FRS, currentLoad, SLOs)

    for action in shapingActions:
      if action == "loadShifting":
        shiftLoad(FRS, currentLoad)
      elif action == "preemptiveScaling":
        scaleApplication(FRS)
      elif action == "resourceHibernation":
        hibernateResource(FRS)
      elif action == "shadowReplication":
        replicateService(FRS)
  return
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simply reacting to risk. It *predicts* risk and proactively adjusts resources to prevent failures before they happen, resulting in a more resilient and cost-effective application. The integration of predictive modeling, reinforcement learning, and dynamic resource allocation creates a self-optimizing system that can adapt to changing conditions and maximize availability.
