## Acoustic Mapping & Predictive Loss System

**Concept:** Expand the tracking beyond simple 'removed from premises' alerts to create a detailed acoustic map of a home or facility, learning expected soundscapes and predicting potential loss *before* a tag signal is lost. This moves from reactive tracking to proactive prediction.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing Smart Home Hub (SHH) with LPWAN receiver (as per patent).
    *   Distributed Microphone Array: Low-cost, wireless microphones strategically placed throughout the monitored area. These *do not* need directional capabilities, but must have reliable wireless connectivity to the SHH.  Minimum density: one microphone per 500 sq ft.
    *   Microphone Calibration Module:  A tool for initial acoustic calibration of each microphone, adjusting for volume and frequency response.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Acoustic Baseline Builder:**  A software module running on the SHH.  This will record ambient soundscapes for a defined period (e.g., 7 days) to create a baseline acoustic profile for each microphone’s location.  It should analyze frequency distribution, sound event types (e.g., speech, music, appliance sounds), and average sound pressure levels.
    *   **Sound Event Recognition (SER) Engine:** Integrated into the SHH. This engine will identify and categorize sound events in real-time. It will be trainable – users can add/modify sound event definitions. Examples: "dog bark," "baby cry," "key jingle," "door slam."
    *   **Anomaly Detection Module:**  This module runs continuously, comparing current soundscapes to the established acoustic baseline and SER outputs.  It flags anomalies based on:
        *   Unexpected silence (e.g., a normally noisy appliance stops).
        *   The *absence* of expected sounds (e.g., no key jingle when a person typically leaves).
        *   Unusual sound events (e.g., glass breaking).
        *   Changes in sound propagation patterns.
    *   **Predictive Loss Algorithm:**  This algorithm combines anomaly detection results with tag data.  If a tag signal weakens *and* the Predictive Loss Algorithm identifies a correlated anomaly (e.g., a tag on a set of keys weakens, and the system detects no key jingle), it initiates a "Potential Loss" alert *before* the tag signal is completely lost.
    *   **Dynamic Sensitivity Adjustment:** Allows users to adjust the sensitivity of the Predictive Loss Algorithm based on location.  For example, higher sensitivity in areas where items are frequently moved.
    *   **API Integration:** Allows integration with existing smart home ecosystems (e.g., Alexa, Google Home) and security systems.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
FUNCTION DetectAnomaly(currentSoundscape, baselineSoundscape, SER_Output):
  anomalyScore = 0

  // Compare current soundscape to baseline
  FOR each frequencyBand IN currentSoundscape:
    IF ABS(currentSoundscape[frequencyBand] - baselineSoundscape[frequencyBand]) > threshold:
      anomalyScore += 1

  // Analyze SER output for unexpected events
  IF SER_Output.unexpectedEventDetected:
    anomalyScore += 5

  // Check for absence of expected sounds (requires pre-defined expected sound profiles)
  IF NOT ExpectedSoundDetected(currentSoundscape, expectedSoundProfile):
    anomalyScore += 3

  IF anomalyScore > anomalyThreshold:
    RETURN TRUE // Anomaly detected
  ELSE:
    RETURN FALSE // No anomaly detected
```

**Innovation:** This system shifts from simply *reacting* to lost items to *predicting* potential loss based on a holistic understanding of the environment. It combines LPWAN tracking with advanced acoustic analysis to create a proactive security and loss prevention system. The addition of sound propagation patterns would indicate if something is *being* carried away rather than simply 'moved'.
