## Adaptive Memory Partitioning with Dynamic Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the parallel/sequential access concepts to enable a dynamically reconfigurable memory architecture, allowing for partitioning of memory into variable-sized blocks optimized for different access patterns *during runtime*. This goes beyond simply reading/writing sequentially or in parallel – it’s about *how* the memory is organized internally to maximize throughput.

**Specs:**

*   **Memory Core:** Utilize a core architecture based on a mesh network of memory cells. Each cell contains a small SRAM block and configurable routing logic.
*   **Partition Manager:** A dedicated hardware block responsible for reconfiguring the mesh network. It receives requests from the system specifying access patterns and data sizes.
*   **Granularity Levels:** Support at least three granularity levels:
    *   **Byte-Level:** Standard access for scalar data.
    *   **Block-Level (64/128/256 Bytes):** Optimized for typical data structures.
    *   **Page-Level (4KB/8KB/16KB):**  For large sequential reads/writes.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:**  The Partition Manager reconfigures the mesh network to create contiguous blocks of memory at the requested granularity.  This involves enabling/disabling routing paths between memory cells. Reconfiguration is pipelined to minimize latency.
*   **Access Engine Interface:** The existing access engine (read/write) interacts with the reconfigured memory layout. The Partition Manager provides a mapping table translating logical addresses to physical locations within the mesh network.
*   **Access Pattern Monitoring:** Hardware counters track access patterns (sequential, random, stride) for each memory block. This data feeds back into the Partition Manager, allowing it to proactively adjust the memory layout.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a priority-based scheme to resolve conflicts when multiple access requests target the same memory block during reconfiguration.

**Pseudocode (Partition Manager):**

```
function reconfigureMemory(logicalAddress, dataSize, accessPattern) {
  // Determine optimal granularity level based on dataSize and accessPattern
  granularity = determineGranularity(dataSize, accessPattern);

  // Allocate contiguous memory blocks at the specified granularity
  physicalBlocks = allocateMemory(granularity, logicalAddress, dataSize);

  // Update the mapping table with the new physical addresses
  updateMappingTable(logicalAddress, physicalBlocks);

  // Initiate reconfiguration of the mesh network
  reconfigureMeshNetwork(physicalBlocks);

  return success;
}

function determineGranularity(dataSize, accessPattern) {
  if (accessPattern == "sequential" && dataSize > 4KB) {
    return "pageLevel";
  } else if (accessPattern == "random" && dataSize < 64B) {
    return "byteLevel";
  } else {
    return "blockLevel";
  }
}

function allocateMemory(granularity, logicalAddress, dataSize) {
  // Implementation details for allocating contiguous blocks of memory
  // based on the specified granularity.
}

function updateMappingTable(logicalAddress, physicalBlocks) {
  // Update the mapping table with the new physical addresses.
}

function reconfigureMeshNetwork(physicalBlocks) {
  // Reconfigure the mesh network to create contiguous blocks of memory
  // at the specified granularity.
}
```

**Potential benefits:**

*   Improved memory throughput by optimizing access patterns.
*   Reduced latency for frequently accessed data.
*   Increased flexibility and adaptability to changing workloads.
*   Better utilization of memory resources.
