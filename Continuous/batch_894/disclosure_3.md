## Acoustic Shadowing & Intent Mapping System

**Concept:** Leverage the neural network's ability to discern human presence not just for location, but to build an intent map based on acoustic shadowing and predicted movement. This isn’t about *where* a person is, but *what* they are likely doing, and *where* they are likely going next.

**Hardware Specs:**

*   **Existing Infrastructure:** Utilizes the existing wireless RX/TX network described in the patent.
*   **Acoustic Sensor Array:** Deploy a network of low-cost, MEMS microphones distributed throughout the building, strategically placed near wireless RX/TX units. These do *not* need high fidelity, just sufficient sensitivity to detect basic sounds.
*   **Edge Processing Units:** Small, low-power processors integrated with the RX/TX units and acoustic sensor arrays. These run initial sound event detection.
*   **Centralized Processing:**  A central server (or cloud instance) runs the full neural network and intent mapping algorithms.

**Software/Algorithm Specs:**

1.  **Channel Property/Acoustic Fusion:** The existing neural network (trained on channel properties) receives *both* channel property data *and* preliminary sound event data (e.g., “speech,” “footsteps,” “object interaction”) from the edge processing units.
2.  **Acoustic Shadowing:**  Utilize the combined channel properties and sound event data to predict ‘acoustic shadows’. This involves modeling how sound waves propagate through the building and are reflected or absorbed by objects.  The NN identifies areas *where sound would be expected* based on identified sound sources (detected by the mics) and the building's geometry.  Discrepancies between predicted and actual sound levels indicate potential occlusions – a person blocking a sound source, or moving into an area that would dampen sound.
3.  **Intent Prediction:** Build a probabilistic model of common human activities within the building (e.g., “going to a meeting,” “getting coffee,” “returning to desk”). This model is trained on historical data of human movement (derived from the existing presence detection) and correlated with sound event data.
    *   Example: Detection of footsteps + speech + approaching an office door = high probability of attending a meeting.
4.  **Movement Prediction:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict future movement based on current location, detected intent, and historical movement patterns. The RNN learns typical routes and adapts to unexpected deviations.
5.  **Dynamic Building Map:** Create a dynamic map of the building that visualizes:
    *   Real-time presence of humans.
    *   Predicted intent of humans.
    *   Predicted movement paths.
    *   Confidence levels for predictions.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction):**

```
// Input: ChannelProperties, AcousticEventData, HistoricalMovementData
// Output: IntentPrediction (probability distribution over possible intents)

function PredictIntent(ChannelProperties, AcousticEventData, HistoricalMovementData) {

    // 1. Feature Extraction:
    channelFeatures = ExtractFeatures(ChannelProperties);
    acousticFeatures = ExtractFeatures(AcousticEventData);
    historyFeatures = ExtractFeatures(HistoricalMovementData);

    // 2. Combined Feature Vector:
    combinedFeatures = Concatenate(channelFeatures, acousticFeatures, historyFeatures);

    // 3. Intent Classification Network: (Multi-Layered Neural Network)
    intentScores = IntentNetwork(combinedFeatures); //Output: Raw scores for each intent

    // 4. Softmax Activation:
    intentProbabilities = Softmax(intentScores); // Output: Probabilities for each intent

    return intentProbabilities;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart HVAC:**  Pre-cool/heat areas based on predicted movement.
*   **Automated Lighting:** Adjust lighting based on predicted presence and activity.
*   **Security System Enhancement:**  Detect anomalous behavior by comparing predicted movement with actual movement.
*   **Resource Optimization:**  Optimize use of shared resources (e.g., meeting rooms) based on predicted demand.
*   **Personalized Assistance:**  Provide proactive assistance to building occupants based on predicted needs.
