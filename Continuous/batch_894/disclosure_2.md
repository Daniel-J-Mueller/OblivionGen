## Dynamic Model Composition via Generative Pre-training & Modular Networks

**Specification:** A system for composing machine learning models dynamically, leveraging generative pre-training and modular neural networks. This extends the iterative stacking concept by introducing a ‘model genome’ and evolutionary selection pressure based on performance in a simulated environment.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Model Genome:** Each ‘base model’ is represented by a genome – a vector of parameters defining its architecture (number of layers, layer types, activation functions, etc.) and initial weights. This genome is *not* the model itself, but a blueprint.

2.  **Generative Pre-training (GPT) for Genome Creation:** A GPT model is trained on a corpus of successful model architectures (expressed as genome vectors). This GPT model learns the ‘grammar’ of effective architectures.  New genomes are generated by sampling from this GPT model.

3.  **Modular Neural Network Library:** A library of pre-built neural network modules (e.g., convolutional layers, recurrent layers, attention mechanisms, fully connected layers).  The genome specifies which modules to instantiate and how to connect them.

4.  **Simulated Environment:** A synthetic data environment where models are tested.  The environment can vary the data distribution, noise levels, and task complexity to simulate real-world variability.

5.  **Evolutionary Algorithm:** A population of models (defined by their genomes) is maintained. Models are evaluated in the simulated environment, and a fitness score is assigned based on their performance.  Selection, crossover, and mutation operators are applied to the genomes to create a new generation of models.  

6.  **Dynamic Stacking:** The stacking model doesn’t just *combine* the outputs of base models, it *selects* which base models to use for each input instance. This selection is performed by a separate neural network (the ‘selector’) trained to maximize performance in the simulated environment.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
train_GPT_on_successful_architectures(architecture_corpus)
initialize_population(population_size) // Each member has a genome

// Iteration Loop
for iteration in range(num_iterations):
    // Evaluation
    for model in population:
        genome = model.genome
        base_model = create_base_model_from_genome(genome)
        performance = evaluate_base_model(base_model, simulated_environment)
        model.fitness = performance
    
    // Selection
    selected_models = select_top_k_models(population, k=selection_size)
    
    // Crossover & Mutation
    new_population = []
    for i in range(population_size):
        parent1 = select_random_model(selected_models)
        parent2 = select_random_model(selected_models)
        child_genome = crossover(parent1.genome, parent2.genome)
        child_genome = mutate(child_genome, mutation_rate)
        new_population.append(Model(child_genome))

    population = new_population

    // Training Stacking Model (Selector)
    selector = train_selector_model(population, simulated_environment)

// Deployment
deploy_best_model(selector, population)
```

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **GPT Model:** Transformer-based language model trained on a large corpus of machine learning model architectures.  Input: genome vector. Output: probability distribution over possible architectures.
*   **Modular Network Library:** A collection of pre-built neural network modules. Each module has a standardized interface for connecting to other modules.
*   **Simulated Environment:** Customizable environment that allows for control over data distribution, noise levels, and task complexity.
*   **Selector Model:**  A neural network (e.g., a feedforward network or a recurrent network) that takes an input instance and selects a subset of base models to use for prediction.
*   **Genome Representation:** A vector of parameters defining the architecture of a base model.  Parameters could include: number of layers, layer types, activation functions, kernel sizes, number of filters, etc.

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond iterative stacking by *generating* and *evolving* model architectures. The GPT model enables the creation of diverse architectures, and the evolutionary algorithm ensures that the best architectures are selected and refined. The dynamic selection of base models allows the system to adapt to changing data distributions and task complexities.
