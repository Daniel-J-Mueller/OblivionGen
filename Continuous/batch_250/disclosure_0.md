## Dynamic Content Stitching with Predictive Pre-Encoding

**Concept:** Extend the request-based encoding approach to proactively pre-encode content segments *before* a request arrives, based on predictive analysis of user viewing patterns and content metadata. This goes beyond simply encoding missing segments; it aims to anticipate *what* will be requested next, and have it ready.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Real-time user viewing data (segment requests, watch time, skips, pauses).
    *   Content metadata (genre, actors, keywords, popularity, time of day/week).
    *   Historical viewing patterns (aggregated, anonymized user data).
*   **Process:** Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, transformer) to predict the probability of a user requesting specific content segments in the near future (e.g., next 5-10 segments). Output is a ranked list of predicted segments for each user (or user segment).
*   **Output:** Ranked list of content segment identifiers (e.g., segment IDs, timestamps) and associated confidence scores.

**2. Pre-Encoding Workflow:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the Predictive Engine output.
*   **Priority Queue:** Maintain a priority queue of content segments to pre-encode. Segments are prioritized based on:
    *   Predicted request probability.
    *   Encoding complexity (estimated based on content characteristics).
    *   Available encoding resources.
*   **Encoding Initiation:** Initiate encoding jobs for the highest-priority segments.  Utilize a distributed encoding cluster for scalability.
*   **Caching:** Store pre-encoded segments in a tiered caching system (e.g., in-memory cache, SSD cache, object storage).

**3.  Content Delivery Integration:**

*   **Request Interception:**  Intercept incoming content requests.
*   **Cache Check:**  Before fetching from the origin server, check the cache for the requested segment.
*   **Pre-Encoded Segment Delivery:** If the segment is available in the cache (and has been pre-encoded), deliver it immediately.
*   **Dynamic Fallback:** If a segment is not available in the cache, fall back to on-demand encoding (as in the original patent).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Client Request
segmentID = request.segmentID

// Check Cache
cachedSegment = cache.get(segmentID)

if (cachedSegment != null) {
  // Pre-encoded segment available
  response.segment = cachedSegment
  return response
} else {
  // Segment not cached, initiate on-demand encoding
  response.segment = encodeSegment(segmentID) //Original patent encoding
  return response
}

//Background Process (Pre-Encoding)
while(true){
  predictedSegments = predictiveEngine.getPredictedSegments()
  for(segment in predictedSegments){
    if(segment.confidence > threshold && !cache.contains(segment.id)){
      encodingJob = createEncodingJob(segment.id, desiredEncodingParameters)
      encodingJob.start()
      cache.put(encodingJob.encodedSegment)
    }
  }
  sleep(interval)
}

```

**Encoding Parameters:**

*   Bitrate selection based on user bandwidth.
*   Resolution scaling based on device capabilities.
*   Audio normalization and equalization.
*   Frame rate adjustments.

**Scalability:**

*   Distributed encoding cluster.
*   Content Delivery Network (CDN) integration.
*   Auto-scaling based on demand.
