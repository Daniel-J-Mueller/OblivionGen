## Dynamic Data "Recipes" & Federated Execution

**Concept:** Extend the data distribution system to not just *distribute* data, but to distribute *instructions* for processing that data, enabling a form of federated computation *at the source* of the data. This moves beyond simple access control and licensing toward a system where the data owner controls *how* their data is used, even after it’s ‘licensed’.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Recipe Definition:** Introduce a new metadata type called a “Data Recipe”. This is a structured document (JSON, YAML, Protocol Buffers) that defines a series of computational steps to be applied to a data file *before* any results are returned. This recipe is associated with the data file during storage.
*   **Recipe Components:**
    *   `Input`: Specifies the input data file(s).
    *   `Transformations`: A list of executable instructions. These could be:
        *   SQL queries.
        *   Python/R code snippets (sandboxed).
        *   References to pre-defined, secure functions.
        *   Calls to external, authorized APIs.
    *   `OutputFormat`: Specifies the desired output format (CSV, JSON, etc.).
*   **Secure Execution Environment:** Implement a secure, sandboxed execution environment at each data storage node. This environment is responsible for:
    *   Validating the Data Recipe.
    *   Executing the Transformations.
    *   Enforcing security policies (e.g., preventing access to external resources).
*   **Federated Query Engine:** Develop a query engine that can:
    *   Decompose a user query into a series of Data Recipe executions.
    *   Distribute the Data Recipes to the appropriate data storage nodes.
    *   Aggregate the results from each node.
*   **Recipe Licensing:**  Extend the licensing model to include Data Recipes. A user can purchase a license to execute a specific Data Recipe on a data file.
*   **Version Control:** Implement version control for Data Recipes, allowing data owners to update their processing logic without breaking existing licenses.

**Pseudocode (Query Engine):**

```
function processQuery(query, user) {
  recipeList = decomposeQuery(query); // Splits query into individual recipe executions
  results = [];
  for (recipe in recipeList) {
    dataNode = findDataNode(recipe.dataFile);
    recipeWithSignature = signRecipe(recipe, dataNode.publicKey);
    request = { recipe: recipeWithSignature, user: user };
    response = sendRequest(dataNode, request);

    if (response.status == "success") {
      results.push(response.data);
    } else {
      //Handle error (e.g., invalid signature, insufficient permissions)
    }
  }
  return aggregateResults(results);
}

function signRecipe(recipe, publicKey) {
  //Uses private key associated with data node
  //Return digitally signed recipe
}
```

**Data Node Pseudocode (Execution):**

```
function handleRequest(request) {
  recipe = verifySignature(request.recipe, publicKey);
  if(recipe == null) {
    return {status: "error", message: "Invalid signature"};
  }

  //Execute recipe transformations on data file
  results = executeRecipe(recipe, dataFile);

  return {status: "success", data: results};
}
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simply accessing *data* to controlling *computation* on the data.  It allows data owners to retain more control over their data, even after it’s been licensed, and enables a new class of privacy-preserving data analysis applications. It shifts the paradigm from "data as a service" to "computation as a service". This also provides a built-in audit trail of data processing, enhancing data governance and compliance.
