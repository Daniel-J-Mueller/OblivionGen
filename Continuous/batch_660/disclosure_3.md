## Dynamic Mesh Network Role Assignment & Predictive Handover

**Concept:** Implement a system where mesh network nodes dynamically negotiate and assign roles (router, repeater, content cache) based on real-time network conditions *and* predicted future needs, enabling proactive handover between nodes before connection degradation.

**Specs:**

**1. Node Capabilities & Profiling:**

*   Each mesh node maintains a ‘capability profile’ detailing:
    *   Radio bandwidth (multiple radios supported)
    *   Processing power
    *   Available storage (for caching)
    *   Power source (battery, wired) & current level.
    *   Historical performance metrics (latency, throughput, packet loss).
*   Nodes periodically broadcast capability profiles.
*   A central, distributed ‘Network Awareness Service’ (NAS) compiles and maintains a dynamic network topology map based on broadcasted profiles. NAS isn't a single point of failure; it's replicated across multiple nodes using a consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft).

**2. Predictive Handover Algorithm:**

*   Each node monitors link quality (signal strength, packet loss) to connected clients and neighboring mesh nodes.
*   Utilizing a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM), the node *predicts* future link quality based on historical data.  Parameters for the model are configurable and can be dynamically adjusted based on network performance.
*   If predicted link quality falls below a threshold *before* actual degradation, the node initiates a "proactive handover" sequence.
*   Handover sequence:
    *   Identifies the optimal neighboring node (using NAS data, factoring in node capabilities, current load, and predicted future link quality to the client).
    *   Pre-authenticates the client with the target node.
    *   Negotiates a seamless transition of the client's connection *before* the current link degrades.  This involves pre-buffering data and transferring session state.
    *   Upon successful transition, the original node releases the client.

**3. Dynamic Role Assignment:**

*   The NAS continuously evaluates network load and node capabilities.
*   Based on this evaluation, the NAS dynamically assigns roles to nodes:
    *   **Router:**  Handles routing traffic between nodes and to the internet.
    *   **Repeater:**  Extends network coverage by relaying traffic.
    *   **Content Cache:**  Stores frequently accessed content locally.
*   Role assignments are communicated to nodes via a control channel.
*   Nodes dynamically adjust their behavior based on assigned roles (e.g., caching content, prioritizing routing traffic).
*   Nodes can *request* a role change if they believe they can provide a better service (e.g., a node with ample storage requesting to become a content cache). The NAS evaluates the request and grants it if it improves overall network performance.

**4. Pseudocode (Proactive Handover):**

```
// Node A (Current Node)
function monitorLinkQuality() {
  // Collect link quality metrics (signal strength, packet loss)
  // Predict future link quality using time-series forecasting
  predictedLinkQuality = forecast(historicalData)

  if (predictedLinkQuality < threshold) {
    initiateProactiveHandover()
  }
}

function initiateProactiveHandover() {
  // Query NAS for optimal neighboring node (Node B)
  nodeB = NAS.findOptimalNeighbor(client, currentLinkQuality)

  // Pre-authenticate client with Node B
  NAS.preAuthenticate(client, nodeB)

  // Negotiate session state transfer with Node B
  NAS.transferSessionState(client, nodeB)

  // Switch client to Node B
  client.connect(nodeB)

  // Release client
  client.disconnect(this)
}
```

**5. Considerations:**

*   **Security:**  Secure communication between nodes and clients is crucial. Implement robust authentication and encryption mechanisms.
*   **Scalability:** The NAS must be scalable to handle a large number of nodes. Distributed consensus algorithms are essential.
*   **Energy Efficiency:**  Optimize the algorithm to minimize energy consumption, particularly for battery-powered nodes.
*   **Overhead:**  Minimize the overhead associated with monitoring link quality and exchanging control messages.
