## Adaptive Data Granularity for Distributed Training Analysis

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A dynamic data aggregation module integrated into the existing machine learning analysis system.
*   **Data Source:**  Raw tensor-level numerical values collected from the machine learning training cluster (as per the patent).
*   **Granularity Levels:**  Defines a hierarchy of data aggregation:
    *   *Level 0 (Raw):* Individual tensor values.
    *   *Level 1 (Micro):*  Moving averages (configurable window size) of tensor values.
    *   *Level 2 (Meso):*  Per-layer statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) computed from tensors.
    *   *Level 3 (Macro):*  Global statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) computed across all layers.
*   **Adaptation Algorithm:** A reinforcement learning (RL) agent.
    *   *State:*  Current training iteration, identified anomalies (from existing alarm system), resource utilization of the training cluster, and a ‘data complexity’ metric (calculated from the variance of tensor values).
    *   *Action:* Select the granularity level for each type of data being analyzed (gradients, weights, activations). Actions are applied per layer or globally.
    *   *Reward:* Calculated based on:
        *   Anomaly detection rate (positive reward for detecting genuine issues).
        *   False positive rate (negative reward).
        *   Communication overhead (negative reward proportional to the amount of data transferred for analysis).
        *   Analysis latency (negative reward for slow analysis).
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Efficient data streaming protocol optimized for transmitting aggregated data from training nodes to the analysis system.  (e.g., using Protocol Buffers or Apache Arrow).
*   **Hardware Requirements:** The RL agent can be deployed on dedicated hardware or integrated into existing analysis nodes.  GPUs are recommended for accelerating RL computations.

**Innovation Description:**

This system intelligently adjusts the granularity of data collected for analysis during machine learning model training.  Instead of always collecting raw tensor values (which can be incredibly bandwidth intensive and computationally expensive), the system learns to adapt the level of aggregation based on the current state of the training process.

During normal operation, it can utilize coarser granularity (e.g., layer statistics) to reduce communication overhead and analysis latency. When anomalies are detected or the training process becomes unstable, it automatically switches to finer granularity (raw tensor values) to provide more detailed information for debugging.

The RL agent acts as a dynamic data filter, ensuring that only the most relevant information is collected for analysis. This reduces the load on the training cluster and improves the efficiency of the debugging process.



**Pseudocode:**

```python
class DataGranularityAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_space, action_space):
        self.q_table = {} # Q-learning table
        self.state_space = state_space
        self.action_space = action_space
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.discount_factor = 0.9

    def choose_action(self, state):
        # Epsilon-greedy exploration
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < 0.1:
            return random.choice(self.action_space)
        else:
            if state not in self.q_table:
                self.q_table[state] = [0] * len(self.action_space)
            return self.action_space[np.argmax(self.q_table[state])]

    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = [0] * len(self.action_space)
        if next_state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[next_state] = [0] * len(self.action_space)

        old_value = self.q_table[state][self.action_space.index(action)]
        next_max = np.max(self.q_table[next_state])

        new_value = (1 - self.learning_rate) * old_value + self.learning_rate * (reward + self.discount_factor * next_max)
        self.q_table[state][self.action_space.index(action)] = new_value


# Example Usage
agent = DataGranularityAgent(
    state_space = ['iteration', 'anomaly_detected', 'resource_utilization'],
    action_space = ['raw', 'micro', 'meso', 'macro']
)

current_state = get_current_state()
action = agent.choose_action(current_state)
apply_data_granularity(action)
# ... training loop ...
reward = calculate_reward()
next_state = get_current_state()
agent.learn(current_state, action, reward, next_state)
