## Dynamic Sector Prediction & Pre-emptive Radio Allocation

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on establishing links *after* discovery. This system predicts optimal sector/radio pairings *before* communication attempts, reducing latency and improving reliability in dynamic environments. It utilizes a localized, predictive AI model running on each mesh node to anticipate communication needs based on historical data and real-time environmental factors.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing mesh node hardware (as per patent) with the addition of a low-power AI accelerator (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU, or equivalent).
    *   High-precision, low-latency environmental sensors (e.g., mmWave radar, micro-vibration sensors) integrated into each node for real-time localized environmental mapping.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Localized Predictive Model:** A lightweight, recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical communication data (successful/failed pairings, signal strength, latency) *and* real-time environmental data (detected movement, object density, potential interference sources).  The model resides *entirely* on the mesh node.
    *   **Sector/Radio Prioritization Algorithm:** Based on the predictive modelâ€™s output (probability scores for each sector/radio pairing), this algorithm pre-allocates radio resources (channel, power level) to the most likely communication targets.
    *   **Dynamic Resource Adjustment:** A feedback loop monitors communication quality (RSSI, PER, latency). If performance falls below a threshold, the algorithm dynamically re-allocates resources, exploring alternative sector/radio pairings.
    *   **Localized Data Aggregation:** Each node maintains a local database of communication history and environmental data. Data is anonymized and aggregated periodically to refine the predictive model. No central data repository is required.
    *   **API for Integration:**  A standardized API allows applications to query the system for predicted communication quality and request optimized radio resource allocation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Sector Prioritization):**

```
// Inputs:
//  - nodeID: Unique identifier of the mesh node.
//  - targetNodeID: ID of the potential communication target.
//  - environmentalData: Real-time sensor data.

function prioritizeSectors(nodeID, targetNodeID, environmentalData):

    // 1. Load local predictive model.
    model = loadModel(nodeID)

    // 2. Predict sector probabilities based on model input.
    sectorProbabilities = model.predict(targetNodeID, environmentalData)

    // 3. Sort sectors by probability (descending).
    sortedSectors = sort(sectorProbabilities, descending)

    // 4. Select top N sectors (e.g., N=3).
    topSectors = sortedSectors.slice(0, 3)

    // 5. Allocate radio resources to top sectors.
    allocateResources(topSectors)

    return topSectors
```

**Innovation:**  Existing systems react to communication failures. This system *anticipates* them.  By leveraging localized AI and real-time environmental data, it proactively optimizes radio resource allocation, reducing latency, improving reliability, and extending network capacity.  The distributed nature of the AI eliminates single points of failure and enhances privacy. The localized environmental sensors provide a layer of awareness beyond simple signal strength, allowing for proactive adaptation to changing conditions.
