## Adaptive Query Shaping via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Extend the identifier-based tracing to dynamically adjust query plans *during* execution based on observed performance, using reinforcement learning. The core idea is to treat query plan optimization as a sequential decision-making problem.

**Specs:**

1.  **Instrumentation:** Modify the existing identifier association to include a performance ‘reward’ signal. This reward is calculated based on query execution time, resource utilization (CPU, I/O), and potentially cost metrics.  The reward is associated with the identifier and stored alongside trace data.
2.  **RL Agent:** Implement a Reinforcement Learning agent (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Network) that observes the reward signal and the current query plan. The state space consists of:
    *   Query Plan features (e.g., join order, index usage).
    *   Recent performance metrics (reward history).
    *   Workload characteristics (e.g., query type, data size).
3.  **Action Space:** Define an action space representing possible query plan modifications. Actions could include:
    *   Switching between different indexes.
    *   Reordering join operations.
    *   Adding or removing query hints (similar to the ‘empty table join’ in the original patent but used adaptively).
    *   Adjusting parallelism levels.
4.  **Adaptive Execution:** During query execution, the RL agent observes the reward and selects an action (query plan modification). The modified query plan is applied dynamically *without* restarting the entire query. This requires a query execution engine capable of accepting mid-execution plan changes.
5.  **Exploration/Exploitation:** Employ an exploration/exploitation strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to balance learning new query plan modifications with exploiting known good ones.
6.  **Model Training:** Train the RL agent offline using historical trace data. Continuous online learning can further refine the model.
7.  **Cost Modeling:** Integrate a cost model to estimate the cost of each query plan modification. The RL agent can then optimize for both performance *and* cost.

**Pseudocode (RL Agent):**

```
Initialize RL Agent (Q-table or Neural Network)
For each incoming query:
    Get Query Features (plan, workload)
    Get Current State (Query Features + Recent Rewards)
    Select Action (using Q-table/NN and exploration strategy)
    Apply Action (modify query plan dynamically)
    Execute Modified Query
    Observe Reward (execution time, resource usage, cost)
    Update State (new reward added)
    Update RL Agent (Q-table/NN updated with reward and state)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance database system capable of dynamic query plan modification.
*   Machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Sufficient compute resources for RL agent training and online learning.
*   Robust tracing infrastructure to collect performance metrics and reward signals.
