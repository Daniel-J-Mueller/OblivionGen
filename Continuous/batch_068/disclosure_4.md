## Personalized Echo Cancellation & Keyword Re-Trigger

**Concept:** Extend the keyword detection/disabling system to create a personalized "echo cancellation" feature. Instead of *disabling* a detector, the system actively *modifies* the audio output to suppress the re-triggering of keywords spoken by the user, creating a highly personalized audio experience. This moves beyond simple keyword avoidance to proactive audio shaping.

**Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Existing keyword detectors (Detector 1 & 2 – as in the patent).
    *   Real-time Audio Modification Engine (RAME).  This is a new component.  It uses parametric equalization, dynamic range compression, and potentially formant shifting.
    *   User Profile Database: Stores keyword lists, user voiceprints, and personalized RAME settings.
    *   Voiceprint Analyzer: Extracts characteristics from the user's voice for comparison and adjustment of RAME settings.

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  **User Speech Capture:** Microphone captures user speech.
    2.  **Keyword Detection (User):** Detector 1 analyzes user speech for keywords.
    3.  **Transmission & Processing (Remote):** User's speech is sent to a remote device, processed (e.g., voice assistant command execution), and audio output generated.
    4.  **Keyword Detection (Remote):** Remote device analyzes its *own* generated audio for the same keywords (or keywords relevant to the remote service).
    5.  **Prediction & Modification:** *Before* the audio is sent back to the local device:
        *   The remote device predicts potential keyword re-triggers based on its own generated audio.
        *   The audio is sent to the RAME, which *subtly modifies* the audio signal to reduce the likelihood of re-triggering the keyword when played back. This is NOT noise cancellation.  It is targeted frequency/amplitude attenuation. The RAME will act based on user voiceprint and the type of keyword.
        *   Modification may include slight frequency shifting, dynamic range compression around keyword frequencies, or subtle formant manipulation (to make the re-uttered keyword less ‘clear’).
    6.  **Local Playback:**  Modified audio is played back through the local device's speaker.
    7.  **Real-Time Adjustment Loop:**
        *   The local device continuously monitors the audio output and the user’s environment (via microphone) for keyword re-triggers.
        *   If a re-trigger occurs, the system adjusts the RAME settings dynamically to improve suppression.
        *   Machine learning algorithms analyze the frequency and amplitude of the re-trigger as well as the context of its appearance to refine the audio modification.

*   **Pseudocode (RAME):**

```
function modifyAudio(audioBuffer, keyword, userProfile):
    frequencyRange = getUserKeywordFrequencyRange(keyword, userProfile)
    attenuationLevel = userProfile.attenuationLevel
    formantShift = userProfile.formantShift

    for each frequency in frequencyRange:
        attenuateFrequency(audioBuffer, frequency, attenuationLevel)

    shiftFormants(audioBuffer, formantShift)

    return audioBuffer
```

*   **User Profile Data:**
    *   Keywords: List of keywords to suppress.
    *   Attenuation Level: dB of attenuation to apply to keyword frequencies.
    *   Formant Shift: Amount of formant shifting to apply.
    *   Voiceprint:  Model of the user's voice.
    *   Environment Profile:  Noise levels and typical audio characteristics of the user’s environment.

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Enhanced voice assistant experience: Reduce false positives and improve responsiveness.
    *   Personalized audio books/podcasts: Suppress keywords that might be distracting to the user.
    *   Gaming: Suppress distracting sound effects.
    *   Accessibility: Assist users with auditory processing disorders.
