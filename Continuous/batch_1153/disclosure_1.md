## Dynamic Proximity-Based Role Assignment System

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple group identification to *assign roles* within a group based on dynamic proximity and interaction detected by the smart floor tiles. This creates a more nuanced understanding of user activity and enables automated task assignment or access control.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Smart floor tiles (as described in the provided patent) with enhanced RF sensitivity and directionality.
    *   Central server with increased processing power for real-time role assignment calculations.
    *   Optional: Wearable tags (Bluetooth/RFID) to supplement floor tile data and aid in individual identification if desired.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Role Definition Module:** Allows administrators to define roles (e.g., “Leader,” “Assistant,” “Observer,” “Participant”) and associated behaviors/permissions.
    *   **Proximity Analysis Engine:** Continuously monitors RF signal strengths and tile activation sequences to determine the relative proximity of users to each other and to specific locations (fixtures, equipment, etc.). This engine should not rely on static proximity thresholds, but rather on dynamic analysis of movement patterns and interaction frequency.
    *   **Interaction Detection Algorithm:**  Identifies specific interactions between users, such as sustained physical contact (handshake, shoulder tap), close proximity for a defined duration, or collaborative manipulation of a shared object.
    *   **Role Assignment Logic:**  Based on proximity, interaction data, and predefined rules, automatically assigns roles to users within a group. For example:
        *   The user who initiates contact with a fixture first is designated the "Leader" for that interaction.
        *   Users within a specific proximity range of the “Leader” are automatically assigned the “Assistant” role.
        *   Users maintaining a certain distance and limited interaction are assigned “Observer.”
    *   **Permission Management System:** Associates roles with specific permissions, such as access to equipment, control over displays, or authorization to complete tasks.
    *   **User Interface:** Displays current group roles and permissions to administrators and authorized users.  Includes tools for manual role override if necessary.
    *   **Data Logging and Analytics:** Tracks role assignments, interactions, and permission usage for performance analysis and optimization.

**Pseudocode - Role Assignment Logic:**

```
// Inputs:  tileData (array of tile activations & signal strengths), userIDs (list of users present), predefinedRules (role assignment rules)

function assignRoles(tileData, userIDs, predefinedRules) {

  // Calculate proximity matrix based on tileData
  proximityMatrix = calculateProximity(tileData, userIDs);

  // Identify initial "Leader" based on interaction with a fixture (if any)
  leader = findLeader(tileData);

  // Assign roles to remaining users based on proximity to Leader and predefinedRules
  for each user in userIDs {
    if (user != leader) {
      distance = proximityMatrix[user][leader];
      if (distance < threshold1) {
        role = "Assistant";
      } else if (distance < threshold2) {
        role = "Participant";
      } else {
        role = "Observer";
      }
      assignUserRole(user, role);
    }
  }
}

function calculateProximity(tileData, userIDs) {
  // Calculate distance between users based on signal strength and tile activation sequence
  // Return a matrix of distances
}

function findLeader(tileData) {
  // Identify the user who first interacts with a fixture based on tile activation
  // Return the user ID
}

function assignUserRole(user, role) {
  // Update the user's role in the system
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Manufacturing:** Automated task assignment based on proximity to equipment and skill set.
*   **Healthcare:**  Real-time team assignment during emergencies or surgical procedures.
*   **Retail:** Dynamic staff allocation based on customer traffic and need.
*   **Education:** Collaborative learning environments with automated group formation and role assignment.
*   **Security:**  Automated access control and threat detection based on user proximity and behavior.
