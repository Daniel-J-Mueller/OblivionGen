## Dynamic Graph Embedding with Semantic Hashing

**Concept:** Extend the co-occurrence matrix approach by representing the abstract syntax tree (AST) not as a static graph for embedding generation, but as a dynamic graph that evolves based on code execution traces.  Combine this with semantic hashing to create more contextually aware embeddings.

**Specs:**

1.  **Instrumentation:** Instrument the source code (during compilation or runtime) to capture execution paths. These paths represent actual code usage, rather than just syntactic relationships. Capture data points representing function calls, variable accesses, and conditional branch outcomes.

2.  **Dynamic Graph Construction:**  Instead of building the graph solely from the AST, construct a hybrid graph. The base structure is the AST, but edges are *weighted* and potentially *added* based on execution traces.

    *   **AST Edges:** Maintain the original edges representing syntactic relationships. These have a base weight.
    *   **Execution-Trace Edges:**  For each execution path, create or strengthen edges between tokens/nodes that are frequently accessed in sequence. The weight of these edges is proportional to the frequency of co-occurrence during execution.
    *   **Edge Decay:** Implement an edge decay mechanism. Edges representing infrequent execution patterns should gradually lose weight, preventing the graph from becoming overly dense and reflecting the most common code usage.

3.  **Semantic Hashing Layer:**  Introduce a semantic hashing layer *before* generating embeddings.

    *   **Node Feature Vectors:** Create initial feature vectors for each terminal node, representing its type, name, and surrounding context within the AST.
    *   **Hashing Function:** Train a hashing function (e.g., a neural network) to map these feature vectors to binary hash codes. The goal is to cluster nodes with similar semantic roles (e.g., variables related to a specific data structure) into the same hash bucket.
    *   **Hash-Augmented Graph:**  Add edges between nodes that collide in the hash buckets. This creates a "soft" connection, capturing semantic similarity even if it's not directly reflected in the AST or execution traces. The weight of these hash-augmented edges is lower than AST/execution edges.

4.  **Embedding Generation:**  Use a graph embedding technique (e.g., Node2Vec, DeepWalk) on the dynamically weighted, hash-augmented graph. This will generate embeddings that capture both syntactic structure, runtime behavior, and semantic similarity.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
# Assume 'ast' is the Abstract Syntax Tree
# 'execution_traces' is a list of execution paths (token sequences)
# 'hashing_function' is a trained neural network that outputs hash codes

def build_dynamic_graph(ast, execution_traces, hashing_function):
  graph = initialize_graph_from_ast(ast)

  # Add weights based on execution traces
  for trace in execution_traces:
    for i in range(len(trace) - 1):
      node1 = find_node_in_ast(ast, trace[i])
      node2 = find_node_in_ast(ast, trace[i+1])
      if node1 and node2:
        graph.add_edge(node1, node2, weight=graph.get_edge_weight(node1, node2) + 1)

  # Apply edge decay
  for edge in graph.edges():
    edge.weight = edge.weight * decay_rate

  # Add hash-augmented edges
  for node in graph.nodes():
    hash_code = hashing_function(node.feature_vector)
    for other_node in graph.nodes():
      if hashing_function(other_node.feature_vector) == hash_code:
        graph.add_edge(node, other_node, weight=hash_weight)

  return graph

def generate_embeddings(graph):
  # Use Node2Vec or DeepWalk on the graph
  embeddings = Node2Vec(graph).fit() #example, adapt as needed
  return embeddings
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Context-Aware Embeddings:** Capture runtime behavior and semantic relationships, leading to more accurate code representations.
*   **Improved Code Understanding:** Embeddings can be used for code search, code completion, bug detection, and code refactoring.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** The graph evolves with the code, allowing embeddings to adapt to changes in the code base.
