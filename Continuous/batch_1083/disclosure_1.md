## Dynamic Predictive Exposure Mapping for Multi-Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Leverage real-time object tracking and predictive modeling to dynamically adjust exposure settings *before* image capture across multiple sensors, significantly improving HDR performance and reducing motion artifacts. This goes beyond simply blending differently exposed images; it aims to *anticipate* optimal exposures.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensor Array & Tracking:**

*   Minimum of three synchronized image sensors. Preferred configuration: one central, high-resolution sensor & two flanking sensors with wider dynamic range but lower resolution.
*   Real-time object tracking system integrated. This can utilize optical flow, LIDAR, or other sensor data. The tracking system must identify moving objects within the scene and predict their trajectory.

**2. Predictive Exposure Model:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Object tracking data (position, velocity, predicted trajectory).
    *   Scene illumination data (ambient light level, direction of light sources).
    *   Material properties database (reflectance values for common materials).
    *   Historical exposure data (from previous frames).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each identified object, calculate the expected luminance range based on its material properties, distance from the sensor, and illumination conditions.
    *   Predict potential over/under-exposure issues *before* image capture based on calculated luminance range and current sensor settings.
    *   Adjust exposure settings (shutter speed, aperture, ISO) *dynamically* for each sensor to optimize capture for the predicted luminance range of the object. Sensors can be given different exposure settings to ensure a wider dynamic range captured across the scene.
*   **Output:**
    *   Optimized exposure settings for each sensor.

**3. Data Fusion & Image Reconstruction:**

*   Capture images simultaneously from all sensors using the dynamically adjusted exposure settings.
*   **Disparity Map Generation:** Create a disparity map using established stereo vision techniques (e.g., block matching, semi-global matching) to align images.
*   **Weighted Blending:**
    *   Divide the image into regions based on object tracking data (e.g., each moving object constitutes a region).
    *   For each region, blend image data from different sensors based on the predicted optimal exposure. Regions captured well by one sensor will receive a greater weight from that sensor.
    *   Utilize a Laplacian pyramid blending technique to minimize seams and artifacts during blending.

**4. Pseudocode (Core Blending Function):**

```pseudocode
function blendImages(image1, image2, disparityMap, objectRegions):
  outputImage = createEmptyImage(image1.width, image1.height)

  for each pixel in outputImage:
    region = determineRegionForPixel(pixel.x, pixel.y, objectRegions)
    weight1 = 0.0
    weight2 = 0.0

    if region is in sensor1OptimalRegion:
      weight1 = 0.9
      weight2 = 0.1
    else if region is in sensor2OptimalRegion:
      weight1 = 0.1
      weight2 = 0.9
    else:
      weight1 = 0.5
      weight2 = 0.5

    //Use disparity map to find corresponding pixels
    pixel1 = getImagePixel(image1, pixel.x + disparityMap[pixel.x][pixel.y].x, pixel.y + disparityMap[pixel.x][pixel.y].y)
    pixel2 = getImagePixel(image2, pixel.x + disparityMap[pixel.x][pixel.y].x, pixel.y + disparityMap[pixel.x][pixel.y].y)

    outputImage[pixel.x][pixel.y] = (weight1 * pixel1) + (weight2 * pixel2)

  return outputImage
```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-speed image sensors with synchronized triggering.
*   Powerful processing unit (GPU recommended) for real-time object tracking and image processing.
*   Precision synchronization hardware to ensure accurate timing between sensors.
*   Calibration system to accurately map the sensor geometry and correct for distortions.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.
*   Support for more than three sensors.
*   Dynamic adjustment of blending weights based on scene complexity.
*   Implementation of a noise reduction algorithm tailored for multi-sensor fusion.
