## Adaptive Radio Persona System

**Concept:** Implement distinct “radio personas” – pre-configured duty cycle and parameter sets – tailored to *application contexts*, rather than solely throughput requirements. The system learns to associate specific application behaviors (e.g., streaming video, sensor data bursts, interactive gaming) with optimal radio configurations, dynamically switching between personas.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Database:** A non-volatile storage module containing pre-defined radio personas. Each persona encapsulates:
    *   Target Duty Cycle (%).
    *   Packet Aggregation Value.
    *   Packet Length.
    *   Transmit Power Level (dBm).
    *   Channel Selection Preference (list of preferred channels).
    *   Retry Parameters (number of retries, backoff algorithm).
*   **Application Behavior Monitor:** A software module that analyzes application network traffic patterns to identify application context. This employs machine learning (e.g., a recurrent neural network) trained on a dataset of application traffic characteristics. Key features to monitor:
    *   Inter-packet arrival times.
    *   Packet size distribution.
    *   Frequency of data bursts vs. idle periods.
    *   Directionality of traffic (upload vs. download).
*   **Persona Selection Engine:** A rule-based system that maps identified application contexts to the most appropriate radio persona. The engine incorporates:
    *   A weighted scoring system to evaluate persona suitability.
    *   A learning mechanism to refine persona selection based on performance feedback (latency, throughput, packet loss).
*   **Dynamic Persona Blending:**  A module capable of *combining* characteristics from multiple personas. This allows for a granular control, adapting to situations where an application exhibits mixed behaviors. (e.g., 70% streaming persona + 30% sensor data persona).
*   **Air Time Statistics Enhancement:** Add monitoring for channel utilization and interference levels *per channel*. This allows the persona selection engine to avoid congested channels, further optimizing performance.

**Pseudocode (Persona Selection Engine):**

```
function select_persona(application_context, current_radio_settings, channel_stats):
  // Fetch candidate personas based on application_context
  candidate_personas = persona_database.get_personas(application_context)

  // Calculate a suitability score for each candidate persona
  for persona in candidate_personas:
    suitability_score = 0
    // Score based on throughput requirement alignment
    suitability_score += throughput_alignment(persona.target_duty_cycle, current_throughput_requirement)

    // Score based on latency sensitivity (application context dictates sensitivity)
    suitability_score += latency_alignment(persona.retry_parameters, application_latency_sensitivity)

    // Score based on channel stats (avoid congested channels)
    suitability_score += channel_alignment(persona.channel_selection_preference, channel_stats)

    persona.score = suitability_score

  // Select the persona with the highest score
  best_persona = max(persona.score for persona in candidate_personas)

  //Implement Persona Blending
  if (application exhibits mixed behaviors):
    //Combine traits of top 2 personas (e.g. 70% persona A + 30% persona B)
    blended_persona = blend(personaA, personaB, ratio)
    return blended_persona

  return best_persona
```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   Requires a processor with sufficient processing power to run the machine learning algorithms and persona selection engine.
*   Increased memory requirements to store the persona database and training data.
*   Radio hardware capable of dynamic configuration of duty cycle, packet aggregation, and transmit power.
