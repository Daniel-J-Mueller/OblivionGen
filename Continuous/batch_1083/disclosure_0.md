## Dynamic Contextual POI Generation & Projection

**Concept:** Extend personalized POI beyond simple relevance scores derived from user data and marketplace activity. Introduce a system that *generates* POI dynamically, projecting potential interests based on real-time context and predictive modeling.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sensors:** Access to device sensors (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, camera, microphone).  Optional integration with external data streams (weather, traffic, local events APIs).
*   **Data Types:**
    *   **Location:** Precise GPS coordinates.
    *   **Motion:** Speed, direction, activity (walking, driving, stationary).
    *   **Environmental:** Ambient sound, visual scene analysis (identifying landmarks, businesses, objects).
    *   **Temporal:** Time of day, day of week, seasonality.
    *   **Social Proximity:**  Detection of nearby devices (with user permission) to infer social context (e.g., group activity).  This is strictly opt-in, anonymized, and focused on *density* not individual ID.
*   **Data Fusion:** Combine multiple data streams to create a rich contextual profile.

**2. Predictive Interest Model:**

*   **Core:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) – LSTM or GRU preferred – trained on anonymized user behavior data (purchases, searches, location history).
*   **Input:**  Contextual profile from Module 1, user profile (demographics, preferences, purchase history), external data (e.g., trending topics).
*   **Output:**  Probability distribution over potential POI categories (e.g., “coffee shop with free wifi”, “vintage bookstore”, “dog-friendly park”).  The output isn’t just a pre-defined list; it’s a dynamic prediction of *latent* interests.
*   **Novelty Factor:** Introduce a parameter that encourages exploration of *unlikely* but potentially interesting POI.  This mitigates the filter bubble effect.

**3. Dynamic POI Generation Module:**

*   **POI Synthesis:**  Based on the predicted POI category from Module 2, synthesize a POI description and relevant attributes.
    *   **Attribute Generation:** Uses generative models (e.g., GPT-3 or similar) to create descriptions, opening hours, price ranges, user reviews (simulated, based on category).
    *   **Geo-Spatial Placement:**  Places the synthesized POI on the map at a logical location (e.g., based on nearby businesses, land use data).
*   **Real-Time Refinement:** Continuously refine the POI based on user interaction (e.g., walking direction, gaze tracking).  If the user ignores a generated POI, its relevance score is lowered.

**4. Projection & Visualization Module:**

*   **Augmented Reality (AR) Overlay:**  Project generated POI onto the real world via the device camera (optional).
*   **Probabilistic Visualization:**  Represent POI relevance as a visual gradient (e.g., color intensity, size).
*   **Interactive Exploration:**  Allow users to query the system for specific types of generated POI (e.g., “show me something unexpected nearby”).

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Predictive Interest Model):**

```
function predict_poi_category(context_profile, user_profile, external_data):
  # Concatenate input data
  combined_input = concatenate([context_profile, user_profile, external_data])

  # Pass through RNN
  output = rnn(combined_input)

  # Apply softmax to get probability distribution over POI categories
  poi_probabilities = softmax(output)

  return poi_probabilities
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond *finding* existing POI to *creating* them, tailoring recommendations to the user's *current* situation and anticipating their *potential* interests.  The system acts as a dynamic 'curator' of local experiences, expanding the boundaries of what's discoverable.  It is not based on pre-existing POI data, but on dynamic generation.
