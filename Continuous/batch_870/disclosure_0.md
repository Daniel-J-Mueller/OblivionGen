## Dynamic Rectifier Sparsity & Adaptive Gradient Scaling

**Concept:** Implement a system where the sparsity (percentage of inactive neurons) *within* each rectifier layer is dynamically adjusted *during* training, coupled with an adaptive gradient scaling mechanism based on layer-wise rectified activation distributions. This aims to accelerate learning, improve generalization, and potentially reduce computational cost.

**Specification:**

1.  **Sparsity Target Schedule:**
    *   Introduce a `sparsity_schedule` – a function mapping training epoch to a target sparsity level (0.0 – 1.0) for each layer.
    *   Layers can have *different* sparsity schedules.  Initial sparsity is low (e.g., 0.05-0.1).  Schedules can be linear, exponential, or polynomial decay. Allow for 'plateaus' where sparsity remains constant for multiple epochs.

2.  **Rectified Activation Distribution Monitoring:**
    *   During each forward pass, monitor the distribution of rectified activations *within* each layer. Compute the mean (`μ`) and standard deviation (`σ`) of the rectified activations.
    *   Maintain a running average (`μ_avg`, `σ_avg`) of these statistics for each layer.

3.  **Dynamic Sparsity Adjustment:**
    *   At the end of each epoch (or a defined frequency), compare the current sparsity of each layer to its target sparsity from `sparsity_schedule`.
    *   Implement a *soft* sparsity adjustment. Instead of directly masking neurons, modulate their weights.  A modulation factor (`m`) is calculated for each neuron:

        ```
        m = 1.0 if neuron_weight > sparsity_threshold else 0.0
        sparsity_threshold = percentile(neuron_weights, (1.0 - target_sparsity))
        ```

    *   Apply `m` to the neuron's weight before the backward pass. This effectively "sparsifies" the layer.

4.  **Adaptive Gradient Scaling:**
    *   Calculate a layer-wise gradient scaling factor (`g`) based on the rectified activation distribution:

        ```
        g =  1.0 / (σ_avg + epsilon)
        epsilon = 1e-8  (small constant for numerical stability)
        ```
    *   Multiply the gradients for each layer by its corresponding `g` *before* applying the optimizer.  Layers with high variance in activations will have smaller gradients, preventing them from dominating learning. Layers with low variance will receive larger gradients.

5.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   Integrate this system into an existing deep learning framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow).
    *   Expose configurable parameters: `sparsity_schedule` (per layer), learning rate for `sparsity_schedule`, `epsilon` value.
    *   Provide visualization tools to monitor layer-wise sparsity, activation distributions, and gradient scales during training.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Training Loop):**

```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in data_loader:
        # Forward Pass
        activations = []
        outputs = model(batch)

        # Collect Activations
        for layer in model.layers:
            activations.append(layer.output)

        # Loss Calculation
        loss = loss_function(outputs, targets)

        # Backward Pass
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.parameters)

        # Gradient Scaling
        for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
            mu = mean(activations[i])
            sigma = std(activations[i])
            scaling_factor = 1.0 / (sigma + 1e-8)
            gradients[i] = gradients[i] * scaling_factor

        # Sparsity Adjustment
        for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
            target_sparsity = sparsity_schedule[i](epoch)
            threshold = percentile(layer.weights, 1.0 - target_sparsity)
            layer.weights = layer.weights * (layer.weights > threshold)

        # Optimizer Step
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.parameters))
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Faster training due to induced sparsity and adaptive gradients.
*   Improved generalization by preventing overfitting.
*   Reduced computational cost during inference due to sparse layers.
*   Better handling of vanishing/exploding gradients.
