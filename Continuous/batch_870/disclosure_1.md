## Adaptive Sensor Orchestration via Predictive Network Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the sensor deployment concept to *predictively* deploy sensors based on a dynamic model of network behavior, rather than reactively deploying them based on user account or initial network topology. This allows for focused intelligence gathering *before* malicious activity is observed, significantly reducing dwell time.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Network Behavior Model (NBM):** A machine learning model trained on historical network traffic data (internal and external, anonymized where necessary). This model learns typical traffic patterns, communication flows, and resource utilization for various user segments/industries.  Input features:  IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, packet sizes, communication frequencies, data transfer volumes, file types, and geographic locations. Output: A probabilistic map of expected network activity.

*   **Component 2: Predictive Sensor Controller (PSC):** Monitors the NBM for deviations from expected behavior.  Deviations are scored based on magnitude and frequency.  The PSC maintains a "Sensor Budget" (number of sensors deployable) and a “Coverage Map” of currently monitored network segments.  Based on the deviation score, budget, and coverage, the PSC dynamically deploys sensors to areas exhibiting anomalous behavior.

*   **Component 3: Sensor Profiles:**  Predefined sensor configurations optimized for specific threat vectors (e.g., ransomware, data exfiltration, botnet activity). The PSC selects the appropriate profile based on the type of anomaly detected. Includes: file monitoring rules, network traffic filters, process behavior analysis settings, and reporting thresholds.

*   **Component 4:  Dynamic Sensor Placement Algorithm:**  An algorithm that determines the optimal placement of sensors within the network to maximize coverage of anomalous activity while minimizing resource consumption.  Considers network topology, sensor capabilities, and traffic patterns. 

**Pseudocode (PSC - Core Loop):**

```
initialize NBM, Sensor Budget, Coverage Map

while (true):
    observed_traffic = get_current_network_traffic()
    anomaly_score = NBM.calculate_anomaly_score(observed_traffic)

    if (anomaly_score > threshold AND Sensor Budget > 0 AND Coverage Map lacks coverage of anomaly source):
        sensor_profile = select_sensor_profile(anomaly_type)
        sensor_placement = dynamic_sensor_placement_algorithm(anomaly_source, sensor_profile)
        deploy_sensor(sensor_profile, sensor_placement)
        Sensor Budget -= 1
        update_Coverage_Map(sensor_placement)
    else:
        monitor_existing_sensors()
        collect_sensor_data()
        re-train_NBM(sensor_data)
        adjust_Sensor_Budget() //based on resource utilization & threat landscape.
```

**Innovation Focus:** This moves beyond reactive sensor deployment.  The system *anticipates* potential threats and proactively positions sensors to detect them. It's about shifting from “detect and respond” to “predict and prevent”. The NBM continually adapts based on observed data, becoming more accurate over time.
