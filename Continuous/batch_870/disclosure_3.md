## Dynamic Assistant Persona Switching via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the multi-assistant framework to dynamically switch between assistant personas (not just functional roles, but personality, tone, and communication style) based on real-time biofeedback from the user. This creates a highly personalized and adaptive voice interaction experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biofeedback Integration Module:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate with wearable sensors (smartwatch, fitness tracker, dedicated biosensor) to collect data including:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – Indicator of stress & emotional state.
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) – Measures emotional arousal.
    *   Facial Muscle Activity (EMG) – Detects subtle expressions like frustration or happiness.
    *   Brainwave activity (EEG - optional, higher complexity).
*   **Data Processing:** Raw sensor data is processed to extract meaningful emotional and cognitive states. Implement signal filtering, noise reduction, and feature extraction algorithms.
*   **State Mapping:** A predefined mapping table associates biofeedback patterns with corresponding assistant personas.  Examples:
    *   High Stress (high HRV, high GSR): "Calm & Supportive" persona – slow speech, empathetic tone, focus on relaxation techniques.
    *   High Arousal (high GSR, increased heart rate): "Energetic & Motivating" persona – fast speech, positive reinforcement, focus on task completion.
    *   Neutral/Focused (stable HRV, consistent heart rate): "Efficient & Informative" persona – direct language, concise responses, focus on factual information.
    *   Frustration (detected via EMG & HRV): "Problem-Solving & Patient" persona – calming tone, offers alternative solutions, checks for understanding.

**2. Persona Management Subsystem:**

*   **Persona Profiles:** Create a library of pre-defined assistant personas. Each persona profile includes:
    *   Voice Characteristics (tone, pitch, speed, accent).
    *   Language Style (vocabulary, sentence structure, formality).
    *   Response Templates (pre-written phrases and conversational flows).
    *   Behavioral Rules (how the assistant should react to different user inputs).
*   **Dynamic Switching Algorithm:**
    1.  Receive biofeedback data from the Biofeedback Integration Module.
    2.  Analyze the data to determine the user's current emotional and cognitive state.
    3.  Select the appropriate assistant persona based on the state mapping table.
    4.  Activate the selected persona profile, adjusting voice characteristics, language style, and response templates.
*   **Persona Blending (Advanced):** Allow for blending between personas.  Instead of a hard switch, gradually adjust persona characteristics based on subtle changes in biofeedback.  This could create a more seamless and natural interaction experience.

**3. System Architecture Integration:**

*   Integrate the Biofeedback Integration Module and Persona Management Subsystem into the existing multi-assistant framework.
*   The Multi-Assistant Component must be updated to handle persona activation and switching requests.
*   The Command Processing Subsystems (CPS) should be agnostic to the active persona. The Persona Management Subsystem handles all persona-specific modifications to language and voice output.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Switching Algorithm):**

```
function determine_active_persona(biofeedback_data) {
  emotional_state = analyze_biofeedback(biofeedback_data);

  if (emotional_state == "high_stress") {
    active_persona = "calm_supportive";
  } else if (emotional_state == "high_arousal") {
    active_persona = "energetic_motivating";
  } else if (emotional_state == "neutral") {
    active_persona = "efficient_informative";
  } else if (emotional_state == "frustrated") {
    active_persona = "problem_solving_patient";
  } else {
    active_persona = "default"; // Use a default persona if state is unclear
  }

  return active_persona;
}

function activate_persona(persona_name) {
  // Load persona profile (voice settings, language style, response templates)
  persona_profile = load_persona_profile(persona_name);

  // Apply persona profile to voice output and language processing
  apply_persona_settings(persona_profile);
}

// Main Loop:
while (true) {
  biofeedback_data = get_biofeedback_data();
  active_persona = determine_active_persona(biofeedback_data);

  if (current_active_persona != active_persona) {
    activate_persona(active_persona);
    current_active_persona = active_persona;
  }

  process_user_input();
}
