## Adaptive Multi-Hop Mesh for Low-Latency Streaming

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic frequency/connection selection beyond a direct device-to-DVR link to create a self-healing, multi-hop mesh network. This addresses scenarios where direct connectivity is poor, or interference is high, by leveraging other devices within range as relays.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   All streaming devices (TVs, phones, tablets) and DVRs must support 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) or later for MU-MIMO and OFDMA capabilities.
    *   Each device includes a directional antenna array (software-defined beamforming) to optimize signal strength and reduce interference.
    *   Dedicated hardware acceleration for mesh routing calculations and encryption/decryption.

*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Mesh Protocol:** A modified version of OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) or BATMAN-adv optimized for low-latency streaming.  Prioritization of UDP packets with Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) headers.
    *   **Link Quality Assessment:** Continuous monitoring of signal strength, throughput, latency, and packet loss for all available links.  Incorporates a 'per-stream' quality metric, prioritizing paths that meet the minimum requirements for the currently playing content (resolution, bitrate).
    *   **Dynamic Path Selection:**  Algorithm to calculate the optimal path between streaming device and DVR, considering link quality, hop count, and available bandwidth.  Path recalculation triggered by link failures, congestion, or significant changes in link quality.
    *   **Centralized Coordinator (Optional):** A low-power device (e.g., smart hub) that can act as a coordinator for the mesh network.  Provides a central point for network management and configuration.  Not required for operation.
    *   **Seamless Handover:** Algorithm to seamlessly switch between different paths during playback without interruption.  Buffering of video data on both the streaming device and the DVR to minimize playback disruptions.
    *   **Security:** WPA3 encryption with unique per-hop keys to protect data in transit.  Authentication of all devices in the mesh network.

*   **Pseudocode (Path Selection Algorithm):**

```
function selectPath(streamingDevice, dvr):
  availablePaths = findPaths(streamingDevice, dvr)
  bestPath = null
  highestScore = -1

  for path in availablePaths:
    score = calculatePathScore(path)
    if score > highestScore:
      highestScore = score
      bestPath = path

  return bestPath

function calculatePathScore(path):
  score = 0
  for link in path.links:
    score += link.signalStrength * 0.5
    score += 1.0 / link.latency * 0.3
    score += 1.0 / link.packetLoss * 0.2

  return score
```

*   **Operational Flow:**
    1.  Streaming device initiates discovery of nearby devices (DVR, other streaming devices).
    2.  Each device broadcasts its capabilities and link quality information.
    3.  Streaming device builds a network topology map based on received information.
    4.  Algorithm calculates the optimal path to the DVR.
    5.  Data is routed through the mesh network.
    6.  Continuous monitoring of link quality and dynamic path recalculation.

*   **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Integration with AI/ML algorithms to predict link quality and proactively adjust paths.
    *   Support for multiple concurrent streams.
    *   Quality of Service (QoS) prioritization for different types of traffic.
    *   Automated mesh network optimization and self-healing.
