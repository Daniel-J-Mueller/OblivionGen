## Dynamic Frequency Allocation & Interference Cancellation Mesh

**Concept:** Expand upon the multi-radio capability of the described device to create a self-optimizing mesh network that dynamically allocates frequency bands based on real-time interference and demand. This aims to improve throughput and reliability, especially in dense deployments or environments with significant RF noise.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each device (node) to include at least four software-defined radios (SDRs), capable of operating across a broad spectrum (e.g., 400 MHz â€“ 6 GHz).
    *   Each SDR must have independent transmit/receive chains and configurable channel bandwidths.
    *   High-performance processing unit capable of real-time spectrum analysis and signal processing.
    *   Dedicated hardware accelerator for Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) and digital signal processing.
    *   Multiple antennas per SDR to support MIMO and beamforming techniques.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**

    1.  **Continuous Spectrum Monitoring:** Each node continuously scans the RF spectrum, identifying occupied channels and sources of interference (noise, other networks, etc.). This uses FFT analysis and signal identification algorithms.
    2.  **Interference Mapping:** Nodes share interference data with neighboring nodes to create a localized interference map. This information is aggregated to create a network-wide map.
    3.  **Dynamic Channel Assignment:** Based on the interference map and current traffic load, a central controller (or distributed algorithm) assigns channels to each link in the mesh.  Priority is given to minimizing interference and maximizing throughput.
    4.  **Adaptive Frequency Hopping:**  To mitigate intermittent interference, links can employ frequency hopping schemes. The hopping sequence is determined by the interference map and traffic patterns.
    5.  **Beamforming and MIMO:**  Utilize beamforming and MIMO techniques to focus signals towards intended recipients and improve signal quality.
    6.  **Link Quality Assessment:** Each node continuously monitors the quality of its links (signal strength, error rate, latency) and adjusts its transmission parameters accordingly.
    7.  **Distributed Algorithm:** A distributed algorithm should exist whereby nodes automatically negotiate channel allocations and hopping patterns without the need for central control. This improves scalability and resilience.
    8.  **Traffic Prioritization:** Implement Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms to prioritize different types of traffic (e.g., video streaming, voice calls).

*   **Pseudocode (Distributed Channel Allocation):**

    ```
    Node.init() {
      scan_spectrum()
      create_interference_map()
    }

    Node.negotiate_channel(neighbor) {
      request_channel_options(neighbor) // Request preferred/available channels
      receive_channel_options(neighbor)
      calculate_best_channel(neighbor) // Based on interference map and traffic
      send_channel_agreement(neighbor)
      if (agreement_reached) {
        switch_to_channel()
      } else {
        repeat_negotiation()
      }
    }

    Node.monitor_link() {
      calculate_link_quality()
      if (link_quality < threshold) {
        trigger_renegotiation()
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Data Exchange Protocol:**  Develop a lightweight, efficient protocol for exchanging interference maps, channel assignments, and link quality data between nodes. UDP multicast or a custom protocol could be used.

*   **Security:** Implement robust security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and interference. Encryption and authentication protocols should be used.
