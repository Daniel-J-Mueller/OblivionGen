## Adaptive Resolution Streaming with Predictive Region Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic representation approach by incorporating predictive analytics to *proactively* adjust streaming resolution not just *within* regions, but *between* regions, anticipating user focus *before* eye-tracking or direct interaction. This moves beyond reactive prioritization based on existing data to a predictive model influencing the entire stream.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Components:**

*   **Client System:** Standard endpoint device (PC, Thin Client, Mobile).  Includes standard video decoding hardware.
*   **Server System:**  High-performance server cluster with GPU acceleration. Hosts the virtual computing environment.
*   **Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE):** A machine learning model, trained on aggregated user behavior data (eye-tracking patterns, mouse movements, application usage, time of day, user role, etc.).  Lives *between* Client and Server.  Could be cloud-based.
*   **Region Definition Module (RDM):** Software module on the Server responsible for dynamically dividing the screen into parseable regions (as in the original patent).

**II. Data Flow & Operation:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collection:** The Client System anonymously collects behavioral data (mouse position, application focus, keyboard input timings, if enabled and consented to).  This data is preprocessed and sent to the PAE.
2.  **Predictive Modeling:** The PAE analyzes the behavioral data and generates a “Focus Probability Map” (FPM). The FPM assigns a probability score (0.0 – 1.0) to each region defined by the RDM, representing the likelihood of user focus within a short time window (e.g., 100ms – 500ms).
3.  **Resolution Allocation:**  The Server receives the FPM from the PAE. Based on the FPM scores, the Server dynamically allocates resolution *across* regions. High-probability regions are allocated higher resolution (more bandwidth), while low-probability regions are allocated lower resolution. This isn't simply about prioritizing text over images; it’s about allocating resources *before* the user looks at something.
4.  **Streaming & Encoding:** The Server encodes the screen data into streams. Each region is encoded with its allocated resolution. Encoding format is H.264 or AV1.
5.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** The system *continuously* monitors user behavior and updates the FPM. If user focus shifts unexpectedly, the resolution allocation is adjusted in real-time.
6.  **Region Independence:**  Regions must remain independently parsable. Lower-resolution regions may utilize aggressive compression or simplified rendering to minimize bandwidth usage.
7.  **Buffering Strategy:** Regions with predicted low-probability but high visual complexity (e.g., a detailed background image) may have content buffered *predictively* even before being fully rendered.

**III. Pseudocode (Server-Side Resolution Allocation):**

```
function AllocateResolution(FocusProbabilityMap, TotalBandwidth):
  regions = GetRegions() // Defined by RDM
  total_probability = sum(region.probability for region in regions)

  for region in regions:
    region.bandwidth = (region.probability / total_probability) * TotalBandwidth
    region.resolution = CalculateResolution(region.bandwidth) // Function determines resolution based on bandwidth

  return regions
```

**IV. Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Resolution Allocation:** Moves beyond reactive prioritization to *predictive* allocation, optimizing bandwidth usage before user interaction.
*   **Combined Behavioral Analysis:** Leverages a broader range of behavioral data (mouse, keyboard, application usage) for more accurate predictions.
*   **Adaptive Buffering:** Predictive buffering of complex content in low-probability regions reduces latency and improves user experience.
*   **Scalability:** System designed to scale with large numbers of concurrent users by distributing the PAE and encoding tasks across a cluster.
