## Personalized Temporal Content Stacks

**Concept:** Leverage historical browsing data to create dynamically updating "content stacks" presented to the user, blending historical context with current information. These aren’t simple recommendations, but layered displays mirroring user’s cognitive patterns over time.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Historical Navigation Capture:**  Record all user interactions (URLs visited, time spent, scroll depth, clicks, form submissions) and associated metadata (time of day, location if permitted, device type).
*   **Content Snapshotting:** At defined intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes, upon page completion), capture a full-page screenshot and textual content of visited webpages.  Store these as immutable “content snapshots”.  Also record DOM structure.
*   **Temporal Segmentation:** Divide browsing history into logical segments based on user activity patterns.  Algorithms detect “sessions” – periods of focused browsing –  and “context switches” – transitions between topics.  A session might be defined as >5 minutes of activity on a related cluster of URLs.
*   **Semantic Analysis:** Employ NLP to extract key concepts and entities from both the content snapshots and the URLs.  Create a semantic graph representing user interests.
*   **“Cognitive Resonance” Score:**  Develop a metric (Cognitive Resonance) indicating how strongly a current webpage aligns with a user’s historical browsing patterns *at a specific point in time*. This is not a simple match; it considers the *sequence* of topics and the user’s engagement levels within those topics.  A webpage visited after researching ‘quantum physics’ will have a higher resonance if it links to relevant theoretical concepts than to unrelated news headlines.

**2. Content Stack Generation:**

*   **Stack Structure:** A vertical (or horizontally scrollable) display of content fragments. Each fragment represents a snapshot from the user's browsing history *or* current, real-time content.
*   **Temporal Ordering:** Content fragments are ordered chronologically, but weighted by the Cognitive Resonance score. Recent, highly resonant content appears prominently.
*   **Fragment Types:**
    *   *Historical Snapshots:* Full-page screenshots, or reduced-size previews, linked to the original content.
    *   *Real-time Content:* Current webpages visited by the user.
    *   *“Echo” Fragments:*  AI-generated content that ‘echoes’ past interests.  For example, if a user researched ‘ancient Rome’ a week ago, an Echo Fragment might display a current article about a new archaeological discovery in Italy.
*   **Stack Layers:** Multiple stacks can be displayed simultaneously, representing different facets of the user's interests (e.g., Work, Personal, Hobbies).

**3. User Interaction & Adaptation:**

*   **“Focus” Mode:** The user can "focus" on a specific fragment, expanding it to full-screen and temporarily hiding the rest of the stack.
*   **“Drift” Function:** The user can “drift” through the stack, smoothly transitioning between fragments. The system learns from these drifts to refine the Cognitive Resonance algorithm.
*   **“Seed” Input:**  The user can “seed” the stack with a new topic or URL, triggering a reorganization of the content.
*   **Dynamic Re-weighting:** The Cognitive Resonance algorithm continuously adapts to user behavior, giving more weight to recent activity and user-initiated actions.

**Pseudocode (Core Stack Generation):**

```
function generate_content_stack(user_id, current_url):
  history = get_browsing_history(user_id)
  recent_history = history[last_N_items]

  stack = []
  for item in recent_history:
    resonance_score = calculate_cognitive_resonance(item.url, current_url, user_id)
    stack.append({
      "url": item.url,
      "snapshot": item.snapshot,
      "resonance": resonance_score
    })

  # Add current URL to the stack
  stack.append({
    "url": current_url,
    "snapshot": capture_current_page(),
    "resonance": 1.0 // Maximum resonance for current page
  })

  # Sort stack by resonance score (descending) and timestamp (ascending)
  stack.sort(key = lambda x: (-x["resonance"], x["timestamp"]))

  return stack
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Personalized Information Dashboard:** A dynamic home page that anticipates user needs.
*   **Contextual Search:** Search results are presented within the context of the user's browsing history.
*   **Enhanced Learning:** Students can revisit past research and connect it to new information.
*   **Creative Inspiration:** Artists and writers can draw inspiration from their past work.
