## Adaptive Key Rotation Based on Video Content Analysis

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

The system extends the on-demand key issuance described in the provided patent by dynamically adjusting key rotation frequency based on real-time analysis of the video content being transmitted.  Instead of fixed or request-driven rotations, key changes are triggered by detected events *within* the video stream.

**II. Components:**

*   **Video Analysis Engine (VAE):**  A module integrated with the video processing service. This engine analyzes video frames for specific events or characteristics.  Examples:
    *   **Scene Changes:**  Sudden shifts in visual content.
    *   **Motion Intensity:**  The amount of movement within a frame (high motion = potential security risk).
    *   **Object Detection:** Identifying sensitive objects (e.g., faces, license plates, documents).
    *   **Content Classification:** Categorizing video content (e.g., live sports, security footage, personal video).
*   **Risk Assessment Module (RAM):**  Evaluates the output from the VAE and assigns a risk score to the current video segment.
*   **Key Rotation Controller (KRC):**  Determines when to request new encryption/decryption keys from the Key Management Service (KMS) based on the risk score.
*   **Key Management Service (KMS):** (Existing component – leveraged from the base patent).  Responsible for generating and distributing cryptographic keys.
*   **Video Encoding Device:** (Existing component – leveraged from the base patent).
*   **Video Transport Service:** (Existing component – leveraged from the base patent).

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Connection:**  The system initiates the connection as described in the base patent, obtaining initial encryption/decryption keys.
2.  **Real-time Video Analysis:** As the video stream is processed, the VAE continuously analyzes video frames.
3.  **Risk Score Calculation:** The RAM evaluates the VAE output and calculates a risk score.  Higher scores indicate a greater potential security concern. Example risk score metrics:
    *   **Scene Change Frequency:** Rapid scene changes increase the risk.
    *   **Motion Intensity:** High motion increases the risk.
    *   **Sensitive Object Detection:** Detection of faces or documents significantly increases the risk.
    *   **Content Category:**  Certain categories (e.g., financial transactions) have higher base risk.
4.  **Adaptive Key Rotation:**
    *   The KRC monitors the risk score.
    *   If the risk score exceeds a predefined threshold, the KRC requests new encryption/decryption keys from the KMS.
    *   The KMS generates the new keys.
    *   The KRC distributes the new encryption key to the video encoding device and the new decryption key to the video transport service.
    *   The video encoding device begins encrypting the video stream using the new key.
    *   The video transport service begins decrypting the video stream using the new key.
5.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors the risk score and adjusts key rotation frequency as needed.
6.  **Risk Score Decay:** Implement a decay function for the risk score.  If no significant events are detected for a period, the risk score decreases, and key rotation frequency slows down.

**IV. Pseudocode (Key Rotation Controller):**

```
function KeyRotationController(riskScoreThreshold, decayRate) {
  currentRiskScore = 0;

  while (videoStreamActive) {
    newRiskScoreEvent = VAE.getRiskScoreEvent();
    currentRiskScore += newRiskScoreEvent;
    currentRiskScore = max(0, currentRiskScore - decayRate); // Decay the score

    if (currentRiskScore > riskScoreThreshold) {
      requestNewKeys();
      currentRiskScore = 0; // Reset the score after key rotation
    }
  }
}

function requestNewKeys() {
  encryptionKey = KMS.generateEncryptionKey();
  decryptionKey = KMS.generateDecryptionKey();

  sendEncryptionKeyToEncodingDevice(encryptionKey);
  sendDecryptionKeyToTransportService(decryptionKey);
}
```

**V. Key Considerations:**

*   **Computational Cost:** Real-time video analysis can be computationally expensive. Optimize the VAE algorithms to minimize latency.
*   **Threshold Tuning:**  Carefully tune the risk score threshold to balance security and performance.
*   **Scalability:**  The system must be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent video streams.
*   **False Positives:** Minimize false positives in the video analysis to avoid unnecessary key rotations.
*   **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with existing key management infrastructure.
