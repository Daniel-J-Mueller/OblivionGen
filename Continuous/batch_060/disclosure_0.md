## Dynamic Order Visualization with Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Extend the message audit trail feature into a spatial, augmented reality (AR) experience accessible via a mobile device. Instead of solely relying on text-based communication and order details within a browser interface, the system overlays order information *directly onto* the physical items being ordered or related to the order.

**Specifications:**

**1. AR Order Anchor Generation:**

*   Upon order creation (or at user request), the system generates a unique AR "anchor" linked to the order. This anchor is a digital reference point tied to either:
    *   The physical products themselves (if already in the user's possession, using image recognition/object detection).
    *   A representative image provided by the merchant (for pre-order items or services).
    *   A designated “staging area” within the user’s environment (e.g., a specific room or tabletop, defined by the user through the AR interface).
*   Anchor data is stored in a cloud database accessible through a dedicated mobile application.

**2. Mobile Application Integration:**

*   The mobile application (iOS and Android) utilizes ARKit/ARCore to recognize and track the AR anchor within the user’s camera view.
*   Upon successful anchor detection, the application overlays dynamic order information onto the physical scene.

**3. Dynamic AR Overlay Content:**

*   **Message Bubbles:** Recent messages between buyer and merchant are displayed as 3D “bubbles” emanating from the products or the anchor point. Bubbles visually indicate message sender (buyer/merchant) and display a truncated message preview. Tapping a bubble expands the full message thread.
*   **Negotiated Term Highlighting:** Key negotiated terms (e.g., price, quantity, delivery date) are visually overlaid onto the product itself. The system uses color-coding or animated highlighting to draw attention to specific terms.
*   **Progress Indicators:**  Order progress (e.g., “processing,” “shipped,” “delivered”) is displayed via a visual progress bar or animated icon overlaid on the product or staging area.
*   **Interactive Component Views:** For assembled products, users can view exploded diagrams or 3D models within the AR environment, linked to specific messages related to assembly or customization.
*   **"What-If" Scenarios:**  Allow the user to visually simulate changes to the order (e.g., adding an item, changing a color) and see the impact on the total price and delivery date in real-time within the AR view.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Order Management System (OMS):** Existing system. Responsible for managing orders, messages, and negotiated terms.
*   **AR Data Service:** New service. Responsible for:
    *   Storing AR anchor data.
    *   Generating and managing dynamic AR overlay content.
    *   Providing an API for the mobile application to access AR data.
*   **Mobile Application:** iOS and Android. Utilizes ARKit/ARCore for AR tracking and rendering. Communicates with the AR Data Service via API.

**5. Pseudocode (Mobile App - Message Display):**

```
function onAnchorDetected(anchorData) {
  // Load anchor data (product ID, message thread ID, negotiated terms)

  // Fetch latest messages from message thread via API
  messages = api.getMessageThread(messageThreadID)

  // For each message in messages:
  //   Create 3D message bubble
  //   Set bubble text to message preview
  //   Set bubble color based on sender (buyer/merchant)
  //   Position bubble near product/anchor point
  //   Attach tap event handler to bubble
  //       - On tap: display full message thread in a separate UI panel
}

function updateNegotiatedTerms(terms) {
    // For each term in terms:
    //   Highlight corresponding feature on the physical product 
    //   Display relevant details with animated text
}
```
