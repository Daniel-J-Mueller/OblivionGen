## Secure Proxy-Based Dynamic Sharding & Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the secure proxy's endpoint resolution capabilities to dynamically shard application traffic across multiple, geographically distributed instances of a service *before* the traffic even reaches those instances. This isn’t just about finding *an* IP address, it’s about actively routing traffic to the *best* instance *at that moment*, based on real-time performance, geographic proximity, and security posture.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** ShardResolver Module (integrated into existing Secure Proxy)
*   **Input:** Application Request (includes endpoint/service identifier)
*   **Output:** Modified Request (includes selected shard/instance IP address *and* associated security context)
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ShardInfo`: {shardID, instanceIP, geographicLocation, currentLoad, securityScore, healthStatus}
    *   `PolicyContext`: {encryptionLevel, authenticationMethod, accessControlList}
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Receive Application Request.
    2.  Query Endpoint Resolver for available `ShardInfo` records matching the requested service.
    3.  Apply policies based on request characteristics and `ShardInfo` data. Prioritize shards with:
        *   Lowest latency (geographic proximity).
        *   Highest security score (based on real-time threat intelligence).
        *   Lowest current load.
    4.  Select the optimal shard.
    5.  Augment the Application Request with:
        *   Selected shard’s IP address.
        *   Associated `PolicyContext` (e.g., encryption keys, access tokens).
    6.  Forward modified request to the selected shard.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   `PolicyContext` must be digitally signed to prevent tampering.
    *   Shard selection algorithm must be resistant to manipulation.
    *   Real-time threat intelligence feeds must be validated and trusted.
*   **API Extensions:**
    *   `ShardResolver.GetShardInfo(serviceID)`: Returns a list of available shards.
    *   `ShardResolver.EvaluateShard(shardInfo, request)`: Evaluates a shard based on a request.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function ResolveShard(request):
  shardList = GetAvailableShards(request.serviceID)
  filteredShards = FilterShards(shardList, request.policies) //apply initial policies

  bestShard = null
  bestScore = -1

  for shard in filteredShards:
    score = CalculateShardScore(shard, request) //based on latency, security, load
    if score > bestScore:
      bestScore = score
      bestShard = shard

  if bestShard != null:
    request.destinationIP = bestShard.instanceIP
    request.securityContext = bestShard.securityContext //including encryption keys
    return request
  else:
    //Handle failure: return error or use default shard
    return error
```

**Novelty:** This shifts the load balancing paradigm *before* traditional load balancers, using the secure proxy as a proactive traffic director. The integration of security context *at the point of routing* is also new, allowing for fine-grained security enforcement based on shard characteristics. It moves beyond simply finding an IP to *actively shaping* the traffic flow.
