## Adaptive Constraint Propagation with Predictive Locking

**Concept:** Extend the existing write tracking mechanism to *predict* potential cross-page conflicts *before* the write is even initiated, leveraging a learned model of database access patterns. This allows for proactive locking or pre-fetching of dependent pages, reducing transaction aborts and improving concurrency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Conflict Prediction Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., a graph neural network) trained on historical transaction logs. This model learns relationships between modified pages and potentially conflicting dependent pages (e.g., those involved in foreign key relationships, indexing, or application-level constraints). Input: Set of modified pages, transaction type. Output: Probability distribution over potentially conflicting pages.
*   **Conflict Prediction Cache:** A local cache within each database engine node storing the most recent predictions for common transactions and page sets. This minimizes the need for repeated model evaluations.
*   **Adaptive Lock Granularity Map:** A per-transaction map indicating the optimal lock granularity for dependent pages. This is dynamically adjusted based on the conflict prediction probability and the estimated contention level.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Write Intent Declaration:** Before initiating a write transaction, the database engine node declares its intent and the pages it intends to modify.
2.  **Conflict Prediction:** The node queries the Conflict Prediction Model (or its cache) with the set of modified pages. The model outputs a probability distribution over potentially conflicting pages.
3.  **Lock Granularity Determination:** Based on the prediction probabilities, the node determines the appropriate lock granularity for each potentially conflicting page. Options include:
    *   **No Lock:** If the probability is below a threshold, no lock is acquired.
    *   **Row Lock:** Acquire a lock on the specific rows involved in the potential conflict.
    *   **Page Lock:** Acquire a lock on the entire page.
    *   **Pre-Fetch:** Asynchronously read the page into cache.
4.  **Lock Acquisition/Pre-Fetch:** Acquire the necessary locks or initiate pre-fetching of dependent pages.
5.  **Write Execution:** Execute the write transaction.
6.  **Lock Release:** Release locks upon transaction completion.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
function executeWrite(transaction, modifiedPages) {
  conflictPredictions = getConflictPredictions(modifiedPages)
  lockGranularityMap = determineLockGranularity(conflictPredictions)

  for (page, granularity in lockGranularityMap) {
    if (granularity == "row") {
      acquireRowLock(page)
    } else if (granularity == "page") {
      acquirePageLock(page)
    } else if (granularity == "prefetch") {
      prefetchPage(page)
    }
  }

  executeTransaction(transaction)

  releaseLocks(lockGranularityMap)
}

function getConflictPredictions(modifiedPages) {
  // Check local cache first
  predictions = checkCache(modifiedPages)
  if (predictions != null) {
    return predictions
  }

  // If not in cache, query the model
  predictions = conflictPredictionModel.predict(modifiedPages)
  updateCache(modifiedPages, predictions)
  return predictions
}
```

**4.  Considerations:**

*   **Model Training:** The Conflict Prediction Model must be regularly retrained with updated transaction logs to maintain accuracy.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** The Conflict Prediction Cache needs a strategy to invalidate stale predictions.
*   **False Positives:** There will be false positives (predicting conflicts that don't occur). The system should minimize the impact of these false positives on performance.
*   **Lock Escalation:** Implement a mechanism for lock escalation (e.g., from row locks to page locks) to reduce lock contention.
*   **Integration with Existing Write Tracking:** This system can be integrated with the existing write tracking mechanism to provide a layered approach to conflict detection. The write tracker would still be used as a fallback for conflicts that are not predicted by the model.
