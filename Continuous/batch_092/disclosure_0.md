## Adaptive Notification Escalation & Contextual Risk Scoring

**Specification:** A system that dynamically adjusts notification delivery methods and escalation pathways based on a real-time contextual risk score derived from user behavior, device characteristics, and modification type.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on a time-based window for cancellation/reversion. This builds on that by introducing *proactive* adaptation of notification delivery *before* a time window expires, based on increasing suspicion.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Analytics Engine:** Monitors user actions (login location, spending patterns, modification frequency, time of day, etc.).
*   **Device Fingerprinting Module:** Captures device characteristics (OS, browser, IP address, geolocation, hardware details).
*   **Modification Type Classifier:** Categorizes modifications (password reset, payment method change, security question update, communication channel alteration) and assigns inherent risk levels.
*   **Contextual Risk Scoring Algorithm:** Combines behavioral, device, and modification type data to generate a dynamic risk score. This isnâ€™t a simple sum; weighted factors are applied.  High scores indicate elevated risk.
*   **Adaptive Notification Manager:**  Based on the risk score, selects the optimal notification pathway and escalation strategy.
*   **Notification Channels:** Existing (email, SMS, push notifications) plus potentially new (voice calls, in-app biometric authentication requests).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Notification Manager):**

```
FUNCTION HandleModificationRequest(modificationRequest, userAccount)

  riskScore = CalculateRiskScore(userAccount, modificationRequest)

  IF riskScore < 20 THEN
    // Low Risk - Standard Notification
    SendNotification(userAccount, modificationRequest, channel="email")
    SetReversionWindow(userAccount, 60 seconds) //Standard window
  ELSE IF riskScore >= 20 AND riskScore < 50 THEN
    // Medium Risk - Multi-Factor Notification & Reduced Window
    SendNotification(userAccount, modificationRequest, channel="push_notification")
    SendNotification(userAccount, modificationRequest, channel="sms")
    SetReversionWindow(userAccount, 30 seconds)
  ELSE IF riskScore >= 50 AND riskScore < 80 THEN
    // High Risk - Urgent Notification & Biometric Challenge
    SendNotification(userAccount, modificationRequest, channel="push_notification", urgency="high")
    TriggerBiometricChallenge(userAccount) //Requires fingerprint/face scan via app
    SetReversionWindow(userAccount, 10 seconds)
  ELSE // riskScore >= 80
    // Critical Risk - Block Modification, Initiate Manual Review
    BlockModification(modificationRequest)
    FlagForManualReview(userAccount, modificationRequest)
    NotifySecurityTeam()

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION TriggerBiometricChallenge(userAccount)
    //Send push notification requesting biometric authentication.
    //Modification is held until biometric authentication is confirmed.
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateRiskScore(userAccount, modificationRequest)
    //Gather data: User behavior, device fingerprint, modification type
    //Apply weighted factors to each data point.
    //Return aggregated risk score.
END FUNCTION
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Machine Learning Integration:**  The weighting factors in the `CalculateRiskScore` function should be continuously refined through machine learning, adapting to evolving threat patterns.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** The thresholds (20, 50, 80) are configurable and adjustable based on security policies.
*   **Audit Logging:**  All notification events and risk score calculations should be logged for auditing and analysis.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Device fingerprinting should be implemented in a privacy-respecting manner, minimizing data collection and adhering to relevant regulations.
