## Dynamic Cache Partitioning with AI-Driven Prediction

**Concept:** Implement a dynamic cache partitioning system that leverages machine learning to predict potential side-channel attack vectors *before* they manifest, proactively adjusting cache slice allocations to mitigate risk. This builds on the existing concept of cache slices but introduces intelligent, predictive allocation rather than reactive relocation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Cache Monitoring Unit (CMU):** Dedicated hardware unit integrated with the shared cache controller. Responsible for:
    *   Real-time monitoring of cache access patterns (read, write, evictions) for each VM.
    *   Collection of metadata: VM ID, memory address, timestamp, access type.
    *   High-speed data transfer to the AI Prediction Engine.
*   **AI Prediction Engine (AIPE):** A dedicated processing unit (FPGA, dedicated ASIC, or powerful CPU core) responsible for running the machine learning models.
*   **Reconfigurable Interconnect:**  High-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect between CMU, AIPE, and the cache controller to facilitate rapid communication and reconfiguration.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **ML Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) or Transformer model trained on historical cache access data.  The model learns to predict:
    *   Probability of cross-VM cache collisions based on access patterns.
    *   Likelihood of specific side-channel attack vectors (e.g., Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload).
    *   “Attack Surface” – A metric representing the overall risk level for each VM.
*   **Cache Manager:** A software component running within the VMM responsible for:
    *   Receiving risk predictions from the AIPE.
    *   Dynamically adjusting cache slice allocations based on the predicted risk levels.
    *   Implementing policies for allocating and reclaiming cache slices.
    *   Exposing APIs for monitoring and configuration.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Data Collection:** The CMU continuously monitors cache access patterns for each VM and collects relevant metadata.
2.  **Feature Extraction:**  Metadata is preprocessed and transformed into features suitable for the ML model.  Features might include:
    *   Cache miss rates per VM.
    *   Frequency of access to shared memory regions.
    *   Temporal correlations in access patterns.
    *   Entropy of memory access distributions.
3.  **Risk Prediction:** The ML model uses the extracted features to predict the probability of side-channel attacks and the overall “Attack Surface” for each VM.
4.  **Dynamic Allocation:** The Cache Manager receives the risk predictions and adjusts cache slice allocations accordingly.
    *   VMs with high predicted risk receive larger cache slice allocations.
    *   VMs with low predicted risk receive smaller cache slice allocations.
    *   Allocation adjustments are made in real-time to proactively mitigate risk.
5.  **Model Retraining:** The ML model is periodically retrained using new data to improve its accuracy and adapt to changing workloads.

**4. Pseudocode (Cache Manager - Allocation Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_cache_allocation(vm_id, predicted_risk):
  current_allocation = get_cache_allocation(vm_id)
  target_allocation = calculate_target_allocation(predicted_risk)

  if target_allocation > current_allocation:
    allocate_additional_slices(vm_id, target_allocation - current_allocation)
  else if target_allocation < current_allocation:
    reclaim_slices(vm_id, current_allocation - target_allocation)

  log_allocation_change(vm_id, current_allocation, target_allocation)

function calculate_target_allocation(predicted_risk):
  // Scale predicted risk to a cache slice allocation size
  // Example: linear scaling, logarithmic scaling, etc.
  target_allocation = predicted_risk * scaling_factor + base_allocation
  return min(target_allocation, max_allocation)
```

**5. Advanced Considerations:**

*   **Attack Vector Identification:** Train the ML model to identify *specific* attack vectors being attempted, allowing for more targeted mitigation strategies.
*   **Adversarial Training:** Incorporate adversarial training techniques to improve the robustness of the ML model against evasion attempts.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:** Explore the use of differential privacy or federated learning to protect the privacy of cache access data during model training.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Optimize the ML model and data processing pipeline for execution on dedicated hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs).
