## Secure Delegation with Ephemeral Key Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the pre-generated request/key system to support *delegated* operations where the initial requestor doesn't directly perform the operation, but a trusted intermediary does, using a newly generated, ephemeral key derived from the original request key. This adds a layer of indirection and mitigates risk if the intermediary is compromised.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Derivation Module (KDM):**

*   **Input:** Original cryptographic key (from the request), a delegation policy (defining authorized intermediaries), a request context (timestamp, originating entity, operation type).
*   **Process:**
    *   Uses a Key Derivation Function (KDF) – Argon2id recommended – with the original key, delegation policy, and request context as inputs.
    *   Outputs an ephemeral key (EK). The EK’s lifespan is determined by the request context (e.g., valid for 60 seconds).
    *   The delegation policy specifies which entities are authorized to receive and use the EK.  Policy can be based on digital certificates or other verifiable credentials.
*   **Output:** Ephemeral Key (EK), Delegation Proof (DP). The DP is a digitally signed assertion confirming the EK was legitimately derived.

**2.  Request Orchestration Service (ROS):**

*   **Input:**  Original Request (containing the original key), Delegation Proof (DP), Operation Request (details of the operation to be performed).
*   **Process:**
    *   Verifies the DP against a trusted authority.
    *   If DP is valid, ROS securely transmits the EK to the authorized intermediary.
    *   Intermediary performs the requested operation using the EK.
    *   ROS logs the operation and its outcome.
*   **Output:** Operation Result.

**3.  Secure Communication Protocol (SCP):**

*   **Purpose:** Securely transmit the EK from ROS to the intermediary.
*   **Implementation:**  Mutual TLS with certificate pinning, combined with an ephemeral session key derived using a Diffie-Hellman exchange.
*   **Features:** Forward secrecy, integrity protection, and authentication.

**Pseudocode (ROS – simplified):**

```
function handleRequest(request, dp) {
  if (!verifyDelegationProof(dp)) {
    logError("Invalid Delegation Proof");
    return errorResponse("Unauthorized");
  }

  ek = deriveEphemeralKey(request.originalKey, request.delegationPolicy, request.requestContext);

  securelyTransmitEK(ek, authorizedIntermediary);

  operationResult = await authorizedIntermediary.performOperation(ek, request.operationDetails);

  logOperation(operationResult);

  return operationResult;
}
```

**Innovation Notes:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Limits the exposure of the original key. Compromise of the intermediary only reveals the short-lived EK.
*   **Delegation Control:** Enables fine-grained control over who can perform operations on behalf of the requestor.
*   **Auditing:**  Detailed logging of all operations and key usage for accountability.
*   **Scalability:** KDM and ROS can be deployed as microservices for horizontal scaling.
