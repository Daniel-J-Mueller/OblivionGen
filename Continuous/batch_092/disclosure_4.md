## Adaptive Bioluminescent Doorbell

**Concept:** A doorbell system integrating bioluminescent bacterial cultures within a transparent housing. Illumination intensity and color shift dynamically based on proximity and visitor identification.

**Specifications:**

*   **Housing:** Transparent, weatherproof acrylic or similar polymer. Spherical or organically shaped, approximately 15cm diameter. Internal chamber segmented into multiple reservoirs.
*   **Bacterial Cultures:** Genetically engineered *Vibrio fischeri* or similar bioluminescent bacteria. Multiple strains with varying emission wavelengths (blue, green, yellow) housed in separate reservoirs. Nutrient delivery system for sustained viability (slow-release agar gel).
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   PIR motion sensor (5m range) – initial activation.
    *   Low-resolution camera (facial recognition, 1m range) – visitor identification.
    *   Ultrasonic proximity sensor (0.1-1m range) – fine-grained distance measurement.
*   **Microfluidic Control:** A network of microfluidic channels and valves controlled by a microcontroller. Allows precise mixing of bacterial strains to alter illumination color.
*   **Illumination Control Algorithm:**
    1.  **Motion Detection:** PIR triggers initial low-level bioluminescence (pale blue).
    2.  **Proximity:** Ultrasonic sensor modulates brightness – closer proximity = brighter glow.
    3.  **Facial Recognition:**
        *   **Known Visitor:** Mix bacterial strains to produce a unique color signature associated with the individual (e.g., green for family, yellow for delivery).
        *   **Unknown Visitor:** Rapidly cycle through a spectrum of colors (alert mode).
    4.  **"Do Not Disturb" Mode:** Solid red illumination.
*   **Power Supply:** Low-voltage DC power adapter. Potential for solar power integration.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) for remote configuration and monitoring.
*   **Nutrient Replenishment:** Access port for periodic nutrient gel replacement (estimated 6-month interval).

**Pseudocode (Illumination Control):**

```
// Initialization
KNOWN_VISITORS = { //Dictionary of known faces and associated colors
    "Alice": "green",
    "Bob": "yellow",
    //...
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    if (PIR_MotionDetected()) {
        SetBaseIllumination("pale blue")
        distance = ReadUltrasonicSensor()
        brightness = Map(distance, 0, 100, 20, 100) //Map distance to brightness (0-100)
        SetBrightness(brightness)

        face = RecognizeFace()
        if (face in KNOWN_VISITORS) {
            color = KNOWN_VISITORS[face]
            SetIlluminationColor(color)
        } else {
            CycleThroughColors() //Alert mode
        }
    } else {
        SetIlluminationOff()
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integrate with smart home systems for automated actions (e.g., unlock door for known visitors).
*   Develop a mobile app for managing visitor profiles and custom illumination settings.
*   Explore different bioluminescent organisms for unique color palettes and patterns.
*   Implement a self-monitoring system to track bacterial culture health and nutrient levels.
