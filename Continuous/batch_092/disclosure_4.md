## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Profiling for Predictive Task Execution

**Concept:** Enhance the existing system by actively profiling the acoustic environment *before* user speech input, predicting likely tasks based on the scene, and pre-loading resources/data for near-instantaneous execution. This moves beyond simply recognizing *what* is said, to anticipating *what will be said* based on context.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing microphone array (from the patent).
    *   Dedicated low-power co-processor for real-time acoustic scene analysis.
    *   Increased local memory capacity for pre-loading resources.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Profiler Module:**
        *   Continuous audio capture (low volume, background level) even when no wake word is detected.
        *   Feature extraction (environmental sounds, reverb, noise profiles, etc.).
        *   Machine learning model (trained on a large dataset of acoustic scenes – home, office, car, gym, restaurant, etc.).
        *   Output: Probability distribution over possible acoustic scenes.
    *   **Predictive Task Engine:**
        *   Mapping of acoustic scenes to likely tasks (e.g., “Kitchen” -> “Timer”, “Recipe”, “Shopping List”; “Car” -> “Navigation”, “Music”, “Call”; “Office” -> “Calendar”, “Email”, “Meeting”).
        *   Priority weighting for tasks based on user history and time of day.
        *   Resource pre-loading:
            *   Relevant data (e.g., favorite radio stations, frequent contacts, calendar entries).
            *   Necessary software modules and APIs.
            *   UI elements (e.g., timer interface, navigation map).
    *   **Hybrid ASR Pipeline:**
        *   Existing ASR system with modifications.
        *   Contextual biasing: The predicted tasks from the Predictive Task Engine are used to bias the ASR, improving accuracy and reducing latency.
        *   Confidence threshold adjustment: The confidence threshold for ASR results is lowered for predicted tasks, allowing for faster recognition even with potentially imperfect audio.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Microphone captures ambient audio.
    2.  Acoustic Scene Profiler Module analyzes audio and outputs probability distribution over acoustic scenes.
    3.  Predictive Task Engine uses acoustic scene probabilities and user history to predict likely tasks.
    4.  System pre-loads resources and biases ASR for predicted tasks.
    5.  User speaks a command.
    6.  Biased ASR system recognizes command with reduced latency.
    7.  Command is executed.
    8.  System continues to monitor acoustic environment and refine task predictions.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Task Engine):**

```
function predictTasks(acousticSceneProbabilities, userHistory, timeOfDay):
  // Define a mapping of acoustic scenes to likely tasks
  sceneTaskMap = {
    "Kitchen": ["Timer", "Recipe", "Shopping List"],
    "Car": ["Navigation", "Music", "Call"],
    "Office": ["Calendar", "Email", "Meeting"]
  }

  // Calculate weighted task scores based on scene probabilities, user history, and time of day
  taskScores = {}
  for scene, tasks in sceneTaskMap.items():
    for task in tasks:
      score = acousticSceneProbabilities[scene] * userHistory[task] * timeOfDayWeight[task]
      taskScores[task] = score

  // Sort tasks by score in descending order
  sortedTasks = sort(taskScores, descending=True)

  // Return top N predicted tasks
  return sortedTasks[:3]
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond reactive speech processing to *proactive* anticipation, significantly reducing latency and improving user experience. It is not simply about recognizing speech faster, but anticipating *what* the user will say *before* they say it.
