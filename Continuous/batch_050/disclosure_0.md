## Decentralized Key Orchestration with Reputation-Based Referrals

**Concept:** Extend the referral mechanism to a decentralized network, leveraging a blockchain-based reputation system to dynamically assess and prioritize key providers. This allows for automated key rotation, load balancing, and enhanced security by avoiding reliance on a single point of failure.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Key Orchestrator (KO):** The central coordinating entity. Receives key requests, interacts with the Reputation System, and initiates key retrieval.
*   **Key Providers (KPs):** Entities holding and managing cryptographic keys. Can be HSMs, secure enclaves, or other trusted key stores.
*   **Reputation System (RS):** A blockchain-based system tracking KP performance metrics (uptime, response time, security audits, etc.).  Uses a weighted scoring algorithm to generate a reputation score.
*   **Blockchain:** Public or permissioned blockchain to store KP reputation data, audit logs, and potentially key metadata (public keys, algorithms supported).

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Key Request:** Client sends a key request to the KO, specifying the key identifier and potentially context information (encryption context).
2.  **KP Discovery:** KO queries the RS for a list of KPs capable of serving the requested key, sorted by reputation score.
3.  **Dynamic Selection:** KO selects the KP with the highest reputation score, considering factors like current load and geographic proximity.
4.  **Key Retrieval:** KO securely requests the key from the selected KP, using established authentication and authorization protocols.
5.  **Key Delivery:** KP delivers the key (or encrypted data key) to the KO.
6.  **Key Delivery to Client:** KO delivers the key to the client.
7.  **Reputation Update:**  After key delivery, the KO reports key retrieval success/failure and performance metrics (response time) to the RS, updating the KPâ€™s reputation score.

**3. Pseudocode (KO - Key Retrieval Function):**

```pseudocode
function retrieveKey(keyIdentifier, encryptionContext) {
  // 1. Query Reputation System
  kpList = ReputationSystem.getKPs(keyIdentifier) // Returns list of KPs sorted by reputation
  
  // 2. Select KP
  selectedKP = selectBestKP(kpList) // Implements logic for KP selection (load balancing, proximity)
  
  // 3. Request Key
  try {
    key = selectedKP.getKey(keyIdentifier, encryptionContext) 
    // Secure communication channel established using TLS/SSL/mTLS
    
    // 4. Log Success & Update Reputation
    ReputationSystem.updateKPReputation(selectedKP, success=true, responseTime=responseTime)
    return key
  } catch (exception) {
    // Log Failure & Update Reputation
    ReputationSystem.updateKPReputation(selectedKP, success=false, responseTime=responseTime)
    throw exception // Propagate error to caller
  }
}

function selectBestKP(kpList) {
  // Implement logic for selecting the best KP. Considerations:
  // - Reputation score
  // - Current load (e.g., number of active requests)
  // - Geographic proximity (minimize latency)
  // - Availability (check for recent outages)
  
  //Example - Simple priority by reputation
  bestKP = kpList[0]
  for (kp in kpList) {
    if (kp.reputation > bestKP.reputation){
      bestKP = kp
    }
  }
  return bestKP
}
```

**4.  Blockchain Data Structures:**

*   **KP Profile:**
    *   KP ID (Unique Identifier)
    *   Public Key (for secure communication)
    *   Supported Algorithms
    *   Reputation Score
    *   Uptime History
    *   Audit Logs (Links to external audit reports)
*   **Reputation Entry:**
    *   KP ID
    *   Timestamp
    *   Metric (e.g., response time, success/failure)
    *   Value (e.g., milliseconds, boolean)

**5.  Security Considerations:**

*   Secure communication channels (TLS/SSL/mTLS) between KO and KPs.
*   Access control mechanisms to protect sensitive data on the blockchain.
*   Regular security audits of the entire system.
*   Key rotation policies for both encryption keys and communication keys.
