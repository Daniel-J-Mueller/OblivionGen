## Personalized Predictive Filtering & "Value Decay"

**Concept:** Extend the “estimated value rating” system to not just *predict* value, but proactively *shape* recipient attention by introducing a dynamically adjusted filter based on predicted engagement and a concept of "value decay."  Instead of solely reacting to ratings, the system anticipates waning interest and subtly alters what content is even *presented* to the user, prioritizing freshness and potential for re-engagement.

**Specs:**

1.  **Attention Profile:**  Each recipient maintains an “Attention Profile” beyond just historical ratings. This profile tracks:
    *   **Content Category Affinity:**  Explicit (user selection) and implicit (rating/engagement) preference for content types (e.g., product announcements, educational articles, promotions).
    *   **Recency Bias:**  How quickly a user’s interest in a category diminishes over time.  Measured by the rate at which ratings decrease for successive emails within that category.
    *   **Novelty Preference:**  A score indicating how much the user values entirely new/unseen information vs. updates to familiar topics.
    *   **Engagement Velocity:** Rate of interaction, not just binary (opened/not opened), but time spent, clicks, shares.

2.  **Value Decay Function:** Implement a "Value Decay Function" tied to both content category *and* individual content items. 
    *   **Category Decay:**  After a set period of inactivity (no positive ratings) within a content category, the system reduces the *visibility* of new content from that category. This isn't blocking it entirely, but decreasing its probability of being selected for delivery.
    *   **Item Decay:**  Each specific email/content item has its own decay rate. Similar content is grouped into 'decay clusters.' If a user consistently ignores emails from a decay cluster, the cluster's overall decay rate accelerates.

3.  **Predictive Filtering Engine:** A machine learning model (trained on user Attention Profiles) that determines:
    *   **Content Selection Probability:**  Based on predicted value (as in the original patent) *and* Value Decay scores, the engine assigns a probability to each piece of content being delivered to a specific user.
    *   **Content Diversification:**  The engine balances predicted value with a diversification factor. This ensures the user isn’t stuck in a filter bubble, introducing occasional content from lower-probability categories to explore new interests.
    *    **"Surprise" Factor:** Introduce rare, high-novelty content items (even if predicted value is low) to occasionally break patterns and re-engage dormant interests. This is sampled from a curated "Discovery Pool."

4. **Delivery Orchestration:** 
   *  Instead of sending all relevant content, the system intelligently *batches* and *schedules* delivery based on the user's predicted availability and engagement patterns. 
   *  Content is delivered in "Interest Waves" (e.g., morning, lunchtime, evening) focused on the categories the user is most likely to be receptive to *at that time*.

**Pseudocode (Filtering Engine):**

```
function calculate_delivery_probability(user, content):
  predicted_value = calculate_predicted_value(user, content)  // Existing value calculation
  category_decay = calculate_category_decay(user, content.category)
  item_decay = calculate_item_decay(user, content)
  diversification_factor = calculate_diversification_factor(user)
  surprise_factor = calculate_surprise_factor(user, content)
  
  probability = predicted_value * (1 - category_decay) * (1 - item_decay) + diversification_factor + surprise_factor
  
  return normalize(probability)  // Ensure probability is between 0 and 1

function calculate_category_decay(user, category):
  last_positive_rating_time = get_last_positive_rating_time(user, category)
  time_since_last_rating = current_time - last_positive_rating_time
  decay_rate = get_category_decay_rate(category)  // Configurable per category
  return sigmoid(decay_rate * time_since_last_rating) // Decay from 0 to 1

function calculate_item_decay(user, content):
  // Similar logic to category decay, but based on content cluster
  // Tracks how often the user ignores emails from similar sources/topics
  return sigmoid(decay_rate * time_since_last_interaction)

function calculate_surprise_factor(user, content):
  if content is in Discovery Pool:
    return low_probability_boost // small chance to bypass all other factors

  return 0
```

**Potential Impact:**  Move beyond simple prediction to actively shape user attention and prevent "email fatigue."  Increase engagement by delivering the *right* content at the *right* time, tailored to the user's evolving interests and sensitivities. This could be expanded to any information stream, not just email.
