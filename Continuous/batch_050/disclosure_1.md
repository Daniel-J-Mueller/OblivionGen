## Adaptive Deletion Granularity

**Concept:** Instead of solely operating on ranges defined by rows (as the provided patent appears to focus on), introduce a system where deletion granularity dynamically adapts based on data access patterns and storage node load. This allows for more efficient deletion handling and potentially avoids unnecessary tombstone proliferation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Partitioning with Access Metadata:**  Each data item (or small block of data) is associated with access metadata. This metadata tracks:
    *   Last Access Timestamp
    *   Access Frequency (rolling window)
    *   Node Location (which storage node currently holds the data)

2.  **Deletion Request Analysis:** Upon receiving a deletion request (covering a range of rows), the system analyzes the access metadata of the affected data items.
    *   **Hot Data:** Items with high access frequency are *not* immediately tombstoned. Instead, a 'soft delete' flag is set. This flag indicates the data is logically deleted but physically remains until the next access. On access, the system retrieves the data and marks it as truly deleted.
    *   **Warm Data:** Items with moderate access frequency receive a standard tombstone.
    *   **Cold Data:** Items with low/no access frequency receive an immediate physical deletion (if possible, based on storage type/capabilities) or a highly compressed tombstone record.

3.  **Dynamic Tombstone Aggregation:** Tombstones are aggregated *not* solely by range, but also by access metadata.  This creates 'deletion cohorts' â€“ groups of tombstones representing logically deleted items with similar access characteristics.

4.  **Cohort-Based Compaction:** A background compaction process operates on these deletion cohorts. 
    *   Cohorts containing primarily 'hot' data flagged for deletion are compacted more aggressively (e.g., prioritized for physical deletion when storage resources are available).
    *   Cohorts containing 'cold' data are compacted less frequently or may be archived/tiered to slower storage.

5. **Node-Aware Deletion Scheduling:** The deletion scheduling algorithm takes into account the current load on each storage node. If a node is heavily loaded, deletion operations are deferred or redirected to less busy nodes.

**Pseudocode (Deletion Request Handling):**

```
function handle_delete_request(row_range):
  for item in row_range:
    access_metadata = get_access_metadata(item)
    if access_metadata.access_frequency > threshold_hot:
      set_soft_delete_flag(item)
    elif access_metadata.access_frequency > threshold_warm:
      create_tombstone(item)
    else:
      attempt_physical_delete(item)
      if physical_delete_failed:
        create_compressed_tombstone(item)

  aggregate_tombstones_by_access_metadata()
  schedule_cohort_compaction()
```

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced Tombstone Proliferation: Minimizing tombstones for frequently accessed data.
*   Improved Query Performance: Fewer tombstones to scan during queries.
*   Optimized Storage Utilization:  Faster cleanup of cold data.
*   Adaptive Resource Management:  Distributing deletion load across nodes.
