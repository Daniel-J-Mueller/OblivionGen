## Adaptive Barcode Illumination & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Instead of relying on a static image capture and subsequent digital alignment, dynamically illuminate the barcode with a structured light pattern and reconstruct a 3D point cloud of the barcode surface. This allows for alignment *during* capture, vastly improving accuracy and enabling decoding of severely distorted or damaged barcodes.

**Specs:**

*   **Illumination System:**
    *   Projector: High-frequency (e.g., >240Hz) digital light processing (DLP) projector capable of projecting structured light patterns (e.g., sinusoidal fringes, coded light patterns). Resolution: 1920x1080 minimum.
    *   Wavelength: Narrowband visible light (e.g., 520nm green) to minimize ambient light interference.
    *   Polarization: Linearly polarized to reduce specular reflections.
    *   Deflection: Galvanometric mirrors to rapidly scan the projected pattern across the barcode. Scan rate: >1kHz.
*   **Sensor System:**
    *   Camera: High-speed (minimum 240fps) monochrome camera with global shutter. Resolution: 1920x1080 minimum.
    *   Optics: Telecentric lens to minimize perspective distortion.
    *   Filter: Narrowband filter centered on the projector wavelength.
    *   Polarization: Polarizer oriented perpendicular to the projector polarization.
*   **Processing Unit:**
    *   FPGA or GPU for real-time processing of sensor data and calculation of 3D point cloud.
    *   Algorithm: Phase-shifting profilometry (or similar technique) to extract depth information from the distorted light pattern.
    *   Point Cloud Processing: Filtering, smoothing, and segmentation of the point cloud to isolate the barcode features.
*   **Software:**
    *   Barcode decoding algorithm adapted for 3D point cloud data.
    *   Calibration routine to establish the relationship between the projector, camera, and barcode.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Calibration:** System is calibrated to determine intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of projector and camera.
2.  **Projection & Capture:** Structured light pattern is projected onto the barcode, and the distorted pattern is captured by the camera. Multiple patterns are projected with varying phase shifts.
3.  **3D Reconstruction:** The captured images are processed to reconstruct a 3D point cloud of the barcode surface.
4.  **Barcode Extraction:**  The 3D point cloud is segmented to isolate the barcode features (bars and spaces).
5.  **Decoding:** A barcode decoding algorithm is applied to the extracted 3D barcode features to obtain the encoded data.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Calibration (performed once)
calibrateProjectorCamera()

// Real-time Processing Loop
while (barcode not decoded) {
    projectStructuredLightPattern()
    captureImage()
    pointCloud = reconstructPointCloud(image)
    barcodeFeatures = segmentBarcode(pointCloud)
    decodedData = decodeBarcode(barcodeFeatures)

    if (decodedData != null) {
        break
    }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Accuracy:**  3D reconstruction eliminates the need for 2D image alignment, leading to more accurate decoding.
*   **Robustness to Distortion:**  Can decode severely distorted or damaged barcodes.
*   **Decoding of Curved Surfaces:**  Can decode barcodes applied to curved surfaces.
*   **Increased Speed:**  Real-time processing allows for fast decoding.
