## Dynamic Network Slice Orchestration via Predicted Resource Demand

**Concept:** Extend bandwidth metering to *proactively* allocate network resources by predicting demand based on historical traffic patterns and real-time application behavior. This goes beyond billing and aims at preemptive network slice creation and adjustment.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Demand Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Aggregated networking metadata (as in the provided patent), application-level telemetry (e.g., video streaming bitrate requests, database query rates), and time-of-day/day-of-week information.
    *   Algorithm: A hybrid time-series forecasting model combining ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) for baseline prediction and a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to capture complex dependencies in application behavior.  LSTM receives feature vectors derived from the aggregated metadata and application telemetry.
    *   Output: Predicted bandwidth demand for specific applications or service categories over a defined time horizon (e.g., next 5, 15, 30 minutes).  Output includes confidence intervals for the predictions.

2.  **Network Slice Orchestrator:**
    *   Input: Predicted bandwidth demand (with confidence intervals), current network topology information (from existing topology authority node), available network resources (compute, bandwidth, storage), service level agreements (SLAs) for each application/service.
    *   Logic:
        *   **Slice Creation:** If predicted demand exceeds current allocated resources *and* the confidence interval suggests a high probability of exceeding SLA thresholds, the orchestrator initiates the creation of a new network slice.  The slice is provisioned with resources calculated to meet the predicted demand.
        *   **Slice Adjustment:** If predicted demand falls significantly below current allocated resources, the orchestrator initiates a reduction in resources allocated to the network slice.  This could involve scaling down virtual network functions (VNFs), reducing bandwidth allocations, or migrating traffic to shared resources.
        *   **Resource Pre-Allocation:** Maintain a pool of ‘ready’ network slices, pre-configured to serve common demand profiles. This reduces latency when responding to sudden spikes in demand.
        *   **Dynamic Topology Adjustment:** Integrate with the topology authority node to dynamically adjust the network topology for optimal resource utilization. This could involve re-routing traffic, creating new virtual links, or adjusting the placement of VNFs.

3.  **Metering Component Integration:**
    *   Modify the first and second metering components (as in the patent) to not only collect networking metadata but also application-level telemetry. This could involve adding probes within virtual machines or leveraging existing application performance monitoring (APM) tools.
    *   Extend the on-host aggregation policy to include application telemetry data alongside networking metadata.
    *   Transmit both networking metadata and application telemetry to the Demand Prediction Module.

4.  **Pseudocode - Demand Prediction Module:**

```
function predict_demand(metadata, telemetry, history):
  # metadata: aggregated networking metadata
  # telemetry: application-level telemetry
  # history: historical traffic and telemetry data

  # Feature Engineering: Combine metadata and telemetry into a feature vector
  features = create_feature_vector(metadata, telemetry)

  # ARIMA Prediction (Baseline)
  arima_prediction = ARIMA(history, features)

  # LSTM Prediction (Complex Dependencies)
  lstm_prediction = LSTM(history, features)

  # Hybrid Prediction: Combine ARIMA and LSTM predictions
  final_prediction = (weight_arima * arima_prediction) + (weight_lstm * lstm_prediction)

  # Calculate Confidence Interval
  confidence_interval = calculate_confidence_interval(final_prediction)

  return final_prediction, confidence_interval
```

5.  **Scalability:** The system must be designed to scale to support a large number of hosts, network slices, and applications. This requires a distributed architecture with message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) and a scalable database for storing historical data and configuration information.

6.  **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect the system from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. This includes authentication, authorization, encryption, and intrusion detection.
