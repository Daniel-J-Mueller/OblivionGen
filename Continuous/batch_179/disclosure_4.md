## Kernel Data Structure Shadowing with Predictive Integrity Checks

**Concept:** Extend the signature-based detection to include a "shadow" copy of critical kernel data structures, combined with predictive integrity checks based on expected modification patterns. This anticipates malicious or erroneous changes before they propagate, allowing for proactive mitigation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Data Structure Creation:**

*   Upon system initialization (or dynamically for specific structures), a shadow copy of the target kernel data structure is created in a protected memory region.
*   The shadow copy is initialized with the current state of the kernel data structure.
*   Access controls are enforced to prevent direct modification of the shadow copy except through the designated update mechanisms.

**2. Signature Generation & Association:**

*   A cryptographic signature (SHA-256 or similar) is generated for both the original kernel data structure *and* the shadow copy.
*   These signatures are stored along with metadata indicating the last update timestamp and the source of the update (e.g., specific driver, system call).

**3. Interception & Modification Tracking:**

*   All write operations to the original kernel data structure are intercepted. This interception could be performed by a hypervisor, kernel module, or hardware-assisted virtualization.
*   Before the write operation is applied, the intended changes are applied to a temporary copy of the data structure.
*   A new signature is generated for the temporary copy.
*   A *predictive integrity check* is performed by comparing the new signature against an expected signature range. The expected range is derived from historical modification patterns and known valid states of the data structure.

**4. Predictive Integrity Check Algorithm:**

*   **Baseline Data Collection:** During normal system operation, collect historical signature changes for the data structure.
*   **Pattern Analysis:** Analyze the collected data to identify common modification patterns (e.g., specific fields are often updated together, changes tend to occur within a certain time frame).
*   **Range Calculation:** Based on the pattern analysis, calculate an “acceptable signature range”. This isn’t a single expected signature, but a set of signatures that represent valid transitions.  Could use statistical methods like standard deviation from a mean signature to define the range.
*   **Comparison:** The new signature generated from the temporary copy is compared against the acceptable range.

**5. Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Valid Change:** If the new signature falls within the acceptable range, the changes are applied to both the original kernel data structure *and* the shadow copy. The shadow copy signature is updated.
*   **Potential Anomaly:** If the new signature is *outside* the acceptable range but considered “close” (e.g., within a small distance metric), a warning is logged, and an optional debugging action is triggered (e.g., memory dump, process suspension). Changes may or may not be applied, depending on severity.
*   **Critical Anomaly:** If the new signature is significantly outside the acceptable range, the system enters a protected mode.  Mitigation actions include:
    *   Rollback to the last known good state (using the shadow copy).
    *   Process termination.
    *   System shutdown.

**6. Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(originalData, modifiedData):
    originalSignature = generateSignature(originalData)
    modifiedSignature = generateSignature(modifiedData)
    expectedRange = getExpectedSignatureRange(originalSignature) // Based on history
    distance = calculateSignatureDistance(modifiedSignature, expectedRange)
    if distance > threshold:
        logWarning("Potential anomaly detected")
        rollbackToShadowCopy() // Restore from the shadow
        terminateProcess()
    else:
        applyChanges(originalData, modifiedData)
        updateShadowCopy(modifiedData)
```

**7. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Utilize memory protection mechanisms (e.g., Intel VT-x, AMD-V) to isolate the shadow copy and control access.
*   Leverage hardware-assisted cryptographic acceleration to improve signature generation performance.
