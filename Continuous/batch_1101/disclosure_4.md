**Dynamic Scene-Linked Audio Sculpting**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Aural Canvas" – A real-time audio processing engine integrated into the video playback system.
*   **Input:** Video stream, identified scene boundaries (via automated scene detection or manual tagging), audio track, user preferences (described below).
*   **Output:** Dynamically altered audio track, mixed with original content, presented to user.
*   **Hardware:** Existing video playback device (TV, computer, mobile device) with sufficient processing power for real-time audio manipulation. Dedicated audio processing chip optional for enhanced performance. Microphone array for voice command and ambient sound analysis.
*   **Software:**
    *   Scene Detection Module: Identifies scene changes in the video.
    *   Audio Analysis Module: Analyzes the existing audio track to identify dominant frequencies, instruments, and sound events.
    *   Aural Canvas Engine: The core audio processing unit.
    *   User Interface (UI): For setting preferences and controlling the system.

**Functionality:**

The system automatically segments the video into scenes. For each scene, the Aural Canvas engine *sculpts* the audio, dynamically adjusting its characteristics based on the video content and user preferences. This isn’t simply a filter or EQ, but a generative approach to audio alteration.

**User Preferences:**

*   **Emotional Palette:** Users define an emotional tone (e.g., “Epic,” “Relaxing,” “Intense,” “Mysterious”).
*   **Instrumental Focus:** Users select instruments to emphasize or suppress (e.g., "Highlight strings," "De-emphasize percussion").
*   **Ambient Integration:** The system uses the microphone array to capture ambient sounds. These sounds are then blended into the audio track to create a more immersive experience. (e.g., rain sounds during a rainy scene).
*   **Generative Soundscapes:**  The system can *generate* new sound elements based on the scene's visual characteristics.  For example, a scene depicting a forest could generate subtle bird sounds or wind effects. These generated sounds are layered with the existing audio.
*   **Voice-Activated Control:** Users can use voice commands to adjust the emotional palette, instrumental focus, or ambient integration in real-time. (“More intense,” “Highlight piano,” “Add rain sounds”).

**Pseudocode (Aural Canvas Engine - Scene Processing):**

```
function processScene(sceneData, userPreferences):
  audioTrack = sceneData.audioTrack
  visualData = sceneData.visualData

  emotionalPalette = userPreferences.emotionalPalette
  instrumentalFocus = userPreferences.instrumentalFocus
  ambientIntegration = userPreferences.ambientIntegration

  // Analyze audio track and visual data
  audioAnalysis = analyzeAudio(audioTrack)
  visualAnalysis = analyzeVisual(visualData)

  // Generate new sound elements based on emotional palette and visual data
  generatedSounds = generateSounds(emotionalPalette, visualAnalysis)

  // Adjust existing audio based on instrumental focus
  adjustedAudio = adjustAudio(audioAnalysis, instrumentalFocus)

  // Integrate ambient sounds
  integratedAudio = integrateAmbientSounds(adjustedAudio, ambientIntegration)

  // Mix generated sounds and integrated audio
  finalAudio = mixAudio(generatedSounds, integratedAudio)

  return finalAudio
```

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simple audio filtering or EQ adjustments. It uses a generative approach to dynamically sculpt the audio based on both the visual content and user preferences, creating a truly immersive and personalized audio experience. The real-time generation of new sound elements based on scene analysis is a key differentiator. It isn’t about replacing the existing audio, but augmenting it to create a richer, more dynamic sonic landscape.
