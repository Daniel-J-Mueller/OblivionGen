## Dynamic Zone Affinity & Predictive Handover

**Specification:** Implement a system that proactively shifts traffic affinity *between* zones based on predicted zone health, *before* a failure occurs. This extends the concept of advertising routes in other zones to a proactive, health-driven system, minimizing impact from failures and enabling smoother traffic flows.

**Components:**

*   **Zone Health Monitor (ZHM):** Deployed in each zone, continuously monitors key metrics (CPU utilization, memory usage, network latency, packet loss, application-specific health checks).
*   **Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE):** Centralized service. Receives data from ZHMs. Uses time-series analysis and machine learning to *predict* potential zone degradation or failure. Outputs a “Zone Health Score” (ZHS) and a “Predicted Time to Degradation” (PTD).
*   **Traffic Affinity Controller (TAC):** Distributed across border routers. Receives ZHS and PTD from the PAE. Dynamically adjusts routing weights/policies to shift traffic *away* from zones with low ZHS/approaching PTD.
*   **Connection State Database (CSDB):** Maintains a record of active connections and their originating zones. Used to facilitate seamless handover and minimize session disruption.

**Operation:**

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:** ZHMs constantly collect data and report it to the PAE.
2.  **Prediction:** The PAE analyzes the data, predicts zone health, and calculates ZHS and PTD.
3.  **Proactive Shifting:** The TAC, based on ZHS/PTD, dynamically adjusts routing policies.  Traffic destined for a zone with a low ZHS or approaching PTD is subtly redirected to healthier zones. This is done *before* the zone actually fails.
4.  **Connection Handover:**  The CSDB tracks active connections. When traffic is shifted, the TAC initiates a “soft handover” where new packets for the connection are routed to the healthier zone. The original zone is gradually removed from the path.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The system monitors the performance of shifted traffic and adjusts routing policies accordingly.

**Pseudocode (TAC):**

```
function adjust_routing(zone_health_score, predicted_time_to_degradation, connection_state):
  if zone_health_score < threshold AND predicted_time_to_degradation < handover_window:
    //Calculate redirection percentage based on health score and time remaining
    redirection_percentage = calculate_redirection(zone_health_score, predicted_time_to_degradation)

    for each active_connection in connection_state:
      if active_connection.destination_zone == failing_zone:
        //Adjust routing weight for this connection
        set_routing_weight(active_connection, healthy_zone, redirection_percentage)
  else:
    //Restore default routing
    restore_default_routing()
```

**Novelty:**

This differs from the referenced patent by going beyond simply responding to failures. It *predicts* them and proactively adjusts traffic flow to mitigate impact. The addition of the CSDB and dynamic routing weight adjustment further enhance the system's responsiveness and ability to maintain seamless connectivity.  It’s a shift from reactive recovery to *predictive resilience*.
