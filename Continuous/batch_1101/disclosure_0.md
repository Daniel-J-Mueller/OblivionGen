## Adaptive Host Persona Injection

**Concept:** Leverage the restricted public network access within the virtualized client instance to dynamically inject “host personas” – limited, pre-configured sets of network permissions – into the virtualized environment based on user identity and task. This allows granular control over what a user can *do* within the private network *through* the virtualized client, beyond simple host access control.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Persona Definition:**
    *   A Persona is a JSON configuration file. Example:
        ```json
        {
          "name": "PLC_Maintenance",
          "description": "Allows read/write access to PLCs for maintenance tasks",
          "allowed_hosts": ["192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.11"],
          "allowed_ports": [80, 443, 22],
          "allowed_protocols": ["TCP", "HTTPS", "SSH"],
          "data_filters": {
            "read": ["*.conf", "*.log"],
            "write": ["*.txt"]
          },
          "execution_limits": {
            "cpu": "50%",
            "memory": "2GB"
          }
        }
        ```
    *   A Persona Repository will store these configuration files. Access will be managed by a central authentication/authorization service.

2.  **Authentication & Persona Selection:**
    *   Upon connection, the client device authenticates with the central service.
    *   Based on the user's identity and, optionally, the requested task (passed as a connection parameter), the system selects the appropriate Persona.
    *   The Persona is delivered to the virtualized client instance via the restricted public network channel. This is a small, JSON file, designed for quick transmission.

3.  **Runtime Persona Injection:**
    *   The virtualized client instance has a "Persona Manager" module.
    *   The Persona Manager receives the Persona configuration file.
    *   It dynamically configures the virtualized environment’s network stack and security policies based on the Persona. This includes:
        *   Creating/Modifying firewall rules.
        *   Setting up virtual network interfaces.
        *   Configuring access control lists (ACLs) for network services.
        *   Implementing resource limits (CPU, memory) for processes.
        *   Enforcing data filtering rules.
    *   All network communication originating from the virtualized client instance is governed by the injected Persona.

4.  **Public Network Communication Restrictions:**
    *   The virtualized client instance remains restricted to sending only graphical data and receiving input data via the public network.
    *   The Persona injection *happens* over this restricted channel, and then all subsequent private network communication is governed by the Persona.

5.  **Security Considerations:**
    *   The Persona files must be digitally signed to prevent tampering.
    *   The Persona Manager module must be hardened against attacks.
    *   Regular security audits should be performed to identify and address vulnerabilities.

**Pseudocode (Persona Manager Module):**

```pseudocode
function applyPersona(personaFile):
    // Parse the Persona file
    persona = parseJSON(personaFile)

    // Apply network rules
    for host in persona.allowed_hosts:
        addFirewallRule(host, persona.allowed_ports, persona.allowed_protocols)

    // Apply data filtering rules
    setAccessControlLists(persona.data_filters)

    // Apply resource limits
    setProcessLimits(persona.execution_limits)

    // Activate the Persona
    log("Persona applied: " + persona.name)
end function
```

This system allows for a highly flexible and secure way to grant temporary, task-specific access to resources within a private network, all managed through the restricted public network channel established by the original patent's design.  It adds a layer of dynamic access control *on top* of the existing network isolation.
