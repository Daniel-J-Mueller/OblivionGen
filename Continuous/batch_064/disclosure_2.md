## Adaptive Credential Rotation via Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system integrating behavioral biometrics with the existing credential storage and validation framework to enable proactive, adaptive credential rotation. This isn't simply *changing* a password, it’s intelligently triggering a credential refresh based on subtle user behavior deviations.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiler:** Continuously monitors user interaction patterns – keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scroll speed, typing cadence, application usage sequences – creating a baseline behavioral profile. This runs locally on the client device.
2.  **Deviation Detector:** Compares current user behavior against the established baseline. Employs a multi-factor scoring system weighting various behavioral metrics. A threshold determines significant deviation.
3.  **Credential Rotation Engine:** Triggered by significant behavioral deviation. Initiates a credential refresh process, potentially utilizing existing security credential specifications. This engine can leverage various methods - generating a new password, requesting a multi-factor authentication challenge, or initiating a 'shadow authentication' procedure.
4.  **Trust Score:** A dynamic value calculated based on behavioral deviation and historical authentication success. Lower scores trigger stricter authentication requirements or credential rotation.  A 'grace period' exists to allow for temporary behavioral shifts.
5.  **Secure Enclave Integration:** All behavioral data processing and Trust Score calculation occurs within a secure enclave on the client device. Minimizes risk of data leakage or manipulation.
6.  **Server-Side Validation:** While the primary behavioral analysis occurs locally, server-side validation of the Trust Score and authentication attempts is performed to prevent sophisticated attacks.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Client-Side
loop:
    captureUserBehavior()
    calculateBehavioralScore(capturedBehavior, baselineProfile)
    updateTrustScore(behavioralScore, historicalData)

    if TrustScore < Threshold:
        triggerCredentialRotation()
        // Example Credential Rotation Method
        generateNewPassword(securityCredentialSpecification)
        sendNewPasswordToNetworkSite(secureChannel)
        updateStoredCredential(newPassword)
    end if
end loop

// Server-Side
receiveAuthenticationAttempt(user, credential, trustScore)
validateCredential(credential)
if trustScore < ServerThreshold:
    requireMultiFactorAuthentication()
end if
```

**Innovation:**  Current credential rotation is typically scheduled or triggered by known security breaches. This system proactively adapts to potential threats by monitoring subtle changes in user behavior, providing an early warning system and automatically initiating credential refresh *before* compromise occurs. It moves beyond static authentication to a dynamic, behavior-aware security model.
