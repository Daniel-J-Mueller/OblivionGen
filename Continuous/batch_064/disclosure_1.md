## Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Mapping & Dynamic Route Optimization – "EchoNet"

**System Overview:**

EchoNet leverages a swarm of low-cost, ground-based autonomous vehicles (let’s call them “EchoUnits”) equipped with basic sensors (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs) to create and maintain a hyper-detailed, real-time map of both indoor and outdoor environments, then uses this map for dynamic route optimization – going beyond static map data. The system focuses on micro-level changes (temporary obstructions, spills, pedestrian traffic) to enable true “last meter” navigation for delivery/service bots.

**Hardware Specs (EchoUnit):**

*   **Dimensions:** 20cm x 20cm x 15cm
*   **Weight:** 1.5kg
*   **Locomotion:** Four-wheel drive, differential steering
*   **Sensors:**
    *   2D LiDAR (range: 10m, 360° coverage)
    *   RGB Camera (1080p, 30fps)
    *   IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)
*   **Compute:** Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (or equivalent)
*   **Communication:** Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.0
*   **Power:** Rechargeable Li-Ion battery (3 hours operational time)
*   **Cost (estimated):** $200 - $300 per unit

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Data Acquisition & Fusion:** Each EchoUnit continuously collects sensor data. Data is time-stamped and tagged with the unit's GPS/IMU location. Sensor fusion algorithms (Kalman filtering, SLAM) create a local map of the immediate surroundings.
2.  **Swarm Communication & Map Merging:** EchoUnits communicate wirelessly (mesh network) to share their local maps. A central server (or distributed ledger) merges these local maps into a global map.
3.  **Dynamic Obstacle Detection & Prediction:**  AI algorithms analyze the global map for dynamic obstacles.  Algorithms predict obstacle movement based on historical data and current velocity.
4.  **Real-Time Route Optimization:**  A route planning module calculates optimal routes for delivery/service bots, taking into account dynamic obstacles, predicted traffic, and bot capabilities (size, speed).
5.  **Adaptive Map Resolution:** The system dynamically adjusts map resolution based on the density of obstacles and the required level of detail.  High-resolution maps are maintained in areas with frequent changes.

**Pseudocode (Route Optimization):**

```
function calculate_route(start_location, end_location, bot_specs):
  global_map = get_current_map()
  
  // Filter map to area within radius of start/end locations
  filtered_map = filter_map(global_map, start_location, end_location)

  // Identify potential paths based on A* or similar algorithm
  potential_paths = a_star(filtered_map, start_location, end_location, bot_specs)

  // Score each path based on:
  // - Distance
  // - Obstacle density
  // - Predicted obstacle avoidance maneuvers
  // - Estimated travel time
  scored_paths = score_paths(potential_paths, dynamic_obstacle_data)

  // Select the optimal path
  optimal_path = select_optimal_path(scored_paths)

  return optimal_path
```

**Deployment Strategy:**

*   **Initial Mapping:** Deploy a swarm of EchoUnits to map the target environment.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:**  Maintain a smaller, roving swarm of EchoUnits for continuous monitoring and map updates.
*   **Docking Stations:** Provide docking stations for EchoUnits to recharge and upload data.
*   **Scalability:** The system is scalable by adding more EchoUnits to increase map coverage and update frequency.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Last-mile delivery (packages, food)
*   Indoor logistics (warehouses, hospitals)
*   Security surveillance
*   Emergency response
*   Autonomous cleaning/maintenance
