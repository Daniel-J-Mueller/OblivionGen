## Dynamic Foveated Streaming with Predictive Rendering

**Concept:** Expand upon user attention prediction by not just *reducing* encoding quality during lapses, but *predictively rendering* a higher-quality, future viewport based on anticipated gaze, and seamlessly switching when attention returns. This moves beyond conservation to proactive enhancement.

**Specs:**

**1. Gaze Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** User input (mouse, controller, touch), historical gaze data (if available, for personalized prediction), scene geometry, object importance (defined by application/content creator – e.g., UI elements, points of interest).
*   **Algorithm:** Hybrid approach:
    *   **Short-Term:**  Kalman filter based on recent input trajectory to predict immediate gaze direction.
    *   **Mid-Term:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on user behavior patterns (e.g., typical scanpaths within a scene type) to anticipate gaze shifts.
    *   **Long-Term:**  Contextual awareness – if the user is watching a video, anticipate cuts and scene changes. If in a game, predict focus based on gameplay objectives.
*   **Output:** Probability distribution of likely gaze locations (x, y coordinates on the render target) with associated confidence levels.

**2. Multi-Resolution Rendering Pipeline:**

*   **Base Layer:**  Standard resolution rendering for immediate display.
*   **Foveated Layers (Multiple):**  Render several concentric regions around the predicted gaze locations at *increasing* resolutions. The innermost region is rendered at the highest resolution, progressively decreasing outwards.  The number of layers and resolution step sizes are configurable.
*   **Rendering Mode:**  Delayed rendering – foveated layers are rendered *in the background* on a separate thread/GPU instance.

**3. Attention-Aware Switching System:**

*   **Input:** Output from the Gaze Prediction Module, User Attention Prediction (from provided patent), rendering status of foveated layers.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Attention High:** Seamlessly blend the highest-resolution foveated layer with the base layer as the user’s gaze converges on it.
    *   **Attention Low:** Freeze rendering of the foveated layers.  Maintain base layer rendering at a reduced quality.
    *   **Attention Transition:**  Blend between base layer and foveated layer based on the user attention prediction score.
*   **Blending:** Per-pixel alpha blending to smooth the transition between layers. Utilize temporal anti-aliasing techniques to minimize visual artifacts.

**4. Dynamic Resource Allocation:**

*   **Resource Management:**  Prioritize rendering resources (GPU time, memory) to the predicted gaze region.  Allocate more resources during high attention, less during low attention.
*   **Scaling:** Dynamically adjust the number of foveated layers and their resolutions based on available resources and predicted gaze confidence.

**Pseudocode (Attention Transition):**

```
function RenderFrame(attentionScore, predictedGazeX, predictedGazeY):
    // Render Base Layer (Reduced Quality during low attention)
    baseLayer = RenderBaseLayer(attentionScore)

    // Render Foveated Layers (in background)
    foveatedLayers = RenderFoveatedLayers(predictedGazeX, predictedGazeY)

    // Calculate Blend Factor
    blendFactor = attentionScore

    // Blend Layers
    finalImage = blendFactor * foveatedLayers + (1 - blendFactor) * baseLayer

    // Display finalImage
    DisplayImage(finalImage)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced visual fidelity in the user’s focus area.
*   Reduced bandwidth/rendering costs by lowering quality in the periphery.
*   Proactive rendering minimizes perceived latency during attention shifts.
*   Personalized experience based on user gaze patterns.
