## Adaptive Journaling with Predictive Recomputation

**Specification:** A system extending the core concept of journaled databases with adaptive recomputation based on predicted data access patterns. This aims to minimize verification overhead while maximizing data integrity.

**Core Concept:** Instead of recomputing *all* frontier nodes during version transitions (as implied in claim 12), predict which nodes are *likely* to be accessed in the next version based on historical access logs.  Only recompute those predicted nodes and their dependencies, creating a 'focused' digest.

**Components:**

1.  **Access Pattern Analyzer:** Monitors read/write requests to the journal.  Maintains a rolling window of access patterns â€“ which leaf nodes, and which paths to those nodes (interior nodes) are frequently accessed.  Can employ techniques like Markov chains or LSTMs to predict future access.

2.  **Recomputation Planner:**  Uses the output of the Access Pattern Analyzer to generate a recomputation plan.  This plan specifies which frontier nodes (and their parent interior nodes) need to be recomputed for the next version.  The planner must also account for write operations - nodes affected by writes *must* be included.  Prioritize recomputation based on access frequency *and* the cost of recomputation (depth of the node in the tree).

3.  **Focused Digest Generator:**  Recomputes only the nodes identified in the recomputation plan. Generates a 'focused digest' containing the hashes of these recomputed nodes. This digest is significantly smaller than a full recomputation digest, reducing verification overhead.

4.  **Verification Protocol:**  To verify data integrity, the verifier requests the focused digest and the relevant hashes for the requested data path (leaf node and all ancestors).  The system then provides these hashes, which the verifier can use to reconstruct the path and verify its integrity.  If a requested node isn't in the focused digest, the system provides a 'pre-computed' hash from the previous version (assuming it hasn't been modified).

**Pseudocode (Recomputation Planner):**

```
function plan_recomputation(access_logs, write_set, current_journal_tree):
  predicted_access_paths = analyze_access_logs(access_logs)
  nodes_to_recompute = set()

  # Add nodes affected by writes
  for entry in write_set:
    leaf_node = find_leaf_node(entry, current_journal_tree)
    add_path_to_recompute(leaf_node, current_journal_tree, nodes_to_recompute)

  # Add predicted access paths
  for path in predicted_access_paths:
    add_path_to_recompute(path, current_journal_tree, nodes_to_recompute)

  # Prioritize based on cost (depth) - optional heuristic
  nodes_to_recompute = sort_by_depth(nodes_to_recompute)

  return nodes_to_recompute

function add_path_to_recompute(node, journal_tree, recompute_set):
  while node != None:
    recompute_set.add(node)
    node = node.parent
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `JournalNode`: Represents a node in the journal tree. Contains hash value, parent pointer, child pointers (if interior node), and data (if leaf node).
*   `AccessLogEntry`: Records a read or write request. Contains timestamp, node identifier, and operation type.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Adaptive Granularity:**  Dynamically adjust the granularity of recomputation.  If access patterns are stable, recompute larger chunks of the tree.  If patterns are volatile, recompute smaller chunks.
*   **Bloom Filters:** Use Bloom filters to efficiently determine if a node has been modified between versions, reducing the need for full hash comparisons.
*   **Multi-Version Concurrency Control:**  Allow multiple versions of the journal to coexist, improving concurrency and reducing contention.
