## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Personalized Audio Profiles

**Concept:** Expand the idea of device switching based on proximity to create dynamically adjustable acoustic zones within an environment, tailored to individual user audio profiles. This moves beyond simply handing off a call, to actively shaping the audio experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array (MMA):** Each device (first device & second device â€“ and potentially more) requires an MMA (minimum 4 microphones) for beamforming and sound source localization.
*   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:** Dedicated hardware or a high-performance DSP capable of real-time spatial audio rendering.
*   **Ultra-Wideband (UWB) or High-Precision Bluetooth:** For accurate user location tracking within the environment. Resolution of < 15cm is preferred.
*   **Device Connectivity:** Low-latency wireless communication protocol (Wi-Fi 6E, 5G) between devices.
*   **Optional: Bone Conduction Transducers:** Integrated into wearable devices for supplementary audio delivery.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Acoustic Mapping Module:** Continuously builds a 3D map of the environment, identifying surfaces, obstacles, and acoustic properties (reverberation, absorption).
*   **User Profile Manager:** Stores individualized audio profiles including:
    *   Preferred equalization settings.
    *   Voice characteristics (for voice isolation/enhancement).
    *   Hearing profile (if applicable, integrating audiological data).
    *   Privacy preferences (e.g. directional audio for confidential calls).
*   **Zone Definition Engine:** Dynamically defines acoustic zones based on:
    *   User location (determined by UWB/Bluetooth).
    *   Obstacle locations (from the acoustic map).
    *   User activity (e.g., walking, stationary, conferencing).
*   **Beamforming & Audio Rendering Engine:** Controls the MMA to create focused audio beams directed towards each user, utilizing the acoustic map and user profiles. Supports:
    *   Directional audio.
    *   Noise cancellation.
    *   Reverberation control.
    *   Personalized EQ.
*   **Contextual Awareness Engine:** Integrates data from other sensors (e.g., cameras, motion sensors) to refine zone definitions and audio rendering.  Examples:
    *   Detecting a door opening and adjusting the zone boundary.
    *   Identifying a user looking at a specific object and prioritizing audio cues from that direction.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Create Acoustic Map
Load User Profiles

// Main Loop
While (System Running)
{
    Update User Locations (UWB/Bluetooth)
    Update Acoustic Map (sensor data)

    For Each User
    {
        Define User Zone (location, map, activity)
        Calculate Optimal Beamforming Parameters (user profile, zone)
        Render Audio (beamforming, EQ, noise cancellation)
        Deliver Audio (speakers, headphones, bone conduction)
    }

    If (Context Change Detected)
    {
        Adjust Zones
        Recalculate Beamforming Parameters
    }
}
```

**4. Advanced Features:**

*   **Acoustic Privacy Bubbles:** Create localized audio zones around users, preventing sound from escaping to surrounding areas.
*   **Multi-User Collaboration Zones:** Dynamically adjust zones to facilitate seamless audio communication during group meetings.
*   **Immersive Audio Experiences:** Create realistic 3D soundscapes for entertainment or training applications.
*   **Adaptive Noise Cancellation:** Adjust noise cancellation levels based on ambient sound and user preferences.
*   **Remote Zone Control:** Allow users to remotely define and manage their acoustic zones using a mobile app.
