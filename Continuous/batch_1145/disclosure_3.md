**Secure Hardware Root of Trust with Dynamic Key Derivation & Attestation**

**Concept:** Extend the on-chip key concept to not just provision *a* key, but to act as a root of trust for *dynamically derived* keys. These derived keys are tied to specific device states or user actions, providing a continuously changing security posture.  Crucially, integrate remote attestation to verify the integrity of the derivation process.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Component:** A dedicated cryptographic co-processor integrated into the processor.  This co-processor contains:
    *   True Random Number Generator (TRNG) – Certified to NIST SP 800-90A/B.
    *   Secure Key Storage – Using Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) technology for key generation and storage.  The on-chip key serves as a seed for the PUF.
    *   Cryptographic Engine – Supports AES, SHA-256/512, ECC (P-256, P-384, P-521), and post-quantum algorithms (Kyber-768/1024, Dilithium-2/3).
    *   Attestation Engine – Hardware-based generation of signed attestation reports.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):**
    *   Input: On-chip key, device state data (e.g., sensor readings, memory snapshot, bootloader version), user action data (e.g., biometric scan, PIN entry), timestamp.
    *   Algorithm: HKDF-SHA256 with a salt derived from the on-chip key and timestamp.
    *   Output: Session key. The session key is valid for a limited time (e.g., 5 minutes) and intended for a specific purpose (e.g., decrypting a file, establishing a secure connection).
*   **Attestation Process:**
    1.  Device measures its bootloader, kernel, and critical system components using a hardware-rooted TrustZone-like environment.
    2.  A signed measurement report is generated using the attestation engine and the current derived key.
    3.  The device sends the attestation report to a remote attestation server.
    4.  The attestation server verifies the signature using the device's public key (associated with the on-chip key) and verifies the integrity of the measured components.
    5.  If attestation is successful, the server provides a token authorizing specific actions.
*   **Software API:**  A secure API allowing applications to request derived keys for specific purposes.  The API enforces policy rules (e.g., only allow key derivation if the device is attested, limit the number of requests per application).
*   **Dynamic Revocation:**  If a derived key is suspected of being compromised, a revocation list is published on the attestation server.  Devices periodically download the list and refuse to accept requests using revoked keys.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```
function deriveKey(onChipKey, deviceState, userAction, timestamp):
  salt = generateSalt(onChipKey, timestamp)
  info = concatenate(deviceState, userAction)
  derivedKey = HKDF-SHA256(onChipKey, salt, info)
  return derivedKey
```

**Innovation:**  Moves beyond static key provisioning to a dynamic, adaptive security model. By tying keys to device and user state, and verifying integrity through remote attestation, this system significantly reduces the attack surface and improves resilience against compromise. The continuous key rotation and revocation mechanism further strengthens security.
