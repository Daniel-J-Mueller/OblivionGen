## Dynamic Data Provenance & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the data quality identification and resolution system to not only *resolve* inconsistencies but to dynamically track data provenance and assign trust scores to individual data points *before* they are even used, enabling proactive filtering or weighting during analysis.

**Specs:**

**1. Provenance Capture Module:**

*   **Trigger:** Activated upon any data ingestion or modification event from any data source.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Automatically records the originating data source, timestamp, user (if applicable), and a hash of the data value.
    *   Records any transformations applied to the data (e.g., cleansing, normalization, translation) with associated metadata (algorithm used, parameters, timestamp).
    *   Stores provenance data in a dedicated, immutable ledger (blockchain-inspired).
*   **Data Structure:**
    ```
    ProvenanceRecord {
        data_id: String (Unique identifier for the data point)
        source: String (Data source identifier)
        timestamp: DateTime
        user: String (User ID, if applicable)
        original_value: String (Original data value)
        transformations: List<TransformationRecord>
    }

    TransformationRecord {
        algorithm: String
        parameters: String
        timestamp: DateTime
    }
    ```

**2. Trust Score Engine:**

*   **Input:** Provenance records for a specific data point.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Calculates a trust score based on the following factors:
        *   **Source Reliability:** Assigns a base trust score to each data source (configurable).
        *   **Transformation History:** Penalizes scores for complex or untrustworthy transformations. (e.g., translations from unreliable sources)
        *   **Data Age:** Reduces scores for outdated data.
        *   **Conflict Resolution History:** Records how often a data point was flagged or corrected, negatively impacting the score.
    *   Outputs a normalized trust score (0-1).
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function calculateTrustScore(provenanceRecord):
        baseScore = dataSourceReliability[provenanceRecord.source]
        transformationPenalty = 0
        for transformation in provenanceRecord.transformations:
            transformationPenalty += transformationRiskScore[transformation.algorithm]

        agePenalty = calculateAgePenalty(provenanceRecord.timestamp)

        conflictPenalty = calculateConflictPenalty(provenanceRecord.data_id)

        trustScore = baseScore - transformationPenalty - agePenalty - conflictPenalty
        trustScore = clamp(trustScore, 0, 1) // Ensure score is between 0 and 1
        return trustScore
    ```

**3.  Dynamic Filtering & Weighting:**

*   **Integration:**  Integrates with existing data consumption layers (reports, dashboards, AI models).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Allows users to define trust score thresholds for data inclusion. (e.g., only use data with a trust score > 0.8)
    *   Provides options to weight data values based on their trust score. (e.g., in an average calculation, higher trust scores contribute more)
    *   Generates “trust heatmaps” within dashboards to visually highlight data quality concerns.

**4. User Interface Extension:**

*   The existing GUI for data quality issues will be expanded to include:
    *   A “Provenance” tab displaying the complete history of a data point.
    *   A “Trust Score” indicator alongside each data attribute.
    *   User controls to adjust source reliability settings and weighting parameters.
