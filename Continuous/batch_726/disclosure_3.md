## Adaptive Resolution Weight Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the lookup table approach to dynamically adjust the precision of weight representation based on input signal characteristics, reducing memory footprint and potentially accelerating computation.

**Specification:**

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Input Signal Analyzer:** A circuit to analyze the incoming input vector, calculating metrics like variance, entropy, or signal-to-noise ratio for each element.
*   **Resolution Control Module:** Based on the analysis from the Input Signal Analyzer, this module determines the required bit-width (resolution) for each weight corresponding to each input element. This will be dynamic for each vector processed.
*   **Variable-Precision Weight Storage:** A memory system capable of storing weights with varying bit-widths.  This could be implemented using a combination of smaller memory blocks or a more complex memory architecture with programmable bit-width allocation.
*   **Dynamic Lookup Table Generator:** A circuit that constructs the lookup table *on-the-fly* based on the dynamically allocated bit-widths of the weights and the corresponding input ranges. This could utilize a combination of multiplexers and programmable logic.
*   **Weighted Summation Unit:**  A unit to perform the weighted sum of the products retrieved from the dynamically generated lookup table.  Must support variable-precision arithmetic.

**Software/Firmware Components:**

*   **Resolution Mapping Algorithm:** An algorithm to map input signal characteristics (variance, entropy, etc.) to appropriate weight resolutions. This can be trained or pre-defined based on the application.
*   **Lookup Table Generation Control:** Firmware to configure the Dynamic Lookup Table Generator based on the output of the Resolution Mapping Algorithm.
*   **Variable-Precision Arithmetic Library:** A library of functions to perform arithmetic operations with variable-precision numbers.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// For each input vector:
FOR EACH element IN input_vector:
    // Analyze input signal characteristics
    signal_characteristics = analyze_input_signal(element)

    // Determine appropriate weight resolution
    weight_resolution = resolution_mapping_algorithm(signal_characteristics)

    // Retrieve weight with corresponding resolution
    weight = retrieve_weight(weight_index, weight_resolution)

    // Determine input range for element
    input_range = determine_input_range(element)

    // Generate lookup table entry using selected weight and input range
    lookup_table_entry = weight * representative_value_of_range(input_range)

    // Store lookup table entry
ENDFOR

// Perform dot product
dot_product = 0
FOR EACH entry IN lookup_table:
    dot_product += entry
ENDFOR

// Output dot_product
```

**Refinements & Considerations:**

*   **Granularity of Resolution Control:**  The resolution can be controlled per weight, per input element, or even at a coarser level (e.g., groups of weights).
*   **Compression Techniques:**  Variable-precision weights can be further compressed using techniques like Huffman coding or run-length encoding.
*   **Trade-offs:**  Thereâ€™s a trade-off between memory savings, computational complexity, and accuracy. The Resolution Mapping Algorithm needs to be carefully designed to balance these factors.
*   **FPGA Implementation:** This architecture is particularly well-suited for implementation on FPGAs, which offer the flexibility to reconfigure the hardware based on the dynamic resolution requirements.
*   **Training Data:** The Resolution Mapping Algorithm could be trained using a dataset of input signals and corresponding optimal weight resolutions.
*   **Parallelization:**  The lookup table generation and weighted summation can be parallelized to further accelerate computation.
