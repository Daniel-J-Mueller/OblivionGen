## Adaptive Authentication Profiles via Behavioral Biometrics & Predictive Modeling

**Specification:** A system integrating behavioral biometric analysis with predictive modeling to dynamically adjust authentication requirements *during* a user session, rather than solely at login. This builds upon the existing remote directory authentication by adding a continuous risk assessment layer.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Sensor Suite:** Captures a broad range of user interaction data: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns), scrolling behavior, app switching frequency, touch screen pressure (if applicable), and potentially even audio analysis of background noise/voice stress (optional, privacy implications require careful consideration).
*   **Feature Extraction Module:** Processes raw sensor data into quantifiable features. Examples: keystroke velocity variance, mouse acceleration entropy, scroll pattern complexity, app switching rate.
*   **Baseline Profile Builder:** During initial sessions, establishes a personalized behavioral baseline for each user. This requires a "learning period" where the system observes typical behavior without strict enforcement.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:**  A machine learning model (e.g., autoencoder, one-class SVM) trained on baseline profiles. Detects deviations from established norms in real-time.  Deviations are scored based on severity.
*   **Risk Engine:** Combines anomaly scores with contextual factors:
    *   **Resource Access:** What resources is the user accessing? (High-value assets trigger higher risk thresholds).
    *   **Time of Day/Location:** Unusual access times or locations raise risk.
    *   **Transaction Amount:** For financial transactions, higher amounts increase risk.
    *   **Network Information:** IP address reputation, device security posture.
*   **Dynamic Authentication Controller:**  Adjusts authentication requirements *during* the session based on the risk score:
    *   **Low Risk:** No additional authentication.
    *   **Medium Risk:**  Step-up authentication (e.g., SMS OTP, push notification).
    *   **High Risk:**  Stronger authentication (e.g., biometric verification, security question).  Session lock-out or immediate termination if extreme anomaly detected.
*   **Predictive Modeling Layer:** Leverages time-series analysis (e.g., LSTM networks) to *predict* future anomalous behavior based on current trends. Proactively triggers authentication challenges *before* a breach occurs.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Authentication Controller):**

```
function adjustAuthentication(riskScore, currentAuthLevel):
  if riskScore < thresholdLow:
    return currentAuthLevel // No change
  else if riskScore < thresholdMedium:
    if currentAuthLevel == "none":
      requestStepUpAuth() // e.g., SMS OTP
      currentAuthLevel = "stepup"
    return currentAuthLevel
  else if riskScore < thresholdHigh:
    if currentAuthLevel == "stepup" or currentAuthLevel == "none":
      requestStrongAuth() // e.g., Biometric
      currentAuthLevel = "strong"
    return currentAuthLevel
  else:
    terminateSession()
    return "terminated"
```

**Integration with Existing System:**

The system integrates by:

1.  Receiving user authentication confirmation from the remote directory as a baseline.
2.  Continuously monitoring user behavior *after* initial authentication.
3.  Communicating risk scores and authentication requests to the service provider network.
4.  Leveraging the network's resources to enforce authentication challenges (e.g., presenting a biometric prompt).

**Novelty:**

This system differs from standard multi-factor authentication by providing *continuous* and *adaptive* security. It doesn't rely solely on initial authentication but constantly reassesses risk and adjusts security measures accordingly. Predictive modeling adds a proactive layer, anticipating potential threats before they materialize.
