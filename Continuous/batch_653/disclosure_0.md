## Dynamic Preference Weighting for Proactive Recommendations

**Concept:** Expand the "early adopter" scoring beyond simply identifying *what* is adopted early, to *who* is adopting, and dynamically adjust recommendations based on evolving user preference weights derived from their early adoption behavior *across* categories.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Inputs:**

*   **Purchase History:**  As in the source patent, detailed purchase history including timestamps.
*   **Item Metadata:** Rich item metadata beyond price (e.g., category, subcategory, features, brand).
*   **User Profiles:**  Basic demographic information (optional, for broader trend analysis).
*   **Category Affinity Scores:**  Pre-calculated scores reflecting each user's baseline preference for different product categories (e.g., based on past purchases, browsing history).

**II. Algorithm – Dynamic Weighting & Prediction:**

1.  **Early Adopter Identification:**  Identify early adopters for *each* item based on purchase time relative to item availability (as in the source patent).
2.  **User Early Adoption Score (UEAS):** Calculate a UEAS for each user:
    *   For each item the user *early adopts*:  Add a weight based on the item’s overall early adoption rank (e.g., top 10% of early adopters gets a higher weight).
    *   Normalize UEAS across all users.
3.  **Category-Specific Weight Adjustment:**
    *   For each user, determine the categories of items they early adopted.
    *   Increase the weight of the user's Category Affinity Score for those categories by a factor proportional to their UEAS.  This means users with a high UEAS will have their preferences for the adopted categories *strongly* boosted.
4.  **Recommendation Generation:**
    *   Generate potential recommendations based on a standard collaborative filtering or content-based filtering approach.
    *   Multiply the predicted relevance score of each item by the adjusted Category Affinity Score for the user.
    *   Rank and present the top-ranked recommendations.

**III. System Components:**

*   **Data Ingestion Module:** Collects and processes data from various sources.
*   **Early Adopter Scoring Engine:** Implements the early adopter identification and UEAS calculation.
*   **Category Affinity Adjustment Module:** Implements the category weight adjustment algorithm.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** Generates and ranks recommendations.
*   **API Endpoint:** Provides access to recommendations for the user interface.

**IV. Pseudocode (Category Affinity Adjustment):**

```
// For each user:
user.UEAS = calculateUserEarlyAdoptionScore(user)

// For each category:
category.affinityScore = user.initialCategoryAffinityScore

// Identify categories the user early adopted
earlyAdoptedCategories = findEarlyAdoptedCategories(user)

// For each early adopted category:
category.affinityScore = category.affinityScore * (1 + user.UEAS * boostFactor)  //Boost the score

//Normalize all category scores for user to prevent unbounded growth.
normalizeCategoryScores(user)
```

**V. Novelty & Potential:**

This expands the concept beyond simply surfacing "early adopter" items. It actively *learns* user preferences based on their early adoption behavior and proactively adjusts recommendations to align with those evolving preferences, even across categories.  It leverages early adoption as a strong signal of user taste and anticipates future needs.  It could significantly improve recommendation relevance and user engagement.
