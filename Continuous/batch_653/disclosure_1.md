## Dynamic Product 'Shadowing' & Anticipatory Bundling

**Concept:** Leverage opaque offering principles not just for price or attribute concealment, but to create dynamically 'shadowed' product versions that anticipate customer needs *before* they explicitly search for them, bundling them proactively. This moves beyond reactive opacity to proactive anticipation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Shadow Profile (BSP) Generation:**
    *   Each customer has a BSP constructed using purchase history, browsing data, explicitly stated preferences (wishlists, saved items), and inferred needs (e.g., frequent baby product purchases suggest upcoming needs for toddler items).
    *   BSP weights attributes beyond simple category.  Includes style, material, color preference, functional needs (e.g., 'needs waterproof', 'prefers lightweight').
    *   BSP is a vector representing preferred attribute values.

2.  **Product 'Shadow' Creation:**
    *   For each product in the catalog, a ‘shadow’ product is created. The shadow product inherits most attributes of the original but has *mutable* values for certain key attributes – specifically those heavily weighted in the BSP of potentially interested customers.
    *   Mutability is controlled by a ‘shadow weight’ assigned to each attribute. High shadow weight means attribute is likely to be altered.
    *   The shadow product is *not* displayed directly. It exists only in the system as a potential offering.

3.  **Proactive Bundle Generation:**
    *   A ‘bundle engine’ scans customer BSPs and identifies products with potential matches.
    *   The bundle engine dynamically adjusts the shadow product's mutable attributes *towards* the customer’s BSP profile.
    *   Instead of presenting a single opaque product, the system presents an *opaque bundle* composed of the adjusted shadow product and a few complementary items.
    *   Bundle price is optimized using a dynamic pricing algorithm (similar to the original patent’s opaque pricing).

4.  **Bundle Presentation & ‘Reveal’ Mechanic:**
    *   The bundle is presented with minimal detail – perhaps a descriptive theme (“Adventure Ready”, “Cozy Night In”, “Smart Home Starter”). The price is highlighted.
    *   The customer has a "Reveal" option.  Clicking ‘Reveal’ displays the full contents of the bundle *and* the standard, transparent offering of the original product. This allows comparison.
    *   Reveal data is logged to refine BSPs and shadow product adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Generation):**

```
function generate_bundle(customer_BSP, product_catalog):
  // Find products with potential match
  potential_products = find_products_matching_BSP(customer_BSP, product_catalog)

  best_product = select_best_product(potential_products)
  shadow_product = create_shadow_product(best_product)

  //Adjust shadow product attributes based on BSP
  for each attribute in shadow_product.mutable_attributes:
    shadow_product.attribute = adjust_attribute_towards_BSP(attribute, customer_BSP)

  complementary_items = find_complementary_items(shadow_product)
  bundle = create_bundle(shadow_product, complementary_items)

  bundle_price = calculate_bundle_price(bundle)
  return bundle
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **BSP (Behavioral Shadow Profile):**  `{attribute1: weight1, attribute2: weight2, ...}`
*   **Shadow Product:** `{product_id, mutable_attributes: {attribute1: value1, attribute2: value2, ...}}`
*   **Bundle:** `{bundle_id, products: [product1, product2, ...], price}`

**Potential Applications:**

*   Personalized gifting recommendations.
*   Anticipatory replenishment of consumable goods.
*   Proactive offering of accessories or upgrades.
