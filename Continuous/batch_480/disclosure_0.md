**Asynchronous, Multi-Factor Key Rotation & Validation Service**

**Concept:** Extend the patent's digital signature verification to incorporate automated, asynchronous key rotation *and* validation against multiple Certificate Authorities (CAs). This builds a resilient, highly secure system capable of handling compromised keys or CA outages.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Service:** `KeyRotationService`
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `RequestEnvelope`: Contains original request data, request ID, and initiating client identifier.
    *   `SignedResponse`: Contains response data, digital signature, key ID used for signing, and CA location(s).
    *   `KeyRotationRecord`: Stores key ID, associated public/private key pair, rotation schedule, and active status.
    *   `CAInfo`: Stores CA URL, trust parameters, and health status.
*   **Components:**
    *   `RequestProcessor`: Receives client requests, generates a unique request ID, and queues the request for processing.
    *   `AsynchronousWorker`: Retrieves requests from the queue, initiates the asynchronous process.
    *   `KeyManager`: Manages key lifecycle (generation, storage, rotation, revocation).
    *   `SignatureGenerator`: Generates digital signatures using the appropriate private key.
    *   `CAValidator`: Validates digital signatures against multiple CAs. It includes health checks to detect CA outages and dynamically switch to healthy CAs.
    *   `ResponseAssembler`: Creates `SignedResponse` containing response data, digital signature, key ID, and CA location(s).
    *   `TokenGenerator`: Packages the `SignedResponse` into a JWT (or JWS) token.
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  Client sends request.
    2.  `RequestProcessor` receives request, generates `RequestID`, queues request.
    3.  `AsynchronousWorker` retrieves request.
    4.  `KeyManager` determines the appropriate key (or generates a new key pair if rotation is scheduled).
    5.  Asynchronous process executes.
    6.  `SignatureGenerator` digitally signs the response data using the private key.
    7.  `CAValidator` validates signature against configured CAs. Fails over to another CA if primary is unreachable.
    8.  `ResponseAssembler` creates `SignedResponse` including CA location.
    9.  `TokenGenerator` packages `SignedResponse` into a JWT token.
    10. Token is returned to the client.
*   **Key Rotation Schedule:** Configurable rotation intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) or triggered by events (e.g., suspected compromise).
*   **Multi-CA Support:** Configurable list of trusted CAs.  `CAValidator` will attempt validation against each CA in order until successful.
*   **Compromised Key Handling:**  Mechanism to identify and revoke compromised keys. Automatically triggers key rotation.  Revocation status is incorporated into the JWT token.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/request`: Receive client request.
    *   `/status/{requestID}`: Check request status.
    *   `/revoke/{keyID}`: Revoke a key.
    *   `/health`: Check service health.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation Logic):**

```
function rotateKey(keyID) {
  newKeyPair = generateKeyPair()
  storeKeyPair(newKeyPair)
  markOldKeyAsRevoked(keyID)
  updateActiveKey(newKeyPair.publicKey)
  // Distribute new public key to relevant services.
}

function getKeyForSigning(request) {
    activeKey = getActiveKey()
    if(isKeyRevoked(activeKey)){
        rotateKey(activeKey)
        activeKey = getActiveKey()
    }
    return activeKey
}
```
