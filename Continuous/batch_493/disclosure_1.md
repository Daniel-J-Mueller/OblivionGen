## Adaptive Crash Report Prioritization & Selective Data Transmission

**Concept:** Extend the multi-stage reporting system to dynamically prioritize and selectively transmit crash data based on real-time system conditions, user impact, and predictive analysis of crash severity. This moves beyond simply separating metadata/artifacts to *intelligent* data streaming.

**Specs:**

**1. Severity Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Crash metadata (call stack depth, exception type, memory usage at crash, thread state, user context â€“ e.g., active feature, input data), system load (CPU, memory, network), historical crash data (frequency, impact), user segmentation (premium vs. free, usage patterns).
*   **Process:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Forest) trained to predict a 'Crash Severity Score' (CSS) ranging from 1-10.  Higher CSS indicates a more impactful/urgent crash.  The model must be dynamically retrainable with incoming crash data to improve accuracy.  Consider incorporating anomaly detection to flag unusual crash patterns.
*   **Output:** CSS value assigned to each crash.

**2. Adaptive Data Transmission Engine:**

*   **Input:** CSS, available bandwidth, system load, user settings (e.g., data usage preferences), crash metadata, artifact data.
*   **Process:** Implement a tiered transmission strategy based on CSS:
    *   **CSS 1-3 (Low Severity):** Transmit only essential metadata (exception type, thread ID, basic call stack). Artifacts are *not* transmitted immediately. Queue artifacts for delayed, off-peak transmission.
    *   **CSS 4-6 (Medium Severity):** Transmit metadata *and* a reduced artifact set (e.g., a minidump containing only essential thread context, key log entries).  Prioritize transmission over lower-priority network traffic.
    *   **CSS 7-10 (High Severity):** Transmit metadata *and* full artifact set (crash dump, logs, etc.) with highest priority. Initiate immediate alerts to developers.  Potentially trigger automated rollback to a stable version.
*   **Bandwidth Adaptation:** Dynamically adjust artifact set size and transmission rate based on available bandwidth. Implement compression techniques to minimize data transfer.
*   **Queue Management:** Maintain separate queues for different CSS levels. Implement prioritization within queues based on time since crash.

**3. Data Enrichment & Contextualization:**

*   **Process:** Before transmitting data, enrich it with contextual information:
    *   User activity logs surrounding the crash event.
    *   Device configuration details (OS version, hardware specs).
    *   Network conditions at the time of the crash.
    *   Feature flags enabled during the session.
*   **Output:** Enriched crash reports with comprehensive contextual data.

**4.  Selective Artifact Generation:**

*   **Process:** Based on the predicted severity, trigger *different* artifact generation processes.  For low severity crashes, only generate a minimal artifact set.  For high severity crashes, trigger a full, comprehensive artifact generation process, including potentially triggering automated testing/repro steps.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Data Transmission Engine):**

```
function transmitCrashData(crashData, CSS, bandwidth, systemLoad):
    if CSS <= 3:
        transmitMetadata(crashData.metadata)
        queueArtifactsForDelayedTransmission(crashData.artifacts)
    elif CSS <= 6:
        transmitMetadata(crashData.metadata)
        reducedArtifacts = generateReducedArtifactSet(crashData.artifacts)
        transmitArtifacts(reducedArtifacts)
    else:
        transmitMetadata(crashData.metadata)
        transmitArtifacts(crashData.artifacts)

function generateReducedArtifactSet(artifacts):
    # Implementation details for reducing artifact set size
    # (e.g., removing unnecessary log entries, limiting minidump size)
    return reducedArtifacts
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond merely staging data transmission. It *intelligently* selects what, when, and how crash data is transmitted, optimizing for speed, bandwidth, and developer efficiency. The dynamic severity prediction and adaptive artifact generation are key differentiators.
