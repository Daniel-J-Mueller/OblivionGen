## Dynamic Event Schema Evolution & Predictive Filtering

**Concept:** Extend the event processing pipeline to not only *categorize* events based on predefined schemas and filters but to *learn* and *adapt* those schemas dynamically. Furthermore, introduce a predictive filtering layer that anticipates event types *before* full parsing, optimizing resource allocation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Adaptive Schema Repository:**

*   **Data Structure:** A hierarchical key-value store (e.g., a graph database) representing event schemas. Keys are event attributes (fields), values define data types, validation rules, and associated filters.
*   **Learning Mechanism:** Implement a Bayesian network or similar probabilistic model to infer schema changes based on incoming event data.  When an event contains attributes not present in the current schema, the model evaluates the likelihood of integrating those attributes.  A threshold determines whether the schema is updated.
*   **Versioning:** Maintain multiple versions of each schema. This allows rollback to previous configurations and A/B testing of schema changes.
*   **Schema Conflict Resolution:** Develop a strategy to handle conflicting schema updates (e.g., based on event source priority or a weighted consensus algorithm).

**2. Predictive Filtering Layer:**

*   **Feature Extraction:** Before full event parsing, extract a small set of "fingerprint" features (e.g., first N characters, frequency of certain keywords, data type of initial fields).
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a decision tree, a k-nearest neighbors classifier) to predict the likely event type based on these fingerprint features.
*   **Dynamic Filter Assignment:**  Based on the predicted event type, *pre-select* a set of relevant regular expression filters. This reduces the number of filters that need to be applied during full parsing.
*   **Confidence Scoring:**  Assign a confidence score to the predicted event type. If the confidence is low, apply a wider range of filters as a fallback.

**3. Event Enrichment & Contextualization:**

*   **External Data Sources:** Integrate with external data sources (e.g., user profiles, device information, geographical locations) to enrich event data.
*   **Contextual Rules:** Define rules that apply transformations and calculations to event data based on context (e.g., time of day, user segment, device type).
*   **Event Correlation:**  Implement algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between events, enabling more sophisticated analysis and alerting.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Filtering):**

```
function process_event(event_data):
  fingerprint = extract_fingerprint(event_data)
  predicted_type, confidence = predict_event_type(fingerprint)

  if confidence > threshold:
    relevant_filters = get_filters_for_type(predicted_type)
    parsed_event = apply_filters(event_data, relevant_filters)
    return parsed_event
  else:
    all_filters = get_all_filters()
    parsed_event = apply_filters(event_data, all_filters)
    return parsed_event
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Event data arrives.
2.  Predictive Filtering Layer extracts fingerprint and predicts event type.
3.  Relevant filters are selected.
4.  Event is parsed using selected filters.
5.  Parsed event is enriched with contextual data.
6.  Event is sent to the appropriate compute engine.
7.  Adaptive Schema Repository learns from incoming event data and updates schemas as needed.
