## Adaptive Prediction with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple counter-based hot/cold page classification by introducing a temporal decay function to the counter values, alongside probabilistic prediction of future access. This creates a system that doesn't just *react* to access patterns, but anticipates them, and adapts to changing workloads more efficiently.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Data Structure: Access History Table (AHT)**

*   **AHT Entry:** Each memory page has a corresponding entry in the AHT.
*   **Fields:**
    *   `Page Address`: Physical memory address of the page.
    *   `Access Counter`: Integer representing cumulative accesses (as in the source patent).
    *   `Temporal Decay Factor (α)`: Floating-point value between 0 and 1.  Higher values mean slower decay; lower values mean faster decay.  Initial value set by system administrator based on expected workload volatility.
    *   `Decayed Counter Value (DCV)`:  A floating-point value calculated as follows:  `DCV = (1 - α) * DCV_previous + α * Access Counter`.  Where `DCV_previous` is the previous `DCV` value. Initialized to 0.
    *   `Access Probability (P)`: A floating-point value between 0 and 1 representing the predicted probability of access in the next time window.  Initialized to 0.5.

**2.  Prediction Engine:**

*   **Time Window:** Define a fixed time window (e.g., 10ms, 100ms) for prediction.
*   **Access History Tracking:** Monitor accesses within each time window.
*   **Probability Update:** After each time window:
    *   If the page was accessed: `P = P * 0.9 + 0.1` (increase probability)
    *   If the page was *not* accessed: `P = P * 0.1` (decrease probability)
*   **Combined Score:** Calculate a combined score for each page: `Score = DCV * P`.  This score reflects both historical access frequency *and* predicted future access.

**3.  Migration Logic:**

*   **Thresholds:** Define a higher threshold (e.g., 0.8) and a lower threshold (e.g., 0.2) for the `Score`.
*   **Migration Rules:**
    *   If `Score` > Higher Threshold: Migrate page to faster memory.
    *   If `Score` < Lower Threshold: Migrate page to slower memory.
*   **Hysteresis:** Implement hysteresis to prevent frequent migrations around the thresholds.  Require a significant change in `Score` before triggering a migration.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Monitor migration rates. If migrations are too frequent, *increase* the thresholds. If migrations are too infrequent, *decrease* the thresholds.

**4. DMA Engine Modifications:**

*   **Counter Scan:** Scan the memory access counters as in the source patent.
*   **AHT Update:**  *In addition* to incrementing the access counter, update the `DCV` and `P` in the AHT.  This can be done in parallel with the counter scan to minimize overhead.
*   **Score Calculation:** Calculate the `Score` for each page based on the updated AHT data.
*   **Migration Queue:**  Create a migration queue based on the calculated scores and thresholds.
*   **Interrupt Generation:** Generate interrupts to initiate memory page migrations as needed.

**Pseudocode (DMA Engine):**

```
//Inside the DMA engine loop

scan_counters() // As in source patent

for each page in memory:
    access_counter = get_counter(page)
    decay_factor = get_decay_factor(page)
    dc_value = (1 - decay_factor) * dc_value_previous + decay_factor * access_counter
    
    if (page_was_accessed_in_last_window):
        access_probability = access_probability * 0.9 + 0.1
    else:
        access_probability = access_probability * 0.1
        
    score = dc_value * access_probability

    if (score > higher_threshold):
        add_to_migration_queue(page, "migrate_to_fast")
    elif (score < lower_threshold):
        add_to_migration_queue(page, "migrate_to_slow")

generate_interrupts_for_migration_queue()
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple counting by incorporating temporal decay and predictive access probability. This allows it to adapt more effectively to changing workloads and reduce unnecessary migrations, ultimately improving overall system performance. It provides a more nuanced and intelligent approach to memory page classification.
