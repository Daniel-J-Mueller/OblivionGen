## Adaptive Artifact Prefetching with Predictive Dependency Resolution

**Concept:** Extend proactive artifact seeding by dynamically adapting the prefetched set based on predicted build behavior. This moves beyond static dependency graphs to incorporate machine learning models that predict *which* dependencies are likely to be needed *next*, even before the build process explicitly requests them.

**Specification:**

**I. Components:**

1.  **Build Monitor:** Continuously observes build processes (multiple concurrent builds if possible). Tracks artifact requests, build steps executed, and timestamps.
2.  **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) trained on historical build data collected by the Build Monitor. This model predicts the next artifact likely to be requested, given the current build state. Inputs include:
    *   Current artifacts in use
    *   Sequence of recently requested artifacts
    *   Build step currently executing
    *   Timestamp information (build time, frequency)
3.  **Adaptive Prefetch Manager:**  Manages the prefetching of artifacts. 
    *   Receives predictions from the Prediction Engine.
    *   Maintains a ‘Prefetch Queue’ of artifacts to be sent to the client.
    *   Implements a scoring system based on prediction confidence. High-confidence predictions move artifacts to the top of the queue.
    *   Communicates with the Repository Manager to retrieve artifacts.
4.  **Repository Manager:** (As defined in the original patent). Responsible for storing and delivering artifacts.
5.  **Client Build Environment:** The system performing the software build. Includes caching mechanisms.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Seed:** The system performs an initial proactive seeding based on the static dependency graph (as per the original patent).
2.  **Build Monitoring:** The Build Monitor starts observing the build process.
3.  **Prediction & Prefetching:**
    *   The Build Monitor feeds the current build state to the Prediction Engine.
    *   The Prediction Engine predicts the next likely artifact(s).
    *   The Adaptive Prefetch Manager adds the predicted artifact(s) to the Prefetch Queue, scoring them based on prediction confidence.
    *   The Adaptive Prefetch Manager requests artifacts from the Repository Manager, prioritizing high-scoring items.
4.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** The Prefetch Queue is dynamically adjusted based on ongoing build behavior. If an artifact is requested explicitly, its prediction score is lowered to reduce redundant prefetches.
5.  **Client Reception:** The client receives prefetched artifacts and stores them in its cache. The client *always* validates prefetched artifacts before using them.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** Client validation data is sent back to the Prediction Engine to refine its models. This includes information about whether prefetched artifacts were actually used, the time saved by using them, and any errors encountered.

**III. Pseudocode (Adaptive Prefetch Manager):**

```pseudocode
function process_build_state(build_state, predicted_artifacts):
  for artifact in predicted_artifacts:
    artifact.confidence = calculate_confidence(artifact) //Based on prediction model output
    add_to_prefetch_queue(artifact)
  
function add_to_prefetch_queue(artifact):
  prefetch_queue.append(artifact)
  prefetch_queue.sort(key=lambda x: x.confidence, reverse=True)

function request_artifacts_from_repository():
  while prefetch_queue and (not repository_busy):
    artifact = prefetch_queue.pop(0)
    repository_manager.request_artifact(artifact)
    
function handle_explicit_artifact_request(artifact):
  # Lower artifact’s confidence score to reduce redundant prefetches
  artifact.confidence = artifact.confidence * 0.5
  
function validate_artifact(artifact):
  # Check if artifact is still needed/valid
  if (artifact is valid):
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**IV. Considerations:**

*   **Cache Invalidation:**  A robust cache invalidation mechanism is critical to prevent stale artifacts from being used.
*   **Network Bandwidth:** Adaptive prefetching needs to balance the benefits of reduced build time with the cost of increased network traffic. Rate limiting and prioritization are essential.
*   **Model Training:** The prediction model requires a large and representative dataset of build histories to achieve accurate predictions.
*   **Distributed Builds:** The system should be designed to handle distributed build environments, where multiple clients are building software concurrently.
