## Personalized Communication Zones

**Concept:** Extend the selective communication restrictions to physical space, creating “communication zones” linked to device location and user profiles. Imagine a home where a child’s device *only* receives calls when they are in their bedroom, or a public space where devices automatically silence except for emergency contacts when entering a designated ‘quiet zone.’

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Low-energy Bluetooth beacons strategically placed in defined spaces (rooms, zones within a building, public areas).
    *   Device-integrated or accessory-based Real-Time Location System (RTLS) module (UWB, Bluetooth AoA/AoD).
*   **Software – Core Logic (executed on device/edge server):**
    *   `ZoneDetection()`: Continuously scans for Bluetooth beacon signals and/or utilizes RTLS data to determine the device's current location/zone. Returns `zoneID`.
    *   `ProfileLookup(userID, zoneID)`: Queries a user profile database (local or cloud) for communication restrictions specific to the user (`userID`) and current zone (`zoneID`). Returns a `communicationProfile`.
    *   `communicationProfile` structure:
        *   `allowedCallers`: List of user IDs permitted to initiate calls.
        *   `allowedNotifications`: List of app/service IDs permitted to send notifications.
        *   `communicationMode`: Enum (`full`, `restricted`, `silent`). `restricted` allows only calls from `allowedCallers`. `silent` blocks all incoming communication.
        *   `timeRestrictions`:  Schedule defining allowed communication times within the zone.
    *   `CommunicationFilter(incomingCommunication, communicationProfile)`:  Intercepts all incoming communications (calls, notifications).  Compares the sender/app ID against the `communicationProfile`.  Blocks/allows based on profile rules.
    *   `EmergencyOverride()`:  A system-level function that bypasses all communication restrictions for emergency contacts (911, designated emergency contacts).
*   **Software – Configuration & Management (Cloud/App):**
    *   Zone Definition Tool: Allows administrators (parents, building managers) to define zones and associate them with specific locations.
    *   User Profile Management:  Allows users (or administrators on their behalf) to create and manage communication profiles.
    *   Scheduling Tool: Enables administrators to define time-based communication restrictions for zones.
*   **Pseudocode - Main Loop (executed on device):**

```
LOOP:
    zoneID = ZoneDetection()
    communicationProfile = ProfileLookup(userID, zoneID)

    incomingCommunication = ReceiveCommunication()

    IF EmergencyOverride():
        AllowCommunication(incomingCommunication)
    ELSE:
        IF CommunicationFilter(incomingCommunication, communicationProfile):
            AllowCommunication(incomingCommunication)
        ELSE:
            BlockCommunication(incomingCommunication) //Or route to voicemail/silent notification

END LOOP
```

*   **Extended Functionality:**
    *   "Do Not Disturb" modes triggered automatically upon entering specific zones (e.g., library, hospital).
    *   Integration with smart home systems to adjust lighting/volume based on communication restrictions.
    *   Privacy features to allow users to control which zones their location data is shared with.
    *   Geofencing capabilities for outdoor zones (e.g., school, park).
