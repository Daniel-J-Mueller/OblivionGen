## Adaptive Encryption Profile Orchestration

**Concept:** Leverage the established secure session key exchange mechanisms (like those in the provided patent) not just for encrypting data *within* a session, but as the basis for dynamically orchestrating encryption profiles across *multiple*, independent communication channels. Think of it as a ‘security aura’ extending from a trusted initial handshake.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Component: Security Profile Manager (SPM)**

*   **Function:**  Resides on the host (like the “first computing device” in the patent). It’s the central coordinator for encryption profiles.
*   **Inputs:**  
    *   Established symmetric key from a primary secure session (e.g., TLS handshake).
    *   Application-defined Quality of Service (QoS) parameters for each communication channel (bandwidth, latency, reliability).
    *   Security policies defined by the administrator (e.g., “high security” for financial data, “low security” for sensor data).
    *   Real-time network conditions (latency, packet loss).
*   **Outputs:**  Dynamically generated encryption profiles.

**2. Encryption Profile Definition:**

An encryption profile is a configuration set specifying:

*   **Encryption Algorithm:** (AES, ChaCha20, etc.).
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):** (HKDF, Scrypt, Argon2) – applied to the shared secret key to create channel-specific encryption keys.  The KDF parameters (salt, info) are *dynamically* generated by the SPM.
*   **Cipher Mode:** (CBC, CTR, GCM)
*   **Authentication Tag Length:** (for authenticated encryption)
*   **Key Rotation Interval:** (how often channel-specific keys are re-derived)
*   **Traffic Padding:** (to obfuscate data size and timing)
*   **Data Fragmentation/Reassembly Configuration:** (to further obscure data patterns)

**3. Orchestration Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
function generate_channel_profile(shared_secret, qos_params, security_policy, network_conditions):
    // 1. Calculate a 'risk score' based on QoS, Policy and Network conditions
    risk_score = calculate_risk_score(qos_params, security_policy, network_conditions)

    // 2. Select base encryption algorithm based on risk score (e.g., high risk -> AES-256-GCM)
    base_algorithm = select_algorithm(risk_score)

    // 3. Derive channel-specific key using KDF
    salt = generate_random_salt()
    info = generate_channel_info(salt) // Include salt in info for consistency
    channel_key = HKDF(shared_secret, salt, info)

    // 4. Adjust cipher mode and tag length based on latency requirements.
    if (latency > threshold):
        cipher_mode = CTR // Faster, but less secure
        tag_length = 32 // Minimum tag length
    else:
        cipher_mode = GCM // More secure, but slower
        tag_length = 128

    // 5. Determine padding and fragmentation based on bandwidth and packet loss.
    if (bandwidth < threshold or packet_loss > threshold):
        enable_padding = true
        enable_fragmentation = true
    else:
        enable_padding = false
        enable_fragmentation = false
        
    // 6. Create and return the encryption profile.
    profile = {
        algorithm: base_algorithm,
        cipher_mode: cipher_mode,
        tag_length: tag_length,
        key: channel_key,
        padding: enable_padding,
        fragmentation: enable_fragmentation
    }
    return profile
```

**4. Integration with Networking Stack:**

*   The SPM interfaces with the network drivers and security libraries to enforce the dynamically generated encryption profiles.
*   A lightweight agent on the destination host can validate the integrity of the encryption profile (using a shared secret or public key infrastructure).

**5. Use Cases:**

*   **Adaptive Streaming:** Adjust encryption levels for video streams based on network conditions and content sensitivity.
*   **IoT Device Communication:**  Dynamically secure communication channels between IoT devices and a central server based on device type and data criticality.
*   **Secure Multi-Party Computation:**  Orchestrate encryption profiles to enable secure collaboration between multiple parties.
