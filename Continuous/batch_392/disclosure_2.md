## Dynamic Haptic Masking & Content Projection

**Concept:** Extend content reflowing beyond visual repositioning to include localized haptic feedback combined with micro-projection. Instead of *just* moving content around a grasped area, subtly alter the tactile experience and *project* key information onto the user’s hand/grasp.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution, flexible micro-projectors embedded within the device bezel, facing inwards toward the display surface and extending slightly over the edge.  Minimum 1000 PPI.
    *   Localized haptic array – piezoelectric or similar – integrated directly beneath the display surface. Resolution: 2mm spacing.  Intensity range: 0-500mN.
    *   Capacitive touch sensing overlay, capable of accurately identifying grasp location, pressure, and surface area.
    *   Device orientation sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope) for precise contextual awareness.
    *   Dedicated image processing unit (IPU) for real-time projection mapping and haptic pattern generation.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Grasp Detection Module:**  Advanced algorithm analyzing touch data to identify and classify grasp types (firm, loose, pinch, flat-palm, etc.).  Machine learning based, trained on a diverse dataset of grasp patterns.
    *   **Content Masking Engine:**  Refines the existing content reflowing logic.  Calculates a 'masking zone' based on grasp detection *and* predicted obstruction. Incorporates edge-aware algorithms to minimize visual disruption.
    *   **Haptic Pattern Generator:** Translates content within the masking zone into localized haptic feedback. Example: Scrolling text represented by a wave-like vibration pattern. Icon outlines rendered as raised 'bumps'.
    *   **Micro-Projection Mapping:**  Projects key information *onto* the user’s hand or the area being obscured.  Examples:  Simplified navigation controls.  Key statistics.  Contextual help.  Animated highlights.  Real-time data visualizations.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment Loop:** Continuously monitors grasp position, pressure, and device orientation to refine content masking, haptic patterns, and projection mapping in real-time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Touch Input
onTouch(touchEvent) {
  graspData = detectGrasp(touchEvent);
  obstructionZone = calculateObstructionZone(graspData);

  // Content Reflowing
  reflowContent(obstructionZone);

  // Haptic Feedback
  hapticPattern = generateHapticPattern(obstructionZone);
  applyHapticFeedback(hapticPattern);

  // Micro-Projection
  projectionData = generateProjectionData(obstructionZone);
  projectContent(projectionData);
}

// Detect Grasp (Simplified)
detectGrasp(touchEvent) {
  // Analyze touch size, shape, duration, pressure
  // Classify grasp type (firm, loose, etc.)
  return graspData;
}

// Calculate Obstruction Zone
calculateObstructionZone(graspData) {
  // Use shape fitting, extrapolation, and device orientation
  // Determine area to mask
  return obstructionZone;
}

// Generate Haptic Pattern
generateHapticPattern(obstructionZone) {
  // Extract key content within the zone
  // Translate content into vibration patterns
  return hapticPattern;
}

// Generate Projection Data
generateProjectionData(obstructionZone) {
  // Select relevant information to project
  // Optimize for visibility and clarity
  return projectionData;
}
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Projection mapping requires precise calibration and potentially eye-tracking to ensure content aligns correctly with the user's hand.
*   Haptic pattern design is crucial for usability. Overly complex or distracting vibrations should be avoided.
*   Power management is a key consideration, especially for the micro-projectors.
*   Potential integration with AR/VR applications to create a more immersive experience.
*   Explore the use of different haptic technologies (e.g., electro-tactile stimulation) to enhance the tactile feedback.
