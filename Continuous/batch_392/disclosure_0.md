## Dynamic Sensory Augmentation Based on Predicted Category

**Concept:** Extend the user interface adjustment beyond visual changes (layout, images) to incorporate *other* senses – specifically, localized haptic feedback and ambient scent diffusion – triggered by the predicted category. This aims for a richer, more immersive, and memorable user experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Engine Integration:** Integrate with existing or novel localized haptic feedback devices (e.g., wristbands, chair actuators, phone vibration patterns) to deliver subtle, category-relevant tactile sensations.
*   **Scent Diffusion System:** A small, localized scent diffusion module (potentially integrated into the display housing or a nearby accessory) capable of releasing pre-defined scent profiles. Utilize micro-encapsulation or similar technologies for controlled scent release.
*   **Category-Scent/Haptic Mapping Database:** A database linking predicted categories to specific haptic patterns and scent profiles. Example:
    *   Apparel: Soft, flowing haptic pattern + Cotton/Fabric scent.
    *   Books: Gentle, rhythmic haptic pulse + Paper/Vanilla scent.
    *   Electronics: Rapid, precise haptic taps + Clean/Metallic scent.
    *   Food/Grocery: Warm, subtle vibration + Relevant food aroma (e.g., citrus, coffee).
*   **Intensity Control:** User-adjustable intensity levels for both haptic and scent feedback.
*   **Safety Mechanisms:** Safety features to prevent overstimulation or allergic reactions (e.g., automatic shut-off, scent cartridge replacement reminders).

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION handle_search_query(search_query):
    predicted_category = predict_category(search_query)

    haptic_profile = get_haptic_profile(predicted_category)
    scent_profile = get_scent_profile(predicted_category)

    // Activate haptic feedback
    activate_haptic(haptic_profile, user_intensity)

    // Activate scent diffusion
    activate_scent(scent_profile, user_intensity)

    // Display search results
    display_results(search_query)
```

**Further Refinement:**

*   **Personalized Profiles:** Allow users to create personalized sensory profiles based on their preferences and sensitivities.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Adjust sensory feedback *dynamically* based on user interaction (e.g., increased haptic intensity when browsing specific items).
*   **AI-Driven Optimization:** Use machine learning to optimize sensory profiles based on user feedback and engagement metrics.
*   **Multi-Modal Integration:** Combine sensory augmentation with other modalities (e.g., ambient lighting, spatial audio) for a truly immersive experience.
