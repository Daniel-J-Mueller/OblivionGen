## Secure Key Rotation via Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) Assisted Indexing

**Concept:** Expand the fuse-based key storage to include a PUF-generated index mapping. This moves beyond pre-provisioned indices to a dynamically generated, device-unique index system, significantly enhancing security and key diversity.

**Specifications:**

*   **PUF Integration:** Incorporate a silicon PUF (e.g., Arbiter PUF, Ring Oscillator PUF) into the SoC alongside the fuse-based memory. The PUF will generate a device-unique “seed” during power-up or a secure boot sequence.
*   **Index Generation:** The processor will utilize the PUF seed as input to a Key Derivation Function (KDF). The KDF will output a series of indices. These indices select prime number pairs from the fuse-based memory. The number of indices generated should be configurable – allowing a “depth” of key rotation beyond what is physically stored in the fuse bank.
*   **Fuse Bank Expansion:** The fuse bank’s storage capacity can be optimized. Instead of needing indices for *every* possible key, we only need enough indices to cover the ‘depth’ of rotation.
*   **Key Derivation Process:**
    1.  Power-up/Secure Boot: PUF generates seed.
    2.  Seed is input to KDF. KDF outputs N indices.
    3.  Processor retrieves prime number pairs corresponding to the first index.
    4.  RSA/ECC key pair is derived.
    5.  Cryptographic operations begin.
    6.  Upon trigger event: Processor retrieves the *next* index from the KDF output. This selects a different prime number pair.
    7.  A new key pair is derived and used. This continues until all indices from the KDF output have been utilized, at which point the process can repeat with a newly generated PUF seed.
*   **KDF Parameters:** The KDF algorithm (e.g., HKDF, PBKDF2) and its parameters (salt, iterations) must be configurable during manufacturing.
*   **Trigger Events:** Expanded to include sensor data (e.g. accelerometer readings for tamper detection) and external signals received over a secure channel.
*   **Anti-Replay Mechanism:** Introduce a counter (stored in secure memory) which is incremented with each key rotation. This prevents replay attacks that could attempt to force the system back to a known key.
*   **Secure Boot Integration:** The PUF-generated seed must be verified during the secure boot process to ensure authenticity and prevent malicious manipulation.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization (Power-up/Secure Boot)
PUF_Seed = GeneratePUFSeed()
KDF_Output = KDF(PUF_Seed, Configurable_Parameters) // KDF outputs array of indices
Current_Index = 0
Counter = 0

//Key Rotation Function
Function RotateKey() {
  PrimePair = RetrievePrimePair(KDF_Output[Current_Index])
  PrivateKey = DerivePrivateKey(PrimePair)
  Counter++
  Current_Index = (Current_Index + 1) % KDF_Output.length
  Return PrivateKey
}

//Trigger Event Handler
OnTriggerEvent() {
  NewPrivateKey = RotateKey()
  Use NewPrivateKey for cryptographic operations
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced Security: PUF-derived indices significantly reduce the attack surface compared to pre-provisioned indices.
*   Key Diversity: Increased key diversity through dynamic index generation.
*   Tamper Resistance: PUF provides inherent tamper resistance.
*   Scalability: The system can support a large number of key rotations without increasing the size of the fuse bank.
*   Flexibility: Configurable KDF parameters allow for fine-tuning of security and performance.
