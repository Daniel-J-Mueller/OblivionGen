## Dynamic Contextual Annotation & "Echo" System

**Core Concept:** Expand the object-selection/supplemental information functionality to create a persistent, dynamically updating contextual "echo" overlaid on the text, and extend this echo beyond the immediate digital work to related content.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structure: Contextual Echo Object (CEO)**

*   `objectID`: Unique identifier for the selected object (character, place, thing, phrase, event).
*   `objectType`: Categorization of the object (Character, Location, Item, Event, Concept).
*   `excerptArray`: Array of relevant text excerpts from the *current* digital work.  Excerpts are stored with page/location metadata.
*   `externalDataArray`: Array of pointers/links to external data sources.  These could include:
    *   Knowledge graph entries (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia)
    *   Image/video links
    *   Audio clips (e.g., character voice samples)
    *   Links to related articles/websites
*   `contextWeight`: A numerical value representing the relevance/importance of this object *within the current context*. This is dynamically adjusted (see Algorithm below).
*   `visualRepresentation`:  Parameters for visual display of the object’s echo (color, icon, size, etc.). Derived from `contextWeight` and `objectType`.

**2. Algorithm: Dynamic Context Weight Adjustment**

*   **Baseline Weight:** Initial weight assigned to the object based on its explicit selection by the user.
*   **Proximity Boost:** When the user navigates the text, the weight of objects mentioned in nearby text is increased.  Distance decay function.
*   **Frequency Boost:** Frequent mentions of the object within a given chapter/section increase its weight.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze the sentiment associated with the object in the surrounding text.  Positive sentiment boosts weight, negative sentiment reduces it.
*   **User Interaction:** User explicitly "upvoting" or "downvoting" an object’s echo adjusts its weight.
*   **Cross-Work Correlation:** If the same object appears in multiple works within the user’s “library”, correlation factors are applied. Shared metadata/tags increase weight.

**3. User Interface – The “Echo Overlay”**

*   A semi-transparent overlay on top of the text.
*   Selected objects are visually represented as highlighted words/phrases, with the visual characteristics (color, size, opacity) determined by the `contextWeight`.
*   Clicking/tapping an echoed object opens a side panel displaying:
    *   `excerptArray`: Relevant text excerpts.
    *   `externalDataArray`: Links to external resources.
    *   A “weight” slider allowing the user to manually adjust the `contextWeight`.
*   The user can filter the Echo Overlay by `objectType`.

**4. Cross-Work Integration & The “Web of Context”**

*   When the user navigates to a different digital work, the Echo Overlay automatically attempts to find matching objects.
*   If a match is found, the object's echo is displayed in the new work, carrying over its `contextWeight` and associated data.
*   A “Web of Context” visualization allows the user to explore the connections between objects across multiple works.  Objects are represented as nodes, and connections are based on shared metadata, co-occurrence, and user-defined relationships.

**Pseudocode – Echo Overlay Update**

```
function updateEchoOverlay(pageText, objectList) {
  clearOverlay();

  for (object in objectList) {
    objectID = object.id;
    objectType = object.type;
    contextWeight = calculateContextWeight(object, pageText);

    visualParams = deriveVisualParams(contextWeight, objectType);

    highlightObjectInText(pageText, object.name, visualParams);
  }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   AI-powered object detection and automatic echo creation.
*   Collaborative echo sharing – users can contribute to and refine the echo for a given object.
*   Integration with external knowledge graphs for richer contextual data.
*   Adaptive echo filtering based on user reading patterns and preferences.
