## Autonomous Device: Environmental Mapping & Predictive Noise Cancellation

**Concept:** Expand the noise cancellation beyond audio processing into proactive environmental mapping and prediction, creating a "silent bubble" around the device.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution LiDAR sensor (integrated with microphone array).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - 9-axis.
    *   Edge TPU/NPU for on-device processing.
    *   Extended microphone array (minimum 8 mics, ideally 16+) with beamforming capabilities.
    *   Small, high-frequency speakers (for targeted sound masking – see software).

*   **Software – Core Modules:**

    *   **3D Environmental Mapper:**
        *   Input: LiDAR data, IMU data, microphone array data.
        *   Process: Construct a real-time 3D map of the surrounding environment (static objects, dynamic objects – people, cars, etc.).  Classify environmental surfaces (reflective, absorbent, etc.).
        *   Output: Dynamic 3D environmental map with surface classification.

    *   **Noise Propagation Modeler:**
        *   Input: 3D environmental map, microphone array data (ambient noise), identified noise sources (classification via audio analysis – engine noise, speech, construction, etc.).
        *   Process: Simulate how sound waves propagate through the mapped environment. Account for reflections, diffraction, absorption, and scattering. Predict future noise levels at the device’s current location and projected trajectory. Utilizes ray tracing/wave propagation algorithms.  Implement a physics-based sound model.
        *   Output: Predicted noise spectrogram and amplitude map.

    *   **Predictive Noise Cancellation:**
        *   Input: Predicted noise spectrogram, real-time microphone input.
        *   Process: Generate anti-noise signals *before* the noise reaches the microphones.  Adaptive filtering algorithms. Utilize the speaker array to create localized “silent zones” – proactively cancelling noise before it's recorded.
        *   Output:  Anti-noise signals for speaker array.  Filtered audio for processing.

    *   **Trajectory Prediction Module:**
        *   Input: IMU data, environmental map.
        *   Process: Predict the device’s movement trajectory based on historical data and real-time sensor readings.  Kalman filter/particle filter implementation.
        *   Output: Predicted trajectory coordinates.

    *   **Contextual Awareness Module:**
        *   Input: Environmental map, trajectory prediction, audio analysis.
        *   Process: Identify contextual information (e.g., “approaching car,” “person speaking,” “construction zone”). Adjust noise cancellation strategies based on context.
        *   Output: Contextual tags/labels.

*   **Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
loop:
    //Sensor Data Acquisition
    lidarData = getLidarData()
    imuData = getImuData()
    audioData = getAudioData()

    //Mapping & Prediction
    environmentalMap = updateMap(lidarData, environmentalMap)
    predictedTrajectory = predictTrajectory(imuData, environmentalMap)
    predictedNoise = predictNoisePropagation(environmentalMap, predictedTrajectory, audioData)

    //Noise Cancellation
    antiNoise = generateAntiNoise(predictedNoise)
    outputAudio = applyAntiNoise(audioData, antiNoise)

    //Output
    playAudio(outputAudio)
```

*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Personalized Noise Profiles:** Allow users to create custom noise profiles (e.g., prioritize suppressing specific sounds).
    *   **Directional Audio Enhancement:**  Enhance speech from a specific direction while suppressing noise from other directions.
    *   **Adaptive Beamforming:**  Dynamically adjust the beamforming pattern of the microphone array to focus on the most relevant sound sources.
    *   **AI-Powered Sound Classification:**  Utilize machine learning to accurately identify and classify different sound sources.
