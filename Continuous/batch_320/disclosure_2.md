## Dynamic Content Reflow with Predictive Zoom

**Concept:** Expand on the content portioning and display mechanisms by integrating predictive zoom levels based on reading speed *and* content complexity, dynamically reflowing text within identified content portions *before* display to optimize readability and minimize scrolling.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Digital Image (text-rich) & User Reading Data (reading speed - words per minute, scroll speed, dwell time on content).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Content Complexity Analysis:**  Implement a natural language processing (NLP) component to analyze content portions for lexical density, sentence complexity, and the presence of specialized terminology. Assign a complexity score (1-10) to each content portion.
    *   **User Reading Speed Tracking:** Monitor user scroll speed, dwell time (time spent viewing a content portion), and ideally, eye-tracking data (if available) to establish baseline and real-time reading speeds (WPM).
    *   **Predictive Zoom Level Calculation:**
        *   `Zoom Level = Base Zoom + (Complexity Score * Complexity Weight) + (Reading Speed Delta * Speed Weight)`
            *   `Base Zoom`: Default zoom level.
            *   `Complexity Weight`: User-adjustable value (0-1) to prioritize content complexity.
            *   `Speed Weight`: User-adjustable value (0-1) to prioritize reading speed.
            *   `Reading Speed Delta`: Difference between user's current reading speed and their average reading speed. Positive delta = slower reading.
*   **Output:**  Calculated Zoom Level for each content portion.

**2. Dynamic Content Reflow Module:**

*   **Input:** Original Content Portion, Calculated Zoom Level.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Content Portion Boundary Adjustment:**  Algorithm dynamically adjusts content portion boundaries *before* expansion, utilizing word division data as in the original patent, to optimize reflow for the calculated zoom level.
    *   **Reflow Algorithm:**
        *   Determine target width for the content portion based on zoom level and display characteristics.
        *   Utilize a just-in-time (JIT) text reflow algorithm.  The algorithm prioritizes minimizing hyphenation and maintaining natural line breaks while maximizing space utilization.
        *   Content portion is 'soft-wrapped' â€“ text is reflowed within the portion *before* it is expanded for display.
*   **Output:** Reflowed Content Portion with adjusted boundaries.

**3. Display Module:**

*   **Input:** Reflowed Content Portion.
*   **Process:**
    *   Expand the reflowed content portion to fit the display.
    *   Present content sequentially, as in the original patent.
*   **Output:** Displayed content portion.

**4. User Configuration Module:**

*   Allow users to adjust:
    *   Base Zoom Level.
    *   Complexity Weight.
    *   Speed Weight.
    *   Minimum/Maximum Zoom Levels.
    *   Enable/Disable Predictive Zoom.

**Pseudocode - Zoom Level Calculation:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateZoomLevel(complexityScore, readingSpeedDelta, baseZoom, complexityWeight, speedWeight)
  zoomLevel = baseZoom + (complexityScore * complexityWeight) + (readingSpeedDelta * speedWeight)
  
  //Clamp zoom level to acceptable range
  IF zoomLevel < MIN_ZOOM THEN
    zoomLevel = MIN_ZOOM
  ENDIF
  
  IF zoomLevel > MAX_ZOOM THEN
    zoomLevel = MAX_ZOOM
  ENDIF
  
  RETURN zoomLevel
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Powered Content Understanding:** Integrate a more sophisticated AI model to understand content themes and context, allowing for even more intelligent zoom level adjustments.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Allow the system to learn user reading preferences over time, refining the zoom level calculations and providing a truly personalized reading experience.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:**  Utilize haptic feedback to signal changes in zoom level or content complexity.
