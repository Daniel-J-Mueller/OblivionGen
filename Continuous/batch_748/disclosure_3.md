## Automated Mobile Vehicle Swarm Topology & Dynamic Relay Network

**Concept:** Expanding on the idea of automated mobile vehicles providing coverage in a materials handling facility, this system proposes a dynamic, self-organizing swarm topology for these vehicles, coupled with a dynamic relay network for data and power. The key is not just *where* the vehicles dock, but *how* they coordinate and share resources.

**Specifications:**

*   **Vehicle Hardware:**
    *   Each vehicle possesses a short-range, high-bandwidth wireless communication module (UWB or similar).
    *   Each vehicle has a directional charging coil *and* a receiving coil. (bidirectional wireless power transfer)
    *   Each vehicle has edge-processing capabilities (GPU/TPU) for localized data analysis & decision making.
    *   Each vehicle is equipped with a LiDAR/camera array for 3D mapping and localization.
    *   Each vehicle has a standardized docking interface (magnetic or mechanical) compatible with various recovery locations.

*   **Recovery Location Hardware:**
    *   Recovery locations incorporate both static (shelf, hook) and dynamic (mobile robot-carried) docking stations.
    *   Each docking station has a bidirectional wireless power transfer coil.
    *   Each docking station is a node in a mesh network, reporting status (power availability, vehicle presence, network load).
    *   Dynamic docking stations are small, mobile robots capable of navigating the facility and deploying temporary docking points.

*   **Software/Algorithm – Swarm Topology Management:**
    *   **Distributed Consensus Algorithm:** Vehicles use a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft or Paxos) to collectively agree on the optimal swarm topology.  Topology changes are triggered by factors like facility load, vehicle battery levels, and infrastructure failures.
    *   **Virtual Force Field:** A virtual force field is applied to the swarm. Vehicles are “repelled” by congested areas and “attracted” to areas with high demand or low coverage.
    *   **Adaptive Routing:** Based on swarm topology and data demands, the system dynamically establishes multi-hop relay paths for data and power.
    *   **Predictive Battery Management:** The system uses machine learning to predict vehicle battery depletion rates and proactively guide vehicles to charging stations.

*   **Pseudocode – Swarm Topology Update:**

```
// Each vehicle executes this periodically

function updateTopology(currentTopology, facilityData, vehicleData) {

    // 1. Gather local data (battery level, location, data load)
    localData = getLocalData()

    // 2. Broadcast localData to neighbors (UWB)

    // 3. Receive data from neighbors

    // 4. Calculate a "cost" for each potential topology configuration
    //    (based on distance to charging, congestion, data load, etc.)
    cost = calculateTopologyCost(currentTopology, receivedData, localData)

    // 5. Consensus Algorithm (e.g., Raft) to agree on the lowest cost topology

    newTopology = consensus(currentTopology, cost)

    // 6. Adjust vehicle movements to conform to newTopology
    moveTowardsTarget(newTopology)
}
```

*   **Dynamic Power Sharing:** Vehicles at docking stations with excess power can wirelessly transmit power to neighboring vehicles, creating a distributed energy network.

*   **Data Relay Prioritization:**  The system prioritizes data relay based on criticality.  Real-time data from sensors monitoring critical infrastructure components takes precedence.
