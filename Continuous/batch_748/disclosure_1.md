## Adaptive Histogram Granularity via Wavelet Decomposition

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust histogram bucket sizes *within* a single histogram, leveraging wavelet decomposition to identify areas of high data density and automatically refine granularity. This goes beyond simple rebalancing – it creates a *variable-resolution* histogram, maximizing compression and query performance.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Pre-processing & Wavelet Transform:**

   *   **Input:** Columnar data block.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  Apply a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to the column data. Daubechies wavelets (db4 or similar) are recommended for their compact support and smoothness.
        2.  Decompose the data into multiple levels (e.g., 5-7 levels). Each level represents a different scale of detail.
        3.  Analyze the wavelet coefficients at each level. The energy or amplitude of the coefficients indicates data variation and density.  Higher energy = greater variation; lower energy = more consistent data.

**2.  Adaptive Bucket Generation:**

   *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  **Base Buckets:** Initially, create a set of coarse, equal-sized buckets for the entire data range.
        2.  **Refinement Loop:** For each level of the wavelet decomposition (starting from the finest scale):
            *   Identify regions (subbands in wavelet terminology) where the wavelet coefficient energy exceeds a threshold (configurable parameter). These areas signify high data density or variation.
            *   Split the corresponding base bucket(s) in those regions into smaller, more granular buckets. The number of new buckets is proportional to the wavelet coefficient energy.  A simple mapping: `num_new_buckets = floor(energy * scale_factor) + 1`.
            *   Merge adjacent buckets if their combined data count falls below a minimum threshold (configurable parameter). This prevents the creation of overly fragmented buckets.

**3. Probabilistic Data Structure - Hierarchical Bitmap**

   *   **Structure:** Instead of a single bitmap, employ a hierarchical bitmap structure.
        *   **Level 0:** Coarse-grained bitmap representing the initial base buckets.
        *   **Level 1+:** Bitmaps corresponding to the refined buckets at each level of granularity.  Each level stores bitmaps representing the refined buckets *added* at that level (delta encoding).
   *   **Storage:** Store the bitmap levels in a tree-like structure. This enables efficient querying – start at the coarsest level, and only descend to finer levels if necessary.

**4. Query Processing**

   *   **Process:**
        1.  Receive query for select data.
        2.  Traverse the hierarchical bitmap tree.
        3.  Start at the coarsest level. Examine the corresponding bitmap to identify buckets that potentially contain the data.
        4.  For each relevant bucket, descend to the next finer level. Examine the corresponding bitmap to refine the search.
        5.  Continue this process until the finest level of granularity is reached, or the search has narrowed down to a small set of buckets.
        6.  Only read the data blocks corresponding to the identified buckets.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function adaptiveHistogram(dataBlock):
  waveletCoefficients = applyDWT(dataBlock)
  baseBuckets = createEqualSizedBuckets(dataBlock)
  hierarchicalBitmaps = {}
  hierarchicalBitmaps[0] = createBitmap(baseBuckets)

  for level in range(1, numDWTLevels):
    refinedBuckets = []
    for region in waveletCoefficients[level]:
      if energy(region) > threshold:
        refinedBuckets.extend(splitBucket(findCorrespondingBucket(region), energy(region)))

    bitmap = createBitmap(refinedBuckets)
    hierarchicalBitmaps[level] = bitmap

  return hierarchicalBitmaps

function processQuery(query, hierarchicalBitmaps):
  relevantBuckets = []
  currentLevel = 0
  bucketsToExplore = [0] # Start with the first bucket

  while bucketsToExplore:
    bucketIndex = bucketsToExplore.pop(0)
    bitmap = hierarchicalBitmaps[currentLevel]
    if bitmap[bucketIndex]: # Bucket contains relevant data
      if currentLevel < len(hierarchicalBitmaps) - 1:
        # Explore refined buckets
        nextLevelBitmaps = hierarchicalBitmaps[currentLevel+1]
        for i in range(len(nextLevelBitmaps)):
            if nextLevelBitmaps[i]:
                bucketsToExplore.append(i)
      else:
        relevantBuckets.append(bucketIndex)

    currentLevel += 1
```

**Configurable Parameters:**

*   `numDWTLevels`: Number of levels of wavelet decomposition.
*   `energyThreshold`: Threshold for wavelet coefficient energy.
*   `minBucketDataCount`: Minimum data count for a bucket to remain unmerged.
*   `scaleFactor`: Factor used to map wavelet coefficient energy to the number of new buckets.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Adaptive Granularity:** Automatically adjusts granularity based on data distribution, maximizing compression and query performance.
*   **Reduced I/O:** Significantly reduces the number of data blocks that need to be read during query processing.
*   **Improved Compression:** Finer granularity in areas of high data density enables better compression.
*   **Scalability:** The hierarchical bitmap structure enables efficient querying of large datasets.
