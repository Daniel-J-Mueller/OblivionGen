## Automated Inventory "Wave" System

**Concept:** Expand the tilting bin concept into a cascading "wave" across multiple inventory holders, facilitating high-throughput item transfer without needing individual drive unit intervention for each bin.

**Specifications:**

*   **Inventory Holder Array:**  Inventory holders arranged in a linear or grid-like array. Each holder is mechanically linked to its neighbors.
*   **Linkage Mechanism:** Each holder utilizes a ratcheting linkage system. A central actuator (pneumatic, electric, or hydraulic) on *every other* inventory holder drives the tilting of its immediate neighbors through this linkage. The linkage isn't direct; it’s a sequenced release. Think dominoes – each one triggers the next, but with controlled timing.
*   **Actuation Sequence:**
    1.  Central Actuator on Holder 1 initiates a tilt.
    2.  Tilt mechanically transfers to Holder 2.
    3.  Holder 2 tilt transfers to Holder 3, and so on.
    4.  A 'reset' mechanism (spring-loaded or another small actuator) returns the holders to a neutral position after a defined delay, completing the wave.
*   **Item Detection:** Each bin has an optical or weight sensor. This data feeds into a central control system to dynamically adjust the “wave speed” and to skip bins with no items.
*   **Dynamic Wave Shaping:** The control system can *shape* the wave.  Instead of a uniform tilt, it can selectively activate/delay certain bins to direct items to different destinations (e.g., a sorting system). 
*   **Variable Linkage Resistance:** Each linkage contains a variable resistor. Adjusting the resistance allows fine-tuning of the 'wave' propagation speed and force, accommodating different item weights and preventing collisions.
*   **Drive Unit Role:** Drive units are repurposed to *move* entire sections of the inventory array into/out of position for loading/unloading or connecting to other sorting/fulfillment systems.  They no longer need to manipulate individual bins.
*   **Power & Control:** Power and control signals are distributed via a bus system running along the length of the inventory array.

**Pseudocode (Wave Initiation):**

```
FUNCTION initiateWave(startHolderID, direction, waveSpeed, itemData[])
  // itemData[] contains weight/size info for each bin

  FOR each holderID in range(startHolderID, arrayLength)
    IF direction == "forward"
      holderID = holderID + 1
    ELSE
      holderID = holderID - 1

    // Calculate Tilt Angle based on itemData for current holderID
    tiltAngle = calculateTiltAngle(itemData[holderID])

    // Activate Linkage for current holderID with calculated tiltAngle
    activateLinkage(holderID, tiltAngle)

    delay(waveSpeed) // Adjust delay for wave speed control
  END FOR

  //Reset wave
  resetAllLinkages()

END FUNCTION
```

**Materials:**

*   High-strength polymer or lightweight aluminum alloy for holder frames
*   Durable, low-friction materials for linkages and bin tilting mechanisms
*   Sealed sensors for reliable item detection in dusty environments.
