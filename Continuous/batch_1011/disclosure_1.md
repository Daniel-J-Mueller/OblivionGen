## Dynamic Persona-Based Recommendation Refinement

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple query-to-item mapping by incorporating dynamic user personas derived from real-time behavioral data.  Instead of static site-specific datasets, generate personalized recommendation adjustments on-the-fly, layering persona insights *over* the existing query-item associations.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Persona Engine:**
    *   Input: Stream of user event data (views, purchases, searches, dwell time, clicks, adds to cart).  Also accepts explicit user profile data *if available* (age, location, stated interests – treat as weak signals initially).
    *   Process: Employ a real-time clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, online k-means) to segment users into dynamically evolving personas.  Feature vectors should include event frequencies, item category preferences, search term semantics (using word embeddings), and session-based behavioral patterns.
    *   Output:  A probabilistic persona assignment for each user (e.g., User X is 70% Persona A, 20% Persona B, 10% Persona C).  Persona profiles should be updated continuously based on incoming data.

2.  **Persona-Aware Recommendation Layer:**
    *   Input: Original site-specific query-item list (from existing patent system). User’s probabilistic persona assignment. Persona-specific adjustment vectors.
    *   Process:  For each item in the original list:
        *   Fetch the persona-specific adjustment vector associated with the current user’s dominant persona. These vectors will contain weights indicating how much to boost or suppress the item's ranking for that persona.
        *   Apply the adjustment vector to the item’s score (e.g., weighted average of original score and persona adjustment).
    *   Output:  Re-ranked list of items tailored to the user’s inferred persona.

3.  **Adjustment Vector Generation:**
    *   Process:  Offline batch processing. Analyze historical user behavior *within each persona*.  Calculate the average click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, and dwell time for each item *within each persona*.  The difference between these metrics and the site-wide average for that item forms the basis of the adjustment vector.  (e.g., if Persona A consistently views Item Y at twice the site-wide rate, the adjustment vector for Item Y and Persona A will have a positive weight).
    *   Storage: Adjustment vectors are stored in a key-value store, indexed by item ID and persona ID.

4.  **Real-time Pipeline:**

    ```pseudocode
    function get_recommendations(user_id, search_query):
      // 1. Get base recommendations from existing system
      base_recommendations = get_base_recommendations(search_query)

      // 2. Determine user persona
      user_persona = get_user_persona(user_id)

      // 3. Re-rank recommendations
      for item in base_recommendations:
        adjustment_vector = get_adjustment_vector(item.id, user_persona.id)
        item.score = item.score + adjustment_vector.weight  // Apply adjustment

      // 4. Sort recommendations by score
      sorted_recommendations = sort(sorted_recommendations)

      return sorted_recommendations
    ```

5. **Cold Start Mitigation:**
   * For new users (no behavioral data): Assign a default persona based on basic demographic information (if available) or a “general interest” persona.
   *  For new items:  Apply a small, randomly generated adjustment vector initially.  The vector will be refined as behavioral data accumulates.
