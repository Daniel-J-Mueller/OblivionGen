## Adaptive Data Tiering Based on Access Entropy & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the multi-attach block storage with intelligent data tiering and predictive prefetching.  Currently, the patent focuses on consistent access *while* attached. This builds on that by optimizing *where* data resides, anticipating needs *before* access.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Analysis Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors access patterns (read/write frequency, data locality) for each block within a volume. Calculates Shannon Entropy for each block over a rolling time window (configurable: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week).  Higher entropy indicates more random access; lower entropy indicates sequential/predictable access.
*   **Data Structures:**  `BlockMetadata { blockID: UUID, entropyScore: float, lastAccessed: timestamp, tier: enum {SSD, NVMe, HDD} }`.  Stored in a globally accessible metadata service.
*   **Algorithm:**  Entropy calculation (standard Shannon Entropy formula).  Tier assignment rules (configurable thresholds based on entropy score):
    *   Entropy < 0.5: Tier = HDD
    *   0.5 <= Entropy < 0.8: Tier = SSD
    *   Entropy >= 0.8: Tier = NVMe

**2. Tiered Storage Infrastructure:**

*   **Storage Tiers:** Utilize a mix of storage technologies: HDD, SSD, NVMe.  Each tier is logically represented as a pool of storage resources.
*   **Data Migration Service:**  Responsible for moving data blocks between tiers based on the Entropy Analysis Module’s recommendations.  Uses asynchronous I/O to minimize performance impact.
*   **Migration Trigger:** Blocks are migrated when:
    *   Entropy score crosses a defined threshold.
    *   Block hasn’t been accessed for a configurable period (e.g., 7 days).
    *   Storage pool utilization exceeds a threshold (e.g., 80%).

**3. Predictive Prefetching Engine:**

*   **Access History Database:** Stores a detailed history of I/O requests for each virtual machine. Includes timestamps, block IDs, read/write flags.
*   **Pattern Recognition:**  Utilizes machine learning (e.g., LSTM networks) to identify recurring access patterns for each VM.
*   **Prefetch Queue:**  Based on predicted access patterns, the engine proactively fetches data blocks and stages them in a read cache (RAM or SSD).
*   **Prefetch Validation:** Before serving a prefetched block, the engine verifies that the VM actually requested it.  This avoids unnecessary data transfers.

**4.  Integration with Multi-Attach:**

*   **Membership Group Awareness:**  The Entropy Analysis and Prefetching Engine should be aware of the membership group for each volume. This allows it to optimize data placement and prefetching based on the collective access patterns of all attached VMs.
*   **Consistency Considerations:** Prefetching must not compromise data consistency.  Ensure that prefetched blocks are consistent with the latest committed writes.
*   **Metadata Synchronization:**  All metadata (entropy scores, tier assignments, prefetch queues) must be synchronized across all storage nodes.



**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```
function predictNextBlock(VM_ID):
  access_history = getAccessHistory(VM_ID)
  model = loadMLModel(VM_ID) // Load trained LSTM model
  predicted_block_id = model.predict(access_history)
  return predicted_block_id

function prefetchBlock(block_id):
  if block_id in read_cache:
    return // Block already cached
  block_data = readFromStorage(block_id)
  addToReadCache(block_id, block_data)

function handleIORequest(VM_ID, block_id, operation):
  predicted_block = predictNextBlock(VM_ID)
  prefetchBlock(predicted_block)

  if operation == "READ":
    if block_id in read_cache:
      return read_cache[block_id]
    else:
      return readFromStorage(block_id)
  elif operation == "WRITE":
    writeToStorage(block_id, data)
    // Update access history
```
