## Dynamic Application Workspace Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the window switching paradigm to allow users to define and dynamically switch between *partitions* of application windows, rather than just individual windows.  Think of it like virtual desktops, but much more fluid and customizable *during* a session, and managed through the streaming service.

**Specifications:**

**1. Partition Definition & Management:**

*   **Partition Objects:**  Introduce a new object type: "Partition".  A Partition contains a named list of application window IDs.
*   **Partition Creation/Modification API:** The service exposes API endpoints for:
    *   `CreatePartition(partitionName)`: Creates a new empty partition. Returns a partition ID.
    *   `AddWindowToPartition(partitionID, windowID)`: Adds an existing window to a partition.
    *   `RemoveWindowFromPartition(partitionID, windowID)`: Removes a window from a partition.
    *   `DeletePartition(partitionID)`: Deletes an empty partition.
    *   `GetPartitionList()`: Returns a list of all current partition IDs and names.
    *   `GetPartitionContents(partitionID)`: Returns a list of window IDs contained within the specified partition.
*   **Client-Side Partition Manager:** The browser application includes a component responsible for:
    *   Displaying a list of available partitions.
    *   Allowing the user to create, rename, and delete partitions.
    *   Providing a drag-and-drop or selection interface for adding/removing windows from partitions.

**2. Partition Switching & Display:**

*   **Partition Switch Request:**  The client sends a `SwitchToPartition(partitionID)` request to the service.
*   **Service Response:** The service retrieves the list of window IDs for the requested partition. It then streams image data for *only* those windows. All other windows are effectively hidden from the client's display.
*   **Layout Management:** The service (or client) applies a predefined or user-customizable layout to arrange the windows within the partition.  Options include:
    *   Tile (horizontal/vertical)
    *   Grid
    *   Freeform (client-managed positioning)
*   **Dynamic Partitioning:** A user could select multiple applications in the browser and right-click a menu item labeled "Create Partition" which automatically generates the partition.

**3.  Streaming Protocol Extension:**

*   **Partition ID in Requests:** The streaming protocol is extended to include a `partitionID` field in all requests and responses. This ensures that the service knows which windows to stream for the current partition.
*   **Delta Streaming:** When switching partitions, the service uses delta streaming to minimize bandwidth usage. It only streams the image data for the *newly visible* windows.

**4.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Partition Persistence:** Partitions can be saved and restored across sessions.
*   **Partition Sharing:**  Partitions can be shared with other users. (Collaboration Feature)
*   **Context-Aware Partitioning:** Automatically create partitions based on application type or user activity (e.g., a "Development" partition with IDE, compiler, and debugger windows).
*   **AI-Assisted Partitioning:** AI can suggest or automatically create partitions based on user workflow.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Partition Manager):**

```
function onPartitionSwitchRequest(partitionID) {
    sendRequest("SwitchToPartition", partitionID);
}

function onPartitionListReceived(partitionList) {
    // Update UI with partition list
}

function onNewWindowCreated(windowID) {
    // Prompt user to add window to existing partition or create a new one
}

function onWindowClosed(windowID) {
    // Remove window from any partition it belongs to
}
```
