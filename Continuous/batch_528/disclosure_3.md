## Dynamic Call Route Personalization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback data from the caller (heart rate variability, skin conductance) to dynamically adjust call routing and audio processing, optimizing call quality *and* caller stress levels. This moves beyond purely quality-based routing to *experience*-based routing.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biofeedback Integration Module:**
    *   Hardware: Support for compatible wearable devices (smartwatches, earbuds with sensors) via Bluetooth. Option for direct integration with smartphone sensors (camera-based heart rate detection).
    *   Software: SDK for developers to integrate biofeedback data into call applications. APIs for accessing real-time and historical biofeedback data.
    *   Data Processing: Noise filtering, artifact removal, feature extraction (HRV, skin conductance, stress level estimates).

2.  **Dynamic Routing Engine:**
    *   Input: Call quality data (existing patent metrics), biofeedback data, caller location, time of day, caller profile (preferences, historical data).
    *   Routing Algorithm: A multi-objective optimization algorithm (e.g., Genetic Algorithm, Reinforcement Learning) to select the optimal call route based on minimizing call defects *and* minimizing caller stress levels.
    *   Route Prioritization: Routes are assigned a 'stress score' based on historical data (e.g., routes known to cause signal degradation, congestion, or echo).

3.  **Adaptive Audio Processing Module:**
    *   Noise Cancellation: Dynamic adjustment of noise cancellation levels based on biofeedback data. If caller stress increases despite good signal quality, reduce noise cancellation to provide a more natural soundscape.
    *   EQ Adjustment: Real-time equalization adjustment based on biofeedback data. Lower frequencies can be emphasized to promote relaxation if stress is detected.
    *   Volume Normalization: Adaptive volume normalization to prevent sudden loud noises that may startle the caller.

4.  **Caller Profile Management:**
    *   Data Storage: Secure storage of caller biofeedback data and preferences.
    *   Learning Algorithm: Machine learning algorithm to learn caller’s stress response patterns and personalize routing and audio processing.
    *   Privacy Controls: Granular privacy controls allowing callers to opt-in/out of data collection and personalization.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Routing):**

```
function select_call_route(call_data, biofeedback_data, caller_profile):

  routes = get_available_routes(call_data)

  for route in routes:
    quality_score = calculate_quality_score(route, call_data)
    stress_score = calculate_stress_score(route, biofeedback_data, caller_profile)
    combined_score = weight_quality * quality_score + weight_stress * stress_score

    route.score = combined_score

  sorted_routes = sort_routes_by_score(route)

  best_route = sorted_routes[0]

  return best_route
```

**Innovation Focus:** Move beyond merely optimizing call *quality* to optimizing the caller’s *experience*.  The biofeedback loop creates a closed-loop system that actively reduces caller stress and enhances communication effectiveness. This differs from existing systems which are largely reactive, and is a proactive optimization using physiological signals.
