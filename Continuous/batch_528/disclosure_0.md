## Dynamic Reflective Signage – "Chameleon Sign"

**Concept:** A sign utilizing a dynamically adjustable metasurface to alter its appearance—color, brightness, even projected imagery—without traditional LEDs or emissive materials. This leverages reflected ambient light instead of generating light.

**Specs:**

*   **Core:** Metasurface constructed from micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) actuated dielectric resonators. Each resonator is individually controllable. Material: Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) for mechanical stability and transparency.
*   **Actuation:** Piezoelectric actuators integrated with each resonator. Control signal: Variable voltage (0-10V) to adjust resonator geometry (tilt/displacement). Resolution: Minimum 1000 actuators per square foot.
*   **Reflective Control:** Resonator tilt controls the wavelength of light reflected. Precise control allows for color mixing. Brightness control achieved through collective resonator angle/displacement – maximizing or minimizing ambient light reflection.
*   **External Layer:** Transparent, durable, weather-resistant coating (Polycarbonate). Anti-reflective coating on the internal side to maximize light capture.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller (ESP32).
    *   Communication: Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for remote control and updates.
    *   Input: API for integration with environmental sensors (ambient light, time of day).  Allows for dynamic adjustments based on external conditions.
    *   Algorithm:  Mapping algorithm translates desired visual output to individual resonator control signals.  Must account for viewing angle and ambient light conditions.
*   **Power:** Low-voltage DC power supply (5V). Power consumption minimized through selective activation of resonators.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Resonator Control):**

```
// Define resonator array dimensions
int width = 100;
int height = 50;

// Define Resonator object (simplified)
class Resonator {
  int x, y;
  float angle; // Angle of tilt (degrees)
  void setAngle(float newAngle) {
    angle = newAngle;
    // Apply voltage to piezoelectric actuator to achieve angle
  }
}

// Initialize resonator array
Resonator[][] resonators = new Resonator[width][height];

// Function to set sign color (RGB)
void setSignColor(int red, int green, int blue) {
  for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {
    for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {
      // Calculate angle based on desired color and ambient light
      float angle = calculateAngle(red, green, blue);
      resonators[x][y].setAngle(angle);
    }
  }
}

// Placeholder for angle calculation - needs detailed spectral analysis
float calculateAngle(int red, int green, int blue) {
  //Complex calculation to derive tilt from color.
  return 0.0;
}
```

**Innovation:**  Shifting from emissive signage to *reflective* control. This approach dramatically reduces power consumption, increases lifespan, and unlocks possibilities for highly dynamic, visually complex signage.  Could potentially create the illusion of 3D imagery through precise control of reflected light angles.
